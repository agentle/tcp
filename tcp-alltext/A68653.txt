makeſt thou in this place, art thou here alone, or how cameſt

am ſo a hongered, that I could eate worſe meate then a peece

               The Duke greatly pleaſuryng to heare the pretie aunſwere
of the childe, replied in this wiſe: How ſaieſt thou my
little knaue, wilt thou bee my boye and dwell with me, and I
will giue thee good meate thy belly full, how ſaieſt thou wilt

               Yea forſooth Godfather (ꝙ the Childe) on that condition
you will giue me roſt meate enough, I will goe with you, for
I thinke I did not eate my bellie full of roſte meate, this moneth

                   The Duke then commaunded one of his men to take vp
the Childe, whom he caried awaie with hym, and now perceiuyng
it to be bothe well fauoured, quicke witted, and very apt
to learning, he brought it vp at Schoole, where he proued not

not farther able to ſpeake one woorde, but runnyng vp and
doune the Woodes, ſighing and ſobbing in great anguiſh of

He fortuned to meete certain labouryng men, that
dwelt in a poore Village not farre from the place, who perceiuing
by his geaſture, that he was paſſionated in his thoughts,
thei beganne with ſuche courteſie, as thei had learned in the
Countrie, to demaunde the occaſion of his greefe.

other aunſwere, then piteous ſighes and ſobbes: but the poore
Peſaunts, when thei had better behelde the talneſſe of his ſtature,
the ſeemelineſſe of his countenance, and the comelineſſe
of his perſonage, were greatly mooued with compaſſion towardes
hym, and with ſuche badde eloquence as their ſkill
would permit, beganne to perſwade hym to walke with them
to their Cabbins, where he might refreſh hymſelf, with ſuche
homely Iunckettes, as was prouided for their owne ſuppers.
The Duke contented to yeelde to their requeſtes, walked along
with them, where he remained all the night very penſiue
and heauie in his harte, and beganne to thinke with hymſelf,
that there was no more hope left for him to heare of his ſonne,
and therefore beganne to imagine, how he might render ſome
reléef to his poore wife and daughter, whom he had left as you
before haue heard.
               Now there was dwellyng hard by the place, a noble man
that was Lorde of the Village, who hauyng intelligence of
this diſtreſſed Straunger, cauſed hym to bee ſent for, before
whom when the Duke was preſented, after many queſtions
debated betweene them, the Noble man demaunded of the
Duke what Countrey man he was, and how he had béen trained
vp, & then if he could be contented to plaie the Seruyngman,
and would bee carefull and diligent in his Maiſters affaires,
that then, he would bee contented to receiue hym into
his ſeruice, and would rewarde hym accordyngly, as he was
able to deſerue.
               The Duke all aſhamed to bee knowne what he was, reuerently
made aunſwere, that he was borne in the Countrey of
Achaia: and that he had been trained vp in ſeruice with ſonderie
Noble men, and woud bee very well contented to doe his
beſt indeuour, to ſerue hym with the beſt ſeruice he could doe.
               Thus the poore Duke became a Seruyngman, whom we
will leaue with his Maiſter, and returne to his wife, who was
left in Hucſters handelyng (as you haue heard) remained in

               This vilaine in likewiſe, ſought firſt with piteous ſighes,

trie her with giftes, thinkyng that for the neceſſitie ſhe was

the Barke, whiche beyng put to Sea, was forced by the extremitie
of a contrarie winde, to put them ſelues romer for the
ſafetie of their liues, to a cleane contrarie place. And where
thei ment to haue ſailed to the Citie of Cayre, they were now
ariued at the Citie of Cherona, where the Ladie commyng

had made with life, by reaſon of the tempeſt, as ſhe ſorrowed
for beyng ſo farre driuen from her houſbande, whoſe fellowſhippe
ſhe more deſired, then either wealthe or worldly treaſure.
But for aſmuche as both her ſelf and her daughter, were
very euill at eaſe, and greatly infeebled with ſickneſſe at the
Sea, and bad liyng in the Shippe, ſhe determined to make
her abode ſtill at Cherona, till ſhe might conuaie letters to
Taryffa, that ſhould certifie her houſbande of all that had happened.
               In the meane tyme, her houſbande hauing receiued ſome
ſmall beneuolence of his Lorde and Maiſter, who had conceiued
ſome good likyng of hym, by reaſon of the ſkill that he
had in the ridyng of Horſe, very deſirous to render his wife
ſome portion of his good fortunes, who had been ſo long tyme
partaker of his euill happes, crauyng leaue of his Lorde for a
tyme, came to Taryffa, where when he miſſed his wife, whoſe
letters were not yet come from Cherona, and therefore could
get no inteligence, but that ſhe was gone to Cayre, of purpoſe
to ſeeke hym: in a greate perplexitie he traueiled towardes
Cayre, where makyng greate inquirie could learne nothyng

words to curſe the celeſtiall Signes, and Planets, which
raigned at the daie of his Natiuitie, and howre of his birthe,
contented to yeeld hym ſelf a captiue to miſhappe, and to ſurrender
hymſelf a ſubiect to Fortunes frowarde frumpes.
               Beyng thus turmoyled with greate anguiſhe of mynde,
wanderyng to and fro, he was brought ſo lowe and bare, that

he was readie to begge an almes from doore to doore, and cō

that he was glad to become a ſeruaunt to hym that was the
Sexten of the Pariſhe, whom he had not ſerued long, but the
olde Sexten his maiſter died, and for that he had now learned
to ryng Belles, and had ſome cunnyng in the keepyng of a
Clocke: the Pariſhoners were contented to place hym in his
Maiſters rome; the Duke thinkyng hymſelf more then thriſe
happie to gett ſo greate preferment, thanked Ladie Fortune
that had ſo freendly dealt with hym, reſoluyng hymſelf to cō
                  tinue

thankfull for a little, dealt more freendly with hym, as after
you ſhall heart.
               But I will firſt declare how it happened with his ſoonne
Aurelianus, who was taken vp in the woodes by the Duke of
Vaſconya; as before you haue heard.
               But here I muſte firſte remember you, that the Duke
chaunged his name from Aurelianus to Siluanus, whiche
name he gaue hym of purpoſe, for that he was founde in the
Woodes.
               
                  Siluanus now hauyng been trained vp at Schoole, was
come to mans eſtate, and beſides that he had the knowledge
of good letters, he was comely in his perſonage, and of very
good proportion, and in all maner of actiuities, appertainyng
to a Gentleman, he exceeded euery other that was in the
Courte, beſides in his demeanours he was ſo courteous and
gentle, that he gained the good will and likyng, bothe of one
and other, but eſpecially of the Duke hym ſelf, who alowed
hym ſuche large expenſes, whereby to maintaine hymſelf as
braue as the beſt.
               Now this noble Duke hauyng no other children but one
onely daughter, whoſe name was Valeria, in whom it ſeemed
that bothe Vertue and Beautie had heelde ſome greate contention,
who ſhould beare awaie the priſe, for although that
in beautie and good grace ſhe exceeded euery other Dame
yet her vertues and good conditions ſurmounted more he
                     •
                  
beautie, then the fineſt golde ſurmounteth leade or droſſe.
               
                  
This Ladie now hauyng heard greate reporte of the nobleneſſe
of Siluanus, who was ſuſpected to be but ſome poore
mans ſonne, by reaſon he was founde in the Woodes, began
yet to beare hym very good countenaunce, whiche at the firſt
proceeded but of the noble Nature, whiche euer was accuſtomed
to be fauourable to ſuche, in whom was founde any worthie
deſarte: but as the fiſhe whiche by little and little ſucketh
vppon the baite, till at the length ſhe ſwalloweth doune the
hooke, wherby ſhe hangeth faſt, not able to free her ſelf, ſo this
Lady Valerya, contemplating her ſelf many tymes to behold
that young Gentleman Siluanus, was ſo farre intangled with
his ſweete and pleaſaunt, countenaunce, that now perforce
her will, ſhe was conſtrained to yeelde to Loue, and feelyng
her ſelf inſnared, and bereued of former freedome, beeyng by
her ſelf alone, ſhe began to complaine as followeth.
               Alas (ſaieth ſhe) is it poſſible, that now force perforce my
mynde ſhould bee ſo altered, that ſtraiyng from the boundes
and limites of vowed Chaſtitie: I ſhould now become amourous,
and ſubiect to a certaine vnacquainted luſt, from whēce
commeth this alteration? or how happeneth this vnaccuſtomed
hewe? ah Loue Loue, how haſt thou tormented me, and
taken awaie the healthe and ſoundneſſe of my mynde, it behoueth
me to ſhewe my ſelf, as iſſued forthe of the noble houſe of
Vaſconya, and with the greater care I ought to take heede,
how I degenerate from the noble bloud whereof I am deſcended,
rather then to ſette my mynde on a fondlyng vnknowen,
vnto whom peraduenture if I diſcouer my fondneſſe,
will not let to mocke me for my labour, and for all the beautie
or nobleneſſe of my birthe, will make me his ieſtyng ſtocke,
and ſolace hymſelf with the fondneſſe of my conceiptes. But
ſtaie ſtaie vnhappie tongue, that thundereth forthe ſuche hatefull
wordes againſt my beloued Siluanus. Oh thriſe accurſed
wenche that can ſo vngently conceiue againſt hym, that in all
his demeanours, doeth ſhewe hymſelf as noble as the beſt, but
of what mettall are either Monarche, Kyng or Keiſer framed
of, otherwiſe then of naturall, and common earth, whereof other
men doe come? Or what maketh theſe differences, which

by ſottiſhe opinion we conceiue, either of gentle or vngentle▪
otherwiſe then the ſhew of vertue and good conditions. Then
the partie whom I loue, is bothe vertuous, valiaunt, ſage, of
good grace, learned and wiſe. Vaunt thee then Valeria, that
thou likeſt no inferiour fondlyng, vnworthie of thy loue, but a
worthie Gentleman, indued with noble qualities, in whom
bothe Heauen and Nature haue forgotten nothyng, to make
hym equall to them that marche in formoſt ranke: It is Siluanus
whom I loue, and of hym I pretende to make a lawfull
houſband, for otherwiſe I deteſt to lead the filthie life of lawleſſe
luſt, but thus the bonde of Mariage beyng made, I maie
loue and liue without offence of conſcience, neither ſhall I do
any blot or blemiſhe to the greatneſſe of my houſe. But if any
bee ſo ſcrupulous, as to thinke by marriyng of hym, I ſhould
deminiſhe myne honour: It is the thyng that I doe leaſt eſteeme,
for what is honour worthe, where the mynde is voyde
of contentation, and where the harte is bereued of his cheefeſt
deſire, the bodie remaineth reſtleſſe, and the mynde is neuer in
quiet. Siluanus therefore ſhall be my loyall houſbande, meanyng
thereby neither to offende God nor man.
               And now from hence forwardes, ſhe deuiſed with her ſelf,
how to make her loue knowne to Siluanus, not ſparyng when
ſhe was out of his preſence, before all men to praiſe his greate
perfections, wherewith he was enriched, and in his owne preſence
ſhe vſed ſuche louyng countenaunce towardes him, that
although Siluanus were but yong, and had neuer been trained
vp in the Schoole of Loue, yet he perceiued very well, that
thoſe frendly glances were lent him of good liking, and thoſe
louing countenaunces were grounded of good will, and albeit,
he ſawe the inequalitie and difference betweene them both,
ſhe beyng ſorted out of royall race, and hymſelf altogether ignorant
of his owne eſtate, and from whence he was ſprong,
yet beeyng now ledde by Loue, whoſe lawes haue no reſpect
either to eſtate or dignitie, he determined to followe his Fortune,
and to ſerue her, whiche ſo louyngly ſhewed her ſelf, to
requite hym with the like, and the more he called to mynde
the diuine beautie of his Ladie, her graces, wiſedome, behauiour,

and curteſie, ſo muche the more increaſed his deſire, fortifiyng
hymſelf againſt all miſhappes, and perilles that might
ſucceede, and began to debate with hymſelf in this maner.
               How is it poſſible that I ſhould be ſo fooliſhe, to deſpiſe a
duetie ſo rare and preciouſe, and to ſet light by that which the
nobleſt would purſue, with all reuerence and indeuour, I am
not the firſt, that hath obtained the loue of a Ladie: no no, I
ſee ſhe loueth me, and ſhall not I requite it by yeeldyng loue
againe, if I were ſo voyde of humanitie and good nature, beſides
I might worke myne owne ouerthrowe, in ſeemyng to
diſpiſe ſo noble a Ladie, ſo the Goddes would not let to miniſter
reuenge, as thei did vpon Narciſſus. But ah ſillie wretche
that I am, what follie is this that I haue now premeditated,
with the perill of myne honour, and the hazarde of my life: ſee
ſee how farre my affections begin to ſtraie, through the hot
aſſaultes of fooliſhe fantaſie, inraged with an appetite riſing
on vaine hope, what madneſſe on me to thinke that Valerya
will ſo muche forget the greatneſſe of her houſe, or yet unbaſe
her ſelf in reſpect of me poore ſillie ſoule: but what if ſhe
would be contented, either in reſpect of mariage or otherwiſe
in reſpect of good will, to ſurrender her ſelf to ſatiſfie my requeſt,
how muche were I the neare my purpoſe, alas nothyng
at al, the firſt, I knowe ſhould be denaide me by the Duke her
father, and as for any other curteſie, although I knowe it bee
farre frō her thought, yet ſurely myne owne conſcience would
not ſuffer me, to proffer ſo greate villanie to ſo noble a Ladie,
neither the reuerence and duetie whiche I owe to her father
would permit me, to requite his gentilneſſe towards me with
ſo greate an iniurie. Ceaſe therefore Siluanus, ſubdue thy ſenſualitie,
that by vanquiſhyng thy ſelf, thou maieſt ſet open the
gate to Fame, who with her Trompe of euerlaſtyng glorie,
ſhe maie aduaunce thee renowmed to all poſteritie.
               But alas, ſhall I then giue ouer to loue my Ladie Valerya,
reaſon willes me ſo to doe, but loue hath ſo blinded al my
ſences, that reaſon giueth no maner of light, what helpe haue
I then hereafter to hope for, alas I knowe no one, and therefore
be content. Herewithall he ſtaied his trauaile, reſoluyng

with hymſelf to conquere his affections, and beeyng in his
Chamber takyng pen and yuck, he ſate him doune and wrote
theſe verſes followyng.
               
                  No ſhame I truſt, to ceaſe from former ill,
                  Nor to reuert, the leudneſſe of the mynde:
                  Whiche hath bin trainde, and ſo miſled by will,
                  To breake the boundes, whiche reaſon had aſſyngde.
                  I now forſake the former tyme I ſpent.
                  And ſorie am, for that I was miſwent.
               
               
                  But blinde forecaſt, was he that made me ſwarue,
                  Affection fond, was lurer of my luſt:
                  My fancie fixte, deſire did make me ſerue,
                  Vaine hope was he, that trained all my truſt:
                  Good liking then, ſo daſeled had my ſight,
                  And dimnde myne eyes, that reaſon gaue no light.
               
               
                  O ſugred ſweete, that trainde me to this trap,
                  I ſawe the baite, where hooke laie hidden faſt:
                  I well perceiude, the drift of my miſhap.
                  I knewe the bit, would breede my bane at laſt,
                  But what for this, for ſweete I ſwallowed all:
                  Whoſe taste I finde, more bitter now then gall.
               
               
                  But loe the fruites, that grewe by fonde deſire,
                  I ſeeke to ſhunne, that pleaſed beſt my mynde:
                  I ſterue for colde, yet faine would quenche the fire,
                  And glad to looſe, that faineſt I would finde,
                  In one ſelf thyng, I finde bothe baall and bliſſe,
                  But this is ſtraunge, I like no life but this.
               
               When he had thus penned theſe verſes, he committed
them to memorie, and the next daie beyng in the companie of
certaine Gentlemen and Gentlewomen in the Court, taking

a Lute, whereon he could plaie very well, and hauyng likewiſe
good knowledge in his ſong, & therewithall a very pleaſaunt
voyce, he began to ſing this dittie before mentioned, in
the middeſt whereof came in the yong Ladie Valerya, wherewith
Siluanus ſtaied his ſong, but ſhe ioynyng her ſelf to the
cōpanie, ſeyng the ſainct that ſecretly ſhrined in her thought,
ſhe had vowed her greateſt deuotion vnto, deſired Siluanus, at
her requeſt, to begin his ſong againe: Siluanus, makyng the
matter nothyng nice, was pleaſed very well to ſatiſfie her requeſt,
and takyng the Lute began his ſong, to the whiche the
Ladie gaue intentiue eare, frō the beginnyng to the ending,
and perceiuing the ſong to be made in ſome extreame paſſion
forced by loue, ſhe demaunded of Siluanus who had penned
thoſe verſes, who aunſwered, thei were of his owne pennyng,
and ſo lately doen that he could not forget them: the Ladie
then thinking Siluanus to be in loue with ſome other Gentlewoman,
departed very ſpeedily, as though ſome ſodaine motion

                     〈◊〉
                   happened to her mynde, and comming to her Chamber,

                     •
                  huttyng faſt the doore, ſhe began to ſaie as followeth.
               How muche am I vnfortunate aboue all other women,
that beyng a Ladie of ſuche bloud as I am, and yet am happened
into ſo ſtraunge a miſerie, that in maner with myne
owne mouth, I haue made requeſt to hym, which rather with
all humilitie, ought to profer me his ſeruice, and yet am ſcornfully
reiected, and an other like to catche the birdes, whileſt I
doe but beate the buſhe. Oh Siluanus Siluanus, deemeſt thou
me no better worthe, then ſo lightly to reiect my proffered
loue, and ſhall an other that is muche leſſe worthie, beare awaie
the ſweete fruite of my deſired hope, and ſhall poſſeſſe
without deſert, the glorie due to a firme and faithfull frende?
No no, I can not thinke thee ſ
                     •
                   ingrate, and my harte foretelleth
me, that it is impoſſible my Siluanus ſhould wander ſo
farre from equitie, but that he is able to diſcerne of colours,
and will not requite me with wrong for right, I am ſure not
to be deceiued in my loue, I knowe he loueth me, but that he
dareth not to diſcloſe the ſame, fearyng I ſhould refuſe hym,
and caſt hym of with ſhame, I will not let therfore with myne

owne mouth to bewraie the ſame vnto hym, and to manifeſt
my good will, whereby my chaſt and honeſt amitie once knowen
vnto him, vertue her ſelf may knit the knot betweene vs,
whiche can not chuſe but bryng forthe the fruites of true and
perfect freendſhip.
               And ſhall I then beeyng a Ladie of ſuche degree, bee conſtrained
to ſewe, where euery other woman of the meaneſt reputation,
bee ordinarily required, and that with the importunate
inſtance of their ſuters, I ſhal then be noted of boldneſſe,
and bee thought to ſtraie too farre from the limites and boundes
of modeſtie, and to make a greater ſhow of lightneſſe, thē
is properly looked for in vs that be of the feminine gēder, but
what ſtrictneſſe is this preſcribed to our ſex, that we ſhould be
bereued of our libertie, and ſo abſolutely condemned of lightneſſe
in ſeeking to ſatiſfie our lawful and honeſt deſires, with
what trampe be we tempered withall more then men, whereby
wee ſhould bee able to withſtande the forces of the fleſhe, or
of power to reſiſt the concupiſcenſes whiche Nature it ſelf
hath aſſigned, we bee tearmed to be the weaker 
                     〈…〉
                  
yet thei would haue vs more puiſſaunt, then either Sampſon
or Hercules: If man and woman bee made of one mettall, it
muſt needes followe by conſequence, we be ſubiect to like infirmitie,
from whence commeth then this freedome, that men
maie aſke what thei deſire of vs, be it neuer ſo leude, and wee
maie not craue any thyng of them, that tendeth to good and
honeſt pretence: It is termed to be but a mans parte that ſeeketh
our diſhonour, by leude and lawleſſe luſt, but to a woman
it is imputed for lightneſſe, to firme her lawfull likyng, with
pure and loyall loue, if men will haue preheminence to doe euill,
why ſhould we be reproued for doyng well.
               Wherevpon ſtande I then amazed with theſe fonde opinions,
my loue is not vnlawfull, neither before God nor man, I
loue Siluanus, whom I will take for my houſbande, for otherwiſe
to loue hym, my harte doeth not intende, therefore without
any farther reſpite or delaie, I wil make my loue knowne
vnto him, and the band of Mariage once confirmed betweene
vs, ſhall couer the fault which men would deeme, neither ſhall

my mynd be altered, either by the ſugred perſwaſion of freendes,
neither terrified with any threates, that maie bee thundered
forthe by Parentes bluſteryng wrath, I am not ſo farre ouerwhelmed
with Pride, that in reſpect for the greatneſſe of
my Parentage, I ſhould deſpiſe a Gentleman indued more
with vertue then with riches, though there be ſome that be of
this condition, that thei will ſoner preferre the greatneſſe of
birth, then the greatneſſe of vertue, the aboundance of wealth,
then the aboundance of witte, the perfection of beautie, then
the perfection of the mynde, but I am out of the number of
thoſe women, whiche care more to haue their houſbands purſes
well lined with money, whereby thei maie be maintained
in their brauerie, or ſometymes fixe their fancie vppon ſome
yong man, that is of goodly perſonage, although voyd of vertue,
qualitie, and good conditions, that ought to garniſhe a
Gentleman, and doeth more beautifie and enriche hym, then
either the bare ſhewe of beautie, or any other giftes of Fortune,
but I cannot imploye my loue vpon tranſitory treaſure,
when the 
                     〈◊〉
                   of the mynde is cleane taken awaie: no no, it
ſhall better content me to ſee a meane Gentleman beloued
and praiſed of euery one for his vertues, then to marie amiſer
poſſeſſed with all the goodes of the worlde, hated and ill ſpoken
of for his vices, Feare not then Valeria, to followe thy determination,
and to put in proofe what thou haſt pretended.
               Here withall ſtaiyng her ſelf, ſhe beganne to practiſe the
meane, in what maner ſhe might bewray her loue to Siluanus,
ſeekyng for occaſion and tyme meete for her purpoſe, and although
there remained in her, a certaine naturall ſhamefaſtneſſe,
wherwith maidens are commonly accompained, which
for a tyme did cloſe her mouthe, and made her to deferre the
tyme of her deſolued mynd, yet in the ende throughly perſwaded
in her intent, ſhe ſent one of her Maidens, willyng Siluanus
to come and ſpeake with her; about certaine affaires that
ſhe had to imploye hym: The maide hauyng finiſhed her meſſage,
there could neuer more ioyfull newes happen to Siluanus,
who entryng the Chamber of Valeria, with tremblyng
harte after he had doen his reuerence, with greate feare and

baſhfulneſſe ſaied, for that I vnderſtande your Ladiſhip ha
                     ••
                  
to employe me about certaine affaires, I ſhall thinke my ſel
                     •
                  
the moſte happieſt man in the worlde, if my trauaile and diligence,
might any waies doe you ſeruice, bee it that 
                     •
                  erein I
ſhould offer or ſacrifice myne honour or life, crauyng no greater
benefite for the ſatiſfaction of all my contentations, receiued
in this world, then to ſerue, obey, and honour you, ſo long
as my life doeth laſt.
               The Ladie now, all rauiſhed with ioye and contentation,
perceiuyng by his chaunge of colour, the fault proceeded of
vehement loue, takyng hym aſide into a windowe, Loue had
ſo cloſed vp her mouth, that ſhe knew not how to beginne her
tale, her mynd was ſo troubled, her wits ſo farr out of courſe,
that her tongue failed to doe his office, in ſuche wiſe that ſhe
was not able to ſpeake one onely worde.
               He likewiſe perplexed with the like Feuer▪ was now aſtonied
to ſee the alteration of his Ladie.
               Thus theſe twoo Louers, like twoo ſenceleſſe Images,
ſtoode ſtill beholdyng eche other, without any maner of moouyng,
in the ende the Ladie takyng courage in her ſelf, with a
tremblyng voyce, ioyned with a maidenlike ſhamefaſtneſſe,
began to ſaie as followeth.
               Beyng aſſured (my Siluanus) of your diſcretion and wiſedome,
whiche Nature hath not onely indued you withall, but
art hath alſo accompliſhed, what Nature beganne to woorke,
I will therefore make no doubt at all, to lette you knowe the
hidden ſecretes of my harte, neither will I goe aboute with
circumſtaunce to colour my woordes, but being well perſwaded,
that when you ſhall bothe heare and ſauour my ſpeeches,
and therewithall ſound the deapth of my deuiſes, you will eaſily
coniecture, that my enterpriſes bee none other then iuſt,
and that my alledged reaſons, are groūded of good pretence,
I thinke ſithence your ariuall here in the Court of the Duke
my father, you haue not ſeene me in any behauiour, otherwiſe
then vertue doeth permitte, nor in any my demeanours exceedyng
the boundes of modeſtie, otherwiſe then becommeth a
maiden of my callyng, beyng deſcended of ſo worthie a 
                     〈◊〉
                  
                  
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   if this be a faulte that beyng prouoked by the pureneſſe of
my harte, and fidelitie of my good will, who to keepe the ſame
inuiolable, doe voluntarily offer my ſelf to the honeſt diſpoſition
of your iudgement, as it ſhall pleaſe you to conceiue of
me, I haue then committed a fault in liking you too well, but
I truſt nothyng at all offended God, who knoweth the innocencie
of my crime. Think not Siluanus, that I am the freend
of Fortune, and practiſe pleaſure alone without vertue, for it
is modeſtie that commaundeth me, and honeſtie is the guide
of my conceiptes, ſwearing and proteſting by the Almightie
God, that neuer man ſhall touche Valeria, except it be in Mariage,
and he that otherwiſe would aſſaile me, I haue a harte
that ſhall encourage my handes to ſacrifice my life. And now
Siluanus, if you will not thinke me more prodigall of my preſent,
then your fancie will ſerue you to take in good parte, beholde,
it is you that I haue choſen for my Spouſe and loyall
houſband. And although I had determined to diſſemble that,
whiche now I haue laied open vnto you, yet repoſing my ſelf
in your vertue and honeſtie, I truſt I ſhall not haue cauſe to
repent me, for any thyng that I haue either ſaied or doen.
               
                  Siluanus whiche all this while hearing this heauenly harmonie,
with full aſſuraunce of that he moſte wiſhed for, albeit
he ſawe no poſſibilitie, how to bryng to paſſe this deſired Mariage,
yet determined not to refuſe ſo greate a preferment, beyng
ſo franke and liberally offered, aunſwered in this maner.
               I knowe not Madame, with what humilitie and reuerence
I might receiue, and accept this your greate bountie and nobleneſſe,
ſo graciouſly offered vnto me, I do acknowledge my
condition and ſtate too baſe, and that my loue may be thought
to preſume too farre beyonde the boundes of order, conſideryng
that my ignobilitie and birth, are no meete matches for
ſuche a peereleſſe Princes, yet this I dare boldly affirme, that
if loue and entire affectiō borne to your Ladiſhip, might ſerue
to counteruaile that defect, whiche by place of birthe the Deſtinies
haue denaied me, I dare vndertake I ſhould as well
deſerue to bee receiued, as he that is lineally deſcended from
the greateſt Monarchie of the world. The whiche loue if till

this tyme I haue delaied to open, I beſeeche you Madame,
impute it to the greatneſſe of your eſtate, and to the duetie of
my callyng, but now for as muche as by your owne motion,
grace, courteſie, and greate liberalitie the ſame is profered,
and that of your owne bountie, it pleaſeth you to accept me
for yours: I humbly beſeeche you, not to diſpoſe of me as of a
houſbande, but as of one whiche both is, and ſhall be your ſeruaunt
for euer. Thus ſaied, he takyng her by the hande, kiſſed
it with greate deuotion, his tongue and wittes were ſo rapt
and tied, as the Ladie perfectly perceiued this alteration, and
ſeyng it to proceede of loue, replied on this maner.
               Then my Siluanus, there needeth at this preſent no farther
circumſtaunce, but for that I am well aſſured, there are ſome
that will be offended with my choice, but eſpecially the Duke
my father, who will conceiue ſome great diſpleaſure againſt
me: there reſteth then that this our contract bee kept very ſecrete,
vntill it pleaſe God to appoint the tyme, that the reſt of
our determinations, maie without daunger bee conſummate
and accompliſhed. In the meane tyme, truſtyng that your deſire
is Godly, and that the freendſhipp you pretende to beare
me, is founded vpon vertue, and to be concluded by Mariage,
receiue me for your Spouſe and lawfull wife, you ſhall haue
ſuche parte in me, as without any regarde to the obedience
and duetie that I owe to my Parentes I am yours, beeyng
readie and diſpoſed to obeye you, ſo farre as my honour maie
permit me.
               Theſe two louers now groundyng themſelues, the one in
the others fidelitie, could not ſo cūning▪ diſſemble and cloke
their affections, but that it was eaſily perceiued by their ſecret
glaunces, and countenaunces conueighed from the one to the
other (and as wee haue a Prouerbe) (it is ill haltyng before a
creeple) ſo there were many about the Court, that were ſo wel
ſtudied in the ſchoole of Loue, that thei were able to haue cō
                  menced
Maiſters of Arte, and could eaſily coniecture from
whence thoſe rowlyng lookes did proceed, that being now aſſured
of that whiche before was but ſuſpected, the brute was
ſpread about the Court, of the loue that was betweene Siluanus
                  
and Valeria, that in the ende it came to the Duke her Fathers
eare, who takyng the matter very greeuouſly, that his
daughter to whom the inheritance of the Dukedome remained
after his deceaſe, ſhould ſo meanely beſtowe her loue of a
fondlyng founde in the Woodes. And mindyng to finde a remedie
for the matter, willed Siluanus that in paine of his life,
within twentie daies he ſhould departe the Courte, and neuer
after to be ſeen within the iuriſdictions of the Dukedome of
Vaſconia.
               
               
                  Valeria now hauyng intelligence what had happened, had
no leaſure to vexe or moleſt her ſelf, when tyme rather required
a ſpeedie remedie, for the incounteryng of thoſe miſhaps,
deuiſed with Siiuanus to conueigh her ſelf awaie, contented
rather to liue in the fellowſhip of an honeſt louing houſband,
with whom ſhe ſhould hold faithful and loyal companie, with
what eſtate and Fortune ſo euer it might pleaſe GOD to appoincte,
then to liue without hym, beautified with the graces
and fooliſhe names of honour and preheminence.
               
                  Siluanus, contented to ſatiſfie her deſire, with the hazarde
of his life, yeelded to her requeſt, and before the twentie daies
were expired, ſo cleanely conueighed hym ſelf and Valeria awaie,
that when thei were miſſyng, the Duke wiſt not which
waies to ſende after them. Wherefore in a great furie, he ſpared
not to ſende out great companies, whiche poſtyng euery
waie, made enquirie and ſearche after them, but all in vaine:
for Siluanus had ſo diſguiſed hymſelf and Valeria, that without
any maner of trouble, thei quietly paſſed the Countrey,
and hauyng freede them ſelues from out the daunger of the
Duke, deſiring that the daie of their Mariage might now be
prefixed, the whiche by mutuall conſent, was preſently determined,
and by greate Fortune (or rather conduction by the
prouidence of God) the
                     •
                   happened to arriue in the Countrey
Village, where Duke Sappho y• was father to Siluanus, had
remained al this while Sexten of y• Pariſh. In this Village,
becauſe it was a place free from reſorte, whereby thei might
remaine vnknowne, and in the better ſafetie, thei purpoſed
aſwel to celebrate their Mariage, as for a tyme to make their

aboade, till matters were better quieted, and that thei migh
                     •
                  
at leiſure reſolue, what courſe were beſt for them to take. Siluanus
now hauyng conferred with the Prieſte, the Mariag
                     •
                  
daie was appoincted, where the poore Belringer takyng the
vewe of this newe maried couple, fell in a great likyng of Siluanus,
not for that he knewe him to be his ſonne, for thereof he
could haue no maner of ſuſpition, aſwell for that he deemed
he had been deuoured in the Woodes, by ſome wilde beaſt, as
alſo becauſe his name was chaunged, but whether it were by
the inſtigation or ſecreſie of Nature, or otherwiſe by the will
and pleaſure of God, to bring to paſſe that, which afterwards
happened in effect, this poore Sexten I ſay, lead by the ſecret
motion of his owne affections, proffered Siluanus that if his
ſeruice might any waies ſtande hym in ſteede (for that he was
a ſtraunger in the place) he ſhould vſe hym in any reſpect, and
ſhould finde hym readie to ſtande hym in ſuche ſteade, as his
poore abilitie might any waies permit.
               
                  Siluanus in like caſe hauing forgotten his Father, beeing
ſeparated from hym in his infancie, yet nothyng deſpiſing his
freendly offer, craued his helpe for the hieryng of a Chamber,
for ſome reaſonable rent, till tyme that he might better prouide
for hymſelf. The Sexten very glad that he had ſo good
oportunitie to pleaſure him, brought him with his wife to his
owne houſe, where he lodged hym in the beſt roome that he
had, profferyng not onely his houſe, but all that was in it to be
at their diſpoſition and pleaſure. This newe Married couple
now gladdyng and ſporting themſelues, with all ſuch ſweete
imbracementes, as thei can better deſcribe, whiche haue been
poſſeſſed with the like delightes: but as ſome wil ſaie, it is the
mans parte to bee firſt wearied in thoſe Venerall ſportes, ſo
Siluanus hauyng now well feaſted hymſelf, with that ſweete
repaſte, had leiſure to bethinke hym of his owne eſtate: began
inwardly to growe into great ſorrowe and heauineſſe, not ſo
muche for hymſelf, as for his wife, who for his ſake had diſpoſeſt
her ſelf from ſo greate honour, abandonyng her freendes,
contented to yeeld her ſelf a thrall to Fortune.
               Theſe cogitations did ſo nippe hym, that he could not ſo

well diſſemble his greef, but that his wife perceiued ſome diſquietneſſe
in his mynde, and therefore very greeuouſly ſhe demaunded
of hym, to ſhew her the cauſe of his diſcontentment,
whiche by outward appearaunce, ſeemed inwardly ſo muche
to moleſt hym.
               
                  Siluanus hearyng his Ladies requeſt, aunſwered in this
wiſe, my deare wife, the ſweeteſt companion that euer mā did
poſſeſſe, for ſo muche as you ſo earneſtly deſire to vnderſtand,
what it is that ſo much withdraweth my delightes, I will not
let to bewraie the truthe, whiche is this, when I conſider with
my ſelf, of your preſent eſtate and condition, who from the tip
and height of dignitie, haue not ſpared for my ſake to ſurrender
your ſelf, to become a ſubiect to all miſhaps, beſieged on euery
ſide, with the future aſſaultes of ordinarie Fortune: It
maketh me therefore to haue the greater care, by what meanes
I might endeuour my ſelf, to maintaine & continue your
eſtate, though not according to your worthineſſe and calling,
yet according to your wel contentment and liking. And herevpon
conceiuing in my head diuers imaginations, no meanes
but one in my fancie ſeemeth beſt, whiche is, that I goe to the
Court of the Emperour Claudius, who at this preſent is leading
a great bande, to encounter the Turke, at whoſe handes
I doubt not, but to receiue ſome good entertainment, and beſides
the honour and reputation, I maie gaine by good deſert,
I maie likewiſe reape ſuche liuyng and good likyng of the
Emperour, that in deſpight of Fortunes teeth, wee maie liue
hereafter a quiet and honourable life, to our greate ioye and
comforte. But when I did conſider the beloued companie of
you deare wife, I feared to bewraie that, whiche now I haue
diſcloſed, not knowyng in what parte you would take it, that
I ſhould ſo ſodainly departe. Loe here the cauſe of my diſquietneſſe,
whiche you deſire ſo inſtantly to knowe.
               The Ladie whiche was wiſe, perceiuyng the greate loue
that her houſbande did beare her, when he had ſtaied hym ſelf
from talke, with glad and merie countenaunce, aunſwered in
this wiſe.
               Ah Siluanus, the exampler of all vertue and gentleneſſe,

let death and fortune doe what thei liſt, for I coumpt my ſel
                     •
                  
more then ſatiſfied of all that is paſt, by the onely enioiyng of
your preſence, contentyng my ſelf to bee a partaker of your
miſfortunes, and haue no doubt but that I can ſo moderat my
affections, that duryng my life, I will reſt better contented
with that which your abilitie wil permit be it neuer ſo meane,
then otherwiſe to be honoured with names and titles of nobilitie
in Princely ſtate or porte hauing not your preſence. Diſquiet
not your ſelf therefore, but perſeuer in your determination,
and that ſorowe whiche ſhall aſſaile me by reaſon of your
abſence, I will ſweeten and lenefie with contentation to ſee
your commendable deſire appeaſed: and the pleaſaunt memorie
of your valiant factes ſhal beguile my penſiue thoughtes,
hoping that our next meetyng ſhall be more ioyfull and glad,
then this our partyng ſhall be either heauie or ſad.
               The Ladies aunſwere did wonderfully quiet the mynd of
Siluanus, and callyng his Hoſte the Sexten vnto hym, whom
he had made partaker of his determinations, he departed, leauyng
his wife ſuche money and Iewelles as thei had remainyng:
And commyng to the Courte of the Emperour Claudius,
he was very well entertained, and the rather for that the
Emperour had greate neede of men to ſupplie his Armie,
whiche had ſuſtained ſondrie conflictes, and diuers ouerthrowes,
for the Turke did wonderfully incroche vpon the Emperour,
and had taken ſondrie Cities, Tounes, and Caſtelles
from hym, and was like ſtill euery daie more to preuaile then
other, that now the Emperour beganne to repent him, of the
ſlender accoumpte he had made of Souldiours in the tyme of
peace, for that he had too few that were ſufficient to ſerue him
in his Warres: For in ſteede of Experience, Valiaunce, and
Policie (whiche three ought to be gouernours, commaunders
and cheef officers in a Campe) he was glad to preferre Vainglorie,
Fooliſhhardineſſe, and Raſhneſſe: Simple ſottes that
were more fitter to waite in Gentlewomans chambers, then
to be made Captaines, or leaders in the Warres.
               The Emperour now ſtandyng in greate diſtreſſe for want
of men, for thoſe that he had made greateſt accompt of in the

tyme of peace, were now able to ſtande him in no ſteede in the
tyme of warres: and thoſe that had braued it vp and doune the
Courte in the newe cuttes, ſtraunge faſhions, their haire fri
                  
                     ••
                  led,
lookyng with ſuche griſly and terrible countenaunces,
enough to make a wiſeman beleeue thei were cleane out of
their wittes, now in the tyme of Warres, were glad to runne
vnder a Gentlewomans Farthyng all to hide them.
               The Emperour (I ſaie) beeyng thus perplexed, called to
his remembraūce the iniurie that he had doen Sappho, whom
he had baniſhed onely to ſatiſfie the willes of thoſe that were
about him, whiche he knewe did hate him more of ſpight, then
for any occaſion the Duke had giuen. Without any farther
delaie therefore, the Emperour ſent ſondrie meſſengers into
euery parte of Chriſtendome to make inquirie, that who ſo euer
could finde the Duke, ſhould bee worthily recompenced,
and thoſe Proclamations were ſpread through euery Region,
in Citie, Towne, and Village. In ſo muche that in this Pariſhe
where the Duke remained Sexten (as you haue heard)
the Prieſt made inquirie on Sondaie in the Churche, as the
cuſtome is) that where as about fourteene or fifteene yeres ſithence,
the Duke of Mantona was baniſhed by the Emperor,
whiche was procured rather by enuie, then for any deſerte, as
now it was proued, who ſo euer therfore could giue any intelligence
of the ſame Duke, ſhould be very liberally recompenſed
by the Emperour.
               The Sexten now hearyng theſe newes, did thinke it more
better to liue ſtill in his Sextens roome, where he remained
without enuie, then to become againe the Duke of Mantona,
ſubiecte to the ſpite of hatefull perſones. But callyng to his
mynde his wife and daughter, which he thought remained yet
aliue (although he knewe not where) and for the greate loue
that he bare to Siluanus, whoſe wife remained in his houſe (as
you heard) ſeyng that Fortune offered him ſo good oportunitie
to pleaſure them, onely for their ſakes, reſolued hymſelf to
goe to the Emperour. But firſt comfortyng his geſt Valerya,
whom for a time he ſhould leaue in his houſe, onely with ſuche
ſeruauntes as her ſelf had about her: he tolde her that he was

well aſſured where to finde this Duke, that was ſo muche inquired
after, and that he doubted not, (if it were but in reſpect
of his good newes) he ſhould worke Siluanus, her houſbande
into ſome credite with the Duke, who might likewiſe procure
his better preferment with the Emperour.
               And thus the Sexten departed, and with all conuenience
came to the Courte of the Emperour, to whom when he had
made hymſelf knowne, he was moſt honourably receiued and
greate ioye and gladneſſe was made throughout the whole
Court: the Emperour now in conſideration of the iniurie he
had doen hym, did not onely reſtore hym to his former roome
and dignitie, but alſo aduaunced hym in honour and eſtimation,
to be preferred before all other next vnto hymſelf.
               Thus after many benefites receiued of the Emperour, the
Duke prepared hymſelf, accompanied with many his freendes,
to goe to the Emperours Campe, of the whiche he was
made Generall, where he knewe well how to behaue hymſelf,
and giuyng out new ordinaunces, he appointed certaine ſuch
as he hymſelf knewe worthie, and gaue them charge, amongeſt
the reſt, ſeeyng Siluanus who all this while remained in
the Campe, whom the Duke did very well knowe, although
Siluanus, did little ſuſpecte that a poore Sexten of a Pariſhe,
ſhould become a Generall to an Emperours Armie. The
Duke perceiuyng hymſelf to be vnknowne to Siluanus, was
cōtented ſo to remaine for a tyme, but yet deſirous to ſée what
was in hym, he gaue hym the leadyng of certaine Horſemen,
with the whiche Siluanus ſerued ſo valiauntly, and there with
all had ſo happie ſucceſſe, that euery man extolled vp to the
heauens, the worthineſſe of Siluanus. This pleaſed the Duke
paſſyng well, and the Duke hauyng now ſondrie tymes incountred
with the power of the Turkes, and had giuen them
many ouerthrowes, he was now preparyng a greate force,
for the recouerie of the Citie of Cayoe, the whiche the Turkes
had taken before from the Emperour. And callyng Siluanus
vnto hym, he ſaied: God graunt yong Gentleman, that
your ende agree with your good beginnyng, then makyng
Siluanus to kneele he dubbed hym knight, and made hym Colonell
                  
of twentie Enſignes.
               
                  Siluanus after he had dooen his reuerence, thanked the
Duke of the honour and fauour, whiche it had pleaſed hym to
dooe hym, promiſyng to dooe ſo well in tyme to come, as he
ſhould not bee deceiued in his conceiued opinion, whereof he
gaue aſſured teſtimonie at the aſſaulte that was giuen to the
Citie before mentioned, where he behaued hymſelf ſo valiantly,
as he was the firſt that mounted vppon the walles, and by
his dexteritie and inuincible force, made waie to the Souldiours
in the breach, whereby thei entered and tooke the Citie,
killyng and driuyng out their enemies before them. In many
ſuche like attemptes Siluanus ſtill ſhewed hym ſelf ſo noble
and valiaunt, that his praiſe and renowne was ſounded in euery
place.
               The Duke now hauing recouered againe al ſuche Cities,
Townes, and other Fortes, whiche the Turke had before taken
from the Emperour, and there with all had baniſhed the
Turkes from out the boundes, and borders of the Empire,
and a League agreed vppon betweene the Emperour and the
Turke. The Armie beeyng broken vp, and Souldiours diſcharched,
euery man well recompenſed for his ſeruice, accordyng
as he had deſerued. Siluanus likewiſe, who by his worthineſſe,
hauing not onely made himſelf famous to the world,
but alſo had well lined his purſe with good ſtore of golde, bethinkyng
hym now of his faire Ladie, came to the Duke to
haue takē his leaue, but the Duke mindyng now to performe
the good that he ment to Siluanus, was reſolued in his mynd,
that Siluanus with his wife ſhould bee his geſtes, as well at
Mantona where he was Duke, as thei had been before, where
he was but a Sexten, ſaied to Siluanus as followeth.
               Sir Knight, what haſt is this, that you would ſo ſodainly
withdrawe your ſelf from out my companie, belike you haue
ſome faire wife, to whom you make ſuche ſpeede to bee gone,
but ſir content your ſelf to beare me companie to the Emperours
Courte, where I doubte not but you ſhall receiue ſome
better recompence for your ſeruice ſo happely begunne, for it
is not requiſite, but that the vertue of valiaunce, ought to bee

rewarded and cheriſhed by Princes, that bee aided in their neceſſitie,
with the diligence of ſuche vertuous and noble Gentlemen
as your ſelf. Siluanus greatly cōforted with theſe w
                     •••
                  des
of the Duke, was well pleaſed to waite vpon hym. Thus
thei tooke their iourney towardes the greate Citie of Cherona,
whiche was in the vttermoſte borders of the Emperours
Dominions, there the Duke purpoſed to ſtaie a while, to recreate
hymſelf with the reſt of his companie.
               Now it fortuned that the valiaunt actes, and hautie enterpriſes
of Siluanus were ſo renowmed and ſpread, that the fame
therefore came to the eares of the Duke of Vaſconya, that
was father to Valerya the wife of Siluanus, who with all poſſible
ſpeede made ſuche haſte, that he came to Cherona, where
he found Siluanus in the companie of the Duke of Mantona,
to whom turnyng hymſelf, he ſaied as followeth.
               Sir Duke, the onely hope that I haue, that you will not
let to extende Iuſtice vpon the miſcheeuous and vngracious
actes of wicked men, doeth let me at this inſtaunt to forbeare
with myne owne handes, to auenge the wrong that I aſſure
my ſelf, to haue receiued of this Traitour Siluanus.
               
               The companie were wonderfully abaſhed with theſe wordes,
but eſpecially the Duke of Mantona, who loued Siluanus
more dearely then any other.
               But the other goyng ſtill forwardes in his tale ſaied, if the
harte breake that afflicteth the ſoule of a wofull father, whoſe
houſe is made deſolate by looſyng his childe, by the miſcheeuous
inticementes of a Theefe, if this preſident I ſaie, moue
you not to miniſter ſuche ſpeedie reuenge, as the Lawe doeth
preſcribe, I ſuppoſe that all impunitie of vice and ſinne hath
place on your behalf. And there withall ſtaiyng his talke, but
yet by his geſture and countenaunce ſo inraged, that he ſeemed
like a man that were beſides hymſelf.
               The Duke of Mantona now perceiuyng the matter, that
Valerya was the daughter of the Duke of Vaſconia, whom
he ſuppoſed to haue been of ſome meane birth and parentage,
was wonderfully ſorie for Siluanus, whoſe fact by the Lawe
deſerued death, and ſeyng the Duke in ſuche a furie, he wiſte

not by what meanes to worke Siluanus ſafetie, for to intreate
the Duke he thought it but vaine, and to bryng Siluanus to
aunſwere the fact, he knewe the Lawe would condemne him,
and therefore knowyng where Valeria did remaine, whom
he knewe did loue Siluanus as her owne life, and thinkyng
that her teares might lenifie and ſoften the hardened harte of
the Duke her father. He therefore priuely ſent for her, to bee
brought immediatly to the Citie of Cherona, in the meane
tyme he committed Siluanus into ſafe cuſtodie, and deſired
the Duke at his requeſt to ſtaie himſelf a while, and he ſhould
haue ſuche Iuſtice on Siluanus, as hymſelf would require.
               Matters beeyng thus pacified for a while, I will in like
caſe let them reſt for a time, and will now diſcourſe how it befell
to the Ducheſſe Meſſilina, with her daughter Phylene.
               
               You haue heard before how by conſtraint of weather at the
Sea, thei were driuen to this Citie of Cherona, where the
Duke now remained, and at her firſt comming, fallyng to her
woorke as before ſhe had doen at Taryffa, a riche Marchaunt
that dwelt in the Towne, takyng the vewe of this new come
workewoman, fell into ſo great a likyng with her, that onely
to haue acceſſe to come into her companie, he beſtowed more
money in cloath to make hym Shirtes and Handcarchifes in
one weeke, then he was able to weare out in three yeares after,
whiche he put to her to make, whereby he became ſomething
well acquainted with her, but to the ende that ſhe might
thinke her ſelf ſomethyng the better beholdyng vnto hym, he
proffered her a more conuenient houſe then that ſhe was in,
whiche he would furniſhe with all maner of houſholde ſtuffe
for a reaſonable rent. She beeyng very glad of ſo good an offer,
became his Tenaunt. The Marchaunt now perceiuyng
his tyme did ſo well ſerue hym, without any greate circumſtaunce,
declared vnto her the great good will he bare her, but
Meſſilina ſo delaied hym with ſuche wiſe and reaſonable aunſwers,
that from tyme to tyme the Marchaunt hymſelf could
not importunatly craue that whiche with ſuche modeſtie, ſhe
ſo honeſtly denaied hym.
               Now there laie in this Citie of Cherona, the old Dutches

of Petrona, who hauing inteligence of Meſſilina to be ſo good
a workewoman, ſhe ſent for her, to whom ſhe put ſondrie parcelles
of worke, whiche ſhe ſo well finiſhed to the liking of the
Dutches, that from tyme to tyme ſhe ſtill plide her with the
like, whereby Meſſilina, with her daughter Phylene, had continuall
recourſe to the Pallas of the Dutches, where Arabianus
the onely ſonne of the Dutches of Petrona, (and inheritour
of the Dukedome, but that he was vnder age) did marke
and beholde the beautie and good grace of this yong Seameſter
Phylene, was ſo clogged and fettered in the bandes of
loue, that all other thoughtes ſeemed lothſome vnto hym, and
euery other ioye diſpleaſaunt, in reſpect of the pleaſure that
he ſuffered, by thinkyng of his faire Phylene, wherefore baityng
himſelf with hope, and tickled onely by loue, he determined
what ſoeuer happened to loue her.
               Whiche beeyng perceiued by his Mother, ſhe began very
ſharpely to rate hym, blamyng hym that would ſo indiſcretly
place his loue, not waiyng his eſtate and birthe, as come of
Princely race, and now would make hym ſelf a fable to the
worlde, to like of ſuche a one ſo farre vnworthie his degree.
               
                  Arabianus fallyng doune vppon his knees, moſte humbly
deſired his Mother to beare with all that was paſte, and although
it were truth that ſhe had ſaied, that he deemed her for
her birthe to bee vnworthie his degree, yet ſhe deſerued for her
beautie to bee compared to the greateſt Dame, and braueſt
Minion els where. And whereas other girles by artificiall
meanes and trumperies, doe inforce that whiche the heauens
haue denaied them, yet Phylene had no other ornament then
that whiche Nature had inlarged in her: and otherwiſe for her
vertue, wiſedome, and modeſtie, he knewe it to be ſuche by reporte
of many, as ſhe might bee a Lanterne to the greateſt
Dame that liued.
               Notwithſtandyng Madame, for ſo muche as you doe take
my facte in ſo ill parte, conſideryng the reuerence, that I owe
to the place whiche you holde on my behalfe, and the duetie
and obedience that God will and hath commaunded, that children
ſhould beare to thoſe that haue begotten and borne them:

if it pleaſe you to pardon me of this that is paſt, I proteſt that
from henceforth, I will be more wiſe and better aduiſed, how
I enter into any thyng that might turne to any ſuche conſequence,
or any maner of waies to offende you.
               The Dutches knowyng all to bee true that her ſonne had
ſaied, very well pleaſed with his ſpeeches, remained ſatiſfied,
thinkyng in her mynde in deede, that if Phylene had bin the
Daughter but of ſome meane Gentleman, her ſonne ſhould
neuer haue ſought farther for a wife.
               From this tyme forwards, although Arabianus by the perſwaſion
of his Mother, had vowed to reuolt and let ſlippe the
loue that he bare to Phylene, yet he could not ſo clearely looſe
his likyng, but that he did manifeſt ſome part of his good wil,
by giftes and good countenaunces whiche ſtill he beſtowed
vpon Phylene, cauſing his Mother likewiſe to beſtowe many
liberall rewardes vppon Meſſilina, thus the Mother and the
Daughter perceiued them ſelues a thouſande tymes beholdyng
to the olde Dutches and her ſonne.
               In this meane ſpace the Marchaunt before mentioned had
buried his wife, and knowyng no other but that M
                        •
                     ſſilina his
Tenaunt had been a widowe, he began now a freſhe ſute, and
with greate importunitie requeſted her in the waie of Mariage,
and ſo hardly he laied vnto her, that Meſſilina not knowyng
otherwiſe how to rid hym, co
                     •
                  feſſed vnto hym that ſhe
had a houſbande aliue and therefore might not marie.
               The Marchaunt thinkyng theſe to be but delaies to ſhift
hym of, came to this point, that if hereafter he could proue her
by her owne confeſſion to bee a widowe, that then before witneſſe
ſhe would take hym for her lawfull houſbande, and till
that tyme he would no farther trouble her till he had made his
proofe, ſhe beeyng glad to bee at reſt, thinkyng that he ſhould
woorke very wiſely to make her confeſſe her ſelf to bee a widowe,
agreed to his requeſt, and witneſſe was had in the matter.
The Marchaunt now lettyng his matter reſt a tyme for
his better purpoſe, in the ende comming vnto her, he told her,
that although ſhe were ſo diſcourteous to forſake his freendſhippe
in euery reſpect, firſt in the waie of good fellowſhippe,

and after in the waie of Marriage, whereby he was driuen to
goe ſeeke farther, but now hauyng found a wife in the Countrey,
to whom he was aſſured, and ment preſently to bee married,
yet for the old freendſhippe that he bare her, conſideryng
that he would preſently remaine in the Countrie altogether,
and forſake the Citie, therefore for her better ſecuritie, and aſſuraunce
of her dwellyng, he would make her a Leaſe of the
houſe that ſhe dwelt in, for one and twentie yeres, if it might
doe her any pleaſure, without paiyng any penie Income.
               
                  Meſſilina giuyng hym greate thankes, tooke his offer verie
courteouſly, and the Leaſe was put to making, whiche the
Marchaunt ſigned and deliuered, and herewithall deſired her
ſingle Obligation, for the performaunce of ſome ſmall rente,
were it neuer ſo little, that ſhe might acknowledge hym to be
her Landlorde, the whiche ſhe neuer denaied to giue.
               The Obligation was made in this maner, Knowe all mē
by theſe preſentes, that I Meſſilina Widowe, and ſo forthe,
with wordes in maner and forme of euery Obligation. This
Obligation thus made, was ſigned and deliuered by Meſsilina
to the Marchaunte, who had now gotten that ſo long he
had ſought for, and by vertue of this Obligation, craued Meſſilina
to bee his wife, ſhe denaiyng his demaunde, but what
could that preuaile, when he had her owne hande and ſeale to
ſhewe, whereby ſhe confeſſed her ſelf a Widowe, and then by
her owne agrement (as you haue heard before) ſhe muſt yeeld
her ſelf to be his wife.
               This matter was long in fendyng & prouyng, in ſo muche
that the Duke beyng now in the Toune, miniſteryng of Iuſtice
to ſuche as would craue it, the Marchaunte brought the
matter before the Duke, who hearyng the maner of the Bargaine,
and ſo many witneſſes to affirme the ſame, gaue Sentence
that the Marchaunte ought in deede to haue her. But
Meſsilina fallyng at the feete of the Duke, deſiring him with
teares to deferre his Iudgement: the Duke now takyng better
vewe of the woman, knowyng her bothe by her voice, and
alſo by lookyng well on her face, perceiued aſſuredlie that it
was his owne wife, he called againe to the Marchaunt to ſee

obligation, whiche whē he had receiued, he ſaid in this maner.
               Maiſter Marchaunt, this obligation whiche you haue deliuered
me, now I haue peruſed with better aduiſe, I finde it
to bee neither ſufficient nor lawfull, for this woman that you
would make a Widowe, without doubt is Married, and hath
a houſebande, now ſhe beeyng vnder couert barne, you Obligation
is vnpleadable, and I knowe not whom you ſhould
blame, whether your ſelf, or the Scriuener. And here withall
beyng replete with great ioye and gladneſſe, taking his wife
vp in his armes, verie louinglie imbraced her, he ſaied.
               Ah my deare and louing Wife, how muche am I bounde,
to render innumerable thankes to the almightie GOD, that
when all hope was paſte, haue yet againe recouered my greateſt
hope and comfort. Meſsilina likewiſe perceiuyng her lord
and houſebande, claſping her handes aboute his necke, was
not able to ſpeake a woorde for ioye and contentation: The
companie that ſtoode by, amazed to ſee this ſodaine happe,
were likewiſe verie ioyfull to ſee this freendly meeting. The
Marchaunt ſeeyng how he had been deceiued, tare his Obligation,
and departed all aſhamed. The Duke now deſirous
to ſee his Daughter Philene, cauſed her Mother to ſende for
her, who not knowyng her Father, otherwiſe then by report,
fell doune on her knees to craue his bleſſyng: The Duke taking
her vp, kiſſing her with Fatherlie affectiou, could not
ſtay his teares, in remembring her brother Aurelianus, whom
he deemed to be dedde.
               Theſe newes were ſodainly ſpred throughout the Citie of
Cherona, in ſo muche that Arabianus hauyng now intelligēce,
that Philene was the daughter of the noble Duke Sappho,
certifiyng his Mother the truthe whiche he had learned,
without any greate deliberation, bothe the Mother and the
ſonne, comming to viſite the Duke and his companie, where
thei were verie well welcomed, but eſpecially to Meſsilina, to
whom the old Duches and her Soonne, bothe had been verie
bountifull: And when a while thei had paſſed the tyme with
pleaſaunt diſcourſes of all that had paſſed, the Duches of Petrona
craued Philene in Marriage for her Sonne. The duke

beyng made priuie to the matter, knowyng Arabianus to bee
come of greate diſcent, and to bee indued with large and faire
poſſeſſions, ſeyng hym likewiſe to bee a toward yong Gentlemanne,
would not ſtande againſt it, but referred the matter to
his Daughters likyng. Philene who had been greatly bound
to the courteſie of the yong Duke, and had receiued many giftes
and good turnes at his handes, would not do as a nomber
of theſe niſe Dames, that will many tymes make daintie of
that thei would faineſt come by, gaue her free conſent. There
was then no more to dooe, but to prepare for the Marriage,
whiche was preſently ſolemnized with great pompe & glory.
               By this Valeria (whom as you haue heard before, the duke
had ſent for) was come to Cherona, who was priuely lodged
by the Dukes commaundemente, in a priuie place. The daie
now beyng come, that Siluanus was brought to his anſwere,
he could not denaie the facte wherewith he was charged, but
that he had ſtolne Valeria from her father, by whiche confeſſiō
the Lawe condemned hym to dye. There were many that
knewe the nobleneſſe of Siluanus, that began to entreat the
Duke or Vaſconia to remitt the facte, but all in vaine, for the
more thei entreated, the more he haſtened to ſee execution.
               The Duke of Mantona ſeeyng his greate obſtinacie, did
thinke it hye tyme to finde a remedie for Siluanus, if it might
bee, therefore he ſaied, ſir Duke, were it poſſible that this condemned
manne, who is like (ſo farre as I can ſee) to beare the
whole brunte, and yet might bee enticed to this facte by your
Daughters meanes, or at the leaſt, your daughter muſte bee
halfe partner of this fault, and yeelded with her good will to
come awaie, for otherwiſe it had been unpoſſible for hym, to
haue brought her from out your Courte, whiche if it bee true,
if you will needes ſee Iuſtice ſo duely executed in the one, I
can not ſee how your daughter can goe quite, but muſt bee as
well partaker of the puniſhement, as ſhe was in the facte, by
yeeldyng her conſent.
               The Duke of Vaſconia aunſwered, as it is the office and
duetie of euery good Iuſticer, to knowe the valour and difference,
betweene vertue and vice, to the ende that all vertuous

actes maie be honoured, and the contrarie chaſtiſed and puniſhed:
Otherwiſe he is not worthie the name of a righteous
Iudge, but of a cruell and traiterous Tiraunt, wherefore ſir
Duke, you ſittyng here in the place of Iuſtice, to miniſter equitie
and right, to euery one that calleth. Then I deſire that
I maie haue the Lawe extended vpon this wretche Siluanus,
as for my daughter that you ſpeake of, as I knowe not where
ſhe is, ſo I doe not deſire to learne what is become of her, but
this I proteſt, that if euer I maie finde her, rather then ſhe
ſhould eſcape vnpuniſhed, I will not let with mine owne handes,
to do execution vpon her, according to her demerites, and
the filthineſſe of her fact: from henceforthe denouncing her to
be any childe of mine, and make no better accoumpt of her, otherwiſe
then to be a filthie ſtrompet, vnworthie of me her father,
or to chalenge her deſcent from ſuche a ſtocke.
               The Duke of Mantona was now troubled worſe then before,
for where as he had ſome hope, that the humble ſute of
Valeria, ſhould ſomething haue moued her father to compaſſion,

                     〈◊〉
                   thought that her ſight, would rather increaſe his
rage and furie: Againe he thought, that to bring her into his
preſence, if he continued in one moode, he might woorke Valeria
ſo greate preiudice, as hee would be hartelie ſorie to ſee.
Yet thinking with himſelf, that it was impoſſible, that a Father
ſhould bee voide of good Nature, to ſee the vtter ruine of
his childe without any remorſe: He cauſed Valeria to bee ſent
for, who beyng conducted to the place, ſeyng her Father and
the reſte of the companie, ſhe beganne to coniecture that all
was not well. But when Siluanus ſawe his Valeria, wondering
by what meanes ſhe was brought to ſo euill a banquett,
remembryng what wordes her father before had proteſted, ſhe
began with a piteous voice to crie out.
               O my deare beloued wife, the onelie cauſe of my ioye and
quiet, what euill Fortune hath conducted thee to this place,
what froward Faates haue forced thee, that thou ſhouldeſt be
made companion of my miſhappes. O fraile and inconſtaunt
Fortune, how haſt thou fronted my honeſt deſires, with ſuche
crooked ſpight, that where I couet the countenance of greateſt

credite, there I am forced to hazard the loſſe of life and alwhat
crooked aſpecte hath gouerned my proceadinges, that
the hoped time I ſpente in this Warlike ſeruice, ſhould thus
conclude with his contrarie, and I forced as it were by Faate
to followe the vnhappie euent of the ſame, wherein I doe confeſſe
my Predeſtinate follies. But ſuche are the ſo
                     •
                  derie dealinges
of this life, as thoſe that tende their ſteppes to monſterous
mountaines, doe ſometime ſcarce conclude with meane
Moole hilles, the ſondrie conflictes of Fortune, maſking my
hope with a ſhewe of happie rewarde, hath not onelie wracked
me, but it threateneth the ſequell of worſe ſucceſſe: That inſtead
of happie and quiet life, my daies ſhalbee a bridged with
moſte ſhamefull and vile Death. O Valeria, Valeria, the ioye
and comfort of my life, I ſhall no more ſee that incomparable
beautie of thine, whiche darkeneth and obſerueth the Raies
and Beames of the Sunne.
               Then tourning himſelf to the Duke of Vaſconia, he ſaied,
I moſte humblie beſeeche your Grace, to haue compaſſion vpon
me, not for that I would conſume my life in your diſpleaſure,
I make offer of the ſame to your mercifull will and diſpoſition,
chooſing rather to die, and to leaue your Grace ſatiſfied
and contented, then to liue a happie life, your Princelie
minde diſpleaſed, and albeit, the right good intent, and vnſtained
conſcience is free from faulte, yet the iudgement of men
hath farther relation, to the exteriour apperance, then to vertues
force. Is it a ſinne to Marrie? Is it a faulte to flie and auoide
the ſinne of Whoredome? What Lawes bee theſe then,
where the Marriage bed and ioyned Matrimonie, is purſued
with like ſeueritie, as Murther, Thefte, Adultrie. But ſeyng
the fault of this miſhap, to a riſe by my predeſtinate euill luck
I moſte humblie beſeeche you, to mitigate your rage, and to
conceiue no ſiniſter opinion of this your worthie daughter,
whoſe ſmalleſt greef, is my double paine: as for my ſelf I am
well pleaſed with my miſfortune, contented to Sacrifice my
life, onelie to receiue your cleare acquitaunce for my offence,
and will make ſatiſfaction with the price of my blood.
               The Duke of Vaſconia bending his browes, aunſwered:

No Traitour no, it is not thy life that ſhall appeaſe my furie,
but I will ſo coole the Whoriſhe heate of your Minion, for
whom you ſeeme ſo muche to pleade, that I will make her an
example to all others, for dooyng of an acte ſo deteſtable. But
what abuſe haue thei committed, vnder the title of Marriage,
thinkyng without remorſe of conſcience, by that meanes to
continue their miſcheef, and their promiſe and faithe, that was
made vnder a Buſhe, muſte ſerue for a cloake and Viſarde for
their moſte filthie Whoredome. But what if their Marriage
were concluded, and confirmed by God hymſelf? Is Siluanus
a manne worthie to be alied, or mingled with the roiall blood
of the houſe of Vaſconia, no, no, I vowe I will neuer take
ſounde nor reſtfull ſleepe, vntill I haue diſpatched, that infamous
facte from our blood, and that villaine Whoremonger
with his trull, be vſed accordyng to their deſertes.
               
                  Valeria now knowyng how matters were ſorted out, and
hearyng this cruell Sentence, pronounced by her Father, fel
doune vpon her knees, and bitterly criyng out, ſhe ſaied: My
deare father, moſte humblie I beſeche yon, ſith no other thing
maie appeaſe your ire, then the life of the offender, let not this
Gentleman abide the penaunce of that, whiche he neuer committed,
be reuenged on me, by whom the faulte (if a womans
faithe to her houſebande, maie be termed a fault) is doen. And
let this infortunate Gentleman depart, who God knowes is
innocente of any other crime, then what he was brought into,
onely by my prouocation. And as ſhe was aboute to haue proceded
farther in her talke, her Father interrupted her, ſaiyng.
               Haue you founde your tongue now pretiepeate, then wee
muſt haue an Almon for Parrat: how durſt thou Strompette
chalenge me to bee thy Father? That without regard, either
of my renowme, or of the honour of my houſe, thou art content
to bee abandoned from this noble Eſtate, and to become
a Fugitiue and a ſtraunger, to followe a Roge vp and doune
the Countrey, no Minion no, thinke not that any Feminine

                     •
                  latterie, ſhall ſtay me from doyng thee to death, nor your darlyng
that ſtandes by you, ſhall eſcape with his life, verelie beleeuyng,
that in tyme it ſhall bee knowne, what profite the

worlde ſhall gaine, by purgyng the ſame of ſuche an infecte
                     •
                  
plague: and I do hope beſides this, that in tyme to come, men
ſhall praiſe this deede of myne, who for preſeruyng the honor
of my houſe, haue choſen rather to do to death twoo offenders
then to leaue the one of them aliue, as leſſe faultie or giltleſſe
then the other.
               
                  Valeria once againe fallyng fruſtrate before her Father,
ſaied: I moſte humblie beſeche you, for that all other comfort
is denaied me, that I maie craue this onely grace at your handes,
for the laſte good that euer I hope to receiue, whiche is,
that you beeyng thus greeuouſlie offended with me, doe vengeaunce
at your pleaſure vpon her, who willinglie yeeldeth
her ſelf to the Death, with the effuſion of her blood, to ſatiſfie
your ire, graunt onely that Siluanus, who is innocent and free
from fault, maie goe quite.
               But her father no longer able for anger to heare her ſpeak,
crieth out to the Duke, to haſten the execution, the Duke of
Mantona, whoſe harte did bleede in his beallie for ſorrowe,
perceiuyng it follie to delaye longer tyme, gaue Sentence of
death, and preſent execution to be made, although he tooke ſo
greate ſorrowe for theim, as if his Daughter Philene ſhould
haue borne them companie: but he was not able to help it, the
lawes and ordinaunces of the Countrie would not otherwiſe
permitt. And thinking to take his laſte farewell of Siluanus,
he ſaied: O Siluanus, the glorie and honor of all yong Gentlemen
that euer wer, that be now, or ſhalbe hereafter this, whoſe
vertue, valliaunce, and worthie exploites, doe gliſter emongſt
the multitude, as the Sunne beames doe vpon the cirquet of
the Yearth. Oh that thy hard Fortune ſhould conduct thee to
ſuche diſtreſſe, that onelie by thine owne valiaunce and proweſſe,
haſte eſcaped ſo many daungers, emongſt thy thronged
enemies, and now thy ruine and ouerthrowe, ſhould bee thus
wrought, amiddeſt thy aſſured freendes, that knowes not how
to helpe it. What heapes of cares hath beſieged me on euerie
ſide? To thinke that I ſhould craue thy companie, whereby
thou art brought into the middeſt of ſo great miſcheef, whiche
otherwiſe mighteſt haue eſcaped this miſhappe: and thou Valeria
                  
would God thy vnfortunate hoſte, whiche departed from
thee, thinking to doe thy houſebande pleaſure, had remained
with thee a poore Sexten ſtill, till this preſent daie.
               The reſt of the companie that ſtoode by, hearyng the duke
to make ſo greate lamentation, was likewiſe ſtriken into a
meruailous greef and ſorowe, in ſo muche that euery one that
durſte ſpeake, cried to the Duke of Vaſconia for pardon, and
that he would remitt the offence, and what pitie it were, if he
ſhould ſeeke the death of ſo noble a Gentleman, as Siluanus
had ſhewed hym ſelf to be: But the Duke perſeueryng ſtill in
one minde, aſked thē, with what face thei could make requeſt
for a verlet of no reputation, whom he had found in the wooddes,
and brought hym vp to that eſtate he was come to, not
knowyng who was his Father, but by ſeemyng ſome poore
Countrie Cloune, and forgettyng himſelf from whence he
ſprong, neglecting ſo many benefites, which he had beſtowed
vpon hym, would enter into thoſe thinges, ſo farre vnſeemely
and exceading his degree.
               The Duke of Mantona, giuing good eare to this tale, remembring
his Sonne Aurelianus, whom he had luſte in the
Woodes aboute thoſe partes, queſtioned with the Duke, of
the time, and what apparell the childe had on at that preſent,
who in all thinges ſhewed a trothe as it was: He demaunded
farther, how he knewe his name to be Siluanus, or whether he
had any other name, yes (quoth the Duke of Vaſconia) his
name he ſaied was Aurelianus, whiche my ſelf changed to Siluanus,
becauſe I founde him in the Woodes.
               Herewithall without any farther ſtaie, the Duke of Mantona
running haſtely vpon Siluanus, imbraſyng him in his armes,
criyng: O my ſonne, my ſonne, and with this ſodain ioy,
the teares trickling doune his cheekes ſo faſte, that he was
not farther able to ſpeake one worde.
               The Duke of Vaſconia muche amazed to ſee this ſight,
but a greate deale more gladde, that Siluanus had founde out
ſuche a father, and now nothing at al offended with his daughters
choice, came likewiſe with chearfull countenaunce, and
imbraſed Siluanus, deſiring dothe the Duke his Father, and

hymſelf to forgiue what was paſt, and takyng Valerya by the
hande, he deliuered her to Siluanus, promiſyng hym for her
dowrie 40000. Franckes in golde preſently to bee paied, and
after his deſceaſe to remaine for his inheritour.
               
                  Siluanus better pleaſed with Valeria her ſelf, then with all
the reſt that was promiſed, gaue hym greate thankes, and ſo
did the Duke his father.
               All the companie were repleniſhed with the greateſt ioye
that might be, to ſee this ſodaine ſight, and thus thei departed
to the Pallas where the Duke kept his abode, where Siluanus
was welcomed, to his mother, to his ſiſter, to Arabianus,
and to all the reſt, where there was greate feaſtyng and triumphe,
and a bonde of euerlaſtyng amitie betweene the houſes
of the Duke of Mantona, the Duke of Vaſconya, and the
Duke of Petrona, and after a while thei had feaſted and ſported
them ſelues, thei rode altogether in companie to the Emperours
Courte, who receiued them with ſo greate honour as
he could deuiſe, and making himſelf a partaker of their mirth,
wonderyng to here the hole diſcourſe how thynges had happened,
when after a while he had feaſted them, and ſhewed
them as greate pleaſures as might be deuiſed, he beſtowed of
them all large and bountifull giftes, but eſpecially of the
two yong Ladies Valerya and Phylene, and this agreeing
amongeſt themſelues, to meete once a
yeare at the leaſt to ſporte and make them
ſelues merrie, for this ſeaſon thei
departed, euery one where it
liked them beſte.
            
            
               
               Of Apolonius and Silla.
               
                  The Argument of the ſecond Historie.
                  ¶Apolonius Duke hauing ſpent a yeares ſeruice in the
warres againſt the Turke, returning homeward with
his companie by Sea, was driuen by force of weather
to the Ile of Cypres, where he was well receiued by
Pontus Gouernour of the ſame Ile, with whom Silla
daughter to Pontus, fell ſo ſtraungely in loue, that after
Apolonius was departed to Constantinople, Silla
with one man followed, and commyng to Constantinople,
ſhe ſerued Apolonius, in the habite of a man,
and after many pretie accidentes fallyng out, ſhe was
knowne to Apolonius, who in requitall of her loue
maried her.
               
               
                  THere is no child that is borne in to
this wretched worlde▪ but before
it doeth ſucke the mothers milke,
it taketh firſt a ſoope of the Cupp
of errour, which maketh vs when
we come to riper yeres, not onely
to enter into actiōs of iniurie, but
many tymes to ſtraie from that is
right and reaſon, but in all other
thynges, wherein wee ſhewe our ſelues to bee moſte dronken
with this poiſoned Cuppe, it is in our actions of Loue, for the
Louer is ſo eſtraunged from that is right, and wandereth ſo
wide from the boundes of reaſon, that he is not able to deeme
white from blacke, good from bad, vertue from vice: but onely
led by the appetite of his owne affections, and groundyng
them on the fooliſhneſſe of his owne fancies, will ſo ſettle his
likyng, on ſuche a one, as either by deſerte or vnworthineſſe,

will merite rather to be loathed then loued.
               If a queſtion might be aſked, what is the ground in deede
of reaſonable loue, whereby the knot is knit, of true and perfect
freendſhip? I thinke thoſe that be wi
                     •
                  e would aunſwere:
Deſerte, that is, where the partie beloued, dooeth requite vs
with the like, for otherwiſe, if the bare ſhewe of beautie, or the
comelineſſe of perſonage, might bee ſufficient to confirme vs
in our loue. Thoſe that bee accuſtomed to go
                     •
                   to Faires and
Markettes, might ſometymes fall into loue with twentie in
a daie: Deſerte muſt then bee (of force) the grounde of reaſonable
loue, for to loue them that hate vs, to followe them that
flie from vs, to faue on them that froune on vs, to currie fauour
with them that diſdaine vs, to bee glad to pleaſe them
that care not how thei offende vs: who will not confeſſe this
to be an erronious loue, neither grounded vpon witte nor reaſon.
Wherefore right curteous Gentlewomen, if it pleaſe you
with pacience to peruſe this Hiſtorie followyng, you ſhall ſee
Dame Errour ſo plaie her parte, with a Leiſhe of Louers a
Male and twoo Females, as ſhall woorke a wonder to your
wiſe iudgement, in notyng the effect of their amourous deuiſes
and concluſions of their actions. The firſt neclectyng the
loue of a noble Dame, yong, beautifull, and faire, (who onely
for his good will, plaied the parte of a Seruyng man, contented
to abide any maner of paine onely to beholde hym. He againe
ſettyng his loue of a Dame that deſpiſing hym, (being
a noble Duke) gaue her ſelf to a Seruyng man (as ſhe had
thought) but it otherwiſe fell out, as the ſubſtance of this tale
ſhall better diſcribe. And becauſe I haue been ſomethyng tedious
in my firſt diſcourſe, offending your pacient eares, with
the hearing of a circumſtaunce ouer long. From hence forth,
that whiche I minde to write, ſhall be doen with ſuche celericie,
as the matter that I pretende to penne, maie in any wiſe
permit me, and thus followeth the Hiſtorie.
               During the tyme that the famous Citie of Conſtantinople,
remained in the handes of the Chriſtians, amongſt many
other noble men, that kepte their abidyng in that floriſhyng
Citie, there was one whoſe name was Apolonius, a worthie

Duke, who beyng but a very yong man, and euen then newe
come to his poſſeſſions whiche were very greate, leuied a
mightie band of men, at his owne proper charges, with whom
he ſerued againſt the Turke, duryng the ſpace of one whole
yeare, in whiche tyme although it were very ſhorte, this yong
Duke ſo behaued hymſelf, as well by proweſſe and valiaunce
ſhewed with his owne handes, as otherwiſe, by his wiſedome
and liberalitie
                     •
                   vſed towardes his Souldiours, that all the
worlde was filled with the fame of this noble Duke. When
he had thus ſpent one yeares ſeruice, he cauſed his Trompet
to ſounde a retraite, and gatheryng his companie together,
and imbarkyng themſelues he ſet ſaile, holdyng his courſe towardes
Conſtantinople: but beeyng vpon the Sea, by the extreamitie
of a Tempeſt whiche ſodainely fell, his fleete was
deſerued ſome one waie, and ſome an other, but he hymſelf recouered
the Ile of Cypres, where he was worthily receiued
by Pontus Duke and gouernour of the ſame Ile, with whom
he lodged, while his Shippes were newe repairyng.
               This Pontus that was Lorde and Gouernour of this famous
Ile, was an auncient Duke, & had two children, a ſonne
and a daughter, his ſonne was named Siluio, of whom hereafter
we ſhall haue further occaſion to ſpeak, but at this inſtant
he was in the partes of Africa, ſeruyng in the Warres.
               The Daughter her name was Silla, whoſe beautie was ſo
pereleſſe, that ſhe had the ſoueraintie amongeſt all other Dames,
aſwell for her beautie as for the nobleneſſe of her birth.
This Silla hauing heard of the worthineſſe of Apolonius, this
yong Duke, who beſides his beautie and good graces, had a
certaine naturall allurement, that beyng now in his companie
in her fathers Courte, ſhe was ſo ſtrangely attached with
the loue of Apolonius, that there was nothing might content
her but his preſence and ſweete ſight, and although ſhe ſawe
no maner of hope, to attaine to that ſhe moſt deſired: knowing
Apolonius to be but a geſte, and readie to take the benefite of
the next Winde, and to departe into a ſtraunge Countrey,
whereby ſhe was bereued of all poſſibilitie euer to ſee hym againe,
and therefore ſtriued with her ſelf to leaue her fondeneſſe,

but all in vaine it would not be, but like the foule which
is once limed, the more ſhe ſtriueth, the faſter ſhe tieth her ſelf.
So Silla was now conſtrained perforce her will to yeelde to
loue, wherefore from tyme to tyme, ſhe vſed ſo greate familiaritie
with hym, as her honour might well permit, and fed him
with ſuche amourous baites, as the modeſtie of a maide could
reaſonably afforde, whiche when ſhe perceiued, did take but
ſmall effect, feelyng her ſelf ſo muche out raged with the extreamitie
of her paſſion, by the onely countenaunce that ſhe
beſtowed vpon Apolonius, it might haue been well perceiued,
that the very eyes pleaded vnto him for pitie and remorſe. But
Apolonius commyng but lately from out the fielde, from the
chaſing of his enemies, and his furie not yet throughly deſolued,
nor purged from his ſtomacke, gaue no regarde to thoſe
amourous entiſementes, which by reaſon of his youth, he had
not beene acquainted with all. But his mynde ranne more to
heare his Pilotes, bryng newes of a merie winde, to ſerue his
turne to Conſtantinople, whiche in the ende came very proſperouſly:
and giuyng Duke Pontus hartie thankes for his
great entertainment, takyng his leaue of hymſelf, and the Ladie
Silla his daughter, departed with his companie, and with a
happie gaale ariued at his deſired Porte. Gentlewomen according
to my promiſe, I will heare for breuities ſake, omit to
make repetition of the long and dolorous diſcourſe recorded
by Silla, for this ſodaine departure of her Apolonius, knowing
you to bee as tenderly harted as Silla her ſelf, whereby you
maie the better coniecture the furie of her Feuer.
               But Silla the further that ſhe ſawe her ſelf bereued of all
hope, euer any more to ſee her beloued Apolonius, ſo muche
the more contagious were her paſſions, and made the greater
ſpeede to execute that ſhe had premeditated in her mynde,
whiche was this: Amongeſt many ſeruauntes that did attend
vppon her, there was one whoſe name was Pedro, who had a
long tyme waited vpon her in her Chamber, whereby ſhe was
well aſſured of his fidelitie and truſt: to that Pedro, therefore
ſhe bewraied firſt the feruēcie of her loue borne to Apolonius,
coniuryng hym in the name of the Goddes of Loue her ſelf,

and bindyng hym by the duetie that a ſeruaunt ought to haue,
that tendereth his Miſtreſſe ſafetie and good likyng, and deſiryng
hym with teares tricklyng doune her cheekes, that he
would giue his conſent to aide and aſſiſt her, in that ſhe had determined,
whiche was for that ſhe was fully reſolued to goe
to Conſtantinople, where ſhe might againe take the vewe of
her beloued Apolonius, that he accordyng to the truſt ſhe had
repoſed in hym, would not refuſe to giue his conſent, ſecretly
to conuaie her from out her fathers Courte, accordyng as ſhe
ſhould giue hym direction, and alſo to make himſelf pertaker
of her iourney, and to waite vpon her, till ſhe had ſeen the end
of her determination.
               
                  Pedro perceiuyng with what vehemencie his Ladie and
Miſtreſſe had made requeſt vnto hym, albeeit he ſawe many
perilles and doubtes, depending in her pretence notwithſtandyng,
gaue his conſent to be at her diſpoſition, promiſyng her
to further her with his beſt aduice, and to bee readie to obeye
whatſoeuer ſhe would pleaſe to commaunde him. The match
beyng thus agreed vpon, and all thynges prepared in a readineſſe
for their departure: It happened there was a Gallie of
Conſtantinople, readie to departe, whiche Pedro vnderſtandyng
came to the Captaine, deſiryng him to haue paſſage for
hymſelf, and for a poore Maide that was his Siſter, whiche
were bounde to Conſtantinople vppon certaine vrgent affaires,
to whiche requeſt, the Captaine graunted, willyng hym
to prepare aborde with all ſpeede, becauſe the Winde ſerued
hym preſently to departe.
               
                  Pedro now commyng to his Miſtres, and telling her how
he had handeled the matter with the Captaine: ſhe likyng very
well of the deuiſe, diſguiſyng her ſelf into very ſimple attire,
ſtole awate from out her fathers Courte, and came with
Pedro, whom now ſhe calleth Brother aboorde the Gallie,
where all thinges being in readineſſe, and the winde ſeruyng
very well, thei launched forthe with their Oores, and ſet ſaile,
when thei were at the Sea, the Captaine of the Galleye takyng
the vewe of Silla, perceiuyng her ſingular beautie, he
was better pleaſed in beholdyng of her face, then in takyng

the height either of the Sunne of Starre, and thinkyng her
by the homelineſſe of her apparell, to be but ſome ſimple maiden,
callyng her into his Cabin, he beganne to breake with
her after the Sea faſhion, deſiryng her to vſe his owne Cabin
for her better eaſe: and duryng the tyme that ſhe remained at
the Sea, ſhe ſhould not want a bed, and then whiſperyng ſoftly
in her eare he ſaied, that for want of a bedfellowe, he hym
ſelf would ſupplie that rome. Silla not being acquainted with
any ſuche talke, bluſſhed for ſhame, but made hym no aunſwere
at all, my Captaine feelyng ſuche a bickeryng within
himſelf, the like whereof he had neuer indured vpon the Sea:
was like to be taken priſoner aboorde his owne Shippe, and
forced to yeeld hymſelf a captiue without any Cannon ſhott,
wherefore to ſalue all ſores, and thinkyng it the readieſt waie
to ſpeed, he began to breake with Silla in the waie of mariage,
telling her how happie a voyage ſhe had made, to fall into the
likyng of ſuche a one as hymſelf was, who was able to keepe
and maintaine her like a Gentlewoman, & for her ſake would
likewiſe take her brother into his fellowſhip, whom he would
by ſome meanes prefarre in ſuche ſorte, that bothe of them
ſhould haue good cauſe to thinke them ſelues thriſe happie,
ſhe to light of ſuche a houſband, and he to light of ſuche a brother.
But Silla nothyng pleaſed with theſe prefermentes, deſired
hym to ceaſe his talke, for that ſhe did thinke her ſelf in
deede to be too vnworthie ſuche a one as he was, neither was
ſhe minded yet to marrie, and therefore deſired hym to fixe his
fancie vpon ſome that were better worthie then her ſelf was,
and that could better like of his curteſie then ſhe could do: the
Captaine ſeyng hymſelf thus refuſed, being in a great chafe,
he ſaied as followeth.
               Then ſeeyng you make ſo little accompte of my curteſie,
proffered to one that is ſo farre vnworthie of it, from henceforthe
I will vſe the office of my aucthoritie, you ſhall knowe
that I am the Captaine of this Shippe, and haue power to
commaunde and diſpoſe of thinges at my pleaſure, and ſeyng
you haue ſo ſcornfully reiected me to be your loiall houſband,
I will now take you by force, and vſe you at my will, and ſo

long as it ſhall pleaſe me, will keepe you for mine owne ſtore,
there ſhall be no man able to defende you, nor yet to perſwade
me from that I haue determined. Silla with theſe wordes beyng
ſtroke into a greate feare, did thinke it now too late, to
rewe her raſhe attempte, determined rather to dye with her
owne handes, then to ſuffer her ſelf to be abuſed in ſuche ſorte,
therefore ſhe moſte humbly deſired the Captaine ſo muche as
he could to ſaue her credite, and ſeyng that ſhe muſt needes be
at his will and diſpoſition, that for that preſent he would depart,
and ſuffer her till night, when in the darke he might take
his pleaſure, without any maner of ſuſpition to the reſidue of
his companie. The Captaine thinkyng now the goole to bee
more then halfe wonne, was contented ſo farre to ſatiſfie her
requeſt, and departed out leauyng her alone in his Cabin.
               
                  Silla, beeyng alone by her ſelf, drue out her knife readie to
ſtrike her ſelf to the harte, and fallyng vpon her knees, deſired
God to receiue her ſoule, as an acceptable ſacrifice for her follies,
whiche ſhe had ſo wilfully committed, crauyng pardon
for her ſinnes, and ſo forthe continuyng a long and pitifull reconciliation
to GOD, in the middeſt whereof there ſodainly
fell a wonderfull ſtorme the terrour whereof was ſuche, that
there was no man but did thinke the Seas would preſently
haue ſwallowed them, the Billowes ſo ſodainly aroſe with
the rage of the winde, that thei were al glad to fall to heauing
out of water, for otherwiſe their feeble Gallie had neuer bin
able to haue brooked the Seas, this ſtorme continued all that
daie and the next night, and thei beeyng driuen to put romer
before the winde to keepe the Gallie ahed the Billowe, were
driuen vppon the maine Shore, where the Gallie brake all is
peeces, there was euery man prouiding to ſaue his owne life,
ſome gate vpon Hatches, Boordes, and Caſks, and were driuen
with the waues to and fro, but the greateſt nomber were
drouned, amongeſt the whiche Pedro was one, but Silla her
ſelf beeyng in the Cabin as you haue heard, tooke holde of a
Cheſt that was the Captaines, the whiche by the onely prouidence
of GOD brought her ſafe to the Shore, the whiche
when ſhe had recouered, not knowyng that was become of

                  Pedro her man, ſhe deemed that bothe he and all the reſt had
been drouned, for that ſhe ſawe no bodie vppon the Shore but
her ſelf, wherefore, when ſhe had a while made greate lamentations,
complainyng her miſhappes, ſhe beganne in the ende
to comforte her ſelf with the hope, that ſhe had to ſee her Apolonius,
and found ſuche meanes that ſhe brake open the Cheſt
that brought her to land, wherin ſhe found good ſtore of coine,
and ſondrie ſutes of Apparell that were the Captaines, and
now to preuent a nomber of iniuries, that might be proffered
to a woman that was left in her caſe, ſhe determined to leaue
her owne Apparell, and to ſorte her ſelf into ſome of thoſe ſutes,
that beeyng taken for a man, ſhe might paſſe through the
Countrey in the better ſafetie, and as ſhe chaunged her apparell,
ſhe thought it likewiſe conuenient to chaunge her name,
wherefore not readily happenyng of any other, ſhe called her
ſelf Siluio, by the name of ther owne brother, whom you haue
heard ſpoken of before.
               In this maner ſhe trauailed to Conſtantinople, where ſhe
inquired out the Pallace of the Duke Apolonius, and thinkyng
her ſelf now to be both fit and able to plaie the ſeruyng
man, ſhe preſented her ſelf to the Duke, crauyng his ſeruice,
the Duke very willyng to giue ſuccour vnto ſtraungers, perceiuyng
hym to be a proper ſmouge yong man, gaue hym entertainment:
Silla thought her ſelf now more then ſatiſfied,
for all the caſualties that had happened vnto her in her Iourney,
that ſhe might at her pleaſure take but the vewe of the
Duke Apolonius, and aboue the reſt of his ſeruaunts was very
diligent and attendaunt vppon hym, the whiche the Duke
perceiuyng, began likewiſe to growe into good likyng with
the diligence of his man, and therefore made hym one of his
Chamber, who but Siluio then was moſt neate about hym, in
helpyng of hym to make hym readie in a mornyng, in the ſetting
of his ruffes, in the keeping of his Chamber, Siluio pleaſed
his Maiſter ſo well, that aboue all the reſt of his ſeruaunts
about him, he had the greateſt credite, and the Duke put him
moſte in truſt.
               At this very inſtaunt, there was remainyng in the Citie a

noble Dame a widowe, whoſe houſbande was but lately deceaſed,
one of the nobleſt men that were in the partes of Grecia,
who left his Ladie and wife large poſſeſſions and greate
liuynges. This Ladies name was called Iulina, who beſides
the aboundance of her wealth, and the greatneſſe of her reuenues,
had likewiſe the ſoueraigntie of all the Dames of Conſtantinople
for her beautie. To this Ladie Iulina, Apolonius
became an earneſt ſuter, and accordyng to ye maner of woers,
beſides faire woordes, ſorrowfull ſighes, and piteous countenaunces,
there muſt bee ſendyng of louyng letters, Chaines,
Bracelettes, Brouches, Rynges, Tablets, Gemmes, Iuels,
and preſentes I knowe not what: So my Duke, who in the
tyme that he remained in the Ile of Cypres, had no ſkill at all
in the arte of Loue, although it were more then half proffered
vnto him, was now become a ſcholler in Loues Schoole, and
had alreadie learned his firſt leſſon, that is, to ſpeake pitifully,
to looke ruthfully, to promiſe largely, to ſerue diligently, and
to pleaſe carefully: Now he was learnyng his ſeconde leſſon,
that is to rewarde, liberally, to giue bountifully, to preſent
willingly, and to write louingly. Thus Apolonius was ſo
buſied in his newe ſtudie, that I warrant you there was no
man that could chalenge hym for plaiyng the truant, he followed
his profeſſion with ſo good a will: And who muſt bee the
meſſenger to carrie the tokens and letters to the Ladie Iulina,
but Siluio his man, in hym the Duke repoſed his onely
confidence, to goe betweene hym and his Ladie.
               New Gentlewomen, doe you think there could haue been
a greater torment deuiſed, wherewith to afflicte the harte of
Silla, then her ſelf to bee made the Inſtrument to woorke her
owne miſhapp, and to plaie the Atturney in a cauſe, that made
ſo muche againſt her ſelf. But Silla altogether deſirous to
pleaſe her Maiſter, cared nothyng at all to offend her ſelf, followed
his buſineſſe with ſo good a will, as if it had been in her
owne preferment.
               
                  Iulina now hauyng many tymes, taken the gaze of this
yong youth Siluio, perceiuyng hym to bee of ſuche excellent
perfecte grace, was ſo intangled with the often ſight of this

ſweete temptation, that ſhe fell into as great a likyng with
the man, as the Maiſter was with her ſelf: And on a tyme Siluio
beyng ſent from his Maiſter, with a meſſage to the Ladie
Iulina, as he beganne very earneſtly to ſolicet in his Maiſters
behalfe, Iulina interruptyng hym in his tale, ſaied: Siluio it is
enough that you haue ſaied for your Maiſter, from henceforth
either ſpeake for your ſelf, or ſaie nothyng at all. Silla abaſhed
to heare theſe wordes, began in her minde to accuſe the blindneſſe
of Loue, that Iulina neglecting the good will of ſo noble
a Duke, would preferre her loue vnto ſuche a one, as Nature
it ſelf had denaied to recompence her likyng.
               And now for a tyme, leauyng matters dependyng as you
haue heard, it fel out that the right Siluio in deede (whom you
haue heard ſpoken of before, the brother of Silla,) was come to
his Fathers Courte into the Ile of Cypres, where vnderſtanding,
that his ſiſter was departed, in maner as you haue heard
coniectured, that the very occaſion did proceed of ſome liking
had betweene Pedro her man (that was miſſing with her) and
her ſelf, but Siluio who loued his ſiſter, as dearly as his owne
life, and her rather for that as ſhe was his naturall ſiſter, bothe
by Father and Mother, ſo the one of them was ſo like the other,
in countenaunce and fauour, that there was no man able
to deſcerne the one from the other by their faces, ſauyng by
their apparell the one beyng a man, the other a woman.
               
                  Siluio therefore vowed to his Father, not onely to ſeeke
but his ſiſter Silla, but alſo to reuenge the villanie, whiche he
conceiued in Sedro, for the carriyng awaie of his ſiſter, and
thus departyng hauyng trauailed through many Cities and
Townes, without hearyng any maner of newes, of thoſe he
went to ſeeke for, at the faſt be arriued at Conſtantinople,
where as he was walking in an euenyng for his owne recreation,
on a pleaſaunt greene yarde, without the walles of the
Citie, he fortuned to meete with the Ladie Iulina, who likewiſe
had been abroade to take the aire, and as ſhe ſodainly caſt
her eyes vppon Siluio, thinkyng hym to bee her olde acquaintaunce,
by reaſon they were ſo like one an other, as you haue
heard before, ſaied vnto hym, ſir Siluio, if your haſte be not the

greater, I praie you let me haue a little talke with you, ſeyng
I haue ſo luckely met you in this place.
               
                  Siluio wonderyng to heare hymſelf ſo rightly named, beeyng
but a ſtraunger, not of aboue two daies continuaunce in
the Citie, very courteouſly came towardes her, deſirous to
heare what ſhe would ſaie.
               
                  Iulina commaunding her traine ſomething to ſtand backe,
ſaied as followeth. Seyng my good will and freendly loue,
hath been the onely cauſe to make me ſo prodigal to offer, that
I ſee is ſo lightly reiected, it maketh me to thinke, that men
be of this condition, rather to deſire thoſe thinges, whiche thei
can not come by, then to eſteeme or value of that, whiche both
largely and liberally is offered vnto them, but if the liberalitie
of my proffer, hath made to ſeme leſſe the value of the thing
that I ment to preſent, it is but in your owne cōceipt, conſidering
how many noble men there hath been here before, and be
yet at this preſent, whiche hath bothe ſerued, ſued, and moſte
humbly intreated, to attaine to that, whiche to you of my ſelf,
I haue freely offred, and I perceiue is diſpiſed, or at the leaſt
very lightly regarded.
               
                  Siluio wonderyng at theſe woordes, but more amazed that
ſhe could ſo rightly call hym by his name, could not tell what
to make of her ſpeeches, aſſuring hym ſelf that ſhe was deceiued,
and did miſtake hym, did thinke notwithſtandyng, it had
been a poinct of greate ſimplicitie, if he ſhould forſake that,
whiche Fortune had ſo fauourably proffered vnto hym, perceiuyng
by her traine, that ſhe was ſome Ladie of greate honour,
and vewing the perfection of her beautie, and the excellencie
of her grace and countenaunce, did thinke it vnpoſſible
that ſhe ſhould be deſpiſed, and therefore aunſwered thus.
               Madame, if before this tyme, I haue ſeemed to forget my
ſelf, in neglecting your courteſie whiche ſo liberally you haue
ment vnto me: pleaſe it you to pardon what is paſt, and from
this daie forwardes, Siluio remaineth readie preſt to make
ſuche reaſonable amendes, as his abilitie may any waies permit,
or as it ſhall pleaſe you to commaunde.
               
                  Iulina the gladdeſt woman that might bee, to heare theſe

ioyfull newes, ſaied: Then my Siluio ſee you faile not to Morowe
at night to ſuppe with me at my owne houſe, where I
will diſcourſe farther with you, what amendes you ſhal make
me, to whiche requeſt Siluio gaue his glad conſent, and thus
thei departed very well pleaſed. And as Iulina did thinke the
tyme very long, till ſhe had reapt the fruite of her deſire: So
Siluio he wiſht for Harueſt, before Corne could growe, thinkyng
the tyme as long, till he ſawe how matters would fall
out, but not knowyng what Ladie ſhe might bee, he preſently
(before Iulina was out of ſight) demaunded of one that was
walkyng by what ſhe was, and how ſhe was called, who ſatiſfied
Siluio in euery poinct, and alſo in what parte of the toune
her houſe did ſtande, whereby he might enquire it out.
               
                  Siluio thus departing to his lodging, paſſed the night with
very vnquiet ſleapes, and the next Mornyng his mynd ranne
ſo muche of his Supper, that he neuer cared, neither for his
Breakfaſt nor Dinner, and the daie to his ſeemyng paſſed awaie
ſo ſlowlie, that he had thought the ſtatelie Steedes had
been tired, that drawe the Chariot of the Sunne, or els ſome
other Ioſua had commaunded them againe to ſtande, and wiſhed
that Phaeton had been there with a whippe.
               
                  Iulina on the other ſide, ſhe had thought the Clocke ſetter
had plaied the knaue, the daie came no faſter forwardes, but
ſixe a clocke beyng once ſtroken, recouered comforte to bothe
parties: and Siluio haſtening himſelf to the Pallace of Iulina,
where by her he was frendly welcomed, and a ſumpteous ſupper
beeyng made readie, furniſhed with ſondrie ſortes of delicate
diſhes, thei ſatte them doune, paſſyng the Supper tyme
with amourous lookes, louyng countenaunces, and ſecrete
glaunces conueighed from the one to the other, whiche did
better ſatiſfie them, then the feedyng of their daintie diſhes.
               Supper tyme beeyng thus ſpent, Iulina did thinke it very
vnfitly, if ſhe ſhould tourne Siluio to goe ſeeke his lodging in
an euenyng, deſired him therefore, that he would take a bedde
in her houſe for that night, and bryngyng hym vp into a faire
Chamber, that was very richly furniſhed, ſhe found ſuch meanes,
that when all the reſt of her houſholde ſeruauntes were

a bedde and quiet, ſhe came her ſelf to beare Siluio companie,
where concludyng vpon conditions, that were in queſtion betweene
them, thei paſſed the night with ſuche ioy and contentation,
as might in that conuenient tyme bee wiſhed for, but
onely that Iulina, feedyng too muche of ſome one diſhe aboue
the reſt, receiued a ſurfett, whereof ſhe could not bee cured in
fourtie weekes after, a naturall inclination in all Women
whiche are ſubiect to longyng, and want the reaſon to vſe a
moderation in their diet: but the mornyng approching, Iulina
tooke her leaue, and conueighed her ſelf into her owne chamber,
and when it was faire daie light, Siluio makyng hymſelf
readie, departed likewiſe about his affaires in the Toune, debatyng
with hymſelf how thynges had happened, being well
aſſured that Iulina had miſtaken him, and therefore for feare of
further euilles, determined to come no more there, but tooke
his iourney towardes other places in the partes of Grecia, to
ſee if he could learne any tidynges of his ſiſter Silla.
               
               The Duke Apolonius hauing made a long ſute, and neuer
a whit the nerer of his purpoſe, came to Iulina to craue her direct
aunſwere, either to accept of him, and of ſuche conditions
as he proffered vnto her, or els to giue him his laſt farewell.
               
                  Iulina, as you haue heard, had taken an earneſt penie of an
other, whom ſhe had thought had been Siluio the Dukes mā,
was at a controuerſie in her ſelf, what ſhe might do, one while
ſhe thought, ſeyng her occaſion ſerued ſo fit, to craue the Dukes
good will, for the mariyng of his man, then againe, ſhe
could not tell what diſpleaſure the Duke would conceiue, in
that ſhe ſhould ſeeme to preferre his man before hymſelf, did
thinke it therefore beſt to conceale the matter, till ſhe might
ſpeake with Siluio, to vſe his opiniō how theſe matters ſhould
be handled, & herevpon reſoluyng her ſelf, deſiryng the Duke
to pardon her ſpeeches, ſaied as followeth.
               Sir Duke, for that from this tyme forwardes I am no
longer of my ſelf, hauing giuen my full power and authoritie
ouer to an other, whoſe wife I now remaine by faithfull vow
and promiſe: And albeeit, I knowe the worlde will wonder
when thei ſhall vnderſtande the fondneſſe of my choyce, yet I

truſt you your ſelf will nothyng deſlike with me, ſithe I haue
ment no other thing, then the ſatiſfiyng of mine owne contentation
and likyng.
               The Duke hearyng theſe wordes, aunſwered: Madame, I
muſt then content my ſelf, although againſt my will, hauyng
the Lawe in your owne handes, to like of whom you liſt, and
to make choiſe where it pleaſeth you.
               
                  Iulina giuyng the Duke greate thankes, that would content
himſelf with ſuche pacience, deſired him likewiſe, to giue
his free conſent and good wil, to the partie whom ſhe had choſen
to be her houſbande.
               Naie ſurely Madame (ꝙ the Duke) I will neuer giue my
conſent, that any other man ſhall enioye you then my ſelf, I
haue made too greate accompt of you, then ſo lightly to paſſe
you awaie with my good will: But ſeyng it lieth not in me to
let you, hauyng (as you ſaie) made your owne choiſe, ſo from
hence forwardes I leaue you to your owne likyng, alwaies
willyng you well, and thus will take my leaue.
               The Duke departed towardes his owne houſe very ſorrowfull,
that Iulina had thus ſerued hym, but in the meane
ſpace that the Duke had remained in the houſe of Iulina, ſome
of his ſeruauntes fell into talke and conference, with the ſeruaunts
of Iulina, where debatyng betweene them, of the likelihood
of the Marriage, betwéene the Duke and the Ladie, one
of the ſeruantes of Iulina ſaied: that he neuer ſawe his Ladie
and Miſtres, vſe ſo good countenaunce to the Duke hymſelf,
as ſhe had doen to Siluio his man, and began to reporte with
what familiaritie and courteſie, ſhe had receiued hym, feaſted
hym, and lodged hym, and that in his opinion, Siluio was like
to ſpeede before the Duke, or any other that were ſuters.
               This tale was quickly brought to the Duke himſelf, who
makyng better enquirie in the matter, found it to be true that
was reported, and better conſideryng of the wordes, whiche
Iulina had vſed towardes hymſelf, was very well aſſured that
it could bee no other then his owne man, that had thruſt his
Noſe ſo farre out of ioynt, wherefore without any further reſpect,
cauſed hym to be thruſt into a Dongeon, where he was

kept priſoner, in a very pitifull plight.
               Poore Siluio, hauyng gott intelligence by ſome of his fellowes,
what was the cauſe that the Duke his Maiſter did
beare ſuche diſpleaſure vnto hym, deuiſed all the meanes he
could, as well by meditation by his fellowes, as otherwiſe by
petitions, and ſupplication to the Duke, that he would ſuſpende
his Iudgement, til perfect proofe wer
                     •
                   had in the matter,
and then if any maner of th
                     •
                  ng did fall out againſt hym,
wherby the Duke had cauſe to take any greefe, he would confeſſe
hymſelf worthie not onely of impriſonment, but alſo of
moſte vile and ſhamefull death: with theſe petitions he daiely
plied the Duke, but all in vaine, for the Duke thought he had
made ſo good proofe, that he was throughly confirmed in his
opinion againſt his man.
               But the Ladie Iulina, wonderyng what made Siluio, that
he was ſo ſlacke in his viſitation, and why he abſented himſelf
ſo long from her preſence, beganne to thinke that all was not
well, but in the ende, perceiuyng no decoction of her former
ſurfette, receiued as you haue heard, and findyng in her ſelf,
an vnwonted ſwellyng in her beallie, aſſuryng her ſelf to bee
with childe, fearyng to become quite banckroute of her honour,
did thinke it more then tyme to ſeeke out a Father, and
made ſuche ſecret ſearche, and diligent enquirie, that ſhe learned
the truth how Siluio was kept in priſon, by the Duke his
Maiſter, and mindyng to finde a preſent remedie, as well for
the loue ſhe bare to Siluio, as for the maintenaunce of her credite
and eſtimation, ſhe ſpeedily haſted to the Pallace of the
Duke, to whom ſhe ſaied as followeth.
               Sir Duke, it maie bee that you will thinke my commyng
to your houſe in this ſorte, doeth ſomethyng paſſe the limites
of modeſtie, the whiche I proteſt before GOD, proceaded of
this deſire, that the worlde ſhould knowe, how iuſtly I ſeeke
meanes to maintaine my honour, but to the ende I ſeeme not
tedious with prolixitie of woordes, nor to vſe other then direct
circumſtaunces, knowe ſir, that the loue I beare to my
onely beloued Siluio, whom I doe eſteeme more then all the
Iewelles in the world, whoſe perſonage I regard more then

my owne life, is the onely cauſe of my attempted iourney, beſeechyng
you, that all the whole diſpleaſure, whiche I vnderſtand
you haue conceiued againſt hym, maie be imputed vnto
my charge, & that it would pleaſe you louyngly to deale with
him, whom of my ſelf I haue choſen rather for the ſatiſfaction
of mine honeſt liking, then for the vaine preheminences or honourable
dignities looked after by ambicious myndes.
               The Duke hauyng heard this diſcourſe, cauſed Siluio preſently
to be ſent for, and to be brought before hym, to whom he
ſaied: Had it not been ſufficient for thee, when I had repoſed
my ſelf in thy fidelitie, and the truſtineſſe of thy ſeruice, that
thou ſhouldeſt ſo traiterouſly deale with me, but ſince that
time haſte not ſpared, ſtil to abuſe me with ſo many forgeries,
and periured proteſtations, not onely hatefull vnto me, whoſe
ſimplicitie thou thinkeſt to bee ſuche, that by the plotte of thy
pleaſaunt tongue, thou wouldeſt make me beleeue a manifeſt
vntrothe, but moſte habominable bee thy doynges in the preſence
and ſight of God, that haſt not ſpared to blaſpheeme his
holy name, by callyng hym to bee a witneſſe to maintaine thy
leaſynges, and ſo deteſtably wouldeſt forſweare thy ſelf, in a
matter that is ſo openly knowne.
               Poore Siluio whoſe innocencie was ſuche, yt he might lawfully
ſweare, ſeing Iulina to be there in place, aunſwered thus.
               Moſte noble Duke, well vnderſtandyng your conceiued
greefe, moſt humbly I beſeeche you paciently to heare my excuſe,
not mindyng thereby to aggrauate or heape vp your
wrathe and diſpleaſure, proteſtyng before God, that there is
nothyng in the worlde, whiche I regarde ſo muche, or doe eſteeme
ſo deare, as your good grace and fauour, but deſirous
that your grace ſhould know my innocencie, and to cleare my
ſelf of ſuche impoſitions, wherewith I knowe I am wrongfully
accuſed, whiche as I vnderſtande ſhould be in the practiſing
of the Ladie Iulina, who ſtandeth here in place, whoſe acquitance
for my better diſcharge, now I moſt humbly craue,
proteſting before the almightie God, that neither in thought,
worde, nor deede, I haue not otherwiſe vſed my ſelf, then accordyng
to the bonde and duetie of a ſeruaunt, that is bothe

willyng and deſirous, to further his Maiſters ſutes, which if
I haue otherwiſe ſaied then that is true, you Madame Iulina,
who can very well deſide the depthes of all this doubt, I moſt
humbly beſeeche you to certifie a troth, if I haue in any thing
miſſaied, or haue otherwiſe ſpoken then is right and iuſt.
               
                  Iulina hauing heard this diſcourſe which Siluio had made,
perceiuyng that he ſtoode in great awe of the Dukes diſpleaſure,
aunſwered thus: Thinke not my Siluio, that my commyng
hether is to accuſe you of any miſdemeanour towards
your Maiſter, ſo I doe not denaie, but in al ſuche Imbaſſages
wherein towardes me you haue been imployed, you haue vſed
the office of a faithfull and truſtie meſſenger, neither am I aſhamed
to confeſſe, that the firſt day that mine eyes did behold
the ſinguler behauiour, the notable curteſie, and other innumerable
giftes wherewith my Siluio is endued, but that beyonde
all meaſure my harte was ſo inflamed, that impoſſible
it was for me, to quenche the feruent loue, or extinguiſhe the
leaſt part of my conceiued torment, before I had bewraied the
ſame vnto hym, and of my owne motion, craued his promiſed
faithe and loialtie of marriage, and now is the tyme to manifeſt
the ſame vnto the worlde, whiche hath been doen before
God, and betweene our ſelues: knowyng that it is not needefull,
to keepe ſecret that, whiche is neither euill doen, nor hurtfull
to any perſone, therefore (as I ſaied before) Siluio is my
houſbande by plited faithe, whom I hope to obtaine without
offence, or diſpleaſure of any one, truſting that there is no mā,
that will ſo farre forget hymſelf, as to reſtraine that, whiche
God hath left at libertie for euery wight, or that will ſeeke by
crueltie, to force Ladies to marrie otherwiſe, then accordyng
to their owne likyng. Feare not then my Siluio to keepe your
faith and promiſe, whiche you haue made vnto me, and as for
the reſt: I doubt not thynges will ſo fall out, as you ſhall haue
no maner of cauſe to complaine.
               
                  Siluio amaſed to heare theſe woordes, for that Iulina by her
ſpeeche, ſeemed to confirme that, whiche he moſt of all deſired
to be quite of, ſaied: Who would haue thought that a Ladie of
ſo greate honour and reputation, would her ſelf bee the Embaſſadour,

of a thyng ſo preiudiciall, and vncomely for her eſtate,
what plighted promiſes be theſe whiche be ſpoken of▪ altogether
ignoraunt vnto me, whiche if it be otherwiſe then I
haue ſaied, you Sacred Gods conſume me ſtraight with flaſhyng
flames of fire. But what woordes might I vſe to giue
credite to the truth, and innocencie of my cauſe? Ah Madame
Iulina, I deſire no other teſtimonie, then your owne honeſtie
and vertue, thinkyng that you will not ſo muche blemiſhe the
brightneſſe of your honour, knowyng that a woman is or
ſhould be, the Image of curteſie, continencie, and ſhamefaſtneſſe,
from the whiche ſo ſoone as ſhe ſtoopeth, and leaueth the
office of her duetie and modeſtie, beſides the degraduation of
her honour, ſhe thruſteth her ſelf into the pitt of perpetuall infamie,
and as I can not thinke you would ſo farre forget your
ſelf, by the refuſall of a noble duke, to dimme the light of your
renowne and glorie, whiche hetherto you haue maintained, amongeſt
the beſt and nobleſt Ladies, by ſuch a one as I know
my ſelf to be, too farre vnworthie your degree and callyng, ſo
moſt humbly I beſeeche you to confeſſe a trothe 
                     〈…〉
                  
thoſe vowes and promiſes you ſpeake of, whiche ſpéeches
bee ſo obſcure vnto me, as I knowe not for my life how I
might vnderſtande them.
               
                  Iulina ſomethyng nipped with theſe ſpeeches ſaied, and
what is the matter that now you make ſo little accompt of
your Iulina, that beeyng my houſbande in deede, haue the
face to denay me, to whom thou art contracted by ſo many ſolemne
othes: what arte thou aſhamed to haue me to thy wife?
how muche oughteſt thou rather to bee aſhamed to breake thy
promiſed faithe, and to haue deſpiſed the holie and dreadfull
name of GOD, but that tyme conſtraineth me to laie open
that, whiche ſhame rather willeth I ſhould diſſemble and
keepe ſecret, behold me then here Siluio whom thou haſt gotten
with childe, who if thou be of ſuche honeſtie, as I truſt for
al this I ſhall finde, then the thing is doen without preiudice,
or any hurte to my conſcience, conſideryng that by the profeſſed
faithe, thou diddeſt accoumpt me for thy wife, and I receiued
thee for my ſpouſe and loyall houſbande, ſwearing by the

almightie God, that no other then you haue made the cōqueſt
and triumphe of my chaſtitie, whereof I craue no other witneſſe
then your ſelf, and myne owne conſcience.
               I praie you Gentlewomen, was not this a foule ouerſight
of Iulina, that would ſo preciſely ſweare ſo great an othe, that
ſhe was gotten with childe by one, that was altogether vnfurniſht
with implementes for ſuche a tourne. For Gods loue
take heede, and let this be an example to you, when you bee
with childe, how you ſweare who is the father, before you haue
had good proofe and knowledge of the partie, for men bee ſo
ſubtill and full of ſleight, that God knoweth a woman maie
quickly be deceiued.
               But now to retourne to our Siluio, who hearyng an othe
ſworne ſo deuinely that he had gotten a woman with childe,
was like to beleeue that it had bin true in very deede, but remembryng
his owne impediment, thought it impoſſible that
he ſhould commit ſuche an acte, and therefore halfe in a chafe,
he ſaied. What lawe is able to reſtraine the fooliſhe indeſcretion
of a woman, that yeeldeth her ſelf to her owne deſires,
what ſhame is able to bridle or withdrawe her from her mynd
and madneſſe, or with what ſnaffell is it poſſible to holde her
backe, from the execution of her filthineſſe, but what abhomination
is this, that a Ladie of ſuch a houſe ſhould ſo forget the
greatneſſe of her eſtate, the aliaunce whereof ſhe is deſcended,
the nobilitie of her deceaſed houſbande, and maketh no conſcience
to ſhame and ſlaunder her ſelf, with ſuche a one a I
am, being ſo farre vnfit and vnſeemely for her degree, but how
horrible is it to heare the name of God ſo defaſed, that wee
make no more accompt, but for the maintenaunce of our miſchifes,
we feare no whit at all to forſweare his holy name, as
though he were not in all his dealinges moſte righteous true
and iuſte, and will not onely laie open our leaſinges to the
worlde, but will likewiſe puniſhe the ſame with moſte ſharpe
and bitter ſcourges.
               
                  Iulina, not able to indure hym to proceede any farther in
his Sermon, was alreadie ſurpriſed with a vehement greefe,
began bitterly to crie out vtteryng theſe ſpeeches followyng.
               
                  
Alas, is it poſſible that the ſoueraigne iuſtice of God, can
abide a miſchiefe ſo greate and curſed, why maie I not now
ſuffer death, rather then the infamie whiche I ſee to wander
before myne eyes. O happie and more then right happie had
I bin, if inconſtant fortune had not deuiſed this treaſon where
in I am ſurpriſed and caught, am I thus become to be intangled
with ſnares, and in the handes of hym, who inioiyng the
ſpoyles of my honour, will openly depriue me of my fame, by
making me a common fable to all poſteritie in time to come:
ah Traitour and diſcourtious wretche, is this the recompence
of the honeſt and firme amitie which I haue borne thee, wherin
haue I deſerued this diſcourteſie, by louing thee more then
thou art able to deſerue, is it I arrant theefe is it I, vppon
whom thou thinkeſt to worke thy miſchiues, doeſt thou think
me no better worthe, but that thou maieſt prodigally waſte
my honour at thy pleaſure, dideſt thou dare to aduenture vppon
me, hauyng thy conſcience woūded with ſo deadly a treaſon:
ah vnhappie and aboue all other moſt vnhappie, that haue
ſo charely preſerued myne honour, and now am made a praie
to ſatiſfie a yong mans luſt, that hath coueted nothyng but the
ſpoyle of my chaſtitie and good name.
               Here withall the teares ſo guſhed doune her cheekes, that
ſhe was not able to open her mouth to vſe any farther ſpeech.
               The Duke who ſtoode by all this while, and heard this
whole diſcourſe, was wonderfully mooued with compaſſion
towardes Iulina, knowyng that from her infancie ſhe had euer
ſo honourably vſed her ſelf, that there was no man able to
detect her of any miſdemeanour, otherwiſe then beſeemed a
Ladie of her eſtate, wherefore beyng fully reſolued that Siluio
his man had committed this villanie againſt her, in a greate
furie drawyng his Rapier he ſaied vnto Siluio.
               
               How canſt thou (arrant theefe) ſhewe thy ſelf ſo cruell and
careleſſe to ſuche as doe thee honour, haſt thou ſo little regard
of ſuche a noble Ladie, as humbleth her ſelf to ſuche a villaine
as thou art, who without any reſpecte either of her renowne
or noble eſtate, canſt be content to ſeeke the wracke and vtter
ruine of her honour, but frame thy ſelf to make ſuche ſatiſfaction

as ſhe requireth, although I knowe vnworthie wretche,
that thou art not able to make her the leaſt parte of amendes,
or I ſweare by God, that thou ſhalt not eſcape y• death whiche
I will miniſter to thee with my owne handes, and therefore
aduiſe thee well what thou doeſt.
               
                  Siluio hauyng heard this ſharpe ſentence, fell doune on his
knees before the Duke crauyng for mercie, deſiryng that he
might be ſuffered to ſpeake with the Ladie Iulina aparte, promiſing
to ſatiſfie her, accordyng to her owne contentation.
               Well (ꝙ the Duke) I take thy worde, and there with all
I aduiſe thee that thou performe thy promiſe, or otherwiſe I
proteſt before God, I will make thee ſuche an example to the
world, that all Traitours ſhall tremble for feare, how thei doe
ſeeke the diſhonouryng of Ladies.
               But now Iulina had conceiued ſo great greefe againſt Siluio,
that there was muche a doe, to perſwade her to talke with
hym, but remembryng her owne caſe, deſirous to heare what
excuſe he could make, in ye ende ſhe agreed, and being brought
into a place ſeuerally by them ſelues, Siluio beganne with a
piteous voyce to ſaie as followeth.
               I knowe not Madame, of whom I might make complaint,
whether of you or of my ſelf, or rather of Fortune,
whiche hath conducted and brought vs bothe into ſo great aduerſitie,
I ſee that you reciue greate wrong, and I am condemned
againſt all right, you in perrill to abide the brute of
ſpightfull tongues, and I in daunger to looſe the thyng that
I moſt deſire: and although I could aſ
                     •
                  edge many reaſons to
proue my ſaiynges true, yet I referre my ſelf, to the experience
and bountie of your mynde▪ And here with all looſyng
his garmentes doune to his ſtomacke, and ſhewed Iulina his
breaſtes and pretie teates, ſurmountyng farre the whitneſſe
of Snowe it ſelf, ſaiyng: Loe Madame, behold here the partie
whom you haue chalenged to bee the father of your childe, ſee
I am a woman the daughter of a noble Duke, who onely for
the loue of hym, whom you ſo lightly haue ſhaken of, haue forſaken
my Father, abandoned my Countrey, and in maner as
you ſee am become a ſeruing man, ſatiſfiyng my ſelf, but with

the only ſight of my Apolonius, and now Madame, if my paſſion
were not vehement, & my tormentes without cōpariſon,
I would wiſhe that my fained greefes might bee laughed to
ſcorne, & my diſſembled paines to bee rewarded with floutes.
But my loue beyng pure, my trauaile continuall, & my greefes
endleſſe, I truſt Madame you will not onely excuſe me of
crime, but alſo pitie my deſtreſſe, the which I proteſt I would
ſtill haue kept ſecrete, if my fortune would ſo haue permitted.
               
                  Iulina did now think her ſelf to be in a worſe caſe then euer
ſhe was before, for now ſhe knew not whom to chalenge to be
the father of her child: wherefore, when ſhe had told the Duke
the very certantie of the diſcourſe, which Siluio had made vnto
her, ſhe departed to her owne houſe, with ſuche greefe & ſorrowe,
that ſhe purpoſed neuer to come out of her owne doores
againe aliue, to be a wonder & mocking ſtocke to the worlde.
               But ye Duke more amaſed, to heare this ſtraūge diſcourſe
of Siluio came vnto him, whō when he had dewed with better
conſideration, perceiued in deede that it was Silla the daughter
of Duke Pontus, and imbraſing her in his armes, 
                     〈…〉
                  
               
               Oh the braunche of all vertue, and the flowre of curteſie it
ſelf, pardon me I beſeeche you of all ſuche diſcourteſies, as I
haue ignorantly committed towardes you: deſiryng you that
without farther memorie of auncient greefes, you wil accept
of me, who is more ioyfull and better cōtented with your preſence,
then if the whole worlde were at my commaundement.
Where hath there euer been founde ſuche liberalitie in a Louer,
whiche hauyng been trained vp and nouriſhed amongeſt
the delicacies and banquettes of the Courte, accompanied
with traines of many faire and noble Ladies liuyng in pleaſure,
and in the middeſt of delightes, would ſo prodigally aduenture
your ſelf, neither fearing miſhapps, nor miſliking to
take ſuche paines, as I knowe you haue not been accuſtomed
vnto. O liberalitie neuer heard of before. O facte that can neuer
be ſufficiently rewarded. O true Loue moſt pure and vnfained:
Here with all ſendyng for the moſt artificiall woorkmen,
he prouided for her ſondrie ſutes of ſumpteous Apparell,
and the Marriage daie appointed, whiche was celebrated

with greate triumphe, through the whole Citie of Conſtantinople,
euery one praiſing the nobleneſſe of the Duke, but ſo
many as did behold the excellent beautie of Silla, gaue her the
praiſe aboue all the reſt of the Ladies in the troupe.
               The matter ſeemed ſo wonderfull and ſtraunge, that the
brute was ſpreade throughout all the partes of Grecia, in ſo
muche that it came to the hearyng of Siluio, who as you haue
heard, remained in thoſe partes to enquire of his ſiſter, he being
the gladdeſt man in the worlde, haſted to Conſtantinople,
where commyng to his Siſter he was ioyfully receiued, and
moſte louingly welcomed, and entertained of the Duke his
brother in Lawe. After he had remained there two or three dayes,
the Duke reuealed vnto Siluio, the whole diſcourſe how
it happened, betwéene his ſiſter and the Ladie Iulina, and how
his ſiſter was chalenged, for gettyng a woman with childe:
Siluio bluſhyng with theſe wordes, was ſtriken with great remorſe
to make Iulina amendes, vnderſtandyng her to be a noble
Ladie, and was left defamed to the worlde through his de
                  
                     •
                  ault,
he therefore bewraied the whole circumſtaunce to the
Duke, whereof ye Duke being very ioyful, immediatly repaired
with Siluio to the houſe of Iulina, whom thei founde in her
Chamber, in greate lamentation and mournyng. To whom
the Duke ſaied: take courage Madame, for beholde here a
Gentleman, that will not ſticke, both to father your child, and
to take you for his wife, no inferiour perſon, but the ſonne and
heire of a noble Duke, worthie of your eſtate and dignitie.
               
                  Iulina ſeing Siluio in place, did know very well that he was
the father of her childe, and was for rauiſhed with ioye, that ſhe
knewe not whether ſhe were awake, or in ſome dreame. Siluio
imbracyng her in his armes, crauyng forgiueneſſe of all that
paſt: concluded with her the mariage daie, which was preſently
accompliſhed with greate ioye, and contentation to al parties:
And thus Siluio hauyng attained a noble wife, and Silla
his ſiſter her deſired houſbande, thei paſſed the reſidue of
their daies with ſuche delight, as thoſe that haue accompliſhed
the perfection of their felicities.

               Of Nicander and Lucilla.
               
                  The Argument of the third Historie.
                  ¶Lucilla, a yong maiden, endued with ſinguler beautie, for
want of a conuent dowrie, was reſtrained from mariyng
her beloued Nicander, in the ende, through the greate
magnificence of the courteous▪ yong prince Don Hercules,
the onely ſonne and heire of Alfonſo duke of Ferrara
ſhe was releeued with the ſomme of 2000▪ Crounes, the
whiche money beyng receiued by the father of Nicander
the mariage was performed to the greate contentation of
the noble yong prince, but especially to the twoo yong louers,
Nicander and Lucilla.
               
               
                  IN the tyme that Alfonſo firſte

that name, and third Duke of Ferrara
gout
                     ••
                  ed that ſtate, there was
in the Citee of Ferrara, a gentle
yong gentlewoman, named Lucilla,
borne of a noble Familie, but by
the frowardneſſe of blind Fortune
reduced to great pouertie, then her
vertues did deſerue: whoſe beautie
appeared to bee ſuche, in the prime and flower of her yeres, as
it filled with meruaile, all thoſe that caſte their eyes vpon her.
Of this Gentlewoman was feruently enamoured, a gallant
yong Gentleman, whoſe name was Nicander, and in like ſort
borne of noble blood. And deſired nothyng more, then to bee
ioyned with her in Matrimonie. But ſhe beyng, as it is ſaied,
poore, though of noble Parentage, and endued with ſingular
vertues: The Father of the yong Gentleman diſdained her,
who (as for the moſte part, we ſee old men, naturally enclined
to coue
                     •
                  iſe) regarding rather the wealth that their daughters
in lawe, are to bring into their families, then either birthe, vertue,

or giftes of the minde, could in no wiſe bee perſwaded, or
intreated to content his ſonne in that behalf, and to ſuffer him
to enioye his Loue, by takyng her to wife: alledgyng that the
firſt thing that was to be conſidered in mariage, was the dowrie,
and the woman. For that the vertues of the women, dooe

it happened that Don Hercules the Dukes onely ſonne
and heire, beyng then in the freſheſt time of his youth, paſſing
by the ſtreate where this gentlewoman dwelt, ſawe her ſtanding
in her doore, apparailed in White, whiche kinde of attire
encreaſed greatly her naturall beautie. And conſidering ſomwhat
curiouſtie, the comelineſſe and excellencie of her perſonage,
together with her perfectiō of beautie, he receiued with
ſuche force into his imagination, the firſte impreſſion of them
bothe, that from thence forward, her liuely Image ſemed continuallie
to bee before his eyes: by the conſideration whereof
he grewe by degrees, to conceiue ſo vehement a deſire, to enioye
the ſingularitie whiche he ſawe in her, that he thought it
impoſſible for him to liue, if he did not attaine it.
               And ofte times diſcourſyng to himſelf thereof, he would
ſaie, what iniurie hath Fortune dooen vnto this faire Gentlewoman,
that as Nature hath been liberall, in beſtowyng of
beautie vpon her, meete for any greate Princes, ſhe hath not
likewiſe cauſed her to be borne of ſome king or mightie prince

whiche if ſhe were, I would neuer ceaſe, till I had founde the
meanes to gett her to bee my wife, and ſo enioye her as myne
owne, with the ſafetie of her honour, and with the ſatiſfaction
and contentment of my Father.

vnequall to his, to wiſhe, or to procure any ſuche matche: Yet
ceaſed he not by all the meanes he could, to win her good will,
and now by one deuiſe, and now by an other, to induce her to
loue him, and to yeeld to his feruent deſire. But all in vaine.
For where many others would haue taken it, for a great good
Fortune, that ſuche a Prince, ſhould haue fallen in loue with
thē: Lucilla conſidering the baſeneſſe of her degree, in reſpect
of the high eſtate of her newe Louer, reputed it to be a greate
miſhap vnto her, as ſhe that conſidered, that ſhe could not nouriſhe,
or entertaine any ſuche Loue, but with the harme and
preiudice of her honour. Beſides that, ſhe feared leaſt that Nicander
ſhould once perceiue, that this yong Prince hunted after
that haūt, he would forſake her, for feare of farther diſpleaſure,

greatlie troubled in ſpirite, fearing that Lucilla (wauering as
women vſe to doe) had forſaken him, and turned her affection
els where: as one full of gelouſie and greef, for fault of better
comforte, he would watche his times, and followe her to that
Churche: there to feede his fancie with a looke or twoo, which
yet amid his miſerie, he ſeemed to eſteeme as a releef, without

               This ſweete aunſwere mitigated not a little, the moode
of the yong Gentleman, and ſo he framed himſelf the beſte he
could, to tollerate the abſence of his Lucilla. On the other ſide
Don Hercules, who in like maner founde himſelf depriued, of
the ſight of that yong Ladie, whom he loued extreamely, was
verie muche diſcontented, and perceiuing that neither meſſages,
nor faire offers, with large giftes ſent vnto her, whereof
neuer any were accepted, could once moue her to ſhewe her
ſelf courteous vnto him, of ſo muche as a looke: And conſidering
the pouertie, wherein her mother liued, now in her latter
yeres, beganne to imagine that it would bee muche eaſier for
hym, by offeryng her liberally, wherewithall to Marrie her
daughter, to perſwade her to yeeld her into his handes, then to
winne the yong Gentlewoman to his deſire.
               Wherefore hauyng ſent a fit perſone to Lucillas Mother,
to let her vnderſtande, that if ſhe would bee con

yong Prince might enioye her daughter, he would giue her

of what degree ſoeuer, ſhould for her pouertie refuſe to
take her to wife: whereas if ſhe refuſed y• good offer, ſhe ſhould
therby be conſtrained through neceſſitie, either to beſtowe her
vpon ſome Artificer or Craftesman, or if ſhe would needes

but to be cruell towardes her owne daughter in

                   that

good hap whiche he did offer, beſides the fauour that he ſhould
be able to ſhew, in furthering her mariage, to bothe their ende
leſſe comfortes. The mother beeyng often ſollicited, and ſommoned
to this effect: and on the one ſide puniſhed with pouertie,
and on the other charged with yeres, bothe whiche preſſed
her verie muche, after diuers diſcourſes made to and fro with
her ſelf, laſtly ſhe ſaied. And whereto ought I to haue regard,
but to the wealth and profite of my daughter, whiche bothe ſhe
ſhall reape abondantly, if by y• giuyng her ſelf vnto this yong
Prince, he doeth beſtowe vpon her that dowrie, whiche he hath
promiſed. And although in doyng thereof there be ſome touch
and ſpot to my daughters honor and mine, yet ſhall it be ſo recompenſed
with the benefite of her dowrie, that the profit will
bee greater then the harme. And if therein be any offence, the

                  lame thereof is not to be imputed vnto me, but vnto my euill
Fortune, that hath brought me into this miſerable neceſſitie.
Beſides that my daughter beyng now alreadie xviii. yeres of
age, and of moſte ſingular beautie, and my ſelf alreadie ſo old,
that from daie to daie▪ I maie looke to goe to my graue, I
might happen to dye, and leaue her without any gouernemēt
or ouerſight, and ſhe ſtirred with thoſe appetites, wherto yong
folkes are enclined, through the frailtie of her ſexe, and the pouertie
wherein I ſhall leaue her, bee brought to yeeld her ſelf
into the handes of ſome ſuche one, as would not haue due regard
vnto her calling, but bring her vnto the ſpoile. And after
theſe and ſuche like diſcourſes, ſondrie times had: with her ſelf
finallie, ſhe ſent him woorde, that if it would pleaſe him, ſhe
would gladlie ſpeake with him herſelf: whiche he hauing vnderſtoode,
cauſed her to be brought one euenyng, into a place
where thei twoo alone might talke, and there hauyng giuen
her oportunitie, to ſaie what ſhe would, thus ſhe beganne.
               Sir, the weapons wherewith neceſſitie, and my pouertie

that I dare not for ſhaine lift vp

for aſmuche as no other thing hath perſwaded me therevnto,

               The firſte thing then ſir (ꝙ ſhe) that I thinke requiſite, is
that you come alone without any companie, when I ſhall aſſigne

               This courteous yong Prince was therewithall well content,
and that beyng concluded and agreed vpon, ſhe ſaied further,
I knowe (ſir) the honeſtie of my Daughter to bee ſuche,
that if I ſhould open my lippes vnto her, of any ſuche matter,
ſhe would not onely reiecte any perſwaſion, that I might vſe

leaſte that ſhould happen, and to the ende that you maie haue

if not withall the honour that the ſtate and calling, wherin
ſhe was borne dooeth require, yet with the leaſt harme that
maie bee poſſible, ſince my harde happe is ſuche, and that my
pouertie dooeth ſo conſtraine me: I haue determined to dooe
herein as you ſhall hea

My daughter vſeth to lye in a lowe Chamber neare vnto
the ſtreate doore of my houſe, in the whiche Chamber I my
ſelf in like ſorte am wont to lye, whenſoeuer we two remaine
alone in the houſe, as oftentimes we doe: and commonly I riſing
early in the mornyng about ſuche buſineſſe as I haue, do
leaue my daughter in bed, where ſhe ſleepeth ſome times two
howres or three after that I am gone. Tomorowe mornyng
therfore will I riſe and leaue her alone in that Chamber, and
will ſet open the ſtreate doore, ſo as you ſhall not neede but to
puſhe at it, and the chamber doore likewiſe. You ſhal come very
early as we haue concluded all alone, and entryng into the
Chamber, there ſhall you finde my daughter, and abide with
her as long as it ſhall pleaſe your ſelf. But I doe once againe
(ſir) beſeeche you as I haue doen before, that the matter maie
paſſe ſecrete, and not to bee imparted to any other then to vs
three, to the end, that where I ſuffer my ſelf to be led through
neceſſitie to doe that which I doe, and with an entent to place
my daughter in mariage, by the meane of that dowrie whiche
you doe giue her, the caſe beyng knowne, wee reape not eternall
ſhame and infamie.
               At this deuiſe the yong Prince pauſed a while, thinkyng
it ſtraunge that he ſhould goe to a yong maide, that not onely
was vnwillyng, but alſo not ſo muche as made priuie of his
commyng, did what he could to refuſe that meane, and to
perſwade the mother to deuiſe ſome better. But at the laſt ſeyng
none other could be founde more fitte for the purpoſe, beyng
pricked forwarde with the vehemencie of that appetite,
whiche loue had ſtirred vp in him, conſideryng himſelf to be a
Prince, and a gallant yong Gentleman, and that he ſhould be
alone with his loue, thought that it ſhould not be hard for hym
to winne her to his will: and ſo content to doe as the old Gentlewoman
had deuiſed. And beyng parted each from other, he
began to attende the commyng of the nexte mornyng and all
that night, whiche ſeemed longer vnto him then a hole yere, he
lay with his thoughtes and imaginations, in the armes of his
Lucilla. As ſone as the daie began to peepe, Don Hercules all
alone as he had promiſed to the mother, went to the houſe of

his Ladie, and findyng the doores open according to promiſe,
entered into the Chamber wherein Lucilla laie, and hauyng
barred the doore, approched nere the bedde wherein ſhe laie.
               It was in the Moneth of Iulie, whiche ſeaſon in that
Countrie is extreame hotte: by reaſon whereof Lucilla tumblyng
from one ſide of the bedde vnto the other, had rolled of
all the clothes wherewith ſhe had been couered: ſo as ſhe had
left her ſelf all naked, and in that ſorte he found her, with Coralles
about her necke and her armes, whiche with the difference
of their ruddie colour did ſett out and beautifie greatly
the excellent faireneſſe of her white bodie. She laie a ſleepe
vpon her backe, with her handes caſt ouer her head, (as for the
moſte parte yong women are wont to doe): ſo that forthwith
the yong Prince diſcoured her from toppe to toe: and conſidering
with a greedie eye all her whole bodie, not onely he commended
her to hym ſelf ſo naked, as he had doen whileſt ſhe
was apparailed, but alſo did ſo ſingulary well like her in that
ſtate, that he thought he ſaw rather ſome diuine thing, or ſome
Goddeſſe come doune from Heauen, to heape hym with happineſſe,
then a mortall creature: and beganne to allowe and
commende his owne iudgement, in that he had placed his
loue vppon ſo excellente and rare a peece. And therewith bowyng
doune hym ſelf to giue her a kiſſe, and ſo to awake her.
Beholde ſhe opened her eyes, whiche right well reſembled
two faire ſhinyng Starres. And where ſhe was vſed to ſee
none other bodie in that Chamber but her mother when ſhe
waked, now ſeyng this yong Prince ſtandyng this ouer her,
and findyng her ſelf in that ſorte all naked, ſhe gaue a greate
ſkritche, and ſaied.
               Out alas ſir (for ſhe knewe hym ſtraight waie) what euill
happe hath brought you hether at this tyme? And in ſo ſaiyng
as one wonderfully aſhamed to bee ſeene in that plight, ſhe
wrapped about her one of the ſheetes, and began with a loude
voyce to call her mother.
               But perceiuing that her mother would not heare, and that
ſhe called in vaine, ſhe began to imagine that ſhe was conſentyng
vnto his commyng thether, and lamentyng with teares

that trickled doune her cheekes, like drops of dewe hanging
vppon Roſes, in a Maie mornyng, ſhe ſaied: Alas now I ſee
my mother alſo hath betraied me. Whiche thyng the young
Prince vnderſtandyng, ſaied vnto her. Trouble not your ſelf,
nor greeue not (faire Damſell) at my comming hether, but
rather reioyce, that your ſinguler beautie, hath ſo inflamed
me, as one in a maner forgettyng my eſtate, haue beene contented
to come hether all alone, as a priuate man to enioye
your companie, if it will pleaſe you to accepte my good will,
whiche though a thouſande other Dames of this Citie, doe
wiſhe and would be glad of, yet haue I deemed none of them
worthie thereof but your ſelf. And ſeeyng your Mother, who
hath that power ouer you, that in reaſon ſhe ought to haue ouer
her childe, and knoweth beſt what is for your good and
commoditie, doeth conſent herevnto: you (in my iudgement)
are not but to ſhewe your ſelf in like ſorte content. For in giuyng
your ſelf to me, you doe not abaſe or caſt your ſelf awaie
vpon any vilde perſone: but ſhewe your ſelf courteous vnto a
Prince, whom your beautie hath made thrall: and in whom
you ſhall finde nothing but gratefull curteſie, to your benefite
and ſatiſfaction.
               And with theſe and other like woordes ſtetched forthe his
hande towarde her breaſtes, that were like two little balles of
Iuorie, and drawing nere her to kiſſe her, ſhe with her hande
thruſ
                     •
                  yng hym modeſtly backe, ſaied thus.
               Sir I beſeech you, by the Princely nobilitie that is in you,
and by that loue whiche you ſaie you beare me, that it will
pleaſe you, not to force me, or to ſeeke at my handes any thing
againſt my will: and that ſince my mother, who ought to haue
been the cheef defender of myne honeſtie, hath abandoned and
forſaken me, you will yet of your courteſie vouchſafe, to giue
me the hearyng of a fewe wordes, whiche the ſpeciall care I
haue of myne honour doeth force me to expreſſe.
               The courteous yong Prince at this requeſt, ſtaied hym
ſelf proceedyng any further: and not beeyng deſirous to haue
her, but with her owne good will, ſtoode ſtill to heare what it
was that Lucilla would ſaie vnto hym: yet euer hopyng, with

faire meanes to winne her at the laſt. And ſhe weepyng very
tenderly, beganne to ſaie vnto hym in this ſorte.
               I am very ſorie (moſte noble Prince ꝙ ſhe) that Fortune
hath been ſo muche myne enemie, that ſhe hath made me a
woman, farre vnworthie and vnmeete for you: For that you
being ſo great a Prince as you are, and I ſo meane a Gentlewoman:
I ſee ſo greate a ſpace and diſtaunce betweene your
high eſtate, and my lowe degree, that betweene vs there can
bee no portion, or conuenient equalitie: For the whiche cauſe
(ſir) I conſidering myne owne eſtate, and not mindyng to exceede
my calling, haue a good while ſince choſen Nicander to
be my Louer, who in reſpect of his bloud, though he be richer
then I, is no whitte nor more nobly borne then my ſelf am.
By reaſon of whiche conformitie of bloud and birth, our loue
is likewiſe growne to bee equall, and equall the deſire in vs
bothe, he to haue me to his wife, and I to haue hym for my
houſbande. But the couetouſneſſe (let it bee lawfull for me to
ſaie ſo) of his father is ſuche, that although he knoweth me to
be a Gentlewomā borne, yet becauſe I am not of that wealth
as to bryng hym ſo greate a dowrie, as his riches perchaunce
require, he deſpiſeth me, and will not yeeld by any perſwaſion
his good will and conſent, that wee maie matche together accordyng
to our deſire. Neuertheleſſe (ſir) I conſideryng how
feruently this yong Gentleman loueth me, and that alreadie
we are in mynd vnited and knit together, with conſent, faithe
and loue, doe yet beleeue aſſuredly, that GOD of his ſpeciall
goodneſſe and fauour, will graunt vs his aſſured grace, that
we maie one daie bee ioyned together in the holy ſtate of Matrimonie.
Which thyng if it ſhould happen and come to paſſe,
I not hauyng any thyng els to bryng with me for my dowrie
but my virginitie, am determined & fully reſolued (by Gods
help) to giue it vnto hym, as pure and vnſpotted as I brought
it from my mothers wombe. And if my vnhappie chaūce and
Fortune be ſuch, as that I cannot haue Nicander to my houſband,
I haue concluded with my ſelf (by the grace of God neuer
to couple my ſelf to any man liuyng: but to giue and vowe
me wholie vnto almightie GOD, and in his ſeruice to ſpend

my daies a virgine, in continuall Faſting and Praier. Therefore
(moſte excellent Prince) if Honeſtie, if Iuſtice, if Religion,
haue that power and force in your noble mynde, whiche in
reaſon thei ought to haue, I do beſeech you, and for that loues
ſake that you ſaie you beare me, that you will preſerue and
keep vnſtained my honeſtie, and that it would pleaſe you with
the ſound diſcourſe of reaſon, to temper that feruent appetite
whiche hath brought you hether, to the preiudice and breache
of my honeſtie and credite. In doyng whereof you ſhall ſhewe
your ſelf to be, in deede that noble Prince that the highneſſe of
your birthe and bloud doeth promiſe you ſhould be, whereas if
you ſhould force and violate me a Virgine, and a weake maiden
without defence, there could thereof enſue nought els to
me but diſhonor and reproche, and withall ſmall praiſe would
it be vnto your excellencie, when it ſhall be ſaied that you had
ouercome a ſimple Damſel. And here being interrupted with
ſobbes and teares exceedyng for the greefe of her mynde, caſting
doune her eyes for ſhame and ſorow, ſhe helde her peace,
attendyng what her hap & the goodneſſe of the Prince ſhould
diſpoſe of her, in whoſe courteſie ſhe had repoſed all her hope
and confidence.
               This yong Prince vnderſtanding the honeſt deſire of Lucilla,
firſt praiſed her greatly to hymſelf for the chaſtnes of her
minde, and being moued with the magnanimitie of his noble
minde, though he were pricked with the ſharpeſt darte of the
blind boyes quiuer, and that his ardent appetite did ſtill ſtirre
hym to the accompliſhment of his deſire, yet conquering hym
ſelf with reaſon, he turned al the loue whiche erſt he bare vnt
                     •
                  
this young Ladie, into compaſſion of her eſtate, and thus he
ſaied vnto her. The vertue and honeſtie of thy mynde faire
Damſell doe require, that I ſhould make no leſſe accompt of
thine honour, then if I were come hether to no other entent,
then to defende it againſt any other that ſhould goe aboute to
ſtaine or ſpot it. Therefore not onely thou needeſt not to feare
any violence at my handes, but alſo maieſt hope that I will
not faile to further this thy chaſt purpoſe, ſo that thou maieſt
enioye that yong Gentleman whiche thou haſt choſen for thy

houſbande, with al the honour and ſatiſfaction that appertaineth
to the honeſtie of thy minde. And therefore, 
                     〈◊〉
                   nothing
els doeth let thee from the gettyng of him but the pouertie of
thy ſtate, whereunto thy frowarde Fortune hath vnworthilie
brought thee: I will my ſelf ſupplie in that behalf, that wherein
ſhe hath failed, and correcte with my liberalitie, the iniurie
that ſhe hath doen thee. And hauyng ſo ſaied, he hymſelf opened
the doore and called her mother, who had gotten her ſelf
into a Chamber, and there ſate bewailyng the miſerie of her
ſtate, wherein ſhe had bin driuen in ſuche ſorte to prepare a
dowrie for her daughter.
               She beyng come he ſaied vnto her. Gentlewoman, if erſt
I came hether as a louer vnto your daughter, now I will departe
and leaue her as if I were her brother, leauyng her honour
no leſſe ſafe and vntouched then I founde it, for ſo deſerueth
her vertue that I ſhould deale with her. And for aſmuch,
as I perceiue ſhe is in loue with a yong Gentleman whom I
well knowe, and is in my opinion very worthie of it, and that

                     〈◊〉
                   in like ſorte is in loue with her, and that onely the want of
a reaſonable dowrie is the cauſe that ſhe can not become his
wife as ſhe deſireth. I am content to beſtowe vpon her for her
contentment, that ſumme for her dowrie whiche I had purpoſed
to haue giuen her in recompence of my cōtentation, to the
ende that this her honeſt deſire maie haue that effect, whiche
is moſte conuenient to ſo greate and well grounded an affection,
& that her great honeſtie and vertue doe deſerue. Therefore
ſende you this daie vnto my Treaſorer, and he ſhall forth
with diſburſe vnto you 2000. pounde, whiche ſhalbe the dowrie
of this your gentle and honeſt daughter.
               And turnyng himſelf towarde the young Gentlewoman,
he ſaid vnto her. And as for you faire Damſell (ꝙ he) I craue
nothing els now at your handes, but that you keepe this faith
of yours, wherwith you are lincked vnto your louer inuiolate
and vnſpotted, euen as I doe leaue you inuiolate and vnſpotted
in your mothers handes. How greate the ioye of the mother
was, when ſhe ſawe the honeſtie of her daughter (as it
were) reſaued out of this yong Princes handes, by the force of

her owne vertue, maie better he imagined then expreſſed with
wordes. But aboue all ioyes, the ioye of Lucilla exceeded all
other: when ſhe vnderſtoode that through the magnificence
and liberalitie of the noble yong Prince, ſhe was to haue her
Nicander for her houſbande.
               And tournyng her eyes full of modeſtie towardes him ſhe
ſaied, I could not (Sir) haue had any more certaine and infallible
token of your loue towarde me, then that whiche now
of your greate courteſie and bountie you haue ſhewed me:
whiche I acknowledge to bee ſo greate, that I am bounde to
yeeld your excellencie my moſt humble and infinite thankes.
But for aſmuche as wordes doe faile me wherewith I might
doe it, I muſt beſeeche you, that it maie reſte in your diſcrete
Iudgement, to conſider how muche I confeſſe my ſelf to bee
your debter, when woordes doe faile me, to yeelde you at the
leaſt thankes for ſo greate a benefite. This onely will I ſaie
vnto your Grace, that the remembraunce of ſo noble an acte
ſhall neuer weare out of my minde: and that I will ſo long as
I liue, praie vnto almightie GOD, ſo to preſerue and maintaine
your noble perſone, as you of your goodneſſe haue ſaued
myne honeſtie: And ſo to graunt you the accompliſhment of
all your noble deſires, as you haue offered me to make me cō
                  tent
of myne, by hauyng my Nicander to bee my houſbande:
Vnto whom, aſwell becauſe I haue euer been ſo diſpoſed, as
for that it hath pleaſed your excellencie to commaunde me, I
will alwaies keepe ſounde and vnſtained that faithe, whiche
through your courteſie ſhall ioyne me to him in mariage.
               The Damſell ſeemed vnto the Prince at that inſtaunt to
bee in maner greater then ſhe was in deede, when ſhe once
ſtoode aſſured of the ſauegarde of her honeſtie: and delighting
no leſſe in the excellencie of her mynd, then he had before doen
in the beautie of her bodie, he departed from her.
               And hauyng cauſed the two thouſande pounde to be paied
vnto her mother as he had promiſed: he went vnto the Duke
his father, and tolde hym all that had paſſed betweene Lucilla
and hym: the maner whereof liked ſo well the Duke, that he
concluded with hymſelf, that all the vertues that euer had

been before that tyme in his progenitours, would bee moſt excellently
ioyned in hym.
               This yong Prince required his father, to ſende for Nicanders
father, and to perſwade hym to agree, that his Sonne
might match with Lucilla, ſince that ſhe was prouided and furniſhed
with ſo reaſonable a dowrie: whiche thyng the Duke
did with a very good will, for that he knewe that if his ſonne
ſhould haue taken in hande, to perſwade the olde man to any
ſuche matter, it might haue ſtirred ſome ſuſpition in his head,
why the Prince ſhould ſo doe? And hauing ſent for hym accordyngly,
when he was come, the Duke after ſome familiare
ſpeeches of courſe and courteſie, tolde hym he was deſirous
that his ſonne Nicander ſhould take Lucilla to bee his wife,
who aſwell for her birthe, as for the rare giftes of her mynde,
(as he had learned) was worthie to be wife to any great Lord.
The olde Gentleman aunſwered, that although ſhe had thoſe
vertues and giftes whiche he ſpake of, and were very well

                     •
                  orne, yet had ſhe not any dowrie conuenient, or agreeable to
his wealthe, whereby ſhe might deſerue to bee matched with
his ſonne. Yes Marie ſaied the Duke, for I my ſelf becauſe I
would not haue ſo greate vertue as is in her, to bee oppreſſed
by Fortunes ſpight, haue beſtowed vppon her two thouſande
pounde to ſerue for her dowrie.
               The olde man hearyng of ſuche a ſomme, was very well
content to doe as the Duke would haue hym, and the nexte
daie through the liberalitie of the Prince, the mariage was
concluded and knitte vp, whiche had ſo long been delaied and
hindered by the coueteouſneſſe of the olde man, and the pouertrie
of Lucilla, with the infinite ioye and contentment of the
two yong Louers, who had long wiſhed and deſired that happie
daie.
               What vertue, or what continence of Alexander, or of Scipio
may be compared to this? Scipio abſtained from the yong
Gentlewoman whiche was preſented vnto hym in Spayne:
Alexander from Darius his daughter. But it was very eaſie
for either of them ſo to doe: aſwell becauſe thei were in the furie
of Warre, and the ſoundes of Drummes and Trumpets:

as for that thoſe women were of a ſtraunge Nation, and enemies
vnto them, and neuer before that tyme ſeen of any of thē,
muche leſſe deſired. Whereas this yong prince, who euen bathing
as it were in bliſſe, liuing at his eaſe and pleaſure, in the
flower of his youthe, and in the heate of his amourous flames,
had a yong Gentlewoman of a rare beautie, not of ſtraunge
Nation, or any otherwiſe to be hated, but extremely beloued,
in his handes, and voluntarily yeelded, and committed vnto
him by her owne mother: and yet not onelie tempered himſelf
and refrained to defile her chaſte and honeſt bodie, but alſo beſtowed
liberallie her dowrie vppon her, to the ende that an other
might enioye her, and bee her houſebande, whom ſhe had
choſen to loue and like of: did without all queſtion farr excede
all humaine courteſie, in ſo Noble and ſo vertuous an acte.
Whereby he made apparaunt, that although he were pricked
forward, with the ſharpe ſpurres of Loue, and his ſenſuall appetite,
yet was he of that highneſſe of courage, and of that cō
                  ſtancie
of mind, that he was able not onely to cōquer himſelf,
but alſo to ſubue the forces of Loue, wherevnto bothe mortal
                     •
                  
mennes valour doeth commonlie yeelde, and the verie power
of the Goddes themſelues (if wee ſhall beleeue the Fables of
the auncient writers) hath ſhewed it ſelf often times inferior.
               And thus this honeſte Damſell Lucilla, by the meanes of
her Chaſtitie, the vertue and excellencie whereof, did winne
and Maiſter the harte of that yong Prince, muche more then
the perfection of her bodilie beautie had doen before, obtained
the thyng ſhe moſte deſired and ioyed in, whiche was to haue
Nicander to her houſebande. With whom ſhe liued euer after
in greate contentment and happineſſe: ſtill nouriſhyng
with kinde and louyng demeanour eche to other,
that feruente affection, whiche from their
firſte acquaintaunce, had taken
full poſſeſſion of bothe
their liberties.

               Of Fineo and Fiamma.
               
                  The Argument of the iiij. Hiſtorie.
                  ¶The hard aduentures of Fineo, with his beloued Fiamma,
who after ſondrie conflictes of Fortune, were
in the ende ſolde as ſlaues to the Kyng of Tuniſe, who
ſeyng their perfecte loue, cauſed them to bee Maried,
and after honouryng them with ſondrie preſentes, ſent
them home to Sauona, whereby their Parentes and
freendes, thei were ioyfully receiued.
               
               
                  IN Genoua, one of the faireſt and
moſte famous Citees in Italie,
there was ſometime a yong gentlewoman
of excellente beautie,
called Fiamma, that was in loue
with a yong Gentleman of Gauona
(a Citee Subiecte vnto the
State of Genoua, and diſtaunte
from thence about thirtie miles)
whoſe name was Fineo, and their Loue beeyng mutuall, and
tendyng to no other ende, then to bee linked and ioyned together
by Marriage, thei would not long haue ſtaied, to bryng
their honeſt deſires to a good ende and concluſion, had not the
Father of the Gentlewoman refuſed his conſent, and ſhewed
himſelf contrarie to this their loue and good will. For he miſlikyng
with the matche, either for that he purpoſed to place
her better, or becauſe he would not haue her Married to any
man, that ſhould carie her out of Genoua, did ofte times chide
and reprehende his Daughter, for caſtyng her affection vpon
that yong Gentleman, that was a ſtraunger vnto theim, and
in effecte but a ſubiecte, though he were bothe of bloud and richeſſe
equall vnto them.
               But for all that the father could do, or any other of her frendes,

the fire which loue had kindled in this yong couples breaſtes,
ſlaked no whit at all, but ſtill increaſed, bothe hopyng in
the ende, to win her freendes good will, and attain the fruites
of their deſired loue. This yong Damſell had to her brother a
ſtout & valiant yong gentleman, who beyng offended greatly
that Fineo ſhould continue his loue toward his ſiſter, and followe
the purſute of that, whiche he knew well inough, her frē
                  des
were vnwilling to yeld vnto: had cauſed him to be ſpoken
vnto, and to be warned that he ſhould deſiſt, and leaue to ſollicite
her: but he for all that ceaſed not, but continued his ſuite:
wherefore this brother of hers determined, to make him leaue
of, by force and dint of Sworde. For although there were at
that time a verie ſtraight lawe in the citee, that no man ſhould
were his ſworde, and paine of death appointted for hym, that
ſhould hurte any man with any weapon: yet bothe theſe Gentlemen
weare their ſwordes, for that thei bothe had charge of
ſouldiers, that laie then in garriſon for defence of the Citee.
               And hauing one daie mette Fineo in the ſtreate alone, and
himſelf beyng verie well accompanied with other gentlemen
he began to giue him euill language: and beyng a gentlema
                     •
                  
of greate courage, and though he were a ſtraunger there, 
                     〈◊〉
                  
beyng able to endure to be iniured in wordes, ſaid to him boldly
and roundly againe, that if thei twoo were alone, he durſte
not vſe thoſe ſpeeches vnto hym, for he would well giue hym
to vnderſtande, that he was no man to take wrong at his handes,
and that time and occaſion would ſerue one daie (he doubted
not to make hym knowe, that he had offended one that
would beare no Coales. Wherevpon his aduerſarie hauyng
drawne forthe his Sworde, whileſt he was yet ſpeakyng, ran
feercely vpon hym, thinkyng to haue ſtriken hym: But Fineo
alſo a verie luſtie gentleman and quicke of eye, and nimble of
hande, drewe out his ſworde, and not onely warded the blowe
of his enemie, but alſo hurte hym, though but lightlie in the
hand. Forthwith thei that were with the yong gentlewomans
brother, enuironed him, and tooke him priſoner, and deliuered
hym into the handes of the Magiſtrate, or cheef officer of the
Citee. And the penaltie beyng ſuche, as is before mentioned,

for hurtyng of any man within the Citee, and eſpecially a gē
                  tleman,
Fineo was condemned to loſe his hedde.
               Neuertheleſſe, he beyng verie well freinded, and ſupported
by many principall gentlemen of the Citee, thei laboured ſo
muche for him, that thei obtained, that he ſhould not be behedded:
but that his penaltie ſhould bee conuerted vnto an other
puniſhement, verie little better if it were no worſe. For hauing
bound him faſte hande and foote, thei laied him in a ſmal
Boate, and in verie ſtormie weather, ſet him in the maine ſea,
and there left him to the rule and gouernment of Fortune, and
to the diſpoſitiō of God, and mercie of the waues and windes.
The boate was a long while beatē and toſſed, by the rage and
furie of the Seas, and poore Fineo vnder diuerſe and ſondrie
ſtormes and ſhapes, had before his eyes a thouſande times the
preſence of Death. Yet in that fearfull and mortall perill, he
ceaſed not to call vpon the name of his deare Fiamma, and in
that extreamitie and imminent daunger, did he yet in maner
glorifie himſelf, and thinke himſelf happie, that he ſhould ende
his life for the loue of his Ladie.
               Whiles he was thus toſſed and tormented, ſtill lookyng
for none other but preſent death. the Tempeſt began to ceaſe,
and the ſtorme and rage of Seas to bee aſſwaged. When loe
he diſcouered a Fregate of Moores that went a roauyng, and
were then 
                     〈◊〉
                   gone abroade, to ſpie whether the Storme
which was then paſt, had not happely prepared for them, ſome
occaſion of gaine and bootie. Theſe Moores had no ſooner diſcouered
this little boate, thus fleetyng at all aduentures, but
hoping to finde therein ſome prey for their prfiote, thei made
toward it: And hauing at the boordyng thereof, founde Fineo
bounde hande and foote, and perceiuing by his countenaunce
and apparell, that he was no verie baſe perſone, thei vntied
hym, and ſette hym in their Fregate as a ſlaue to rowe, vntill
ſuche time as thei ſhould determine further what to doe with
hym: who although that ſeruitude and captiuitie, were greeuous
vnto him, yet conſideryng with himſelf, that it was better
for hym to be in the power of men, though thei were Infidells,
then in the power of Seas and Windes: he comforted

hymſelf, that yet if he liued, he might ſtill hope throngh the
goodneſſe of God, one daie to be ſo hapie, as to enioye his Ldie
and Loue: he framed himſelf to beare with pacie
                     •
                  t minde,
that heauie yoke of his captiuitie.
               
                  Fiamma hauing vnderſtoode the vnfortunate accident happened
to her Louer, beleeuyng certainly that he was dedde,
and that ſhe ſhould neuer ſee hym againe. Wherefore ſhe her
ſelf reſoluyng, that ſhe would no longer liue, gaue her ſelf to
deuiſe what kinde of death ſhe were beſt to chuſe, and in doubt
thereof ſhe paſſed ſome fewe daies, diſſemblyng ſtill in the
houſe her ſorrowe and greef, with a merie and chearfull countenance,
as though ſhe had cleane forgotten, and not once remembred
her Louer Fineo. But in the ende, after long debatyng
with her ſelf, ſhe reſolued to dye theſame kinde of death,
and to make that ende, whiche ſhe imagined Fineo had doen.
               There was an other Gentleman of the Citee, who was no
leſſe enamoured of this Gentlewoman, then Fineo was: who
ſuppoſing that now ſince ſhe ſawe there was no remedie for
her, to recouer her louer, whom bothe ſhe and all the Citee, accoumpted
certainly to be dedde: he might perchaunce by ſute
obtaine her good will, and ſo procure her to bee his wife, with
the conſent of her freendes. And therefore not long after the
miſchaunce of Fineo, he cauſed her father to bee dealt withall
for the beſtowyng of his daughter vpon hym: and the Father
beeyng willyng enough to agree therevnto, and hauyng queſtioned
with his daughter therevpon, and findyng her to giue
ſober and obedient anſwere with fewe wordes, preſuppoſing
that ſhe was willyng to doe as he would haue her, made promiſe
of her vnto this yong Gentleman, and agreed vpon the
dowrie, and all other circumſtaunces neceſſarie, for the coupling
of twoo ſuche perſones together.
               The night that wente before the daie appoincted for their
Marriage, Fiamma callyng vnto her a Moore, that was ſlaue
in her fathers houſe, and had the keepyng of a ſmall Boate of
the Gentlemans, wherein when he liſte to diſport hymſelf, he
was wont to take the aire vpon the ſea, in tyme of faire weather,
and to goe to their houſes of pleaſure, whereof that coaſt

is verie plentifull, and theim of exceadyng beautie. Whiche
Moore had liued ſo many yeres in that thraldome, that he was
now become ſo old, as ſhe thought, ſhe needed not to feare any
force or violence at his handes, ſhe began to perſwade hym, to
putte on a deſire to deliuer hymſelf out of Captiuitie, ſo as he
might liue the reſte of his yeres in libertie, and at his eaſe:
wherevnto findyng hym readie and willyng, if the meanes or
occaſion were offred hym: ſhe gaue him in hand a good round
ſomme of money, whiche ſhe had laied together, and made
hym promiſe to carrie her into the Sea in the Boate, whereof
he had the cuſtodie, and afterwardes to doe, that whatſoeuer it
were, that ſhe ſhould commaunde hym.
               This wicked and faithleſſe Moore, ſeyng himſelf not onely
to purchaſe his libertie, but alſo make ſo greate againe of readie
money, that he was not like at any tyme after, to liue in
want or pouertie, was onely thankfull in his minde towarde
the yong Gentlewoman, but ſtraight waie began to purpoſe
and to deuiſe, to make a greater gaine of her owne perſone, by
carriyng her vnto the kyng of Tuniſe, and ſellyng of her vnto
hym at a verie high priſe. And with this entention, the miſcheeuous
knaue aſſured her, that he would doe in all pointes,
as ſhe would haue hym. Wherefore, when all the reſte of the
houſe were in their firſte fleape, the Damſell with this wretched
Moore, went out of her fathers hous, and gather into the
Boate, and the weather beyng verie faire, the knaue began to
rowe, and make ſaile along the coaſte toward Ligorno, from
whiche by breake of the daie, thei were not verie farre. When
this yong gentlewoman, ſawe that ſhe was now ſo farr from
home, that ſhe needed not to feare, to be driuen backe again to
Genoua, ſhe willed the Moore to rowe to y• ſhore, and to land
himſelf, and then to ſhoue of the Boate againe: for that her determination
was ſo to dye, ſwallowed vp with the waues of
the ſea, as ſhe ſuppoſed her Fineo to haue been. But the wicked
knaue, who had a father fetche in his hed, and thoughtes farre
differed from the Gentlewomans, made her beleeue that thei
were yet nere vnto Genoua, and aduiſed her to bee contente,
that thei might goe ſomewhat farther, to the ende that her father

if he ſent after them, might not ouertake them.
               Neuertheleſſe, ſhe hauyng often tymes vrged hym to doe
as ſhe erſte bad hym, and he ſtill protracted the tyme, and ſhiftyng
her of with one tale or an other: ſhe began to ſuſpect his
drift. The Mornyng therefore beyng well ſpent, ſhe made as
though ſhe would haue looked ouer the Boate ſide, into the
Water, or haue waſhed her handes in the Sea, and on the ſodaine
would haue caſte her ſelf ouer boarde. But the craftie
Moore ſuſpectyng her intente, caught holde of her aboute the
middle, and not onely held her from throwing her ſelf into the
Sea, but alſo bound her faſte hande and foote, and wheras ſhe
of her courteſie, had bothe ſet hym at libertie, and liberally beſtowed
good ſtore of wealthe vppon hym, he as a treacherous
Infidell, bereued her of her libertie, makyng her an vnfortunate
Slaue vnder his diſpoſition, and beeyng moued with a
greedy couetous minde, thought that too little whiche ſhe had
giuen hym, and therefore determined (as is afore ſaied) to ſell
her perſone, and to encreaſe his goodes by that meanes.
               The deſolate Damſell, when ſhe ſawe her ſelf ſo vſed by
that villaine, full of woe and greefe, ceaſed not to rebuke the
vilde Caitiue, that little regarded her ſpeeches, the breach of
his Faithe and promiſe, and blamyng her ſelf for truſtyng of
hym: and then repented when it was too late, that ſhe had not
obeied her Father, and followed the aduiſe of her freendes, ſhe
beganne to curſe her Deſtinie, and her cruell Fortune, and to
crie out vpon the Heauens, that had made her become the vnfortunateſt
yong woman, that euer loued man.
               And whileſt ſhe was thus lamentyng her harde happe, and
the Moore as faſte as he could with his Owres, labouryng to
ſpeede his voiage: A little Foiſte or Galley of Moores, that
wente prollyng vp and doune the Coaſte, hauyng eſpied the
ſmall Boate, drewe nere vnto it, and boorded it. And hauyng
founde this yong Gentlewoman beeyng bounde therein, thei
would haue taken her awaie: but the old knaue offeryng to
reſiſt them, and to kepe her out of their handes, thei toke her awaie
from him perforce, and wounding him very ſore. And aſked
of her in their language, from whence ſhe came, and what

ſhe was: but ſhe not vnderſtanding them, could make them no
aunſwere, but onely with teares and weepyng, make them to
vnderſtande, that ſhe was a wofull and vnfortunate damſell.
But the old Moore feelyng hymſelf wounded to death, before
he died tolde theim, bothe of what place and Parentage ſhe
was, and laied before theim by plaine reaſon, how greate a
bootie thei might accoumpte thei had made that Mornyng, if
thei did carrie her vnto the king of Tuniſe (as he had thought
to haue doen) and ſell her vnto hym. He beyng dedde, thei diſpoiled
him, and tooke from hym all that, whiche Fiamma had
giuen, and ſo he hauyng thought by treacherie, and breakyng
of his faithe, to make greate gaine, loſte bothe his life, and all
that whiche he had gotten, of the vnaduiſed and euill counſelled
yong Gentlewoman. And hauyng placed her in their
Foiſte, and cōforted her as well as thei could, thei tooke their
waie ſtraight toward Tuniſe.
               
               It fortuned that the other Fregate of Moores, that had
founde and taken Fineo (as is alreadie ſaied before) met with
this other. Foiſte or Gallie, wherein Fiamma was, and aſſaulted
it, and hauyng fought together a good while) for that the
other reſiſted, and defended them ſelues ſtoutely) in fine, the
Fregate wherein Fineo was) who in the encounter, and during
the fight, had ſhewed greate valour emong the reſt) ouercame
the other, and tooke from them all that thei had: ſo that
Fiamma and Fineo were bothe now together, in the compaſſe
of one ſmall veſſell. And although in that extreamitie of bothe
their euill fortunes, it was a great comfort for theſe twoo Louers
to ſee one the other, and that bothe longed and deſired extremely,
to imbrace eche other, and to tell the one to the other
their accidentes, and vnfortunate aduentures. Neuertheleſſe
Fineo made ſignes to Fiamma, that in nowiſe ſhe ſhould take
knowledge, or acquaintaunce of him, and accordyngly ſhe diſſembled
and made no ſhewe, but as one had neuer ſeen hym.
               
                  Fineo for the valoure and courage, whiche he had ſhewed
in the battaile, was deliuered of his chaines, and muche made
of emong the Moores, vntill ſuche tyme as thei had conducted
bothe him and her (as thei did verie ſhortly after) vnto the

kyng of Tuniſe. Who hauyng ſeen and conſidered Fineo, and
vnderſtoode by the Pirates, that his comely perſonage was
accompanied with greate valour, brought him, and tooke him
to his ſeruice, in good place nere his owne perſone. And beeyng
moued with the beautie of the yong Gentlewoman, bargained
for her likewiſe, for a greate ſomme of money, and cauſed
her to be put in the Cube, whiche is a place where he keepeth
his Concubines (as the Turke dooeth his in his Serraqlio)
emong a greate many of other women, and eſteemed her
verie muche, for that the Rouers (who had learned of thoſe other
that thei ouercame) all that whiche the olde Moore had
declared vnto theim, of her callyng and condition, did aſſure
hym that ſhe was a Gentlewoman, borne of a noble Familie
in Genoua.
               
               
                  Fineo by his ſeruice and diſcrite behauiour, became in
ſhorte tyme verie deare vnto the kyng, ſo that in leſſe then the
ſpace of one whole yere, the kyng of ſpeciall truſt, gaue hym
the charge of the gate of the Cube, whiche office the kynges
of Tuniſe are neuer wont to giue, but vnto ſuche as are in ſingular
fauour about them: In the whiche Fineo to his greate
contentmente, had the commoditie daiely to ſee his Fiamma,
and ſhe had no leſſe comforte and ſatſfaction, to beholde and
looke vpon hym, whiche oportunitie thei enioyed, and handeled
ſo diſcritely, that thei neuer gaue any cauſe of ſuſpition to
any perſone, of their feruent good will and affection.
               The maner or cuſtome of the Kyng, was to cauſe his
Concubines to come vnto hym, and to lye with them by order
as thei had been bought, or come to his handes: By reaſon of
whiche cuſtome, for that there were verie many bought before
the commyng thether of Fiamma, there was alreadie a whole
yere and halfe, well nye paſte after her ſale, and yet her turne
was not come to be called for. But remainyng now but three
others, to be brought vnto the kyng before her. Fineo conſideryng
to his intollerable greef, that ſhe was ere it were long,
to bee likewiſe called for, began to bee tormented with incredible
paſſion, and an guiſhe of minde: and his woe increaſed
ten thouſande folde, by feare and imagination whiche he conceiued,

that ſhe beyng aboue all the kinges Concubines farre
the faireſt, when he had once enioyed her, he would take her to
bee one of his wiues, whiche feare did no whit leſſe tormente
and afflicte Fiamma, then it did her Louer.
               Whileſt bothe theſe yong Louers liued in this ſorte, there
chaunced to arriue at Tuniſe a Ship of Sauona, with certaine
Marchauntes of that Citee: who ſeyng Fineo there, and knowing
hym, were wonderfully amcruailed findyng hym aliue,
for that he had been lamented at Sauona, of all his frendes for
dedde. Fineo likewiſe knowyng thoſe Marchauntes, and hauyng
aucthoritie and meanes to pleaſure them in the Court,
welcomed them, and made muche of them in frendly ſort: and
demaunding of the ſtate and welfare of his father, and brother
and other freendes, thei certified hym that thei were all well,
and that when thei ſhould vnderſtande that he was aliue, and
in ſo good a caſe, thei would be verie ioyfull, and thinke theim
ſelues happie, if thei might hope to ſee hym once come again,
as thei doubted not but one daie he would and might.
               Theſe Marchauntes hauing diſpatched their buſineſſe departed
thence, and by them Fineo wrote letters to his Father,
and to his brother, certifiyng them of his beyng at Tuniſe, and
how that Fiamma was with him, and that he deſired to deliuer
hymſelf 
                     〈◊〉
                   of bondage, and her with hym: Whiche thyng he
thought he might eaſily bryng to paſſe, if his brother would
come thither, and withall deſcribed vnto them a plot, whiche
he had caſte for the execution of his intent and deſire.
               Thei beyng retourned ſafe vnto Sauona, deliuered the letters
vnto the father and brother of Fineo, who with the reſt of
of his freendes, and in effecte all the whole Citee, were verie
glad that his Fortune had not been altogether ſo froward toward
hym, as thei had ſuppoſed.
               And his brother accordyng to his inſtructions, prepared a
verie pretie Fregate, verie well appoincted and furniſhed
with Marchaundize, emong whiche there were many trifles,
and thynges of price meete for Ladies and Gentlewomen.
And beyng arriued therewith a a Tuniſe, Fineo brought them
vnto the Kyng, whom thei preſented with ſome thynges of

ſmall price, whiche were verie gratefull, and acceptable vnto
him, and emong other ſpeeches thei ſaied, that thei had aborde
many pretie thinges for Dames and Ladiee, which thing the
kyng vnderſtandyng, commaunded Fineo that the cheefeſt of
them might be brought into the Cube, to ſhewe ſuche thinges
as thei had vnto his Concubines: by whiche occaſion he gatte
that oportunitie which he looked for, to confer and deale more
priuately with them without ſuſpition, and to giue the better
order, for the accompliſhement of aſmuche as he had deuiſed.
               
                  Fineo and his brother therefore beyng come into the Cube
ſhewed forthe emong thoſe women, ſuche wares as thei had
brought, to pleaſe their fancies, and gaue vnto them all, ſome
one trifle or an other, as a gentle preſent to the firſte, and the
brother of Fineo preſented Fiamma emong the reſt, with a verie
faire Purſe, richelie embrodered with Golde and Pearle,
in the whiche there was encloſed a letter, written by Fineo, by
the conrentes whereof, ſhe might vnderſtande at large, al that
whiche he did wiſhe, and would haue her to doe, to make their
eſcape together, and to ridd themſelues out of that thraldome
and captiuitie. Aſſone as the twoo brethren had doen that thei
came for, and were departed, Fiamm by their maner gatheryng,
that the gifte of that Purſe, contained ſome Miſterie,
withdrewe her ſelf into a ſecret place, and hauyng opened it,
ſhe found therin the letter, whiche when ſhe had read, ſhe thanked
Almightie God, that of his goodneſſe had ſhewed her the
waie, to deliuer her ſelf out of Captiuitie, and from becommyng
diſhoneſtly the Concubine of an Infidell kyng.
               And when this appointed daie, for the performyng of their
purpoſe was come: Fiamma in the night when all was ſilent,
and others ſlept, came to a windowe barred with Iron, where
Fineo and his brother were attendyng for her: Who with certaine
inſtrumentes, whiche thei had brought for that purpoſe,
brake and wreſted the Grate of the windowe, and takyng her
awaie with them, thei gott her into their Barque, and hoiſſed
ſaile, and directed their courſe with a merrie Winde, toward
the coaſte of Italie, whiche ſerued theim verie faire all that
night long, & the moſte part of the next daie. In the mornyng

                  Fiamma beyng miſſed, and Fineo likewiſe, the kyng (was aduertiſed
of their eſcape) who perceiuyng the Marchauntes to
bee gone alſo, reſted aſſured that it was a ſet matche made, for
the ſtealyng Fiamma awaie. And beeyng full of rage and deſpight
towardes them all, cauſed certaine Galleis and other
light veſſelles to be armed in all haſte, and to be ſent after thē,
giuyng ſtraight charge and Commiſſion to his Captaines,
that either thei ſhould bryng Fineo and the Damſell, with the
cheefe of the Marchauntes aliue vnto hym, becauſe he would
cauſe them all three to bee buried aliue: or that thei could not
get them aliue, thei ſhould bring their thre heddes, for that he
would haue them bee ſet ouer the Cube, for an example and a
terrour to all others.
               But before thoſe Galleis and other veſſelles, could be in a
readineſſe to depart: Fortune not hauyng yet her fill of perſecutyng
and afflictyng theſe twoo poore Louers, cauſed a contrarie
winde, with an extreame ſtorme and tempeſt to ariſe, by
force whereof, the veſſell wherein thei were, was not without
greate daunger, driuen backe again to Tuniſe, with ſo muche
greef and ſorrowe of all them that were in it, as thei maie imagine,
that knowe the crueltie and barbarouſneſſe of that people.
But in the beginnyng of the ſtorme, the brother of Fineo
diſpairyng of his life, as he that was aſſured, either to be drouned
by rage of the winde and ſeas, or els to die in torment, if he
returned into the handes of thoſe Infidelles, gat hymſelf into
his Cockboate, and therein hazarded his life: and after muche
adoe, and a thouſande perilles of preſent death, recouered the
coaſte of Italie at the laſte, and retourned home to Sauona ful
of woe with heauie tidynges, declaryng vnto his father, that
either the Fregate would bee loſte, or els driuen backe again
to Tuniſe, where he was well aſſured, that bothe his brother,
and the yong Damſell his Louer, ſhould bee murthered in
moſte cruell maner.
               At whiche dolefull newes, the father, as if he had ſeen his
ſonne lye dedde before him, began to weepe and lament, complaining
of his hard Deſtinie, that cauſed him to liue ſo long,
or reſerued him to ſee thoſe cruell and bitter daies.
               
                  
                  Fineo ſeyng himſelf brought to ſo hard an exigent, for that
their veſſell was now driuen backe nere vnto Tuniſe, and knowyng
that he ſhould feele the ſmarte of his faulte, and the
kynges anger in ſharpeſt maner and ſorte: beyng determined
to liue no longer, and to preuent the crueltie of the kyng drew
out his ſworde, and would there with haue ſtroken him ſelfe to
death. But Fiamam catchyng hym by the arme: Alas Fenio
(quoth ſhe) what ſhall become of me if you bee dead? Shall I
remaine behinde to endure the cruell tormentes, that I know
this Infidell hath prepared for me? Yet rather ſince that death
muſt needes deliuer vs of our miſfortunes, before you execut
vppon your ſelfe this your determination, ride me out of the
worlde, and deliuer me from the paines, whiche alreadie I
feele in my imaginacion, wherewith I aſſure my ſelf thei wil
bryng me to a ſhamefull death. And with theſe woordes offeryng
her breaſt vnto him, ſhe requeſted him to ſtrike her with
his Sworde. But Fineo bad her bee of good comfort, for your
beautie (my Fiamma ſaied he) beeyng ſo ſingulare as it is, I
knowe will ſaue you, and therefore you neede not feare, and I
alone ſhould be the man that thei would plague, and torment
to death for vs bothe, and therefore (my deare) ſuffer me to dye
before, and content thy ſelf to liue, and vouchſafe ſometyme to
remember thy vnfortunate Fineo when he is dedde.
               Whileſt thei were thus talkyng and debatyng, whiche
ſhould firſte dye, the people whiche the Kyng had ſent out to
apprehende them, came and boorden their Fregate, and tooke
theim bothe, whom thei bounde in Chaines, and brought on
lande to the preſence of the kyng. Who as ſone as he behelde
the beautie of Fiamma, felt his former wrath and crueltie entended
to relente, and in muche milder maner, then the twoo
Captiues hoped or looked for, he ſaied vnto her: tell me what
moued you, I praie you faire Damſell to run awaie, and flie
from me, at whoſe handes you had no cauſe to looke for any other
entreatie, then louing and freendly? Fiamma who in that
yere and a halfe, that ſhe had been in the Cube, had learned the
language indifferently well: made aunſwere vnto him. That
no cauſe or meanyng to flie from hym, but her earneſt deſire

to enioye Fineo, whom ſhe had loued, and choſen for her houſband
many yeres before, had forced her to doe that whiche ſhe
had doen: And herewith ſhe told hym, the beginnyng of their
acquaintance and loue, and how many perilles and daungers
thei had run through, ſtill hopyng one daie, to come vnto that
happie hower, wherin their troubles ſhould haue an ende, and
that thei might bee honeſtly vnited, and enioye one an other:
And finallie, caſtyng her ſelf doune at his feete, with aboundaunce
of teares, ſhe beſought hym with all humilitie to pardone
her, if ſhe had offended him, and withall to forgiue Fineo
ſince that long and faithfull loue, had made them to procure
the accompliſhement of their deſires.
               The teares of Fiamma, and the onely name of Loue were
of ſuche force and vertue, in the harte of the kyng, though he
were barbarous, and cruell of Nature, that the Ire and hatered,
whiche he had conceiued againſt theim before, was then
conuerted and chaunged into pitie, and compaſſion of their
miſfortunes: and where before he had appointed a cruell death
to bee their puniſhementes, he now determined to ouercome
with his courteſie, the frowardneſſe of their peruerſe Fortune
and to make theim, after ſo many perilles and daungers contented
and happie, and to ſee an ende at laſte of their miſeries
by makyng theim to enioye their longe hoped for deſires.
Wherfore, hauing cauſed thē to be bothe forthwith vnbound,
he tooke from his owne finger, a meruailous faire and precious
Rubie, and giuyng it vnto Fineo, he ſaied vnto him: ſince
your Fortune hath been ſuche, that after ſo many ſtraunge aduentures,
and through ſuche daungers, you are fallen into my
handes: I for my parte will not bee he, that will extinguiſhe,
or quenche the flames of ſo feruent and conſtaunt Loue, or vnlooſe
or diſſolue the bandes, wherewith your hartes be bounde
and knitt together. And therefore Fineo, I doe not onely pardon
you bothe, but alſo I will haue thee, before thou departe
hence, to wedde this Damſell with this Ring, and to cake her
for thy wife, and that ſhe henceforthe enioye thee for euer as
her houſebande. It is not to be demaunded, whether the twoo
Louers, (who looked for none other of the kynges courteſies

then death) were glad to heare hym vſe thoſe ſpeeches, yea or
no. But bothe beeyng fallen on their knees, and in humbleſt
maner, hauyng yeelded their thankes vnto his Maieſtie. Fineo
in his preſence Wedded Fiamma, and tooke her for his
wife, to the vnſpeakable ioye and contentation, of bothe their
hartes and mindes. And the kyng to honour their Mariage,
cauſed a ſumptuous feaſt to bee prepared, with no leſſe charge
and aboundaunce of all thynges, then if he had Married a
Daughter of his owne, to ſome greate Lorde, or cheef manne
of that Countrey.
               And after certaine daies, the twoo yong Maried Louers,
beyng deſirous to returne into their owne Countrey, he gaue
theim verie riche and coſtlie preſentes, and ſent theim honourablie
accompanied home to Sauona: Whoſe arriuall was no
leſſe meruailous, then ioyfull to the Father and Brother of
Fineo, and to all the Citee, thei hauyng been aſſuredlie eſteemed,
and accoumpted as dedde. Afterwardes thei ſent to Genoua
to Fiammas Father and Brother, certifiyng of all that
had happened, who then perſwadyng themſelues, that God &
Nature had created thoſe twoo yong folke, to be matched and
ioyned together in Wedlocke, were wel contented with that,
whiche thei ſawe was Gods will ſhould bee. And beyng gone
bothe to Sauona, the Father embraced and accepted Fineo for
his Sonne in Lawe, and the Brother for his Brother in law.
And the twoo yong Louers liued euer after, in greate happineſſe
and felicitie: giuyng by this ſucceſſe of their hard Fortune,
an aſſured argumente, and a notable example, whereby
we maie learne, that though froward Fortune doe for a while,
croſſe and moleſt the deſires, and trauailes of menne, yet in the
ende ſhe can not let, but that of neceſſitie thoſe thynges
muſt come to paſſe, whiche GOD by his Diuine
prouidence, wherewith he ruleth the whole
worlde, hath appoincted ſhall
take effecte.

                  The Argument of the fift Historie.
                  ¶Twoo brothers making choiſe of their wiues, the one
chooſe for beautie, the other for riches, it happened
vnto them after thei were married, the one of their
wiues proued to bee of light dispoſition, the other a
common ſcolde, in what maner thei liued with their
houſbandes, and how in the ende the first became to
liue orderly and well, but the other could be brought
by no deuiſe, to any reaſon or good maner.
               
               
                  GEntlewomen, before I will proceade
any farther in this Hiſtorie,
I muſte deſire you to arme your
ſelues with pacience in readyng
hereof, that if you finde any thyng
that might breede offence to your
modeſte myndes, take it in this
ſorte, that I haue written it onely
to make you merrie, and not to
ſette you a ſnarryng or grudgyng againſt me, for although I
meane to preſent you with a Chapter of Knauerie, yet it ſhall
be paſſable, and ſuche as you maie verie well permit, and the
matter that I mynde to write, is vpon this queſtion, whither a
man were better to be maried to a wiſe Harlot, or to a fooliſhe
ouerthwarte and brauiyng woman, this queſtion I knowe
will ſeme very doubtfull vnto ſome, and yet in my opinion verie
eaſie to be anſwered, and to ſpeake my minde without diſſimulation
of bothe thoſe euills, I thinke the firſt is leaſt, and
therefore is to bee choſen: and herein I could alledge for my
better proofe, an example of the auncient Romaines, who in al
their gouernmentes were moſte wiſe and politique, emongſt

whom the infirmitie of the firſt was borne withall, becauſe it
proceeded of the frailtie of the fleſhe, but the courage of the ſecond
was euer condemned, for that it did abound frō a wicked
and miſcheuous mynde. And in common reaſon, it is not leſſe
noyſome for a man, to liue accompanied with a wife, who although
ſhe will ſome tyme flie out, can ſo wiſely, diſſemble
with her houſbande, that he ſhall neuer ſo muche as ſuſpecte
her, whereby he ſhall receiue no diſcontentment in his minde,
then to be bedfellowe with Xantippa a cōmon ſcold, who daiely
and hourely will be checking, taunting, and railing at him,
in ſuche ſorte, that he ſhall thinke himſelf moſte bleſt and happie,
when he is fartheſt from her companie, but for your better
confirmation, I haue ſet forthe this Hiſtorie of two brethren,
the one of them married to a wenche, that could ſo cunningly
behaue her ſelf towardes hym, that he had thought ſhe had beleeued
there had been no other God but himſelf, & yet by your
leaue, ſhe would take reaſon when it was proffered her, but
what of that: the harte neuer greeues, what the eyes ſee not.
The other was married to a Dame, that frō her nauill douneward
was more chaſt and continent, but otherwiſe of her tong
ſuche a deuill of Hell, that the poore man her houſbande could
neuer enioye merry daie nor houre, although he deuiſed many
a pretie remedie, as by the readyng of the proceſſe of this tale
you ſhall better perceiue, whiche followeth in this ſorte.
               There was ſometyme remaining in a famous Citie twoo
brethren, the eldeſt (according to the cuſtome of the place) enioyed
his fathers goods and poſſeſſions after his death, wherby
he was wel able to liue, the yongeſt had neither landes nor
liuynges, ſauyng that his Father had trained hym vp in learnyng,
whereby he was able to gouerne hymſelf, in all maner
of companies where ſoeuer he became. Theſe two brethren
beyng wearie of their ſingle liues, diſpoſed themſelues to mariage:
The eldeſt beyng of hymſelf well able to liue, ſought a
wife onely for her beautie, without any other reſpect either to
her conditions or riches, and as the prouerbe is (he that ſéekes
ſhal finde) ſo in the ende he lighted on a Gentlewoman, called
by the name of Miſtres Doritie, whoſe beautie in deede was

very excellent, and there withall has a paſſyng readie witte,
Marie her trainyng vp had not been after the beſt, nor worſt
maner, but as a man might ſaie, after the common ſorte: this
gentlewoman he Married, who could ſo wel handle him with
kiſſynges, cullynges, and other amarous exerciſes, that her
houſband thought himſelf, the moſt fortunate man that liued,
to light on ſuche a wife, although ſhe cunningly armed his
head with hornes, as after you ſhall heare.
               The ſecond brother left (as you haue heard) without maintenance
or liuyng, ſought for a wife onely to releue his want,
and fortuned to hit of a widowe in deede with greate wealth,
but in conditions ſo ouerthwart, and ſo ſpiteful of her tongue,
that the poore man had not been Married fully out a moneth,
but he more then a thouſand tymes, curſed the Prieſt that maried
hym, the Sexten that opened the Church doore when he
went to bee married, yea, and his owne vnhappie legges that
had carried his bodie to bee yoked to ſo great a miſcheef. But
becauſe I doe minde more orderly to tell you the maners of
theſe twoo Gentlewomen: I will firſt beginne with Miſtres
Doritie, whoſe houſbande after thei had been a while maried,
fortuned to fall ſicke, and then accordyng to that Countrey
maner, a Doctor of Phiſicke was preſently ſent for, who commyng
many tymes to viſite his pacient, began to beholde and
contemplate the liuely beautie of this gentlewoman, and lent
her many rowling looke, and ſecrete countenaunces, in ſuche
ſorte that Miſtres Doritie beyng well practiſed in the Arte of
Loue, and ſeyng Maiſter Doctor to be a man as ſufficient, to
content a Gentlewoman in her Chamber that was whole, as
to miniſter Medicines to thoſe that were ſicke, did not onely
requite him againe with looke for looke, but ſhe yeelded hym
a large vſurie, and paied him more then fortie in the hundred:
Maiſter Doctor who was likewiſe ſkilful enough, could wel
perceiue whereto thoſe lookes did tende: Vpon a tyme beyng
alone in her companie, he ſaied vnto her as followeth.
               Miſtres Doritie, if the experience whiche I haue learned
in Phiſickes arte, might craue credite, and make my tale to
bee the better beleeued, aſſure your ſelf then that I minde to

ſaie nothyng, but that that ſhal bee to your owne behoofe, and
the reaſon that makes me to enter into this diſcourſe, is the
pitie that I take to ſee ſo proper a gentlewoman as your ſelf,
ſhould be ſo deceiued in a houſbande, who although you ſhall
finde hym bothe honeſt, gentle, and louing, yea, and peraduenture
maie content you with ſuch rightes, as appertaine to the
Marriage bedde, yet aſſure your ſelf he ſhall neuer be able to
get you with child, conſideryng your Natures and complexions
be ſo farre different the one from the other, whereby you
are like for euer to remaine without iſſue, and one of the greateſt
comfortes that maie happen vnto vs in this worlde, is to
ſee our ſelues as it were regenerate and borne a newe in our
children, and barrenneſſe in the auncient tyme, hath been accompted
not onely infamous, but alſo moſte hateful amongſt
women, in ſo muche that Sara gaue her owne Handmaide to
her houſband, becauſe ſhe could not her ſelf conceiue a childe:
but I would wiſhe women more witt then to followe Saras
example. God defende their ſhould bee ſo fooliſhe to giue their
Maidens to their Houſbandes, I would wiſhe them rath
                     ••
                  
them ſelues to take their men: it hath been euer holden for the
greater wiſedome, rather to take then to giue, and ſure thei
ſhall finde it more for their owne profites, that if their houſebands
want be ſuche, that he is not able to get a child, to take
helpe of ſome other, that maie ſupplie his imperfections, but
I truſt I ſhall not neede to vſe many perſwaſions, conſidering
that euery wiſe woman will thinke, that I haue reaſon on my
ſide: Thus Miſtres Doritie, you haue heard the ſomme of my
tale, proteſtyng, that if my ſeruice maie any waies ſtande you
in ſteade, I am as readie to obeye, as he ouer whom you haue
power to commaunde.
               Miſtres Doritie, who all this while had well pondered his
woordes, knewe very well how to whett Maiſter Doctor on,
and the more to ſet his teeth on edge, aunſwered hym thus: I
perceiue Maſter Doctor you are ſomething pleaſantly diſpoſed,
and hereafter when I ſhall finde my houſbandes infirmitie
to be ſuche as you haue ſaied, I meane to ſende for you, deſiryng
you, that you would not be out of the waie, to helpe me

when I haue neede.
               The Doctor knewe not well how to vnderſtande theſe
wordes, whether thei were merily ſpoken, or otherwiſe in diſdaine
of his former talke, aunſwered thus. Alas Miſtres Doritie,
pardon me if my wordes ſeeme any thyng offenſiue vnto
you, aſſuryng you that in this meane ſpace, that I haue made
my recourſe to your houſbande, (whoſe healthe by the ſufferance
of God, I haue now well reſtored) am my ſelf falne into
a Feuer ſo extreame, as neither Galen, Hypocrates, Auicen,
Plinij, nor any other that euer gaue rules of Phiſicke,
could yet preſcribe a Medicine for the malladie, or diet to ſuppreſſe
the humour that feedes it: I ſhall not neede to vſe long
circumſtaunce in the matter, knowyng your wiſedome to bee
ſuche, that you can well conceiue the ſomme of all my greef, it
is your beautie that is like to breede my bane, and hath alreadie
driuen me into the greateſt depth of daunger, vnleſſe ſome
plaintes of pitie maie preuaile, to yeeld remorſe to hym, that
vowes hymſelf to doe you ſeruice duryng life.
               Miſtres Doritie ſeing the matter ſorted out as ſhe looked
for, could tell wel enough how to handle maiſter Doctor, and
to make hym the more eger, ſhe delaied him of with doubtfull
ſpeeches, but yet fedde hym ſtill with ſuche entiſing and pleaſaunt
countenaunces, that miniſtred greate hope of comforte
to his deſeaſe, ſhe aunſwered thus.
               And could you then finde in your harte (Maiſter Doctor)
to deceiue your very freend of his deare and louyng life, how
can you offer hym ſo manifeſt an iniurie, to whom you are ſo
lately linckt in ſo great a league of freendſhip, as is betweene
my houſband and your ſelf, I can not thinke maiſter Doctor,
that it is good wil that hath cauſed you to moue this ſute vnto
me, but rather to ſee how I were diſpoſed, or peraduēture you
vſe theſe wordes for exerciſe ſake, knowing the faſhion of you
men to bee ſuche, as by praiſyng of our beautie, you thinke to
bring vs into a fooles paradize, y• we wil giue credite ſtraight
waie, that you loue vs ſo ſoone as you ſhall but tel vs the tale:
but for my part (Maiſter Doctor) although I want wit to encoūter
you with words, ſo likewiſe I want will to beleue any

thing that you haue ſaid, to be otherwiſe thē wordes of courſe.
               Theſe ſpeeches did ingender ſuche a nomber of ſwetee and
ſowre alterations in Maiſter Doctor, that for his life he wiſte
not how to vnderſtand them: one while thei were like to driue
hym to diſpaire: an other while thei ſomethyng quieted hym
with hope, but in the ende determining to follow what he had
begonne, he ſaied.
               Sweete Miſtres, moſt humbly I deſire you to accompt of
me, not according to my deſertes, which as yet are none at al,
but according to the dutiful ſeruice, whiche hereafter I vowe
faithfully to doe vnto you, and for the better teſtimonie of my
words which (as you ſaie) ſeeme to be of ſuch ordinary courſe,
I deſire no other credite maie bee giuen them, then ſhall be agreeable
to my deedes, when it ſhal pleaſe you to commaund:
but alas for the iniurie whiche you ſpeake of, that I ſhould offer
to your houſband, who in deede I make accompt to be my
very freende, what is he I praie you, that is able to preſcribe
lawes to loue? And as loue is without law, ſo is it without reſpect,
either of freende or foe, father or brother, riche or poore,
mightie or weake, vertuous or vicious: the exāples are ſo many
& generall, that I ſhould but waſte the time to repeate thē.
But (Miſtres Doritie) I proteſt the very cauſe that maketh
me to moue this matter vnto you, is for no ill wil that I beare
to your houſband, but for the good will I beare to your ſwete
ſelf, you maie vſe your houſbande as your houſbande, and me
as your freende, glad to ſtande at reuerſion, when your houſeband
maie take his fil of the banket, and be glutted with more
then enough: farther, if you make ſo greate accompt of your
houſbandes good likyng as you ſaie, what wiues be euer better
beloued, or more made of by their houſbandes, then thoſe
that haue diſcretion to helpe their frendes whē thei need. But
what ſottiſhe opinion is this, whiche ſo many doeth holde, that
thei thinke it ſo great an iniurie for a man, to ſeeke the wife of
his freende, when he is attached by loue, whoſe arreſt, neither
Goddes nor men haue bin euer able to reſiſt. But I praie you
(Miſtres Doritie) if I might aſke you this queſtion, would
you not thinke your good wil better beſtowed vpō your houſbandes

freende then his foe, if you loue your houſbande, I am
ſure you wil ſaie I haue reaſon, what ſhould I longer trouble
you then with circumſtances: I knowe you are wiſe, and now
I deſire you for the good will that you beare to your houſebande,
to pitie me his freende, whom I truſt you will reſtore
with one drop of mercy, & the rather for your houſbands ſake.
               How thinke you Gentlewoman, bee not theſe gentle perſwaſions
to be vſed by a Doctor, Marie he was no Doctor of
Deuinitie, and therefore you neede not followe his doctrine,
vnleſſe you liſte your ſelues, but this pitifull Gentlewoman,
ſeyng Maiſter Doctor at ſuche deſperate pointes, for feare of
damning of her owne ſoule, that ſo deare a freend to her houſbande
as Maiſter Doctor was, ſhould periſhe and bee ſo wilfully
caſt awaie through her default, ſhe receiued hym for her
freend, and ſo I praie God giue them ioye.
               But it fortuned afterwardes, this Gentlewoman to light
into the companie of a Lawyer, who perceiuing this Dame to
be of ſuche excellent beautie, ioyning himſelf ſome thing nere
her, he ſaied: Gentlewoman, although I haue no ſkill in the
arte of Paintyng, yet aſſure your ſelf, your forme and paſſyng
beautie, is ſo ſurely engrauen and fixed in my mynde, that although
your ſelf were abſent, I could draw your perfect coū
                  terfecte,
ſauing that I thinke all the Apothecaries in this Citie,
were not able to furniſhe me with colours, to make the
perfect diſtaine of the beautie in your face.
               Miſtres Doritie knowing whereto theſe ſpeeches pretended,
aunſwered: In deede ſir, it ſhould ſeeme you would proue
a paſſyng Painter, that can ſo cunnyngly Painte foorth with
wordes, that whiche I knowe is too farre vnworthie of ſo excellēt
a floriſhe, as you would giue it. Miſtres (ꝙ the Lawier)
if I haue committed any offence, in theſe woordes whiche I
haue ſpoken, it is in that I haue taken vpon me to praiſe your
beautie, and not able to giue it ſuche due commendations, as
I ſee it doeth deſerue, the ſight whereof doeth ſo captiuate my
affections, and hath ſo creepled all my ſences, that it hath cauſed
me in maner to forgette my ſelf, no maruaile then though
my tongue doth faile, and is not able to expreſſe the perfectiō
                  
of you, vnto whom with vowe of continuall ſeruice, I ſubiect
my life, liuing, and libertie, if it pleaſe you to accept of it.
               This Gentlewoman, that had yet but one freend to truſt
vppon, beſides her houſbande, beganne to thinke that ſtore
was no ſore, and therfore determined not to forſake his frendlie
offer, but firſt ſhe demaunded of hym of his facultie, and
what trade of life he vſed, to which he aunſwered, that he was
a Gentleman appertaining to the Lawe. It maie well bee ſo
(ꝙ ſhe) for I perceiue by your experience, that this is not the
firſt Plea that you haue framed. And yet beleeue me (ꝙ the
Lawyer) I was neuer brought before to pleade at Beauties
barre, but ſith my happe is ſuche, I humblie holde vp my handes,
deſiryng to be tried by you courteſie and myne owne Ioyaltie,
contenting my ſelf to abide ſuche dome and iudgement,
as it ſhall pleaſe you to appoinct, beeyng the cheef and Soueraigne
Iudge your ſelf, ſhe repliyng, ſaied: Seeing you haue
conſtituted me to giue Sentence at my pleaſure, it is not th
                     •
                  
office of a good Iuſticer, to be parciall in his owne cauſe, and
therefore this is the hope you ſhal looke for at my handes, that
if hereafter in your deedes, I ſhall ſee as plaine proofe of perfecte
good will, as your woordes by pretence importe likelyhood
of earneſt Loue, you ſhall finde me ready to render ſuche
recompence, as ſhall fall out to your owne contentation and
likyng. This comfortable aunſwere, very well pleaſed hym,
and within a very little ſpace after, he ſo handeled the matter,
that he had entered his action in her Common place. Thus
what betweene Maiſter Doctor on the one ſide, who was ſtill
miniſtryng of Phiſicke vnto her, ſo long as there were any
Drugges remainyng in his Storehouſe, and the Lawyer on
the other ſide, who ſufficiently enſtructed her with his Lawe:
thei vſed ſuche haūt vnto this Gentlewomans companie, that
the one beganne to growe ſuſpicious on the other, and eche of
them deſirous to haue her ſeuerall to hymſelf, beganne in the
ende to enuaigh the one againſt the other: the Doctor againſt
the Lawier, and the Lawier againſt the Doctor, and to tel her
to her face what thei ſuſpected, the one againſt the other. But
Miſtres Doritie beeyng very angrie with them bothe, that

would ſo narrowlie looke into her doynges, did thinke it had
been ſufficient for reaſonable men, that ſhe had receiued them
into her fauor, and as often as it had pleaſed them to come, ſhe
welcomed them as themſelues did deſire, and what can a man
deſire any more, then to drinke ſo often as he ſhall be a thirſt?
But with faire ſpeeches ſhe contented them bothe for a tyme:
but ſhe thought in the end, to finde a remedie for that miſchief.
               And thus it fell out, that a Souldiour, who was lately retourned
from the warres, I geſſe aboute the ſame tyme, that
Kyng Henry the fift was retourned, from the winnyng of Agincourt
feelde: this Souldiour I ſaie, brauyng it out about
the ſtreates of the Citie (as commonly the cuſtome of Souldiours
is, to ſpend more in a moneth, then thei get in a yere (as
he roomed to and fro, and fortuned to eſpie this blaſing ſtarre
lookyng out at a windowe, was ſodainly ſtroken into a great
maze, to ſe
                     •
                   
                  
                     •
                  his Lampe of light, then euer he had been in the
feelde, to ſee the Enſignes of his enemies, and was ſo farre euercharged
with her loue: that but for feare to haue been marked
by the paſſers by, he would haue ſtoode ſtill gazyng and
lookyng vpon her: but learnyng in the ende, that ſhe was the
Miſtres of the houſe, he began to deuiſe how he might make
her vnderſtande the feruencie of his Loue, on whiche he determined
to write vnto her: But then he knewe not how to beginne
his Letter, becauſe Souldiours are very ſeldome accuſtomed
to endite, eſpecially any of theſe louyng lines: And to
ſpeake vnto her, he was likewiſe to learne how to vſe his tearmes,
neither wiſte he how to come into her preſence, but you
ſhall ſee Fortune fauoured hym: For in an Euenyng as he
paſſed through the ſtreate, ſhe was ſittyng alone in her doore
to take the aire, and commyng vnto her, not knowyng for his
life how to begin his tale: In the ende, Miſtres (ꝙ he) I praie
you is your houſbande within? No ſurely ſir (ꝙ ſhe) he is abroade
in the Toune, but I knowe not where: And I would
gladly haue ſpoken with hym (ꝙ the Souldiour) if he had bin
within: Beleeue me ſir he is not within (ꝙ ſhe) but if it pleaſe
you to leaue your arrande with me, at his commyng home I
will ſhew hym your minde. In faith Miſtres (ꝙ the ſoldiour)

my arrande is not greate, I would but haue craued his helpe
in chuſyng me a wife, becauſe I perceiue he hath ſome experiēce
in the facultie, or els I think he could neuer haue choſen
ſo well for hymſelf. If your arrande be no other then this (ꝙ
Miſtres Doritie) you may at your owne leiſure come and doe
it your ſelf, and as for my houſbandes experience that you
ſpeake of, although peraduenture it bee not fittyng to your
fancie, yet I am well aſſured that he hath made his choyce of
ſuche a one, as he himſelf very well liketh. I beleue it wel (ꝙ
the Souldiour) and if without offence I might ſpeake it, I
ſweare ſo God help me, I like his choiſe ſo wel, that I would
thinke my ſelf more then a thouſand times happie, if I might
bee his halfe, or if my vnworthineſſe deſerued not ſo greate a
p
                     •••
                  on, I would craue no more then your ſelf would willingly
beſtowe on me, accordingly as you ſhould ſee me able to deſerue
it. Why ſir (ꝙ Miſtres Doritie) I doe not vnderſtande
wherevnto your ſpeeches doeth tende, neither what parte you
would haue me to giue you, when I haue alreadie beſtowed
of my houſbande, bothe my hande, my harte, my minde, and
good will. Alas Gentlewoman (ꝙ the Souldiour) theſe bee
none of them that I would craue, there is yet an ouerplus
whiche you haue not yet ſpoken of, whiche if you pleaſe to beſtow
of a Souldiour, I ſhould think my ſelf the happieſt man
aliue, whoſe loue and good likyng towards you is ſuche, that
I truſt in tyme to come, your ſelf will iudge me worthie, for
my well deſeruyng zeale, to haue deſerued hire. Souldiours
are ſeldome ſeene (ꝙ Miſtres Doritie) to marche vnder the
banner of Venus, but what ſo euer you bee, doe you thinke to
ouerthrowe my vertues, with the aſſault of your wanton perſwaſions,
or would you make me beleeue that you loue me as
you ſay, whē you haue no more reſpect to the hurt of my ſoule.
Gentlewoman (ꝙ the Souldiour) I am not able to encounter
you with wordes, becauſe it hath not been my profeſſion, nor
trainyng vp, but if you doubte of my loue and good likyng:
Pleaſe it you to make triall, commaund any thyng that your
ſelf ſhall thinke requiſite, whiche if I doe not performe to the
vttermoſt, then eſteeme my loue in deede to be but feined, and

where you thinke that I goe aboute to ſeeke the preiudice or
hurte of your ſoule, beleeue me I neuer ment it.
               Miſtres Doritie, who had been wel acquainted before with
many ſuiters, had neuer been appoſed with ſuche a rough hewen
fellow, that was ſo blūt and plaine, aſwell in his geſture,
as in his tearmes: Began to think with her ſelf, that he might
well be a Souldiour, for ſhe knewe that thei had little ſkill in
the courting of Gentlewomen, yet ſhe perceiued by his countenaunce,
the vehemencie of his loue he bare vnto her, and perceiuing
his plainneſſe, ſhe began to thinke him more fitter for
her diet, then either Maiſter Doctor, or Maiſter Lawier, that
could not be contented the one with the other, when ſhe gaue
them bothe ſo muche as thei could craue, and therefore thinkyng
with her ſelf, that to looſe any longer tyme were but a
poinct of folly, takyng the Souldiour by the hande, ſhe ledde
hym vp into a Chamber, where other ſpeeches were paſſed betweene
them in ſecrete, whiche I could neuer yet vnderſtand,
and what thei did farther when thei were by themſelues, gentlewomen
I praie geſſe you, but this I muſt aduertiſe you of,
that before thei came forth of the Chamber againe, the Souldiour
had pleaſed Miſtres Doritie ſo well, that bothe Maiſter
Doctor, and Maiſter Lawier, were put quite out of conceipt,
fo that from that tyme forwardes when thei came of their viſitation,
the Gentlewoman was not wel at caſe, or ſhe had company
with her, or ſhe was not at home, that thei could no more
ſpeake with her: whiche tourned them bothe into a wonderful
agonie. The Doctor had thought ſhe had forſaken him for the
loue of the Lawier: The Lawier he thought as muche by the
Doctor, that in the ende not knowyng otherwiſe how to ſpit
out their venime againſt her, thei deuiſed eache of them a letter,
whiche thei ſent her. The firſt of theſe letters deliuered
vnto her, came from the Doctor, whiche letter he left vnpointed
of purpoſe, becauſe that in the readyng of it, it might bee
poincted two waies, and made to ſeeme either to her praiſe or
diſpraiſe, but Miſtres Doritie her ſelf in the readyng of it,
poincted it as I haue ſet it doune, and followeth in this ſorte.
               And who would haue thought miſtres Doritie, that for the

louyng aduertiſementes giuen you by your freend, you could
ſo lightly haue ſhaken hym of, if I burdened you with any
thyng that might ſeeme greeuous vnto you, thinke it was
Loue that ledde me vnto it, for that I proteſt inwardly in my
mynde, I neuer did eſteeme you otherwiſe then for as honeſt
a gentlewoman as lines this daie in Bridewell. I haue heard
ſaie ſome haue been ſcourged more vpon euill will, then for any
deſertes whereof thei might iuſtly be accuſed, ſo if it be my
happe to ſuffer vndeſerued penaunce, I muſt impute it to my
owne miſfortune, but yet contrarie to my expectation, conſideryng
how I haue euer taken you to bee giuen in your coditions
to practiſe vnſeemely, filthie, and deteſtable thynges: I
knowe you haue euer abhorred to liue chaſtly, decently, and
orderly: you haue euer been trained vp to be wanton, proude,
and incontinent: you neuer tooke delight in that was good,
honeſt, or conmendable: you wholie gaue your ſelf to leudeneſſe,
luſt, and Lecherie: you were an open enemie to vertue:
a freend to vice. What ſhould I ſaie, I doe but waſte the time
in the ſetting of you forth, and therefore will leaue you like as
I found you.
               This Letter brought Miſtres Doritie into ſuche a furie
when ſhe had peruſed it, that ſhe ſware by no Beggers ſhe
would be ſo reuenged vpon the Doctor, that ſhe would make
hym a ſpectacle to all the Phiſitions in the worlde, how thei
ſhould abuſe an honeſt gentlewoman while thei liued. And in
the middeſt of her Melancholie, her deareſt freende the Souldiour
happened to come in, whom ſhe made partaker of all
her ſecretes, ſhewyng him the Letter whiche Maiſter Doctor
had ſent her: and as thei were deuiſyng how to vſe reuengement,
a Meſſenger was knockyng at the doore, to deliuer a
letter from the Lawyer, the tenure whereof followeth in this
maner,
               Maie this bee the rewarde of my true and faithfull Loue,
whiche ſo firmely I haue borne thee? Or is this the delight of
thy daliaunce, whiche ſo many tymes thou haſte vſed with
me? So careleſly to ſhake me of, as though I had committed
ſome notable abuſe, when in deede I haue loued thée a greate

deale more, then I perceiue thou art worthie of. Oh feminine
flatterie. O fained faunyng. O counterfect courteſie. O deep
diſſimulation: But what hope is otherwiſe to be looked for in
theſe Kites of Creſſides kinde. Or what conſtancie maie any
man thinke to finde in a woman? No no, if a man maie generally
ſpeake of their ſexe, you ſhall neuer finde them but counterfect
in their courteſie, fained in their frendſhip, diſſembling
in their deedes, and in all their actions moſte daungerous, for
men to deale withall? For if ſhe haue a faire face, it is euer
matched with a cruell harte, their heauenly lookes with helliſhe
thoughtes: their modeſt countenaunces, with mercileſſe
mindes: thei haue witte, but it is in wiles: if thei loue, it is too
vehement: when thei hate, it is to the death. But good God,
with how many fopperies are thei accuſtomed to feede fooles,
I meane ſuche as bee Louemakers and Suiters vnto them,
whom thei delaie with as many deuiſes, as thei be in number
that ſeekes to ſerue them. Some thei lure with lookes: ſome
thei practiſe with promiſes: ſome thei feed with flattery: ſome
thei delay with deliance: ſome thei winde in with wiles: ſome
thei keepe with kiſſes: ſome thei diet with diſſimulation. One
muſt weare her Gloue, an other muſt weare her Garter, an
other muſt weare her Coulers: an other ſhall weare the ſpoile
of as muche as ſhe can get from all the reſt by couſonage, and
yet to ſee how daintie theſe darlinges, wil ſeeme to thoſe that
bee not acquainted with their cuſtomes, were able to daſhe a
yong man out of countenaunce: I warrant you, thei can make
it more nice then wiſe: more coie then comely, more fine then
honeſt. And to whom doe thei make the matter moſt daungerous,
but to thē that deſerueth beſt to be rewarded: For where
thei ſee a man that is drouned in affection towardes them, ouer
him thei will triumphe, and can tell how to ride the foole
without a ſnaffle: one while thei will croſſe him with froward
language, then againe comforte hym with ſome fained looke.
Now ſhe driues him into deſperation with frounyng face, by
and by ſhe baites hym againe with banquettes of vncertaine
hope, ſuche is their euill nature (as I ſaie) that thei wil ſhewe
them ſelues moſte ſquemiſhe and daintie, to hym that loues

them moſte entirely, and him that ſeekes them leaſt diſhoneſtly,
hym thei rewarde with their coldeſt courteſie. For better
proofe, lette a man ſeeke to winne one of theſe tender peeces,
that goes for a maide, honeſtly, and in the waie of Marriage,
and I warrant you ſhe will make the matter more coye and
nice to hym that meanes good earneſt, then to an other that
comes but to trie and proue them. And what ſignes of ſhamefaſtneſſe
wil thei ſeeme to make, when a man doeth but touch
them: fainyng them ſelues to be too young, when (in deede) if
thei once paſt the age of fifteene yeres (if thei were not a feard
of breeding of bugges in their belly) by their good willes thei
would neuer be without the company of a man. Thus to conclude,
their nature is openly to ſcorne all men, bee their loues
neuer ſo honeſt, and ſecretly to refuſe no man be his luſt neuer
ſo leude. Full aptly did Salomon in his Prouerbes compare
you to Wine, that can make vs ſo dronken wich your deuiſes,
that notwithſtandyng we ſee the ſnares with our eyes, which
you haue ſette to entangle vs, wee can not ſhunne the baite,
which we knowe will breede our bane. Thus muche Miſtres
Doritie, I haue thought good to ſignifie vnto you, whoſe diſcourteſie
at this tyme hath cauſed me ſo generally to enuaie
againſt your whole Sexe, not otherwiſe mindyng to accuſe
your ſelf perticularly, knowyng that if you ſhould otherwiſe
haue vſed me then you haue, you ſhould haue degreſſed and
ſwarued quite from your kinde, and ſo I leaue you.
               Gentlewomen I beſeeche you forgiue me my fault, in the
publiſhyng this infamous letter, I promiſe you I doe but ſignifie
it accordyng to the copie, whiche this vnhappie Lawier
ſent to Miſtres Doritie, and when I had well conſidered the
blaſphemie that he had vſed againſt your ſexe, I cut my penne
all to peeces, wherewith I did copie it out, and if it had not
been for the hurtyng of my ſelf, I promiſe you I would haue
cut and mangled my owne fingers, wherewith I held the pen
while I was writing of it: and truſt me according to my ſkil,
I could well haue founde in my harte, to encounter him with
an aunſwere in your defence, but then I was interrupted by
an other as you ſhall well perceiue. For the Souldiour,

whiche you haue heard ſpoken of, that was remainyng with
Miſtres Doritie, when he had peruſed this Letter, was put
into a wonderfull chafe, and in the middeſt of his furie, he vttered
theſe wordes.
               Ah moſte vilde and blaſphemous beaſt, what art thou that
with ſuche exclamations, goeſt about to defame thoſe, whom
by all honeſt humanitie and manhood, we be willed ſpecially
to loue, honour, and reuerence, what art thou? A man, a deuill
or a ſubtill Lawyer, yea ſurely, and ſo thou maieſt well be, and
herein haſte thou ſhewed thy ſelf no whit at all to degreſſe
from thy profeſſion. For as at the firſt the Lawes were conſtituted
to miniſter Iuſtice, and to giue euery one his right,
ſo now are thei made by the practiſe of a nomber of Pettie
foggers, the inſtrumentes of all iniquitie and wrong. Euen ſo
that worthie ſexe, whiche at the firſt were giuen vnto man by
the almightie God himſelf, to be his cheefeſt comfort and conſolation.
See here the practiſe of a wicked Caitife, who with
his eloquence would perſwade vs, that thei were our greateſt
ruine and deſolations: Ah wicked wretche that thou art, how
thinkeſt thou to eſcape, thus to blowe forthe thy blaſphemie,
againſt thoſe bleſſed ones, whom God hath perfited aboue all
other creatures. For at their firſt creation, thei were made of
the moſte beſt and purified mettall of man, where man hym
ſelf was framed but of ſlime and droſſe: what reaſon then that
beeyng at the firſt framed moſte pure and perfect creatures,
but that thei ſhould continue their firſt perfection to the ende
of the worlde. And like as at the firſt thei were made more excellent
then man, where ſhould wee now ſeeke for grace, vertue,
and goodneſſe, but onely in the feminine ſexe, accordyng
to their ſinguler creation.
               I truſt this is ſo euident that there is no man able to denaie
it, and enough to proue, that as women at the firſt were
created moſte perfecte, ſo thei haue ſtill remained the ſtorehouſe
of all grace vertue and goodneſſe, and that if there be any
thyng founde in vs men that is worthie of commendation,
we are onely to giue thankes to women from whom wee receiue
it, as being deſcended from out their entrailes: but with

how greate and manifolde miſeries, ſhould we men be daiely
afflicted, were it not for the comforte wee finde at womens
handes, for beſides that by their induſtrie we be notified, made
more clendly, and kept ſwete, who otherwiſe of our ſelues we
ſhould become to bee moſte filthie and lothſome creatures, ſo
at all tymes and ſeaſons thei be ſo neceſſarie and conuenient
aboute vs, that it were impoſſible for vs to bee without their
bleſſed companies. Firſt, in our health thei content vs with
their familiaritie, in our ſickneſſe thei cheriſhe vs, in our mirth
thei make it more abounde, in ſorrowe their companie doeth
beguile our penſiue thoughtes, in pleaſure thei be our cheefe
delightes, in paine their preſence breedeth cōfort our grief,
in wealth what greater treaſure then to enioye our beloued, in
want what greater wealth then a louing and faithful wife, in
peace we labour ſtill to get their likyng, in warres thei make
vs ſhewe our ſelues more valiaunt: but how is it poſſible that
women ſhould behaue themſelues, but that there are ſome wil
finde fault with them: Firſt, if ſhe bee familiare, we iudge her
to be light, if ſhe ſeeme any thing ſtraunge in her cōuerſatio
                     •
                  
ah we ſaie ſhe is a daungerous Dame▪ if merrie, wee thin
                     •
                  
her to be naught, if ſad, we ſaie ſhe is more graue then honeſt,
if ſhe be talkatiue, wee ſaie ſhe is a tatlying houſwife, if ſilent,
we ſaie ſhe is a ſheepe, if clendly in her apparell, we ſaie ſhe is
proude, if plaine or homely, we ſaie ſhe is a doudie or a ſlut, if
thei denaie vs their curteſie when we ſue vnto them, wee ſaie
thei be cruell Tigers, Beares, and Bugges, if thei haue compaſſion
of vs, we diſcredit them amongſt our companions.
               But ſee here the cunnyng of a Caitife, that would wreaſt
the wordes of Salomon to the diſpraiſe of women, becauſe in
his Prouerbes he compareth them to Wine, but to interprete
the wordes of Salomon by Salomon himſelf: in an other place
of the ſame Prouerbes, he willeth Wine ſhould bee giuen to
comforte thoſe that bee feeble and weake, now compare theſe
places together and ſee what harme he hath doen to women,
and in my opinion, he could not more aptly haue made a compariſon,
for as Wine is a comforte to theſe that are feeble and
weake, ſo are women our greateſt ſolace, both in ſickneſſe and

in health: But if any wil ſaie that Wine maketh vs dronken,
and from reaſonable men to become more brute then beaſtes.
I aunſwere that the fault is not to bee imputed to the Wine,
but to the beaſtlineſſe of him that taketh more then enough,
for there is nothyng ſo precious for our behoofes, but by our
owne abuſe we make it ſeeme moſt vile & lothſome: And thus
graunting maiſter Lawier his compariſon to be true, he hath
doen little hurt, ſauing he hath ſhewed himſelf a diligent ſcholer
to his Maiſter the deuill, who is father of all lyes, in maintaining
ſo manifeſt a lye againſt ſuche harmeleſſe creatures.
               There were many other ſpeeches pronounced by this
Souldiour in the behalfe of women, whiche I haue forgot to
recite. But I praie Gentlewomen how like you by this Soldiour,
doe you not thinke hym worthie a Sargantes fee for
his aunſwere: in my opinion, you ought to loue Souldiours
the better for his ſake.
               But to retourne to Miſtres Doritie, thoſe two letters had
ſo vexed her, that there was nothing in her minde but how ſhe

                     ••
                  ght be reuenged. Her freende the Souldiour promiſed for
her ſake, that he would ſo cudgill both Maiſter Doctor, and
the Lawier, that thei ſhould not in one moneth after be able to
lift their armes to their heades, ſauyng he wiſt not how to get
them into a place conuenient, for that it was daungerous to
deale with them in the open ſtreates. Miſtres Doritie giuing
him twentie kiſſes for his courteſie, told him ſhe would deuiſe
to bring them into ſome place where he might worke his wil.
               Preſently after, Miſtres Doritie ſent for Maiſter Doctor,
whom ſhe knewe very well how to handle, and in a milde
maner ſhe began greatly to blame hym, that being wiſe as ſhe
knew him to be, would ſo raſhly iudge of her, for that he might
wel knowe that there was ſome greate cauſe, that moued her
to vſe him as ſhe had doen, otherwiſe then he had coniectured:
and thus with many other like ſpeeches, ſhe ſo ſmothed the
matter with Maiſter Doctor, that ſhe made hym beleeue her
houſbande had ſome ſuſpition in their familiaritie, and that
by his commaundement ſhe had abſtained his companie for a
tyme, the which (Maiſter Doctor ꝙ ſhe) I did for no euill will

that I beare you, but for a tyme to bleare my houſebandes
eyes, thinkyng in the ende ſo to haue handled the matter, that
wee might haue continued our accuſtomed freendſhip, without
any maner of ſuſpition: And then drawyng forthe the letter,
whiche the Doctor had ſent her (ſhe ſaied): But ſee Maiſter
Doctor your good opinion conceiued in me, loe, here the
reward that I haue for my courteſie beſtowed of you, thus to
raile and rage againſt me, as though I were the moſte notable
ſtrumpet in a Countrey.
               The Doctor knowyng in what forme he had wright the
letter, and deſirous againe to renue his late acquaintaunce,
aunſwered, that he neuer writte letter vnto her, whereby he
had giuen any occaſion for her to take any greef. No haue?
(quoth Miſtreſſe Doritie) read you then here your own lines,
takyng hym the letter, whiche the Doctor as I tolde you before,
had left vnpointed, and therefore in the readyng, he pointed
it after this maner.
               And who would haue thought (Miſtreſſe Doritie) that for
the louyng aduertiſementes giuen you by your freende, you
could ſo lightlie haue ſhaken hym of, if I burdeined you with
any thing, that might ſeme greeuous vnto you, thinke it was
Loue that ledde me vnto it, for that I proteſted inwardlie in
my mynde, I did neuer eſteeme you otherwiſe, then for as honeſt
a Gentlewoman as liues at this daie. In Bridewell I
haue heard ſaie, ſome haue been ſcourged more vpon euill wil,
then for any deſertes whereof thei might iuſtlie bee accuſed:
So if it bee my happe to ſuffer vndeſerued penaunce, I muſt
impute it to myne owne miſfortune, but yet contrarie to my
expectation, conſideryng how I haue euer taken you to be giuen
in your conditions: to practiſe vnſeemely, filthie, and deteſtable
thinges, I knowe you haue euer abhored: To liue
chaſtlie, decently, and orderlie, you haue euer been trained vp:
to bee wanton, proude, and incontinente, you neuer tooke delight:
In that was good, honeſt, or commendable, you wholie
gaue your ſelf: to lewdneſſe, luſte, and Lecherie, you were an
open enemie, to vertue a freende, to vice: what ſhould I ſaie, I
doe but waſte the tyme in ſettyng you forthe, and therefore

will leaue you like as I founde you.
               I praie you Miſtreſſe Doritie (quoth the Doctor) where is
this railyng and raging you ſpeake of, I truſt I haue written
nothyng that might diſcontent you. Miſtreſſe Doritie perceiuyng
the Knauerie of the Doctor, and ſeeyng the matter fell
out ſo fitte for her purpoſe: Firſt giuyng him a freendly buſſe
ſhe ſaied. Alas my deare freende, I confeſſe I haue treſpaſſed,
in miſconſteryng of your lines: But forgiue me I praie you,
and now haue compaſſion of her, whoſe loue towarde you is
ſuche, that it is impoſſible for me to liue, without your good
likyng, and ſeyng that my houſebandes Ielouſie is ſo muche,
that you can haue no longer acceſſe to my houſe, but it muſte
needes come to his eare, by ſuche ſpie and watche as he hath
laied, neither my ſelf can goe abroade to any place, but I am
dogged, and followed by ſuche as he hath appoincted: But
now if your loue be but half ſo muche towardes me, as I truſt
I haue deſerued, and hereafter doe meane to requite. I haue
alreadie deuiſed a meane, how for euer I might enioye my deſired
freend, without either let or moleſtation of any one, ſeme
he neuer ſo muche to be offended at the matter.
               The Doctor the gladdeſt man in the worlde to heare theſe
newes, aunſwered: And what is it then that ſhould make you
ſtagger, or doubt of the fredndſhip of your louyng Doctor, no
not if thereby I ſhould hazard the loſſe, bothe of life & goodes.
               Alas (quoth Miſtreſſe Doritie) GOD defende I ſhould
woorke you ſo greate a preiudice, and I beſeeche you vſe no
more ſuche ſpeeches vnto me, that I ſhould goe aboute to put
you into any ſuche perill, the remembraunce whereof is more
greeuous vnto me, then if I had felte the force of a thouſande
deathes, and now behold my determination, and what I haue
deuiſed: You haue a houſe not farre hence ſtanding in the feeldes,
whiche you keepe for your ſolace, and recreation in the
time of Sommer: to this houſe I haue deuiſed, how you maie
ſo ſecretly conuey me, that you maie there keepe at your pleaſure
to your owne vſe, and to my greate contentation, where
I maie at pleaſure enioye hym, more dearly beloued vnto me,
then the balles of mine owne eyes. And herewithall ſhe gaue

hym an other Iudas kiſſe, that the Doctor deſired her of all
frendſhip, not to be long in her determination, for that he was
readie to followe her direction, when ſoeuer it would pleaſe
her to commaunde: yea, if it were preſentlie he was readie.
               Miſtreſſe Doritie, who haue driuen the matter to that paſſe
ſhe looked for, ſaied: Naie Maiſter Doctor, there reſteth yet
an other thyng, my houſebandes Ielouſie (as I tolde you) is
ſuche, that there muſt bee greate circumſpection vſed, in the
conueighyng of me awaie, and therefore giue eare to that I
haue deuiſed: I haue in my houſe a certaine Male with ſtuffe,
that is left with me, to be ſent by the Carriers into the Countrie,
whereof my houſebande dooeth knowe verie well, this
ſtuffe I will cauſe to be ſecretly taken forthe, and to be ſent to
the Carriers, truſt vp in ſome other thing, without any knowledge
to any, ſauyng to my Maide, that ſhall worke this feate
her ſelf, whoſe truſtineſſe I knowe to bee ſuche, as there is no
ſuſpition to bee had in the matter, the whiche when ſhe hath
doen, ſhe ſhall truſſe vp me in theſame Male, then ſee that you
faile not to morowe in the Euening about eight of the clocke,
diſguiſed in a Porters weede, to come to my houſe to enquire
for theſame Male, whiche you ſhall ſaie, you will beare to the
Carriers, my Maide who ſhall of purpoſe, bee readie to waite
for your commyng at the hower, ſhall make no bones to deliuer
you this Male, and thus without either doubt or Ielouſie
of any one, you maie carrie me into the feeldes, where for your
better eaſe you maie take me forthe, and diſguiſing our ſelues
wee maie walke together, to your houſe aforeſaied, where I
maie remaine without any maner of ſuſpition, or knowledge
to any, ſo long as it ſhall pleaſe your ſelf.
               O moſte excellente deuiſe (quoth the Doctor) I haue this
matter alreadie at my fingers endes, and I warraunte you,
you ſhall ſee me plaie the Porter ſo cunninglie, that how many
ſo euer I meete, there ſhall none of them be able to ſuſpect
me: Thus with a feined kiſſe that ſhe againe beſtdwed of him,
for that time thei departed.
               Miſtreſſe Doritie, in like maner ſent for the Lawier, whom
ſhe handled in like ſorte, as ſhe had doen the Doctor, makyng

hym beleeue, that her houſebandes Ielouſie was ſuche, as ſhe
durſt no more come in his companie: But of her ſelf ſhe loued
hym ſo entirely, that ſhe would hazard any thyng for his ſake,
and becauſe he ſhould the better beleeue it, to morrowe (quoth
ſhe) in the after noone, my houſebande will be forthe of the dores,
wherefore I praie you faile not about three of the Clocke
to come and viſite me, when wee ſhall haue laiſure to diſporte
our ſelues, to our better contentation: Many like enticyng
woordes ſhe vſed, whiche ſo perſwaded the Lawier, then dreadyng
no bad meaſure at all, he promiſed her not to faile, but he
would keepe his hower: and thus departed verie ioyfull, that
he had againe recouered his Miſtreſſe. And the nexte daie, euen
as it had ſtroke three of the Clocke, he was knockyng at
the doore of this Gentlewoman, who lookyng for his commyng,
was readie to receiue hym, and vp thei goe together to
a Chamber, whiche ſhe had appoincted for the purpoſe: where
for a tyme ſhe dalied hym of with deuiſes: And ſodainlie her
maide (according as her Miſtreſſe had giuen her inſtructiōs)
came haſtelie to the Chamber doore, callyng her Miſtreſſe,
ſaiyng: that her Maiſter was come in, and had aſked for her:
Miſtreſſe Doritie, who was not to learne to plaie her parte,
ſemed to be ſtriken into a wonderfull feare, alas? quoth ſhe to
the Lawier) for the loue of GOD keepe your ſelf ſecret for a
time, that I maie go doune and rid him awaie, if it be poſſible,
and thus goyng her waie doune, ſhe ſhuttes the dore after her.
               The Lawier who was readie to beraie hym ſelf for feare,
crepte vnder the Bedde, where ſhe lette hym alone, the ſpace
of an hower, and then commyng vp into the Chamber, and
could not ſee hym, ſhe beganne to muſe what was become of
hym: he hearyng one was come in at the Chamber doore, beganne
to prie out vnder the Beddes feete, and perceiuyng by
the ſkirte of her goune who it was, with a faint voice he ſaid:
Alas my deare what newes, is your houſebande gone? Ah my
louing freende (quoth ſhe) I was neuer ſo hardlie beſet ſith I
was borne: my houſebande i
                     •
                   come home with three or fower
of his freendes, whiche he mette withall in the Citee, and bee
come out of the Countrie of 
                     〈◊〉
                  , to make merrie with

him, and here thei be appoincted this night to Suppe, and hether
bee come to their beddes, ſo long as thei remaine in the
Citee, and this Chamber is appointed for twoo of them to lie
in, that for my life I knowe not what ſhifte to make, nor how
to conueigh you hence.
               Alas (quoth the Lawier) then am I vtterlie vndoen, for the
loue of GOD, deuiſe ſome meanes tonueigh me out of the
houſe, for I would not remaine all night in this perplexitie,
no not for all the golde in the worlde. Miſtreſſe Doritie makyng
a little pauſe, ſodainlie as though ſhe had an inuention,
but euen then come into her hedde, ſhe ſaied.
               I haue this onely remedie left, here is in the houſe a Male
full of ſtuffe, whiche ſhould this night be ſent to the Carriers:
my deuiſe is therefore to take forthe the ſtuffe, and laie it aſide
till ſometime the next weeke, when I will make ſhift to ſend
the ſtuffe awaie verie well, and you ſhalbee preſentlie packed
vp in this Male, whiche my Maide ſhall doe while I am belowe
with my houſebande and his freendes, and ſo cauſing a
Porter to bee ſent for, he ſhall carrie you to your Chamber, or
to any other place, where it ſhall pleaſe your ſelf, ſo that my
houſebande ſeyng this Male goe forthe of doores, will thinke
it is the ſtuffe, whiche he knoweth this night ſhould be ſent.
               No better deuiſe in the worlde (quoth the Lawier) and let
the Porter conueigh this Male to my Chamber, you knowe
where, and deliuer it to my man, as ſent from his M
                     •
                  iſter, and
will him to giue him fortie pence for his labor.
               The matter thus determined, Miſtreſſe Doritie ſent vp her
Maide with this emptie Male, wherein ſhe truſſed vp the Lawier,
and there ſhe left him liyng from fiue of the Clocke, vntill
it was paſt eight, and in the Sommer ſeaſon the weather
beeyng verie hotte, the Lawier had like to haue been ſmothered
where he laie: at the length according to poinctmente, comes
maiſter Doctor diſguiſed like a right porter, with a long
gaberdine doune to the calfe of his legges, and he enquires
for a Male that ſhould goe to the Carriers, yea a Marie (quoth
the Maide) if you pleaſe to come in, it is readie for you, the
Doctor beyng a good ſturdie lubber, tooke vp the Male verie

eaſilie for feare of bruſing the Gentlewomans tender ribbes,
whom he had thought he had vpon his backe, and thus forth of
doores he goes, takyng the next waie towardes his lodgyng.
               Miſtreſſe Doritie with her beloued Souldiour (whom ſhe
had made priuie to her deuiſe) ſtoode where ſhe might ſe Maiſter
Doctor in his Porters weede, goyng with his carriage,
whereat when thei had awhile ſported them ſelues, the Souldier
followed maiſter Doctor an eaſie pace, but onely to kepe
the ſight of him, and the Doctor he tooke his waie through the
ſtreates with a maine pace, till he had recouered the feeldes,
where looking about him, to ſee what companie was ſtirryng
ſawe no bodie nere hym but the Souldier, whom he did not
knowe, and then croſſyng the waie from the common pathes,
he came to the ſide of a Bancke, and beeyng wearie (as he
was not to be blamed, conſideryng the knauiſhe burthen that
he had borne vpon his backe) he laiyng doune the Male tenderlie
vppon the ſide of the Bancke) ſeeyng no bodie but the
Souldier, who was but a little diſtaunce from hym, ſaied. Ah
my ſweete wenche, I can ſee no creature ſtirryng in all the
feeldes, but one man whiche is commyng this waie, who ſo
ſone as he is paſte, I will vndoe the Male.
               The Lawier in the Male, when he felt the Porter laie him
doune, was in a good hope, that he had been in his own chamber,
but hearing by theſe ſpeeches, that he was in the feeldes,
began to cōiecture aſſuredly, that the Porter had ſpoken thoſe
wordes to ſome woman that was in this companie, with whō
he was confederate, for the ſtealyng of ſuche thinges as thei
ſhould finde in the Male, and that when thei ſhould open the
Male and finde hym there, thei would not ſticke to cutte his
throte for feare, leaſt he ſhould bewraie them, and for the onely
ſpoile of ſuche thinges as he had aboute him, that the Lawier
was in ſuche a perplexitie, that he wiſt not for his life what he
might doe: one while he had thought to haue cried out for help
then he thought it would the ſoner bring him to his ende, and
as he continued thus in the middeſt of his muſe, the Souldier
was come to the place, and ſpeakyng to the Doctor, he ſaied:
Porter it ſeemeth thou haſte been knauiſhlie loden, for I perceiue

thou art very hot, but what haſt thou in the male, I pray
thee, that thou art carriyng his waie ſo late in the Euening.
Marie (quoth the doctor) I haue ware there ſuche as it is, haſt
thou ware knaue (quoth the Souldier) is that a ſufficiente anſwere,
what ware is it, mennes ware, or womens ware. Sir I
knowe not (quoth the Porter) I haue but the cariyng of it to a
gentlemans houſe that is here hard by, well (ꝙ the Souldier)
vndoe your truſſe, for I will ſe what wares you haue there, before
you and I departe, why ſir (ꝙ the Porter) ſhould I bee ſo
bold to vndo a gentlemans male, that is deliuered me in truſt
to be caried, no ſir you ſhall pardon me, if you were my father,
and herewithall he tooke the male vpon his backe, and began
to go his waies. But the Souldier knowing better what was
in the Male, then the Porter himſelf that caried it, and beyng
prouided for the purpoſe with a good Cudgell, let driue halfe
a doſen blowes at the Male, as it laie vpon his backe ſo ſurelie,
that the Lawier cries out, alas, alas, alas. Why Porter
(quoth the Souldier) haue you quicke wares in your Maleno
meruaile you were ſo daintie in the ſhewyng of it.
               Here withall the Doctor laied doune his Male, and kneelyng
doune to the Souldier, ſaied. Ah ſir for the loue of God
bee content, and I will not let to confeſſe the whole truthe vnto
you: I haue a Gentlewoman in my Male, whiche I haue
ſtolne from her houſebande, and ſeyng you to be a gentleman
but yong in yeres, and impoſſible but that you ſhould loue the
companie of a faire woman, beholde, I will deliuer her vnto
you, to vſe at your pleaſure, and when you ſhall ſee tyme, to
reſtore her vnto me againe, deſiryng you ſir of all curteſie, to
ſeeke no other diſpleaſure againſt vs. You haue ſaied well (ꝙ
the Souldier) but is ſhe ſuche a one as is to bee liked, faire,
freſhe, and yong. Truſt me ſir (ꝙ the Doctor) if ſhe bee not as
faire, and well liking as any Dame within the walles of this
Citee, make me an example to all other, how thei ſhal diſſemble
with a Gentlemanne ſuche as you are. Thou ſaieſt well
(ꝙ the Souldier) and now I thinke long till I haue a ſight
of this Paragon, whiche thou haſte ſo praiſed vnto me. You
ſhall ſee her ſtraight waie (ꝙ the Doctor) and herewithall he

beganne to vnlaſe the Male with greate expedition, whiche
whē he had vnloſed at the one ende, that he might come to the
ſight of this Gentlewomans face (as he had thought) he ſaied
to the Souldier, ſee here the ſight which you ſo muche deſire,
and pullyng the ende of the Male open with his handes, the
Lawier thruſte forthe his hedde, and looked with ſuche a piteous
countenaunce, as though he had been readie to be turned
of the Ladder: But the Doctor ſeeyng a face to appeare with
a long Bearde, was in ſuche a maze, that he could not tell in
the worlde what he might ſaie. The Souldier who had neuer
more a doe then to forbeare laughter, to ſee how theſe twoo,
the one beheld the other: Saied to the Doctor, and is this the
faire Gentlewoman that thou haſte promiſed me, haſte thou
no bodie to mocke but me, that with ſuche commendations
thou giueſt praiſe to a woman, whereby to ſette my teeth an
edge, and then in thende thus to delude me? But I will teach
thee how to plaie the knaue againe while thou liueſt, and here
withall he laied on with his Cudgell, ſparyng neither hedde,
ſhoulders, armes, backe, nor breaſt, and ſo bee bumbaſted the
Doctor, that for the ſpace of a quarter of a yere after, he was
not able to lift an Eurinall ſo hie as his hedde.
               The Lawier who had nothyng out of the Male but his
hedde, ſeeyng this fraie, ſtruggeled ſo muche as he could, to
haue gotten forthe, and to haue runne awaie, while the Porter
was a beatyng, but it would not bee, his armes were ſo ſurely
laced doune by his ſides, that for his life he could not get them
forthe.
               The Souldier, when he had throughlie requited Maiſter
Doctors Knauerie, that he had vſed againſt his beloued Miſtreſſe
in his letter, lefte hym, and beganne to bende hymſelf
towardes the Lawier: The Lawier ſeyng the Souldier comming,
had thought verely that he had been ſome good fellowe
that was walkyng there ſo late, to haue taken ſome prey, ſaid:
Oh ſir, for the loue of God ſpare my life, and take my purſe, to
whom the Souldier aunſwered: naie villaine, my commyng
is neither to take thy life nor thy purſe, but to miniſter reuengemente
for thy large ſpeeches, whiche like a diſcourteous

wretche thou haſte vſed againſt a woman, and there with all
laied vpon hym ſo long as he was able to fetch any breath, and
then callyng the Porter vnto hym, he ſaied: Let theſe wordes
whiche I minde to ſpeake ſuffice for a warning to you bothe,
if euer I maie learne that any of you hereafter this do vſe any
miſdemeanour towardes any woman, either by word or writing,
aſſure your ſelues that although I haue but dallied with
you at this tyme, I wil deuiſe ſome one meane or other to miniſter
reuenge, that all ſuche as you bee, ſhal take an example
by you. And thus I leaue you, goyng his waie to his ſweete
harte, tellyng her the whole diſcourſe how he had ſpedde, by
whom he was welcomed with a whole laſt of kiſſes, &c.
               And now to returne to thoſe two that were left in the feeldes,
as you haue heard: the Doctor takyng good vewe of the
Lawyer, knewe him very well, but the Doctor was ſo diſguiſed
in his Porters apparell, that the Lawyer did not knowe
hym, but ſaied vnto hym, a miſcheef light of al ſuche Porters,
that when thei bee put in truſt with carriages into the Citie,
will bring them into the feeldes to ſuche banquettes as theſe,
Marie ꝙ the Doctor a miſcheefe take all ſuche burthens, that
when a man hath almoſt broken his back with bearing them,
and then ſhall receiue ſuche a recompence for his labour as I
haue doen: Villaine (ꝙ the Lawyer) why diddeſt thou not carie
me to my chamber as thou wert willed when thou diddeſt
receiue me, I would I had carried thee to the Gallowes (ꝙ
the Doctor) ſo I had eſcaped this ſcouryng, but I perceiue
this banquet was prepared for vs bothe, and here withall with
muche adoe he got of the Porters coate, and makyng hymſelf
knowne to the Lawyer, eache of them conferred with the other,
how cunningly thei had been dealt withall, and did think
it not beſt for them any farther to deale in the matter, for feare
of farther miſcheefe, but with muche adoe got them home,
where the Lawyer kept his bedde very long after: But the
Doctor tooke Sparmaceti, and ſuch like thinges that be good
for a bruſe, and recouered hymſelf in a ſhorte ſpace.
               Now it fell out afterwardes that this Souldiour, who liued
in greate credite with Miſtres Doritie (as he had well deſerued)

was imployed in the Kynges warres againſt forraine
fooes, with a greate number of others, where he ſpent his life
in his Princes quarrell, & Miſtres Doritie, ſorrowyng a long
tyme the loſſe of ſo faithfull a freende, ſeeyng the diuerſitie of
men, that ſhe had made her choiſe amongſt three, and had foūd
but one honeſt, feared to fall into any further infamie, contented
herſelf to liue orderly, and faithfully with her houſbande,
all the reſt of her life, and her houſband who neuer vnderſtood
any of theſe actions, loued her dearely to his diyng daie.
               And now to ſaie ſomethyng of the other brother and his
wife, which as you haue heard was ſuche a notable ſcold, that
her houſbande could neuer enioy good daie, nor merie houre:
She was ſuche a deuill of her tongue, and would ſo croſſebite
hym with ſuche tauntes, and ſpightfull quippes, as if at any
tyme he had been merrie in her companie, ſhe would tell hym
his mirthe proceeded rather in the remembraunce, of that ſhe
had brought hym, then for any loue that he had to her ſelf: if he
were 
                     •
                  adde, it was for greefe ſhe was not dead, that he might
enioye that ſhe had. If he vſed to goe abroad, then he had been
ſpendyng of that he neuer gott hymſelf. If he taried at home,
ſhe would ſaie it was happie he had gotten ſuche a wife, that
was able to keepe hym ſo idely. If he made any prouiſion for
good cheare, or to fare well in his houſe, ſhe would bid hym
ſpende that whiche he hymſelf had brought. If he ſhewed hym
ſelf to be ſparyng, then ſhe would not be pincht of that whiche
was her owne. Thus doe what he could, all that euer he did
was taken in the worſt parte: And ſeyng that by no maner of
faire meanes he was able to reclaime her: in the ende he deuiſed
this waie, hymſelf with a truſtie freende that he made of
his counſaile, got and pinioned her armes ſo faſt, that ſhe was
not able to vndoe them, and then puttyng her into an old Peticoate,
whiche he rent and tattered in peeces of purpoſe, and
ſhakyng her heire looſe about her eyes, tare her Smock ſleeues
that her armes were all bare, and ſcratchyng them all ouer
with a Bramble that the bloud followed, with a greate
chaine about her legge, wherwith he tied her in a darke houſe
that was on his Backſide, and then calling his neighbours about

her, he would ſeeme with greate ſorrowe to lament his
wiues diſtreſſe, tellyng them that ſhe was ſodainly become
Lunatique, whereas by his geaſture he tooke ſo great greefe,
as though he would likewiſe haue runne madd for companie.
But his wife (as he had attired her) ſeemed (in deede) not to be
well in her wittes, but ſeyng her houſbandes maners, ſhewed
her ſelf in her conditions to bee a right Bedlem, ſhe vſed no other
wordes but Curſynges and Bannynges, criyng for the
Plague and the Peſtilence, and that the Deuill would teare
her houſbande in peeces: the companie that were aboute her,
thei would exhorte her, good neighbour forget theſe idle ſpeeches,
whiche doeth ſo muche diſtemper you: and cal vpon God
and he will ſurely helpe you. Call vpon God for helpe (ꝙ the
other) wherein ſhould he helpe me, vnleſſe he would conſume
this wretch with fire & brimſtone, other helpe I haue no neede
neede of. Her houſbande, he deſired his neighbours for Gods
that thei would helpe him to praie for her, and thus altogether
kneelyng in her preſence, he began to ſaie (Miſerere) whiche
al thei ſaied after him, but this did ſo ſpight and vexe her, that
ſhe neuer gaue ouer her railing, and ragyng againſt them all.
But in the ende, her houſband who by this ſhame had thought
to haue reclaimed her, made her to become from euil to worſe,
and was glad hymſelf in the ende, cleane to leaue, and to get
hym ſelf from her into a ſtraunge Countrey, where he conſumed
the reſt of his life.
               Thus to conclude, beſides the matter that I meane to
proue, Men maie gather example here, when thei goe a Wiuyng,
not to chooſe for beautie without vertue: nor for riches
without good conditions. There bee other examples
if thei be well marked, worth the learnyng:
bothe for men and women, whiche
I leaue to the diſcretion of the reader.
               FINIS.
            
            
               
               Of Gonſales and his vertuous
wife Agatha.
               
                  The Argument of the ſixt Historie.
                  ¶Gonſales, pretending to poiſon his verteous wife for the
loue of a Courtiſane, craued the help of Alonſo a Scholer
ſomethyng practiſed in Phyſicke, who in the ſteade
of poyſon gaue hym a pouder, whiche did but bryng
her into a ſounde ſleepe duryng certaine houres, but
Gonſales iudging (in deede) that his wife had been
dead: cauſed her immediatly to be buried: The Scholer
againe knowyng the operation of his Poulder, for
the greate loue he bare to Agatha, went to the Ʋault
where ſhe was entombed, aboute the hower that he
knowe ſhe ſhould awake. When after ſome ſpeeches vſed
betweene them, he carried her home to his owne
houſe, where ſhe remained for a ſpace, in the meane
tyme Gonſales beyng married to his Courtiſane, was
by her accuſed to the Gouernour for the poiſonyng of
his firſt wife, whereof beeyng apprehended he confeſſed
the fact, and was therefore iudged to dye, whiche
beyng knowne to Agatha, ſhe came to the Iudge, and
clearyng her houſbande of the crime, thei liued together
in perfect peace and amitie.
               
               
                  THere was ſometyme in the Citie
of Siuill in Spaine, a Gentleman
named Gonſales, who though he
were a man of yeres ſufficient to
be ſtaied, and to giue ouer the wā
                  ton
pranckes of youthfull follie.
Yet was he by nature ſo enclined
to followe his luſtes, and withall
ſo variable and ſo vnconſtant, that

he ſuffered hymſelf to be ruled wholy by his paſſiōs, and meaſured
all his doyng rather by his delightes and pleaſures, thē
by ſounde diſcourſe and rule of reaſon. This Gentleman fallyng
in loue with a Gentlewoman of the ſame Citie, whoſe
name was Agatha, ſought all the meanes he could to haue her
to wife. And her freendes although thei were wel enough enformed
of the diſpoſition of Gonſales, whereby thei might
haue feared the entreatie of their kinſwoman, for that thei
knewe hym very riche, and her dowrie not to be very greate,
thei were well content to beſtowe her vpon hym: and thought
that thei had in ſo doyng placed her very well. But before the
firſt yeare after their Marriage was fully expired, Gonſales
followyng his wonted humour, and waxyng wearie of loue,
grewe to deſire chaunge, giuyng thereby a notable example
for women to learne how little it is to their commoditie or
quiet, to matche then
                     •
                  iſe. 
                     〈…〉
                   that be rather riche then
wiſe: and how muche it were better for them to be married to
men, then to their goodes.
               For beeyng come to ſoiourne in that Streate wherein he
dwelt, a notable Courteſane, who to the outward ſhewe was
very faire, though inwardly ſhe was moſte foule, as ſhe that
vnder a goodly perſonage, did couer a wicked and dangerous
minde, corrupted with all vices (as for the moſt parte al ſuche
women doen.) It was Gonſales chaunce to be one of the firſt
that fell into thoſe ſnares, whiche ſhe had ſett for ſuche ſimple
mens mindes, as haunt after the exteriour apparance of thoſe
thinges, whiche their ſenſes make them to delight in, and not
conſidering the daunger wherevnto thei commit themſelues,
by followyng of their diſordinate appetites, doe ſuffer them
ſelues to be entrapped by ſuche leude Dames: Among which
this (forſoothe) was one that was of ſinguler ſkill to captiue
mens mindes, which by experience and by the naturall diſpoſition
of her mynde, bent wholy to deceipt and naughtineſſe:
had learned a thouſand giles and artes, whiche waie to allure
men with the pleaſauntneſſe of her baites. Wherefore after
he was once entangled with her ſnares, he fell ſo farre beyond
all reaſon, and paſt al beleef, to dote vpon this Strumpet that

he could finde no reſt, nor no contentment, but ſo long as he
was with her. But ſhe beeyng as diſſolute a Dame as any liued
in the world, and as greedie likewiſe of gaine as euer any
was of her profeſſion, would not content her ſelf with Gonſales
alone, but yeelded vnto as many as liſt to enioye her, if thei
came with their handes full, and ſpared for no coſt to rewarde
her liberally. Whiche thyng was vnto hym, that was ſo beſotted
on her, ſo greeuous and ſo intollerable, that nothyng
could be more.
               There was at that ſame tyme, a Scholer in the Citie that
ſtudied in Phiſicke: with whom Gonſales had familiar acquaintance,
and the Scholler therby hauyng acceſſe and conuerſation
in his houſe, began ſo feruently to bee in loue with
Agatha his wife, that he deſired nothyng ſo earneſtly in the
worlde as to enioye her, and to winne her good will. Wherefore
hauyng (as I haue ſaied) free acceſſe to her houſe, and to

                     •
                  eclare his affection vnto her without ſuſpition, he ceaſed not

                     〈◊〉
                   al the meanes he was able to deuiſe, to ſollicite and to procure
her to yeeld vnto his deſire. With his endeuour and earneſt
ſuite, although it were vnto Agatha, noiſome and diſpleaſant,
as ſhe that was diſpoſed to keepe her ſelf honeſt: and that
ſhe could in that reſpect haue been very glad, that he would
forbeare to frequent her houſe. Yet knowyng her houſbande
to be a man of no very great ſubſtance, and but ſlenderly ſtuffed
in the hedpeece: and that he delighted greatly in the familiaritie
of the Scholler, ſhe forced her ſelf to endure with pacience,
the importunate moleſtation, whiche he ſtill wearied
her withall. Takyng from hym neuertheleſſe all hope, to obtaine
at any tyme any fauour at her handes, and cuttyng hym
ſhorte from all occaſions, as muche as ſhe could, whereby he
might haue cauſe to moleſt her, or to looke for any thyng to
proceede from her, that were leſſe then honeſt.
               The Scholler perceiuyng that his owne trauaile, to win
her affection was but labour loſt, thought beſt to trie if by the
allurement or perſwaſion of any other, he might happly moue
her to ſhew her ſelf more courteous, and fauourable vnto him.
Wherefore hauyng founde out an olde Mother Elenour, a

diſciple of the Spaniſhe Celeſtina, ſuche a one as was moſte
cunnyng and ſkilfull in mollifiyng of womens myndes, to
worke them afterwarde to receiue the impreſſions of their louers,
he cauſed her to take acquaintaunce of Agatha, and by
degrees (as though ſhe had been moued with pittie and compaſſion
of caſe) to declare vnto her the loue whiche her houſebande
bare vnto the Courtiſan
                     •
                  : and to ſhew her how vnworthie
he was that ſhe ſhould be true vnto hym. And in the ende
paſſing from one ſpeech to an other, ſhe ſaied plainly vnto her,
that it was a great follie, ſince her houſband did take his pleaſures
abroade with other women, to ſtand to his allowances,
and to take the leauyng of his Strumpets, and therewith to
bee content: and that, if ſhe were in her caſe, and had a houſebande
that would ſtrike with the ſworde, ſhe would vndoubtedly
requite hym and ſtrike with the ſcabberde, ſo ſhe counſelled
her to doe likewiſe.
               
                  Agatha beyng a very diſcrete Gentlewoman, and louyng
her houſbande as an honeſt woman ought to doe, ſaied to her
in aunſwere of her talke, that ſhe would bee right glad to ſee
her houſbande to be ſuche a man as ſhe wiſhed hym to be, and
as he ought to be. But that ſince ſhe ſawe it would not be, and
that he could not frame hym ſelf thereto, ſhe would not take
from hym or barre hym of that libertie, whiche either the cuſtome
of the corrupted worlde, or the priuiledge that men had
vſurped vnto themſelues, had giuen vnto them. And that ſhe
would neuer for her parte violate or breake that faithe whiche
ſhe had giuen hym, nor ſlacke or neglect that care and regard
of her honour, whiche all women by kinde and nature ought
to haue, as the thyng that maketh them to be moſte commended
throughout the world, let her houſbande doe what he liſt,
and like and loue as many other women as pleaſed hym. And
that ſhe thought her ſelf ſo muche the rather bounde ſo to doe,
becauſe he did not in the reſt miſuſe her any waie, or ſuffer her
to want any thing that reaſonably ſhe could deſire or craue at
his handes: and for that ſhe had not brought hym in effect any
other dowrie worthie to bee accompted of then her honeſtie.
Wherefore ſhe was fully reſolued neuer to varie from that

conſtant reſolution. And finally ſhewyng her ſelf ſomewhat
moued and ſtirred with Choler, ſhe tolde her that ſhe maruailed
at her not a little (that beyng a woman of thoſe yeres) that
ſhe ſhould rather reprehend and chide yong folke, if ſhe ſhould
ſee them ſo bent, then encourage them to euil, & muſed muche
ſhe could finde in her harte to giue her ſuche counſell: whiche
ſhe aſſured her was ſo diſpleaſant and ſo vngratefull, as if frō
hence forthe ſhe durſt preſume to ſpeake thereof any more, ſhe
would make her vnderſtande perchaunce to her ſmarte, how
ill ſhe could awaie with ſuche pandarly practiſes.
               This olde Hag hauyng had her head waſhed thus without
ſope, departed from Agatha, and came vnto the Scholler and
tolde hym in breefe how ill ſhe had ſped, and in what ſorte the
honeſt Gentlewoman had cloſed her mouth, whereof the ſcholer
was very ſorie: yet for all this, he thought he would not
giue ouer his 
                     〈◊〉
                   imagining that there is no hart ſo hard
or fiintie, but by long loue, by perſeuerance, praier, and teares,
maie in the ende be mollified and wrought to be tender.
               In this meane ſeaſon, Gonſales ſtill continuyng his olde
familiaritie with the Scholler, and hauyng made hym priuie
of the loue he bare vnto the Courtiſane, and what a greefe it
was vnto him to ſee her enioyed by any other then by himſelf:
one daie among other talke betweene them of that matter, he
ſaied bnto the Sholler, that it neuer grieued him ſo muche to
haue a wife as it did then, for that if he had bin vnmaried he
would haue taken Aſelgia (for ſo was the Courtiſane named)
to be his wife, without whom he could finde no reſt nor quiete
in mynde, and ſo long as euery man hath a ſhare with him in
her, he accompted himſelf as il as if he had had no parte in her
at all. And thereto ſaied further, that aſſuredly if it were not
for feare of the Lawe, he would eaſe hymſelf of that burden by
riddyng of Agatha out of the worlde. Thereunto replied the
Scholler, ſaiyng that in deede it was a greeuous thyng for a
Gentleman to be combred with a wife, whō he could not finde
in his harte to loue, and that in ſuche a caſe, he that did ſeeke
the beſt waie he could to deliuer himſelf of that yoke, was not
altogether vnexcuſable, though the rigor of Iuſtice had appoincted

ſeuere puniſhementes, for ſuche as violentlie ſhould
attempt, or execute any ſuche thing. But that men that were
wiſe, could well enough finde out the meanes, whiche waie to
woorke their intentes, without incurryng any daunger of the
Lawe for the matter. Whiche language in deede he vſed vnto
hym, but to feede his humour, and to ſee wherevnto that talke
in fine would tende: And according to his deſire before it was
long. Gonſales hauing vſed the like ſpeeches, twoo or three times,
and ſtill findyng him to ſoothe his ſaiyng, tooke one daie
a good harte vnto him, and brake his minde vnto the Scholer
at large, and in plaine termes, to this effect.
               
                  Alonſo (for that was the Scholers name) I doe aſſure my
ſelf, and make full accoumpt, that thou art my faſte freend, as
I am thyne, and I doubte not but that the freendſhip, whiche
is betweene vs, doeth make thee no leſſe ſorie then my ſelf, to
ſee me greeue with this continuall trouble of minde, wherein
I liue, becauſe I can not compaſſe to take this woman, whom
I loue ſo dearelie to bee my wife, and by that meanes come to
haue the full poſſeſſion of her vnto my ſelf, whiche is the thing
I doe deſire aboue all other thinges in the worlde. And for as
muche as I dooe perſwade my ſelf, that by thy meanes, and
with the helpe of thy profeſſion, I maie happ to finde ſome remedie
for my greef. I haue thought good to tell thee a conceit,
whiche I haue thought on oftentimes: wherein I meane
to vſe thee and thy aſſiſtaunce, for the better accompliſhing of
my purpoſe in that behalfe. Aſſuring my ſelf that thou wilte
not refuſe, or denie me any furtheraunce, that thy ſkill maie
aforde me, or ſhrinke and drawe backe, from the performyng
of any freendlie offer, whereby I maie come by to finde ſome
eaſe of minde, and bee deliuered of that intollerable tormente
of ſpirite, wherewith I am oppreſſed, for the loue of this Aſelgia,
in whom I haue fixed and ſet all my ioyes and delightes.
Thou ſhalte therefore vnderſtande, that I am determined as
ſone as I can poſſible, to ridde my handes of Agatha my wife
and by one meane or other to cauſe her to dye: And I haue
been a good while aboute the execution of this my intent, but
becauſe I could neuer yet deuiſe the beſte waie to performe it,

ſo that her death might not bee laied vnto my charge. I haue
delaied it hetherto, and perforce, contente to beare the heauie
burthen of my greeued minde till now, whiche hence forward
I am reſolued to beare no longer, if thou wilte accordyng to
my truſt in thee, and as the freendſhip whiche is betweene vs
doeth require, graunt me thy furtheraunce and helping hand.
Wherefore, knowing that through thy long ſtudie in Phiſick
thou haſte attained ſo greate knowledge, that thou canſte deuiſe
a nomber of ſecretes, whereof any one might be ſufficient
to bryng my purpoſe to effect. I doe require thee to fulfill my
deſire in that behalfe, and to giue me thy helpe, to bryng this
my deſire to paſſe: Whiche if thou dooe, I will acknowledge
my ſelf ſo long as I ſhall liue, to be ſo muche bound vnto thee,
that thou ſhalt commaunde me, and all that I haue, in any occaſion
of thine, as freelie and as boldlie, as thou maieſt now any
thing that is thine owne.
               The Scholer when he had heard Gonſales and his demaunde,
ſtoode ſtil awhile, as muſing vpon the requeſt, and in
the meane while diſcourſed with himſelf, how by the occaſion
of his intent, and reſolution of Gonſales, he might perhappes
finde out a waie, to come by the poſſeſſion of Agatha, and to
haue her in his handes, and at his deuotion. But keepyng ſecrete
his thoughtes and meanyng, he made hym aunſwere:
That true it was, that he wanted not ſecret compoſiſſions, to
make folke die with poiſon, ſo as it could neuer bee diſcerned
by any Phiſition, or other, whether the cauſe were violent, or
no, but that for twoo reſpectes he thought it not good to yeeld
vnto his requeſte. The one, for that Phiſicke and Phiſitions,
were appointed in the worlde, not to bereue men of their liues,
but to preſerue them, and to cure them of ſuche diſeaſes,
as were daungerous and perillous vnto them: The other, becauſe
he did foreſee, in what ieoperdie he ſhould put his owne▪
life, whenſoeuer he ſhould diſpoſe himſelf to worke any ſuche
practiſe, conſidering how ſeuerelie the lawes haue preſcribed
puniſhmentes for ſuche offences. And that it might fall out,
how warelie ſo euer the thing were wrought, that by ſome ſeldome
or vnlooked for accident, the matter might bee diſcouered

(as for the moſte parte it ſemeth, that God will haue it) in
whiche caſe he were like to incurre no leſſe danger then Gonſales,
and bothe (aſſured) without remiſſion to loſe their liues.
And that therefore, he would not for the firſt reſpect, take vppon
hym to doe that, whiche was contrarie to his profeſſion
                     •
                  
nor for the ſeconde, hazard his life to ſo certaine a daunger, for
ſo hatefull a thing, as thoſe practizes are to all the worlde.
               
                  Gonſales verie ſorie to heare his deniall, told hym that the
Lawes and dueties of freendſhip, doeth diſpence well enough
with a manne, though for his freende he ſtraine ſometyme his
conſcience. And therefore, he hoped that he would not forſake
hym, in a cauſe that cōcerne him ſo waightily as that did. And
that neither of thoſe twoo reſpectes (if thei were well conſidered)
ought to be able to remoue him from pleaſuryng of his
freend. For that now adaies, aſwell were thei accompted and
eſteemed Phiſitions, that killed their Pacientes, as thei that
did cure them: and becauſe the thyng beeyng kepte ſecrete betweene
them twoo alone, he needes not to doubte, or feare any
daunger of his life by the Lawe. For if it ſhould by any miſchaunce
happen, that he ſhould be imputed, or burthened with
poiſoning of his wife, he aſſured him that he would neuer whileſt
he had breathe, confeſſe of whom he had the poiſon, but
would rather ſuffer his tongue to bee pulled out of his hedde,
or endure any torment that might bee deuiſed.
               The Scholler at the laſte ſeemyng to bee wonne, by the
earneſtneſſe of his petition: Saied, that vppon that condition
and promes, of not reuealing him at any time, he would be cō
                  tente,
rather to ſhewe hymſelf freendlie vnto hym, then a true
profeſſour of his Science, or an exacte regarder of his conſcience:
and that he would doe as he would haue him.
               And hauyng lefte Gonſales verie glad and ioyfull, for that
his promes, he wente home, and made a certaine compoſition
of mixture of pouders, the vertue whereof was ſuche, that it
would make them that tooke any quantitie thereof, to ſleape
ſo ſoundlie, that thei ſhould for the ſpace of certaine howers
ſeme vnto all men, to be ſtarke dedde. And the next daie he retourned
to Gonſales▪
                   and to deliuer it vnto him, ſaiyng: Gonſales,
                  
you haue cauſed me to dooe a thyng, I proteſte I would
not dooe it for my life: But ſince you maie ſee thereby, that I
haue regarded more your freendſhippe, then my duetie, or the
conſideration of that, whiche is honeſt and lawfull: I muſt require
you eftſones to remember your promeſſe, and that you
will not declare to any creature liuing, that you haue had this
poiſon of me.
               Whiche thing Gonſales verie conſtauntlie vpon his othe,
did promiſe him againe, and hauyng taken the pouder of him,
aſked hym in what ſorte he was to vſe it: And he tolde hym,
that if at Supper, he did caſte it there vpon her meate, or into
her brothe, ſhe ſhould die that night following, without either
paine or torment, or any greeuous accidentes, but goe awaie
euen as though ſhe were ſleape. That Euenyng at Supper
tyme, Gonſales failed not to put the pouder into his wiues potage,
who hauyng taken it, as ſone as Supper was doen, feelyng
her ſelf verie heauie and drouſie, wente to her Chamber,
and gather to bedde (for ſhe laie not with Gonſales, but when
he liſte to call he, whiche had been verie ſeldome, ſince he did
fall into loue with the Strumpet) and within an hower after,
the operation of the pouder tooke ſuche force in her bodie, that
ſhe laie as though ſhe had been dead, and altogether ſenceleſſe,
Gonſales in like ſort when he ſawe his time went to his bedd,
and liyng all that night with a troubled mynde, thinkyng
what would become of Agatha, and what ſucceſſe his enterpriſe
would take: the morning came vpon him, before he could
once cloſe his eyes, whiche beyng come he roſe, not doubtyng
but that he ſhould aſſuredlie finde his wife dedde, as Alonſo
had promiſed him. And as ſoone as he was vp, he wente out of
his houſe, and ſtaied but an hower abroad, and then he retourned
home againe, and aſked his Maide, whether her Miſtres
were vp or no. The Maiden made him aunſwere, that ſhe was
yet a ſleape: And he makyng as though he had meruailed at
her long liyng in bedde, demaunded her how it happened that
ſhe was ſo ſluggiſhe that Mornyng, contrarie to her cuſtome,
whiche was to riſe euery Mornyng by breake of the daie, and
had her goe and wake her, for he would haue her to giue hym

ſome thing, that laie vnder her Keyes. The wenche according
to her Maiſters commaundement, went to her Miſtres bedde
ſide, and hauyng called her once or twiſe ſome what ſoftelie,
when ſhe ſawe ſhe waked not, ſhe laied her hande vppon her,
and giuing her a ſhagge, ſhe ſaied withall, Miſtres awake, my
Maiſter calleth for you. But ſhe liyng ſtill, and not awakyng
for all that the Maide tooke her by the arme, and beganne to
ſhake her good and harde: and ſhe not vnderſtandyng, neither
aunſwering, nor ſtirring hande or foote. The Maide returned
to her Maiſter, and tolde hym that for aught ſhe could doe, ſhe
could not gette her Miſtres to awake. Gonſales hearyng the
Maide to ſaie ſo, was glad in his minde: But feinyng himſelf
to bee buſied about ſomewhat els, and that he regarded little
her ſpeeche, he bidde her goe againe, and ſhake her till ſhe did
waken. The Maide did ſo, and rolled and tumbled her in her
bedde, and all in vaine: wherefore commyng againe vnto her
Maiſter, ſhe ſaied vnto him, that vndoubtedlie ſhe did beleeue,
that her Miſtres his wife was dedde, for ſhe had founde her verie
colde, and rolled her vp and doune the bedde, and that yet
ſhe ſtirred not. What? dedde ꝙ Gonſales, as if he had been all
agaſte and amazed, and riſing therewithall, he wente to her
beddes ſide, and called her, and ſhaked her, and wrong her by
the fingers, and did all that might be, as he thought, to ſe whither
ſhe were aliue? But ſhe not feeling any thing that he did,
laie ſtill like a dedde bodie, or rather like a ſtone.
               Wherfore, when he ſawe his purpoſe had taken ſo good effecte,
to diſſemble the matter, he beganne to crie out, and to lament,
and to deteſt his cruell Deſtinie, that had ſo ſoone bereued
him of ſo kind, ſo honeſt, and ſo faithful a wife: and hauing
in th'ende diſcouered her bodie, and finding no ſpot or marke,
whereby any token or ſigne of poiſonyng might be gathered,
as one that would not ſeme to omit any office of a louing huſbande,
he ſent for the Phiſition to looke vpon her, who hauing
vſed ſome ſuche meanes, as he thought meete to make her
come to herſelf: finally, ſeyng her to remain vnmoueable, and
without ſence, concluded, that ſome ſodaine accident had takē
her in the night, wherof ſhe had died, and for dedde he left her.
               
                  
At whiche his reſolution, though Gonſales were very glad
yet to the outward ſhewe, declaryng himſelf to be verie ſorie,
and full of woe and heauineſſe, he behaued hym ſelf in ſnche
cunning ſort, as he made all the worlde beleeue, that he would
not liue long after her. And hauyng called her freendes, and
lamented with them her ſodaine death, and his miſfortune: in
fine, he cauſed her Funerall to bee verie ſumptuouſlie and honourablie
prepared, and buried her in a Vaute, whiche ſerued
for a Toumbe to all his aunceſtours, in a Churche of a Frierie,
that ſtandes without the Citee.
               
                  Alonſo that was verie well acquainted with the place, and
had hymſelf a houſe, not verie farre from that Frierie, wente
his waie that ſame Night vnto his ſaied houſe, and when he
ſawe the tyme to ſerue for his purpoſe, he gatte hym to the
Vaute or Toumbe, wherein Agatha was laied, with one of
theſe little Lanterns, that thei call blinde Lanterns (becauſe
thei tourne them, and hide their light when thei liſte.) And becauſe
he was a yong manne of verie good ſtrengthe, and had
brought with him inſtrumentes of Iron to open the Toumbe,
and lift vp the ſtone that couered it, he gat it open, and hauyng
vnder propped it ſurelie: He went into the Vaute, and tooke
the woman ſtraight waie in his armes, mindyng to bryng her
out, and carrie her awaie ſo a ſleape as ſhe was. But the force
and vertue of the pouder, beeyng finiſhed and ſpent, aſſone as
he moued her, ſhe awaked out of her ſleape, and ſeeyng her ſelf
clad in that ſorte, emong ragges and dedde bones, ſhe began
to tremble, and to cry: alas where am I? Or who hath brought
me hether, wretche that I am? Marie that hath your cruell
and vnfaithfull houſebande, aunſwered the Scholer: who hauyng
poiſoned you, to Marrie a common Strumpet, hath buried
you here, whether I come to trie if by my ſkill I could
reuiue you, and call backe your ſoule by thoſe remedies, which
I had deuiſed vnto your bodie againe: Whiche if I could not
haue doen, as I intended, I was reſolued to haue died hereby
you, and to haue laied my dedde bodie here by yours, to reſte
vntill the latter daie, hopyng that my Spirite ſhould in the
meane while haue come and enioyed yours, where euer it had

been. But ſince the Heauens haue been ſo fauorable vnto me,
as in this extreame daunger wherein you were, to graunte
ſuche vertue vnto the remedies, whiche I haue vſed towarde
you, as the whiche I haue been able to kepe vndiſſolued, your
gentle Spirite with your faire bodie. I hope (my deare) that
you will henceforthe conſider, what the affection of your wicked
houſebande hath been toward you, and how greate good
will, and by conſideration thereof, diſcerne and reſolue which
of vs twoo hath beſte deſerued to be beloued of you.
               
                  Agatha findyng her ſelf in that ſort buried in deede, did eaſily
beleeue the truthe whiche the Scholer told her, and to her
ſelf concluded, that her houſebande had ſhewed hymſelf in her
behalf, a man of all other moſte cruell and diſ
                     ••
                  all. Wherfore
tournyng her ſelf toward the Scholer, ſhe ſaied vnto hym.
               
                  Alonſo, I can not deny, but that my houſebande hath been
to me, not onely vnkinde, but cruell alſo: nor I can not but cō
                  feſſe,
that you haue declared your ſelf to be moſte louyng and
affectioned toward me: and of force I muſt acknowledge my
ſelf beholding vnto you, of no leſſe then of my life, ſince (alas)
I ſe my ſelf here emong dedde bodies buried aliue. But for as
muche, although my houſebande haue broken his vowe to me.
I haue not yet at any tyme failed my faithe to hym. I doe require
you, that if you deſire that I ſhould eſteme this kind and
louing office of yours, as it deſerueth to be eſteemed, or make
accompt of this life, whiche you haue giuen me, you will haue
due regard and conſideration of myne honeſtie, and that you
will not by offering me any villanie (whiche neuertheleſſe I
can not any waie miſſedoubt, where I haue alwaies found ſo
muche and ſo great courteſie) make this your courteous and
pitifull acte to be leſſe commendable, and praiſe worthie then
it is. Whiche if you do bridle your vnlawfull and ſenſuall appetite
and deſire, will remain the moſte vertuous and worthie
of honor and fame, that euer courteous Gentleman hath do
                     •
                  n
for a miſerable woman, ſince the worlde beganne.
               
                  Alonſo failed not with affectuall and manifeſt argumētes
to perſwade her, that her houſebande had now no more right
or title to her at all, and that although he had, yet if ſhe were

wiſe, ſhe ſhould not commit her ſelf vnto his courteſie again,
ſince by this mortall token, he had giuen her a ſufficient teſtimonie
of his ranckor, and euil will towardes her, whereby ſhe
might well enough bee aſſured not to eſcape, when ſoeuer ſhe
ſhould reſolue, to put her ſelf againe into his handes: and that
therefore ſhe was not to make any accoumpte of hym, but to
ſhewe her ſelf thanckfull, for ſo greate a benefite as ſhe had receiued,
and to requite hym ſo with her fauour and courteſie,
as he might now in the ende, attaine to gather the frute of his
long and conſtaunt good will, and of his trauell ſuſtained for
the ſaffegarde of her life. And with thoſe woordes bendyng
himſelf toward her, he would haue taken a kiſſe of her lippes.
But Agatha thruſtyng hym backe, ſaied vnto hym againe. If
my houſebande (Alonſo) haue broken thoſe bandes, wherwith
I was knitte vnto hym by Matrimonie, through his wicked
and leude demeanour, yet haue not I for my parte diſſolued
them, neither will I at any tyme, ſo long as I ſhall liue. As
for committing my ſelf vnto his courteſie, or going any more
into his handes, therein I thinke it good to followe your aduiſe:
not that I would bee vnwillyng to liue and dwell with
him, if I might hope to finde hym better diſpoſed: but becauſe
I would bee lothe to fall eftſones into the like daunger and
greeuous perill. And as for requiting you, for this your commendable
trauaile in my behalf, I knowe not what better recompence
I am able to giue you, then to reſt bound vnto you
for euer, and to acknowledge my ſelf beholdyng vnto pour
courteſie for my life: whiche obligation if it maie ſatiſfie you,
I will be as glad and as content, as I maie be in this miſerable
ſtate wherein I am. But if your meanyng perchaunce be,
that the loſſe of mine honeſtie, ſhould bee the reward and hire
for your paines, I doe beſeche you to depart hence out of this
tombe, and to leaue me here incloſed, for I had rather die here
thus buried quicke, through the 
                     •
                  rueltie of my houſband, then
through any ſuche compaſſion or pitie to ſaue my life, with the
loſſe of mine honour and good name.
               The Scholer by thoſe wordes, perceiued well enough the
honeſt diſpoſition of Agarha, whiche he wondered at, conſideryng

that the terror of death it ſelf was not able once to moue
her from her faithfulneſſe and cōſtancie of mind. And though
it were greeuous vnto hym to finde her ſo ſtedfaſt, yet hopyng
that by tyme in the ende he might ouercome her chaſt and honeſt
purpoſe, aunſwered: that he could not but commende her
for her diſpoſition, though he deſerued a kinder recompence of
his long and feruent loue, and ſhe a more louing and faithfull
houſband. But ſince ſhe was ſo reſolued, he would frame him
ſelf to be content with what ſhe would, and not craue of her any
thyng that ſhe would not willyngly graunt hym to haue.
And therewith helpyng her out of the Sepulcher, he led her
home vnto his houſe, and left her there with an olde woman
that kept his houſe, to whom he recomended her, and whoſe
helpe he was aſſured of, to diſpoſe the good will of Agatha towardes
hym, and the next mornyng returned into the Citie.
               
                  Gonſales after a fewe daies, ſeeming not to be able to liue
without a wife to take care of his familie, wedded that honeſt
Dame Aſelgia, and made her Miſtres of hymſelf and all that
he had. This his newe Mariage ſo ſone contriued, cauſed the
freendes of Agatha to maruaile not a little, and to miſdoubt
that the ſodaine death of their kinſewoman, had not happened
without ſome miſterie. Neuertheleſſe, hauing no token nor euidence
or proofe, thei held their peace. But Gonſales hauyng
his deſired purpoſe and liuyng with his newe wife, it befell
vnto hym (through Gods iuſt Iudgement with this his ioly
Dame) as it chaunced to Agatha with hym before. For Aſelgia
that was neuer wont to feede with ſo ſpare a diet, as ſhe
that had neuer bin contented before without greate chaunge,
nor had not bin vſed to that kinde of ſtraigtneſſe (which Gonſales
growing ielous of her, began to keepe her in) but had alwaies
liued at libertie, and with ſuche licenciouſneſſe, as women
of her profeſſion are wont to doe, became in ſhorte ſpace
to ſhewe her ſelf ſo preciſe vnto hym, and to hate and abhorre
hym in ſuche extreme ſorte, that ſhe could not abide to ſee, or
heare hym ſpoken of. By occaſion of whiche her demeanour
towardes him: Gonſales to his greefe began at laſt, to knowe
and to diſcerne what difference there is betweene the honeſt

and carefull loue of an honeſt wife, and the diſſemblyng of an
arrant Strumpet. Wherefore one daie among the reſt, complainyng
of the little loue whiche he perceiued ſhe bare hym,
and ſhe aunſweryng hym thawartly. Gonſales fallyng into
heate of Choler, ſaied angerly vnto her: haue I thou naughty
packe poyſoned Agatha for thy ſake, that was the kindeſt and
the louingeſt wife that euer man had, and is this the rewarde
I haue and the requitall thou yeeldeſt me, to ſhowe thy ſelf euery
daie more deſpightefull and crabbed then other? Aſelgia
hauyng harde hym and noted well his wordes, tooke holde of
them, and ſtraight waie thought that ſhe had founde the waie
to rid her ſelf of Gonſales: wherefore ſhe reueiled his ſpeeches
vnto a Ribalde of hers, ſuch a one as ſupplied her want of that
which Gonſales alone nor ten ſuche as he were able to ſatiſfie
her withall, and induced hym to appeache hym for that facte,
aſſuryng her ſelf that the Lawe would puniſhe hym with no
lnſſe then death, and thereby ſhe to remaine at libertie to doe
what ſhe liſt againe, as ſhe had doen before. This companion
accuſed Gonſales vpon his owne wordes vnto the freendes of
Agatha, who hauyng had half a ſuſpition thereof before, went
and accuſed hym likewiſe before ye Iudge, or hed Magiſtrate
of the Citie. Whervpon Gonſales and his woman were both
apprehended and put to their examinations, to ſearche out the
truth: which Gonſales being halfe conuicted by the confeſſion
of the gentle peate his new wife, but chiefly grieued with the
worme of his owne conſcience, and to auoyde the torment of
thoſe terrors whiche he knewe were prepared for him, confeſſed
flatly, affirmyng that he had poyſoned her with a poyſon
whiche he had kept of long tyme before in his houſe, perfourmyng
yet therein the promiſe whiche he had made vnto the
Sholler. And vpon his owne confeſſion, ſentence was giuen
againſt hym that he ſhould looſe his hed.
               
                  Alonſo, when he vnderſtoode that Gonſaler was condemned
to dye, was very glad thereof, ſuppoſyng that he beeyng
once dead, Agatha (who all this while for any thyng that the
olde woman could ſaie or alledge vnto her in the behalfe of Alonſo,
would neuer yeeld or conſent to any one point wherein

her honour might haue beene touched or ſpotted) ſhould remaine
at his diſcretion, and that ſhe would no longer refuſe to
graunt hym her good will when ſhe ſhould ſee her ſelf deliuered
of Gonſales. But the daie beyng come wherein he was to
be put to execution, ſhe hauyng had inteligence of all that had
paſſed, and knowyng that he was appointed to dye that daie,
determined with her ſelf that ſhe would in that extremitie deliuer
her diſloyall houſebande, and giue hym to vnderſtande
how little ſhe had deſerued to bee ſo entreated by hym as ſhe
had been. Wherefore hauyng gotten out of Alonſo his houſe,
ſhe hied her vnto the Citie as faſt as ſhe could, and beeyng before
the Iuſtice or Magiſtrate ſhe ſaied vnto hym. Sir, Gonſales
whom you haue condemned and commaunded to be put
to death this daie, is wrongfully condemned: for it is not true
that he hath poyſoned his wife, but ſhe is yet aliue, and I am
ſhe. Therefore I beſeeche you giue order that execution maie
be ſtaied, ſince that your ſentence is grounded vpon a falſe enformation
and confeſſion is vniuſt, and you maie plainely diſcerne
by me beyng here.
               When the Gouernour heard Agatha ſpeake in this ſorte,
whom he had thought to haue beene deade and buried, he was
all amazed and halfe afraied to looke vpon her, doubtyng that
ſhe was rather her ſpirite or Ghoſte, or ſome other in her likeneſſe
then a liuely woman in deede: for ſhe was apparelled in
a very plaine and black attyre, and was very wanne and pale
by reaſon of the affliction which ſhe had indured. Firſt, for her
owne il fortune, and then for the miſchaunce of her houſband.
               In this meane while, the Sargantes and Officers had
brought Gonſales before the Iuſtice or Magiſtrate, to the
ende that he (accordyng to the cuſtome of the Citie) ſhould
giue them commaundement to leade hym to the place of execution,
and there to fulfill his ſentence vpon him. But as ſone
as Agatha perceiued hym, ſhe ranne vnto hym, and takyng
hym about the necke and kiſſing him ſhe ſaied. Alas my deere
houſebande, wherevnto doe I ſee you brought through your
own folly and diſordinate appetite which blinded your iudgement.
Beholde here your Agatha aliue and not deade: who

euen in that extremitie is come to ſhewe her ſelf, that louyng
and faithfull wife vnto you, that ſhe was euer.
               The Iuſtice or Gouernour ſeyng this ſtraunge accident,
cauſed execution to be ſtaied, and ſignified the whole caſe vnto
the Lorde of the Countrey, who at that tyme chaunced to bee
at Sciuill: who wonderyng no leſſe then the other at the matter,
cauſed bothe Gonſales and his wife to bee brought before
him, and demaunded of them how it had chaunced that ſhe hauyng
bin buried for dead was now founde aliue. Gonſales,
could ſaie nothyng but that for the loue he bare vnto Aſelgia
he had poyſoned his wife, and that he knewe not how ſhe was
reuiued againe. But Agatha, declared how the Scholer with
his ſkill had deliuered her from death, and reſtored her life vnto
her, but how or by what meanes ſhe could not tell.
               The Lorde hauyng ſent for Alonſo, and demaunded hym
of the truth, was certified by hym, how that in ſteede of poiſon
he had giuen to Gonſales a Pouder to make her ſleape: Affirmyng
likewiſe that notwithſtandyng the long and earneſt
purſuite, whiche he had made to obtaine her loue, and the crueltie
and iniurie whiche ſhe ſawe her houſebande had vſed towarde
her, to put her in that daunger and perill of her life, out
of whiche he had deliuered her, yet could he neuer by any perſwaſion or entreatie winne her to fulfill his deſire, or bryng
her to make breache of her faithe and honeſtie. By whiche reporte
the Lorde knewe very well, that in an honeſt woman
the regarde and reſpect of her honour and chaſtitie, doth farre
exceede any other paſſion, for any miſerie be it neuer ſo great.
And commendyng highly the loue, and conſtancie of the woman
towarde her houſebande, and praiſyng the pollicie of Alonſo,
he tourned hymſelf vnto Gonſales, and ſaied vnto hym:
Full euill haſt thou deſerued to haue ſo good, and ſo verteous
a Gentlewoman to thy wife, and in reaſon ſhe ought now rather
to be Alonſo his wife then thine: Neither wert thou worthie
of leſſe then that puniſhment, whiche the Lawe hath condempned
thee vnto, though ſhe be yet aliue, ſince thou, aſmuch
as in thee laie, haſt doen, to bereue her of her life. But I am
content that her vertue and goodneſſe, ſhall ſo much be auaileable

vnto thee, that thou ſhalt haue thy life ſpared vnto thee
for this tyme: not for thy owne ſake, becauſe thou deſerueſe it
not, but for hers, and not to giue her that ſorrowe and greefe,
whiche I knowe ſhe would feele, if thou ſhouldeſt dye in that
ſorte. But I ſware vnto thee, that if euer I maie vnderſtande
that thou doeſt vſe her hencefoorth, otherwiſe then louingly
and kindly, I wil make thee to thy greeuous paine proue how
ſeuerely I can puniſhe ſuche beaſtly and heinous factes, to the
example of all others.
               
                  Gonſales imputyng his former offence, to want of witte
and Iudgement, made promiſe vnto the Lorde, that he would
alwaies doe as he had commaunded hym. And accordyngly
hauyng forſaken cleane that baggage Strumpet, that he had
wedded: He liued all the reſt of his daies in good loue and
peace with Agatha his wife, whoſe chaſte and conſtant mind,
cauſed Alonſo wher before he loued her for her excertor beautie,
euer after to reuerence her, and in maner to worſhipp
her as a diuine creature, for the excellēcie of her vertue.
Reſoluyng with hymſelf that a more conſtant
faith and honeſt diſpoſition could not
bee founde in any mortall woman.

                  The Argument of the vij. Historie.
                  ¶Armanthus ſonne to Rodericke Kyng of Toloſia, beyng
borne a Leper, was ſent by his Father to the Ile
of Candy for remedie, and by a Tempeſt at the Sea,
the Shipp was driuen into Turkie, where ſhe was caſt
awaie, and no man ſaued but the childe, whiche was
taken vp by a poore Fiſherman, and fostered as his
owne ſonne, and afterwards ſeruing the Turke in his
warres, ſhewed himſelf ſo politique, that the Turke by
his onely aduiſe, incroched muche vpon the Christians,
and in fine, by his meane the Citie of Toloſia was
taken, his father put in priſon, and how in the ende he
was knowne to be the ſonne of Rodericke.
               
               
                  I Shall not neede by any long circumſtaunce
to deſcribe, how many
troubles, tumultes, broyles,
Brabbles, Murthers, Treaſons,
how kingdomes haue béen diſturbed?
How many Countries laied
waſte? How many Cities haue
been ſacked? How many Tounes
haue beene raſed, and how many
miſcheefes haue euer happened, ſithence the firſt creation of
the worlde, vntill this preſent daie, by that monſterous vice
Ambition. Conſidering that euery Hiſtorie maketh mention,
euery Chronicle beareth recorde, and euery age, tyme, and
ſeaſon, haue ſeen with their eyes, and this our tale that followeth
ſhall ſome thyng make more euident.
               There was ſometyme remainyng in the famous Citie of
Toloſia a worthie Kyng, whoſe name was Rodericke: who

was likewiſe eſpouſed to a moſte vertuous Queene called
Iſabell, and truely a happie Courte it might be called, whiche
thei held, aſ well for the loue that was betweene the King and
Queene: as for the vertue and clemencie, wherewith bothe
the one and the other were accompanied.
               There was remainyng in the Court, the Duke of Ca
                        •
                     ia,
who was the onely brother of Rodericke Kyng of Toloſia:
This Duke beyng a greate deale more vicious then his 
                     ••
                  ether
was verteous, practiſed no other thing, but how he might
come by the Kingdome of Toloſia: Knowing that there were
no more betweene hym and it but the Kyng, who loued hym
more dearely by a greate deale then he deſerued. But it fell
out the Queene Iſabell was knowne to bee with childe, the
Duke very lothe that any other heires ſhould ſteppe in betwene
hym and home, deuiſed to poyſon the Queene, & ſo had
thought to haue doen, by as many as the Kyng ſhould haue
taken to wife (if at any tyme thei proued to be with childe) but
by the prouidence of God, this poiſon tooke no great effect in
the Queene, ſauyng that when ſhe was deliuered of a ſonne,
the child was found to be in a notable Leproſie, and the Kyng
hauing intelligence of an excellent Phiſition, (but eſpecially
for the curyng of that deſeaſe) was remainyng in the Ile of
Candy, prepared a Shipp preſently to ſende the child, which
by the extreamitie of a contrary winde, was driuen into Turkie,
and the Shippe caſt awaie vppon the maine, and all the
men drouned exceptyng the childe, whiche beeyng in a Cradle
was carried to the Shore as it laie. Where a Fiſherman
founde it, with ſuche ſumptuous furnitures aboute it, with
a very riche Iewell hangyng about the necke. He tooke it vp
in his armes, and carriyng it home, with Bathes and homely
Oyntmentes of his owne deuiſing, within a very little ſpace,
the childe was reſtored to perfecte health, whom he called Aramanthus,
and brought hym vp as his owne Soonne, the
childe knowyng no other in deede, but that the Fiſherman
had been his father, and as Aramanthus grewe in yeares, ſo
he proued of a very comely perſonage, but of a moſt excellent
and perfecte witte, although he had no other trainyng vp, but

vſed to goe to the Sea with his father a fiſhyng.
               Now it fell out that the Turke was leauiyng a mightie
Armie, to ſet vpon the Chriſtians, the cauſe was t
                     •
                  is, he had
twoo children, a ſonne and a daughter, the daughter her name
was Florella, whoſe beautie was very excellent, and mindyng
to match his daughter with ſome noble Prince, he pretended
that ſuche Countries, Cities, Townes, Caſtelles, Fortes,
or what ſo euer he could by conqueſt get from the Chriſtians,
to giue them all for his daughters dowrie.
               
                  Aramanthus hearyng of this preparation to the Warres,
would needes become a Souldiour, where at his father the
Fiſherman was greatly diſpleaſed, and beganne to preache
vnto his ſonne of the incommodities of warre, and with how
many miſeries Souldiers are beſieged. Aramanthus whoſe
baſeneſſe of his bringyng vp, could not conceale the nobilitie
of his birth, would in no wiſe be perſwaded but goe he would,
and beyng preſſed for an ordinarie Souldiour, when he came
to the place of ſeruice ſhewed hymſelf ſo valiaunt, and in very
ſhorte ſpace became to be ſo expert, that that Captaine vnder
whoſe Enſigne he ſerued, bare awaie the credite from all the
reſt: and in the ende was hymſelf preferred to charge, whiche
he gouerned with ſo great diſcretion, and ſtill conducted with
ſuche celeritie and ſleight, that who but Aramanthus and his
companie had the onely name throughout the Turkes cāpe,
and where there was any attempt to bee giuen, where valiancie
ſhould bee ſhowne, Aramanthus he muſt giue the charge,
and where any policie muſt be put in practiſe, Aramanthus he
muſt laie the platte: that to be ſhorte, he grewe into ſuche credite
with the greate Turke hymſelf, that Aramanthus onely
gaue hym counſaill in all his affaires, and there with all had
ſo good ſucceſſe, that his practiſes ſtill preuailed, and came to
happie end, that the Turke by his aduiſe, had doen wonderfull
ſpoyles vpon the Chriſtians, and had taken from them many
Cities, Tounes, and Prouinces.
               And thus leauyng them in the warres for a ſeaſon, I will
conuaie my tale againe to Iſabell Queene and wife to Rodericke,
who was now the ſecond time knowne to be with child,

whereat the Duke of Caria beeyng wonderfullie wrothe, pretendyng
to finde a quicke diſpatche for all together, he ſecretlie
accuſed the Queene of Adulterie, to the King his brother,
and with ſuche allegations, and falſe witneſſes as he had prouided,
ſo informed the King that his tale was credited: and the
rather for that the king knowing his Queene to be with child
did thinke himſelf too farre ſpent in yeres, to do ſuche a deede.
And yet the King was repleniſhed with ſo greate pitee, that
he could not indure to heare of her death: He therefore by a
meſſenger, commaunded her preſentlie to depart the Court:
and in paine of her life, neuer after to come in his preſence.
Theſe newes did wonderfullie amaze the Queene, who with
many piteous interceſſions, deſired to knowe her accuſers,
and that ſhe might but ſpeake for her ſelf before his Maieſtie,
and then as he ſhould finde her, to vſe her according to her deſertes.
But all in vaine, for the Duke had ſo throughlie incenſed
the King, that he would neither abide to ſee, nor heare her.
The duke vnderſtanding how matters had paſſed, came to the
Queene, and ſemed muche to lament her caſe, perſwading her
to hold her ſelf contented for a little ſeaſon, not doubtyng but
in tyme, that he hymſelf would ſo perſwade with his brother,
that ſhe ſhould bee heard to ſpeake in her owne defence, in the
meane ſeaſon, if it pleaſed her to vſe his houſe in the Countrie
he would prouide for her all maner of neceſſaries, what ſoeuer
ſhe ſhould wante, and for her better comforte, if ſhe had any
aſſured freend, whoſe companie ſhe deſired, that ſhe might
ſecretelie ſende for them, to holde her fellowſhip, and to paſſe
the tyme: and that he hymſelf would many tymes viſite her,
and daiely informe her, how matters did paſſe in her behalfe,
with the King his brother.
               The poore Queene, thinkyng all had to proceede of good
will whiche this Traitor had proffered, gaue him more then a
thouſand thankes, repoſing her ſelf, and the innocencie of her
cauſe, onely in this Iudas, who practized nothyng els but her
death, and the death of that ſhe went withall.
               The next daie he prouided a couple of Ruffians, ſuche as
he knewe were for his purpoſe, whiche ſhould haue ſecretelie

conueighed her to the Dukes houſes (as ſhe had thought) but
as the Duke had willed them, as thei rode ouer a Foreſt, whē
thei came to the ſide of a woode, thei tooke her from her horſe,
ſpoyled her of ſuche thynges as were aboute her, and mynded
to haue killed her, and throwne her in ſome Buſhe: But it fell
out that there were certaine baniſhed menne in the Woode,
whiche liued in that deſarte in maner of Outlawes, and hearyng
the piteous complainte of the Queene, thei came to her
reſcue, but the villaines that would haue ſlain her, perceiuing
them, fledde, and lefte the Queene, where theſe Outlawes
came vnto her: vnto whom from poinct to poinct ſhe declared
euery thing, how it was happened vnto her, the Outlawes hauing
greate compaſſion, whē thei knewe her to be the Quene
for that thei had euer heard her to bee Noblie reported on,
brought her with theim to their Caue, where thei miniſtered
ſuche releef to her diſtreſſe, as menne might doe that were in
their eſtates. The Queene thinkyng that God had preſerued
her life, to ſome better purpoſe, contented her ſelf for a ſeaſon,
to remaine emongeſt theim: Where ſhe learned to plaie the
Cooke, and to dreſſe their meate, ſuche as thei brought in, or
could prouide for in the Foreſt. And thus leauyng the Quene
with theſe Outlawes, I will retourne againe to ſpeake of Aramanthus,
who was now deuiſyng to frame a plotte, how he
might betraie the Citee of Toloſia, whereof his Father was
Kyng, as you haue heard.
               For the Turke hauyng intelligence, of the pleaſauntneſſe
of this Citee, and of the wonderfull wealthe and riches, wherwith
it did abounde, and therewithall had learned, that it was
of ſuche force and inuinſible ſtrengthe, that there was no maner
of hope, how it might be ſubdued, whereat the Turke was
verie ſorowfull and ſadde.
               But my yong Fiſherman Aramanthus, whoſe cunnyng
neuer failed, where courage could net help, cauſed the Turke
with his whole armie by ſea, to come before this Citee, which
is ſituate faſt vpon the ſea ſide, and there to come to an anker,
where Aramanthus hymſelf; as a meſſenger appoincted from
the Turke, came to the kyng of Toloſia, to whom he told this

tale: That the Turke his Maiſter, hauyng been in diues partes
of Chriſtendome, where he had made warres a long ſpace,
and vpon diuers conſiderations, mindyng to departe with his
Armie, into his owne Countrey for a ſeaſon, and beyng vpon
the Seas: one night as he was liyng vpon his bedde, behold,
a viſion appeared vnto hym in a Dreame, whiche ſhewed hym
how greeuouſlie he had offended the God of the Chriſtians, in
the perſecutyng, ſpoilyng, and the murtheryng of them, as he
had doen in this iourney, and for that he ſhould know, that the
Chriſtian God, was the moſte high and Almightie God in
deede, whom with his tyrannie he had ſo diſpleaſed, he ſhould
bee creepled of al
                     •
                   his limmes from that tyme forthe, till his
diyng daie, whiche ſhould verie ſhortly followe, with this he awaked,
and giuyng a piteous grone, ſuche as was about hym
commyng vnto hym, found hym in a wonderfull maze, and ſo
benummed in all his partes, that he was not able to ſtir hande
nor foote: The nexte daie callyng his Counſailers and Captaines
about hym, not able of hymſelf to come forthe emongſt
theim, but as he was brought out of his Cabbin on mennes
backes, he declared vnto them the whole circumſtaunce of the
premiſſes, and beyng ſtriken with a wonderfull remorſe in cō
                  ſcience,
he determined to ſaile backe againe, not mindyng to
depart frō out thoſe partes of Chriſtendome, till he had made
ſatiſfaction of all ſuche ſpoiles and outrages, as he had committed
againſt the Chriſtians, and hymſelf with his whole armie
to become Chriſtened, and there to bee inſtructed in the
true and perfect faith, and as he continued this determinatiō,
behold, a contrary winde hath driuen vs on theſe parts, where
hearyng of the Fame of this Noble Citee of Toloſia, he hath
ſent me vnto your grace, deſiryng nothing but your ſaffe conducte
for hymſelf, and certaine of his cheef Lordes and Counſailors
that be about hym, that in this noble Citee thei might
be Baptized, and receiue the Chriſtian faithe, promiſing hereafter,
not onely to ioyne in league, and perfect amitie with the
Chriſtians, but alſo to lincke with them in Religion, hymſelf,
his Countries, Kyngdomes, and Prouinces.
               This tale was not ſo ſmoothly told, but there was greate

doubte and ſuſpition had in the matter, in the ende thinkyng
thei could receiue no preiudice, by receiuing of ſo ſmal a nomber,
gaue ſafe condite for the Turke hymſelf, and for fiue hundred
of his companie, ſuche as it pleaſed himſelf to appoincte.
               The next daie, the Turke was brought into the Citee on
mennes ſhulders, with his appointed companie, where he was
worthely receiued by the king himſelf, with the reſt of his lordes,
and brought into a Pallace of purpoſe, very richely furniſhed,
where beyng laied doune vpon a bedde, as though he had
been able neither to ſtande nor ſit, and giuyng the King, with
the reſt of his companie, great thankes for his entertainment
he deſired him with the Duke his brother (according to the cuſtome)
to be his Godfathers when he ſhould be Chriſtened, to
whiche requeſt thei bothe willyngly agreed: the next daie the
Turke hymſelf was the firſt that receiued Chriſtendome, and
then all the reſt of his noble men that wer with him, the which
beyng finiſhed, many godlie exhortations were preached vnto
theim by learned menue. The Turke ſeemed in verie gratefull
maner to take this curteſie, wherewith the King had vſed
him: and thus taking his leaue himſelf with all his companie,
departed againe aborde the ſhippes: the Turke himſelf beyng
caried vpon mennes backes, making ſhowe as though he had
been ſo feeble and weake, that he had not been able to haue
moued, or ſtirred any one ioynte without helpe, fainyng that
he would haue departed with his companie into Turkie.
               The King of Toloſia with all his people and Citezens, ſeyng
with what deuotion the Turke with the reſte of his companie,
had receiued Chriſtendome, began to thinke aſſuredly,
that onely by the Diuine prouidence of God, the Turke was
ſo conuerted, and doubted nothyng of the tale, whiche Aramanthus
before had told them, whiche tourned in the ende to
their vtter ſubuerſion. For the nexte daie Aramanthus commyng
againe to the Kyng, brought woorde of the death of the
Turke, and with a piteous diſcourſe vttered, with a nomber
of fained ſighes, ſaied: that about twelue a clocke of the night
paſt, the Turke deceaſed, and deſired at the houre of his death
that as in this worthie Citee, he had receiued the true and Catholike

faithe, ſo likewiſe that he might bee entoumbed, and
receiue Chriſtian buriall in the Cathedrall Churche, to the
whiche he had giuen by his will fourtie thouſande Frankes,
more to the common Treaſure of the Citee, an hundred thouſande
Frankes, to the King himſelf as a preſident of his good
will, a riche Iewell, whiche hymſelf did weare of greate eſtimation,
to the Duke his brother, his owne Armour and furniture.
Item, to the releef of the poore within the Citee, tenne
thouſande Frankes. Many other thinges (ꝙ Aramanthus) he
hath bequeathed, that I haue not ſpoken of, the whiche God
willyng, ſhalbe performed to the vttermoſte.
               The king ſemed greatly to lament the death of the Turke
and began to coniecture aſſuredly, that it was the will of God
but to preſerue his life, till he had receiued Chriſtendome, but
the time of his buriall, was deferred for certain daies, til thinges
might be prouided, and more readie for the pompe, and ſolemniſing
of his Funerall, and wonderfull coſt was beſtowed
by Aramanthus, who had the onely ordering of the matter, hoping
in the ende to receiue the whole commoditie: and alſo to
be rewarded with a large and bountifull intreſt. The daie of
buriall beyng at hande, Aramanthus deſired the king, that for
ſo muche as the Turke had finiſhed his daies in the middeſt of
his armie emongſt his Souldiers, that he might likewiſe bee
buried like a noble captain, and according to the maner of the
feeld: he might be brought to his graue with certaine bandes,
trailing their weapons, as the cuſtome of ſouldiers is to burie
their dedde. This requeſt ſeemed to bee verie conuenient, and
therefore was the readilier graunted: but what ſhould I ſtand
with long circumſtance, to diſcipher all the Ceremonies that
wer vſed in this treaſon. The daie was come, that this practiſe
muſt be put in vre, and an emptie coffin ſolempnly brought to
the citee, vnder ſhewe of greate ſorrowe, when thei were al filled
with greate ioye and gladneſſe, to ſe what happie ſucceſſe
was like to followe, of that thei had premeditated, and accordyng
as Aramanthus had giuen order, 5000. of their choſe
men were appoincted to marche, the one halfe before, and the
other half after the Coffin, trailyng their Enſignes and weapons,

and in this maner thei entred the Citee, where the king
with his nobles and principalles of the Citee, were readie in
mournyng weedes to accompanie the Corſe. When Aramā
                     nthus
ſawe his tyme, the Alarum was giuen, and he hymſelf
was the firſt that laied handes of the king his Father, the reſt
of his nobles were ſo encloſed, that there could not one of thē
eſcape: Defence there was none to bee made, for the one ſide
were in Armes, killyng and murtheryng of as many as thei
could ſee ſtirryng in the ſtreates: The other ſide vnprouided,
glad to hide theim ſelues, for the ſauegard of their liues: The
reſte of the fleete were likewiſe in a readineſſe, and commyng
a lande, entred the Citee, where there was no man to repulſe
them. And thus the famous Citee of Toloſia was taken by the
Turkes, euen in a moment, without any maner of reſiſtance:
the churches and priſons were filled full of Chriſtians, where
thei were whipped, racked, and tormented to the death, vnleſſe
thei would forſake their Faithe. The kyng hymſelf with his
brother, and all the Lordes, were committed to priſon, there to
bee fedde with breade and water (and yet to be ſcantled with
ſuche ſhort allowaunce, as it was not able to ſuffice Nature)
and ſo to be dieted, vnleſſe thei would forſake their Faithe.
               Now the Turke, who onely by the meanes of Aramanthus,
had cōquered from the Chriſtians ſo many citees and tounes,
for the loue he bare vnto hym, and in reſpect of his ſeruice, determined
to make Aramanthus his ſonne in lawe, and to giue
hym his daughter Florella for his wife: and for her dowrie, all
ſuche partes as he had taken from the Chriſtians by conqueſt
and vnderſtandyng that the father of Aramanthus was but a
poore Fiſherman, he pretended likewiſe to make hym a duke,
and to giue hym liuyng to maintaine his eſtate. The Turke
therfore with allpoſſible ſpeede, haſted meſſengers with ſhippyng,
to bryng his daughter, with the old Fiſherman, the ſuppoſed
Father of Aramanthus, to this Citie of Toloſia, where
he minded to performe that he had determined.
               Now it fell out, that the miſerable Queene Iſabell (whom
you haue heard was lefte with child, remainyng with certaine
Outlawes) was deliuered of a Daughter, whiche ſhe her ſelf

nurſed in the Caue, where ſhe had remained, and hearyng that
the Turke had taken the Citee of Toloſia, would needes goe
ſee what was become of the kyng her houſebande: her daughter
whiche was not yet fullie a yere olde, ſhe committed to the
Outlawes, to bee foſtered with ſuche homelie Iunkettes, as
their could prouide, wo ſeeyng her determination, promiſed to
drie Nurſe the child, ſo well as thei could, till ſhe ſhould make
retourne. Thus preparyng her ſelf in a verie ſimple attire,
with a bondle of Broomes on her hedde, ſhe came to the Citee
of Toloſia, where romyng vp and doune the ſtreates to ſell her
Broomes, ſhe learned all that had happened to the Kyng, and
how he was ready to periſhe, for want of foode and ſuſtenance
wherefore myndyng to giue ſuche ſuccours, as her habilitie
would ſerue: She deuiſed in the maner of a poore ſeruaunt, to
gette into the ſeruice of the Turke, who was the Iailer, and
had the cuſtodie of the Kyng, where euery Night, as oportunitie
would ſerue, ſhe conueighed to hym through a grate, ſuche
fragmentes as ſhe ſpared out of her owne bealie, whiche were
verie ſhorte, and there withall muche more homelie, but
ſomthyng the better to amende his cheare. She would leane
her ſelf cloaſe to the grate, and thruſtyng in her Teate betweene
the Irons, the king learned againe to ſucke, and thus
ſhe dieted him a long ſeaſon. Neither wiſte the kyng what ſhe
was, that beſtowed on hym ſo greate grace and goodneſſe:
yet he bleſſed her more then a thouſande tymes a daie. And although
there were many of his companie, that died for wante
of ſuſtenaunce, yet he again with theſe banquettes recouered
himſelf, and beganne to waxe ſtrong. Whereat the Turke beganne
to ſuſpecte ſome parcialitie in the Iailer, and cauſed a
priuie watche to bee kept: but Iſabell ſuſpectyng nothyng, according
to her accuſtomed maner, at night when it was darke
came to her Nurſeri
                     •
                  , where her order that ſhe ſo long vſed,
was eſpied, and beeyng apprehended by the watche, the nexte
daie ſhe was preſented to the Turke, and in what maner thei
had founde her, whereat the Turke wonderfullie agreeued:
Sware by Mahounde hym ſelf, that ſhe ſhould preſently bee
tortured, with the greateſt tormentes that might be deuiſed.

And in the middeſt of his furie, woorde was brought hym that
his Daughter Florella, with the Fiſherman that was Father
to Aramanthus were arriued, and readie to preſent them ſelues
before hym, whereat the Turke wonderfullie reioyſed,
and ca
                     •
                  lyng Aramanthus, cauſed them to bee brought in, Florella
gaue that reuerence to the Turke, whiche bothe appertained
to the duetie of a Childe, and alſo as belonged to his eſtate.
Aramanthus likewiſe, although he were the greateſte
Counſailour, appertinent to the Turke, yet vſed that dutifull
reuerence to the Fiſherman his Father, as is to bee required
in a Childe. The Turke imbracyng his Daughter Florella,
tolde her the cauſe that he had ſent for her, was to eſpouſe her
to Aramanthus, who although the Deſtinies had denaied to
make Noble by place of birthe, yet through his Vertues, Valiaunce,
and worthie exploites, he had gained the title of true
Nobilitie, in deſpite of Fortunes teeth. Florella hauing heard
of the Fame and worthineſſe of Aramanthus, was the beſte
pleaſed woman in the worlde.
               And the Turke turnyng hym towardes the Fiſherman,
ſaied: And a thouſande times happie art thou old Father, that
haſt liued to ſee thy ſelf ſo highly exalted in thy ofſpryng: The
poore Fiſherman kneelyng doune, ſaied: Moſte mightie, and
magnificente Prince, not mindyng longer to conceale the
thyng, whiche might redounde ſo greatly to the contentation
of ſuche worthie perſonages, ſeeyng then that Aramanthus,
who onely through his own valiancie, hath aſpired to ſo great
dignitie and honour. How greatly were I then to be blamed,
and how worthely might I bee condemned? If I ſhould take
vpon me to be the ſire of hym, who by all likelihood, is deſcended
of Roiall and Princely race, for better teſtimonie, behold
this riche Mantell, and theſe other coſtly furnitures, wherein
I founde Aramanthus wrapped, and by ſeemyng ſaued by his
Cradell, whiche brought hym a Shoore, from ſome Shippe
that was wracked, where I founde hym by the Sea ſide (as
I ſaie) wrapped in theſe ſumptuous Furnitures, with this
riche and precious Iewell about his necke, beyng but an Infaunte▪
by coniecture not aboue the age of a quarter of a yere,

where takyng hym vp in my armes, I brought hym home to
my houſe, called hym by the name of Aramanthus, and thus
foſtered hym vp as my owne child, vntil the daie that he came
to ſerue your Maieſtie in the Warres.
               The Queene Iſabell whiche ſtoode by, and heard this diſcourſe,
and ſeing the furnitures and the Iewelles, wherewith
ſhe had decked her childe, aſſuryng her ſelf that Aramanthus
was her ſonne, could no longer ſtaie her ſpeeche, but ſaid: And
doe I then beholde my ſonne with my vnhappie eyes, is he liuyng
here in preſence, whom I deemed to be dead? Oh moſte
gracious Gods I yeelde you humble thankes, and would to
God my ſonne thy commyng had been but halfe ſo happie, as
thy preſence is ioyfull to me thy wretched mother. What newes
be theſe (ꝙ the Turke) whiche I heard, I thinke the woman
be out of her wits: but what art thou that wouldeſt chalenge
Aramanthus for thy ſonne, whoſe parentes now I well
perceiue, are no beggers like thy ſelf. Yes ſurely (quoth the
Queene) and muche more miſerable, then thoſe that goe from
doore to doore: and although his father ſometyme ſwaied the
ſword of gouernement, and ſatt in place and ſeate of Princely
Throne. Diſpatche then at once (ꝙ the Turke) and tell me
who is his father, and what is the miſerie wherwith he is perplexed:
wherein if thou canſt perſwade me with a truth, aſſure
thee that onely for Aramanthus ſake, I am the man that will
miniſter releaſe.
               Behold then (ꝙ the Queene) Kyng Rodericke is his Father,
whom thy ſelf keepeſt here in priſon, in this miſerable
maner, and I whom thou ſeeſt here am his mother, the wife
of the Kyng, and ſometyme the Queene of this wretched Citie
of Toloſia, who beeyng deliuered of a ſonne, whiche by the
pleaſure of GOD was viſited in my wombe, and borne in an
extreame Leproſie: for helpe whereof he was ſent by his Father
by Shippyng to the Ile of Candy, and till this preſent
daie there was neuer tidynges heard, either of the Shippe, or
of any one man that was in her. And now behold I ſee with
myne eyes the furnitures wherein I wrapped my childe, and
the Iewell which I put about his neck, with my owne handes

at his departure: the Fiſherman verifying this tale to be true,
ſaied in deede that he founde hym in an extreame Maladie,
which he cured himſelf with medicines of his own prouiding.
               
                  Aramanthus hauyng heard how matters were ſorted out,
beganne to teare hymſelf, ſaiyng: Ah moſt wicked and vnnaturall
wretche, what Furies haue ſaued thee, that thou wart
not drouned with the reſt, but that thou muſt bee preſerued as
an Inſtrument to worke thy Parentes wracke: Come come
you Helliſhe Hagges, and ſhewe your force on hym that hath
worthely deſerued it. But what hath Tantalus offended, that
he ſhould continually bee ſterued? Or how hath Siſiphus that
rowles the reſtleſſe Stone? Or what treſpaſſe hath been committed
by Prometheus, Ixyon, Titias, or Danaus ſillie daughters,
drawyng water at the Well: that maie bee compared to
that whiche I haue doen, is it poſſible thē that I ſhould eſcape
vnpuniſhed? Or that the ſacred Gods will bee vnreuenged of
my fact, no no, I haue deſerued to be plagued, and haue merited
more worthely to be tormented then any of theſe afore rehearſed.
Florella ouer hearyng theſe deſperate ſpeeches, fell
doune in a ſowne for greefe to ſee her Aramanthus ſo diſquieted.
The Turke after his daughter was come againe to her
ſelf, forrowed to ſee the heauineſſe of Aramanthus, cauſed the
Kyng his father, with the Duke of Caria preſently to be ſent
for out of priſon: And takyng Iſabell on the one of his hands,
and Aramanthus on the other, he ſaied to the Kyng: Receiue
here noble Prince, a moſte louyng and faithfull wife, and a
moſte valiaunt and worthie ſonne: And my ſelf from an enemie,
for euer after this, to become thy moſt aſſured and truſtie
freende.
               The Kyng was wonderfully amazed to heare theſe ſpeeches,
did thinke hymſelf to be in ſome dreame: till in the ende
he heard the whole diſcourſe how euery thyng had happened,
and beyng rauiſhed with gladneſſe, he ſaied.
               O happie euill, whiche bryngeth in the ende ſo greate a
good, and welcome bee that ſorrowe, whereby is ſprong a
ioye, muche more ſurmountyng, then euer was any heauineſſe:
and with many like ſpeeches, he ſtill embraced his ſonne

ſeen their owne errour, and there withall haue confeſſed their
abuſe, yet their haue not bin able to refraine them ſelues, from
proſecuting their follie to the ende, and all be it, reaſon proffereth
vs ſondrie ſufficient cauſes, why we ought to refraine the
appetite of our own deſires, yet fancie then is he that ſtriketh
ſuche a ſtroke, that reaſons rules can naught at all preuaile,
and like as thoſe whom loue hath once intangled, the more
thei ſtriue the farther thei bee tied, ſo it is vnpoſſible that loue
ſhould be conſtrained, where affection breedes not likyng, nor
fancy is not fed, but where theſe two hath once ioyned in election,
all other affects be ſo dimme and blinded, that euery vice
ſeemeth to vs a vertue, whereof ſpringeth this Prouerbe. In
loue there is no lacke, ſo that in deede to ſaie the truth, if there
be any pietie to be imputed to this ragyng loue, it is in that it
is not parciall, nor hath it any reſpect of perſons, but bee thei
frendes, be thei foes, be thei riche, be thei poore, be thei young,
be thei olde, bee thei wiſe, bee thei fooliſhe, loue is ſtill indifferent,
and reſpecteth all a like: but if any man will thinke that
in reſpect of beautie, wee eſteeme not all the reſt: I am able
to ſaie it is not true, conſideryng how many haue forſaken the

ſhall be at your diſpoſition as it ſhal pleaſe you to appoint
it, and will conclude with this humble petition, deſiryng you
not to beſtowe me of any that is not agreeable to my fancie
and good likyng.
               Well (quoth her father) then ſee you frame your liking to
like well of my likyng. I haue promiſed you to Phylotus in
mariage, and Phylotus is he that ſhall be your houſband, and

looke you goe not aboute to contende againſt that I haue determined,
if you doe, neuer accompt me for father nor freende,
and thus he departed.
               
                  Emelia hearyng this cruell concluſion of her father, was
wonderfully abaſhed, and beeyng by her ſelf in her Chamber,
ſhe beganne to conſider of her fathers wordes, and for feare to
incurre any farther diſpleaſure, ſhe deuſed how ſhe might
frame her ſelf to the likyng of her louer, and with a yong womans
minde, ſhe firſt beganne to conſider of his wealth, of his
callyng, of the reuerence wherewith he was vſed in the Citie,
and that likewiſe in beyng his wife, ſhe ſhould alſo bee had in
eſtimation, and bee preferred before other women of meaner
credite, and to deſire ſuperioritie, it is commonly euery womans
ſickneſſe, and therefore this could not chooſe but pleaſe
her very well: then ſhe remembred how commodious it were
to marrie one ſo wealthie as Phylotus, whereby ſhe ſhould not
neede to beate her braines aboute the practiſing of houſewiferie,
but ſhould haue ſeruauntes at commaundment to ſupplie
that tourne, this likewiſe pleaſed her very well, but becauſe
ſhe would well perſwade her ſelf, ſhe beganne to coniecture
how ſhe ſhould ſpende the tyme to her contentment, and therefore
ſhe beganne to thinke what a pleaſure it was to bee well
furniſhed with ſondrie ſutes of apparell, that in the mornyng
when ſhe ſhould riſe, ſhe might call for what ſhe liſt to put on,
accordyng as the tyme and the faſſhion did require, and her
fancie ſerued beſt, for thus Phylotus was well able to keepe
his wife, and this pleaſed her likewiſe very well, & then when
ſhe were vp, ſhe might breake her faſt with a cuppe of Malmſie,
or Muſkadine next her harte. It was very good for ill
Ayres in a mornyng, and this ſhe thought was but an eaſie
matter, and likewiſe pleaſed her very well: when ſhe had broken
her faſt, then ſhe might ſtirre about the houſe, and looke to
this, and ſee to that, and where ſhe found any thyng amis, not
to touche it with her owne fingers, for marryng the beautie of
her hande, but to call for Cicelie, Ione, or Cate, and to chide
them like Sluttes, that thei could not ſpie a fault but when
thei muſt be tolde: this likewiſe pleaſed her very well, then to

haue prouided for Dinner ſome iuncketts, that ſerued beſt her
appetite, her houſebāde had good ſtore of coine, and how could
it bee better ſpente, then vpon themſelues: to make their fare
the better, this likewiſe pleaſed her verie well, now when ſhe
had dined, then ſhe might goe ſeeke out her examplers, and to
peruſe whiche woorke would doe beſte in a Ruffe, whiche in a
Gorget, whiche in a Sleeue, whiche in a Quaife, whiche in a
Caule, whiche in a Handkercheef, what Lace would doe beſte
to edge it, what ſeame, what ſtitche, what cut, what gard, and
to ſit her doune, and take it forthe by little and little: and thus
with her Nedle to paſſe the after nonne, with deuiſing of thinges
for her owne wearyng, this likewiſe pleaſed her paſſyng
well: Then to prouide for Supper ſome ſhift of diet, and ſondrie
ſauces; the better to help the ſtomacke, Oranges, Lemōs,
Oliues, Caphers, Salades of ſondrie ſortes, alas a Croune
will goe a greate waie in ſuche trifles. This likewiſe pleaſed
her verie well, whē ſhe had ſupped, to vſe ſome exerciſe, accordyng
to the ceaſon: if it were in Sommer, to goe walke with
her neighbours to take the aire, or in her Garde in to take the
verdure of ſweete and pleaſaunt flower, this likewiſe pleaſed
her verie well, when ſhe was come in, and readie to goe to her
Chamber, a Cup of cold Sacke to bedward, is verie good for
digeſtion, and no coſte to ſpeake of, where ſuche abondaunce
doeth remaine, and this likewiſe pleaſed her verie well.
               But now although ſhe had deuiſed, to paſſe the daie tyme
with ſuche contentation, when ſhe remembred at Night, ſhe
muſt goe to bed to bee lubber leapt: and with what cold courteſie
ſhe ſhould be entertained by her graie hedded bedfelowe,
what froſen embracementes he was able to beſtowe of her, all
was marde, and quite daſhte out of remembraunce, and all the
commodities before ſpoken of, that ſhe ſhould receiue in the
tyme of the daie, would not ſerue to counteruaile that one incommoditie,
in the ſeaſon of the Night: Like as wee ſaie, one
vice ſpilles a greate nomber of vertues. Thus Emelia was
now to ſeeke, and could in nowiſe frame her ſelf to loue Philotus:
but when ſhe had flattered her ſelf with a thouſande delightes,
that ſhe ſhould receiue in the daie time by his wealth,

when ſhe remembred bedde tyme, ſhe was as newe to beginne
as before. Wherefore ſhe remained in great perplexitie, thinkyng
her happe to bee ouer hard, and the comforte verie bare,
where the beſte choice had ſuche aſſuraunce of doubtfull ende.
For to Marrie after her Fathers mynde, ſhe knewe would
breede her lothed life: and to gainſaie what he had determined,
would likewiſe looſe her fathers, likyng, that ſhe wiſte not for
her life whereon to reſolue, and thus from daie to daie, as ſhe
continued in this doubt. There happened to hit into her companie
a yong Romaine gentleman, whoſe name was Flanius,
who ſodainly fell in Loue with Emelia, and takyng the tyme
whileſt his opportunitie ſerued: he let Emelia to vnderſtande, of
the greate loue he bare her. Emelia, accordyng to the cuſtome
of women, made the matter verie coie at the firſte, although in
her harte ſhe wer right glad, cōſideryng her caſe how it ſtood.
Flanius was ſo muche the more importunate vppon her, and
with ſuche nice termes as woers be accuſtomed: He ſo Courted,
and followed Emelia, that ſhe perceiuyng his feruente affection,
tolde hym a verie ſhort circumſtaunce, how her father
had diſpoſed her, to one that ſhe could not like of, and therfore,
if he would firſte promiſe to take her as his wife, and that he
could finde ſuche meanes, to conueigh her from her Fathers
houſe in ſecrete ſorte (for otherwiſe ſhe was ſure her Father
would bee a let to hinder their purpoſe) ſhe was contented to
harken to his ſpeeche, and yeeld to his demaunde. Flanius the
gladdeſt man in the world, to heare theſe ioyfull newes, ſware
vnto her, that all ſhould bee accompliſhed, and that with as
muche ſpeede as her ſelf would deſire.
               There was no more to conclude of thē, but how ſhe might
be conueighed from out her fathers houſe. Flanius deuiſed that
late in an Euenyng, or in the Night tyme when euery one
were quiete in their beddes, if ſhe could finde the meanes to
gette forthe of doores, then he would be readie to receiue her.
But that could not be, for bothe her Fathe and Mather neuer
failed, to bee at home in the Euenynges, and at Nightes ſhe
was lodged in her Fathers Chambers, that it was impoſſible
for her to gett forthe. So that there was no remedie, but that

the feate muſt bee wrought in ſome after Noone, when bothe
her Father and Mother vſed to bee abroade, about their buſineſſe:
And then ſhe knewe not how to come forthe alone, becauſe
ſhe had not been accuſtomed ſo to dooe, and to followe a
ſtraunger, it would breede the greater ſuſpition.
               But Flanius to auoide all theſe ſurmiſes, deuiſed the nexte
euenyng, to conueigh her in at ſome backe windowe of her fathers
houſe, a ſute of mannes apparell: wherein the next daie in
the after noone, her father & mother beyng abroad, ſhe ſhould
ſhift her ſelf, and ſo come her waies vnknowne of any, to ſuche
a place: where he himſelf would be ready awaiting for her, and
ſo conueigh her home to his owne houſe. This deuiſe Emelia
liked paſſyng will, and accordyng as it was appoincted. The
next euening Flanius cōueighed this ſute of apparell in at the
windowe, where Emelia was ready to receiue it, and laiyng it
vp in ſafetie, til the next daie in the after noone, her father and
her mother beyng bothe forthe of dores, ſhe quickly ſhifted her
ſelf, into this manes apparell, and thus forth of dores ſhe goes
to her appointed place, wher Flanius was ſtaiyng, who accordyng
to promiſe, conueighed her home to his owne houſe.
               This matter was not ſo cloſely handeled by Emelia, but
ſhe was eſpied by one of her Fathers ſeruauntes, who beeyng
on the backſide through a Windowe, ſawe her how ſhe was
ſtripping of her ſelf, and marked how ſhe put on the mannes
apparell, whereat the yong fellowe had greate meruaile, and
ſtoode ſtill beholdyng to ſee what would fall out in the ende,
But whē he ſawe her goe forthe a dores, he haſtened after into
the ſtreate: But Emelia was ſo ſodainly gone, that for his life
hr wiſt not whiche waies to ſeeke after her, wherfore in a wō
                  derfull
haſte, he came to his Maiſter, whom he founde in the
Citee, in the companie of Philotus, ſaiyng: Oh ſir, I haue verie
euill newes to tell you, what is the matter (ꝙ his maiſter)
is any thyng a miſſe at home? Yea ſir (ꝙ the ſeruaunte) your
daughter Emelia is euen now departed into the Citee, in the
habite of a man: But whiche waies ſhe wente, I could not for
my life deuiſe, for after ſhe gat once forthe of the place where
ſhe ſhifter her, I could neuer more ſet eye of her.
               
                  
Is Emelia gone (quoth her louer Philotus) Oh God, what
euill newes bee theſe that I heare: And without any further
ſtaie, bothe the Father and the Louer, gat them out at the doores
together, and aboute the ſtreates thei runne like a couple
of madde men.
               Now it fell out, that Philerno the Sonne of Alberto, and
Brother to Emella, whom you haue heard before, was lefte at
Naples, beeyng an Infante, and had remained there till this
tyme at Schoole, and at this verie inſtaunte was come from
Naples to Rome, to viſite his Father and Mother, of whom
he had no maner of knowledge, otherwiſe then by their names.
And it fortuned that Alberto and Philotus, happened to
meete with Philerno in the ſtreates, who was ſo like his ſiſter
Emelia, that bothe Alberto and Philotus, aſſured themſelues,
that it could bee no other but ſhe. Wherefore Alberto commyng
to hym, ſaied: ſtaie, ſtaie, moſte ſhameleſſe and vngraci
                  
                     •
                  us
Girle, doeſt thou thinke that by thy diſguiſing of thy ſelf,
in this maner, thou canſt eſcape vnknowne to me, who am thy
Father, Ah vile ſtrumpet that thou art: what puniſhement is
ſufficient for the filthineſſe of thy facte? And with this he ſeemed,
as though he would haue fline vpon her in the ſtreate, to
haue beate her: but Phllotus thruſte in betweene them, and deſired
his neighbour to ſtaie hymſelf, and then imbracyng Philerno
in his armes, he ſaied: Ah Emelia my ſweete and louing
wenche, how canſte thou ſo vnkindelie forſake thy Philotus,
whoſe tender loue towardes thee is ſuche, that as I will not
let to make thee ſoueraigne of my ſelf, ſo thou ſhalt be Dame
and Miſtreſſe of all that euer I haue, aſſuryng thee, that thou
ſhalt neuer want for Golde, Gemmes, Iewelles, ſuche as bee
fit and conuenient for thy degree.
               
                  Philerno ſeeyng a couple of old dotyng foole, thus cluſteryng
aboute hym, not knowyng what thei were: had thought
at the firſt, thei had been out of their wittes, but in the ende by
their woordes, perceiuyng a farther circumſtance in the matter,
he deuiſed ſome thyng for his owne diſporte, to feede them
a little with their owne follie, ſaied: Pardon me I beſeeche
you this my greeuous offence, wherein I knowe I haue too

farre ſtraied, from the limites and boundes of modeſtie, proteſtyng
hereafter ſo to gouerne my ſelf, that there ſhall bee no
ſufficient cauſe, whereby to accuſe me of ſuche vnmaiden like
partes, and will euer remaine with ſuche duetie and obediēce,
as I truſt ſhall not deſerue but to be liked duryng life.
               
                  Philotus hauyng heard this pitifull reconciliation, made
by his Emelia, verie gently entreated her father, in her behalf,
well (ꝙ her father) ſeeyng you will needes haue me to forgiue
this her leudneſſe, at your requeſte I am contented to pardon
her, and then ſpeakyng to Philerno, he ſaied.
               How ſaie you houſwife, is your ſtomacke yet come doune,
are you contented to take Philotus for your Houſebande, yea
my good Father (ꝙ Philerno) and that with all my harte, Oh
happie newes (ꝙ) Philotus) and here withall he began to ſette
his cappe on the one ſide, and to turne vp his muſchatoes, and
fell to wipyng of his mouthe, as though he would haue falne
a kiſſyng of her by and by in the ſtreates, but remēbryng hym
ſelf where he was, he brought Alberto with Philerno, into a
freendes houſe, that was of his familiare acquaintaunce, and
there the Marriage betweene theim, was throughlie concluced,
and all parties ſeemyng to giue their full conſentes. Philotus
deſired his father in Lawe, that he might haue the cuſtodie
of Emelia, ſwearing by his old honeſtie, that he would not
otherwiſe vſe her, then his owne Daughter Briſilla, vntill the
daie of his Nuptials, and then to vſe her as his wife: to which
requeſt Alberto ſeemed verie willynglie to giue conſent: but
then becauſe Philotus would not carrie his beloued, through
the ſtreates in her mannes apparell, he deſired his Father in
Lawe to goe home, and ſende ſome ſute of her apparell, wherwith
to ſhift her, before he would carrie her to his owne houſe.
Alberto ſeyng matters ſo throughly concluded, toke his leaue
of theim bothe, and goyng his waies home, he cauſed all his
Daughters apparell to be looked together, and to bee ſent to
the place where Philotus was remaining with Philerno, who
taking forthe ſuche as ſhould ſerue the tourne for that preſent.
Philerno ſo well as he could arraied hymſelf, in one of his ſiſters
ſutes of apparell, and thus departed with Philotus to his

owne houſe, where Philotus callyng his daughter Briſilla, he
ſaied vnto her, beholde here the partie, whom I haue choſen to
bee your Mother, chargyng you of my bleſſyng, that you honour,
reuerence, and obeie her, and with all diligence that you
be attendaunt vpon her, and readie at an ynche to prouide her
of any thing, that ſhe ſhall either want or call for. And you my
deare and louyng Emelia, I dooe here ordaine and appoincte
you to bee Miſtreſſe of this houſe, and of all that is in it, deſiryng
you to accepte of this my Daughter, to doe you ſeruice
in the daie time, and in the night to vouchſafe her for your bedfellowe,
vntill our daie of Marriage bee prefixed, and then my
ſelf will ſupplie the rome. Philerno ſeyng the excellent beautie
of Briſilla, was nothyng ſorie to haue ſuche a bedfellowe,
but thought euery hower a daie, till night was come, whiche
beyng approched, to bedde thei went, where Philerno did not
thinke it his readieſt waie, to giue any ſodaine attempte, but
therefore he brake into this diſcourſe followyng.
               My Briſilla, were it not but that wee bee founde parciall in
the cauſes of our frendes, but eſpecially where the cauſes doe
touche our parentes, our iudgementes be ſo blinded by affection,
that we can neither ſee, nor well confeſſe a manifeſt truth:
but if matters might be conſidered on, without reſpect of perſones
with indifference, and accordyng to the truthe and equitie
of the cauſe: I durſt then put my ſelf in your arbitremente
my Briſilla, and to abide your ſentence, whereto I doubte not,
but you would confeſſe the preiudice I ſuſtaine, it is muche intollerable,
and almoſte impoſſible▪ for a yong maide to endure
and the rather, if you would meaſure my condition, by your
owne eſtate, who beeyng as you ſee, a yong maiden like your
ſelf, and ſhould be thus conſtrained by my freendes, to the mariyng
of your father, whom I doe confeſſe to bee worthie of a
better wife then my ſelf. But conſideryng the inequalitie of
our yeres, I can not for my life, frame my ſelf to loue him, and
yet I am forced againſt my will to Marrie hym, and am appointed
to be your mother: that am more meete to be your cō
                  panion
and plaie fellowe. But that affiaunce whiche I haue
conceiued in your good Nature, hath made me thus boldly to

ſpeake vnto you, deſiryng but to heare your opinion with indifferencie,
whether you thinke I haue good cauſe to cōplain
or naie: and then peraduenture I will ſaie farther vnto you,
in a matter that doeth concerne your owne behoofe.
               
                  Briſilla hearyng this pitifull complaint, verie ſorrowfull in
her behalfe, ſaied: would to God I were as well able to miniſter
releef vnto your diſtreſſe, accordyng to your owne contentment,
as I am hartely ſorie to conſider your greef, and do
well perceiue the iuſte occaſion you haue to complaine.
               Ah my Briſilla, ſaied Philerno, I am as hartely ſorie in your
behalf, and peraduenture doe vnderſtande ſomethyng, whiche
your ſelf dooe not yet knowe of, whiche will greeue you verie
ſore. But firſt Briſilla, let me aſke you this queſtion, dooe you
knowe my father, or naie.
               No ſure (quoth Briſilla) I haue no maner of knowledge of
hym, neither did I knowe, whether you had any father a liue,
or naie, but now by your owne reporte, and as ſtraunge it was
to me, to heare the wordes, whiche my Father vſed to me this
daie, when he brought you home, for that I neuer vnderſtoode
before, that he went about a wife.
               
                  Philerno was verie glad to heare theſe newes, becauſe it
ſerued ſo muche the better for his purpoſe: and therefore ſaied
as followeth.
               This tale that I minde to tell you (my Briſilla) will ſeeme
more ſtraunge then all the reſte, and yet aſſure your ſelf, it is
nothyng ſo ſtraunge as true, and therefore giue eare to that I
mynde to ſaie: Doe you not thinke it verie ſtraunge in deede,
that the one of vs ſhould bee made bothe mother and daughter
to the other, and that our fathers, whiche be now ſo dieſcrepit
and olde, ſhould bee ſo ouer haled, with the furie of their fonde
and vnbrideled affections, that to ſerue their owne appetites,
thei force not with what clogges of care, thei comber vs that
be their louyng daughters, but haue concluded betwene them
ſelues a croſſe Marriage, and ſo in deede it maie well be tearmed,
that will fall out ſo ouerthwarte to our behoofes, who beyng
now in our yong and tender yeres, and ſhould bothe of vs
bee made the dearlynges of twoo old men, that ſeekes to preferre

their owne luſt, before their childrens loue, and meaſure
their fierie flames of youth, by the ded coles of age, as though
thei were able with their cold and rare imbracementes, to delaie
the forces of the fleſhe, whoſe flames doeth excede in theſe
our grene and tender yeres, and as muche poſſible for vs to cō
                  tinue
in likyng, as flowers are ſeen to agree with Froſte, but
in plaine tearmes (my Briſilla) and to diſcipher a verie trothe
it is contracted betweene our aged parentes, that your father
(as you ſee) ſhould firſt take me to his wife, whiche weddyng
beyng once performed, then my Father in like maner, ſhould
chalenge you, accordyng as it is concluded betweene them.
               Alas (ꝙ Briſilla) theſe newes bee ſtraunge in deede, and it
ſhould ſeem by your woordes ſo fullie reſolued on, that there
is no hope of redreſſe to be had in the matter.
               None in the worlde (ꝙ Philerno) but thus betweene our
ſelues, the one of vs to comfort the other.
               A colde comforte (ꝙ Briſilla) wee ſhall finde in that, but oh
pitileſſe parentes, that will preferre your own pleaſures with
your childrens paine: your owne likyng, with your childrens
loathyng: your owne gaine, with your childrens greefe: your
owne ſporte, with your childrens ſpoile: your owne delight,
with your childrens deſpight. O how muche more happie had
it been, that we had neuer been borne.
               Alas my Briſilla (ꝙ Philerno) tormente not your ſelf with
ſuche extreame anguiſhe, for if that would haue ſerued for redreſſe,
the matter had been remedied, and that long ſithence:
But I would to God my Briſilla, that I were a man for your
only ſake, and hauing ſo good leiſure, as thus beyng together
by our ſelues, we ſhould ſo handle the matter, that our fathers
ſhould ſeeke newe wiues.
               Alas (ꝙ Briſilla) ſuche wiſhes are but waſte, and vnpoſſible
it is, that any ſuche thing ſhould happen.
               Impoſſible (quoth Philerno) naie ſurely Briſilla, there is
nothing impoſſible, but I haue knowne as greate matters as
theſe haue been wrought: Doe we not read that the Goddeſſe
Venus, tranſformed an Iuorie Image, to a liuely and perfect
woman, at the onelie requeſt of Pygmalion. Diana likewiſe

conuerted Acteon to a Harte. Narciſſus for his pride was turned
to a flower. Archane to a Spider, with a greate number
of others haue bin tranſformed, ſome into Beaſtes, ſome into
Foules, and ſome into Fiſhes, but amongſt the reſt of the miracles
that haue bin wrought by the Goddeſſe, this ſtorie falleth
out moſte me
                     •
                  te and fittyng to our purpoſe.
               There was ſometime remainyng in the Countrey of Pheſtos
a maried couple, the houſbande called by the name of Lictus,
the wife Telethuſa, who beyng with childe, was willed
by her houſbande ſo ſone as ſhe ſhould be deliuered, if it were
not a lad, that the childe ſhould preſently be ſlaine, his wife beyng
deliuered at her appointed tyme, brought forthe a girle,
and yet notwithſtandyng her houſbandes commaundement,
brought vp the childe, makyng her houſebande beleeue it was
a boye, and called it by the name of Iphis, and thus as it grew
in yeares, was apparelled like a lad, and beeyng after by his
father aſſured to a wife called by the name of Ianthe, a young
Maiden, and the daughter of one Teleſt dwellyng in Dictis,
Telethuſa the mother of Iphis, fearyng her deceipt would bee
knowne, deferred of the Marriage daie ſo long as ſhe could,
ſometymes fainyng tokens of ill ſucceſſe, ſometimes faining
ſickneſſe, ſometymes one thyng, ſometymes an other, but
when all her ſhiftes were driuen to an ende, and the Mariage
daie at hande, Telethuſa comming to the Temple of the Goddeſſe
Iſis, with her heire ſcattered aboute her eares, where before
the Aulter of Iſis, ſhe made her humble ſupplications, and
the gentle Goddeſſe hauing compaſſion, tranſformed Iphis to
a man.
               Loe here Briſilla, as greate a matter brought to paſſe as any
wee haue ſpoken of yet, and the Goddeſſe bee of as greate
force and might in theſe daies, as euer thei were in times paſt,
we want but the ſame zeale and faith to demaunde it, and ſure
in my opinion, if either of vs made our requeſt to the Goddes,
who commonly bee ſtill aſſiſtant to helpe diſtreſſed wightes,
thei would neuer refuſe to graunt our reaſonable requeſtes,
and I will aduenture on it my ſelf, and that without any farther
circumſtaunce.
               
                  
And here with all he ſeemed with many piteous ſighes,
throwyng vp his handes to the heauens, to mumble forth many
woordes in ſecrete, as though he had beene in ſome greate
contemplation, and ſodainly without any maner of ſtirryng
either of hande or foote, did lye ſtill as it had been a thyng immouable,
whereat Briſilla beganne for to muſe, and in the end
ſpake to hym, but Phylerno made no maner of aunſwere, but
ſeemed as though he had bin in ſome traunce, wherewith Briſilla
began to call and with her arme to ſhake hym, and Phylerno
giuyng a piteous ſigh, as though he had bin awaked ſodainly
out of ſome dreame, ſaied. O bleſſed Goddeſſe Venus,
I yeeld thee humble thankes, that haſt not deſpiſed to graunt
my requeſt: and then ſpeakyng to Briſilla, he ſaied: and now
my Briſilla be of good comforte, for the ſame Goddeſſe whiche
haue not diſdained to heare my ſupplication, will likewiſe be
aſſiſtaunt to further our farther pretences, as hereafter at our
better leiſure we ſhall conſider of, in the meane tyme receiue
thy louyng freende, that to daie was appoincted to bee thy fathers
wife, but now conſecrated by the Goddeſſe to be thy louyng
houſbande, and here withall imbraſyng Briſilla in his
armes. She perceiued in deede, that Emelia was perfectly
metamorphoſed, which contented her very well, thinkyng her
ſelf a thriſe happie woman to light of ſuche a bedfellowe: thus
bothe of them the one pleaſed very well with the other, thei
paſſed the tyme, till Phylotus had prepared and made all thinges
readie for his Mariage daie, and then callyng his frendes
and neighbours about him, to the Churche thei goe together,
where Alberto gaue Phylerno his ſonne, in the ſteede of his
daughter Emelia to Phylotus for his wife: when all the reſt of
the Marriage rites that are to bee doen in the Churche were
performed, thei paſſed forthe the daie with feaſtyng and great
mirthe vntill it was night. When the companie beganne to
breake vp, and euery one to take his leaue, and Phylotus with
his bride were brought into their Chamber, where Phylerno
deſiryng the companie to auoyde, and makyng faſt the doore
he ſaied to Phylotus, there reſteth yet a matter to bee decided
betweene you and me, and ſeyng we bee here together by our

ſelues, and that tyme and place doeth fall out ſo fit, I holde it
for the beſt that it be preſently determined.
               What is the matter then (ꝙ Phylotus) ſpeake boldly my
Emelia, and if there be any thyng that hanges in diſpence betweene
vs, I truſt it ſhall eaſely bee brought to a good agreement.
               I praie God it maie (ꝙ Phylerno) and to reueale the matter
in breefe and ſhorte circumſtaunce, it is this. You are now
my houſebande, and I your lawfull wife, and for that I dooe
knowe the difference in our yeares, your ſelf beyng ſo old and
I very yong, it muſt needes fall out there wil be as greate deuerſitie
in our conditions: for age is commonly giuen to bee
frowarde, teſtie, and ouerthwart: youth againe to be frolique,
pleaſaunt, and merrie, and ſo likewiſe in all our other conditions
wee ſhall bee founde ſo contrary and diſagreyng, that it
will be impoſſible for vs to like the one of the others doinges,
for when I ſhall ſeeme to followe my owne humour, then it
will fall out to your diſcontentment. And you againe to followe
that diet whiche your age doeth conſtraine, will be moſt
lothſome vnto me, then you beyng my houſbande will thinke
to commaunde me, and I muſt be obedient to your will, but
I beyng your wife will thinke ſcorne to be controlde, and wil
diſpoſe of my ſelf according to my owne liking, and then what
braules and brabbles will fall out, it were to muche to be rehearſed,
and thus we ſhall liue neither of vs bothe in quiet, nor
neither of vs bothe contented, and therefore for the auoidyng
of theſe inconueniences, I haue deuiſed this waie, that beyng
thus together by our ſelues, we will trie by the eares whiche
of vs ſhall bee maiſter and haue authoritie to commaunde: if
the victory happen on your ſide, I am contented for euer after
to frame my ſelf to your ordinaunce and will as it ſhall pleaſe
you to appoinct: if otherwiſe the conqueſt happen on my ſide,
I will triumph like a Victor, and will looke to beare ſuche a
ſwaie, that I will not be contraried in any thing, what ſo euer
it ſhall pleaſe me to commaunde.
               
                  Phylotus knowyng not what to make of theſe ſpeeches,
and thinkyng the tyme very long, till he had taken his firſt

fruites, ſaied: Come, come my Emelia let vs goe to bed, where
I doubt not but we ſhall ſo well agree, that theſe matters wil
eaſely bee taken vp, without any controuerſie, ſuche as you
haue ſpoken of.
               Neuer while I liue (ꝙ Phylerno) before I knowe whereon
to reſolue: and whether you ſhall reſt at my commaundement,
or I at yours.
               Why (ꝙ Phylotus) doe you ſpeake in earneſt, or would you
looke to commaunde me that am your houſbande, to whom
you ought to vſe all duetie and obedience.
               Then were I in good caſe (ꝙ Phylerno) that ſhould be tied
to vſe duetie or obedience, to a man of your yeares, that would
not let to preſcribe vs rules of your owne dotage, to be obſerued
in ſteede of domeſticall diſcipline.
               Then I perceiue (ꝙ Phylotus) wee ſhall haue ſomethyng
adoe with you hereafter, that will vſe me with theſe tearmes
the very firſt night. But ſee you make no more to dooe, but
come on your waies to bed.
               And I perceiue (quoth Phylerno) the longer that I beare
with you, the more foole I ſhall finde you, and with this vp
with his fiſte and gaue Phylotus a ſure wheritte on the eare.
Phylotus in a great rage flies againe to Phylerno: there was
betweene them ſouſe for ſouſe, and boxe for boxe, that it was
harde to Iudge who ſhould haue the victorie. In the ende
Phylerno gettes Phylotus faſte by the graie bearde, and by
plaine force pu

                  es him doune on the flower, and ſo be pomels
hym aboute the face, that he was like to haue been ſtrangled
with his owne bloud, which guſhed out of his noſe and mouth.
Wherefore holdyng vp his handes he cried, Oh Emelia, I
yeeld my ſelf vanquiſhed and ouercome, for Gods ſake holde
thy handes, and I will neuer more contende with thee during
life.
               
                  Phylerno ſtaiyng hymſelf, ſaied: Art thou contented then
to yeeld me the conqueſt, and hereafter this according as thou
haſt ſaied: neuermore to ſtriue with me, neuer to gainſaie any
thyng, what ſoeuer it ſhall pleaſe me to commaunde.
               Neuer while I liue (ꝙ Phylotus) and therefore for Gods

ſake 
                     〈◊〉

you pleaſe, whiche forme ſhall neuer be denaied ſo long as I
ſhall liue.
               Well (ꝙ Phylerno) but before I will let you ariſe, I will
haue you promiſe me to confirme theſe conditions, whiche folowe
in this maner. Firſt, that at my pleaſure I maie goe abroade
with my freendes, to make merrie ſo often as I liſt,
whither I liſt, and with whom I liſt. And neither at my goyng
forthe, to be demaunded whither I will, ne at my returne
to bee aſked where I haue been. I will farther haue you condeſcende
to this, that for as muche as I haue learned, that it
is not onely very vntothſome, but likewiſe very vnwholeſome,
for youth and age, to lye ſokyng together in one bedde.
I will therefore make no bedfellowe of you, but at my owne
pleaſure. And in maner as followeth, that is to ſaie: this firſt
yere I ſhall be contented, to beſtowe one night in a moneth to
doe you pleaſure, if I

bee able to deſerue it: but the firſt yere beyng oure expired, fower
tymes a yeere maie very well ſuffice, that is one night a
quarter, as it ſhall pleaſe my ſelf to appoinct. There be many
other matters whiche I will not now ſtande to repeate, but
theſe before rehearſed, bee the principall thynges wherein I
wil not be controlde, but meane to follow myne owne liking:
How ſaie you Phylotus, can you bee contented to frame your
ſelf herein, to followe my direction.
               Alas (quoth Phylotus) I ſee no other ſhift, I muſt perforce
endeuour my ſelf patiently to abide what ſoeuer it ſhall pleaſe
you to commaunde, and doe yeeld my ſelf as recreant, and ouercome,
and wholy doe put my ſelf to your fauour and mer

                  Phylotus, comforting hymſelf with theſe ſweete ſpeeches,

                  Phylerno, hauyng prepared one of theſe Marcenarie women
(whereof there are greate ſtore in Rome to bee had) conueighed
her to the bedd of Phylotus, giuyng her enſtructions
how to vſe her ſelf: and went hymſelf to his beſt beloued Briſilla,
whom he had made priuie to his whole deuiſe, and in this
maner it was agreed betweene them, thei had thought to haue
dieted Phylotus once a moneth with ſome caſt ſtuffe, ſuche as
thei could hire beſt cheape in the Toune.
               But it fell out that Flanius, whom you haue heard before,
had ſtolne awaie Emelia, beyng at the Churche the ſame daie
that Phylotus was maried, and ſawe Alberto giue his daughter
Emelia to Phylotus for his wife: had thought aſſuredly
that hymſelf had been deceiued by ſome Deuill or ſpirite, that
had taken vpon hym the likeneſſe of Emelia. And therefore haſtyng
hymſelf home with all poſſible ſpeede, came to Emelia,
and bleſſing himſelf he ſaied: I charge thee in the name of the
liuyng GOD, that thou tell me what thou art, and that thou
preſently departe to the place from whence thou cameſt. And
I coniure thee in the name of the holie Trinitie, by our bleſſed
Ladie the Virgine Marie, by Aungels and Archaungels,
Patriarkes and Prophetes, by the Apoſtles, and fower Euangeliſtes,
Matthewe, Marke, Luke and Ihon, by al the holie
Martyres and Confeſſours, and the reſt of the rable and
bleſſed route of Heauen, that thou quietly departe without any
maner of preiudice, either to man, woman, or childe, either
to any maner of Beaſt that is vppon the face of the earth, the
Foules of the ayre, or the Fiſhes of the Sea, and without any
maner of Tempeſt, Storme, Whirle winde, Thunder or
Lightnyng, and that thou take no maner of ſhape, that 
                     〈◊〉
                  
ſeeme either terrible or fearfull vnto me.
               
                  Emelia hearyng theſe wordes, merueilyng muche what
thei ment▪ with a 
                     ••
                  ilyng countenaunce came towardes Flanius,
ſaiyng: Why how now Seignior Flanius▪
                   what doe you
thinke me to be ſome Deuill, or any Hagge of Hell, that you
fall ſo to Coniuryng, and bleſſyng of your ſelf.
               
                  
I charge thee come no nere (quoth Fla

theſe inticementes can no longer abuſe me, when I haue ſeen
with myne eyes, my beloued Emelia, maried in the Churche,
and giuen by Alberto her Father, to Phylotus for his wife,
what ſhould I thinke of thee but to be ſome Fee
                     •
                  d, or ſent vnto
me by ſome Inchauntment▪ or Witchcraft, and therefore
I will no longer neither of thy companie, neither of thy conference:
And here withall takyng Emelia by the ſhoulders, he
thruſt her forthe of doores, and ſhuttyng the doore after her:
He gat hym to his Chamber, where he fell to his praiers, thinkyng
aſſuredly that Emelia had been ſome ſpirite.
               But Emelia, after ſhe had a three or fower daies made what
meanes ſhe could to Flanius, and ſawe it was in vaine: was
driuen to goe to her Father, before whom fallyng vppon her
knees, ſhe deſired hym moſte humbly to forgiuer her.
               
                  Alberto takyng her vp in his armes ſaied: that he knewe
nothyng wherein ſhe had offended hym, but her ſuite might
eaſily be graunted.
               Deare father (quoth Emelia) I know I haue offended, and
ſo farr as my fact deſerueth, rather to be puniſhed then pitied:
the remēbraunce whereof is ſo lothſome vnto me, that I feare
to call you by the name of father, hauing ſhewed my ſelf ſo vnworthie
a daughter. Theſe wordes ſhe pronounced with ſuch
ſorrowe, that the teares ſtreamed doune her cheekes, wherewith
Alberto moued with naturall affection, ſaid: deare child,
I knowe no ſuche offence that ought to bee ſo greeuouſly taken:
but ſpeake boldly what ſo euer it be, I freely forgiue it.
               
                  Emelia very well comforted with theſe ſpeeches, beganne
to diſcourſe how ſhe firſt diſguiſed her ſelf in Pages appare
                     ••
                  ,
and what greef it was to her conſcience, that ſhe ſhould ſo farr
ſtraie from the duetie and obedience of a child, and to become
a fugitiue in a mans apparell. But her father not ſufferyng
her further to proceede in her tale, ſaied: Alas deare daughter
if this bee the matter, it is long agoe ſithe I haue bothe forgiuen
and forgotten theſe cauſes: and therefore let theſe thynges
neuer trouble you. But tell me now how doe you like of
your bedfellows, how agree you with hym, or he with you, I

would be glad to knowe.
               Alas deare father (quoth Emelia) that is the matter that I
come to you, he hath turned me awaie, and wil no longer take
me for his wife, and what is the cauſe that hath moued hym
vnto it, I proteſt before God I knowe not for my life.
               Hath he turned thee awaie (ꝙ Alberto) my ſelf wil quickly
finde a remedie for that matter, and without any more to do
(would not tary ſo much as while his goune was a bruſhing)
but out of doores he goes towards Phylotus, whō by chaunce
he met withall in the Streates, and in a greate chafe begins
to chalenge hym for abuſyng of his daughter, ſwearyng that
he would make all Rome to ſpeake of his abuſe, if he ment to
proceede in that he had begunne.
               
                  Phylotus wonderyng to ſee the man in ſuche an agonie,
beganne to wiſhe that he had neuer ſeene hym nor his daughter
neither, and that if any bodie haue cauſe to complaine it is
I (quoth Phylotus) that haue maried ſuch a wife, that is more
like to a Deuill then a woman: and I perceiue now is maintained
in her miſchiefe by you that are her father, who ought
rather to rebuke her then ſo to take her part, and to incourage
her in her leudeneſſe.
               What incouragment is this you ſpeake of (ꝙ Alberto) I
knowe not what you meane by theſe wordes, but aſſure your
ſelf of this, that as I wil not maintaine my child in any thing
that is euill, ſo I will not ſee her take a manifeſt wrong.
               Doe you thinke this to be good then (quoth Phylotus) that
your daughter ſhould beſtowe ſuche hanſell on her houſband
as ſhe hath alreadie beſtowed vpon me, and then pointyng to
his face, he ſaied: See here your daughters handie woorke,
how thinke you, is this requiſite to be borne with all, that you
ſtande ſo muche in your daughters defence?
               
                  Alberto ſeeyng his face all ſwolne, and the ſkinne ſcratched
of, perceiued that Phylotus was at a fraie, and had good
cauſe to complaine: And wonderyng that his daughter was
ſo ſodainly become a ſhrewe, ſaied: If this bee my daughters
handie woorke, I can neither beare withall, neither will I allowe
it in her, ſo to vſe her houſebande. And therefore I praie

you, lette me heare the matter debated betweene you: and I
doubte not, but to take ſuche order, as there ſhall no more any
ſuche rule happen betweene you.
               I am contented you ſhall debate what you will (ꝙ Philotus)
ſo it maie be doen with quietneſſe, but I will neuer more
contende with her for the maiſterie while I liue, ſhe hath alredie
wonne it, I am contented ſhe ſhall weare it.
               I praie you then (quoth Alberto) that you wil goe home to
your owne houſe, and I will goe fetche my daughter, and will
come vnto you ſtraight waie, and I doubt not but to take ſuche
order betweene you, as ſhall fall out to bothe your likinges.
               I praie God you maie (ꝙ Philotus) and I will goe home▪
and there will ſtaie your commyng.
               
                  Alberto likewiſe went to his owne houſe, and callyng Emelia,
ſaied neuer a woorde to her, but willed her to followe
hym: and commyng to the houſe of Philotus, whom he founde
within, tariyng his commyng. And it fortuned at the ſame 
                     〈◊〉
                  ,
Philerno and Briſilla, bothe were gone into the Toune
to buye certaine thynges, that thei had neede of. And Alberto
beginnyng firſt to rebuke his Daughter, that would ſeme
in ſuche maner to abuſe her houſebande, and with a long diſcourſe
he preached vnto her, with what duetie and obedience,
women ought to vſe their houſebandes withall, and not to
take vpon them like Maiſters, to correcte and chaſtice theim.
Emelia denaied not onelie the facte, but alſo ſhe denaied Philotus
to be her houſebande.
               What haue wee here to dooe (quoth the Father) how canſt
thou (ſhameleſſe queane) denaie that, whiche within theſe fower
daies was performed, in the face of the whole worlde?
               
                  Emelia ſtandyng ſtiffe to her tackelyng: would in nowiſe
confeſſe that euer ſhe was Married.
               Then her Father beganne to charge her with her owne
woordes, whiche he had vsed to her before, how ſhe had diſguiſed
her ſelf in mannes apparell, and ſo ſtolne awaie forthe of
doores, the which Emelia neuer denaied. Why then (quoth her
father) did not I meete thee in the ſtreates, and at the requeſte
of thy houſebande here preſente, did forgiue thee thy faulte, to

whom I then deliuered thee, and with whom thou haſte euer
ſithence remained.
               
                  Emelia made flat deniall of any of all theſe ſaiynges to bee
true. Alberto in a greate furie, would haue taken witneſſe of
Philotus in the matter, but Philotus fearyng an other banket
at night, when he ſhould goe to bedde, durſte not in any wiſe
ſeeme to contrarie Emelia: In the ende after greate fendyng
and prouyng had in the matter, Emelia from poinct to poincte
diſcourſed to her Father, how ſhe firſte fell into the likyng of
Flanius, and by his practiſe, ſo conueighed her ſelf awaie in his
Pages apparell, and had with hym remained all this while,
till now he had tourned her awaie.
               Her father would in nowiſe allowe this tale to be true, but
Flanius beeyng well knowne to bee a courteous Gentleman,
Alberto deuiſed to ſende for hym, who preſently at his gentle
intreatie, came to the houſe of Philotus, where he ſpared not
to confeſſe a truth, that onely for the loue that he bare to Emelia,
he deuiſed to ſteale her awaie: and there came one vnto
him in the likeneſſe of Emelia, and in the ſame apparell that he
had prouided for her, whom he verie charely kept, vntill ſuche
tyme as he ſawe with his owne eyes, that Emelia was Married
in the Churche to Philotus, and then aſſuryng hym ſelf,
that he had been deceiued by ſome Spirite, that had taken vppon
the ſimilitude and likeneſſe of Emelia, he preſently came
home, and tourned her awaie, and what was become of her, he
could neuer learne.
               
                  Alberto muche amazed to heare this tale, ſaied: Seignior
Flanius doe you knowe your Emelia again, if you ſee her, and
then poinctyng to his daughter, he ſaied: Is not this the ſame
Emelia that you ſpeake of, whiche you haue tourned awaie.
               I knowe not (ꝙ Flanius) the one from the other, but ſure I
ſawe with myne eyes twoo Emelias ſo like, that the one of thē
of force muſt needes bee the Deuill.
               There is no queſtion (ꝙ Philotus) but that is my wife, if
there bee euer a Deuill of them bothe, I knowe it is ſhe: Out
alas that euer I was borne, what ſhall I now dooe, I knowe
I haue Married the Deuill.
               
                  
And by fortune as Alberto chaunced to looke forthe of th
                     •
                  
windowe, he eſpied Philerno and Briſilla in the Streate commyng
homewardes: Peace (ꝙ Alberto) here commeth the other
Emelia, wee ſhall now trie, whiche of them is the Deuill
(I thinke) before we departe.
               By this Philerno was come in, and hearyng how matters
had been debated, and were falne out: againe, knowing Alberto
to be his Father, and what preiudice his ſiſter Emelia was
like to ſuſtaine, if ſhe ſhould be forſaken by her freende and louer
Flanius, confeſſed the whole matter, humblie deſiryng his
Father to forgiue hym.
               When he had a while wondered at the circumſtaunce, and
the truthe of euery thyng laied open, and come to light, all
parties were well pleaſed and contented, ſauyng Philotus,
for when he remembred, firſt the loſſe of his loue Emelia, then
how Philerno had heaten hym, what a bedfellowe he had prouided
hym, while he hym ſelf went and laie with his Daughter:
theſe thinges put all together, made hym in ſuche a chafe,
that he was like to runne out of his wittes: But when he had
regarded a good while, and ſawe how little helpe it did preuaile
hym, he was contented in the ende, that his Daughter
Briſilla, ſhould Marrie with Philerno, and Flanius verie ioyfully
receiued againe his Emelia (when he knewe ſhe was
no Deuill) and bothe the Marriages conſummate
in one daie. And ſo I praie God giue them
ioye, and euery old dotarde ſo good
ſucceſſe as had Philotus.

               The Concluſion.
               
                  GEntle Reader, now thou haſt peruſed
theſe Hiſtories to the ende, I
doubt not but thou wilte deeme of
thē, as thei worthily deſerue, and
thinke ſuche vanities more fitter
to be preſented on a ſtage (as ſome
of them haue been) then to bee publiſhed
in Printe (as till now thei
haue neuer been) but to excuſe my
ſelf of the follie that here might bee imputed vnto me, that my
ſelf beyng the firſt that haue put them to the print, ſhould likewiſe
be the firſt that ſhould condemne them as vaine: for mine
owne excuſe herein, I aunſwere: that in the writyng of them,
I haue vſed the ſame maner, that many of our yong Gentlemenne
vſeth now adaies, in the wearyng of their apparell,
whiche is rather to followe a faſhion that is newe (be it neuer
ſo fooliſhe) then to bee tied to a more decent cuſtome, that is
cleane out of vſe: Sometime wearyng their haire freeſeled ſo
long, that makes them looke like a water Spaniell: Sometymes
ſo ſhorte like a newe ſhorne Sheepe: Their Beardes
ſometimes cutte rounde like a Philippes Daler: Somtimes
ſquare like the Kinges hedde in Fiſheſtreate: Sometymes ſo
nere the ſkinne, that a man might iudge by his face, the Gentleman
had had verie pilde lucke, their Cappes and Hattes
ſometimes ſo bigge, as will holde more witte, then three of
them haue in their heddes: Sometimes ſo little, that it will
holde no witte at all. Their Ruffes ſometymes ſo huge, as
as ſhall hang abou their neckes like a Carte wheele: Some

                   trippe on their heeles: Sometimes ſo ſhorte,

Sometimes with long ſauſie ſleeues, that will bee in euery
diſhe before his maiſter, ſomtymes without ſleeues, like Scogins
manne, that vſed to runne of ſleeue leſſe errandes: The
Dublettes ſometime Faggot waſted about the Nauil, ſomtimes
Cowbealied belowe the flanckes, that the Gentlema
                     •
                  
muſt vndoe a button when he goes to piſſe.
               In their Hooſe ſo many faſhions as I can not deſcribe,
ſometymes Garragaſcoynes, breeched like a Beare, ſometimes
cloaſe to the docke, like the Deuill in a plaie (wanting
but a taile) ſometimes rounde like to Saincte Thomas Onions:
Sometimes petite Ruffes of twoo ynches long, with
a cloaſe ſtocking cleane aboue the nocke of his taile: Sometimes
diſguiſing them ſelues after the vſe of Spaine: Sometimes
after the Italian maner, and many times thei imitate
the Frenche faſhion ſo neare, that all their haire is readie to
fall of their heddes.
               Now I am ſure, if any of thē were aſked, why he vſed ſuche
varietie in his apparell, he would aunſwere, becauſe he would
followe the faſhion. Let this then ſuffice likewiſe for mine excuſe,
that my ſelf ſeyng trifles of no accompt, to bee now beſte
in ſeaſon, and ſuche vanities more deſired, then matters of better
purpoſe, and the greateſt parte of our writers, ſtill buſied
with the like. So I haue putte forthe this booke, becauſe I
would followe the faſhion.
               And now freendlie Reader, becauſe I haue entered thus
farre to ſpeake of faſhions: I will conclude with a tale, that
maketh ſomethyng for my purpoſe. I haue reade it ſo long agoe,

bare his loue honeſtlie, lawfullie, yea, and in the waie of
Marriage, the whiche to bryng to paſſe, he tooke ſuche continuall
care, and trauaile in his minde, that he now confeſſed
the fire of Helle to bee but a trifle, in reſpecte of the ſcorchyng
flames of Loue. Sometymes coniecturyng in his minde,
what baſhfulneſſe is founde to be in yong Damſelles in theſe
daies, but eſpecially when a man comes to proffer them loue,
thei are ſo ſhamefaſte, that with a good will, thei would neuer
heare of Marriage, till thei were thirtie yeres old at the leaſt,
and many of theim if it were not for men; I thinke could bee
well contented to lead Apes in Hell: other whiles he remembred
the greedie deſire, that is generallie in Parentes, who
neuer conſent to the Marriyng of their faire daughters, without
ſome greate ioynter: Now the Deuill had no landes, and
therefore to finde the beſte remedie he could: thei ſaie the Deuill
is able to putte vpon hym all maner of ſhapes, ſo he tooke

               The yong wife wonderfullie well contented with theſe
louyng ſpeeches, of her courteous houſebande, deſired of hym
a little pauſe and reſpite: And now commyng to her Mother,
to whom ſhe vnfolded the whole contentes of the premiſes, fittyng
them doune together, to conſider of the matter, after a
greate nomber of conſultations, and as many imaginations
had betwene them, in the ende thei concluded, that her 
                     〈◊〉
                  
ſhould bee for a ſute of apparell of a gallaunt faſhion, but euen
then newlie come vp, and commyng to her houſebande with
this demaunde, thei had their wiſhe preſentlie accompliſhed,
and this ſute of apparell laied by theim, ſo well made and fitted,
as poſſibly could bee deſired. Thus all partes were well
pleaſed, thei continued in good liking for the ſpace of one moneth,
at whiche time an other newe faſhion was then come vp,
aſwell in the attiryng of their heddes, as alſo in the makyng
of their Gounes, Kirtelles, and Stomachers. Miſtreſſe Mildred,
being now quite out of conceipt, for that ſhe had neuer a
Goune to put on her backe, but of a ſtale cut, and the faſhion at
the leaſt of a monethe olde, who would blame the Gentlewoman,
though ſhe tooke it verie greeuouſlie: alas her mind was
ſo farre out of quiet, that her meate almoſte did her no maner
of good. Whiche ſodaine alteration beeyng perceiued by her
houſeband, he began to intreate her, to ſhewe hym the cauſe of
her conceiued greef, the which whē ſhe had reueiled, the good
honeſt deuill her houſband ſaid: well my deare wife, although

               Miſtres Mildred giuyng hym twentie kiſſes for his kind
                  
                     •
                  eſſe,
went again to her mother with theſe ioyfull newes, and

                     •
                  oncludyng as before, thei brought the Deuill, an Inuentorie

                     〈◊〉
                   newe faſhions, beginning with Cappes, Caules, Quaiues
Ruffes, Partlettes, Sleeues, Gounes, 
                     •
                  irtelles, Peticotes,
and there was no Stitche, no Cutte, no Lace, no Garde, nor
no faſhion that was then in vſe, but in this Inuentorie it was
to bee founde, and as before, this bill was no ſoner preſented,
but all thinges were in readineſſe, ſo well fitted and faſhioned
as if the moſte cunningeſt woorkemen in Englande had been
at the makyng. But what ſhould I ſaie? Before an other moneth
was expired, there was a newe inuention, for then came
vp newe faſhions in their Caps, in their Hats, in their Caules
newe faſhioned Shadowes, then came vp Periwigges, Frezelyng,
and Curlyng, then came vp Dublettes, Bombaſting,
and Bolſtering: newe faſhions in their Gounes, 
                     •
                  irtells, and
Peticotes, then thei beganne to weare Crimſm, Carnation,
Greene and Yeallowe Stockynges: To bee ſhort, there was
ſuche alteration in womens apparell, from the topp to the toe
in a moneth, that Miſtres Mildred though her ſelf now again
to be cleane out of faſhion, the remembrance whereof brought
her likewiſe to be quite out of countenaunce, but when ſhe remembred
how ſhe was prohibited, from makyng any further
demaundes, it did ſo gaule her at the harte, that now ſhe beganne
to froune, lumpe, and lowre at her houſebande, whiche
when he perceiued, he ſaied vnto her: why how now my good
Mildred, I feare me thy hedde is troubled againe with newe
faſhions, from whence commeth theſe ſodaine fittes, what is
the matter that 
                     •
                  eedeth ſuche alteration in thy maners, tell
me I praie thee, what is it that doeth offende thee?
               
                  
The poore Gentlewoman not able to ſpeake one worde for
weepyng, at the laſt burſtyng out into theſe tearmes, if (quoth
ſhe) I had made my choiſe of a houſbande worthie of my ſelf▪
I ſhould neuer haue giuen hym cauſe thus to wonder at me▪
nor my ſelf haue had occaſion to complaine for ſuche a trifle,
for that I might haue doen, as other women doe, and haue followed
euery faſhion, and euery newe deuiſe, without 
                     〈◊〉
                  
grudgyng, or reſtraint of my deſire, I ſhould not their ha
                     ••
                  
bin enioyued to ſuch a kind of ſilence, but I might haue made
my houſbande priuie to my wantes, I ſhould not then haue
bin kept like Ione of the Countrie, in a tyre of the old faſhion
deuiſed a moneth agoe.
               While Miſtres Mildred was proceeding in theſe ſpeeches
or ſuche other like, the Deuill her houſbande was ſtroke in
ſuche a dumpe, that not able any longer to indure her talke, he
not onely auoided hymſelf from her preſence, but alſo deuiſed
with ſpeede to flie the Countrie, and commyng to Douer,
thinkyng to croſſe the Seas, findyng no ſhippyng readie, he
altered his courſe and gat hym into Scotlande, neuer ſtaiyng
till he came to Edenbrough, where the Kyng kept his Court,
and now forgettyng all humanitie whiche he had learned before
in Englande, he began againe a freſhe to plaie the Deuil,
and ſo poſſeſſed the King of Scots himſelf, with ſuch ſtrange
and vnaquainted paſſions, that by the cōiecture of Phiſitions,
and other learned men that were then aſſembled together, to
iudge the Kynges diſeaſes, thei all concluded that it muſt needes
bee ſome Feende of Hell, that ſo diſturbde their Prince:
Wherevpon Proclimations were preſently ſent forthe, that
who ſoeuer could giue releef, ſhould haue a thouſand crounes
by the yere, ſo long as he did liue. The deſire of theſe crounes,
cauſed many to attempt the matter, but the furie of the Deuill
was ſuche, that no man could preuaile.
               Now it fortuned that Perſinus, the father of Miſtres Mildred,
at this preſent to bee at Edenbrough, who by conſtraint
of ſome extremitie, was now compelled to practiſe Phiſicke,
wherein he had ſome pretie ſight, but there with all ſo good
ſucceſſe, that who but Perſinus the Engliſhe Phiſition, had al

the name through the whole Realme of Scotlande. The fame
of this Phiſition came to the hearyng of the Kyng, who ſendyng
for Perſinus, began to debate with hym of the ſtraung
                  
                     •
                  eſſe
of his fittes, profferyng large ſommes of money if he
could finde a remedie. To whom Perſinus aunſwered, that it

                     〈◊〉
                   farre his ſkill: the Kyng notwithſtandyng, would not

                     〈◊〉
                   ouer, but intreated Perſinus to take in hande the cure,

                     〈◊〉
                   when he ſtill denaied, did thinke it rather proceeded of
ſtubborneſſe, then for want of experience: wherefore he began
to threaten hym, ſwearyng that if he would not accompliſhe
his requeſt, it ſhould coſt hym his life.
               
                  Perſinus ſeyng hymſelf ſo hardly beſteade, was contented
to crie ſome parte of his cunnyng: and the next daie when the
Kyng was in his fitt, he was brought in to ſee the maner how
it helde hym. Whom the Deuill perceiuing to come in at the
doore, ſpeakyng to Perſinus, he ſaied in this maner.
               My father Perſinus, I am glad I ſee you here, but what
winde hath driuen you hether to this place.
               Why what arte thou (quoth Perſinus) that calleſt me thy
father.
               Marie (quoth the Deuill) I am Balthaſer, that was once
maried to your Daughter, in deede a Deuill of Hell, though
you neuer knewe it before, whom your Daughter weried ſo
muche with her new faſhions, as I had rather be in Hell, then
maried to ſuche a wife.
               And art thou then Balthaſer, (quoth Perſinus) why then I
praie thee good ſonne departe the Kyng of Scots, for he hath
threatned me for thy cauſe, to take awaie my life.
               Marie (quoth Balthaſer) euen ſo I would haue it, it were
ſome parte of aquitaunce, for your Daughters kindneſſe towardes
me.
               
                  Perſinus ſeeyng the diſpoſition of the Deuill, thought it
not good to deale any farther with hym at that preſent, but afterward
when the Kyng was come to hymſelf, he requeſted of
hym but reſpete for one Moneth, and againſt the daie that he
ſhould then take hym in hand again, he deuiſed with the King
that all the Ordnaunce in the Towne might be ſhot of, all the
