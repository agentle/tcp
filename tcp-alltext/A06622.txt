            A pleasant conceited Comoedie,
called Mother Bombie.
            
               Actus primus. Scena prima.
               Memphio. Dromio.
               
                  Memphio.
                  
                     BOY, there are three
thinges that make my
life miserable, a threed
bare purse, a curst wife,
& a foole to my heire.
Dromio. Why then
sir, there are three medicines for these three malaladies:
a pike-staffe to take a purse on the high way,
a holy wand to brush cholar frō my mistres tong,
and a young wench for my yong master: so that as
your Worship being wise begot a foole, so he beeing
a foole may tread out a wise man.
               
               
                  Memp.
                  I but Dromio, these medicines bite hot
on great mischiefs, for so might I haue a rope about
my necke, hornes vpon my head, and in my house
a litter of fooles.
               
               
                  Dro.
                  Then sir you had best let some wise man sit
on your sonne, to hatch him a good wit: they saie,

if rauens sit on hens egs the chickens will be black,
and so forth.
               
               
                  Memp.
                  Why boy, my sonne is out of the shell,
and is growen a pretie cocke.
               
               
                  Drom.
                  Carue him master, & make him a capon,
els all your breed will proue cockescombes.
               
               
                  Memph.
                  I maruell he is such an asse, hee takes it
not of his father.
               
               
                  Dro.
                  He may for anie thing you know.
               
               
                  Mem.
                  Why villain dost thou think me a foole?
               
               
                  Dro.
                  O no sir, neither are you sure that you are
his father.
               
               
                  Memp.
                  Rascall, doest thou imagine thy mistres
naught of her bodie?
               
               
                  Dro.
                  No, but fantasticall of her mind, and it may
be, when this boy was begotten shee thought of a
foole, & so conceiued a foole, your selfe beeing verie
wise, and she surpassing honest.
               
               
                  Mem.
                  It may be, for I haue heard of an Aethiopian,
that thinking of a faire picture, brought forth
a faire ladie, and yet no bastard.
               
               
                  Drom.
                  You are well read sir, your sonne may be
a bastard and yet legitimate, your selfe a cuckold, &
yet my mistres vertuous, all this in conceit.
               
               
                  Mem.
                  Come Dromio, it is my grief to haue such
a sonne that must inherit my lands.
               
               
                  Dro.
                  He needs not sir, Ile beg him for a foole.
               
               
                  Mem.
                  Vile boy, thy yong master?
               
               
                  Dro.
                  Let me haue in a deuice.
               
               
                  Mem.
                  Ile haue thy aduice, and if it fadge, thou
shalt eate, thou shalt sweate, play till thou sleep, and
sleepe till thy bones ake.
               
               
                  
                  Dro.
                  I marie, now you tickle me, I am both hungrie,
gamesome, & sleepie, and all at once, Ile breake
this head against the wal but Ile make it bleed good
matter.
               
               
                  Mem.
                  Then this it is, thou knowest I haue but
one sonne, and he is a foole.
               
               
                  Dro.
                  A monstrous foole.
               
               
                  Memp.
                  A wife and she an arrand scold.
               
               
                  Dro.
                  Ah master I smell your deuice, it will be excellent.
               
               
                  Mem.
                  Thou canst not know it till I tell it.
               
               
                  Dro.
                  I see it through your braines, your haire is
so thin, and your scull so transparant, I may sooner
see it than heare it.
               
               
                  Mem.
                  Then boy hast thou a quicke wit, and I a
slow tongue, but what ist?
               
               
                  Dro.
                  Marie either you would haue your wiues
tong in your sons head, that he might bee a prating
foole, or his braines in hir brain pan, that she might
be a foolish scold.
               
               
                  Mem.
                  Thou dreamst Dromio, there is no such
matter, thou knowest I haue kept him close, so that
my neighbors thinke him to be wise, and her to be
temperate, because they neuer heard them speake.
               
               
                  Dro.
                  Well.
               
               
                  Mem.
                  Thou knowest that Stellio hath a good farme
and a faire daughter, yea so faire, that she is mewed
vp, and onely looketh out at the windows, least she
should by some roisting courtier be stollen away.
               
               
                  Dro.
                  So sir.
               
               
                  Mem.
                  Now if I could compasse a match between
my sonne and Stellios daughter by conference of

vs parents, and without theirs, I should be blessed▪
he coosned, and thou for euer set at libertie.
               
               
                  Dro.
                  A singular conceit.
               
               
                  Mem.
                  Thus much for my sonne. Nowe for my
wife, I would haue this kept from her, else shal I not
be able to keepe my house from smoake, for let it
come to one of her eares, & then wo to both mine:
I would haue her goe to my house into the Countrie
whilest we conclude this, and this once done, I
care not if her tong neuer haue done: these if thou
canst effect, thou shalt make thy master happie.
               
               
                  Dro.
                  Thinke it done, this noddle shall coin such
new deuice as you shall haue your sonne marryed
py to morrow.
               
               
                  Mem.
                  But take heed, that neither the father nor
the maide speak to my sonne, for then his folly will
marre all.
               
               
                  Dro.
                  Lay all the eare on mee, Subleuabo te onere, I
will rid you of a foole.
               
               
                  Mem.
                  Wilt thou rid me for a foole?
               
               
                  Dro.
                  Tush, quarrell not.
               
               
                  Mem.
                  Then for the dowrie, let it bee at least two
hundreth ducats, and after his death the farme.
               
               
                  Dro.
                  What else?
               
               
                  Mem.
                  Then let vs in, that I may furnish thee with
some better counsell, and my sonne with better apparell.
               
               
                  Dro.
                  Let me alone, I lacke but a wagge more to
make of my counsell, and then you shall see an exquisite
coosnage, & the father more foole than the
sonne. But heare you sir, I forgot one thing.
               
               
                  Mem.
                  Whats that?
               
               
                  
                  Dro.
                  
                     Nay, Expellas furca licet vsque recurret.
               
               
                  Mem.
                  Whats the meaning?
               
               
                  Dro.
                  Why though your sons folly bee thrust vp
with a paire of hornes on a forke, yet being naturall
it will haue his course.
               
               
                  Mem.
                  I praie thee no more, but about it.
               
               Exeunt.
            
            
               Act. 2. Sce. 2.
               Stellio. Riscio.
               
                  Stel.
                  
                     Risio, my daughter is passing amiable, but verie
simple.
               
               
                  Ri.
                  You meane a foole sir.
               
               
                  Stel.
                  Faith I implie so much.
               
               
                  Ri.
                  Then I apply it fit: the one shee takes of her
father, the other of her mother, now you may bee
sure she is your owne.
               
               
                  Stel.
                  I haue penned her vp in a chamber, hauing
onely a windowe to looke out, that youthes seeing
her fayre cheekes, may be enamoured before they
heare her fond speech. How likest thou this head?
               
               
                  Ri.
                  There is verie good workmanship in it, but
the matter is but base, if the stuffe had bene as good
as the mold, your daughter had bene as wise as she
is beautifull
               
               
                  Stel.
                  Doest thou thinke she tooke her foolishnes
of mee?
               
               
                  Ri.
                  I, & so cunningly, that she toke it not frō you.
               
               
                  Stel.
                  
                     Well, Quod natura dedit tollere nemo potest.
               
               
                  Ri.
                  A good euidence to proue the fee-simple of
your daughters folly.
               
               
                  Stel.
                  Why?
               
               
                  
                  Ri.
                  It came by nature, and if none can take it awaie,
it is perpetuall.
               
               
                  Stel.
                  Nay Riscio, she is no natural foole, but in this
consisteth her simplicitie, that she thinketh herselfe
selfe subtile in this her rudenesse, that she imagines
she is courtly, in this the ouershooting of her selfe,
that she ouerweeneth of her selfe.
               
               
                  Ri.
                  Well, what followes?
               
               
                  Stel.
                  
                     Risio this is my plot, Memphio hath a pretie
stripling to his sonne, whom with cockring he hath
made wanton, his girdle must be warmde, the ayre
must not breath on him, he must lie a bed til noon,
and yet in his bed breake his fast, that which I doe
to conceale the folly of my daughter, that doth hee
in too much cockering of his sonne. Now Risio how
shall I compasse a match betweene my girle and
his boy?
               
               
                  Ri.
                  Why with a payre of compasses, and bring
them both into the circle, He warrant the'il match
themselues.
               
               
                  Stel.
                  Tush, plot it for me, that neuer speaking one
to another, they be in loue one with another, I like
not solemne woing, it is for courtiers, let countrie
folkes beleeue others reports as much as their own
opinions.
               
               
                  Ri.
                  O then, so it be a match you care not.
               
               
                  Stel.
                  Not I, nor for a match neither, were it not I
thirst after my neighbors farme.
               
               
                  Ri.
                  A verie good nature. Well, if by flat wit I
bring this to passe, whats my rewerd?
               
               
                  Stel.
                  Whatsoeuer thou wilt aske.
               
               
                  Ri.
                  Ile aske no more than by my wit I can get in

the bargaine.
               
               
                  Stel.
                  Then about it.
               
               Exit.
               
                  Ri.
                  If I come not about you neuer trust mee, Ile
seeke out Dromio, the counseller of my conceit.
               
            
            
               Act. 1. Sce. 3.
               Prisius. Sperantus.
               
                  Pris.
                  It is vnneighbourly done to suffer your son
since hee came from schoole to spende his time in
loue, and vnwisely done to let him houer ouer my
daughter, who hath nothing to her dowrie but her
needle, & must proue a Sempster, nor he any thing
to take to but a Grammer, and cannot at the best be
but a schoolemaster.
               
               
                  Spe.
                  
                     Prisius, you bite and whine, wring me on the
withers, and yet winch your selfe, it is you that goe
about to match my girle with my boy, shee beeing
more fit for seames than for marriage, and hee for a
rod than a wife.
               
               
                  Pri.
                  Her birth requires a better bridegrome than
such a groome.
               
               
                  Spe.
                  And his bringing vp another gate marriage
than such a minion.
               
               
                  Pri.
                  Marie gup, I am sure he hath no better bread
than is made of wheat, nor worne siner cloth than
is made of woll, nor learned better manners than
are taught in schooles.
               
               
                  Spe.
                  Nor your minxe had no better grandfather
than a Tailer, who (as I haue heard) was poore and
proud: nor a better father than your selfe, vnlesse

your wife borrowed a better to make her daughter
a Gentlewoman.
               
               
                  Pri.
                  Twit not me with my ancestors, nor my wiues
honestie, if thou doest.
               
               
                  Spe.
                  Hold thy hands still thou hadst best, & yet it
is impossible now I remēber, for thou hast the palsy
               
               
                  Pri.
                  My handes shake so, that wert thou in place
where, I would teach thee to cog.
               
               
                  Spe.
                  Nay, if thou shake thy hands, I warrant thou
canst not teach anie to cog. But neighbour, let not
two olde fooles fall out for two yong wantons.
               
               
                  Pri.
                  Indeed it becōmeth men of our experience
to reason, not raile: to debate the matter, not to
combat it.
               
               
                  Spe.
                  Wel, then this Ile tel thee friendly, I haue almost
these two yeres cast in my head, how I might
match my princockes with Stellios daughter, whom
I haue heard to be verie faire, and know shal be verie
rich, she is his heire, he doats, he is stooping old,
and shortly must die, yet by no meanes, either by
blessing or cursing can I win my sonne to be a woer,
which I know proceeds not of bashfulnesse but
stubbornnesse, for hee knowes his good though I
saie it, he hath wit at wil: as for his personage, I care
not who sees him, I can tell you he is able to make
a Ladies mouth water if she winke not.
               
               
                  Pri.
                  Stay Sperantus, this is like my case, for I haue
bene tampering as long to haue a marriage cōmitted
betweene my wench and Memphios only son,
they saie he is as goodly a youth as one shall see in a
Summers daie, and as neate a stripling as euer went
on neats leather, his father will not let him be forth

of his sight, he is so tender ouer him, he yet lies with
his mother for catching cold. Now my pretie else,
as proud as the day is long, she wil none of him, she
forsooth wil choose her owne husband, made marriages
proue mad marriages, shee will choose with
her eie and like with her heart before she consent
with her tong, neither father nor mother, kith nor
kin shalbe her caruer in a husband, shee will fall too
where she likes best, and thus the chicke scarce out
of the shell cackles as though she had bene troden
with an hundreth cockes, and mother of a thousand
egges.
               
               
                  Spe.
                  Well then this is our best, seeing we knowe
each others minde, to deuise to gouerne our owne
children, for my boy, Ile keepe him to his bookes, &
studie shall make him leaue to loue, Ile breake him
of his will or his bones with a cudgell.
               
               
                  Pri.
                  And Ile no more dandle my daughter, shee
shall prick on a clout till her fingers ake, or Ile cause
her leaue to make my heart ake. But in good time,
though with ill lucke, beholde if they be not both
together, let vs stand close and heare all, so shall we
preuent all.
               
               Enter Candius and Liuia.
               
                  Spe.
                  This happens pat, take heed you cough not
Prisius.
                  
               
               
                  Pri.
                  Tush spit not you, & Ile warrant I my beard
is as good as a handkerchiefe.
               
               
                  Liuia.
                  Sweet Candius, if thy father should see vs
alone, would be not fret? The old man me thinkes
should be full of 
                        〈◊〉
                     .
               
               
                  Cand.
                  Tush, let him fone heart string against
another, he shal neuer trouble the least vaine of my

little finger, the old churle thinkes none wise, vnles
he haue a beard hang dāgling to his wast, when my
face is bedaubed with haire as his, then perchance
my conceit may stumble on his staiednes.
               
               
                  Pri.
                  I, in what booke read you that lesson.
               
               
                  Spe.
                  I know not in what booke hee read it, but I
am sure he was a knaue to learne it.
               
               
                  Can.
                  I beleeue faire Liuia, if your soure fire shuld
see you with your sweet heart, he would not be verie
patient.
               
               
                  Liu.
                  The care is taken, Ile aske him blessing as a
father, but neuer take counsel for an husband, there
is as much oddes between my golden thoughts, &
his leaden aduice, as betweene his siluer haires and
my amber lockes, I know hee will cough for anger
that I yeeld not, but he shall cough mee a foole for
his labour.
               
               
                  Spe.
                  Where pickt your daughter that worke, out
of broad-stitch?
               
               
                  Pri.
                  Out of a flirts sampler, but let vs stay the end,
this is but the beginning, you shall heare two children
well brought vp.
               
               
                  Cand.
                  Parents in these daies are growen pieuish,
they rocke their children in their cradles till they
sleepe, and crosse them about their bridals till their
hearts ake. Marriage among them is become a market,
what will you giue with your daughter? What
Ioynter will you make for your sonne? And many
a match is broken off for a penie more or lesse, as
though they could not afford their children at such
a price, when none should cheapen such ware, but
affection, and none buy it but loue.
               
               
                  
                  Spe.
                  Learnedly and scholerlike.
               
               
                  Liu.
                  In deed our parents take great care to make
vs aske blessing and say grace when as we are lyttle
ones, and growing to yeeres of iudgement they depriue
vs of the greatest blessing, and the most gracius
things to our mindes, the libertie of our minds:
they giue vs pap with a spoon before we can speak,
and when wee speake for that wee loue, pap with a
hatchet: because their fansies beeing growen musty
with hoarie age, therefore nothing can relish in
their thoughtes that sauours of sweet youth: they
studie twentie yeeres together to make vs grow as
straight as a wande, and in the ende by bowing vs
make vs as crooked as a cammocke. For mine owne
part (sweet Candius) they shall pardon me, for I will
measure my loue by min owne iudgement, not my
fathers purse or peeuishnes. Nature hath made me
his child, not his slaue, I hare Memphio and his son
deadly, if I wist he would place his affection by his
fathers appointment.
               
               
                  Pri.
                  Wittily but vnciuily.
               
               
                  Can.
                  Be of that minde still my faire Liuia, let our
fathers lay their purses together, we our harts, I wil
neuer woo where I cannot loue, let Stellio inioy his
daughter. But what haue you wrought here?
               
               
                  Liu.
                  Flowers, fowles, beasts, fishes, trees, plants,
stones, and what not. Among flowers, cowslops &
lillyes for our names Candius and Liuia. Among
fowles, Turtles and Sparrowes, for our truth and
desires. Among beasts, the foxe and the Ermin for
beautie and policie, and among fishes the cockle &
the Tortuse, because of Venus among trees, the

vine wreathing about the elme for our embracings.
Among stones Abestor, which being hot wil
neuer be colde, for our constancies. Among plants,
Time and harts-ease, to note that if we take time we
shall ease our hearts.
               
               
                  Pri.
                  Theres a girle that knowes her lerripoope.

                  What booke is that?
               
               
                  Can.
                  A fine pleasant poet, who entreateth of the
arte of Loue, and of the remedie.
               
               
                  Liu.
                  Is there arte in loue?
               
               
                  Can.
                  A short art & a certain, three rules in 3. lines.
               
               
                  Liu.
                  I praie thee repeat them.
               
               
                  Can.
                  Principio quod amare velis reperire labora,
Proximus huic labor est placidam euor are puellam,
Tertius vt longo tempore ducet amor.
               
               
                  Liu.
                  I am no Latinist Cand. you must conster it.
               
               
                  Can.
                  So I will and pace it too: thou shalt be acquainted
with case, gender, and number. First one
must finde out a mistres, whom before all others he
voweth to serue. Secondly, that he vse al the means
that he may to obtaine her. And the last with deserts,
faith and secrecie to studie to keepe her.
               
               
                  Liu:
                  Whats the remedie?
               
               
                  Can:
                  Death.
               
               
                  Liu:
                  What of all the booke is the conclusion?
               
               
                  Can:
                  
                     This one verse, Non caret essertu quod voluere
duo.
               
               
                  Liu:
                  Whats that?
               
               
                  Can:
                  Where two are agreed, it is impossible but
they must speed.
               
               
                  Liu:
                  Then cannot we misse, therefore giue mee

thy hand Candius.
                  
               
               
                  Pri.
                  Soft Liuia, take mee with you, it is not good
in lawe without witnes.
               
               
                  Spe.
                  And as I remember there must be two witnesses,
God giue you ioy Candius, I was worth the
bidding to dinner, though not worthy to be of the
counsell.
               
               
                  Pri.
                  I thinke this hot loue hath prouided but cold
cheere.
               
               
                  Spe.
                  Tush, in loue is no lacke, but blush not Candius,
you neede not bee ashamed of your cunning,
you haue made loue a booke case, and spent your
time well at schoole, learning to loue by arte, and
hate against nature, but I perceiue, the worser child
the better louer.
               
               
                  Pri.
                  And my minion hath wrought well, where
euery stitch in her sampler is a pricking stitch at my
heart: you take your pleasure on parents, they are
peeuish, fooles, churles, ouergrowen with ignorance,
because ouerworne with age, litle shalt thou
know the case of a father before thy selfe be a mother,
when thou shalt breed thy childe with continuall
paines, and bringing it foorth with deadly
pangs, nurse it with thine owne paps, and nourish it
vp with motherly tendernes, and then finde them
to curse thee with their hearts, when they shoulde
aske blessing on their knees, and the collop of thine
owne bowels to be the torture of thine owne soul,
with teares trickling downe thy checkes, and drops
of bloud falling from thy heart, thou wilt in vttering
of thy minde wish them rather vnborne than
vnnatural, & to haue had their cradles their graues

rather than thy death their bridals. But I will not
dispute what thou shouldst haue done, but correct
what thou hast done, I perceiue sowing is an idle
exercise, and that euerie daie there come more
thoughtes into thine head, than stitches into thy
worke, Ile see whether you can spin a better mind
than you haue stitched, and if I coope you not vp,
then let me be the capon.
               
               
                  Spe.
                  As for you sir boy, in stead of poaring on a
booke, you shall holde the plough, Ile make repentance
reape what wantonnesse hath sowen, but we
are both well serued, the sonnes must bee masters,
the fathers gaffers, what wee get together with a
rake, they cast abroade with a forke, and wee must
wearie our legges to purchase our children armes.
Well, seeing that booking is but idlenesse, Ile see
whether threshing be anie occupation, thy minde
shall stoope to my fortune, or mine shall break the
lawes of nature. How like a micher he standes, as
though he had trewanted from honestie, get thee
in, and for the rest let me alone. In villaine.
               
               
                  Pri.
                  And you pretie minx, that must be fed with
loue vpon sops▪ Ile take an order to cram you with
sorrowes, get you in without looke or reply.
               
               Exeunt Candius, Liuia.
               
                  Spe.
                  Let vs follow, and deale as rigorously with
yours as I will with mine, and you shall see that hot
loue wil wax soone colde, Ile tame the proud boy,
and send him as far from his loue as hee is from his
duetie.
               
               
                  Pri.
                  Let vs about it, and also go on with matching
them to our mindes, it was happie that we preuented

                  He to cosin, & I to coniure, would make such
alterations, that our masters shuld serue themselues,

                  Betweene him and Stellios daughter without

                  And all this.

                  Then are we both driuen to our wits endes,

                  Well, let vs sharpen our accounts, ther's no

                  These old buddles haue such strong purses

a snaphance.
               
               
                  Ris.
                  The olde fashion is best, a purse with a ring
round about it, as a circle to course a knaues hande
from it: but Dromio, two they saie may keep counsell
is one be awaie: but to conuey knauerie, two
are too few, and foure too many.

                  Then this is the verse as I point it, Cum mala

                  Without doubt Risio hath gone beyond himselfe,
in casting beyond the Moone, I feare the boy
be runne mad with studying, for I know hee loued
me so well, that for my fauour hee will venture to
runne out of his wits, and it may be, to quicken his
inuention, hee is gone into this Iuy-bush, a notable
neast for a grape owle, Ile firret him out, yet in the

whats done in the marriages.

must goe for an answere myselfe, I haue tied vp the
louing worme my daughter, and will see whether
fansie can worme fansie out of her head, this green
nosegaie I feare my boy hath smelt to, for if he get
but a penny in his purse, he turnes it sodainly into
Argentum potabile, I must search euery place for
him, for I stand on thornes till I heare what he hath
done.

                  He must needs goe that the deuill driues,
a father, a fiend, that seekes to place affection by appointment,
& to force loue by compulsion, I haue
sworne to woo Sylena, but it shall be so coldly, that
she shall take as small delight in my wordes, as I do
contentment in his commandement, Ile teach him
one schoole tricke in loue. But behold who is that
that commeth out of Stellios house, it should seem
to be Silena by her attire,
Enter Silena.
by her face I am sure it is she, oh faire face, oh louely
countenance! How now Candius, if thou begin
to slip at beautie on a sodaine, thou wilt surfet with
carousing it at the last. Remēber that Liuia is faithfull,
I, and let thine eyes witnesse Silena is amiable,
heere shall I please my father and my selfe, I wyll
learne to be obedient, & come what will, Ile make
away, if shee seeme coy, Ile practise all the arte of
loue; if I her cunning, all the pleasures of loue.
               
               
                  Sile.
                  My name is Silena I care not who knowe it,
so I doo not: my father keeps me close, so he does,
and now I haue stolne out, so I haue, to goe to olde
Mother Bombie to know my fortune, so I wil, for I
haue as fayre a face as euer trode on shoo sole, and

as free a foote as euer lookt with two eyes.
               
               
                  Cand.
                  What, I thinke she is lunatike or foolish?
Thou art a foole Candius, so faire a face cannot bee
the scabbard of a foolish minde, mad she may bee,
for commonly in beautie so rare, there fals passions
extreame, Loue and beautie disdaine a meane, not
therefore because beautie is no vertue, but because
it is happines, and we schollers know that vertue is
not to be praised, but honored. I wil put on my best
grace, sweete wench thy face is louely, thy bodie
comely, & all that the eyes can see inchanting, you
see how vnacquainted I am bold to boord you.

                  Too simple to be naturall: too senslesse

                  Alas poore wench, I see now also thy folly,
a fayre foole is lyke a fresh weed, pleasing leaues

                  Pri.
                  The olde time was a good time, Ale was an
ancient drinke, and accounted of our ancestors autentical,
Gascone wine was liquor for a Lord, Sack
a medicine for the sicke, and I may tell you, he that
had a cup of red wine to his oysters, was hoysted in
the Queenes subsidie booke.
               
               
                  Spe.
                  I but now you see to what loosenes this age
is growen▪ our boies carouse sack like double beere,
and saith that which doth an old man good, can do
a yong man no harme: old men (say they) eat pap,
why shoulde not children drinke sacke, their white
heads haue cosned time out of mind our yōg yeres
               
               
                  
                  Memph:
                  Well, the world is wanton since I knew
it first, our boyes put as much nowe in their bellies
in an houre, as would cloath theyr whole bodies in
a yeere, wee haue paide sor their tipling eight shillinges,
and as I haue hearde, it was as much as
bought Rufus, sometime king of this land, a paire
of hose.
               
               
                  Pri.

                  Nay tis true; they saie, Ale is out of request,
tis hogges porredge, broth for beggers, a caudle for
cunstables, watchmens mouth glew; the better it is
the more like bird lime it is; and neuer makes one
staid but in the stockes.
               
               
                  Memph:

from barley.

                  And I mine, to iudge the difference between
a blacke boule and a filuer goblet.
               
               
                  Stel:
                  And mine shall learne the oddes betweene
a stand and a hogs-head, yet I cannot choose but
laugh to see how my wag aunswered mee, when I
stroke him for drinking sacke.
               
               
                  Pri.
                  Why what sayd he?
               
               
                  Stel.
                  Master, it is the soueraigntest drinke in the
world, and the safest for all times and weathers, if
it thunder, though all the Ale and Beere in the
towne turne, it will be constant; if it lighten, and
that any fire come to it, it is the aptest wine to burn
and the most wholesomest when it is burnt. So
much for Summer. If it freeze, why it is so hot in
operation, that no Ise can congeale it, if it rayne,

why then he that cannot abide the heate of it, may
put in water. So much for winter. And so ranne his
way, but Ile ouertake him.

                  Who woulde thinke that my hoppe on my

sonne, his young master, whom I haue brought vp
at Oxford, and I thinke must learne heere in Kent
at Ashford.

                  They were all in a pleasant vaine, but I
must be gone, and take account of my boyes businesse,
farewell neighbours, God knowes when we
shall meete againe, yet I haue discouered nothing,
my wine hath beene my wittes friende, I longe to

                  I cannot staie, but this good fellowshippe

               Act. 3. Sce. 1.
               Maestius. Serena.
               
                  Maest.
                  Sweet sister, I know not how it commeth
to passe, but I finde in my selfe passions more than
brotherly.
               
               
                  Ser.
                  And I deare brother finde my thoughts intangled
with affections beyonde nature, which so
flame into my distempered head, that I can neither
without danger smother the fire, nor without modestie
disclose my furie.
               
               
                  Maest.
                  Our parents are pore, our loue vnnaturall,
what can then happen to make vs happie?
               
               
                  Ser.
                  Onely to be content with our fathers mean
estate, to comhat against our own intemperate desires,
and yeld to the succes of fortune, who though
she hath framd vs miserable, cannot make vs monstrous.
               
               
                  Maest.
                  It is good counsel faire sister, if the necessitie
of loue could be releeued by counsell, yet this
is our comfort, that these vnnaturall heates haue
stretched themselues no further than thoughts, vnhappie
me that they should stretch so.
               
               
                  Ser.
                  That which nature warranteth laws forbid,
straunge it seemeth in sense, that because thou art
mine, therefore thou must not be mine.
               
               
                  Maest.
                  So it is Serena, the neerer we are in bloud, the
further wee must be from loue, and the greater the
kindred is, the lesse the kindnes must be, so that between
brothers & sisters superstition hath made affection
cold, between strangers custome hath bred
loue exquisite.
               
               
                  
                  Ser.
                  They say there is hard by an old cunning woman,
who can tell fortunes, expound dreames, tell of things
that be lost, and deuine of accidents to come, she is called
the good woman, who yet neuer did hurt.
               
               
                  Maest.
                  Nor anie good I thinke Serena, yet to satisfie
thy minde we will see what she can saie.
               
               
                  Ser.
                  Good brother let vs.

                  She might haue said the beldam, for her face
and yeeres, and attire.
               
               
                  Ser.
                  Good mother tell vs, if by your cunning you
can, what shall become of my brother and me.
               
               
                  Bom.
                  Let me see your hands, and looke on me stedfastly
with your eyes. You shall be married to morow
hand in hand, by the lawes of good nature & the land,
your parents shall be glad, & giue you their lande, you
shal each of you displace a foole, & both together must
releeue a foole. If this be not true call me olde foole.
               
               
                  Maest.
                  This is my sister, marrie we cannot: our parents
are poore and haue no land to giue vs, each of vs
is a foole to come for counsell to such an olde foole.
               
               
                  Ser.
                  These doggrell rimes and obscure words, comming
out of the mouth of such a weather-beatē witch,
are thought diuinations of some holy spirite, being but
dreames of decayed braines▪ for mine owne parte, I
would thou mightest sit on that stoole till he & I martie

                  I saie Mother Bombie neuer speakes but once,
and yet neuer spake vntruth once.
               
               
                  Ser.
                  Come brother, let vs to our poore home, this is
our comfort, to bewraie our passions, since we cannot
inioy our loue.
               
               
                  
                  Maest.
                  Content sweet sister, and learne of me hereafter,
that these olde sawes of such olde hags, are but false
fires to leade one out of a plaine path into a deepe pit.

                     Ingenium quondam fuerat pretiotius auro, the time
was wherein wit would worke like waxe, and crock vp
golde like honnie.
               
               
                  Ri.
                  
                     At nunc barbarie est grandis habere nihil, but nowe
wit and honestie buy nothing in the market.
               
               
                  Dro.
                  What Risio, how spedst thou after thy potting?
               
               
                  Ri.
                  Nay, my master rong all in the tauerne, & thrust
all out in the house. But how spedst thou?
               
               
                  Dro.
                  
                     I, it were a dayes worke to discourse it, he spake
nothing but sentences, but they were vengible long
ones, for when one word was out, hee made pause of a
quarter long till he spake another.
               
               
                  Ri.
                  Why what did he in all that time?
               
               
                  Dro.
                  Breake interiections lyke winde, as eho, ho, to.
               
               
                  Ri.
                  And what thou?
               
               
                  Dro.
                  Aunswere him in his owne language, as euax,
vah, hui.
                  
               
               
                  Ri.
                  These were coniunctions rather than interiections.
But what of the plot?
               
               
                  Dro.
                  As we concluded I tolde him that I vnderstood
that Silena was verie wise, and could sing exceedingly,
that my deuise was, seeing Accius his sonne a proper
youth, & could also sing sweetly, that he should come
in the nicke when she was singing and answere her.
               
               
                  Ri.
                  Excellent.
               
               
                  Dro.
                  Then hee asked how it should be deuised that
she might come abroade, I tolde that was cast alreadie

by my meanes, then the song beeing ended, and they
seeing one another, noting the apparell, and marking
the personages, he should call in his sonne for feare he
should ouer-reach his speech.
               
               
                  Ri.
                  Very good.
               
               
                  Dro.
                  Then that I had gotten a young Gentleman
that resembled his sonne in yeeres and fauour, that hauing
Accius apparell should court Silena, whome shee
finding wise, would after that by small intreatie be won
without mo wordes, & so the marriage clapt vp by this
cosnage, and his sonne neuer speake word for himselfe.
               
               
                  Ri.
                  Thou boy, so haue I done in euerie point, for the
song, the calling her in, & the hoping that another shall
woo Accius, and his daughter wed him, I told him this
wooing should be to night, and they early marryed in
the morning, without anie wordes sauing to saie after
the Priest.
               
               
                  Dro.
                  All this fodges well; now if Halfpenie and Luceo
haue playde theyr partes, wee shall haue exccellent
sporte, and here they come. Howe wrought the wine
my lads?
               
               Enter Halfpenie, Luceo.
               
                  Half.
                  How? like wine, for my bodie being the rundlet,
and my mouth the vent, it wrought two daies ouer,
till I had thought the hoopes of my head woulde haue
flowen asunder.
               
               
                  Lu.
                  The best was, our masters were as well whitled
as we, for yet they lie by it.
               
               
                  Ri.
                  The better for vs, we dyd but a little parboile our
liuers, they haue sod theyrs in sacke these fortie yeeres.
               
               
                  Hal.
                  That makes them spit white broth as they doo.
But to the purpose. Candius and Liuia will send their
attires, you must send the apparell of Accius and Silena,
they wonder wherefore, but commit the matter to
our quadrapertit wit.

                  If you keepe promise to marrie them by your
deuice, and their parents consent, you shall haue tenne
pounds a peece for your paines.
               
               
                  Dro.
                  If wee doo it not wee are vndone, for we haue
broacht a cosnage alreadie, and my master hath the tap
in his hand, that it must needs runne out, let thē he ruld
and bring hether their apparell, and we wil determine,
the rest commit to our intricate considerations, depart.
               
               Exeunt Halfepenie, Luceo. Enter Accius and Silena.

                  Here comes Accius tuning his pipes, I perceiue

                  And here comes Silena with her wit of proofe▪
marie it will scarse holde out question shot, let vs in to
instruct our masters in the que.

                  Come let vs be iogging, but wert not a world

                  That shall be hereafter to make vs sport, but our

                  Dreames my sonne haue their weight, though

Say on.

                  In the dawning of the day, for about that time
by my starting out of my sleepe I found it to bee, mee
thought I sawe a stately peece of beefe, with a cape
cloke of cabidge, imbrodered with pepper, hauing two
honorable pages with hats of mustard on their heades,
himselfe in greate pompe sitting vppon a cushion
of white Brewish, linde with browne Breade,

me thought being poudred he was much trobled with
the salt rume, & therfore there stood by him two great
flagons of sacke and beere, the one to drie vp his rume,
the other to quench his cholar, I as one enuying his
ambition, hungring and thirsting after his honor, began
to pull his cushiō frō vnder him, hoping by that means
to giue him a fall, & with putting out my hand awakt, &
found nothing in all this dreame about me but the salt
rume.
               
               
                  Dro.
                  A dreame for a butcher.

                  Soft let me end it, then I slumbred againe, & me
thought there came in a leg of mutton.

                  Thou foole how could it come in, vnlesse it had
bin a leg, me thought his hose were cut & drawen out
with parsly, I thrust my hand into my pocket for a knife
thinking to hoxe him, and so awakt.

                  Well, take this for answere, though the dream
be fantasticall, they that in the morning sleep dream of
eating, are in danger of sicknesse, or of beating, or shall
heare of a wedding fresh a beating.

                  Nay then let me come in with a dreame, short
but sweet, that my mouth waters euer since I wakt: Me
thought there sate vpon a shelfe three damaske prunes
in veluet caps and prest satten gownes like indges, and
that there were a whole handfull of curants to be araigned
of a riot, because they clūged together in such clusters,
twelue raisons of the sunne were impannelled in
a Iewry, and as a leafe of whole mase which was bailief
was carrying the quest to consult, me thought ther came
an angrie cooke, and gelded the Iewry of theyr stones,

and swept both iudges, iurers, rebels and bailiefe into
a porredge pot, whereat I being melancholy, fetcht a
deepe sigh, that wakt my selfe and my bed fellow.

                  This was deuisd not dreamt, and the more foolish
being no dreame, for that dreames excuse the fantasticalnesse.

                  Then aske my bed-felow, you know him, who
dreamt that night that the king of diamonds was sicke.

                  But thy yeeres and humours pretie child, are
subiect to such fansies, which the more vnsensible they

dream is easie. To children this is giuen from the Gods
to dream of milke, fruit, babies and rods, they betoken
nothing but that wantons must haue rods.

                  Wherefore came you hether Silena without

                  Si.
                  Because I dyd, and I am heere because I am.

                  Poore wench, thy wit is improued to the vttermost.
               
               
                  Half.
                  I, tis an hard matter to haue a wit of the olde

                  Memo.
                  Dromio tolde mee that one should meete
Stellios daughter, and courte her in person of my
sonne.
               
               
                  Stel.
                  Risio tolde me one shoulde meete Memphios

                  Mem.
                  But alas I see that my sonne hath met wyth
Silena himselfe, and bewraid his folly.
               
               
                  Stel.
                  But I see my daughter hath pratled with Accius,
and discouered her simplicitie.
               
               
                  Lin.
                  A braue crie to heare the two olde mules weep

                  Mem.
                  Accius how lykest thou Silena.

                  Truly his talke is very personable.

                  But why diddest thou tell mee it was Prisius
sonne?
               
               
                  Hal.
                  Because I thought thee a foole, to aske who thine

                  Lin.
                  And so sir for your daughter, education hath

                  Mem.
                  Alas theyr ioyntes are not yet tied, they are
not yet come to yeeres and discretion.

                  Father, if my handes bee tyed shall I growe

                  Sil.
                  You may take your pleasure of my tongue, for
it is no mans wife.

                  Come in Accius.

                  As for Dromio.

                  Asse for you all foure,

                  Dro.
                  How goes the worlde, now we haue made all
sure, Candius and Liuia are maryed, their fathers consenting,
yet not knowing.
               
               
                  Lin.
                  We haue flat mard all, Accius and Silena courted
one another, their fathers toke them napping, both
are ashamd, and you both shall be swingd.
               
               
                  Ri.
                  Tush, let vs alone, we will perswade them that all
fals out for the best, for if vnderhande this match had
bene concluded, they both had ben coosned, and now
seeing they finde both to bee fooles, they may be both
better aduised. But why is Halfepenle so sad?
               
               Enter Hackneyman, Sergeant.
               
                  Halfepenie.
                  Because I am sure I shall neuer bee a
pennie.
               
               
                  Ri.
                  Rather praie there be no fall of monie, for thou
wilt then go for a que.
               
               
                  Dro.
                  But did not the two fooles currantly court one
another.
               
               
                  Lin.
                  Verie good wordes fitly applyed, brought in

in the nicke.
               
               
                  Serg.
                  I arest you.
               
               
                  Dro.
                  Me sir, why then didst not bring a stoole wyth
thee, that I might sit downe?
               
               
                  Hack.
                  He arests you at my suite for a horse.
               
               
                  Ri.
                  The more Asse hee, if hee had arested a mare in
stead of an horse, it had bin but a slight ouersight, but
to arest a man that hath no lykenesse of a horse, is flatte
lunasie or alecie.
               
               
                  Hack▪
                  
                  Tush, I hired him a horse.
               
               
                  Dro.
                  I sweare then he was well ridden.
               
               
                  Hack.
                  I thinke in two daies he was neuer baited.
               
               
                  Half.
                  Why was it a beare thou ridst on?
               
               
                  Hack▪
                  
                  I meane he neuer gaue him bait.
               
               
                  Lin.
                  Why he tooke him for no fish.
               
               
                  Hack.
                  
                     I mistake none of you when I take you for
fooles, I say thou neuer gauest my horse meate.
               
               
                  Dro.
                  Yes, in foure and fortie houres I am sure he had
a bottle of hay as big as his belly.
               
               
                  Serg.
                  Nothing else, thou shouldest haue giuen him
prouender.
               
               
                  Ri.
                  Why he neuer askt for anie.
               
               
                  Hack.
                  Why, doest thou thinke an horse can speake?
               
               
                  Dro.
                  No, for I spurd him till my heeles akt, and hee
sayd neuer a word.
               
               
                  Hack.
                  Well, thou shalt paie sweetly for spoiling him,
it was as lustie a nag as anie in Rochester, and one that
would stand vpon no ground.
               
               
                  Dro.
                  Then is he as good as euer he was, Ile warrant,
heele do nothing but lie downe.
               
               
                  Hack.
                  I lent him thee gently.
               
               
                  Dro.
                  And I restored him so gently, that hee neither
would cry wyhie nor wag the taile.
               
               
                  
                  Hack.
                  But why didst thou boare him thorough the
eares?
               
               
                  Lin.
                  It may be he was set on the pillorie, because hee
had not a true pace.
               
               
                  Half.
                  No, it was for tyring.
               
               
                  Hack.
                  He would neuer tire, it may be he would be so
wearie he would go no further, or so.
               
               
                  Dro.
                  Yes he was a notable horse for seruice, he wold
tyre and retire.
               
               
                  Hack.
                  Doe you thinke Ile be iested out of my horse,
Sergeant wreake thy office on him.
               
               
                  Ri.
                  Nay stay, let him be baild.
               
               
                  Hack.
                  So he shall when I make him a bargen.
               
               
                  Dro.
                  It was a verie good horse I must needs confesse,
and now hearken to his qualities, and haue patience to
heare them since I must paie for him: He would stumble
three houres in one mile, I had thought I had rode
vpon addeces betweene this and Canterburie: if one
gaue him water, why he would lie downe & bath himselfe
lyke a hauke: if one ranne him, he woulde simper
and mump, as though he had gone a wooing to a malt
mare at Rochester: hee trotted before and ambled behinde,
and was so obedient, that he would doo dutie euerie
minute on his knees, as though euerie stone had
bin his father.
               
               
                  Hack
                  
                     I am sure he had no diseases.
               
               
                  Dro.
                  A little rume or pose, hee lackt nothing but an
handkercher.
               
               
                  Serg.
                  Come, what a tale of a horse haue we here, I can
not stay, thou must with me to prison.
               
               
                  Ri.
                  If thou be a good fellow Hacknyman, take all our
foure bondes for the paiment, thou knowest wee are
towne borne children, and wil not shrinke the citie for

                  Half.
                  Ile enter into a statute Marchant to see it aunswered.
But if thou wilt haue bondes, thou shalt haue a
bushell full.
               
               
                  Hack.
                  Alas poort Ant, thou bound in a statute marchant:
a browne threed will bind thee fast inough: but
if you will be content all foure ioyntly to enter into a

                  Dro.
                  Yes Ile warrant they will, How say you?

                  Ri.
                  A scriueners shop hangs to Sergeants mase, like
a burre to a freese coate.

                  You must take a note of a bond.

                  Agreed.

                  Now if our wits be not in the waine, our knauery

                  I sir, and more than that, fooles are not wise: a

                     I had at that time two children of mine owne,
and being poore, thought it better to change them than
kill them, I imagined if by deuice I coulde thrust my
children into your houses, they should be wel brought
vp in their youth, and wisely prouided for in their age,

                     
                     
nature wrought with me, and when they were weaned
I sent home mine in sted of yours, which hetherto you
haue kept tenderly as yours: growing in yeres I founde
the children I kept at home to loue dearely, at first lyke
brother and sister, which I reioyced at, but at length too
forward in affection, which although inwardly I could
not mislike, yet openly I seemed to disallowe: they increased
in their louing humours, I ceased not to chastise
them for theyr loose demeanors, at last it came to
my eares, that my sonne that was out with Memphio
was a foole, that my daughter with Stellio was also vnwise,
and yet beeing brother and sister, there was a
match in hammering betwixt them.

                  My verie bowels earned within me, that I shuld
be author of such vilde incest, an hinderance to lawfull

                  This triall cannot faile, your sonne Memphio

Stellio hath on her wrist a moale, which I counterfeted

you will pardon me, as I haue pittied them.
