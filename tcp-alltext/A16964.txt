            TO THE MOST HIGH
AND MIGHTIE PRINCE
ELISABET, BY THE GRACE
OF GOD, QVEENE OF
Englande, France, and
Irelande, defender
of the fayth.
&c.
            
               THE whole Booke of GOD (moſt
gratious Soueraigne) hath ſo great
an harmony, that euery part of it
may be knowen to breath from one
Spirite. Al ſoundeth the ſame poynt:
that by CHRIST the ſonne eternall,
we are made heyres of lyfe:
whom they that knowe not, abide
alwayes in wrath. Prophecyes in
euery age, the firſt larger, the later narrower, all briefly tolde,
all for euent fully recorded: theſe ſhewe the conſtancy of this
trueth. The lyke reuolutions are of Abraham, Iacob and his
children togeather, of Sems houſe: & againe to Iapheths ſonnes,
and all families: wherein the former be ſtampes of the later: ſo
that in one ſpeach, an other thyng alſo is ſpoken. Theſe ſhew
the eye of IEHOVAH, and his ſpirite. The kinredes, places,
and tymes, the lyghtes of narrations, are regiſtred ſo profitably:
that it ſhoulde be a blaſphemy to affirme any one to be idle.
Our LORD his Fathers are recorded from Adam, by Dauid
and Nathan, to his Grandfather Ely: likewiſe they, after whom
he is heyre to the kingdome of Dauid, Salomons lyne ſo long
as it continued: and afterwardes they who from Nathan were
heyres to Salomons houſe. So other Families, who came all of
one, as from them all come: they by Moſes and the Prophetes
be plentifully expreſſed. In like ſort the places of their dwellinges
are cleerely taught. The courſe of time is moſt certaynely obſerued:
euen to the fulnes, the yeere of ſaluation, wherein our
Lorde dyed. Of which time the very houre was foretolde by an

Angell, not ſeauen yeeres before, but ſeauentie tymes ſeauen
yeeres. Dan 9. 24. To this all, other Ebrewes and prophane
Grekes, beare witneſſe ſtrongly agaynſt them ſelues. Theſe
helpes be ſtarres in the Story. The frame of all this, with
coupling of ioyntes and proportion of body, will much allure to
ſtudy, when it is ſeene how about one worke all Families, Countries,
and Ages, buylde or pull downe: and finde the kindnes or
ſeueritie of GOD. For this worke I endeuored, to call auncient
Ebrewes and Grekes, to further the buylding of iuſtice and
peace, to come from Salem and Athens, to theſe endes of the
earth, the poſſeſſion of Chriſte: to ſpeake in Englande the
tongue of Eber and Iauan. This my paynes, I humbly preſent
to your Maiestie.

            To the Reader.
            
               FOR the better vnderſtanding of
DANIEL, who mentioneth large
Kingdoms, and pictureth them: this
Table of the North part will giue ſome light:
which ſheweth where NOE his ſonnes dwelt,
by the notes which you ſee at them. Thoſe Families
giue names to great Realmes, and are
found in Greeke Heathen writers: placed of
them as in this Table. The Kings which DANIEL
ſpeaketh of are ioyned to their pictures.
A ſhort Chronicle is added: but the breuitie
will require diligence. A. B. C. D, printed in
the Pictures, are expounded ouer the Beare,
and placed in the Chronicle ouer the tree.

            The Preface, ſhewyng the ſumme of the Booke,
directions to the Reader, and the olde reading
of the Law and the Prophetes.
            THE holy writers haue a perfect conſent,The ſumme of the Scripture. Iohn. 17. in their doctrine of
lyfe eternall: which as from one mouth teach, how that ſtandeth
in knowing the true GOD, who is but one; and the ſending
of IESVS CHRIST. All Families were hereby to looke for
grace, in all Countries and Ages. Some ſpeciall the holy Writers
do mention,The olde vvorlde, & the vvorlde novv. for the olde worlde, and the worlde now. Ten of the fyrſt are
Fathers, not onely to our LORD, but to all Nations. They were al faythfull,
and ſhoulde mooue their Chyldren to beare in their breſtes VRIM
and THVMMIM, Fayth and Loue. They had Abel an enſample of being
faythful vnto death for Chriſt, to fynde an eternall crowne of life. Cain and
his houſe warned them of their corruption, taken from Parentes, that they
ſhoulde looke for regeneration.Iob. 22, 16. 1. Pet. 3, 19. The deſtruction of the men that delyted
in Caines wayes, whoſe bodyes wrinkled by the deluge, whoſe ſpirites are

               uſt kingly anger. Of this olde Worlde, the Writers olde and new,
teach the ſame. Their places are lytle mentioned: butOur Fathers ages. The beginning of Geneſis is fitted to the capacitie of chyldren. our Fathers ages
are wonderfully layde downe by the heauenly Father, teachyng vs as babes
be taught. Thriſe they are reckoned: how olde they were when they begate
their ſonne: how long they lyued after: and how much thoſe two
numbers make. This ſheweth that the Story is penned for the ſimple and
chyldren. The ſundry compariſons wyll occupy the wyſeſt. The olde Families
of the worlde now, are ſet foorth ſufficiently.

none knoweth but hymApo. 19, 12. felfe.Gen. 9. Babel.
                Vnto Sem and his bleſſing al his Families,
Iapheths and Chams were to looke: they ſoone turned aſyde. For, buyldyng
BABEL to make them ſelues a Shem or name, deſpiſing SEM, they founde
a Shame. Their tongues became ſeauentie of one: their dwellynges were
parted accordyngly: their whole ſtate was a Confuſion, and they periſhed
for euer, that repayred not to Sems Tentes. The fyrſt Families Moſes nameth,

                as to Tyrus Eze. 27. or by their Warres. The Heathen
kept ſtyll a memory of theſe fyrſt poyntes, but full of fables. Coeum
and Iapet, they beare in mynde, whom they call the ſonnes of the earth:
Sem they forgate, and all aboue. The Families ſcattered from Babel, left
their names vpon their Countries, which yet abyde in Greke writers.
Their Warres generall agaynſt the faythfull, Moſes prophecyed, vnder
Aſſur, and Cittim. The Prophetes and Apoſtles recorde what fell out.
Cities here, chiefly two for name are to be marked: the low IERVSALEM,
(which the faythfull ſtyl helde, or looked to holde, vntyl the LORD came)
and the high IERVSALEM buylt by the GOSPEL euery where,
which Cittim or Italy, that deſtroyed the low, ſhoulde labour alwayes to
beſiege, tyll GOD ſendes his enemies a finall deſtruction. The courſe of
times with the Lord his nation was truely kept of the faythfull and faythleſſe.
From the creation to Abrahams promiſe: thence to the comming from
Egypt, to the foundation of Salomons Temple, to the Captiuitie & burning
of the Temple, to the returne to buylde it:The generatie is in Math,

                  . and thence to the death of our
Lord. For euery partition of theſe tymes, auncient conſent of Hebrevves and
Grekes may be brought. I wyll labour to ſet foorth all theſe poyntes brefly,
from the beginning, folowing the order of tyme meaſured by Stories of our
Lord his kinred. The places of auncient dwellinges ſhalbe ioyned in one
Map, of the north part, when Chams houſe, Sems, and Iapheths, all three in
Daniel fight with the auncient kingdomes agaynſt the bleſſed of Sem and

kingdome of Chriſt. That Mappe was to be larger in breadeth then the
quantitie of this Booke.One Mappe vvas to be made of the oldeſt names: & an other vvith later names of dvve

                  lers. The Romanes are not in the Image Dan. 2. or beaſt. Da. 7. In it Pictures are grauen, onely of the tyrannous
kingdomes that Daniel ſpeaketh of, who are conſumed by the byrth of our
Lord, whereof the Romanes are no part. For all the Image, and fourth Beaſt
was to periſh before the incarnation of Chriſt. Ievves do conclude agaynſt
vs, againſt trueth, and their owne ſaluation vpon that our errour. Doubtles
Rome in the ende reuiueth their impietie, folowyng their manners very
neare: wherby many haue thought Daniels Prophecy to blame the Romanes.
For playnnes and diſtinction herein, I wyll in a Mappe of an other quantity
ſet downe Rome, and ſome other later names of Countries, with ſome
ancient, as the ſtory ſhal require: and compare alſo by moſt liuely Pictures
out of Scripture, the Romans with Daniels Kingdomes. This whole Vew
I call A CONCENT OF SCRIPTVRE, becauſe it would ſhewe
that. Through the booke are other Titles touching time & perſon, for the
preſent matter. And wheras I often compare briefly, later writers with former:
to ſhew the Reader how he him ſelfe may do that more at large: I lay
downe fyrſt in this Preface a table of the Ievves, ſhewing how they read
the Prophetes. Phariſees they are at this day, who keepe a recorde of this:
and of the Phariſees of olde,Math. 23, 2. for this much the Lord gaue a teſtimonie that
they ſate in the Chayre of Moſes. Elias in Thiſhi in the worde PETARAH,
recordeth this occaſion, to haue been the beginning of Petaroth: that
when Antiochus Epiphanes forbade to reade MOSES law (Iſaac ben Arama. fol 2 b which was the parted
into ſo manyThoſe ſections they call Petaroth expoſitions. Directions for the Reader. Sections, as be Sabbothes in an yeere.) In ſteade of Moſes
they choſe a part of ſome Prophet lyke vnto it: which cuſtome of readyng
they kept ſtyll, after their libertie reſtored to vſe Moſes and his ceremonies
freely. Before you come to that Table, I wyll here geue direction for the
reading of this Booke, touching the two Tables conteynyng the Fathers
ages, and certayne other poyntes. The number vnder the Father ſheweth
what his age was when the Sonne ſet in that lyne was borne. The other
numbers ſhew his age at the Nephewes byrth ouer agaynſt it: or at the
iſſue of the matter, noted in that lyne. Afterwardes you haue ſundry tytles
of their tymes parted: as Promiſe, Egypt, Temple, Diuiſion, Captiuitie,
Seauens, whereupon the chiefe knottes ſtande. Alſo the tymes are noted
by our Lordes byrth,Manifeſt faultes as Luke for Mat. Aſa for Achaz, and ſuch, many the Readers gentlens muſt amende. by the age of the Worlde, and ſundry perticuler men,
which the Reader may know in markyng what man famous in Story is
agaynſt the fyrſt number. Moreouer, touchyng the Columne, vnderſtande
that you ſhalbe often to marke by the matter, that the ſayinges depend not
vpon the next aboue them, but vpon thoſe that be on the other Columne
oueragaynſt them. A marke you haue to note an vncertaynetie in the
tyme of ſome Stories, that touch not Chronicle: this is the forme of it. ‡ as in Hezron: but there the Corrector was deceyued, who placed his byrth
neare Ioſephes death, though he was borne before Iacob came to Egypt.
Other notes touchyng tymes, two of one kynde ſhewe, eyther that the
Narration is dryuen from the due tyme: and ſhoulde looke to the marke
of the ſame forme: or compareth one Kinges reigne with an others, as you
oft ſhall fynde in Iudah & Iſrael. Teſtimonies I cite ſhort: and in one clauſe
drawen from ſundry, I name but one Author, when about that place I had
named ſome other, for moſt of the matter there layde downe. The common
Latine tranſlation, whoſe ſoeuer it is, I named it as the Title goeth, Ierom.
Abbreuiations chiefly be theſe. b. for borne, d. for dyeth, y. for yeeres.
Once faulty C. for Ch. Chriſtes. For other names, Antiochus Epimanes,
and Epiphanes, Appian Archelaus, Artaxact, Athenaeus, Carthuſianus, Clemens
Alexandrinus in Stromatibus, Cedrenus, Dio. for Dioniſius, Hal
                     •
                  carnaſſeus, Diodorus
Siculus, Hyſtaſpis, Elias Leuita, Epiphanius, Euſebius, Florus, Herodotus, Homer,
Iliades Horace, Ierome, Ioſephus, Ireneus, Iuſtin the hiſtoriographer, Iuuenal,

Maſſecheth, once faulty for Halacoth in Maymony, Nazianzenus, Pauſanias, Plato,
Plutarch, Polybius, Ptolomy in Almageſto, Rabbi Abraham, Sadaias, Strabo, Thucidides,
Tully, Valerius maximus, Virgil, theſe be the moſt names, noted by abbreuiations:
other wordes ſhortly named, by the matter may be geſſed at,
or be ſo common, that euery one knoweth them.
            Now I wyll returne to ſpeake of the ancient maner of readyng Moſes
and the Prophetes. S. Iames ſheweth Actes 15, 21. that Moſes was of olde
tyme reade in the Synagogue in euery Citie euery Sabbath, Maymony writeth
of that in Volume I. Birchath Cohenim from Cha. 12. that Moſes ordeyned
that cuſtome: and that Ezra renued it after the returne: and that in his
tyme,The Rabbines cōmonly make Ezra the autour of the Petarothes diſtinctions: not agreeing vvith Elias Leuita.
                (long before Antioch Epiphanes) Lectiones of the Prophetes were by
him choſen out, agreeable in number and matter to the Lectiones in Moſes.
They beganin the Feaſt of Tabernacles, and in a yeere finiſhed all. After
the readyng of the Law and the Prophetes, they that woulde, hauing leaue
of the ruler of the Synagoge, ſpake vpon thoſe Scriptures. That we ſee was
reteyned Act. 13, 15. I haue ſet downe their Sectiones, and Lectiones, as
they part Moſes, and haue put forth their Petaroth at Venice by Bombergius
in one Booke.

Citie: to conſume wickednes, and to abolyſh ſinnes, and to make reconciliation for

            A Concent of Scripture.
            
               THe heauenly Concent of holy Wryters, who
haue penned for vs the booke of Trueth, is
needefull to be knowen for to ſtrengthen our
Fayth, that we may ſee a conſtant agreement
in ſeuerall ages,Ebr. 1, 1. for matters often tolde in diuers
partes and maner. Touchyng that, I labour
in this Booke to lay downe certayne
principall heades drawen through the whole
body of Scripture. The beginnyng ought to
be from hym who is A and 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ,Apoc. 1, 8. the beginnyng
and the ende: who filleth all with his goodnes. Thereof this is a
true ſaying, and founde intertaynement of all the fayth full that GOD
is one, and there is none but he. Of this, that is grauen on the Gate of
that fyrſt and great Commaundement:Deut 6, 4. Mark. 12, 29. 
               Heare ISRAFL, IEHOVAH,
our GOD IEHOVAH, is one. Whom if we loue with all
our hart, mynde, ſoule, and ſtrength: and holde them happy whoſe
Pſal. 33, 12. God IEHOVAH is, we muſt learne to know him aright. The name
IEHOVAH importeth BEING, which the Eternal ſayth is his name.
1. Iohn. 5, 7. Vnder this name and nature, there be three, the Father, the Worde,
and the holy Ghoſt, and theſe three are one. The WORDE is the
Sonne, and he is

The holy Ghoſt is

                IEHOVAH, as Paule expoundeth the ſame text
of Eſay, Acte. 28, 25. This name is opened thus:

are of the ſame force. Though mens blynde hartes can not thus know
God: The Scriptures are manifeſt, that teach the Trinitie, and the holy
Tongues of all ages ſo ſpake of God. Moſt playnely is that ſhewed
in the beginnyng & ende of our Lord his preachyng. Mat. 3 1. & 28, 19.
For that purpoſe God geueth hym ſelfe a named ELOHIM: which is

which as Prophane men ſpeake it, by frame of language ſoundeth
GODDES. God woulde neuer ſo ſpeake of hym ſelfe, vnleſſe he
would haue vs to conſider thereby the diuine perſons. For the forme
were dangerous, if neceſſitie required not knowledge of diſtinct diuine
perſons. The enemies graunt a myſtery in that forme, with attributes
plurall: Aben Ezra vpon Pſal. 11. who alſo citeth R. Iaphath, there.
            This name hath alſo a forme ſingular

                EL.
Theſe formes ſingular are fit to teach, of the vnitie of Godhead: and
lykewyſe the other when the attributes ſpeake of one, as ELOHIM,
(GOD) he created. But to manifeſt diſtinct perſons often do the

               TZVRI SHADDAI, My rocke is God. The Heathen
of olde heard of theſe names, and turned them to ſundry Goddes.
But Iſrael did not ſo. All faythfull know that GOD is one, and the

perſons three:Ebr. 11, 6. and that he regardeth all them, that feeke him in ſpir

and trueth: who is a ſpirite eternal, infinite, holy, iuſt, and mercifull.
Vnſearchable are his iudgementes:Iohn. 4, 24. Rom. 11, 33. Deut. 29, 29. Epheſ. 2, 4. Act. 15, 18. Exo. 20. but the open thynges are for vs.
GOD hath choſen vs in CHRIST, before the worlde was made: and
of eternitie knew all his owne workes. In ſixe dayes God made all
creatures, Man laſt, and gaue them a commaundement: which how
ſoone they brake Moſes turneth to tell after mention of the Sabbath.
The Lord reſted the ſeauenth day from creatyng, and appoynted that
day for holy reſt: which the Fathers obſerued before Moſes.
            
            Now the man and his wyfe were both naked, & were not aſhamed.
                  Ramban vpon Gen. 26 fol. 46. & Abenezra vpon. Exo. 20. Pſal. 91, 11. Iohn. 8, 44. 1. Iohn. 3, 44. 2. Pet 2, 4. Iud 6. Epheſ. 2, 1.
Ouer them God gaue his Angels charge: but ſome Angels ſtoode not
in the trueth, nor kept their ſtandyng, but fell as Starre
                  •
                from heauen,
and became an enemious company, and ſtaunderers of God. In Ebrew
Satan, & in the Grake Deuels. Of beaſtes the Serpent was ſubtileſt:
into whom Satan entred: ſpake to the woman agaynſt God, and his
commaundement: perſwaded her, who drew the man alſo to breake
the commandement. Then they both became dead in ſinne. So from
the beginning, as ſone as man was, Satan was a lyer and a murtherer:
and therefore marueyle not that the wrath of God is ſo vehement vppon
ADAM through al his generatiō:, becauſe quickly ſinne was committed
to the extremitie. The circumſtaunces ſhew the ſpedines of it.
Satan woulde omit no tyme: the woman if ſhe had ben practiſed better
woulde not ſo ſone haue erred: their ſpeach ſheweth that no Fruite
had been eaten before. Doubtles the woman fell a Virgin: and yf they
had ſtoode but a ſhort tyme, the bleſſing of God had not been in vayne
for propagation. Aboue all reaſones this muſt be confidered, that the
Redemption was to be ſhewed preſently vpon the Creation. For that
is the fytteſt to mooue men to holde it: and God omitteth nothyng
that beſt helpeth to that. This ſhoulde moue all men to put no truſt in
them ſelues: for that
                  That in Pſal. 49, 20. is holden of Clem. R. Nathan, R. Menachem, and Midrad Tillin, to be ſpoken of Adam. 
               Adam hauyng once iuſtice, and true holynes, did
not lodge one nyght in honoure, but became lyke the Beaſtes that peryſh.
And the lyght that ſhyneth in darknes, mooued men of all religions
to holde this. For this opinion hath been euery where receyued,
that they fell the day of their creation. So the Ievves generally holde.
I heard neuer of one that was of an other iudgement: and yet many
of them ſee not how fitly they ſay, for the Redemption by the ſeconde
Adam. The HeathenBibliander preface in Chro. Chriſtians haue helde this from the beginnyng.

ſaw Chriſt the Angell, the
God of Abrahā, Iſaac, & Iacob,

                           MOSES taught that Chriſte
                           
ſhoulde ſuffer by death to
ouercōe death. Eb. 2. Death
reigned frō 
                           Adam to Moſes,
Rom. 5. He that beleeueth
not Moſes, will not beleeue
though one ſhould riſe frō
                           
the dead. Luk. 16. But whē
                           
                           Moſes is read a couering lieth
vpon the Ievves hartes.

MOSES brīgeth Iſrael out
of Egypt, by the blood of a
Lambe Exod. 12, 42. figuring
the Lambe of GOD, which
taketh away the ſinnes of
the worlde. Iohn: 1, 29.
                        
                        The Law was geuen by
                           Moſes, but grace and trueth
came by Ieſus Chriſt. Ioh. 1, 17
Niſan the 7, is hence the firſt.
                           
The Fathers were al baptized
vnto Moſes, in that
cloude, and in that Sea: &
did al eate the ſame ſpirituall
meate, and did all
drinke the ſame ſpirituall
drinke: for they dranke of
the ſpiritual Rocke that folowed
them: & the Rocke
                           
was CHRIST. 1 Cor. 10, 2, 3.
                        
                        The Fathers did eate
                           Manna, a ſpirituall meate,
bread frō Heauen: the Father
geueth the true bread
from Heauen, and geueth
lyfe vnto the worlde.
                        
                        
                           IESVS is the bread of
lyfe. Ioh. 6, 31.

haue humbled them: vvhereby

their idolatrie is by Samuel remoued,

might be a great cauſe, that God

THE ſtate of the fourtie yeeres of IEREMIE is more largely handled in
Gods booke,Ezek. 4, 6. thē that euery yeres ſtory may be touched once in one line:
wherefore I wyll ſo farre breake of the Chronicle, as to make ſome diſcourſe

taught freely,2. King. 23, 21. 2. Chro. 34, 21. Sophe. 1. that IERVSALEM ſhould be as SYLOH. The king reformed
his ſtate, kept a moſt ſolenne Paſſeouer, and looked for captiuitie: but
God reiourned it vntyl his death. SOPHONY after reformation, warneth
the kinges ſonnes of Gods iudgement,2. K in. 23, 29. The fyfth calamitie. and blameth many for cloſſe
Idolatrie. On EGYPT they ſtayed, whoſe king NECHO killed at
MAGEDDON, IOSIAS the vncted of IEHOVAH. That ZACHARY remembreth.2 Chro. 35, 20. 2. King 23, 34 The ſyxth calamitie.
               Cha. 12. and ſheweth, that ſuch ſhalbe their mournyng for killyng
of CHRIST: but to better cōfort. Then Necho helde CARCHEMYS
againſt ASSVR, and diſplaced king IOACHAZ, carrying him into EGYPT,
and placed ELIAKIM king in IVDAH, changing his name vnto IEHOIAKYM.
In the firſt yeere of Iehoiakym Ieremy doth prophecie, that SALLVM
or IOACHAZ ſhall not returne from EGYPT but dye there. Chr. 22.
That NABVCHADNEZAR ſhalbe king of BABEL:

IEREMY quit. His thyrd yeere endyng, and much of his fourth,Iere. 26, 23. Dan. 1, 1. Iere. 25, 1. is the
fyrſt of Nabuchadnezar. Then Ieremy prophecieth that NECHOS Garriſons
of CARCHEMYS, and al EGYPT ſhalbe ſubdued by Nabuchadnezar. The former
preſently tooke effect. Nabuchadnezar commeth agaynſt Ieruſalem, and
Ieremy telleth againe more particulerly of Nabuchadnezars power and kingdome
to be great for ſeauentie yeeres:
                  Dan. 1. The ſeuenth calamitie. and of Ieruſalems deſolation for
ſeauentie. Then Ieruſalem beſieged his taken, IEHOAKIM, DANIEL, ANANIAS,
AZARIAS, and MISAEL, with others of the kinges ſtocke, are
brought to BABEL. The king is ſent home agayne, & made tributarie to
Nabuchadnezar.

When Iehoakym rebelled, then the other are found ten tymes better

ſkill in Viſions and Dreames: whoſe caſe I compared before with IOSEPHS
for tyme of ſhewyng ſkyll, for kinges affection, for excellyng
Magicians, for aduauncement to the mayntenaunce of their brethren.

The king in one dreame ſeeth how BABEL alone, MADAI and PARAS
ioyntly, IAV AN fyrſt ioyntly, after parted, in EGYPT and BABEL ſhoulde
rule many Nations, & afflict EBER vntil the birth of our Lord, the king
of all kinges: as Eſa. 9. This he ſaw in one Image, and forgate his dreame.
DANIEL ſaw the ſame: remembred it: taught it the king: is made a
great man: preferreth Ananias, Azarias, and Miſael, to be rulers in BABEL.
Sone after the king ſetteth vp a great Image: and caſteth Ananias, Azarias,

terme of cooſenage: His fathers brother properly, in ſucceſſiō his ſonne is
made king by Nabuchadnezar, as God tolde Ieremy. Foure yere Ieremy laboureth
to teach how nations muſt beare the yoke of BABEL: After Iechonias
and Mordochay were caryed away. In his fourth yeere ANANIAS prophecyeth
falſely: that within two yeeres God will breake the yoke of the
king of BABEL, and reſtore IECHONIAS home, and all that were caryed
with hym: Ieremy telleth Ananias that for his falſe prophecie he ſhould dye
that ſame yeere: which death of his fell out as it was foretolde. The
ſame yeere Ieremy writeth to Iſrael caryed to Babel, that they ſhoulde looke
for the ende of ſeuentie yeeres before they looked to returne. Alſo, he
ſendeth to Babylon a prophecie of the fall of Babylon,
               Iere. 50. and, Chap. 51. larger then that in
ESAY. Chap. 13. & 14. & 21. Or that in ABAKVK Chap. 2. and charged
the bearer SARAYAS ruler of Menucha, who was ſent from TZEDEKIA

to Babel that he ſhoulde reade the Prophecie at Euphrates: then ſhoulde he
tye it to a Stone, and caſt it into the myddle of Euphrates, ſaying: Thus
ſhall Babylon be drowned.Apoc. 18, 21. Apoc. 17, 5. The lyke are we taught, Apo. 18. touching
ROME, called BABYLON in a myſterie. Then a myghty Angell tooke
vp a Stone lyke a great Milſtone, and caſt it in
                  •
               o the Sea, ſaying: with
ſuch violence ſhal the great citie Babylon be caſt and ſhalbe no more found.
As Ieremy writes to Babylon to keepe Iſrael in true patience,Iere 28, 17. and hope of
deliueraunce: ſo falſe Prophetes in Babylon reſiſted him: One ACHAB
and TZEDEKIAS,
               Iere. 29, 22. of whom he prophecyeth that Nabuchadnezar will make
them an enſample, and a byworde of myſerably curſed: burnyng them
in fyre. We may be ſure ſo it fell out, becauſe they ſtyrred men to fall
away from his obedience. He that ſpared not the Chaldeans, Dan. 2. would
not ſpare them. Alſo in Babylon there was a man called SAMAIAH,
who wrote to Ieruſalem agaynſt Ieremy, that he ſhoulde be clapt vp in
Lytle-eaſe, for writyng to Babel that their captiuitie ſhoulde be long.
IEREMY from God ſendeth him a bitter anſwere: He calleth him a
Neclemite: which is, a Dreamer. It may be his family came of NACHAM
1. Chr. 4, 19. and as he pretended, that the puniſhers of Ieremy ſhoulde folowe
Iehoiada:
               Iere. 29, 32. ſo myght Ieremy taunthim, that he was rather to be called
a dreamyng Neclemite, then a Noe-like Nachamite: for of Nacham,
(which meaneth comfortyng) had NOE his name. Gen. 5. Of him Ieremy
wryteth, that in Babylon his family ſhall peryſhe.
            When Ieremy had ben thus reſiſted,Ezek. 1, 1. by falſe Prophetes, God ſtyrreth vp
Ezekiel to perſwade the remnant by wryting, that they ſhoulde be caryed
to Babel.
               Eſt 2, 6. He was captiued when Iechonias and Mardochai were. His example,Eze. 40, 1.
and the experience of two Captiuities myght haue warned them
not to ſtore vp wrath: but to marke how Iſrael pylde by PVL, captiued
and pylde in part to ſtrayght ſlauery by Tiglath-Pel-eſar, had ful payment
to bondage by Salman-aſar. So Iudaht Citie already ſurpriſed twiſe by

               IEHOIAKYMS frowardnes, was now paſt hope of abilitie to reſiſt one
ſet vp a Conquerer for their ſinnes, when they dayly more and more
prouoked Chriſt agaynſt them.Ezeki. 1. The thyrteth yeere after the ſolenne
Paſſeouer, & fyndyng of MOSES originall, EZEKIEL ſeeth the glory of

ſaw in forme of bodyed weightes, bearyng in part the forme of a Man,
of a Lyon, of on Oxe, of an Egle: they had alſo wynges: and a voyce was
heard: of the bleſſed glory of IEHOVAH from his place. The Chriſtians
redeemed from the Heathen,Apoc. 8, 7. haue much the lyke. Apo. 4. Here were
alſo wheeles within wheeles with fellyes full of eyes: whereby the creature
ruled by an endles foreſight, ought to be meaned. There appeared
beſydes vpon a Sapphyre throne the lykenes of a man, with the ſight
of fyre myxt with the Raynebowes coloure. So Chriſt ſheweth hym

Table, Dyet, and lying on his Sides, betokeneth that Ieruſalem by ſiege, and
famyne, ſhalbe taken: wherein note ſpecially the tyme, applying a day
to a yeere. Three hundred and ninetie dayes repreſent ſo many yeeres
from the fallyng away by IEROBOAM. By ſo many yeeres ſhall Ieruſalem
be deſtroyed, and left defolate. In the ende of them, when you are within
fourtie of the laſt, on the other ſyde, was Ezekiel to lye fourty dayes for
a new remembraunce of the ſinne of IVDAH: who ſhoulde be deſtroyed
as aforeſayd: and that when fourtie yeeres ſhoulde be accomplyſhed in
the preachyng of Ieremy, whom they ſo much deſpiſed. Famous woulde
God haue the paynes of that his ſeruaunt.Ezeki. 5. The ſame tyme Ezekiel ſhauyng

with Gedaliah, ſhoulde ſoone by Iſmael come to nothyng.Iere. 41, 2. The next
yeere agayne he ſeeth the glory of Chriſt, leauyng the Temple, the Cherubim
accompanying, and goyng to Mount Oliuet. The lyke forſakyng

vvholly the Lord reſteth, vvhich Adam neuer ſavv vvholly kept. Therein he
finished that Ceremony. The firſt day of the vveeke his reſurrection maketh the
Lord his day. Apo. 1. He appeareth fourty dayes: is taken vp into the Heauens,

reſurrection they coulde not choſe) all men vvill beleeue on hym and the Romanes
vvyll come and deſtroy our Place, and Nation. Ioh. 11. Yet vvhen Stephen ſayd,
that IESVS of Nazareth vvoulde deſtroy that Place: they helde it blaſphemy
in an other to ſpeake ſo of their Place, though he had the countenance and vvordes
of the Angell Gabriel. Act. 6. The Lord cloſely limitted the tyme, tellyng hovv
that generation should not paſſe, vntyll all thoſe thinges shoulde be perfourmed. By the
moſt mens accompt it vvas fourty yeres: ſo it falleth a day for an yere, for miſbeleeuing

and of the ſinfull ryſing, in lieu of hym. Of that miſchiefe ſpake our Lord. Mat. 24.

long a warnyng geuen to the Ievves, as GOD by Lamech gaue to the
olde worlde, when he named Noah A ſpeciall Comforter. But the
Ievves went in the miſbeliefe of the olde worlde. The Lorde by theſe
times had ſhaken not only the Earth,Heb. 12, 26. Him that came not in the name of the father, but in his ovvne name, they receyue. Ioh. 5. Dan. 9, 27. Math. 14, 15. Mark. 13, 14. Zacha 11, 1, 2. Ezek. 47. and earthly Emperours, but alſo

kingdome: that ſuch as ſhoulde not be ſhaken myght be ſetled. Yet the
Ievves denying the true Meſſias, cleaue to Bar-chozba, who ſayd that he
was Chriſt: for him they rebelled, though after he reigned two yeeres
and an halfe, they kylled hym. Talmud in Sanedren. Cha. Chelek. Pa. 93 & 97.
Thereupon the Romane abominable infidels with force of deſolation
come to the mountayne and place once holy: and worke a finall
iudgement vpon it. Then Libanus did open the gates: fyre brent the
Ceders, the Firre, and Oke houled: when Nations warred agaynſt
Ieruſalem, tooke the Citie, rifled the houſes, defiled the women. And
now is the day of liuely waters iſſuing from a Ieruſalem from eaſt to

of the earth to worſhyp the king IEHOVAH of hoſtes, their fleſh, eyes,

made a ſeauenth, which after a ſort ſhould be an eyght. That power is
noted by a beaſt of ſeauen heades: wherupon the Angel expoundeth it
of ſeauen Hilles, & ſeauen Kinges. Any political ſtate is in the Ebrew
phraſe calde a King, as Dan. 8, 21. Rome was infamous for cruelty euer
ſince Romulus kylde his brother: but ſpecially in the ten Perſecutors
and the Popes. The one beaſt the later hath for that, purple coloure.
The beaſt Chap. 13. hath a cleere note from famous ſtories. Whereas
the Image of the Emperours in Daniel were a Lion, Beare, Leopard, &
abeaſt with ten hornes: Rome hauing ſubdued all thoſe Countries,
thereaftet is a Beaſt with ten hornes, lyke a Leopard, footed lyke a
Beare,Apoc 17, 12. Steuchns agaynſt Laur. Valla booke. 2. mouthed like a Lion. Alſo the other Beaſt hath ten hornes very
fitly: both for the ten Perſecutors, and ten Kingdomes that Iohn foreſaw
ſhould be vnder the Popo: and Steuchus doth pretely confeſſe: and
the Greke Scholiaſt foretolde that it would fall out ſo. The kingdomes

1. of Spayne and Portugall. 2. of Hungary. 3. of Englande. 4. of Denmarke.
5. of Ruſcia. 6. of Creatia and Dalmacia. 7. of Aragon. 8. of Bohemia.
9. Sueuia and Noruegia. 10. of Dacia: Theſe Steuchus recordeth to haue
geuen their power to the Beaſt. For they payde tribute to the Pope, who
calde his throne the Apoſtolike ſeate,Apoc. 13, 5. & had the mouth of the Dragon.
The Greke Scholiaſt ſpeaketh moſt fitly vpon this place: ſaying,
that the ten Hornes are ten Kinges, which in the later times ſhall ariſe

was no Prophet, yet the playnnes of the matter cauſed him to ſay this
much. And in theſe ten Kingdomes is reuiued a ſpice of the gouernement
of the people of Rome: Which then when Iohn wrote had deuided
their Countryes of Lieutenantſhyppes into ten: as Srabo, who
ſaw Iohnt dayes, lately had recorded Geo 17. This Empire notwithſtandyng
their ſtrength was ouerthrowen for the Emperours fylthy
lyfe, ſpecially for kyllyng them that had the teſtimony of IESVS.
For the Lord Ieſus fought agaynſt them in iuſtice and power,Apoc. 10. Apoc. 6, 2. The vvhyte Horſe, the 1 and 5 ſeale. as riding
on a white Horſe, with a Bow, and Arrowes ſharpe in the hart of the
kinges enimies. The holy Martyrs, who had hartes lyke Lions, they
layed vnder the Aulter, ſtyrred vp the holy and iuſt LORD, to iudge
and reuenge their blood, vpon thoſe beaſtes that ruled the earth. They
in patience, as Oxen ſacrificed, yeelding their blood, ſaw a iuſt recompence
of bloodſhed. For all their prophane Emperours almoſt (ſome
ſomwhat fauoured Chriſtians) brought their heades, with blood to
the graue: as they came not vp without great bloodſhed. The vēgeance
of God was to them as a red Horſe,The red Horſe the 2 ſeale. with a rider hauing a great ſword▪
and a commiſſion to take peace from the earth: that men ſhould kyll
one another. Famine in great warres is not greatly ſtrange: but
here ſcarcitie exceeding plentiful did they ſee who were men in deede,
a puniſhment of the Goſpel reiected. Many learned men of the heathē
noted the pitifull ſtate: but had not the iudgement of a man to know
that for ſauage cruelty agaynſt the Goſpell, this puniſhment was ſent.
The wyſe myght ſee a blacke Horſe ſent from God,The blacke Horſe the 3 ſeale, with a ryder
hauyng a balance weighing Corne, as Spice for dearth: though Oyle
and Wine, and ſome ſuſtenaunce of the earth was granted by the patience
of God. Gods patience not being regarded, he ſent among
the Caeſaret vpon the perſecution by Diocletian, threefold iudgementes to
the Emperours, as ſword, hunger, and death all togeather. They who
with Eagles eyes, woulde come to ſee Chriſt his iuſtice, myght now
beholde a pale Horſe▪ hauyng death and hell ryding vpon hym.Tbe pale Horſe the 4 ſeale. Sozimus, booke 2. noteth that Licinius one of the ſtriuers at once of his 130000. ſouldiers loſt all ſauyng three. The 6 ſeale. Then
ſuch ſlaughter made the Caeſaret, and the Auguſti, of them ſelues and of
their people, that the Kinges, and Dukes, and Earles, and euery free
man, and ſeruaunt, were fayne in all places to hyde them ſelues from
them that fauoured Chriſtianitie, whom God made the ſtronger. The
prophane men for Idolatry felt ſuch wrath as did Samaria, when Iſra

vpon vs, and hyde vs. Yea, they that thought them ſelues to be the
Sunne, Moone, Starres, Heauens, and Mountaynes of the Worlde, and
to rule all Ilandes, are brought to ſuch deſtruction, that the whole
worlde as touchyng them is altered: The Earth is ſhaken, the Sunne
blacke the Moone blooddy, the Starres fallen, the Heauen rowled as a

rowle,Apoc. 6, 14. and euery Mountayne and Iland haue ſuch alteration of dwellers
as yf they were mooued from their place. Theſe ſpeeches may
fitly be applyed to the tymes of Conſtantius and Conſtantinus, the fyrſt
Chriſtian Emperours. The lyke tropes are in Eſa. 34. of matters fallen
out before theſe tymes: though moſt properly it wyll fall out,
when vpon the Popes vtter deſtruction the whole worlde ſhalbe ended.
But once it muſt be meant touchyng the deſtruſtion of the Empire.

there, that they purpoſed to haue named it GOTHIA. Genſerieus and
his Vandales rifled it, that they beſtowed fourtene dayes in ranſaking it.
Odoacer with many nations ſurpriſe it, & reigne there many yeeres. But
many more yeeres doth Theodoricus with his Oſtrogothes rule it. Totilas the
Goth brent it, as Scipio did Carthage. Then Scipio ſpake verſes of Homer:
which Hector had foreſpoken of Troyes ruine. Polybius demaundyng of
what Citie he ſpake: he ſayd, of ROME: that the day ſhould come,
that it ſhould be made like Carthage. That ſaying of Scipio is applyed to
Alaricus his time: it might be to Totilas, who brought ruinous Rome to
an extreamer ruine. And ſo the citie there was defaced. But

for eſtimation is: and the POPE rulyng ouer the Empire, maketh
the ſeuenth and the eyght Policy in ROME.
               Apoc. 13, 11. To make that poynt
more playne, of reuiuyng Rome by the POPES, we haue a new viſion.
For they are a Beaſt with hornes lyke a Lambe, and the mouth of the
Dragon: who maketh the image of the former Beaſt to haue lyfe,
ſpirite, voyce, and worſhyp of nations, with kylling the men, and confiſcating
their goods,Reade the forged donation of Conſtantine.
                that yeelde not to their ioyned power. Hereupon
it hath bene clearly ſhewed by the Learned, that for Lawes, Apparell,
and Idolatry, the POPES are a lyuely image of the prophane Emperours:
with a religion more after Homer, then after the Scripture. Moreouer
to declare what ſhould be meant by Hornes like a Lambe: in the vſurping
Vicar of Chriſt, we haue a certayne name poynted at: whoſe frame
and force wyll ſhew the matter. Many mens names there be in the
HOLYBOOKE, of fit markes for thynges that men conceyue of
God, or would fynde in them ſelues. And in the ſuppoſed barren places,Ezra. 2, 13.
as in Ezra great fertility of wyſedome groweth. From thence hyther
God geueth vs a number attributed vnto a man, which wyll ſhew
vs what mans name beyng opened for the force wyll vtter the ſtate

as Ierome marked, conteyneth the myſterie

Seeing he ſetteth vp him ſelfe in the Temple of God, as yf
he were GOD. Antiochus Epiphanes who ſtarted from Rome and ſet
in the Temple the Idole of Iupiter Olympius, dyd not ſo much exalthym
ſelfe aboue God. The POPE began to ſtand vp a Lord, when impudent

excommunicated LEO the Greeke Emperour, putryng downe
Images, though he dyd that by the conſent of councell, vpon the expreſſe

After the deſtruction of Babylon, let vs behold the ſaluation
of Syon: which mountayne the Lordes death lyftted aboue
all Mountaines:Eſa. 2, 2. Mich. 4, 1. Apo. 14. that all Nations might folow the Lambe
vpon it. At Ieruſalem the Diſciples receyued power from
aboue: beyng togeather about an hundreth and twentie
ſoules: to declare the great workes of God, in rayſing his
ſonne from death. Then were Ievves from all Nations vnder
Heauen at Ieruſalem. Saint Luke reckoneth them much
after the countryes, into which men were firſt ſcattered
vpon the confuſion of tongues, for the building of Babylon:
and according to the kingdomes that oppreſſed the faythfull
Ebrevvet after Babels ruine by Sem and Iapheths poſteritie.
The number of an hundred and twentie to ſpeake to all
Ievves, that from farre Countryes came to Ieruſalem: was fit
to reuiue the ſtory of their diſpertion vnder Darius and Cyrus:

tolde what yeere, day, and houre, CHRIST ſhoulde dye.
That Prophecy made them come that yeere to Ieruſalem, to
looke for the kingdome of Heauen to appeare. Then from
Syon was the Law to goe foorth,Eſa. 2, 3. and the worde of the Lord

an eternall ſacrificer by once offeryng hym ſelfe.
In this Citie they receyued power in a ſtrong wynd, in fyery
clouen tongues, were fylled with the holy Ghoſt, and could
ſpeake to euery one in his owne language. So the Ieruſalem
from aboue was to be buylt, that all nations myght woorke

was but Babylon a confuſion: and men

               kattered cauſed the
name Synear: and were eſtranged from the Tentes of Sem:
and lyfe of God, without whom beyng their guyde, they
peryſh for euer. Hence the Diſciples went foorth to teach
how CHRIST was to ſuffer: to aryſe from death, and to
geue ſaluation to the worlde.
            That worke they perfourmed by the ſtrength of God:
who confirmed their doctrine with ſignes, wonders, powers,
and gyftes of the holy ſpirite, accordyng to his wyll. Some
of theſe godly Angels ſoone dyd ſeale their doctrine with
their blood: ſome later ended their goodly combat: ſome lyued
to ſee CHRIST come in his kingdome with power: when
the worde was fruitefull in all the worlde: & that citie was
buylt by Fyſhers of Galilee, which is called IEHOV AH-THERE.
            
            
               
Then Tongues, Nations, and people of all Kingdomes
departed from the power of darknes, by fayth and obedience

The name of this Citie much helpeth Ievv and Gentile, to ſee

in Canaan hath Chriſt deſtroyed. This name ſhould cleerely
haue taught both the Ebrevves not to looke and pray dayly
for to returne to Canaan: and Pſeudocatholiques not to haue
fought for ſpeciall holynes there. We lyue in this by fayth,
and not by eye ſight: and by hope, we behold the perfection.
