            A SERMON PREACHED AT WINSOR before the Kings Maiestie, the 11. day of September. 1604.
            
            
               
                  Matth. 4. 4.
               
               Man liueth not by bread onely, but by euery word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.
            
            
               CHrist our Sauiour came into the world, to dissolue the workes of the Deuill. Now how thoroughly he would afterward destroy the deuill, and all his workes, he gaue a tast, as it were, in this his first encounter. Wherin we may note what great difference there is betweene the first Adam, and the second. The first Adam was in Paradise,

a place of all abundance and pleasure: the second Adam in the desart, a place of all scarcitie and want. The first was full, and so the lesse needed to eat the forbidden fruit: the second fasting, and so the easilier drawne to make himselfe meate. Yet the first, though he were in Paradise, and full, when his wife intised him to eat the aple, tooke it and ate it: but the second, though he were in the desart, and fasting a long time, when the deuill inticed him to turne stones into bread, would not yeeld to him, but said, Man liueth not by bread onely, but by euery word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.
            Howbeit as Christ herein was contrary to Adam; so he agreeth verie well with Iob. Holy Iob was vpon a dunghill: Christ was in the desert. Iob had fasted seauen dayes, and seuen nights: Christ had fasted fortie dayes and for
               
                  •…
               ie nights. Iob when his wife enticed him to curse God and die, would not, but said; Thou speakest like a foolish woman: Christ when the tempter entised him, not to curse God and die, but

to distrust God rather then he should die, would not, but said, Man liueth no

                by bread onely, but by euerie word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.
            Where, before we goe any further, it will not be amisse, to assoyle one question, Why our blessed Sa

                  •…
               
               ning of miracles, saies S. Iohn did Iesus at Cana in Galilie, and his Disciples beleeued in him. Two ends therefore did he propound to himselfe in working that miracle. The encrease of his owne glorie, and his disciples faith. Now here, neither of these two ends could be attained: For how should he not haue disgraced his glorie, if he had shewed any vaine glorie? If thou be the sonne of God, saies the tempte
                  •…
               , commaunde that these stones be made bread. So that his temptation tended onely to this ende, to make the sonne of God vain-glorious. Againe, how could we haue beene perswaded by him, if he

had beene perswaded by the deuill? For he might haue seemed to haue done this miracle not only by the deuills appointment, but by his power. The summe is this therefore, To conuert any poore soule vnto God, or to make a sonne of God, he would haue done it, vaine-gloriously to shewe himselfe the sonne of God he would not doe it; but said, Man liueth not by bread onely, but by euerie word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.
            The word man is verie materiall: As if he should haue said, Any ordinarie man liueth not by the bread; but by the power, and strength, and as the Prophet calleth it, the staffe of bread, which God giueth it. Now if he that is but a bare man liueth rather by the blessing of God, then by the bread; much lesse need I presume vpon vnlawful meanes, that am both man and God. Againe, we must obserue that by The word which proceedeth out of the mouth of God, we are not to vnderstand the written will or word of God, but the secret counsell and decree of God, in preseruing

and sustaining his creatures: For example, if the word haue gone out of Gods mouth, and if God haue set it downe, and saide it, that I shall liue as well without bread as with bread, so it shall be. Or if God in his prouidence haue prouided that a stone shal nourish me as well as bread, then I shall not neede to distrust his goodnesse, or to vse vnlawfull means for my releefe. For, Man liueth not by bread onely, but by 
                  •…

            There are two places of Scripture, which are fit commentaries vpon this text. The first is written in Ecclesiastes:ca

            First, saith the preacher, The race is not to the swift. Asahel was as swift of2.

            Secondly, saith the Preacher, The battell is not to the strong. Golias was a mightie strong gyant: His height was sixe cubits, and a hand breadth: he had1. S

This name of the Lord of hosts, this mightie word proceeding out of Gods mouth, stroke the stroke. Euen as holy Dauid humbly confesseth, saying, We got not the victorie by our owne sword, neither was it our arme that did saue vs: but thy right hand, OPsal. 44 7.

            Thirdly, saith the preacher, Bread is not to the wise. One would thinke him but a simple wise man, that can not by

his wisdome prouide himselfe bread, that is, sufficient maintenance for his estate. Yet thus it fallet

And then he saide, How many hired seruants in my fathers house haue bread enough, and I starue here for hunger? Thus falleth it o

               Fourthly, saith the preacher, Riches are not to men of vnderstanding. That rich man in the gospel wanted notLuk. 1

Thou foole, this night shal they take away thy soule from thee, and then, whose shall thy goods be? Wherfore he that thoght himselfe of great vnderstanding before, is here declared to be a foole, and a poore foole also, hauing not so much as his soule left to helpe him.

            Lastly, saith the preacher, Fauour is not to men of knowledge. It seemeth that a man of knowledge and learning should obtaine fauour and acceptance, wheresoeuer he becommeth. But it is not so. Oftentimes, either he getteth none, or els he looseth that which he hath gotten. Haman a man of great

               ke. Wherfore man getteth not fauour by knowledge onely, but by the fauour of god: Man liueth not by bread onely, but by euery word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god.
            This doctrine teacheth vs, that if we haue gotten the race, gotten the battel, gotten bread, gotten riches, gotten fauour, we should not ascribe these things to our owne sacrifices, to our owne strength, to our owne wisdome, to our owne vnderstanding, to our owne knowledge, but to the grace of god, and the blessed word proceeding out of his

knoweth that all good successe he hath in any thing, cōmeth of the Lord. And thus much for the first place of Scripture, which is a commentarie vpon this text. Man liueth not by bread onely, but by euery word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god.

And though Laban changed his wages ten tims, yet he could not one time change that blessing of God, which was alwaies vpon him. And though he allotted his nephew onely the spotted lambs, which commonly were verie fewe to his wages, yet the word proceeding so out of Gods mouth, this prooued an infinite gaine vnto him. Whereupon the blessed Patriarke humbleth himselfe in true

               e with two troups. O that we had such good soules, such thankefull hearts in vs, as that euerie one of vs would in

like sort confesse and acknowledge his owne vnworthinesse, and the wonderfull worth and wealth of Gods mercie. O Lord, sai's he, I am not worthie of the least, or I am lesser then the least of all thy mercies. He makes no mention of his owne paines and trauailes, though they had beene verie great in that long seruice, but onely of the mercies of God. These were the only cause that his bagge was so full. Wherefore man filleth not his bagge by earning wages onely, but by the mercies of God. Man liueth not by bread onely, but by euery word which proceedeth out of the mouth of God.
            This teacheth vs, that whether we sow, or eate, or drinke, or cloath vs, or earne wages, we must do all to the glorie of God. And all we doe to the glorie of God, when we referre the glorie of all we doe to God. Not sacrificing to our owne yarne, as the Prophet speaketh, or kissing our owne hand: but kissing the sonne, and offring vp to him onely the sacrifices of praise and thanksgiuing at whose hand we receiue all

good things. For it is not our painefull sowing that giues vs a plentifull crop: not our eating that f

               edeth vs: not our drinking that satisfieth vs: not our clothes that warme vs: not out earning wages that filleth our bagge: but the good word that procedeth out of Gods mouth, which blessed all these things vnto vs. Therefore as we must not beginne any of these without grace-saying: so we must not ende any of them without thanksgiuing. And thus much for the second place of Scripture, which is a commentarie vpon this text; Man liueth not by br

            To make good vse then of all that hath beene spoken, I shall desire you to obserue foure points. First, that God can worke great matters with small meanes. Thus saith our Lord; When I brake the fiue loaues among fiue thousand,
                  
                     〈◊〉

                  •…
               ld satisfie fowre thousand, and much lesse, that fiue loaues fiue thousand. But Christ hauing giuen thanks and blessed the bread, did that by the might of the word proceeding out of his mouth, which by the naturall power and condition of the bread could neuer haue beene done. Therefore also he repeateth it, and questioneth with his disciples about it. That by their confession and report, all the Church afterwards might beleeue, that God can worke great matters with small meanes, and that Man liueth not by breade onely, but by euerie word which proceedeth out of the mouth of God.
            Secondly, that God can work strong matters with weake meanes. What a strong violent matter is it, to pull the soule of any one sinner out of the bottome of hell, and out of the iawes of destruction? yet this God doth. But how doth he i
                  •…
               ? This strong matter, howe

doth he worke it? By the weakest means that may be. We haue this treasure, saith the Apostle, in earthen vessels,2. Cor. 6. 7. that the excellency of that power might be of God, and not of vs. O marueilous words, That the excellencie of that power might be of God, and not of vs. For if Angels were sent to preach vnto vs, it might be thought, that the conuersion of sinners consisted in the excellencie of the Angels ministrie, not in the power of Gods word. Now simple and sinneful men, such as our selues are, no better then earthen vessels, bringing such a

               reasure vnto vs, the excellencie of this worke must needs be wholly ascribed to God. And as it is in spirituall foode, so it is in corporall. It is not the teacher, but the doctrine taught: or rather not the doctrine barely taught nei

                by breade onely, but by euerie word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.
            Thirdly, that God can worke some matters with no meanes. When King Asa sawe himselfe ouerpressed with the2. Chr. 14. 11. multitude of his enemies, he praied thus to God: O Lord, it is all one with thee, to saue with many, or with no power. If he had said with many, or with a small power, it would haue beene plaine. But with many, or with no power, is verie wonderfull. Or rather it is no wonder a

                all, seeing it is spoken of God, with whome it is a verie ordinarie matter to saue, not onely as well with a small or a weak power, as with a great or a strong power, but also as well with no power, as with some power. It is a good carpenter, who ha

            And yet this is no doctrine of idlenesse and securitie neither. As we must not by diffidence or distrust in God, vse vnlawfull meanes: so we must not by presuming vpon God, neglect lavvfull meanes.

               ruert this. For out of that the Apostle saith, Affliction vvorketh glory; they endeauour to conclude,

that the patience of the Saints, and other their vertues, merit euerlasting life. But first the word, To worke, is verie generall and signifieth not onely causes properly so named, but also any antecedent, though it be but an adiunct or an accident. Againe, the Apostles words elsewhere are these. I supposeRom. 8. 1
                     •…
                  . that the afflictions of this life, are not worthie os the glorie which shalbe reuealed. Wherefore they might haue done well, to chuse some indifferet construction which would haue reconciled both these places together, rather then to imbrace such an exposition of the one, as doth iustle, nay quite thrust out the other. S. Bernard doth thus, saying, that good wor

               es, are not any

                  . cause meriting a kingdome, but onely a way directing to a kingdome. For seeing they are no cause, neither haue any correspondence, or proportion in them in respect of the glorie to come, therefore the Apostle saith, The afflictions of this life are not worthie the glorie that shalbe reueiled. And yet againe because the possessing of our soules in patience,

is a way directly tending to the saluation both of our soules and bodies, therefore he saith, The momentarie 
                  •…
               ightnesse of our affliction worketh vs 
                  •…
                surpassing exceeding eternall weight of glorie. To which our Sauiour subscribeth in these words, The gate is straight, and the way narrowe which leadeth vnto life. This straightnesse therfore and narrownesse of affliction, is not a cause which deserueth, but a gate or a way, which leadeth vnto life. So in an other place we haue, that by many tribulations we must enter into the kingdome of heauen. Not by many tribulatiōs, no not by any tribulations, we must merit heauen, but by many tribulations as by a gate or way, we must enter into the kingdome of heauen. And in this sense S. Paul saies, The momentarie lightnesse of our affliction worketh vs a surpassing exceeding eternall waight of glorie.
            But now though this sentence doe not confirme any Popish error, yet it doth excellently comfort any distressed and afflicted. For it exhorteth vs to be

patient in all afflictions, and that for foure reasons. The two first drawn from the nature of our affliction, the two last from the nature of that glory, which shalbe the reward of our affliction. T

For the momentarie lightnesse of our affliction worketh vs a surpassing exceeding eternall waight of glorie.
            First, our afflictiō is momentarie. Wel

               ting. And theresore seeing our whole life is but a vapour, or a flitting, certenly our afflictions which are all comprised within the compasse of this life,

must needes be much more momentarie. All afflictiō, as the Apostle writeth,Heb. 12. 11. for the present seemeth not to be ioyous but grieuous; but afterward it bringeth forth the quiet fruits of righteousnesse to them that are exercised thereby. He saith not that affliction is, but that it seemeth to be. So that affliction seemeth to be one thing, and is indeede an other. It seemeth to be grieuous, it is indeede ioyous: it seemeth to be troblesome, it is indeede comfortable: it seemeth to be long and tedious, it is indeede momentarie and short. Euen as God himselfe determineth this matter; For a moment, saith he, inEsa. 54. 8. mine anger, for a little season haue I hid my face from you; but in euerlasting mercie will I turne vnto you againe. That we should not doubt of this doctrine, he redoubles the promise, for a moment, for a little season. Therefore the Princely Prophet say's plainly. Heauinesse may endure for a night, but ioy

had dispach't their arrant, went away inGen. 19 2. the morning: so afflictions, which are the Angels or the messengers of God. God sendeth afflictions to doe an arrant vnto vs, to tell vs, we sorget God, we forget our selues, we are too proud, too selfe concei

                  1 11. into the two witnesses which had beene slaine by the beast, after three dayes and an halfe. Why after three dayes and an halfe? To teach vs, that affliction and persecution may perhaps tyranize ouer vs three dayes and an halfe, but they shal not fill vp the whole fowre dayes. For the elects sake thoseMath. 24. 22. dayes shall be shortened. Agreeably to that which Iohn Baptist begun his preaching with, Repent; for the kingdomeMatth. 3. 2. of heauen is at hand. Repent, that's a matter of mortification and affliction to the flesh. For the kindome of heauen is at hand, That's a matter of comfort and ioy. So our Sauiour, Behold I comeReuel. 22. 12. quickly, and my reward with me: if

Christ will come quickly, then affliction will be gone quickly. Thus momentarie is our affliction: For our whole life is short, much more then the afflictions of this life: affliction is grieuous but for the present: heauinesse endureth but for a night: persecution lasteth but three dayes and an halfe: the kingdome of heauen is at hand, theresore deliuerance is at hand: Christ will come quickly, therefore affliction will be gone quickly. Wheresore seeing our affliction is so momentarie, let vs be patient in affliction: For the momentarie lightnesse of our affliction worketh vs a surpassing exceeding eternall waight of glorie.
            Secondly, our affliction is light. Almightie God setting forth his owne excellency, saith, Who hath measured theEs

                  . heauens with his span, and the waters with his fist? By the heauens are meant the diuine blessings of God; by the waters, afflictions & woes. Those he measureth with his span, which is a longer measure: these with his fist, which is a shorter measure. So that the Lord is as I may say a rhetoritian, verie plentifull

and copious in his blessings; he measureth them with his spanne: but he is a logitian, more short and sparing in his afflictions, these he measureth with his fist. For in the hand of the Lord therePsal. 75.

                  . is a cuppe, the wine is redde, and full mixt, he powreth out of the same: as for the dregges thereof, the wicked of the earth doe drinke them vp. First, we drinke not this cup onely full of redde wine, that is, of the wrath and indignation of God, but mixt with diuerse comforts otherwise. Then besides we meddle not with the dregs. Vpō the vngodly he shall raine snares, sire & brimstone, storme, and tempest, this shall be their portion to drinke. We drinke only a little of the vppermost. And therefore he saith, God powreth out of the same. That after we haue suffered a modicum, as S. Peter speaketh, we may1. Pat. 5. 10. then enter into glorie. According to king Dauid his prayer, Comfort vs, O Lord, now for the time wherein thou hast afflicted vs, and for the dayes wherin we haue seene euill. Hierome noteth that hauing first said wherein thou hast

afflicted vs; he expounds it after by these words, wherein we haue seene euill.

                that he might see only his hounds hunting, and not feele it, that happeneth indeede to vs. Our affliction is, not a feeling of euill neare at hand, but onely a feeling of it a farre off. As the Persian Kings children in their minoritie, if they had committed a fault, were not corrected themselues, but onely saw some of meaner birth chastised before them: so God teacheth vs to take heed, rather by other mens, then by our owne harmes. And looke how Abraham laid nothing but wood vpon his sonne Isaac, carrying the knife and the fire himselfe: after the s

               , that is the best exercise which is ad ruborem, non ad sudorem, refreshing the spirits and stirring vp the blood a little, but not putting a man into any great sweat. But the diuine may say, that is the best affliction, which is ad sudorem, non ad sanguinem. Therfore God

laieth vpon vs wood ad sudorem, to make vs sweat, In the sweat of thy browesGen. 3. 19. shalt thou eat thy bread; not a knife ad sanguinem, to make vs bleed, Ye haueHeb. 12. 4. not yet resisted vnto blood. God laieth vpon vs wood without fire. Now wood without fire, is not greatly dangerous. Or say he lay vpon vs both wood and fire: yet the voice of the Lord deuideth the flame of fire. For in the flame of fire naturally there is heat and light. But notwithstanding, the omnipotent voice of the Lord diuideth these, one from the other. As the cursed in hell shew, and the elect vpon earth. I am tormented in this flame, saith Dives. Theres heat, but no light. Contrariwise the three children in the furnace shined as Angels for light, but were so farre from heat, that no one haire of their head, or of their apparell perished. When Moyses saw a bush burning and not consumed, he saide, I will goe, and see this great vision. A great vision indeede. There was a flame of fire. Els how was the bush burning? There was light. Els how did Moses see it? There was no

So that he is not consumed by the heat, (nay rather his infirmities and carnall concupiscences are consumed thereby) but onely illuminated by the light. According to that, Onely vexation giueth vnderstanding. And in an other place, Light is sprung vp to the righteous, and ioy to them that are true of heart. Thus ye see how tenderly our deare fa

As is he should haue said, To drawe in the yoake without me, would be a hard matter; and to beare the burthen without me, would be aboue your strength: but if you come to me, if you drawe and beare with me, I will refresh you; For my yoake is easie, and my burthen is light. Thus light is our affliction. For God measureth to vs the water with his fist, which is the shorter measure: he causeth vs to drink of the cup no otherwise but as it is mixt with many comforts: he maketh vs not swallow vp the lees of it, but onely a little modicum of the vppermost: he laieth affliction vpon

vs, which is rather a seeing, then a feeling of euill: he laieth wood vpon vs to exercise vs, but neither a knife to cut vs, nor yet fire to burne vs. Lastly, we haue many fellowes in our affliction which make it light. All creatures: all the faithfull: all the good angels: God the father: God the holy Ghost: God the Sonne, who saith, My yoake is easie, and my burden is light. Wherefore seeing our affliction is so many waies light, we must be patient in all affliction; For the momentarie lightnes of our affliction worketh vs a surpassing exceeding eternall waight of glorie.
            Thirdly, our glorie is eternall, yea surpassing eternall. The glorie we looke for, is called a kingdome. Of which the princely Prophet saith thus; Thy kingdomePsal. 145. 13. is an euerlasting kingdome, and thy dominion endureth throughout all ages. Whereupon Origen noteth, that
                  
                     〈1 line〉
                  . as there is a holy, and a holy of holies; as a saboth, and a saboth of saboths; as a heauen, and a heauen of heauens; as a song, and a song of songs: so there is an age, and an age of ages. And againe, as

that which is not onely a holy, but also a holy of holies, is the holiest place of all; as that which is not onely a saboth, but also a saboth of saboths, is the perfectest rest of all; as that which is not onely a heauen, but also a heauen of heauens, is the highest heauen of all; as that which is not onely a song, but also a song of songs, is the excellentest song of all: so that which is not onely an age, but also an age of ages, and especially, as the Psalmist speaketh, an age of all ages, is the most infinite eternitie of all. Which seeing it is attributed to the kingdome of Christ, being likewise the kingdome of all true Christians, it followeth that our glorie is surpassing eternall. Whereupon Prosper noteth,De promiss

his kingdome there shall be no ende.Luk 1. 53. Now this glorie is as well called a crowne, as a kingdome. And this crowne, as S. Peter saith, is vndefield,

                  . stone called Aniantus, which though it be neuer so much soyled, yet it can neuer at all be blemished. And beeing cast into the fire, it is taken out▪ still more bright and cleane. Also Clemens
               
                  
                     〈1 line〉

                     •…
                  rantus, which beeing a long time hung vp in the house, yet still is fresh and greene. To both which, the stone and the flower, the Apostle, as I am verily perswaded, alludeth in this place. As if he should haue saide, The crowne which ye shall receiue, shall be studded with the stone Amiantus, which cannot be defiled; and it shall be garnished with the flower Amarantus,

which alwaies is fresh and neuer fades away: ye shall receiue a crowne vndefiled, and that neuer fades away. Which, as Beda noteth, was insinuated in the crowne round about the Arke of the Testament. For in a circle there is neither beginning nor ending. Or rather euery where there is a beginning, euery where an ending; and so no where any beginning or ending. To shew that the patient also shal haue a crown set vpon their head per circuitū, running round in a circle & neuer comming to any end of eternitie. Well, our glorie is called also a treasure. Three kind of treasures there are. A treasure in hell: a treasure in earth: a treasure in heauen. That in hell is a treasure of torments▪ that in earth is a treasure of snowe: that in heauen, is a treasure of eternitie. For the first, S. Iames sayes; Go to nowe you rich men, weepe and

and shall eat your flesh as it were fire: Ye haue heaped vp treasure for the last dayes. Here's a treasure in hell. Which to be a treasure of torments the Apostle prooueth, saying, Thou after thyRom. 2. 5. hardnesse, and heart that cannot repent, treasurest vnto thy selfe wrath against the day of wrath. A treasure of wrath and of torments.

of our affliction, worketh vs a surpassing exceeding eternall waight of glorie.
            Compare then th' affliction on th' one side, with the glorie on the other side: the shortnes of th' affliction, vvith th' eternitie of the glorie: the lightnesse of th' affliction, with the waightinesse of the glorie. And then be content for an eternall glorie to suffer momentarie affliction: for waightie glorie to suffer light affliction. The Stoickes, if their griefe were either momentary or light, cared for no more. For if it were short, they cared not how heauie it were: againe, if it were light, they cared not how long it were. Our affliction is both momentarie and light. One helpe was sufficient for them: we haue two for fayling. A starke shame therefore it would be for vs, if heathen and pagans, hauing fewer meanes then we haue, should shewe greater patience then we shewe.

            But God hath iustified vs. And hauing iustified vs, in some measure also

hath begunne to sanctisie vs. So that the flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh, in so much as we cannot doe as we would. Not onely the flesh against the spirit, but also the spirit against the flesh. So that we cannot doe as we would. For if we would serue god so holily as the angels, we can not, because the flesh lusteth against the spirit: againe, if we would sinne with full consent of wil so brutishly as the wicked doe, we cannot, because the spirit lusteth against the flesh. But euen as Castor and Pollux liue by turnes, one one day, an other an other: so the flesh and the spirit preuailing, sometimes one, sometimes an other, make mixt actions. So that neither can our good actions iustifie vs, because in them the flesh lusteth against the spirit: nor yet can our ill actions condemne vs, because in thē the spirit lusteth against the slesh. For now that Sara is mortified, her wombe is dead, and it ceaseth to be with her after the manner of women. Now that Iacob hath wrestled with God, his thigh is shrunke vp. Now

that Paul is conuerted, he chastiseth his bodie, and bringeth it into subiection. Now that the blessed virgin is freely beloued, she keepeth her selfe within, and knoweth no man. And therefore sa

As if he should haue said; Feare not the angel of the Lord, seeing the Lord of the angel is with thee. Thou hast found fauour with God, to haue the fruit of thy slesh, the sauiour of thy foule. So that if God haue a fauour vnto vs, and haue iustified vs in Christ, what can the flesh doe against vs? The spirit will not let it doe as it would. For If God be with vs, who can be against vs?

Therefore though he seeke to winnovv Peter as corne is sifted, yet no daunger; Christ hath praised for Peter, that his faith should not faile. Where by the vvay, vve may marke the difference betvveen Christ and the tempter. Christ hath his fanne in his hand, and fanneth vs; the tempter hath his siue in his hand, and sifteth vs. Novv a fanne casteth out the vvorst, and keepeth in the best: a siue keepeth in the vvorst, and casteth out the best. Right so Christ in his trialls purgeth chaffe and corruption out of vs, nourisheth and increaseth his graces in vs. Contrarivvise the deuill, is there be any ilthing in vs, that he confirmeth, if faith or any good thing els, that he weakneth. But Christ hath prayed for vs, yea doth still at the right hand of the father make intercession and request for vs, that our faith should not saile. So that all Sathans power, yea the gates of hell

shall neuer preuaile against vs. In like manner S. Paul beeing buffeted by the angel of Sathan, prayed that he might be deliuered. The answer of God was, My grace is sufficiēt for thee. Whether Satan busset vs, or not buffet vs, still the grace of God shal suffice vs. Much more his glorie, who hath glorified vs. For God doth giue both grace and glory, & no good thing wil he withhold frō thē that liue a godly li

That so we may feare no cruelty of man, no miserie of the world, no entisements

of the flesh, no terrors of the deuill, but in all these things may be more then conquerours, assuring our selues, that if God be with vs, nothing can be against vs. Which that it may be so, God graunt for Iesus Christs sake, to whome with the Father, and the holy Ghost, be all honour and glorie, now and euermore, Amen.
            Blessed are they that heare the word of God, and keepe it.

               After saide he to Thomas, Put thy finger here, and see my hands, and put forth thy hand, and put it into my side, and be not faithlesse, but faithfull.
            
            OVr blessed Sauiour Iesus Christ hath his wounds yet to be seene in his bodie for foure causes. First, to approoue his resurrection: secondly, to appease his father: thirdly, to confound his enemies: fourthly, to comfort his friends. After, said he to Thomas, Put thy finger here, and see my hands, and put forth thy hand, and put it into my side, and be not faithlesse,

but faithfull.
            The first cause, why Christ hath his wounds yet to be seene in his bodie, is to approoue his resurrection. When Iacobs children told him, saying, Ioseph is yet aliue, his heart failed, and he beleeued them not, but as soone as he saw the chariots, which were sent for him, by and by his spirit reuined, and he said, I haue inough, Ioseph my sonne is yetGen. 45 28. aliue.

Christs rising out of the graue was as strange, as Peters deliuerance out of prison: the rovvling avvay of the stone as strange, as the opening of the yron gate. And albeit Thomas vvas not so forvvard as Rhode to knovv Christ by his voice, vvhen he said, Peace be vnto you, yet as soone as Christ tooke him by the hand, and shevv▪d him his side, he made no more doubts, but presently beleeued.

Christ our king, who did ouercome death, could likewise, if it had pleased him, haue quite and cleane defaced and abolished all the markes of death. Neuerthelesse as at his transfiguration he shewed Peter, Iames, and Iohn, the signes of immortality in his body, which was then mortall: so here contrariwise at his resurrection, he sheweth Thomas the signes of mortalitie in his bodie, which is nowe immortall.

Socrates in his Ecclesiasticall historie writeth, that Athanasius being accused by one Iannes, to haue killed Arsenius, and after to haue cut off his hand, that he might vse it to magick and

token vnto vs, that the world shall neuerGen. 9. 16. be drowned againe with a generall slood of water, as it was in Noahs time. But the rainebowe which assureth vs we shall neuer be drowned in the pit of euerlasting perdition, is no such thing. Why may some man say, what is it? Marie it is the blood of Christ, which maketh as it were, a rainebowe in his side. For the other rainebow is but a transitorie signe, which shall passe away with the cloudes and with the world. But this rainebowe, whereof the other is but a shadowe, shall continue for euer in the sight of God, as the author to the Hebrewes sai's, that Christ is entred into heauen, vt appareat nunc vultui Dei pro nobis, to appeare now in the sight of God for vs. Therefore S. Iohn in the Reuelation witnesseth, that he sawe a doore open in heauen, and a rainebow round about the throne of God. He sawe a doore open in heauen, to teach vs that we can haue no accesse vnto the father, but by Christ, neither yet by Christ simply, but as he is crucified, and hath set open a doore in his side for vs

to enter by him. He sawe a rainebowe round about the throne of God, to teach vs that the throne of God would be altogether a throne of iustice, a throne of wrath, a throne of anger and indignation, were it not that the blood of Christ, spinning out as I may say still liuely and freshly in the sight of his father, maketh a rainebowe round about his throne, putteth him in mind of his couenant, appeaseth his displeasure, andGen. 30. 37. so maketh his throne to all vs that loue him, a throne of grace, a throne of compassiō, a throne of fauour and mercie in Christ. We read that Iacob

So likewise if we sinne, we haue an aduocate with the father Iesus Christ the righteous, and he is the propitiation for our sinnes. The marke of the roddes in his woundes laid open in the sight of God, ingendreth and breedeth in him a loue and a liking towards vs, so that he conceiueth well of vs, and seuereth vs as

good sheepe from the goates, and in the blood of the lamb is pleased and appeased, and satissied for our sinnes. This blood is the blood of sprinkling, whichHeb. 12. 24. speaketh bet

               er things then that os Abel. For Abels blood vpon earth cried our once for vengeance, but Christs blood in heauen cries continually for mercie. One deepe calleth another, because of the noise of the water pipes. Christs wounds are the watering troughs and the water-pipes, by which all graces flowe vnto vs. So that one deepe calleth an other, because of the noise of the water pipes; because the wounds of Christ make a continuall noise in the eares of his father, and the depth of the extreame miserie which he was in vpon earth, calleth for the depth of Gods bottomlesse and insinite mercie in heauen. Thus these holy wounds of Christ pacisie and appease his father. For now Moyses standing in the gap sues sor pardon: the poore creple lying at the beautifull gate begg's an almes: Ezechias spreading open his letters, makes his supplication:

Salomon streatching out his hands offers vp his prayer: Epaminondas being wounded, moues Agesipolis to saue Pelopidas: Seruilius discouering his wounds, perswades the people to grant Emilius triumph. Aaron burning incense in his golden censer, perfumeth the whole sanctuarie: Noah pointing to his rainebowe putteth God in minde of his promise: Iaacob laying forth his roddes make most of the lambs his owne: Abel holding vp his blood, cals and cries for mercie: Christ shewing his hands and his side appeaseth his father. As if our Sauiour should say thus vnto his father, O my louing father, looke vpon the face of thine annointed, looke vpon the hands, looke vpon the side of thine annointed. The hands of thine annointed, how cruelly they are mangled, the side of thine annointed, how wofully it is wounded. Behold and see if there be any sorrow like to my sorrow. These hands can signifie what exceeding sorrow I haue suffered: this side can shew that I haue humbled my selfe, and haue beene obedient

vnto death, euen vnto the death of the crosse. Therefore, O my deare father, Put thy finger here, and see my hands, and put forth thy hand, and put it

               nto my side, and as thou art not faithlesse, but faithfull, so be not mercilesse, but mercifull for my sake, and pitifull to thy people. So much for the second cause, which is to appease his father.
            The third cause, why Christ hath his wounds yet to be seene in his bodie, is to confound his enemies. When Saint Paul the Apostle before his conuersion persecuted the Church of God, Christ called to him from heauen, and said, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? Who art thou, Lord, saies Saul? I am, saies Christ, Iesus of Nazareth, whome thou persecurest. Alluding to the title of his crosse, which was, Iesus of Nazareth, King of the Iewes.

Therefore it is kept still for a token to the rebellious children.

So much for the third cause, which is to confound his enemies.
            The fourth cause, why Christ hath his wounds yet to be seene in his body, is to comfort his friends. Almightie God in the old law appointed cities of refuge, whither they which had sinnedNum.

Insinuating, that the Church dares neither be seene nor heard of God, except shee be in the holes of the rocke, and in the secret places os the staires. The rocke, is Christ. The staires also and the ladder, whereby Iacob climb's vp to heauen is Christ. So that the doue, which is the Church, lying hid in the holes of this rocke, and in the secret places of these

staires, dreadeth nothing, but with great boldnes, why doe I say boldnes? yea with great ioy, with great comfort, sheweth her selfe to God, and speaketh vnto him. Here the sparrow findeth her a house, and the swallow a nest, where shee may lay her young, euen thine altar, that is thy wounds, whereby thou didst offer vp thy selfe, as a sacrifice for our sinnes, euen thine altars, O Lord of hosts, my King, and my God. When Elias flying from Achab came to Beersheba, he sate downe vnder a iuniper tree, and desired that he might die. A iuniper tree maketh the hoatest coale,

onely shadow of the iuniper tree sleeth and killeth serpents. Therefore Elias seeking to rest himselfe where he might be safest from serpents, and other daungers, sat down vnder a iuniper tree, and desired that he might die: For he thought he could neuer with the sparrow finde him a house, and with the swallow make him a nest, in a better place, thē where he was ouershadowed with that Iuniper tree, which shadowed out the tree of the crosse of Christ. Of which the Church say's, Vnder his shadow had I delight, and sat downe, and his fruite was sweete vnto my mouth. So that if Simeon holding the child in his armes, desired to die, how much more blessedly then might Elias haue departed now in peace, when as beeing wearied with the world, he was shadowed with the tree of life, and not onely held the child in his armes, but also was held himselfe as a child in the wounded and naken armes of Christ.

Christ is not vnlike to the poole in Ierusalem, called Bethesda, hauing fiue porches, vvhichIoh. 5. 2. beeing troubled by an angell, healed any man, that vvent first into it, vvhatsoeuer disease he had. Bethesda signifieth the house of effusion or povvring out, in vvhich house Christ dvvelt vvhē he povvred out his blood and his soule for our saluation. Therefore hee alone is the angell, vvhich came dovvne at a certaine season into the poole, and troubled the vvater, because vvhen the fulnes of time was come, he came into the world to be troubled himselfe, and to be crucified, that he might heale not onely that one man which had bin diseased eight and thirtie yeares, but euen

all mankinde with the troubled water and blood which issued out of his side. So that there is nothing so comfortable for sicke and sinnefull men, as to sit in the seats and porches of this poole. Wonderfull are the words of the Prophet concerning Christ, He shall feede his flocke like a shepheard, he shall gatherEs. 40. 11. the lambs with his armes, and carie thē in his bosom. Which was prefigured in the high Priest, who did beare vp with his shoulders a breast-plate, wherin were the names of the twelue tribes written in twelue precious stones. That which the shepheard doth with his armes and bosom: that which the high Priest doth with his shoulders & breast: that doth Christ with his hands and side. He is the good shepheard, which bringeth home the lost sheepe vpon his shoulders. Yea he writeth the names of all his sheepe in his pretious wounds, which are the pretious stones vpon his breast-plate, that both declare his loue to vs, & also allure vs to loue him. This makes Dauid say in great deuotion, The Lord is my shepheard, therefore

can I lacke nothing. He shall feede me in a greene pasture, and lead me forth beside the waters of comfort. For as the henne gathereth her brood vnder her wings: so God gathereth his children together. And as an eagle stirreth vpDeut. 3

But yet we shall not alwaies drinke of this fruit of the vine. The time will come, when we shall drinke a new kinde of wine in Christs kingdome. Wherefore he saies, As often as ye shal eate this bread, and drinke this cup, you shall shew the Lords death til he come. Till he come. Declaring hereby, that when he is come, his death shall be shewed an other way. Namely by his wounds, which alwaies he sheweth to his Saints. Euen as vve sing in that heauenly Hymne or Psalme, The humble suit of a sinner; Whose bloody wounds are yet to see, though not with mortall eye, yet doe thy Saints behold them all, and so I trust shall I.

shall see Christ in his kingdome, and behold those blessed wounds of his, whereby he hath purchased so many, and so great good things for vs? This is the new wine, which we shall drinke. This is the Eucharist of the Angels: the food of the Elect: the spirituall banket of the Saints. For wheresoeuer the dead bodie is, thither fhall the eagles resort. And we that with eagles wings flie vp by faith into heauen, shall euer resort to this dead bodie, and we shall vnsatiably desite to feede our eyes and our soules with the sight of Christ, who was once dead, and euen now hath in his bodie those skarres which continue the memorie of his death, that in all eternitie it may neuer be forgotten. Thus these heauenly wounds of Christ delight and comfort his friends. As the cities of refuge, which saue the sinner: as the holes of the rock, which defend the doue: as the shadow of the iuniper tree, which reuiueth the wearied: as the doore of the Arke, which preserueth the world: as the lure of the soule, which calleth home the Shulamite: as the pot of Manna,

which nourisheth the Israelite: as the well of Iacob, which refresheth the

               ealeth the sicke: as the armes of the shepheard, which gather his lambs: as the wings of the eagle, which beare vp her birds. So doe the hands and side of Christ comfort his friends. As if our Sauiour should say thus to euery one of his friends, Can a woman forget her child, and not haue compassion on the son of her wombe? though they should forget, yet would not I forget thee. Behold I haue grauen thee vpon the palmes of my hands. Here I haue still in my hands that price of thy redemption, which I paid for thee, so that no man can take thee out of my hands. Yea I haue written and sealed thy saluation in my side. A speare is the penne: my blood is the inke: my bodie is the paper. Here thou maist see the bowels of my compassion, thorough the wounds of my passion. Assure thy selfe therfore, assure thy selse of my loue, of my good will, of my fauour for euer. Make no doubt of it. If thou doubt any thing,

Put thy finger here, and see my hands, and put forth thy hand, and put it into my side, and be not faithlesse, but faithful. So much for the fourth cause, which is to comfort his friends.
            You see then, blessed Christians, you see how these causes of Christs wounds differ one from an other. The first cause, to approoue his resurrection, was, but neither is, nor shall be. The second cause, to appease his father, was, and is, but shall not be. The third cause, to confound his enemies, neither was, nor is, but shall be. The fourth cause, to comfort his friends, both was, and is, and shall be. So that Christs wounds, did serue, to approoue his resurrection, onely between his resurrection, and his ascension: doe serue, to appease his father, onely between his ascension, & his second comming: shal serue, to confoūd his enemies, onely at the day of iudgement: did, doe, and shall serue, to comfort his friends, for euer. Wherefore though we be neuer so great sinners, yet let vs neuer despaire of the grace and mercie of Christ. His hands are still

stretched out to embrace vs, his side is alwaies open to receiue vs. Therefore let vs creepe low, and come humbly to him, that we may with the woman in the Gospel, touch but the hemme of his garment, nay that we may with S. Iohn, leane vpon his blessed bosome, yea that we may with S. Thomas in this place, put our fingers into his hands, and our hands into his side. And euen as Constantine the great vsed to kisse that eye of Paphnutius which was boared out in Maximinus time, and the Iayler in the Acts washed S. Pauls stripes & wounds: so let vs kisse the Sonne least he be angrie, & honour his holy wounds, which are the pretious balme wherewith he hath healed vs and restored vs to euerlasting life. To the which we beseech thee, O good Lord to bring vs, not for our owne deserts or merits, but for the tender bowels of Christ Iesus loue and mercie toward vs, to whome with the Father, and the holy Ghost, be all honour and praise both now and for euermore, Amen.

course, and walke in the right way himselfe. He must be both the horseman that teacheth, & the chariot that doth, both the horseman and the chariot of Israel. Therefore he hath vpon the fringesExod. 39. 25. of his vesture pomgranats and bells. Many preachers are full of bells which make a great ringing and gingling, but because they haue not pomgranats as well as bels, therefore all the noise that they make is but as sounding brasse, or as a tinckling cymball. For the godly pastor must not only say well, and sound out the word of the Lord to others clearely as a bell, but also he must doe well. and as a pomegranate be fruitfull himselfe and full of good workes.

hauing no corruption, no rottennes in their liues. Hereupon our Lord, speaking to his Prophet saies, Lift vp thy voice as a trumpet. Diuers things there are which sound louder then a trumpet, The sea, the thunder, or such like. Yet he saies not, Lift vp thy voice as the sea, or lift vp thy voice as the thunder, but lift vp thy voice as a trumpet. BecauseEsa. 58. 1. a trumpeter when he sounds his trumpet, he winds it with his mouth, and holds it vp with his hands: and so a Preacher which is a spirituall trumpeter, must not onely by teaching wel, sound forth the word of life with his mouth, but also by doing well he must support it, and hold it vp with his hands. And then doth he lift vp his voice as a trumpet. Those mysticall beasts in Ezekiel,Ezek. 1. 8. which S. Gregorie vnderstandeth to be the ministers of the Church, had hands vnder their wings. Many preachers are full of feathers, and can soare aloft iu a speculatiue kind of discoursing: but if you should search for hands vnder their wings, perhaps you should scarse find many times so much as halfe

a hand amongst them. But the godly pastor must haue not onely wings of high wisedome and knowledge, but also hands vnder his wings to doe that which he knoweth. For as the Prophet Malachie witnesseth, The Priests lipsMal 2. 7. should keepe knowledge. He saies not, they should babble or vtter knowledge to others, and haue no care to keepe it themselues. But hauing deliuered it to others, they must as well as others obserue and doe it themselues. And then indeede may their lips rightly be said to keepe knowledge. For euen as they which repaired the walls of Ierusalem, held a sword in one hand and wroughtN

Els they shall pull downe and destroy rather then build vp. But if they doe as fast as they say, then they shall build apaee, and edifie verie much. Therefore Saint Paul exhorteth Timothie

to shew himselfe a workeman,2. Tim. 2. 25. which needeth not to be ashamed, diuiding the word of God aright. He must not onely be a word-man, but also a work-man. He must not onely hold a sword in one hand, to diuide the word of God aright, but also labour with the other hand, and

Holsome words is sound teaching: the true patterne of holsome words, is well doing. So that he shewes the true patterne of holsome words, which patternes & samples his teaching by doing, making them both matches & paires, so that (as Marke the Eremite

And thus must euery faithfull preacher doe. He must haue not only a brest-plate, but also an Ephod: he must haue written in this brest-plate, not onely Vrim, but

also Thummim: he must be like the snuffers of the tabernacle, not only purging others, but also made of pure gold himselfe: he must haue for his share of the sacrifices not onely the shake-brest, but also the right shoulder: he must be as Elias was, not onely the horseman, but also the chariot of Israel: he must haue vpon the fringes of his vesture, not onely bells, but also pomgranats▪ he must be like the pillars of the tabernacle, not onely ouerlai'd outwardly with gold, but also inwardly made of Shittim woode: he must not onely lift vp his voice, but also lift it vp as a trumpet: he must not onely haue wings, but also hands vnder his wings: he must not onely with his lippes vtter knowledge to others, but also keepe knowledge himsel

                thing if thou knowe it, doe it. It is written of Iulius Caesar, that he neuer said to his souldiers, Ite. but Venite: he neuer said, Goe ye yonder, but Come ye hither: I will goe with you; nay I will goe before you. And so saies our heauenly Captaine and conquerour Iesus Christ, not Ite, but Venite, Come vnto me all ye that labour, and learne of me, because I am meeke and humble in heart. He saies not, because I talke of my humilitie, but because I am humble, because I shewe the practise of it continually in my selfe. I (saies he) came downe from heauen to earth, I left my fathers bosome, and tooke a traytours kisse, to teach all men true humilitie. Therefore there is no teacher to me, there is no master to me: Learne of me, because I am mecke and humble in heart. This

kind of instruction both by teaching and by doing, is that two-edged sword, which proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lambe. For tell me I pray you (if it be no trouble to you) tell me, what is the reason thinke you, why so many Preachers in their Churches, so many masters in their families, secke to redresse abuses, striue against sinnes, and yet preuaile so little, but onely because they fight not with this two-edged sword, but with a backsword. The sword which they fight with all is very sharpe, and cuts deepe on the teaching-side, but it is blunt and hath no edge at all on the doing-side. Wheras if we would fight against vngodlines with this twoedged sword, both by teaching and doing, we should soone cut downe sinne in such sort, as it should neuer be able to stand out against vs. Therefore Dauid beeing readie to reforme many things among his people, saies in one of theBonitatem & sci

teaching without doing, all my knowledge without goodnes, is to no purpose. Theresore O Lord giue me goodnes and knowledge. But first goodnes, and then knowledge. Because indeede, one heartfull of goodnesse, is worth a hundred headfulls of knowledge: one handfull of doing, is worth a hundred tongue-fulls of teaching. For what is the hand else, but the very seale of the tongue? So that as a writing is not pleadable by the law of man without seales; no more is a word warrantable by the law of God, without works.

The twelue Apostles shall sit vpon twelue thrones, iudging the twelue tribes of Israel. And if we can happely obtaine so much grace and goodnes of God, as that we may haue a care and a conscience as well to doe as to teach, then as sure as God's in heauen, we likewise shall be great in the kingdome of heauen. We shall be enstalled with Christ and his Apostles, in the throne of glorie, when we shall heare him say vnto vs, Come ye blessed of my Father, inherite the kingdome of heauen prepared for you. For ye haue not onely professed, but practised: ye haue not onely taught well, but wrought well: ye haue not onely said well, but done well: therefore now you shall be great in the kingdome of heauen.

            A SERMON PREACHED BEFORE the Kings Maiestie at Drayton in Northhamptonshire. August. 6. 1605.
            
               
                  Psal. 132. 18.
               
               As for his enemies I shall cloath them with shame; but vpon himselfe shall his Crowne flourish.
            
            
               THe Royall Prophet hauing setled himselfe in his kingdom according to his owne desire; and besides hauing after many wandrings to and fro, at length brought backe the Arke againe to Ierusalem; maketh here his most zealous and deuout praier to God for the continuance of his fauour both to the Church and Common-wealth

committed to his gouernement. Returne, O Lord, to thy resting place, sai's he, v. 8. & deinceps. thou and the Arke of thy strength. Let thy Priests be cloathed vvith righteousnesse, and let thy Saints sing vvith ioyfulnesse. For thy seruant Dauids sake turne not avvay the face of thine anointed. Novv that he might apparantly see hovv neere the Lord is to all them that call vpon him in faithfulnesse and truth, he vvaiteth not long for an ansvver, but carries it avvay vvith him before he depart. For to Dauids petition, Returne O Lord, vnto thy resting place, thou, and the arke of thy strength; Gods ansvver is this, v 1

                  . This shall be my resting place, here vvill I dvvell, for I haue a delight therein. I vvill blesse her victualls vvith increase, and vvill satisfie her poore vvith breade. To Dauids petition, Let thy Priests be cloathed vvith righteousnesse, and let thy Saints sing vvith ioyfulnesse; Gods ansvver is this, I vvill cloath her Priests vvith saluation, and her Saints shall reioyce and sing. Lastly, to Dauids petition; For thy seruant Dauids sake turne not

away the face of thine anointed: Gods answer is this; There shall I make the horne of Dauid to flourish, I, I haue ordained a light for mine anointed. As for his enemies, I shall cloath them with shame; but vpon himself shal his crown slorish. As if he should haue said; Turne away the face of mine anointed? Nay, that will I neuer doe, I will indeede turne away the face of the enemies of mine anointed. Their face shall be couered with confusion, and cloathed with shame: But contrariwise, I haue ordained a light for mine anointed. He euer shall haue a light in his face, and a crowne vpon his head. As for his enemies, I shall cloth them with shame; but vpon himselfe shall his crowne flourish.
            These words are principally to be vnderstood of Christ. For neuer were any so cloathed with shame as his enemies the cursed Iewes which murthered him. There eitie was sacked, not one stone of it beeing left vpon another, and they themselues as stubble or chaffe were scattered ouer the face of the earth.

So that they are the very shame of men, and the out-cast of all people. Insomuch as when we would signifie we hate a man deadly, indeede we commonly vse to say, we hate them worse then a Iewe. On the other side Christ is so exalted now, that all power is giuen him in heauen and earth, yea God hath giuen him a name aboue al names, that at the most sweete and most excellent name of Iesus, euerie knee and euerie heart also might doe obeysance. And as the Apostle prooueth out of the eight Psalme, The Lord now after all his dolorous paines and torments, hath crowned him with honour and glorie. Neuerthelesse in a secondarie sort this promise may be applyed also to Dauid, who was a notable type of Christ; and so consequently to euerie faithfull successor of Dauid, which is Christs vicegerent and liefienant vpon earth. For yee knowe what vvas the ende of all Dauids enemies: Absolom his disobedient sonne hung vp by the goldylockes of pride. Achitophel his travterous Counsellor made

            Here are two parts. His enemies; himselfe. His enemies, first shall haue shame; secondly shall be cloathed with shame. Himselfe, first shal haue a crown: secondly shal haue a flourishing crown. As for his enemies I shall cloth them with shame; but vpon himselfe shall his crowne flourish.

This, diuerse valiant worthies haue shewed to be true, ridding themselues voluntarily of their life, that so they might be rid of their shame. Aiax beeing readie to dispatch himselfe, vsed these as his last words; No greife doth so

cut the very heart of a generous and magnanimous man, as shame and reproach. What should I speake of any more Grecians, or Romanes, as of Brutus, Cassius, Antonius, Cato Vticensis, and such others? In Scripture we haue a plaine proofe. Mightie Sampson, beeingI

He desired rather once to die valiantly, then long to liue wretchedly. For as Saint Ambrose writing of Samson, saith,

Yet the Lord God promiseth Dauid his anointed that shame shall be the reward of all his enemies; shame I say, which is a great deale worse then death it selfe.

               hame. To be clothed is an Hebrew phrase, signifying to haue any thing vnseparably cast vpon one. And it is taken both in the better and in the worser part. As a little before; I cloath her Preists with saluation: that is, I will furnish Syons Priests with such indowments and graces from aboue, which they shall be as it were inuested into; that both by their life and doctrine, they shall still further the saluation both of themselues, and of them which heare them. Contrariwise, in this place, I will cloath them with shame; That is, shame shall so vnseparably accompanie them, that as wheresoeuer a man goeth, he carrieth his cloathes with him; so wheresoeuer they goe, they shall carrie their shame with them. And that which is strangest of all; they which are ashamed vse to cloath or couer their shame, and then thinke themselues well enough. But Dauids enemies shall be so shamed, that euen the very couering of their shame shall

be a discouering of it; and the clothing or cloking of their ignominie, shall be nothing else but a girding of it more closely and more vnseparably vnto them. So the Prophet speaketh elsewher

            Now as for shame in the world, we reade Gen. 4. 5. that God did set a marke vpon Cain the murtherer of iust Habel; and so consequently the ring-leader of all Dauids enemies. Therefore as when men see a wolfe or a foxe, or any such hurtfull beast in the forest, they set all their dogges vpon him; so the enemies of the Lords anoynted, beeing burnt as it were and branded with the markes of shame, are howted and hunted wheresoeuer they goe. One example at this time shall suffice. Maxentius a wicked rebell against his owne Lord the famous Emperour Constantine the great, deuised to haue a bridge made with cock-boats chained together ouer a riuer neere Rome, thinking to traine the Emperour that vvay, and there to

And so as Pharaoh was cloathed with shame in the open view and sight of all the world, when he and all his host were drowned in the redde sea, after the same fashion Maxentius was drest.
            Lastly, touching shame in the day of iudgement, Dauids enemies at that day, shall stand before the tribunall seat of Christ, beeing naked in all respects else, but onely couered with their owne shame. Then they shall be vexed with horrible feare S

            The one halfe of this Sermon is now past, the other shalbe as soone dispatcht. But vpon him shall his crowne slourish.

long before that 2. 
                     〈◊〉
                  . 1. 10 the Amalakite brought him a crowne, which he took from Sauls head when he slewe him.
            So that the thing God promiseth is this; that any crowne which king Dauid should get, either by conquest, or by succession, or by any other iust title, should still slourish more and more. Some there are in the world which to be sure of outward ornaments inough, will needes weare a triple crowne. Others haue beene vnwilling to weare that one which they might. Canutus, that was absolute king almost of fiue kingdomes somewhat before the conquest, vpon a time in his progresse riding neere the Thames, lighted and sat downe besides the shoare. Then, as it were to trie a conclusion, he commanded the water beeing now readie to arise againe and to slow, not to come any neerer him. But the water keeping his naturall course, came still vp higher and higher, till it beganne to wette him. Whereupon turning to his Nobles, which were about him, Ye call me (
                  •…
               aies he) your king and Master, & so indeede

I am; and yet loe yee, I cannot command so much as this little streame, but doe what I can, that will still doe as it list. Whereupon presently he posted to Westminster, and resigned his crown to the crucifixe there; neither could he euer after this be perswaded to weare it any more. Now as the pride of that man of sinne, which sits vnder the signe of the triple crowne, is too intolerable: so on the contrarie part this was too much nicenesse in Canutus. Seeing, it followeth not, because he could not cō
               mand the sea and the waters, as Christ did, that therefore he might not weare a crowne. For, neither doth Christ himselfe in heauen weare such a crowne, as kings of the earth doe. But the truth is this, that royaltie and maiestie, which is essentiall to God, he is content to communicate to his holy ones, and to his anointed, by participatiō and grace. Therefore the Lords anointed, which is as it were his fauourite, may verie well doe all these three things at once; weare the crowne which God giueth; and yet detest the pride which God abhorreth;

and still admire the Maiestie, which God enioyeth: So that the Lord promising his seruant Dauid a crowne, promiseth him wealth, wisedome, renowne, dignitie, prosperitie; in one word, all royalties belonging to a crowne. But vpon himselfe shall his crowne slourish.
            Secondly, he shall haue a flourishing crowne. Flourishing is metaphorically attributed to a crowne. As in the next verse before. There shall I make the horne of Dauid to 
                  •…
               lourish. A metaphor taken from those goodly creatures, as stagges, and such like; whose chiefest beautie and strengh consisteth in their hornes, especially when they bud and branch abroad. So in these words, But vpon himselfe shall his crowne slourish. A plaine allusion to those slowres which either continually, or els a verie long time, keepe fresh and greene. Besids at the first, kings crowns were not made of gold and pearles, as I told you of Dauids crowne, but onely of greene oken leaues, as that of Iupiters, or else of some other branches

or flowres, as others. The Lord then meaning that Dauids kingdome should be established for euer, and that his lasting glorie should still growe greene, he maketh this louing promise vnto him; But vpon himselfe shall his crowne flourish. How flourishing beautifull flowers are, consider but the Lillie, and you shall soone perceiue. Marke (saies our Sauiour) Ma

Reg. 7. 49.; so the

Lord here giues his word, that the kings crowne shall euer flourish in the house of our God, disparkling and displaying those rayes of Maiestie; those beames of beautie, which shall amaze the world, and be a wonder as well to Angels as to men: Wherefore, as I said euen nowe of his enemies shame, that it shall be threefold; so here I repeat the same againe of his crownes flourishing; His crowne shall flourish in his owne conscience: in the world: in the day of iudgement.

                Now, if this precious vessell of honour reioyced in nothing so much, as in the testimonie of his conscience, that in simplicitie and godly purenesse, and not in fleshly wisedome, but by the grace of God, he had his conueration

in the world, the power of Gods spirit working still most mightily by his ministerie to the conuersion of the world to Christ: how much more shall the Lords anoynted haue his conscience crowned with flourishing ioy, with comfort, with content, with heauenly peace, when he shall remember, that not onely sor matters of religion and Gods true seruice, he hath beene and still is with Saint Paul prositable to the Church; but also is a strong bulwarke and a tower of defence to maintaine euen the outward

As for his enemies, I shall cloath them with shame; but vpon himselfe shall his crowne flourish.
            To draw then to an ende; it may seeme very strange, that Dauid had any enemies. Yet, out of these words, As for his enemies, I shall cloath them with shame; it may well be gathered, that some he had. What? had Dauid? meeke Dauid? Lord remember Dauid, and all his meeke

                  le. Yet this meeke Dauid, patient Dauid, mercifull Dauid, valiant and victorious Dauid, holy Dauid, had enemies. Wherefore you most honourable and blessed seruants of God, you that excell in vertue, if you haue some enemies, thinke not strange of it. For, if you had nothing in you: no feare of God, no reuerēce towards his word, no loue and loyaltie towards your Soueraigne, no fortitude, no temperance, no good thing in you; you might perhaps walke on long enough, and no man enuie you, no man maligne you, or malice you. But because God hath inspired you with his principall spirit, and endewed you with speciall great graces aboue your fellowes: therefore doth your aduersarie the Deuill the old enemie of all goodnes and vertue, who is readie to burst to see you doe so well: he, I say, doth bestirre himselfe, and raise vp enemies against you. But (O blessed be our good Lord) what a wonderfull

               e all you; what a horrible terrour & affrightment haue all your enemies, in this text? For the holy Ghost saies not, They shall be clothed, or you shall cloth them: but I, euen I shal cloth them with shame. It is impossible, saies he, that you should alwaies be armed at all points, circumspect at all places, vigilant at all times, prouided at all occasions, to preuent the mischieuous practises of your deuillish enemies. No counsell of man, no policie, no wisdome, no wit, can foresee all their barbarous vndertakings and complottes, to escape them. But in heauen, in heauen there is an eye, an hand there is in heauen: an eye to descrie them, and a hand to persecure and punish them: both an eye and an hand to deliuer you from daunger, and to cloath them with shame. Therefore, saith he, Cast your care vpon me: let me alone with them, your perill is my perill, your case my case: Ile pay them that they haue deserued: He take the quarrell into mine owne

As for your enemies, I shall cloath them with shame. Remēber I pray you, beloued, though indeede, they haue made themselues worthie neuer to be remembred, or once to be mentioned in our mouthes any more; yet remember, I say, to their egregious dishonour & reproch, how those are now clothed with shame, who were the first cause of the solemnizing, or as I may say, of the sanctifying of this present day for the day of the weeke, and of yesterday for the day of the moneth, & of the twelue moneth, with so holy an exercise? How odious? how execrable is their very name vnto vs? what true hearted loyall subiect, such as I am sure all are here, doth not detest them, hate them, loath them, as a toad, or as a viper, or as some hidious mishapen monster; and curse the very day wherein such a rebellious generation, and such a trayterous brood were borne? Certainly, my good brethren, if the mercie of God, which is incomprehensible, did not giue them grace, at the last gaspe to repent and crie to God for pardon: as they are

cloathed with shame in this world, so shall they be much more in the world to come. And as we hold them for no better then cursed creatures, so shall the Lord at last, say vnto them, Goe ye cursed into euerlasting fire. So let it be, o Lord, euen so to all the enemies of thine a

            But vpon himselfe shall his Crowne flourish.
            These words, vpon himselfe, either are altogether impertinent and superfluous, or else they are very important and materiall. For, it had beene sufficient to haue saide; As for his enemies I shall cloath them with shame: but as for himselfe, his

               lourish vpon himselfe. Yet the Lord in his gratious answer vnto Dauids praier, thought good to put in this as a supernumerarie word, ouer and besides the necessitie of the sentence: to teach the good King,

and vs all likewise, a very notable lesson. Namely, that he would blesse the crowne, the dignitie, the flourishing estate of his louing seruant, not onely in his owne person, and his posteritie; in this world, and in the world to come, as I haue shewed alreadie, but also from a lesser weight of glory, still to a greater and greater. Vpon himselfe, saies he, shall his crowne flourish. For not onely it shall be as flourishing, as Dauid left it, at the day of his departure to God; but after his dissolutiō and death: as fa

subiect, that is saithfull to God, and to his Prince; as he goeth on forward to God, by the peace, and by the religion which he hath enioyed vnder his Prince; so he shall still beautifie and decke Dauids crowne; & one shall bring a white rose, another shall bring a red rose, and adde it to the crowne: that so vpon himselfe still his crowne may slourish, the white rose and the redde rose, that are in the crowne alreadie, beeing euer made more and more fragrant and slourishing. O Christ, what a crowne is this? And what will it growe to much more in the ende? You that are mighty Kings and Potentates vpon earth, haue indeede great cares and continuall businesse in your heads; but yet vouchsafe I pray you to hearken a little, what I shal say vnto you. You watch oftentimes ouer vs, when we are asleepe our selues. You care for our peace, when it is not in our power to further it; you procuring good to Sion, and prosperitie to Ierusalem, yet many times enioy the least part of it your selues. But no force. Take this still for your comfort. We

that cannot all our liues long doe the hundreth part of that good vvhich you doe euery houre, shall haue nothing so flourishing a crovvne as you shall haue. Vpon you, vpon you shall euerlasting peace rest, vpon you shall the glorie of Gods Maiestie shine, vpon you, vpon you shall your crovvne slourish. Which the Lord of his mercie graunt, I most humbly beseech him for Iesus Christs sake: that as Dauids crovvne euer slourished, till the first comming of Christ: so our gratious Kings crovvne may euer flourish, till the second comming of Christ: and then, that afterward for euer his royall Maiestie, may be roy ally crovvned vvith eternall life: thorough the same our deare Sauiour Iesus Christ: to vvhom vvith the father and the holy Ghost, be all honour and glo rie, povver and praise, dignitie and dominion, novv and euermore.

            Here are three properties of good ground set downe. All opposite to the three bad grounds mentioned before. First, they that are good ground, heare the word with a good h

               rt; contrarie to the ground on the high waies side, which when they haue heard, let the deuill take the word out of their hearts, & so they heare not with a good heart. Secondly, they keepe the word with a verie good heart; contrarie to the stony ground, which for a while receiue the word with ioy, but in time of temptation they fall away, and so they keepe not the word with a verie good heart. Thirdly, they bringe foorth fruit with patience; contrary to the thornie ground, which after their departure are choaked vvith cares,

and bring no fruit, and so doe not (as it is said here that the good ground doth) bring forth fruit with patience. But that which fell in good ground are they, which with a good, and a very good heart, heare the word, and keepe it, and bring forth fruit with patience.
            The first propertie of the good ground is this, that they heare the word with a good heart. The two disciples going to Emans, when Christ

O Beloued, nowe you are busied in hearing the word, Christ talketh to you, and you are in the right way to heauen. Therefore that we may heare with a good heart, we must feele in our hearts that burning of which the disciples say; Did not our hearts burne within vs when he talked with vs by the way? For so the Spirituall spouse confesseth of her selfe, My beloued put his hand to the hole of the doore, and my heart was affectioned towards him. And againe:

My soule melted when my beloued spake. Now Christ puts his hand to the hole of the doore, desiring himselfe to enter, and vs to repent: now our beloued speaketh to vs out of his word. So that we cannot be good ground, except our heart be affectioned, and our soule melt towards him. When the blessedLu

mightie Kings and Potentates of the world, shew such a good heart in hearing the word, & we in the meane time haue lumpish and dul spirits and affections, and are neuer a whit mooued? Certainly ye honourable children of God, now Christ talketh with vs by the way, therefore let our hearts burne within vs: now Christ putteth his hand to the hole of the doore, therefore let our hearts be affectioned towards him: now our welbeloued speaketh, therefore let our soules melt: now the blessed virgin, yea a greater then the virgin, euen the virgins Sonne, saluteth vs, and wisheth vs all haile out of his word, therefore let the babe spring in our hearts for ioy: now the Almightie vttereth his voice, therefore let our wings fall downe, and let vs wholly submit our selues to be taught of God. Euen as Cornelius the Centurion thought when he heard Peter preach, that he stood not before a man, but before the Lord: and Constantine the Emperour could neuer satisfie himselfe with reuerent attention of his good heart to the word. Then indeede

shall we be good ground as all they are which with a good, and a very good heart heare the word, and keepe it, and bring forth fruit with patience.
            The second propertie of the good ground is this, that they keepe the word with a very good heart. In our EnglishCorde bono & optimo. Vulga. translation it is read thus, with a good and an honest heart. But I follow the vulgar Latin, which readeth thus; With a good and a very good heart. And I referre the good heart to hearing, the very good heart to keeping: As if the words stood thus; Which with a good heart, heare the word, and with a very good heart keepe it, and bring forth fruit with patience. To the matter then: It is to no purpose that the seede be sowne, except it be couered in the earth. Neither that the word be heard, except it be kept. Therefore saith the Prophet, In my heart haue I hidde thyPsal. 119. word, that I may not sinne against thee. So that to keepe the word with a very good heart, is to hide and couer this holy seede in the fallow grounds of our heart, beeing plowed vp by the preaching

of the Gospel. Whereupon the kingdom of heaue

               ud. No otherwise shall we be accōpted vncleane in the sight of God, if we chew not the cud as it were, and ruminate, and meditate of those things which we haue heard out of the word. For euen as it is not auaileable to eate, except the meate be inwardly digested and diuided to all the parts of the bodie: so hearing is vnprofitable, vnlesse the word heard be kept in minde and memorie, and shewed and set forth in all the parts of our life. Therefore they

of Berraea were esteemed more nobleAct. 17. 11. then they of Thessalonica, because they after Paul had preached to them, conferred among themselues, and searched the Scriptures, not onely to see whether the Apostles doctrine were warrantable by the word, but also to confirme their owne memorie, and to exercise their meditation in the Law of God. Now then ye holy ones of God, if we would be good ground indeede, as the Patriarch Iacob noted his sonne IosephsGen. 37. 11. dreames; so let vs not onely heare, but also note the word. For this is proper to the child of God, to haue the law of his God in his heart. Not noted in writing tables, or written in tables of stone, but noted & written in the fleshie tables of the heart. And euen as the holy virgin kept all those sayings, and ponderedLuk. 2. 19. them in her heart, which were by the Shepheards reported and published abroad concerning her sonne Iesus: in like manner they that are wise vvill heare, nay they vvill ponder and keepe those things vvhich they haue heard, that so they may the better vnderstand

the louing kindnesse of the Lord. Especially seeing those things vvhich vve heare are no dreames, but vnsearchable mysteries of our saluation: neither are vve that publish and preach them, such shepheards as the Angel spake vnto, but vve are appointed to vvatch ouer the flocke vvhich Christ hath bought vvith his blood. Therefore if you vvould shevv your selues to be good ground, your very good heart must be as a field that hath a treasure hid in it: yea it must be as a treasure it selfe that hath old and nevv things hid in it: it must be as a candle that neuer goes out: and as a cleane creature that neuer leaues chevving the cudde: euen as Iacob noted his sonnes dreames, and the blessed virgin kept the shepheards sayings and pondered them in her heart. For they onely are good ground vvhich vvith a good, and a very good heart, heare the vvord, and keepe it, and bring forth fruit vvith patience.
            The third propertie of the good ground is this, that they bring forth fruit vvith patience. Good ground is

like a good tree. For indeede good ground will make a good tree. Now a good tree bringeth forth good fruit. And the blessed man which meditateth day and night in Gods law, is like a tree

So that it is not enough for the word to goe in at one eare, and out at the other, but it must goe in at both eares by reuerent and religious hearing, and settle deepely into the heart by faithfull and diligent keeping, and lastly goe out at both hands, by bringing forth fruit with patience.

A cypres tree is high, but barren: an oliue is fruitfull but low▪ So a Christian, must not onely as a cypres tree, reach vp to the clouds by meditation of high mysteries in the word, but also he must as an oliue tree bring forth fruit with patience. Then he shal be like Simeon, neither low, nor barren. But though he be an oliue, yet he shall be as high as the cvpres tree:

and though he be a cypresse yet he shall be as fruitfull as the oliue tree. NoahGen.

At the windowe of contēplation he must meditate, with a very good heart to keepe the word: at the doore of action he must go out to bring forth fruit with patience.

it is bootelesse, and the lauer wanting a base is altogether vnprofitable. The Prophet Isaiah is willed to liftEsai. 58. 1. vp his voice like a trumpet. Many things sound lowder then a trumpet, as the sea, the thunder, and such like. Yet he saies not; List vp thy voice as the sea, or lift vp thy voice as the thunder; but lift vp thy voice as a trumpet. Why so? Because a trumpeter when he sounds his trumpet, he windes it with his mouth, and holds it vp with his hand. And so euery faithfull heart, which is as it were a spirituall trumpet to sound out the praises of God; must not onely report them with his mouth, but also support them with his hand. And then indeede holding vp the word of life with his hand, and bringing forth the fruit therof with patience, he shall lift vp his voice like a trumpet. The Patriarch Abraham buried Sarah in the caue ofGe
                     •…
                  . 23. 19. Macpelah, that is in a double sepulchre. He that buries his mind in knowledge onely, without any care of bringing forth fruit, he buries Sarah in a single sepulchre, as Philo Iudaeus doth allegorize

vpon this storie; but he that burieth his minde as well in the performance and practise of religion (which is all in all) as in the knowledge and vnderstanding of it, he buries Sarah in a double sepulchre. And so must all we doe, which are the true children of Abraham. For then with Abraham burying our spirit in a double sepulchre, we shal with Elizeus haue a double spirit. A spirit that heareth the word with a verie good heart, and with patience bringeth forth fruite. Neither is this addition (with patience) altogether to be omitted. For though a man cannot heare the word without patience, nor keepe the word without patience, yet patience is neuer so requisite, as in bringing forth fruit according to the word which we haue heard, and kept. Wherefore the holy Ghost saith; Ye haue neede ofHeb. 10. 36. patience, that after ye haue done the will of God, ye may receiue the promise. He saies not, After ye haue heard it with your eare, or kept it with your memorie: but after ye haue done the will of God, and brought forth the fruit

thereof, yee may receiue the promise. For wherefore did not the stonie groūd bring forth fruite, but onely for want of patience. They receiued the word with ioy, and seemed to haue verie good hearts for a time: but in time of temptation for want of patience they fell away. Wherefore did not the thorny ground bring forth fruit, but onely for want of patience? After their departure wanting patience to digest their griefes they were choked with cares, and so brought forth no fruit. Therefore as a good field must endure many a cold frost & snow, and hard vveather in the winter time; before it can yeeld a fruitfull croppe in Summer: semblably 
                  •…

He must like a good tree, bring forth good fruite he must

with Simeon be not onely high as the cypresse, but also fruitfull as the oliue: he must with Noah make him, not only a windowe for contemplation, but also a doore for action: he must with Moses, make him a lauer with a base: he must with Esay lift vp his voice like a trumpet; he must with Abraham bury Sarah in a double sepulchre: in one word he must alwaies bring forth fruit with patience. For they onely are good ground which with a good, and a verie good heart heare the word, and keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.
            To conclude then, It is not greatly needefull to exhort you with a good heart to heare the word. Neuer heretofore such diligent hearing in the Court, as now a dayes. I dare be bold to say it; All the preachers in England, in verie many yeares by all their exhortations, could neuer haue done halfe so much good in this kind, as the one onely, holy, and happy example hath done, which we see euery day before our eies. Neither need ye be greatly put in mind to keepe in mind the word heard. Memorie

ye haue enough, vnderstanding enough, knowledge enough, learning enough: When you haue heard a Sermon, you can remember and repeat, and carrie away, and keepe much of it. But this, this is the thing which I must

But this water we must carrie away with vs, and keepe it to wash and purge our consciences, to clense our wayes, to water the roots of Gods graces in vs continually, that we may bring forth fruit with patience. Rachel also, that other holy woman, did not desire the mandrakes so much to hold it in her hand, or to smell

To teach vs, that we must not labour so much to knowe the word, that we may subtilly dispute or discourse of it, as to practise it that we may shewe the fruite of it in the amendment of our liues. Therefore king Dauid beeing readie to redresse diuers things among his people, saith in one of the Psalmes; O Lord, teach me goodnesse, and knowledge: knowledge, that I may keepe thy word; and goodnesse that I may shewe the fruit of it. For I am sure, saies he, that al my keeping without fructifying, all my knowledge without goodnesse, is to no purpose. Wherefore, ó Lord, giue me goodnesse and knowledge. But first goodnesse, and then knowledge. Because indeede a little goodnesse, though it be neuer so small, is better then all knowledge, though neuer so great. One handfull of goodnesse is worth an hundred headfulls of knowledge. For the feare of the Lord is the beginning of wisedome, a good vnderstanding haue all they that doe thereafter, the praise of it

They that haue vnderstanding, and doe not thereafter, that is, bring not forth fruit according to it, they haue an ill vnderstanding. But they that haue vnderstanding, and do therafter, & lead their lise according to it, such haue a good vnderstanding. The praise of these shal endure for euer. O how highly shall Christ praise you, how richly shall he reward you, if you haue a conscionable care to expresse his vertues, & to be transformed as it were into the obedience of his word? Then he shall say vnto you; Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdome of heauen. For ye haue not onely heard my word, and kept it as farre as knowledge goes, but also ye haue practised it, and fructified thereby. I was in prison, and ye visited me; I was harbourlesse, and ye lodged me; I was hungry, and ye gaue me meate. These and such other haue beene the good fruites, which haue follovved your hearing and keeping of my word. Therefore

now ye shall be praised for your weldoing, and for euer ye shall be blessed for your fruit-bearing. Which God graunt to vs all for Iesus Christ his sake, to whom with the Father, and the holy Ghost, be all honour and glorie, power and praise, dignitie and dominion, now and euermore. Amen.

            A FVNERALL SERMON PREACHED in S. Maries. May 10. 1605.
            
               
                  Psal. 32. 6.
               
               Surely in the flood of many waters they shall not come neere him.
            
            
               THe principall scope os the Prophet in this place is to prooue, that the righteousnesse, and so the blessednesse of man, consisteth onely in the free forgiuenes of his sinnes, and gratious imputation of Christs merits. His argument may be framed thus; That which the whole Church and euery godly man therein hath euer especially praied for in all afflictions and

troubles, that is happinesse: But for remission of sinnes euery godly man will 
                  •…
               ray in time of tribulation: Therefore this is the felicitie of the faithfull. To confirme this reason more fully he setteth downe, first, the circumstances going before the prayer; For this shall euery one that is godly make his prayer vnto thee in a time when thou maist be found. Then, the forme of the prayer it selfe; Thou art a place to hide me in, thou shalt preserue me from trouble, thou shalt compasse me about with 
                  •…
               ongs of deliuerance. Lastly, the effect following the prayer; Surely in the flood of many waters they shall not come neere him.
            Prayer is the true sacrifice of faith. The efficacie whereof is briefly, but pithily set downe to the Hebrewes. And I haue spoken els-where somewhat largely of this point. Now but a word onely to make a fit entrance into this sermon. Take it therefore thus. The effocts of prayer heretofore haue beene wonderfull. Prayer hath fet down hailestones from heauen, to ouercome fiue

Kings with their armies. Prayer hath shut vp the windowes of heauen that it should not raine, and againe hath opened them that the earth might giue her encrease. Prayer hath staied the swist course of the sunne, and caused it to go backward fifteene degrees. Prayer hath held Gods hands that he could not strike when he was readie to plague his people. Prayer without any other helpe or meanes hath throwne downe the strong walls of Iericho. Prayer hath deuided the sea, that the floods thereof could not come neere the Israelites. In this place it deliuereth the faithful man from all the dangers of this world. Surely in the flood of many waters they shall not come neere him.
            The summe is this; That no calamities of this world, no troubles of this life, no terrours of death, no guiltines of sinne, can be so great, but that a godly man by meanes of his faith and felicitie in Christ, shall wade out of them well inough. For howsoeuer other things goe, still he shall haue such a solace in his soule, such a comfort in his

conscience, such a heauen in his heart, knowing himselfe reconciled to God, and iustified by faith, that Surely in the flood of many waters they shall not come neere him.
            Which, that it may the better appeare, I shall desire you to obserue two things. The danger: the deliuerance. The danger is in these words; In the flood of many waters. Where the tribulations that the godly man is subiect to in this life, are likened, First to waters: then to many waters: thirdly, to a flood of many waters; In the flood of many waters. The deliuerance is in these words; Surely they shall not come neare him. Where the deliuerance of the godly man hath three degrees also. First they shall not come neare: secondly him, they shall not come neare him: then Surely, surely they shall not come neere him. Surely in the flood of many waters, they shall not come neere him.
            First, the asflictions of the faithful are likened to waters. Fire and water haue no mercy we say. But of the two water is

the worst. For any fire may be quenched with water, but the force of water, if it begins to be violent, can not by any power of man be resisted. Canutus who was King of England, Scotland, Denmarke,

                   lib. 7. Norway, and a great part of Suevia all at once, sitting at a low water vpon the Thames shoare, commanded the water not to come neare him. But notwithstanding his commandement, the water returning and flowing againe, as that in Ezekiel which came to the ankles,

Then turning about to his noble men that were there attendant on him, he said, You call me your Soueraigne Lord and Master, and yet I can not command this little channell of water, to keepe aloose osf from me. Whereupon he went immediatly to Westminster, and with his owne hands s

                vpon his owne head. This experience that Canutus so mightie a King made, doth directly

prooue, that no man but God onely can set barres and doores against the water,Iob. 38. 
                     •…
                  1. and say; Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further, and here shalt thou stay thy proud waues. The afslictions of the righteous therefore beeing here compared to waters, must needes be very violent. For thus the Psalmist saith,Psal. 88. 8. Thine indignation lieth hard on me, and thou hast vexed me with all thy waues. And God himselfe; I will powre out my wrath vpon thee, as water. So that the securitie and selicitie of the faithfull man is inuincible. He may be often in daunger of tribulations as of

            But these our tribulations which are waters, are also many waters. Our common prouerb is, Seldome comes sorrow alone. But as waters come rouling and wauing

thrice shipwracke, saies he: night and day haue I bin in the deepe sea. In iourneying I was often, in perills of waters in perills of robbers, in perills of mine owne nation, in perills among the Gentiles, in perills in the citie, in perills in the wildernesse, in perills in the sea, in perills among false brethren. Thus we see how many waters the godly man is subiect to in this life. For one ioy he hath at the least two sorowes, if he haue no more: one deepe calleth an other: one wound bringeth another: he hath sorow vpon sorow: perills vpon perills, Many waters: many dangers. Neuer thelesse, Surely in the flood of many waters, they shall not come neare him.
            Thirdly, the dangers of this life, are as a

so man since the world was so well scoured and scourged with a flood, could neuer almost abide either to talke or thinke of it. Now though our whole life be nothing else but a flood of many waters, yet nothing in the world may more fitly be so called, then our going out of the world. This indeede bringeth with it a

feeling that he was compassed about with the sorrowes of death, beganne to be afraid, and to be in great heauinesse, and he said moreouer, My soule is veryMark. 14. 33. heauie euen to the death. I know well Christ was afraid without sinne, nay with great comfort. For he prayeth thus, Not as I will, but as thou wil
                  •…
               . And againe, Into thy hands I commit my spirit. This then was his comfort, that the Iewes could do nothing in putting him to death, but as S. Peter testifieth, that onely which his father both by his counsell and will had decreed, and by his hand had ordained. Hilarion also that holy antient Father comforteth himselfe with this, that he had serued Christ almost seauentie yeares. Other children of God haue had other comforts, and all haue this, that both in life and in death they are happie in Christ. Howbeit seeing many holy Christians, and euen Christ himselfe feared death, it remaineth that death simply and in it selfe considered, is a flood of many waters. But yet the faithfull man euen in death is out of all danger. Surely in the

floods of many waters, they shall not come neere him.
            Thus much for the first part which is the danger; In the flood of many waters. The second part followeth, which is the deliuerance; Surely, they shall not come neere him.
            First, they shall not come neere. They, that is, The waters shal not come neere. The holy Church and euery member thereof is likened to a house built vpon a rocke. Vpon which though the winds blow, and the floodsMatth. 7. 25. beate, yet it can not be throwne down, because it is built vpon a rocke. So that the floods which shake it, can neuer come neere it to ouerthrowe it. The same may be said of the ship couered with waters. It might well floate, but it could neuer be drowned. For as soone as the Disciples cryed vpon Christ toMatth. 8. 24. saue them, presently there followed a great calme. Therefore Luther when his life was sought of all the world in a manner, translated the Psalme Deus noster refugium, into dumb meerer, andPsal. 46. 1. caused it to be sung in all the reformed

churches. God is our hope a

                  . 19. historical faith, yet we haue the helpe of a second answer. To wit, that shipwrack is one thing, and drowning an other. Therefore faith which is wrackt is not by and by drowned. For it may happen to suffer shipwracke as S. Paul did, and swimme out safe to the shore. But this is but a touch by the way. Meane season we see how safe and secure the faithfull man is in Christ. He is a house to which the floods may come neere to shake it, but neuer to throvve it downe, he is a ship, which the waues may come neere to tosse it, but neuer to turne it ouer: euen as Saint Peter began to sinke, but still kept vp his head: and Saint Paul suffred shippewracke, but was not a haire the worse for it. Surly in the flood of many waters, they shall not come neere him.
            Secondly, him. They shall not come neere him. This word must in no case be omitted. It helpeth vs to answer a verie strong obiection. For it may be

said, Many holy men haue lost their goods, haue suffered great torments in their bodie, haue beene troubled also in minde; how then did not the floods of many waters come neere them? The word Him helpes vs to answer. The verie Philosophers themselues reckoned their goods pertained no more to thē, then be it spoken with reuerence and regard, the parings of their nailes. Zenon hearing newes he had lost all he had by sea, said onely thus; Thou hast

An other called Anaxarchus, when as Nicocreon the tyrant commanded he should be beaten to death in a mortar, spake thus to the executioner; Beate and bray as long as thou wilt Anaxarchus his bagge or sachell (so he called his owne bodie) but Anaxarchus thou canst not touch. Yet these making so smal reckoning of their goods and bodie, set their minde notwithstanding at a high rate. The minde

And if I be iudged, I know I shall be found righteous. And I know whome I haue beleeued, and I am sure.

But the special thing to be noted in this sentence is, As dying, and Behold we liue. For they import, that death is no death, but As it were death, an image, or a shadowe of death: beeing indeede life, and Surely a better life and more immortall then we had here. Therefore he saies, Behold we liue, to shewe that by death the faithfull liue a life wherein there is some great specialty and excellency worthy indeed to be beholded & regarded. As if he should say; Behold we liue, Behold we liue a more happy life, then euer we liued in our life. S. Augustin often commēdeth the sayingNon ita

                  ius of his master S. Ambrose when he was readie to die. Speaking to Stilico and others about his bed; I haue not liued so among you, saith he, that I am ashamed to liue longer if it please God: and yet again I am not afraid to die, because we haue a good Lord. He doth not say, Mine ovvne goodnesse puts me out of feare, but Gods goodnesse. This goodnesse of God makes me quiet in my conscience, and secure in soule, readie to embrace death vvhensoeuer it commeth.

Wherefore Surely is fitly added. For afflictions as vvaters doe not ouercome the faithfull. Nay they come not neere him. But contrariwise the faithfull conquereth afflictions. Yea Surely he is in them all more then a conquerour. In vvarre he is not afraid. Rather he greatly hopeth. And Surely euen in the verie vvarre he hopeth. The flood of vvaters commeth not neere to drovvne the Arke, but lift it vp. And so much the higher Surely the arke still riseth, as the flood riseth. The sea staieth not the Israelites passage. It is a dry land for them to march on. As a vvall moreouer to backe them Surely against all their enemies. Tentation not onely is no matter of sorrovve, but also on the other side of ioy, & Surely of great ioy. Death is no death, but a life, and Surely such a life, as onely of it vve may say, Behold vve liue. So happie both in life and death is the faithfull man; Surely in the flood of many waters, they shall not come neere him.
            To conclude then; No calamitie or aduersitie can possibly disseuer that

coniunction vvhich faith maketh of euery godly man with Christ. For feeling the remission of his sinnes assured and sealed vnto him, he contemneth not onely the works of the world, and dismaiments of his conscience, but euen the very feares and terrours of death. This our deare brother M. Edward Liuely, who now resteth in the Lord, lead a life which in a manner was nothing els but a continuall flood of many waters.

                he carried himselfe so in life and death, as these waters seemed not once to come neere him. He was professour of the Hebrewe tongue in this Vniuersitie thirty yeares. (As his father in law D. Larkyn bad beene professour of Phisick siue or sixe and thirty yeares.) Which tongue, howsoeuer some account of it, yet ought to bee preferred before all the rest. For it is the antienst, the shortest, the

plainest of all. A great part of wisdome, as Plato sheweth, is in the knowledgeIn Cratylo. of true Etymologies. These in other tongues are vncertaine, in this taken out of the naturall qualities of euery thing that is named. In so much as whē any man hath found the Hebrewe Etymologie, then he neede seeke no forther. Besides, all the Scripture written before the birth of Christ, except a fewe chapters of Daniel and Ezra, were written in Hebrewe. And the Rabbins themselues, though they haue no small number of fables and lies in them, yet diuerse things they haue notwithstanding fit for the opening of the old Testament. Therefore though a man cannot reade the Rabbins, yet vnlesse he can vnderstand handsomely well the Hebrew text, he is compted but a maimed, or as it were but halfe a Diuine, especially in this learned age. Lastly, diuerse learned men are of opinion, to whome I very willingly assent, that the holy tongue which was spoken in paradise, shalbe eternally vsed in the heauenly paradise, where the Saints shall euer

extoll and praise God. But this worthy professour deceased, got him great credit, as well by the continuance, as by the holinesse of his profession. For he was not a professour for one or two yeares, as others are, but full thirtieIn

Nathan Cytraeus writeth, that in Prage an Vniuersitie of Bohemia, where Iohn Hus and Hicrome of Prage professed, that they that haue continued professours for the space of 20. yeares together, are created Earles and Dukes both together. And therefore their style is to be called Illustres, whereas they which are singly and simply but onely either Earles or Dukes are called Spectabiles. Neither maketh it any matter that they haue no reuenewes, to maintaine Earldomes or Dukedomes. For they haue the title notwithstanding euen as Suffragans haue of Bishops. Our good brother hauing no such profit or dignitie propounded vnto him, but contenting himselfe with his stipend, spent halfe his life in this place. For he was vpon threescore yeares old when he died. He

Wherein diuers speeches and phrases of the Prophets are compared with the like in Poets and Oratours both Greek and Latin, and many notes neither vnpleasant nor vnprofitable to be read, are set out of the Rabbins. But in mine opinion he took greatest pains in his Chronologie, which he dedicated to Doctor Iohn Whitgift the reuerend late Archbishop of Canterbury. This booke indeede is full of hidden learning, and sheweth infinite reading in stories. I asked him within this little while, whether he had written no more bookes. He tould me he had, but printed no more, because he had no time to peruse and per

                them for other businesse. Now by busines he meant, I weene especially his studie & care to performe well his taske in the translation. Wherin how excellently he was imploved, all they can witnes who were ioyned with him in that labour. For though they be

the very slower of the Vniuersitie for knowledge of the tongues, yet they will not be ashamed to confesse, that no one man of their companie, if not by other respects, yet at leastwise for long experience and exercise in this kind, was to be compared with him. For indeede he was so desirous that this busines begunne by the commandement of our most gratious Soueraigne King Iames, should be brought to a happie ende, that oftentimes in many mens hearings, he protested he had rather die, then be any way negligent herein. Which as some thinke by all likelihood came indeede so to passe. To wit, that too earnest studie and paines about the translation, hastened his death, and brought it on sooner. Now as he liued so, in his profession, in his writings, in his translating, as though all the floods of many waters had neuer comn' neare him: euen so also he died. During the short time of his sicknes, he caried himselfe, as alwaies before, humbly, mildly, quietly, constantly. One of his louing friends standing by his bed, and

saying; M. Liuely, I pray God you may haue patience, and hope, and especially faith vnto the ende. He lifting vp his hands said heartily and cheerefully, Amen. Little he vsed to speake, and more he could not say, for the paine and impediment of his squinsey. Which though it made a speedie ende of him, as the apoplexie did of the good Emperour Valentinian, yet how could any death be sodaine to him, whose whole life was nothing els but a meditation of death, and vvhome the Lord whensoeuer he came, might finde doing his dutie? Wherefore no reason we should lament his departure out of this world. He liued blessedly, he died blessedly in the Lord. Rather, you Reuerend and learned Vniuersitie-men, lament for this, that you haue lost so famous a Professour, and so worthie a writer. Lament you translatours, beeing now depriued of him, who no lesse by his owne merit and desert, then by the priuiledge of his place, was to order and ouersee all your trauailes. Lament you poore orphans, eleuen poore children of you,

which he left behind him, as Christ ascending left eleuen Disciples, bereaued of your kinde and deare Father, destitute of necessaries for your maintenance, to seeke of all helpe and meanes, but onely (as poore folkes vse to speake) such as God and good friends shall prouide.

This is now the tenth course of schollers, which within this moneth hath beene brought forth to buriall, not one of them dying of the plague, whereas heretofore if one or two scholers haue died in a whole yeare out of all Colledges, it hath beene accompted a great matter. This and such like grieuous iudgements, beloued, doe plainely declare, that the Lord beeing awaked with the cry of our sinnes, is grieuously displeased and offended at

vs. Wherefore let vs yet now at the length in the name of God, rowfe vp our selues, and awake out of our deadly sinnes. Let this that our holy brother did so sodainly in a manner, fall asleepe, be a loud O yes, as it were to awake vs all. Let euery one of vs, amend one, iudge one, accuse one, condemne one, that we be not all condemned of the Lord. Let euery one of vs I beseech you crie vp to heauen for mercie, and say with Dauid, I haue sinned and done wickedly. Or with Ionas; Take me, for I knowe that for my sake this great tempest is vpon you. Then our most mercifull father shall blesse vs all, as he hath done this holy Saint, both in our life and in our death, by the pardoning of our offences, & couering all our sinnes, with the bowells and blood of Christ. And though in this world we be euer subiect to a flood of many waters, yet he shall drawe vs still out of many waters, as hee did Moses. Surely in the floode of many waters, no more then they did to Ionas, they shall not come neare vs. Neither

onely shall we be safe in the flood of death, but also in the flood of the day of iudgement. For that also is a flood, and a terrible fearefull one too. To wit, not of water, but of fire. As it was in the dayes of Noah: so shall it be at the comming of the sonne of man. In the first flood they which had not an arke, ranne vp to the toppes of houses, to the tops of trees, to the toppes of mountaines; because they desired to hold vp their heads aboue the still rising raging water. In the second, they which are not found in Christ, shall say to the mountaines, Fall vpon vs: and to the caues, Couer vs, and hide vs from the wrath of the Lambe. Then they shall be glad to creepe into euery hold and corner, that they may auoide the burning of fire. But we that confesse our sinnes, and forsake the fame, shall lift our heads to no other mountain, but tò Christ from whome commeth our saluation: we shall desire to be couered with no other rocke, but onely with that out of which came the blood and water of life. For neuer did Noahs flood

so cleane wash away all wicked men from the face of the earth, as the blood of Christ shall purge vs from all our sinnes, and present vs blamelesse before the face of our father, onely if we be faithfull vnto death. For then the next thing is felicitie, and the crowne of life. Which God for his mercie sake graunt vs all, that as we make no doubt, but this our holy brother now triumpheth with Christ, so all and euery one of vs, after we haue waded through this world as a flood of many waters, may inherit that kingdome of glorie, which our louing Lord Iesus hath purchased for vs with his deare blood: to whom with the Father, and the Holy Ghost, be all honour and glorie, now and euermore: Amen.

               But all we, with open face, behold as in a glasse the glorie of the Lord, and are transformed into the same image, from glorie to glorie, as by the spirit of the Lord.
            
            
               THe old Testament, and the new Testament, in summe and substance, are all one. Christ Iesus the very summe & substance of them both in himselfe is one and the same, yesterday,Heb. 13. 8. and to day, and for euer. Those mysticall wheeles, which EzekielEzeck. 1. 16. sees in a

vision: are one within an other. After the same sort, there is gospell in the lawe, and there is lawe in the gospell. One wheele is within another: one testament is within another. For neither is the lawe so full of threatenings, but that it hath some comforts in it: neither is the gospell so full of comforts, but that it hath some threatenings in it. So that the lawe, is nothing else but a threatning gospell; and the gospel, is nothing els, but a comfortable lawe. The two cherubimsExo. 25. 20., which shadowe the merey-seat, haue their faces one toward another. In like manner, the two testaments which shadowe out Christ the true mercy-seat vnto vs, haue their faces one toward another. For the old testament looketh forward toward the newe, which is come: and the newe testament looketh backeward, toward the old, which is past. Those glorious seraphims

God which taketh away the sinnes of the world. There, the lawe calls to the gospell, when Iohn commends Christ. Among them that haue beene borne of women, there hath not risen a greater, then the Baptist. Here on th'other side, the gospell calls to the lawe, when Christ cōmends Iohn. Whereupon also commending his spouseCant. 4. 5., he saies, Thy two breasts are like two young roes, that are twins, feeding among the lillies. The two breasts of the church are the tvvo testaments; out of which vve that are the children of the church, suck the pure milke of the vvord of God. These testaments feede among the lillies. Because they treate and discourse especially of Christ, vvho saies, I am the lilly of the valleyes. These testaments also are like tvvo young roes, that are tvvins. Because tvvins, (as vve reade of Hippocrates t

young roes that are tvvins, feeding among the lillies. The Prophet Zacharie

This golden candlesticke, shining continually, and giuing light to uery one that came into the tabernacle, was a figure of that light, which lighteneth euery one that commeth into the world. And euen as the light of that candlesticke, was alwaies maintained onely with the oyle, which dropping from the oliue trees, and distilling thorough the golden pipes, was conueyed into it: so Christ shineth in our hearts, onely by the light of his word, and the two testaments, are, as it were, two golden pipes, slowing-forth, and streaming both together, whereby the oyle of all gladnesse and goodnesse is powred into vs. Wherefore, it is manifest, that the old testament and the newe testament, as Ezechiels wheeles, are one within another. Yea moreouer, as those ch

to an other: as those young roes, they feede both together: as those golden pipes, they flowe forth both together. And therefore, as there are two cherubims, and yet but one obiect that they both looke vpon, which is the mercyseate; as there are two seraphims, and yet but one song that they both sing, which is the Holy; as there are two roes, and yet but one food that they both feede vpon, which is the lilly: as there are two pipes, and yet but one vessell that they both flow into, which is the golden candlesticke; so, there are two testaments, and yet but one summe and substance of them both, which is Christ. Christ the onely Mercy-seat; the onely Holy; the onely Lillie; the onely golden Candlesticke.
            But now, though these two testaments agree together thus in Christ, whom S. Paul calleth,

                  •…
               we.
            The first difference is in these words, But all we. In the time of the old testament very fewe did behold the glorie of the Lord. When the law was giuen, only Moses might come vp to the top of the mount, all the people stood below. Which custome continued euen vntill the comming of Christ. For when incense was offred, Luk. 1. 10. onely Zacharie went into the temple, all the multitude stood without. But suppose more men then Moyses or Zacharie did at that time behold the glorie of the Lord, yet certainly more nations then the Iewes did not behold it. The Iewes onely were Gods peculiar people. As for the Gentiles they were suffred to walke in their own wayes. The Lord shewed his word vnto Iacob, his statutes and ordinances vnto Israel. He dealt not so with any other nation, neither had the heathen knowledge of his lawe: which likewise continued euen vntill the cōming of Christ. For when a woman of Canaan cryed

to our Sauiour, saying, Haue mercy on me; he answered her, I am not sent but to the lost sheepe of the house of Israel. Yea, not onely he himselfe denied mercie to the Gentils, but also he charged his disciples for a time to shewe no mercie vnto them. Goe not into the way of the Gentiles, saies he, Mart. 10. 5. and into the cities of the Samaritans enter ye not. But go rather to the lost sheepe of the house of Israel. So that it was but one man onely among all the people, namely Moses, or Zacharie: or, to take it at the verie highest, it was but one people onely among all nations, namely the Iewes, or the Israelites, which did in the time of the old testament behold the glorie of the Lord.
            
               But all we, now all we, with open face behold as in a glasse the glorie of the Lord. Then, they did sing

Reg. 5. 1. by requesting Hiram king of Tyrus, to helpe him build the temple. For none but Israelites did meddle with building the tabernacle; whereas Sidonians, and diuerse other Gentiles, did helpe to build the temple. Which did mystically insinuate a further thing. To wit, that though the Synagogue of the Iewes did consist onely of Israelites, yet the Sidonians, and all other nations, should one day come together, and put-too their helping hand, to edisie and build vp the Church of Christ.

               ech you, how farre the new Testament, excelleth the old. In the time of the old Testament, they did sing onely, Notus in Iudaea deus: but now, we sing also, Laudate dominum omnes gentes. Then they that were borne in the land onely, might eate the passeouer: but now, we that are strangers also, may eate the Easter-lambe. Then the name of Christ was only, as an ointment kept in an alabaster box: but now, it is also, as an

oyntment powred out. Then the doctrine of Saluation, was onely preached in secret places: but now, it is also preached vpon the tops of houses. Then, the old asse only, was brought vnto Christ: but now, the young foale also, is obedient vnto him. Then, naturall branches only, did prosper and slourish: but now, wild branches also, are grafted into the oliue tree. Then, the Queenes onely, did praise the Church: but now, the concubines also, do call her blessed. Then, Israelites only, did build the tabernacle: but now, Sidonians also, doe helpe to build the Temple. Then, they pitched their tents onely in Marah, where was neither fountaine, nor palmtree: but now, we pitch in Elim, where there are twelue fountains, and seauentie palme trees. Then, the two kine which carried the Arke, looked onely one way: but now, the twelue oxen which carrie the molten sea, looke euery way, East, West, North, and South. Then, Christ was a flower, grovving onely in the little garden of Iudea: but novv, he is a flower, flourishing in the

wide field of all the vvorld. Then, Christ was onely a little stone, cut without hands: but now, he is a great huge mountaine, which filleth all the earth. Then, the Church of Christ was, as it were, in prison, beeing tied and bound onely to one place: but now, it posteth ouer all places riding and triumphing in the chariots of Amminadab. Then, the Church of Christ was only a small graine of mustard-seede, which is lesser then any other seede: but now, it spreadeth abroad as a mightie bigge

It is like Saint Iames his net, which catcheth all sort of fishes. All's fish, that comes to this net. It is like king Assuerus feast, which entertaineth all kind of

guests. To this feast all we, that wil come, are well-come. Not some fewe Iewes only, But all we: euen all we Brittaines, all we I say, with open face, behold as in a glasse the glorie of the Lord. This is the first difference, betweene the Law and the Gospel, in these words, But all we.
