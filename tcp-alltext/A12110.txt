            ¶Here begynneth the Prologue.
            
               THys boke (gentle reader) was fyrst corruptly printed in Fraunce and after that at the cost and charges of Rycharde Pynson, newly translated and reprinted, although not so faythfully as the origynal copy requyred. Wherfore it is once ageyne ouerseene and perused, that the same may be at length correspondent to the actours mind and very profitable for the reader, bycause this boke doth teche mani thinges that we be bounde to learne and knowe one peyne of euerlastinge death. As the lawes of God sheweth how we maye knowe to kepe his commaundementes and to knowe the remedyes to withstande deadely sinne, there be many men and women thynketh them selfe wyse, and knoweth and learneth many thinges, but that they be bounde to lerne and knowe, that they knowe not. ¶As fyrst the x. commaundementes of God, and the v. commaundementes of the Churche, that euery creature that purpose to be saued shuld lerne and knowe and haue them as perfytely as their Pater noster, you people, howe wyl you confesse you, and if ye breke any of the x. commaundementes, and you know not them. ¶ Truely there is but fewe that knoweth them, ther fore ye that do not know them to your deligence to learne them, for ye be bounde to lerne them, aswell as to lerne your Pater noster. ¶For howe can you keepe our Lordes commaundementes and ye knowe them not. And ye be bounde to breke not one of them on peyne of dampnation, for and if thou breake one thou brekest all. Offende the lawe in one point, and offende in all. For and thou breke one thou doest not Gods byddyng, for he byddeth thee breke none. And all that ye do in this world here, but if it be of God, or in God, or for God all is in vayne, you shoulde not occupy your selfe in vayne matters, but in redinge of good bokes, for vanitie engendreth vayne thoughtes, and destroyeth deuo
                  •
               ion to man. What nede it you to studie on a thinge that is nought: studye on your sinne, and what grace by God in you is wrought. ¶Also in this boke is many mo matters, loke in the Table here folowinge.

               AS here before tyme there was a Sheparde kepynge shepe in the fieldes, whiche was no clerke, ne hadde no vnderstandynge of the letterall sence, nor of no maner of scripture nor wrytinge, but of his naturall witte and vnderstandinge sayde. Howe be it that lyuynge and dyinge be all at the pleasure of almyghty God, yet man may lyue by the course of nature lxxii. yeares or more: this was his reason. And he sayth as muche tyme as a man hath to growe in beautie, length,

bredthe, and strength. So muche tyme hath he to waxe olde, and feble to his ende: But the terme to growe in beaute, heyght, and strength, is xxxvi. yeare and the terme to waxe olde, feble and weke, and turne to ye erthward, whiche is in all to gether lxxii. yere, that he oughte to lyue by course of nature. And they that dye before this tyme, often it is by vyolence and outrage done to theyr complection & nature. But they that lyue aboue this terme is by good regyment & ensygnements, after the which a man hath gouerned him selfe. To his purpose of lyuing and dyeng, the sayd Shepard sayth that the thinge that we desyre moste in this worlde is to lyue longe, and the thinge that we most feare is to dye soone, thus he trauayled his vnderstandinge, and made great diligēce to knowe and to do thynges possyble and requisyce for to lyue longe, hole, and ioyously, which this present composte & kalender of Shepardes shewynge and techynge, ¶Wherfore we wyll shewe you of the bodyes celestial, and of theyr nature and mouynges, and this present boke is named the compost, for it comprehendeth sully all the compost, & more for the dayes houres and momentes, and the newe moones, and the eclyps of the sonne & the moone, and the sygnes that the moone is in euery day, and this boke was made for them that be no clerkes to bringe them to great vnderstandinge. He sayde also that the desyre to lyue longe was in his soule, the which alway lasteth, wherfore he wolde that his desyre wer accomplyshed after his death as a fore. He sayde syth the soule dyeth not, & in her is the desyre to lyue long it shulde be an infallible peine, not to lyue after death as afore, for he that lyueth not after his corporall death shal not haue that, that he hath desyred: yt is to wytte to lyue longe, and shulde abyde in eternal peine yf his desyre were not accomplyshed. So concluded the sayde Sheparde necessarye thynges for hym and other to know and do that whiche apperteyned to lyue after death as afore. And truth it is that he the whych lyueth but the lyfe of this worlde onely, though he lyued an hundred yeare, he lyued not properly longe, but he 
                  •
               huld lyue longe, that the ende of this present lyfe shulde beginne the lyfe eternal, that is to saye the lyfe euerlastinge in heauen. So a man ought te per
               
                  •
               ourme his lyfe in this worlde corporally, that they may lyue spiritually with out ende. For as he sayde one shall lyue euerlastinge without dyenge, and when he hath the perdurable lyfe and shalbe perfyte. ¶And also by this pointe and none otherwyse shalbe accomplished the desyre of longe lyuynge 
                  •
               n this worlde. The forsayde Sheparde also knowledged, that the lyfe of 
                  •
               his worlde was sone past and gone: wherfore this Sheparde thought that xxii. yeares here in this vale of wretched mysery is but a lytle & a smal terme 
                  〈◊〉
                lyfe, to the euerlastinge, the whiche neuer shal haue endynge. And there
               
                  •
               ore he sayth, he that offreth him self, here to lyue vertuously in this worlde. After this lyfe he shall receaue the swete lyfe that is sure & lasteth euer without ende. For though a man lyned here a C. yeares and more, it is but a lyttle

terme to the lyfe to come. Therfore sayth this Sheparde. I wyl lyue soberly with these small temporall goodes that Iesu hath lent me, & euer to exyle the desyre of worledly ryches and worldley worshyppe. For they that laboureth for it, and haue loue to theyr goodes, & vayne worshyppes, Oft it departeth mā fro the heauenly treasure. It sh

               tteth mans hart that God may not entre and byldeth man a place of no reste in the lowe lande of darkenesse.
         
         
            ¶Here after foloweth an other Prologue of the maister Shepharde, that sheweth & proueth the auctours prologue true that is before rehearsed, & so the Shepardes dispute one with another, but this that foloweth the master Sheparde sayth to the other of the deuysion of this kalender. Capitulo ii.
            
               ¶Here begynneth the master Sheparde.
            
            
               IT is to be vnderstande, that there be in the yere four quarters that is called Uere, Hyems, Estas, and autumnus. Thefe be the iiii. seasons in the yere. as Prymetyme is the springe of the yeare, as Feu
                  •
               
               ryere, Marche, and april. These thre monethes.
            
               ¶Then commeth Sommer, as May, Iune, and Iuly: and those thre monethes, euery herbe, grayne and tree is in his kinde, and in his most strength & fayrnesse euen at the hyghest.
            ¶Theu commeth Automne, as August, Septembre, and October, that all these fruytes waxeth rype, and be gathered and howsed.
            ¶Then commeth Nouembre, December, and Ianyuere, and these thre monethes be in this wynter, The tyme of lytle profyte. We Shephardes saye that the age of a man is .lxxii. yere
                  •
                and that we lyken but to one hole yere, for euer more we take vi. yeare for euery moneth, as Ianyuere, or Feuerycre, and so forth, for as the yere chaūgeth by the xii. monethes, into xii. sundry maners so doth a man channge hym selfe twelue tymes in hys lyfe, by twelue ages, & euery age lasteth vi. yeare, yf so be that he lyue to lxxii. for three tymes syxe maketh eightene, and syxe tymes syxe maketh xxxvi. And then is man at the best and also at the hyghest, and twelue tymes syxe maketh .lxxii. and that is the age of a man.
            ¶Thus must ye reken for euery monethe syxe yeare, or els it maye be vnderstande, by the foure quarters and seasons of the yere. So is deuyded man in to foure parties, as to youth, strength, wysedome, and age: He to be xviii. yere yonge xviii. yeare stronge xviii. yeare in wysedome, and the fourth xviii. yeare to go to the full of the age of lxxii.
            
               ¶And nowe to shewe howe man chaungeth .xii. tymes euen as the xii. monethes do.
               TAke the fyrst vi. yere for Ianyuere, the whiche is of no vertue nor strength in that s
                     •
                  ason nothinge on the earth groweth. So man after he is borne tyl he be syxe yere of age is without witte strength or cunnyng, & may do nothyng that profyteth.
               ¶Then commeth Feueryere, & then the dayes begenneth to waxe in length, and the sonne more hotter, then the fyeldes beginneth to waxe greene: So the other syxe yeres tyl he come to twelue, the childe beginneth to growe bigger and serue and lerne such as is taught him.
               ¶Then cōmeth Marche, in the which the labourer soweth the earth & planteth trees, & edifyeth houses, the child in these vi. yeres, waxeth bigge to lern doctriue and scyence, & to be fayre and honest, for then he is .xviii. yeres of age.
               ¶After that commeth April that the earth and the threes is couered in grene and flowers, and in euery partye goodes encreaseth habundauntly, then commeth the chylde to gather the swete flowers of hardynes, but then beware yt the colde wyndes and stormes of vyces beate not downe the flowers of good maners, that he should bringe man to honour, for then he is xxiiii. yeres olde
               ¶Then commeth Maye, that is bothe fayre and pleasaunte, for then byrdes syngeth in woodes end forestes nyghte and daye, the sonne shyneth hotte, and as then is man moste ioyfull and pleasant, and of delyuer strengthe, and seketh playes, sportes, and lusty pastyme, for then is he full xxx. yere.
               
                  ¶Then commeth Iune, and then is the Sonne hyest in his meridiornall, he may ascende no hyer in his stacion, his glemeringe golden beames ripeth the corne, and when man is xxxvi. yere, he may ascend no more, for then hath nature gyuen hym beauty and strengthe at the full, and rypeth the sedes of parfyte vnderstandynge.
               ¶Then commeth Iuly, that our fruytes byn set a sonninge, and our corne a hardenynge, but then the sonne begynnethe a lyttle for to dyscende downewarde
                     •
                   so man then goth fro youth towarde age, & beginneth for to aquaynt him with sadnes, for then he is xlii. yere.
               ¶After that then commeth August: then we gather in our corne, and also the fruytes of the earth. And then doth man his diligence to gather for to fynde hym selfe withall, in the tyme that he may nother gette nor wyn, and thē after that vi. yeares is he .xlviii. yere olde.
               ¶Then commeth Septembre: that wynes be made, and the fruites of trees be gathered. And then therewithall he doth freshly begynne to garnyshe his house, and make prouysion of nedefull thinges, for to lyue in wynter whiche draweth very nere, and then is man in his most ioyfull and couragious estate prosperous in wysedome, purposynge to gather and kepe as muche as shulde be sufficient for him in his olde age, when he maye gather no more, and these vi. yeares maketh him liiii. yeares.
               ¶And then commeth Octobre: that all is into the forsayde house gathered but corne, and also other maner fruytes. And also the labourers soweth newe sedes in the earth, for the yere to come. And then he that soweth nought, shal nought gather. And then in there other vi. yeres a man shal take him selfe vnto God for to do penaunce and good workes, and then the benefytes the yere after his death, he may gather and haue spiritual profyte, and then is man ful in the terme of lx. yeres.
               ¶Then commeth Nouembre: that the dayes be very shorte, and the sonne in maner geueth lyttle heate, and the trees leseth theyr leues. The fieldes that were grene loke hore and gray. Then al maner of herbes be hid in the ground and then appereth no floures. And then winter is come that the man hath vn

                  derstandinge of age, and hath lost his kyndely heate and strength: His teeche begynne to rotte and also to chattre: and then hath ho no more hope of longe lyfe, but desyreth to come to the lyfe euerlasting, and these .vi. for this mouth maketh him .lxvi. yeres.
               ¶Then commeth Decembre: ful of colde with frost and snowe, with greate wyndes and stormy wethere, that a man may not laboure nor nought do: the sonne is thē at the lowest that it may descēde, thē the trees & the earth is hi
                     •
                   in snowe, thē it is good to holde them ny the fyre
                     •
                   & to spende the goodes that they gathered in sommer. For then beginneth mās heare to waxe whyte and gray, and his body croked & feble, & then he leseth his perfyte vnderstanding and that vi. yeares maketh hym full lxxii. yeres, and if he lyue any more it is

by his good gydynge and dyetynge in his youth. Howe be if, it is possyble that a man may lyue tyl he be an hundred yere of age. But there is but fewe that commeth thereto.
               ¶Wherfore I Sheparde sayde moreouer, that of lyuynge or dyinge the heauenly bodyes may s

                  ie. But yet may man withstande it by his one freewyll, to do what he will him selfe good or bad euermore. Aboue the which inclinacyon is the myghte and wyll of God, that longeth the lyfe of man by his goodnesse, or to take it shorte by his iustice.
               ¶Wherfore we wyll shewe you of the bodyes celestyall, and of theyr nature and mouynges, and this present booke is named the composte, for it comprehendeth fully all the compost and more for the dayes, houres, and momentes and the newe moones, and the clippes of the sunne and the moone, and of the sygnes that the moone is in euery day, and this booke was made for them that be no clerkes, to bring them to great vnderstandinge.

The which is deuided in .yii. pryncipall partes after the .vii. deadly synnes, and eche deadly synne is lykened to a tree, and euery tree hauing .vii. small braunches, and all these .vii trees commeth out of one tree by it selfe that is euyll, and commeth of one beginning, and that is the deuill, and it bydeth an end, that is euerlasting damnation, which is ordeyned for all them that seeke not remedy betymes by penaunce and repentaunce of theyr lyfe in tyme.
            And after these trees of vyces foloweth the paynes of hell, to shew the lay people what punyshmente is ordeyned for euery deadely synne, and that the people may the better shew theyr synnes in confession, and make cleane theyr conscyence, & that they may be the house of God, so that vertues may growe and fructifie to the profyte of theyr soules. The fyrst great braunch of the tree of vyces is Pryde, and he hath .xvii braunches growing out of hym. As of vayne glory of him selfe. Uayne glory of the worlde. Praysing hym selfe in euyll. Bostinge of synne. Inobedyence. Disdayne. To tempte God. Excesse. Dispraysinge. False goodnesse. Hardynesse. Presumption. Rebellion. Obstinacion. Sinne wittingly. Communynge of the Sacrament. Shame to doe good. Out of euery of the whych braunches spryngeth three braunches, and out of euery of the sayde three braunches groweth three small braunches, to the number of seuen score and thyrtene, and in so many maners and wayes ye may synne in the synne of Pryde, the whych is the roote and beginning of all the seuen deadly synnes. And therefore it shall be shewed fyrste of Pryde, and after the other syxe synnes as they folowe in order.

But yet for veniall sinne is many remedies. Also for deadly sinne is fewe remedies, and but four specially, as Confession, Contricion, Satisfaction, and penance. But the first is, thou must be sory for thy sinnes. Secondly to make a meke confession. Thirdly, do satisfaction. And fourthly performe thy penance adioyned by the confessour, for penaunce is dette that we must pay to God for our sinne committed, and therfore neuer loke to haue forgeuenes of thy sinnes without repentance. Also sinne is perillous afore our Lord Iesu Christ for .iii. maner of reasons. The first he giueth no warning when he smiteth thee. The seconde, for as he findeth thee, so will he iudge thee.

            Here foloweth the paynes of hell comminatories of synnes, to punish the sinners, as Lazarus recompted after that he was rysen, as he had seene in the parties infernals, as it appeareth by these fygures ensuing one after an other. Capitulo .viii.
            
               
               
            
            
               OUr Sauioure and redemer Iesu Christ, a little before his blessed Passion, beinge in Bethanye, entred into the house of a man named Symon, for to take his corporall refection. And as he was sytting at the table with his Apostles and Disciples, there being Lazarus brother to Mary Magdalene and Martha, the whych our Lorde had raysed from death to lyfe. The whych thinge Symon douted, and prayed our Lorde for to commaunde Lazarus to shewe afore the assistentes what he had sene in the other world. And our lorde gaue him leue to

speake. And then the sayd Lazarus recounted how that he had sene in the parties infernalles of hell many great and intollerable paines, where as sinnefull men and women were payned. Firste of Pryde, and consequently of all the .vii. deadly sinnes, eche payne by him selfe.
            
               First sayde Lazarus I haue seene in hell wheles right hie, set on an hyll, the which was to looke on in maner of mylles, incessantly turning about by great impituosity, roring and whirling as it were thunder. And the wheles were fyxed full of hookes and crampions of Iron and steele, and on them were hanged and turned the proud men and women for their Pryde, with their prynce, capitayne and master Lucifer.
               
               
                  
                  PRyde amonge all other synnes is a kynge, a captayne, and master. And as a king hath a great company of people, in the same maner hath pryde a great company of vyces And as a king kepeth that which is his, in likewise doth pryde kepe the proude folke that be in his iurisdiction. Great signe of reprobacion it is for to perseuer longe in pryde Pryde then is a synne that displeaseth God aboue all other sinnes, as much as humilitie pleaseth him amonge vertues. And there is no sinne that maketh a man more semblable to the deuill then pride doth. For the proude man wil not be as the other men, but he must be as the Pharisien with the deuill. And for that the proude man will enhaunce him selfe aboue other men, the deuill doth with him as the crowe hauyng a harde nutte in his byl, the which he may not cracke, she beareth it vp a hye in the ayre, and then letteth it fal vpon a stone wheron it breaketh, and then she discendeth and eateth it. In likewyse the deuyll reyseth the proude man and woman for to let them fall in the harde paynes of hell. As much difference is betwene pryde and humilitie, as the chaffe and the corne, for the chaffe is light and mounteth hye, & the wynde caryeth it about and so it is lost, and the corne which is heauy abydeth lowe on the grounde, and is gathered vp and put in garners of the fermour, and is kepte for the common profite, and the chaffe is brent, lost, and de

                  oured of beastes. And in this wyse are the proude people reysed and enhaunsed through the entisement of the fiende of hell, & then fal downe by the moyst rayne of death, which maketh them heauy, and causeth them to tomble by the strength of their superbious blastes into the forneyse euerlasting, and there to be brent and deuoured with the horrible beastes of hell.
               
            
            
               ¶Secondly sayde Lazarus I

haue seene in hell a fiudde frosen as yse, wherin the enuious men and women were plunged vnto the nauill, & then sodainly came ouer them a right cold and a great winde, that greued and payned them ryght sore, & when they would euite and eschew the wonderfull blastes of the wynde, they plunged into the water wyth great shoutes & cryes lamentable to heare.
               
               
                  
                     These be the Enuious people.
                  
               
               
                  ENuye is doloure and sorowe of the harte, of the felicitie and prosperytie of other, the whych synne is soueraignely cursed, for that it is contrarye to Charity, that is soueraygne heade of all vertues, wherby it is great sygne of reprobacyon, for by it the fiendes knowe them that shall be dampned, as Charitie is sygne of saluation, and whereby God knoweth who shall be saued. Enuyous people ben fellowes vnto the deuyll. For if so be that an Enuyous man do winne, then is he very glad, and if he leese he is full angry with them. Enuyous folke ben so

infette and corrupte that good odoures to them stynketh, and sweete thinges vnto them semeth sower, in likewise is the good name and prosperity of other But stinking things and sower to them be swete, the whych ben vices, reproches, aduersities, and euill fortunes that they knowe or heare sayde of other. The Enuious folke seke their welth in the aduersitie of other, as when of the harme of other they seke the good in reioysing them, but with this they be not yet satisfyed, but of a new they be tormented, for they haue not such ioy without displeasance and affliction at their hart, wherby they be tormented. For he that seketh his welth in the aduersitie of an other, is lyke to hym that seketh the fier in the bottome of a water, or that loketh for woll on an vrchins backe, the which thinges be but all follyes and abusions. Enuy is but the goodes and felicities of this worlde, for the cursed synne of enuy may not ascende into heauen. It is a synne difficile to heale, for it taketh toote and is fyxed in the hart secretly, wherfore it is harde and vnpossible for to be done away by medicine, wherefore with great paynes is any made hole that is infected with it. The enuious mens toungs be likened vnto a three edged sword that hurteth and cutteth three maner of wayes. The firste he hurteth and woundeth his owne soule. The seconde him that he telleth his tale vnto. And thirdly he sleyeth him by whom he felleth his cursed tale.
               Thus endeth Enuy, and foloweth the history of Wrath.
            
            
               
                  
                     Wrath.
                  
               
               ¶Thirdly sayd Lazarus I

haue seene in hell a great caue tenebrous and obscute, full of tables lyke Bochers stalles, or a great bochery, where as Irefull men and women were thorow pearced with trenchynge knyues and sharpe glayues, & with long speares perced their bodyes, wherewith the moste horryble and fearefull bochers of hell hewed and detrenched them wyth their glayues and knyues impiteously wythoute ceasing.
               
                  
                  
               
               
                  SO as peace maketh the conscience of a man to be the dwellinge place of God, so cursed wrath maketh it the habitation of the deuil. Wrath efisketh and leseth the eye of reason, for in a wrathful man reason is banished, ther is nothing that kepeth so much the image of God in man, as sweetnes, peace, and loue, for almighty God wil be there as peace and concord is, but wrath chaseth thē fro man, so that our lord may haue no abyding. The wrathful man is lyke to a Demoniacle, the which hath the deuill within him, causing him to torment and striue with himselfe, foming at the mouth, and gnasshing with his teeth, for the intollerable payne the whych the enemy doth to him. In likewise the wrathfull man is tormented by wrath, and doeth oftentymes worse then the Demoniacle, for without pacience they beate the one with the other, sayinge iniuries, reproches, vyllanies, & geue them selues to the deuill body and soule,

and say and do many vnlawfull and domageable things. By wrath sometime the deuill getteth an hole generation or all a coun

                  rey. When wrath is set, then commeth noyse, & then vengaunce that destroyeth and leeseth all, the which hapneth sometime through one wrathfull man, as an yreful dogge the which mo

                  ed and put strife amonge other. The fysher troubleth the water that the fysh may not see his nette, to the ende that they may goe therein and be taken. In likewise the deuill troubleth the man by wra
                     •
                  h, to the ende that he knowe not the harme that he commised by his wrathfull hart and courage.
            
            
               Fourthly sayd Lazarus, I haue scene in hel an horrible hall darke and tenebrous, wherin was a great multitude of serpentes bygge and small, where as slouthfull men and women were tormented with bytings and stingings of venemous wormes, the which perced them through in diuers parts of their bodies, wounding them to the hart with inextinguible payne.
               
                  
               
               
                  
                  Of slouthfull people.
                  
                     SLouth is tristesse of spirituall goodes, that should be ordeyned to God, wherfeore they loue to serue God as they ought to doe, with hart and mouth, and by good operacyons, who that wyll loue God ought to knowe him redemptour and Sauiour of all goodnesse that we haue had and receyued euery daye, knowledging our selfs sinners. Great foly it is when by slouth in the time of this breniate life, we gather not goodes for the life eternall. But in these dayes many one be slouthfull to do wel, and diligent to do euill, so that if they were diligent to do well, as they be to do euill, they were right happy. Also slouth is the beginner of sinne, and a great enemy to God, for he letteth men and women to serue God, and to know their maker and redeemer, and sender of all goodnesse that they haue here, they be great fooles that be so slouthfull here in this litle time of this shorte lyfe, that will gather no goodes to bringe the soule to euerlasting lyfe. But nowe a dayes people be slouthfull in doinge of good, and full dilygent to euyll, and if they were as diligent to do good as euill, they were full of grace. Nowe he that will thinke as after his death is not wise, for then he shall haue but the good d

                     edes that he hath done in hys lyfe before, then shall he sorowe and playne of the time that he hath loste by slouth, and shall sorowe that he did no good deedes when he had time & space here in this world.

               Fyfthly sayde Lazarus, I

haue seene in the infernall partyes a great number of wyde cauderons and kettels full of boylynge leade and Oile wyth other hote metalles molten, in the whiche were plunged and dypped the Couetyse men and women, for to fulfill and replenish them of their insaciate couetise.

                     COuetyse is a great sinne and a wicked in the syght of God. For the couetous man imagineth more to get a peny, then the loue of God. And had leuer lese God then one halfe peny. For often tymes for a lyttle thinge he lyethe and forswereth hym selfe and sinneth deadly. The faythe, hope & the charitie that wolde be in God the couetous man putteth in hys rychesse. Fyrst fayth, for he beleueth to

                     Also the couetous man hath hope to haue the more ioye and consolations by his riches, then God may gyue hym. And also the couetous man setteth al his hert on his goodes & not on God, & thus the couetous man & womā hath theyr charitie in theyr ryche chestes, cofers, & bagges. The couetousman hath his harte on his goodes more thē one God. There as is the hart, there is the loue, and loue is charytie, and so couetous men hath theyr hertes on theyr goodes. The couetous man synneth gatherynge his good, and in vsynge it euyll, and in louynge it ouer muche, and sometymes better then he doth God, the couetous man is taken in the nette of the deuyl, by the which he leseth euerlasting lyfe, for small temporal goodes, as the birde doth go into a pytfall for a worme & leseth his lyfe, and as the mouse is taken in a fall or trappe, and leseth his lyfe for a lyttle bacon. The couetous men and women bin lyke curres or dogges, the whiche that kepeth carren, and when theyr bellyes be full they lye downe by it, and kepeth away the byrdes that they may not eate, but dyeth for hunger for faute of that the curres hath to muche. In lykewyse the couetous men withholdeth the goodes that pore men may get none, & letteth them dye for hunger, and holdeth them in theyr subiection, and the deuyll holdeth the ryche men in his subiection that doth the pore men wronge.
                  Thus endeth the peyne for the couetous men.

                  OF all the vii. deadly sinnes. Lecherye pleaseth moste vnto the deuyll. For it fyleth and corrupteth bothe the body & the soule together, and by Lechery the deuyll wynneth twoo sowles at once. And many lecherous persons wyll auaunte them selfe, and saye that they maye not haue theyr full desyre and luste of that sinne. Lecherous men and women be more disfourmed and vgly then the deuyll, in the superhabundaunce of that sinne. He is a foolyshe marchaunte that maketh a bargeyne, of the whych he knoweth well that he shall lese thereby, and repent hym of his bargayne makynge. In lyke maner of wyse, eche Lecherous man hath great peyne, and spendeth hys goodes and his vnderstanding to fulfyll and accomplyshe his lustes and delytes, and after repenteth hym of his expence, and yet the worste is, he is in daunger of his foule tyl he be repentaunt, & do sufficient penaunce. The Lecherous men and women lyuinge byn tourmented with three infernall peynes, as heate, slynke, and remors of theyr conscyence. For they be hotte by concupiscence. They be stynkynge for theyr immundicitie. For suche sinne is all stynkynge & maculeth the body and soule, which all other sines fyleth but the soule.
               ¶Also they bee not without remors of conscyence for the offence that they haue done to God. Lecherye is the pytte of the deuyll, wherein he maketh synners to fall. To the whiche many helpeth the deuyll to caste them selfe in it, when wyllinglye they go to the brymme knowinge that the deuyll wyll caste them in. Good it is not to herken women, better it is not to beholden them, & much better it is not to touch them. To this sin

               Thus endeth the vii. deadly sinnes, fygured eche by hym selfe lyke as Lazarus had sene in the partes Infernalles.

her chylde Iesus. The iii. shalbe of the xii. articles of oure faythe. The iiii. shalbe of the x. commaundementes of the lawe. The fyfth shalbe of the Fielde of vertues: For the first ye ought to know that by the oraison of our lord, that is the Pater noster, when we saye it we demaunde of God suffysaunce of all thinges necessaay for to salute & helpe of our soules & of our bodies, not only for vs, but for all other. And for all this cause we ought to haue the sayde orayson in great cōtēplacion, & say it with great devotiō vnto God. And vnto yonge people it shuld betaught & sayde to them, for though they vnderstande it not, yet it profyteth thē to haue the kyngedome of heuen. And they say it in perfyte loue & charitie, In the Pater noster, we aske vii. peticions. By eche peticion we may vnderstande vii. other thinges. As the vii, Sacramentes of holy Church. The vii. gyftes of the holy ghoste. The vii. armures of iustyce spirituall. The vii. vertues princypall that we shoulde exercyse. The seuen workes of mercy bodely. The vii. workes of mercy ghostly. The vii. deadlye sinnes that we shulde drede. The declaration is this, Our father that art in heauen thy name be made holy. In his peticion, we aske of god our father to be his sonnes, for otherwyse we can not be called his sonnes, nor be our father, & that his name may be made by vs more holyer then any other thinge, wherfore we receaue the sacrament of baptisme, without that, mā may not be made the sonne of God, & to receaue the vertue of meknesse against pryde, and thē to clothe the naked, & helpe the nedy both bodely & ghostly. The ii. is, thy kyngdome come to vs is this peticion. In so much thy name of God may not be perfitely halowed of vs in this worlde we aske his realme. In the whiche perfitely we shal halowe it, for to that kyngdom we be very heirs. This peticion is the sacrament of priesthod, by the which we are taught to good workes, & the gift of the holy-ghost is the gift of vnderstanding, for to vnderstand & desyre the kyngdome of heauen, and we arme vs wyth the helme of largenes ageinst coueteous. The iii. peticion is thy wil be done in the earth as it is in heauen. For it is the faythfull will of God that his wyll shulde be fulfylled that is his cōmaundemēt, by this peticion we make obeysaūce to God in our hertes, when we desyre to do his will. By this is vnderstande the sacrament of Mariage, by the which we auoyde fornication, and the gifte af counsell of the holy ghost for to order our obeysance veritably. And so we arme vs with the armoure of saluation ageinst enuye. The fourthe peticion is, our dayely breade gyue vs this day. Here we aske of God to be susteyned with materiall breade for our bodyes, and spiritual bread for our soules, that is the bread of lyfe, the body of Iesu Christ, the whiche we receaue by faith, in mynde of hys passion. The ghyft of the holy ghost is strength to be faithfull in oure beliefe, take we the sworde of pacience ageynst the synne of yre, and vysyte the sycke men bodely, and vse vertue of temperaunce ageynst wrathe. the fyfte pety
               
                  •
               ion is, forgeue vs oure sinnes as we forgyue all men, for trust well, he that wyll not forgyue for the loue of Godde, God wil neuer forgyue hym hys sinnes.

And these .iii. peticions folowinge we aske of God to be delyuered from al euyll, as of the sinne that we haue done deadely, & by these we aske of God to be assoyled and to gyue vs pardon by his mercye, by the whiche we vnderstande the sacrament of penaunce & forgyuenisse of sinne the holy ghostes gifte is scyence for to vnderstande the workes of mercy and to escapt synne. And so clothe vs with lightnes ageinst couetyse, and comforte pore prysoners and gyue good councell to them that aske and nede it, and take the vertue of fayth ageynst couetyse. The vi. peticion is suffre vs not to be ouercome in temptacion by the seconde euyl that is not done, but it maye happen & we fall by the waye of temptacion. Here we aske of God to be stedfaste in the fayth, & that we may gladly do good workes in the vertue of hope and strength to do good dedes, & withstande temptacion to the which profyteth to vs the sacrament of confirmation whiche giueth to vs the knowledge of God by the vertue of veritie. The gift of the holy ghost, and so take we the spere of sobernesse ageinst glotony, and comforte pilgrimes by vertue of hope. The vii. peticion is to deliuer vs frome all euyll. Amen. The thirde euill, is euyll of peyne that sinners maye haue yf they serue not God, & by this peticion we aske that we may be delyuered from all peynes, and saued in Paradyce, vnto this say we all. Amen. By these we aske, so it be done as we desyre. By the whiche we receaue the sacrament of the later anoyntynge, that gyueth vs the sure way of saluation, the gift of the holy ghoste is drede of iudgementes of God, and gyrde vs with the gyrdle of chastitie ageynst lechery, and burye we them that be deade bodely, and praye for our enemies ghostly, get we in vs the vertue of charitie, and eschewe the sinne of lechery.

The ship as sone as it is entred into the sea, vnto the ende of her viage, nighte and day is in perill to be drowned or taken with enemies, for in the sea be perilles without number. Such is the body of man liuing in the world, the marchandise that he beareth is his soule, his vertues and good workes, the port or hauen is death, and Paradise for the good, to the which who that goeth thither is soueraignely rich, the sea is the world full of linnes. For who that assayeth for to passe it, is in perill to leese body and soule, and all his goodes, and to be drowned in the sea of hell, from the which God kepe vs. Amen.
         
         
            Here foloweth the fielde of vertues. Cap. xiiii.
            
               IN walkinge farthermore in the fielde of vertues, and in the way of Health, for to come to the towre of Sapience, necessarily behoueth to loue God, for without the loue of God none may be saued, and who that will loue him ought first to know him, for of his knoweledge one cometh to his loue: that is Charitie the Soueraigne of all vertues. They knowledge God & loue him that kepe his cōmaundements, & they misknow him that do not so, to whom in the great necessitie of their disceassing: & at the day of iudgement shal misknow them & say to them. I know ye not nor wote not what ye be, go ye cursed out of my cōpany. Knowledge wethen God and loue him, and if we will do thus, know we first our selfe, and by the knowledge of our selfe, we shall come to the knowledge & loue of God, and the more that we know our selfe, the better we shall knowe God, & if we be ignorant of our self, we shal haue no knowledge of God. To this purpose we must note one thing and know .vii. The thing that we must note is this. Who that knoweth himselfe knoweth God, & shal not be dampned, & who that knoweth hym not, knoweth not God, and shall not be saued: vnderstande of them that hath wit and discretion with lawfull age, of the which knowledge none is excused after he hath sinned deadly, for to say that he was ignoraunt. By this appereth the ignorance of him selfe, and of God right perillous. Deadly synne is beginninge of all euill, and contrarily knowledge of God and of him selfe is soueraigne science and vertue, beginning of all goodnes. The seuen thinges that we ought to haue, ben the .xii. articles of the fayth, that we ought to beleue stedfastly. Also the petitions conteyned in the Pater noster, by the which we demaunde all things necessary for our health, & that we ought to hope in

him, also the commaundementes of the lawe, and of the holy Church, whych ensygneth vs what we should do, and what we should not do, and all things belonginge to the same. Also if we be in the grace of our Lorde or not. And howe be if that we may not knowe it certainely, neuerthelesse we maye haue some coniectures, whiche be good to knowe, and knoweledge of God. Also knoweledge of him selfe, by the whiche thinges we may come to the true loue and charitie of God, to accomplyshe hys commaundementes and meryte in the realme of heauen, wherein we shall lyue perdurably. Of the three fyrste is ynoughe sayde, that is to knowe, the .xii. artycles of the fayth, in the whyche lyeth our fayth and beliefe, and the thinges that we oughte to demaunde of God, be conteyued in the Pater noster, wherein our hope lyeth. Also the tenne commaundementes of the lawe, and of holye Churche, where as Charitie is shewed in suche as kepe them, by probacyon of the loue of Godde, and do his commaundements and good workes. Nowe will we speake of the other .iiii. And firste of the vocation in the whiche we be, whiche is the fourthe thynge that eche man ought to knowe. Eche man ought to knowe hys vocation, and the thynges belongynge to the same be iuste and honest for his health and rest of hys conscyence. A good Shepeherde ought to know the arte of shepe kepynge, and to gouerne shepe, and leade them into pastures, and to heale them when they be sycke, and shere them in season, to the entent that throughe his defaute no dammage come to hys master. In likewise he that laboureth the corne, to knowe what grounde were good for euery manner of grayne, and ought to tyll the earth, and when time is to sowe, weede, repe, and threshe, so that hys mayster may haue no dammage by hym. Semblably a Surgyon ought to knowe howe to comforte and heale such folkes, that he hath charge of, wythoute bydinge of hys arte or Surgery. Consequently a marchaunte ought to knowe the vtteraunce of hys marchaundyse to other, with no more fraude then he would hym selfe shoulde haue. Also an Aduocate or a Proctour ought to knowe the ryghtes and customes of places, that by their faulte Iustyce be not peruerted. A Iudge also oughte to knowe (bothe the partyes heard) who hath right and who hath wrong, and iudge egally after true Iustyce. Also a Prieste or a relygious man oughte to knowe theyr orders and keepe them, and aboue all thynge oughte to knowe that lawe of God, and teach them vnto the ignoraunt. And thus of all other vocations. For all them that knowe not their vocation be not worthy to be, and lyue in perill of their sowles for theyr ignoraunce The fyfth that all men ought to knowe, is it he haue discretion and vnderstandinge, to knowe if he be in the grace of God or not. And howe be it righte difficile, for God onely knoweth it, neuerthelesse we may haue coniectures that sheweth it, and sufficient for Shepherdes and lay people to know, if they be in the loue of the Lord, and if they haue coniecture to be in it, therfore there ought none to repute thēselues iust, but ought t
                  •
                humble them selues, and aske him mercy that maketh sinners become iuste

and none other. Principally we ought to know this scyence when we wyll receaue the body of Iesu Christe. For who that receiueth his grace and goodnes receaueth his saluation, and who that receaueth him otherwyse, receaueth euerlastinge dampnation, of the whyche thinge euerye man is iudge in hym selfe of his owne conscyence, and none other. The coniectures whereby we may knowe if that we be in the grace of God or not. The fyrste coniecture is when we do trauel for to clense our conscience of our soules by penance as much as if we laboured to get some great good, that we be not culpable of any deadly sinne done, or in will to do, nor in any sentence, then it is good coniecturinge to be in the grace of God. The seconde coniecture that sheweth in lykewyse to be in the grace of God, is when we be more prompt and ready to good, obseruinge and keeping the commaundementes of Godde, and doe all good workes that we shoulde haue accustomed. The third coniecture is when we heare gladly the worde of God, as sermons and good counsaylers for our saluation. The fourth, when we be sory and contrite at our hart to haue commysed and done any sinne. The fifth is when with good purpose and wyll of our selues we perseuer to kepe vs from sinne in tyme to come. These coniectures be they wherby Shepherds and lay people know if they be in his grace or not, as muche as in them is possible to knowe. The .vi. thinge that euery man ought to knowe is God, for all men ought to knowe God, for to accomplyshe his wil and commaundement, by the which he would be loued with all thy harte, with all thy soule, and wyth all the force that we haue, whyche we may not do, if we knowe hym not, then who that would loue Godde, ought to knowe him, and the more that they know him, the more they loue him, wherfore hereafter shall be sayde howe Shepherds and simple people doth knowe hym. Shepherdes and simple people for to haue knowledge of God of theyr possibilitie consyderinge three thinges. The firste is, that they consyder the ryght great ryches of God, his puissaunce, his soueraygne dignitie, hys soueraygne noblesse, his soueraygne ioy and blysse. The seconde is for they consyder the right noble, ryght gre
                  •
               t and marueylous operations and workes of our Lord God. And the thirde consideration is, for they consider the innumerable benefites that they haue receued of God, and that continually euery day they receaue of him, and by these considerations they come to his cognysance and knowledge. Fyrst to know God, Shepherdes and lay people consydereth his great riches, plenteous habundaunce of the goodnes that he hath, for all the treasures and rychesse of heauen and of the earth be his, and all goodnesse he hath made, of the which he is fountayne, creatour, and mayster, and distributeth them largely vnto euery creature, and he hath no neede of any other. Wherefore it behoueth to say that he is right rich. Secondly he is right puissaunt, for by his greate puissaunce he hath made heauen, earth, and the sea, with all thinges conteyning vnto them, and might vndo them if that it were his will, vnto the which puissaunce all other be subiect, and trembleth before

him for his great excellency. And who that woulde consider euery worke of God should finde inough to maruell on. By the firste of these considerations God is knowen to be right rich, by giftes that he geueth to his friendes, and by the seconde he is knowen right puissaunt for to venge him on his enemies. Thirdly he is soueraignely worthy, for all the thinges of heauen and of earth oweth him honoure and reuerence, as to their Creatour and hym that made them, as we se children honour father and mother of whom they be discended by a generation, and all thinges be discended of God by a creation, to whome ought to be giuen great reuerence, and he is so worthy. Fourthly he is soueraignely noble, for who that is soueraignely rich, puissaunt, and worthy, him behoueth to be soueraignely noble, but none other but God hath riches, puissaunce, and dignitie, as he hath, wherefore of such nobles ought to be sayde that he is righte noble. Fifthly he hath soueraigne ioye, for he that is riche, puissaunte, worthy and right noble, is not withoute soueraigne ioye, and this ioye is full of all goodnes, and ought to be our felicitie, to the which we hope to come. That is to knowe and see God in his soueraigne ioy and gladnes, for to haue with him eternal ioy that euer shal dure. And this is the first consideration of God that Shepherdes and other simple people ought to haue. Secondly for to know God considering his great noblesse and maruelous workes the bountie and the beauty of the things that he hath made, for it is commonly sayd. One may know the workman by his worke. Knowledge we then the worke of God, and knowledge we that his beautie and bountie shineth in the operations that he hath made, which if they be fayre and good, the workman that hath made them must nedes be faire and good without comparison more then any thinge that he hath made. Be it considered of the heauens and the thinges therein set, what noble and marueylous worke, howe may one consider their excellence and bountie. Be it considered also as we may of the earth the right noble and marueylous workes of God, the golde, the siluer, and all maner of metalles, and precious stones in it, the fruites that it beareth, the trees, the beastes that it susteyneth, and of the bountie that it norisheth. Be it in likewise considered of the Sea, the riuers, and the fishe nourished in them. The wether, the elementes, the ayre, the windes, and the Birdes that flyeth in them, and all the vsage and seruyce of man. And consider the workeman that of his puissaunce hath all made, and by his sapience hath righte well ordered his workes, and gouerneth them by his great bountie, and by this maner we may knowe God, as Shepeherdes and simple folkes in consideringe his workes. Thirdely for to knowe God, consider the great benefites that we receaue daily of him, whiche may not be numbred for their greate multitude, nor spoken of for their noblenesse and dignitie. Al be it in their hartes be vi. principally noted. For the which an other Shepeherde geniuge praysing to God, sayde in this maner. Lorde God I knowe that thou haste endued me with thy infinite benefites by thy great bountie. First the benefite of my creation,

by the whiche thou made me a reasonable man vnto thy Image and similytude, geuynge me body and soule, and rayment for to clothe me. Lorde thou haste geuen me my wittes of nature, vnderstandinge for to gouerne my lyfe, my health
                  •
                my beauty, my strength, and my scyence for to get my lyuynge honestly, I yelde to thee graces and greate thankes. Secondely Lorde I knowe the goodnes of my redemption, how by thy misericordious pitie, thou bought me dearely by the affection of thy moste precious bloude, peynes, and torments, that for me thou hast suffered, and finally endured death, thou hast geuen me thy bodye, thy soule, and thy lyfe, for to kepe me from dampnation, wherefore humbly I yelde to thee graces and great thankes. Thirdely Lorde I know the goodnes of my vocation, how of thy great grace thou hast called me againe, for to enheryte thy eternall benediction, and also thou haste geuen vnto me fayth and knowledge of thine owne selfe, as baptisme, and all the other sacramentes, that none entendement may comprise their noblesse, and dignitie, and that so many times hath pardoned me of my sinnes. Lorde I knowe that this is to me a singuler gifte that thou hast not geuen to them which haue no knowledge of thee, wherof I am more beholding and humbly bound, I yelde thee graces and thankes. Fourthly Lord I knowledge that thou hast geuen me this world and the things that be therin made for my seruice and vse, the office, the benefite, and the dignitie in the which I am, for syr I beare your similitude and Image which is reputed right worthy and noble wherof humbly I yelde to thee graces and thankes. Fyfthly Lorde thou hast geuen me the Skie and his faire ornaments, the Sunne, the Moone, and the Sterres, that the daye and night serueth me, geuinge brightnesse and lyght without to be recompensed of me, wherof I yelde to thee graces and thanks. Syxtly Lorde I knowledge that thou hast made Paradyse ready for to geue me, where I shall lyue with thee in ioyes without ende, if I doe thy will, and kepe thy commaundementes, and also I knowledge thy other infynite goodnes eche daye to me done by thy bountie, the whiche ensigneth me to knowe my God, my Sauiour, and Redemer, wherefore I humbly geue thankes to thee. By these considerations Shepherds and simple people contempleth the bountie of God, and the benefytes that they receaue of hym. And knowe we hym, and be we not in great knowledge of hys benefytes in yeldinge thankes and praysynges to hym, and recompence of your gooddes in geuinge to poore folkes for his sake, for Ingratitude is a villayne sinne that much displeaseth God. The .vii. and the laste thynge that eche man ought to knowe, that is to knowe him selfe, for it is the beste meane for to come vnto the knoweledge of God, and for to make his saluation, so to knowe hym selfe fyrst. Diuers folke knowe many thinges that know not them selfe, to whom should profite more to know them selfe, then all things in the world. They that know the things of the worlde loueth them, seeketh them, and kepeth them, and k
                  •
               owe not, ne loue not, ne prayse not, ne kepeth not God in likewise, for they know hym not. What profiteth man to win al the world, & leeseth himselfe for to be damned?

Better it were for hym to leese all the worlde, if it were his, if he knew him selfe to be saued. Shepeherdes say that the nedefull beginninge of hys saluation is to knowe hymselfe, and contrarywise ignoraunce of hym selfe is the beginning of dampnation, and of all euill that may befall vnto him.
            A question of a master Shepherde to a symple Shepherde to wete how he knewe hym selfe and he sayd. Shepherde tell me howe thou knowest thy selfe what arte thou, aunswere to me? And he sayde, I knowe my selfe, for I am a Christian man a Shepherde. What is to be a Shepherde. And he aunswered vnto that, thou askest what man is. I say that man is a substaunce composed of body and soule. The body is mortall and made of earth as beastes be, but the soule is made of spirituall matter as Aungels be immortall. My body is come of abhominable sinne, and as a sacke full of durte and fylth, and meate for wormes, my beginninge was vyle, my lyfe is payne, laboure, feare, and in subiection to death, and my end shalbe woful, but my soule is created of god nobly and worthely to hys owne Image and semblaunce after the Aungels, the most fayrest and perfyte of all creatures, by baptisme and by fayth is made his daughter, hys spouse, his heire of his realme, that is Paradyse, & for her noblenesse and dignitie ought to be a Lady, and my body as seruant ought to obey her, for reason hath ordeyned and will that it be so: and who that doeth otherwise, and preferreth his body before his soule, 
                  •
               eseth the vsage of reason: and maketh him selfe semblable vnto beastes
                  •
                discendinge from noble dignitie into myserable seruitude of sensualitie, by the which it is gouerned, so that I knowe my selfe man. As to the seconde, he demaundeth what thinge it is to be a Christian man? I aunswere in myne vnderstandinge, that to be a Christian man, is to be baptised or Christened, and folowe Iesus Christ, of whom we be sayde Christians, for to be baptised and not to folowe him, or to folowe him and not to be baptysed, saueth not man, and therefore when we receaue baptisme, we renounce the deuill and all his pompes, and we make promyse for to followe Iesu Christe, when we say (we will be baptised.) And who that kepeth this promyse hath the very name of a Christian man. And who that kepeth it not, is a sinner and a lyer to God, and seruaunte to the deuill, and is no more Christen then a deade man, or a payntynge on a wall, we say that is a man. Here demaundeth the maister Shep
                  •
               herde in howe manye thynges the Christian man ought to folowe Iesus Christe, for to accomplishe the promyse of Baptisme. The simple Shepherd aunswereth: I say in .vi. thinges. The firste is cleanesse of conscience, for there is no thinge more pleasaunte to God then a cleane conscyence, and it will be made cleane in two maners, one is by baptisme when we receaue it, and the other by pacience, that is contricion of harte, confession of mouth, satisfaction of worke, and then when we be clean we be pleasaunt to Iesu Christe, which with the water of his mercy clenseth the synners that doth penaunce, and maketh them fayre. The seconde thinge in which we ought to followe Iesu Christ, is humilitie, at the example of him.

Lorde of all the worlde, whiche humbled him to take our humanitie, and became mortall that was immortall, lyue in pouertie with vs, 
                  •
               eate oppropried paynes, and finally suffer to be crucified. Thus the Christian man ensuinge hym ought to meeke hym selfe. The thirde thinge is to holde and loue truth, and specially three truthes. The firste truthe is to knowe our selfe, for we be mortall and sinnefull, and who that dyeth in sinne shalbe damned, & this truth witholdeth sinne, and exhorteth the sinner to do penaunce and amende. The seconde trueth is of temporall goodes, for they be transitory and must be lefte and this truth disprayseth them to desire the heauenly goods that be eternal. The thyrde truthe is of God, which is the ioye that all Christian men ought to desire, and this truth draweth the Christian man to loue and induseth him to do good workes for to meryte the ioyes of Paradyse. The fourth thynge wherein euery man ought to followe Iesu Christe, is pacyence in aduersitie, and in the spirite of lyfe by penaunce, confirminge of oure selfes in the state of Iesu Christe, of whome the lyfe was all in paine and pouertie which he endured for vs. The fyfth is in compassion of the poore, to the example of Iesu Chryste, that by his mercy healed the poore of all corporall infirmities, and the sinners of all ghostly sicknes, and we by compassion oughte to geue of our goodes to poore folke, and comforte them bodely and ghostly. The syxth thing wherein the Christian man ought to followe Iesu Christe, is doloure, deuotion, charitie, in contemplacion of the mysteries of his natiuitie, of his death and passion, of his resurrection, of his ascension, and of his aduaunsing to the iudgemente, that often tymes ought to be at our harte by holy medytacions. And as to the last, what thing a Shepherd is. I say that it is the knowledge of my vocation, as eche hath his, as afore is sayd, and also to knowe the transgressions of all these foresayde thynges, howe manye tymes in eche we haue transgressed, for many tymes we haue offended God, and who that taketh hede shall 
                  •
               inde omissions and offences without number, the which knowen, we ought to doubt and eschew, and do penance. And thus it is as I know man is Christen and Shepherde.

            Company often with women, and tempte them to sinne
            Desire thy neighbours wife, and his goodes to be thine
            Do thus hardely and care not therfore
            And thou shalt dwell with me in hell euermore
            Thou shalt lye in frost and fyre, with sicknes and hunger
            And in a thousand peeces thou shalt be torne a sunder
            yet thou shalt dye euer and neuer be deade
            Thy meate shalbe todes, and thy drinke boyling leade
            Take no thought for the blud that God for thee shed
            And to my kingdome thou shalt be straight led.

                     IN hell is great mourning
                  Great trouble of crying
                  Or thunder and noyses roaring
                  With great plenty of wilde fier
                  Beating with great strokes like gunnes
                  With great frost and water running
                  And after that a bitter winde comes
                  Which goeth through the soules with yre
                  There is both thirst and hunger
                  Fiendes with hookes pulleth their flesh
                  They fight and curse, and eche other redemes
                  With the sight of the deuils dreadable
                  There is shame and confusion
                  Rumour of conscience for euill liuing
                  They curse them selues with great crying
                  In stinke and smoke euermore lying
                  With other great paynes innumerable.

The horse sygnifieth the sinner that hath a pale coloure, for the infirmitie of synne, and beareth deathe, for synne is death to the soule, and hell foloweth for to englut and swalowe him if he die impenitent.

                     •
                  ence, compassyon, benygnitie, and concorde. Grace is by the whych is shewed an effectuall seruyce of beneuolence amongest friendes, from one friende to an other. Peace is tranquillitye and reste well ordeyned of the courages of them that be concording vnto God. Pittie is affection and desyre to succoure and helpe eche one, and commeth of swetenesse and grace, of beninge thought and courage that one hath. Swetenesse is by the whych tranquilitie and reste of courage of hym that is sweete and honest by none improbyte, ne by any poynte of dishonestie. Mercy is a pitifull vertue and equall dignation to all, with inclination of compacient courage in them that susteyne affliction. Indulgence is remission of the euyll doinge of other, by the consideration of him selfe that he hath offended dyuers, to haue remyssion of God for the offences that he hath done. Compassion is a vertue the whych engendreth an affection or condolent courage for the doloure and affliction that he seeth in hys neyghboure. Benignitie is an a

                  daunt regarde of courage, and dyligence from one friende to an other, wyth a resplendyshinge doulsure and swetenesse of good maners that one hath. Concorde is a vertue that commeth of conuenaunce of courages concorded, and alyed in right undefyled, in such wyse that they abyde vnied and conioyned stedfastly without duplicitie or vnstablenesse of thoughte or courage.
            
            
               Of Fayth.
               
                  FAyth is a vertue by the true knowledge of vysible thinges hauing his thought eleuate in holy studyinge for to come to the beliefe of thinges that we see not, and these byn the braunches. Relygion, Clennesse, Obedience, Chastitie, Continence, Uirginitie, and Affection. Relygion is by the whych ben exercised and done the diuine seruyces to God, and vnto hys sayntes with great reuerence, and greate dilygence, the which seruices ben done ceremonely and swetely. Clennesse or virginitie is integrate well and purely kept, as well in body as in soule, for the regarde that a man hath of the loue or feare of God. Obedyence is a voluntary and free adnegation and renounsing of his owne wil by pitiful deuotion. Chastitie is clenlynesse and the honeste habitude of all the body, by ardaunte heate and furiositie of vyces so domaged and holden subiectes. Continence is by the which the impituo
                     •
                  itie of carnall desires ben refrayned and wytholden by a moderation of counsell taken of him selfe or of other. Affection is effusion

of pitifull loue to his neighbour, comminge of a reioysinge conceaued of good fayth in them that they loue. Liberalitie is a vertue by the which the lyberall courage is not kept by any maner of couetise, for doinge plenteous largition of his goodes without excesse, but moderately to them that haue nede.
            
            
               Of Hope.
               
                  HOpe is a mouynge of courage abyding stedfastly to take and haue the thynges that a man appetyteth and desyreth, of the whych the braunches byn Contemplacion, Ioye, Honestie, Confession, Pacience, Compunction, and Longanimitie. Contemplacion is the death and destruction of carnall affections, by an interiour reioysinge of thought, eleuate to compryse hye thinges. Ioye is iocunditie Spirituall commyng of the contemptinent of the thynges presente and worldly. Honestie is a shame by the whych a man yeldeth himself humble toward euery man of the which commeth a laudable profit, with faire custome and honesty. Confession is by the which the secrete sicknesse of the soule is reuelate and shewed vnto the confessor to the praysing of God, with hope to haue mercy. Pacience is will, and inseperable sufferance of aduersary and contrary thinges for hope of eternall glory that we desire to haue. Compunction is a dolour of great value, sighing for feare of the compunction diuine, or for loue of the payment that we abide. Longanimitie is infatigable will to accomplish the holy and iust desires that a man hath in his thought.
            
            
               Of Prudence.
               
                  PRudence is diligent keping of himselfe with dyscreate prouidence, to knowe and dyscerne which is good, and whych is bad, and the braunches are these. Feare of God, Counsell, Memory, Intellygence, Prouidence, and Deliberation. Feare of God is a diligent keepinge, that wakeneth on a man by fayth, and good manners of the diuine commaundementes. Counsell is a subtyll regarde of thoughtes, that the causes of such thinges that a man wold do, or that a man hath in gouernaunce, be well examyned and broughte about. Memorye is a representacyon imaginatyse by regarde of the thought of thynges pretermes and passed that a man hath seene and done, or heard recounted and tolde. Intelligence is for to dyspose by viuacitie reasonable or euidently the state of the tyme present, or of the thinges that byn nowe. Prouydence is by the whych

a man gathereth in hym the aduenement of the thinges to come, by prudente subtilitie and regarde of the thinges passed. Delyberation is a consyderation replenyshed of maturitie and esperaunce tofore the beginning of such thinges as one hath delybered and purposed to do or make.
            
            
               Of Attemperance.
               
                  ATtemperaunce is a stedfast and a dyscrete domynation of reason agaynst the impytious mouinges of the courage in things illycitie and vnlawefull, and these be hys braunches. Discretion, Moralitie, Taciturnitie, Fasting, Sobernesse, Affliction, and Dispraysing of the world, Dyscretion is a reason prouyded and assured, and moderate of the humayne mouinges, to iudge and dyscerue the cause of all thynges. Moralytye is to be tempered and ruled iustly and sweetely, by the maners of them wyth whome they be conuersaunt, kepynge alwayes the vertue of nature. Taciturnitie is to attempre hym selfe of inutyle and dyshonest wordes, of the whych vertue commeth a frutefull teste vnto hym that so hym selfe modereth. Fasting is a vertue of dyscrete abstinence, the whych a man kepeth, ordeyned to wake and kepe the sanctifyed thynges interiores. Sobernesse is a vertue pure and immaculate attemperaunce of the one partie and of the other of man, that is of the body and soule. Affliction of body is it by the which the seedes of the wanton and wilfull thoughtes, by discrete chastisings be oppressed. Dispraysinge of the worlde is amorous loue, that a man or a woman hath to the spirituall thinges commyng, and hauyng no regarde to the caduke thinges and transytories of this world.
            
            
               Of Iustyce.
               
                  IUstyce is a vertue wherby grace of communitie is vpholden, and the dignity of euery person is obserued and their owne yelded, and the branches be these. Lawe, Streightnesse, Equitie, Correction, Obseruaunce, Iudgement, and Ueritie. Law is by the which all lawfull thinges be commaunded to be done, & to defende all thing that ought not to be done, Streightnes is by the which iuridike vēgance is prohibyte, and streightly is exercised iustyce to the transgressours that haue offended. Equity is a right worthy retribution of merite to the balance of iustyce right wisely and iustly thought. Correction is for to inhibyte and defende by the brydle of reason all errours, if any be accustomed for to do any euyll. Obseruaunce of swearinge is a Iustyce to constrayne any

noysyble transgression of lawe or customes prouu

                  gued to the people. Iudgement is by the which after the merites or demerytes of any persons hearde, is that he haue tourment or suffer death for his euill doinge, or guerdon and rewarde for his benefytes. Ueritie is that by the which any sayinges or doings be recited or shewed by approuable reason without to adiust, dimynishe, or to make it any otherwise then it is.

Reste is a vertue by the which a likernesse is geuen vnto the thought of contempment of the vnstablenesse of transitory things and worldly vanities. Stablenesse is for to haue the thought or courage stedfast and sure without castinge it on diuers things by any varying or changing of time or places. Perseuerance is a vertue that establisheth and confirmeth the courage by a perfection of vertues that is in a man, and be perfite by force of longanimitie. Reason is a vertue by the which a man commaundeth to do such thinges as be conceyled and delyuered for to come to the ende, whych a man knoweth to be good and vtyle to be done and had.

               ¶Thus endeth the Anotomy and Flubothomy of the humayne bodyes, and howe one should vnderstande them.
               
                  HEre before we haue sayde of the regarde of planets vpon the parties of man, and the deuision and number of the bones of mannes body, and now foloweth to know when any man is hole or sycke, or disposed in any wise to sicknesse. Wherefore three thinges ben, by the which Shepardes knowe when a man is hole or sycke, or disposed to sicknesse. If he be hole to maintaine and kepe him, if he be sicke, to serch remedy to heale him. If he be disposed to sicknesse to kepe him that he fall not therin. And for to know eche of the sayde three things, the Shepards put diuers signes. Health properly temperance, accorde, and equalitie of the iiii. equalities of man, which be hot, colde, dry, and moyste. The which when they be well tempered and equall, that one surmoun
                     •
                  e not the other, then the body of man is hole. But when they be vnequall and mistempred, that one domineth ouer another, then a man is sicke or disposed to sicknes, and they be the qualities that the bodies boldeth of the elementes, that they be made & composed of, that is to wyte of the fier heate, of the water colde, of the ayre moyst, and of the earth dry. The which qualities, when one is disordered from the other, then the body is sicke. And if that one destroy the other of all, then the body dieth, and the soule departeth.
            
         
         
            ¶Signes by the which Shepards knowe a man hole and wel disposed in his body. Capitulo .xxv.
            THe firste sygne whereby Shepardes knowe a man to be hole and well disposed in his body, is when he eateth and drinketh wel after the conuenaunce of the hunger and thirste that he hath wythout makinge excesse. Also when he digesteth lightly, and when that that he hath eaten and dronken empesheth and greueth not his stomake. Also when he feleth good sauour and appetite in that he eateth and drinketh. Also when he is hungry and thirsty at the houres that he ought to eate and drinke. Also when he reioyseth

hym wyth mery folke. Also when they playe gladly any playe of recreation wyth felowes of mery courage. Also when he playeth gladly in fieldes and woddes to take the sweete ayre, and sporte in medowes by water sydes. Also when he eateth gladly & with good appetite, of butter, cheese, flawnes, shepe mylte, wythout leauyng any thynge in his dyshe to sende to the almes house. And when he sleepeth well wythout rauynge, dreamyng of his marchandyse. Also when he feleth him light, and that he walketh well. Also when he sweateth soone, and that neseth lyttle or nothyng. Also when he is neyther to fatte ne to leane. Also when he hath good coloure in his face, and that hys wittes ben all well disposed for to do their operacion, as his eyen for to see, hys eares to heare, his nose to smell
                  •
                &c. And thus we leaue of the conuenance of age, the disposition of the body, and also of the tyme. 
                  〈◊〉
                other sygnes I saye nothinge, but these be the most common, and that ought to suffise for shepardes to know the signes of health.
            
               Signes opposyte to the precedentes, by the which Shepardes knowe when they or other ben sycke.
               
                  FIrst when he may not well eate ne drinke, or that they haue none appetite to eate at dinner & supper, or when he fyndeth no sauour in that he eateth or drinketh, or that he is hungry and maye not eate, when his dygestion is not good, or that it be to longe. Also when h
                     •
                   goeth not to chamber moderately as he ought to do. Also when he is heauy and sad in ioyous companyes, then syckenesse constreyneth a man to be thoughtfull. Semblably when he may not sleepe or take hys rest aright and at due houre. Also when his members ben heauy, as his head, his legges, and his armes. And also when he may not walke easely and lyghtly, and that he sheweth not often, and his coloure is pale or yelowe, or when hys wyttes, as his eyen, his eares, & the other do not kindly their operations. In likewise when he may not labour and trauel. Also when he forgetteth lightly that which of necessitie ought to be kept in memory, and when he spitteth often, or when his nosethrilles aboundeth in superfluous humours. And when he is negligent in his workes, and when his flesh is blowen or swollen in the vysage, in hys legges, or his secte, or when his eyen be holowe in his heade. These ben the sygnes that sygnifyeth a man being in sickenesse, and who that hath most of the foresayd signes, most is sicke.
            
         
         
            Other maner of signes almost semblable to them aboue sayd, and sheweth the replexion of euill humours for to be purged of them. Cap. xxvi.

sayde humoures that they engendre no sickenes, & byn broken by the signes that foloweth. ¶Fyrst when a man hath ouer greate rednesse in the face, in the handes, or in the nayles, hauynge also the veines full of bludde, or blede to much at the nose, or to often, or to haue peyne in the forheade.

            ¶Thus fynysheth of the sygnes, by the which Shepardes know when they byn ole and well dysposed, and other sygnes opposyts, by the whiche they knowe when they bin syck or euill disposed.

And in eche of these quarters they gouerne them as the seasons requyreth to theyr myndes, & the better it is for them. And as the

Upon the earth is the water or the sea, but it couereth not al the earth, to thende that men and beastes may lyue therin, & the partie that is vncouered is called the face of the earth, for it is as the face of man alwayes vncouered, and the parte that is couered with water is as the body of man that is clothed & hidde, On the water is the ayre that encloseth the earth and the water, and is deuyded in three regions, one is lowe where as en habiteth beastes & byrdes, an other meane where as bin the cloudes, the whiche make the impressions, as lightninghes, thonders, and other, & is alway colde, the thirde is the hyeste, where as is neyther winde ne rayne, nor tempest, nor other impression, & ther be some mountaines that atteyneth vnto it, as is olimpus that recheth the hyest region of the ayre, and the element of fyre mounteth vnto the skie, & the elementes susteyneth the skies as the pyllers or beames susteyneth a house Of such mountaynes is one in Affryke named Athlas.

Orient into Occident aboue the earthe, and from occident in the Orient vnder it, that is called the dyurnall mouynge, that is to saye, that it maketh from daye to daye, xxiiii. houres by the whiche mouynge the ix. skye that is the fyrste mobyle, draweth after and maketh the other skies to tourne that byn vnder it. The other mouynge is of the .vii. planettes, and is from Occident to Orient aboue the earth, and from Orient into the Occident vnder it, and is contrary to the fyrste, and byn the two mouynges that

Shepardes knowlegeth, and how wel that they byn opposites, yet moue thei contynually and bin possible as it is shewed by example. If a ship on the sea came from Orient into Occident, and that he of his owne mouyng wēt in the shyppe softly towarde Orient, this man should moue a double mouyng wherof one snuld be of the shyppe, and of hymselfe together, and the other shuld be of his owne mouynge that he maketh softely towarde Orient. Semblably ye planettes byn transported with theyr skie from Oryent into Occidente by the dyurnall mouynge of the fyrst mobyle, but later and otherwyse then the fyxed sterres, by that, that eche planete hath his propre mouinge contrary to the mouynge of the sterrer, for the moone maketh a course lesse in a monthe about the earthe then a sterre fyxed, and the sonne a course lesse in a yere, & the other planettes in certeyne time eche after the quantitie of his mouyng. Thus it appereth that the planettes moue two mouynges: som Shepardes say, pose by imagnation that all the skies seassed to moue of the dayly mouinge, the moone wolde make a course in goynge from the Occidēt into the Orient in as much tyme as lasteth now .xxvii. dayes, and viii. houres, and Mercury

For the zodyake crosseth crokedly, & the places where it crosseth bin sayd Equinoctialles. For to vnderstand the Equinoctial

                we se sensybly al the skie tourne from Orient into Occident, & it is called the dayly mouynge or diurnal, thē ought one to imagine a streight lyke that passeth through the myddle of the earth, commyng from the one ende of the sky to the other, about the which lyne is made this mouynge, & the two endes byn two pointes in the skie that moueth not, and byn called the poles of the worlde, of the which one is ouer vs, by the sterre of the north, that alwayes apereth to vs, and is the pole Artike or Septemtrional, and the other is vnder the earth, alwayes hyd called the pole Antartike, or pole Austral, in the middes of the which pole in the fyrste mobile is the circle Equinoctiall egally before in the partie, as in the other of the sayde poles, & after this cyrcle is made and measured the daily mouing of xxiiii. houres that is a natural day and it is called Eqinoctial, for that when the sonne is in it, the daye & the nyght byn equal through all the worlde. The large zodyake as sayd is in the fyrst mobyle, also it is as a girdle manerly fygured and sette with Images of sygnes entrayled subtylly and well composed, and sette with fyxed sterres as shyning carbuncle or precious gemmes full of great vertue, set by maistrysse ryght nobly adourned, in the which zodyake be foure principall poyntes, that deuideth them equally in foure parties. One is hye called the solstyce of sōmer. which when the sonne is entred in Cancer, it is the longest day of Sommer. Another is lowe called the solstice of winter, which is when the son is entred in Capricorne, then it is the shortest daye of winter, and mene call it equinoctial of haruest that the sonne entreth in Libra in the moneth of September. And the other is called Equinoctiall of prymetime that the sonne entreth in Aries in the moneth of March. The which foure parties deuyded eche in thre equall parties maketh twelue parties, that bene called sygnes, named Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Uirgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricornus, Aquarius and Pisces. Aryes beginneth in the Equinoctiall, and crosseth the zodyake, and when the sonne is, there it begynneth to declyne, that is to say, aprochyng Septemtrion, and towarde vs it extendeth to the orient Then is Taurus seconde, Gemini the thyrde, and so of other as the fygure, hereafter sheweth.

               Of two great circles, that is to say one Meridien, and the other Oryson, that intersequeth the one the other, and crosseth dyrectly.
               
                  MEridien is a great circle imagined on the skie, which passeth by the poles of the worlde, and by the poynt of the skye right ouer oure heades, the which is called Zenych, and when the sonne is commen ouer fro Orient vnto that circle it is midday, and therefore it is called Meridien, and the halfe of that circle is ouer the earth and the other vnder it that passeth by the poynt of midnight directly opposite to Zenych, and when the sonne toucheth the part of the circle it is midnight, and if a man go toward Orient or Occident he hath new Meridien, and therefore it is soner midday to them that be toward Orient then to other, if a man stande styll his Meridien is one styll, or if he go toward mydday or septemtrion, but yf he styrre he hath other Zenych, and these two cyrcles crosseth directly: oryzon is a great circle that deuideth the partie of the skie that we see from that we se not. And Shepardes say that if that a man were in a playne country he shold se iustly halfe of the skye, the which they cal theyr emyspery, that is to say half spere & orizon is ioyning nyghe to the earth, of the which orizon the entre is the myddle, and is the place in the which we byn, thus eche is alwayes in the myddes of his oryson, and zenich is the pole, & as a man transporteth him fro one place to another, he is in the other places against the skye & hath other zenych & other ozyron, all oryson is right other oblyke. They haue right ozyron that habydeth vnder the Equinoctiall, & haue theyr zenych in the eqinoctial, 
                     •
                  or theyr ozyron intersequeth and deuydeth the equinoctiall euen by the two poles of the worlde, in such wyse that none of the poles of the world is reysed aboue theyr ozyron, ne depriued ynder it, but they that habiteth other where then vnder equinoctial haue theyr ozyron oblyke, for theyr ozyrn foloweth and deuydeth the equinoctiall sydeway, and not ryght, and there appereth to thē of all tymes one of the poles of the worlde reysed aboue theyr ozyron, and the other ben euer hyd, so that they se them not, more or lesse after diuers habitations, & after that they be of fernesse fro the Equinoctial, & the more that the one pole is reysed the more is the ozyron oblyke, and the other pole depryued and is to wete that there is as much distance fro the ozyron to the pole, as is 
                     ••
                  o the zenych to the Equinoctiall, and that zenych is the fourth parte of meridien or the myddes of the bowe dyurnall, of the which the two endes be on the ozyron. And also that of the pole vnto the equinoctial is the fourth party of all the roundnesse of the skies, and also of the meridien circle syth it passeth by the poles and crosseth the equinoctiall directly. ¶Example of the ozyron of Paris after the opinion of Shepardes, ouer the which Ozyron they saye

that the pole is reysed xli

                  . degrees, wherefore they say also that fro the zenich of Paris vnto the equinoctial be .xlix. degrees, and that fro the Ozyron vnto the Zenych is the fourth partie of the Meridien oyrcle be .lxxxx. degrees, and fro the pole to the zenych be .xli. degrees, and fro the pole vnto the solstyce of Sommer be .lxii. degrees, and fro the solstyce vnto the equinoctial ben .xxxiii. degrees, there be fro the pole vnto the equinoctiall .lxxxx. degrees, and is the fourth part of the roundnes of the skye, from the equinoctial vnto the solstyce of Wynter be .xxxiii. degrees, and fro the solstice vnto the ozyron .xviii. Thus shall the equinoctiall be reysed ouer the ozyron .xli. degrees, and the solstyce of sommer .lxiiii. degrees, in the which solstyce is the son at the houre of noone the longest day of sommer, and then it entreth into Cancer and is most nerest to our habytable parties that may be. And when the sonne is in the solstyce of Wynter, the shortest day of the yere at the houre of noone it entreth into Capricornus: and the sayd solstyce is not reysed ouer the ozyron of Paris but viii. degrees. The which eleuations and rysings a man may fynde playnely so that he know one onely, and in euery region in lykewise after the situation.

            Of the rysing and resconsyng of the sygnes in the ozyron. Capitulo .xxxv.
            
               
               Ozyron and emyspery differred, for ozyron is the cyrcle that deuydeth the partie of the skye that we se from that vnder the earth that we se not. Also Ozyron is a cyrcle that moueth not, but as we moue fro one place to another, but emyspery turneth continually, for one partye ry
                  •
               eth and mounteth ouer Ozyron, and the other part resconseth and entreth vnder it, thus Ozyron ryseth ne resconseth, but ye commeth aboue rysethe, and that which goeth vnder resconseth, Merydien also ryseth not ne resconseth. Equi noctiall is the diurnell circle that ryseth and resconseth regulerly, asmuche in one houre as in another, & all in xxiiii. houres zodyake the large cyrcle, & oblyke whereon the sygnes byn, ryseth and resconseth al on a daye natural, but not regulerly, for it ryseth more in one houre then in an other, for that is euer ouer our ozyron is oblyke, and deuydeth the zodyake in two partes, wherof one is euer ouer our ozyron, and the other vnderneth. Thus halfe of the sygnes ryseth ouer our ozyron euery day artificial be it shorte or longe, and the other halfe by nyght, wherfore it behoueth that in the dayes that be shorter then the nyghtes the sygnes riseth sooner, and in longe dayes more at leyser, and thus the zodyake ryseth not regulerly in these parties as the Equinoctiall, but there is double variaciō, for half of the zodyake that is from the begynnynge of Aries vnto the ende of Uirgo al together taketh as much tyme in rysynge as halfe of the Equinoctiall that is by it, and they begyn to ryse in a moment, and ende in a momente also. But this halfe of the zodyake rysethe sooner in the begynning, and this halfe of the Equinoctial more at leyser, and this is called theyr obliquement. Also the other halfe of the zodyake that is from the beginninge of Libra vnto the ende of Pisces, and halfe of the Equinoctial that is by it, begynneth and leueth to ryse together but the Equinoctial in that party in the beginninge ryseth sooner, and the zodyake more at leyser, and this is called rysyng directely. And whether that ryseth sooner the Equinoctial or the zodyake, yet alwayes they ende together. Example of the two mouynges aforesayde, as yf two men went from London to Uvyndsore and departed bothe together and that at the begynninge the one go fast and the other softely, he that goth

               ereth more then 
                  •
               alfe the Equinoctial, so that this halfe ryseth all ryght, and the other halfe of the zodyake ryseth oblykely.

            Of the variation that is for diuers habitations and regions of the earth. Cap. xxxvii.
            
               SHepeherdes say that if it were possible that the earth were inhabyted all about, and pose the case that it were so, firste they that inhabite vnder the Equinoctiall haue alwayes the dayes and the nyghts equall, and haue the .ii. poles of the world at the two corners of their orizon, and may see al the sterres when they see the two poles, and the sunne passeth twyse in a yere ouer them, that is when it passeth by the Equinoctials. Thus the sunne is to them the one halfe of the yere towarde the pole Artike, and the other halfe towarde the other pole, and therfore they haue two winters in a yere without great colde, one is when we haue winter, and the other when we haue sommer. Semblably they haue two sommers, one is in March when we haue prime time, and the other in September when we haue haruest, and by this they haue foure solstices, two hie when the sunne passeth by their zenich, and two lowe when it declineth one way or other, and thus they haue four vmbres or shadowes in a yere, for when the sunne is in the equinocces twise in a yere, in the morninge their shadowes be in the Occidente, and at night in the Oriente, and then at noone they haue no shadowes, but when the sunne is in the signes septentrionals their shadowes be towarde the parties of the signes meridionals, and so againeward. Secondly they that inhabite betwene the Equinoctiall and the Tropike of sommer, haue in likewise two sommers and two winters, and four shadowes in a yere, and they haue no difference of the first, saue that they haue longer dayes in sommer, and shorter in winter, for as the Equinoctiall lengeth, in likewise doth the dayes in sommer, and in that part of the earth is the first climate and almost halfe of the seconde, and is named Araby wherin is Ethiopia. Thirdly they that inhabite vnder the Tropike of sommer haue the sunne ouer their heades, and at the day of the solstice of sommer at noone, they haue their shadowes smaller then we haue, and there is a parte of Ethiopic. Fourthly they that be betwene the Tropike of sommer and the circle Artike haue longer dayes in sommer then the abouesayde, in as much as they be farther from the Equinoctiall, and shorter in winter, and they haue the sunne ouer their heades, ne toward septentrion, and that part of the earth we inhabite. Fifthly they that inhabite vnder the circle Artike haue the ecliptike of the zodiake to their orizon, and when the sunne is in the solstice of sommer, it resconseth not, & thus they haue no night, but natural dayes of .xxiiii. houres. Semblably when the sunne is in the solstice of winter it is natural day when they haue contynuall nyght, and that the sunne ryseth not to them. Sixthly they that be betwene the circle Artike and the pole Artike, haue in sommer dyuers naturall dayes, that be to them one day artificiall without any night. And also in winter be many natural dayes, which are to them alwaies night, and the more that it approcheth the pole, the more is the artificial day of sommer longe, and dureth in some place a weke, in other a moneth, in other two, in other three, in other more, and proporcionally the night is greater, for some of the signes be euer on their Oryzon, and some alwayes vnder, and as longe

as the Sunne is in the signes aboue it is day, and while it is in the signes vnderneth it is night. Seuenthly they that inhabite right vnder the pole haue the sunne halfe of the yeare on their Orizon, and haue continuall day, and the other halfe of the yere continuall night, and the Equinoctial is in their orizon that deuideth the signes, six aboue and six beneath, wherfore when the sunne is in the signes that be hye, and towarde them they haue continuall day: and when it is in the signes toward midday, they haue continual nyght, and thus in a yere they haue but one day and one night. And as it is sayde of that parte of the earth toward the pole Artyke, a man may vnderstand of the other halfe, and of the habitations towards the pole Antartike.

Of the whych eche hath hys longitude determined, and the latitude also, and the nerer they be to the Equinoctiall the longer they be, and larger, & procede in longitude from Orient to Occident, and in latytude from midday to septentrion. The first climate after some Shepherds conteyneth in length halfe of the circuite of the earth, that is two hundred thousande & .iiii. hundred myle, & it hath an hundred thousande & two hundred myle of length. The seconde, and so of the other, for the lessing of the earth comming toward Septentrion. To vnderstande what a clymate is after the sayinge of Shepardes. A clymate is a space of earth equally large, wherof the length is from Orient to Occident, & the bredth is comming fro midday, and fro the earth in habitable toward the Equinoctiall drawing to septentrion, as much as an 
                     ••
                  
                  rolege or clocke chaungeth not. For in earth habitable the clockes change .vii. times in the bredth of the climates. It is of necessitie to say that they be .vii. & where the variation of horologes is, there is the dyuersitie of clymates, howe be it that such variation properly ought to be taken in the myddes of the clymates, and not in the beginninge or ende, for the proximitie and couenaunce the one of the other. Also one climate hath alwayes a day artificiall of sōmer shorter or longer then another climate, & this day sheweth the differēce in the middes of euery climate better then in the beginning or ende, the which thing we may sensibly know at eye, and therby iudge the difference of the clymates. And it is to be noted that vnder the Equinoctiall the dayes and the nyghtes in all tymes are equall, eche of twelue houres, but comming toward Septentrion the dayes of sommer longeth, & the wynter dayes shorteth, and the more that one aprocheth septentriō the more waxeth the dayes in such wise, that at the fyne of the last clymate the dayes in sommer be longer by thre houres and

an halfe, then they be at the begynnynge of the fyrst, and the pole is more reysed by .xxxviii. degrees. At the begynnyng of the fyrst clymate, the longest day of sommer hath xii. houres and xlv. minutes, & in the pole is reysed on the oziron xii. degrees and xlv. mynutes, and the myddes of the clymate the longest daye hath .xiii. houres, and the pole reysed .xvi. degrees, and the latytude dureth vnto the longest day of sommer, that is .xiii. houres and .xv. minutes, and the pole reysed .xx. degrees and an halfe, the whych largenes is .ccc.xl. myle of earth. The seconde clymate begynneth at the ende of the fyrste, and the myddes is there as the day hath .xiii. houres & an halfe, and the pole is reysed ouer the ozyron .xxiiii. degrees and .xv. mynutes. And the latytude dureth vnto there as the longest daye hath .xiii. houres and .xlv. mynutes, and the pole is reysed .xxvii. degrees and an halfe, and thys largenes conteyneth of earth, cccc. myle iust. The thyrde clymate begynneth at the ende of the seconde, and the myddes is there as the day hath .xiii. houres, & the pole is reysed xxx. degrees and .xlv, minutes, and the latytude extendeth vnto there as the lōgest daye hath .xiiii. houres and .xv. mynutes, and the pole is reysed .xxiii. degrees, and .xl. mynutes.

               A marueylous consyderation of the great vnderstanding of Shepeherdes.
               
                  IF case were after the length of the climates one might go about the earth fro Orient to Occident to his first place, some Shepards say that this cōpasse may almost be made. Saying that if a man went this cōpasse in .xii. naturall dayes going regulerly toward Occident

and began nowe at midday, he should passe euery day naturall the .xii. parte of the circuite of the earth, and be .xxx. degrees whereof behoueth that the sonne make a course about the earth, and .xxx. degrees ferther or he be retourned on the morowe at the merydien of the sayde man, and so the sayde man shoulde haue his day & night of .xxvi. houres, and should be farther by the .xii. part of a naturall day then if he rested him, wherfore it followeth of necessitie, that in xii. naturall dayes the sayd man should onely haue but xi. dayes and .xi. nights & somewhat lesse, & that the sunne should light him but .xi. times, & resconse .xi times, for .xi. dayes and .xi. nightes, euery day and nyght of .xxvi. houres maketh .xii. naturall dayes, eche day of .xxiiii. houres. By semblable consideration behoueth that an other man that should make this course going toward Orient haue his day and night shorter then a naturall day by .ii. houres, then his day and night should be but of .xii. houres. Then if be made this course in like space, that is to say in .xii. dayes and somewhat more. Thus if Iohn made the course toward Occident, and Peter towarde Orient, and that Robert abode them at the place fro whence they departed the one as sone as the other, and that they meete at Robert both together. Peter would say that he had two dayes and two nightes more then Iohn, & Robert that had rested a day lesse then Peter, and a day more then Iohn, howe well that they haue made this course in .xii. naturall dayes, or an hundred, or in ten yere, all is one. This is a pleasant consideration among shepardes, how Iohn and Peter arriueth one selfe day, put case it were on sonday. Iohn wold say it is saterday, Peter wold say it is monday, and Robert would say it is sonday.
            
         
         
            ¶Of the Pomell of the skyes a sterre named the sterre of the North, neere to pole Artike called Septentrionall. Cap. xxxviii.
            
               AFter the abouesaid things here wil we speake of some sterres in perticuler. And first of them that Shepards cal the pomel of the skies, or sterre of the north, wherfore we ought to knowe that we see sensibly the sky turne from Orient to Occident by the diurnal mouing that is of the first mobile, which is made on two points opposites that be the poles of the skie, of the which one we see, and it is the pole Artike, and the other we see not, that is the pole Antartike or of midday, which is alwaye hyd vnder the earth. By the pole Artike that we see is the sterre most approched that shepards call the pomell of the skye, the which they say is the highest and most stedfast from vs, & by the which they haue the knowledge that thei haue of the other sterres and parts of the skie. The sterres that be by the said pomel go neuer vnder the earth, of the which be the sterres that make the chariot, & diuers other, but they that be far from it, go sometime vnder the earth, as the sunne, the moone, & other planets. Under this pomel directly is the angle of the earth, in the place where against the sunne is at the houre of midnight.
            
               
               Of Andromeda a sterre fyxed.
               Aries is a signe hot and dry, that gouerneth the head of man and the face, and the regions, Babylon, Percy, and Araby. And sygnifieth small trees, and vnder him at the .xvi. degree ryseth a sterre fyxed named Andromeda, that Shepardes figureth a mayde in her haire vpon the brinke of the sea, set to be deuoured of the monsters of the sea, but Perseus sonne of Iupiter fought with his sworde against the sayde monster and slewe it, and then the sayde Andromeda was deliuered. They that be borne vnder her constellation be in daunger of prison, or to dye in pryson, but if a good planet take regarde, then scape not death and prison. Aries is the exaltacion of the sunne at the .xix. degree, and Aries is the house of Mars with Scorpio where he is most.
            
            
               Of Perseus a sterre fyxed lorde of the spere.
               Taurus hath the trees, plantes, and ympes, and gouerneth of man the necke and the throte bol, the regions, Ethiopy, Egipt, and the country about, and vnder the .xxii. degree riseth a sterre fyxed of the first magnitude, that shepardes call Perseus sonne of Iupiter, that smote of the head of Meduse, who made all them to dye that behelde ber, and by no maner they might eschew it. Shepardes say that when Mars is conioyned with this sterre, they that be borne vnder the constellation shall ha

               THe heauens and the earth may be deuyded in foure partes by two circles, which crosseth directly ouer the two poles, and crosseth foure times the Equinoctiall line. Ech of the foure partes deuided into three equally, is in all .xii. equall parts, as wel in the skye as in the earth, which shepherds call houses, and be twelue. Of the which sixe be alwayes aboue the earth, and sixe vnder it, and these houses moueth not, but be alwayes eche in their place, and the signes and planets passeth by them always once in .xxiiii. houres. Three of these houses be from Orient to midnight going vnder the earth, the first the second and the third, wherof the fi

The fourth that beginneth at midnight comming in Occident is named the house of partrimony. The fifth folowing is the house of sonnes. The sixt finisheth in Occident, vnder the earth is the house of sicknes. The seuenth beginneth in Occident on the earth, and stretcheth toward midday, & is the house of mariage. The eight is the house of death. The ninth finishinge at midday is called the house of fayth, of re

And the twelfth that fynisheth in orient on the earthe is named the house of charitie, but this matter is diffycile, for Shepardes knowledging the nature and propertie of euery of the sayde twelue houses, and departeth them lightly and suffyseth of that is sayde with the fygure present.

            HE that wyll wete howe Shepardes know whiche planete raygneth euery houre of the day and the night And which planet is good, & which is bad, ought to know the planette of the day & seke therfore. The firste temporal houre of the sonne rysynge that day is for the sayde planet. The seconde houre is for the planet ensuynhe, & the thyrde for the other as they byn here fygured by ordre, and it behoueth to go from Sol to Uenus, Mercury & Luna them come ageyne to Saturne vnto xii. that is the houre before the son goynge downe, and incontinent after the son is downe begynneth the fyrste houre of the nyght that is for the .xiii. planet, & the seconde houre of the nyght for the xiiii. & so vnto xii. houres for the nyghte, that is the nexte houre before the sonne rysynge and come directly fallyng vpon the xxiiii. planet, that is next before that of the day folowynge. And thus the day hath xii. houres, and the nyght xii. also the whych be temporal houres, different to the houres of the clockes, the which be artificials. Shepardes sayd that Saturne and Mars be euyll planettes. Iupiter and Uenus good, Sol and Luna halfe good and halfe euyll. The parey toward a good planet is good and the party towarde the euyl planet is nought. Mercury conioyned with a good planette is good, and with an euyll planet he is nought and they vnderstande this as to 
                  •
               he inflicences good or euyll that bin of the sayde planetes there folowynge.
            
               The houres of the planets ben different to them of clockes, for the houres of clockes ben egall at all tymes eche of .lx. minutes, but they of the planets whē the dayes and the nightes be egall that the sonne is in one of the equinocces they be egal, but as sone as the dayes lengtheneth or shortneth, so dothe the natural houres, by this it is conuenient alway for the day to haue .
                  •
               ii tēporal houres, & the nyght also, and when the dayes be long, & the houres longe, and when the dayes ben short and the houres short, in lykewise is the night, and neuerthelesse an houre of the day, and an houre of the night together haue vi. score minutes, as many as two houres artyficialles, for that the one leueth the other taketh. And take we our planets, fro the sonne rysing, not before vnto the sonne goyng downe, and all the remenaunt is nyght.
            
               Example of that which is abouesayd.

                  es of clockes, and they bene xii. tēporals, let the viii. houres artificialles be deuided in xii. egall partes, and it shal be xii. tymes, xl. minuts, and euery partie shalbe a temporall houre yt shalbe of .xl. minutes and no mo. Thus in Decembre the tēporall houres of the day haue but .xl minutes, but the houres of the night haue foure score. For in that tyme the nightes haue xvi. houres artificialles, the which deuyded in twelue parts ben foure score minutes for euery temporall houre. Thus the houres of the nyghtes in Decembre haue foure score minutes & xl. for an houre of ye day. there ben syxe score minutes in two temporall houres, as many as in two houres artyficialles that be echē of xl. minuts. In Iune is the contrary, in Mars, and in September, all houres ben egall as the dayes ben in other monthes by egall portion. With euery planet here afore fygured ben the signes, which be the houses of the sayd planets, as it is aforesayd. Capricornus and Aquarius ben the howses of Saturne.

                     SAturne is the highest planette of all the seuen, he is mighty of hym selfe, he gyueth all the greate coldes and waters, yet he is drye and colde of nature, and he commeth into Cancer, and hys chiefe sygnes ben Aquarye and Capricorne, and he compasseth all the other Planettes. For Saturne is next vnder the fyrste mobile, that is, vnder the Chrystall skye, the which mobile moueth marueylously, for some Shepardes say that he causeth by his mouinge all other planettes to moue, and moueth the mobile aboue.
                  
                     Saturne is so hye that Shepardes can not wel measure it. For so hye reason hath

And much plenty of corne, and also much plenty of hogges, and greate trauayle on the earthe, and olde folke shall be very sickely, and many diseases shall raigne amonge the people, and specially in the chiefe houres of Saturne, and therfore this planet is likened to age, as harde, hungry, suspicious, and couetous, that seldome is content with any thinge. For Saturne is enemy to all things that groweth and beareth life of nature, for the colde and stormy bitternes of his time.

                     HE that is borne vnder Saturne shall be false, enuyous, and full of debate, and full of lawe, and he shall be cunnynge in coryinge of lether, and a great eater of breade and fleshe, and he shal haue a stinkynge breth, and he shalbe heauy, thoughtfull, and malycious, a robber, a fyghter, and full of couetyse, and yet he shall kepe councell well, and be wyse in councelyng, and he shall loue to synne wilfully, he shall be a greate speaker of tales, Iustes, and Chronycles, he shall haue lytle eyen, blacke haire, great lippes, brode shouldred, and shal loke downeward. He shal not loue sermons, ne to goe to the Church, and beware of hys handes, and beholde the ratell, and aboue his eares the planet doth raigne. And the chyldren of the sayde Saturne shalbe great iangelers and chyders, blacke & lene in the face, thinne bearded, euill langnaged, they shalbe full of lawe and vengeaunce, and wyll neuer forgyue tyll they be reuenged of theyr quarell, and lyke as the planet Saturne is colde, and causer of great frostes and snowes, ensemblably, and he that is borne vnder him shalbe cold in charitie, and not misericordious and mercifull, but vengeable, and wil neuer be intreated. And also they shalbe great cursers, and beare malyce longe in their myndes, and not forget it, and they loke to be obeyed and to haue great reuerence, and commonly will prayse them selfes, and talke to them selfe, and laugh at their owne conceyte, and all euils shal grow in them, and aboue all coloures he shall loue blacke colour best. The planet of Saturne gouerneth of man the ratell and aboue the eares as is aforesayde, and this planet is cause of hasty death, for bycause that he is colde and drye of nature, and therfore he is lykened to melancoly. And the sayd Saturne raigneth in Aquary, Capricorne, and Cancer, but specially in Aquary and Capricorne.

            Of the Phyzonomy of Shepardes.
            
               
            
            
               PHyzonomy of the which ben spoken afore, is a science that shepardes haue to know the naturall inclination of man and woman, good or euill, by dyuers signes on them in beholding them only. The which inclinatiō we ought to folow if it be good, but if it be euill by vertue and strength of vnderstandinge we ought to eschewe and auoyde it, as to the effecte, and to with stande the sayd euill inclinations, Shepardes vse this science none otherwise. The prudent vertuous and wise man, may be of all other, as touchinge their maners, otherwise then theyr sygnes demonstreth and sheweth in their reigne. Thus the things demonstred as to vice is not in a wise man though the signe be so, as an alestake or a signe is sometime hanged afore a house, in the which often times is none ale. For howe be it that a man by his wisedom and vnderstanding folow not the euil influences of the celestiall bodyes that be vpon him, & yet he corrupteth not the signes and demonstracions of the sayde influences, but those signes naturally haue signory and domination on them, in the which they be, for to haue naturally that which they signifie, though that a man haue them or not, wherfore Shepardes say that the most part of men and women folow their natural inclinations to vice or vertue, for that the most part of them be not wise and prudent as they ought to be, and they vse no vertue of their owne mindes, but ensueth their sensualitie, and by this the celestiall influence of the which is shewed by signes exteriors, and of such signes is the sayde science of Phyzonomy. For the which it behoueth firste to knowe that the time is deuided in four parts, as it hath ben said afore, that is to wit, Primetime, Sommer, Haruest, and Wynter, that he compared to the four elements. Prime time to the ayre, Sommer to the fyre, Haruest to the earth, and Winter to the water. Of the which foure elements, euery man and woman is formed and made, and without the which none may liue. The fyre is hot and dry. The ayre is hot and moyst. The water is moyste and colde. The earth is cold and dry. Also they say that the person on whom the fire domineth is colerike of complexion, that is to say hot and dry. He on whom the ayre domineth is sanguine of complexion, that is to say hot and moyst. He on whom the water domineth is flumatike of complexion, that is to say moyst and colde. He on whom the earth domineth is melancolike of complexion, that is to say colde and dry. The which complexions they knowledge and discerne the one fro the other by signes that be sayde hereafter.

               THe Colerike hath nature of fyre hot and dry, naturally is lene and sclender, couetouse, yrefull, hasty, brainlesse, folish, malicious, deceitful, and subtil where he applyeth his wit. He hath wine of the Lion, that is to saye, when he is dronken he chydeth, feighteth, and commonly he loueth to be cladde in blacke, russet and gray.
            The Sanguine hath nature of ayre, hote and moyst, he is large, plenteous, attempred, amiable, habundant in nature, mery, singing, laughing, lyking, ruddy, and gracious. He hath his wine of the ape, the more he drinketh the merier he is, and draweth to women, and naturally loueth hye coloured cloth.
            The Flumatike hath nature of water colde and moyste, he is heauy, slowe, sleepy, ingenious, commonly he spitteth when he is moued, and hath his wine of the shepe, for when he is dronken he accounteth him selfe wysest, and he loueth most greene coloure.
            The Melancoly hath nature of earth, colde and dry, he is heauy, couetous, a backbyter, malicious, and slowe. His wine is of the hog, for when he is dronken he desireth slepe, and to lye downe, and he loueth cloth of blacke colour.

            TO come to oute purpose of speaking of visyble sygnes, we will begyn to speake at the sygnes of the head. First we aduertise that one ought to beware of all persons that hath defaute of members naturally, as of sote, hand

Blacke haire and crispe signifieth melancoly, lechery, euil thought, & very large. Hanging haire signifieth wit with malyce. Great plenty of haire in a woman sygnifieth boistousnes & couetise. A person with great eyes is slouthfull, vnshame ful, inobedient, and weneth to know more then he doth, but when the eyen be meane, not to bygge nor to small, and that they be not to blacke nor to greene, such a man is of great vnderstanding, curteyse, faithfull & trusty. A person that is blere eyed, goggeled, and squint, signifieth malice, vengance, cautel, and treason.

It must be knowen that the sterre marked changed the place in .xv. dayes by the distynctyon of an houre, in a moneth of twayne. Wherefore it behoueth to take midnight in .xv. dayes farther by the distaunce of an houre, and in a moneth of two, and in two monethes of four, and in three

monethes of .vi. so that in .vi. monethes the sterre marked that was right vnder the Pomell shall be right ouer, and in other .vi. monethes it wyll come to the poynt where as it was first marked, and this sayd marked ster one ought not to change, but ought to chose it among many for the most knowledgeable and for the most to be founde amonge the other.
            
               By this present figure Shepardes know by night in the fieldes all seasons what time and houre it is, be it afore midnight or after.
            
            The .xxiiii. letters wythout the fygure byn for the .xxiiii. houres of a naturall day, and the .xii. within byn for the .xii. monethes. The sterre in the mids is the Pomell of the skyes, wyth the whych it behoueth to knowe one that is nexte it, whych shalbe a marked sterre, and it by the whyche one may knowe

the houres in the maner as before is sayde in taking mydnight in .xv. dayes furthermore by the distaunce of an houre.
            
            
               FOr to know by nighte the place againste mydday as that of mydnighte, the hye Oryent, and the hye occident, the lowe Orient and the lowe occident, and the place in the skye, ouer against which euerye signe ryseth. Shepardes vseth thys practyse. They hange a corde that is made stedfast aboue and beneth, then another with a plombe, that discendeth tyll it be tyme for to staye it that they may be a lyttle distaunce one from another, so that one maye see the flerre of the pomell right vnder the two cordes at once, then they staye the corde with the plombe aboue, or benethe. Now who that wyll see myddaye dyrectly be it night or daye, goe on the other syde of the cordes, and thou shalte see the place againste middaye. Then come on the first syde, and thou shalt se the place againste midnight though it be daye. For the hyest point of the Zodyake in the longest daye of Sommer, lette the sonne be seene vnder the two cordes at the houre of myddaye, and that he be so neere that he toche the cordes, and marke in the corde toward the sonne the heyghte that he hathe s

               ene it, then by nighte, marke some sterres that one maye alwaye knowe one, in the same place is the passage of the solstice of Sommer. And when the dayes ben at the shortest, the sterre that we see at mydnight in the sayde poynt of mydday ben directly they that ben next to the solstyce of sommer, the which hath the signe nexte towarde orient is Cancer, and the signe next towarde occident is Gemini. And it is sayde from the heyght of the solstyce of sommer, one may practyse the lowe solstyce of wynter, the which we see on the myddaye when the daye is at the shortest ouer the place against midnight, and his next signe towarde orient

is Capricorne, and that toward occident is Sagitarius. One may marke the hye orient or the low, but it behoueth that it be whē the days ben at the longest or shortest, and the distaunce betwene the two orients deuided in .vi. egall parties, by eche ryseth two signes, by the nerest partie of the hye orient ryseth Gemini and Cancer, by the second Taurus and Leo, by the third Aries & Uirgo, by the fourth Pisces and Libra, by the .v. Aquarius and Scorpius, by the .vi. more nere the occident Capricornus and Sagittarius, and dyuers other things that may be practised on the skye.

               IT behoueth for to thinke afore the beginninge of Matins on the wordes that Iesus sayde in the gardeyn, the nighte afore that he toke his blessed passion. Father if it be possible transporte fro me this chalyce. How be it my will be not done, but thine, and that in so sayinge, he suffered so great peyne, that he swete droppes of bludde in suche abundaunce that it ran downe to the grounde.
            And at Matis tyme it behoueth to thynke how as the traytour Iudas approched him to our Lord, & in kyssing him sayd. Aue rabi. I salute the mayster. And that the meke and benigne Iesus withdrewe not his visage from the traytoure, and howe he suffred him selfe to be taken and bounden as a thiefe and cast to the earth, defyled, spitten on, & lefte of his disciples and seruauntes.
            At Laudes it behoueth to thynke and Consyder, Iesus beinge in the house of Anna, and after in the house of Cayphas dispyteously beaten, blasphemed, stretched, and bespitten in his moste precious vysage, hys eyen bounden, and after troden vnder fote inhumaynely.
            At pryme it behoueth to thynke howe as Iesus was led from the house of Cayphas to Pylate, and the beatinges that he had. And how Pylate examined hym of that they had wrongefully accused him of, and howe he was cruelly beaten at a piller before a great multitude of people, and crowned with thornes.
            At Tyerce it behoueth to thynke howe Iesus was presented before the people with a crown of thornes
                  •
                clothed with a mantel of purple, and the cursed people cryed Crucifige Crucifige eum. And howe Pylate condempned hym to the most bytterful death, and how he bare the heauy crosse vppon his sacred shulders.
            At noone it behoueth too thinke howe Iesus was ledde to the mounte of Caluari shedinge his precious bludde, and how he fel diuers times vnder his crosse. And howe he was nalled with great blunt nailes, and the dolour that he suffred when it was let fall into the morteis. And thinke also of the douloures of his sorowefull mother.
            At hie Noone it behoueth to thinke in what doloure he was when he sayde My God mi God, wherfore hast thou left me. And when he saide, I thurste, thei gaue to him vineger and gall medled and how he abode the death, after sighes made, he gaue vp the ghost to God his father. And howe his mother had great sorow also,
            At Euensonge it behoueth to thinke howe Iesus had his side opened with a spere, and howe he henge deade on the Crosse ful of woundes fro the toppe

of his head to the soles of his feete, and he taken downe, and how his mother layde him on hir lappe weping.
            At complyne, thinke how Iesus was wounded and layde in sepulture, and kept of the Iewes to the ende that he should not ryse.
            Clarkes and lay people ought to thinke on these or they go to Matyns.

                  SOmetime were wont to be a nacion of people in the contre of Affryke & Spayne called Mororabiens, but now they bin but few. They be called Mororabiens, for that in may thinges thei held the vse in Christen men being in Araby, they vse the language of Latin in the deuine officies & sacred thinges, & obei to the church & to the Prelates of the Latines. They confesse them in the language Azymonien or in latin. They bin differēt to the latines, for that in their dyuyne offices they haue the houres to longe. And for the daye is deuyded in xxiiii. houres of night and day, so many offyres, houres, Psalmes, and all other Orizons haue thei along, the which they say not after the custome of the Latines, for that that the Latynes saye in the begynnynge, they say in the ende, or in the middes, Some deuydeth the holye sacramentes in vii. partes and other in .x. This is a ryght deuoute nation, they conioyne no persons by mariage, but if they be borne in theyr owne countrey and lande, the straungers be not receaued in mariage. And when a manne lesethe his wyfe by death, he will neuer be wedded ageyne, but lyue in chastitye. The cause of

so great diuersitie amonge Christen men, was for that in tyme past the Christen were let and not constrayned to celebrate councel general. For this cause there arose dyuers heretykes in many diuers parties. For there was none that myght remedy it.
