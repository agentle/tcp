Rainoldes, wherein all the reasons that can be made for them are notably refuted; th'objections aunswered, and the case so cleared and resolved, as that the iudgement of any man, that is not froward and perverse, may easelie be satisfied.
            Wherein is manifestly proved, that it is not onely vnlawfull to bee an Actor, but a beholder of those vanities.

               THe vanitie and vnlawfulnesse of Plaies and Enterludes hath bene often spoken against by the holy men of God. The danger and hurt that commeth by them hath bene plainly laied open by sundrie frutfull treatises of this our age. Farther it seemeth that the Lord himself by sundry his visible iudgementes from Heauen, hath pronounced a sensible vae against them even in the face of the world. Witnesse Paris Garden and other places where divers haue bene grievously hurt, wounded, and maimed; and some by lamentable death and destruction vtterly cutt of and consumed. These and such like warninges and examples going before should (a man would thinke) haue bene a fearefull precedent to the succeeding age that came after. But alas our practise sheweth it to be farre otherwise, Th'vsuall flocking and gadding that we see daily before our eies to these Play-Houses and ydle places of entercourse (many leaving their houses and sundry necessarie duties vnperfourmed, yea not sparing the very Sabath it selfe, nor fearing the prophanation thereof, so they may therein serue their vnruly appetites and affections) doth sufficiently descry a farre of of what mettall we are made, and wherin the treasure of our hart consisteth.
            Th'Israelites that were so backward and vnwilling to serue the Lord and to follow his ordinances, were yet willing enough Exod.

                (we see) to spare their earinges and most pretious Iuells to the furtherance of Idolatrie & worshipping of a Caulf. This is truly,

good Reader (I speake it with grief) the very case and disease of to many of vs at this day. There is nothing in a maner tedious and burdensome vnto vs but the furtherance of holy Religion, and the Christian practise of the same: on th'other side there is nothing commonly so deare and of price vnto vs, but the loue of our vanities and fleashly delightes can easely make it melt and consume. Mooue men to contribute any thing to the relief of Gods Saincts, or to the re-edifying of a decaied Church and place of praier, alas they haue in a readinesse without studie a whole budget full of letts and excuses, able to drown and extinguish a better mans devotion then theirs. Why, they giue forsooth, in their owne parishes; they haue a great charge at home, or els they are so indebted and behind hand, that they can not &c. And yet to the maintenance of their pleasures, or to nouzle themselues in their vanities (whether it be in apparell, gamening, gadding to plaies, masking, dauncing, bellicheare, shewes, or such like.) It is wonder to see how chearfully they can vntye their purse-stringes without respecte either of parish, home charge, debt or anything els. The young man in the Gospell went away sorrowfull and mourning, but when? When our Saviour bade him, Goe sel all 
               Mat. 15. 21. 
               that he had, and follow him. Wherin if we marke the words well, the holy Ghost seemeth to lay down vnto vs that the young mans grief did arise not only from this, in that hee was to depart with his substance and wealth, which hee loved so dearely, but also from this that he must depart withall to so base, so hard, and dangerous an end as he imagined, namely To follow Christ, wherein hee saw there was no earthly comfort and felicitie to bee hoped for. For if our Saviour had enjoined him to sell that he had for his better attendance on Caesars Court, or for his preferrement to any place of credite or commoditie, like enough it would not haue gone so nigh him, nor haue bene any such gall

or coresie to his heart, but, To sell all and follow Christ, this was the stinger that made him thus to hang down his head, to looke droopingly, and to fling away thus inwardly wounded and discontented. And hath not this yong man to many followers and successours in this age of ours? or, are there not Israelites enow among vs readie to giue any thing to the golden Caulf, and repining at euery thing that they should depart withall to the good of Gods Church? Doe we not see before our eyes, howe he that can hardly be drawen to spare a penie in the Church, can yet willingly and chearefullie afoord both pence and teaster, enow for himself and others at a play? Nay more, are there not some that neuer gaue groate in their liues to the furtherance of any good cause without grudging, and yet to feede and foste

D. Gager is likewise, I vnderstand, a man of giftes, a good Schollar, and an honest man, and (as it should seeme by Maister Rainoldes his seuerall aunsweres and replies) hath saied more for the defense of Plaies then can bee well saied againe by any man that shall succeede or come after him. So that the cause beeing thus wittely and scholler like maintained on th'one side, for, and in defense of plaies, and yet in the end all this rampier of defense quite ouerthrowne and laied flatte to th'earth by an vnresistable battery of profound and vnaunswerable argumentes and resolutions on th'other side, this must needes make the case more cleare and evident in th'eies of any man of iudgement, then if it had not bene gaine saied or withstoode at all. I haue bene informed also that Maister Gager himselfe vpon the last rejoinder of Maister Rainoldes hath let goe his hold, and in a Christian modestie and humilitie yeelded to the truth, and quite altered his iudgement. If it bee so (good Reader) and that so graue and learned a man hath chosen rather with that auncient father humile peccatum, then superbam ignorantiam, be not thou for thy part willfull and obstinate in thy conceite, whosoever thou art, but ponder the reasons and argumentes on th'one side, consider the dangers and inconveniences on th'otherside. And if thou haue bene bewitched with his vanitie heretofore, see whether th'advised perusall of this excellent treatise may happely by Gods mercy vnwitch thee againe. And take this with thee for a generall lesson and observation while thou livest, That whatsoever thy fleash, according to the common course of carnall men, delighteth in, suspect thou there is mischief in it, though thou be able to defende it by thy reason. Surely for mine owne part, I am perswaded if this present discourse bee read, marked, and disgested as it should bee, the gentlewoman that sware by her trouth, That shee was as

much edefied at a play as ever she was at any sermo, &c. will, ere she die, be of another minde, though it may be shee saied true then, in regard of her owne negligence and backwardnes in not giving eare to the word of God with reverence. The like may fall out also to those men too, that haue not bene afraied of late dayes to bring vpon the Stage the very sober countenances, graue attire, modest and matronelike gestures & speaches of men & women to be laughed at as a scorne and reproch to the world, as if the hypocrisie of Iudas (if it were brought vpon the stage) could any whitt disgrace the Apostles of our Saviour Christ, and yet if these men had but thus farre exceeded, kept themselues there, and gone no farther to the foule prophaning and abusing of the holy Scriptures of God, their sinne had not bene half so great as it is. Well to heale, if it may be, or at least, to correct the bad humour of such humorists as these (who in their discouery of humours doe withall fouly discover their own shame and wretchednes to the world) here is now laied before thee (good Reader) a most excellent remedie and receipt, if thou canst be so happie to make thy profitte of it. Reade it therefore and disgeast it, and, if thou find good thereof, giue God the glory, and blesse his Name, for so worthy an instrument.

            Maister D. Rainolds aunswere vnto Maister D. Gager, concerning Theater-sights, Stage-playes, &c.
            
               I AM much to thanke you, Maister D. Gager, for both your letters, and your Tragedie: the more, for that you haue enlarged the answer to Momus (as you signifie) because you vnderstood that I & others should aske why those thinges were not aunswered which were obiected. Indeed, as our Savior Iohn. 18. 2

                when he was smitten by one for speaking nought but reason, saide, If I haue spoken evill, beare witnesse of the evill; but if well, why doest thou smite me? so they, whose obiections against playes you attributed to the person of Momus, & thereby noted them as vniust reproovers, might iustlie say in my iudgement; If our reasons be naught, discover their naughtines; if good, why doe you Mome vs? And what so euer others had cause to thinke of them selues, yet I must needes thinke my self touched therein: although I should yeeld vnto your request (which I most gladlie doe) in that you pray me, not to mistake your meaning; protesting your intent is not to note any man, but onely Momus. For Praefat. Thesiū ad Acad, Oxon. I did reprove our Theater-sights & Stage-playes, as Pestes scenicorum theatralia spectacula. 
               hurtfull and pernicious, many yeares agoe: and this yeare, ere your Momus, or any of your Enterludes came vppon the stage, I had (in letters written to our good friend Maister D. Thornton) alleaged those reasons, which you make Momus vse, against them. Now Aesopes tale of Momus (as De partib. anim. lib. 3. cap. 2. 
               Aristotle sheweth in that your selfe mention of his reproving nature for setting bulles hornes vpon their heades, not vpon their shoulders) was devised to checke such as reproue vniustlie the best and perfitest works of the most wise and skilfull. To the which purpose sith you

rehearse it also, and inferre vpon it, that the man who taunteth playes with

               the rascall reproches there specified, offendeth in the same sorte: how can it bee avoided, but I, who had vttered those things against playes, though deeming them sounde reasons, not rascall reproches, must thinke my selfe charged vnder the name of Momus? vnlesse I should be so vnwise as to suppose, that my frende a lawier, saying, If Sempronius borow a horse of Seius, and ride him a mile farder, then Seius was content he should,

               he cōmitteth theft, the speech doeth not charge me with theft, though I had done so, because the lawier meant not to charge me, whom he loueth, nor knewe perhaps that I had done it; but his meaning was to charge Sempronius onelie. Wherefore albeit you meane not to hote any man but onelie Momus, as you protest, and I beleeue you: yet you meane withall (I trowe) the same that Prolege Man. 
               Tullie, when having reprooved the couetousnes of Chieftaines and Gouuernours of their warres, I (quoth hee) name no man; Wherefore no man can bee angie with me, vnlesse he will confesse first of him selfe. Which I doe not mention to proove that I haue cause of being angrie with you (be it farre from me,) although I confesse my selfe to haue written those things which they, who speake, are stained with Momus name by you: but onely to shewe that by your speach against Momus, notwithstanding your intent to note no man but him, yet you note vs all, in him, as vniust reproovers of playes, who soeuer inveigh against them as hee doeth. And this your selfe can not choose but see and graunt, if you call to minde your verses ad Zoilum, and Epistle ad Criticum. For you will professe (I hope) that your intent is not to note anie man but onely Zoilus and Criticus: Yet, if anie finde such fault with your Tragedie, as you controll them for: you will not denie but you meane to note him as a malitious Zoilus, and a carping Criticke. Your wordes inforce so much, in that you tell the Criticke, that who so carpeth at the basenes of your matter and style, doeth not blame you but Homer; And who so blameth Homer, he must needes be a Zoilus. I must pray you therfore, not to misdeeme of mee, that I mistake your meaning,

when I thinke you purposed to note generallie all reprovers of playes, as vniust reproovers: and so doe take my selfe, though not intended by the Censurer, who did not aime at mee; yet touched by the censure, whiche in event doeth light vppon mee.
            As for that you adde, that vpon confidence of your owne conscience, and the trueth of the thinges them selves, you assure your selfe, that I can not bee displeased: I will assure you also that I mislike nothing in your entitling Momus vnto our reasons of reproofe, or in your answere to them, if, as you approoue your cause of confidence on the one parte, so you shall on the other. For your protestation of your own conscience doeth binde me by the law of charitie to thinke that you haue done this in singlenesse of heart, without spite and malice. But the trueth of the thinges themselves, that you chalenge, belongeth to the reasons fathered on Momus, not to your aunswere, in my opinion. Whereof, least you suspect it to proceede rather from a conceited fansie, then a sound iudgement, I will open to you my groundes and inducements: requesting you the same that Epistolar.

               Roscius & Aesopus had played those parts, not Christ-church-students. Whom, and you for them, I shall finde the readier to grant this, I trust: because both my conscience doeth beare me witnesse before God, that I beare none of them evill will, nay, I wish vnto them all as to my selfe; and I assure you I know not who they were that played any of those partes, nor what their names be.
            
               
To the first reason then (for I will take them in your owne order) that Stage-players are infamous by the civill lawe, you aunswere that Famosus ergo est quisquis in scenā exiit? Praetor negabit. 
               they are not all, but onely such as play for gaine sake: which you avouch is proved by the Praetors wordes. But that which you make the Praetor say, as distinguishing, Qui sui spectaculum Mercedis ergô praebet, infamis siet; the Praetor saith not. Nay, contrariwise Praetoris verba dicunt. D. de his qui no tantur infamia. L. 1. he saith without all distinction, generallie and simplie: Infamia notatur, qui artis ludicrae, pronuntiandive causa, in scenam prodierit. And Ulpian (whose L. 2 §. Ait Praetor. place you quote for proofe thereof) doeth report him so, with these verie words: Ait Praetor, Qui in scenam prodierit, "infamis est". But Vlpian, expounding these wordes of the Praetor, citeth some Pegasus & Nerva filius. lawiers saying, that they are infamous, qui quaestus causa in certamina descendunt, & propter praemium in scenam prodeunt: and hereof you conclude, that Non ergo quenquā scena, sed quaestus notat. 
               they, who come not foorth into the stage for gaine sake, are not infamous. By which kinde of reasoning one might conclude likewise, that sith by Deut. 23. 18 the scripture a woman taking mony for prostituting her body to men is infamous: therefore she is not so, who doeth it freelie; much lesse, who giveth mony to haue her lovers companie; whom yet Ezek. 16. 33. the scripture counteth most infamous of all. Howbeit, had those lawiers, in adding, quaestus causa, intended your conclusion; which I knowe not whether they did, but admitte it: neverthelesse you know that a Dionysius Gothofredus comment. in corp. iur. civ.

Austin and Livie doe shewe that all stage-players (free players not excepted) were branded with a marke of infamie & dishonestie, disfranchised in a sort: so he confirmeth hereby (which was and ought to bee the drift of his note) that by law the players without gaine are infamous, not onelie such as playe for gaine sake. And this doe their wordes, whom hee alleageth, implie, if they bee vnfolded and

For seeing that he findeth fault with the people, who sate & beheld the fowle misorders & scurrilities (such as your Antinous & other wooers practise) of persons nobly borne; who heard the race of Fabius resembling & couterfaiting such base ridiculous things as are expressed in Irus; who could abide to laugh at blowes & whirrets, giuen to the Mamercians, as you would say vnto Ulysses. he sheweth that the verie action it selfe, all regard of lucre, or what soeuer motiue had brought them to it, sett apart, was dishonorable & shamefull in his iudgement. But his like or sharper inveighing against Nero, touching whom he addeth, Res haud mira tamen citharaedo Principe mimus Nobilis. that it was no marvell if noble men were stageplayers whē the Prince was a minstrell, doeth put the matter out of doubt: in as much as he, comparing Nero to Par Agamemnonidae crimen.

This, obscurelie signified by Iuvenal himselfe, mentioning the

In the last of which tragedies it is reported that a yong souldier (one of Neros gard) being sett to keepe the entrie, when hee sawe Nero attired and bound with Chaines, as the argument required, hee ranne to him to helpe him; thinking (poore freshwater creature) that his maister had bene chained in earnest. Another, better acquainted then hee with stage matters, and having served longer, Dio Ner. in Xiphili. epist. when Nero played the firste of them, namely Canace, the souldier beeing asked by some who mett him in the citie what the Emperour was doing, Hee is travailing with childe, quoth hee. The singing then vsed vpon the stage by Nero, for which Iuvenal counteth him worse then Orestes, was his playing of mens and wemens partes in tragedies. But Nero never played for gaine: nay, he was so farre from it, that, when a Praetor, who did sett foorth playes, offered him Sesteriûm decies. Suet. Ner. cap. 2

Iuvenal therefore counteth all stage-players infamous, not onelie such as played for gaine. And what should I adioyne the testimonies of others, learned, vnlearned; both sortes declaring what Roman citizens thought hereof? For beside Suetonius, Tacitus, Dio, &c who hath written of Nero that hath not attainted him with this reproche? the common people, euen souldiers, reckened his stage-playing among his vitious acts: as, Tacit. Annal. lib. 15. in a conspiracie that was made against him, hee heard to his great grief; when Subrius Flavius, a Tribune, beeing demanded by him why he had sought his death, aunswered, Oderam te, nec quisquam tibi fidelior militum fuit, dum amari meruisti; odisse caepi, postquam parricida matris, & vxoris, auriga, histrio, & incendiarius extitisti: and Sulpitius Asper, aunswering more brieflie to the same demande, saide, Non aliter tot flavigitiis ejus subveniri posse. Neither was it the basenes thereof in comparison of his

imperiall Maiestie, that they detested onelie, as his chariot-driving vpbraided him withall might giue cause to thinke, were it not a whelpe too of Circenses ludi. Sueton. Ner. cap. 22. the same litter: but the dishonestie and lewdnesse, which, accompanying commonly that trade, by many occasions incident into stage-playes, made such men infamous; and therevpon was noted, though as a more eminent fault in him then others, yet as a fault in others also. Pecuniam ob delicta dedit, saith Annal. li. 14

And Dio, a Senatour of Rome, well acquainted with their lawes and orders by Lib. 43. & 49. sundry great offices of state borne among them, Xiphil. epi. amplifying that iniurie done to more also, and to meaner persons then Tacitus speaketh of, nether all rewarded like them peradventure, sure Dio giving no inkling of that as the shame of it, saith,

               sacrifice did not please God in comparison of mercy. Matt. 12. 7. Therefore to doe that worke of mercie and charitie for the reliefe of hungrie bodies vpon the Sabbath day, was not euill. Contrariwise, when Peter

By conference and laying of which thinges together we are taught this difference betwene the morall law, and the ceremoniall, that the ceremoniall was not enioyned to be kept absolutelie and simply; and therefore 1 Sam. 21. 4 Matt. 12. 3. when it could not bee kept without the breach af the morall lawe, the law of loue and charitie it yeelded therevnto: but the morall lawe is simply and absolutely enioyned to be kept, as a paterne of that

holinesse which God requireth in Rom. 8. 14. Ephe 4. 24. his children, Lev. 19. 2. 1 Pet. 2. 15. 
               Be yee holy, for I am holy; and therefore, Rom 3. 7. and 6. 2. who so breaketh any part thereof, though to keepe an other parte, doeth defile himselfe, and displease the Highest. Now, the prohibitiō of men to be attired as wemen, wemen as men, belongeth to the morall, not to the ceremoniall law. For Gal. 4. 9. Col. 2. 16. Heb. 8. 13. & 9. 11. & 10. 1.

Nay (which addeth greater weight vnto the reason) it is a notorious and detestable euill: as Deut. 22. 5. the Spirite sheweth by the words ensuing, For all that doe so are abomination to the Lord thy God.

But whether this were part of the cause that moved the Spirit of God, or no: it is cleere and certaine that hee pronounceth them abominable in his sight, or (as the Hebrues speake more forciblie) abomination, whosoeuer put on the different sexes raiment. And so, it being simplie and absolutelie vnlawfull, because it is forbidden by the morall law, and proved to be evill, a fowle abominable evill in Gods sight: the Christian faith instructeth vs that wee may not doe it for any good to come thereof, no not for the saving of honor, wealth, or life, of others, or our selues. The argumēts, wherby you striue to proue the contrarie, are drawen from two exāples: One of the Macedonians, whose king Amyntas entertaining Persian ambassadors, & having at their request broght noble wemen to the banket, when the embassadours dalying with them did touch their brests, & offred some to kisse them; Veste filius Amyntae indui Iuvenes muli

For hence you conclude that a man may lawfully putt on womans raiment to benefit others, to saue his life; because the Macedonians, by their young Princes motion, and Achilles did so. Which argument if it holde, then may a man lye to saue his life, or benefit others, because 1 Sam. 21. 2 
               David did so: then may a man forsweare to saue his life, or benefite others, because Mat. 26 72.

               Samson did, in avenging him selfe of the Philistines, might haue the same testimonie of faith which Heb. 11. 32 
               Samson had. But if one should spende it to shewe men Theater-pastime, as Sueton. in Ner. cap. 12. that fellowe did who played Icarus before Nero, and falling down neere to his chamber, sprinkled him with blood; wel might he earne the praise of Icarus. Wherefore albeit a man for the performance of necessarie dueties might putt on womens raiment: yet would it not folow thereof, that he may doe it to play a part in Enterludes; Much lesse will that conclusion followe, which in steede hereof you sett downe generallie, thereby to fetch about this hidden cōclusion. For you doe inferre, as proved by those examples with the contrarie of Clodius, that Nō ergo vestis foeminca iuveni est scelus; Sed prava mens, libido, malitia ac dolus: nec habitus ullus, sed animus turpem facit. 
               it is no fault for young men to weare womens raiment, but to doe it (as
               
Clodius) with a lewde intent of committing whoredome, beguiling, and deceyving: neither doeth anie apparell, but the minde, make a man dishonest. And so assuming hereto, that Quid simil

               none of your young men, who were attired like women, had anie such intent or meaning; you implie by consequence that it was no fault for them to be attired so; and therefore men may lawfully put wemens rayment on to play. But what a foundation this frame is built vpon, the consequence in religion and reason both will shew. The Scripture saith that 1 Cor. 11. ver. 5. & 10. 
               wemen, praying, or prophecying, ought to haue a veile or couer on their heads in token of subiection: but 
               verse 4. & 7. 
               men ought not to haue so. Nowe, what if a man should preach or pray in the Church with such a veile as women beare in this respect; with a calle (for examples sake) or with a French hoode: should he offende, or no? Your inference sayeth, Nay, vnlesse he weare it with a lewde intent, as Clodius did. For no apparell, but the minde, doeth make a man dishonest: and therefore Non ergo velum foeminae viro est scelus; Sed prava mens, libido, malitia, ac dolus: Nec habitus ullus sed animus turpem facit. it is no fault for a man to pray with a French hoode on his head. But Saint Paul sayth otherwise: and, though he would graunt the wearing of it with Clodius minde to be a greater fault; yet a fault would he iudge it to weare it with Penelopes, because the verie wearing of it, is forbidden. The L. 23. D. de auro, argento, mundo. 
               Ciuill lawe, speaking of Mens and Womens garmentes, some peculiar to either, some common to them both, defineth those to bee common, which both may weare without reproofe; peculiar, which both may not. Women shall haue no garmentes peculiar nowe to them, if your speach be true. For men may weare their peticoates, kirtles, and whatsoeuer else without reproofe: beeause it is not any apparell, but the mind, that makes a man blame-worthie. The Esai. 3

               that which goeth into the mouth, defileth not the man; yet, if men drinke too much Ephe. 5.

And so, if anie man doe put on Womans raiment, hee is dishonested and defiled, because he transgresseth the boundes of modestie and comelinesse, and weareth that which Gods lawe forbiddeth him to weare, which mans lawe affirmeth hee can not weare without reproofe: though otherwise a Womans raiment of it selfe doeth neither discommende or commende the wearer; no more then 1. Cor. 8. 8 meate maketh vs acceptable to God; 
               Rom. 14. 17 
               For the kingdome of God is not meate, nor drinke (I may adde, nor apparell) but righteousnes and peace and ioy in the holy Ghost. Wherefore you had done better service to the trueth, if, in steede of your egre knitting vp of this point with this epiphonema,

               Cursed is the glosse that corrupteth the good text, you had obserued rather as De idolotat. cap 16.

               Cursed by God, but onely womans worne by man; and had applied it also against mens wearing of it in stage-playes, as De spectac. cap. 23. hee doeth. At least I could haue wished your censure had bene milder, if not in regard of a younger Preacher, who did so expound that text in a godly Sermon before your booke was printed: yet in consideration of that ancient Father, with Cypri.

            3 Yet the third reason, wherein playes are charged, not for making young men come foorth in hoores attire, like Prou. 7. 10. the Iewde woman in the Proverbs; but for teaching them to counterfeit her verse 11. actions, her verse 12. wanton kisse, her impudent face, her verse 18. wicked speeches and entisements; should haue bene allowed even by your owne glosse and exposition of the text: sith Distincta sexum forma distinctum de cet, Virile n

These are wemens maners vnseemelie for Achilles to imitate: he should not haue done it. How much lesse seemely then is it for young men to danse like wemen, though like exod 15. 20. those, who praised God with danses: and much lesse seemelie yet to danse like vnhonest wemen, like Mar. 6. 22.

And greater reason is it you should condemne all stage-playes, wherein

to play at stoole ball among wenches; nor at Mum-chance or Maw with idle loose companions, nor at trunkes in Guile-hals, nor to danse about Maypoles, nor to rifle in alehouses, nor to carowse in tavernes, nor to steale deere, nor to robbe orchardes.

Wherefore the needfulnes of a time for sportes, for playes, for recreation, as well as for studie, doeth not prooue the lawfulnes of your Theatricall sports, and playes; of the daunses mentioned; of young mens womanlie raiment; of Melanthos kissing; of Phaedras furious rage; her Nurses and the Nymphes bawdrie; of wantonnes and scurrilitie shewed in sundrie speeches, actions and gestures; of the loose and beastlie behauiour of the mariners, with the rest of like qualitie. Nay, your owne argument that man consisteth not of one part alone, he hath a minde as well as a body, confuteth all such sportes; because, as recreation is needfull in regard of the body, so vertuous recreation in regard of the minde: and vertue more necessarie much then recreation, by howe much the minde is of more excellencie then the body; or rather by how much more profitable it is for minde and body both, sith hee who wanteth 2. Pet. 1. 5. vertue, verse 9. is blinde, and, 1. Tim. 4. 8.

            Now, these things standing thus, what need I spend wordes in prooving of the fourth reason, namelie, that the charge of setting foorth such playes is mony cast away, and addeth wastfulnes to wantonnes, when your owne aunswere doeth strengthen it sufficientlie? For in that you say, Est, ubi parcas, locus: suus est honesto sumptui. 
               there is a time of sparing, a time of honest spending, you graunt that vnhonest expense is still vnlawfull: as you haue cause to doe, seeing it is of Luk. 15. 13. riott condemned by our Sauiour in the prodigall sonne. Wherefore, vnlesse that vnthrift might haue aunswered Christ or anie other reproouer, Thou blamest me for wasting, but I wast none of thine; thou maist drinke with mee scotfree, if thou be a good fellowe, and welcome: I see not how At sumptus ingens: at tibi gratis licet spectare, Mome, nemo te stipem rogat. your aunswere to Momus can be iustified, Thou sayest the charge is great; but thou mayest come, and looke on, Momus, and paye nothing, no man doeth aske thee a penie.

               YOVR request, Maister D. Gager, that I should forbeare farther reply in writing, and by word of mouth in priuate cōference informe you, if you haue greatlie erred in any part of your answer; brought into my minde Diog. Laer▪ in Diogene. the Philosophers censuring and checking of such as offered sacrifice for health, and at their very sacrifizing did banket riotouslie against health. For that which I wrote concerning things, the stage-playes, you draw vnto the persons, who played on the stage at Christchurch, as if I went about to make thē and your house most vilanouslie infamous: and partlie by concealing, partly by perverting the drift & substance of my speeches, you seeke to smoother vp and suppresse the trueth. Which being done in writing by you with care and diligence, not to be imparted vnto me alone, but to others also, as your selfe doe signifie: if I should note the fault thereof by worde of mouth, my plaister would be lesse a great deale then the wound, and therefore neuer reach to heale it: for woordes haue wings, and flie away, mens writings doe remaine. But as farre as possiblie I may without neglect of the duetie I owe to GOD and to his Church, I yeelde to your request: that is, I will endeuour to make plaine vnto you the iniuries and wrongs that your aunswer doth me, as brieflie as the necessarie clearing of the truth, and scattering of the mistes whereby you goe about to darken it, will permit.
            The point that is in question betweene vs touching stageplayes,

was generallie mooued: to weet, whether such as play them doe offende, or such as reprooue the playing of them. You vndertooke to shewe that the reproouers are faultie: I, that the Players. And least the dissension of opinions heerein should breed exulceration of mindes betwene vs, if that, which either of vs said touching the matter, should be taken odiously as meant against the persons whom it might concerne: you, with protestation of your good will to mee-ward, desired mee not to thinke that you meant to note me by the name of Momus; I prayed you the like with like protestation in respect of your players; & that with greater reason why you should haue yeelded to it in my opinion, sith neither one of their names, Phemius for example sake, doeth signifie a lewd player, as Momus doeth an vniust reproouer; neither did I know who played that part and others, as you knew my mislike of playes. Now, I condescended to your desire most gladlie: your selfe acknowledge it, and hartilie thanke me for it. I would to God I might haue likewise thanked you: whereof you haue giuen me so litle cause, so great cause to the contrarie, that I must needes cō
               plaine you haue forgotten the lesson which a Alexander Seuerus, apud Lampridium. heathen Emperour had learned of Iewes or Christians, and marueilouslie loued it, Quod tibi fieri non vis, alteri ne feceris. For whereas you had said that stage-players were not counted infamous by the civill lawe, but onely such as played for game; and I, to refute this, declared that the Romans, whose iudgement and custome doeth best interpret their owne law, counted Nero infamous for playing, though freelie; which, least you perhaps through ambiguitie of a The worde cantavit, used by Iuvenal. sat. 8. worde, should except against, that it was not stage-playing of Mens and Womens partes, I opened it by the examples of your Hippodamia, Eurymachus, and Phemius: you replie hereon, that this is my arguing; Many noble men, and Nero him selfe were infamous for playing, though freelie, mens and womens partes, and specially Nero for singing like a fidler on the stage; Ergo, scholers and the students of Christ-church are to be noted with a marke of infamie, for playing, though gratis, such partes as they did in Ulysse reduce; and namely the Master of our Choristers for playing Phemius; notwithstanding for his

honestie, modestie, and good voice, he is as worthie to be deliuered from infamie, as Phemius him selfe is fained to bee saved from death, for his excellent skill in Musicke, to say nothing of the rest. And not content to wrest mine argument from my drift, and racke it to my sentence from the Ciuill lawe, to Christ-church players from the Roman, you shutt vp your tale with this morall: I dare not denie this argument, because it is yours; I referre it to the charitable iudgement of my betters.

                  s, Euen so am I contented, good Syr, that our betters doe iudge of mine argument, and your charitable vsage of it. To the which intent I beseech you hartilie, that, with the next play you publish, you will set foorth my letters, and your answere to them. In the meane season, I thinke, that when omitting the force of mine argument against your distinction of playing for gaine, & freelie, you drew in the mention of the Maister of your Choristers, his honestie, his modestie, his good voice, his Musicke, and of the rest of the Scholers & students of Christ-church: your purpose was to shewe a peece of that art, that Servius Galba did. Who, being endited of a Valer. Max. lib. 9. cap. 6. Sueto. in Gal. cap. 3. Oros. lib 4. cap. 21 great offence, whereof he could not cleere him selfe, and therefore Cic in Bruto Livi. lib. 49. epitome Valer.

For if the good qualities of the Maister of your Choristers, or of your Scholers and Students, doe prooue that the Romans coū
               ted it no infamie for such to be stage-players, howe soeuer they counted it for Nero: then Orat. pro P. Quintio. 
               Tullie spake absurdly, when he said that Roscius both for his skill in playing seemed alone worthie to come vpon the stage, and for his

               vertue and honestie, seemed alone worthie not to come vpon it. And how can the charitable iudgement of your betters; nay, howe can your owne, charge me as offending for setting downe that of the Romans, which by consequent toucheth the Maister of your Choristers credit, and others of Christchurch: where your self acknowledge, that

your invectiue against Momus, doeth consequently fal on me, on the Preacher, on whosoever else reproove playes, and yet you may haue written it without offence, you trust?
            But in this matter your fault is the lesse, because you had some colour thereof by mine exemplifying in three of your players: nor did the Romans alwayes count them so infamous but that the best of them were sometime well esteemed of, as Macrob. Saturn. lib. 3. cap. 14. 
               Tullies great acquaintance with Roscius and Aesopus argueth. In the next you doe me so much the greater iniurie, by how much both the turpitude and vilanie is greater wherwith you beare your Students in hande that I charge them: and I was farder off from giuing cause to be so dealt with, hauing refrained purposelie from naming any of yours in opening of the point. For being to proove that the prohibition of men to put on womens raiment (in Deuteronomie) belongeth to the morall law, and therevpon declaring how it is referred by learned Divines, to the commaundement, Thou shalt not commit adulterie: I said that they had reason to referre it so, because, among the kindes of adulterous lewdenes, mens naturall corruption and vitiousnes is prone to monstrous sinne against nature, as the Scripture witnesseth in Cananites, Iewes, Corinthians, other in other nations, one with speciall caution Nimium est quod intelligitur; and the putting of womens attire vpon men, may kindle great sparkles of lust thervnto in vncleane affections, as Nero shewed in Sporus, Heliogabalus in him self; yea certaine, who grew not to such excesse of impudencie, yet arguing the same in causing their boyes to weare long heare like women. This, in your examining the sense of Moses wordes, wherevnto I vsed it, you passe ouer wholly; without mention of the iudgement of the learned Diuines, or of my reason giuen for it. But in the point following, where I handled other inconueniences and discommodities of playes, with speciall applyinge thereof vnto yours: We pray you Syr (say you) to make a great difference betweene vs and Nero with his Sporus, or Heliogabalus with him selfe, or the Cananites, Iewes, Corinthians, or them that cause their Pages to weare long heare like women, or any such dogges: we hartilie abhorre them. You say out of Quintilian,
               
Nimium est quod intelligitur: and I may say, Nimium est quod dicitur. Wee thanke God, our youth doe not practise such things, they thinke not of thē, they know them not: neither cā any mā liuing the rather for our playes charge any one of vs with the least suspicion of any such abomination. I haue bene often mooved by our playes to laughter, and sometime to teares: but I can not accuse either my selfe, or any other, of any such beastlie thought stirred vp by them. And therefore we should most vncharitablie be wronged, if our putting on of Womanly rayment, should either directlie or indirectlie be referred to the commandement, Thou shalt not commit adulterie. All these are your owne wordes. In which that you may see, what your dealing is, beholde a paterne of it. There was a certaine Preacher, who catechizing his hearers in the principles of faith, and deliuering to them Mat. 5.

Now, among the companie to which the Preacher spake, one, not evill minded, yet loving good felowship, and a more remisse, or welnigh loose kinde of living, fearing least by the credit & force of this doctrine, certaine of his friendes whom he had made acquainted with beautifull wiues, or handsome maides, should growe into suspition of wantonnes and lightnes, rose vp and said vnto the Preacher; We pray you, Syr, to make a great difference betweene vs, and them whom Cyrus speaketh of, or Propertius him selfe; or Putiphras Wife, Iob, Dauid, or such as let their eyes bee

porters vnto loue, and dote by seeing faire persoons: wee hartilie mislike them. You say out of Uirgill, Urit

                   loquendo Masculus. We thanke God, our youth doe not practise such thinges, they thinke not of them, they know them not: neither can anie man liuing, the rather for our looking on handsome maides, or beautifull Wiues, charge any one of vs with the least suspicion of any such vncleannes. I haue bene delited often with their sight, and sometime mooved to pitie: but I can not accuse either my selfe, or any other of any such wicked thought stirred vp thereby. And therefore we should most vncharitably be wronged, if the casting of our eyes on wives, or on maides, should either directlie or indirectlie be referred to the cō
                  maundement, Thou shalt not commit adulterie. What thinke you of this man, Maister D. Gager? Did hee not the Preacher wrong? Certainlie, if you haue the spirit wherwith 2. Sam. 12. 5 
               David answered Nathans parable, you will confesse, he did. And what ensueth, you see: I neede not adde, You are the man. But this I must adde, that the wrong you doe me is so much more palpable, then was this carpers of the Preacher, because I saide, that the putting of Womens attire vpon men, may kindle sparkes of lust in vncleane affections: I saide not, in all mens affections, but in some; not in sanctified, but in vncleane. What? And doe you graunt, that you, and your youth, haue vncleane affections, to the intent you may blame my speech? If not, why tell you me, that the putting of womanlie raiment vpon men, hath not stirred any such beastlie thought in any of you; whē I spake expreslie of vncleane affections? Besides, can you accuse your selfe, or anie other, of anie wanton thought stirred vp in you by looking on a beautifull Woman? If you can; then ought you beware of beautifull boyes transformed into womē by putting on their raiment, their feature, lookes and facions. For men may be ravished with loue of stones, of dead stuffe, framed by cunning grauers to beautifull womens likenes; as, in Ovid. Metamorp. lib. 10 Poets fables appeareth by Pygmalion, by Plin. hist. na. lib.

cōcluding, that therefore you should most vncharitably be wronged, if your putting on of Womanly raiment, should either directlie or indirectlie be referred to the commaundement, Thou shalt not cōmit adulterie. For my speech was generall, that the cladding of youthes in such attire is an occasion of drawing & provoking corruptlie minded men to most heinous wickednes, & therefore should be wiselie cutt off by the faithfull: as if, in a Sermon to the vniversitie, expounding that of Iob, 
               Iob. 31. 1. 
               I made a covenant with mine eyes, I should tell the Students, that though he name a maide, wee must extende the lesson farder; by Sophoc. Cic. de offi. lib. 1. Valer.

Max. other wordes to like effect, admonished of making a covenant with his eyes, for saying; O puerum pulchrum Pericle. Wherevppon if anie should tell his acquaintance of this, or that College, Tutour, or other, accustomed to cast his eyes on such children as God had adorned with comelines of body, that I went about to make them suspected of most horrible lewdenes, he should doe both them and me notorious iniurie. Albeit, as our Sauiour, saying to his Disciples, Mar. 4. 24. 
               Take heede what you heare, did purpose to stirre them vp to marke diligentlie that which he delivered, & faithfullie to performe it; yet cōdemned them not as retchlesse or vnfruitfull hearers of his worde: so I would acknowledge that in saying likewise, Take heede what you see, my meaning were to stirre vp both Tutours, and all other, to carie them selues chastlie, euen in their lookes also, least death come in by their windowes, though I meane no more to make them suspected by this admonition, then I doe my selfe. Which if you, who touch me so bitterlie, and often, for doeing you or yours vncharitable wrong, had charitably marked: I should haue lesse cause of wishing you to play the

            This I say not onelie of my generall speeches sett vpon the racke to make me odious to your Studentes: but of the particular too, that may be thought to concerne them specially. As namelie that I mentioned Eurymachus kissing of Melantho: a thing which I gathered to haue bin done by her own words: 5 Furtiva nullus oscula Eurymachus dabit. Act. 5. sith they were both intēded to be alone secretlie, when he had

Act. 5. whereof she speakes withal, was represented on the stage. But I named them onelie for example sake; my drift being generall against such playes as expresse such actions: whether sett foorth presentlie by you; as your Rivales, in which some of the wooers perhaps kissed Phoedra; or heretofore, as Plauti curculio. that of Plautus, in which Act. 1. 
               Phaedromus kissed Planesium without perhaps. Wherefore sith you defende your former playes as well as these, and in that respect commende by name Plautus, as you haue great reason, comparing any Comedie of his with your Rivales: what aymed you at in saying, that, for the daunger of kissing beautiful boyes you know not howe the suspicion should reach vnto you, because it is vntrue that Eurymachus kissed Melantho; vnlesse your meaning were to practise that malice (so Aristot. li. 1. rhet. cap. 1.

Else, when you enquired of the parties them selves, whether any such action were used by them, and they (you say) denyed it constantly: why did you not enquire also of Plautus, whether it were vsed by Phaedromus, & Planesiū, and of the ancients of your house, whether Phoedromus and Planesium came euer on your stage? Sure you should haue takē this course by the equitie of that which semeth reasonable to you in your own cause. For, spying by mine answer, that your example of Achilles wearing womans raiment, did not serue your turne: you replie, that we may imagine such a one as will serue it, with change of a circumstance. And this in your defense must goe for sufficient. But the case is altered, when it toucheth me: yea, although my purpose may be prooved by true, not by imagined, examples. So indulgent commonly are men vnto them selues: so rigorous vnto others.
            Howbeit, I should not complaine of this rigour, but for the taile of it, and the sting of breeding euill will among brethren, which doeth lurke therein. The venome and poyson whereof goeth about to spred it selfe abroad through more partes of your body, then Phemius, Eurymachus, & the players of women; by meanes that you likewise instill the same humour, at

least seeke to instill it as much as in you lieth, into the rest of all your players, their teachers and instructors, and in conclusion your whole house. For whereas the third branch of our reasons, set downe by you in Momus his name against playes, had avouched not onelie their time to be misspent who were employed therein, but some of their persons, their mindes, corrupted also; and I, to shewe how cunninglie you, encountring this proposed the losse of time alone and not of men, did declare that Cyprian writing of a stage-player, who made boyes effeminate by instructing them howe to play the women, and to expresse and counterfeit vnhonest wanton gestures, saith, he was a maister not of teaching but spilling children; and thereof did inferre, that the losse of time should not haue bene obiected so much against your playes, seeing some of the players (if they were like the youthes whom Cyprian speaketh of) might replie as Phaedria, when Parmeno did tell him that his gift bestowed on Thais would be lost, Ego quoque unà pereo, quod mihi est carius; ne istuc tam iniquo patiare animo: beholde, with how charitable applying of my wordes you come in thus vpon me, The saying of Saint Cyprian against a stage-player, or of Phaedria of him selfe to Parmeno, can not be iustlie used against vs. For he should doe vs great contumelie, that should thinke, or say, that either we are maisters not of teaching, but spilling children; or that both time and our young men were cast away altogether by those exercises. And to make a deeper impression in your young men that I doe them this contumelie, with an other also brought for proofe hereof: you goe forward thus: But it is no marveile that you imply so ill a coceite of them, if you doubt that, as I answered Momus, our actors can shew greater fruit of their time well spent, then any that is bredde vp by Mo
                  
                     •…
                  usses discipline can. For you pray God that they may: as doubting it is not so. Wherein, first and formost, if your conscience tell you, that your selfe (for whom else you associate to you by we are maisters, I know not) are touched in Saint Cyprians reproofe of the stage-player: I can no way helpe it, saue with that of Scripture, 1 Ioh. 3. 2
                     •…
                  
                
               If your heart condemne you, God is greater then your heart, and knoweth all thinges. But whether I might not

alleadge Saint Cyprians wordes, to shewe that somewhat more then time is cast away and spilt by such stage-playes as make boyes effeminate: let our betters iudge. Who, I trust, will not condemne the poore swalowes for chattering and vsing their voice, agreeably to nature, because Plutarch. de lenta numinis vindicta. 
               Bessus surmised they cried against him that he had killed his father. Next, in that you charge me with insinuating of your young men, that both time and them selues are cast away altogether by those exercises, and adde, it is no marveile that I imply so ill a conceyte of them: truelie, it is marveile, that you, professing so much good will to mee as you doe, should in so fewe wordes vse so manie trickes of calumniation to breed a misliking of me in your yong men. One, by making me to speake of them at large, and indefinitlie: whereas I noted onelie such as played the Women, and of them such onelie, as were taught to counterfeit vnhonest wanton gestures, that is, as played vnchast women. An other, by adioyning the particle Cast away altogether. 
               Altogether, as if I had iudged them dead, dead, past all recouerie: whereas the Spilling, in

               exercises: as who say that peremptorie sentence had bene giuen of all, euen them who played mens partes, yea the best mens; where I censured onelie the filth of playing wanton queanes so with Cyprian. A fourth, by rehearsing it as absolutelie pronounced: where I with a If they were like ye youths whom Cyprian speaketh of. cōdition restraining the sentence, did manifestlie shewe that I affirmed it not, except they tooke like harme with those whom Cyprian speaketh of; and therefore drew my speach from your speciall players, to the generall question. A fifth, by making proofe thereof, as good and sound, as the thing proved; in saying, It is no marveile that I imply so ill a conceit of them, if I doubt that your actors can shew greater fruit of their time well spent then anie that is bredde vp by Momusses discipline can: and yeelding this reason to perswade the young men that I doubt it is not so,

because I pray God that they may. Which reason if it holde: then our Oxford Preachers haue a badd opinion of the Uicechancelour, the Doctours, the Proctors, the Heades of houses: for they are wont to pray that we may be good; and therefore by your inference they doubt we are not so. And will not your Christ. church Preachers be discredited hereby with your Studentes, as much as I am: seeing they pray commōlie as well for the Studentes, as for the Deane and Prebendaries? Questionlesse your selfe would thinke, hee did you iniurie who should say you beleeue not an article of your faith, the forgiuenesse of sinnes. Yet you are accustomed to pray, Luke 11. 4.

               gentle construying of things doubtfull. But suppose that I had even denied also, not onely doubted, that your actors can shewe greater fruit of their time well spent then anie that is bredde vp by Momusses discipline can: is it therfore likelie that I imply so ill a conceit of them as that they are altogether cast away? Yea, you say. And why? Because they could doe little, if they could not doe so much, and a great deale more, and better, when soever they shall be tryed. For what is the discipline of Momus, but the schoole of carping, nipping, depraving, and reprehending of everie good thing? Wherevpon you adde, to amplifie the straunge iniquitie of my dealing, that of all other things you thought I would not, or could not haue taken anie exception to that speech of yours. In deed if I had taken the discipline of Momus in that sense you give it; your so ill collection of my so ill conceit should haue some probabilitie. But I

had declared that by the name of Momus you noted all reproovers of playes. And howsoever that be, wherof more hereafter: dowtlesse I meant scholers trained vp by such in godlinesse and good learning, when I prayed that your actors might shew greater fruit of their time well spent, then any that is bredde vp by Momusses discipline can. Which is plaine and evident by the words following, in that I affirmed, that this which you terme the discipline of Momus, is not his but Cyprians, or rather the holy Ghosts. For God forbid that you should proceede from evill to worse in such excesse of sclandering, as to tell your actors, that I say, the discipline of the holy Ghost is the schoole of carping, nipping, depraving, & reprehending of every good thing. Now, though my cōceit of them be so good, that I am perswaded, or rather knowe in part, they can shew great fruit of their time well spent, and haue in triall done it: yet I know withall some of so great towardnes brought vp by the other, that, if all your actors think they can shew greater fruit thē any of these, they will make mee thinke their good conceit of themselves is worse thē mine ill. And see of how different opinions you and I are about this matter. I know sundry scholers of rare expectatiō and hope in other Colleges, for whom my prayer is they may shew as great fruit of their time well spent as some of these can: and yet in my iudgement I haue no ill conceit of them. You, vnlesse I thinke that your Christ-church actors can shew much greater fruit, doe iudge, and giue sentence, that my conceit of them is ill: so ill, beyond all huy and cry, that it is a token I imply in couert speech (expounded charitably) that they are cast away, yea, cast away altogether, and irrecoverably lost.
            Lesser is the wrong, yet a wrong also, that of your actors likewise you say, they are condemned by me to hatefull infamie, a thing to all honest mindes more intollerable then death it selfe: and farther, that your house, your selfe, and many honest towardly young men, your frendes, whom for good causes you hartely loue, are charged with open infamie. It may be, the circumstance noted herewithall, in that you adde it greeveth you and them not a litle, that they should in private, but much more in publike, bee charged with such infamie: hath reference to the Sermon rather

which was preached in the publike audience of the vniversitie, then to letters written in private vnto you. Howbeit, whethersoeuer of vs it toucheth more, your complaint is somewhat partiall to your selfe: who take in euill parte, that wee by word or writing should teach or mainteine ought wherof there may grow infamie by consequent to you; yet would haue vs take it well and patientlie, that you haue set foorth and published that in print, whereof there may grow infamie by consequent to vs. But the wrong I meant you doe mee in those clauses of your accusation, concerneth both the matter of crime, and the persons: the matter, for aggravating the qualitie of the note of infamie, whiche they are charged with, by terming it hatefull, open, more intollerable to all honest mindes then death it selfe: the persons, for extending it from a few members to the whole bodie, from the players to your house. Concerning the later (to begin with it) beside that you say that in aunswering my writing you defende your house, not onelie the particular players, from infamie: you adde that they are charged therewith to the generall reproch of your house, if so hard a censure should be by men of note enforced and perswaded. And why should you more interpret our action to the generall reproche of your house, because wee reproved that by worde or writing which some of Christchurch had practised: then wee interpret yours to the generall reproche of our house, because you defended that by printed treatise, which some of Queenes college had reprooved? If the reason bee, for that wee are men of note who worke the discrediting of you: they are men of note too, whose verses you hauing prefixed before your book, doe countenance your disgrace of vs. Nether doe I see what reason else you bring, or can, but that wee shall meete you in the same (speake of consent, or what you list) to wring out of the speciall reproche of your players the generall of your house. As for the former concerning the infamie, the qualitie whereof not content to amplifie with termes that may bee common to all infamie in a sort, you name it more intollerable to all honest mindes then death it selfe: whether doe you meane the infamie they are charged with by the Civil law, in the first reason; or that

which lighteth on them by the lawe of God, in the reasons folowing? If by the civill law: then belike a chast and honestlie minded woman, who having lost her husband doeth marrie within twelue moneth after his decease, had rather shee were dead: and her father likewise, who placeth her so in mariage, had rather he were dead with her. For both these are noted with infamie by the L. 1. D. de his qui notā

               praiseworthy, but that which is honest, iust, pure, vertuous; every fault hath infamie, annexed therevnto; not everie fault a litle degree and height of infamie, but everie fault infamie? Doe you not thinke that all your players haue some fault: and account the shame thereof to bee more tollerable a great deale, then death? Doe you not confesse (though tempering it with saying it may be so perhaps) that they haue in their playing picked out as it were quailes eyes of a wantonnes, and offended in some small matter? What needed then your tragicall exaggeration of hatefull open infamie, more intollerable to all honest mindes then death it selfe: when al that I enforced against them was but infamie? whom sought you to make hatefull by that patheticall speech, tending to compassion of Ulysses in shew, to somewhat else in deede: Unhappy Ulysses, to whom as it was fatall ever to be in trouble in his life, so is he more hardly dealt withall after his death, that his person may not honestly bee resembled without note of infamie to the actor? Howe skilfull an inveigling is this of your players, to thinke themselves defamed most odiouslie for euer, when he who played Ulysses parte, one of the best, and therefore least of all touched with that note, is said to bee so touched with it, that all the troubles of Ulysses are nothing to his shame? Nay, the shame inflicted on him who played Ulysses, is such a vexation to Ulysses himselfe, that hee is more hardly dealt withall herein (poore soule) after his death, then while in his life time Homer. Odyss. lib. 9. his sweete wine was drunke, his men were eaten vp, two at a meale, by Polyphemus; himself escaped hardlie through Polyphemus
               
rammes helpe out of his clouches, not without great feare, I know, when Polyphemus talked with the ramme; and beside the danger to bee soonke and drowned by the top of a mountaine that Polyphemus hurled at him, Lib. 12. hee was tossed in the sea, vpon broken peeces of his shippe, beeing wracked, ten nights and nine dayes, saue one wherin he stucke fast to a wild figtree growing in Charybdis; whereof, and of a great deale more Lib. 5. such woe, he tasted, by Lib. 10. his mens vnhappie letting out of the windes, which Aeolus had giuen him bound vppe in a leathren bagge or satchell.
            To make an end of this point, I am to request your Students and your house; because you constraine me (that I may vse the Psal. 69. 4. 
               Prophets phrase) to restore that which I tooke not away, that they wil consider how the note of infamie, which I did enforce, I enforced it against the partes played by Histrio, not against the Christ church parties who played them; against Roscius & Aesopus, not against the Maister of your Choristers; I meane against players, not against those players: as Orat. in Pis. 
               Tullie saith of Piso, that when the Aedilis es factus. Piso est à populo Rom. factus, non iste Piso. 
               Romans gaue him the office of the Aedileship, they gaue it to Piso, not to this Piso; meaning that in committing such place of honour to him they respected the dignitie of his name and stocke, not the qualities of his person. For as this Piso, the particular man, was lewde, base, dishonorable; yet Piso, the kinred it selfe, whereof hee came, was honorable and renowmed: semblablie may players, the generall that I spake of, bee esteemed infamous; and yet the same infamie, as small as it is in comparison of the capitall markes you fasten on it, be lesse or none at all in the speciall persons of your house, of those players. Which, if it be lawfull for me to compare lesser things with greater (as I, by the example of Mat. 13. 3. Mar. 12. 1. Luke 14. 21. and so forth in the Evangelistes commonlie. our Sauiours parables alwayes thought I might, & neuer heard them called incomparable comparisons till you controlled mee with this taunt and the like for vsing them) I shall make plaine vnto you by the cleere euidence & light of both those laws, whence they are charged.

In a woord, Rom. 1. 29. all impious and vnhonest wretches, namelie the vnrighteous, fornicatours, adulterous, theeves, covetous, drunkardes, raylers, extortioners, are infamous. The 1 Cor. 6. 11

            Yea, although you saye it greeueth them not a little that they should in private, but much more in publike, be charged with infamie, I beleeue and hope so much the better of them: knowing that there is a 2. Cor. 7. 9. 
               griefe to repentance, which the Lorde worketh in his by such reproofes; and it was well with Mat. 26. 75. 
               Peter, whē he wept bitterlie. Wherefore hauing this perswasion of your players, euen of them for whose partes I charged playes most, namelie Hippodamia, Melantho, the Nyph, Phaedra, & her Nurse; if I should haue noted them as infamous, them I saye, not their partes, these players and not players; I should haue taken on me the iudgement that belongeth vnto the searcher of heartes and reines, and spoken against mine owne conscience. Which if you haue made them beleeue I loue them so ill, by reason of the bad conceit I haue of them, that I would doe of spite and malice to discredit them: yet lett me intreat them to thinke I loue my selfe better, then that I would through their sides wounde mine owne; who, when I was about the age that they are, six and twentie yeares since, did play a womans parte vpon the same stage, the part of Hippolyta. As for you, who pretending in your proposition you would assay to shewe that the trueth in this controuersie belongeth rather to your aunswers, then to the reasons fathered on Momus, doe afterward endeuour in your confutation to obscure & darken the trueth with mistes of pitie and humane affectiōs, inculcating that it would be a contumelie to this or that youth with manie, vnlesse the cause be wonne on your side: lett mee intreat you likewise to regard hereafter, if not my most reasonable petition and desire,

yet your owne conclusion; who, saying you may graunt without offence, you trust, that your censure of Momus in the generalitie lighteth vpon me, doe adde these woordes to proove it; For the maine matter is not, whether you had occasion to thinke your self to bee touched in the generalitie, or no, being of that opinion you are, but whether the opinion bee iustifiable, or no. Which point if you remember in your next replie, though next replie rather I need not much to feare if this point be remembred, no more then Cato needed to feare Galbas aunswere, who had bene condemned except he had vsed boyes & teares, as Cic. lib. 1. de oratore. 
               Cato wrote; but, had you remembred it in your last replie: you might haue induced me the more easilie to hearken vnto your advise and request, that I should rather deale with you by private conference then by furder writing, if you had greatlie erred in any thing.
            
            For the trueth and equitie of that which I said in defense of the reasons fathered on Momus to the reproofe of playes, is so vndoubted and manifest of it selfe; that men of vnderstanding and sense, who should compare your replie with it, must (though I kept silence) needes perceyue your stomake was sick of that

               the dogged appetite: more greedily disposed to deuoure and swallow vp all that it mett with, then able to concoct or to retaine well ought that it had taken. A proofe heereof you giue in your verie beginning by crossing of my proême. Wherein I hauing thanked you for that by enlarging your aunswere to Momus, you shewed why you thought our reasons to be naught, sith that your reprooving thereof did touch mee also, who tooke them not to bee rascall reproches, as you termed them, but sound reasons: euerie braunch hereof you carpe and checke. But how? First, where I had written, that as our Saviour, when he was smitten by one for speaking naught but reason, saide, If I haue spoken evill, beare witnesse of the evill; but if well, why doest thou smite me? so they, whose obiections against playes you attributed to the person of Momus, might iustlie saye in my iudgement, If our reasons be naught, discouer their naughtines; if good, why doe you Mome vs? You replie, that no man can rightlie say to you, If our reasons bee naught, discouer their

naughtines; if good, why doe you Mome vs? as Christ might truely say, If I haue spoken euill, beare witnes of the evill; but if well, why doest thou smite me? because he vndoubtedlie had said nothing but reason, and therefore was most vniustlie smitten; but the obiections in your case and against you, are most vntrue, and there is no man smiten by you. Then which speech of yours (I pray you be not offended with me for my plainesse) I neuer read anie, to my remembrance, more voide of reason. For our Sauiours dilemma (according to Hermogen. de invēt. 
                     〈◊〉
                  . 4 ex Demost. de corona. Cic. lib. 1. de invent sub no mine complexion. the naturall force of that argument) was made to apprehend and holde fast his aduersarie whether soeuer him selfe had spoken, euill, or well. So that, when the Mat. 27. 38. two theeues, who suffered with Christ, and Luke 23. 41. deserued death, were brought into iudgement, in case the iudge had offered to giue sentence against them Act. 25. 16. before they *heard why, they might haue iustlie saide, If we haue robbed any, beare witnesse of our robberie; if not, why doe you condemne vs? Wherfore when, to reproove the former part of my dilemma, you affirme that no man can rightlie saye vnto you, If our reasons bee naught, discouer their naughtines, because Christ vndoubtedlie had saide nothing but reason: vndoubtedly your selfe doe speak beside all reason. As much in a manner, as beside the trueth, when to reprooue the later part thereof you adde, that you doe Mome no man. For so must I interpret your wordes of smiting no man: or else you speake beside all reason herein too, when vpon my citing Christes wordes, Why doest thou smite me, by way of similitude to your Moming vs, you say, no man is smitten by you. But that some are smitē by you with Momus name, euen all reproovers of playes, and so (which is the next branch you plucke at) my selfe; I shewed by the meaning of the tale of Momus, opened out of Aristotle, ioyned with your applying thereof vnto a person who chargeth playes as we doe. To the refutation whereof it maketh nothing, that when you declared you did enlarge therefore your aunswer vnto Momus, because I and others had asked why the thinges by him obiected were not answered, you say that by others you meant some of your friends, not reprovers of playes: and that you had no purpose to touch me in particular, nor knew, when you conceyued and penned

the devise of Momus, that I had reprooved them. For was it the man in the moone, trow we, whose Probra Arrepta quae cógessit ex triviis. 
               rascall reproches, or (as you correct it) triviall and common, you put in the mouth of Momus, and made your Epilog controll them? Or was it some on earth, whose speeches, being noted by you as commō and taunting, doe argue that they had one or more authours, not friendes, but adversaries of playes? Moreouer, when you tell me, that till you vnderstoode it by me and by a Preacher of late, you neuer thought that either I, or anie other, in the Universitie had abbetted Momus obiections: doe you not confesse, that, ere you wrote this, you vnderstood it of vs two? And can you perswade your selfe that we twoo alone, and no body else, are abbetters of them? Nay, doe you not signifie that you see there are more, when, speaking of others, you saye you mean
                     •…
                   not such, as you perceyue by me there are, who should mislike your playes; and by way of opposing me and them to Many, you name vs One or a Few? You acknowledge then, that notwithstanding your selfe meant not these by others, yet certaine such there are. Neither can your vsing the devise of Criticus & Zoilus in like maner to rebuke the carpers of your owne Tragedie as curious and malitious, permit you to denie with anie colour of probabilitie that you meant to note these by Momus name. Chieflie nowe that you haue expreslie fastened it on them in your replie: saying in excuse of the time, the Sunday, whereon your Tragedie was played, that some of them, it may bee, who misliked your playes, were worse occupied then your actors were on the same night, playing Momus part in good earnest before you, which you did afterward but for pastime. Wherefore your complayning that you knowe not whom, nor very well what, I meane by They & Us, in that I said, They whose obiections, and, Why doe you Mome vs, is frivolous and idle, to say no worse of it: frivolous, because you know I meane the Preacher, my self, and all abbetters of Momus his obiections: idle, because albeit you knew not whom I meane, yet my speech is found, that, They, whose obiections against playes, you attributed to the person of Momus, might iustlie say in my iudgement, If our reasons be naught, discouer their naughtines; if good, Why doe you Morne

vs? More idle and frivolous is your labouring to perswade me, that I had no iust occasion to suspect that your purpose was therein to touch me, to taxe me in particular; both by discoursing that those two inducements, to weet, my reproving of Theater-sights and stage-playes in the Preface of my Thesis, and my reasons giuen thereof in letters to D. Thornton, which I (so you affirme) did chieflie alleadge to proove my coniecture, are not enough to proove it, in as much as you had not read the one of thē, nor heard of the other: and by most earnestlie avouching coram Deo (as if an Gal. 1. 20. oath needed to cleare you from my wrongfull opinion and surmise) that your meaning onely was to moove delite in the auditorie, with the noveltie of the invention, and the person; and to obiect those things against your selues by your selues, which might abate all suspicion of vaine glorie or selfe-pleasing in you; and so by this meanes, as it were with a slight, to shift of all occasion of others ill speaking, whē you had prevented them with as ill as mought be. I saye, this is more idle and frivolous then the former, because I was so farre from making any shew of suspecting my selfe to be touched purposely by you in particular: that contrariwise I signified I thought my self touched, not so, but in generall; by the censure lighting, not in your intent, but in event, vpon me. And for this respect alone, not for the other, did I alleadge those writings of mine, whiche you mention; to proove, not a coniecture thereby, but a certaintie, that I was a reproover of playes; and therefore sith you meant to note all such reproovers vnder the name of Momus, as I shewed withall, must needes thinke my selfe to bee touched therein. Which also I deliuered with such care of plainesse and perspicuitie, distinguishing eftsoones your intent of noting no particular man from your generall note touching mee by consequent, that as on the one parte you could not choose but graunt that I had occasion to thinke my self touched in the generalitie; likewise of the other, you were enforced to see, that I gaue no token of anie way suspecting you to haue intended particularlie to taxe me.

side to wound you, according to the law of charitie, vpon my former protestation, you doe most gladly credit mee, as you write; and with these, The matter is cleered in your good minde; thus your selfe commende mee, and hartily thanke mee for it. A strange kinde of dealing to charge a man with thinking amisse of your purpose, who, by your owne confession, thinketh rightly of it; to touch him as breaking the lawe of charitie through false surmises, who keepeth it in your owne iudgement; to take the name of God for effecting with him by new protestation, that which your former protestation, your selfe saye, had obtained of him; by manifest misconstruction to presse out of his writing a point whereof hee writeth the contrarie, as your selfe witnesse; to controll a thing as misdeemed by him vppon erroneous coniecture, which your owne conscience testified to you, and your owne mouth to others, that it is cleered in his minde; finally to pretend, that being assaulted by one who sought your life, you were compelled to enter a long combat with him, when you graunt straightwayes vpon the ende thereof that no man did assault you; it was a post onelie, whereon you sett a helmet to make it seeme a man, that so by valiant foyning at it, and hacking of it, you might gett the creditt of having slaine an enemie, and left him in the place as dead as a doore naile.

How like a distemper you are fallen into, through desire of swalowing vp & contradicting all that I had written, which yet your want of strength to hold and maintaine doeth force you to regorge and yeelde: your going onward in this course bewrayeth farder. For I, to shew how all reproovers of playes are noted as vniust reproovers by your tale of Momus, declared out of Aristotle, that it was devised to checke such as reprooue vnjustly the best and perfitest workes of the most wise and skilfull. You reply that you brought him not in so much in that sense that Aristotle speaketh of, as a reproover of the best and

perfitest workes of the most wise and skilfull; for I never tooke (say you) either our selves, or our playes to bee such: but as wee commonly take him as a carper, and a pincher at all thinges that are done with any opinion of well dooing. Wherein with one breath you overthwart, and graunt, the purport of my speech. You overthwart it in saying that you brought Momus in, as we cōmonly take him; & opposing this point to the point I mentioned, Not in that sense that Aristotle speaketh of, but thus: You graunt it in confessing that you brought him in also in that sense, though not so much in that sense: which I said not you did so much, but only that you did it. And albeit herein by gainesaying me with your, Not, and But, you may seeme to charge me with saying that you brought him in so much in that sense: yet you meant rather by cunning interlacing of those words, so much, closely to discharge your mouth of a morsel, which you had taken in, and felt it overhoott and burning. For having alleaged Ipsamque reprehendit artificem om nium.

               after this sort, Momus (whom you bring in) though dooing nought him selfe, yet carpeth at the best; and hath with these and these tants declaimed against your playes. So, whereas your reason, that you never tooke your selves or your playes to be such, should import that you brought him not in at all in that sense; and then had I affirmed amisse, that you rehearsed the tale to such purpose: your ground thereof alayed with the termes, so much, implieth that you grant, that the thing it self, which I affirmed, is true, and that you were disposed to playe by this conveyance a iugling tricke of fast and loose. Againe, whereas I noted that you called our reasons, attributed to Momus, rascall reproches, vsing the English words to expresse your Latin, probra arrepta ex triviis: first you wish I had not so tanslated it, for that the wordes in Latin naturally sound not so hardly; yet afterward you graūt that you know the words may be so properly translated. Wherof in the later how manifestly you cast vp that which you swalowed in the former, appeereth by your labouring to cōfirme the former, what with De verbo

               Alciats saying, that

               wordes must bee generally taken so farre foorth as their proprietie may beare; what with your owne denying that In your copie sent me, it is, arrepta ex triviis: wt greater iniurie if you meant to sup presse the word probra Which that you did, you giue me occasion to suspect, becaus before likewise, you cite it, leaving out ye word, & English it common & triviall speeches: yet because in another copie, giuē by you abroad, belike after mine, I find ye word here: I take the omitting therof in my copie to bee a slippe of your penne, and therfore doe insert it. 
               probra arrepta ex triviis doe most properly and principally signifie rascall reproches. Most properly, and principally; a like feate in adding to the worde properly, most, and principally, as before in thrusting in the termes, so much: sith neither in the clause, which answereth to this, you ioyne most with naturally; nor say out of Alciat, that wordes must be taken as their most principall proprietie may beare (though by an Primus autem intellectus proprietatis est sua vniuscujusque rei appellatio other note of his, From parag. 5. as if it ensued the rest of the words you cite out of Paragr. 10 displaced cunningly, and racked herevnto, it seemeth you would faine imply it) but as their proprietie.

But sith your selfe acknowledge that wordes naturally doe sound and signifie that which they signife properly, and that these in question may bee translated properly as I did translate them: you shew that in affirming they doe not naturally sound so hardly, you controlled as false that which your selfe knew to be true, yea, which you needes must so acknowledge. In like sort doe you crosse your me, nay, you crosse yourselfe, when in an other enditement that you drawe against me for the same Englishing of your Latin, to weet, that though the wordes may bee so properly translated, yet not to your minde so properly, that is, not so gently as you meant them, and therefore I did mistranslate them: you say that in lawe and reason they are ever to bee interpreted according to their natural and proper signification, vnlesse we coniecture that hee who speake them meant otherwise; and no

man can iustly coniecture that you meant to vse any honest man with so illtermes, when you meant no man at all. See the pitifull taking of such as seeke devises to bolster out vntruths for their credits sake: who by those very shifts, by which they hope to scape, are oftentimes entangled, and as it were with nettes or chaines entrapped faster. Your owne affirmation, that you meant no man at all, doeth giue mee iust cause of coniecturing that you meant to vse the terme of rascall, as well as of reproches, be they never so ill. For in that you say, that you meant no man at all, you intend your former speech, that you meant Momus onely. Nowe you charged Momus with a

But what doe I reason out of your former writing that I had cause to thinke so: when your selfe, in this, doe giue most euident & cleere tokens that you meant so? For you say expressely that you made Momus to speake as ill as mought be; neither cared greatly what you made him say, as thinking any such thing became him well inough: nor talked otherwise of him, then as of a carper, a nipper, a depraver, and a reprehender of every goodthing. And can you deny that your meaning was to speak of his reproches as rascall, base and contemptible, whom you made purposely to speak as ill as mought be, and cared not what you made him say? or dare you affirme you meant to vse him gently, whom you accuse of carping, nipping, depraving, and reprehending all good thinges, and doe rough hewe him in such sorte? You tell me that how words are to be taken in charitie I know better then you: but in law and reason they are to bee interpreted with this rule of thé speakers meaning.
               
Belike because you weened that you had prooved hereby, (chieflie having quoted thereto a Alciat. de verb. signifi. lib. 1. 
               lawiers text,) that, look in what sense you say you meant your wordes, in that I must interpret them by law and reason: you thought that I was likewise in charitie bound to thinke that you meant them so, in as much as the scripture saieth, 1 Cor. 13. 7 
               Charitie beleeueth all things. But you should haue marked that the scripture saith also, Prov. 14. 15 
               A foole beleeueth every thing: and he who exhorteth the faithful to be charitable, dehorteth them from doeing foolishlie, Ephe. 5. 15. 
               Walke not as fooles, but as wise. A sure demonstration, that charitie is said to beleeue all things, not properlie, but in a figure; not simplie all, but a number; euen all that a good man in wisedome may beleeue. And to 2 Thes. 2. 11 beleeue vntruthes, is a point of follie; repugnant, as to wisedome, so consequentlie to charitie: which in the 1 Cor. 13. 6 same parcell of scripture is saide, not to reioyce in iniquitie, but to reioyce at the trueth. Wherefore seeing reason doeth shew by sundrie circumstances, that you say vntrulie, You meant not to vse so ill and hard termes, as rascall reproches; and this is the naturall and proper signification of your Latin wordes, which therefore must be so interpreted by law: it were to be wished, that you learned better what charitie requireth, before you raise vncharitable suspicions of others as sinning against it whē they doe not; and then it might bee hoped you would no more pretend the name of law or reason, to plaister your vnreasonable and vnlawfull blaming of things deliuered rightlie according both to law and reason.

               Pindarus sayth, that men who take workes in hande, must sett them forth with beautifull forefrontes and entrees. The lesse doe I marvell that you who make so badd a beginning of your worke, deale worse, if worse might be, and more perverslie in the rest. Whereof to reserue for their severall places the proofe that in a maner all the particulars yeeld; two generall kindes of seelie evasions and shiftes may serue for the first taste: one, that when you see your argumentes refuted, you denie them to bee yours; an other that you say, you vsed them not to vs, but to Momus; and by this fine devise you neither aunswere Momus, nor vs. For examples sake, whereas to the obiection made out

of the worde of God against your playes, that it is vnlawfull for men to put on wemens raiment, you replied that it is not vnlawfull simply and alwayes, as if one doe it to save his life, to benefitt manie: I shewed that this reason is vnsound and naught:; A mā to saue his life or countrey, may doe it; He may doe it therefore to play a parte on a stage. Herevnto you answere, that you doe not thus argue, It is lawfull in such and such cases to putt on womens raiment; Ergo it is lawfull to doe it in playes: but thus; ergo it is not simplie vnlawfull so to doe. And did you argue thus in deed, neyther concluded you, that it is lawfull therefore to doe it in playes? Certes then you disputed valiantlie against Momus, who Praeclara res est Mimus, & gestum assequi, Simulare vultū ac verba, testari Deos, Et sub puella tegere iuvenem puberem. reprooved playes because young men are cladde like maidens therein. But your whole discourse doeth argue that this argument whereof you are ashamed (well, if you would also ingenuouslie confesse it) was intended by you. For you professed that albeit you thought Momus rascall reproches against playes worthier to bee laughed at, then to bee refuted: 
               Graviora paucis excutere fas sit tamen. 
               yet the weightiest of them you would in fewe wordes shake out of their ragges; or who soeuer you will translate your excutere, applied to those rascalls. Now by what consequence doeth your aunswer shake that reproche of his, vnlesse it conclude that men may be lawfully cladde in playes like wemen? Or who is so blinde that reading your reply, perceyueth not your Nō ergo vestis faeminea iuveni est sce lus, sed prava mens, libido, &c. second Ergo, I say your second, For the Nō ergo iuueni est grande simpliciter nefas Mollem puell induere first (I graunt) concludeth, that it is not simply vnlawfull so to doe; but the seconde Ergo, with the Quid simile nobis obiicere quisquam potest? assumption following, and the Maledicta textú glossa quae vitiat bonum. 
               Epiphonema, directlie do imply a contradicting of Momus; and therfore a concluding out of the former point, that, because it is lawfull in such and such cases to put on Wemens raiment, Ergo it is lawfull to doe it in playes? What? And when you saide that Nec habitus vllus, sed ani mus turpem facit. 
               no apparell but the minde doeth make a man dishonest, meant you not that men may weare womens raiment with honestie in playes? Whē you concluded that Quae dixit in nos alia diluere haud placet. 
               You list not wash away other things which Momus spake against you: did you not imply that heerein you had mett with his blaming you for young men made maidens on the stage? When you begged a Proinde disrumpantur vt Momo ilia, Iterum benignus vndique applausus sonet. seconde Plaudite of the beholders, that the guttes of Momus might burst for spite asunder:
               
sought you their approbation of Achilles changing his sexe to saue his life; or of Melanthos dooing it to feede theatricall humours? In the Lib. 2. ca. 30 
               Greek Epigrammes we read of two deafe men impleading one the other before a deafe iudge. Amongst whom when the plaintife obiected to the defendant, that hee ought him fiue moneths rent for his house, and the defendant answered that he was grinding corne at the mill that night: What a Gods name, quoth the iudge, what needeth this contention? Hath not eche of you a mother? Let eche finde his owne. I am glad, Mr D. Gager, that by your appealing to the iudgement of our betters, wee haue agreed on iudges who heare well inough. For they, vnderstāding how your Ulysses redux is penned and was played, will iudge that you are not deafe: as Cic. de Senect. their like at Athens hauing heard Oedipus Coloneus read, a tragedie written by Sophocles, gaue sentence that he was not a sott or doting man. And therefore, though you tell them that in your reply, of grinding at the mill, you meant to proove onely that you hurt not Momus by seeking of his life or purse that night on Salsbery plaine: yet they, considering wiselie that you professed to aunswer his bill of complaint touching the fiue moneths rent, will think you argued thus against him; I was grinding corne at the mill that night, Ergo I owe him not fiue moneths rent for his house. Neither can I doubt but they will in like sort mislike your other practise, of saying that you spake not to vs but to Momus, and so slipping away with answering neither him, nor vs. As when you asked vs in Momus person, (so I tooke it) Dare ye despise learned poetrie? secretlie to inferre thereby your maine conclusion, that if learned poetrie may not be despised, your students may be actors of learned Poets playes; and I out of St Paul did refell this argument: you reply that you asked not of me, or them, or any man but Momus, any such question. Which thing you doe not onely avouch vpon your word, affirming that you should be beleeued: but you cite your writing also to prove it, An tu Poësin despicere doctam audeas? Vrging that you said not, An vos; but An tu.

Yea, in so much worse sorte doe you suppe this againe vp, whiche you vomited before, of meaning neither mee nor anie other man in your reproofe of Momus: because you adde such reasons to proove you meant not vs in asking that questiō, as your selfe must needes know you vttered but a sicke mans dreame. For (to beginne with the later, which is the stronger of them) your selfe doe acknowledge vpon my proofe thereof out of your owne wordes, that in Epistola ad Criticum. your reproofe of Criticus and Zoilus, whosoever findeth such fault with your Tragedie, as you controll them for, him you meant to note as a malitious Zoilus, and a carping Criticke. Yet the Criticke you speake to in the singular number, as well as to Momus: You answere to his sundrie checkes of your epistle, Rectè tu quidem ista, Critice, si scriberem epigrammata: you say not vos, but tu. You note him for his Ita es ingeniose maledicus. wittie railing at your Tragedie, Profectò ipsum te esse Criticum oportet: you say not vos, but te. You detest his foolish & quarelsome wranglings, Emoriar si amem lites, saltem criticas, id est futiles, id est tuas, Critice: you say not vestras, but tuas. You come vpon him eftsoones, againe, and againe, with Quid enim putidius, quàm quod tu facere soles?

               tu, and tuae; and, Critice, as to one still: you saye not vos Critici, vos Critici, and vestrae. Wherefore if notwithstanding your forme of speech to one in the singular number, you inten ded it to all, as curious carpers, who will be picking quarells at your Tragedie-writing: alas, What was become of your wittes and senses, when by such a cavill you thought to convince me, that, because you said not An vos, but An tu, you meant not 5 Lector debebit tuae, id est, malae linguae. your speech to me and all others, as vniust reproovers, who will be finding fault with your enterlude-playing?

A conceit, that seemed ridiculous to Tullie: yet coming farre behinde that which yours implyeth, that no other woman but Caia alone was meant in the treatise, and therefore none but shee might bee so betrothed. By consequence whereof if you had lived in those dayes, you must haue mainteined that it was not lawfull for any to bee maried but onely Iohn and Ioane, I

would say Caius and Caia. For Plutar. Romanor. institutor. ca. 30. the maner was that they, who brought the bride into the bridegromes house, did bid her vse this speech, Ubi tu Caius, ego Caia: not making any mention of Lucius and Lucia, Sempronius and Sempronia, but of Caius and Caia; neither saying nos, & vos, but tu & ego.
            
            Nowe if the stronger of your reasons hinder not but your demande might bee made to vs: much lesse doeth the weaker.
            For whereas you tell vs, that you demanded not of me, or them, or any man but Momus, any such question, if you may be beleeued; as, why you should not, you see no cause: first how prooue you this, that you see no cause, why you should not bee beleeued? Forsooth because you were as sure (you say) that I or any learned man did not despise poëtrie, as you were certaine that Momus did. O miserable blindnesse shall I say? or madnes, wherewith your humorous greedines of crossing me distracted you. As who say you had not so much the greater reason to aske vs such a question, because you were sure that wee did not despise poetrie. Else you must affirme that when Christ demanded, Matt. 12. 12 
               what man shall there be among you that hath a sheepe, who, if it fall on a Sabbat day into a pitt, will not take holdof it, and lift it out? Hee asked not any such question of the Phariseis, or Scribes, or any man, but your Momus brethren, that is, the men whom fansies imagine in the cloudes: because hee was as sure that the Phariseis or any wise man would not suffer his sheepe to lie in the pitt on the Sabbat day, as hee was certaine that the cloudes would. For if you perceaue that Christ, to make the Phariseis confesse that it is lawfull to heale a man on a Sabbat day, had reason to demand whether they would not lift vp their sheepe out of a pitt then, which hee knewe they would; that by granting this they might discerne the better they must needes graunt that: how could you choose but see, that your purpose being to make vs confesse, that comedies & tragedies may bee lawfully played, you had like reason to aske whether wee did despise learned poëtrie, which you were sure we did not; that by graunting this (you thought) wee might the rather be forced to graunt that. Wherefore sith-even herein there was cause sufficient to make mee imagin that you did

demande the question of vs: you should conclude rather that your sight was naught, who saw not so much, then that, because you saw it not, you should bee beleeued affirming the contrarie. Moreover, to admitt there was no cause herein why you should not be beleeved, yet might there bee in somewhat else: and such, as you should also haue easily espied, vnlesse the inordinate passion of your minde had daseled your sight. For your L 2. D. de testibus. l. 27 D. ad leg. Corn. de fals. 
               law informed you that they, who are vnconstant and light in their testimonies, must not be beleeued: Now, though you perceue not your own fault therein, as Politicor. lib. 3. cap. 12 
               Aristotle saith, Physicians beeing sicke can not discerne the trueth touching their owne diseases because of their distemper, and therefore doe they vse the helpe of other Physicians: the events of your hungry sicknes, which I noted, doe manifestly argue, that you wauered much in saying and vnsaying the same when you wrote to me. And how small account of yeelding to the trueth you make in these matters, you had shewed before when Epist. ad Criticum. you tolde Criticus, that Haud seio an vera ista sint: fortasse non multum absunt à veris Sed tamē libet ire contrà. 
               you know not whether those things be true, which hee obiecteth; and perhaps they are not farre from beeing true: yet are you disposed to goe against them, to crosse them. You might see cause therefore why you should not bee beleeved in that you affirme you demanded not of vs, or any man but Momus, any such question. Howbeit granting this, which you so wrastle for, what say you then to Momus; I meane to the argument implied in your demaunde to him, and prooved by mine aunswere to bee naught and defectiue? Nay, not a worde to that. Onely, as if you would say that you were disposed to spurre him idle questions, and not to reason against him; or that, although the reason meant therein were naught, yet good enough for him whom you make a Mome and faine to your selfe a foolish adversarie, a thing that Lib. 5. ca. 13 Declamatores in primis sunt admonendi, ne sibi stultum adversariū fingant. Facimus autem &c. 
               Quintilian misliketh in declaimers; you say that you asked it of no man but of Momus. Thus in these generall and common kindes of miserable evasions and shifts through the mist whereof you would scape away: our iudges will acknowledge (I hope) that your intent was rather to seek corners for hiding of your fault, then to confesse your oversights and yeelde the victorie to the

truth. Surely, for mine owne parte, your dealing doeth perswade mee that when you resolved to reply vpon mee, you thought with your selfe the same that you vttered in your epistle vnto Criticus: I know not whether these thinges bee true which he writeth; and perhaps they are not farr from being true, 
               Sed tamen libet ite contrà. 
               yet am I disposed to haue a crash against them.
            
            Yea, even for the branches and points wherevnto you stand in the particulars, the fower heades of reasons, neither denying their drift, the marke they aimed at; nor excusing them as faire against Momus, though they come nothing neere the marke: albeit you deale with greater probabilitie, and therefore cary your selfe the bolder, yet deale you like your selfe, and lay still the colours of probabilitie on sophistrie. For whereas in the first, concerning the iudgement of the ancient Romans holding all stage-players infamous by their lawe, you saide that the Praetor pronounced none infamous but such as played for gaine sake, and I prooved the contrarie by the Praetors words: you reply that the Praetor meant the same that you say, though his wordes were generall of stage-players without distinction. This in the formost ranke, if it will prevaile. If not; you adde thereto, that the actors of your playes are no stageplayers. But how false both these thinges are, and how fraudulently sought to bee avouched: our bettets, if it please them to compare my proofes with your reply, shall see. For Tullie, as I shewed, affirmeth that the Romans counting all kindes of stageplayes shamefull and dishonest, agreed that such as played them should not onlie want the honour of other citizens, but also bee disfranchised: Which, for the last note of infamie, beeing also witnessed by Livie, and S. Austin having therevpon observed that the Romans counted all stage-players infamous: Gothofredus knowing that the edict of the Praetor did expresse the iudgement and law of the Romans, and marking that the words of the edict were generall touching all stage-players, saith in the interpreting thereof that both players for gaine sake and without gaine were helde infamous by it, according to S. Austin and Livie. And this to haue bene truely saide by Gothofredus, I declared agreeably to the grounds of law by testimonies of the Romans;
               
of Cornelius Nepos, Laberius, Iuvenal, Suetonius, Tacitus, Die, and others. As for that Vlpian (whose wordes you cited as the Praetors) and Pegasus with Nerva, doe say that such as play for gaine sake are infamous, I aunswered that it foloweth not that therefore they thought free players not infamous: sith the Scripture likewise counteth a woman infamous who prostituteth her body vnto men for mony; yet counteth her infamous too who doeth it freely. Or if they thought the Praetors edict to haue that meaning, which perhaps they did: then they come too short of his meaning somewhat, and are well corrected therefore by Gothofredus. Now you, to proove the contrarie and disproove my proofes, affirme that D. de his qui notantur infam. l. 2. §. Ait Praetor. 
               Nerva and Pegasus adde those words Quaestus causa, & propter praemiū. 
               for gaine sake to distinguish players for gaine from free players, which, you say, is manifest: and againe as manifest, you say, that Ulpian doeth approove their distinction. But if you thought good to confirme this point, whereof I shewed onely what cause I had to dout, I denied it not: you should bring strong arguments to convince they doe so, not idle affirmatiōs that it is manifest they doe. For what if a wealthie and lasciuious courtisan should say that Deut. 23. 18 
               Moses mentioneth the hire of the whoore, to distinguish mercenarie whoores frō free and franke dames, as it is manifest: and againe, as manifest that the Hos. 9. 1. Mic. 1. 7. Prophets doe approove his distinction? were there any weight in this to perswade vs that Moses and the Prophets mention the whoores hire to distinguish hired whoores frō defilers of them selues without hire; vnhonest from honest; infamous from prayse-worthie: and not to note rather that such as play the whoores doe it for hire commonlie? You adde, that Glossa communis, Baldus, Petrus de Castro (would you not say Paulus? for Petrus I can not heare of) and all whom you have seene vpon that text of law doe so vnderstand it. This is an argument yet: though not strong enough. For all, whō you have seene, vnderstand it so. It may be. But others, who haue seene more law-bookes, perhaps can tell you of many that vnderstand it otherwise. My selfe, as few as I haue seene, can tell you of two; Annotat. in

                  . 
               Budaeus, and an Autour of a Greeke abridgement of the Civill law, whom Budaeus citeth. For the Greeke authour doth

expound it thus, That all, who trie masteries in solemne games for gaine sake, are infamous:

               and also they who come vpon the stage for prayse sake. And Budaeus moving a question and doubt how these wordes of the text, that all who come vppon the stage

               for reward, are infamous; should be vnderstoode, whether that they be not also infamous who come vpon the stage

               for vaineglorious ostentation, answereth and resolveth out of St 
               Augustin, and Livie, 
               Attem omnem scenicā probrosam Romae fuisse: atque omnes scenicos censoria nota tribu moueri solitos. 
               that all stageplaying was counted infamous at Rome, and all stageplayers were wont to be disfranchised by the Censors. Whose interpretation in a point of this qualitie deserveth more credit then a hundred such as Paulus de Castro: so meanlie seene in the text he treateth of, that he giueth the word, stage, a different meaning from that in the Praetors edict, which it expoundeth; and saith, it speaketh of other games. An argument much stronger in shew, in substance weaker, you fetch out of the text: that in certamen descendere, and in scenam prodire, doe (as they saye in your lawe) ambulare aequis passibus, in the same places of the same title, De his qui notātur infamia; but it is most evident, that 
               D. de postulando. l. 1. §. bestias. & D. de his qui not. infam. l. 4. 
               qui descendit in certamen depugnaturus cum bestijs dentatis, ac feris, virtutis ostendendae nō mercedis causa, non est notatus; Ergo qui prodit in scenam pronuntiandi gratia sine praemio & quaestu, non est notatus. Which syllogisme of yours if you allow for good: what say you vnto this, that (me seemes) is like it? In certamen descendere and in scenam prodire doe ambulare aequis passibus in the same places of the same title; but it is most evident, that D. de his qui not. infam. l. 4. C de athletis. l. un. 
               qui descendit in certamen luct a aut cur su certaturus cum hominibus non facit artem ludicram; Ergo qui prodit in scenā pronuntiandi gratia non facit artem ludicra. The major is your owne. The minor as true as yours: Yet the conclusiō false; which L. 1. 2. & 3. D. de his qui not. infam. the same places of the same title shew. And seeing by my syllogisme you perceiue, I trust, that the manlie exercises of wrastling and running doe farre out-runne stageplaying, as it is meete they should: you see that the major of your syllogisme fayleth, and that certamen and scena doe not walke with evē passe, but are coupled togither as a quick greyhound and a lazy curre. Farder is it from reason that you adioyne a reason of the favourable parte of the distinction out of

the C. de spectaculis. l. 1. in fine. 
               Code; or rather adioyne it not, but say that you thinke it may be gathered thence: because the games of wrastling, rūning, and such like be permitted to them who desire and offer to beare the charge thereof. When neither doeth it follow that because these games are allowed by Emperours to willing bearers of the charge, 
               L. 10. D. ad leg. Iul. de vi publica. 
               not imposed on the vnwilling, therefore free stageplayers are approved by Ulpian: and it is a wandring fansie to imagin why it should be so, when the question is whether it bee so or no. The reason of the other side which I sett downe to shew that the distinction can not be enforced out of Ulpians words, because the scripture likewise condemneth them of wickednes who play the hoores for hire, yet acquitteth not free hoores; you confute as soundly, as you confirme your owne. For you say it is simply evill to play the hoore, either freely or for reward; but not simply evill to come vpon the stage, because the law alloweth it if it bee done sine quaestu: which is a plaine begging of the point in question. And yet having tolde mee that I must evict that it is simply a sinne for any prodire in scenam, as it is for a woman to prostitute her body; (I cut off your superfluous words, as namely, vile, in adding which epitheton to sinne you double a fault corrected by your selfe before when you said, that I assume that the one is as greevous a sinne, as the other, or at the least as absolutely a sinne:) but having tolde me this, you pleade againe the same sophisme, avouching that your consequence, Prodire in scenam quaestus causa, infamat; ergo prodire in scenam sine quaestu, non infamat, is a good consequence, because the law so distinguisheth. How much greater reason had you to be perswaded, that sith I had evicted it to be simply evill, because simply infamous by the Praetors sentence, that is, by the law; Vlpian, with his autours, interpreters thereof, did insert those wordes not for distinction sake, but to note the common cause why it was practised, the loue of reward. Chiefly seeing otherwise it must needes folow there is

as shew them selves for applause to please men, are therein noted also, as Budaeus did. But I, who thinke there may be repugnancies in your textes, and had an eye to the point in question betwene vs, to weet, whether the Praetor, whose Edictum per petuū. Ascon. Paedian in cic. orat. pro corn D. de orig. jur. l. 2. §. Eodem tempore. C. de vet. jur. enucleand. l. 2. §.

               Christian Emperours after: I (as you acknowledge) did admit they thought so, but vrged that the Praetor affirmed the same that I doe, and they mistooke his meaning, as Gothofredus prooveth in his note thereon. To the which assertion, after a preferring of them before Gothofrede, if not in learning, yet authoritie, needelesse to bee stoode on; (for though hee were not better learned then they were, yet might he see by S. Austin and Livie that they saw not; neither is it autoritie, but learning, that must teach vs what the Praetor meant:) you say that in some sense his short, but quicke note, Immò & qui sine quaestu, hurteth not you at all. Well. In some sense then it hurteth you, in some it doeth not. And doth that sense, wherin he meant it, hurt you or no? If no: why say you afterward, Gothofrede doeth gloze against a manifest law without giuing any reason of his so doing? If yea: what spirit of wrangling had bewitched you to construe an autours words as not gainesaying you, which in his own meaning you knew made flat against you? For after you had saide, If hee meaneth thereby to taxe Laberius, Lentulus, Nero, and such like, that did exercere histrioniam, though gratuitam, his exception maketh not against your text; and had given a reason thereof, beside the text cleane, neither agreeing to Laberius, whom yet by your forenaming him it should haue touched: you come in with these wordes, But Gothofrede in deede foundeth his sharpe note vpon a saying of S. Austin, Omnes enim scenici probrosi; and of Livie, Et tribu moveri soliti. So you doe confesse that Gothofrede in deede, although you sensed him as if he taxed onely them who played to satisfie their dissolute and

lewde humours, that so hee might not seeme to make against your text, your sense thereof at least; yet in deede he counteth all stage-players infamous, according to the sayinges of S. Austin and Livie, whereon he foundeth his note. In deede Maister Gager, you are much to blame, who, to shew that you can obscure a most cleere truth with pretense of lawe, and a distinction of some sense, doe hazard the shipwracke of a good conscience, and wastfully employ your witt and time both, in bolstering out by writing that which your selfe see and knowe to bee vntrue. I did say before, that I gathered by your dealing that when you resolved to reply against me, you thought with your selfe: I know not whether these things be true which he writeth; yet am I disposed to haue a crash against them. Now I must inpart correct that my saying. For you shew that somewhere in your reply you thought; I know that this thing, which he writeth, is true; 
               Sed-tamen libet ire con

                  . 
               yet haue I a lust to contradict it.
            
            True it is therfore that by Gothofredes iudgement the Praetor accounted all stage-players infamous; and they, who tooke the Praetor otherwise, mistooke him. Whereof although I did not alleage Gothofredus for the chiefest proofe, but principally cited him to satisfie you, a lawier by a lawier, and prooved it by the best interpreter of the lawe, the practise and consent of the ancient Romans, which he doeth ground on also: yet you having answered him (you say) already as it were by the way, doe adde that by him the rest of my autorities and all mine examples also may receve their true, though short aunswer. The autorities then of Tullie, of Nepos, of Laberius, of Liuie, of Iuvenal, of Suetonius, of Tacitus, of Dio, and of S. Austin; the examples of Nero, Lentulus, and the rest, whom not such autours onely but the people of Rome too did esteeme infamous for their stage-playing, were it freelie, or for gaine; may bee aunswered by your answere to Gothofredus. And how? For hee (you say) glozeth against a manifest lawe without giuing any reason of his so doeing. Why? Doeth not he giue a reason in these wordes, Omnes enim scenici probrosi, & tribu moveri soliti, prooved by S. 
               De ciuit. Dei lib. 2. cap. 11 
               Austin and Lib. 7. 
               Livie? But S. Austin and Livie could never dreame of your text, you say; and so their autorities serve not to

interpret it. As who say Gothofredus brought them to interpret your text, that is, Ulpian: not rather to interpret the Praetors edict, & to correct your text thereby. For thus doth he reason in effect: Ulpian expounding the Praetors edict, saith that, they onely, who play vpon the stage for gaine sake, are infamous: but the Praetor meant that they, who play without gaine, are infamous also, even generally all stage-players; as it is apparant by S. Austin and Livie: therefore Ulpian misseth in expounding the Praetors edict. And, I trust, an older writer may be cited to correct a younger, of whom he could not dreame: or else your selfe doe evill to cite Ulpian against me, of whom hee could not dreame you wote well. Though S. Austin also might haue dreamed of Vlpian, 
               Vlpian lived about two hundred yeares before S. Aust. Lamprid. Alexandro Sever. Euseb. Chro. for ought that I know. But you saye farder that S. Austin and Livie are to bee vnderstoode against Histriones: and so their autorities serve not to this of your text. Wherein I must confesse I vnderstand not what you meane. For I can not imagin you should bee so absurd as to say that they speake not against players on stage, because they speake against Histriones. Onely as Diog. La

Nay, I say too litle when I say I thinke. For seeing histriones signifieth stage-players; & stage-players are such as come 
               Qui artis ludicrae pronuntiandive causa in scenam prodierit. 
               vpon the stage to play or pronounce, whom the Praetoris verba dicunt. l. 1. Ait Praetor. l. 2 D. de his qui not. infam. 
               Praetor speaketh of: I know, that what soeuer your meaning be therein, it can haue no force to ouerthrow that wich I concluded by Gothofredus. So this with the former distinctionlesse distinction of a sense he meant not, being all the answer that you make to him: the rest of my authorities and examples all are so farre from beeing answered by him, that your answerlesse answer doth rather leaue both him and them as vnanswerable. But you go forward, and, to ouerthrow them both an other way, you deny that the Romans euer iudged Omnes scenicos infames.
               
And why? Because playes (say you) were sometime instituted, as in a common plague, ad placandos Deos, and were prouided by great officers of the common treasure: and so they are referred ad religionem & deuotionem. Sometime they were sett out at the priuat cost of them that sued to the people for great offices, or generally for the honor and solace of the citie: and so they are referred to magnificence. For magnificentia is a goodly vertue, & versatur circa sumptus amplos, non turpes aut infames, because it is a vertue, but circa quaecunque in Rempublicam honestae laudis studio conferuntur: among the which 
               Ethicor. lib. 4. cap. 5. 
               Aristotle reckeneth Ludos splendidè facere. Neither is it to be thought that Aesopus & Roscius, being both men of that fame, favour, wealth, and entire familiarity with the best and wisest in their times, were reputed as infamous persons. What should I speake of so many Circi, Theatra, Amphitheatra, builded by the greatest and bravest Romās with so huge charge & sumptuousnes? Which though they were once vpon fowle abuses, or some other occasion, as you write, overthrowne by the Romans themselues: yet even those playes for which they were abolished were ex eo genere of whom they might haue said (as 
               Histor. lib. 1 
               Tacitus doeth of Astrologers) quod in civitate nostra, & vetabitur semper, & retinebitur. Howsoever; I can not thinke that either they would haue suffered such things to bee done at all, if they had iudged them evill: or to be performed by infamous persons, being matters of that state and magnificence, and, as they thought, of that devotion and necessitie. Thus farre your owne wordes. In which, to shew that you doe not deny without cause that the Romans ever iudged all stage-players to be infamous, you make two proofes thereof: one, that Aesopus & Roscius were not reputed as infamous persons; an other, that the Romans would not haue suffered such things to be perfourmed by infamous persons, being matters of great state & magnificence, and; as they thought, of great devotion and necessitie. Such proposition, such proofes. The proposition savouring of a strange boldnes (to vse no harder terme) that you, who scarse are fourtie yeares old, if yet fourtie, in a questiō of fact, of a thing done fifteene, sixteene, or seuenteene hundred yeares ago, which a number of witnesses, that liued the same time, men of good

credit, affirme to haue bene doon, should presume to saye, I deny that it was done. For Tullie reporteth that the Romans counting all kindes of stage-playes shamefull and dishonest, did iudge accordingly of the players. Nepos, Laberius, Livie, Iuvenall, Tacitus, the rest, whom I cited, both of the learned sort, and of the common people, doe testifie the same. Neither can you denie but their wordes alleadged by me, doe clearlie argue that they iudged thus of free players also, not onely of players for gaine. Yet you harden your face to say against them all: I denie that the Romans ever iudged all stage-players to bee infamous. Yea, for proofe hereof you produce two reasons, which imply that they thought no stageplayers infamous, no not players for gaine: and so you avouch an evident vntrueth against your owne confession, your owne conscience. For Roscius and Aesopus played for gaine: as Natur. hist. lib. 7. cap. 39 & lib. 10. cap. 51. 
               Plinie and Saturn. lib. 3. cap. 14. 
               Macrobius shew. Their wealth, which you mētion, was gottē by that trade. Now your text of D. de his qui not infam. l. 2. §. ait Praetor. 
               Ulpian with Pegasus and Nerva, sayeth that all who play for gaine, are infamous; as you confessed before; adding that you sawe no cause to mislike it, lesse durst dispute against it. Wherefore in saying that Aesopus and Roscius were not reputed as infamous persons, your owne mouth and heart cōdemne you of gain saying an vndoubted trueth. Much more when you inferre the same of other stage-players, euen of the rascalls, the most vile among them, in the reason following. For although the fame, the favour, the wealth of Roscius and Aesopus, should no more haue mooved you to washe away all staine from their credit, then from Lactant. diuin. instit lib. 1. cap. 20. 
               Flora and Athenaeus dignolophist. lib. 13. 
               Phryne, who were whoores of great fame, favour, wealth: yet their familiaritie with the best and wisest might probably perswade you, that they were not reputed as infamous persons. Howbeit, had you weighed, how Tullie. the best and wisest so wel acquainted with them, had shewed in Roscius. one of thē, that Orat. pro Q. Roscio comaed. other things brought him to such estimation, his Orat. pro P. Quintio. stage-playing was some staine vnto him: you should haue perceyued that in this respect their credit might bee tainted, notwithstanding the acquaintance, whereto, by meanes of other partes approoved in them, they grew in processe of time with the best and wisest. But your next

reason saith as much for the vilest and most beastlie stageplayers, as for Aesopus and Roscius. For in certaine playes, called Ludi Florales Ovid. Fastor. libro 5. Valer.

And can you thinke that this is a seemely thing, or tolerable, in a matter of fact, prooved by the vniforme consent of so many and so worthy witnesses, for you to contradict it with these kindes of speeches: I deny that the Romans ever iudged all stage players to be infamous; It is not to be thought that they deemed Aesopus and Roscius infamous; I can not think

that they would haue suffered their playes to be performed by men infamous?

Can you thinke your students of Christ-church, and others, with whom you haue communicated this reply of yours, to be so weak eyesighted, that they perceiue not, that your selfe, in citing & applying Tacitus his wordes touching Astrologers to the point in question, doe confute your selfe, as if God had bereft you almost of common sense, when you went about it? For if you thinke that the Romans would retaine Astrologers alwayes in their citie, yet forbid them alwayes: can you not think that they would haue suffered such things to bee done at all, if they had iudged thē evill? And if you thinke playes to be of that kinde, of which they might haue saide as Tacitus doth of Astrologers: can you thinke that they who Tacit. annal. li. 2 Vlpian. li. 7. de offic.

Then would you bee still, and quietlie acknowledge that by Tullie, Nepos, Laberius, Livie, Iuvenal, and other auncient Romans, stage-players were taken to bee infamous persons, euen all, whether they played freelie, or for gaine: and therefore not onely the hirelinges, but the free too, are comprised and noted in the Praetors wordes. Then would you rather observe in the reading of your Ad paragr. Ait Praetor. lib 2. D. de his qui not. infam.

of Iustinianus; omitting and neglecting that, in De spectac. & sceni. li. 4. the same title, whence that seelie single reason was inforced, stage-players are termed

            It may bee that your cōscience felt some pricke hereof; or at least your knowledge informed you that this would not holde water. Else, why adioyne you a new point of defense, that the actors of your playes are no stage-players? Whereas Epilo.

For whereas you denie; that you, who come on the stage once in a yeare, or two, in seauen, or in tenne, or sometime twentie yeares, are to be termed

               Maximinus, a savage Emperour, a man of a huge, tall, and strong body, tooke a most sottish and proude conceit thereof that he could not be killed. Wherevpon a certaine man said in his presence; He that can not be killed by one, is killed by many: The Elephant is great; yet is he killed: The Lion is strong; yet is hee killed: The Tyger is swift; yet is he killed: Beware of many ioyned, if single ones you feare not.
            
            The autour of this speech meant to reason thus, by way of a syllogisme: Every living creature may be killed: Maximinus the Emperour is a living creature: Therefore hee may bee killed. And least Maximinus through his proud conceit should obiect against it, that every living creature, who could be overmatched by one, might be killed; but it was impossible for any one to match him: the autour saide, that such as could not be killed by one, might by many; adding for proof thereof that Elephants, Lions, Tigers, bee they never so great, strong, and swift, are killed. Here suppose that he had withall, in hope of better perswading Maximinus, tolde him that De nat. Deor. lib. 3. 
               Tullie saith all living creatures may bee killed: which to bee true in all absolutely and simply, yea even such as no one can lightly overmatch, De offic. li. 2

Should hee haue denyed that Maximinus differed from Elephants, Lions, Tigers, in the maner of his strength, and the rest of your circumstances?

How could he? when he might haue bene controlled straight by Maximinus saying: They haue no man to their subiects: I rule the whole world; they want helpes to shield them from wounds; I weare armour: they can holde no swordes, or other weapons; I can: they are of low stature; I am eleven foote high. Should he haue graunted that because it appeareth by those and the like differences, that Maximinus was not such a living creature as those beasts were, therefore he was no living creature: nether could hee be touched either by the examples or by the autorities? That had bene to bewray either feare, or ignorance, and to betray the truth: sith the autorities reached to the thing in generall; and so the examples brought to illustrate them did touch Maximinus also by consequent. Then belike, albeit the differences, that he might alleage against the autours reason had bene true all, yet had they all bin idle; as neither disprooving the major, nor the minor, whereof the conclusion doeth necessarily follow. This is the condition and state of your differences, Mr. D. Gager; they are not all true, and they are all idle. They are not all true. Nay, is there any of them not vntrue in part? Doutlesse not the first: wherein you affirme that you differ from them altogether in furniture, & maner of setting out playes: they did it with excessiue charge: you thriftily, warily, and almost beggerly. For, I hope, as Irus came beggerly in with you; so Horace shew eth that they ought; de ar▪ te poetica: & that they had wherewt to doe it; Epist. 7. lib. 1 Vilia vendē

               widow giving two mites, gaue more then all the rest: and you in spending pence might be more excessiue then they in spending poundes. Not the second difference, touching the maner of action; whereof you say that they acted their playes in an other sort then you doe, or can or well know how: but so exquisitly and carefully, that you may seeme compared with them either for skill, or diligence, rather Recitare, which I doe not dislike, then Agere. For other sort of playing you fansie without ground, saying you know not what of thinges perfourmed you know not how: I weene you know not, neither

why they who played vnwilling and had small list to learne it; should bee more skilfull and diligent then yours: sure if yours should seeme rather recitare, which I mislike not, then agere; none of yours played in Rivalib. drunken, nor Vlyss red. daunsed, nor Scabellū jacit Antinous Act 2. hurled footestooles, nor Riv. Vlyss. red. & Hippolyt. put on wemens raiment. Not the third difference, which you set in this, that they came on the stage of a lewde, vast, dssolute, wicked, impudent, prodigall, monstrous humour; you contrarywise doe it to sundry good intents, as namely (for example) to conforme your youth to convenient action. For neither came they all with such a disposition; witnesse is Laberius, witnesses are others alleaged out of Dio; so that you speake herein as if Maximinus had said that those beasts, which the felow mentioned, are of low stature, a thing vntrue in Oppian. de venat. lib 2 Aeliā. de hist. anim. l. 12. c. 8 Lud. Verto man navigat lib. 4 cap. 10. Petr. Gillius elephanti descript cap 6. Ele phants: noris it more true that you frame your youth to convenient action, framing some of them to the action of wooers, some of knaves, some of parasites, some of clownes, some of drunkards, some of bragging souldiers, or of the like to these, then that Iul. Capitol. in Maximin. duob. Erat magnitudine tanta, ut octo pedes digito videretur egressus. 
               Maximinus was eleven foote high. Not the fourth difference, wherein (to make a farder profit of the circumstance that before you vrged against the name of stage-players) you say that they frequented the stage; you doe it seldom, sometime not in seven, ten or twenty yeares. For how doe you proove that they whom Iuvenal, Tacitus, Dio note, frequented it more then some of yours haue? and Laberius did it but once in Ego bis tricenis annis actis sine nota, Eques Ro manus è lare e gressus meo Domum revertar mimus. Macro. Saturn. lib. 2 cap. 7. three score years, who yet both called himself a stage-player for that doeing, and counted it a staine vnto him. The fifth offendeth lesse, affirming that they did it on the publike theater not of the citie onely, but of the whole world: you in a privat house, and to a few, men of vnderstanding. Yet looke by what reason you name the Roman theater, the theater of the whole worlde, your should be the theater of England, France, and Ireland, if not of whole Europe: and why say you that you did it to men of vnderstanding? as if in Rome wemen also had bene present who might behold the lusty motions of the players, and vnderstand not what they spake; At siqua forsan iuueni vellicet togā, Quid

For, touching age, among Non nobilitas cuiquam, non aetas, aut acti honores impedimento, quo minus Graeci Latiniue histrionis artem exercerent.

For you

aske of me (to sett downe your owne wordes:) Who ever would resemble our Melantho with your Laureolus? the one represented by an ingenuous boy, and for her lewdnes imagined to bee hanged within: the other acted by Lentulus, a man nobly descended, expressing perhaps openly on the stage the same punishment. What likenes is there betwene our young men, putting on the persons of Antinous, and the rest of Penelopes wooers: and betwene gentlemen of the noble race of Fabius, in their owne persons, not so much counterfeiting others, as expressing their own scurrilities? Such as our Antinous and the rest of the wooers can not be iustly charged with: no not our Irus, or Vlysses. Againe, what resemblance is there betweene our Hippodamia onely singing, Eurimachus onely saying, Phemius both singing and saying, all three represented by such as they were: and betwene Nero, playing mens, wemens, and minstrels parts vpon the stage in Rome? Beholde A marvelous case, that I should compare and resemble players together so absurdly, as no man would ever haue done besides me: and that I should affirme them to bee like one an other, betwene whom there is no likenes, no resemblance, as your sharpe vrging doeth emply. But perhaps your stomake is the more egre against my comparisons, because of our dissension about the stage and playes.

For, to passe over the ingenuousnes of the boy that represented Melantho, opposed to the noblenes of Lentulus who did act Laureolus, the vnlikenes whereof in noblenes, and acting, is disprooved already; chiefly sith Nullum simi le est idem, you know. thinges that are not the same, may bee like: first, what proofe haue you, that The gentlemen of noble houses which Dio specifieth: and

Yet are they all idle: because, as in the felowes speech to Maximinus, the maior being prooved that all living creatures may bee killed, whether one or many bee able to surprise them; the minor apparant, that hee was a living creature; the conclusion folowed, notwithstanding whatsoever differences betweene him, and them, whose examples were brought to proove the maior: likewise in my reason, the maior being prooved, that all stage-players are infamous by the civill law, whether they play for gaine, or freely; the minor apparant, that they who play your playes on the stage, are stage-players; the conclusion foloweth, notwithstanding whatsoever differences betweene yours, and them whose examples for proof of the maior I produced. Nay, I say farder, that as some true differences betwene Maximinus, and the beastes, doe sharpen the edge of the conclusion against him; for if Pli. nat. hist. lib. 8. cap. 4.

The truth is that it cannot bee applyed hereto, because L. 1.

Which Comicall sentēce, though it might be as well applied by Iustice Graybeard to the excuse of theft in poore men, as by Terences

            In the second head, to a reason drawn out of the law of God for the reproofe of stage-playes as now you handle it, denying that you made it to proove that men may lawfully put on wemens raiment therein, as I tooke it; though howe iust cause I had to take it so, I haue declared; but vnto this reason grounded on the Deut. 22. 5. law of God in Deuteronomie, Whatsoever man doeth put on womans raiment, he is abominable to the Lord; But men did put on wemens raiment in your playes; you must acknowledge therefore that you were iustly blamed: you reply in like sort as vnto the former of the civill law; first, that the prohibition of men to weare wemens rayment is not generall, but toucheth certaine cases onely; next, that your players did not weare wemens raiment. And because in treating of the prohibition I shewed out of the Scriptures, that it doeth belong not to the ceremoniall law, but to the morall; and no parte of the morall law may bee transgressed, no, not for the saving of honour, wealth, or life: my proofes hereof beeing so cleere, strong, and pregnant, that you durst not deny the thing to bee prooved, you moue a dout, as your terme is, out of wordes of mine; in deede you reason thus against it. I pray you giue mee leaue to propose my contrary dout. The morall law, as you truely say, is the law of loue and charitie; to the which wheresoever the ceremonial law is repugnant, there it giveth place to the morall. The morall law therefore is never contrarie to loue and charitie, in commanding or forbidding any thing. But the place of Deutero nomie, being taken strictly, absolutely, and in the rigor of the letter, may sometimes hinder the actions of loue and charitie, both towards our selves and others; as in those cases, which both you and I propose. Ergo in that strictnes it belongeth rather to the law ceremoniall, though the equitie thereof pertaineth to the law morall, and so it is perpetually and simply to bee observed. Nowe, I haue given you leaue to propose your contrary dout. I pray you giue me leaue to propose my contrary question. In the

same booke of Deuteronomie it is written, Deut. 5. 17. 
               Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not commit adulterie. These precepts beeing taken strictly, absolutely, and in the rigor of the letter, may sometimes hinder the actions of loue and charitie, both towardes our selves and others; as appeereth by the example of Ioseph, and of David: Ioseph, who Gen. 39. 20. lost his libertie and put his life in hazard, because verse. 12. he refused to commit adulterie with his Maisters wife; David, who 1. Sam. 26. 
                     〈◊〉
                   & 27. 2. cast his folowers and him selfe into sundry dangers and distresses, because 1. Sam. 24. 7 and 26. 9. he would not kill Saul. Herevpon I aske you, whether you thinke, that seeing the morall lawe bound Ioseph & David to Lev. 19. 18. Matt. 19. 19. Ephe. 5. 28. 
               loue their neighbours, & themselves, therefore they should haue made no scruple of adulterie and murder, in these cases, in which the forbearing thereof did hinder the actions of loue toward them selves and others: but ought to haue iudged those precepts in that strictnes to belong rather to the law ceremonial, though the equitie thereof pertaineth to the law moral, and so it is perpetually and simply to be observed. Which if you thinke not, as God forbid you should, and you will professe (as I am perswaded) that you detest such thoughts: then doe you acknowledge that it came rather of a lust to crosse and contradict my speech, then of any dout you had within your selfe, that you say, a precept, which beeing strictly kept might breede some disadvantage to our selves or others, must in this respect bee counted ceremoniall, and not be kept strictly, because the morall law is never contrarie to love and charitie in commanding or forbidding any thing. And sure you might haue reason to take it not well, if I should suppose you to be so ill catechized, as that you knew not that the moral law commandeth vs to Deut. 6.

he can not retaine therewith. Howbeit, had you doubted, yet might you haue found enough to resolue you, if you had read my writing rather with a minde to learne, then to gainesay, in as much as I shewed by Scripture touchinge Peter, that hee should not haue lyed to avoid the daunger of whatsoeuer trouble: because to lye is evill; not allowed in any case by our law-giver, no not for the defense of the glorie of God, much lesse for the safetie of man, a worme. Or, if, notwithstanding all that this could teach you, there might some occasion of doubting still remaine: should you not haue rather sought to be resolved by me in private conference, then publikelie in writing (made common with many, even in the country also, not onely in our Vniversitie) to affirme a point implying flat atheisme, that wee are no farder to keepe Gods commaundements, then standes with our commoditie? and so conclusivelie to vouch it with an Ergo, as if it did folow necessarilie, that all the lawes of God (for your reason holdeth by consequent in all) must be sett aside, like ceremoniall matters, when our owne, or other mens, honour, wealth, or life, cometh in question with them? and to adde that the equitie thereof yet pertayneth to the law moral, and so they are perpetuallie and simplie to be observed? which semeth by distinguishing their equitie from strictnes to strēgthen them in sound meaning; in deede destroyeth them by teaching their transgressors how to defend most grosse iniquitie: as idolaters, for example, when, if Dan. 3. 6. 
               Nabuchodonosor doe threaten he will burne al who worship not his golden image, they may say, that albeit in Deuteronomie God saith, 
               Deut. 5. 9. 
               Thou shalt not bowe downe to them, nor worship them, yet sith the morall law is never contrary to loue in forbidding any thing, and the place of Deuteronomie, being taken strictlie, would hinder now mens actions of love toward them selues; Ergo in that strictnes it belongeth rather to the law ceremoniall, though the equitie thereof pertaineth to the law morall, and so it is perpetuallie and simplie to be observed. A sentence so vngodlie, that when Peter onely touched it a farre off, or rather lesse then touched it, speaking of a particular case, no generall law; nor Ergoing against it, nor terming the keeping of it strictnes, nor plaistering the breach of it with equitie: but

when he tended towards it by saying to our Saviour, Matt. 16. 22 
               Maister, pitie thy selfe, this shall not bee vnto thee, our Sauiour answered him, Gett thee behind me, Satan, thou art an offense vnto me, because thou savourest not the things that are of God, but the things that are of men.
            
            Sutable to this new argument of yours is the defense of your olde (the onely one you pressed before) from two examples. For whereas you had reasoned thus, Some men of Macedonie, mooved by Prince Alexander, did putt on Wemens raiment to save the honor of Ladies; the like did Achilles, the sonne of Thetis, to save his life; Ergo it is lawfull to doe it in such cases; and I made answer thereto, that the reason is naught, because we are to live by lawes, not by exāples; neyther may we lye or forsweare our selves to save our lives, or benefitt others, though David & Peter did so, men worthier to be folowed then Macedonians, or Achilles: you reply, that the reason is good (this must you meane by saying that the examples are alleadged to good purpose in the circumstances that you apply them for, or else you delude vs with an other sophisme;) and why? For Alexanders fact is commended (say you) as proceeding from a most noble, and true heroicall minde; and because it was better that the Persian Embassadors were slaine, then that the chastities of so many great Ladies should so dishonorably be either overthrowne, or so much as assailed: and Thetis might well hide her sonne Achilles in a maidens apparell in respect of motherlie love & pitie which shee was to beare her sonne, knowing, as shee did, that hee should be slaine in that iourney to Troy, whether he was requested to accompanie the other Grecian Lords. Touching the former wherof, to admitt, that Alexanders fact proceeded from a noble true heroicall minde, and that it was better the Persian Embassadours were slaine then the chastities of so many great Ladies should so dishonorably be overthrowne, or assailed: yet doeth it not folow that men might therefore lawfullie put womens raiment on to kill them; the thing might be cōvenient and good to be done, the meanes of doeing it not good. As Satius est impunitum relinqui facinus nocentis, quàm innocentem damnari. it is better that a person guiltie should bee left vnpunished, then a person guiltlesse should be condemned: and Trajan the Emperour lib. 19. D. de poenis. he, whose saying this was, spake it

of a noble true heroicall minde. Yet were the meanes naught to procure by bribes or by false witnesses the escape or acquittall of a guiltie person: and if any man, who had vsed such dealing, should be commended for it, he should bee commended amisse in that respect, as Alexander is by you. Now, for the later, how proove you that Thetis might well hide her sonne Achilles, as shee did? You say, that you thinke not but she might doe it well. So. Your reason then is: I thinke shee might doe it well; Ergo she might. A common kinde of argument with you; but thinne, and leane: nor likely to proove better at the length in triall, of whatsoever plight it seeme in your writing. For let it fare as it may in Topickes, in Analytickes it must fast: it can not away with moode and figure. And what if you thinke not that shee might neither? as I thinke you doe not; vnlesse you thinke contraries, or speake otherwise then you thinke. For your selfe affirme, that the putting on of wemens rayment which is termed an abomination to the Lord in the place of Deuteronomie, is the wearing of it ordinarily, so to converse among men and wemen, against the course of all naturall and civill regard. But Thetis, intending thereby to hide Achilles, did clothe him to converse so ordinarily among men and wemen: even longer, then he would endure to converse so; though Statius Achilleid. li. 2. Natum ante pedes projecit. Neoptolemum. De quo Verg. Aeneid. lib. 2 Apollod. de orig. Deor. lib. 3. he endured for certaine yeares. Therefore that, which shee did, you thinke to bee abominable: yea, pronounced in Scripture an abomination to the Lorde. The lesse materiall is it whether that be true which by the way I noted, that Statius the Poet making Chiron, Calchas, and Achilles himselfe to reproove the putting of that raiment on him, meant that men of wise, vertuous, religious, ingenuous, valiant mindes, did iudge the thing simply in any case vnlawfull by the light of nature. Though I wish our iudges, vnto whose arbitrement I referre the matter, whether you controll me therein well, or no, to marke that for Chiron, in whom are represented wise and vertuous persons, albeit you affirme hee had a furder reache then his words outwardly import: yet in setting down that reache you adde, perhaps, as staggering at your owne conceit; and withall acknowledge that his words outwardly, whereof you can not proove an

other inward meaning, import as much as I said. Beside that they may iustly suspect your partiall censure, because, where I had likewise noted by the way that the fact of Achilles, deflowring Deidamia by meanes and occasion of his conversing so with her, doeth shewe what inconvenience and danger of vncleannes cleaveth to the cladding of men in wemens raiment: you doe overthwartly & wrongfully crosse my note by saying that hee was likely to doe as much in his owne likenes any where else. For let malefactours bee never so ready to practise any wickednes of their owne corrupt and lewde inclination: the circumstances of maner, season, place, and so foorth, commodious to performe it doe more entise them therevnto.

               Calvin, Marlorat, Peter Martyr. godly learned interpreters observe that her wandering and idle curiositie is noted and reprooved as an occasion of the vilanie that was done vnto her. Yet a gadding humour and wanton eye of maidens loth to folow S. Tit. 2. 5. 
               Paules rule and keepe at home, might say that such teachers are puritans, who can not abide whitson-ladies: for

               Sichem was likely to doe as much to Dina, though shee had kept at home in her fathers house, and never come in Sichems sight. The very fact in question, whereon you mislike that I made this note of such occasions and entisements, hath the same observed therein by the Statius Achilleid li. 1. Poet, the wise reporter of it: namely, that Achilles lust was first kindled by seeing Deidamia; afterwarde encreased by conversing with her; and finally accomplished by coming through the falacie of his attire, like a woman, Lex procal ire mares: iterat praecepta verendus Ductor, inaccessumque viris edicitur antrum. Nec satis est: stat fine dato metuenda sacerdos, exploratque aditus; nequis temerator ob erret Agmine faemineo: Tacitus sub

But whatsoever Statius iudged of the matter, or others shall iudge of that I noted by the way; you graunt it was abominable by the lawe of God, for Thetis to put womans raiment on her sonne Achilles, as shee did. And so you haue rather confirmed, then confuted, mine aunswere to your argument from the two examples of Macedonians and Achilles. You come in now anew with halfe a dozen more: three of men, attiring them selves in wemens raiment; three of wemen, in mens. And quoting Eucl. Mega. Theop. rex. Spar. Antenor Cepha. Euphrosyna virgo Antioch. Theod. virgo & Martyr. Eugenia Romana. their names onely in your margent, you say that if you had thought that these two examples should not haue bene taken in your meaning, that is, onely in the circumstance for the which you alleaged them, you could haue vsed many true stories of both sexes, to the which no such exceptions could haue bene taken. Wherein, to passe over, that by giving the name of true to those stories, you make it very probable that you meant Vlyss. red. resp. ad Momum. before vnder the name of stories, the fable of Achilles, as I supposed you did by the drift of your wordes, (speaking first in generall of Id quod crebra testari potest Histor.

               Achilles to proove the other) which yet you deny to haue bene your meaning, and charge mee with vntruth in effect for saying it: you doe farder charge me that I haue not taken those two examples in your meaning. No haue? Why? Meant you not by them to conclude, that a man may lawfully put on womans raiment, to saue his life, or benefite many, because in such cases Achilles and the Macedonians did put on such raiment? And haue not I expressely set this reason downe, affirming it to be your reason, and making mine aunswere accordingly thereto? yes: but I

haue also in mine aunswer to it noted other circumstances of the same examples, therby to make plainer the badnes of your reason: and so I haue not taken them in your meaning, that is (as you expound it) onely in the circumstance for the which you alleaged them. You are a mery man, and not much vnlike in this respect to one, who when hee had taken vp a waster and buckler in Cheapeside at London to play with an apprentice, & the apprentice rapped him, sometime vpon the head, sometime vpon the elbow, or shoulder, or side, hee cast them downe againe; saying, that if he had thought that the apprentice would not haue stroken vpon his buckler still, he would not haue played with him. Yet in this you vary from the vaine of his speech, that you say you could haue vsed many true stories of both sexes, to the which no such exceptions could haue bene taken. Though you helpe your selfe no more by this varying, then if his skill had served him to haue warded all the blowes with his buckler; his weaknes being neverthelesse vnable to resist, but that he might haue had his buckler beaten about his eares. For what if no such exceptions could be taken against your six examples? Doeth not the same aunswer that I made to your reason from the Macedonians example, and Achilles, beate downe these also to the ground: sith none of them is equall to David, or to Peter, whose actions notwithstanding are no sufficient warrants for vs? Moreover, as in beheading of noble personages, that are traitours, the executioner, having cutt of their heads, doeth hold them vp in his handes, & shew them to the people: so I, having thus beheaded, as it were, these your six examples, I meane, the reason drawne from them, perhaps (notwithstanding your confident assertion that no such exceptions can bee taken against them) might hold them vp in my handes, and shew that they are dead, by the like or more absurd consequutions from other circumstances thereof. For example, in one or two, the chiefest of them, the first of eche sexe, Euclides, and Euphrosyna; the storie of Euclides is, that when the A.

               Athenians, hauing their neighbours of Megara in great hatred, had decreed that if any of the men of that citie were found within Athenes, he should suffer death: Euclides being of it, and loth

to lose the benefit of the schoole of Socrates, with whom hee vsed to be at Athenes and to heare him, before that law was made, did cloth himselfe in womans attire towardes evening; went from his house in Megara to Athenes, vnto Socrates; enioyed his speech and conference some parte of the night time; and when day approched, returned home againe a litle more then twentie miles in the same attire.
            Now, if this were lawfully done, because he did it: then Matt. Paris. hist. Ang. in Ricardo pri.

In like sort, touching Euphrosyna, a maide of Alexandria, (of Antioche 
               Euphrosyna virgo Antioch you name her, by slippe of penne or memorie) the storie is, that Sim Metaphrast. vit. S. Euphrosynes Alexandr. apud Surium, de probat. Sanct. histor.

               her name in deede was Smaragdus, and she was of the Emperours Court, and came to that Abbay to leade a holy life, if she might be admitted; and so finding fauour to be admitted as a man, she liued there Triginta &

a better proofe, I grant, then, Achilles did it, or Mocedonians did it, because they were profane men, Martyrolog. Roman. Ianuar. 1. Graecor. menolog Caes. Baron. notationib. in martyrolog. Roman. 
               Euphrosyna is a Saint; but as you reason thus: likewise may an other in the same moode and figure; Euphrosyna, through a desire of moonkish perfection, refused to honour her father; Ergo 
               Mark. 7. 9. 
               Christ did wrongfully checke the Scribes and Pharises for breaking Gods commandements to keepe traditions of men: Euphrosyna chose rather to be with others then with him to whom she was betrothed; Ergo Moses erred in teaching that a

               verse. 24.

               Iohn was a precisian, who condemneth all lyes: Euphrosyna conuersed in mens apparell, amongst men, eight and thirty yeares; Ergo D. Gager mistooke the place of Deuteronomie, when he gaue it this meaning, that to goe attired so ordinarily is abomination to the Lord. See you now what maner if true stories, of true all, you could haue vsed of both sexes? and how bold you were in saying that no such exceptions could be taken to them, as to the former? The which notwithstanding, were it as you say, you doe no more helpe your argument thereby, then if a traitour being beheaded, whom you favoured, you staied the executioner from holding vp his head, and sowed it on againe your selfe to his body with close and hansom stitches. For although no such exceptions could be taken to any of your examples, yet had I beheaded with the Heb. 4. 13. 
               the swoord of Gods woord the reason drawne from them: and with Iustinians swoord too, in that I adioyned for your sake out of your law, that we are to liue by lawes, not by examples: and to

               looke, not so much what is done any where, as what ought to be done.
            
            Hereunto you adde an other new argument to shew that the place of Deuteronomie toucheth certaine cases onely, not generally forbiddeth a man to put on womans raiment: and that is, the opinion and iudgement of Diuines. For after you had deliuered these expositions of it, as liked by your selfe, that to weare such raiment of a lewde intent, the rather thereby, & the more safely to be in the company of wemen to bring some bad purpose about; or of an effeminate minde to suffer his heare to grow

long, or to frizell it; or in speech, colour, gate, gesture, and behaviour to become womanish; or ordinarily so to conuerse among men and wemen, against the course of all naturall, and civill regard, is abomination to the Lord: and noted it moreover to be expounded by other thus, that wemen are forbidden to put on the armour of men, and men the raiment of wemen, because at that time it was superstitious, in as much as among the Gentiles wemen woare mens armour in the sacrifices of Mars, and men woare wemens ornaments and instruments, as distaffe, spindell, and such like, in the sacrifices of Venus; and therefore is it added that he who doth so is abominable to God because abomination is taken in the Scriptures commonly for idolatrie, or some thing belonging to idolatrie: but after you had sett downe these expositions, you say that all the Divines whom ever you talked with of this matter, doe affirme the true meaning of that place to be conteined in these senses rehearsed. Wherein by alleaging the consent of all Diuines that euer you talked with hereof, as making for you, first, you grant your self never to haue talked here of with S. Cyprian, Chrysostome, Procopius, Thomas Aquinas, Liranus, Calvin, Hyperius, Beza, Bishop Babingtō; who making it a point annexed (as I shewed) to the seventh commandemēt, doe imply the meaning therof to be larger then your rehearsed senses: neuer with Strom. lib. 2

               Austin, the Bishops assembled in the sixth generall councell to the number of aboue two hundred and twenty: who partly by vrging that place against stage-players partly by condemning the thing it speaketh of, as lewde, doe evidently argue that they are of a different minde from you concerning it. Or sith you hauing had the most of these quoted in my letters to you, doe grant, for Cyprian namely & the generall concel, that they make against you, & therfore seeme, in citing all that euer you talked with; to meane not such as you haue read and perused, but whom you haue asked thereof by woord of mouth: then, why should you more enforce against

mee the sayings and iudgment of all that euer you talked with, then I against you the sayings and iudgements of all that euer I talked with? For as you report of them whom you talked with that they are very godly and excellently learned: in like sorte may I of them whom I talked with. And of mine you can not but the rather beleeue me, because I named you one, of whom your selfe answer, that you esteeme him to be a good man, a good scholer, and a good Preacher: you name me none of yours. Againe, there hath not any of yours in publike place, where men doe speake with greater advise to Christian auditories, avouched that which you hold: he, whom you commend, and commend iustly, hath preached the same that I teach. But, you say, he could not iustifie his speech, vttered so publikely, if it should come to due triall. But, I say, this speech of yours so publikely vttered is come to due triall, and you can not iustifie it. For he, hauing opened the woords of his text, Psal. 119. 10 
               Let me not wander from thy commandements, & begonne to shew what a cōtrary course vnto the Prophets practise we take now a daies, did prosequute it thus. To lett passe other things, let stage-playes in the Vniuersitie, and Maygames in the towne, speake whether these things be so. In 
               Deut. 22. 5. 
               Deuteronomie the precept is, The woman shall not put on mans raiment, nether shall a man putt on womans raiment; for all that doe so are abomination to the Lord: And it is the 
               1. The. 5. 22 
               Apostles precept to abstaine from all appearance of evill. Whether the former precept be broken in all playes, I know not. Sure very few or none there are, wherein either the one, or both, is not broken: either through the vile scurrilitie of the matter oftentimes vnbeseeming chast eares; or thorough the time for the preparing for them; or through the vnnecessarie charges about them; or through the manifold daungers comming both to actors, and spectators, by them. Herevpon, having added somewhat touching maygames, he made this exhortation. The Prophet prayeth vnto the Lorde, that hee may not wander from his commandementes. His action ought to be thine instruction: and art thou so farre from folowing him that thou treadest his law vnder thy feete, and castest his wordes behinde thee? Take heede, feare, and tremble; thou hast not to deale with

man, but with God: who hath left thee his law, not to dally withall, or cunningly to deceve thy selfe with thine owne glosses vpon the same, but to bee the witnesse of his will, and rule of thy life. This is the same speech, and all, that hee did vtter so publikely hereof; set downe in writing by him selfe before hee vttered it: a speech, that in this present triall betweene vs is already iustified, and shall bee declared farder to be 1. Cor. 3. 12 
               gold, silver, pretious stones, in the day of great triall. So shall the same doctrine delivered by S. Cyprian, the sixth generall councel, and other worthy men: when of the contrary side your wood, hay, stubble, shal be consumed by fire. In the meane season your self doe lay open your own corrupt affections, & blaze your own shame sundry wayes. One, in that you say, that you trust you shall not seeme to any man to wrong S. Cyprian & the rest, if you folow the opiniō of others both very godly & excellentlie learned, who do interpret that text of Deuter. otherwise then hee, or they doe: specially in a case that toucheth you so neere, wherin you are to defende your selfe and many your good frends from the reproch of open infamie. For you speake therein, as if the question beeing of an other text, Deut. 23. 19 
               Thou shalt not giue to vsurie vnto thy brother, 
               
                  D. Wilsons discourse vpō vsurie. which some newer writers expound against vnmercifull and cutting vsurie, as they terme it; not against all vsurie, as Austin with a number of ancient Fathers doeth; an vsurer should saye: I trust I shall not seeme to any man to wrong S. Austin and the rest, if I folow the opinion of others, both very godly and excellenly learned, who doe expound that text otherwise then hee, or they doe; specially in a case that toucheth mee so neere, wherin I am to defend my selfe, and many my good frendes, from great discredit and discommoditie. An other, in that you adde, that you well wote it litle becommeth you to say, Da veniam Cypriane. In deede, for my selfe, whom in this you glance at, I must confesse I thought that it did become Praefat. thes. de sacr. scrip. and eccles. me to saye, Da veniam Cypriane, vpon the circumstances that I said it: which, if it were a fault, though D. 
               His answere to the preface of Gre. Mar. discovery, sect. 15. 
               Fulke thought otherwise, but if it were, it was of errour; and I will recant it, if you confute the Set down in the end of my conference wt Hart: in the Defence of such things as Tho. Stapleton, & Gregorie Martin haue carped at in my Theses. reasons that mooved me to thinke it did become mee so to say. But you, who wote well (by your owne confession)

               it litle becommeth you to say, Da veniam Cypriane, doe thereby acknowledge, that although you are perswaded, as you pretend, the proper naturall sense of the worde of God to bee on your side, not on Cyprians; in trueth you are not so. For else you would thinke that it should become you very well to say, Pardon mee, O Cyprian: sith you know, I hope, that it became the Apostles very well to say, Act. 5. 29. 
               Wee ought rather to obey God then men. And if it doe litle become you to saye, Pardon mee, O Cyprian, when yet you dissent from him and contradict him: then you glozed in saying that with all humblenesse you reverence his autoritie; seeing, to craue Quod divinarum Scripturarum autoritati congruit in literis Cypriani, cū laude eius accipio: quod autem non cōgruit, cum pace eius respuo. August. cont. Cresco. gramma. lib. 2 cap. 32. 
               leaue and pardon, in dissenting, is a signe of reverence. And if to vse so milde words, Pardon mee, O Cyprian, it become you litle: how much lesse, to say, as in effect you doe, Maledicta textum glossa quae vitiat bonū. Vlyss. red. resp. ad Mom. 
               It is a cursed glosse, O Cyprian, which thou makest? And if vnto Cyprian alone it litle becommeth you to say so much: how greatly vnbeseeming is it for you to say it vnto such a number, both of olde, & new interpreters, besides him? Finally, for an vpshoote, where you say that he, as a godly man, was caried with a vehement & a perfit hatred against the detestable abuses of the heathen spectacles in his time: you graunt that the spectacles of playes sett foorth by you haue detestable abuses in them; sith the Cothurnus est tragicus prisca facinora carmine recensere: de parricidis & incestis horror antiquus, expressa ad imaginē veritatis actione, replicatur Cypr. epist. 2 ad Donat. 
               tragedies, the playing whereof he detesteth, are such as your Ulysses; the Vt ad scenae sales inverecundos transitum faciam, pudet referre quae dicuntur pudet etiam accusare quae fiunt: agentium strophas, adulterorum fallacias, mulierum impudicitias, scurriles iocos, parasitos sordidos; ipsos quoque patres familiâs togatos, modo stupidos, modò obscoenos, in omnibus stolidos, certis nominibus inverecundos. Cyprian. de spectac. cap. 5. 
               Comedies, as your Rivales: and so, how litle care you haue of being godly, who are not only not caried with an hatred, I say not, with a vehemēt & perfit hatred, against them, but also dote vpon them, & write defenses of thē, I iudge you not, your own mouth iudgeth you. As for those godly and learned Divines, who being talked withall by you touching the true sense of the place of Deuteronomie, did make that answer which you mention: what if they, misliking your resolute intent, did folow the example of Michaeas the Prophet? 
               1. King. 22. 15. who being asked by king Achab wheher he should go against Ramoth Gilead to battell, or leaue off; did answer him, Go vp, & prosper; & the Lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king. What if in a meriment, knowing why you asked it, they spake vnto you, as Cassellius a lawier vnto a certaine Roman?
               
               Macrob. Saturn lib. 2. cap. 6. Of whom, when Uatinius having had stones throwne at him by the people, to whom he was odious, did purpose to set forth a spectacle of fensers, and had gotten the magistrates to make proclamation that no man should cast ought into the place of spectacles saving an apple onely; Cascellius beeing asked, whether a pine apple were an apple, If thou meane to hurle it at Vatianus, it is, quoth he. What if you mistooke the summe of their answer, or a worde therein? they telling you perhaps that the true meaning of the place of Deuteronomie doeth containe those senses which are rehearsed by you; and you misconstruing them as if they had said that the true meaning thereof is contained in those senses rehearsed, and so may in no case bee extended farder. Of which three coniectures (you force me to divine of them, and betweene them, because you would not name the parties whom you cite, that by them selves I might learne what they said, and why,) the last in my opinion seemeth most probable: considering it is likely that godly learned men would looke what had bene written vpon the place by interpreters; and the interpreters, whose wordes, even translated by you in a maner, are an evident token what your Divines tolde you, doe specifie those thinges as meant, in such sort, that they deny not but more might bee meant; yea most of them affirme the generall to be meant also. For, of five particulars (so many you set down) Strabus, the autour of the ordinarie Glosse, hath two: namely that a man 
               Mulieris naturaliter diversus est color, motus, incessus, vires 
               must not become womanish in colour, gate, and so foorth; nor Comam crispare, torquere capillos: vndeApostolus, vir si comam nutrierit, ignominia est. illi. 
               suffer his heare to grow long, or frizill it. The other three, that hee may not put on womans raiment, 
               Posset intrare vir ad mulierē sub habitu muliebri 
               thereby the more safely to be in wemens company, to bring about some bad purpose; nor 
               Quas natura sexu discreverat, discernat & vestitus. 
               ordinarily so to converse among men and wemen, against the course of naturall & ciuill regard; nor 
               In sacris Veneris viri effaeminabantur. Or, as Liranus speaketh, whose wordes you expresse, portabant ornamenta & instrumēta mulierū, vtpote colum, fusum & similia. 
               to be womanlike in the sacrifices of Uenus: these hath Gulielmus Alvernus, Bishop of Parise, and Carthusianus after him; Aquinas, and Liranus too, the last of them. Now Strabus saith not that those two thinges alone are meant: the rest doe say that so much more is meant then the other three, as prooveth my assertion. For the Guliel. Pari. de fide & legib. cap. 13. Bishop of Parise, cited and abbridged by Dionysius Carthusianus, among sundry causes why the lawe of

God should forbid a man to put on womans raiment, giveth this for one, Vt occasio magna provocationi libidinis auferretur. 
               that a great occasion of provoking men to lust might be taken away. For 
               Magna provocatio libidinis viris est vestitus muliebris. 
               the apparell of wemen (saith he) is a great provocation of men to lust and leacherie: because a 
               Vestis muliebris viro circundata vehementer refricat memoriam & commovet imaginationem mulieris. 
               womans garment beeing put on a man doeth vehemently touch and moue him with the remembrance & imagination of a woman; and

               Prohibetur hîc talis vsus, vel potius abusus, quia est occasio libidinis. 
               then is such an vse or rather abuse forbidden, because it is an occasion of wantonnes and lust. Wherein he hath relation to that, whereas the Heb. CEL

But seeing it appeareth not by sufficient proofe that wemen woare mens armour in the sacrifices of Mars, or men woare wemens distaffes, spindles, and such like, in the sacrifices of Uenus; and the later branch of the law forbidding a man to put on womans 
               
                  Heb. SIMLAH. 
               raiment, doeth shew that common apparell is meant in the former, as S. Hierome also in the vulgar

extendeth farder then your specialties, & most of them affirme it: I feare it were a fault in me to beleeve you, that godly learned Divines, with whom you talked thereof, should all avouch vnto you the thing you father on them. Howbeit, if they did, and you will needes enforce their testimonie against me; mine aunswer made to Cyprian, to them I must apply: The law forbidding men to put on wemens raiment, saith that all who doe so are abomination to the Lorde. What? And haue godly learned Divines said otherwise? Pardon me, ye godly & learned Divines; I would beleeve you gladly, but that beleeving you I should not beleeve the word of God. And I assure my selfe so much of their modestie, that though you, with The preface of his discoverie.

                  , Chrys. homil. 4. de Lazaro. the sacred anker, as they terme it, which is, the generalitie of the lawe it selfe, pronouncing all abominable who change their raiment so, betake your selfe at the last to this desperate refuge, that though the proposition be a generall affirmatiue, All men are abomination who put on womans apparell, yet in your cases it suffereth exception. I call this refuge desperat, because your owne handling thereof doeth seeme to argue, that when you came vnto it, you did treade on thornes; and felt that you should bee pitifully pricked, if you stoode long vpon it. For when, vnto the rules of law which I cited, that every speciall is suspended when the generall is suspended, and hee who forbiddeth the generall will not haue the speciall practised, you had replied that these rules are to bee vnderstoode of those generals that absolutely command, and necessarily comprehend their specials sub potestate sua, not those which must endure controlment as it were, & suffer exceptions to restraine their power; you giue this reason of it: For generall propositions, both in Divinitie, and Law, doe vsually

admitt particular exceptions and limitations, quae derogant generalitati: of which sort this proposition, that we haue in hand, is; as there are many mo of like nature, which you could alleage (you say) to illustrate these rules, but that they are plaine to me, and you are weary already, and haue a great way yet to goe, and feare that I am starke tyred with your tedious discourse. It is recorded by Appian. de bellis Parth. Plutarch. vita Crassi. historians that the Parthians vsed to flye frō their enemies, & withal to strike thē with arrows shot backward. Whervpō

Only you differ frō them, in that you shoote no arrowes while you are flying away; which else I might be afraid of, as Carm. lib. 2. od. 13. 
               Horace saith their Miles sagittas & celerē fugā Parthi. 
               souldiers were. For your axiome vrged in maner of a proofe, that generall propositions both in Divinitie, and Law, doe vsually admitt particular exceptions; prooveth iust nothing: vnlesse peradventure you thinke that in good Logicke this argument will hold: Some generall propositions, for the word vsually betokeneth some not all; some therfore doe admit particular exceptions; Ergo the proposition we haue in hande doeth so. A shaft so vnshapen without head or feather, that although the stele, I meane the antecedēt therof, be wel wrought, & many examples might you alleage to illustrate it, if need were: yet your self durst not as much as make a shew of nocking, and drawing it, to shoote it of with an Ergo. But I of the contrary side will so encounter this devise of yours, that there shall no more life be left therein, then there was in 1 Kin. 22. 35 
               Achab the evening after he was wounded. And that by meanes of this argument. No particular exception is good against a generall proposition in Divinitie, saue onely such as Scripture maketh and warranteth. But your asseveration, that men may put on wemens raiment in stage-playes, is a particular exception not warranted by Scripture, against the generall proposition that all who doe so are abominable. Therefore mens wearing of wemens raiment on stages can not bee good in Divinitie.
               
The major of which syllogisme the Lawe (to goe no farder) matched with Divinitie by your selfe in this case of rules and limitations, propositions & exceptions, wil approove vnto you. For if against a generall rule and proposition, as for example sake, that D. de iust. & iure. lib. 10. Cic. de Offic. lib 1. 
               right ought alwayes to bee done, a man of 
               Cic. de Offi. lib. 3. Sueto. Iulio Caes. cap. 30. 
               Caesars minde should by way of exception and limitation say, that it ought in deede, save when a kingdome may bee gotten by doeing injurie and wrong: must wee allow this exception? No. And why? Because it is not warranted by any text of Lawe. Hence is it that In si. 11. D. de in ius vocando. 
               Bartolus, and Glossa communis after him, affirming absolutely that where the law distinguisheth not, we may not distinguish, doe shew that they meane this, not of any one lawe, but of the whole body, to weete, that Vbi lex non distinguit, nos non debemus distinguere, nisi illa lex distinguatur per aliam. 
               wee may not distinguish vpon a law, vnlesse that law by some other law be so distinguished. Likewise, in Divinitie, if against the doctrine of Psal 106. 3. 
               doeing righteousnes at all times (to presse the same example) a woman like 1. Kin. 21. 8. 
               Iezabel, or men like the Elders and Governours, whom shee wrote to, should say that generall rules may admitt exceptions, and righteousnes is requisit to be done at all times, save when land may bee gotten by suborning false witnesses, or a king pleased by shedding innocent blood: this might be very iustly called a Maledicta textum glossa quae vitiat bonum. 
               cursed glosse, because the Scripture doeth not teach in any place that it is lawfull to doe evill for advantage, or gratifying of Princes. Neither could the 2. Tim. 3. 17 
               Apostle rightly praise the Scripture, as serving to furnish a man of God perfitly vnto all good workes, if a worke therein commanded or forbidden generallie, as good or naught, were contrariwise abominable or allowable in particulars not declared by Scripture. Which mooved S. Austin, among lessons given for the right expounding therof, to make this one, that De doctr. Christ. lib. 3. cap 28. 
               doutfull points of Scripture ought to be cleared by the Scripture it selfe, because 
               lib. 2. cap. 9 
               all such thinges as touch faith and maners are sett downe plainly in the Scripture. True it is therefore that no particular exception, in Divinitie, may be admitted against a generall proposition, vnlesse the Scripture warrant it: which was the first parte of my syllogisme. The next, that your assertion touching mens wearing of wemens raiment in stage-playes, is a particular exception not warranted

by Scripture against a generall proposition: must needes be graunted also. Specially by you: who, having talked therof with Divines, both many, and excellently learned, perceaue that none of them could bring foorth any warrant out of Scripture for it. Wherefore, the conclusion, against your stage-play-wemen, may cause both them and you to dye your faces with that colour, which a Diog. Laērt. in Diogene. Philosopher termed well 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . 
               the colour of vertue: and I pray God it doe.
            So the commandement, that a man shall not put on womans raiment, being prooved to reach vnto all in generall, even such, as for the saving of honour, wealth, or life, doe it, much more whom nothing moveth thereto but a playing humour: it foloweth to be sifted whether there bee truth and weight in that you adde, that your players did not weare wemens raiment. A thing avouched by you in like sort almost, as if 1 Kin. 22. 34 
               Achab being wounded to death with an arrow sticking in his side, should haue said, I am not hurt. But this, which, if hee had brought reason to perswade men, he might haue seemed desirous to bee madde with reason, you labour to confirme, saying that you may not in deede be said at all to weare wemens apparell, because wearing implieth a custome and a common vse of so doing: whereas you doe it for an hower, or two, or three, to represent an others person, by one that is openly knowne to be as hee is in deede. For aunswer wherevnto, first, passing over your idle addition concerning the To represent an others person. ende and By one yt is opēly known to be as he is in deede. circumstance of your vsing it; which I terme idle, beecause if men should vse it still to whatsoever ende, and openly knowne to be the same they are, as 
               Suet. in Ner. cap. 28. 
               Sporus was, they may indeede bee said to weare it, you will graunt: but first if it be onely for an hower, or two, or three, that you doe it; where are your wemen dressed? by whom? at what time? all at the same moment they come vpon the stage? and hath none bene dressed at noone, to play at night? and hath it not bene towards midnight, ere some playes ended? Next, if it be true, that wearing implieth a custome and a common vse of so doeing: then belike it may not be said that Nero the Emperour did ever weare any garment. For Nullam vestem bis induit. 
               hee did never put on any garment twise, as Nero. ca. 30 
               Suetonius writeth: and therefore had no custome and common

vse of any. Furthermore, suppose that you might not bee said to weare wemens apparell; yet are you not the neerer to that which you intend: sith the Scripture saith, that a man shall not put on womans raiment, and you doe put it on (I trow) when you play, whether you weare it, or no. Finally, the Prophets 
               Heb. jilbosch
                word, betokening this in the originall text, is the very same with that whereby 1 Sam. 17. 38 
               the armour of Saul is described to haue bene put on David. Now if David who put off Sauls armour by and by, within halfe an howre, a quarter, or lesse much; yet had it put on, after the phrase of Scripture: may it not be said, that they, who went in wemens raiment certaine howres, did that which Scripture speaketh of, English it as you list, put on, or weare such raiment? Alas, Quam miserum est id negare nō posse quod sit turpissimum cō
                  fiteri? 
               in how miserable plight is he, saith Phillipp. 2. 
               Tullie, who can not deny that, which to confesse it is most shamefull? I, with a litle change of his sentence, must lament your case, who dare not confesse that which to deny it is most shamefull. For how many hundreds are there of eye-witnesses, that your Euryclea, Melantho, Penelope, Phoedra, Nais, others, did weare wemens raiment? Howe many did obserue, and with mislike haue mentioned, that Penelopes maides did not onely weare it, but also sate in it among true wemen in deed, longer then David woare Sauls armour? neither were more knowne to them to bee men, then Achilles was at firste to Deidamia; vntill they suspected it, seeing them entreated by the wooers to rise and danse vpon the stage. I wish there had not bene so bad a token to convince you; nor so many beholders to testifie thereof: though I am glad withall that they had such mislike of the thing testified. And this commoditie by it besides, that I might feare else, least you, who did before deny that men playing on your stage, are stage-players; and doe deny here that the players of wemens partes weare wemens raiment; would at length deny that you had any playes at all; and so accuse me of slaundering your friendes for being on the stage, when they were in their studies.

imitate and resemble wantonnes, scurrilitie, impudēcie, drunkennes, or any other misbehaviour, is a thing vnlawfull: But sundry misbehaviours were imitated and resembled by Penelopes wooers, her maides, Rivales, mariners, Phaedra, the Nurse, the Nymph, and others in the playing of your tragedies and comedie: The playing therefore of them is to bee misliked. Whereagainst you say not much for the maior. Onely, for as much as I, beside a number both of divine autorities, and humane, avouching it, alleaged your owne consent too, in that you affirme that Virile non est faeminae mores sequi. 
               it beseemeth not men to folow wemens maners: you say your meaning was, that it doth not beseeme them to folow wemens maners in the common course of life, to the perverting of the law of nature, honestie, and comelines; or for any evill purpose; yet a boy, by way of representation onely, may, not indecently, imitate may denlie or womanlie demeanour. Which aunswer though it seemeth to deny your approoving of my reproofe in part, about young mens imitating of the maners of wemen: yet the greatest part thereof doeth it approoue. For I founde most fault with imitating the manners of strumpets and bawdes, Melantho, Phaedra, the Nurse: and, I trust, you will not say that the demeanour of such vnmaidenly maidens, & vnwemenly wemen, is either maidenly or womanly. But whatsoever you say touching your owne sentence, and after your common course of distinguishing interpret it as meant in the common course of life, to the perverting of the law of nature, honestie and comelines, or for any evill purpose: it sufficeth mee, that you durst not apply these distinctions to the Scriptures, Fathers, or forein writers, by which I confirmed the major of mine argument and you acknowledge it to be truly confirmed. The minor is the hedge, whereat, as the lowest, you were in hope that you might leape over with lesse difficultie. And in this confidence you aske What proportion there is betweene those thinges, which I enlarge in my maior; and those thinges which in particular application against you, are vsed in my minor? To the which question I will make no aunswer, till you haue considered and tolde me what proportion there is betwene an Elephant, and Maximinus the Emperour. But the minor of mine argument, whereto I must

holde you, and not giue you leaue thus to runne at riott vpon every wandring conceit of proportions; the minor of mine argument, I say, is most certaine, & true, in every branch thereof. Though neither is your cunning and arte, by the way, to bee passed over, that wheras I having in generall disclosed the hurt of amatorie dansing, did note in particular your wooers dansing with their minions: you reply that they dansed onely two solemne measures, without any lighter galliard; and herevpon you aske me, What Herod could be inflamed? What Propertius ravished? what flame of lust kindled thereby in mens heartes? what wounds of loue imprinted? whose senses could bee moved, or affections delited more then ought to bee, or may honestly bee? What enemies of chastitie made by this sight? what strong or constant heart vanquished; nay, what reede shaken thereby? What so much as flaxe or towe sett on fire? Great crye, and litle wooll: as who say that I had applied all these things to dansing alone; and not diverse of them to amatorie kissing, amatorie embracing, and amatorie pangs expressed in most effectuall sort, togither with it. Or, as who saye farther, that none could be touched with anie sparke of lust by seeing the supposed gentlewemen danse so small a time, so grauelie with galant lustie yoonkers; because you, a marvellous indifferent iudge, & well seene in thinges of this qualitie, doe pronounce that none could.

               Who knoweth not that Fortune is of great force both wayes, either to prosperitie, or to adversitie? forsooth, saieth hee, I know it not. In like sort they whose iudgement herein is so much sounder, lesse daseled with affection and preiudice, then yours, as in matters touching God and true Religion, Lactantius was then Tullies, may answer your demaundes, that manie Herods might be inflamed, many a Propertius ravished thereby. For your partialitie and weaknes of sight doeth bewray it selfe, in that, where I had noted how your new Nymph, by liuely expressing of amorous panges, brought fewell enough to heate & melt a hart of yce or snow: you reply, that shee hath bene woorse reported of to me a great deale, then shee did deserue, as I and the

world shall one day see. Now shee was so reported of to mee by Lactantius, I meane, a man whose woord I offer you no wrong if I beleeue before yours; a man, that deserueth to be as well esteemed of, as he, for sundrie causes, & for some, better, a man, who did report it, not of surmise, but of knowledge; not of heare-say, but of sight; not of that which might be, but which had hapned in senses and affections mooved and tickled with it. And the thing which the world and I should one day see, whereby your meaning shewed in the wordes ensuing, is, that shee did profer honest, lawfull, vertuous, mariage-meaning love, as Panniculus Hippolyto Se necae tragaediae assutus Append Meleagr. her speech committed now to print declareth; doeth not proove that he reported worse a great deale to me of her expressing those panges, then shee deserved.

               Bacchus and Ariadne, can not shake a reed, much lesse surprise or wound a strong and constant heart: hee might seeme vnwoorthie to be talked withall by men of ingenuous modestie and iudgement. Wherefore sith the profer of nothing else but honest and mariage-meaning love, made in woords only by a hansom boy apparelled like a woman did ravish a Propertius, and inflame an Herode; notwithstanding you thought that it could not possibly worke anie such effect, as I and the world also should perceive: your thicke interrogations wherewith you come vpon mee, as with so manie foines and prickes of a sword, to make me yeelde that youthes attired in wemens raiment, & dansing a few solemne measures like 
               Salust. conjurat. Cai. 
               Sempronia, can not set flaxe on fire; in shewe they doe brave it, as if no way but one; in deed they draw not so much blood, as a needle would. But be it as be may, for the forcible operation and working of the poyson, which neither I affirmed to be altogether so quicke in every branch of the minor, concerning your players, as in some alleadged for proofe of the maior; nor doe you rightlie iudge of, who acknowledging it to be as poyson in the major for bad effectes of such playes, would haue it

triacle in the minor for good effectes of yours: the minor of mine argument, as I saide, is certaine and true in euery braunch thereof. One alone, amongst all that I specified, you take exception at; which is the Nymphes part. And therein I mistooke a circumstance, I graunt. How be it I must tell you withall that I mistooke it so, and such a circumstance, that the righting of it doth not onely not diminish the certaintie and truth of my minor, but rather much encreaseth it. For when the graue and godly man, whom I spake of, had shewed me his mislike of amorousnes and drunkēnes expressed in your playes; and namely, for the former, had noted the mischief of the representing those pangs so effectually by the Nymph, a new part inserted into Seneca: I not being farder inquisitiue thereof, did thinke that you supposing the person of a bawde was not set foorth lively and skilfully enough by Seneca in Phaedras Nurse, had brought in a Nymph to perswade Hippolytus that which the Nurse could not; and therevpon I mentioned the Nurses and the Nymphes bawderie. Nowe, by your publishing of that which you inserted, I perceave you added a new bawd in deed, but a man bawde, Pandarus; and gaue the Nymph an other part almost as shamefull: so that, I confesse, I was, through some negligence, doubly overseene; first, in naming Titius, or rather Titia, for Seius; againe, in imagining one naughty part added by you vnto Seneca, whereas you added two. For, whatsoever you say of your Nymphes wooing and profer to Hippolytus: S.

A thing, from allowing whereof hee was so farre; much more from terming them tetrica ingenia & ab omnibus Gratiis aliena, who doe disallow it; though you, not contented

               proud, a cruell, a barbarous savage man? to banne him? to curse him? to wishe him the most horrible kind of death that might be? and all because he would not leave his lawfull libertie to satisfie her lust? Or would your Erasmus haue reprooved me as Quid facias istis ingeniis tetricis, & ab omnibus gratiis alienis? rigorous, to say no more, for blaming this in a maiden; and him selfe haue liked it, Christ. matrim institut. who misliked in men that they faine and spread lewde reportes of such as yeeld not to their wooing? Truelie, for mine owne part, albeit Nais had not transgressed anie dutie with so fowle language, and might without impeachment of maidenly modestie, haue sued to be Hippolytus bedfellow: yet should I haue thought it a thing vnbeseeming a youth of tender yeares to be inured, and taught, how hee may by amorous speeches, lookes, and gestures, wooe for a husband, or a wife. But seeing she did that which can not be cleered of wantonnes and scurrilitie: my minor (notwithstanding the circumstance I mistook) is most true and certame for the branch concerning her. Yea, it is as certaine and true, with alteration of the name only, even for the very crime too wherewith I charged her in steede of her brother Pandarus: that is to say, for bawderie. Which worde why you should censure by terming it the brode name of bawderie, I know not: sith the Latin wordes, leno, and lena, haue none in our English correspondent to them (for ought that I know) but a bawde; and lenocinium, bawderie. How commeth it to passe then that my vse of the English name should be faultie: where Pannic.

that I should haue spoken broder, so to terme it, and vsed wordes of greater eagernes and sharpnes. For his practise is bawderie, who entiseth any to single fornication. What is it farther to adulterie? What farther yet, to incest? And to doe this simply, as incestuous 2 Sā. 13. 11. Amnon did, were abominable.

               Pandarus? My speech was too minsing, when I named bawderie. If I had termed it most filthy beastly bawderie, my wordes had bene broder, though not brode enough yet. But to returne to mine argument, the maior and the minor beeing thus confirmed, the conclusion foloweth necessarily, and should haue bene graunted by you in my iudgement.
            So many heads, so many wittes: your fansie lead you an other way. And therefore, according to the young Scholers axiome, that alwayes when both the praemisses are true, the conclusion must be denied: You deny that the playing of your tragedies and comedie is to bee misliked and censured as vnlawfull. To the fine perswading whereof you take advantage by somewhat that I said: and the point of my sworde, which pearceth through the heart of your defense of playes, you striue (though in vaine, for want of strength) to draw out, and turne against my selfe. For, because I amplified the vnlawfulnes of the thing by the inconvenience and hurt which it breedeth, principally to the actors, in whom the earnest care of liuely representing the lewde demeanour of bad persons doeth worke a great impression of waxing like vnto them; next, to the spectators, whose maners are corrupted by seeing and hearing such matters so expressed: you encounter mee herein with two disputes; one, that neither the spectators of your playes, nor the actors, could receve any hurt thereby; an other, that no evill affections could bee stirred vp thereby, but rather good. Which points it is a worlde to see how you struggle to proove by shewes of reason; and it will not fadge. Besides, were they prooved: my conclusion standeth neverthelesse entier, because neither of them doeth touch a heare of the praemisses. The shewes of reason firste, wherby you would proove that neither the spectators, nor actors could receue any hurt by your playes, are these; that for your penning

you are base and meane, as I see, (so you tell mee) and specially for womanly behaviour you were so carelesse, that when one of your actors should haue made courtsie like a woman, hee made a legge like a man; and your spectators could not greatly charge your actors with any such diligence in meditation and care to imprint any passions. Of which three assertions the last is already disprooved in part by Nais: and your selfe, qualifying it with the worde greatly, declare that in your conscience your actors might bee charged with earnest meditation and care to imprint passions, though not greatly charged. The middest, of one actor forgetting his woman hoode, doeth no more argue that you were earelesse for womanly behaviour, and for other also, but specially for womanly: then the oversight of a Philostrat. vit. sophistar. in Polem: 
               Greeke stage-player, who, when he said, O God, pointed to the ground; when he said, O earth, cast vp his hand to heaven ward, doeth argue that the Romans, Roscius, Aesopus, but specially the Greekes, were carelesse for seemely gesture on the stage. The formost, like the rest; and worthy to bee their ringleader for vntruth, or trifling. For neither doe I see, that in your penning you are base and meane, if you speake of all, and comprise loue-speeches too, as Hippolyte nescis quod fugis vitae bonum: Hippolyte, nescis.

               evill speeches corrupt good maners: and, beside your owne, you played Seneca too, whose penning neither Poetices li. 6. cap. 6. 
               Scaliger, nor Animadvers. in tragae. Sen. 
               Lipsius, nor Vlyss. red. prolog. & epilog. your selfe, doe vilifie as base; so that the very stile of somewhat, which you played, might worke strong impressions by your own verdict. Wherefore when of those three assertions you inferre, that neither the spectators, nor actors, could receaue any hurt by your playes: you dispute in like sort, as if to controll Nero. ca. 38. 
               Suetonius and Annal. li. 15 
               Tacitus, who say, that, when Rome was burnt in Neros time, some did of purpose fire it, one should reason thus: The stuffe which those incendiaries did vse, was 
               Stupa, taedaque. Sueton. Faces. Tacit. 
               towe and firebrands scarse kindled, as you see: and specially for certaine of them, who brought that stuffe, they were so carelesse of setting fire on houses, that 
               Vt raptus licentius exercerent. Tacit. Dio Xiphili. epit. 
               they fell to pillage, carying things away out of houses vnburnt; & such as they robbed and spoyled with sword and fire could not greatly

charge them with any such diligence in paines and care to burne the citie: and so neither the citie suffred hurt by them, nor they did any hurt. Strange, that Suetonius and Tacitus should say the contrarie. But sometimes good Homer him selfe will fall a slumbering. Now as you haue prooved thus, that neither actors nor spectators could receiue hurt by your playes: semblably you proove that no evill affections could be stirred vp therby, but rather good. For in Ulysse reduce (say you) who did not love tho fidelitie of Eumaeus; and Philaetius, towardes their maister; and hate the contrary in Melanthius? who was not mooved to compassion to see Ulysses, a great Lord, driven so hardly, as that hee was faine to be a begger in his owne house? who did not wish him well, and all ill to the wooers; and thinke them woorthily slaine for their bloody purpose against Telemachus, and other dissolute behaviour, not so much expressed on the stage, as imagined to bee done within? And so you goe forward with a troupe of questions, urging it as certaine that all your spectators did admire the constancie of Penelope, and dispraise the lightnes and bad nature of Melantho, and thinke her iustlie hanged for it; all did prayse the patience, wisedome and secrecie of Ulysses, & Telemachus his sonne; all were glad to see Vlysses restored to his wife; and goods, and his mortall enimies ouerthrowne and punished: againe, that in Rivates, all might be delited to see the fond behaviour of country-wooing, expressed by civill men, or the vanitie of a bragging souldier; all might detest drunkennes by seeing the deformitie of drunken mariners actions: that in Hippolytus likewise all yong men did wish them selues to be as chast as Hippolytus was; all the spectators detested the love of Phoedra; approved the grave coūsell of the Nurse to her in secret; none of them could be the woorse for her wooing Hippolytus in so generall termes; all did wish that Theseus had not bene so credulous; and were sory for the cruell death of Hippolytus. The most of which things you affirme they did, not meaning to pronounce of their secret thoughts, but that your playes were naturallie to woorke these effectes: as appeareth by that in some of the branches you say that the spectators might doe so, or so; yea, could not be the worse. And the same appeareth farther, by that you adde, that these &

such like passions were, or might be mooved in your playes, without hurt, at the least, to any man: as in other tragedies, who doeth not hate (say you) the furie of Medea; the revenge of Atreus; the treason of Clytaemnestra, and Aegysthus; and the crueltie of Nero? Contrariwise who doeth not pitie the rage, and death of Hercules; the calamitie of Hecuba and her children; the infortunat valour of Oedipus; the murder of Agamemnon; the banishment of Octavia; and such like? You take your selfe therefore hereby to haue prooved that no evill affections could bee stirred vp by your playes in any: at the least, no evill; and many good perhaps. But why in the particular point touching Hippolytus, in which it most behooved you (because of your new peece of Pandarus and Nais) to shewe that good affections might be stirred vp by his part in all, and no evill in any: Why demanded you, what young man did not wish himselfe to bee as chast, as Hippolytus was, if he were not so already? Why asked you not generally, as in the rest, who did not? was it because you thought, that some elder men did not wish them selves as chast, as hee was: but were stirred vp by Phaedras pangs, and Pandarus reasons, to wish the like motion had bene made to them? Or, that any maidens were vpon the stage, who could haue bene contented to become vnchast in yeelding to Hippolytus that which he would not graunt to Nais

                  odecima. I haue commended his example to them. But if they wished so, when they saw your play: it came more of somewhat which they brought thither, then which they found there. For, by your instruction, the death of Hippolytus should haue serued to teach them, that they must never denie vnto a Nais, or Phaedra, such requestes: as Epilog. in Hippoly. Sen. your self tell them, on speech concerning wemen; Quas ne quis vnquam spernere dehinc audeat, Hippolytus ecce horribile documentum dedit; Impunè temnat nemo terrestres Deas. And what if all, who were present, not the young men only, did admire the constancie of Penelope? Could no evill affection bee therefore stirred in anie by seeing a boy play so chast a part?

of a bragging souldier, of the drunken mariners, of the Nurse, of Phoedra? In some of which number your generall propositions, that all the spectators must needes bee mooved thus or thus thereby, are vntrue. In the rest, nay, in these too, manifest is the weaknes of your particular conclusions, that because good thoughts might be stirred vp in all the spectators by this or that part, therefore those parts could hurt no man. Besides, if by those partes no hurt could come to any, yet might there much by other which here you mention not: and so you come short of your conclusion generall, that no hurt could come to any by the passions that were mooved in your playes. Your generall propositions doe faile in the wemen: of whom you speake in such sort, that as 1. Tim. 1. 1

               some by putting away a good conscience, made shipwracke of their faith: so it may bee feared that you, by putting trueth and singlenes away, will hazard the shipwracke of common sense and reason. For when maried women doe committ adulterie, all are not displeased with their lightnes and bad nature, nor thinke them woorthie of death for it. David had an other opinion of Bathseba, in the 2. Sā. 11. 27 sacred storie; the foole in the Prov. 7. 22.

How can it bee then, that all should not onelie dispraise the bad nature and lightnes of Melantho, an vnmaried harlot, but also account her iustlie hanged for it? whom it is more likely that some would haue stepped foorth to begge from the gallowes, at least the loving wooer, who had said vnto her; Pulcherrim

As if one of them, vnto whom Prov. 1. 14.

So that, where you tell vs in defense of the spectacle of your drunken mariners, that it was not possible that anie man should be provoked to drunkennes thereby: albeit this were true, whereof yet I doubt, or rather I dout not, considering that many are overprone to folow anie vice or evill, which they see or heare, as an Syr. Thomas Eliot in the Governor, lib. 1. cap. 4. & 6. autour praised by your selfe observeth out of dailie experience in childrē swearing great oathes, and speaking lascivious and vncleane wordes by such example of other; but if it were true, there might neuerthelesse a deaw of that poyson, which Aristotle mentioneth, infect some tender buddes, and anoy their fruit by the drunken songs, by the drunken speeches, by the drunken gestures of those drunken beastes. The greater is your fault, who say, the Lacedemonians are commended for causing their slaves, beeing drunke in deede, to be brought before their children, that they seeing the beastlie vsage of such men, might the more loth that vice: but you much better expressing the same intent, not with drunken, but with sober men, counterfeiting such vnseemelie manners, are the lesse therefore to be reprehended. Wherein how overthwarthly you affirme your selues to haue done much better then the Lacedaemonians, whose fact is commended; and yet conclude that you are the lesse therefore to be reprehended, as if your conscience tolde you that either your fact is not like to theirs, or hath some notable difference whereby it is made worse and woorthy of reproofe, though of the lesse reproofe, the liker it is to theirs in part: we shall the more easilie perceaue, if we consider how the commender of it (why signified you not his name, or place?)

Wherevpon if Seius should say, it were much better that true men should faine them selves to be theeves, display some theevish pranke of theirs vpō a stage, and seeme to be hanged for it; or that chast maidens and yong men should coūterfeit the misdemeanour of hoores & knaves, and openly representing the filthy act of their vncleannes, bee taken in it, and putt to shame: your selfe, I am perswaded, would iudge his better to be woorse; at least in the latter point of knaves and hoores, because the shame, that lighteth on thē after the fact done, may profit the beholders; but the doeing of it, and of things tending to it, hath turpitude that may corrupt them.

Wherefore you are so farre off from having prooved that no evill affection could bee stirred vp in anie by your playes: that I can hardlie remember any evill affection, which might not be stirred vp thereby in many; not onely in the actors, but the spectators also. And I thinke your selfe, if you peruse advisedly this whiche I haue written, and diligentlie compare it with your Vlysses redux, Rivales, and Hippolytus, will take time of respitt before you name as much as one inordinate passion; whereto I shall not quote, at least one players part, perhaps two, or three, that may be as oile vnto the fire. Howbeit, had you prooved the contrarie hereof, yet is my conclusion entier, as I said, and your playes vnlawfull: because it is vnlawfull to imitate and resemble any misbehaviour; and your selfe can not denie but sundry lewdnesses were imitated and resembled in eche of your playes.

The Heb. 5. 14. knowledge of good and euill, is to be wished: but because the Gen. 2. 17. meanes was ioyned with disobedience, it had bene better for them to haue lacked that knowledge. Among the Lacedaemonians,

Now the same reasons, that, in choise of autours to be read by vs, exclude so fine a Poët, and send vs vnto purer fountaines of good literature: doe likewise in the practise of style, the frame of speech, and imployment of memorie, exclude such points and matters as Terence is excluded for, and commend vnto vs more commendable arguments to exercise our wittes, our tounges, our pennes in. Which the wise Founders and Governours of the worthy Colleges and companies of Students here among vs did very well consider: taking order therefore that by rendring and rehearsing of Aristotle; or Tullie; by writing, pronouncing, declaiming, disputing, of questions in sundry faculties and artes, the vse whereof may serue them afterward to purpose, young men should bee made the readier and fitter to confirme the truth, to confute errours, to dehort from evill things, and instruct to good.

If they should not be suffered to peruse writings of base & filthy qualitie, nor to cast their eyes, as it were, vpon them: much lesse should they engraue them by heart in their remembrance, expresse them with voice, commend them with action, deliver them with boldnes. If they should not exercise their style, their speech, their memorie, but in honest, vertuous, and commendable matters, which in vse of lise may serve them to good purpose: much lesse should they meditate how they may inflame & tender youth with loue; entise him to daliance, to hoordom, to incest; inure their mindes and bodyes to vncoomly, dissolute, railing, boasting, knavish, foolish, brainsicke, drunken conceits, woordes, and gestures. Wherefore to the Timothees, that are among your Students, I must say in like sort as Saint Paul to Timothee:

            Now, the inconveniences and mischiefes of your playes being so notorious and manifold, as I haue shewed: the rest of mine answer opposed to your reasons devised for their defense, will easilie deliver it selfe from your cavills. For where you having said that your Students did not misspend their time therein, because they spent no more time then vseth to be spent in sports, sleepe, talke, and learned releasing of the minde from studie; and having added thereto that, sith there is a time for sportes, playes, danses, and man consisting not of one part alone doeth neede recreation, therefore you may be stage-players; I answered to the former, that by the like reason a student haunting a dicing house, or taverne, or stewes, might proove that he did not misspend his time thereat; to the later, that recreation is necessarie for Schollers, yet would it not beseeme them to play at stoole-ball amonge wenches, nor at Mumchance or Maw with idle lost companions; nor at trunkes in Guile-halls, nor to danse about Maypoles, nor to rifle in alehouses, nor to carowse in Tavernes, nor to steale Deere, nor to robbe Orchyards: you reply that to compare your playes to these things, it exceedeth the compasse of any tollerable resemblance; and therevpon eftsoones you surname them hard and incomparable comparisons. Wherein howe incomparably you lavish out of measure, and exceede the compasse of any reasonable speach, you may quickly see, now that I haue prooved your playes to be evill: si

For how can it be chosen but to compare your charges on playes to those on Christ, must needes exceede the compasse of any tolerable resemblance: vnlesse things agreeing in a generall point, as you suppose (though falsly) these to doe in honestie, may be very well resembled eche to other?

Chiefly, sith you know, that even in the degree of honest matters too, whereon expenses are made, there is an infinite difference betwene the actions, which you match: I can not say so of those that I compare. Nay, some of the thinges that I compare your stage-playes with, are lesse evill; as namelie,

for scholers to play at stooleball among wenches: which to doe by day light, in open streetes, in their owne likenes, were not so vnmeete and inconvenient for them, as to be attired in wemens raiment, by wemen, within doores, in the night time, to goe to and fro, and come vpon the stage, and play Melantho, or Nais. Contrariwise, the action wherewith you match yours; was infinitely better, as your selfe acknowledge: and had, as you must also acknowledge, 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                  , it was esteemed by thē, who amplified it to the vttermost. Mark. 14. 5. Ioh. 12 5. And that may amount to nine or ten pound of our moony. lesse bestowed thereon, then yours had. So that your consequution doeth halt here againe; It was no wast to bee at lesser cost in woorking a good woorke on Christ; Ergo it is no wast to bee at greater charges in setting foorth of playes. But mine is vnreprooveable; It beseemeth not scholers to play at stooleball among wenches, though modest and chast; Therefore it beseemeth them not to play wanton wemen on the stage. The same may I say of the two comparisons, which herewithall you checke; the former, alleaged out of Salvianus, or out of Scripture rather; the later, adioyned by mee for illustrating and opening the former: to weete, that with the players of lewde and naughty parts it fareth as with ae foole committing wickednes in pastime; and they are like a mad man, who casteth firebrands, arrowes, and mortall thinges, and saith, was I not in sport? For a mad man casting firebrandes, and the like, endangereth bodies onely: the players of lewde parts doe endanger sowles. And a foole commiting wickednesse in pastime hath seldome many admirers and folowers to hurt: the players haue as many, as a great Theater holdeth, and can heare them say, But O Cupido, or, O quàm juvaret. Wherefore when you amplifie herevpon, and tell me, you could haue wisht that such comparisons had bene forborne, if not for the playes them selves, though also they ought for the playes them selves, being thinges that savour of some witt, learning, and iudgement; yet in respect of the actors, your whole house, the spectators, approovers, autours, writers; all which points you loade with patheticall circumstances otherwhere entreated of: you force me to say I could haue wisht also that you had forborne these Galba-trickes of seeking to preiudice the trueth and equitie of causes with partiall affections and respect of persons, a Lev. 19. 15. Prov. 24. 23

condemned by Scriptire; and that you had considered that if playes savouring of some witt learning, and iudgement, ought not to be compared to such things as I mentioned, then your selfe did ill in praysing and allowing that part of my discourse, wherein the foole and mad man served for comparisons. For you gaue testimonie therof, that I had written copiously and truly against the bad effects of stage-playes in generall. Yea, specifying the proofes that I made by sundry examples and autorities, among which the autoritie of Salvianus was, you soothed it as containing a truth, and well handled. But the stage-playes spoken of by Salvianus, did savour of some witt, learning, and iudgement: as what play doeth nor? at least of all those that any ancient Poët wrote. Your reason therfore brought from the savour of witt learning, and iudgement, to crosse my comparisons; doeth crosse your owne allowance of that which you acknowledged to be well spoken against the bad effects of stage-playes in generall. And thus, as Apollod

            A more greevous wound haue you giuen your selfe in saying that you presumed your playes to be lawfull, when you made your simple assertion (so you terme it) that there is a needfull time for sports. For this is in effect as much as if you saide, that you played the Aristo. de

               begging the point in question, and taking it as granted. The which kinde of dealing, if it had any sinewes to graple with an adversarie, the Iesuits might trooble vs, by saying that the Catholike faith must be kept; and they presume that Poperie is the Catholike faith. Likewise the meanest advocate in a court of law might speede all his clients, by saying that such as haue wrong offered them, ought to be releeved; and hee presumeth his clients haue so. Neither had you needed to write so long a reply of twelue leaves to me: twelue wordes might haue sufficed, that you presume my cause is naught, and

naughty things must not be credited. But your selfe acknowledge that this prooveth not the lawfulnes of your playes. So that, in affirming you did presume them to bee lawfull, and calling it a simple assertion which you avowed concerning sports, you speake more trueth then you intended. For it is a simple assertion in deede to say that sports are needfull, against a mans arguments who saith that stage-playes are vnlawfull. And hee may be iustly noted of presumption, who, beeing vnable to proove a thing he fansieth, condemneth them as Momes that are minded otherwise and bring sound proofe against it.
            Howbeit, had you kept your selfe within the compasse of such oversights, you were more excusable. But it is a greater fault to play the sclanderer by falsifying mens wordes, and fathering vpon them an erroneous sentence, which never came into their mindes, nor fell out of their mouths or pennes. And what doe you else, when having saide that I vse many wordes against dansing, you reply that you loue to see honest dansing; and, you see no cause in reason, charitie, or Christian libertie, why dansing should simply be condemned. For hereby you insinuate, or pronounce rather, that I condemned dansing simply, and honest dansing: whereas my wordes were that danses of Penelopes wooers, of Melantho, of other of her maides, and simply all stage-dansing do savour of dishonestie. Which differeth as much from that you father on me, as the speech of Christ, 
               Ioh. 2. 19. 
               Destroy ye this temple, & in three dayes I will raise it vp againe, meaning of his body, did differ from that which Matt. 26. 61 
               the false witnesses affirmed him to haue said of the temple of God, 
               Mar. 14. 58. 
               the temple made with handes. Nay, it surpasseth that of the false witnesses: it differeth as much as if, where Christ saide, that Luk. 13. 3. & 21. 18. 
               all vngodly men shall perish, they had fathered on him that all men shall perish. And your crime herein is the more blamewoorthy, because I had so plainly excepted certaine dansing, that you can not seeme to haue mistaken my wordes, and reade all dansing, for all stage-dansing; but wilfully and advisedly to haue misreported mee. For I said expressely, I meant those danses that I specified, and not

               are faultie even in youth too. So both mine owne woords, and the autour I cited, doe manifestlie shew, that whē you tooke vpō you to prayse honest dansing, and said you saw no cause in charitie or reason why dansing should simply be condemned, you could not but in reason and charitie see cause, why you should have dealt more simply and honestly, then so calumniouslie to raise a false surmise of me. You know what creature it is, whom the Rev. 12. 9. scripture nameth a

               calumniatour.
            
            Beside, as you offend in charging me with that I said not: so in going about to overthrow that which I said. For whereas I affirmed that dansing of Penelopes wooers with her maides, and simply all stage-dansing, is disallowed by the light of nature; and for proofe thereof did alleage the testimonies, of Romans putt by Nero, of Philistines putting Samson to it, and of all ancient 
               6 Pastorē saltaret vti Cyclopa, rogabat: Nil illi larva, aut tragicis opus esse cothurnis. 
               lawes in a manner, yea of reason it selfe, as Arias Montanus noteth: you, avouching two mens opinions to the contrarie, doe adde, that to apply, either the dansing of those noble Romans, whom Nero enforced to danse so publikely; or, Samsons dansing among the Philistines; or, the note of Arias Montanus, against your dansing onely of two sober measures, is a comparison without all measure. Wherein first, through negligence of marking my words, or desire of crossing them before you vnderstood them, you misreport my drift: and say that I applyed those thinges against your dansing onely of two sober measures, (you meane, the wooers dansing with the maides,) which I applyed not against it alone, but against the rest of your stage-dansing also, that is, all your stage-playing. For this did I betoken by the name of stage-dansing, the better to expresse the sentence, that I had in hand, of Saint Ambrose, who by Saltationis lubricae histrionicos motus & scenae deliramenta. 
               dansing noteth all histrionicall motions and playings on the stage, in like sort as Satyr. lib. 1. sat. 5. 
               Horace saith, Saltabat Hylas Oedipodē. Pylades: 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . 
               one was requested to danse Polyphemus, meaning to play his part; and Caeruleatus, & nudus, caputque redimitus arundine, & candam trahens, genibus innixus, Glaucum saltavit.

thus much, if you had better weighed the branches of my speech, & proofes therto answering, concluded with the note of Arias Montanus, touching not onely dansers, but persons of such shewes & spectacles. Chiefly if you had looked on the autour him selfe, and marked that in the persons of such shewes and spectacles, he compriseth stage-players; as the Hujus generis actiones ingenuo homine indigniffimas duxerunt, qui de virtute vera, de

            An other iniurie is it, that you terme those proofes of mine, a comparison; and (which is more) a comparison without all measure. What Matt. 7. 2. 
               measure you did vse in the meting out hereof, I can not guesse: vnlesse peradventure, because that you had heard that comparisons are odious, you hoped you should make all my proofes odious by naming them comparisons. For I, having noted, against your argument drawne from sports and recreations, that sports by the light of nature, are accounted vnseemelie, bad, infamous, and so is all stage-dansing; did alleage the iudgements of Romans, of Philistines, of ancient lawes well nigh all, and of reason it selfe, as testimonies to proove that proposition by; not as comparisons, but as testimonies And therefore in the note of Arias Montanus, I did omitt that he saith of Divina verò lex minimè admittenda censuit, invulgaribus etiam ac vilibus capitibus; & quae sequuntur. 
               the law of God condemning stage-playes likewise, because that might goe higher then the light of nature. Otherwise, you may be sure that I, who cited him for mens lawes, a thing of weaker proofe, would not have omitted the lawe of GOD, his strongest argument. But if I had ioyned supernaturall light to the light of nature, and had produced testimonies of the Scripture also: would you have replied, that, to alleage the Scripture, is a comparison without all measure? You must by like reason. And what should stay you from it? All would have espied that it were no comparison. Why more, then the note of Arias Montanus? which yet, when you had cast my allegation of the Romans and Philistines in such a mould, that it could not appeare I brought them in as testimonies; you named with them for company a comparison too. Though, seeing you are greeved with my applying of it against your stage-dansing, and that induced you to call it a cōparison: me thinks you should have fastned that odious name rather on the proposition
               
prooved by those testimonies. For the proofes reach not you immediatlie, they fight not nigh at hande: the proposition doeth; as being the maior of that argument, wherof your stage-players make the minor. And the proposition, condemning all stage-dansing, doth giue a deadlyer wound; nether can it choose but light on your stage-dansing: the proofes might seeme to be more easilie avoided; or, comming so farre off, to raze the skinne onely. Againe, my applying of the proposition to you, by the assumption, would deserve more woorthily the name of a comparison: and the assumption being particular, or singular; the proposition vniversall; were not this applying of all against some, a comparison without all measure?
            
            The third iniurious part offered me in this point, is, that you alleage the iudgement of Homer and Syr Thomas Eliot, as making for that dansing, which I did reproove. And bringing in the former of them by a Praeteritio.

               Scripture, the iudgement of Pet. Mart. in lib. Iud. cap. 21. Hyperius de feriis Bacchanalib. Aretius probl. theolog. tom. 1. loc. 14. 
               Divines thereon. So shall you perceiue, that Homer in the eight booke of his Odyssea, hath no sufficient warrant for Melantho to danse together with Eurymachus, the maides with the wooers; no not though they were maides and Melantho in deede; much lesse for boyes attired like Melantho, & maides, to danse with men vpon a stage. The later of your autours you alleage directlie; and, that learned Knight Syr Thomas Eliot, say you, among other things that he writeth in a booke of his, in the prayse of dansing, compareth the man treading the measures, to Fortitude, and the woman on his hande, to Temperance. You adde, that you have seene the booke, and you remember hee vseth this comparison in it. But did you not remember the name of the booke too? or was it for some speciall cause that you concealed it? your woordes might giue a man occasion to thinke, that he had written a booke in the praise of dansing: which that he did, I Baleus scriptorum Britann. centur. 8. cap. 77. finde not. I guesse you meane therefore his booke entituled the Governour. Wherein Lib. 1. ca. 20 he prayseth Dansing, and vttereth somewhat like to that avouched by you, and Cap. 22. 23. 24. & 25. treateth of circumstances (a point you touch also) which being all observed, dansing may be honestlie and honorably vsed: But his speech of Fortitude and Temperance represented by men and maidens in a danse, commeth nothing neere your maides and wooers measures, whereto you would stretch it. For, among diverse maners and kindes of dansing vsed in ancient time, he rehearseth one, wherein (as De saltat. 
               Lucian saith, translated woord for woorde by him in a maner)

               such motions as he might afterward vse in warre; the maiden following him modestly and shamefastlie; so that it represented a pleasant coniunction of temperance & fortitude. Now those warlike motions were (as De legi. li. 7 
               Plato sheweth, speaking of the like danse) gestures which resembled, partlie the avoiding all sortes of woundes and blowes by

               all sortes of wounds. Wherfore this being it, that represented Fortitude in the danse described by Syr Thomas Eliot: farre was it frō his meaning to make your measures, your sober measures, warlike motions; or compare a wooer treading them, to Fortitude. As farre, as to compare a boy doeing the same in maidens likenes, to Temperance. Which, if you had otherwise expressed his sense rightlie, yet should you haue forborne to apply to yours for the observing of decorum, a thing that you commend so in Homer, and your selfe aime at: sith those maides and wooers, intended both by Homer and you, to be wantons, must vse lascivious danses; and the man (if you will needes haue such resemblances) bee compared rather to Mollitude, or Cowardnes, the woman to Incontinencie. Beside that, the praise which that learned Knight geveth vnto dansing, he giveth it not simply; (for he saith Lib. 1. ca. 19 
               some danses, doe corrupt the mindes of them that danse, and provoke sinne:) but with limitation, to weete, cap. 22. & 2

               being vsed and continued in such forme, and with such observations and rules, as hee specifieth. Whereof the first (to name one for example) is, that, by the curtesie or reverent inclination made at beginning of dansing, the dansers and beholders should marke and remember this to be signified, that at the beginning of all our actes, we should doe due honour to God, which is the roote of prudence. And in deede if dansers in treading of their measures had such regards and meditations: then not Syr Thomas Eliot onely, but the Fathers would praise dansing too. For, when godly Bishops assembled in the Councells of Concil. Laodicen. can 53 
               Laodicea, and Conc. Ilerd. can. ult. Concilior. tom. 2. 
               Ilarda, decreed that Christians ought not to danse at mariages; when St 
               In Matt. hom. 59. 
               Chrysostome blamed women for so doeing, as being a staine vnto their sexe; when St 
               De virginib. lib. 3. 
               Ambrose cited and averred that of Orat. pro Muraen. 
               Tullie, that such as danse are drunke, or madde; when St 
               In Psal. 32. part.

                  . 
               Austin said that it were better to spend the Sabbat day in digging & delving, then in dansing: they meant not to restraine men from marking, and remembring, that at the beginning of all their actes, they should doe due honour to God; but they thought that dansers haue commonlie their mindes on thinges of an other

qualitie. Which if your wooers and maidens also had; as (I am perswaded) them selves will not deny, and you seeme to have thought by touching so nicely, or rather scarcelie touching, the circumstāces that you say should be observed in dansing: you abuse the name of that learned Knight, in vrging his prayse of a good danse that might bee, against my disprayse of an ill danse that is. It had bene more reason, that when his conceit caried him a litle out of the way sometimes, as in that Lib. 1. ca. 20 he prayseth Lucians stage-danser, who dansed the adulterie of Mars and Venus with resembling of 
               
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , saith Lucian. 
               every act therein, (which I hope, your selfe would not allow on your stage;) you should haue acknowledged that through too great a love of dansing, he liked too well of Lucians treatise: though otherwise he fansied not the autour much; as Lib. 1. ca. 10 he well declareth by noting of Huius impios & scurriles dialogos scho larū nostrarum censores volunt, si Deo placet, in puerotū scholis praelegi, &c. Hyperius opusc. de sacrar. literar. stud non deferend. his ribaudrie, and his too much scorning; and by saying farther, It were better that a childe should never read any part of Lucian, then all Lucian. Or, if the sentence of a Knight, so woorthy, had such credit with you; why did you not consider Lib. 1. ca. 19 his religious wish, that the names of idoles, of Paynim Gods and Goddesses, were not vsed at this day in balades and dities, to the corrupting of many good wittes with godlesse fantasies? For though his reproofe doe specially touch the most vile idoles, Venus, and Bacchus, remembred so in dansing-songs as if the danse were to their honour and memorie; a matter most abhorring from Christes religion, and savouring of the ancient errour of Paganisme: yet as the Exod. 33. 13 Psal. 16. 4. Hos 2. 17. Scripture, the ground of his reproofe, doeth generallie condemne such naming of other Gods, semblably he sheweth, that, if you had attributed so much to his iudgement, you should haue eschewed that fault in your tragedie. At least, wher the woords are vttered as it were in your owne person: as Vlyss. red. prolog. ad Acad. those of Llluminavit Deos.

by the flower of those persons, by whose partes (you say) no hurt could come to any man: and Syr Thomas Eliot thought that such speeches, savouring of Paganisme, might corrupt good wittes. But howsoever you shall distinguish your Poëme from the balades and dities, in which he controlleth this irreligious custome of giving the honour of God to vile idoles: your selfe doe beare witnesse that he commēdeth not the dansing of Eurymachus & the rest of your wooers with their Melanthos on the stage. For among the partes of their dissolute behaviour imagined to be doon within, you rehearse their Regiam perdunt domum Luxu, choréis, scelete, dapibusque impiis.

               Act. 1.

               their maners at home they kept their wont, Their dansing on the stage then, your self acknowledge, was vnhonest dansing. And the dansing praysed by Syr Thomas Eliot is honest dansing, you say. Therefore you doe manifest wrong vnto vs both, in alleaging him as praysing that which I dispraysed.

openly reading your Vlysses to them, then to have seene it acted as it was. Wherein to the intent you may see how you play the Theban, I will vse a comparison, and that within some measure I trust.

               Doe you thinke that animal, a living creature indued with sense, wanteth reason? Sempronius answered him, that animal is one thing, and a beast an other, as De legi. li. 1. 
               Tullie declareth, affirming a Animal hoc providum, sagax, multiplex, acutum, memor, plenum rationis & consilii, quem vocamus hominē. 
               man (whom he calleth animal) to be full of reason, whereof he saith, that Solum est enim ex tot animātium generibus atque naturis particeps rationis, & cogitationis, cùm caetera sint omnia expertia. 
               no beast at all is partaker. If Gryllus should reply that the woord is vsed in 
               Metamor. lib. 1. 
               Ovid for 
               Pronaque cùm spectent animalia caetera terram, os homini sublime dedit. 
               all things that have life and sense, not for men onely, and therfore he might vse it indifferently for beasts in a general acceptatiō: would not they, who see, that belike he meant to comprehend men also vnder that generall woord, thereby the more closely to fetch in beastes with them; and that, restraining it to beasts, his question must bee, Thinke you that beastes want reason? which were an idle question, and openly implying a begging of the point in controversie; would they not, I say, condemne him as a wrangling and contentious Sophister? Now, if in the same vaine, or rather in a woorse, he should adde moreover, that as Epist lib. 1. epi. 1.

As Theodoret. hist ecclesia. lib. 2. cap. 16 when a Catholike Bishop, being rebuked by an Arian Emperour for standing alone with Athanasius against the whole worlde, said that the doctrine of faith was not impeached though he alone mainteined it, seeing that of olde time 
               Dan. 3. 12.

But, I pray you, leave this Eunuches odious practise in racking my cōparisons: and marke the maine point whereat I aime in them, and which I seeke to open by them. For, as in Gryllus question, and verse, framed like yours, the circumstances giue, that he vsed the generall woord comprising man, thereby to breed a fansie that if this kinde of animal haue reason, why not the other? In like sorte your expresse mention of Cuius vel vnum simile carminibus me

               reading, I say, of reading, not of playing, in shewing what a iewell you take the reciting of Seneca to be; maketh it probable that you meant to doe by the generalitie of the woord recitare. The more, because you vsed it not onely in your verse, where your excuse might serve, that it stoode better then agere would in that place; as Gryllus might say likewise for versifying animal rather, then bestiam: but in your prose also, the 
               Tragoedia noua, in aede Christi recitata. 
               title of your tragedie; as if Gryllus, setting downe the point controversed betweene him and Sempronius, should make it, vtrum animal sit rationis expers; where the woorde In the larger sense, that Tullie geueth it: Tusc quae. lib. 5. De nat. Deor. lib. 2. not in the stricter of your Lawiers: l. 1. § removet. D de postulando. l. 1. §. in bestiis. D. si quadrup. pauper. sec. di. 
               bestia, would serve as fitlie in prose; nay, (if plaine dealing were meant) a great deale more fitlie. And if you intended not to make that reason which I supposed you did, it is no losse to recite Seneca, Ergo no losse to play him: but meant to vse the generall woorde for the speciall, and to aske Momus onely, Thinke you it a losse to play Seneca? thē you begged at Momus hand, or tooke as graunted, the point you should haue prooved; sith the playing of Seneca was condemned by him, and you vndertooke to confute his arguments. Againe, as Horace, Persius, the law, alleaged

by Gryllus, doe shew that certaine men want the vse of reason, but neither proove that beasts haue it, nor that mankind wanteth it; and his presumed testimonie of the Areopagus, brought in with a particle of similitude, So, as hitting iumpe with Horace, Persius, and the law, is too too absurd: in like sort the same autours, alleaged by your selfe, doe shew that some reciters are misliked by them, but neither prove that players are liked, nor all reciters misliked; and the Vniversities testimonie which you bring in with the same particle, as hitting iumpe with those autours, I can not say you bring it altogether as Gryllus, but you bring it strangely.

Now in that you adde hereto the Universitie, and make vs ioyne with the former in opinion, saying; So the Vniversitie would have thought it a more absurd thing, to have heard me, or any other, openly reading my Ulysses to them, then to have seene it acted, as it was: what meane you by this terme, So? That if you, or an other, had read your Vlysses openly vnto them, it had bene done out of due place, or due time? or, they should haue heard wanton verses read? or wantonly? or by a wanton? or with a vaine-glorious minde? or on the stage? In deede, they should haue heard In Melanthos part, & Eurymachus. some wanton verses, I graunt: and both out of due place, and time, if you had read it Qui pronuntiandi causa in scenam prodierit. 
               where, & Die Dominico. 
               when it was acted. Neither doe I doubt but the Universitie would haue thought such open reading, of such stuffe, on such a day, absurd: though, whether more absurd, then to haue seene it acted as it was, I know not. But whatsoever they would haue thought in this comparison, wherein the 
               L. 1. D. de his qui not. infam. 
               law, that you cite, noting both with infamie, should giue (mee thinkes) a deeper print thereof to acting then reading, all things weighed: you are farre

from hitting the marke, whereat you shoote; namely, from cō
               vincing by the Universities testimonie, and iudgement, my sentence as absurd, that if your tragedie had bene recited onely, I would have accounted it no more losse of time to haue heard you pronounce it, then my selfe to reade it. For, I did not meane, if it had bene recited as those were, which the autours by you alleaged, doe reproove: but as Lib. 1. sat 4. 
               Horace vsed to Non recite cuiquam, nisi amicis, idque coactus. Non vbiuis corámve quibuslibet. 
               recite his owne writings; as Quintilio si quid recitares corrige sodes Hoc aiebat, & hoc. Hora. de art. poet.

               Persius did recite his booke vnto Cornutus, before he published it. Whereof if you pronounce (as you doe, if you speake to purpose) that our Universitie would haue thought it a more absurd thing, then to have seene it acted as it was: you deale in like maner with our Vniversitie, as Gryllus with the reverend bench of Areopagus, if he should abuse their name and estimation, to perswade that brute beastes have more reason, then the wisest men have.
            
            Hereto would be annexed that, which in the fourth and, last head of reasons, you vrge againe concerning our Universities iudgement for the approbation of your playes in generall: if your interlaced defense of wastfull cost in setting foorth therof (the onely point remaining besides) were discussed. And this is easilie done, considering what hath bene alreadie prooved against you touching the inconveniences and mischifes of your playes. For having made Momus obiect the great charges; which how great they were, you know better then I, who summed them perhaps too much beneath the due whē I did mention thirtie pound; but having made him say that it should haue bene bestowed on the poore rather, you take him vp with three answeres: one, that the mony was your own, not his; an other, that the charge, though great to him, was meane to you; the thirde, that none would give the lesse to the poore for that, none would have given the more without it. All the which I shewed to be of no force for warrāting of expēses on things of that qualitie, because, both vnhonest spending of a mans owne, is wastfulnes & riott, condemned by our Saviour in the prodigall sonne: and, as Nero giving much to gett a Plaudite, was the lesse able to help the poore by so much, and the lesse willing too perhaps; in like

sort may you be. Herevpon you demand of me, What similitude is there, or can there be, betweene the prodigall sonne, that in such a sort, as he did, spent all, and brought him selfe to the extreemest miserie; and betweene your expense? A question, which you would not have pressed, as you doe; for your vnlikenes to him in that he wasted all, and brought him selfe to extreeme miserie thereby: if you had considered that 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . woord in the originall text of the Gospell, whereto my quotation for Luk. 15. 13. riott did direct you. For vsually it noteth the qualitie of expenses made by loose & wanton persons on their pleasures, as in forein writers, Ethicor. lib. 4. cap. 1.

               with harlotts. Now, in Rome, of olde time, there were common

               harlots to be hired for 
               Two oboli beeing the third part of drachma, or denarius; & eight drachma, or denarii, weighing an ounce of siluer. 
               two pence halfe-peny. The price in our dayes, by reason of the Io. Athon. gloss. in constit. Othon. de concubin. clericor. remouend. Fr. Sansouin. de administr. regnor & rerumpub. lib. 11. cap. de mareschallo. tribute, which they are to pay the Pope, may bee enhaunsed. But if one, desirous of an harlots company, could have her so cheape, and should pleade for him self that the moony he spendeth on her is his owne, & the charge not great, neither would he geve the lesse vnto the poore for that, nor more without it: were this a lawfull barre to stay vs from accusing him of 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  
                
               riott, I meane, of wastfull and vnhonest spending; (give it a fitter English name, if you know any; I tooke that which our best interpreters agree on;) but might we not accuse him thereof vpon the same ground that Scripture doeth the prodigall sonne? Or, if some Preacher, more severe then Horat. satyrar. li 1. sat. 2 
               Cato, should deale so strictly and rigorously with him; might he aske what similitude there is, or can be, betweene his expense of two pence half-peny, and the prodigall sonne, who in such a sort, as he did, spent all, and brought himselfe to the extremest miserie? Much fault haue you found with my hard incomparable comparisons and similitudes; & some of them are Sed quid opus teneras mordaci radere vero Auricolas? Pers. sat. 1. 
               hard in deede, though none incōparable: but I must say thereof, as the Apostle of his boasting, 
               2 Cor. 12. 11 
               you haue compelled me. For when I tooke a softer and more gentle course, as here, to encounter that aunswere made to Momus, Thou saist the charge is great; but thou mayst come, and looke on, Momus, and pay nothing, no man doeth aske thee a peny;
               
I resembled it to an aunswere which the prodigall sonne might thus haue made to his reproover, Thou blamest me for wasting, but I wast none of thine; thou mayst drinke with me scotfree, if thou be a good felow, & welcome: albeit the very woord, wasting, might haue shewed I meant vnhonest spending, (for Luk. 16. 9. 1. Tim. 6. 18 Tit. 3. 14. Reu. 14. 1
                     •…
                  . thinges spent honestly are not wasted,) chiefly sith I vsed it in respect of the riot noted by our Saviour; and in the vnthrifts speech, drawing good felowes to drinke with him, I pointed to his lusty, excessive, dissolute 1. Pet. 4. 3. drinkings with lewde companions like himselfe; yet you did reply, that, if hee had bene as moderate and thrifty in spending at his boord, as you were at your playes, he might well enough have said to any niggard, that should haue vnwisely found fault with him, as much as I make him say, not with the note of a prodigall, but with the commendation of an ingenuous and liberall disposition. Whereby you make mee see, to what reprochefull contumelies of a niggardly minde, and want of wisedome and discretion, I should haue laid my selfe open, if I had still endevoured to disclose vnto you the weaknes of your aunswers by gentle similitudes. That similitude therefore of mine, the tender smoothnes whereof occasioned you to mistake my meaning, and intertaine it so coursly, I have now corrected with substituting a rougher, which may deliver you from errour, and me from such tantes. For seeing you perceve this to be my meaning, that the threefold answer made by you to Momus is like as if Cie. de finib. lib. 2. 
               Gallonius, or some other Epicure, reprooved by a Stoike for going to the stewes, should answer him; Thou blamest me for spending two pence half-peny on a wench, but I spend none of thine; thou maist goe with me thither, if thou be a good felow, & I will give her as much for thee too; the charge, though it seeme great to thee, is small to me; neither will I bestow a dodkin lesse vpon the poore for that, nor more without it: you will not reply, that if Gallonius had bene as moderate and thrifty in his spending at his bedde, as you were at your playes, (they cost a number of you more, you wote, in severall, then twise two pence halfe-peny;) hee might well enough have said to any niggard, that should haue vnwisely found fault with him, as much as I make him say, not with the note of a prodigall, but with the

commendation of an ingenuous and liberall disposition. And so, by the other similitude likewise mended, and as it were rough hewen, you may the better learne to discerne my drift, and spare your owne replying. For when, to discover the povertie of your aunswere touching the poore, I said, that Nero peradventure was either lesse able, or lesse willing to helpe the poore, by reason of five or sixe thousand pownd given for a Plaudite; which charge notwithstanding he might better beare, then some of your students may fiue or six shillings: you replyed, that, if Nero could haue as well spared such huge summes of moony, which hee spent that way often, as your House, with the company in it, and belonging to it, can once in many yeares thirty powndes: Nero should haue bene wronged greatly, being an Emperour, to haue bene noted of wastfulnes; and, if ever hee had any such good minde, hee mought neverthelesse haue releeved the poore. Nowe, altering and changing Neros charge on Plaudite into Corn. Tacit. annal. li. 13. his charge on Acte (a harlot whom hee loved better then his wife,) and telling you that he was lesse able, or lesse willing (nay, both) to helpe the poore, by reason of

               gifts bestowed on her: I shall not heare, I trust, that, if Nero could haue as well spared the sundry summes of moony which he spent that way often, as your House, with the company in it, and belonging to it, can once in many yeares thirty powndes: Nero should haue bene wronged greatly, beeing an Emperour, to haue bene noted of wastfulnes. No, not, though in adding that clause, being an Emperour, you seeme to allude to Ethicor. li.

               the abundance of their wealth, which Nero could hardly exceede in gifts and expenses: not the

                  . qualitie of the matters that they spend their wealth on, wherin as prodigall persons may and doe wast, so Nero. Neither will you affirme that Nero mought neverthelesse have releeved the poore; for feare least you cause your reader to suspect you of shamelesnesse, or sophistrie. Shamelesnesse, if you say, that, whatsoever it were which Nero gaue to Acte, he had no whit the lesse in his coffers to giue others. Sophistrie, if by the woorde neverthelesse, you meane, notwithstanding. For Phoedria in the Terent. Eun. 
               Comedie, mought haue helped Parmeno, notwithstanding

the moony that he spent on Thais. Yet Nam quod nos capere oportet haec intercipit. the greater charge he was at with his harlot, the lesse had he remaining to giue his poore seruant. And your dout, if Nero had ever any such good minde, will bee as badly opposed vnto my speech of his lesse willinglesse. For both him selfe, Sueton Ner. cap. 10. having so good a minde once, became Cap. 32. & 38. worse minded afterward, when he was growen ca. 30. & 31. wastfull such wayes, yea, simply wastfull, prooving that to bee possible which Aristotle iudgeth

                   in ye woords alleaged. not easy to bee done: and if he had alwayes bene equally ill-minded, yet commeth it otherwise to passe in mans nature, as you might haue learned by Caesar and Plutarch. Of whom the one, beholding certaine rich strangers and foreiners, at Rome, carying whelpes of dogges and apes in their bosomes, and making much of them, did aske, Whether wemen brought not foorth children in their countries: 
               Plutarch. vita Periclis. the other saith that Caesar herein gaue a woorthy and princely admonition to them

                  . 
               who doe consume & wast, vpon beasts, the naturall affection and loue due to men. Both, evidently shewing, that the more wee spend on thinges of lesse value, the lesse we are disposed to spend on thinges more pretious; sith, 1. Ioh. 3. 17. as a mans loue is, so is his willingnes to spend for loue sake: and the loue of apes and dogges may better stande with the loue of Children, 
               Mark. 7. 27. eche of them beeing to bee loved, though not alike; then expenses on playes may with releeving of the poore, Prou. 19. 17. Mat. 25. 40. the Lorde accounting mercy had vpō the poore, as had vpō him selfe, & mony spēt on playes, being as mony spent on harlots. Wherfore, if you wil be sutable to your self, & as you deale for playes, so for the loue of apes & dogges, for which you may more reasonably; your threefold answer against Momus in your own defense, is quicklie turned against Caesar & Plutarch, for those strangers: The loue, which they did beare to the whelpes of dogges and apes, was their owne loue, it was not Caesars, or Plutarchs; great might it be to Caesar and Plutarch, meane to them; neither would they loue children the lesse for that, nor more without it. And as you assaulted Momus with the Scripture, telling him that Iudas his speech, who said, what needed this wast? is an evill speech; and nowe, notwithstanding the difference betwene your playes and Christ; vs and Indas, doe thinke that it

               may also be applyed against either the niggardise, or the hypocrisie of any Momus, that shall condemne all expense, as cast away, that is sometime moderatly bestowed vpon honest sportes and pastimes, and not vpon the poore: so, what letteth you to thinke that it may also bee applyed against either the clownishnes, or the hypocrisie of Caesar and Plutarch, who condemned all loue, as cast away, that is sometime, moderatly bestowed vpon sweete whelpes of dogges and apes, and not vpon children? For, if you should answer, the case is vnlike because you can not proove that mens colling and dandeling of such whelpes is seemely, which Caesar and Plutarch sawe good cause to reproove: you must bee remembred that yet you may say, the thing is seemely, though say it onely, and deny their reproofe to bee iust, though not refute it; as you avouch against mee that your playes were honest and lawfull recreations, whatsoever is rather obiected then prooved to the contrary. Nay, if Caesar, or Plutarch, had, beside their reasons to proove it vnseemely; alleaged sundry testimonies of Romans and Grecians so esteeming it, as I did the iudgements of a Lacedemonian, of Horace, of Tullie of other learned men, to shew that they deemed such cost, as you were at, to bee vaine and wastfull: yet, as you reply to me that all Paynim and heathen iudgement you haue answered in the defense of your first reason; so might you to them, that all the testimonies which they bring, you haue aunswered in the Culpam prorsus Hippolyto imputet, Iuveni protervo, caelibi, duro, truci. 
               prologue of your last play. I haue read The copie of a French letter to Don Bernardin Mendoze. that whē the Spaniards invincible navie mett with ours, about some five yeares since, vpon the narow seas, it was published in print, at Parise, by Mendoza the Spaniards procurement, that they gott a brave victorie, wherein my Lorde Admirall of England, with sixteene of the Queenes great shippes, were sunke to the bottome of the sea, and the rest put to flight with the Vice-admirall Francis Drake. But, God bee thanked, wee saw my Lord Admirall of England alive at her Maiesties late being here with vs: and now may the Mendozians picke out of their owne Lib. 1. ad ann. Christ. 1588. 
               Mercurius Gallobelgicus, that neither any one shippe of the Queenes navie, were it great, or small, was sunke by the Spaniards, nor the Vice-admirall put to flight.
            And thus at length approching vnto the conclusion, I come

to your maintenance of that which you obiected concerning the iudgement of our Vniversitie. Wherewith (least I passe any thing of weight in your reply, as you doe many in mine) I will ioyne that elswhere you touch about the woorshipfull, & sometimes honorable presence at your playes; and those reverend, famous, and excellent men, for life, and learning, and their places in the Church of God, who haue bene not onely writers of such things them selves, but also actors, and doe thinke well of them (as you affirme) to this day. Our Vniversities iudgement therefore you avow that you produced rightfully to the approoving of your playes, because the greater part of the Universitie did with their harty applause approove them. An argument, that neither layeth sound foundation, nor buildeth therevpon to purpose. For how proove you, first, that the greater part did with their harty appause approove them; seeing you acknowledge that many, some absent, some present, disallowed them? Forsooth, you say, you are sure of it. But your bolde avouching thinges, you are not sure of, doeth make mee dout of your assurance. For, vpon my speech that certaine who came thither were pressed therevnto by great importunitie, you wish they had more truly, and more charitably, for dansing, kissing, and other demeanour, reported to me of your playes, with such a minde as you will forbeare (you say) to speake of. Wherein you doe charge them, how charitably, iudge your selfe; but questionlesse, most vntruly, with making false reports of your playes to me, to whom they made no report at all thereof. Yea, you take vpon you to pronounce of their thoughts: and say they did it with such a minde, as in your Quintilian. lib. 9. cap. 2. figurative forbearing to speake of, you speake most bitterly of, and raise a very wrongfull and vile suspicion of them. Againe, where I tolde you how the grave and learned man, our common friend, shewed me his dislike of the representation of amorousnes, and drunkennes; in the Comedie, both; the former, not in it onely: you say, that you know how farre hee did somewhat dislike some Comicall action; but you are sure he commended much the playes to you, & would be sorry that any speech of his should bee, by mistaking, alleaged against you. And doe you not in assuring vs after this sort that hee did like of your

playes, saving a litle in the Comedie, imply that hee disliked nought in any tragedie? Or breede you not a sclanderous surmise of his integritie, as if hee had commended to you the very same, which vnto me he discommended? Or seeke you not to make men thinke that I mistooke him, in fathering that vpon him; when him selfe hath sithence acknowledged vnto mee, that I mistooke him not; and (as I am perswaded) hath certified you no lesse too?
            Wherefore your pronouncing, that you are sure the greater part did with their hartie applause approoue your playes, may rather proove you to bee rash, then your assertion to be true. Chieflie, sith you mention, not onely their applause, a thing that sense might iudge of; but their harty applause, a circumstance presumed by your conceit peradventure. For as they did Nisi displic
                     •…

               clappe their handes after your playes, so Iterum benignus vndique applausus sonet. after the appendix thereof touching Momus. Which yet some approovers of your playes approoved not: as them selves haue signified. How can you then be sure, that all, who did clappe their handes, did it with liking; and that the applause, which they gave, was hartie? Beside that, if their hearts ioyned with their handes, how can you be sure they approoved your playes by such applause, and not somewhat else? As Orat. pro P. Sextio. 
               Tullie declareth that the Romans vsed it to shew their loue of gratious persons: and in Vlyss. red. epilogo. one of your playes Huic vos Elisae quem decet plausum date. you wished it to be geuen to her gratious Maiestie. Nether is it impossible, but that, as a Horat. epist. lib. 2. ep. 1. number gaue it to the Lana Tarentino violas imitata veneno. apparell and furniture of the stage at Rome: so lighter bodyes might with you. And what if the grauer sort did shew the liking of your paines and charges employed for their delite sake? or of the better parts; not of wantons, of drunckards, & of the whole playes? Now, suppose the greater part of the Vniversitie approoued them with their harty applause: might you therefore lawfully vrge the Universities iudgment as making for them? Yea, say you, if the greater part may denominate the whole, Nay, by your leaue, euen so too will you come short still, vnlesse you adde, that iudgement and harty applause is all one: which Cicero, orat. pro Plancio. he, who affirmed that In comitiis, praesertim aedilitiis, studium esse populi, non

Lat. can. 3 there were in the primitiue Church certaine Christians (as in ours there are) who, having lost sowewhat, would goe to a wisard, or a setter of figures, or other such soothsayer, to knowe how it went from them, or by what meanes they might recover it. Sext. synod. in Trul. can. 61. One of the generall Councells spake against this: and called it 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , saith the Councell touching this and the like customes. a pernicious and an heathenish custome. The number of Bishops assembled in that Councell was lesser of all likelyhoode (amounting Theodor. Balsam. de ea synodo quae dicitur sexta. not to twelve score) then the number of Christians, who either vsed that practise them selves, or liked it in others. Yet, in my opinion, the Churches iudgement did controll it: and to say the contrary, because the greater part denominateth the whole, were most iniurious to the Church. Or, if this example satisfie you not, Can. 62. the same Councell made a decree, that 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . 
               no man should put on womans raiment. Whereto, being pressed by me, whē you reply that the voice of the Church therein may be interpreted by them who are of your minde; you acknowlege, that, taking it in the right sense, it is the Churches iudgement. And the sense thereof by Of the text of Scripture, Deut. 22. 5. where the Greeke trā
                  slation hath, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  : the very woords vsed by the Councell. your interpretation of putting on, or wearing, must be that none may doe it commonly. So, the Councell speaking of doeing it in playes, you graunt that the Churches iudgement is against it as common players vse to practise it. But greater assemblies of Christians then that Councell, allow it in common players: the Curtaine and Theater can tell so much. Neither will you say, that common players are approoved by the Churches iudgement. For, the Churches iudgement you professe obedience too: yet Histrioniam accusas? Non defendo sed famam, pudorem, at

               cōmon players you condemne. The lesser part therefore in number may sometime denominate the whole; and the greater may not. Which if wee apply to the case in question, it is playne you should not have vrged the Universities iudgement for your playes, although the greater part thereof had approoved them. For, the chiefest cause that moved the governours of our Vniversitie, the Uicechancellour and Convocation, to forbidde by

               statute the vse of common playes among vs, was, The Vniuersitie statute against common stageplayers: made in the yeare 1584. 
               least the younger sort should be spectators of so many lewde and evil sports as in them are practised. Now, reason doeth give, that men of vnderstanding, who, through a godly care of the good training vp of youth, restrayned them from seeing those playes, because of such sportes; must thinke it inconvenient for them to see such sportes in what soever playes, even in your Rivales. And, if inconvenient to see such sportes onely, much more to play and represent such: the representing of them beeing so farre woorse, then the beholding, in De legib. lib. 7. 
               Platos iudgement, that

                  . 
               they would be seene and knowne, hee sayeth, because their contraries, honest things and serious, can not be knowen without them, if one intend to bee wise; but

               practise both them, and their contraries, it is impossible, if one intende to have as much as a sparke of vertue. Our gouvernours might thinke more hopefully, then Plato, that vertuous youths may doe them both: and Plato peradventure meant by impossible, very hard, as De Vniversi.

               beside bondslaves & mercenarie strangers to imitate and expresse them: the guides of our Universitie should deeme it convenient for youths to be actors of loose and wanton prankes, whereof to be spectatours, they have pronounced it vnmeete and hurtfull for them. Wherefore, what soeuer the greater part approoved with their harty applause, I am perswaded still that you did wrong in vrging the Universities iudgement as making for your playes. No lesse in a manner, then if one beholding a great number of Scholers playing in winter time at footeball, should saye, the Universities iudgement doeth approove it. Which I contrariewise should be so farre from thinking, that if any graver man were looking on them, or touched the ball with his foote, I would take it rather to savour of affection borne to some playing thereat, then of iudgement.
            
            As for the worshipfull, and sometimes honorable presence at your playes, you might seeme to presse it against me with more credit,

if honorable and worshipfull persons never vsed to grace any playes, saue onely yours, with their presence. But if they be present at common playes also, such as our Vniversitie-statute banisheth hence, and your selfe make offer that Histrioniam ipsam vel tecum accusabo, si voles. 
               you will ioyne with me in writing aginst the players thereof, if I will: consider with your selfe what you would aunswere to this argument alleaged by those players, and let the same serve on my behalfe to yours. For a supply whereof I adde, that worthy personages, who, vpon intreatty, become your spectators, perhaps thinke with Plato, that the seeing of Comedies played can doe no harme, of tragedies may be dangerous; perhaps incline to Aristotle, that they both may safely bee seene by elder folke, not by younger: and so, though them selves beholde one, or both, yet doe they warrant neither of the pointes you strive for; I meane, that either students of Christ-church may bee actors, or the youth of Oxford spectators of your playes.

This corruption of maners was not bredde by other exercises and masteries tried, in those games, but by the stage-playes, as a Petr

               Plinies owne speech, concerning sundry kindes of games among the Romans, maketh it most probable, that he meant, the corruption grew from stage-playes chiefly, if not from them alone.
            But when the Uiennians playes were taken away by Trebonius Rufinus, a governour of theirs, and he was accused to the Emperour for it: Iunius Mauricus, a graue and faithfull Counseller, being asked by the Emperour, what he thought thereof, said, Non esse restituendū Viennensibus agôna. 
               it was not meete the playes should be restored againe to the Viennians; adding, Vellem etiam Romae tolli posset. 
               I would to God they might be taken away at Rome too. Which corollarie of his sentence touching playes at Rome, it may bee, that as Viennensium vitia intra ipsos residunt: nostra late vagantur. Vtque in corporibus, si

Whether the taking of them away at Oxford too, haue bene wished by any of the Counsellers, who might bee notwithstanding present with her Highnes, as Plinie & Mauricus of likelyhoode were with Trajan at the playes in Rome: you and I are not so neere of their counsell, that we can define. But thus much I may say, and say it vpon knowledge, that, if your Comedie had still as homely speeches (to say no worse) as it had when your Prolog. in Rivales comaediam: actam Febr. 1591.

               Cyprian had sett down in writing, that Peter, whom the Lord chose his

               the Church had sifted the truth in a generall Councell, and agreed of it; so the knowledge of the same engraven in those learned and godlie men, whom you speake of, induceth me to thinke that when they shall haue weighed what grounds of Gods woord, what consent of the Church, what Councels, what Fathers, impugne their opinion, they will not approove your obstinat striving for it. It may bee, that they will mislike of your art too, in that, for the surer vniting of them to you, and stirring them vpp against mee, you doe not onelie affirme that they are exceedinglie tainted in honour, if playes, which they

               allow of, bee iustlie disallowed by mee: but also, that it were a great reproche to them, though not so exceedingly great, as is the other, yet a great reproch, at any time to haue bene acquainted with things of so vile and base qualitie. For why? Is the writing of Comedies, or tragedies, but what speake I of writing? in mentioning whereof your art appeereth farther, sith I condemned it not: is the playing of them made by mee a thing of so vile and base qualitie, as persequuting, or blaspheming? Yet Saint Paul thought it no great disgrace for him, 
               1. Tim. 1. 13 
               in former time to have bene a blaspemer, and a persequuter, when ver. 12. he was now become a faithfull minister of Christ: no more then for the Romans 
               Rom. 6. 17. 
               to haue bene slaves of sinne, when they did now obey the doctrine of the Gospell; or for Abraham 
               Ios. 24. 2. to haue bene in the land of Chaldaea & served other Gods there; when Gen 12. 5. he came now to Chanaan. and s ver. 8.

Againe, what reason have you to say that a much greater reproch it were to them, still to allow of playes: when you commend St Cyprian as a man of singular godlines, and zeale, Epist. 70. sequen

For as he folowed Epist. 71. & 73. his predecessors in this errour, and therfore was the more excusable: so had the reverend men, whom you alleage, their predecessors that trained them to the liking of playes. Neither is it probable that they have bene advertised of their oversight by any such mans writing, as Cyprian was by Vincent. Lirin. contr. haer. cap. 9.

               Austin could finde, a man most likely to haue found it, had there bene ought that could haue shewed it. Wherefore it savoureth stronglie of a bad qualitie, that you would perswade them, they must by my iudgement bee noted and disgraced with a fowle exceeding great reproche and infamie, if they allow of playes still. Much woorse doeth it savour, that you beare them in hand, although their mindes should alter and thinke hereof when they praye, Psal. 25. 7. 
               Remember

not, O Lord; the sinnes of my youth, it must bee neverthelesse a great reproche vnto them, at anie time to have bene acquainted with the writing and playing of such matters.

The same did you likewise confesse of sundry Fathers vpon the same occasion, & namely of Saint Cyprian; whom here notwithstāding you doe namelie mention as making not against you: yea, whom you moreover doe sett downe for a speciall paterne of the rest, to inferre the generall, that none of all the Fathers or Councells doe reproove your playes.

Thus labour you to face it out that your playes are not reproched by the Fathers, as dealing forsooth, iust like Saint Cyprian

               Fathers, as holy men of God, haue written many Zealous and most godly things against the amphitheatricall sights of their times: but distinguish the times, the places, the qualities of the sights and actors, and the vse from the abuse; and it is evident by that which Machiavell saith, that swoord-playes of our age are

not reproched by them. A very true sentence, that, no dout the Fathers haue written many zealous and most godly thinges against those sights of both sorts: and likewise true, no dout, that it is as evident by Machiavels discourse, that, if such swoordplayes should now be vsed in London, as were then at Rome, the Fathers checke them not; as it is by yours, that the Fathers doe not repoche the same stage-playes of Plautus, Terence, Seneca, or woorse (which comparison Rivales may well beare) played here, of late, among vs. Wherefore it had bene better for your credit to conteine your selfe within generalities, by saying that men mistake the Fathers: as Machiavell contented him selfe to say in grosse, that base and cowardly wretches have misse-interpreted our religion. For then I could not haue blamed you about particulars; your policie had prevented me, as it hath in Chrysostome: whose testimonie, Homil. 56. in Gen.

Now, when you affirme that Cyprian, and the rest, writing against the theatricall sights of their times, doe not write against such as in our time are vsed: I must needes tell you, that you shew lesse conscience and singlenes in your writing, then to whom you ought and easily might excell in all religious duties, Bodinus, and Lipsius. Of whom Bodin. de repub. li. 6. ca. 1 the one, declaring what neede there is for Censors for theaters of our time, alleageth sundry Fathers, and namelie Cyprian, against them: yea, that very epistle of Lib. 2. ep. 2.

But, with whatsoever cunning or boldnes, you blinde the eyes of children, and make them beleeve that these ancient Prophets write not against your fansie: the praise given by you to our owne Prophets, those reverend and famous persons now living, causeth me to feare I was too faint when I said, They will not approove your obstinate striving for it; I should haue said, They

will not approove your bare opinion or this, will, is also too faint; They doe not approove it. For, being excellent men in life, they love modestie, and yeeld vnto the knowen truth. Beeing excellent in learning, they know that your theatricall sights are of the same kinde, that the Fathers have decreed in their Councells, and written in their bookes against. The thinges which the Fathers have decreed and written, are not only zealous, but also most godly, as you say. Most godly; therefore consonant to the holy Scriptures: on the ground whereof it is expressely noted by In the place aboue quoted. 
               Epiphanius likewise that

               the churches doctrine and ordinances were framed. And how can it bee thought then with any likelyhoode, that those reverend persons doe approove your stage-playes: which, by all presumptions, and your own verdict, they know that the Church, the Fathers, the Councels, the Scriptures have condemned? In deede if they were Papists, and such as would rather put on the shamelesse forehead of the hoore of Babylon, then confesse them selves to have bene overseene: a man might haue reason to think, that their owne doeings they would still allow of. For, wheras the profane and wicked toyes of Passion-playes, playes setting foorth Christs passion, procured Magno scelere atque impretate sacerdotum, qui eiusmodi fieri curant: faith Viues. by Popish Priests, who, being 2 Cor. 11. 3

               ordered, for their Province, that the Passion shall not bee played hereafter any where: yet (for feare of breeding a scruple in mens mindes that their Church might erre) they say, Pie introducta consuetudo repraesentandi populo venerandam Christi Domini passionem. 
               it was a custome religiously brought in. So loth are ambitious spirits to acknowledge

their oversights and faults. But seeing that our reverend Pastors and Doctors haue an other spirit, as Numb. 14. 24. he saith of Caleb, and professe a purer religion then Papists: you must give mee leave to suspect rather that you charge them wrongfully, then that men of excellent godlines and wisdome doo allow and thinke well of so manifold evills, as in your playes I haue disclosed.
            And thus, a great deale later then my desire and hope was, but as soone as sicknes and busines would permit, haue you that performed, which in your conclusion, by woords, you request me to forbeare the doeing of; in your whole discourse, by deedes, you haue induced and vrged mee to vndertake. The reason added by you to move mee to forbeare it, namely, that I have some thing else to doe, then to trouble my selfe, and my better studies, with a matter of this nature and moment; I knowe not whether it would haue seemed sound to others, sure to mee it did not. For, if I had lived among the Iewes at that time, when 2. Maccab. 4. 14.

With whom I have also greater cause to hope that I shall prevaile, then he had with Alipius, because your selfe tell me, that you doe and ever will most gladly embrace, not onely my good will, but also my iudgement in this cause so farre as I write in the generall against stage-players. For I am perswaded that their opinions of me are as kinde as yours: and then doe they agree with me in a maner about the point wee treate of. They will agree wholy, if they weigh advisedlie one rule, which L. 147.

               the generall doeth evermore comprise the speciall. The Lord behold both them, and you, in his mercy: and giue you all his grace to know the way that leadeth vnto life eternall, and to walke therein.

                  NON feres, opinor, aegrè, missa haec à me in vulgus, quae unum habent, & alterum aliter, atque tu senseris, & docueris. Neque enim ego contra te stare volui, à quo steti semper, & Deo faciente stabo: sed adversus alios disputavi, quos sequi non potui: eos etsi tu sequereris, & ad probares. Rogavi te coram de utraque quaestione: nec tamen audire à te nisi nudam sententiam tuam valui. Petii etiam à communi amico nostro Errico Cuffio, ut de te ipsum hoc sciscitaretur, si mihi autor esses, ut commentationes istas typis mandarem. Sed aut te convenire ille non potuit: aut accepit nihil, quod responderet. Audi, mi Rainolde: quaestionem de histrionibus publicè ego tractavi antea quam tibi haec quaestio cum altero esset. Itaque ipsam demere nunc de corpore reliquo, honestum non fuerit. Imo ad me spectare videtur, defendere semper jus civile, quod profiteor, & quod semper iustissimum observavi.

            QVae duo per epistolam, erudite Gentilis, à me videris petere, ea tibi lubens ambo concedo: alterum, ne aegrè feram commentarium à te in lucem editum, quimeam sententiam de Samuele pythonissae, & histrionibus oppugnet; alterum, ut literas chartasque tuas sic accipiam, ne me in opere, quod aggredior, vel tantillum morentur. Cur enim ego tibi magis irascar, quod de Samuele adversus 26. q. 5. c. nec mirum. Augustinum, aliosque theologos à Praelectionib ad Eccle. cap 46. me citatos disputes; aut quaestionem do histrionibus publicè tractâris antea quàm ego de iis cum altero controversarer: quàm tu succenseas mihi, quòd probationes opiniones tuae à De purgatorio, li. 2. ca. 6. Bellarmino propositas iam pridem convellerim; & à pestibus scenicorum spectaculisque theatralibus Praefat. thes. ad Acad. Oxon. nostros dehortatus sim, prius quàm tu cathedram istam, ex qua ludios laudas, occupares. Nihil autem esse quamobrē me chartae tuae remorentur, verissimo colligis argumento: Neque enim tanti sunt, inquis. Huc accedit, quod actum agere vetamur proverbio. Et ego, in meis adversus Bellarminum de Samuele praelectionibus, rationes omnes, quibus Comment. adl b. c. de malef. & mathemat. contendis Samuelem ipsum à pythonissa evocatum, satis superque refutavi. Binis porrò literis, quas ad familiarem tuum de ludis ludionibusque, uti scis, scripsi, ea quae ex Platone, Aristotele, Tertulliano, Augustino, Aquinate, aliisque citas, aut falsò, aut frustra urgeri, planum feci. Quin & ipse, quum fabularum, quales Terentianae sunt, verbis factisque inhonestis & improbis aspersae, actores pronuntias jure improbari, sententiam meam astruis. Nam Vlysses redux, Hippolytus, & Rivales (de quibus amici tui Momus hanc quae nobis est litem excitavit) non minus illis vitiis laborant, quàm nonnullae, immò Rivales multo magis, quàm ulla, Terentii. Itaque licet quaedam Comment. adl 3. c. de professorib. & med. addas refutatu forsitan non indigna, ut quod mimos asseris habitu muliebri egisse personam viri, lenonis, adulteri, temulenti, ne temulenti in Rivalibus eorum similes videantur; & Athenae. li. 1 Theophrasti exemplo, qui in schola docens, ita omnes gestus rei, quam tractabat, congruentes

Ac eo quidem facio libentius quae cupis, quoniam impetrare à te vicissim aveo, ut, si qua deinceps typis excudes, in iis duarum rerum maiorem habeas rationem; pietatis, & modestiae. Pietatis dico, non tam ob eam causam quod theologorū autoritate in rebus religionis te valde moveri dicas, in rebus morum non valde; quanquam ob eam quoque; nam Exod. 20. 2. 2.

Praetereà, quum adiungis te aliâs hoe explicasse, amandas nos ad similem De jure bell. comment. a. commentationem, in qua id confirmas Heliodori, gravis scilicet autoris, iudicio, & isto Poëtae nescio cuius versu, Quum vitia prosunt, peccat qui rectè facit. Qua sententia quid potest fingi flagitiosius, impurius, execrabilius? Et tamen quo magis eam, eiusque scopum, adversus Dei verbum, cuius memini, praemunias, Scito (inquis) in tota hac disputatione non me ullibi dicere mala facienda ut bona adveniant, sed abusum malorum malum non esse, at bonum. Ita, quia mendaciis curantur melancholici,

ut ibidem adiicis, quemadmodum hîc & morbos per spectacula curari notas: distinguis, hunc abusum, quem vocas, mendacii bonum esse, non malum; neque verbo Dei disputatione tua contradici. Quo genere argutiolae, stuprum, adulterium, incestum, & quid non? defendere licebit. Nam Appian. de bell. Syriac. Plutarch. vita Demetr. Antiochus, Seleuci filius, contrahendis incestis cum noverca nuptiis, è gravissimo evasit morbo: ac licet incestus sit malus, nec committendus ut adveniat bonum; tamen abusus malorum (ut tu doces) malus non est, sed bonus. Hujusmodi fundamenta impietatis & nequitiae vehementer peto ne amplius nobis iacias; praesertim in operibus quae typis evulgabis; idque in Academia nostra; & viro clarissimo, insigni ecclesiae lumini, dedicatis; ac ita dedicatis, ut etiam eius filio, lectissimo, & summae spei puero, Tobiae, legenda commendentur. Vides enim quanto cum dedecore nostro fama, à comitiis nostris, quoquoversum perlatura sit, pueros, quibus maximam deberi reverentiam profanus Iuven. sat. 14 poëta sensuit, in nostra Academia publicè doceri ut de rebus morum quid theologi sentiant non magnopere curent; neque vereantur mentiri quum erit commodum; immò peccare se putent, si, quum vitia prosunt, rectè faciant; & malorum quidem usum Dei verbo condemnari credant, sed abusum malorum malum esse negent, bonum contendant. Modestiae verò plus in tuis scriptis idcirco desidero, quod Deut. 22. 5. Deuteronomii locum interpretatus aliter ac theologi, ac patres, ac concilia, quemadmodum declaravi, concludis hoc epiphonemate: Nihil facit lex illa Dei adversus histrioniam; & minus nihilo aliud, quicquid theologi afferunt. Dixeras paulo prius te theologorum autoritate in rebus religionis moveri valde: & scripturarum interpretatio res est religionis. Quanto consultius veterum Romanorum laudatam à M. Orat. pro Fonteio. Tullio consuetudinem sequutus esses, ut arbitrari te diceres etiam quae scires, quàm ut tam fidenter quod nescis affirmares. Nam, quod legem Mosis, Non induetur mulier veste virili, nec vir utetur veste foeminea, interpretaris, contra omnes theologos, non propriè, sed figuratè; non de vestibus, sed de flagitio retectis vestibus commisso: hujus rei probationem, etsi petitione principii tantùm nixam, tamen fidenter item asseris percunctando; Nam

additur ibi, inquis, Abominabilis apud Deum est, qui facit haec; quod autem scelus hîc est, ut sit abominatio? Minimè quidem miror, te, quem theologorum autoritas non movet in re religionis, in qua te permultum illis tribuere profiteris verbo, atque adeò in scriptis modò affirmaveras; ita eorum disputationes de histrionia, re nimirum morali, floccifacere, ut quicquid theologi contra eam afferunt, id omne minus nihilo esse assevêres. Quamquam hoc minus nihilo esse aliquid, familiaris tuus, tametsi tuis istis magnis multisque adiutus, suo fortasse ad meas literas, vel responso docebit, vel silentio. Sed utut haec sese habeant, modestiam quidem certè in pronuntiando maiorem ut adhibeas, praesertim quum de rebus religionis agis, tua te ipsius experientia, in rebus morum, immò iuris admonere debet.

                   positum a veritate. Quid enim tu me impietatis, & nequitiae dicis architectum in quaestione de mendacio officioso, in qua ipsum hoc non intelligis, quid sit officiosum mendacium? Etenim meministi, recensuisse te Petri illud in officiosis, quod contra omne officium fidei, & religionis suit. Quid me impurissimo assimulas

principi, si imò reliqui nullum tibi in eadem quaestione scriptorem extra theologos, at alios omnes nec sine theologis mecum facere explicavi? Te ad epistolas meas amando: caeteros ad libros magis, quàm ad commentationes, de iure belli; quos exituros aliquando, praemonui dedicatione prima ad illustrissimum Comitem: &, Deo volente, edam brevi. Tuae enim istiusmodi admonitiones non tenent me, quem aut in ea parte non improbant viri in Ecclesia, & republica vestra clarissimi, & laudatissimi. Quid me modestiae laesae facis tu reum, qui nunc ex papistico spiritu arces me à tractatione librorum sacrorum: Et, quod Erastus ait similibus tui, non vides, tentare haec te cis, annos istos septuaginta? Non vides, te cum eo sic agere imperiose, qui Papae imperium contempsit, & exulare patria potuit, & universo regno Papali? Uerissima ferunt, qui haec ferunt: et in his tu vinceris à me, qui pro pietate me obiurgas tamen. Communes sunt sacri libri; & in his, quae spectant ad secundam tabulam, nostri magis, quàm vestri. Sic ut, autoritati theologorum valde nos tribuere hîc, minimè necesse sit. Doce contrarium tu, si potes. Noli calumniari, me pueros docere, ut de rebus morum non magnopere curent, quid sentiant theologi. nam de me, de iurisconsulto scripsi, & re politica. De re religionis quod scripsi, id sentio: & in ea seriò theologorum valde tribuo autoritati. Sed res religionis quid est? Scripturarum interpretatio omnis, aut omnium, non est res religionis. Theologia fidei, & vitae magistra est. sed non omnis vitae. nec omnis pars sermonum Dei in solidum vestra est. Ostende diversum, audiam. De rationibus theologorum in quaestione ista de histrionibus sic censui, ut quas contra histriones illos publicè mercenarios, & indignarum fabularum actores habent, eae nihili non sint. Sed quae sunt adversùs omnem histrioniam, eas minus nihilo esse, asserui, & verò etiamnum assero. Pudet earum me, quas Tertullianus, quem unum è nostris iurisconsultis opinantur, adfert adversùs cothurnos tragicos, & fictas scoenicorum personas. Quam etiam obtrudere pro Potentissima videtur, esse nihili, demonstravi. Nec fidenter (ut tu ais) adfirmo, quod nescio: sed tu reprehendis confidentissimè, quae non capis. Audi, audi. Quae in histrionia vitari peccata negotio nullo saepe solent, & possunt semper; ea nihil contra histrioniam faciunt. Sed peccatum illud, si quod est, promiscui vestimentorum

usus vitari saepe solet, & semper potest. Ergo. Qui sensus bonarum aliarum legum est prohibentium hunc usum vestium, idem verisimiliter est & bonae legis Dei. Sed aliarum legum sensus nihil facit contra histrioniam. Abomin tio ubi dicitur in Scripturis, ibi peccatum significatur, quod facilè superet flagitia pleraque omnia. Sed hoc vestimentorum non est tale. Ergo ubi dicitur abominatio, ibi hoc peccatum non significatur. Et ubi propria significatio non accipitur, ibi figurata fuerit, vel aliter impropria. at in lege illa Dei propria significatio non accipitur. Quae autem figurata locutio sic exponitur, ut verae sententiae conveniat, & aliis similibus locis stabiliatur, ea benè exposita est. Sed sic exponitur à me figurata illa locutio. Utinam, utinam sic contenderes, & non reijceres argumentis bonis fabulas non bonas semper: quibus illudere pueris potes, nobis non potes. De Augustini sententia, & de sententia Aquinatis ad eundem locum, quas recitavi, & falso, aut frustra urgeri adfirmas, nihil nunc dico, quando tu me ablegas ad scripta tua Anglicana: nisi illud tacendum non sit, ex sententia utriusque adfirmarique, peccatum vestiarium non esse flagitiosissimum. Mea sunt reliqua. Et ea (falleris) non dixi nihili esse, quae tu nunquam refutaveris, si tibi sententiam non pronuncias: sed quae aut te, aut me, aut alium morari ab operibus maioribus tantillum non debeant. Nec morabitur me sanè quaestio haec. Itaque nec à te literas alias de ea expecto, nec expeto. Ego cupiam à te iterum audire, quae à te primo convicia audivi in vita? cupiam illa? priusquam tu cathedram istam, ex qua ludios laudas, occupares. Ego ludios non laudo, sed tu cum convicio ludis genere istoe loquendi laudatissimo, & per suasorias Senecae per suasissimo tibi. Ego cathedram istam non occupo, quam bonis adprobantibus teneo de principis optima, & humanissimae largitate: & in qua sic doceo, ut benignitatis suae reginam serenissimam, iudicii reliquos non poeniteat. Magna ego horum nomina defendo in commentatione mea de histrionibus. Si enim Tobias Matthaeus, si alii tot viri gravissimi, & religiosissimi ist haec iuventutis aut exercitamenta, aut ludos adprobarunt, praefecti, & moderatores collegiorum, atque totius lumina academiae: si princeps sanctissima, religionis summum praesidium, &

Et de nostris in eodem proposito, par est culpa, spectacula edere, & spectare spectacula. Neque bic me damnabit Matthaeus. neque enim sic contaminavi nomen eius, ut put as tu, dedicatione libelli mei: ne

Tota haec tua epistola, praeter maledicta, aut his constat, quae ad te non spectant: aut his, quae non spectant ad me: aut, quae non ad rem, quae in manibus est: aut si quid habet aliud, id vnum est, quod tu meae commentationis verba non legisti, aut non expendisti bene. Nec enim scripsi ego, oratori necessariam histrioniam, sed poëmatibus: & it a argumentatus sum, Si eius, quod leve, & importunum est in oratoria, ut est actio, habetur ratio tanquam necessarii: eius etiam, quod leve, & importunum est in poetica, habenda ratio est tanquam necessarii. hoc autem histrionia est. Ergo in poetica habenda sic est ratio histrioniae. Rursus dum docui ex Alciato, eum non facere artem, qui semel, iterum quid artis facit, sic argumentor, Ars notata est edicto. Sed unaproditio non est ars. Ergo una proditio non est notata. Alciato ego illud non tribuo: quanquam est erratum in subnotato capite, quod esse debuit ccv II. De Laberio plus satis. De oratoribus, & vatibus subieci, ut mores illius populi antiquos magis ostenderem: de quibus sanè illi apud Tacitum disceptaebant: & secundum quos visum etiam crimen maiestatis laesae, si magistratus pro concione legisset velcodices (ni malè memini) eorum, quae ad magistratus spectabant tamen. Sed & dixi, in scaena fuisse eos oratores, & vates. Sed & pretii, aut praemii spe, atque fiducia recitationibus incubuisse, persuasum est mihi. Itaque, tribus his convenientibus, censura à patriis moribus, recitatione in scaena, & spe praemii, notati. Itaque falsum tu colligis, notatos semper omnes qui etiam gratis recitarent.

Atque (ut caetera, quae confuse carpis, ordine percurram) quod ego commemoravi me à pestibus scenicorum spectaculisque theatralibus nostros dehortatum, prius quàm tu cathedram istam, ex qua ludios laudas, occupares; ut hinc commonefieres, tibi, qui sententiam tuam in vulgus editam negabasaegrè ferre me oportere, quòd quaestionem de histrionibus publicè tractasses anteà quàm ego de iis cum altero controversarer, pari ratione ferendam aegrè non esse meam à sententia tua dissensionem, quòd mihi periculosos videri ludios docuissem prius quàm hic tibi locus laudandi eos foret: in eo vociferaris te à me convicia, quae nunquam à

Ita, cùm vocabula, tenere, & occupare, idem significent, quemadmodum ex Trinumm. Plauto, Aeneid. lib. 6 Virgilio, Hortens. Cicerone, observavit De propriet. serm. cap. 4. Nonius; atque hoc sensu ego (quod sanctè affirmare possum) illud usurparim: tu absurdam mihi calumniam affingis, ac si dixissem te professionis locum, non Reginae nostrae beneficio, sed vi, aut fraude, aut nescio quo modo, possidere. Similiter affirmas te ludios non laudare, sed me cum convicio ludere genere istoc loquendi laudatissimo, & per suasorias Senecae persuasissimo mihi. In quo quid istoc loquendi genere significes, fateor, non intelligo: dicturus alioqui ad illud quod è Seneca vitio mihi vertis.

Parem esse culpam non ausim tecum dicere. Nam De spectac. cap. 17. Tertullianus ibidem, & rectissimè, Cur liceat audire, quae loqui non licet? Neque tamen arbitror aequè peccare eum qui maledico aut scurrae praebet aures, ac maledicū & scurram ipsum. Sed ego ad illorum luminum approbantium spectantiúmve ludos iudicia, & exempla, familiari tuo dudum Epist. 2. respondi: ut, si tibi rursum respondeam, actum agam; quod me facturum negavi. Tu, qui possis ludorum, Rivalibus nostris (ut docui) puriorum, non actores solùm sed etiam autores iure improbatos pronuntiare, ipse videris: cùm scias spectatores fuisse Rivalium sanctissimam Principem caeterosque; & in pari culpa eos, qui spectant talia, cum iis qui edunt, ponas. Nam quod tu Terentii simihumque fabulas verbis factisque inhonestis & improbis aspersas esse scribis, ideoque earum actores iure improbas propter corruprelam & contagionem: idem ego, pestes

            Quod eo magis opus fuisse ut facerem jam sentio & cerno, quia, quae mihi maximè omnium capitalis sententia vide batur, nempe, abusum malorum non esse malum, sed bonum: eam tu significas te in libris bellicis denuò defensurum; & ita defensurum, ut ab argutiolae, quam dixi, opprobrio distinctionem tuam vindices Augustini & Lactantii autoritate. Quid igitur? An argumentum meum, quo stuprum, adulterium, incestum, & quodvis facinus ac flagitium ea argutiola defendi posse docui, Augustini etiam atque Lactantii autoritate profligabis? Omnino, tanquam aliquid tale cogitares, postquàm ex eorum altero notasses, bonum in nuptiis esse usum mali concupiscentiae carnis; ex altero, vitia non esse quibus rectè uti licet: Sic, inquis, uti possumus concupiscentia carnis; sic mendacio; &c. Vbi, si particula ista, &c. non referatur ad incestum, & caetera mala à me commemorata; quod (opinor) abominabere; quanquam quae ad alia referatut, non video; sed si ad ea non referatur: argumentum igitur meum ab exemplo Antiochi & novercae, ita solidum & firmum, ut ne attingere quidem illud ausus sis, satis adhuc habet ad mei dicti veritatem de vanitate argutiolae tuae comprobandam.

Augustinus ait eos concupiscentiae malo bene uti qui licitè procreandis liberis operam dant, Li. 1. cap. 7. ut pede vitiato rectè quis utitur quum ad aliquod bonum claudicando pervenit: nec propter claudicationis malum mala est illa perventio, nec propter illius perventionis bonum bona est claudicatio. Tu bonum esse mali usum sic contendis, ut malum mendacii, ceu claudicationis, malum esse neges, quum eo quis ad bonū pervenit: & eum, cui Deus pedes dedit integros, se mutilare iubes, ut aliquò accedat quò nulli nisi claudo fortasse datur aditus. Divin. instit. lib. 6. cap. 16 Lactantius, ad errorem quorundam minuendum qui affectus vitia esse concedunt, sed ea mediocriter temperant: assignandi, inquit, fuerunt affectus certis temporibus, & rebus, & locis: ne vitia sint quibus rectè uti licet. Tu vocabulum eius, rectè, ad omnes circumstantias relatum, de quibus Ethicor. lib. 2. cap. 4. & 6 Aristoteles quum distinguit iusta ab iis quae iustè fiunt, & virtutis naturam aperit, ad unicam restringis: & mendacia in rectum finem destinata, (quo modo possunt periuria, sacrilegia, blasphemiae,) rectè fieri dicis, eoque non esse vitia.

Immò verò, inquis, de me, de jurisconsulto scripsi, & re politica. De te? de jurisconsulto? Atqui, & Petrus, quum Gal. 2. 12. subduxit sese ac separavit à Gentibus, respondere potuit se respectu sui, Iudaei, id fecisse: cui tamen Paulus dixit, Cur Gentes cogis Iudaizare? quòd iis exemplo suo hac in re praeiret; ut tu, nec solùm exemplo, sed etiam verbo, pueris. De politica autem re, quid tibi vis? aut qui hoc ausus dicere? cùm Comment. ad l. 3. de prof. med. pag 60. verba tua typis excusa sic habeant; Ego ut theologorum autoritate in re religionis valde moveor, ita in re morali, aut politica non valde. Adeóne mei reprehendendi aestu te transversum abripi, ut in eo mihi notam calumniae, in quo calumniaris ipse, inuras?
            Locum scripturae de veste viri à foemina, foeminae à viro non induenda, quem theologi omnes interpretantur propriè, figuratè à te exponi mirabar eo magis: quod theologorum autoritate in rebus religionis te valde moveri dixeras; & scripturarum interpretatio res est religionis. Hîc tu scripturarum interpretationem omnem, aut omnium, rem religionis esse inficiaris. Omnem, quorsum addis? Nam ne legum quidem interpretatio omnis res est jurisprudentiae: sed ea, cuius gratia, De jur. inter. dialog. 1. scribis Canonistas, maiorum nostrorū tempore, ad Legistas remisisse auditores suos, si incideret argumentum ex legibus componendum. Et talis est quam nos quaerimus: non qualem adhibeant qui à te ridentur, quòd nunc, benigniori scilicet coelo nati, non modò utriusque iuris doctores existunt, sed & Medicinae periti, & Theologiae. Quum autem is inficias Scripturarum omnium interpretationem rem esse religionis, & ad facultatem theologicam spectare: perinde mihi loqui videris, acsi quis diceret, non omnes leges vestras & totum ius civile ab Accursianis aut Alceiateis interpretibus exponi oportere. Sed, ut hoc absurdum tibi visum iri dialogi tui docent: ita & illud debuit. Quod, si mihi non credis, crede Comment. in 1. epist. ad cor. praefat. Petro Martyri, quem theologorum maximum De jure bell. comment. 1. appellas: & ab Orat, ad Acad. Argenti. de studio theolog. eo disce facultatem nostram à vestra

distinguere. Ac vide quàm scienter huic scripturae loco, cuius exponendi ius, abiudicatum nobis, tibi vindicas, sensum figuratum & improprium affingas. Deut. 22. 5. Ne esto instrumentum virile super foeminam, inquit Moses, neque induito vir vestem foeminae: nam abominationi est Iehovae Deo tuo quisquis facit ista. Hac lege, Ne induito vir vestem foeminae, tu, per nescio quam figuram orationis, vis nefarium illud scelus denotari, quod Moses Lev. 18. ver. 22. alibi verbis propriè sumptis damnans abominationem vocavit: &, sicut in Levitico, verbo Ver. 6. 7. &c. retectionis quasi vestimentorum significantur talia flagitia; ita in lege hac, simili loquendi modo, par crimen proponi. Satis id quidem duriter, ut idem planè sonet induere vestem, ac retegere: & hoccine est quod ais expositionem tuam similibus locis stabiliri? Verùm exponendam ita esse legem confirmas hunc in modum. Vbi significatio propria non accipitur, ibi figurata fuerit, vel aliter impropria. At in lege illa Dei non accipitur propria significatio. Quid ita? Quoniam, inquis, Vbi abominatio dicitur in scripturis, ibi peccatum significatur, quod facilè superet flagitia pleraque omnia. Sed hoc vestimentorum non est tale. Ergo ubi dicitur abominatio, ibi hoc peccatum non significatur. Ac non esse tale hoc vestimentorū, affirmari ais ex sententia Soliloq. lib. 2 cap. 16. Augustini. Quem, si consideratius animum attendisses ad inexcusabiles in quas ait decidi posse turpitudines hac lege negligenda: vidisses minus causae subesse, quàm putabas, cur pro te citares. Sed unde tandem colligis, ubicun

               , id enim sonat tuum ubi, aut nihil agis; ubicunque igitur abominatio in scripturis dicitur, ibi significari peccatum quod facilè flagitia pleraque omnia superet? Nam Deut. 7. 25. abominationi Iehovae esse dicitur argentum & aurum, de quo idôla facta sint: & quicunque insert illum in domum suam, rem inferre dicitur abominabilem. Deut. 17. 1. Abominationi Iehovae esse dicitur bovis aut pecudis ullum habentis vitium immolatio. De quibus, si volueris tibi constare, & sententiam ei quam de Deut. 22. 5. nostra lege Quod tantū scelus hic est, ut sit abominatio? tulisti, ferre similem, rogabis mirabundus: Quod tantum scelus hîc est, ut sit abominatio, si, cui desunt opes, aliquid è Baalis auro aut argento in usum suum accipiat? si, qui meliorem victimam non habet, claudam, aut caecam Deo offerat? Quod si prudentius &

               uoque ipsius aliud agentis dicto comprobatur, dum ais, qui sensus bonarum aliarum legum est prohibentium hunc usum vestium, eundem verisimiliter esse & legis Dei. Nam aliae bonae leges C. 6. dist. 30. Canonicae, L. 23. D. de aur. & arg. leg. Civilesque, à teipso notatae, loquuntur de vestitu non figuratè, sed propriè, ut scis & confiteris.
            Legem autem illam Dei nihil facere adversus histrioniam, quod fidentius aequo à te dictum censui, conaris astruere duobus argumentis. Quorum alterum superiore nixum fundamento, vitiosè adiicit, sensum aliarum bonarum legum nihil facere contra histrioniam; ergo neque bonae ilhus legis Dei. Nam primò lex canonica, à Sext. synod. in Trull. can. 62. multò ampliore synodo sancita, quàm Synod. Gan. can. 13. Gratian. c. 6. dist. 30. quae à te notatur, vetat in ludicris eum usum vestium, ut Epist. 1. & 2 ad doct. Gag. alibi declaravi. Civili verò jure idem interdictum existimasse videtur Soliloq. lib. 2. cap. 16. Augustinus, ad histriones accommodans quod jure infames & intestabiles haberi, qui muliebri habitu se ostentant, dixerat. Atque adeò Orat. ad Grae. Tatiani verba reprehendentis vestem muliebrem in scenicis actoribus, ut indignam viro, Ad Iul. Pau. recept. sentent. lib. 3. tit. 6. Cujacius arbitratus est cum vestrorum jurisconsultorum sensu congruere, & post Cuiacium Ad l. 23. D. de aur. & arg. leg. Gothofredus. Deinde, etiamsi aliae bonae leges diuturniorem & graviorem abusum tantummodò vetarent, quem Tacit. anna. lib. 3. ne lege quidem coerceri voluit Tiberius Imperator: tamen lege Dei, multo meliore, notari possent & coargui, quilevius, quomodocunque, & quantulocunque tempore, in ea re delinquerent. Nam L. 3. §. 18. D. de acquir. vel amitt. possess. aliae bonae leges negant furtum animo posse committi, sine contrectatione: Matt. 5. 28. lex Dei vel affectu solo flagitia perpetrari asserit. Itaque errarunt Antiquit. Iud lib. 12. cap. 13. Iosephus & In Psa. 66. 18. Dauid Kimhi, post Mat. 5. 20. Scribas & Pharisaeos, qui malos animi motus & cogitationes peccata non putarunt, nisi in opus exeant: quod de legibus hominum, non Dei, si dixissent, nequaquam lapsi essent. Ac ipse verisimiliter tantùm, non

certò eundem legis Dei atque aliarum sensum esse ais. Quamobrem adhuc salva est assertio mea, consultius te facturum fuisse, si modestius, de re quam opinaris, non scis, pronuntiasses. At altero argumento iugulasti hominem. Nam quae in histrionia (inquis) vitari peccata negotio nullo saepe solent, & possunt semper: ea nihil contra histrioniam faciunt. Sed peccatum illud, si quod est, promiscui vestimentorum usus, vitari saepe solet, & semper potest. Ergo. Quid Ergo? Cur reliquum non attexis, Ergo nihil facit lex illa Dei adversus histrioniam? Hoc enim erat concludendum. Ac utinam, quod assumis vetari saepe solere promiscuum usum vestium, eius rei testis fuisset nostra scena: viamque meliorē, qua vitari semper possit, ostēdisses quàm mimas & scenicas inter histriones introducendo: quod dedecus foeminei pudoris ac verecūdiaepeius esset paenè remediū ipso malo. Sed cuiusmodi syllogismo causam tuā fulcias, agnosce ex consimili, ad aliam Dei legem, Deut. 12. 3

                nequis liberos suos idôlis sacrificet. Quae in idololatria vitari peccata negotio nullo saepe solent, & possunt semper: ea nihil faciunt contra idololatriam. Sed peccatum illud comburendorum filiorum & filiarum, vitari saepèsolet, & semper potest. Ergo ninil facit lex illa Dei adversus idololatriam. Propositiogermana est & gemina tuae: non lac similius lacti. Assumptio, luce clarior è varia Papistarum idololatria. Conclusio tamen falsa videtur omnibus theologis: quorum hac in causa, ad primam legis tabulam spectante, autoritas, per 2. Re. 23. 10 Psal. 106. 39 Ier. 19. 5. Prophetas saltem, assensum tuum impetrabit. Quapropter, cùm ex veris nil nisi verum consequatur, restat falsam esse propositionē: & posse peccatum in idololatriam hanc aut illam cadere, quod in omne tamen idololatriae genus non cadat. Ego quidem certè hoc iudicio fui, quum ob latriam imaginibus Christi & crucis delatam, Papistas arguerē idololatriae. Nam ipsi saepe solent idololatriam committere, & semper possunt, absque imaginum cultu. Et tu, qui histriones mimas habere & scenicas scripsisti, videris aliquatenus idem sensisse. Cur enim non aequè putemus histrioniam, etsi non omnem histrioniam, perstrictam à De spect. cap. 17. Tertulliano mimas notante: ac tu asseruisti histriones mimas habere & scenicas, etsi non omnes histriones habeant? Sed quia iam hoc

tibi discrimen ita displicet, ut me confidentissimè reprehendere, quae non capio, proptereà affirmes: docebis nos fortasse, exemplum 2.

Perinde quasi dixisses nullam labem contrahi ab Pro. 23. 30. immorantibus apud vinum, nec iis Ioel. 1. 5. ebrietatem meritò exprobrari; quoniam esse potest Esai. 28. 7. & 29. 9. ebrietas sine vino. Atque hoc modo rationem illam, quam Tertullianus obtrudere videtur pro potentissima, nihili esse demonstrasti.
            Porrò, minus nihilo esse quicquid aliud adversus histrioniā afferunt theologi, quod mihi minus item modestè visus es asserere, tu contrà rursum asseris: & demonstras etiam, opinor; sed quemadmodum? Pudet me, inquis, earum rationū quas Tertullianus affert adversus cothurnos tragicos & fictas scenicorum personas. Age.
            Sint De spect. cap. 23. eius rationes leves contra histrionicum istum ornatum: rem adeò putidā & insulsam, ut nullas rationes ad eam explodendam desiderarint nostri, sed sua sponte rejecerint. Etenim cothurnis (cuiusmodicunque demum id genus fuit calceorū) efferebātur tragoedi quo altiores apparerent; & fictis ad eorum, quos agebant, speciem personis tegebātur: ut Horat. satyr. lib. 1. sat. 5. Sarmenti scurrae jocus in Messium docet; quem immani corporis proceritate,

& foeda cicatrice in facie deformem, rogabat Sarmentus ut Polyphemum ageret; Nil illi larya aut tragicis opus esse cothurnis. E nostris autem nemo in scenam cothurnatus & larvatus prodit. Quid igitur? An quia te pudet rationem quas Tertullianus affert adversus ineptias histrionicas, quarum tragoedos & scenicos nostros pudet: idcirco minus nihilo est quicquid aliud adversus histrioniam Tertullianus affert? Ac, ut Tertullianus, unus è multis, hallucinatus sit: idcirco minus nihilo est quicquid aliud adversus histrioniam afferunt theologi? Quanto te magis pudêre debuit conviciorum, quae in me effundis; quia, ut modestiam in pronuntiando maiorem adhiberes, praesertim quum de rebus religionis agis, amicè te admonui? Sed praeclarè Livi. lib. 34. Cato: Nae simul pudere, quod nō oportet, caeperit; quod oportet, non pudebit.. Me namque ex Papistico spiritu à librorum sacrorum tractatione te arcere ais: & haec cis annos istos septuaginta, quod Erastus ait similibus mei, tentare: & imperiosè cum eo sic agere, qui Papae imperium contempsit, & exulare patria potuit, & universo regno Papali: atque adeò, etiamsi in his à te vincar, obiurgare tamen te pro pietate: denique argumentis uti eiusmodi, quibus illudere pueris possim, vobis non possim. Bene factum, quod te ipsum longè à Papismo abesse profiteris. Nam ego multo minus te arceo à sacrorum librorum tractatione, quàm tu jurisconsultum, cui De jur. inter. dialog. 1. praecipis, ut nihil nisi ex Theologi praescripto enuntiet de re Theologica; & solis prudentiae civilis libris vacet, reliquis omnibus valedicat.

            Postremò, quia L. 1. D. de his qui not. infam. verba edicti Praetoris, sic à te exposita, ac si unius tantùm rei, nempe artis ludicrae, non duarum, id est artis ludicrae, pronuntiándiue, disjuncte, mentionem facerent, nimis sicco pede te dixi transiisse: quaeris, an ego in sicco sim, qui hoc dixerim. In sicco sanè adhuc: & aqua tibi haeret, qua, ne in sicco essem, conatus es me inundare. Nam ad testimonium Alciati, à te citatum, artem non facere eum qui semel, iterum, quid artis facit; respondi, ut concedatur hoc quod illi tribuis, pronuntiandi tamen causa in scenam prodire qui prodit semel tantùm: ac proptereà Macrob. Saturn. l. 2. c. 7 Laberium, quo primùm die prodiit inustam sibi notam infamiae censuisse; & probrosum visum Romanis (apud Annal. li. 14 Tacitum) vel orationes, vel carmina ita recitare, licet id gratis facerent. Cuius responsionis ut partes, tuo more, quascunque potes carpas, negas te tribuere illud Alciato: haberi enim apud Ad c. 207. D. de verbo. sign. eum, quamvis in Ad. c. 66. subnotato capite sit erratum. Ergone tribuere duntaxat ii dicendi sunt qui falsò tribuunt: non item qui verè? Profectò tu non L. 10. D. de instit. & jur. tribuis suum cuique, qui tribuendi verbo significationem istam solam tribuis. Ego verò, quia capite à te subnotato illud non reperi, & posse tamen alibi extare cogitavi: verbo tribuendi de industria usus sum, ut vacarem culpa, seu verè citasses, seu falsò. Quanquam iam ex tui errati correctione falsò citatum esse deprehendo: teque interpolasse locum Alciati inserta voce, Iterum; cùm ille tantùm dixerit,

               Qui semel emit pannos ut venderet, mercator non est: quia in eo deficit exercitium. Qui semel quid artis facit. Et quorsum (narra mihi) adjecisti hoc, Iterum? An quia te videbas non satis probaturum nullam à ludionibus nostris labem contrahi, si eos tantummodò artis faciendae nota liberares, qui semel quid artis facerent? Quin igitur Alciatum scripsisti affirmare, artem non facere eum qui semel, iterum, tertiò, quid artis facit? Nam potuisti eodem iure: & hoc, ad assequendum quod volebas, parum est. At eos saltem qui semel prodeunt, non amplius, immunes esse notae, docuisse te ais ex Alciato, sic argumentando: Ars notata est edicto; Sed una proditio non est ars; Ergo una proditio non est notata. At haec argumentatio vide ne similiter statuminetur, ac si quis ita disputaret: Faemina continetur appellatione hominis; Sed masculus non est foemina; Ergo masculus non continetur appellatione hominis. Nam, ut L. 152. D. de verb sign. foemina quidem appellatione hominis continetur, sed non tantùm foemina: ita ars notata est edicto Praetoris, sed non tantùm ars. Quod anim advertendum tibi proposui, quàm planissimè potui in tanta brevitate, ex Praetoris verbis, pronuntiándive causa, cum eo comparatis quod è Tacito citâras, de orationibus carminibusque in scena recitatis. Et, quoniam non distinguit Tacitus mercenarios recitatores à gratuitis, proptereà probrosum Romae visum dixi tametsi gratis recitarent: ut tu, qui Praetorem nullos vis notasse nisi quaestuarios, iudicum Romanorum hac 2 bloquentiae primas nemo tulit: sed victorem esse Caesarē pronuntiatum. Tacit. annal. lib. 14. in parte etiam à tua commentatione dissidere attenderes. Tu contrà affirmas persuasum esse tibi incubuisse illos, de quibus Tacitus loquitur, recitationibus, pretii aut praemii spe atque fiducia: itaque falsum me colligere, qui notatos dicam tametsi gratis recitarent. Noe tu non sine causa syllogismalem (quam De jur. inter. dialog. 4. appellas) altercationem à iurisprudentia tua reiecisti, si ea ratione hoc potes lucrifacere ut talla enthymemata, Persuasum est mihi te colligere falsum, Itaque falsum colligis, vim idonearum probationum habeant.

                hoc narrat, Xiphi. epit. Dio. Quid, quod ipse addis visum etiam crimen maiestatis laesae, secundum antiquos Romanorum mores, si magistratus pro concione legisset vel codices (ni malè méministi) eorum quae ad magistratus spectabant tamen. Dissimile hoc quidem: & memoriae tuae lapsui fortassis ex parte tribuendum. Nec enim maiestatis laesae accusatus est C. Cornelius. Cic. orat. pro Vatin. Asco. Pedia. in Cice. orat. pro corn. Ant. August. de legib. cap. 12 & lege Corn. majest. tribunus plebis, quòd pro cōcione codicem legisset; tanquā hoc perinde turpe, immò turpius multo, habitum esset, quàm orationes aut carmina in scena recitare: sed quòd, adversus intercessionem sui collegae, codicem, quem scriba legere prohibitus est, legisset ipse, itaque violasset legem Corneliam maiestatis. Caeterum, si antiquis Romanorum moribus tanti criminis reum fuisse magistratum, qui vel codices rerum, ad magistratus spectantium pro concione legisset, persuasum habes: fierine potest ut persuasum habeas non iisdem moribus probrosam Romae visam vel gratuitam carminum orationúmve in scena recitationem? Nisi fortè dices te existimare magistratus eos tantum modò maiestatis crimen admisisse, qui mercedis gratia codicem legerent pro concione Quod. mihi persuaderi prorsus non potest persuasum tibi esse.
            Ita postulanti tibi ut eorum, quae inficiaris, quaedam, si possem, docerem & ostenderem; non in illis solùm, sed etiam in caeteris hoc gratificari studui, ut potui. Maturius id facturus, nisi tu, omissa librorum & capitum, in quibus Augustini & aliorum quos citas verba scripta sint, indicatione, coëgisses me tempus terere perlegendis nonnullis libris integris, quo loca, quibus certò innixus videreris, exploratè cognita compertaque haberem. Auxit meam huius officii praestandi cupiditatem & desiderium tua sententia, sententiam non dissimilem Hieronymi, epi. 61. epi. 1. advers. err. Io. Ieros. gravioris autoris in memoriam revocans, ad tanta crimina patientem esse non oportere. Quare, quod mihi obiicis concludens, te à me tractari pessimè immeritò, hominem mei studiosissimum, crimen gravissimum omnium, si verum, non modò in amore non respondere, sed etiam malefactis benevolētiam rependere: id immeritò mihi à te obiectum esse, tua ipsius voce convinco, & concludo. Nam, quum per epistolam olim me moneres eorum quae putabas perperam asserta in meis praelectionibus ad

primum Maccabaeorum, his verbis usus es: Aequi bonique haec consules? Certè ea ipsa sunt, quae ego in donis amicorum pretiosissima ducerem; & utinam mihi aliquis contigisset aliquando, qui in meis scriptis praestare tantum voluisset. Vides ne ut ipse te à me non pessimè, sed optimè tractatum; neque iniuriis affectum, sed donis; & iis non vulgaribus, sed longè pretiosissimis, carissimis, optatissimis, esse fatearis? Quod si plus aloës quam mellis medicamentis meis admiscui, vel cum acrimonia potius maiore tanquam ad secandum & urendum accessi: tamen hoc quoque à Cic. de off. lib. 1. prudente morum magistro scis probari, quum nulla reperitur alia medicina. Ac ego, medicinam aliam saepiuscule in te expertus frustra, hanc unam fuperesse salutarem duxi; alioqui desperandum. Praesertim cùm rursus in pristinum de mendacio malè officioso morbum recidisses: idque ita graviter & periculosè, ut novo typis excuso opere defenderes, quod in vetere (liberámne amici vocem feres?) pessimè affirmâras. Quantum mutatus ab illo, qui mihi esse videbare, quum in epistola quadam hac de re scripta concluderes hoc modo: In controversia hac sustinere, quantum ad theologos pertinet, deinceps assensionem, in animo est. tibi scilicet, ut debeo, plurimum tribuo, qui me in contrariam vocas sententiam: & cum Tertulliano tandem malim sapere in Scripturis sanctis minus, quàm contra.] Atque in alia, ad meam precationem, Qui Petrum erexit ut agnosceret peccatum quum mendacio officioso negasset se novisse Christum, te, ut ipsum rectè fecisse sentias, excitet, neque tibi verbis defendendum putes quod piis factis improbaris; respondisti his verbis: Ecce, in fine versor tuarum literarum, nec tuam admonitionem, nec precationem tuam (mihi crede) sine ingenti affectu animi lego; dixerim nec sine lacrymis, certè cordis: Deus me dirigat in viam suam, & ab omni errore sartū tectum
