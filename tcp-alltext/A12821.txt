            AT LONDON Printed by Humfrey Lownes, 1611.
            
         
         
            
            
               TO THE RIGHT Honourable, Robert Earle of Salisbury, Knight of the moſt honourable Order of the Garter, Vicount Cranborne, Lord Cecil of Eſſindon, Lord high Threaſurer of England, Chancelour of the Vniuerſitie of Cambridge, and one of his Maieſties moſt Ho
               nourable priuie Councel, A. S. wiſheth the pleaſures of the Kingdome of Heauen, for his paines taken in this Kingdome of the Earth.
            
               IT may ſeem ſtrange vnto you (truely honourable Lorde) that a ſtranger ſhould dedicate a Booke vnto you: but, wonder not. For, though I

be not knowen to your Honour, yet your Honor is wel knowen vnto me: and (indeed) to whom not? I haue no ſmall time (be it ſpoken without blaſphemie) euen worſhipt your Worth; and therefore now offer vp vnto it, all the reuenewes of my reuerence. I was the rather induced to dedicate it to your Honour, by reaſon that my father was a neighbour to your Father, being much obliged vnto him; and my whole Family vnto your ſelfe. And next of all, to giue you thankes in the behalfe of all Gentrie; which is daylie bettered by your

Lordſhips directions, and furtherances in all honeſt courſes. Deſert was fled into the Deſert, before your Lordſhip called her home from exile, & clad hir weather-beaten limmes. And (which draweth neere vnto a miracle) your Lordſhip doth not imitate the greateſt part of the hodiernall Nobilitie, Qui beneficia in calendario ſeribunt. But whether goe I? knowing that your monoſyllables, as alſo ſhort ſpeeches, are pleaſing to GOD ſometimes, and to Great-men at all times. Accept then this Leafe rather then Booke, together

with my vowed and owed ſeruice: which though I offer ſerò, tamen ſeriò, my euer honoured Lord.
            
               Your Lordſhips moſt humble ſeruant: to be commanded, ANTHONIE STAFFORD.
            
            
            
         
         
            
            TO THE Reader.
            
               Different, or indifferent READER, Health to thy Soule and Bodie. Knoweing vertue to bee of the nature of the Sun, that is, ſhe ſhines as well vpon the bad, as vpon the good; I thought the badde would claime intereſt in her, as

well as the good. To preuent which, I wrote this treatiſe: in which I haue layed my ſelfe open to the world; to the intent, that I may attract the loue of the vertuous, and the hate of all thoſe who continue vitious: for, I hold him to be no honeſt man, that is beloued of all men. For, in that, he ſheweth that he can apply himſelfe to the time, be it neuer ſo vitious, to the place be it neuer ſo infamous, to the perſon, be it neuer ſo odious. Wherfore I giue all men to vnderſtand, that I am a ſervant to Vertue: which I

proclaime to the world, by this booke, my Heraulde; and giue defiance to her foes and mine. And howſoeuer I ſeeme, now and then, to lend an eare to lewdneſſe; it is not that I take pleaſure in it, but becauſe I am loth to dipleaſe the harbourers and diu
                  •
               lgers of it. What ſoeuer the world thinkes of me, or thinketh me to be: yet this I am. For, being throughly acquainted with myſelfe, I doe not aske another man what I am. I proteſt it againe and againe, that I depend on Vertue. And, if I wax poore in her

ſeruice, I ſhall account my ſelfe richer, then all this wicked worlds wealth can make me: and, if I growe rich without her, I ſhall eſteeme my ſelf poorer then pouerty her ſelfe can make me. I ſpeake not this, like a Politiciā, to purchaſe my ſelfe a greater fame then mine owne worth; No, no▪ We doe not diſſemble in thoſe things, in which he firſt deceiues himſelfe, that would others. Wherefore he is iniurious to me, who wicked in himſelfe frameth a minde to me out of his owne. If my inward man excuſe me, what care

I, who accuſe me? yet doe I not deſpiſe an honeſt report; but, onely warne you this, that it is not in my power to tye looſe tongues. And therefore Fame is to be reckoned amongſt theſe externall accidents; as of no moment to the accompliſhment of a quiet and a bleſſed life. What to be, conſiſteth on my part; what I am ſaid to be, on the vaine vulgars. Fame and Conſcience are of two differing properties: the one blazeth a mans deſerts; yet makes him neuer the better: the other, the better; yet neuer the more

renowned. I knowe, that my beliefe in God, and not the worlds beliefe of me, ſhall ſaue me: yet (by the way) would I not haue any man thinke, that I write this by conſtraint; that is, to cleare my ſelfe of any imputed Crime: for, I write it not to diſpoſſeſſe, but to poſſeſſe the world of a good opinion of me. I verily thinke, that I haue layed my ſelfe too open, & dealt too plainely in ſome things contained in this inſuing treatiſe: but, I paſſe not much. For, as my birth ſtyled me a gentleman; ſo I would haue my death

ſtile me generous. Prying Policy telleth me, that it is farre 
                  〈◊〉
                to knowe what a man ſpeaks, then to ſpeak what he knowes: but my harmeleſſe heart dictates to my pen, not what the world would, but what it ſhould heare of. My ſoule is an Antipode, & treads oppoſite to the preſent world. My intent, in writing this book, is twofolde: firſt, to purchaſe to my ſelfe, not ſo much the title of a learned, as of an honeſt man; and ſecondly (becauſe I knowe not whether my vnfortunate fortunes, and vnſtaied youth

may leade me) that the world may be acquainted with the ſecrets of my ſoule, and may receiue from me a teſtimonie of my liuely faith; that ſo it may iudge the more charitably of mee being dead. Thus much for my ſelfe. Now, gentle or vngentle Reader; concerning thee, I diuide thee into Learned, and Vnlearned: and the Learned I ſubdiuide into Iudicial, and Not-indiciall. Seneca ſaith, that Summū bonum in iudicio eſt, that mans chief felicity is in iudgement: and Sealiger calleth it Animamſapientiae,
               
               the ſoule of wiſedome. And therefore he that hath this Wiſedomes ſoule to be the Centre of his ſoule, I doe not ſo much feare, as reuerence his cenſure. But hee that hath read neuer ſo much, and in his diſcourſe will ſhoote whole Volleis of Volumes at a man, and yet wanteth iudgemente, my Booke turnes his poſteriours to him, and bids him ſhoote there, as a marke too faire for his carping mouth, to aime at. The Vnlearned I rediuide into Prudent, and Impudent. The Prudent will not let his cenſure

flie aboue his knowledge; but, what he vnderſtands not, he will with modeſtie either paſſe it ouer, or with diſcretion enquire after it, of ſome better-knowing ſpirits. As for impudent aſſes, who will reprehende vvhat their ſhallowe vvits can neither apprehende, nor comprehende, and ſo turne deſpaire into iudgement, I hold them fitter to read bills, and ballads, then my Booke. And withall I muſt needes adde this, that I neither feare a Stage, nor the cenſure of a Woman. And againſt the Learned,

and Vnlearned, Iudiciall and Not-iudiciall, Prudent and Impudent, Women, and the worlds wide Theater, I bandy that of Iob,Iob. 31. 35. 
               Behold my ſigne, that the Almightie will witneſs for mee; although mine Adnerſarie write a booke againſt mee.

               STAFFORDS NIOBE, OR His age of teares.
            
               SAd to the very Soule, bearing in my minde a diſcōtent, that I could bee no more diſcontented; in a worde, wearie of my ſelfe, I on a time walked forth, hoping by ſome diuine meditation to abandon, and expell this helliſh diſpoſition.

And being com to the place ordained by my ſelfe to this ſolemne exerciſe, I firſt lifted vp mine eies to heauen, to ſee what heauen would haue done vpon earth: and then again I caſt them down vpon earth, to ſee what earth hadde done againſt heauen. But loe, in the entrance 
                  〈◊〉
                to this my ſanctified contemplation, my olde agonie came vpon me; I meane, a conflict betwixt mine vnequall, diſagreeing pasſions: which forced mee to call backe the better of my thoughts, to driue back the worſe. But, finding no way, whereby I might appeaſe

theſe implacable furies of my minde, leauing my meditation, I thus ſpake vnto my ſoule. Soule, ſaide I, how chaunceth it, that nothing can content thee ſo much as diſcontent? Is not this rotten body, this all corruption, this worſt of earth, a ſufficient priſon vnto thee, but that thou thy ſelfe muſt become a priſon to thy ſelfe? To theſe my demaunds ſhee thus makes anſwer; that the diuell, as ſhee thinkes, hath committed inceſt with his daughter, World, who is now deliuered of an Age, frō the which the ſooner it ſhould pleaſe

God to deliuer her, the better. Then ſoule, ſaid I, take thy flight, & with the ſharp pearcing eyes of contemplation pry into the corners of the Vniverſe; and ſee if within this ſpacious Round thou canſt finde out ſome place, where thou maieſt inioy a pure conuerſation till the houre com wherin thou ſhalt leaue this thine impure manſion. Shee obeyed, and after long, & teadious ſearch, ſhee returned like Noahs turtle, and told mee that ſuch a deluge of ſinne had ouerſpread the face of the earthe, that there was no place free where vertue

might treade in ſa
                  •
               etie. If earth then, ſaid I, affoorde thee no comfort, lett thy conuerſation be in heauen, laugh at the idle pleaſures of theſe daies, and let not thine vnlimited appetite ſo much couet as contemne them; following that rule, of Seneca, Contemnere omnia aliquis poteſt; omnia habere nemo
               Sen Epiſt. 62. 
               poteſt. Some one man, ſaith hee▪ 
               may contemne all things; but no man 
                     〈◊〉
                   haue all things. And indeed what is there in this world, on the which Enuy may not iuſtlie ſpend all her gall? For whoſoeuer ſhal with an inten

look into this worſt of ages, ſhall finde, that the laſciuious heathen Poets were but as wicked prophets of the wickednes to come in theſe accurſed times; wee hauing turned their lewde inuentions into more lewd actions. So that it ſeemes wee haue anatomized vice, and laied thoſe parts of her to the open viewe, which they in modeſty let lie vndiſcouered. From the higheſt to the loweſt, from the youngeſt to the oldeſt, from the Eagle to the Wren, all haue corrupted their waies, and are becom degenerate from the purity of their anceſtours.

Vice hath ſupplanted vertue: and he now a-dayes is helde the moſt abſolute man, who is the moſt diſſolute liuer. As now and then the humours of the whole bodie fall downe into the legges, and there make an iſſue: So hath the corruption of times paſt ſlidde down into the preſent, to the annoiance, and choaking of all that is good. This is the time foretolde by Seneca,Sen. de benef. lib. 1. cap. 10

               much wine ſhall bee helde a vertue. Pride, luxury, and ribauldry haue now their reigne, and his happineſſe is greateſt who followeth them the ſooneſt. As for pride, ſhe hath ſo many feathers added to her wings, that ſhee couereth all the earth with her ſhadowe. Our men are growen ſo effeminate, and our women ſo man-like▪ that (if it might bee) I thinke they woulde exchange genders. What modeſt eye can with patience beholde the immodeſt geſtures▪ and attires of our women? No ſooner with them is inſancie put off, but

impudency is put on: they haue turned nature into art; ſo that a man can hardlie diſcerne a woman from her image. Their bodies they pinch in, as if they were angrie with nature for caſting them in ſo groſs a mould: but as for their looſer parts, them they let looſe to preie vpon whatſoeuer their luſtdarting eyes ſhalſeize-vpon. Their breſts they laye to the open viewe, like two faire apples: of which who
                  •
               oeuer taſteth, ſhall be ſure of the knowledge of euill; of good I dare not warrant him. As for our men, they equall, if not ſurpaſſe this female frailtie,

the qualities of their mindes being as light as the ſubſtance of their bodies is heauie. Light clothes, and a light behauior is now your onely weare, and hee your greateſt gallant who canne whiffe off his gallon. O, that iniquitie were here limited! but alas, it is not. For mens tongues are now beecome trumpets or rather ſtrumpets to their mindes: ſo that what ſoeuer they conceiue, they not onely tell othersAmbroſ. de poenit. lib. 1. cap. 34. of it, but alſo intice them to doe it. Luſt, ſaith Ambroſe, is feade with banquets, nouriſhed with delights, kindled with wine, enflamed
               
               with drunkenneſſe; but ſtreight addeth, peiora tamen his ſunt fomenta verborum, quae vino quodam Sodomitanae vit is mentē inebriant. But worſe then all theſe, ſaith hee, is that impurity of ſpeach, which makes drunk the minde with the ſweet tasting wine of the Sodomiticall vine. Sodome, thy ſinnes were fewe in reſpect of ours, and our iuſt men fewe in reſpect of thine. Thou peraduenture hadſt three, or foure: but happy is that citty with vs that can yeelde one; yet wee raile at thee, and ſeeke to be oppoſite to thee in al things:

euill, is yet a greater: but to write euill, is in it ſelfe both matchleſſe, and nameleſſe; no word being fit to expreſs ſo vnfit a worke. O that ſo foule a matter ſhould be left to poſteritie in ſo faire characters! or that a man ſhould with his owne hand write a confesſion, to condemne his own heart! What ſhould I ſay, or rather what ſhould I not ſaie in ſo hopeleſſe, ſo hapleſſe a caſe? onelie this then I will ſaie, that for ſhame men ſhould haue ſom feeling, ſome remorſe in eterniſing their owne ſhame, as alſo conſider that their bodies, nay the faire frame

of this ſpacious Rounde, ſhall be ſubiect to ruine: onlie the ſoule, and her actions are eternall. For, the ſoule being eternall, the actions proceeding from her, participate of the ſame eternity. The bodie, being ſpotted, is quickly mundified: but the ſoule, once branded with infamy, euer keeps her mark, and neuer becommeth immaculate. O dangerous age! thou ſeduceſt many to errour; but reduceſt none to truth: thou cauſeſt manie to fall; but raiſeſt vp none. And indeede, how ſhould they ſtand firme, when their footting is ſo ſlipperie? How

ſhould they reſolue, when euerie thing giues them occaſion of doubt? What ſhal a man decree to bee truth, when hee ſhall ſee Pontius Pilate waſhing his handes, but not his heart? Caiphas, pretending blaſphemie, to rent his garments? the new Scribes and Phariſies cryingMat. 27 24 out to Ieſus, maſter thou art good, though they thinke him to bee moſt had? Simon Iudas ſelling, Simon Magus buying GOD for money? holding a trinitie of benefices in vnitie of perſon: and theſe three are, for the moſt part, foure. Thoſe who ſhould tell Iſraell of her ſins,

and Iuda of her tranſgreſsions, doe now ſooth her vp in her iniquitie; nay, flatter the dead to pleaſe the liuing: in ſo much that Durus de Paſcalo makes it one of his precepts, that the courtier ought to giue credit neither to funerall ſermons, nor to Gallobelgicus, or other ſuch idle fablers. I muſt confeſſe that the worde lye is vndecent, to giue to a miniſter; but verie aptly applyed to Gallobelgicus, who lyeth of ſet purpoſe, and telleth truth at aduenture. Sure I am, he hath not learned, or (if learned) not practiſed that firſt, and chiefeſt lawe of a lawefull

hiſtorian, which is, Vt ne quid falſi audeat, nequid veri dicere non audeat. But to my purpoſe, it were to be wiſhed, that this abuſe of preaching might bee reformed; that ſo the laudable vſe of it, might bee with the more applauſe, and profit continued. Mercy ſhould be in the Preachers mouth, not flatterie: he ſhould pronounce pardon to others (not craue it from others) and pronounce (nay, denounce) vengeance againſt thoſe who renounce the ordained meanes of their ſaluation. Flattery, thou baſe, creeping ſinne, thou ſeducer

Turkes, this vice is ſo odious, that they reward it in whomeſoeuer they finde it with 8o. ſtripes, making it the moſt deteſtable ſinne of all, next to adultery; to which, they a lot a hundred ſtripes. If heathen people do this (whom errour leades hood-winked in ignorance, or rather ignorance in errour) what ſhould a Chriſtian doe? why ſhould not hee

leade a good, and ſober life, whoſe name is written in the booke of life? But (alas!) for want of conſideration this is not looked into. Vpon this vice depend three other (as vgly ſeruants vpon a deformed maſter) to wit, Quarelling, Whooring, and Swearing. The firſt of which hath more by tongue, then ſworde, purchaſed to it ſelfe the name of valour; which indeeds is no neerer to valour, then phrenſie to wiſedome. True valour biddeth a man fight pro patria, et patre patriae; this baſtarde courage incites a man to fight cum fratre, cum patre: the

former perſwadeth a man to be carefull not onelie that he take no iniury, but (euen religious) that he doe none; the latter ſaith, that hee is worthy of iniury, that offers none. The one ſaith, Fight being prouoked; the other ſayes, Prouoke to fight.

for reputation. What blemiſh is it to my reputation to denye that in ſobrietie, which I affirmed in drunkennes? that is, to recall that as a man, which I ſpake as a beaſt? Yet theſe roaring gentlemen, whatſoeuer they ſpeake, be it neuer ſo bad, will make it good. Surelie, I am of opiniō, that the word duel, is deriued from the French word dueil, by reaſon that it makes ſo manie parents mourne for the vntimely death of their children, and one friend lament the deceaſe of another. But by the way, I will giue this caution, that no man

miſconſtrue mee, and thinke that I perſwade men to cowardiſe: for, I am ſo farre from that, that I thinke a cowarde to be the baſeſt ofA Coward who? all creatures: & A Coward I call him, who ſlauiſhlie feareth any thing but God. For, if my Prince allow me combate, vpon diſhonourable imputation of treaſon, and I be drawen into the lifts with a chaine of foul, diſgracefull words linked together, which will ſo ſticke to my Familie, & Race, that no time can raze them out; the iniurie here becommeth more then priuate, (wherof only, I take it, Chriſt ſpeaks,

Wherefore I could not, without much applauſe, reade that Motto in the Scottiſh armes; In defence.

                  s anhelet, this is far from valour: for, valour is an enemie to no vertue; this

to euery vertue, and a friend to all vice. Neither can I be indueed otherwiſe to belieue, but that there are many gentlemen, whoſe modeſt, ingenuous faces are free from ſcouls, and furrowes of wrath; in whoſe hearts, notwithſtanding, maieſtical magnanimitie ſitteth richlier clad, then in thoſe of your roaring, angry boyes of London; and peraduenture would giue them iuſt cauſe both to roare, and houl too. The ſecond daughter to drunkennes is whooring, the deflourer of many a virgin, and defiler of many a wife; a ſinne which moſt

men are addicted to by nature, and feweſt freed from by grace. For though God hath ſeparated the male frō the female, and diſioyned them; yet, I know not how, they will ſtill deſire a coniunction. The Cedars of Libanus haue fallen this way: the Patriarehs, Prophets, Fathers, and our forefathers haue here gone aſtray. Many a Saint hath fallen at the feet of theſe ſaints, and hath adored their adorned beautie. Yet, for men to proſtrate their bodies to euerie dung-hill, and ſinke into euerie ſink-hole, was neuer ſo common, as in

theſe later licentious times; wherein money can buy affection, Beautie offering her ſelfe to hire. But, to keepe yout ſeruant brisk, and ſpruſe, that the towne maie take notice of him, for a neate, compleate gentleman; and to feede vpon the anſwerable report the world giues of him; tuſh, this is no ſinne. No no: it is no offence at all to allow him ſo much for euerie courſe; ſo cauſing him to ſpend fleſh for ſiluer, till he become ſo lank, and leane, that his legs are ſcarce able to ſupport their late portly young maſter; going ſtill, as if hee were ſitting

(occaſioned through the imbecillitie of his hammeſtrings) and ſo dry, that a marrow-bone-man, if hee ſhould boile his bones, could ſcarce get out two droppes of moiſture: his eyes ſo hollow, that they runne backe to ſalute his memory, leaſt ſhe ſhould forget them▪ and his cheekes, dentingin, as if he were ſtill ſucking at a bottle. And now my braue ſlaue beeing a neighbour to death, beginneth to find, that all this while he hath miſtaken, and worſhipped a falſe deity, for a true: and that therefore (though ceaſing, through weaknes,

to burne here in luſt) hee ſhal euer burne in neuer conſuming fire. Where is his miſtreſſe now? whoſe praiſes ſhould bee written with pennes of Angels wings; whoſe drinke ſhould bee Nectar, and Ambroſia. Hee now muſt leaue her behinde him, common to men, that ſhall one day bee common to diuels. It breedeth aſtoniſhment in mee to heare a man ſtile a woman, Diuine creature of a heauenlie feature, goddeſs of my thoughts, natures vtter moſt indeuour, &c. whoſe body he knoweth to bee compos'd of putrefaction, and ſhall one day

come to that degree of rottennels, that (as ſhe now, in the noſtri's of God) it ſhall ſtink in the noſtrils both of men, and beaſtes. Reaſon and Religion teach a man (as her remembrancer) thus to court his Miſtreſs: Faire Queene of dust and durt, will it pleaſe your eueryhower-decaying maieſtie, after ſome fewe yeares, or moneths, or daies, to haue th

               ruby lippes be kiſſed by her mouldy mouth; whē your pure red, and white, ſhall be turned into poore browne, and blacke; and that face which hath driuen ſo many into conſumptions, ſhall it ſelfe bee conſumed to nothing. Yet, for all this, our young gentlemen will not forbeare their amorous profane louediſcourſes; but yeelde as much honour to women, as to their Maker. Theſe men are rightly taxed by a late writer, where he ſaith, Quorum ſermonis venus ipſa Venus. Reaſon, thou bright ſtar which directeſt the wiſe man to the god of wiſedom,

thou eye of the ſoule, why doſt thou ſuppreſs thy clearſhining beames, and leaueſt the ſoule of man in darknes. Wert thou truelie miſtreſs of the minde, thou wouldeſt neuer ſuffer a commandreſſe of elaie and clods, to ſubdue and conquer it. For, take this for an infallible poſition, that Sinne neuer enters the will of man, till defect his reaſon. Mens liues, together with the ſtates of their ſoules, now-adaies, depend vpon the voice of a woman: and they are more penitent for one duty omitted towards her, then for a thouſand offences committed againſt

God. For the one they craue mercie: for the other they care not, but mock at iuſtice. Mors, et vita, ſaith Salomon, in manibus linguae: death, and life, ſaith he, are in the hands of the tongue. Surely, ſaye theſe doating doltes, Salomon in this place m

But, if the woman be culpable in this behalfe, it is ſo much the more intollerable, by how much (of the

twaine) ſhee ſhould bee the more ſhamefaſte. She ought euer to prize a baſhful countenaunce, before a paynted one that cannot bluſh: and ſhould be ſo farre from proffering theſe vnſeemely loue-trickes; as rather, at the leaſt lewde looke, or touch, to preſent the beholders eyes, with modeſties red badge, in waie of miſlike.

which the Lord ſaith in the third of Eſay: Becauſe the daughters of Sion are hautie, and walk with ſtretched-out necks, and with wandering eyes, walking, and minſing as they goe, and make a tink
                  
                     •
                  ing with their feete; therefore ſhall the heads of the daughters of Sion be balde, and the Lord ſhall diſcouer their ſecret parts. In that day ſhall the Lord take-away the ornament of the ſlippers, and the calls, and the round tiers, the ſweete balls, and the bracelets, and the bonets, the tires of the head, and the ſlops, the headbands and the tablets, the eare-rings, the
               
               rings, and the mufflers, the coſtly apparel, and the veiles, and the wimples, and the criſping pinnes, and the glaſſes, and the fine linnen, and the hoodes, and the lawnes; and in ſtead of ſweet ſauour, there ſhall be ſtink; & in ſtead of a girdle, a rent, and in ſtead of dresſing of the haire, baldeneſſe: and in ſtead of a ſtomacher, a girdle of ſackecloth; and burning, in ſtead of beauty. Then ſhall her gates mourne, & lament; and ſhe being deſolate ſhall ſitte vppon the ground. Amongſt theſe menaces of GOD, ſome haue already lighted vpon our women,

as baldeneſſe, and burning; many of our men gaining burning in ſtead of beautie: and the reſtare as yet to fall; whoſe weight will bee ſo heauie, as that it will cruſh theſe tender offenders. O! I could laſh pride, and bee bitter towards theſe ſweets, but that I knowe my words would goe into winde, and be rather ſcoffed at, then regarded. I could tell them of ſetting borrowed teeth into their pale, bloudleſs gums; how they ouerlaie yellowe with white, in ſo much that in an howres ſpace they will make a man belieue that the yellowe Iaundies is turned

into the greene ſickeneſſe; how they turne their blacke bloud 
                  •
                into faire crimſon, and ſet that Baude, Art, to bedaube Nature. I could tel them alſo of their prodigalitie in apparell, but that it concerneth not all in generall, but onely ſome in particular. Honour, as of her ſelfe ſhee is bright, and glorious; ſo wee allow her like raiment correſpondent to her ſplendour, to the end that ſhee may be diſcerned from the baſe vulgar. But that euerye blurt (who is only a gentlewoman of two moneths ſtanding) ſhould be clad like a Queene; this

(I thinke) is more then any wiſe man will yeeld to. Another kinde of baſe pride hath poſſeſſed our womē, ſo that they think a man poor in ſpirit, that is not rich in cloathing. Bring me a gentleman of a great, far-famed family, whoſe mightie anceſtours haue ſpent their bloud to crowne their bloud with vertues diademe, and left behinde them triumphant trophees of their vncontrouled greatnes: and, to aſſociate this Pirocles, bring mee a Dametas, who hath of late extracted gentility out of dung; if this foiſt be more fine then the former,

his entertainement ſhal bee rich, and ſumptuous, the others poore and beggerly. But this is not onelie a fault in this frailer ſexe, but alſo in men of eminency; who though they ſhould be the eyes of our Iland, yet their ſight is dimmed with this foggy miſt. If one man excell another as farre in height of knowledge, as heauen earth in diſtance; yet hee that is the beſt able in purſe ſhall be iudged worthieſt of preferment, and imployment. Seneca had lied in his throate if he had ſaide in our time, Nemo ſapientiam paupertate damnauit: for, as

Wherefore I cannot but meruaile at the ſottiſhneſſe of the Papiſts, who teach men to vow pouertie: which in it ſelfe is euill, as Beckermane a late dutch writer very wittilie proueth againſt the Stoickes; where he ſaith, that a free prae

are to be choſen, and (on the contrary) diſeaſes, pouertie, griefe to bee auoided; they yeeld perforce, theſe to bee bad, thoſe to be good. For my part, would riches come for the vowing, it ſhould be the firſt vow I would make, and bleſs God for them as blesſings beſtow'd vpon the bleſſed; the want of them being as a puniſhment laied vppon man to bring him vnto God, and to the knowledge of himſelfe: which if a man do attain-to in proſperitie, what needeth humiliation? O penury! through thy perſwaſions, kings think Cottages Kingdomes, and

ſubiect themſelues to their owne ſubiects. Thou monſter, thou cunning Artiſt, thou transformer of men (that of a gentleman, canſt make a ſcullian, of a prince a peſant) craule along with plebeians; but mount not the backe of vnſaddled honour, nor goe about to iade the generous: for, if thou doeſt hee will fling thee, though himſelfe lye by it. Thus haue I aſſaied to ſwim againſt the current of ſwift, vnſtaied humors: and if my labour may amend others, it ſhall ſufficientlie commende itſelfe. Yet, whether it do, or doe not, I muſt and will

A loſſe, ſaid I? a loſſe to her that loſeth it, and a loſſe to him that gaines it. For, when a man hath with much loſſe of time, expenſe of mony, neglect of friends, chaſed this tame game, and made a preye of it; then, I ſaie, ſatietie of one makes him loue varietie of all, and he thinkes her eaſie to be loſt who is no harder to bee wonne. O what ſeas of vnequall paſſions keepe their

dailie ebbe, and flow in him? To-day hee coueteth what to-morrow he loatheth: his minde is with a little thing erected, with a leſs deiected: hee purſueth that with a great deſire, which once obtained hee abandons with a greater: one and the ſame thing in one, and the ſelfe ſame houre bringeth him content, and diſcontent: he laughs, he weeps, hee pines, hee repines, not knowing (himſelfe) why. At laſt, he learneth, that praiſe is the Pandar to luſt; and therefore with mellifluous ſpeeches charmes her liſtning eares: and the fortreſſe of her

eares being wonne, the bulwarke of her heart is conquered. And now he hath her, hee cannot keepe her long, hee muſt haue ſharers; for, her eares are open to flattery: and who knowes not, that complement is a ſure friend to copulation? His onelie courſe therefore would be, to change his miſtreſſe into a maſter, who is

a long ſute before they can obtaine. It is not onely fleſh will make one of theſe haukes ſtoope to the lure; but ſhe muſt haue ſiluer too: which, my young practician not being acquainted with, maketh his requeſt in vaine. When hee ſpeakes of loue, ſhe lookes ſo ſtrangely as if ſhee heard a miracle, ſwearing ſhee neuer as yet ſawe any man who could gaine the leaſt corner of her heart. He belieues all; and (like a kinde natured man) preſents her with rich gifts, deſiring no gift from her but her ſelfe: which ſhe (with a pittifull looke) condeſcends

to, exclaiming againſt Fortune for ſubduing her to man; when God he knowes ſhee hath beene as common as a Retraict. And now my plaine, downe-right ſquire (who neuer before was further then his fathers windemill) in taking is taken himſelfe with a hooke that will not eaſily let him goe; and many a land-knaue, and ſeagull ſhall feede vpon the reuenewes of his purſe, and he ſhall be called patron till all his patrimonie bee ſpent.

ſpurre a queſtion, and aske whether a whoore hiring, or hired, is the more deteſtable in the ſight of God?Deut. 23. 18. The ſcripture determines, and iudgeth, that a woman, taking money for proſtituting her body to men, is infamous;Ezech. 16. 33. but ſhe that giueth money to enioye her louer, is moſt infamous of all others. All are abhominable before the Lord: and therefore Salomon in his Prouerbes ſaith, that the mouth of a ſtrange woman, or an harlot, is as a deepe pit: hee
               Prou. 22. 14. 
               that is a deteſtation to the Lord ſhall fall therein. And in another place, hee ſaith;

               A whoore is as a deepe
               Prou. 23. 17. 
               ditch, and a narrowe pit. Noting thereby, that if a man be once in with an harlot, hee ſhall as hardly get out againe, as a man that is plunged into a very deepe, and narrowe pit, where he can hardlie ſtirre himſelfe. The ſame Salomon, in the booke of Eccleſiaſtes, yeeldeth vs the reaſon heereof; namely, becauſe ſhee is as nets, ſnares, & bands; where if a man be once in, he is faſt enough for getting out. I finde, ſaith he, more bitter then death, the woman, whoſe heart is as nets, and ſnares, and her hands as bands: hee
               
               that is good before God, ſhall be deliuered from her; but the ſinner ſhall be taken by her. O that fleſh, and bloud would liſten to the aduiſe of the ſpirite, and follow the counſell of the wiſe man!Prou. 26. 5

                  riſh woman a man is brought to a morſell of bread: and the adultreſſe hanteth for life which is pretious. Again he ſaith; Albeit the lippes of an harlot droppe as an hony combe, and the roofe of her mouth be ſofter then oyle; yet her latter end is bitter as wormewood, and
               
               as ſharpe as a two-edged ſword. Chaſtitie, art thou fledde from Chriſtians to Pagans? Virginity (thou, in whom Antiquity did glorie) canſt thou finde no moderne perſon worthy thy preſence?

                   virtute: that as Vertue is vnſpotted; ſo Virginitie ſhould bee vncorrupted. They all concurred in applauſe of this eſtate: but they differed in degrees of praiſe; ſome of them thinking virgo to bee deriued

                  ; becauſe they hauing

paſſed their tender yeeres, deſire the ſocietie of man. Others thought virgo to be ſo nominated a vigore, becauſe they flouriſh moſt in thoſe yeeres. Others deduced virgo à virga: not becauſe they are ſcourges to men; but they called them ſo ab atate viridiori: becauſe that as greenneſſe is a token of the ſpring; ſo thoſe green, tender yeeres are markes of virginity. Some compared a virgin to a Lilly: the ſimilitude was this; they thought the ſix leaues of the Lillie did repreſent the heart and the fiue ſenſes in a virgin, which (like the former ſix)

ſhould be kept freſh, hauing no ſauour of euill: and that as thoſe leaues are ſpread abroade; ſo maiden-actions ſhould be open: not cloſe, nor ſecret; but ſecure, as able to indure the moſt ſearching eye. How manie plantes, riuers, ſprings, temples, cities did they conſecrate to the name Virgine, and gaue them that name! They thought the ſame difference to bee between matrimonie, and virginity, that is betwixt to ſin, and not to ſinne, good, and better. And therefore Hierome in his expoſition of the Pſal.

The Hebricians confound faireneſſe with goodneſſe,

in calling that faire which is good, that good which is faire. And therefore when it is ſaid, that Sara ſeemed very good in the eies of the Aegyptians, the meaning of the text is that ſhee ſeemed very faire. Neither did the Graecians ſeparate this beautifull yoke, but ioy▪

Although I thinke obſtinacie her ſelfe will confeſſe, that that of virgill is moſt true, Gratior eſt pulchro veniens è corpore virtus: Yet, as true it is, that virtus et forma rarò cōueniunt: vertue, & beauty ſeldom ſhake hands.

Thou ſterne-fronted, hard-hearted man, thou terrour of the poore, thou that ſuffereſt the image of God to decay when one penny of thine may repaire it, thou that letteſt one of thoſe little ones ſterue for a morſell ofMat. 18. 10. bread; thou little thinkeſt that their Angels behold the face of their heauenly Father, and pleade for iuſtice againſt thee vniuſt. The voice of the beggar beggeth for reuenge againſt thee: Which God will heare, and pay thee with Sulphur, whē
               
that bodie of thine ſhall render-vp it ſelfe to neuer-conſuming flames; & thy mercileſſe ſoule (which being voide of pittie, did depriue the needie of comfort) ſhall be depriued of the preſence of him, whoſe abſence poſſeſſeth the ſoule with more horrour, then the fier can the bodye with torment. Who ſhall receiue then the Intereſt of thy money? theſe that laugh at thee, for keeping thy coyne that they might inioie it? It is better beſtowed vpon them, then vpon thee: for, they reioice in it; thou hadſt not it, but it had thee. Vſurie, thou

bane to manie a diſtreſſed gentleman, thou deuourer of the oppreſſed, thou nipper of mirth, thou vnpleaſant toyle, thy ſinne is ſo weightie, that it makes paſſage for it ſelfe, through earth into hell. Yet knowe I their common caution, with which they vſe to cloake theſe their intolerable wrongs; to weet, that a man may let out money to vſe, ſo he giue it not in morſum; when Ile be ſworne they giue it in dorſum, and laye on ſuch loade that they breake the backes of manie decayed men. Sure, it was auarice which firſt made

theft ſo capitall a crime; it hauing in this our Land a greater puniſhment allotted to it then adultery, and many more enormous, hainous crimes. I knowe no reaſon why adulterie ſhould not be rewarded with death, as well as theft, but onelie this; that whereas man accounts of his wife, but onely as fleſh of his fleſh, and bone of his bone, he eſteems of his coyne, as ſoule of his ſoule. It is Auarice, that makes greedie fathers force their children to ſeeme to like what indeed they loath, and to take vnto them one for better for worſe, then

whome (indeede) they can like nothing worſe. From hence it comes to paſſe, that age is matched with youth, fairenes with foulnes, beautie with deformitie; which doubtleſſe is farre from the firſt inſtitution; for, In the
               Mat. 19▪ 8 
               beginning (as Chriſt replyed, concerning wiues, to the Scribes, and Phariſies) it was not ſo. GOD at firſt created man, and woman, in their full vigour, that they might be full of loue one to the other. What an vnſeemlie ſight is it, to ſee an olde grandſire as froſtie in fleſh as haire (whoſe eyes are readie to ſet in his head, and

whoſe rotten lungs ſcarce afford him breath) march to the Church with his young ſpouſe, whoſe eyes roule in her head, whoſe marrow burnes in her bones, whoſe heate ſcornes colde, and in whoſe heart diſdaine of age dooeth breede deſire of youth!
            According to GODs ordinance, Youth ſhould honour, and reuerence Age: but wee no where reade, that Youth ſhould ſolace it ſelfe in Age, or affect it. Thoſe women, that thus marry, in my iudgement differ little or nothing from common ones: for, both

ſel their affection. What wil you giue me? ſaies one: what will you giue me? ſayes the other.
            Hauing now traced Vice by her footing as farre 
                  •
               s hell, we will there leaue her, to accompanie her blacke, ſinnefull ſire. And now let vs ſuppoſe man to be without all notorious actuall tranſgresſions, onely conſidering him in his originall corruption: and wee ſhall finde that for all he is thus eaſed, hee is yet miſerable euough; and that for one comfort, he hath millions of croſſes. Hearken to Salomon. I my ſelfe, ſaith he, am
               Wiſ. 7
               
               alſo mortall, and a man like all other, and am come of him that was firſt made of the earth. And in my mothers wombe was I faſhioned to be fleſh in tenne moneths: I was brought together into bloud, of the ſeede of man, and with the pleaſure that commeth with ſleepe. And when I was borne, I receiued the common ayre, and fell vpon the earth, which is of like nature, crying and weeping at the firſt as all other doe. I was nouriſhed in ſwadling clothes, & with cares: for there is no King that had any other beginning of birth. All men, then, haue one entrance into
               
               life & a like going out. Thus farre Salomon. It were too tedious a thing here to vnfolde the myſtery of mans conception, which in Philoſophy is no leſſe pleaſing, then ſtrange, and wonderfull. The firſt gift man receiues from Nature after his conception, is feeling; the next is moouing: and after he hath receiued the vttermoſt of his perfect, imperfect forme, ſhee giues him birth. He is no ſooner borne, but his reaſonableſoule (as di uining his troubles to com) makes him bawl and crie: and, hauing nothing but humour wherewith to vent his

pasſion, he ſheddeth teares. Well, as comming from a woman, he is referred to the care of a woman; who ſpends all her time (yet all little enough) to dreſſe him, to ſtill him, to watch him, and to wipe awaie the excrements of this excrement. The firſt word hee ſpeakes bewraies vanitie: and as ſoone as his legs are able to vnderprop the burthen of his body, he goes to vanitie. He waxeth Idolatrous, and beholdes a baby made of clouts, a woodden puppie, or a paper birde, with an eye of worſhip & adoration. He liued in his mothers wombe

like a plant, came out from thence like a beaſt, and ſo ſtill remaines, till inſtitution faſhion his Intellect, and make it capable of reaſon. Hauing now left to crie of himſelfe, he is ſent to ſchool; where he is forced to continue, and exerciſe this weeping trade: and there hee ſpendes the third part of his life, in teares, ſighes, and ſobs. Being thus bound in obedience, and ſeruitude, he deſires to ſhake off captiuity, and will bee no more commanded, but obeyed. Hauing rule ouer others, hee cannot gouerne himſelfe; but purſues whatſoeuer paſſion,

and humour, lead him to. Ifhe haue plenty, hee is riotous, luxurious, prodigall, not accounting of the accounts hee ſhall one daie giue for it. If hee liue in ſcarcitie, he accuſeth his parents, curſeth the houre of his birth, and longeth for his buriall; and as (in his owne opinion) he came into the worlde, before his time; ſo hee ſeeketh by all meanes to goe out before his time appointed. But, this by the waie is certaine, that aboundance choaketh more with riot then want killeth with deſpaire. Man receiues more detriment

from this middle age, then either from his precedent, or ſubſequent. In this age he is vnruly, head-ſtrong, violent; neither will hee hearken to information, the begetter of reformation. And therefore the ages of man may aptly be compared to the ſea: his youth may bee likened to the weatherſhore, ſtormy: his olde age, to the lee ſhore, calme: and his middle age, to the middeſt of the Ocean; where rough, vnmeaſured, Skymounting billowes carrie this light balanced Barke, now hither, now thither; and now and then driue her

into helles harbour (from whence ſometimes the treader of waters, the commander of windes, the drier-vp of cloudes, prouidences great pilot, bringeth her back into heauēs happy hauen. For, now being come to liue of himſelfe, hee cannot tell how to diſpoſe of himſelfe, nor where to ſpend the remnant of his dayes. If in the Court, he ſees that he muſt crouch, bow, diſſemble, put on a ſmooth front to his enemies, and euen lick the feete of the great. His generous minde telleth him, that a gentleman (who is therefore called ſo, becauſe

hee ſhould not degenerate from his own nature) ſhould not fawne, nor bend his knee when his heart riſes; but (as Seneca ſaith) induere animi ſui val
                     •
                  um. Hee apprehends what baſeneſſe it is, to put on a doggiſh propertie; and (as the ſame SenecaSen. de beat. vita▪ cap. vlt. ſaith) in conſummationem dignitat is per mille indignitates erepere; that is, to creepe vp to honour, through a thouſand diſhonours. Hee perceiues, a courtier muſt pocket vppe many a great wrong, to come to greatneſs; and ſerue all men, that hee maie commaund all men. Fame whiſpers in his eare,

that the Court is a Baude that will doe nothing without money, a mint of faſhions, an exchange of complements, a ſhame to ſhamefaſtneſſe, and a Scene of all obſcene actions. And now he thinkes that Machiauell was vnfortunat, only in this that he divulged his villanie to the world: for, in this place more is acted then euer hee inuented. Hee was for the Theorick; theſe men for the Practique. Experience telleth him, that the time is long that hangs vpon deſert; and the rewarde like to a womans fauour; then fartheſt off, when it is moſt

expected. Theſe poore deluded men, make me call to minde an olde Chriſtmas gambole, contriued with a thredde, which being faſtned to ſome beame hath at the nether end of it a ſticke, at the one ende of which is tied a candle, and at the other ende an apple; ſo that when a man comes to bite at the apple, the candle burnes his noſe. The application is as eaſie as the trick common; we hauing before our eyes dailie examples of men diſcarded for their ſeruice done. After his ſoule hath ruminated theſe inconueniences, he manifeſtly ſees

that the Court is not a place ſuting with his diſpoſition. Well, the Court being diſpleaſing, he goeth into the countrey; where he diſcouers Solitude (Melancholies mute mother) ſitting in a forſaken weede, ſtroking her child Abſence on the head. Being here, he feeles this dumbe, ſilent life, to be a ſtill kinde of death vnto him. Hee is heere in the world, as if he were out of the world: hee liues more like a beaſt then a man; pampring his body: but his nobler part (for which only he breathes) is barred from the mindes nurſe, Conuerſation;

and from the knowledge of ſtrange euents, the confirmers and conformers of the minde. He learneth here, to preferre corporall exerciſe, before the ſoules recreation. The Papiſts are forced to goe to Church, and to receiue the Sacrament once in a yeere, or elſe to vndergoe the penaltie; vvhen theſe voluptuous countrey-proteſtants neuer frequent the Church or receiue the Sacrament once in their life time. O that anie reaſonable ſoule ſhould valewe the pleaſures of the body, aboue thoſe of the minde! betweene which

there is as much inequalitie, as is betweene the ſubſtances they iſſue from. Theſe pleaſing motions of the ſoule, proceede from the Intellect: thoſe brutiſh ones of the bodie, haue their birth from Senſe, by which they are nouriſhed. The former of vvhich, are by ſo much more noble then the latter, by how much the quicke, ſwift Intellect bettereth, & ſurpaſſeth the ſlowe, and dull Senſe.
            A touch, or a taſte with the body is but momentary, and abideth not a whit: but with the ſoule the relliſh of the thing receiued remaineth

for euer. The beaſts thē
               ſelues haue ſenſe: nay they haue appearing (though not apparent) vertues; but none of them euer yet mounted one degree of Contemplations riſing ſcale: by which the wiſe man with an aſpiring zeale, aſcendes the throne of God; and ſeeing moſt things there inſcrutable, in humilitie deſcendes again vpon his foote-ſtoole. O! but Gentry now degenerates: Nobility is now come to bee nuda relatio, a meere, bare relation, and nothing elſe. How manie Players haue I ſeene vpon a ſtage, fit indeede to be Noblemen?

how many that bee Noblemen, fit only to repreſent them? Why? this can Fortune doe; who makes ſome companions of her Chariot, who for deſert ſhould be lackies to her Ladiſhip. Let me want pittie, if I diſſolue not into pittie, when I ſee ſuch poore ſtuffe, vnder rich ſtuffe; that is, a bodie richly cladde, whoſe minde is capable of nothing but a hunting match, a racket-court, or a cock-pit, or at the moſt the ſtory of Suſanna in an alehouſe. Riſe, Sidney, riſe: thou Englands eternall honour, reuiue, and leade the reuolting ſpirits of

thy countrey-men, againſt the ſoules baſeſt foe, Ignorance. But what talke I of thee? heauen hath not left earth thy equall: neither do I thinke that ab orbe condito, ſince Nature firſt was, any man hath beene, in whome Genus and Genius met ſo right. Thou Atlas to all vertues, thou Hercules to the Muſes, thou Patron to the poor, thou deſerueſt a Quire of ancient Bardi to ſing thy praiſes; who, with their muſickes melody, might expreſſe thy ſoules harmonie. Were the tranſmigration of ſoules certaine (which opinion as Caeſar ſaith, the ancient

Brittiſh Druidae imbraced) I would thy ſoule had flitted into my body, or would thou wert aliue again that we might leade an indididuall life together. Thou waſt not more admired at home, then famous abroade; thy pen, and ſworde being the Heraldes of thy Heroicke deedes. A worthy witneſſe of thy worth, was Lipſius; when in amazement he cried out, Nihil tibi deeſt, quod aut naturae, aut Fortunae adeſt: nothing, ſaith he, to thee is abſent, that either to Nature, or Fortune is preſent. And in another place he addeth, O tu Britanniae
               
               tuae clarum ſidus, cui certatim lucem affundunt Virtus, Muſa, Gratia, Fortuna: O, ſaith he, thou bright ſtar of thy Brittany, whoſe light is fedde by Vertue, the Muſes, Fortune, and all graces. The verſes which are extant in S. Pauls Quire at London, made in a gratefull memory of this king of knights, ſufficiently declare his deſerts: which verſes, valour, and honour command me heere to inſert.
            
               England, Netherland, the heauens, and the Arts,

Of the Noble Sydney: for, who will ſuppoſe
               That a ſmall heap of ſtones can Sydney incloſe?
               England hath his body; for, ſhe it fedde:
               Netherlande, his bloud, in her defenſe ſhed.
               The Heauens haue his ſoule: the Arts haue his fame:
               All ſouldiers the griefe: the World, his good name.
            
            Lord, I haue ſinned againſt thee, and heauen, and I am not worthy to be called thy childe: yet lett thy mercy obtaine this Boone for me, from thee; that when it ſhall pleaſe thee that my name

bee no more, it may ende in ſuch a man, as was that Sidus Sydneyorum. What grace is it to me, when men report that a graſier of the ſame name (the very ſound of whom leaues ruſt behind it in Fames trumpet) ſcraped vp together thouſands a yeere? whoſe greaſy dignity in ſome two generations wii be Fly-blowne. And therefore I doe not enuie, but emulate, the happineſſe of the late Ioſephus Scaliger: who being deſcended from Princes, and hauing all his race in his reines, fledde the ſocietie of wanton women; fearing leaſt he ſhould beget

one, who might one day deſtroy his family, and take from the luſtre of it: and ſo he himſelfe, like a Semi-god, gaue a Period to his Parentage. O! if a man had all his linage in his loines, it were braue ſmothering it there, rather then hereafter to let any crooked branch deform the beauty of the whole ſtocke; or any diſorderlie perſon either in 
                  〈◊〉
                or death to purchaſe infamy to his whole family. Yet doe not I cleerely ſee, how a man by neuer ſo hainous a fact cantaint his whole bloud, or kindred; ſince it is euident to all men of vnderſtanding

that alia eſt cognatio culpae, alia ſanguinis: neither could Eſau any way diſparage Iacob. But it is not a thing any way ſtrange, if the yong gentlemen of this kingdom leaue diſhonor in their houſes, ſince their maintenance is too little to maintaine any honeſt courſe. You ſhall ſee an elder brother ſtalke before his traine, like Pharaoh before his hoſt; and his younger brother (of the ſame bloud, and of a greater ſpirit) come ſneaking after him, as if hee were the baſeſt of his brothers retinue. What minde can frame it ſelfe to ſuch meanes? what

will not a daring ſpirit vndertake, rather then bee a bondſlaue to his owne brother? Non ſeruiam, ſaid that Laconian lad; et praecipitem

becauſe the doctrine is not ſafe, and ſound. No, no: that ſoule which leaues her tabernacle without a licence from her Emperour, merits condemnation. As a man who eſcapeth out of priſon, doth not thereby cleer himſelfe of his fault done, but augmenteth his puniſhmēt: euen ſo that ſoule, which ſtealeth out of her fleſhy Iaile without a cōmand frō that ſupreame magiſtrate, in flying temporall miſerie falleth into eternall anguiſh, and layeth her ſelfe open to all that ſeueritie can inflict.

Hauing a little wandered, let vs now at laſt take a view of man in his laſt, & oldeſtage. As he brought diſeaſes with him from his laſt mother: ſo he muſt carry them with him to his firſt mother, the earth. Now commeth the Phyſician with his miſh, maſh, an hundred

Simples in one Compound, and powreth it into this leaking veſſell. If hee recouer, he ſtandeth bound to his Doctour, for his life; and acknowledgeth him, next vnder God, his preſeruer. Good Ieſus! that a man ſhould bee obliged to him for breathing, who deteines the breath in bondage, and prolongeth the houre of the ſoules releaſement. Seneca ſaith, that there are ſome men, who though they ſaue another mans life, yet they doe not any way engage him whome they ſaue: amongſt which hee placeth Phyſicians, and maketh

               Sen. lib. 4. de ben. cap. 13. this his reaſon; Quia ad alienum commodum, pro ſuo veniunt; becauſe they ſeeke another mans profit, for their owne. Moreouer, an olde man groweth a young childe againe; his limbs faile him; and all the faculties of his body fade. Nay, which is worſe, his diuine part beginneth to nodde, and is depriued of that ſubtility which runneth through all things, in, and aboue nature; that is, conceiueth all that is not inconceiueable. And therefore Seneca thought, that it was lawfull for an aged man of an imperfect minde to kill

himſelfe. Non relinquam
               Sen. Epiſt. 58. 
               ſenectutem, ſi me totum mihi reſeruabit: totum autem ab illa parte meliore. At ſi coeperit concutere mentem, ſi partes eius conuellere, ſi mihi non vitam reliquerit, ſed animam; proſiliam ex aedificio p

But if age diſtract my minde, and deface her faireſt parts, if it leaue me a ſoule, and (as I may ſo ſaie) no life to ſolace that ſoule: I will then leape out of this ruined, and lothſome

lodging. But this is more acutely handled in Stobaeus; where Muſonius, or ſome other ſaith in this manner;Serm. 1. 
               Sicut è domo exigi videmur cum locator penſione non acceptâ fores reuellit, tegulas aufert, puteum obſtruit: it

As, ſaith he, an angry vnpayed Land-lord ſeemeth to enforce his Tenants departure, when hee taketh away the doores of the houſe, vntileth the whole building, ſtoppeth
               
               vp the Well, and barreth him from all neceſſaries: euenſo I ſeeme to bee driuen out of this body, when Nature, who lent me eyes, eares, hands, feete, taketh awaie the vertue and vſe of them, ſo that I canne neither ſee, heare, handle, nor goe. I will not therefore abide any longer; but will goe away, as from a banquet, being no way ſicke, and diſeaſed. Beſides this feebleneſſe of body and minde, there is another inconuenience incident to old age: to weet, that it maketh a man leſſe pleaſing, not ſociable; but ſo peeuiſh, curſt, and crabbed, as that mildeneſſe

it ſelfe cannot keepe him company. His very children are wearie of him, and wiſh him a portion in heauen, that ſo they maie haue their portions on earth into their owne hands. Yet he endureth all this patientlie, till at laſt his profeſſed foe, Death, aſſaulteth him: to whom (after he hath in vaine ſtriued to maintaine life againſt death) hee yeeldeth vp himſelfe. Thus wee ſee the whole droues of calamities, which man meets with in this his earthlie pilgrimage: in which hee prooues by experience, that nothing is more true then

that Italian Prouerbe,
            
               Questo mondo è fatto a ſcale,
               Chi le ſcende, et chi le ſale.
               This ſame world is made with ſteppes:
               One falls downe, one vp leapes.
            
            Who would think, that miſery wanted ſo much as an inch of her height? Nay, who would imagine, that this brittle, earthen veſſell could ſtand ſo many knockes, and not be broken? yes, yes▪ there is yet an addition

to extreamity, & a plague is yet left behinde, which all the former cannot counteruaile. Religion, Religion, thou ſower of diſſenſion, and reaper of hatred, thou ſetteſt ſoule againſt ſoule, and bodie againſt bodie. Man, who by thee doth excell beaſtes in knowledge, by thee alſo doth ſurpaſſe them in enuie. Chriſt is diuided from Chriſt: that is, Chriſtianitie is parted into ſectes▪ But, this is not contrarie to Chriſts fore-warning. Think
               Mat. 10 34 & 35 
               not, ſaith he, that I am come to ſend peace into the earth, but the ſword. For, I am come to ſet a man at variance
               
               against his father, and the daughter againſt her mother in law &c. If Chriſt would haue deſcended into particulars, he would haue mentioned alſo the ſetting of ſubiects againſt their Princes; then which, nothing is more common with the Romiſh Religion. This made Parſons, that falſe fugitiue, that Romiſh runnagate, raile againſt his royall Queene, and Miſtreſſe. A faire equalitie: the baſeſt man on earth to write againſt a GOD, on earth; Gods curſed, againſt Gods anointed. That tongue (I dare pronounce it boldly)

ſhall burne in neuer quenching fire, that defames his Princes name. This detracting Traitour, with his fellowes, would haue all vertues in that, which in it ſelfeDe Benif. lib. 4. cap. 26. & 27. is nothing but ſinne. Omnia vitia ſunt in omnibus, ſaith Seneca: yet thoſe prying malitious men would haue omnes virtutes in ſingulis. Detractions eyes reflect ſtill vpon her ſelfe: and ſhee regardeth euer what is to bee approoued in her ſelfe, and reprooued in others: whereas indeede ſhe ſhould runne this race cleane backwarde, and haue an eye to thoſe vertues which lie hid and ſuppreſſed

in others, and to thoſe vices which are moſt eminent in her ſelfe. Theſe reproachefull Reprobates ſhould winke at the ſmall faults in great perſons, and beare away that ſentence of Auſtine: Non ſtatim malum, quod minus bonum, together with that other ſaying of a late Writer; Genus humanū diuinum facimus, ſi vitijs carens. If our Elizabeth ſhould haue vttered thoſe blaſphemies, which ſome of their Popiſh Princes haue belched forth, they would haue thought, that the earth could not ſtand with her vpon it.

No, no: our peereleſſe Princeſſe had nothing ſo horrid to lie vpon her conſcience. Elizabeth, thou glorie of thy ſexe, thou mirrour of Maieſtie and modeſtie, thou reſemblance of that ſacred Elizabeth, look down throughLuk. 1. thoſe thy Cryſtal ſpectacles, vpō thy meaneſt of ſubiects, who in defence of thine honor wold oppoſe himſelf againſtal mortality, & expoſe his life to death for thee.

The Queene of the South came to ſee Salomon: had Salomon liued in thy time, or thou in his, hee would himſelfe haue come to viſit the Queene of the North; and being the wiſeſt of men, would haue wondered to finde ſo much wiſedome in Woman. Bleſſed Virgine, thou reſteſt from thy labours, and we labour for thy reſt, & with ceaſſeleſs paine ſtriue to attaine to that

endleſſe pleaſure which now thou enioyeſt. Thou abideſt now farre enough out of the reach of contumelious tongues, and art ſecure from all, that pale enuie, or meager malice can charge thee with. There is no greater ſigne that thou waſt vertuous, then that thou art maligned of all who are vitious. For, as a great bodie is not without a like ſhadow: no more is any eminent vertue without imminent detraction. Mee thinkes, that Calumny ſhould ende with the carkaſſe of her ſubiect, and not haunt the graue till the laſt bone be conſumed.

Which to effect, Solō made a law, that no man ſhould ſpeake ill of the dead: and his reaſon was, for feare of immortall enemies. But they will not ſticke to write againſt the dead, who are not affraid to write againſt the liuing. The ſame forenamed perfidious Parſons, hath, with little reuerence, written a booke againſt his liuing King. O, for ſome coniuring lawes, to lay theſe rouing, rauing tongues! Is it not a madde world thinke you, when euery braine-ſick, giddie-headed, pamphleting companiō ſhal preſume to vpbraide & beard mighty

Monarchs? Wherefore hot ſpirited Luther (though otherwiſe a ſtout ſouldier in Chriſts Church militant) is not to bee excuſed for his vnreuerent ſpeeches of Henrie the eight of England. The mildeſt tearmes hee vſeth, are, Momus, mimus, and ſtultus: nay, at the length, his preſumption ſwelleth ſo big, that he changeth the name Henry into Pharaoh, and calles all his Courtiers, Iannes and Iambres. Vnlimited Luther, thou verities chiefe champion, I am altogether as vnable to cenſure thee, as to equall thee: yet my neuer dying zeale to

                  •
                forceth mee to tell thee, that theſe thy miſſe-beſeeming words did not proceede from diuine inſpiration, but from humane pasſion. This is a thing rare with Luther, and vnexpected from him: but nothing is more vſuall with the defenders of the Papacie. They not onlie allow to reuile and mocke a a King, but alſo to murther him. Which damnable doctrine François de VeroneFranc. de ver. Con. par. 2. ca. 2 Conſtantine mainetaineth, when he ſaies: L'Action de Clement eſt loyſible, et le coup qu'il a donnè à Henrie 3. eſtoit du meſme endroict, que
               
               celuy de lulian l'apoſtat, c'eſt a dire du ciel. The Actiō, ſaies he, of Clement is lawful: & the blowe which he gaue to Henry the 3. was ſent from whence that of Iulian the Apoſtate; that is, frō heauen. Is there then no difference to be put betweene a perſecutour and a profeſſour of Chriſt? Of the former of which, it is ſaid, Iaculabatur ſanguinem in Galilaeum: of the latter it may beſaid, effuſit
               Socr. in vita Iul. 
               ſanguinem pro Galilaeo. The ſame Writer after he hath railed his fill at Henry the 4. in ſaying, that he was not l'oingt de Dieu, who was loing de Dieu, nor more

rightly king of France, then he who in the Goſpell is called Prince of this World; at laſt he burſteth out into theſe wordes, which point at murther, C'eſt vne choſe louable, de ſauuer tant de milliers d'hommes tant preſents, qu'auenir, de la damnation eternelle. It is, ſaith he, a thing praiſe worthy, to ſaue ſo many millions of men, as well preſent as to come, from eternall damnation. Hee ſaith alſo, that Gerard who killed the Prince of Orange did that act, Pour le bien de la vertu, for vertues good: and againe he ſaies, Gerard, le coeur luy eſtant arrachè, rendit ainſi ſon ame à Dieu:
               
               Gerard, ſaith he, his heart being torne frō out of his body, rēdred his ſoule vp vnto god. But, what will not this author vndertake? whoſe book is written in defence of Chaſtelet, who eſſayed to ſlaye the late murthered King of France. What odious enterpriſe will not a bad impudent ſpirite ſeeke to make good? I thinke, there would not bee wanting a ſeditious turbulent ſoule, to write againſt GOD, for his vniuſt throwing downe of Lucifer. Surely, ſome penne or other wil paint forth that accurſed Rauilliake for a Saint on earth, and of a monſter make a Martyr.

That rauenous Rauilliake glutted himſelfe with the bloud of that king, in whom were eminently contained all the vertues of all the French kinges ſince Pharamond. The minutes of that houre, the houre of that day, the day of that weeke, the weeke of that moneth, the moneth of that yeere, wherin that nothing-fearing Phaetō had his downfal, France ſhall euer holde both ominous and odious. Griefe gripes my heart when I think, that the Mars of men receiued his deaths blowe from a pen-maker, a Pedagogue. A late French Writer

hath compoſed a ſhort Treatiſe to prooue that the ſword is more proper to the French Nation, than to any other. Which though I deny; yet I would eaſily yeelde vnto him, that the ſworde was more proper to the late French king, then to any of his anceſtors, or to his liuing equalls. He was a king of the ſword, and of his word; whoſe word was his ſword, & whoſe ſword was his word: for, where his word could not warrant, his ſword bore ſway. Out of the aſhes of this Phoenix another bird is riſen; whoſe feathers, I feare me, will not

bee able to beare him the flight and pitch his Sire ſored. Well, France hath loſt her Soueraigne: & we were neere loſing ours. How often hath God pulled our King, out of Treaſon's murthering mouth, and out of the iawes of death? When that Powder-plot (a treaſon, at the which, Fiction her ſelfe ſtoode affrighted) was readie to lay holde on him, then God deliuered him. But I do not think, if Faux, or rather Fax, had giuen fire to the powder, that it could haue deuoured that ſacred aſſembly. What? he that deliuered the children

of Iſraell out of Egypt; hee that led them through the red ſea, without wetting of their feete; he that fed them without any ordinary bread for the ſpace of fortie yeares in the wilderneſſe; he that cauſed the Sunne to ſtand ſtill; hee that cauſed the Sun to goe backewardes at the prayers of king Hezechiah; he that raiſed the dead; hee that did ſo many wonders and miracles; could not hee alſo haue changed the propertie of Powder? No doubt, but hee could and would haue ſent the force of it down-wards, making a paſſage through the earths

hollow wombe into hell, & there haue blaſted the black Diuell with his vnhallowed Senate of Popes, the inuentours and fautours of this vnheard-of attempt. It can be none other but the diuel, that biddeth a traitour pick out GODS choſen to butcher. If the Diuell (vpon my ſoules altar I ſweare it) would take me vp to the pinacle, as hee did my heauenly Maiſter, and ſaie to me, all this will I giue thee to kill thy earthly Maiſter; had hee power to performe his promiſe, I would not doe it: but, rather then tentation ſhould win this fraile

fleſh to ſpill the numbred drops of that royall bloud, I would firſt let out all mine owne. Me thinks my Sauiour whiſpereth in mine eare, and telleth mee, that his bloud ſhall not cleanſe the polluted ſoule of that man, that dies with that bloudy thought. But the Ieſuites are the ring-leaders to this troop of king-ſlayers: which, whoſoeuer readeth their bookes ſhall ſoon perceiue. For mine owne part, I had with no ſmall paines gathered together their doctrines, concerning this point; meaning indeed to printit: but I was preuented

by Anticoton; who made a diſcouerie of the ſlaughtering ambuſh they lay for Princes. Which book is turned into Engliſh; the Tranſlatour being in nothing inferiour to the Authour. But, it is nothing ſtrange if theſe Ieſuites bee bloudy; ſeeing the firſt of their Order was a ſouldier. He was a Spaniard by birth (which makes them loue that ſoile ſo well) his name Ignatius, ſo called ab igne, as one that ſhould incenſe ſubiects againſt their Soueraignes, and ſet the whole world on fire with ſedition and diſſenſion. Incredible

things are reported of this man, by thoſe of his owne coat. Ribadeneira, who hath written his life, ſayes, that this Ignatius kneeling on a certaine daie before the Image of the ſpotleſſe Virgin Mary, there aroſe an earthquake. Surely, the earth trembled to feele the weight of ſuch a Monſter. One thing the Authour reports of this Ignatius; whereunto I giue credit, ſince his ſucceeders do the ſame: & this it is; Ignatius diſputauit cum Mauro de Maria Virgine: & cùm ex verbo Dei hominem refutare non potuit, pugione confodere voluit aduerſari

Ignatius, ſaith he, diſputed with a Moore concerning the Virgin Marie: but, when he ſaw, that hee could not refute him out of the word of God, he ſought with his poniard to conquer his aduerſarie. This holds not onelie with the women, but alſo with the men of this religion: for, what they cannot haue with diſputing, they take out in railing and fighting. The Authour yet goes farther, and ſaies, Inter h

What ſhould moue them to ſet a-broach their hogsheads, & make youth drunk with their new inuented liquor? Why breake they their ſleepes, to breake the bond of peace betweene the people and their Prince? Why do they all this? That their ſeruice may bee acceptable to the Pope their Maiſter; whom they exalt, aboucthrones and principalities,

And therefore Princes, learning that the Pope ſeeketh nothing elſe, but to make them his vaſſals, haue reiected his power and authoritie; as finding a great difference betweene his yoak, and that of Chriſt.

It cannot ſinke into my head, how ſuperſtition ſhould ſo bleare the eyes of ſo many learned men, ſo many yeeres together, as that they ſhould not ſpy out this vſurper, and ſeeke to depriue him of his ſtollen ſupremacie: But (alas!) in Rome now, new ſuperſtition ſupplies the place of ancient valour. Were Saint Paul in Rome to-day, he would vtter the ſame words in Campo Martio,

The Church of Rome is built vpon ſuperſtition; and maketh more of ceremonies, then of the ſubſtance of religion. Some of theſe ceremonies are ſo abſurd, as I think they onely ſtay the Iewes conuerſion. For, as Auerrhoes, in deriſiō of them, ſaid, Sit anima mea
               Auer. in 12. Metaphyſi. 
               cum Philoſophis, quia Chriſtiani adorant id quod edunt; Let my ſoule be with the Philoſophers, ſeeing the Chriſtians adore that which they eate: So maie

the lewes iuſtly ſay, Let our ſoules bee with the olde ceremonies, ſince the new ones are ſo fooliſh and ridiculous. Others againe of thoſe ceremonies are ſo impious, that it is a wonder that heauen doth not blaſt, or earth ſwallow-vppe the profane obſeruers of them. They picture GOD the father, like an olde decrepite man; and make him viſible to the eye of the bodie, whom the eye of the cleereſt minde cannot truely diſcerne. God made Man according to his owne image, one way: and Man, in waie of recompenſe, makes God

according to his image, another way. I am ſo great an enemy to ceremonies, as that I would onelie wiſh, to haue that one ceremonie at my buriall, which I had at my birth; I mean, ſwadling: and yet I am indifferent for that too.
            Tacitus ſaide, in hisTacit. Annal. lib. 14. time, that Chriſtianitie was Super ſtitio exitiabilis: had he liued in our time, he would haue added execrabilis. Oh that religion were once purged from the lees of the Romiſh grape! that ſo euery thir ſting ſoule might drinke out of the fountaine of the written Word. I would not be

ſo preſumptuous as to wiſhMa. 20. 22 to ſit either at the right, or at the left hand of my Redeemer: But, if I coulde obtaine my requeſt at the hands of God, I would onely deſire to ſee my natiue countrey voide of erronious doctrine, and flouriſh vnder a liuely, well grounded faith. Oh! but this vnion of religions is a harder thing to effect, then an vnion of kingdomes. For, in this buſineſſe of the ſoule euery priuate man is a Senatour, and paſſeth his iudgement: No man in this can bee compelled to tread in the kings high way; but hee will (if it

ſtand with his liking) haue a path-way of his owne. That man would merite eternitie, that could reconcile the long ſeuered Proteſtants & Papiſts. But it is a bootleſſe endeuour to eſſay it; ſince that of Cyprian is moſt true: Nulla ſocietas fidei et
               55. epiſto. 
               perfidiae poteſt eſſe. The learned, on both ſides, ſet the ignorant together by the eares; and-caſt in boanes, to make them ſnarle one at another: their long ſtudied diſtinctions, doe as much dull zeale, as they whet ſubtiltie. They teach the people to talke well, not to liue well; alluring them to delight

in controuerſies, the onelie Seminaries of Hereſies. They abuſe that knowledge and light, which they haue, infuſed into thē by the father of lights: and whereas they ſhould turn it into actions, they turne it into factions. Is it not glory enough to them, that their learning placeth them almoſt as farre aboue ordinarie men, as ordinarie men aboue beaſts; but that they muſt alſo clip truth, to enlarge their triumphes? They inueigh deadly one againſt another, as being at deadly enmity, and ſtriue to draw others to their parties; employing inuention,

onely to feede contention. Their reaſons would make a reaſonable man to laugh: and their Motiues would moue a man to be of no religion, and think Chriſtianity a meere deluſion. The Papiſt firmely affirmes that the Proteſtant is dāned; the proteſtant doubts of the ſaluation of the papiſt: yet in my weake opinion, it ſhould not bee ſo with the latter. For, though the papiſts iudge vncharitablie of vs; yet wee ſhould cenſure more fauourably of them. It is a dangerous doctrine, which the purer ſort of our diuines haue of late diuulged

to the world; to weet, that all theſe are blotted out of the book of life, that die abſolute papiſts. To this end ſaith an Eng. writer of the forementioned ſect; where is, ſaith he, Cyrus, Darius, Xerxes, Alexander, Caeſar, Pompey, Seipio and Haniball? Where are the Valiant Henries and Noble Edwards of England? The wormes eat them: and what is become of their ſoules, is moſt of all to be feared. See the indiſcretion of this man, in mingling Chriſtianitie and Paganiſme together. The Valiant Henries, and Noble Edwardes of England are with him in no better

taking, then Cyrus, Darius, &c. and hee maketh their caſe common. GOD ſend the poore idle man to come to the place, which the Valiant Henries, and the Noble Edwards of England inhabite. Hee and the reſt of his faction, need not as they doe, complaine of their pouertie; ſince their owne raſhneſſe procures it. Raſh in Hebrewe, ſignifieth Pauper in Latin, in Engliſh A poor man. For my part, I neuer knew a raſh man▪ that dyed rich. Their tongues are theirs: who ſhall controll them? Audacitie leads them: and out of an aſſumed

libertie, or an ill gouerned zeale, they ſpeake they care not what, without either feare or wit. Many things are ſpoken (GOD hee knowes) from the heart, which neuer came neere the head; and many things are thought to be vttered ex animo, which indeede iſſue ex animi morbo▪
                That moſt of our aunceſtours are damned, I dare not beleeue: but, I had rather determine of my ſucceſſours, who liuing in the later times are more ſubiect to ſinne, the reward of temporall and eternall death. Though our anceſtours were gally-ſlaues to the

pope, as being chained faſt to Ignorance; yet their Works leaue a ſufficient teſtimonie of their faith. Sunt, ſaith Cambden, vi

They had fidem formatam; we, fidem informem: they did more then they knew; we know more then wee doe. Their ignorance was the greateſt fault they had: which if it did

condemne them, woe be to little knowing, yet well meaning mindes. If Chriſt prayed for thoſe that crucified him, ſaying; Father forgiue them: they know not what they doe; will hee not pray for them alſo that praiſe, magnifie, and glorifie his euer-glorious name, yet in ſo doing, know not what they doe? Thoſe that teach them, ſhall anſwere for it; according to thoſe words of Chriſt: Whoſoeuer
               Mat. 5. 19 
               therefore ſhall breake one of theſe leaſt commandements, and teach men ſo, hee ſhall bee called the leaſt in the kingdome of heauen, &c.

where we ſee a puniſhment alloted to falſe teaching. Let vs defer then to cenſure, what ſhall become of them, till wee know what ſhall become of our ſelues; which is onelie knowen to GOD. If all the Diuines in the world auouch that Hell is my portion, if That Diuinity whiſper to me the contrarie, I will deride them. It were a braue thing, if one man could diſpoſe of anothers ſoule, and reward it with either paine, or pleaſure, according to his owne will. Yet I muſt confeſſe this ingenuouſly; that I put ſo great a difference betweene

the ancient and moderne papiſts, as that I reſolue rather that the former are taken to mercy, then that the later either are, or ſhall be. The former inſtructed no men to deſtruction, with king-killing doctrine: the later teache

God renounce me, if I had not rather bee an Heathen, then a Chriſtiā and holde this mercileſſe Axiome for currant: for, I had rather bee an honeſt Turke, then a knauiſh Chriſtian. Papiſtrie and Treaſon

now are growen to be Accidentia concomitantia; and they giue mutuall attendaunce one on the other. Neither did the auncient Prieſts ſo worke vpon the frailtie of ſilly women, as theſe doe: neither were they ſo lecherous, as theſe are. Theſe are they whom Saint Paul pointeth at, ſaying; For of this ſort, are they
               1. Ti. 3. 6 
               which creepe into houſes, and leade captiue ſimple women laden with ſinnes, and led with diuers luſts. Yet, for all this, our Puritans ought not to giue definitiue ſentence againſt them; but referre it to him, who will haue
               
               mercie on whom he will haue mercie. Theſe men, whoſe puritie hath made them vnconformable to the preſent Diſcipline of the Church, though they bee guiltie of Schiſme, yet they are not dangerous; but liue, and dye, without thought of ſlaughter: yet is there a tatling Treatiſe, entituled Herode and Pilate reconciled, wherein the author ſtriueth very hard, to proue that the Papiſts & Puritans are both alike dangerous; as holding the ſame treacherous tenents. He ſpetteth-out the venome of his tongue in the faces of Caluin, and Beza;

men, whoſe names his mouth ſhould not vſurpe, without reuerence. Hee may well wreſt their ſpeeches: but, well I know, hee can neuer inferre any pretended treaſon, from them. His booke is well laboured; and hee manifeſteth to the world, that hee hath read ſome thing: hee lacketh nothing but the iudgement of Tertullian; that is, that a man ought to imploy all hee hath or knoweth, in teſtimonium

but with plentie of good bookes, to make ſcarcitie of bad: whereas I for my part thinke, that the dailie encreaſe of triuiall trifling books, wil at the length conſume and annihilate the weighty and ſerious ones. Now-a-daies, almoſt euery Sect hath a ſeueral expoſition of the Text, and a diuerſe application. We may well crie-out with the ProphetPſal. 60. 1. 2. & 3. Dauid, O God thou haſt caſt vs out; thou haſt ſcattered vs: thou haſt beene angry; turne againe vnto vs. Thou haſt made the Land to tremble, and hast made it to gape: heale the breaches thereof;
               
               for it is ſhaken. Thou haſt ſhewed thy people heauy things: thou haſt made vs to drinke the wine of Giddines. It fatteth the ſoule of the Iewe, to ſee Chriſtianitie torne in peeces by ſchiſme and hereſie. He ſcorneth the head the more, becauſe hee ſees the members of the bodie ſo wound one the other. Oh, that wee could, with the harmony of an vnſeparable vnion, charme the eares of this Chriſtianities ſerpent!

As, for example, that God before he built this world, exerciſed himſelfe a long time in ſetting-vp and pulling-downe, before hee could learne to finiſh the frame hee hadde conceiued. Thou further ſayeſt, that God hath certaine appointed daies, wherein he afflicteth
               
               himſelfe, becauſe in choler he defaced thy citty, with thy temple: and tokens of this his felt ſorrow, thou makeſt to be lightning and thunder. Thou ſaieſt alſo, that God ordeined a ſacrifice amongſt the Iewes euery new Moone, to recompence the wrong he did to the Moone, in taking light from her to giue it to the Sunne. Thou farther ſayeſt, that he is angrie once a day, and then the crimſon combes of the Cookes waxe pale and bloudleſſe. Thou haſt alſo a prophane fable, that on a day there being a diſputation betweene certaine Rabbins, and R. Eliezer,

God gaue ſentence on Eliezers ſide: for which the Rabbins excōmunicated him; and then God ſmiling, ſaid, My children haue ouercome me. Thou ſayeſt alſo, that he that gainſayeth the words of the Scribes, deſerues more to be puniſhed, then he that contradicts the Law of Moſes: the one may be abſolued; the other muſt abſolutely die. Thou ſaieſt alſo, that he is no good Rabbin which doth not hate his enemy; nay, that doth not purſue reuenge euen vntill death. And hee that diſalloweth of any thing in theſe bookes, denieth God himſelfe. What God will

doe with thee, I know not: this I know, that no Nation hath kept her integritie but thou. Oh, would thou hadſt alſo kept thy ſinceritie in religion! It is more then a miracle to mee, that feare doth not weigh-downe the eye-lids of the Iewe, when he offers to looke-vp to heauen.

more reuerently of Chriſt, then the Iewe: for, he accounteth of him as of a great Prophet; the Iew, as of a falſe Prophet. Neither hath the Turke ſo groſſe abuſes and abſurdities, as hath the Iewe: which▪ whoſoeuer liſteth to compare, ſhall finde. The Turke hath many riddles, which rather merite laughter then loathing: and, for example ſake, we will ſet-down ſomeIn Alcor. Turc. fewe of them. What is that, which is firſt wood, and afterwards receiueth a ſpirit into it? It is there anſwered, Moſes Rod. What woman is that which onely came from
               
               a man? and what man is that which onely came from a woman? It is there ſaide, the former to be Eue, the later to be Chriſt. The rehearſall of more of theſe friuolous fooleries would coſt mee much time, and yeeld the Reader little profit: and therefore I will onelie heere inſert one or two things remarqueable in the Turkiſh Phiſiques. They hold, that the ſtarres hang by golden chaines: Againe, they ſaie, that a Bull beares the earth vpon his hornes; ſo that when the Bull ſhakes his head, an earth-quake enſues. Modeſty wil not let me enter into the

Turkes paradiſe; where all things are vncleane, and beyond meaſure baudy. Oh my God! who is there that rightlie vnderſtandes the courſes of mans life; the curſes due to it for the vices of it; and withall conſidereth the variances of religion; as alſo that Turkes inhabite the better halfe part of the world; Iewes and Atheiſts a quarter of the other halfe; Schiſmatickes & Heretickes three quarters of that quarter: who is there, I ſay, that weighing all theſe things, will not welcome, if not inuite death▪ ſpecially in this age; in which, that of Tacitus

is right true: et propter virtutes
               Tacit. hiſt. lib. 1. 
               certisſimum exitium: And vertues, ſaith he, are rewarded with certaine deſtruction. Vertue, looke to thy Eſſence; for, thou haſt almoſt loſt thy Exiſtence: thou haſt a Being of thy ſelf; but, ſcarce any Being in any other. Wherefore I exhort all thoſe, who either haue or loue vertue, to deſire to bee diſſolued, and to bee with Chriſt. Let them contemplate this, that death is the Orient of Weale, and the Occident of Woe; that is, the riſing of all comforts, and the fall and ſetting of all croſſes. Death is the ſole

ſanctuary for ſorrowe, the freedome from feare, hope's harbour, faith's faire field, the ending of a bad & beginning of a better life. Death is not ſo vgly as the world would make her; her lookes are louely: and when all the world diſdaines deſert, ſhee rewardes it. Wherefore, wee ſhould not with ſuch a fond childiſh griefe bewaile the death of our friends, whom mercy hath taken from miſerie. As when we ſee the ſunne eclipſed, wee grieue not; knowing it ſhall come to his former forme againe: euen ſo 
                  〈◊〉
                it is heere; we ſhould not fall into womaniſh

lamentations for the loſſe of them, whoſe bodies wee know ſhall riſe againe; who ſhal ſee God with thoſe eyes, with which they leaue to ſee the world: For, though they die to vs, they liue to the Lord. Wherefore, wee muſt not thinke, that Dauid lamēted the temporal death of his ſonne Abſolon; but, that his propheticke ſoule fore-ſawe that eternall death due to Diuells and their miniſters: for, to them, death bringes damnation. The wicked man dares not, in his greateſt pasſion, call to God for compasſion; but hides himſelf from his face,

hauing all his time beene glutted with forbidden fruite. If hee looke vp, hee ſees Gods iudgement hang ouer him: if downeward, he meditates his graue vnder him; and hell vnder it: if on both ſides of him, at each hand ſitteth horrour, and confuſion: if before him, he beholdeth Perdition, his hangman, dragging him on to his ſlaughter: if behinde him, Vengeance doggeth him at the heeles; the leaſt noiſe makes him expect his purſiuants: At laſt, he withdraweth himſelfe into his cabine, thinking to lock-out Death; who, in a moment,

locketh-vp his eye-lids, neuer more to open, till they ſhall ſee heauen gates ſhut againſt their maſter. Oh foole! reuolt from thy irreligious ſuperſtition, to a religious pietie; neither quake at that, whoſe power it is in thy power to conquer by an heartie penitence, and feruent prayer. Shrinke not at thy fatale blowe: thy death ſhall be life; and that, a bleſſed and eternall one. I, for my part, will account of death as of that which helps me to an vnualued bargaine; things eternall, for things momentarie: things truelie delightfull, for things falſely

deceitfull. Oh welcome minute, that ſhall free this body from ſo long an apprentiſeſhip of woe. And, indeede, what is there that ſhould holde or delight me heere? except to ſatisfie the vnordred appetites of the body, and vnlawfull deſires of the ſoule. But perhaps ſome wil vrge, that I am as yet in my ſpring of youth; which I grant: Yet am I glutted, and tired as much with the troubles of this Age, as a Priam, as a Neſtor. The dayes areEccleſiaſtes. 12. 1. alreadie come vpon mee, wherein I may truely ſay, I take no pleaſure in them. But, others will reply, that

I haue friends for whoſe ſake I ſhould deſire to liue. It is true indeede, that I haue friends; but, with-all, ſuch friends as Tacitus ſpeaketh of; Et quibus deer at inimicus,
               Tacit. hiſt. lib. 1. 
               ab amicis ſunt oppresſi: and they, ſaith he, to whom enemies were wanting were oppreſſed by their friends. I long to bee acquainted with my neerer kinred, to whom I ſhall ſay, Corruption thou

And thou, Lord of hoſts, grant, that when this my laſt and beſt day ſhall come, and thoſe harbingers of death ſummon me to appeare, that then I may bee readie: and grant alſo, that as, at the firſt, my body was willing to receiue my ſoule; ſo, at the laſt, my ſoule maie be willing to leaue my body. Thou louer of ſoules, be thou mercifull to my ſoule: and when mine eyes ſhall grow dimme, my lips black, my mouth drawen-vp, my

for my gratious Soueraigne, Faiths great defender.
