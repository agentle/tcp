      
         
            
            
            The poore man payes for all.
            
               This is but a dreame which here ſhall inſue:
               But the Author wiſhes his words were not true.
            
            To the tune of In ſlumbring ſleepe I lay.
            
            
               
                  
                  
               
               
                  AS I lay muſing all alone,
                  vpon my reſting bed,
                  Full many a cogitation
                  did come into my head:
                  And waking from my ſléepe, I
                  my dreame to mind did call,
                  Me thought I ſaw before mine eyes,
                  
                     how poore men payes for all.
                  
               
               
                  A many obiects did behold,
                  in this my frightfull Dreame,
                  A part of them I will vnfold:
                  and though my preſent Theame
                  Is but a fancy you may ſay,
                  yet many things not fall
                  Too true alas: for at this day
                  
                     the poore man payes for all.
                  
               
               
                  Me thought I ſaw (which cauſ'd my care)
                  what I wiſh were a fable,
                  That poore men ſtill inforced are
                  to pay more then they are able:
                  Me thought I heard them wéeping ſay,
                  their ſubſtance was but ſmall,
                  For rich men will beare all the ſway,
                  
                     and poore men pay for all.
                  
               
               
                  Me thought I ſaw how wealthy men
                  did grind the poore mens faces,
                  And greedily did prey on them,
                  not pittying their caſes:
               
               
                  They make them toyle and labour ſore
                  for wages too too ſmall:
                  The rich men in the Tauernes rore:
                  
                     but poore men pay for all.
                  
               
               
                  Me thought I ſaw an Vſurer old,
                  walke in his For-ſur'd gowne,
                  Whoſe wealth and eminence controld
                  the moſt men in the Towns:
                  His wealth he by extortion got,
                  and roſe by others fall,
                  He had what his hands earned not,
                  
                     but poore men pay for all.
                  
               
               
                  Me thought I ſaw a Courtier proud
                  goe ſwaggering along,
                  That vnto any ſcarce allow'd
                  the office of his tongue:
                  Me thought, wert not for bribery,
                  his Peacocks plumes would fail,
                  He ruſſles out in brauery,
                  
                     but poore men pay for all.
                  
               
               
                  Me thought I met (ſore diſcontent)
                  ſome poore men on the way,
                  I aſked one whither he went
                  ſo faſt and could not ſtay?
                  Quoth he, I muſt goe take my Leaſe,
                  or elſe another ſhall:
                  My Landlords riches doe increaſe,
                  
                     but poore men pay for all.
                  
               
            
            
               
               The ſecond part.
               To the ſame tune▪
               
               
                  
                  
               
               
                  ME thought I ſaw moſt ſtately wiues,
                  goe ietting on the way,
                  That liue delightfull idle liues,
                  and go in garments gay,
                  That with the moon their ſhapes doe change
                  or elſe thei'l chide and brawle,
                  Thus women goe like monſters ſtrange,
                  
                     and poore men pay for all,
                  
               
               
                  Me thought I was i'th Countrey,
                  where poore men take great paines,
                  And labour hard continually,
                  onely for-rich mens gaines,
                  Like th'Iſraelites in Egypt,
                  
                  the poore are kept in thrall:
                  The taſk-maſters are playing kept.
                  
                     but poore men pay for all.
                  
               
               
                  Me thought I ſaw poore Tradeſmen
                  ith'City and elſe-where,
                  Whom rich men kéepe as heads-men,
                  in bondage care and feare:
                  Thei'l haue them worke for what they liſt,
                  thus weakeſt goe to the wall,
                  The rich men eate and drinke the beſt,
                  
                     but poore men pay for all.
                  
               
               
                  Me thought I ſaw two Lawyers baſe
                  one to another ſay.
                  We haue had in hand this poore mans Caſe,
                  a twelue-month and a day.
                  And yet wéel not contented be
                  to let the matter fall,
                  Beare thou with me & Ile-beare with thée,
                  
                     while poore men pay for all,
                  
               
               
                  Me thought I ſaw a red-noſe Oaſt,
                  as fat as he could wallow,
                  Whoſe carka
                        •
                     ſſe, if it ſhould be roaſt,
                  would drop ſeuen ſtone of tallow,
                  He growes rich out of meaſure,
                  with filling meaſure ſmall,
                  He liues in mirth and pleaſure,
                  
                     but poore men pay for all.
                  
               
               
                  And ſo likewiſe the Brewer ſtout,
                  the Chaudler and the Baker,
                  The Mault-man alſo without doubt,
                  and the Tobacco-taker,
                  Though they be proud and ſtately growne,
                  and beare themſelues ſo tall,
                  Yet to the world it is well knowne,
                  
                     that poore men pay for all.
                  
               
               
                  Euen as the mighty Fiſhes ſtill,
                  doe féed vpon the leſſe;
                  So rich men, might they haue their will,
                  would on the poore men ceaze:
                  It is a prouerbe old and true,
                  that weakeſt goe toth' wall,
                  Rich men can drinke till th' sky looke blue,
                  
                     but poore men pay for all.
                  
               
               
                  But now, as I before did ſay,
                  this is but a Dreame indéed,
                  Though all dreames proue not true, ſome m
                        〈…〉
                     
                  
                  hap right as I doe reade.
                  And if that any come to paſſe,
                  I doubt this my Dreame ſhall:
                  For ſtill tis found too true a caſe,
                  
                     that poore men pay for all.
