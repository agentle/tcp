               CHIEFLY
Swelling with multiplicity of glorious titles, as one
of the greatest Monarchs of the earth, that being admired of
all, his greatness might amaze all, and so by degrees
seeking covertly to tyrannize over all, When
as in deed and truth, the greatest part
of his pretended Greatnesse is but a
windy crack of an ambitious
minde.

            GEntle Reader, although in respect of the Authours
absence, the copie now presented be not so compleat
throughout as it should; yet because (as we say in
the prouerb) Delayes are dangerous, specially in matters
of moment, and hoping it is not materially defectiue in any
thing, from the perfectest Copie or Authors minde, I haue
presumed to publish it as it is, wishing no lesse good successe,
then the Author himselfe intended; and so desiring my
upright meaning may be accepted in good part by the Courteous
Reader, I bid thee Farewell.
         
      
      
         
            
            A DISCOVRSE
TENDRED TO HIS MAIESTIE
King of Great Brittaine &c. touching some
Spanish practises to serue their
own ends.
            
               THE motiue of this Discourse, most renounned
Soueraigne, which at this time I intend to
handle, for that it hath relation to two ends to
periods, to wit, peace and warre, the one much to be
preferred before the other, as well by diuine, as human
Arguments; yet for that the time agreeing with the
necessity, we are in regard of the feare of the Spanish
greatnesse hereafter, which vndoubtedly he will attain
unto by the innumerable masses of his Indian treasures
which are the nerues and sinnewes of all martiall intendments,
by which faire opportunityes offered vnto
the greatnesse of his desire, for the enlargment of his
state, glory and renowne, and that there may be no
obiect that may impidiment the let thereof, but onely
a determination in himselfe not to offend his neighbours,
I shall hardly beleeu that he will so much differ
from his Progenitors, I meane Eerdinand, Charles and
Phillip, who rased not the fame of the Spanish Monarchie,
by iust, noble and laudible warres, but by cruell,
bloudy and treacherous inuasions, especially against
Princes of their own blood; who under pretence of relieuing

or giuing them aide against the oppression of
others, haue made these passages of vnmoueable assurance,
for the obtaining of the lands, Crownes and liues
of their neerest Allies, which giueth mee no cause of
hope of his good dealing towards your Highness,
and the State, who are neither allied vnto him
by blood, as these former Princes were, nor tyed
vnto him by the offices of Confederacie, whereby for
former good turnes receiued, hee might let you liue in
peace: but contrarily, wee being onely the stop of the
Spanish fury of this part of the world; and a Nation
who haue not onely giuen him infinite disgraces, as
well by open battell, as sundry inuasions and incursions,
made vpon his frontier Townes and Territories,
to the irrecouerable dishonor of the Spanish people,
and vnmasking his former forces to all men; which
indeede are but a meere shew, and frighting them onely;
knowing their Greatnesse depends with filling the
world with an imagination of their Mightinesse, For
the Spaniard may well be compared to a drumme, or
emptie vessell, that being beaten vpon, makes a great
and terrible noise; but come nearer them, breake
them and looke into them, and there is nothing
within can hurt you. Or rather like the Asse, that
wrapt himselfe in the Lyons skinne, and marched a
farre off, to strike terrour into the hearts of the
beasts; but when the Fox drew neere, hee not onely
perceiued his long eares, but likewise discouered him
and made him a iest to all the beasts of the Forrest.
So that I inferre (most gracious Soueraigne) that vnlesse
hee now prevaile with you, and by that meanes
gaine a peace to make himselfe more strong for a fitter

time to hunt you and your neighbours; his forces at
this time, in respect of you and your Confederates,
are so weake and resistable, as it may well appeare vnto
your Highnesse, that his Monarchie is rather maintained
by Opinion then Might; as it hath euer stood
since the losse of the low Countries (if it had beene
with iudgement exquisitely looked into) rather by
giuing out greater rumours of power, and by secrecie,
then by the greatnesse of their owne forces.
So as to make this shadow a Substance, whereby not
onely his Indies should be sure, but all the world
tremble at his greatnesse. What oath is it that hee
whhld keepe? What condition that he would not
breake? Or, what opporunitie that he would let slip
for the accomplishment thereof, if thereby he might
assure himselef of the Ile? And therefore, though I
commend peace before warre; yet if the Countrey
cannot obtaine a good peace without warre, I thinke
it consequently followes, that it is necessary for you
to make a warre with your enemie, whilst you
haue the aduantage in your hands, whereby you may
lay a sure foundation of a sure peace for your Selfe, Posteritie
and State for after ages; rather then to dreame
of a peace which shall no longer hold, then he is able
by breaking to reuenge. For doubtlesse in the preservation
of Kingdomes, it is no injurie to doe that to your
enimie, which hee would doe vnto you, if hee could.
And therefore those Princes, States or people whosoeuer,
that shall build so firmely vpon the condition of
peace to be kept by the enimie, the breach whereof
may turn to his or their great danger or destruction; that
Prince, State or people, in my opinion haue either little

the iudgement of themselues, or are ill aduised of the
Councell: Securitie of their owne estates, or too much
fidelity to others, haue not onely been the destruction
of many families, but likewise of great and potent
Kingdoms, Prouinces & Townes. And therfore to this
day, there could neuer be found so great lasetie to priuate
men or publique States, as mistrust; as appeareth
by Dimosthenes in his second to the Athenians against
Phillip of Macedon.
                   There are (quoth he) deuised
many strengths and defences for the maintenance
of Cities and Townes, as Trenches, Walls, Ramparts,
Dikes, Bulwarkes, and such like, the which
are made by mens hands, with great cost and charge:
but nature (faith he) hath giuen to all wise men a
a common defence and safeguard; the which as it
is profitable to all men particularly, so it is a most
wholsome and sure holde and fortresse, to all
Countries and Citties, against all manner of tyrannie,
and what fortes to mistrust, that which if it
be well and surely kept, it will preserue and keepe
you all. And therefore to preuent danger in a conuenient
season, and to prouide in time against the
worst, is a thing most wholesome, necessary, and
worthy of greatest commendations. For as foresight
makes men wary, so confident suspition helpeth
judgement, and bringeth to light many hidden
practises: and those that doe not feare the complots
of their enemies, nor regard of forces preparations
against them, are doubtlesse neere some disastrous
fortune, or extreame, ruine of their estates and fortunes.
               How preiuditiall their treaties of peace haue euer

been to such Princes or States with whom they haue
contended, is most evident, as well to us, as other
Nations, as appeares by their Armado in 88, who
came with fire and sword to cut the throats of the
people of this land: (had not God prevented their
treacherous resolutions.) At the selfe same time
they had entertained us with a maine shew of a desire
of peace, and our Commissioners being with them
for the same purpose. As also when Ferdinand of
Aragon the last, and Phillip Archduke of Austria were
in treaty of marriage of Madam Stawij of France,
with Charles the fifth, and after was concluded, sworn
and confirmed at Blois, the King of France being
Lewis the twelfth; his Lieftenants mistrusting nothing
in respect of the premises, the Spaniards set
upon them, defeating two French Armies, the one at
Calabria, under the conduct of the Lord D Aubigney;
the other at Cernigola, led by the Duke of Nemuers;
by which treacherous overthrow of these two noble
Captaines, by don Consolis de Cordus, called the
great Captaine Commander of the Spaniards in these
parts: they arested from the French, most of the
peeces in Italy, which they keepe untill this day. And
therefore howsoever other men be opinionated of
the Spanish faith and fidelity with your Majesty and
State, yet for my part, I will thinke of them, and
their promises, as a Noble man of Athens thought of
a certaine Oratour. Your words (quoth he) my
friends are like the Cypresse, which although great
and high, beare no fruit. And truely, as they are
Spaniards I cannot well blame them; for they well
know, that the Crowne of Spaine is at stake, and all

the Indies, and his other Signiories, and therefore
will not faile to put in practise all tricks that may win
the game, though it be by foule play. For if he
haue not peace with England at this time, it is not unknowne
unto him that the foundation of his Monarchy
will be shaken in peeces. And we cannot but
see this, and yet will take no advantage thereof, whereby
we may secure our selves both for present and future
times; we may be compared to the Athenians,
of whom I haue spoken before, who by Titus Livius
report were men, who knew what to doe, but would
not doe it: which is a fault so ominous to all states,
that it not onely presenteth it selfe against; but likewise
followeth disasters and ruine to the Commonwealth
that refuseth. For opportunitie doth not attend
upon Captaines and Councellours pleasures,
but sheweth it selfe on a suddaine; and if not imbraced,
passeth away without returning; And therefore
the advantages that one State, that are enemies
hath of another, happen so seldome to the Globes,
as Saturn finisheth his course but in 30 yeares. But
our enemy is free, and I speake it to his honour, from
this base and earthly resolution; for it is reported of
them, by this speciall vertue, they haue raysed their
state to so high a pitch: which is, that no people can
readier finde the occasion, or sooner take, or resolue
it, when it is offered. And doubtlesse, to say the
truth, I am much more fearefull of the Spanish proceedings,
for that he goeth by precedent: which is
an excellent kind of discipline, as well in Martiall as
civill actions; especially when the action is grounded
upon a sure foundation. And as all Kings

and Captaines which desire to attain to great things,
doe imitate some one Prince, or Generall that hath
preceded them: so doubtlesse haue the Kings of
Spaine for these many yeares, imitated in all their
actions (as neere as the time and States with whom
they haue contended would giue them leaue) that
noble, valiant and politick Captain Phillip of Macedon,
who indeede laid the foundation of his sons Monarchy,
& this was his Maxime, That where force could not
preuail, he alwaies used bribes and mony to corrupt the principall
of the inhabitants: Insomuch that at a certain time
at the assault of a Citie, which to a Captaine of his
seemed impregnable, and therefore thought to divert
his purpose in the besieging thereof. Thou art
a foole (quoth he) for I will haue this great Citie,
notwithstanding the walles and ramparts, if the
Gates be so big that an Asse laden with gold can
but enter. And questionlesse, if your Majestie
would but search into the Spaniards proceedings,
since he had the Indies, you should acquaint your
selfe with many such presidents of their part, to be
a warning to you to looke at this time advisedly to
your owne safety, lest you fall into the like misfortunes.
And although I could alledge many which
(for brevities sake) I omit, yet I will recite one (left
it should be thought I knew none) which is, viz.
                  When Ferdinand of Aragon saw, by the sword he
could not get the country of Rowsilton and Perpignan,
out of the hands of Charles the French King,
which as they say had been ingaged to Lewis the 11,
he fell to practise with them of Religion; wherefore
he corrupted with a great summe of mony one

                     Oliver Maillandor, as some say, Iohn de Madron a
Franciscan Frier, Confessor to the Lady Brawnen
the Kings sister, who vnder the roote of Religion,
cloaking his hypocrysie and coveteousnesse, perswaded
this simple Lady, that unlesse restitution
was made of those Territories to the King of Spaine,
his government could not prosper, nor please God;
she being moved in conscience with this Friers
perswasions, brake this matter to Lewis of Amboise
Bishop of S. Albie, the Kings Schoolemaster, who
together with her, so terrified the Kings conscience,
that hee not onely made restitution of the said Territories,
by the said Bishop, but likewise freely released
to the King of Spaine, the said Ferdinand, all
the mony that Lewis his father had paid for them:
Marry with condition, that the said King and his
Successors should ever loue and honour the King of
Frace, that he should make no warres against it,
nor aide with mony, victuals nor counsell, any enemies
thereof, nor permit them to haue passage
through their Dominions. And thus were the
countries restored to the Frenchmens griefe. But
the French King misreckoned himselfe in the Spanish
fidelity, for having occasion to warre in Italy
shortly after, he had no sooner past the Mountaines,
but the King of Spaine forgat all his kindness, and began
to practise a league with his enemies. So as I inferre
(mighty Prince) that either by shew of Religion,
or subtle and sophisticall Arguments; or in desire
you haue to trust some about you, on whose shoulders
ever (in regard of your opinion of their wisedomes
and fidelities) you cast your selfe, and your

care of your estate, in all, or either of these, you are
like, without the more grace of God, to receiue disadvantage
in this your peace-making (and yet perhaps
no fault in them.) For it seemes to me wonderfull,
that the truth of things being one; yet may falshood
be so apparelled with the habits of likelihood
and truth, as (changing countenance) it is often retained
in stead thereof. And for as much as upon this
Treatie now in hand, not onely dependeth your
own happiness, the happiness of your noble Issue,
States, Kingdoms, Subiects, or whatsoever else is deer
unto you; but likewise the happinesse or unhappinesse
of all the Princes of Europe. So (most gracious
Lord) in respect of these great and mighty dependances,
as well in regard of your owne particular, as
generall good of the Christian Common-wealth,
which so long hath groaned under the feare of the
Spanish greatnesse, digest and distinguish every particular;
and in a point, in your owne person, without
trusting of any man with a matter of great importance:
which although it will be very intricate by
the diuersitie of so many things as will offer themselues
to be considered, yet (renoumed Soveraigne)
it will be very profitable to your Highnesse, and most
acceptable and pleasing to the people, when they
shall heare and see the great care the King hath of
them and their safety: For as Commines saith, hee
thinketh it the greatest plague that God can lay upon
a Realme to giue them such a Prince as shall in
great things giue his Authority unto others, which
most especially in such a case as this hee ought to reserue
unto himselfe. Although I confesse Princes

ought to haue Ministers in all things, especially in
great matters, but not to conclude any thing without
the Princes assent; nor with him neither, but by the
relation of many circumstances, in regard of that
affinity which truth and falsehood haue in many matters
of great moment. And yet I protest out of my
owne opinion, I am no way jealous of any of the
Councell; for as for them I hold them to be all most
noble and worthy personages, and fit to manage great
Kingdomes, as part of the Indies, and other Seigniories:
which are as fit for you to take, as the King of
Spaine to keep; which by your just command and valour
of the English and Scottish Nations shall be gained
unto you and your posterity; without which, whatsoever
your Selfe thinketh, or other men say, neither
you, nor your posterity can ever be safe, upon probable
and reasonable grounds, if the Spaniards intend
to disquiet you, as I will now my selfe proue; and as
these following projects made by the Castilian themselues, may appeare, by the necessity they are in to be
Masters of the Ile, viz. 
                  That a mighty King, determining
to preserue his owne, hath no better meanes
then by conquering that of another mans; alwayes
holding this as a Maxime, That whosoeuer preserveth
getting nothing, neither by keeping his owne,
can subdue the will of perverse men, that they may
not be able to make him a disturbance. These reasons
ought more to preuaile with your Majestie
(quoth he) then with any other Prince, since you
hold your great State much dispersed, and the greatest
part of your power consists in things moueable
and uncertaine, which are the Indian Fleet; which

neither Garrisons, Fortresses, nor any good proceedings
can hardly assure; although your Maiestie had
great forces and power: as at this present wee may
well perceiue by this Pirat Drake, who with nothing
is able to molest the whole world, notwithstanding
the provisions which are made on your Majesties
behalfe for the preventing thereof. Wherefore (saith
he) let your Majestie entertaine an enterprise against
England; which both is, and may be the principall
disturber of your Indian Fleete and Commerce.
Neither let your Majesty suppose there can be a better
or safer way, for the quiet of States, or the advancement
of your certaine Greatness, then by removing
this Mountaine of Disquiet to your most
high and Kingly purposes, and conquering of this
Ile. As also Don Phillip the second, of Castile, having
a great and earnest desire to make himselfe Master
of this Ile of the world, and peceiving two obstacles
to curb his proceedings in that kind; to wit, the
warres of the Netherlands, and the Iealousie of this
State of ours hath ever had of his Greatnesse; and
being desirous to haue the fountaine of this happinesse
to spring from one of those two heads determining
to build this resolution, which with most
ease, most honour, most safety, and most advantage,
might be carried to his after designes. Vpon consideration
whereof, and mature deliberation, reasons
were alleged pro & contra, amongst which, in my
iudgement, some are most prevailent reasons, and
such doubts as the Spanish King from the mouth of
him who made Reason his ground, and Experience
his schoolmaster for what he said, and are following.

                  It is my determination in this present Discourse (said
he) to shew, as your renoumed Seigniorie commandeth
me, by way of Reall foundation, that it is much
more expedient for that purpose of your Catholike
Majestie to moue your war against England then the
Netherlands, declaring thus much notwithstanding
reall foundation in this point, I mean not common
principles of nature, or of science, neither of Mathematicall
demonstrations of this present subject,
is not capable, but rather reasons probably grounded
upon truth. There are many, who but observing
the first view of your Catholicke Majesties interest
to Flanders and England affirm, that though this
Iland by just pretention pertaineth to your Majestie,
yet you are so much the more bound to recover
those countries of the Netherlands rather then conquer
England; by how much by all policie, the preservation
of things already possessed, must goe before
things never injoyed. But though this be a great position
in publicke affaires, yet we intreating of matters
of State (I) will not judge it of that weight
as that it may weigh downe the ballance; which galling
the one side more then the other, might impaire
the whole summe and safetie of things. Wee
must consider what ought; but further how it is possible,
more profitable, more easie, more expedient
to be done. For oftentimes Princes are so pricked to
warre by the stimulation of honour, or of their desire
to some enterprise, as that the bridle of many
other circumstances, which would requisitely be
considered, cannot draw them back. For an example
of this, wee may set before our eyes the Venetian
                     
Common wealth, who thinking of nothing else
but their duty to be revenged on the Duke of Millain;
preferred immoderate ambition before all
other respects; and so, too late, remembered, that the
office of prudence, is to moderate passions, and spleen
in important resolutions: especially when they draw
after them a taile or traine of great inconveniences.
The consideration thereof; that we are more bound
to preserue the things we possesse, then conquer
new, is not sufficient to conclude that your Majesty
ought to take in hand the enterprise of Flanders rather
then England; neither in that so importunate affiaires
should we seeke occasion so light, But to the end it
may appear evidently, that in every respect your Majestie
is bound to the enterprise of England, I will
before any thing establish a foundation to that
whole edifice of my opinion, viz. That in subduing
of England, you overcome at the same time the Netherlands
also; but having overcome the Netherlands,
England is not presentiy subdued; neither doth per-adventure
the hope increase that you shall after conquer
it. But I affirme moreover, that to conquer England
is not an action more difficult, or lesse certaine,
then if it were the Netherlands: For if England doe
consequently draw after it the Netherlands; and if it
be more easie and more secure, who doubteth, but
he that should pervert this course would be a right
destroyer of Opportunity; and so become the forger
of his owne disgrace. But I will proue with prevailent
Reasons, that one and the other member of my
foundation, which is, that the victorie of England, is
more profitable then that of the Netherlands, & more

easie to obtaine. As for the proofe of my first foundation,
I betake my selfe to these principall heads.
The first is: If the Netherlands had not maintained
warre so many yeares, but by the aide and succour of
England; that which hath still supplyed fewell to the
flames and fire of the rebellion: For if England
would but faile them it is cleere, they could not stand
out; no more then a living body can be preserved
without nourishment and it is more securely extinguisht
by taking away the maintenance and nourishment
thereof, then by striving to quench it by his
contrary: For having no nourishment at all, the violent
heate is used against it selfe, and so by it selfe consumed:
but we determining to overcome it by the
contrary, it may fall out, that insteed of extinguishing
it, the force of it may be much increased, if the
contrary be subdued by the same: And therfore the
Florentines then, and not before, quenched the fire of
the Pison rebellion, when they tooke away the fewell
and nourishment from it, which came from strangers,
by cutting off Princes their Collegates, and
the gaining their Citie in one action; which otherwise
all their owne force, and their Confederates
would not haue been sufficient to obtaine. The other
is; for if England with her succours which shee sendeth,
not onely maintaineth the Netherlands secure,
with the bare hope of her shadow: for they count
themselues in banishment, as it were, while they see
before their eyes the Spanish forces; and so would still
doe, if they did not know the English will alwaies
be ready to buckle with any one, that with a mighty
Fleet should passe by these parts. In this respect the

                     Athenians thought themselues sure from Phillips
force, while the Towne of Ohinton stood out; and so
on the contrary, when the Ohintons were overcome,
then saw they no impediments that could keepe the
enemy from them. Even so, if England should fall
into the hands of your Majestie, the whole foundation
of the Rebells obstinacy were shaken, the fortresse
and backe being removed, by favour of which
they haue dayly nourished the spirits of pride and insolencie:
so as the soule and spirit yeeldeth England,
being taken away; we may perceiue that the conquest
of the Netherlands is easily brought forth by the victorie,
as her lawfull daughter; and that the end followeth
not as the daughter, or as the other being her
mother, but even as inseparably, as the shadow
the body, or nourishment the life. As also this reason
which I will now recite, is infallibly grounded
upon the direct rule of Art Millitarie: which is, that
you ought never to imploy your selfe in the assault
of any place, if their remaine still at your backe a
mighty meanes of some disturbance: Wherefore it
is no sound deliberation to fasten first on the enterprise
of the Netherlands; when you leaue one ill-affected
on your back, which peradventure may suddenly
assail and break through in the midst of the Catholike
Army, in the heart of the warres with the
Netherlands. Charles the 5, his attempt in Province
had unhappy successe, for no other cause but that he
contemned the advise of the Marquis Masto: which
was, that first, before anything, he should expugne
the fortresse. But that resolution being not taken by
Charles, was no lesse pernitious to the Imperialists

then to the Author of that Councell, Antonio de
Leva. Another reason is, attempting the warre upon
the Netherlands, you come to buckle with braue
experienced Souldiers, and men brought up in
warre; as on the contrary, the English want Art
and Discipline Millitarie. I may giue the same
comparison, that may be made betweene Idlenesse
and Experience; armed and unarmed; and how
advantagious it is to fight with unskilfull Souldiers:
Amongst many other; the example of Meltiades,
in the fielde of Manathon, sheweth evidently;
who with lesse then ten thousand braue Souldiers,
put to flight the force of unhappy Xerxes, who
had more then six hundred thousand with him. An
other is, that the Netherlands must be conquered by
handfulls, and haue full, or whole Armes imployed
in beleagering this or that Fort; otherwise per-adventure
of no great importance; but as it may
be a stop to his course of victory, that goeth about
to seiz upon the Country. Whereas contrarily England
hath no strong Towres or Fortresses, as well
within as without: there is no doubt of that enterprise,
and is as much more easie then this; as it is
a lesse matter to overcome them that doe not
resist, then those that doe fight upon warlike
advantages. There is no better example to bee produced
to your Highnesse, then of the selfe same
Countrie of the Netherlands; in which, notwithstanding
that your Majestie hath placed such
strong Garrisons, yet in every step such prevailent
accidents doe occurre, that oftentimes the Assaylants
are overcome, by the often oppositions that

these Fortresses use towards them: Even as on the
contrary, the Kingdome of Portugal, there being
no convenient Fortresses to giue impediment
to the forces of the Souldiers, were suffered to
enter into the very heart of the land; they being
not able to make any maner of defences to
defend the same. Another reason is, for that the
Fortresses are as prejudiciall to the Assaylants, after
they haue obtained them, as they were before, by
reason the Conquerour is forced to distribute his
Army into many members, by which they are greatly
weakned. So that, by this that hath been spoken,
it may appeare, that it is much more convenient; nay,
as it seemeth, much more easie for your Highnes to
push at England then the Netherlands; and therefore I
will discourse of that Enterprise; not in comparison
of the other, as heeretofore I haue done, but in respect
of it selfe; manifesting certaine principles, which doe
better declare and make manifest the opportunity &
facility therof. In my opinion therfore it is a thing not
to be doubted, if medicine is then truely so called
wholesome, when it hath reference, not onely to the
offended part or member, but further to cut off the
roote of the evill. And therefore if your Majesty shall
enter into the conquest of the Netherlands, you but
peradventure cure the wounds of that rebellion, but
you shall not evacuate the causes of the beginnings of
these ill humors, which haue dayly sent nourishment
to the disease: considering England is the place which
hath given sustenance to the rebellious States. And
though these Provinces were yours for this present,
disposition; yet what can that be, in a body subject to

continuall suggestion of matter, which in it owne nature
presenteth in the stomack some portion of offensiue
humour: Your Majestie must therfore necessarily
assault England; to the end you may afterwards either
securely digest, or evacuate these concourses:
But to discourse more at large of the facility of the
enterprise; I deny not truely but that England is a
very mighty Kingdome; and the greatest Iland that
ever wee finde any mention made of by the Ancients,
seeing it containeth Scotland within the same,
running 2000 miles in a circuit, although our moderne
Writers make a computation of 200 lesse. By
Nature it hath beene favoured with a security of a
wall, or with a rampart: but yet notwithstanding
it is most true, that the reputation that that Iland
holdeth in warlike actions, is rather grounded on
that it was in time past, then that which it hath at
this present: and therefore as it often happeneth,
the minde growne great, with the bundles of imaginations
wherewith it is maintained, though the
foundation whereon it dependeth be changed, and
diminished: Yet for all that, is the estimation of
England great in our mindes, because wee all behold
it with the selfe same eye of consideration, as wee
are wont to doe at all other times; when as in ancient,
for succession of more then 300 years, it
possessed Normandie, Britaine, Gutenne and Gascoigne,
and made Scotland tributary, and for a long time
enjoyed the most part of the Kingdome of France,
upon which Henry the 6, was publiquely crowned
at Paris. But those that haue diligently observed
her now when shee is deprived of so great forces

and aide, will judge that she is greater through
the reputation of her ancient fame, then for the
quality of her persent power and force: and that
shee is now no more England, so grievous and terrible
to the greatest Princes of Europe; and since
that with so unhappy a resolution shee fell into obscurity,
shee hath beene driven of necessity to submit
her selfe to those fearefull things, which alteration
of Religion and faith draw after them. A most
mighty and prevailent meanes to the ruine and declination
of States: For if Religion be the onely
base of all the peoples obedience and loyalty, who
doubteth, but that being removed, all rule of life
goeth to the ground; and together all lawes, both
Divine and Humane haue dispensation. In which
parties, or rather habites, of this most pernicious
beast, are most miserable, how much the mutations
haue beene sudden and violent; as aboue all other,
these of England haue beene, which from the height
of Religion threw it selfe headlong into the depth
of Infidelity; from whence rising againe into the
Catholike light from whence it came; and a fresh
to fall ruinously into the darknesse of heresie:
which is so prejudiciall unto States, as there is no
greater pestilencie; or that more weakens the sollidity
of their forces. England therefore in these outragious
stormes must needs haue suffered ship,
wrack, of which we may plainely see the effects,
if wee doe but obserue shee hath lost the foundation,
whereupon no lesse her reputation, then security
was grounded: that is, shee hath lost the power
and authority which sometimes shee had in sea-affaires;

for in times past this Iland maintained a
great number of Shippes, and kept a continuall
Fleete of Armes, whereupon it came to passe; that
minding to try the strength of her owne forces, the
preparation was admirable; amongst others wee
may see that when Henry the sixth of England,
went against Charles the sixth of France, with neere
eight hundred great Ships, which made a bridge
over the Ocean: but the quantity of that Iland is
so diverse, and changed, that since the dayes of
Henry seventh and eighth, it hath not beene able to
maintaine one hundred ordinary Ships; which it was
wont to wey, and haue in readinesse for the security
of the State: and further, this Iland hath been
put to such pinches, that they haue not onely beene
constrained to diminish, but to sell out-right a great
part of their Shipping, which both was, and is,
their onely securitie from forraigne danger: so
much more urgent in Princes is feare of present poverty,
then the respect of their future safety. So that
now, comming to resolue on the point of facility,
that your Majesty shall now finde in that Enterprise
against this Iland, I will offer to your Highnesse
two principall heads; the one of the Defendant,
the other of the Assaylant, whereby I will shew, that
the assayled is as unable to defend, as the Defendant
is to assayle. As for the Defendant (which is
the Kingdome of England) it may certainly be averred,
that it cannot stand out in defensiue warre
against the forces of your Majestie, if you will
but invade it with the prouisions, which is easie
for you to compasse, and such as the Enterprise,

and importance of the action requireth, the
which I will cleerely shew for diuers respect. The
first is; because, as I haue said, the Ile of England is
poore; and therefore is her debility such, as if she
should go about to manage a defensiue was against
so mighty and potent, as your Catholike Majestie,
she might as well goe about to sustaine heaven
on her shoulders, being neither Alcides nor
Atlas. The second is, for the consideration of
the necessitie which possesseth there the State of
England; hath no more in readinesse such number
of shippes as were sometimes maintained for
the protection and security of their Kingdome.
The third is, that the Kingdom of England, by carelesnesse
neglected, or by pouertie omitted, to
haue alwayes in readinesse; prepared, or practised
Men, Armes, or provision, as all other
Princes haue, to the end they may be a present remedy
to all suddain Insurrections, which groweth
either at home or abroad. The fourth is, because
the desire of Innovation is proper to the Kingdome,
whose mindes doe alwaies aspire after
change; and whosoever doth not obserue former
histories, will judge that her seditious conspiracies,
and every other effect of a disturbed and
moving minde, haue had their proper nest; being
stirred up with considerations, which being accompanied
with the ordinary dispositiō of the people
to be alwaies attempting of new things, may easily
of a suddaine, if it were assaulted, put the
Realme into confusion; especially when the Army
of so mightie an enemie as your Majestie,

shall present it selfe, whereby rebels may liberally
discover their hearts without being chastised. So as
this people being any way ill-affected, which meeting
with their manner of disposition, may peradventure
easily giue occasion, if your Majesty had
no party in England, which you shall never faile off
to some vnlooked for action, if your Catholik Armies
did but shew themselues. It being so ordinary
a matter with that people, whē they are masked
with som great passion, either of hatred or disdain
towards them that governe, that they will be ever
ready to tak al courses in hand that may be hurtful
to him: Euen so that Tantanus discontented with
government of Cajus Iberius, brought in before his
face the Carthagenians. First, the English in respect
of their ancient greatnesse, haue bin more accustomed
to molest others, then to be molested themselues;
and when they shall see themselues overwhelmed,
as it were with an innumeratiō of braue
Souldiers and Captaines, they will grow wonderfully
astonied: even as that change of fortunes
countenanc is a terible spectacle to those to whom
this sight is unusuall: for by that meanes Greece
which was sometimes Empresse of the whole East,
fell suddenly into other mens hands; who of an
Assaylant, became assayled. And lastly, though
nature get thus much in behalfe of them, that England
be well furnished with Armes, men, victuals,
and ships, and whatsoever else is necessary for the
warres; yet (say I) all this is nothing, when the
quality and condition is wanting, which giueth
form and essence to all enterprises; which is mony:

which the Kingdome of England, no lesse through
the scarcity of Revenues, as by the charge of ordinary
expences is brought unto; which they shall
never be able to recover, by their trades and Commerce,
if the use of the sea be taken from them:
and therefore will never be able to supply expence
of a defensiue Army Royall, when it hath scarcely
enough to supply their own necessaries, especially
against so great and magnificent a Prince as your
most Catholike Majestie, who embraceth within
the circuits of your Dominions, the whole Diameter
of the earthly Globe, and possesseth more
land at this day, then all the Monarchs and Republiques
of the world haue: A most opulent Prince
in Armes, Men, Mony, Souldiers, Captains, Ships,
Victuals, and all other provision of warre: and a
Prince, who like a Moderator, or Arbitrator, seemeth
to hold in his hands, the bridle of Empire, both
of the sea & land. And whereas it may be objected
that the Gallies which doe you no service in that
expidition, being vessels of great consequence in
battels by sea: your enterprise of Portugal, and of
the Iland, if it did not quite remoue it; yet did it
much abate the superstitious credulity of ours▪ that
those Vessels are not good at any time to passe the
Ocean withall; as if there were no faire weather in
that sea in the Summer; or that faire weather were
abortiue in shipping: there is no doubt but that
Gallies may securely passe, & hazard themselues in
that Sea in the Summer, for three moneths: And
those that will object the contrary, by the overthrow
of the sea ther, let them be contented to observe

well, that the same Anchor met not with
no inward, but outward occasion, in the sea of that
overthrow: For Caesar ignorantly could not discerne
the time of the Moon which was then in the
full, and being mistaken by reason of her too much
humidity, doth use to disturb, not onely the
Ocean, but all the coasts, and the dominion shee
holdeth of the salt waters. And therfore in respect
of the great honesty and equity accompanying the
cause; with it so honourable and godly life, as
the planting the Christian faith and religion,
no obstacle can be sufficient to stay the force of
divine power, serving under the standerd of
Christ; and therefore most weake, and but a
shadow shall all humane helpe bee which shall
oppose it selfe against the will of the great Arbitrator.
But such as are the pretentions of your
Majestie over this Kingdome, and such the obligations
wherein you stand bound for the recovery
of your own, the title of a Grandfather and Predecessours
of famous memorie; as there is no enterprise
so peculiar and proper for you to undertake
as this: for that you goe not onely to possesse
your selfe of the right which you haue
to this Kingdome, but likewise to make your
selfe the most famous King that ever was in the
memory of all the Princes of the world; adding
by this meanes unto the Crowne of Spaine, a
Kingdome so illustrous, so mightie, and so famous.
               
               By the relation of the Spanish project, against this
State of England, most Illustrious Prince, may well

appeare unto your Highnesse, that the Spaniard himselfe
well knowes, that there is no way for the expectation
of his further Greatnesse; no great possession
of the high Monarchy, which he himselfe
alledgeth that he already enjoyeth, but the conquering
of this Ile, and adding it to the Crown of Spain;
and therefore, if he had any other meanes to attaine
to this, by him so violently longed for, then
by a peace: why should not your Majestie thinke,
that the peace hee meanes to make with you at this
time, is for that purpose, and for no other intent?
and therefore, my good Lord, I cannot, as
one standing upon the firme land, gaze upon the
shipwrack of my Countrie, being so doubtfully
tossed, and floting in the dangerous sea of dissention,
betwixt peace and warre, with one that
will make a peace with you, for no other end and
purpose, but that hee may bee the better able
to make warre heereafter against you. But to
cast out the last anchor hold of my selfe, which is
boldnesse and frcenesse of speech to you (my most
renoumed Soveraigne) to prevent if I can these
extreame and certaine dangers, wherein both your
Selfe, your States, and glory of the English and
Scottish names, are likely to be plunged, when
the Spaniards ability shall be such, as there shall
bee no let, but his good nature, to insult over
you: which howsoever your Highnesse, or others,
thinke contrary, will in foure or fiue yeares,
if he enjoy his Indies be brought to passe. Surely,
my gracious Soveraign, I am of opinion against Phillip
of Spaine, in the behalfe of my Countrie,

as that noble Common-wealths man Demosthenes,
against Philip of Macedon in behalfe of the Athenians;
which no doubt hath much affinity with our case at
this time. For Phillip seeing whilst he had warre with
Athens (at which he principally aimed) hee could
never overcome the other Provinces of Thebeans,
Lacedemonians, Thessalians, Ihocians, Ointans, and the
rest, and till they were overcome he could never
get Athens, began to take another course: which was,
to bribe with mony and gifts, Councellours or Orators
of that State to be of his side; and by that means
to be secure from the forces of that Republique or
Common-wealth, till he had, by one and one, overcome
the rest. But good Demosthenes perceived him
by and by, and warned the Thebeans of that Treason;
but these traitors of Philips faction being grown great
in the Citie, by meanes of the bounty they had daily
received for rewards of their treason; as also the
Athenians were then, as we are now, not willing to
heare of any warres or change to be brought against
them; which alwayes these Traitors joyne with the
multitude, in assuring them that Phillip of Macedon
meant them no harm, was the onely cause that all the
other Provinces aforenamed were overcome; but also
the noble and stately Citie by him and Antepator
his successour. And therfore since that like examples,
whilst the world doth last, will bring forth like
effects, I will be of Demosthenes minde; if since we
cannot shunne the warres with Spain, either at this
time, or hereafter, when he hath made himselfe more
strong; either by the conquest of his neighbours, or
other wise: that you should begin with him whilst

you haue the advantage of him; and then you shall
by proofe finde how profitable it will be unto you;
when you must needs doe a thing, to doe it with a
courage and cheerfulnesse, and forasmuch as there is
no man of another minde, but that we shall haue the
King of Spaine, by so much more our mighty enemy,
the greater Princes suffer him to be. Oh why be
we so backward, or why linger you oh noble King,
the great Commander of the braue spirits of the
English and Scottish Nation, to doe that in reason
and necessity you ought? Our fathers, when they
were Masters but of one part of the Ile, were never
wont to feare any thing in matters of war, but if the
skie should fall upon them, sailed over many a Sea
to make their weapons glister in the bowels of other
Kingdomes; being by the honesty of their actions,
and noblenesse of their courage assured. And shall
your Majesty, by whose blessed arrival to this part of
your Ancestors, & having brought home once again
in your ship of Vnion, our brethren and kinsmen, no
lesse valiant then our selues, being desended from
the bloud of our Ancestours, and turned from us by
the iniquity of time, and dissentions of some mutinous
persons of either part; which we must not account
proceeded by consent of both people; neither
measure the intents of great nations according to the
notable wickednesse of some particulars? Shall you I
say, who hath renewed again the ancient same of this
Ile (by which, for Valour, for Men, for Munitions,
for Engines, for Warre, no Prince under heaven can
lightly compare) be doubtfull to undertake a warre
to which you are so necessarily incited; as well for

the glory of God, the aduancement of Christian
Religion in all parts; as also your particular safety,
which can never be certaine to You, nor us your posterity,
but by the abatement of the Spanish greatnesse,
by meanes whereof many murders, massacres,
and rebellions haue been made in Europe. No no
(my renoumed Soveraigne) be it far from your magnanimous
mind, to harbour a thought so unworthy
that vertue, that shineth so apparant in all mens eyes;
but rather since the nature of the Countries, the inclination
of the Subjects, and the valours of the people,
doe seeke to overcome the violence of the enemies;
let them be seconed by the Kingly command,
under which word, there is no question of victorie.
Your Predecessours of famous memory, undertook
these warres upon discreet, and premeditated considerations;
not onely chewed for many yeares together,
but likewise digested by the experience of time,
Conclusions of the Spaniards part of divers things
against this State, & probability of many more dangers
like to ensue, both against the people and country:
And therefore (most renoumed Soveraign) if
the addition you adde in your owne Greatnesse and
Person, to this your right inheritance of England, be
not sufficient to alter the consideration of your former
policies, in my minde; you ought to be well
advised, before you stray from the pathes of your Predecessours,
who built their only safety upon the preservation
of the Netherlands, and abatement of the
Spaniards Greatnesse, as by diuers excellent reasons,
wherupon they undertook openly these warres, may
appear. But perhaps it may be said, that the person of

the Prince doth alter the pretence of the enemy I
hope I shall neede to say little on that point, to so
highly wise, learned and juditious a Lord, as your
Highnesse; especially when it is apparant to your Majestie,
that the Spaniards build their certain Greatnesse
upon no one thing so much, as the ruin and destruction
of this land, as by their foregoing projects appeareth.
But moreover, if they could not loue the Princes
of their bloud, race, and kindred; as the King of
Naples, Cicily and Navarre, whom they not onely deposed
from their Kingdomes, but likewise some of
them from their liues, under no pretence of reason
or justice, but onely thirsting after bloud and Seigniories,
I shall infinitely mistrust his regard of the safety
of your noble and fotunate Issue. And if your Majesty
will goe by precedent (which is most fit to most
actions that doe minister themselues to men) and but
examine how the Monarchy of Spaine hath but raised
himselfe to his Greatnes, you shall no doubt perceiue
(by comparing time past, with that which is like
to follow) the irrecoverable dangers you are like to
fall into, by making peace with them, that for advantage
will hold it Religion to breake with you. And
for that, from Ferdinand of Aragons time they haue
begun to render themselues so fearfull to their neighbours,
which as it were yesterday, your Highnes may
acquaint your self with their unjustactions, which are
fresh in memory to their unchristianlike wounds, given
to many Christian Princes, still bleeding; whereby
you may the better discerne and distinguish them.
For as Ferdinand himselfe, which was the roote from
whence their Princes sprang, ther was no King in his

time more unjust, more cruell, or more bloudy,
thirsting after bloud, and breach of faith with all
Princes, with whom hee had to doe; although
they were his Cousen-germaines, his brother in
law, his Sisters and Neece; and indeed laid his
foundation of the Spanish Monarchy upon such base
and treacherous foundations: For Charles the
fifth, how hee behaved himselfe in his time
amongst the Princes of Christendome, I cannot
more aptly referre your Majestie to a briefe relation
thereof, then by an Oration made by a
worthy Gentleman, who had particularly acquainted
himselfe with the accidents of that time,
which hee wrote, and dedicated to the two young
Earles of Embden long since. For Phillip the second,
what bloud hath hee caused to be shed both in
England, Portugal, France, the Netherlands and Ireland,
is it not knowne to all Christian Princes?
Besides, the often seeking of the innocent
bloud, of that most noble, and thrice renoumed
Predecessour of famous memory Elizabeth,
Queene of this land, which if, so it were, there were
no other witnesse of his Goatish and Moorish inclination
(as there are thousands) were it not
enough to enroule and memorize him in the
ranke of unworthie and tyrannous Potentates?
For Phillip the third, although hee be young,
yet is hee a Spaniard: and whatsoever the wisest
of the world haue ever thought of the nature and
qualltie of a Spaniard, is apparant: For Francis
Guicciardine (a man so sufficient, as the very reckoning
of his very worth and perfections would

require a story) saith of them The Spanish
Nation are covetous and deceitfull, and where
they bee at libertie, exceeding outragious, tyrannous,
and very proud and insolent. And Andrew
.. a famous Senatour of Venice, saith
of them; That they are unfaithfull, ravenous,
and the most unsatiable of all Nations: For
where is it (saith hee) of all the parts of the
world, where these infamous Harpies set their
feete, which is not defiled with the foot-steps
of most abominable vices; and yet the shot of
their Pistols doe so dazell the eyes of many in
this land, that they are not ashamed to defend
them to be the most noble, most faithfull, and most
honourable Nation in the world. Another writes
of them; That they are loathsome Swine, theevish
Owles, and bragging Peacocks: For (saith
he) whosoever would behold the liuely protrature
of them, without troubling himselfe with
the overturning of Martial or Terence, let him but
behold the grim speech of a stately Spaniard.
                   By
whom, most mightie Prince, I may well say, and
according to truth, that the world of America
was not so much unknowne to the former ages, as
their monstrous outragious, and new devised cruelties,
which these divelish and tyrannous Spaniards
haue unhumanely practised amongst the simple and
innocent people, as appeareth by Don Bartholmew de
la Casas Bishop of ... and other of their own
Historiographers. And although my selfe, being
a stranger, which haue some time served against
them, both in the Indies and else where, could say

much of their cruelties, by relation of such their
slaues as I haue taken, yet for that my eyes haue not
seene them, I will forbare in modesty to charge them;
onely I will relate, from the mouth of a true reporter,
a worthy Gentleman of this Land, Sir Francis
Drake, one truth; that by that, your Majestie might be
induced to beleeue the rest. He once talking with me
of the Indies, told me, That he being in the South
Sea, after he had taken his prize, he had thought to
haue ventured to haue come home by the Northward,
and stood his course to the Ile of Canes, being
12. degrees of the North latitude, and from
thence to Aqua Palce, upon the maine, being 16 degrees,
at one of the Poort townes of the Citie of
Mixico; where going a shore, he found an old Negro,
tyed in a chaine of 20 yards long, which had
been condemned by the justice of the place; for that
sometimes being oppressed with too much labour,
the poor old man would runne into the woods, and
absent himselfe from his Majesties worke; his sentence
was, that he should be whipped, with whips,
til he was all raw and bloudy; and afterwards being
tyed in a chaine to be eaten with flies; which poore
soule hee released from that miserable death, and
took him away with him: And therefore oh Turke,
oh Scithians, and Tartarians, rejoyce yee now all,
since now, there is to be found at this day a Nation
in Christendome, which by the unhappy and cursed
behaviour, doe increase the hatred that men
haue borne to the barbarous and ungracious cruelties.
And therefore, most renowned Soveraigne,
I should be sory, in regard of the premises, that you

should commit so great a fault in the government of
the great & mighty Kingdomes, which is not sufferable
to a private Captaine over a few souldiers, to say,
I doe not thinke it: so when hee hath by his owne temerity,
or fool-hardinesse, committed an action for
want of due respect, to the subjects, undertaken that
hath made him disastrous, and unfortunate in his honour,
and the times of his people, (which desire
rather to giue them received Lawes ... For
the desire of honour to aduance States, and enlarge
Kingdomes, is naturally grafted in the hearts of all
Princes of noble spirits; and there was never any
King, of a worthy and high courage, but desired to
leaue to his-posterity the memorie of some noble and
worthy action (as the Armerican world) by doing
whereof, you shall not onely procure safety to your
selfe, and those that shall succeed you in your Royall
Seate, but generall happinesse to so many millions of
people, which at this day sit in darknesse and the shadow
of death; and is a thing so farre from discommendation
or reproach▪ as you shall be so qualified in
all succeeding ages, with the most happy, most gracious,
and most fortunate Princes of the world. But
yet I doe not deny, but Princes may haue such
grounds and reasons to trust some priuate men, or forraigne
Princes, as being deceived by them, and they
should say, I never would haue thought it, yet are not
worthy of reprehention: as for example; That
Prince ought not to bee blamed, that hath put in a
Fortresse some one Captaine; or place, in a Countrey
som one Prince, either of which haue received goods
or honours from him, and yet in the end is betrayed

by them, and heereupon the knowledge thereof
should say, I would never haue thought it, that such
a man should haue betraied me, that Prince is not to
be blamed; as it happened to Lewis Morre Duke of
Millaine, who having committed the Castle of the
Citie to one Damerdine Covet, whom he had so absolutely
raised, and made obliged to him by infinite
graces and benefits; yet notwithstanding was by
the said Covet betrayed to his perpetuall dishonour
and infamie. This Duke was no way to bee blamed.
As also your Majestie ought not to be reproved, who
providing for every mischiefe, is assailed by some
strange accidents, that was not possible for your
Majestie, in judgement or councell to foresee, or
prevent: as being not possible with reason to foresee
a thing, which of it selfe is a thing without reason.
As for example, was that most grievous accident
of the powder, and other munition, prepared
to be sent to diverse places before the Castle gate of
the said Citie, which tooke fire, and was burnt by
lightning from heaven when the weather was faire
and cleere, whereby afterwards ensued to the State so
many losses and discommodities: upon this occasion,
if the Captaine of the Castle should haue
said, I had never thought that this weather would
haue brought so great and unfortunate a chance to me,
hee had deserved no reproofe at all. But if before
your Majesties eyes, it be apparant, that a
manifest knowne enemy to the State, who as Demosthenes
said, hates the verie Religion of Athens,
who hath not onely long thirsted after the
Seigniorie of your Kingdome, in his secret designes,

but likewise by open force of fire and
sword hath assailed them; If you will trust such
an one, and after upon his breaking say, You
would not haue beleeved that the King of Spaine
would haue dealt so with you: Doubtlesse (renoumed
Soveraigne) the world will not faile to taxe
you with such carelessnesse and improvidence,
as I hope shall never haue any affinity with your most
Excellent Majestie, or any other of your Royall
Off-spring that shall sway the Scepter of this noble
Ile. And therefore (my gracious Lord) in my
judgement, you ought to doe in this, so great a
matter of State, as concluding a peace with so
dangerous enemies as the Spanish Nation, as
good and wise Carpenters seeme to doe in substantiall
buildings; which is, to make a sure foundation,
lest by aspiring minde or breach of the enemie
you be overthrowne. And whereas he saith in
the foregoing project, that hee hath right and
good title to the Crowne of England, by vertue of
his Grandfather and Predecessours (which I know
to be otherwise) yet contrarily can I proue your Majestie,
by the vertue of your Grandfather of famous
memory Henry the 7, to bee as rightfull
Heire to all the firme land of the Indies, as the King
of Spaine is to the Ilands of Cuba, Iannura and Hispaniola,
with the rest of the Ilands of Lucaites
Grante, and Antile: and for that it is not inconvenient
fully to take notice, and understand how
these Kings intitles themselues & their Successors to
the right and Signiories of the Indies, I haue thought
good to set downe my opinion, how many wayes

they doe, or may take their claim: And first by discovery;
secondly, by the Popes gift; thirdly, by consent
of the people; fourthly, by conquest and consent. So
as if neither of these be able to proue or giue a good
and sufficient title (or at least such a one as may barre
you and other Princes that will, to inhabite in those
parts) I know no reason why your Majestie should
not doe as he hath done; that is, to possesse as much
as you can of those Heathen Countries; especially
where the Spaniard is not feared, nor hath no command:
whereby you might not onely propagate the
Christian faith amongst those Pagans and infidels, as
you are bound to doe, as much as you can; but a golden
world to the Crowne of England: wherby you be
more enabled, as well to undertake a forraigne warre
against the enemy of the Christian name; as also to
make your State the more strong by the Indian treasures,
against such of your neighbours as shall envie
your Highnesse. And therefore to come to this Title:
If he claime his interest by possession and first Discovery
(which doubtlesse must be the strongest title that
he can challenge) then your Majestie hath as much
title for all the firme land of the Indies, as he hath for
these Ilands before named. As for proofe of this, the
Captaines of Henry the 7, being Sebastian Cabot, and
his companions, discovered the Iland of the Indies, on
the north part of the Indies, from 60 degrees, coasting
the north latitude; the very yeare before Christian Columbus
discovered the high land of Dania, on the south
part of the Indies; which was the first day that ever
the Spaniards saw the maine, and tooke possession
of that new Discovery in the behalfe of Henry
                  
the 7, and his successours their Lord and Master. So
as if first Discovery and Possession be his Title, your
Majestie preceding him in that said Title, must necessarily
precede him in the right thereof. If he claime
it by the gift of Pope Alexander the sixth, then it
must be argued whether the said Pope had power to
giue it, yea, or no; if not, then the gift is voide in it
selfe: if yea, he must proue it either by Divine or
Humane Argument; for Humane he cannot, for that
no way belonged to him, or any other Christian
Prince or Potentate, at that time; nor were so much
as ever heard of, before that present Discovery of
Columbus, upon which the gift was made in the yeare
of grace 1492. All things never knowne to him, or
his Ancestors, can no way of right belong to him or
them; so as not belonging to him, directly or by circumstance,
hee had no right to giue or dispose thereof,
either in present or future; and thus for Humane.
For Divine Arguments; if he say he gaue them as
Christs Vicar, whereby he may dispose of Kings or
Kingdoms, he must proue that authority by the word
of God, or else we are not bound to beleeue him, or
thinke his gift of any value. As for example, if hee
be but Christs seruant here on earth, hee must challenge
to himselfe no more prerogatiue then his Master
tooke on him whilst he was on earth; for if hee
doe, it is a great token of pride and arrogancie. And
our Saviour being but requested to make a lawfull division
of a certaine inheritance betwixt one and his
brother, refused to doe it; saying, Who made me a
Iudge over you? as also he confessed openly to Pilate,
That his Kingdome is not of this world. Why then doth

the Pope, who acknowledgeth himselfe to be no better
then his servant, take upon him the giuing of so
many Kingdomes of this world. But the Pope, say
they, gaue Ireland to Henry the 2, and his successours:
and indeed they did so in word; but when had he it?
when he had fast footing in it, and when Dernitius the
King of Lemster had made the King of England his
Heire. But for all that donation, had not the Kings of
this land, but the sharpnesse of the sword more prevailed,
then by this gift, the Popes donatiō had stood
in little stead; neither did the rest of the Irish Kings
admit or allow of the Popes Donation; for if they
had, they would never haue rebelled so often against
this Crowne. But to conclude this point; though we
confesse, that the Popes haue done this or that, yet it
is no good argument, in my opinion, to say that they
did it, and therefore it was lawfull, unlesse they could
shew they did it rightfully. But the Popes gift of the
West Indies, may well be compared to the Sermon of
Iudge Molineux his Chaplin in Queen Maries dayes,
who would make it appeare, by a linely text out of the
Scripture to his Parishioners, what a lying knaue the
divell was: and for his Text, he tooke the place where
the divell tooke Christ and carried him up to the
mountaine, from whenc he shewed him all the Kingdoms
of the world; & told him, if he would fal downe
and worship him, he would giue them all unto him.
My Masters (quoth he) by this you may well perceiue
what a lyer he is; for he had no more right to
haue given him these Kingdomes (if he would haue
fallen down and worshipt him,) then my selfe, that
am now in the Pulpit. If I should say to you all

now; Sirs, if you will all fall downe and worship
me, before I goe out of the Church, I will giue every
man his Copie-hold for ever; which if I should
doe, I should giue you your livings in words: But
my Masters (quoth he) that sit there below to
whom they belong, would take them from you
againe: and therefore (saith he) if he had given all
these Kingdomes to Christ, the Kings of the earth,
to whom by right they did pertaine, would never
haue suffered him to haue injoyed them. And so for
that,—For the earth is the Lords, and all that dwell therin,
he founded and prepared it, as in the Psalmist: and so
consequently, neither the Popes, nor the diuils, doe
dispose to whom they please. The copie of which
foolish donation of the Popes, truely translated out
of the originall, hath beene delivered to your Majestie
long since, and (I hope) perused before this
time. To proue that he hath no generall consent of
all the people and Nations of the Indies, appeareth
most evidently, by this reason; for that no Spaniard
farther inhabiteth northward then Florida, where
they haue but two little Forts or Villages, the one
called S. Austine, the other S. Helena: All the rest
of that hugh tract, whose infinitenesse is such, (as no
mortall tongue can expresse, nor eye hath seene,) doe
not so much as think there is another world but that
they themselues inhabite, except some few of them
which dwell vpon the edges of the shore, that sometimes
see both us, the French, the Dutch, and the Spaniard,
when we come a fishing, but are not able to
distinguish of us, but thinke us all one people: then
how can we imagine, that these people haue freely

given themselues to the Spanish obedience, and acknowledge
him for their Lord and King, when they
never so much as heard that there was such a man or
Nation. Againe, from Capi culli formia, all the
land that tunneth-and maketh the strange of Anian,
and the Netherlands thereof, whose bounds and limits
are never discovered; the Spanyard hath not so
much as once seated himselfe to make himselfe
knowne, whereby there might bee any likelyhood
that they had acknowledged him for their Soveraigne.
And for us to beleeue that the Spaniard is
Lord of such, whom he hath never seen nor knowen,
nor they him, were a manifest signe of a strong faith
in us. And there were no way for any man to make
me beleeue Miracles sooner, then by making me beleeue
this: for after the beliefe of this, I should never
doubt of any miracle, though he should tell me a
thousand in a day: So that if this title come not by
consent of all in generall, he neither ought to write
himselfe Lord of the whole Indies, nor debar other
Christians from conquering or trading in those parts
where the Spanyard hath neither residence nor Seigniory,
nor command. If he challenge right by conquest
and consent then must he claime no more, then
he hath by conquest and consent obtained. As for
example, all that part of the West Indies, which at
this day is scatteringly inhabited by the Spanyards &
Portugals, is almost contained in two Tropicks, excepting
the two small Villages of Saint Augustine
and Helena in Florida, the Prouince of new Biscay
Northwards, and fiue Villages or Townes neere the
River of Plate, called Sancto Sprinto, Saint Anna, the

Citie of Ascension, Saint Fee and Fuvirnan, lyeth halfe
way betwixt the mouth of the river of Plate, and the
Mine of Polossie; and in the South Sea beyond the
Tropick, in the Kingdome of Chelix, the Townes
or Villages of Coquenbo Persco, Saint Iago la impe villae
del Lago. And therefore, if the Spaniards haue nothing
to do, any further; either on the Northward
or to the Southward; what reason hath he to forbid
any Nation to conquer or dwell there? But if hee
should admit you, I thinke it not convenient that
your Majestie should be so satisfied, for so should
you doe your selfe, and other Christian Princes, great
wrong: for his Townes and Castles are so divided,
and such masses of land and Kingdom betwixt them,
which he hath no right, nor dare to enter as being
duely considered by your Majestie, hee ought not
to claime no more, then he ought to claime the Kingdome
of France, because his Fort of Graueling is of
oneside, and South Arabia on the other, France being
in the midst betweene them; or to claime France,
because his Frontiers in Italy bound it on the one side,
and Spaine on the other: or to claime the Iland of
the Venetians and the Turks in Levant; for that Cicilia
and Sardinia, and a few others belong to him, that
stands in that Sea: Or claime all the Ilands or Shoares
in Barbaric, for that he hath a Castle or two in the
Straits, and another in Libia. These Countries they
never lay claime to, because they are in the eye of the
Christian world; which would make us rise up in
Armes against them for their foolish arrogancy, if
they should pretend it: But in the unknowne parts,
which haue been familiar unto us; whose light by the

iniquity of the time, and troublesome warres in
these parts, haue to us beene hidden; although to
the Ancient well knowne, where they began their
foolerie. Betwixt the Castle of Argiue in Libia, and
the Iland of Macoa in the river of Canton, in the Kingdome
of China, the foolish Portugals say all is theirs,
when many a hundred Kings (as absolute and powerfull
in regard of people, as any King in these parts)
dwelleth betwixt, and admit the Portugals by way of
petition or bribes, to dwell in some place by the Sea
side, and trafique with them; neither dare they lay
claime to any Kingdome, but onely to such Fortresses,
Factories and Villages, on the Sea side, as
perforce and favour of the Iland they are admitted to
dwell in, as most excellently appeareth by answere
of Charles the fifth, made unto the Embassadours of
Portugal, anno 1522, when they came to require and
beseech him, that his subjects the Spaniards, might
not trade nor commerce, as thon they did, in the
conquest or navigation of the Portugals; who after a
most peremptory and noble answer of his part, told
them he knew no reason, neither would he suffer
them, that his subjects should be prohibited freely,
to passe into any country where the hope of gain
offereth it selfe; and that if the Portugals in the
cause of their Trade, should doe any violence to
any of his people, either in their persons or goods,
he would be revenged neerer home, meaning upon
the Kingdome of Portugal.
                   With which answer, at
that time, the Lucitans were forced to depart. Which
answer, if it should please your Majestie to returne
upon the Castilians themselues, at this time, I know no

reason how it can any way be bettered, having so
good a president, as their owne King against the Portugals,
upon the same subiect. But for the Portugals,
where all their strength is seated, I meane upon
the coast of Malubor, where they haue more Forts
and Castles then in all India besides; the Kings
doe so pen and locke them vp in their Garrisons and
Forts, as they can haue nothing the Countrie yeeldeth,
but by their friendship procured by yearly bribe;
As for example, to the King of Cathaie, they pay an
yearly tribute of 256000 Reis; to the King of Pimenta
—Reis; to the mother of the King of Pimenta
yearly 36000 Reis; to the King of Pargnan
yearly 72000; to the King of Manfata yearly 72000
Reis; to Carto Babua, the proper name of a man of
account upon the coast, an yearely tribute of 42000
Reis; to the Teratates, which are brethren and Kings,
an yearly tribute of 72000 Reis. All which summes
or tribute, are imposed upon the King, and Custome
of goods, brought from these parts. As for their
credit and reputation amongst these Heathens, it is
so small, either for feare they haue of them, or loue
they beare to them, that, when wee, and the Hollanders
pay no Custome for goods bought and solde
there, they make the Portugals pay 30 per hundred,
we going free before their faces, and they paying before
ours.
               By this, your Majestie may well perceiue, what
base account the Princes in those parts make of them
there; and yet these vainglorious woodcocks, will
be very angry with us, if we will not beleeue, when
they say, that all the East Indies is theirs, and they

haue conquered it. In selfe manner (most renowned
Soveraigne) stand the Kings of the West Indies
with the Spaniards, both in the South sea, upon the
Kingdome of Cheley, Reta, Peru, and others; as at
this time is apparant by the Kings of Cheley, who
hath within this few yeares beaten down the Spaniard
and wonne from them the Towne of Imperial, wherein
was wont to be placed and maintained one of the
greatest Garrisons of the South Sea; and not onely
razed it to the ground, but likewise kild and driven
the Castilians quite from them. Even so, upon the
East and North part of the Indies, both upon the
Coast of Brazil, with all the firm land upon the Indies
from Parabia▪
                   to Cartagene, the gulfe of Vraba, the
gulfe of Mixico, and all alongst the Coast of Bahana,
even to their Forts in Florida, they are in continuall
warres with the Kings and peoples of those lands.
And surely under your Highnesse pardon, I am confident
of this opinion, that it hath been a maine policie
of the Kings of Spaine, for these many yeares, to
keep us in continual warres one with another in these
parts; or if not, to encourage us himselfe; whereby
being forced to looke to our home defences, wee
might not haue meanes to discover these his invasions
abroad, whereby he puts a maske before all the
Princes eyes of Europe. And therefore since hee is
now layd open, and by no Nation so much as by
your Majesties subjects of this land; I hope, for the
prevention of future mischiefe against this State, as
for other honourable respects, and prevailent Reasons,
in challenging of that which is your owne;
or at least as much yours as his; you will not bee unmindfull;

which doubtlesse will not tend onely to
the enlightning of many soules, which to this day
haue sate in the shadow of death, but likewise lay
a ground (as before said) for the safety and preservation
of your States, Glorie, Person and Posterity, in
despite of the Spanish treacheries in the time to
come, which otherwise by no meanes, by the wit
of mortall man can be prevented, as upon my life,
by circumstances I will make apparant.
               But least this field of reasoning, whereinto I haue
walked, be too tedious unto your Highnesse, I will
briefly end; referring my selfe to Argument with
any one, against this mischievous and poysonous
peace with Spaine, which I doe see, cannot but proue
very fatall to your Majestie and Common-wealth.
And though I be not called, yet considering I am
your subject, I cannot forbeare, in respect of my
great and loyall affection to your Majestie, the Prince,
with the rest of the noble Issue, and my natiue Countrey,
I cannot but presume to speake of such things,
which I thinke now fit to be considered; especially at
this time: even as Mercarie Gataner, Chancellour of
Spaine, did against the peace that was concluded betwixt
Francis the first, and Charles the Emperour his
Master; for he seeing that the Emperour was disposed
to make peace with the said King, and to set
him at libertie, and that the Viceroy of Naples, and all
other the Lords of the Councell tended to the same;
and although he knew, as I do now, that his councell
would not be accepted, yet failed he not to speake
what he thought, but likewise refused, being great
Lord Chancellour of Spaine, to signe the Articles,

which hee defended with most excellent reasons,
which reasons are well delivered, and with much
gravity of speech by Quiccardine in the oration of the
said Grataner. But this event made it knowne, that the
councell of Gataner was most noble, most just, and
grounded as well upon the high wisedome, as great
zeale to the loue and good of his Countrey. For as
soon as the King was at liberty, all the Spaniards wonderfull
hopes that they expected to this peace, and all
the French Kings great promises to them vanished
into smoake, according to the opinion of that worthy
Gentleman. And I know no reason (most noble
Soveraigne) that I being your subject, as hee was
the King of Spaines, and loving you and my Country,
as much as ever hee did his; and having a subject of
the same quality, to feare, as he did them; although I
may well say, as much more danger to us by the Spaniards,
if our peace be not built upon a sure foundation,
then it could any way be unto them by the
French. But to speake my opinion, make what Articles
you will, and let them be guilded over with
the fairest shew, either they, or those of their Faction
(if you haue any about you) can devise; unlesse
these foure be granted on their part to you,
you can never make any sure peace with them; or at
least such a peace, as if he haue the minde to breake,
hee will haue the advantage of you. And Phillip
Comines saith, That for the many conclusions that
hee hath seene in his time in the affaires of State,
that it were inexcusable folly for a Prince, if hee
were able for to prevent it, to put himselfe under
the power of another. 1 That your subjects may

haue free accesse to the Indies, either to traffique or
plant, where the Spaniards haue neither conquest,
Seigniorie, nor tribute. 2. That he doe pull downe
all inquisition wheresoever your people shall resort
in all his Dominions, and that the Customes be reduced
to an ancient order. 3. That he shall never
come with a main Army of Ships into these Seas, under
colour of chasticing the Hollanders. 4. That it
shall be as lawfull for your subjects to serue the
States in warres against them, as it shall be to serue
them against the States; these things accorded, your
peace may be safe, otherwise not.
            
            
               A short view taken of Great Britaine,
and Spaine.
               HIs Majestie now is of more power then any his
Predecessours; First, because our addition of
Dominion Ireland, is reduced to a more absolute
state of obedience, and increase of reuinue then
heretofore. The footing we had in France, was
rather a greatnesse of trouble to us, then of strength;
it was alwayes in division; it held us alwayes in continuall
fluxe of treasure and bloud, we never attempted
in the Front, but that attempted us in the Rear;
which did both distract our Armies, and aggravate
our charge: It is a Territory so separate from us by
nature, as we could not aduantage upon it, either
for offences or reliefe, without the accesse of difficulty
and charge that a State must undergoe, when
it runnes the necessity of such an undertaking by
sea, where the warre was bent upon a great Continent,

a populous Nation, a plentifull Countrey,
and intire in its selfe, and that can be succoured
without passing the Seas: In these things we found
such disadvantage, as haue beene the undoing of our
Expeditions in steed of departure of this broken
Dominion we had in France, his Majestie hath
brought another whole Kingdome to England, undevided
from us in feare; from whence we haue
these benefits. The backe dore that was open in the
assistance of our enemies, both to offend us, and
divert our attemps from them, is now open to us,
and his Majestie hath the key of it, it saveth us the
money and the men that we were forced to employ
in a second Army for the withstanding the invasion
on that side: and not saues it us onely, but renders
it, to bestow in undertakings of profit, which we
were wont to spend upon defences. We haue another
valiant Nation to assist us, whose service in Low
Countrie warres hath often, and alwaies, given this
testimony of their affection and faithfulnesse, even
in Queene Elizabeths time; that in every Nationall
quarrell betweene us and others (which hath often
happened, and very remarkeable betwixt us and
the French) they haue voluntarily and brauely sided
with us, making the danger common both to themselues
and us; which was drawn out but particularly
against the English. The joyning of Scotland hath
made us an intire Iland, which by nature is the best
fortification, and the most capable of all advantages
of strength, that by Art can be added unto nature;
whereby we may at one & the same time be able both
to undertake any action abroad, & defend our selues

at home, without either much danger, or great cost.
Secondly, by reason his Majestie hath the neighbourhood
of the powerfull nation by sea, that now is in
the world, at his devotion: a people by nature more
worthy of credit with us then any other: the use of
whose neighbourhood our owne histories will commend
unto us, if we enquire of the ages past, even
then when they wanted that power and knowledge
in their industry, which they now haue, as well in
matters of peace as warre, the memories of those
times will tell us, that we seldome undertooke any
great thing without them; insomuch as our losse of
France, may probably be in part imputed to the
breach we suffered in their friendship & though they
were then of the same Religion with England, as
likewise now they are, yet the present condition
that we doe both of us stand in, for point of Religion,
doth place us in an estate of better assurance with
them, then the conditions of those times did; for
then considering no main National seperation, in the
Church Religion was, but a common bond unto
them, and inclined them to particular side,
where now it hath the motiue in it to make defence
with, against an opposite Church, in such a Nation,
as hath drawne both of us into one and the same
cause in quarrell, as well of policie, as of Religion:
And lastly, this Army is the best Millitary
Schoole of the world, from whence our Land-services
may be sufficiently appointed, at least with
Officers.
               Now for the hearts of our people, and the
wealth of our Kingdome (though it may be some

of his Majesties ill affected subjects could be willing
we should distrust our owne strength, when wee receiue
these two points into our consideration) yet
for the first; the occasion; whereof they haue derived
from our difference in Religion, I may say the wrath
of God hath beene evident against them, in the
confusion of their plots (One thinkes) it should
be a horrour to them, for to thinke of attempting
any farther that way; for those of them that haue
made a covenant with bloud, wee stand not either in
feare or neede of their numbers, but we may both
spare and suppresse them: And farre be it from me
to thinke, that many men of those that hold no communion
in the Church with us, should giue other Nations
the cause to say, that in England are the false
men, that take up Gods weapons against him, and
their owne weapons against themselues, in favour of
a forraign Ambition, that makes the pretence of Religion
but a port hole to lay his Artillery out at, or
his scaling ladder to assault by. Now the second
point touching the wealth of the Kingdome, if I
should call the Councell of Spaine it selfe to giue
judgement in the cause, I should neede no better sentence
to condemne their opinions, who thinke the
King of Great Brittaine poore; their Master knowes it
well enough, he shall finde it otherwise, whensoever
hee shall undertake to attempt us, or wee
them.
               Now for Spaine, his Majestie there, though accounted
the greatest Monarch of Christendome; yet
his estate being enquired throughly, his roote will
be found a great deale too narrow; for the top of

his Dominions are so farre in distance asunder, as
they cannot giue reliefe time enough one to another
upon an alarum; which is the reason hee is more
powerfull to assault then defend, and therefore are
compelled to haue continual garrisons of that charge
he is unable to maintaine: he hath more to doe with
shipping then any other Prince, and yet hath few men
at his devotion, but by extreame charge, and those
of worst sorts; his poverty hath therefore appeared in
the mutinie of his Low Countrey Armie, for want
of pay, which was great cause of his ill successe
there; & I cannot see how his estate can be much better
now then it was. For though it be true, that his
charge is somewhat lesse; yet it is likewise true, that
his Subsidies in Spaine be also diminished, as well
in respect of his insupportablenesse; as of indispositiō
of his Revenues out of the Indies deayed: And indeed
but for his Indies, hee were the poorest Prince
in Christendome. Now it serues the better for the
finding his weaknesse or strength, to enquire whether
he be able to stand upon the termes of defiance,
and yet hold his Indies, I thinke not: for his Majestie
of Great Brittain, joyning with the States of the Vnited
Provinces, is of power to 
                     〈◊〉
                   Armadoes, the
one to blocke up Spaine, the other the Indies; the least
successe that may be hoped for out of this enterprise,
the cutting off his returne would beggar him: the
feare of this project was the thing that stopped his
Greatnesse to the Vnited Provinces, when hee departed
with his pretence of Soveraigntie to them:
and that feare is an Ague he is not yet cured of. This
is a right designe, and a great one, such a one, as I

with we had the treasure, and valiant bloud of our
Ancestors to bestow vpon; for the expence whereof
we haue nothing to shew now, but two poore Ilands
Iarsey and Garnsey. And to say the truth in that case;
if all the Ilands or Lands that belong unto the Crown
of England, were offered to his Majestie, I should not
giue my advice to receiue them, much lesse to conquer
them. Now for the disposition of the Low
Countrey men, I assure my selfe there cannot be a
thing more desired, then they to joyne with his
Majestie in any undertaking, especially in this: for
they are sorie they understood the King of Spaines
weaknesse so little in Queene Elizabeths time, when
her Majestie so much affected their joyning with her,
and that now they know it, his Majestie being greater
in power, will yet suffer such an enemy to all
Christian Princes, chiefly to those of his Majesties
Religion, to creep into his bosome: For all the greatnesse
he hath, he holds by the curtesie of his Majestie,
(and to that end Courts it;) he knowes he were undone
else. To conclude, I will referre some of the
Reasons, that perswade to the undertaking of his designe;
the policie of Spaine hath troden more bloudy
steps then any State of Christendom; looke into his
Treaties, and his Negotiations of his Ministers
abroad, you shall finde as much falshood in them, as
bloud in the other: He never paid debt so truely, as
those he imposed in corrupting of the Ministers of
other Princes: He holds league with none, but to haue
neerer accesse to doe him harme; a Match in kindred
shall not hinder it whē he apprehends his advantage:
He disturbes all Christendome with his Alarums and

Armadoes yearly; and yet doth lesse hurt to Insidels
end Pirats then any, unlesse it be to get wherewithall
to arme himselfe the better against other Christian
Princes; and he hath an ambition to the whole Empire
of Christendome. These are motiues wherein
all Christian Princes are interessed, so as with reason
they cannot oppose the designe, nor will (I thinke
the most of them) hee hath brought himselfe into
such an hatred with them. Let us, betweene his Maiesty
and the Vnited Provinces, consider how the particular
causes of both Nations doe importunate us
both to the undertaking thereof. Who hath been so
thirsty of our bloud as Spaine? And who hath spilled
so much as he? Who hath been so long our enemy?
And who hath corrupted so many of our Nation as
Spaine? And that all with the help of gold, which by
reason of the neglect of this Designe he doth still enjoy,
tempting our weak ones, and our false ones withall.
Would you finde a Traitor on a suddain? Balaams
Asse will tell you where, at the Spanish Embassadours
doore? And when? when they come from Masse, and
otherwise. When to? when they Match with us. For
his malice is so great, he cannot hide; nor will God (I
hope) suffer it. Yet let us examine in reason: now if
we be so charitable as to forget what is past, whether
we may promise our selues assurance of his amity for
the time to come or not? Because peace with a true
neighbour is a condition to be embraced, nothing
more certain then the contrary. We cannotpromise it
his ambition to the Empire, so long as he holds the Indies,
shal never die. The Vnited Provinces is an Object,
which though he hath an eye to, yet hee likes not.

What other thing soever we communicate with him
in, we shall never be assured of him (such is the nature
of the Religion,) so long as we differ in matter of faith,
he knowes very well the perill he stands in, if hee
be attempted by his Majestie and the Vnited Provinces.
Consider what suggestions these are to keep him
thinking upon; and imagin then, what his owne part
will prompt him to doe vvhen he sees a time for
it. He then to the end hurts, that he may not be
prevented by the Enterprise. Now of the fitnesse and
honour of it, to be in that undertaking of his Majestie,
who is the greatest Ilander in Christendome, and
therefore a Navie most proper to him: He is a Defender
of the Faith, as well in understanding, learning
and godlinesse, as in title; therefore in the planting of
the true Church, their is a sacred worke, that even by
office, as it were, belongs unto him: He is of a great
liberall minde, the Indies will affoord him meanes to
exercise it. These Considerations, and the great multitude
of his subjects, doe seeme to invite him: and
in every part, consideraby in the Designe, we may
finde something to perswade us, that it seems to be a
kind of offer, both in Religion, Policy and
Nature, preferred unto his Majestie; as
the Prince for maintaining
of it.
               FINIS.
