               That the Rebelles in England can not preuayle,
            
            To the tune of Rowe well ye Mariners.
            
               
            
            
               ALl you that newes would here,
               Geue eare to me poore Fabyn Flye,
               At Rome I was this yere,
               And in the Pope his noſe dyd lye,
               But there I could not long abide,
               He blew me out of euery ſide:
               For furſt when he had harde the newes,
               That Rebelles dyd their Prince miſuſe,
               Then he with ioye,
               Did ſporte him ſelfe with many a toye,
               he then ſo ſtout,
               From that his noſe he blew me out.
            
            
               ¶But as he was a ſlepe,
               Into the ſame againe I goot:
               I crept there in ſo depe,
               That I had almoſt burnt my coote,
               New newes to him was brought that night.
               The Rebelles they weare put to flight,
               But Lord how then the Pope toke one,
               And called for a Mary bone,
               vp howgh make haſt:
               My louers all be like to waſte,
               tyſe Cardnall, vp prieſt,
               Saint Peter he doth what he leſt.
            
            
               ¶So then they fell to Meſſe,
               The Fryers one their Beades dyd praye,
               The Pope began to bleſſe,
               At laſt he weiſt not what to ſaye.
               It chanced ſo the next day morne,
               A Poſt came blowing of his Horne,
               Saying Northomberland is take,
               But then the Pope began to quake.
               he then rubd noſe,
               With Pilgrome ſalue be noynt his hoſe,
               runne here, runne there,
               His nayles for anger gan to pare.
            
            
               ☞Not Northomberland alone,
               But many of his wicked ayd:
               Such as thought not to grone,
               They hoped well for to aplayd,
               There partes to haue there hartes deſire,
               But now is quenched there flames of fire,
               The greateſt and the meane beſide,
               With other youths faſt bound muſt ride,
               Ketch faſt, kepe well,
               There youthfull bloud they long to ſell,
               truſt this dere Pope,
               what is it than wherfore ye hope.
            
            
               ¶When he perceaued well,
               The newes was true to him was brought,
               Vpon his knees he fell,
               And then S. Peter he be ſought,
               That he would ſtand his frend in this,
               To helpe to ayd thoſe ſeruauntes his,
               And he would do as much for him,
               But Peter ſent him to Saint Simme.
            
            
               So then he ſnuft,
               the Fryers all about he cuft,
               He roard he cryde,
               the preiſts they durſt not once abide.
            
            
               ❀The Cardnalles they beginnes,
               To ſtay and take him in there arme,
               He ſpurnd them on the ſhinnes,
               Away the trudgd for feare of harme.
               So there the pope was left alone,
               Good Lord how he dyd make his mone,
               The Stooles againſt the Walles he threwe,
               And me out of his noſe he blewe.
               I hopt I ſkipt,
               From place to place about I whipt,
               he ſwore he tare,
               Till from his Crowne he pold the heare.
            
            
               ¶He courſt me ſo about,
               In the houſe I conld finde no rome,
               Loth I was to go out,
               And ſhrind my ſelfe vnder a Brome.
               Then by and by downe he was ſet,
               with anger he was one a ſwet,
               He rubd his elbowe on the Wall,
               So fell a rayling on Saint Paule.
               Fye fye bloud harte,
               He ſcratchde him ſelfe till he dyd ſmart▪
               
               poll noſe rube eye,
               Graſh the teth drawe mouth awrye.
            
            
               ¶He wept and wrong his handes,
               yea worſe and worſe began to fret:
               Thus radging ſtill he ſtandes,
               then out at doore I dyd me get,
               I was not ſoner gone from thence,
               But worſe and worſe was his pretence,
               The poſt he plucked from the houſe,
               he left no harbour for a Mouſe,
               thus now the popes mad.
               Becauſe no better lucke they had,
               forlorne moleſt,
               that they ſo yll their meate diſgeſt.
            
            
               ¶When I had vewed all,
               To bring this newes my winges I ſpred,
               to this parplict he is fall.
               I wiſh ſome would go hold his head.
               For certainely he doth yll fare,
               yet for the ſame I do not care,
               For God his power will conuince,
               And ayd with right his beloued prince.
               then Pope radge thou,
               The God in heauen hath made a vowe,
               to kepe all his,
               That God is iuſt our ſtay he is.
