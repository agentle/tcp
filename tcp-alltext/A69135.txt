                  THE DIVINE IVDGEment of God in the death of the Marquis d'Ancre.
                  OH the iuſt iudgements of God! oh profound and incomprehenſible counſell of the Almightie! oh ſoueraigne decree of the diuine prouidence! That man is vnhappilie periſhed, that ſought to ouerwhelme vs in miſerie. He that with a diſloy all heart would haue procured a tragicall end to France, hath tragically ended his daies by the hands of true-hearted Frenchmen: and hath buried himſelfe in his owne pride, that would haue buried the greatnes of Princes, and built an abſolute power in the ruines and decay of this perpetuall Monarchie. But what do I ſay, buried; O wonderfull prodigie, O prodigious wonder! That ſame man hath bin by the people

vnburied, and depriued of the ſweete repoſe of the dead, who in his life time had depriued France of a peaceable tranquillitie, hath bin ignominiouſly hung vp as a treacherous and calumniating Haman, on the ſame erected gallowes, which his owne naturall crueltie and art of wickedneſſe had ordained for ſuch good Mardocheoſes, as vndertooke to complaine of his tyrannie, or to diſcouer the many practiſes of his treaſons and diſloyaltie againſt our King. Moreouer, they hung him with his heeles vpward, as if his head ſo monſterouſly culpable, durſt not ſo much as behold the▪ heauens; was with great diſgrace and infamie ſhamefully dragged through the ſtinking puddles and dunghils of the Citie of Paris; he that long ſince had drawne vpō himſelf the cords and ſnares of the diuine iuſtice, and who had infected France with the ordure, corruption and ſtinking ſauour of his vices; hee which ſought to diſmember the body of the State, himſelfe was diſmembred and torne in peeces; was burned and conſumed in the flaming fire, who would haue burned and conſumed the libertie of the people with the fire of his violence; his aſhes were ſcattered in the

winde, to ſhew the puffe of his own ambition, which was ſo ſuddenly turned to aſhes. He beleeued that the bright skie of his authoritie was free from any cloudes, the cleere ſunne of his dominion without eclipſe, the lightſome day of his glorie voyd of darkneſſe, the vaſt ſea of his greatnes without tempeſt, the roſes of his good fortune grew without pricks, and that all the felicities of the world were perpetually to ſhine vpon him: But hee ſuddenly found his authoritie loſt, his dominion ſmothered, his glorie extinguiſhed, his greatneſſe troden down, his good fortunes changed, and felt that his former proſperities, were but a ſweete impoyſoned baite of fortune, turned into the gall and bitternes of all miſhaps.
                  Hee was put to death by the Kings command, that would haue commanded the King; hee ended his daies with violent death, that violated the reſpect due vnto his Maieſty, violated Iuſtice, violated the lawes; and hee that was indeed altogether nothing but violence it ſelfe, hauing climbed ſo high, that hee could not well be brought low, but by death it ſelfe; which Iuſtice confirmeth, the Law approueth, and equitie commandeth, Right counſelleth,

Reaſon ordaineth, Hiſtories allow, and that precedents teach; and that cannot be taken in euill part, without contradicting the approbation, authoritie, commandement, counſell, ordinance, confirmation, and teaching of the whole world; and to accuſe of iniquity, Iuſtice, law, equitie, right, reaſon, hiſtories, examples, and all that may be termed vprightnes in the whole vniuerſe. The infection of his life, therfore hath been moſt iuſtly, but yet with too much honour mingled with his bloud, in the midſt of his (as I may terme thē) Court-gallyſlaues; who did inconſideratly adore the blind Idoll of his greatnes. Whence may be learned, that vice neuer goes vnpuniſhed; although to be vicious, of it ſelfe is puniſhment ſufficient. Mounſier de Ʋitry, moſt faithfull to the King, hauing brought both his heart and hand together to the execution of ſo heroicke an act, that Hiſtories ſhall perpetually record to the memorie of men, and ſhall flow from the pen of the moſt learned within the Temple of immortalitie.
                  No, no, it was not earth, but Heauen had the greateſt ſtroke in his death; it was the hand of Angels more then men, and the ſentence of

his tragicall end was firſt pronounſt in Gods counſell, before the King decreed it. By which it may be gathered, how neere this good and wiſe Monarke is vnited vnto the eternall God in his minde and ſoule; ſeeing that the will of the moſt High, who holdeth the harts of Princes in his hand, agreeth ſo well with the Kings; and that the Protector of the whole world, hath been well pleaſed with the deſires of this great King, thereby to manifeſt his conſent vnto his wiſhes. Hee ended the courſe of his life entring into the Louure, where he thought himſelfe ſo firmely anchred, that hee was neuer to depart thence; and felt the icie ſtroke of death by piſtols and fiery weapons, who in the midſt of his froſtie cowardiſe and temeritie, was the kindler and flaming fire-brand of ſedition; who with an ardent appetite greedily longed to trouble all France with the fire of Ciuill warre.
                  And whereas the skie had bin long before (euen in the faireſt moneth in the yeere) ouerſpread with a gloomie darknes, as being inwardly touched with remorſe of our ſenſible griefes which aſcended thither; ſeemed to mourne at our ſiniſter miſhaps, and to mingle

its continual drops with the bitter teares which ouerflowed the eyes and hearts of all truehearted Frenchmen, who could not without extreame griefe vndergoe that vnreaſonable tyrannie; or as if it would ioyne its moyſture together with the bloud, which the ouerruling of this execrable Tyrant cauſed to be ſpilt, by a furious and more then Ciuill warre: euen at this inſtant begā it to re-aſſume the brightnes of its countenance, and to cheriſh the earth with its ſeaſonable mildnes, euen at the fearfull image of this mans death, neerely reſembling that Herennius who was ſtrook with lightning, the skie being without cloudes, and the ayre bright and cleere; as if by the calmenes of the weather, the calme of Peace would be repreſented vnto vs, which France is ſhortly to enioy, by meanes of this long wiſht for death; and that with his bloud he was to extinguiſh the flames of warre, which his ambition had vnhappily kindled; a warre that fought againſt the publike peace, the vnion of ſubiects, the ioy of friends, the Kings authority, the ſtrēgth of Frenchmen, and the good of France; a warre that was the motiue of many wars, and ſuch a warre whereof his Maieſtie deſired as

much to ſee an end, as of a warre that turned good things into bad, ſo a peace would haue turned bad into good.
                  Hee ended his life in the beginning of a week, as if therby the heauens did preſage vnto vs, that his end was to be the beginning of our happineſſe. Before moone, in token that we were to re-behold the Eaſterne part of the Sonne of Iuſtice, which was eclipſed by the earth of his auarice, and now began a new to peepe out vpon the Horizon of France, in the Orient of the happie raigne and Empire of our good King: whoſe admirable vertues ſhal neuer bee ſeene to ſet, and is to raigne in all prudence and abſolute authoritie; hauing rather his head on his Crowne, then his Crowne on his head, and his hand rather within his Scepter, then his Scepter in his hand: and moreouer to gouerne himſelfe by the graue aduice of his beſt and principal Officers, and ſo much the rather, for that by bad counſell, moſt commonly a great King is made a little one; and contrariwiſe by good counſell a pettie King is made a great one.
                  He is confined to the centre of death rather in the moneth of Aprill then March, in regard

that hee had no thing in him that was martiall or generous; and could better lay his hands on the Kings coffers and treaſure, then on a ſword: and to conclude, was conſtrained to giue vp the ghoſt in the midſt of the ſpring, in the flower of his age, who was altogether thornes in his heart, as if the ground were not able to beare any longer, among thoſe pleaſant flowers and faire Flower-deluces, which are diſplaied in this milde ſeaſon, this Cantharide and mortall poyſon of the Flowers of France.

                     Wherein alſo is diſcourſed the meeting of the ſaid Conchino, with Rauailac, in forme of a Dialogue.
                  
                  
                     THis very night, about twelue a clocke, as I walked in the Moone-light, there appeared vnto mee a fearfull viſion; it was a very tall man, whoſe head ſeemed to look out at the window of a Towre in which hee was incloſed, and his feet appeared beneath it: I was greatly amazed at the firſt ſight of him, hauing neuer ſeene ſo ſtrange an Apparition before: neuertheleſſe hauing ſomewhat better aduiſed my ſelfe, and conſidered this Towre,

I be thought me, Might not this bee ſome one of the Conchinies ſeruitors; for they were accuſtomed in fighting to arme themſelues with Cittadels. Thereupon I reſolued to draw neere vnto him, and tooke a long pole in my hand; which I had no ſooner done, but in a broken voice I vnderſtood theſe words, Stirre not, my friend, ſtirre not I pray thee, wilt thou twice kill me? By his voice I knew the coward, and ſaid, Behold, this luſtie Champion, who being the other day ouerthrowne, is now returnd againe, it boads him no good lucke; I came neere him and he retired, (ſo much are thoſe kind of men vſed to turne their backes), and would haue ſhooke off his vnweeldy curraſſe, that compaſſed him round about, to bee ſo much the lighter; I ranne after him, being aſſured hee was ſome poore diuell of very little courage, that would thus runne away. Then began hee to cry aloud, Downe with your weapon, downe with your weapon, I threw away my pole that ſerud me for a ſword, and being neere him I ſaid, Whoſoeuer thou be, thy humour is but baſe and cullion-like to feare death, hauing no life at all in thee: but in a trembling note he anſwered me, It is the

nature of cowards, eſpecially of rich ones, to feare blowes, and auoid quarrels: but ſaid I, let's leaue this talke, and tell mee wherefore thou commeſt hither: is it to reuenge thy maſters death?
                  
                     Ghost.
                     No, but he hath armed me as thou ſeeſt, and ſent mee to the Pariſian Gentlemen, to giue them notice, that hee hath made them Executors of his laſt Will and Teſtament.
                  
                  
                     Peaſant.
                     Wherefore then doſt thou repaire to me, and not to them?
                  
                  
                     Ghost.
                     I did alwaies feare thoſe men, who haue ſo often hardly dealt with my maſter and his ſeruants.
                  
                  
                     Peaſant.
                     But tell me, where is thy Maſter?
                  
                  
                     Ghost.
                     He is below, where he breakes, ruines, and makes hauocke of all: ſaying, hee'le come and reuenge his death, and Cerberus finds much adoe to withhold him.
                  
                  
                     Peaſant.
                     What, thy maſter then is become a very ſhrewd fellow.
                  
                  
                     Ghost.
                     Somewhat more couragious then my ſelfe, for hee is perſwaded that being once dead, he can be ſlaine no more; therfore was he not very valiant, but hee reſerued himſelfe to giue the laſt ſtroke for Soiſſons, if others

could not haue compaſſed it, and had very ſhortly beſieged it, had not the riuer preuented him. Moreouer, did hee not alwaies remaine in Normandie, expecting the enemies comming hither to ſurpriſe him? beſides, hee was ſo good a ſeruant to the King, that hee would neuer leaue his companie.
                  
                  
                     Peaſant.
                     But for my part I beleeue, heloued his Crowne better.
                  
                  
                     Ghost.
                     Hee made mee not priuie to all his ſecrets; but this I can tell you, that he hath already ſtirred vp many warres in hell; yea hee attempted to vſurpe the very ſeate of Pluto, and quarrelled a great while with Rauaillack, for precedence.
                  
                  
                     Peaſant.
                     That name is odious among the French, but there is no remedie, let vs heare the ſtorie of it.
                  
                  
                     Ghost.
                     Vpon a time being all aſſembled, to take ſome order for the ſending hither of a furie to redeeme my miſtriſſe, hee offered to take place before Rauaillack (for two perſons of one humour can neuer agree together); Rauaillack maintained that in the world hee had done Pluto better ſeruice then my maſter; that he had killed a great King, and had filled

all France with troubles: my maſter truly anſwered, that he indeed began the troubles, but if that himſelfe had not for many yeeres together carried a great hand in the buſineſſe, the peace had ſoone returned; and though he had not giuen ſuch a blow, yet his heart was good enough to doe it; for it plainly appeared that he & the King could not raign together: with other ſuch reaſonings that were by Rhadamant thus determined, that it was to bee confeſſed, that if Rauaillack were taken for the maſter, his apprentice would in the end ſurpaſſe him.
                  
                  
                     Peaſant.
                     O my God, how I feare his return being baniſhed out of hell! which if it happen, on my faith I'le ſell all I haue, and goe to hell, for I eſteeme nothing ſo great a hell, as to be ſubiect to the power of that Tyrant. Theſe things are deteſted by all good-minded French men: I pray thee let vs there leaue them, & returne we to the cauſe of thy comming: and firſt of all let vs heare a word of the eſtate and fortunes of thy Maſter.
                  
                  
                     Ghost.
                     My Maſter hath been raiſed in this world, from the loweſt, to the higheſt degree of ſtate; and in hell he argued for precedence with Pluto himſelfe.
                  
                  
                     
                     Peſant.
                     It is ſaid, that at beſt he was but a Gentleman.
                  
                  
                     Ghost.
                     Yes, if there be any in Florence vnder the great Duke, his father was Secretarie to his Excellence.
                  
                  
                     Peſant.
                     And is that nothing?
                  
                  
                     Ghost.
                     Not in regard of Marſhal of France.
                  
                  
                     Peſant.
                     And his grandfather, was hee not a mechanicall fellow?
                  
                  
                     Ghost.
                     Bee it ſo; I may ſay of him, as was ſaid of an ancient Romane: he was not made noble by his race, but his race was ennobled by him: to conclude, he that burned the Temple at Epheſus was neuer ſo famous as he.
                  
                  
                     Peſant.
                     Is his wife as well deſcended as hee?
                  
                  
                     Ghost.
                     No, ſhe at firſt was a School miſtriſſe.
                  
                  
                     Peaſant.
                     I beleeue it well, for yet ſhee very well loues to play the Miſtriſſe.
                  
                  
                     Ghost.
                     But I haue heard in hell, that her name Galliga ſignifies ſorrow to Frenchmen, for Gaya in Italian is ſorrow, and the Latine word Gallis is to Frenchmen. But to returne to our purpoſe, this is his will: Firſt and formoſt, he giues all men to vnderſtand, that in dying, God did grant vnto him that grace which he doth not to all the world, that is, not

to ſee the diuell at the houre of his death.
                  
                  
                     Peſant.
                     Truly I beleeue it: for (as I haue heard) he had not ſo much leiſure.
                  
                  
                     Ghost.
                     
                        Item, he willeth and ordaineth that all his goods be diſtributed to each one in this manner: that all and euery Caſtle and ſtrong hold which hee vſurped, vnder colour of the Kings will and pleaſure, bee reſtored to his Maieſty. Item, to his wife he giueth his beautie, becauſe he knowes ſhe ſtood in need of it▪ and for her comfort, hee hoped to ſee her ſhortly: and that to come to him her way lies by the Greaue. Item, to his ſonne hee giueth and bequeatheth the high way to Florence, to walke in, prouided alwaies, that it may bee lawfull for him ſo to doe. Item, to his brother the one halfe of his cowardize, becauſe he was too valiant; and the other halfe to the regiment of Normandie.
                     But now tell me, what hath been done here in the world ſince his death, that I may report it vnto him.
                  
                  
                     Peſant.
                     A ſtrange metamorphoſis, euery thing is changed, warres into peace; thunder, lightening, raine and haile, into faire weather: The dumbe ſpeake, and thoſe that did ſpeake,

are taken ſpeechleſſe: hee that was taken but for a child, hath appeared to bee the moſt valiant and magnanimious King in the world, the true ſonne of Henry the Great: and thoſe that erected gallowes for the Kings good ſeruants, are hung theron themſelues.
                  
                  FINIS.
               
               
                  
                     Phoebus once mounted, Phoebe decline's her ſtate,
                     Cut-throtes and Theeues are now quite out of date:
                     Truth's ſpoken freely, to the ſhame of liers,
                     Good men at length haue got their long deſires.

                     When Conchini came to Hell,
                     The Fiends withstood him, and did yell▪
                     
                     And cried out on God amaine,
                     Doe not we, here ſuffer paine
                     Enough already, in this place?
                     Where we haue no reſting ſpace:
                     In theſe Caues we (wer't thou contented)
                     Enough already are tormented.
