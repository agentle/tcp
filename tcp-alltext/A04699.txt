D. xxxix for preching / onely faith to iustifye. By these his articles / Winchester wold proue that workes muste iustifye / that is to saye / with owr workes we muste merite the remission of owr synnes. Whiche doctryne / as it is cō
               trarye to Gods worde / so is it iniuriouse to Christis blode. Whose godly name is / OneGenes▪ xvij. alone for all sufficent / euen that same precious hid tresure in the gospell / in whō (saithMath. xiij Paul) are all the tresures of wysdome and knowlege hyden. For in him dwellethe theCol. ij. moste perfit fulnes of god verelye / & in him ar we complete / euē perfitly iustifyed / with owt any inweiuing of Winchesters works.

            In Pauls tyme there strayed about a certayne idle sorte and secte of heretyks called Nazares / or Minei / the moste subtyle kinde of men in paintinge and perswadinge their false doctryne. These heretiks troubled and ꝑuerted the chirchis wel instituted of the apostles / especiallye the Galathens / Antiochens and Romans / agenst whose heresyes Paul did wryte so mightely and ernestly cō

These pharisais laboured in the same heresye in which / Winch. now techeth and writeth / mixinge the obseruance of the law with the grace of the gospel / euē works with faith to iustifye. These Nazares confessed Christe to be god and man / that he dyed rose agen &c̄: but vnto him onelye / thorowe owr faith thei attributed not all owr wholl iustificacion / but parte therof (as now dothe Win.) to the works of the lawe as vnto our own merits / and parte to his passiō making christe a sauiour to halues. But is christe diuidedi. cor. i.  saith Paul? These heretyks descended out of the faccion of the pharisais / as nowe do owr iusticiaries owte of the Pelagians /

But the scrip ture cōcluded all vnder syn that the promyse / the promise (I saye) out of the faith of Ie su Chryste shuld be geuen and not deserued to the beleuers. Thus ye see howe with so many wordes paul excludeth Win. impossible condicion / to make faste the promyse in Christe that owr faith might be the sewerer stayede and cleaue to it. If onelye vnbeleif dampneth / why shulde not onelye faithe iustifye? it is a good argumente of contrarye.

               And I saye the contrary. That a man beīgeGeorg Ioye. in dedlye synne may haue no grace to do the

workes of penance / as I feare me it will be verifyed of Win. himself.

This is lo / his doctryne / A man muste do the works of penance before he be iustifyed and so by siche workes merite and deserue his iustificacion and forgeuenes of sinnes.
