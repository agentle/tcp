               RIght Honorable my singuler good Lord, there
came to my hands of late a booke conteyning all
the tunes of the Psalmes, as they are ordinarilie
soung in the Church, composed into foure parts
by M. William Damon late one of hir Maiesties
seruaunts, which booke being found not onely in
my poore opinion, but in the riper iudgement of
some speciall Musicions to be excellentlie sette,
either to serue for voices or instruments: for
the great vse that might come thereof, and partlie
to preserue the labours of the Auctor, so worthie and skillfull a man in his
profession: also to leaue his Religion and pietie herein witnessed, that so carefullie
and speciallie laboured to aduaunce the vse of singing the Psalmes: I was
earnestlie dealt with all not to deteyne that as a part of my priuate store in Musicke,
that of it selfe conteyned matter so worthie publiquelie to enterteyne and to
receiue enterteynment. Therefore with their perswasions and reasons, I was
brought to publish them for the vse and comfort of all, especially of the godlie.
And now right honorable my verie good Lord, calling to minde the dutie, honor,
and seruice due by mee vnto your good Lordship, for the great loue and fauour
which I haue alwaies receiued at your L. hands. (For I acknowledge my selfe
to none more bound then to your honor:) I haue beene the more emboldened to
present this simple worke to passe vnder your L. fauour and protection. Wishing
that the same may chieflie serue to the glorie & praise of God. And then at your
L. pleasure, at some times for the recreation of your minde, after your worthie
and great trauayle from day to day taken in the most weightie affaires of this
commonwealth. And so I commend your good L. to the mercifull keping of
thalmightie God.
            
               Your good L. most bound
during life,
William Swayne.
               
            
         
         
            
            To the Reader.
            
               HEretofore gentle Reader, M. William Damon one of
her Maiesties Musitions, being earnestly requested by
a friend of his did at sundry times when he resorted to
his friends house compose the tunes of Dauids Psalms
as they are ordinarily soung in the Church note for note, intending
thē for his friends priuate vse. These Psalmes so set, & made
without labour or purpose to publish them, were notwithstanding
published by the same friend of M. Damon; which not answering
thexpectation that many had of the Auctors skill, gaue
him occasion to take vppon him a new labour to recouer the
wrong his friend did in publishing that that was so done, as
might well please him, but was not purposed or framed for the
learned eares of our times. Therefore at his best leisure & fittest
times he composed the same tunes againe in so excellent a manner
that by comparison of these and the former, the Reader may
by triall see that the Auctor could not receiue in his Art such a
note of disgrace by his friends ouersight before, but that now
the same is taken away, and his worthie knowledge much more
graced by this second trauaile. Now to acquaynt thee with the
Auctors order in this second woorke, he hath for varietie gone
through the Psalmes twice, which are now deuided into two
Setts: whereof in the former the ordinarie singing part is caried
in the Tenor: In the second set it is conueyed in the highest part.
Herein ther is required of the Reader, if he be a louer of Musick,
that he would accept of their labour that haue taken paines in
publishing exactlie a worke of such singuler skill, and speciall
vse for them, that after the serious labour of their calling are desirous
rather to recreate them selues in singing of Psalmes, then
in other exercises of lesse comfort, and euill marke.
