               WHereas you require me, to sende you myne owne knowledge & the truest in

troth or vntroth of thinfamous reports made of the Queenes Maiestie of Scotland, for & about the death of the Lord Darley her late husband: vnderstād you, that albe it your request may do much with me, yet whē I haue gone about to accomplish the same, I find the entreprise thereof greater, then perhaps it semed to your self: th

               res past, so secretly contriued that now some difficultie is it▪ to boult out the truth, & withal the particularities & circumstāces so intricat, that it would require the labour of a better penman, then my self, to set out the same.
            And that which I haue do
                  ••
                albeit I began it at your request,

yet when I had entred to informe my self of the bottome therof, I began then to thinke, that euen for dutie & conscience sake, I was bound to bestowe therin a litle more paine, regarding the terrible sequeles and lamentable consequēces, which I might perceiue were intended to be grounded & builded vpon such forged foundations and malitious inuentions, as I plainly discouered from time to time to be newly contriued, not only first ageynst her Maiesties self, but then also ageinst her said husband, & euery other good seruant and subiect, that could not be hoped to be won to the Aduers partie: I meane Iames Stewarde bastard brother to the Queene, Priour of S. Andrew. Who though he had bene created by her Earle

of Murrey, & aduanced to more then 25. thousand pounds Scottish of yearely reuenue, had yet his eye bent vpon such a marke & ende, as few or none of long time were able to espie: that is to say, an aspiring ambition to vsurpe ye Croune of the Realm vnto himself, so as whiles they y• first set him on worke, suborning him to take the matter in hand, & stil supported him in the same, thought thereof to serue their owne turnes, & least intē
               ded that, whiche he most eyed: euen so did he likewise in his course and path, by acceptinge their pensions and so muche of their counselles, as made for his turne, serued him selfe, and made his profit of them.
            And now for the more plain, orderly and compendious opening of the matter, I haue thought good, so to frame my

speache, as if my selfe were the answerer of the Obiections, & to diuide the same into fower parts or chapiters. In ye first I wil place the Answers to certein friuolous presumptions, that seme to be gathered out of some infamous libel, or slaūderous pamflet that hath bene set forth ageinst ye Quene, & shewed in sundry Cours of Princes abrode: whereby they labour to induce some shew of likelihod, that ye Quenes Highnes might be cōsenting to the murder of ye Lord Darley her late husband: whom they themselues cruelly made away, as in ye course & processe of ye matter shal clerely appere. And in that part also shal ensue vehemēt presumptiōs on the cōtrary side, that maketh it more thā probable, that it could not possibly be, that her Brace could be consenting thervnto.
            
               
                In the second you shall see the Obiections of the Accusers, with the Answer that is to be made vnto them, & therwithal certein deare and notorious proufes of her Maiesties innocēcie, for any maner foreknowledge or consent therevnto.
            
                In ye third Chapter you shal finde, not only vehement presumptions, but moste cleare & euident prouffes, that her Accusers them selues, mainely the Earle of Murrey her bastard brother, were the contriuers, procurers and some of them the Actors of the sayd murder.
            
                The fourth Chapter shal disscipher vnto you the whole plat of this foule tragedie, with the particuler parts therof, frō the first Acte to the last, so farfoo

such respect, as is conuenient to some of the parties yet liuyng, with a short remonstrāce of Gods wonderful workinges therein, in merciful preseruing the innocent Lady and her deare sonne, in discouering the drift of those moste lewde & vile practises, and due pūnishment already taken vpon some of the Malefactors.

                     iuolous surmises made by the slaunderers, whereby they laboure to insinuate some likelyhod, that the Queene of Scotland should be consenting to the murder of the Noble prince the lord Darley her late husband, together with other vehement presumptions produced in her defence to the contrary.

                   IT is like (say they) she was willing to the murder: for there was no good agreement betwe

                   Item, the said Lord Darley was not so honourably buried, as had bene conuenient.
               To the former of these two ghesses it is answeared,
                     Answer to the 
                           •••
                        st.
                   that though there had bene once in very dede some vnkindnes betwene them, by reason of the Lorde Darley being abused for want of yeares & experience, by the subtile practises of the craftie fore the Earle of Murrey & his Complices, who sought to kindle in the mind of that noble yong Gentleman an ambitious desire to aspire to the kingdom, & to conceaue vnkindnes in the

Queene, for that hauing made him her husband, she did not also forthwith make him king of her Realme, hauing therfore persuaded him, to ioyne with them in the murder of Dauid her faithful Secretarie (whom they made him beleue to be his hinderer) and in the vndutifull and insolent restraint of her person: yet the sayd Lord Darley sone after finding his owne errour, and perceiuing, that their attempts tended to farther and worse ende then at the first pretended, and being ashamed of his very euill & vnkind dealing, through euil counsel, toward her Highnes, to whom he was so singulerly bound, reconciled him selfe in suche hartie sort to her Grace, and so discouered vnto her all the design
                     •
                  mentes, that he knewe of

the said Murrey and his Complices: that al thing past being remitted, ther renewed betwen them as harty loue, as euer had ben, according to the old & true saying: Amantium irae amoris redintegratio est. And thervpō (for proufe that the reconciliation was vnfeyned of her part) by her excellent wit and policie first she saued both him and her self, by making shift secretly in the night to escape out of the chamber: where after the murder of Dauid they had rudely thruste her being great with childe, and deteined her imprisoned with no small danger of her life.
               Moreouer her Highnes hearing not long after, that vpon his arriual at Glasco, he was fallen sicke, forthwith repaired to him with all spede, cumforting

and cherishing him in all she could, till she had recouered him: and euen so likewise at Edenborough she kept cū
                  pany with him, and tenderly cherished him euen to the very last houre that euer she sawe him, so that longe before his death there was not only a perfect reconciliation betwene thē, but suche hartie and faithfull loue, as no practice that Murrey and his fellowes could make, was hable eftsones to worke any breache betwene them. Which considered, and beeing notoriously knowen to be true, a man may with Terence truely say to the suggester of that presumption:

                     Non sat commodè
                     Diuisa sunt temporibus tibi▪
                     
                     Daue, haec.
                  
               
               
                  To the second presumptiō by the flaūderers alleaged, in that he was not so solemnely buried, as was conuenient: it is answered, that his body was honourably enbalmed, seared, and interred bysides king Iames the v. her Graces father, and was accompanied to that place with Iustice Clarke, the Lorde of Traquar, and many other Gentlemen of reputation. The ceremonies in dede were (against her Graces wil) the fewer, bycause the most part of her Councell were Protestants, who could abide no ceremonies, & some of them had before interred their owne Noble parents without accustomed solemnities and ceremonies.  But it had bene no harde matter for her Highnes, neyther wanted she wisedome and policie,

if she had bene guiltie of his death, to haue cloked the same with solemne funeralles: which hath ben, & is a thing very vsual & cōmon in such cases.
               The two simple presumptious of the Aduersaries being thus truely answered, I will now lay foorth certaine others on the other side of farre more weight, to shewe, that it was neither likely, nor almost possible, that her Highnes could be consenting to that foule murder of her dere husband.
               First, bycause that Sexe  generally abhorreth by nature suche horrible murder, it could not possibly be, that of many other women her Highnes (who had alwaies before appeared to be of a most mude, courteous & honourable nature, seeking by wonderfull clemencie & mercie

to winne the harts of her enemies (of whom she had before pardoned some more thē once) could by any likelyhod fal vpō the sodaine frō the heigth of so excellēt vertue, as she was renoumed for through Christendom, to the depe pit of such horrible synne and crueltie: as to murder her owne husband, a noble and goodly yong Prince whom shee so tenderly loued. For that as good men assisted with Gods grace, doo dayly rise as it were by degrees from vertue to vertue: so no man becommeth vpon the sodaine, of excellent vertuous, extreme vitious, but descendeth rather by diuers stepps from worse to worse, before he come to the hiddeous bottomme of suche vnnaturall crueltie, as vnneth a Tygre, or any other sauage

beast would haue vsed towarde her make.
               Secondly if her Highnes had  bene desirous to haue bene rid of him (wherof there is no probabilitie) she had good & lawfull meane to haue compassed that by ordinarie course of law, for the murder of her Secretary, in whose body his dagger was founde sticking. For though he were her Graces husband, yet was he in an other respect her subiect, and vnder her lawes.
               Thirdly she wold not cōsent  so much as to be diuorced from him, whervnto diuers of her Nobilitie earnestly aduised & persuaded her: to whome she modestly and louingly answered, that she would in no wise so doo. For though he were yet yong, and somewhat loose,

for want of experience and staied wisedome: yet shee nothing doubted, but he would in time proue a noble, wise and vertuous Gentleman, and that she should with her dutiful and louing behauiour toward him sone winne & reduce him from those smal ouersights, which his tender mynde corrupted with euil counsel, had fallen into, whereof she sawe in him alreadie a modest mislyking, and thereby great cause to hope as she did. But that euery way how so euer he should at any time forget him selfe, yet shee would neuer wittingly cōmit thing, whereby shee should on her part, seeme in any respect vnmindefull of her dutie toward him, whome shee did and would hartely loue, not doubting of the like in time

at his hande toward her.
               Fourthly, it is to be considered, and not impertinent to this weightie case, to obserue the Rule of Cassius, in examinyng and consideryng, Cui bono? whiche in suche coniecturall causes may geue great light of the truth, by noting, whether parte, the accuser, or els the accused, were like to take moste benefit by the fact.
               It is certain, that her Highnes could gaine nothing therby, but the heauy displeasure of God, and perpetual infamie to her personne: without the hasarding whereof she had good and orderly meane, by due course of lawe, to haue bene ridde of him, had she bene so disposed. But by the dispatche of him in that sorte, the

Earle Murrey gayned first to be reuenged of him for reuolting from him, and disclosing to the Queene his moste traiterous conspiracies and vnkind practises ageynste her Highnes: to whome the sayd Earle was for her great liberalitie & bountifulnes towarde him so singulerly bound. He geyned also that notable occasiō, which he had long sought, to drawe the Queene into slaunder and mislike with her best frinds: which was one principall step toward the ende, wherevnto his ambitious minde tended.
            
            
               
                  The answer to the two principal points, wherevpon the slaunderers doe moste stifly relye, as the chiefe colours of any probabilitie in their most slaunderous accusation

of the Queenes Highnes, together with certaine moste notorious and clere prouses of her Graces innocencie, in procuring, allowing, or so muche as foreknowing any whit of that horrible fact.
               
               CAPVT. 2.
               BYsydes the coniectural presumptions
                     Obiections.
                   before remēbred two especial thinges are there (say they) so notorious to conuince her of procuring the murder: that she nor any her frinds can euer, as they thinke, be hable to auoyde them.
               The first is a letter of her  owne hand writtē to the Earle Bothwell, which letter (they say) was founde emong other letters in a box taken vpon Dugglish the Earle Bothwels

man: who was sent with the said box to the Earle his Master, from Sir Iames Balfore Capte
                     •
                  ne of Edenborough Castle.
               
                   The second (wherwith they assure themselues they haue hit euē the naile on the very head) is her mariage with the Earle Bothwel, who is wel knowen (as they now say) to haue bene one of the murderers of ye Lord Darley her former husband.
               This is (say they) in the iudgemēt of al the world such a testimonie ageynst her, as there is nothing to be said vnto it.
               These in dede carie a great shew, and geue a very hollow sound: but so doth the emptie runne, if it be knocked on, yea it geueth a greater sound, then that which is ful of good wine. So doth the Cannon charged

onely with pouder, make as greate a noyse, as that which shooteth forth a stone, and battereth the sturdy bulwarke.
               But first for answer of your letter, whiche you make suche price of, & haue so often shewed both in the Court of England, and in al other places, where you haue come, as it might be wondered, that it should not be worne in peeces with often handling long care this time, if you had not some extraordinarie meane to preserue or renewe it: I pray you, let me demaunde of you, what date beareth the letter? None, you say. No doth? Wel, go to, perhaps it might be forgotten. Whose name is subscribed thereto? None. No is? Why, how should the Earle then knowe, whence it came?

wel inough, you say, by the hand which was her owne and so well knowen. Why? 
                     〈◊〉
                   might she as wel haue 
                     •
                  ouentured the subscribinge of her name, as the writyng of the letter with her owne knowen hand. But had it, trow we, any superscription? Truely to say, it had none neither. How know you then, that it was writen to the Earle Bothwel, and not as wel to any other man? The messenger (you wil say) knew wel inough, to whom he shuld deliuer it. That ma
                     •
                   be, but how knowe you? Haue you at any time spokē with him, that was the bearer thereof to the Earle? It is wel knowen, ye neither, haue, nor could: syns ther was neuer any suche messenger, nor euer any such letter sent by her or receyued by him, as shall

hereafter plainely inough appeare. But this letter, I doubt not, cō
                  
                     •
                  eiuing such secrets, was fast and cunningly sealed. In good sooth, men say that haue sene it, there is no shewe, that euer it was sealed, or fast closed. A foule ouersight truely. You may see, the olde saying is true, that often tymes haste maketh waste. But what good lucke had you, so luckely to light on this letter, so long after: syns there is special request made therin to the receiuer, presently to burne it, after he had read it? Wel, let vs consider yet a litle better of this dealing, and conferre the times: perhappe we may thereby finde some more light in the matter.
               This letter (you say) was taken vpon Dugglish emong other letters sent in a box from

Sir Iames Balfoore the Captaine of Edenborough Castle. When? Forsoth after you had taken armes ageinst the Queene and Bothwel, & driuen them both to flee. But who can beleue you herein? Isther (I pray you) any probabilitie or likelyhod, that either the Erle would sende to the said Sir Iames, who assisted yt factiō ageinst the Quene with the strēgth & force of Edenborough Castle, & had driuen frō thēce the very Earle him self? Or is it likely, that the sayd Sir Iames would for goodwil seke to cōuey any such thing to the Earle, whose open enemie he was? Is this likely? Is it credible? Nay, would he not rather haue kept it for euidence ageynst the Queene and the sayd Erle Bothwel for some colour & excuse of y• vndutiful

reuolte made by himselfe, & the rest of you against her highnes, being his & your lawful & natural Soueraign? May it not once againe be said wel & truely to y• forster in of this false die?
               
                  Non sat cōmodè Diuisa sunt temporibus tibi, Daue, haec.
               
               Can any wise man thinke it likely, that the Queene hauing alwaies shewed herself so modest, so circumspecte and wise, wold write any such letter with her owne hande, as mighte by any possibilitie be produced against her in such euident sort to touch her honour? Or if shee had ben so void of grace, of her wōted womāly shamefastnes, & of al regard to her honour, as she could haue condescended to write any such letter, was she so sodeinly becom so simple of wit & he also, y• both thei wold haue

suffered that letter to remaine extāt to the peril of them both, namely since the Earle was (you say) expressely required in the same, foorthwith to burne it? But yet it is her letter, you say. How proue you it? Or is your credit such that you think men must needes beleue it, bycause you say it? The Ciuil Law, by which your Coūtrey is gouerned, saith: Sciāt cūcti ac cusatores &? In English thus.
               
                  Let al accusers know, that they must bring to publik notice only such thing,

                      as is cōfirmed by apte, lauful and sufficiēt witnesses, or layd foorth with open documents and demonstration, or plainly vnfolded by vndoubtful prouffes as cleare as the day light.
               
               This rule in the triall of criminal causes is to be obserued

                     •
                   person that liueth. Let vs see then, whether you haue obserued it toward your Soueraigne. You produce to defame her, a letter, which you say she wrote with her owne hand to y• Erle Bothwel: which letter yet beareth no date, no subscriptiō, no superscription, no seale, no one word in it of cōmandmēt to cōmit the vile murder or any other cruel fact, or importing ani liking, or somuch as knowlege of any such fact before don. But you say, it hath in it these suspicious wordes: our affaiers. As though the Queene had no affaiers to imploie her faithful & foretried subect but in the murdring of her husbād, which you ghesse she mēt by those words. O impudēt & vnkind subiects, that be not ashamed, if she had

writtē any such thing, so measure & construe the meaning of your moste vertuous Soueraigne, by the vitious cōcepts that possesse your owne vnnatural and dishonest mindes! But who was the bearer of this letter? Of like, the man in y• mone. For he that you would needes face to be the bearer, toke God and his conscience to recorde at his death, that it was vtterly vntrue. So doth y• Queene her self, protesting vpō her honour and faith, that she neuer wrote that letter. So did her Highnes Commissioners at Yorke, opēly producing, for proufe that it was forged, two other letters written in her name with her hand notably counterfaited by one emong you, whom for some respects I wil forbeare to name.
               
                  There is recorded by Valerius Maximus,
                  Lib. 
                        •
                     . cap. 7. de fiducia sui. of a noble Roman, whose name was M. Aemilius Scaurus, a man of greate credit, and seruice in the commō welth, that was accused by one Varius a vile person of no credit or accōpt: to whose accusation the Noble man woulde vouchsafe no other answ
                     ••
                   but thus: He saith it: I denie it. Upon which onely answer, the people of Rome, being present, did not onely with one voice presently acquit y• noblemā: but forthwith theifel vpō y• accuser, & forced him out of y• place, nor without some daunger of his life. Suche was the credit of that Nobleman, and such the Noble consideration of that graue and wel aduised people: y• his only denial weied downe all that the other had craftily

forged, & was estemed for sufficient matter both to acquit ye accused, & to condemne the accuser. The like with as good reason might haue ben don in this case, vpō the only denial of this moste noble Queene & renoumed Ladie. But thus muche I thought not amisse to sette doune in answer of this point of the supposed letter, for the ful satisfiyng of the curious.
               Now to the answere of the  second Obiection touching the pretensed mariage of the Earle Bothwel, it might be wondered, with what face they themselues, that were the earnest solicitours and procurers of the Queene thervnto, could have y• boldenes now to charge her Highnes therewith, if so many their other doinges had not shewed them to be past al shame

& grace. But for the cleare opening of that drift, it is to be knowen & deepely considered, that the Earle Murrey, hauing as it may seeme, sucked a traiterons minde euen with the milke of his lewde mother, prefixing to him selfe, that nothing could better serue to the aduancement of his traiterous designements, then to bring the Queene into slaunder and obloquie of the world, & therby to alienate from her the minds of her frindes and subiectes: found now, that the next parte he had to plaie, was to worke, if he could by any policie, suche a fetche, as the Queene might be brought ignorātly to match herselfe in mariage with one of the murtherers. He therefore layed al his irons in the fyre, & least no stone vnremoued, or

way vnattempted, to persuade her bothe by earnest letters, (which her Highnes hath yet to shewe signed with his owne hand, and with the handes of diuers Noble men, and others his Confederats) as also with diligent and daily solicitations otherwise (namely by one of their conspirac
                     ••
                   then placed about her for that purpose) to take to husband the said Earle Bothwel, whom (to remoue al struple they the Conspirators them selues had acquitted by their verdict, of the murder, whereof he was somewhat suspected: hauing also prepared an open way to that part of the Tragedie, by procuring a diuorce alitle before, at the sute of ye olde Coūtesse of Duntley, betwene the said Earle Bothwel and his wife▪ her daughter, for

that they were so nere of kinne, as with conscience (forsoth) thei might not continue together. Pretending farther vnto the Queene, that bysides ye diuorce before lawfully passed (as they said) God had also taken the said Ladie Bothwel to his mercie, so as to apparence there remained no impedimente, but that her Highnes might marie him. And so they earnestly aduised and praied her Grace to doe, as the onely manne, that for his Nobilitie, wisedome, valiantnesse, and many other vertues, they all iudged the fittest husbande in the Realme for her Highnesse, & most likely by his wisedome to staie the troubles, yt were like to growe by ye diuers factions, that were emōg ye noble men: who would souer be appeased, and commit

                  ded by him, then by any stranger, whose rule they should perhappes not be very apt so willingly to brooke.
               The Queene seing this their earnest sute, with their moste faithful promises (as they seemed) of willing seruice & most assured loialtie to the vttermost of their power, in case shee would take the said Erle Bothwel to her husband, myngled also with some threats, if shee should refuse so to do: & withal calling to her mind the sodeine and diuers vprores and seditions allready made ageynst her, the cruel murder of her Secretarie in her owne presence, the late strange and most lamentable murder of her husband, the diseumforte, distresse and desolate estate wherein she

presently stode, the Earles actiuitie in martial affaiers, the good & faithful seruice done by him to her mother and her self: fearing also some new sturre & imminēt troble, if she should denie and refuse this so earnest sute made vnto her by her Nobilitie (though she wer always before that time very wise, circumspect & prudent in al other her doinges: yet being a womā circumuented by so many craftie heads, & tossed with diuers cogitations, neuer being opēly or priuately so muche as once admonished, that he was in trouth guiltie of the murder (which seing and hearing, as shee sawe and heard, she found no manner cause to suspect) and bring in the myddes of these careful thoughts, was met one day, as she was ryding vpon

the way toward Kircliften, by the said Earle armed & accompanied with men of warre, & by him taken from her companie, & perforce caried to Dunbarre Castle, where what with faire meanes, and what with setting before her eyes many imminēt dāgers, if she refused, & being destitute of al coūsell or aduise, & of all presence & accesse of any of her faithful seruāts or frinds, at ye last she assented (at y• sute made by himself, & so many other of the Nobilitie) to that pretensed mariage. The consummation whereof, the Confederates had not so sone cōpassed, but forthwith they proceeded to the next Act of their Tragedie, geuing out bruits into al Countries, yt she had caused her husbād to be murthered, & maried ye murderer, which for yt it

stood not (forsoth) with their honour to indure, they presently toke armes, & ef

                  nding & be witching ye world for ye time, with the probabilitie of their assertiō much increased by that her pretensed mariage: wherof themselues were only yt procurers, as before they had bene of the murthering of her Secretarie and her husband.
               Thus do you see, how this good Lady hath ben handled, & how easie a matter it is for a nūber of subtill & crafty heads, to ouertake & deceiue a good, milde & wel meaning Lady destitute of coūsel. For her faithful coūsellers seeing the number & puissance of ye cōtrary faction so great, & by Knoxes pulpit alarmes daily so increase, taking a fair warning by ye secretaries

end, durst not once quitche, or geue vnto her Grace such sound aduise, as their duties required But hereof inough. Let the Cō
                  spirators make now what thei can of the pretensed mariage: the more they talke therof, the more they do manifest to the world their owne most shamelesse impudencie, in turning now to an argument of suspicion ageynst the Queene, that which them selues so busily contriued, and vnnaturally executed. Whereof their owne letters, handes, and seales remaine witnesses voide of all suspicion.
               Thus hauing answered these two their chief & principal Obiectiōs, to wit, of the letter & of ye pretensed mariage: I wi lay forth before you certeine cleare proufes and notorious testimonies

of her innocencie of that case of the murder.
               First vnderstand you, that a seruāt of the Earle Bothwel being executed for the murder, confessed in the hearing of fiue thousand people and mo, that Murrey and his Complites were the principal counsailers and assisters with his master in that murder, and that so his master had tolde him: and confessed also to haue sene the Indentures, wherein the Conspirators had bound them selues eche to other, to make away the Lorde Darley vpon the first opportunitie that might be offered.
               Also Iohn Hay of Tallowe, Pourie, Dugglish and Paris being al put to death, for that they were the executioners of that murder, did al and euery

of them seuerally at their death, protest vpon their consciences, as they hoped to be saued at the latter daie, that not onely the Queenes highnes was vtterly innocent and vnwitting of the Lord Darleys death, but that the same was cōmitted chiefly by the counsel, inuention, and drift of the Earle Murrey, and some others, whose names I spare for iust respectes.
               
                   Secondly, the Lord Harris, a stout, graue, & faithful Noble man (who was at the first made priuy to the deuise, & after vpon good causes to long to be rehersed in this letter) withdrew himself from any farther action or dealing in the matter, tolde an Earle yet liuing, to his face euen at the Earles owne table, nulla circuitione vsus, that the saide Earle was of counsell to

the murder of the Lorde Darley.
               And afterward at Yorke did the like openly in presence of the English Commissioners, to the face of Murrey, and of the other (whose name I will forbeare to expresse, in hope of his repentance) and there protested, that he well knewe, the Queene to be vtterly giltlesse and innocente of the matter, nobly demaunding the combat of them both in that quarrel.
               Thirdly, when the Confederates  hauing nowe laid and raised so farfoorth the foundation of their building, that they thought the worlde blinded with the mistes they had cast, would iudge they had reason in their doings: then proceeded they to open rebellion,

taking armes, and assembling people agaynst their Queene, whome they falsely charged with diuers crimes without care of their conscience, allegeance, the offense of God or regarde to any other honest or duetiful respect, being caried hedlong with a furious desire only to that end, wherto their restlesse ambitious heads had so longe before bended their Macheuelian practises.
               The Queene seeing this, assembled likewise a strong armie of her faithful subiects, to represse these Rebels. Wherevpō thei perceiuing her Heighnes to draw fast toward them, sent to her from Edenborough (where by the fauour of Sir Iames Balfore the Ca
                     ••
                  ellan they had assembled them selues and their power) a Noble

mā yet lyuing, who in ye names of al the lords and other confederats, did most humbly vpon his knees assure her Highnes of the securitie of her person, of the safetie both of her life and honour, and of al loialtie and obedience at their hands, if it would please her Grace, to forbeare force, & to come peaceably into the towne of Edenbrough, & ioyne with them in searching out & pōnishing the murder of the Lord Darley her late husband: the reuēge wherof (they sayed) was the only cause of their assembly, and that in so doing her Highnes shuld finde them al there as ready to serue her to the sheding of their blood, as any in her owne armie there present.
               The good Queene hearing this their humble sute, and thinking

them to haue meant as plainly and honourably as she did, loth (if it might be auoided) to see such effusion of the blood of her subiectes, as was like otherwise to follow, and being armed with the secure testimonie of a giltlesse conscience, hauing there withall a minde no lesse desirouse in dede to see the horrible murder of her late moste deare husbande boulted out, and duely punnished, as so heinouse a crime deserued, then they in wordes pretended to haue, carriyng with her the innocēcy of her owne cōscience, yeelded ouer soone to this the
                     •
                   fraudulent sute: and so leauing her power, made repaire into the Towne of Edenborough, where when shee was arriued, expecting to haue bene in solemne and dutifull sort receiued

by the Lordes according to the saide Noble mannes woordes and pretensed promises made in all their names, her Highnesse to her greate amasinge, founde all contrary. For her aduersaries proudlye remaining in her Graces Palace▪ (whereof they hadde possessed themselues) seeing nowe the praie in their handes, which they had so long hunted after, and whereon they intended to feede their bloudy and ambitiouse mindes, were so farre from dooing that whiche they had promised, and she expected, that they caused her to alight at a marchantes house, & there rudely and homely vsing her Grace al that daie, ye next night made her priuily and spedely to be cōueied in disguised apparel to ye strōg Castel of Loghleuen:

where, within a few daies she was dispoiled of her Princely ornaments, and clothed with a course broune ca
                     ••
                  ocke. And though the good Lady ful often remembred vnto them their faithful promises, & made most pitiful & earnest intercessiō, that shee might be brought before the Counsel, to haue her cause iustly examined: yet for al this could finde no maner fauour or iustice at their handes.
               The said Earle Murrey then hauing brought his reckenings to this passe, presently without shame or farther cunctation, boldely vsurped and intruded himselfe into the gouernement of the Realme, for the whiche his ambitious and traiterous mind had so long and so greedily thirsted.
               The Queene seeing these

thinges, and being therewith not a litle astonied, repented, though to late, her so quiet relenting to their sute, and ouerquicke crediting their feyned humble promises: when shee was in case wel enough by force to haue suppressed them. But this her doing gaue ye
                     •
                   a moste cleare and notorious testimonie to the worlde of her innocent conscience, tender care of her subiects liues, and a plaine honourable mynd farre from crafte, and muche farther from such blooddy and cruel malice, as could geue cō
                  sent to the murder of her husband, whome shee so dearely loued.
               This her guiltlesse innocencie was yet more notoriously testified, when her Highnes being by the merciful prouidence

& mighty hand of God deliuered out of the strong Castel of Loghleuen, enuironed with a brode large water, furnished with great garde and nūbers of souldiers, & whereof the Lorde of the Castel himself▪ being Murreys halfe brother did euery night kept the keies▪ whē, I say, she being thus miraculously deliuered & offered by diuers her owne subiects, to be trustely cōueied into their qua

the worthie Cardinall of Loraine, and the reast of her Noble Uncles, bare vnder the yong King and his mother the chiefe swey in the gouernment of the Realme: did yet for the more notoriouse clearyng of her selfe, and notifiyng of her innocencie to the world, chuse voluntarily, to make her repaire into Englande, where shee knewe were the Earle of Lineux, and the Noble Princesse the Ladie Margarete, her late husbandes father and mother, who (she trusted) would not see the blood of their deare sonne vnreuenged: where also shee knewe were a worthie sorte of Noble menne, who woulde by all likelyhood affoord their traueile in the indifferente examination of the cause, and therevppon finding

out the truth, would doe iustice to the guiltie for the murder of their Noble countrieman, and see the innocent both preserued and reuenged. How could her Highnes geue a more notable testimony of her innocency and most guiltlesse conscience!
               Fourthly, see how wonderfully  God prospered this her most noble and honest intent. For the Cōmissioners of England assigned and assembled at Yorke for the examination of that cause, who beeing before sore incensed ageinst ye Queene by the craftie & malitious practises of her aduersaries, broght with them so small affection to her part, and had deuised and appointed the plat of their proceeding so litle to her aduantage, that Iames the Regent, and the rest, that were aduerse

parties against her (who had not at al come out of Scotland to charge and accuse her, but vpon the assured hope and promise made vnto them by the English authoritie) should be first heard, and al their accusations at their desired length, opened & declared, before any of ye Cōmissioners of ye Queene of Scotlāds part shuld be heard, or suffred to answere any point or article of their accusatiōs, vntil ye same were fully & wholy giuē in all at lēgth against her. Which accusations and presumptions that they the partie rebels minded to exhibit, beeing supposed to be matter sufficiēt to occupie the Commissioners some daies, and to spende so much time, as might geue vnto the world a shewe and pretence of an indifferent proceeding, it

was then farther promised vnto them, and agreed betwene the English Gouernours and the Scottish Rebels, that their accusations being once heard, and enrolled, and a short word or two suffred to be spoken for a shew by the Queene of Scotlands Cōmissioners, that then the 
                     ••
                  glishe Commissioners should make some quarel, and feine some cause to arise, to breake of, & to make an ende of al that Colloquie & Cōmission. Which horrible confederacie of partial proceding notwithstanding, the said Englsh Cōmissioners were yet so moued with that which fell out before them to ye manifest prouf of ye Quenes innocencie, & of the depe malice of her accusers (so far frō their cōceiued opiniō & expectatiōs) that their former wrōg cōcepts

groūded vpon y• false rumors & other mischieuous practises of her aduersaries, beganne generally to cease so farforth as they became to pitie her case, & made earnest request, y• shee might be restored to her Croune. And certaine Noble men (you know whome I may meane) hauing before spoken very broade and largely against her Highnesse, did then cleane alter the course of their talke, beeing sorie for that, which they vppon to light credit had said before. Also the principal of the very Commissioners themselues, to witte, the Noble Duke of Norfolke a right high and excellent Prince, the chief Peere of the Realme of England, conceiued so great liking of her Graces innocencie & vertue, which fel out apparāt by that whiche was there vttered

in the course of the matter debated before his excellencie, and the rest of the Commissioners, that vppon his reporte made thereof to the State and Counsell of Englande: and by the motion and aduise of sundry of the Counsell and Nobilitie, he beganne to bethinke himself of matching with her in mariage: and vpon good consideration of her wel proued honor & innocencie, desired at length nothing more, then that his hap might be so good, to match in mariage with so vertuouse a Ladie. And shortly after, loue farther kindling and increasing in his noble mind toward her, not blinded with affection to her beutie, whom to this houre hee neuer sawe, but inflamed with the iust loue and liking of her singular vertues, which he

sawe there suffciently testified: he became by meanes, not only a suter for himselfe, but diuerse others also of the chief Nobilitie of England, seing how honorable and conuenient to the parties themselues, and profitable to bothe Realmes (standing in termes as they doe) that matche were like to proue, became also in his Graces behalfe humble suters vnto her Highnes. Whiche coulde not haue hapned, if vpon the examination and hearing of the cause, there had fallen out any suspect or probabilitie of truth, in the vile matters and obiections surmised against her by her aduersaries. For it is nothing likely, that his Grace abounding, as he doth, in wisedome, wealth, power, general loue of his countriemen, and in

maner with all other worldly felicitie, would seeke to matche in mariage with one, that had iustly remained in any suspiciō of hauing murdered her former husband.
               Thus doth the wonderful goodnes of God daily appeare toward the innocent wronged and oppressed, that humbly resigne themselues & their cause into his hands. For how could any man almost with or deuise more manifest & notable things to happen for the no
                     •
                  orious discouerie and testimonie of the Queenes innocencie in the fact wherwith she hath bene by her ambitious & ingratful enemies so slaunderously charged, then these, which haue since hapned?
               But nowe, sith we see her Highnes so fully cleared, it shal not be amisse, to note, what vehemēt

presumptions, nay what open prouffes and cleare argumentes haue on the other side fallen out in the course & handling of these matters, against the accusers, to conuince euen themselues of guilt, in conspiring, procuring & compassing that cruel murder, wherof they thought to auert the suspicion from themselues, by laying the same to the charge of the innocent Queene.
            
            
               
                  Certain vehemēt presumptions with most cleare and euident proufs, that th' accusers of the Queene, namely the Earle of Murrey and certein other of the chief of his Confederats, were the deuisers, procurers, and some of them the very executioners of the murder of the Lord Darley.
               
               
               CAPVT. 3.
               AS the Earle of Murrey & his complices, could neuer to this daie by any threat, promisse of pardon, fauour and reward, or other practises (wherof it is knowen he vsed many) procure any one, not so muche as a condemned person, directly to charge or accuse ye Queene of consenting, or so muche as any foreknowledge of ye murder: so without any such practice, God hath of his iustice so appointed, that diuerse persons at sundry times & places haue voluntarily and of their owne knowledge constantly charged the Erle Murrey and other his confederates therwith.
               But before I come to that pointe, I will reduce to you in

some order, diuers other things that went before: which when you haue redde, and aduisedly considered the same, you shall (I doubt not) easily be induced to thinke, that those direct testimonies succeeding against Murrey and the rest of his confederats, were like inough to be true, & so are in dede founde to be, and daily more and more confirmed by Time the mother of Truth. It shal not be impertinent therfore in this place somewhat to note the causes, that moued the Earle of Murrey to seeke and procure ye death of the Lord Darley.
               The first and original cause was the greate and exceeding ambition, which appered wholy to possesse the lewd minde of the said Murrey, aspiring greedily to the Croune & gouernement

of that Realme: of which his inordinate ambition if any man doubt, let him first know, that he was so far blinded therwith, that he was not ashamed to make open and direct sute to the Queene in the time of her first widowhood, to intaile the Croune of Scotlande to him, (though he were illegitimate and vncapeable therof) & to the blood & name of the Stewards, dissuading her in all he might, from all maner of mariage. Which things are wel knowen to most of the Nobilitie of that Realme. But when he saw that deuise would not take place, for that the Queene being yong, & hauing no childe, desirouse (as was both natural & dutiful for the quiet of the Realm) to leaue an heire of her owne bodie to reigne after her, if so it should

please God, was determined to marche herself in mariage with the saied Lord Darley, beeing a goodly yong Prince, descended (as her selfe also was) of the Royall blood of the aunciente Kings bothe of Englande and Scotland, and next after herself & his mother, the next Heire in apparance to the Croune of England: Murrey seeing this matche to fall out very ill for his purpose, and the woorse, bycause such a yong and beautifull couple, were not like to be long without children, he firste determined and practised to haue killed both the said Lorde Darley and his Father, and to haue imprisoned the Queene in Loch
                     •
                  euen, and himselfe to vsurpe the regiment of the Realme, as synce hee did.

But the mariage being solēnised, before he could conueniently execute that his diuelish intente, and the same (as God would haue it) being disclosed: so greate was his malice and ambition, that not being 
                     •
                  able any longer to conteine or dissemble the same, he then brake forth into open rebelliō, shewing him selfe with his Cōplices in armes ageinst the Quene his Soueraigne & his most louing & bountiful sister, by whose liberalitie he might dispend well xxvi. thousand pounds by yere after the rate of their mony, and next vnto herselfe ruled & commaunded the whole Realme.
               And to winne the moo to his faction, tooke holde and occasion of the reuocacion shee had made of the Actes and Alienations (of things perteining to

ye Croune) made in her minoritie (which al Princes of Scotland may iustly doe, when, or before they come to the age of fiue and twentie yeares) pretēding that she meant to plucke from euery man al the possessions of the Church and Croune that he and the rest of the Nobilitie hadde gotten into their handes: whiche amounted to more then two partes of three, of the reuenues of the whole Churche and Croune of Scotland.
               But his forces beeing by her highnes loyal subiects sone broken, he fled into England, wher while he remained, he busily solicited and earnestly sued for aide against his Soueraigne.
               Yet during the time of his remaining there, twoo things did he finely cumpasse: the one

was his owne pardonne at the Quenes hands by the intreati
                     •
                   of suche friends as he found in England, ye other the murder of Dauid the Quenes Secretarie▪ wherof by his letters he gaue a plat 
                     •
                  o certaine of yt cōfederats yet liuing, & so earnestly solicited ye same, that it was executed in such horrible sort, as ye world knoweth, in ye Queenes owne presence, at what time shee being great with child, labouring all shee coulde by intreatie, to saue his life, had a charged pistolet bent against her, and was threatened, it shoulde be presently shorte of at her, if shee woulde not quiet her selfe. Whiche barbarouse facte vsed towards her, in the case shee was in, gaue vnto Murrey a speciall hope, that either shee, or her childe, or bothe, by that

sodaine fright and feare should perish and miscarie.
               This Secretare beeing thus dispatched, whose wisedome and fidelitie, was no small lette to their desig

                  retely disclosed it to so many, that it came at the last to Murreys eares.
               But he hauing a much more craftie head, then ye yong Lord Darley had, dissembling that he had any intelligence hereof, began then to hasten as muche as he could, the dispatche of the said Lord Darley, whereof he had be
                     •
                  ore laied the plat with his confederates, but chiefely

with ye Earle Bothwel, whome at his departure from the court towarde France (for the subtil fox to abuse the worlde would himselfe be out of the Realme when his deuises shoulde be executed) he had put in trust as his singular and moste especial and secrete friende, with th
                     •
                   whole order of that affaire, promising him (in rewarde of his paines to be taken in the dispatche of the Lorde Darley) his counsell and furtherance in all he coulde, to marie with the Queene: wherein the craftie Foxe foresawe and intended, as hath synce appeared, the distruction both of the Queene and him, and thereby an open way for himselfe to atteine the goale of the regiment of that Realme, which synce he hath vsurped.
               
                  Here you see a concurrence of two causes that mooued Murrey, to con
                     •
                  riue the murder of the Lord Darley. First, an ambitiouse hope, by taking him away, to atteine with muche more ease, the Croune, which was the marke he shot at: the other, a feare that he had to be himselfe murdered by the said Lord Darley, if he did not find some meane to preuent him.
               Now remaineth it to be proued, that as Murrey was moued by these apparant causes, to procure this murder: so in dede he was the procurer of the same.
               For proufe wherof: first it is to be knowen, that he to auoid  from himself the open suspicion & slaunder therof, departing frō the Courte about xvi. houres before the murder committed,

saied to the Lord Darris: This night, eare morning, the Lorde Darley shal lose his life. which woordes the said Lord Harris, being of suche honour and credit, as is well knowen, did 
                     •
                  t sundry times, auow openly to the Earle Murreys face, and is yet liuing ready to auow the same.
               
                  Secondly, Murrey before his departure out of Scotland for France, had contriued, yt his factiō shuld in his absense procure the acquital of Bothwel, 
                     •
                   after to marie with the innocē
                  
                     •
                   Queene. And diuers of the faction had by their owne hand
                     •
                   writing bounde them selues to obey and assist Bothwel against any that shoulde prosecute him for the murder committed.
               
                  Thirdly, the said Murrey b
                     •
                   his ernest sute obteined the returne

of some of his principall confederates, then banished into England for the slaughter of the Secretarie: without whose assistence, for their greate courage and witte to execute, his practises went but lamely forward.
               Fourthly, it is wel knowen, that the said Murrey, and other the confederates, had many secret meetings at the Castell of Cragmiller, about the contriuing and compassing of the said murder: at whiche place the same was fully concluded, as hath veu since confessed.
               Fiftly, the said Earle Murrey, nor any of the rest, would not geue to the Quene any admonition or knowledge, that yr Earle Bothwell was any dote in the death of her husband, til by the great sute, singuler commendation

of the saied Earle Bothwel, & other mischieuous practises mingled with pretensed humilitie and with couert terrour, they had persuaded and procured her Highnes to marie him.
               Then, when it was for her to late, and for them 
                     •
                  umpe in the nicke, they sodeinly with open mouth blased abrode and published, that the Earle Bothwel (forsooth) with whom the Queene had maried, was the principal murtherer of the Lord Darley, whose death it came now sodeinly vpon them, and much touched their honour (as they said) to see reuenged. And there vpon presently brake they foorth againe into armes against their Queene, whom
                     •
                   when vp seined submission and false promisses (as hath bene

shewed before) they had frandulently gotten into their handes, and vnnaturally cast into prison in Lochlenen (where the 
                     •
                  ewed mother and bastard brother of the said Murrey were dwelling): they litle then cared for pursuing or hurting the Earle Bothwell. For they permitted him to remaine there quietly in the Countrey certaine monethes after, and to passe safely whither he would, according to their former promisse made vnto him in their names by a Noble manne yet liuing: who, when he was sent from Edenborough to the Queenes Campe, to persuade her Maiestie, to laye armes aparte, and peaceably to enter Edenborough, as is before remembred, tooke the Earle Bothwell by the hande,

and drawing him aside, abussed him, to departe for a time, faithfully promising him, that no man should pursue or folow him.
               
                   Sixtly, Ihon Hepborne the Earle Bothwelles man (who with certaine others that had in deede bene presente at the murder, was executed, for a face of iustice, and to remoue suspicion from the principals) said and constantly affirmed at his death in the presence of fiue thousand persons and mo, that (as he should answere before God) the Earle Murrey, and certeine others, whom he then and there named, were the principals and chiefe procurers of the said murder, and that so the Earle Bothwell his Maister had often told him in secret. The same in effect was affirmed

by Ihon Hay of Tallow, Powrie, Dugglish and Parris at the time of their deathes, as hath bene shewed before.
               Lastly, there was a solemne Indenture Octopartite made and passed, betweene the said Earle Murrey and the reast of the Conspirators, of mutuall couenant and promisse vppon their faith and honour, vniformely to procede in their said cōfederacie: that which of them soeuer should first cumpasse opportunitie, should kill the said Lord Darley, and in al euents touching the same should iointly assist and defend eche other. Of which Indenture one part signed & sealed with the handes and seales of the Earle Murrey and the reast of the Conspirators, hath since come to the Queenes handes, and was

shewed to the English Commissioners.
               Now see how wonderfully God hath wrought herein. If suche vehement presumptions as are before remembred, could be slightly past ouer, as things that rather make likely, then cleerly proue true yt which is gathered therof: yet is it not to be mistrusted, but so many witnesses directly accusinge Murrey & his complices, at the houre of their death, Murreys foretelling the night when the Lord Darley shoulde be killed, the flatte and weightie testimonie of the Noble Lord Harris yet liuing, and lastly the Indenture of that traiterous conspiracie, signed and sealed with the knowen hand and seale of the Lord Murrey and his Confederates, will fully satisfie all

men ye haue their commō sense, and geue them matter inough cleerely to see, who were the procurers of that horrible murder, wherof the guiltie malefactours haue so vnnaturally slandered their good and guilelesse Queene.

               CAP. 4
               THis Lord Iames, bastard brother to ye Quene of Scotland, & by her natural goodnes aduanced

to the Earledome of Murrey, to possessious & liuelyhod of six and twentie thousand poundes by the yeare, to the whole gouernement and rule of the Realme next to her selfe (as hath bene shewed before) being yet pricked forward with an vngrate and ambitious minde, with the lewed inclination he drew by kinde out of his vnchast mother, and by the instigation of the Diuel
                     •
                  , that would not suffer him to go on in the Ecclesiastical and religious life, wherein he was once entred, and in some degrees professed, determined by one meane or other, to make him selfe King of that Realme.
               Toward the bringing of which his designment to effect, he first practised, to staye the Queene from mariage, and to

entaile the Croune to him & to the name of the Stewardes. Which deuise not succeeding to his fansie, he determined, to interrupt her mariage with the Lord Darley (whereof he saw her resolued) by procuring the murder both of him & the Earle of Lineux his father. But God preseruing them, the mariage was solennized & consummate.
               Then, seeing no waye so likely to aduaunce the desired successe of his wicked enterprise, as to deuise some meane, to breede debate and misliking betwene the Queene and her husband: he practised, to put into the head of the said Lord Darley a greate desire which he and others of the Nobilitie hadde, to see the Croune sette on his headde, for that they wisshed (said he) rather

to be gouerned by a man, then altogether by a woman, declaring vnto him, that many of them did meruaile, that there appeared in her so litle regard to his Lorship, as hauing worthely made him her husband, shee would yet so vnworthely suffer him to remaine in place of a subiect: or so litle magnanimitie in him, that giuing all other waies sufficient shew and testimonie of a noble courage, he could so meekely beare that dishonour, whereof yet he could not muche impute the fault to the Queene (who seemed in her very louing vse towards him otherwayes, to reuerence and regarde the Nobilitie of his Roial blood and excellent gifts of nature worthy in dede of any Monarchie) as to the enuious & spitefull secret working and

persuasion of Dauid her Secretarie, a craftie fellow, and as Murrey said, neither frind to his Lordship, nor to any of the Nobilitie.
               The yong Prince hearing this, and lacking in deede no courage or greatnes of minde, but some ripenes of iudgement (for want of yeares and experience) to discerne whereto this tale and deuise tended, beeing easily circumuented by this old craftie fox, and long practised traitour, gaue sone an inclining eare to this his smooth talke, whiche shewed outwardly, a greate estimation of the saied Lord Darleys person and vertue, with a louing desire of his aduancement.
               Wherfore to make short, this yong Lord hauing the same by diuers meanes inculcated into

his head, sometime by scorneful reproches vttered to him by the way of mirth, of his to base suffering such contempt, and somtime by subtil persuasions and earnest instigations of sundrie the Confederates: in the ende, the vnfortunate yong Lorde was brought first to vse strāgenes toward the Queene, and sone after to ioyne with yt Confederates that were wroughte by Murrey to become the butcherly murderers of this poore faithfull Secretarie, in whose bodie the saied Lorde Darleys owne dagger was founde sticking

                  mong a number of other deadly woundes, wherwith he was there miserably stabbed, in the very presence of the Quene his Maistres, being great with her first and onely childe, and

indeuouring herselfe by intreatie, and otherwise (as she was hable) to saue him, til by a charged Pistolet bent towars her (as was shewed before) shee was also put in fear of her life, and violently thrust, not into her owne priui

                  nterprise beeing thus farre 
                     •
                  duanted, hee thought (this stumbling blocke of the wise and faithfull Secretarie being remou
                     •
                  d, and therwithal so notable a cause of vnkindenesse cast betweene the Queene and the saied Lorde Darley) he needed not muche to doubte, but that he should wel find the meanes, shortly to bring to passe, that the saied

Lord Darley being now nusseled in blud, should be wrought for geine of the Croune (which seemed offred vnto him) to dispatche also the Queene her self, or at the least, to geue his consent to the destroiyng of her.
               But God otherwise disposed. For this Noble yong Gentleman, by the secrete instinct of nature, and of Princely minde he drew with the Royal blood of his Noble Mother, beganne euen foorthwith to repent, and to abhorre the foule fact he had committed. And there vppon finding his own fault, and sou ashamed thereof, he presently entred into the chamber, wher
                     •
                   the desolate Queene kneeled in feare of her life, moorning his ingratitude, with the losse of her old faithful seruant the Secretarie, and in humble and

moste feruente praier to God, to defend and preserue her and the infant in her wombe, from the cruell handes of those traitours, whose bloudy daggers she looked presently to feele also in her owne bodie.
               When he, being touched with remorse and with the grace of God (obteined, as it may wel be thought, with the pearcing praier & abundant teares there poured foorth by that good and vertuous Ladie) entred into the chamber: he presently fell doune on his knees before her Highnes, asking mercie and pardon for the great errours he had committed, with sufficient shew, yt he was now hartily sorie therefore, & gaue very faithfull assurance, that he woulde from thencefoorth, vnfeinedly be to her Highnes such, as dutie

and her exceeding kindenes and demerits toward him had iustly bound him.
               To make shorte, the good Queene, seeing this notable chaunge so sodainly to happen somewhat beyond her expectation: first most humbly thanked God (whome shee saw to bee the onely Author thereof) then louingly imbracing her sorowful husband, shee not onely pardoned sweetly all his former vnkindenesse, and grieuouse offences committed against her: but seeing (better then he did) the present daunger wherein they bothe stoode, shee foorthwith by her excellente wisedome deuised and put in execution suche politik
                     •
                   meane, as wherewith shee saued that nighte both him and her selfe by escaping away in

disguised apparrel.
               The Earle of Murrey seeing then (contrarie to his hope) this reconciliation betweene the Queene and the Lorde Darley: imagined, as it followed, that all his traiterouse practises woulde be discouered to the Queene, and resolued with him selfe, that now there remained no way for his owne safetie, and to aduaunce the desired ende of his traiterous purpose, but to make shorte woorke, and to gette the saied Lorde Darley to be dispatched out of the waie. And that being done, he doubted not, by one deuise or an other, to make a hande also with the desolate Quene, or at the least to get her by some good coulor deposed, & himself placed in the Roial seate & gouernemēt of that Realme.
               
                  This mischeuous denise how he compassed & atcheued euen to his minde, the world hath seene, and the processe of this discourse hath before opened. I wil therefore (desiring herein to be as short as I may) forbeare the repeating thereof againe in this place, and proceede to the nexte Acte of this Tragedie.
               Yet one thing farther may I not omitte to shew, what faith and fidelitie was in this Traitor Murrey: who seemed now to haue cast away al shame, al regard, not onely to God and his Prince, but also of his own honour, fame and credit. For after all things brought to the termes you see, euen as he would haue it: yet could he not by any meanes brynge these thinges to suche passe, but that

diuers yet of the principal Nobilitie of Scotland fauored the Queene, & remained her faithfull and loyall subiectes, soliciting daily by all meanes they could (for by force they were not hable) to compound these greate garboiles and troubles, and to procure by some treatie, the deliuery and reducing of their Queene, whome bysides their duetie of allegeance, they singulerly loued and honoured for her liberalitie, clemencie, wisedome, and other singuler vertues.
               They hauing therefore with earnest solicitation procured, that Murrey was at the last contente to come to a parlee with them, and to geue them safe conduct (which he did, with such other assurance by promise confirmed by oth and writing,

of free passing and repassing with safetie, as they thought sufficient, and so might, if there had ben leaft in him any honor, honestie, feare of God, or shame of the world) behold, euen in the midst of their talke and conference aboute pacification of their great troubles, he caused violent handes to be sodainely laied on the Duke of Chastleroy, the moste Noble and principall Peere of that Realme: and on that graue, stoute, aud faithfull Noble man the Lorde Harris,
                     In Cronograp. Pontaci Burdeg.
                   and cast them bothe into close and straight prison, contrarie to his promise, faith, safe conduct, and assurance geuen vnto them.
               What Turke would so haue vsed himselfe? How euidently did this part shew, that he was rather of a Punike, then of a

Christian
                     •
                   faith? Howe truely saith the wiseman;

               This bastard Earle hauing now by these blouddy & faithlesse steps atteined to yt absolute regiment of ye Realme of Scotland, by the murder of Dauid the Secretarie, of that goodly yong Prince the Lord Darley,

               He therefore casting doune

from his high heauēly Throne a pitiful eye, and enclining his mercifull eare to the 
                     •
                  uefull lamentations of this wofull, innocent, and desolate Ladie criyng to him daie and nighte for some comfort & redresse of these so many & so intolerable wrōgs done vnto her, did first of his Diuine mercie and compassion miraculousely deliuer this pretiouse Iewell, this Noble and innocent Quene, out of ye strongest prison of Scotlād, throughly furnished with numbers of souldiers, enuironned with large deepe waters, and garded by the very brother of this traitour Murrey, with the assistence and lewd aduise of their dishonest mother.
               This beeing done by Gods woonderfull prouidence, the Queene tendering not so much

the recouerie of her Croune, as her honour and fame, by that wretched Murrey & his Complices so shamefully touched, and vniustly impaired with many, that knew no more o

                     •
                   but to get this soule matter indifferently

examined, the truth to be boulted out, and thereby her innocencie made cleere to the world, by the iust reuenge that the Noble menne of that Realme, assisted with her owne loyall subiectes in Scotlande, would take vpon those her rebels and most vnnaturall murderers of her deere husband.
               But when her Highnesse comming with this honorable intent, was by Gods guiding safely arriued in England: behold, she being at her first landing gētly receiued, was (alas) soone after apprehended, and after a sorte, cast there againe into prison. So greate was the solicitation of her Aduersaries, and so great an impression had the slaunderous bruits and traiterous practises of the said Murrey and his friendes

made there in the mindes not onely of the Noble men, but almost 
                     •

               Howbeit God that knew the secrets of al, after this notorious shewe of his merciful compassion by the miraculouse deliuerie of this innocent Ladie out of the handes of her greatest ennemies, that intended her death, into a more mild prison, where shee was safe from suche blooddy attemptes (whiche shee did with reason fearefully expecte in the other euery houre) permitted Satan sone after to paie certaine the principal instruments and aduācers of this his seruice with their due deserued hire. For first he suffered a spirit of phrenesie to enter into ye person of that Noble yong Prince the Earle of Arrane eldest sonne to the Duke of Chastleroy: which

Erle of Arrane being in Frāce of great estimatiō for his goodly person, wit, courage, and nobilitie, and hauing there great charge, credit, and very honourable interteinement, was by this traitour Murrey, and an Embassador then liggier there (whom I wil forbear to name) so finely practised with (being promised, y• if he would ioyne with Murrey in these attēpts, he should haue in England & Scotland dubble the interteinment he h

repaired into Scotland, and sone after into England. But finding in time, that things fel not out to the answering of his hope, and that he failed both of the wife and double interteinment that was promised him: he fel byside him selfe, or rather starke mad, and so lyuing certaine yeares, at the last he died in plaine Lunasie, and in very miserable case.
               An other great man yet liuing, a principall member of this conspiracie, is displaced of the regimēt (which, next Murrey, he looked for) by such as h

And with the blow falling presently from his horse, sone after hee gaue vp his sinfull ghoste amidde his tyrannical gouernment of that Realme in al causes both spirituall and temporal, whervnto he was climmed by suche meanes, as ye haue heard before.

               tard Earle, and are yet by other corrupt & indirect meanes

induced to persist and continue in the maintenance and defence of the same: to you I wil now be hold for a few wordes to direct my speache.
            If the iust consideration of the subtill persuasions and deceitfull pretenses made vnto you from time to time by the said Earle Murrey, who neuer opened vnto you the fine, end, nor marke of his traiterouse ambitiouse minde, that aspired to vsurpe the Croune of that Realme, as more then manifestly appeared before he died: if those false guiles, I saie, now so euident in al your eies, suffise not to resolue you of the vnlefulnes of your procedings past in prosecuting of this enterprise, and now at length to desist therefro: yet let the iust end and the sodaine feareful fal of

that Earle, in the middest and height of his pride, be vnto you al a spectacle and an example of Gods terrible iustice, and righteous reuenge, that neuer faileth at one time or other to fall vpon the Authors and woorkers of so horrible and monstruouse attemptes, how long soeuer they bee sometimes differred and delayed.
            Consider (I beseeche you) more aduisedly then you haue done, the very nature and qualitie of these your actions and attempts: and way how farre they passe the limites of all honour in your selues, howe they exceede the boundes of all duetie to God, to your Prince, and to your Countrey, & how they surmount the cumpasse of al reason, ciuilitie, and humaine nature in the iudgement of the

whole worlde.
            And when you haue considerately bethought your s
                  •
               lues vppon these your errors, and haue seene howe meruelousely you haue bene abused by that false Traitour, first to enter, and since to walke and wade forwarde in that lothesome and odiouse bypath of vndutifull disobedience, and vnnaturall treasons: you are not (I trust) so vtterly gracelesse, nor so deepely drowned in the dongeon of vnsensible darkenesse, but that some remorse you shal feele, and motions of repentance, for your so great ouersightes both toward God and your Prince. And let your passed experience of your traueile and turmo
                  •
               le so many yeares continued, teache and

assure you, that the farder you proceede in this vile course, the more shal you still finde of that, which you haue hitherto founde. That is to saie, that bothe your selues, and your whole naturall Countrey, by this your fault, shal sinke daily deeper and deeper, as it were, into a bottomlesse Gogmyre of infamouse calamities to horrible to bee heard of.
            Out of which to raise and recouer your selues and your Countrey, there is none other waie leaft you, but againe to vntwist the threde, that your selues haue holpen to spinne, beginning firste with vnteined contrition, and calling to God for mercie and forgeuenes for these your greate outrages, and acknoweledging withall,

(as the truth is in deede) that synce you first fel from him, and forsooke the true faith of your noble Progenitors (which for fleshly libertie and couetousnes of the Church goods you first abandoned) that by this spirituall blindnes wilfully imbraced, you had neuer synce ye grace to esteeme Ciuil iustice, nor to obserue the common obedience that al subiects, both Christian, and Ethnical are borne in, and bound vnto.
            And secondly, with al humilitie and faithfull meaning, to confesse your errours & faultes vnto the Queenes Maiestie your Soueraigne, and to craue for the same her gratious pardon, with promise and performance, by your faithfull vttermoste seruice in her obedience, euen to the shedding of your

bloods at her commaundemēt, to redubbe and acquite to your powers, your offences past. And if any respect of pride, wilfulnesse, corruption by reward, or vnlauful oth or promise shal withholde you yet any longer from the same, bysides yt ruine that you see your Countrey suffereth, the weakening and consumption of your Nobilitie & people, the lying waste and vnoccupying of your natural soil, the extinguishment of iustice, & the vnbrideled educatiō of your youth in al vnleful libertie and mischiefe: bysides all these (I saie) beholde with what eyes the whole world abrode, Christen and Heathen, must looke vpon you: vpon your selues, I saie, y• are the contriuers thereof, & what the present tongues and pennes of all sortes of men

must saie of the same.
            
                Is there any one of your selues (admitte that he be willingly blind) yet so vnsensible, that he palpably feeleth not the inextricable Labyrinth & confusion, into whiche your selues are entered, and haue led your whole Nation after you.
            
                Hath any of you so farre stripped your selues from the nature of man, that you feele nothing of the slaughter and murder of so many of your Countrimen, seruants, friends, & kinsfolke, as in these v. yeares haue perished emong you?
            
                Can any of you denie, but that since your renouncing of your dutifull obedience vnto your iu
                  ••
                Soueraigne, in which you were borne (neither with so many blooddy battailes as haue since bene fought for the

same, neither with so many friendly treaties and amicable meetings, as emong your selues haue bene made for ending of this controuersie, neither yet with any counsel or authoritie foreine or domestical) you could neuer yet reduce your selues to accorde vpon any other Prince or fourme of Regimente, that could continue six moneths together, without beeing dissolued by some of your selues that were parties vnto it?
            Is there any emong you so  voide of honour, so destitute of ciuilitie, or growen so barbarouse, that he feeleth no shame of the Moorish vnfaithfulnes, & daily violation of euery mans promise & faith geuen to other, euen emong your selues, so farforth, that therby in effect is taken away al mutual comforte,

that mans nature taketh in conuersing friendly one with another?
            
                Is al natural loue so extincted in you, that you feele no paine of the many incursions and foreine forces, of the burnings, wastes and slaughters, that by the handes of your pretended friendes (Enemies in dede) haue ben of late committed emong you?
            
               Or is there no sparke of wisedome or common reason left in you, that might shew you, what must be ye ineuitable end of this intestine dissension & ciuil discord emong your selues: wherin whosoeuer winneth, onely Scottish blood is shed, and the Realme of Scotland looseth, to ye final extirpatiō of your selues and your Families for euer?
            If none of all these doe yet

suffise, to persuade you to retire in time from these your insolencies: then behold, I beseech you, how manifestly to the eies of al the world the wisedome of God confoundeth your practises, and his merciful prouidēce conuinceth your follie. For, see you not, that euen now amids these your vnlauful labors to renoūce your obedience, & whiles you the natural subiects of her Maiestie haue done your vttermost, and yet doe stil turmoile (without pretense of iust cause) to depose and depriue your vndoubted Soueraign, euē now, I saie, whiles you are warmest in working of this, behold, the Royal Nobilitie and people of England, in nūber farre aboue you, and your equalles at least (in euery degree) bothe in liuing, in parentage, and in al

other gifts of God and of nature, and (who might in comparison of you be accōpted but as strangers or enemies to her Maiestie your Soueraigne) do with one vniforme mind adore & imbrace her, and with al due deuotion accompt her for their Quene in succession, when God shal so dispose.
            Close therefore no longer your eies so obstinately against Gods wonderful worke. You plainely see, that whome you would spot and defame, God wil haue cleared and shewed to be guiltlesse: whome you with armed forces did imprison and restraine, God set at libertie without any other hande or meane, then of her owne wisedome & policie: & whome you her subiectes & vassalles would dispossesse of a meaner kingdome,

vnto whiche shee was borne, God wil haue aduanced by strangers to a farre greater and more ample Dominion.
            If this much you see not, behold then the blindnes of heart you are entred into, and see the plaine reprobate sense, vnto which ye iustice of God hath deliuered you ouer: & if you see it, and wil yet persist in it, though Gods grace faile you, let yet

               he vaine fame of the world and the idle reputation of menne, somwhat moue you. Suffer not your selues from mē to be changed into vnreasonable beastes, and to bee accompted sauage and wilde, woodde or starke mad, as al they are, that being once vnwares stepte ouer the shooes in an vnsauery place, wil yet ronne headlong forewarde, til he sinke in the same

ouer headde and cares, rather then he 
                  〈◊〉
                in time retire, and clense his shoe againe.
            It is humaine to fall and to erre, but it is diuelish to persist and continue. It is no shame to returne from euill, but the shame is to defend euil, & wilfully to rest therein. You haue forsoth examples inough, that inuincibly do proue, that there is no time past for your recouerie, if you wil. For many are there yet liuing emong you, that once were parties with you, whome Gods grace and their owne honours and wisedoms haue brought to see their error, and to refourme ye same: whereby they are euery waie restored both to their Princes fauour, and to their owne reputation in the iudgement of al men. Feare not therefore, nor

forbeare not any longer to follow their example, and to take that safe waie, that they haue troden before you, which is safe and assured for your selues presently, for your families & successions to come, and for your soules eternally.
            If you thinke the weight of your crimes to bee more heinous, then can easily be pardoned: behold your Soueraignes clemencie, that singularly shineth emong and aboue al other her princely vertues, wherwith she is abundantly adorned. I nede not in this to spend many woordes, the examples thereof are so many, so fresh, and so sufficiently testified by the experience of many of your selues, vpon whome she hath exercised and put in vre the lesson of the Gospel,
                  Matt. 18. that teacheth none end

to bee of forgeuing offenders, that doe in time duely seeke it.
            Neither are you ignorant, that of herself she is both grateful of nature, and wise in policie: by both which shee must of necessitie be induced, both hartily to forgiue them that nowe hartily turne vnto her, and to see that the state of her Realme, and of her owne person also are presently suche, that as it were in dede no policie for her to doe otherwise, so may your fidelities and seruices now stand hee in such steade, as may iustly deserue the pardon you craue, and bind her in honour to remember them for euer.
            If Gods holy woord (which you pretend to adore) do manifestly threatē a terrible reuenge to them that greue and oppresse the widdow or orphane (wer

they the poorest that may go on the grounde): And if the state and dignitie of Gods annointed be so sacred in his sight, that he forbiddeth the same once to be 
                  •
               ouched: shal these your insolencies then against your Soueraigne in her desolate widdowhood escape vnpunnished, she being

               ch a Queene, as for whom it semeth that euen from her birth not Scotland alone, but England, France, and Ireland to haue seemed to contend which of them should haue her for their Gouernesse & Queene: yea, whome God himself (foreknowing by his Diuine prescience, what a Paragon of vertue she should proue) seemeth verily to haue appointed to bee Queene in time of all sower Realmes.
            Finally beholde, what hath

bene the euent and successe of al such seditious conspiracies in all times and ages before your daies. Peruse ye Histories both of your owne, and of all other Countries. And if you litle esteeme the memorie of things farre past, behold the experience of these present daies. Loke into all Countries and Nations neare adioyning vnto you, and you shal find, that none of them hath escaped from rebellion & intestine sedition within ye time of your owne memories, nor that yet they are cleerly deliuered of the dregges of the same. And what hath (I praie you) ensued theron? They haue kept in dede a great stur for a time, but what haue the Authors and mouers gained thereby, other then their owne vtter ruine & infamie for euer? And what is

become of that they haue striued for? When they haue long contended mutually emonge them selues, and when ech hath spilled much of others blood, and many an honest man dead in the quarrell: the matter for the moste parte remaineth as it was, and litle or nothing bring they to passe of the huge alterations that thei attempt, nor neuer shal, therof assure you.
            For the Maiestie of God that is euer one and the same, neuer prospereth ye vnlauful attempts of Subiects against their Princes, enterprised by priuate authoritie. Let Machiauel saie what he list, & beleeue him who wil: ye that are his disciples, to your owne perditions you shal find the ende as I tel you. For bysides that Diuine authoritie so promiseth it, and worldly experience

so teacheth it, very reason also sheweth, that it can be none otherwise. For where the foundation is faultie & hollow, the more weight that is heaped and builded theron, the soner it bringeth the whole to ye groūd. And what hath ben the foundation of al these your garboiles, oth your selues do know, the world seeth, and I haue briefly told you, as this place wil permitte. Whervpon to build and heape on, any more of y• kind of stuffe, you shal

fast to approche by meane of these vprores and sturres, already doe, and daily will waxe weary thereof, detest the cause, and geue you ouer in the plaine field: and so would haue done (no doubte) eare this, if the swete taste of forcine rewardes had not holden them more, then any deuotion they haue now to you or your cause.
            If stil you depend and hope vpon other Princes assistence: that wil but deceiue you. For as it is not vnknow

in deede of their priuate practises, that neither long shal nede your ministerie therin, nor shal not for euer be hable to susteine you in the same, but shall and wil, care it be long, euen for their owne better policie also, ioyntly with al other Princes abrode, abhorre and detest the perilous president, that herein you giue to the great multitude that are subiectes borne euery where.
            And albeit some of them doe for the time serue themselues of you: yet doubt you nothing of it, but that euen they that so do, see well inough, knowe right wel, and iudge both you and your doings to be as they are, and wil no longer spot and distaine their Princely personages and honourable vocations with the maintenance of so dishonorable

attemptes, and of so daungerouse examples to all Monarks and Kings: no longer, I saie, then whiles of mere necessitie, they shal thinke them selues thereto constrained by their own policie, but shal then leaue you in the middest, and let you go as you are, to your own perpetual infamies, and to the rasing and extirpation of your names and succession for euer, if you doe not reuoke your selues, and retire in time: which that you may doe, God of his mercie graunt you the grace, &c.
