                  And that shall serue as long as inuention lastes,
                  there dreames they relate, as spoke from Oracles,
                  or if the gods should hold a synod, and make them their secritaries,
                  they will diuine and prophecie too: but come and speake your
                  

                     
thoughts of the intended marriage with the Spanish Prince,
                  He is come you see, and brauely entertainde.

                  Hee is so, but not married yet.

                  But like to be, and shall haue in dowry with the Princesse this Kingdome of Cycele.

                  Soft and faire, there is more will forbid the baines, then say amen to the marriage: though the King vsurped the Kingdome, during the non-age of the Prince Phylaster, hee must not thinke to bereaue him of it quite; hee is now come to yeares to claime the Crowne.

                  I grant it, that the King knowes too well,
                  And makes this Contract to make his faction strong:
                  Whats a giddy-headed multitude,
                  That's not Disciplinde nor trainde vp in Armes,
                  To be trusted vnto? No, he that will
                  Bandy for a Monarchie, must prouide
                  Braue marshall troopes with resolution armde,
                  To stand the shock of bloudy doubtfull warre,
                  Not danted though disastrous Fate doth frowne,
                  And spit all spightfull fury in their face:
                  Defying horror in her vgliest forme,
                  And growes more valiant, the more danger threats;
                  Or let leane famine her affliction send,
                  Whose pining plagues a second hel doth bring,
                  Thei'le hold their courage in her height of spleene,
                  Till valour win plenty to supply them,
                  What thinke ye, would yer feast-hunting Citizens
                  Indure this?

                  No sir, a faire march a mile out of town that their wiues may bring them their dinners, is the hottest seruice that they are trained vp to.
               
               
                  
                  CLE.
                  I could wish their experience answered their loues,
                  Then should the much too much wrongd Phylaster,
                  
                  Possesse his right in spight of Don and the diuell.

                  And so is mine,
                  And so should all that loues their true borne Prince,
                  Then let vs ioyne our Forces with our mindes,
                  In whats our power to right this wronged Lord,
                  And watch aduantage as best may fit the time
                  To stir the murmuring people vp,
                  Who is already possest with his wrongs,
                  And easily would in rebellion rise,
                  Which full well the King doth both know and feare,
                  But first our seruice wee'le proffer to the Prince,
                  And set our proiects as he accepts ofvs;
                  But husht, the King is comming.

                  Not, gentle boy, tis more then time thou didst attend the Princesse.
               
               
                  
                  BOY.
                  I am gone, but since I am to part with you my Lord, and none knowes whether I shall liue to doe more seruice for you, take this little prayer: Heauen blesse your loues, your sighes, all your designes, may sick men if they haue your wish, be well, and heauens hate those you curse, though I be one.

                  The loue of boyes vnto their Lords is strange, I haue read wonders ofit: yet this boy for my sake, if a man may iudge by looks and speech, would out doe story. I must see a day to pay him for his loyaltie.

                  Come this way, I know the Queene imployes vm not,
                  For the reuerend mother sent me word,
                  They would all be for the garden: if they should all
                  Proue honest now, I were in a faire taking:
                  I was neuer so long without sport before in my life,
                  And in my conscience tis not my fault.

                  No sir, I do not mean to purge you, though I meane to purge a little time on you.

                  If there be but two such in this Kingdome more, and neere the Court, we may ene hang vp our harpes, ten such Campher Constitutions as this would call the golden age againe in question, and teach the old way for euery ill fast husband, to get his owne children, and what a mischiefe that would breed, let all consider.

                  Sir, they stand right, and my lips are yet euen smooth,
                  Young enough, ripe enough, and red enough,
                  Or my glasse wrongs me.
               
               
                  PHA.
                  O they are two twend Cherries dyde in blush,
                  Which those faire sunnes aboue with their deepe beams
                  Reflect vpon, and ripen, sweetest beauty;
                  Bow downe those branches, that the longing taste
                  Of the sweete looker on, may meete these blessings,
                  And taste and liue.

                  O delicate sweete Prince, shee that hath snow enough about her heart, to take the wanton spring of ten such lynes, it may bee a number without Probatum. Sir, you haue by such neate Poetrie gathered a kisse, that if I had but fiue lines of that number, such pretie begging blankes: I should commend your forehead, or your cheekes, and kisse you too.

                  I'le teach you in a short sentence,
                  Cause I will not load your memory,
                  This is all: Loue me and lie with me.

                  Was it lie with you, that you said, tis impossible.
               
               
                  PHA.
                  Not to a willing minde, that wil endeauour,
                  If I doe not teach you to doe it as easily in one night,
                  As you'le go to bed: I'le lose my royall bloud for't.

                  PHA.
                  I'le sooner teach a mare the old measures,
                  Then teach her any thing belonging to the function,
                  Shee's affraid to lie with her selfe,
                  If she haue but my mascaline imagination about her,
                  I know when we are married, I must rauish her.
               
               
                  ME.
                  By my honour thats a foule fault indeed,

                  I hold her wit, the strength of all the guard

                  To your bed, ifyou mistrust my faith, you doe me the most vnnoblest wrong.

but lying downe and winking, answers more direct, I could not get from them, in short sir, shee's not there.

                  Thou, or another villaine with thy lookes,
                  Might take me out ofit, and send me naked,
                  My haire desheueld, through the fiery streetes.
               
               Enter.

                  Madame, the king would hunt,
                  And cals for you with earnestnesse.
               
               
                  PRIN.
                  I am in tune to hunt: Diana if thou canst
                  Rage with a maid, as with a man, let me discouer thee
                  bathing, and turne me to a fearefull hind,
                  That I may die pursu'd by cruell hounds,
                  And haue my story written in my wounds.

                  KING.
                  What, are the hounds before, and all the Woodmen?
                  

                     
Our horses ready, and our bowes bent?

                  All sir.
               
               
                  KING.
                  You are clowdy sir. Come we haue forgotten your veniall trespasses, let not that sit heauy vpon your spirit,
                  Heres none dares vtter it.
               
               
                  LEON.
                  He lookes like an olde surfeited stallion after his leaping, Dull as a Dormouse: see how he sinckes, the wench has shot him betweene wind and water, and I hope sprung a lake.

                  He needes no teaching, he strikes sure enough,
                  His greatest fault is, he hunts too much in the purlewes,
                  Would he would leaue off poaching.
               
               
                  TRA.
                  And for his horne, has left it at the lodge where he lay late: Oh hee's a pernitious limhound, turne him vpon the pursue of any Lady, and if hee lose her, hang him vp i'th slip: when my foxe bith bewty growes prowd, I'le borrow him.

                  You did command sir, and I obeyed you.
               
               
                  KING.

                  LEON.
                  I'st possible this fellow should repent,
                  Me thinkes that were not noble in him,
                  And yet he lookes like a mortified member,
                  As if he had a sicke mans salue in's mouth,
                  If a worse man had done this fault now,
                  Some physicall Iustice or other, would presently
                  Without the helpe of an Almanacke,
                  Haue opened the obstructions of his liuer,
                  And let him bloud with a dog-whip.

                  See, see, how modestly yon Lady lookes,
                  As if she came from churching with her neighbours,
                  Why what a diuell can you see in her face,
                  But that shee's honest.
               
               
                  CLE.
                  Faith no great matter to speake of: a foolish twinckling with the eie, that spoyles her coat, but hee must be a cunning Herald that findes it.
               
               
                  TRA.
                  See how they muster on another, O thers a ranke regient, where the diuell carries the Culours, and his damn'd drum maior. Now the flesh and the world come behinde with the Carriage.

                  Sure this Lady has a good turne done against her wil, before she was common talke, now none dares say Cantharides can stirre her, her face lookes like a warrant, willing and commanding all tongues, as they will answere it, to be tied vp, and boulted, when this Lady meanes to let her selfe loose, as I liue, shee has got a goodly protection, and a gratious: and may vse her body discretely, for her health sake, once a weeke, except lent and dog-dayes. O if they were to be got for money, what a large summe would come out of the Citie, for these Licences.

                  I neuer lou'd his beyond-sea-shippe, since he forsooke the Say, for paying ten shillings: he was there at the fall of a Deare, and would needes out ofhis Mightinesse, giue ten groates for the docets; mary his steward would haue the villuet head into the bargaine, to turfe his hat withall, I thinke he should loue venery: he and old Sir Tristrum: for ifye be remembred, hee forsooke a Stagge once, to strike a rascall milking in a meddow, and her hee kild i'the eye.

                  That's a good wench, an shee would not chide vs for tumbling of her women in the brakes, she's liberal, and by the gods, they say honest, and whether that be a fault or no, I haue nothing to do, there's all.

                  A golden stocke, and with it shakes downe bridges,

The noblest of the mountaines where they grew, straightest and tallest, vnder whose still shades, the worthier beasts haue made their layers, and slept free from the firuer of the Serian starre, and the fell thunder-stroke, free from the Clouds, when they were big with humour, and deliuer in thousand spouts, that issues to the earth: O there was none but silent quiet there, till neuer-pleased fortune shot vp shrubs base vnder branches, to deuour these branches, and for a while they did so, and did raigne ouer the Mountaine, and did choake vp his beauty with brakes, rud, thornes and thistles, till the Sunne scorcht them to the roote, and dride vm there, and now a gentle gaile has blowne againe, that made these branches meete and twine together, neuer to be vnarmde: The god that sings his Number ore marriage beds, has knit their noble hearts, and heere they stand, your children, worthy king, and I haue done.

Call in the Captaine of the Citadell, where you shall keepe your wedding, I'le prouide a maske shall make your Hymen turne his saffron into a sullen coate, and sing sad requiems to your departing soules, blood shal put out your torches, and insteed of gawdy flowers about your wanton necks, an Axe shall hang, like a prodigious Metour, ready to crop your loues sweetes. Heare you gods: From this time do I shake all title off of father to this woman, this base woman, and what there is of vengein a Lyon chaft amongst dogs, or rob'd of his deere young, the same inforc't more terrible, more mighty, looke from me.

                  Perswade you to loue this Lady, if you haue a soule.
