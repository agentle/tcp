               THe egles byrde hath spred his wings
               And from far of, hathe taken flyght
               In whiche meane way by no leurings
               On bough or braunch this birde wold light
               Till on the rose, both red and whight
               He lighteth now, moste louinglie
               And therto moste behouinglie.
            
            
               The monthe ensuing next to Iune
               This birde, this floure for perche doth take
               Reioysinglie him selfe to prune
               He rousith, rypelie to awake
               Upon this perche to chose his make
               Concluding strayght for rype right rest
               In the lions boure, to bilde his nest
            
            
               A birde, a beast to make to choose
               Namelie the beaste most furious
               It may seeme straunge, and so it doose
               And to this birde iniurious
               It semthe a case right curious
               To make construction in suche sens
               As may stande for this birds defens
            
            
               But marke▪ this lion so by name
               Is properlie a lambe tassyne
               No lion wilde, a lion tame
               No rampant lion masculyne
               The lamblike lion feminyne
               Whose milde meeke propertie aleurth
               This birde to light, and him asseurth
            
            
               The egles birde, the egles eyre
               All other birds far surmounting
               The crounid lion, matcheth feyre
               Croune vnto croune, this birde dothe bring
               A queenelie queene, a kinglie king
               Thus, lyke to lyke here matched is
               What matche may match more mete thē this
            
            
               So meete a matche in parentage
               So meete a matche in dignite
               So meete a matche in patronage,
               So meete matche in benignite,
               So macht from all malignite

               Seelde hathe ben seene, thus sayth the fame
