                  LONDON: Printed by Tho. Snodham, for Thomas Man, dwelling in Pater-noster Row at the signe of the Talbot.
               
               
                  
                  
                  TO THE RIGHT Worshipfull and worthy Knights, Sir Iohn Bois Recorder of the Citie of Canterbury, Sir Edward Bois the Elder, two of his Maiesties Iustices of Peace in the Countie of Kent, to Sir Edward Bois the younger, and to their three religious and vertuous Ladies: T. W. wisheth encrease of all happinesse, present and to come.
                  
                     OFten haue I desired some oportunitie of testifying thankfulnesse to you. I haue had many comforts for my body and mind from you. Golde and Siluer haue I none, neither doe I lacke any; and had I, it is a requitall which you need not, nor doe looke after: For God hath well blest your Familie and whole stocke as with the note and credit of Religion, so with encrease both of persons and wealth aboue any (for the number and qualitie) that I know in these parts; but such as I haue I doe giue you. Which is such, as you doe valew aboue all gold and siluer, being the sauing Truth, euen that truth which bringeth to life them that beleeue and practise it. Being therefore mooued vpon some respects to publish an Epitome or

                     Abridgement of all my doctrines which I euer taught in sixe principles, I thought withal by this occasion to dedicate to you these two short Sermons: One the Practise of the Saints, preached at the Funerall of your kinsewoman Mistres Francis Perker: the other, the Perseuerance of the Saints, first copied out at the earnest request of one of your kinsmen; and therunto haue ioyned two short Treatises of the Sacrament of the Supper; one touching the doctrine thereof, the other touching the dutie of Communicants; the one informing the iudgement in the truth of that Mysterie; the second working the affections to a reuerend loue and regard, and to a carefull vse of it. Accept them as poore loue-tokens, pardon my presumption in presenting them vnto the world vnder your names; vse them to your best benefit; and he, whose truth it is, write it in your hearts to your eternall good.
                  
                     Your Kins-man T. W.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                  TO ALL HIS CHRISTIan Friends in the East-part of the Countie of Kent; namely, to them of the Citie of Canterbury, and therein more especially to the Parishioners of Saint Georges, T. W. wisheth the knowledge and grace of Christ our Lord to be increased.
                  
                     THough the Sea doe not more ouerflow with water, than this age doth with Bookes, so as to bring forth more, it were, as if one would cast water into the Sea, or (as wee say) to light a candle at noone day to helpe the light of the Sunne: the light and Sun of the truth already being so bright and so resplendent by such writings as be already extant, as there is little hope of bringing any more cleernesse to it, especially by my most dimme candle: yet I had some reasons to moue me to set it (such as it is) vpon the table, not onely by preaching now many yeares, but by this simple writing. First, my doctrine hath beene calumniated and charged by some to be erronious, and by others to be humerous; for the quitting of this I haue sent these few Papers abroad to speak for me, comprehending an Epitome and summe of all which I haue deliuered in my publike Teaching. I haue taught nothing at any time, which for the substance of the matter, is not contained in my sixe principles: if there be in them errour or schisme, then I am culpable: if all here be sound and Orthodox, let men content themselues to blame the weaknesse of my teaching, but not the vnsoundnesse of my doctrine. I may erre in some particulars, for who is now priuiledged from errours, that is but a meere man (at Haereticus esse nolo,) I will be no Heretick
                        •
                      if it be declared, to me it

shall be disclaimed. Secondly, such as haue beene my hearers, hauing let slip many things taught (our memories being like siues or broken pitchers) it cannot well chuse, but much is slid from them, yet by this short abridgement, they shall be holpen to remember much of that which before they had heard in the enlarging of these matters Lastly, albeit others haue set forth these very things more distinctly & soundly, (for to do it more learnedly it is very easie) yet happely these things may come to some hands into which the other shall not come, and serue as a mark in their way to direct them to their country, and as halfe a loafe in stead of an whole, somewhat to refresh them in their iourney. Now to you I offer these things, how mean and homely soeuer (as they are indeed very course & meane, though not in respect of the substance of food brought you in them, for it is Gods truth; yet for the cooking & dressing of them) both because you haue long afforded me your presence in hearing, and oblieged me vnto you with many and great kindnesses, and for some poore recompence thereof, as also to leaue with you a remembrance of that truth which was more fully opened, I betake these things to your good curtesie and vse: hoping, as some of you were pleased to be pleased with them when they were spoken to your eares, now comming to your eyes to be read, they may proue gratefull, and through Gods blessing proue fruitfull too: Fare ye well.

                  Question.

                     Interpretation of the vvords. 
                     What is meant by Beginnings?
                  
                  
                     An. The Catechism
                        •
                     , or catechising instruction, or the doctrine of Christ deliuered in a plain and familiar manner.
                  Qu. Why is this familiar Catechising doctrine called Beginnings?Beginnings.
                  
                  
                     An. Because it containes the Principles, and as it were the Elements, and ABC. of Christianitie; so as it is a borrowed speech from humane Arts & Sciences, wher the Elements are first to be taught vnto those which couet the perfect skill of any Science.
                  Qu. Wherefore doth he call the doctrine of the Catechisme a Foundation?
                     Foundation.
                  
                  
                     
                     An. This also is a figuratiue speach taken from earthly affaires, as from buildings, wher the foundation or ground-vvorke vseth first to be laid, that the walles and roofe may be reared and raised vpon it: Euen so in the spirituall building vp of mens consciences to God, the doctrine of Catechisme is first to be laid as a foundation, and afterward the misterie of Christ is more highly and deeply to bee handled, as it were the rearing of the walles, roofe, and loouer.
                  Qu. What meaneth the Apostle to say that he will leaue this doctrine of the beginning of Christ, and that he will not lay againe the foundation? &c.
                  
                  
                     An. That toward the Hebrewes hee will not obserue this forme of Catechising, or deliuering doctrine plainely and familiarly.
                  Qu. Why so?
                  
                  
                     An. Because it became them by reason of their time and long continuance, to be rather teachers then such as needed the principles: and this is implyed in the illatiue particle, therefore.

                     An. The teaching of Christ more perfectly, in such a manner as might be sitting for them that were of age, and expert in the word of righteousnesse.

                     Ans. A promise of the Apostle to teach the Hebrewes, and in them all Christians the doctrine of Christ more exactly and perfectly.
                  Qu. How doth he illustrate and declare this his promise of deliuering the doctrine in a more perfect manner?
                  
                  
                     An. By the contrary, as thus, that he will now omit and let passe the first rudiments of Christianitie, to the end he may follow a more perfect course.
                  Qu. How is this set foorth?
                  
                  
                     Ans. By an enumeration or rehearsall of certaine particular rudiments and principles, wherein Christians of the primitiue Church were wont at their first

Religion to be catechised and instructed, as repentance from dead workes, faith towards God, &c.
                  
                  Qu. Gather vs now the summe of this whole Scripture?
                  
                  
                     An. It is thus much,Summe collected. as if the Apostle should haue said whereas the doctrine concerning Christ, as touching the manner of teaching and deliuering it, hath tvvo parts, Heb. 5 vers. 12.13. one part which hath more perfection, and belongs to such as are strong & haue more profited; the other part belongs to weake ones which are nouices, and consists in the first elements and beginnings of Christ, such as repentance from dead workes, &c. I am determined to leaue and forsake this latter part, not to meddle with it, and to prosecute the former, bringing forth doctrines in such manner as is fit for strong men which be of ripe iudgement and vnderstanding in heauenly misteries.
                  Qu. What may be learned from this Text of the Apostle,
                     Instructions. 
                     thus opened and expounded?
                  
                  
                     An. That there is a great deale of skill and wisedome required in the ministers of Christ,First Instruct. to be able to discerne by what degrees they ought to proceed in the dispensation of the secrets of the kingdome. An other example whereof see 1 Cor. 2.6. and Chap. 3. ver. 1.2. Also Christ our Lord requireth in his stewards to be both faithfull and wise, to know how to speake a word in season, and that euery one in the familie may haue such a portion as is fit, and as he for his age and strength is capable of. This proueth them foolish stewards that cannot distinguish of the manner of teaching, and of the persons towards whom each manner must be vsed.
                  Qu. What things may be further gathered from hence for our instruction.
                  
                  
                     An. The authoritie, antiquitie, excellency, Second inst

                        . fruit and necessitie of teaching the Catechisme, or doctrine of beginnings.
                  Qu. How may the antiquitie of this manner of teaching be collected?
                     Antiquitie of Catechising.
                  
                  
                     An. Thus, If could be no new thing but very auncient,

being vsed in the time of the primitiue Church, euen so far off as in the age and time of the Apostles. And that it was vsed in those times is plaine, not onely by this place where it is cleere (for they could not leaue that which they neuer vsed, nor be said to lay againe that which had not ben once laid) but also by 1 Cor. 3. vers. 1.2. The learned

                  Qu. But ye can fetch the antiquitie of Catechising further off than Christ his time, or the primitiue age?
                  
                  
                     An. It is true. In the Iewish Church being before the comming of Christ, it was practised both in families, as in Adams, Abrahams, Gen. 3.18. and others charged so to doe by Moses, Deu. 5.7. and in publike assemblies, wherevnto the words of the Apostle Rom. 2.18. seeme to haue reference (being instructed by the Law) or catechised in the law, so the words are in the

                     An. Not any deuise and inuention of men, but of diuine authoritie, because the Apostles were by diuine inspiration guided both for the matter and manner of their teaching, 2 Pet. 1.21. also as the matter and manner of their doctrine was of God, so the writing and putting into scripture both the one and the other was done by diuine

Thirdly, in that it tendeth and helpeth forward vnto perfection of the Saints in knowledge of godlines: how must not that be very excellent which is an ordinance of God, for so excellent an end as the good and eternall saluation of the Elect? Lastly, in that it is so much resisted by Sathan, this conuinceth both the great worth, and the singular fruit of this kinde of teaching: for hee would not so much stirre and labour to keepe it out of Church and families, were it not a work and exercise both of much dignitie, and manifold vtilitie.
                  Qu. What may be the fruit and vtilitie of this kind of teaching?
                     Profit of Catechising. Heb. 6.1.

                        See Greenham. No kingdome of note in the vvorld but by Catechising receiued the Gospell vvithin 40. yeares after Christs passion saith Aegisippus. Necessitie of Catechising.
                      prepareth to ripenesse and perfection in knowledge of God: Secondly, It fitteth vs to discerne and try out truth from errour. Rom. 2.18. Thirdly, it maketh Christians more meet for the receiuing of the blessed Communion, which without some fundamentall knowledge cannot be receiued worthely. 1 Cor. 11.29. Lastly, it causeth vs to heare the word preached more profitably, euen as Masons build vp more easily when the ground-worke is well laid.
                  Qu. What difference is there betweene preaching, and the Catechising doctrine?
                  
                  
                     An. The one is but short, the other a more large treatise: the one belongs to weake ones, the other both to strong and weake: the one is as the laying the foundation, the other a building to perfection: also in Catechising there is deliuerie by the Minister, and redeliuery by the Children; not so in preaching which is not exacted to be repeated.
                  Qu. What other instruction doth arise of these words?
                  
                  
                     An. The great necessitie of Catechisme, and catechising doctrine both in Church and families, because there will alwayes be such rude and ignorant ones as will need the principles, and must haue precept vpon precept, and line vpon line, now a little and then a little, sometime informing them by Catechisme, sometime refreshing them by Historie.
                  
                     Qu. Declare this necessitie further?
                  
                  
                     An. A foundation is not more necessary to a building, nor beginnings & rudiments more needful to the perfection of an Art, then catechising doctrine is vnto the ripe and sound knowledge of Christianitie: for as there can be no good building perfected where the ground-worke is not first well laid; nor any profiting in any facultie or Science without the skill of the elements of that Science: so neither can there be any growth in Christian doctrine where catechising is neglected.
                  Qu. How was this point further laid open?
                  
                  
                     
                        Cor. 3.2. Io

                           . 5.12.13.
                     An. By the similitude of bodily milke which is not more behouefull and requisite for infants, who without it cannot grow strong and able to digest hard meates; then is Catechising for young beginners, who cannot be able to conceiue the deeper and higher misteries except they be first nourished with spirituall milke of the doctrine of the beginnings of Christ: and there will alwayes be weake ones which need this milke.
                  Qu. What vse was made of all these instructions?

                     A. They serue to these two purposes: first, to reproue such as haue charge of others, especially Ministers of the word, which for lack eyther of abilitie cannot, or of good affection will not take paines in this most good and necessary course, without which there is no hope of any good to come by their labours.
                  Qu. Doth it not argue and checke them with foolishnesse, aswell as with negligence, who teach without Catechising?
                  
                  
                     An. It doth so: for it is all one as if a Mason would imagine to finish a firme building without a foundation; or as though one should thinke to reade well, and neuer to learne his Letters; or to speake and write Latine with good congruitie, and not once to looke vpon his Rules of Grammer; or finally, as if a Nurse would feede a young Infant that is tender, with solid hard meat, as Bacon, Brawne, Beefe, or such like, which all would condemne for an indiscreete course.
                  
                     Qu. What was the second vse?
                  
                  
                     An. It serueth, to Seeing it hath god the author & is commanded by him, practised by the Church olde & nevv, vsed by the Apostles, and Fathers also; ignorance increaseth vvithout it, knovvledge abounds by it, & many other good things come of it; Papists, nay, Heathens haue allovved it: see Greenham. fol. 311. exhort and prouoke such as haue not begun this exercise in their charges, to take it vp without further delay, and to encourage such as haue made a good entrance therein, and some good proceedings, to hold on and persist as they purpose to see any good to come of their indeauours; and as they will giue an account to Christ with ioy.
                  Q. Now reckon vp vnto vs the Catechising 
                     Doctrines of Catechisme 
                           〈◊〉
                         fundamentall doctrine vsed in the primitiue Church. 
                     doctrines taught by the Apostles to the primitiue Church, how many, and what they be?
                  
                  
                     An. There is some diuersitie of iudgement amongst learned men, about the number and nature of these doctrines.
                  Qu. Report vnto vs this diuersitie, and then deliuer vnto vs what you think of this matter.
                  
                  
                     An. Mr. Iunius makes fiue parts of this Christian sum, which he nameth thus: first, Repentance from dead works: Secondly, Faith in God: Thirdly, doctrine of Baptismes: Fourthly, Imposition of hands: Fiftly, Resurrection of the dead, and eternall Iudgement, which two he ioyneth in one.
                  Mr. Greenham refers them all to two heads, Repentance, and Faith.
                  Mr. Piscator hee reduceth them all to three heads, First, Repentance from dead workes: Secondly, Faith towards God: Thirdly, Resurrection vnto eternall iudgement: of these two he maketh one principle as Iunius doth: now for the third and fourth, to wit, the doctrine of Baptismes, and imposition of hands, these hee esteemeth not as peculiar points of doctrine, but therefore to be mentioned here, to declare the circumstance of time, when those three foundations aforenamed were wont to be taught and propounded vnto them, namely, either at the time when such as were (adulti) men of yeares before they embraced the profession of Christ, were to be admitted into the Church by Baptisme, as Mat. 3. Act. 8. or when such as being baptised

in their infancie were to be confirmed before the Church by imposition of hands.
                  Mr. Beza, accounteth fiue heads of catechising doctrine, as Iunius doth, but differeth in the particulars: for hee seuereth the two last, which Iunius and Piscator doe ioyne: and hee seemeth to ioyne the third and the fourth which Piscator seuereth.
                  Qu. But what doe you thinke of the distribution of these doctrines?
                  
                  
                     An. Holding the iudgement of these and other learned men in reuerent regard, and leauing freedome (as is meet) to euery man to follow what he deemeth most sound and fit: I doe diuide these doctrines into sixe heads, or into sixe seuerall parts, which I name thus: First, Repentance from dead works: Secondly, Faith towards God: Thirdly, Doctrine of Sacraments, by a Sinecdoche of the part: Fourthly, the doctrine of Chruch-order and Officers, by a Metinomie of the signe: Fiftly, the Resurrection of the dead: Sixtly, the last and generall iudgement, with the eternall estate of all reasonable creatures after the same.
                  Qu. What is the reason why you follow this distinction?
                  
                  
                     An. Because it hath a more full institution, and

                     doctrines are tearmed beginnings and foundations, sithens these are all which the most skilfull Christian need to know: in the vnderstanding of these, the great mistery of Godlinesse doth consist: All that a man can know, is but to know these, why then doe you tearme them milke and beginnings?
                  
                  
                     An. These selfe same The same doctrine (saith 
                           〈◊〉
                        , is both a

                      doctrines are both principles and perfections, both milke and strong meate, both foundation and roofe, according to the diuers manner of handling and deliuering them to the Church: As for example, the doctrine of Repentance or of Faith being propounded in few and plaine words, as children in yeares or knowledge

may perceiue it, is milke and a principle or foundation: but the very same doctrine being taught more copiously and profoundly is strong meat, and as it were the roofe of the building, these doctrines being like a riuer, in which both the Lambe may wade, and the Elephant may swimme.
                  Qu. Now its time ye come to the first Article of this Catechising doctrine, what is it?
                     
                        First doctrine of the Catechisme.
                     
                  
                  
                     An. Repentance from dead works.
                  Qu. What things doe you consider in this article?
                  
                  
                     An. Two things: first, what dead workes be. Secondly what it is to repent from those dead workes.

                     An. As the word of the Law doth prepare and begin repentance:Grace of Repentance hovv effected. so it is effected and wrought by the word of the Gospell, wherein the same spirit of God is mightie to stirre vp in the Elect a loue of Gods will, with a loathing of euery thing which is against it, vpon theThis is that is called Faith. sight of Gods meruailous mercie toward them in the forgiuenesse of all their sinnes by Christ.

                     An. It is true: for as Repentance legall, vvhen a man hath no more but a knovvledge of his sin and danger, vvith a grief and fear therof, the Greeks call this

                        . touching the sight and knowledge of sinnes, and of the dreadfull accursed state wee are in through them; together with a great feare and certaine griefe of mind, for our sinfull and wofull condition, all this doth proceed and goe before faith, but the Repentance euangelical, vvhē one beleeuing his sin to be forgiuen him, novv feares and flyes sin, not onely for the danger of it, but for the displeasure of his good God: this

Fourthly, a feare least such things by our corruption should breake forth againe. Fiftly, a great and ardent desire to preuent them. Sixly, a zeale against all euill in our selues and others, and of doing all good we can in our generall & special callings.

                     A. Because it is in vain to heare ought of God or Christ, of grace or saluation, vntill we be taught to know our own miserable estate by sinne

                     Qu. You can giue vs some description of God, by this which you haue spoken.
                     
                     
                        What God is.
                        An. Yea, God is a spirit, or spirituall substance, being of himselfe, and cause of being to all his creatures, eternall, immutable, infinite in knowledge, power, mercy, truth, iustice and holinesse: or thus, God is a most perfect selfe-being, or an infinite perfection: or thus, God is an almightie and eternall Spirit, most holy, most wise, most righteous, maker and gouernour of the whole world, and euery thing therein: these discriptions being diuers in words, are yet one in substance.
                     Qu. But for the ignorant sake speake yet more plainely what God is?
                     
                     
                        An. God is such a nature as is of himselfe, and by himselfe, from euerlasting without dependance of any other, the soueraigne cause of all things which be, himselfe not subiect to any change or alteration, seeing and knowing all things before euer they come to passe, infinitely louing all goodnesse, and hating all vice and euill, full of all power to reward the one, and to take reuenge on the other, most mercifull towards his creatures, to pitty and relieue their misery; but especially, toward his children, in keeping that promise most constantly, which he in great goodnes, and mercy made and gaue to them for their eternall happinesse by Christ.
                     Qu. What vse is to be made of this description of God?
                     
                     
                        
                        An. Manifold, first to correct all those godlesse fancies and imaginations which arise in mens braines contrary to that which God hath thus reuealed of himselfe. Secondly, to helpe men in their secret prayers vnto and in the meditations of God, to thinke and iudge aright of him, as of an infinite and most glorious being, that is all goodnesse power, and wisedome. Thirdly, to moue men to loue him for his great goodnes. Fourthly, to trust him on his word, who is of such truth. Fiftly, to feare him whose power and iustice is so fearefull. Sixtly, to suffer him to gouerne them whose wisdome is so perfect. Seuenthly, to be obedient to please him whose maiestie and authoritie is so excellent & glorious. Eightly, to depend vpon him who is the author and giuer of our being and all other good things. And lastly, to labour to imitate this God in such his properties, wherein we may and ought to be like him, striuing to bea

                        An. First, by Scriptures, 1. Cor. 8.6. Ephes. 4.6. Secondly, by reason, because there cannot be two eternals or infinits. It may also be declared by these similitudes: As euery body hath but one soule, and no kingdome can endure two kings, so the world hath but one soueraigne gouernor which is God: this ouerthroweth pluralitie of Gods, or the opinion of many Gods.
                     Qu. How are the persons named and distinguished?

                        An. Two: first, generall touching all creatures, reasonable and vnreasonable in heauen and earth: Secondly, speciall, which concerneth the chiefe creatures, as Angels and men.

                        An. The former is called prouidence, which is his

fore-determination of all, euen the least things, that fall out vnto the falling of an haire, or a Sparrow, Mat. 10.29.30. The latter is Predestination,Predestination vvhat it is. which is his fore-determining of the euerlasting estate of Angels and men. Iude. 4. Rom. 8.29.30.

                        An. No verily, some are fore-appoynted to life eternall, these are called Elect, Tit. 1.2. Others, fore-appointed to eternall death, which are termed reprobates. 2 Cor. 1.3.5. 1. Thes. 5.9. Rom. 9.2.
                     Qu. What is the end of Gods Predestination?
                     
                     
                        An. Gods glory in the manifestation of his mercy towards the Elect: and of his iustice towards the reprobate.
                           Eph. 1.6.14. To the praise of the glory of his grace
                         
                        Rom. 9.22.23. This which is spoken of the decree of God ouerthroweth the fond and false conceit of Heathenish & Christian Atheists, who attribute all things to fortune and nature, and of Papists who ascribe so much to free-will.
                     Qu. Is election of all men?
                     
                     
                        An. No, but of a certaine number onely, as it is written,Hovv many be elected. 
                        Many are called but few are chosen.
                     
                     Qu. They erre then which thinke the grace of election to be common?
                     
                     
                        An. They doe so: for the Scripture speakes of vessels of wrath, prepared to destruction. Rom. 9.22. Iude. 4.
                     Qu. May a man know his owne election?

                        An. That it is eternall, Eph. 1.4. therefore it differeth from effectuall calling, which is done in time. Secondly, Vnchangeable, Math. 24.24. Therefore once Elect can neuer become Reprobate. Thirdly, most free, hauing

no other cause but the good pleasure of God, Ephes. 1.5. therefore not depending vpon foreseene faith or works: Fourthly, most righteous and holy. Psal. 145.17. Fiftly, it is not of the end onely▪ but also of the means which bring vs vnto eternall life, as faith and good workes. 1. Pet. 1.2. 2. Thes. 2.13. Eph. 1.4.

                        An. Vnbeleeuers and wicked liuers doe in vaine boast of their election, as the Iewes. Iohn 8. Secondly, it containes the markes of our Election, faith and loue. Eph. 1.4. 2 Thes. 2.13. Thirdly, it confuteth them who say, if they be elect, they may liue as they list: and fourthly, them also which say faith and good works come of our free will, whereas they flow from the free grace of election. Eph. 1.4. Act. 13.48.

                        An. Preseruation,
                           Parts of gouernment.

                         whereby he preserueth and vpholdeth euery particular thing and creature so long as pleaseth him. 1. Tim. 4.10. Heb. 1.2.3. Secondly, In the ruling and preseruing of humane creatures God vseth kings and other Magistrates, as his vicegerents, of vvhose authoritie, dignitie, degrees, office, and commodities of their gouernement yee may read. Psal. 82. Rom. 13. Rule, whereby as Lord of heauen and earth he ordereth and disposeth euery thing most mightily, wisely and iustly, to his owne glory and good of his Church. Eph. 1.11. Rom. 11.36.

                        An. That the Lord God the fountaine of nature, is not tyed to the Law of nature, meanes are rather in respect of vs, then of God who worketh as hee will euen contrary to meanes.
                     Qu. What vse is to be made of this doctrine, of Gods gouerning all things?
                     
                     
                        An. First, it teacheth contentment in euery estate: in aduersitie to be patient, in prosperitie to be thankfull. Psal. 39.9. Secondly, also it teacheth in all necessities and dangers to seeke to God by prayer, Act. 4.24. Lastly, because hee preserues and rules by meanes, therefore wee are not to neglect them least wee tempt God. Mat. 4.7. nor to trust in them least we deny God, this was the fault of king Asa who trusted in the Physition.
                     Qu. What learne ye hereby that God worketh against means?
                     
                     
                        An. We learne this, that when meanes are wanting or be against vs, yet we ought still to trust in God for helpe, as Danyel and Sydrach, &c.
                     
                     Qu. Amongest all the workes of diuine gouernment which is chiefest?

                     Qu. Doth it excell the worke of our Creation?
                     
                     
                        An. Yes, sundry wayes: first, in Creation God brought something out of nothing; in our Redemption he brought life out of death, and saued them which were worse then nothing. Rom. 5.6.7.8. Secondly,
                           Acts 2
                              •
                            24. the world was created with a word: he said, Let it be light, and it was light, Gen. 1.4▪ But redeemed with most horrible sorrowes and paines.

                        Mat. 27. throughout. Thirdly, in creation God made known his power and wisdome: Rom. 1.20. in Redemption hee manifested his iustice and mercy. Fourthly, in creation God made man: for our redemption God was made man, Gal. 4.4. Lastly, by our creation we are sonnes of God, but by Redemption members of Christ, and hee is of heauen.

                        An. These two natures, with their properties, and actions though they be vnited in one person of our blessed Sauiour, yet they abide vnconfounded, so as the God-head is not the man-hood, nor on the contrary. Also the man-hood is not eternall, infinite, almightie, &c. nor the God-head is

not mortall, finite, subiect to hunger or thirst: The God-head did not speake, walke, obey, suffer death; the man-hood did not cast out diuels or doe other Miracles, or support it selfe in suffering, or giue merit to his obedience, but in the worke of our Redemption each nature did that which is proper to it, their properties and actions concurring to effect the glorious deliuerance of the Elect.

                     Qu. Was this vnion necessary for our Redemption?
                     
                     
                        An. Yes, most necessary; for Christ our Redeemer,Why needfull. The God-head is impassible.

                     Qu. Is not this common to all other gifts of the spirit?

                            is to receiue him, as it lookes to the Saints it vvorks by loue. Gal. 5.6. faith onely to receiue Christ. Iohn. 1.12. Gal. 3.14.
                     Qu. Is it not in this sense said that we are iustified by faith?
                     
                     
                        
                        An. It is so, not because faith as a vertue, qualitie, or worke is any part of righteousnesse, which is wholy in Chirst his obedience and sufferings. 1. Cor. 1.30. but because it is a spiritual hand to receiue his iustice to be ours.
                     Qu. Is Christ and his righteousnesse ours to iustifie vs, before it be receiued by faith?
                     
                     
                        An. Our righteousnesse is perfectly and fully wrought before, and it is ours in the purpose of God, who hath decreed to giue it vs, but till wee beleeue wee haue no profit by Christ but are as the reprobates be, that is, sinners, vngodly, enimies, children of wrath, Rom. 5.6.8. Rom. 3.6. Eph. 2.2.3. Sauing that the Elect are vnder the decree of Gods loue, and are preserued from the downe-fall mentioned, Heb. 6.4.5.6. whereinto some reprobates fall.
                     Qu. It seemeth to me ye will haue faith coupled with Christ to make vs righteous?
                     
                     
                        An. No, my meaning is that Christs The robe of Christs iustice as a garment is vvithout vs, inherent in Christs ovvne person, till it b

                     Qu. By what similitude may this be expressed?
                     
                     
                        An. By the similitude of a pardon, a gift, a plaister, of the Sunne, of the brasen serpent, which doe benefit none till they be receiued, accepted, applyed and looked vpon. Ioh. 3.14.15. so Christ our soule-plaister, that vnspeakable gift of God, the Sunne of righteousnesse, doth not benefit any till they beleeue in him.
                     Qu. What thinke yee of their opinion which say Christ and his obedience are ours, to iustifie vs before wee beleeue?
                     
                     
                        An. It is senselesse, absurd, impious, hereticall and damnable.
                     Qu. Why say you so?
                     
                     
                        An. Because it fighteth against sense, reason, scripture, Rom. 3. and 4. and 10. consent of the Church, Gods decree. Iohn. 6.40. Christs glory. Rom. 4.20. and brings in a false Christ, which should be a iustifier of vnbeleeuers whiles they be such.
                     
                        Qu. But the Elect are accounted iust with God in his eternall counsell, therefore iustified before and without faith?
                     
                     
                        An. This is an absurd reason, for iustification or accounting iust is distinguished from eternall predestination as an effect from the cause, a timely effect issuing out of an euerlasting cause. Rom. 8.30. Againe, euen in Gods eternall counsell, hee doth so decree to iustifie the Elect as it was ordayned to be by faith in Christ, Gal. 3.8.
                     Qu. What vse is to be made of this doctrine?
                     
                     
                        An. First, it admonisheth vs aboue all things to labour for a liuely faith: secondly, it confuteth Papists who set vp other meanes to apply Christ, and them which will haue Christ and all his good things without application.
                     Qu. Be there not degrees of faith?

                     Q. What difference is there between a weak and a strong faith?
                     
                     
                        An. None in the nature of the thing, but in the measure of apprehending Christ: for the weake faith being true and liuely,

                        An. First, because God onely is to be trusted in. Rom. 10.1. Secondly, Prayer is a religious seruice of God, and God onely is to be serued Mat. 4.10. Thirdly, God alone knoweth the desires of our hearts, Acts. 1.26. Fourthly, God alone is all-sufficient to help. Gen. 17.1.

                        An. True, it doth so, because they haue but the shadow and appearance, without the truth and substance of these graces. Also this proueth prayer to be one of the hardest works of a Christian, contrary to the common opinion of ignorant men, who take prayer to be but a mouing of the lips, and repetition of certaine words.

                     Qu. What is it to pray in Christs name?
                     
                     
                        An. First, to desire to be heard for his loue and merit: Secondly, to trust that our praiers shal please God through Christs merit.
                     Qu Why doe yee require that both desire and confidence or trust should be had in prayer?
                     
                     
                        An. Because these are the two wings, vpon which the soule of a Christian in prayer must mount, and soare vp to heauen, as Christ saith, whatsoeuer ye desire in prayer, beleeuing in my name it shall be done for you. Mark. 9.
                  
                  
                     Of Patience vnder the Crosse.
                     Qu. YOu reckoned vp patience vnder the Crosse amongst the fruits of faith, tell vs I pray you, what is it that you call the Crosse?
                     
                     
                        An. Euery tribulation or affliction which befalleth vs in this life, but namely, and more especially such as befals vs for righteousnesse sake: so as there be both generall crosses which happen for sinne, and be common to all, and special crosses which happen for righteousnesse sake, and be peculiar to the godly.
                     Qu. Who sendeth these afflictions?
                     
                     
                        An. They all come from God, as it is written, No euill is

in the Citie but God hath done it, Amos. 3.6. and they are sent of God for most iust and good ends.
                     Qu. What be the ends for the which common afflictions are sent?
                     
                     
                        An. The end of them as God intendeth in respect of euill men, is to inuite them to repentance, that is, to giue them occasion of turning; or to leaue them without excuse, Rom. 2.4. but the euent of them in respect of the men themselues to whom they are sent, it is the hardning of them in sinne. Rom. 2.5. but in respect of the godly, the vtmost end of Gods counsell in afflicting them in respect of themselues, it is to preserue them from perishing with this vnrepentant world, 1. Cor. 11.32. Yee are chastised least ye perish with the vnrepentant world. There be also other ends, which sue and lead to this end: as first, the humbling and meekning them vnder Gods hand: Secondly, the amendment of their liues, Euen to hide the pride of man, and to turne him from his enterprise, as Iob speaketh.

                     Qu. What doe yee call the Crosse sent for righteousnes sake?
                     
                     
                        An. Such an affliction as is sent eyther for any wel-doing in respect of doing any good or hindering any euill; or such as commeth to vs for our loue and profession of the Gospell, as any rebuke, iniury in word or deed, in name or goods for Christ sake, and amongst these martyrdome is chiefe, which is a willing and constant suffering of death, or torment for the truth of God.
                     Qu. What is the end of these kinds of Crosses?
                     
                     
                        An. First, they come for a notable tryall of the faith & constancy of the Godly: secondly, for the confirmation of the Church by their constant suffering. Phil. 1. Rom. 16. thirdly, for a testimoniall against the wicked world, Mat. 10. Lastly, after they be tryed, they shall haue a crowne of glory in heauen. Iames. 1.12.
                     Qu. Now define vnto vs what patience is?
                     
                     
                        An. It is the grace of the spirit whereby the Christian soule is made able to endure the shame & smart of the crosse.
                     Qu. What be the extreames of this vertue?
                     
                     
                        
                        An. Blockish senselessenes, whereby the bitternesse of affliction is not felt. Secondly, impatiencie when men rage vnder the heauy hand of God, patience walks in the middle and feeleth the griefe and paine of afflictions in such sort, as yet with good contentment it keepeth vs quite vnder it, waiting by hope for a good and happy end in Gods blessed time according to his promise.
                     Qu. By what consideration doth God vse to worke patience in the hearts of his Children?
                     
                     
                        An. By these and such like: first, that it is his will to afflict his children, Heb. 13.6.7.8.9. Secondly, that their brethren which be in the world tast of the same cup. 1. Pet. 5 Thirdly, that God will not afflict his owne aboue their strength, but will minister sufficient strength to beare. Fourthly, that hee will at last graunt a very good issue, making all things turne to their best in the end. 1. Cor. 10.13. Fiftly, that the Sonne of God was not free from afflictions, and that is a great mercy to be conformed and made like to Christ in suffering, that they may be like him in glory. 2. Tim. 1. If we suffer with him, we shall also raigne with him. Sixtly, that the afflictions of this life be both short and momentary, but the glory which followeth this life hath both perpetuitie and waight. 2. Cor. 5. Lastly, because afflictions through Gods blessing bring forth patience, and patience, experience, and experience hope, and this maketh not ashamed.
                     Qu. What doe yee call hope?
                     
                     
                        An. It is that grace vvhereby the Christian soule in regard of Gods mercy and truth certainely expecteth the performance of all good things promised, but especially of life eternall.
                     Qu What difference betweene Faith and Hope?
                     
                     
                        An. Faith assureth vs of the truth of Gods promise, hope looketh for the accomplishment thereof.

                        An. The doctrine of Baptismes.
                     Qu. What is meant by the doctrine of Baptisme?
                     
                     
                        An. The doctrine of the Sacraments, both being comprehended vnder one, by a Synechdoche of the part for the whole.
                     Qu. Wherefore is the doctrine of Sacraments the third fundamentall article?
                     
                     
                        An. Because our faith in God being infirme and little, wee were to be taught next after faith, whence to fetch strengthning and support of our weakenesse.
                     Qu. Why doth he say Baptismes?
                     
                     
                        An. To note a double washing: first, outward by the Minister: secondly, inward by Christ. Mat. 3.11.

                     Qu. Who is the authour of the Sacraments?
                     
                     
                        An. Christ himselfe the Sonne of God is author of the Sacraments in the new Testament, Mat. 26.26. and 28.19.20.
                     Qu. Why must Sacraments be of diuine appointment?
                     
                     
                        An. Because it is requisite that as God made the couenant of grace and saluation, so he should confirme that couenant by what tokens himselfe thought meete: Also this perswadeth Christians of the necessitie and profitablenesse of the Sacraments, because Christ ordaineth nothing in vaine. Lastly, this warneth all men with obedience and due reuerence to resort vnto the vse of them, as vnto the ordinances of Christ, which cannot be iniured and prophaned without iniury to Christ the authour. 1. Cor. 11▪27.
                     Qu. To what vse doe Sacraments serue?

                        An. First, to be markes of our profession to seuer Gods people from all strangers: Secondly, to instruct and teach our mindes in the truth of the Couenant; as Baptisme teacheth vs that wee come into the world full of vncleannesse, and that all holinesse is to be fetched from Christ: and the Lords Supper teacheth vs that eternall life in part and in whole, consisteth in the pertakeing of Christ: Thirdly, to confirme and establish our mindes in the promise of righteousnesse. Rom. 4.11.
                     Qu. Are the promises vncertaine and doubtfull?

                        7.8.9.10.11.12. Examples of the godly doe incite vs to it. Luke 8.3. Phil. 4.18.

                        An. To direct the people to maintaine their Teachers not of custome or because of law, but vpon conscience to God willingly and vprightly.
                  
                  
                     
                     Of the Resurrection.
                     Qu. WHerefore is this the next fundamentall point?
                     
                     
                        An. Because when the Ministry ceaseth, the Resurrection begins.
                     Qu. Doth not the Resurrection argue that men doe first fal by death?
                     
                     
                        An. It doth so, and truth it is, that it is appointed for men once to dye. Heb. 9.29.
                     Qu. What be the causes of death?
                     
                     
                        An. First, Gods decree pronounced it in Genesis. 3. Dust thou art, and to dust thou shalt returne: Secondly, mans sinne, The wages of sinne is death: Rom. 6.23. These two causes bewray the necessitie of dying.
                     Qu. Shall all men dye?
                     
                     
                        An. All are subiect to death and mortalitie, but yet many shal be found aliue at the comming of Christ, whose sodain change shall be instead of a death to them.
                     Qu. But seeing Christ dyed for beleeuers, wherefore shall the faithfull die?
                     
                     
                        A. 1 To obey Gods ordinance. 2 Because otherwise they cannot be gathered vnto god to be with him in his kingdom.
                     Qu. What difference is there betweene the death of the wicked and the Godly?
                     
                     
                        An. Very great, euen as there is great difference between the wicked and the godly in and at their death.
                     Q. Shew vs both these things, & first, in their death what difference?
                     
                     
                        An. Death vnto the one is a curse and stipend of sin. Rom. 6.23. vnto the other, the curse is remoued, and death is become to them an aduantage & blessing,
                           Phil. 1. Reu. 14.13. they are blessed in their death. Secondly, death to the wicked is an entrance to eternal death, the suburbs of hel, the beginning of endles misery through sin, wheras death to the godly is an entrance to eternall life, the porch and gate to heauen, a beginning of neuer ending blisse and glory through Christ.
                     Q. Now what difference is there between themselues & their death?
                     
                     
                        An. Exceeding great, the wicked in their death are either blockish or impatient, and ful of despair, impenitent & comfortlesse: the godly (though with great difference amongst themselues) yet all doe give vp their spirit in faith of the

promise, vnder hope of glory and with repentance for their sins, for they all dye in the Lord. Reu. 14.13, and fall a sleep in Christ. 1. Thes. 4.14.
                     Qu. What comforts haue the godly against the force of death?
                     
                     
                        An. Though they feare it, and ought so to do, being a dissolution of nature, and a iudgement of god, yet the feare of it is moderated and tempered with comforts, especially, from the hope of an happy & glorious resurrection. 1 Thes. 4.18.

                        An. Yea, the same in substance, but of another qualitie,

                     Qu. With what qualities shall our bodies arise?
                     
                     
                        A. 1. With

                        An. Seeing our bodies shall rise to such glory, wee may not apply them to the base seruice of sinne.
                     Qu. What is the comfort we may reape hereof?
                     
                     
                        An. Very much, both for the death of our friends, and for our own departure, because we shall return again into better case, as a man that puts off rags to cloth himself with a robe.
                     Qu. By whose meanes shall the Resurrection be?
                     
                     
                        An. By the meanes and ministerie of Angels, who shall gather the Elect from the foure windes.
                     Qu. What is the end of the Resurrection?
                     
                     
                        A. The neerest end in respect of men, is their shame or glory. Dan. 12.2. the vtmost end in respect of Christ, is the manifestation of his mercy & iustice, to the glory of his name.
                     Qu. Now tell vs the vse we are to make of this doctrine of the Resurrection?
                     
                     
                        An. First, it is a bridle to stay from sin, to remember that

euill doers shall rise to their condemnation. Secondly, it is a spur to godlinesse. Act. 24.15.16. Thirdly, it moues to constancy to know that we shall reape a full reward, if we continue in godlines. Heb. 11.35. Fourthly, it ministreth comfort against death, seeing our bodies shall returne againe in far better condition. 1. Thes. 4.18.

                     Qu. WHy is the doctrine of eternall Iudgement the last Article in the Catechisme?

                        Ioh. 5.22. or for one speciall act of gouerning; namely, for the iudgeing of the world at the last day. Heb. 6.3. 2. Tim. 4.1. Eccles. 12.14.

                  An aduertisement to the Reader.
                  
                     GEntle Reader, after the Printing of this Catechisme, which beginneth with that principle of repentance from dead works at the ninth leaf of this book, I called some few things to minde whereof I thought good to aduertise thee; First, though the former Catechisme seeme somwhat long, and our sluggish natures best like short worke which is quickly done: yet hauing numbred the Questions which I finde to be fourteenescorce in the whole, I desired to certifie thee of this thing, that if eyther other Catechismes be not at hand with thee, or if this shall like thee better then others, eyther for clearenesse of order, or for easinesse of matter, that thou maist go foure times through it in thy family in one year, & yet put them to learn but foure Questions euery day: & by learning two euery day, it will twise be run through; or if they be catechised but twise a weeke, and rehearse but three Questions at a time, it wil be once ouercome yearely, the fruit may quit the cost. Things which at first view seeme great and hard, being wel and circumspectly dealt in, are found more easie, then they seeme for. As in an army, to subdue a great number of men well appointed seemeth a matter of great hazard (as it is indeed) yet single them out by two or three, it will be nothing to vanquish them. The new Testament hath shew of a great worke, yet read but fiue Chapters a day, (& thou wilt spend much time worse) thou shalt go through it once in two moneths and lesse, sixe times in one yeare. Also the Psalmes (being one hundred and fiftie) in appearance a long worke to peruse, yet read but two a day, and thou shalt foure times a year ouer read that precious booke of the psalmes, and haue diuers play dayes cast in: so is it with sundry Catechismes which carry a face of some difficultie to learne, howbeit by a good order being constantly followed, in short space they will be learned, and grow very familiar.
                  In the second place I am to entreat this of thy curtisie, that if thou findest in the foresaid Catechisme any thing eyther vnperfect or vnsound, (for the former it cannot be otherwise as all mens workes are; for the latter I hope it is otherwise, yet we are all men) and wilt certifie me thereof priuately by word or writing, I will thanke thee for thy good will and will trust if God will to giue thee satisfaction.
                  Lastly, whereas I haue drawne the former large Catechisme into a very little summe, hereunto affixed, containing not aboue fortie short Questions: the reason of my purpose herein, was for the fauour and ease of such as be weake, as well in yeares as knowledge, who hauing first with delight sucked in, and digested this summe, (through the good care of their parents or gouernours) they may become stronger, and better able to set vpon an harder and greater worke.
                  Farewell.
               
               
                  
                  A BRIEFE SVMME OF the whole Catechisme: for the helpe of the yonger sort.
                  
                     The first Principle: Repentance from dead works.
                     
                     
                        Abraham.
                        
                           MY Sonne, what doe yee call dead workes?
                        
                     
                     
                        Isaac.
                        All sinnes, whatsoeuer they be.
                     
                     
                        Abra.
                        
                           How many sorts of sinnes be there?
                        
                     
                     
                        Isaac.
                        Two: first, birth-sinne, which is the roote of all the rest: Secondly, all euill thoughts, words, and deeds, as bad fruits of a bad tree.
                     
                     
                        Abra.
                        
                           How many things doe yee consider in originall or birth-sinne?
                        
                     
                     
                        Isaac.
                        These foure things: first, the want of that righteousnesse wherein Adam was created: Secondly, the guilt of his disobedience imputed to vs: Thirdly, desert of punishment thereby: Lastly, corruption of nature being prone to all euill.
                     
                     
                        Abra.
                        Why are these things called dead workes?
                     
                     
                        Isaac.
                        Because they come from men dead in sinnes and trespasses: also because they doe in iustice deserue eternall death and destruction, euen the least sinfull thought.
                     
                     
                        Abra.
                        
                           How so?
                        
                     
                     
                        Isaac.
                        Because an infinite and eternall God is offended by euery sinne.
                     
                     
                        Abra.
                        
                           But seeing we were all created in righteousnesse in Adam, how did sinne and death enter into the world?
                        
                     
                     
                        Isaac.
                        First, by the temptation of Sathan, deceiuing our

first parents: secondly, by their willing obedience yeelded to the temptation.
                     
                     
                        Abra.
                        
                           Let mee now heare you tell me what it is to repent from dead workes?
                           Repentance.
                        
                     
                     
                        Isaac.
                        To renounce and vtterly to depart from our sins, with griefe and hatred of them: and to returne vnto God to doe his workes commanded in his law, with loue and delight in them.
                     
                     
                        Abra.
                        
                           How is this repentance wrought?
                        
                     
                     
                        Isaac.
                        The word of the law prepareth vs to it by engendring  feare of punishment. But the word of the Gospell  perswading vs of Gods mercy in forgiuenesse of sinne, worketh through the holy Ghost an hatred of sinne it selfe.
                     
                  
                  
                     The second Principle: Of faith towards God.
                     
                     
                        Of God.
                        
                           Abra.
                           
                              SEeing we are all dead and miserable through the guilt of Adams sinne, and our owne, where is the remedie for vs?
                           
                        
                        
                           Isaac.
                           By beleeuing and looking vp to the merciful goodnesse of God through Christ.
                        
                        
                           Abra.
                           
                              What are wee to know concerning this God?
                              Of God the Creatour.
                           
                        
                        
                           Isaac.
                           First, that hee is, and that he is but one: Secondly, that there be three persons in the God-head; the Father, the Sonne, and the Spirit. Thirdly, what God is, euen a most perfect spirituall substance, infinite in mercy, iustice, truth, wisedome, goodnesse and power. Fourthly, that hee purposed in himselfe from euerlasting what things hee would doe, and what things hee would not doe; in that purpose freely choosing some Angels and men to life, and not others. Lastly, that according to this eternall purpose, God created the world in sixe dayes out of nothing, by his word, and continually vpholdeth and gouerneth the same; and euery particular in it▪ most wisely to the glory of his name.
                        
                        
                           Abra.
                           
                              But are ye not bound to know some thing else concerning God?
                           
                        
                        
                           
                           Isaac.
                           Yes, namely this, that in the person of his Sonne hee was incarnate and made man, and so became God our Redeemer.

                           His benefits, all which are signified by that one word of saluation; and more particularly in those two words of Iustification and sanctification: the one remouing from vs the guilt and curse of our sinnes, the other destroying the power and rule of it.

                           Isaac.
                           It is that gift of God, whereby wee receiue Christ with all his merits to be our owne.

                           Isaac.
                           By loue, and practise of good workes.

                              How doe we attaine to this faith ordinarily?
                           
                        
                        
                           Isaac.
                           By the word of the Gospell soundly opened, and wisely applyed to the conscience of a sinner.
                        
                        
                           Abra.

                           Isaac.
                           No surely: but very weake and little, needing daily increase and strengthening.
                        
                        
                           
                           Abra.

                           Isaac.
                           First, by reading and preaching: secondly, by prayer: thirdly, by Sacraments.

                        Isaac.
                        A Sacrament is an outward signe and seale of the couenant of Grace.

                        Abra.
                        
                           What is the chiefe vse of these two Sacraments?
                        
                     
                     
                        Isaac.
                        To confirme and assure our mindes of our fellowship which we haue with Christ, and all his merits vnto saluation.
                     
                     
                        Abra.
                        
                           How many things are required in each Sacrament?
                        
                     
                     
                        Isaac.
                        Three: first, an outward signe: secondly, an inward thing: thirdly, an agreement or likenesse betweene the signe and the thing.
                     
                     
                        Abra.
                        
                           Shew these three things in Baptisme.
                        
                     
                     
                        Isaac.
                        In Baptisme the outward signe is water and washing: secondly, the thing signified and sealed is Christ, for our iustification and sanctification by his word and spirit: thirdly, the likenes is this, that as water washeth, to the outward cleansing of the body: so the bloud and spirit of Christ washeth to the inward purging of the conscience from dead workes.
                     
                     
                        Abra.
                        
                           Shew vs also these three things in the Lords Supper?
                        
                     
                     
                        Isaac.
                        First, the signes here are bread and wine, and all actions about them both in Minister and people: secondly, the thing signified and sealed is Christ, for our further grouth by him in our iustification and sanctification: thirdly, the likenesse betweene signe and thing is, that as bread and wine nourisheth vp our bodyes vnto a naturall life: so the

body and bloud of Christ being receiued by faith nourisheth vp our soule to a spirituall life.
                     
                     
                        Abra.
                        
                           When are we said to be nourished vp to a spirituall life by the Lords Supper?
                        
                     
                     
                        Isaac.
                        When the soule is thereby more and more assured of remission of sinnes by the death of Christ, and of perfect iustice by his obedience to the Law, together with a greater mortification of sinne, vnto the quieting of the conscience, and the greater hope of eternall life.

                        The inuisible Church is the whole number of the elect: but the visible Church is a company of persons called out of the rest of the world, to know and worship the true God, according to his word.

                        Let not sinne raigne therefore in your mortall body, that yee should obey it in the lusts thereof.
                     
                  
                  
                     THE holy and blessed Apostle Saint Paul,
                     The scope and method of this sixt Chapter vnto the 13. Verse. in the eleuen former verses of this Chapter had taught, that such as be iustified by faith in the blood of Christ, were partakars also of the Spirit of Christ vnto their sanctification, whereby they were freed, not from the corruption, yet from the tyranny and dominion of sin, euen as iustification had freed them from the guilt and condemnation of sinne, wherevpon he concludeth that sithens the gift and grace of righteousnesse in the forgiuenesse of sinne, is accompanyed with a new grace of holinesse vnto amendment of life, therefore the doctrine of free iustification doth giue no libertie to liue licentiously in sinne: How can they which are dead to sinne liue yet therein: Verse 2. then in the 3.4. and 5. Verses, our sanctification is declared both by the seuerall parts thereof, as also by the cause and testimonie of it. The parts are three: first, death of sinne: secondly, buriall of sinne,Verse 3. which is the progresse of mortification: thirdly, newnesse of life. The cause is a vertue or power deriued and conueyed into the members

of Christ, from his death to the beating downe and keeping vnder the strength of sinne:
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        . 4. and also from his Resurrection, to the quickning and raising them vp in their vnderstandings and wils vnto the study and loue of Godlines; all which hee setteth forth by an excellent similitude of grafting or planting:
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        . 5. Verse 5. like as the grift translated from an old stocke to a new, liueth, groweth, and fructifieth by the iuyce and vigour which it draweth from the stocke into which it is set: so it is with the elect, being taken out of the old rotten stock of Adam, and thence planted into that noble stocke Christ Iesus, they participate of his Spirit, by vertue whereof applying the death and Resurrection of Christ vnto them, they receiue power against corruption to keepe it downe and subdue it, as also to loue and doe in some measure the will of God: and of all this their Baptisme is no idle and naked, but an effectuall pledge and testimony, the water sanctified by the word, as also the dipping or sprinkling the childe with water, according to Christs ordinance and commandement, and the comming out of the water, being a powerfull instrument of the holy Spirit, not onely to represent and seale the grace of the couenant, but also to effect in all the elect their neerer and straighter coniunction with Christ, in his death and resurrection both for iustification and sanctification.
                  After this, from the sixt Verse to our Text, this communion of beleeuers with Christ is proued and amplified by comparison of contraries and equals, and at this twelfth Verse he falleth vnto exhortation, which he deduceth out of, and buildeth vpon the former doctrine, as appeareth by the illatiue particle (therefore,
                           
                              〈…〉
                            Text. let not sinne raigne,) which is as much as if hee should say, seeing the members of Christ are vouchsafed this mercy, to haue fellowship with Christs death, to the killing and destruction of sinne in them by little and little, euen as his crucified body dyed and languished by little vpon the Crosse, & also with his resurrection, that as Christ being dead & raised vp, now dyeth no more, but liueth for euer to God, likewise we may perpetually

liue the life of grace, till wee come to glory: therefore in this knowledge of this great grace wee should endeauour all that is in vs to maister and subdue those remainders of corruption which still stick in our nature, that sinne raigne not in vs as a king, and as a Tyrant trample vpon vs, and triumph ouer vs.
                  In this Verse consider the exhortation it selfe,Diuision of the text into tvvo parts. and the explication: the exhortation is to stirre vp all Christians to hinder the power and raigne of sinne in themselues, let not sinne raigne in your mortall bodies. The explication teacheth how this raigne and kingdome of sin is to be hindred, namely, by not obeying the lusts of sinne.
                  In the exhortation the words are first to be made plaine,Of the exhortation. then the matter to be handled.
                  
                     Let not sinne.] The word sinne in this place, and through this whole Chapter doth signifie that naturall corruption called originall 
                     Which is the inclination of our nature to all euill. 
                     sinne, which sticketh both to the reason and will, and hath depraued and corrupted them both. Eph. 2.23. This naturall corruption is here tearmed sinne, not onely because it is the fruit and consequence of our first parents sinne, as also the matter and cause of all other sinnes,
                        Peccatum, causae peccati, poena peccati. August. but moreouer because it keepeth the proper nature of sin, euen in the regenerate.
                  The Papists in their Remish notes deny this, and say that it is not properly a sinne, nor forbidden by commandement till it raigne in vs, and wee obey and follow the desires thereof. Which their opinion appeareth to be false by these reasons: first, Not onely actuall concupiscence, vvhen lust is consented to, but naturall and habituall concupiscence, vvhich is the inclination of our nature to euill is sin, though it be resisted by the spirit and grace. naturall concupiscence is repugnant to the law of God, as it is written, I had not knowne 
                     This must be meant of naturall concupiscence because the Apostle knevv actuall corruption to be sin vvithout the lavv, and the 7.8. & 9. commandements forbids concupiscence vvith consent. 
                     lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not lust. Rom. 7.7. But whatsoeuer is repugnant to the law is sinne, as it is written, the transgression of the Law is sinne. 1. Iohn. 3.4. Therefore naturall concupiscence is sinne. Secondly, naturall concupiscence rebelleth against the gouernment of the spirit in the minds

of the regenerate, There was (saith Paul) a Law in my members, rebelling against the Law of my minde: therefore it is sinne properly. Thirdly, it both commeth from sinne, and begetteth all other sinnes, and beareth the name of sinne: therefore it is properly sinne, 
                        
                           
                              〈◊〉

                              〈◊〉
                           .
                      according to that rule, That which maketh such, is more such. Fourthly, young children are knowne to dye which haue no other sinne but naturall concupiscence: now death is the wages of that which is properly sinne, therefore naturall concupiscence hath the proper nature of sinne: and whereas some say it is not properly sinne, because it is not voluntary, this reason holdeth not but in actuall sinnes onely, howbeit originall sinne in some sence may be auouched to be voluntary, insomuch as Adam voluntarily and freely disobeyed the commandement, and wee all sinned in him, his sinne is ours by imputation, as Christs merits and righteousnesse is ours by imputation, Rom. 5.12. &c.
                  And whereas some of the Fathers say it is not sinne in the regenerate, they must be vnderstood, first that it is not

                      accompted to them as a sin, to whom all sins are forgiuen: secondly, that in them it is no raigning sinne, but peccatum inhabitans, a dwelling sinne. Rom. 7.17.
                  Now the word body by a Synechdoche of the part for the whole,
                        
                           〈1 paragraph〉
                        
                      is taken here for the whole man, as the soule which is but one part of man, is sometimes put for the whole person; as in that saying of Ezek. 18. The soule that sinneth shall dye, and where Paul saith, Let euery soule be subiect, Rom. 13. so on the other side, the body is here put for the whole man, which appeareth by this reason, euen for that our sinnes doe principally raigne in the soule, as it is written, From within, euen from the heart, commeth adulterie, murder, debate, &c. The body being but the executioner to fulfill the deuises and desires of the soule, yet for good reasons the Apostle vseth here the word Body, rather then soule: first, because in the propagation of sin it is conueyed by the body into the soule, according to that of Iob, how can one draw a cleane thing out of vncleane seede? Secondly

because howsoeuer the first motion of sin comes from the soule, yet it is perfected by the body, which executeth that euill which the minde hath conceiued, & the will embraced. Thirdly, hauing before spoken of the crucifying of Christ, which was touching his body, he willingly retayneth this tearme of body both here and in the sixt verse. The meaning then is this, let not corruption or naturall concupiscence raigne in your selues, but keepe downe the power of it both in your soules and bodyes.
                  Now for the word (raigne) it signifieth here an absolute rule in commanding without resistance and opposition,
                        Raigne, vvhat it signifieth. such as kings haue in a kingdome where the people are subdued vnder them, and doe freely execute and doe their will and pleasure: Thus the Apostle himselfe expoundeth it in the next part of this verse, where it is said (That ye should obey it in the lusts thereof) whereof the meaning is,
                        Regnat peccatū, cum id sponte exequimur, quod peccatū imperat.
                      that then sinne raigneth, when that which sinne lusteth, willeth or commandeth is readily obeyed & done without controulement. The Apostle likeneth sinne to a Monarch or Emperour, whose lusts are lawes and commands, the yeelding whereunto by ready obedience, is the suffering of sinne to play the Rex. There are foure steps, whereby sinne climeth into his throne, that it may raigne in a man.
                  The first is ignorance of the commandements, which  shew and reueale sinne,Hovv sinne getteth a kingdom when any doe not know what is displeasing to God, and what will please him, eyther because they are not taught, ot care not to learne, or if they haue some knowledge of the law, it is confused, and without application: of the former it is true which is commonly said: the blinde eate many a flye: and of the latter, that is verrified, As good neuer a whit as neuer the better.
                  
                  The second step is distrust of heart, or vnbeliefe, when  God is not belieued and credited in his word of threatning and promises, and in respect of these two, blindnes of mind and incredulitie, the kingdome of sinne is called a kingdom of darknesse:
                        Radix omnium vitiorum infidelitas.
                      sinne may doe any thing where Gods word is distrusted. Let faith of the word be shaken out of the

heart, then looke what sinne will commaund it is presently done, whereof there is lamentable experience in the fall of our first parents: when they were once won to this, but to doubt of Gods threatning, ye know what followed, they became vassals to sinne and Sathan.
                  The third step is custome in sinne, whereby the sense of sinne is lost. Physitions say, that diseases not lookt to in the beginning, doe afterwards in time grow incurable and desperate.

                      Phylosophers teach that custome is another nature, and that of many actions there ariseth an habit, and Deuines affirme that by often practise of sinne, the very feeling of sinne is taken away, & when men are blinded by ignorance and vnbeliefe and withall hardned by custome of sinne, it will be as easie for sinne to lead such whither it will, as it was for Elisha to lead the armie of the Aramites whither hee thought good, being stricken with blindnesse. 2 King. 6.19.
                  The fourth step is securitie, whereby the danger of sinne is neyther feared nor suspected, as in such men, who haue made a league with death, and a couenant with hell; and when it commeth to this, then is sinne in the roofe and at the height: for such as once waxe secure in sinne, and though they sin often and grieuously, yet are they without all feare of Gods threatnings and iudgements, presuming and bearing themselues bold vpon his goodnesse and lenitie, they will excuse sinne in themselues, and defend sinne in others: they neyther in themselues resist sinne, nor can abide others to reprooue their sinne, but hate them rather, yea, and appoint praises and reward to sinners, as Rom. 1.31. they sinne and fauour such as doe it. Thus wee see what it is for sinne to raigne in our bodyes, and how it commeth to his kingdome.
                  And here this is first of all to be noted, that the Apostle saith not, let not sinne be in you, but let it not raigne in you: for it is impossible that sin should not at all, be in vs, for besides the testimonie of euery mans conscience against himselfe accusing him of sinne, and the manifold iudgements of God against all sorts of sinners in this life, wee haue the

Scriptures in very many places affirming that none can be without sinne in this world;
                        Beatitudo nostra non in perfectione virtutum, sed in remissione peccatorum. Bernard. our blessednesse standing not in being voide of all sinne, but in hauing our sinnes forgiuen vs, Psal. 32.1. and hee being the best man not that hath no sinne, but the fewest sinnes. This exhortation then is like to that prayer of the Prophet Dauid, in the 19. Psalme, Lord deliuer me from presumptuous sinnes, let them not raigne ouer me: Also like to that other prayer of his, in the 119. Psalme, Let not sinne get dominion ouer me: And to that petition in the Lords Prayer, which is not, Lord tempt vs not, but Lord lead vs not into temptation, that is, giue vs not vp to be carryed away as captiues to sin and Sathan: So here we are exhorted not to cleare and quit our selues from sinne, but that we suffer it not to raigne ouer vs, to hold vs as vassals subiect to his beck.
                  It may be thought that this exhortaion is superfluous, because in the regenerate sinne cannot raigne, and in the vnregenerate it cannot but raigne. The answere hereunto is, first generally, that the whole word of God is inspired from aboue, and is profitable to teach, &c. 2. Tim. 3.16. and secondly, for this exhortation, a part of the word, it is behouefull for all sorts of men: for touching the vnregenerate which yet are vnder the power of sinne, if they be not elect, this and such like exhortations will take from them all excuse, so as they shall be vnable to alledge for themselues that they were not called vpon to resist sinne: and for such vnregenerate as be of the elect, this exhortation will serue to prouoke them to abstaine from the outward act and work of sinne, which is in their power to do, euen by the strength of restraining grace, the which preuaileth in many naturall men, not onely to keepe them from externall euill actions, but to the staying somewhat of the inward rage of sinne, though they cannot kill it at the roote, for lack of reforming grace. And least of all may this exhortation be held vnprofitable for such elect as be already regenerate, who are greatly holpen to the mortification of sin by the work of the spirit, through this word of exhortation. Wee are

taught from the word, that such as once receiue the grace of regeneration, though they may grieuously fall, yet that it is vnpossible they should fall away; because the seed whereof they are begotten anew is immortall and permanent, 1. Pet. 1.23. And Christ Iesus which prayed for Peters perseuerance in grace, hath prayed for the stabilitie of all true beleeuers: Iohn. 17.20.21. Yet that exhortation in Rom. 9. Let him that standeth, take heede least hee fall: and that Phil. 2. Worke out your saluation in feare and trembling is not in vaine for them, because it may moue them to feare and vvatchfulnesse, which is one meane whereby they stand. In like manner albeit sinne cannot euer haue dominion in the elect, being once effectually called and turned to God, yet it is good for them to be called vpon, to resist and striue against the raigne of sinne, because by such exhortations being blessed from heauen, and put in practise, the course of sinning is stopped in them, and the strength of sinne daily lessened and abated, till it be wholy abolished and brought to nothing.
                  Moreouer obserue from this exhortation of our Apostle, that it is the dutie and part of euery faithfull man and woman, to take paines to preserue and encrease their owne mortification, and that they may not looke that Christ and his grace will beare and carry them through against all assaults of their sinfull lusts: without their owne care, trauaile and endeauour, and this is the very thing which is here called, for that they be helpers to the grace of Christ in the suppressing of sinne, for howsoeuer in our first conuersion wee are meere patients, not working any thing toward it, onely suffering the spirit to worke that blessed change and conuersion of our soules to God, and howsoeuer it is the grace of God which still doth all our workes for vs, the beginning, middle or end of our sanctification, being from grace, which both beginneth and finisheth, yet the grace of God worketh not in those which lye asleepe and snort in their sinnes being carelesse and idle, but in them which put to their owne care and diligence; as in husbandry all the

encrease is from God, the earth fructifieth by his blessing, yet God vseth the hand of the husbandmen in plowing, sowing and manuring the ground: and albeit in warre the victory dependeth vpon God, yet as Paul said in the Acts,
                     
                        Acts 27. 
                     Except these Mariners stay in the shippe we cannot be safe, so men may say in time of battaile, Except the warriours doe their parts, wee cannot looke to ouercome: Thus it is here, howsoeuer the power which beateth down and keepeth vnder the strength of sinne be diuine, and it is Gods grace that doth all,
                        Phil. 2. the power both to will and to do is from him, without whom wee can doe nothing; yet so as we are not to expect that Christ should giue vs victorie ouer sinne, if wee sit still and doe nothing; here is that true; Hee that made thee without thee,
                     
                        Qui fecit te sin
                              •
                            te, non seruat

                     doth not saue thee without thee. Hence it is, that wee are so often exhorted in sundry formes of words to put to our hand and helpe, as to giue all diligence to labour to stirre vp the grace of God, To mortifie our earthly members, To cast away from vs the works of darknesse, To put on the armour of light, &c. and here let not sinne raigne in you: to admonish vs that our God though himselfe effect all good in vs, and hinder all euill, yet hee is pleased to vse vs as fellow workers with his grace, as instruments and meanes of our owne good, and keeping of euill things from vs; for though in our regeneration we are meer patients, non agimus, sed agimur, yet in the practise of regeneration, wee must be agents, agimur & agimus.
                  
                  After these things thus opened and deliuered, wee are now to see and consider for what reasons all beleeuing christians stand bound to embrace this exhortation, and as the Apostle Heb. 11. hauing alledged innumerable examples to shew the propertie and power of faith, in the beginning of the 12. Chapter, saith, we are compassed about with a cloud of witnesses, so I may say of this duety here exhorted vnto, that it hath a cloud of reaso

                      to enforce it, I meane, to presse vs forward vnto the resistance of sinne, to keepe it from exercising rule and kingdome in vs.
                  These reasons, some of them grow without the Text

which wee will draw hither, and some are bred within this our Scripture.

                     Of forraine reasons the first is, the certaine hope of victory if wee resist sinne in the temptations thereof: for certaine it is vpon the word of our Apostle, verse 14. that sin cannot raigne if it be resisted. Sinne shall not haue dominion ouer you: for beleeuing Christians they are vnder grace, both their sinnes past are gratiously forgiuen them for Christs death, and they haue the grace and aid of his spirit, to strengthen them against euill desires and lusts for the time to come, so as if ye doe your owne best endeauour sin cannot raigne ouer you, but you shall domineire ouer it. Therfore as Souldiours doe fight more couragiously where they haue but likelihood and hope of victory, this animates and whets their stomack to battell, how much more ought yee to striue against sin, being before hand assured to ouercome, so ye striue lawfully.

                      it is mortified and dead, Rom. 7.6. that being dead in which we were holden, sinne hath already receiued from the death of Christ, such a deadly blow, that though it draw breath and stirre, yet it cannot recouer former strength, but remaines as a man wounded to death. Insomuch as it was easie for Dauid to kill Goliah, to cut off his head, when by the stone cast out of his sling hee had already amazed and

your selues like men, be strong in the Lord & in the power of his might, and let not sinne raigne ouer you. Thirdly,3. Reason. call yee to minde, when ye were the seruants of sinne, how yee endeauoured to doe the will of sinne, then taking part with your lusts against Christ, and setting your selues with might and maine, tooth and nayle (as wee say) against the kingdome of grace,
                        Rom. 6.19. 
                     giuing your members as weapons of iniquitie to commit iniquitie, is it not equall and most reasonable, that being now freed by grace from the tyrannie of sinne, and become the seruants of Christ, yee should with all your might endeauour to hinder and pull downe the kingdome of sinne in others, especially in your selues; and with great care and labour striue to please and serue your new Lord, giuing your members, that is, the faculties of your soule; & organs of your bodies, as weapons of righteousnesse to holinesse? Were it not a great shame now ye are brought vnto such a king as Christ, so glorious in himselfe, to you so gratious, which hath done such things for you already as to quit you from the guilt of sinne by remission, from the dominion of sinne by mortification, and from whom ye expect such and so great things in heauen, were it not a great fault and reproach to be lesse willing and diligent in performing his will, then yee were to execute the lusts of sin, whiles ye were vnder it? Moreouer what a matter were it, if being deliuered from such a tyrant as sin is, whose bondage is a thousand times worse then the bondage of Aegypt, which was bodily and temporary, this being spirituall and tending to eternall ruine, if ye should suffer it againe to vsurpe and get an hand ouer you for lacke of resistance? What prisoner ransomed from slauery of Turke or other, would be so vnthankfull to his ransomer, or so harmefull to himselfe, as to returne backward to his former cruell Lord? and let it be farre from you which are by Christ drawne out of the hands and power of sinne, once to looke backe againe, but now yee are free from sinne, and become the seruants of righteousnesse, encourage your selues to depart more and more from the damnable workes of sin, to doe

the honourable workes of righteousnesse, and so much the rather, seeing of sinne and the seruice thereof no other fruit but shame,

                      as for sinners which liue in the seruice and practise of sinne, God heareth them not, that is, hee neglecteth them in their necessities and dangers, yea, though they call vpon him, yet hee denyeth them his protection and succour, and what a matter this is may partly be conceyued by those who are out of the protection of their temporall Kings, such are exposed so innumeble inconueniences and mischiefes, better not to liue at all, then not to liue vnder the Kings protection: Euen so the sinner that serueth sin as his king, hee loosing the protection of the King of heauen, lyeth open to the malice of Sathan, euery moment to be deuoured and destroyed of that roaring Lyon. And adde hereunto that by seruing sinne we loose all the merits of Christ the Sonne: for when the Apostle writeth to Titus. 2.11. that Christ hath redeemed vs from all iniquitie, and telleth vs, that this is the end and purchase of his passion, that we should be zealous of good works, and Peter likewise,
                        
                           〈…〉
                         24. that Christ bare our sinnes in his body, that wee should dye to sinne and liue in righteousnesse: hence it plainely appeareth, that whosoeuer licentiously cherishing their sinfull lusts and abandoning the care of a godly

life doe serue sinne, they voyde themselues (as much as in them is) of the vertue and power of his death, and of all the merits of his passion, both touching iustification and sanctification. And as this is no small thing, so yet consider further that whatsoeuer they be that through not striuing against sinne, shall subiect themselues vnto the raigne and power of it, they depriue themselues of the comfortable working of the spirit; for where the good motions of his grace are repelled, and sin followed, there the spirit is grieued and quenched, euen as water cast vpon fire slaketh and putteth it out; and as a guest is driuen from that Inne where hee is not regarded, but basely intreated: so the spirit will not there abide, where the lusts of sinne are intertained, and his owne inspirations reiected. Vnto all these former reasons ioyne these considerations, that if ye should start from Christ to goe after your lusts and put the bridle againe into the hands of sinne, yee shall breake and violate first your vow and promise made vnto God in your Baptisme, and afterwards renued in the Lords Supper,
                        Eccles. 5.5. and better were it neuer to haue made vow, then not to keepe it: also ye make your selues vnfit to doe any good eyther to God or men, nay, yee defile all your actions both naturall, ciuill, and religious, all which become vncleane and odious to God, if your selues be vncleane through sinne: for as in the Law, holy flesh was polluted by touching a person polluted with any ceremonial vncleannesse; so whatsoeuer commeth from a person spiritually polluted, whose minde and conscience is vncleane, it is all hatefull to God and abhominable.
                  But we are entred into an Ocean of matter, which would quickly ouer-flow the bancke of a Sermon, if wee should not obserue some meane, therfore to leaue the further search of reasons, scattered euery where in this present Chapter, & else where in Scripture, let vs attend now to the reasons couched in this present text, which are but two: the former reason is contained in the particle (Therefore) which implieth thus much, that sithens Christ hath put in vs his grace of sanctification, to crucifie our sinfull nature, (as hee had

taught before) therefore let vs not be wanting to our selues, to whom Christ hath not beene wanting, if he hath already broken the yoke and strength of sinne by his death, now it is pulled downe, let vs keepe it downe, and neuer suffer it to arise and get head againe. When Dauid had smitten Goliah to the ground, hee presently runne vpon him, drew out his sword and beheaded him: likewise Christ hauing subdued vnto vs our sinne by his vertue, let vs doe our part & fall vpon it, take it by the throate, stifle and choake it, neuer leaue it till wee haue driuen out the breath of sinne. It was the fault of the Israelites that God hauing put them in possession of a good land and destroyed many of the inhabitants, daunting the rest, they by their negligence and cowardise did not prosecute these good beginnings, but suffering the Cananites to liue amongst them, they proued thornes in their sides, and prickes in their eyes; euen so it will come passe, if you foreslow the continuall mortifying of sinne, which Christ hath already conquered in you, and disarmed, if ye make way and giue place to remayning lusts and euill affections, they will proue tedious and perillous: therefore let not sinne raigne.

                        hy so called.Finally, this must encourage vs to flye the seruice of sinne, and mightily to striue against it, because our bodyes being mortall, that is, subiect to mortalitie and death, the strife against sinne will quickly be at an end. And surely, this may encourage any good Christian to resist sinne seriously to consider that we are mortall here, where sinne doth assault vs, and that there wee shall be immortall, where wee shall be free from sinne: as wee would not be mortall then, when sinne shall not hurt vs, so we would not be immortall here, where we are subiect to sinne.
                  Let this meditation then helpe vs against the lusts of sinne, that wee are not like to wrestle long with it; for our yeares may lack moneths, our moneths may lacke weekes, our weekes may lacke dayes, our dayes may lacke houres, our houres may lacke minutes. Doe wee not know by Scripture, that death stealeth vpon vs as trauaile vpon a

woman, or as a theefe in the night, which giueth no warning? and experience sheweth the truth of this plentifully: Hee in the Gospell that boasted of store for many yeares, was threatned to haue his soule taken from him that night; two in London dyed sodainely as they walked in the streets; also one found dead in the fields at Allington, who went well out of his house at Douer; likewise one dyed in his sleep who went well to bed; in the citie of Canterbury one well and abroad at eight of the clock, and dead by ten

                      and euen in this Church one fell downe dead, betweene the great gate and the porch: the Kings court is not free from such examples of suddaine death.
                  Now seeing that that which falleth to any one,
                        Quod cuiquam, cuiuis contingere potest.
                      may fall to euery one, it is wisedome for all men to make a short account, and so much the more to labour mortification of sinne, by how much this mortalitie is certaine, and the time vncertaine: and yet such dulnesse is in vs that wee are so far from thinking of the sodainnesse of our death, and shortnes of life, as that wee seldome remember that wee shall dye; wherein our forgetfulnesse is more blame worthy, because euery thing serueth to put vs in mind that our bodyes which we beare about vs are mortall: for euen on our table wee haue monuments of death; for we eate not the creatures till they be dead; our garments are eyther the skins or excrements of dead beasts, we often follow the dead corps to the graue, and wee often walke ouer their bodyes: and in this place especially, men that vse to walke here shall do well to remember that they tread vpon the dead, and others shortly must tread vpon them. Moreouer, wee in this Citie haue almost euery day death roung in our eares, the deadly knell telling vs that dust we are, and to dust we must goe. Lastly, our nightly sleepe being to vs a shadow and resemblance of death, yet for all this men liue as if they were immortall, drowned in worldly pleasures, and carnall delights, because they doe not seriously remember their last end, which if it were carefully thought vpon, it would mightely preuaile to keepe men from doing amisse, causing them to imitate that

good seruant in the Gospell who knowing his maister would come, yet not knowing at what houre in the night, hee girded his loynes and kept his lampe burning, that hee might be found ready when his maister should come: wherof we haue a good example in this Gentlewoman our sister, to whom as it pleased God in the weaknesse of body, to giue her a remembrance of her mortalitie and end before it came: so shee receiued grace to make true vse for dying to sinne, and liuing to God; shee spent her time during her sicknesse, as I haue beene credibly certified, in reading, praier, and good meditations, and at her end (as my selfe was a witnesse) she applyed the sentences and promises of Scripture to her owne soules comfort, praying with the Church, Lord Iesus come quickly,

And with Dauid professing that as the Hart panted after the riuers of water; so her soule longed after God, and laying hold on Christs promises, that shee should be satisfied because shee mourned for her sinnes, assuring her heart according to that that was pronounced to Paul, that howsoeuer she was weake, yet the grace of Christ should be sufficient for her, and that by the power of his might shee should ouercome and finde death to be her aduantage. Thus continuing in holy motions and good speeches, till her soule remouing from her earthly tabernacle, was receiued into the heauenly inheritance (as we may trust) there to raigne with Christ for euer. Thus farre of the exhortation, not to suffer sinne to raigne, the first part of our Text.

                     THese words contain the second part of our Text, which is the explication, declaring to vs how this may be brought to passe, namely, by withdrawing obedience from the lusts thereof. Where first of all, there be two words to be interpreted. Lusts, and Obedience.

                            heauenly things are desired. 3. Carnall, vvhen things forbid of God are desired. Lust is that stirring of our naturall

corruption, egging and soliciting vs against the will and Law of God, or the first motion of our sinfull corrupt nature: for it is here distinguished from sinne, to shew that here lust is not the roote, but the fruit. Whereas he speaketh in the plurall number, not lust, but lusts, it is because the motions or desires of our depraued nature, are of sundry kindes; some are the will of the minde, so called Eph. 2.3. as errours, heresies, false opinions, wicked conceits, euill imaginations, corrupt reasonings, wicked counsels, deuises and thoughts eyther against God, or men, or our selues: some are the will of the flesh, thus tearmed in the former place, Ephes. 2.3. whereby is meant all the euill affections which be in our vnreasonable part, in our will, appetite and senses; as anger, pride, couetousnesse, enuy, reuenge, contention, and such like. And 2. Cor. 7.1. these lusts are deuided into lusts of the flesh, and the spirit, where flesh being set against spirit, is eyther the body or the inferiour part of the soule; and spirit signifieth the principall facultie of the vnderstanding and reason; all which are corrupted by sinne, and haue their seuerall lusts. Which as they be sundry and not of one sort, so are they very many.
                           Col. 3.8.9. 1 Cor. 6.9.10. Rom. 1.29.30.31 
                        Gal. 5.19 The workes of the flesh are manifest, as Adulterie, &c.
                     
                     To obey these lusts, it is willingly to goe after them, and of our owne accord in our wils and workes to follow euill motions, which when it is done of vs, then wee doe (as it were) put a scepter into the hands of sinne, that it may as a king subdue vs and raigne ouer vs. Thus all hypocrites and wicked men doe obey sinne, freely seruing it as their Lord, whiles they doe in their will consent to the lusts of sinne, and in outward worke commit it as occasions be offered. Wee are here commaunded not to doe thus, but contrariwise to disobey, or not to obey any sinfull motion or affection eyther by consent of will, or by committing them in deeds.
                     The thing then which here is taught vs,A notable meane hovv to hinder the kingdom of sin. it is an excellent meane how to keepe sinne from raigning ouer vs, euen this, to withdraw our obedience from sin, in our will & hart

resisting the first motions of our rebellious nature: and this certainely is a speciall point of Christian wisedome, by the grace which is in vs to striue against the first mouings and ticklings of sinne,

                     Men will looke to the beginnings of hurt in their body, to prouide remedie for a wound or sore before it do fester or rancle: and while a disease is but now fresh they looke out for medicines: the like or greater care would be taken of the soule, euen at the first betimes, and while sin doth begin to stir then to oppose vnto it and make head against it, applying remedies before the euill by continuance grow desperate and incurable: herein finally, imitating the practise of warriours, who espy aduantages to take their enimies while they are yet weake, before their forces be ioyned, and their powers come together; in like manner the Christian

Souldiour ought to set vpon sinne while it is yet weake, and hath least strength, ere by our obedience to it, and practise of it, it growes to a power, when it will proue a more troublesome and tough peece of worke to quell and keepe it downe. That therefore which the spirit pronounceth in the 137. Psalme, to encourage Gods people against the Babilonians their most pernicious enimies: Blessed is he that shall take their children whiles they are young, to dash their braines against the stones: the same I say to all the Israel of GOD which is in continuall conflict with the Babilon of their confused lusts: blessed and happy is the man that whiles they are but budding, can nip them in the head, and by the might of grace dwelling in him doth speedily crush them; thus it will come to passe that hee shall not obey sin, by doing that euill which sinne would haue done.
                     Now this way and meanes commended here in the text, hath sundry vnder meanes as helpe vnto it, that the grace whereby we resist the lusts of sinne may be strengthened and enabled to this resistance.Word of God. The first of these is the Word of God, rightly vnderstood: for Dagon can no more stand before the Arke, then sinne can stand before the word of God, being planted in a faithfull heart, and applyed against the stirrings of sinne. Therefore as Christ repelled the suggestions of Sathan by this word of God: Mat. 4.5. so are all Christians to beate backe the motions of sinne by the same means, & by the two edged sword of the spirit, which is sharpe, to cut asunder the sinewes and heart-strings of sin. See then yee haue this word alwayes in readinesse to draw it out vpon all occasions, whensoeuer yee feele your selues to be tempted by any sinne: be not like vnto them that carry about them a sword and know not how to vse it, but put the word vnto vse, and as oft as any motions of sinne arise, presently call to minde such Scriptures as forbid, threaten, and condemne them, remembring also such examples of such iudgements as haue beene executed vpon such sinnes as yee be tempted vnto, that yee may inure your heart not onely to hate and abhor, but to tremble at the thought and

cogitation of sinne.

                        my selfe proue a cast away: 1. Cor. 9.27. where the word which the Apostle vseth, importeth as much as to beat downe with clubs, to note the great obstinacie of sinne, and the great endeauour which is to be vsed that the lusts of it, may be suppressed and kept downe. And how conuenient an helpe fasting is for that purpose, and certainly as a moderation in eating, and drinking, and other lawfull pleasures of life, when there is a meane kept in the vse of them, that wee temper our selues, rather comming short of that we may wel haue, then going so far as our ability & the

custome of the place where wee liue will suffer vs, as I say this continuall and dayly sobrietie is no little helpe to the mortification of our sinnes: so the vtter abstinence from all delights of life for a certaine time, as for the space of one day in a weeke or fortnight, is a very good meanes for the furtherance of this worke in vs, if diligent reading of Scriptures, godly meditations, and earnest prayers be coupled therewith:1 Cor. 9. 1 Tim. 5.23. for if such excellent and rare men as Paul and Timothy, had need to vse such moderation & abstinence for the subduing of sinne, shall any man thinke that hee can want these meanes, and be in good case, or that he shal not tempt God if he neglect them?
                     But amongst other things wee are not to forget the fellowship of the brethren;Brotherly fellovvship. by whose admonitions and prayers wee may be much confirmed against the power of sinne: therefore wee are commanded to loue God and to loue brotherly fellowship.
                        1 Pet. 2.17. The Apostle Iames would not charge vs to confesse our sinnes one to another, and to pray one for another, Iames. 5.16. vnlesse in the counsell,
                           Iames 5.16. comforts and prayers of the Godly, there were great helpe against the strength of sinne: neyther would the Authour of the Epistle to the Hebrewes, exhort vs to consider one of another, to whet on to charitie and good workes, if there were not a blessing giuen to the right vse of such means, for the staying vs in euery good dutie, and causing vs still to goe forwards in our workes of sanctification. As it fareth with brands or coales when they are almost extinct and put out, by laying them close together, the fire is kept in and made the hotter: so by the conferring of graces mutually by Gods children to the strengthening one of another, their zeale against sin and for God is kept aliue and more encreased. And to giue you another similitude; as they who haue a iourney to go in a way which is vnknowne, are glad to ioyne themselues to such as are expert in the way: so the fellowship and conuersation of such as are well acquainted with the pathes which lead to our celestiall countrie, doth much further vs in our spirituall wayfaring. Therefore if ye desire to get to your

selues an especiall aduantage against sinne, and a blessed meane to guide and confirme you against all whatsoeuer hinderances in your way, see yee euer make conscience as on the one side of eschewing all needless

                        But ye are here to be aduertised that it is not sufficient to vse all these good meanes against inward lusts and motions of sinne, there must also be a very great care and earnest purpose of auoyding the outward occasions wherby these lusts are raised and stirred vp in vs. The obedience to sinne is very much crossed and letted by our carefull remouing and shunning of such occasions as wee are wont to be prouoked by vnto euill: therefore let the proud man auoyde flattery, and foolish praises; the drunkard strong drinke; the glutton delicates; the couetous let him auoid the often sight and much fingring of money; let not the angry man meddle much with contentious persons & such as loue contradiction; nor the fearefull man come amongst threatners; nor such as cannot yet rule their tongue amongst such as are giuen to much talke; nor the effeminate amongst wantons: at a word, Whosoeuer will no euill doe, must refraine whatsoeuer belongeth thereto. Remember Ioseph, hee would not endure eyther the speach or company of his lewd alluring Mistresse; and it had beene good for Peter that hee had not come into the high Priests hall; and for Dauid he had not so wantonly cast his eye vpon faire Bathsheba. One saith truely, occasion maketh a theefe, and occasion will make an adulterer, a lyer, a rayler, and so in other sinnes, they are drawn on by occasions: it is therfore to no great purpose to warre against inward

except we watch ouer our selues to beware and flie the outward occasions of sinne.

                  THE SECOND SERmon: called The Perseuerance of the Saints, Preached on the 29. of Ianuarie. 1608.
                  
                     
                        Psalme. 15. Verse. 7.
                        
                        Hee that doth these things shall neuer be remoued.
                     
                  
                  
                     THis short sentence is the conclusion of the whole Psalme, and containeth both the substance of the Psalme: Hee that doth these  things: and a gratious promise annexed; shall neuer be remoued.
                     
                  
                  First, vnto the substance of the Psalme belongeth a question and an answere: the question is propounded in the first Verse, O Lord who shall dwell in thy Tabernacle? that is to say, O Lord, whereas there be many that resort vnto thy Tabernacle to worship thee, certifie me who they are which be thy true worshippers, whom thou wilt account to be members of thy Church militant in earth, and triumphant in heauen.
                  This is the greatest question in all diuinitie, for though there be other questions of deeper search, yet of all other this question is of greatest vse and consequence. The reason that caused Dauid to moue this question was this, hee marked many to frequent the Temple to worship, which yet proued but hypocrites, therefore very worthily he enquired of God, the iudge of the heart, by what tokens his sound worshippers and seruants might be knowne.
                  
                     Secondly, the answere beginneth at the second Verse, which containeth a full description of true worshippers, by three essentiall vnseparable notes, to wit: first, Integritie: secondly, Innocencie: thirdly, Veritie; vnto which three graces are referred all the particular duties in the Verses following.

                           〈◊〉
                         Verse.Now in this seuenth Verse hee concludeth, and the effect of his conclusion is thus much, as if hee should haue sayd: Whosoeuer hee be that embraceth vprightnesse. innocency and truth, hee is the true worshipper of God, so stedfastly rooted in the Church here vpon earth, as when the course of this present life is ended, hee shall remaine for euer a Citizen in heauen: He that doth these things shall neuer be moued.
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           〈1 paragraph〉
                        
                     The doctrines which arise from this Verse are two: the formost is this, The blessed estate of the true worshippers of God is certaine and vnchangeable, from which they shall neuer be remoued: the second doctrine is, who be these true worshippers and how to be knowne. The first doctrine is built vpon many vndoubted grounds: the first ground is from the Authoritie of Scripture, expresly affirming this truth in many places,
                        
                           〈1 paragraph〉
                        
                      
                     Psal. 1.6. The Lord knoweth the way of the righteous, and the way of the wicked shall perish. Psalme. 37.24.Though the righteous fall, hee shall not be cast off, for the Lord puts vnder his hand. Also Psalme 125. Hee that trusts in the Lord shall be like mount Sion, that cannot be remoued: Also Salomon saith in his Prouerbs: The hope of the righteous shall not perish: And to be short, in the 54. of Isaiah the Lord hath sworne to his people by an oath, that with euerlasting loue hee hath embraced them. Wee see in these Scriptures that God hath passed for the stablenesse of his people, not his single word onely, but his promise, which is his double word, and if this be not strong enough, it hath pleased him for more surety to adde his oath, a three-fold corde which cannot be broken.
                  The second ground is Gods free election, vpon which the firme stedfastnesse of the faithfull is grounded, as vpon a sure rocke and mountaine of brasse
                        •
                      which causeth our

Sauiour Christ to say,Simile. that it was not possible for the Elect to be deceiued. Mat. 24. True it is that in some things the elect may be deceiued, and for some time: but to be deceiued vniuersally, and for euer, that is not possible. And in the 8. to the Romanes, Paul respecting the constancie of Gods election, auoucheth of the predestinate, that they must be glorified. Rom. 8.30. Moreouer in the 2. Tim. 2.19. hauing spoken of Hymineus and Phyletus, which themselues denyed the faith, and destroyed the faith of others, by saying the Resurrection is past, the Apostle fearing least some beleeuers of weake mindes should be troubled to heare two such pillers of the Church to be shaken: hee doth comfort them with this perswasion, that their owne standing is firme because of Gods election, which for the assurance and certaintie of it is there likened to a foundation and a seale: two such things then which amongst men there is no stronger,Simile. 
                     The foundation (saith he) of God is sure, hauing his seale: the Lord knoweth who are his.
                  
                  The third ground is the free and vnchangeable couenant that God hath stricke with his elect touching grace and saluation by Christ. The tenour whereof is to be found in Ieremie.
                      32.38.39. & 40. verses, And I will make an euerlasting couenant with them, that I will neuer turne away from them to doe them good, but I will put my feare into their hearts, that they shall not depart from me, (saith the Lord.) These are the words of the couenant, from which obserue two things: the first is, that hee cals it an euerlasting couenant: which teacheth that it is not made for houres, dayes, weeks, moneths, yeares, or any tearme of time, but for all eternitie. The second is the meanes how this couenant becomes euerlasting, because it is euery way sure and constant both on Gods part who neuer altereth his good will towards his chosen people; and on his peoples part, who haue their hearts so seasoned with his feare as they can neuer haue a will to depart from him. This third ground from the couenant is further strengthened with the consideration of gods infinit power and truth, which maketh him able and carefull

to performe vnto the elect his most mercifull couenant: Thus Abraham assured himselfe of the fruit of Gods couenant, looking to the power of God, who was able to doe what he promised▪ 
                     Rom. 4.21. And Paul 1. Cor. 1.9. confirmeth the mindes of the godly by the truth of God, faithfull is he who promiseth, and he will doe it.
                  The fourth ground is the intercession of Christ, who as  by his death he purchased for the elect Gods fauour, so by his prayer he keepeth them for euer in his fauour: thus hee prayed for Peter that his faith might not faile, Luke. 22.32. So in Iohn the 17. he prayeth not only for Peter & the other Apostles, but for all that should beleeue their doctrine to the end of the world, that they might be kept to euerlasting life. Whereof it followeth necessarily that the true children of God must for euer stand in the fauour of God vnremoued, or else the prayer of our Lord Iesus Christ must be vnheard and cast out, which were great wickednes once to imagine: especially seeing Christ himselfe hath said, Father I know thou hearest me alwaies. Iohn. 11.42.
                  
                      The fift ground is the nature of spirituall and sauing grace, which is permanent and not subiect to corruption, as appeareth by the words of our Sauiour, Iohn 14. my Ioy shall none take from you. Also in the 16. verse he saith, my spirit which I giue to you shall abide with you for euer. And Saint Peter in his first Epistle 1.13. calleth the seed whereof we are begotten anew, immortall seede: and Saint Iohn saith, it remayneth in them which are borne anew: and Saint Paul saith, that the gifts of God are without repentance, Rom. 11. All which places doe serue to teach vs thus much; that the sauing grace of God is of an incorruptible nature, such as neuer dyeth where it once quickneth. The reason whereof is, because God who giueth it doth still preserue and confirme it, as it is written, Iude 1. sanctified of God the Father, and reserued to Iesus Christ. Which sheweth that whom God sanctifieth by one grace, he confirmeth by another.
                  They therefore are deceiued which thinke that the grace of God though it cannot finally be lost and for euer yee

that it may be lost wholy for a time, whereas contrariwise the Apostle teacheth in the sixt to the Romanes, that the elect hauing once the life of grace from the spirit of Christ can no more returne to the death of sinne, then Christ being raised from the dead can returne to the graue againe, verse 9.10.11. reade and consider the place.
                  Besides all these grounds already named, there remaine some other, as the constancie of the loue of God, who neuer  reicteth nor casteth out such as once in loue hee embraceth. Iohn 13.1. Moreouer the faithfull are committed  of the father to Christ to be kept, who being stronger then all, none can plucke them out of his hands. Iohn. 10.28. Our saluation was once in our owne keeping for it was committed vnto Adam, who quickly lost it, but now God hauing trusted his sonne with it, and made him the gardian of it, it is in a most sure hand: for he being both almightie & faithfull, can and will saue all that be of his father committed to him, as himselfe saith, I will raise them vp at the last day and giue them eternall life. Finally, it cannot be that any of  Gods children can be lost, but that the truth, power, and good will of God must be called in question; for if any of them should perish, it must be for that God regardeth not his promise, or is not able to keepe it, or vnwilling to performe it.
                  This stedfast condition of Gods children besides these substantiall grounds of it fetched from the word, it is also in the same word illustrated and set forth by many sensible and fit similitudes.Simile. The first is of a tree planted by the riuers of water, which hath such continuall supply of plentifull  moysture, as that neither leafe nor fruit doth euer fade. Psalme 1.2. The second is of a Cedar in Libanon, which as  it is tall for height, and mighty in strength, so it is lasting for continuance: long it is before it beare fruit, but when it beginneth to beare, it beareth very long, and the longer it continueth the more fruit it beareth: so it fareth with the children of God, as it is written. Psal. 92.12. Thirdly, of an huge, firme and vnpregnable mountaine, which by no engine

of warre, nor by any are or labour of man can be wonne and preuayled against: Such is the estate of him that trusts in God, Psalme 125.1.2. The last similitude is of an house built vpon a rocke, against which though the windes and waues doe blow and beat, yet it standeth sure, because it is founded vpon a rocke: so it is with euery one that heareth the word of GOD 
                        
                           〈◊〉

                        aid to

                         the vvord

                      and doth it; such shall be sore tempted and weather beaten, yet they shall neuer be remoued. Mat. 7.
                  Furthermore, the word that thus speaketh of the stedfastnesse of Gods true worshippers, doth also direct vs to the meanes by which they are maintained in it: and these are either publicke or priuate. The publike meanes are the ministry of the word and Sacraments,
                        
                           〈1 paragraph〉
                        
                      and prayer and discipline. The priuate meanes are priuate prayer, meditation and reading, fellowship of the godly, conference, and carefull practise of the word. By these meanes vsed and followed with sinceritie, humilitie, and vnwearied constancie, it pleaseth the most mercifull God to keepe all his children from falling away though they take some deepe and dreadfull fals.
                  Now it will be requisite briefly to answere some such obiections as are made against this doctrine, which is much gainesaid, as all other diuine truth is: the truth of the word being herein like the word, the truth, Christ I meane, who was spoken against by sinners.
                  These obiections are either first by examples of the Saints: secondly, by texts of Scripture: or thirdly, by shew of  reason. The first example is of Salomon, he being once a true worshipper of God, he felt so grieuously from piesie to idolatry, from temperance to wantonnesse from God to pleasure, as that some haue thought, yea spoken, and written that he perished. To this we answer
                        •
                     , it is true he fell most grieuously, and did long lye

                      his sinne 
                        〈◊〉
                      it is also more then likely to be true 
                        〈…〉
                      in his sin, but recouered himself 
                        〈…〉
                      these few 
                        〈…〉
                     
                  
                  
                     First, that hee is of the holy Ghost intituled the beloued of God. 2. Samuell 12.24.25. which was neuer affirmed of any reprobate. Secondly, hee was one of the penmen of the Scripture, euen an holy Prophet: and of all the holy Prophets Christ saith they are set downe in the kingdome of God. Luke 13.28. Thirdly, Gods promise was made especially touching the person of Salomon, that howsoeuer his sinnes should be corrected with the rod of men, yet his mercy hee would neuer take from him, nor remoue his louing kindenesse. 2 Sam. 7. Fiftly, hee was by repentance restored to God and to his Church, and none can perish that truely repent. Now that Salomon repented may appeare both by the title of his Booke, called Ecclesiastes, which is as much to say,Thus Tremelius expoundeth it. as a person vnited againe to the Church vpon his repentance done and published in the Church: and by the argument of that Booke, which is a large condemning of those vanities wherewith he had been ouer-taken, and a plaine retractation of those follyes wherin hee had offended. And if Salomon were not wholy remoued from God; there is lesse doubt to be made of Dauid and Peter, because neyther their fall was so grieuous, for Salomon to other great sinnes added the grosse sinne of Idolatry, and yet their repentance is more certainely reuealed, the one in the 51. Psal. the other in the 27. Chapter of Mathew
                     ▪ of whom it is truely said by one of the Fathers, that faith did not faile in his heart, when the confession of it failed in his mouth. As for the remouings and fals of Esau, Saul, and Iudas, they appertaine nothing to this purpose, because they were but hypocrites, and neuer the true worshippers of God, and they fell onely from such gifts of the Spirit as were common both to the elect and reprobate.
                  The texts of Scripture that are brought in against this  truth are these, Heb. 6.4. Heb. 10.29. and Mat. 13. The words of Heb. 6. are these: For it cannot be that they which were once lightened and haue tasted of the heauenly gifts, and of the power of the power of the 
                           〈◊〉
                         to come, that they falling away should

be renued by repentance, &c. To this I answere, it is true such as tast onely, may; but the true beleeuer which eateth and digesteth, and receiueth the word cannot fall away. Now wheras the second text saith, that they which be sanctified by the bloud of Christ may fall away. The answere is this, the sanctification which the Apostle here speaketh of, is such a sanctification as standeth in profession onely, and not in power and practise, and worketh onely a light and slender change, which may be lost againe, and not an effectuall alteration of the minde and will, which being begun in this life, is perfected in the next, and so endureth for euer.
                        
                           〈1 paragraph〉
                        
                      And whereas the Apostle saith, they receiue the truth, hee meaneth that they receiue the knowledge of the truth by their iudgement and not by their affection, into the braine, and not into the heart. Now as for the ioy spoken of in Mat. 13. it is not to be meant of the fruit of the spirit, in a truely sanctified heart reioycing in the sense of Gods peculiar loue vnder the hope of his glory, Rom. 5. 2. but a tickling of the mind delighted with knowledge of new & strange things, which may be in an hypocrite and be lost.
                  
                      The shew of reason which is made against this doctrine of the vnmoueable estate of Gods children is this, that such doctrine will breede in men securitie and carelesse liuing. This is not so,
                        
                           〈1 paragraph〉
                        
                      because the Scripture which teacheth their stedfastnesse, doth also teach that their owne care & watchfulnesse is required thereunto: as in that saying of Paul, let him that standeth take heede least hee fall. 1. Cor. 10.12. and that in the 11. to the Romanes, Be not high minded but feare: also that in the Phil. 2.12. Worke out your saluation with feare and trembling: vnto these wee may ioyne the counsel of our Sauiour vnto his Apostles, that if they would be safe they must giue themselues to watch and pray. Mat. 26. And finally, the Apostle Iohn saith, that they that be borne anew, 
                     
                        
                           〈1 paragraph〉
                        
                      
                     preserue themselues. Iohn. 5.18. that is to say, they take all care, and vse all good endeauour for their owne preseruation. In all which places of Scripture it is manifest that whomsoeuer God hath purposed to keepe to himselfe

vnmoueable, in all them hee engendreth a great heedfulnesse to looke to themselues. But such as perish they are giuen ouer to grosse and dead securitie, not to feare any perill in the abundance of great sinnes.
                  It is now high time that wee come to the profit and vses that be to be made of this doctrine:Vse 1. whereof the first is to stirre vp our hearts vnto a very earnest desire to be in such a permanent and stedfast condition. In all other things wee doe loue certainties,Simile. and cannot abide to be at vncertaintyes: no Maister will keepe a seruant so, as hauing him to day, hee cannot be sure to haue him to morrow; neyther wil any man hold a farme as tenant at will, and look to be put out at an houres warning: all men prefer a fee-simple before an annuitie, and wish rather to haue a thing by perpetuitie then by tearme, and why then should wee not in matter of religion rather desire to be true worshippers of God, which shall abide for euer, then Christians in name and profession onely, which be alwayes at vncertaintie, liuing in continuall hazard, and exposed euery houre to some fearefull iudgement of God?Simile. being in this behalfe like vnto a condemned person, who hath receiued the sentence of death for high treason against his Prince, howsoeuer such an one may be spared and respited by the fauour of his Prince, yet he liueth at vncertainety and may looke euery houre when he shall be called forth to execution: euen thus it standeth with all vnsound Christians, Hypocrites, and wicked men, they are condemned persons both in gods decree, in the testimonie of Scripture, and in the witnesse of their owne conscience, though they marke not the check of it, and albeit the patience of God respite and spare them, and his bountie prosper them that they be fat and well liking, yet their state is vnsteddy, euer subiect to a downefall, hauing no other stay to vphold them but Gods lenitie and sufferance, the time whereof when it is expired, then sodainely in a moment they sincke into hell:Simile. though they flourished like a greene Bay-tree,
                        Psal. 37.36. and spread abroad then leaues, yet they vanish quickly and their place is no more

found: whereas the godly are so established as that in death they are not remoued,

                      but be more firmely and nearely knit vnto God thereby, with whom they enjoy a neuer withering blisse and glory. How should this moue all men most egerly to desire to be in so firme & certain estate, and neuer to giue themselues rest vntill they know themselues to be entred into it?
                        
                           〈1 paragraph〉
                        
                      that as Isaac in the 26. of Genesis hauing digged diuers wels to water his cattle, which he could not keep, because the people of that land stroue with him, and tooke them from him one after another, at the last digging a Well for which they did not striue, but suffered him quietly to enjoy it, hee found rest and was well satisfied, and acknowledging the Lords goodnesse (hee said,) Hee hath inlarged my roome, and will make me fruitfull: so we hauing lost much time in treading the pathes of an outward hypocriticall seruice of God, and at the length finding Christ and meeting with the way of true Christianitie, our soules may finde rest and be satisfied with it, saying: Praised be the Lord, hee hath brought me forth into a large roome, and set my feet vpon a rocke.
                  
                  
                      Secondly, this doctrine of stedfastnesse must prouoke such as be in so firme an estate;

                        nesse. humbly and heartily to thanke God for such a mercy, that when they blesse God for other things, as good health, food, libertie, peace, &c. they forget not to praise him for this, that hee hath set his seale vpon them, and hath put them in such an happy condition as shall neuer be remoued. When the Apostles of Christ were sent forth to preach, they reioyced that the diuels were subdued vnto them, but our Sauiour biddeth them reioyce in this rather, that their names were written in the Booke of life: teaching vs hereby, that howsoeuer there is great cause of ioy and thanksgiuing vnto God, when any one is made the meanes to pull any soule out of the snares of the Diuell, yet the chiefest cause of ioy and praise is herein, when any one vnderstandeth of himselfe, that hee is the Elect of God, and sure to be saued. Hereof wee have a notable president in the example of Paul, who being deliuered

from his wofull estate in which hee liued whilst hee was a blinde superstitious Pharisee, serued God in shewes and externall obseruations, and at length translated into this vnmoueable estate of faithfull worshippers of God, he brast forth into most thankfull acknowledgment of Gods goodnesse herein, Now (saith he) to the immortall and onely wise God be praise and honour for euer. 1 Tim. 1.12.
                  Thirdly, from this doctrine ariseth a comfort to Gods  children against the temptation of being vtterly forsaken, because being so surely built vpon the rocke,
                        Mat. 16. the gates of hell, euen the strongest assaults of Sathan, cannot preuaile against them; heaven and earth shall sooner be remoued then any of Gods seruants. For if Gods election be vnchangable, if his couenant be euerlasting and vnuiolable, if his truth cannot alter, nor his mercy faile, nor his power be weakned, if the prayers of Iesus Christ cannot be refused and cast out, if his Scriptures cannot lye and deceiue, if his sanctifying grace cannot dye and perish, then beleeue it though sinfull lusts rebell, the vaine world entise, the Diuell tempt and rage, raysing vp troubles without and terrours within, yea though our selues in our feares and faintings sinck & be ready to giue ouer, yet being once his we are euer his, and though we be down, we shal be raised vp, thogh we be shaken, we shall neuer be remoued: as Dauid said out of his owne experience touching temporall prouision for this life, I have ben young and now am old, yet I neuer knew the righteous forsaken, nor their seede begging their bread: so I may appeale to the experience of all that euer haue beene young and are become old concerning eternall preseruation, if euer they knew a man truely fearing and trusting in God (how weakely so euer it were) to be confounded.
                  The fourth and last profit to be made of this doctrine, is to stirre vp euery one of vs to a meruailous great care to  looke to our selues, and to watch ouer our soules,This also is another marke that a man is in this vnmoueable condition. considering that God who made vs without our selues, yet doth not preserue vs without our selues, but vseth our owne warinesse and endeauour therevnto. This is that which one of

the Fathers hath wel and truely said, tutus si attonitus, securus si cantus, that is to say, thou art safe so thou beest wary, thou art sure so thou beest astonished and tremblest: agreeable to that in the second Psalme, serue the Lord in feare; and to that in the second of the Philippians, worke out your saluation with feare and trembling. It is a rule of pollicie by Philip de Commines in his French historie, namely, that mistrust is safe: and surely it is a good rule in diuinitie, a Christian is most safe that is most mistrustfull. First, the Diuell is much to be mustrusted, considering his deepe subtilitie and long experience, and so much the more to be mistrusted because hee is an inuisible enimie, and therefore the harder to espye his assaults, or to auoide them: and blessed is the soule that is alwayes iealous & mistrustfull ouer that cursed fiend, which casteth his baytes and his snares to catch vs in euery thing, in our apparell, meat, and company, &c. in hearing, reading and prayer, in speaking and doing. Secondly, it is good to be mistrustfull of men, both friends and enimies, both ignorant and prophane, that we be not corrupted by their euill example, wicked company, indiscreet or euill counsell and perswasion:
                        
                           〈1 paragraph〉
                        
                      euen Peter will giue ill aduise, and Nathan may giue counsell which God will checke. Lastly, and aboue all, it behoues vs to be mistrustfull ouer our selues, and ouer our owne corrupt reason and affections, as wrath, pride, couetousnes, & such like, which are euer ready to betray vs into the hands of our enimie Sathan: and they are so much the more to be mistrusted, by how much they are nearer vnto vs, being in the middest of vs (as it were) within our bowels, and bearing a great shew of being our friends, fawning vpon vs whiles secretly they giue vs the stab at the hart. In which respect they are of the Apostle worthely termed deceitfull lusts. Ephe. 4.
                  Thus far of the first doctrine, concerning the vnmoueable steadfastnesse of Gods true worshippers. Now a few words of the second doctrine, which is this: The markes whereby the true worshippers of God may be knowne who they be, to themselues and to others. He that doth these

things, he is the true worshipper, and shall neuer be remoued.
                  
                  The markes then whereby they are knowne, are the things set downe in this Psalme: He that doth these things, what things? not superstitious workes deuised by men, not ceremonious workes, though commanded by God, for these things may be done of hipocrits: but the workes and fruits of true sanctification they are the markes by which Gods true worshippers and children are knowne. In the eight to the Romane's, the Apostle teacheth that Gods children may be knowne by the witnesse of Gods spirit: the spirit it selfe (saith he) beareth witnesse to our spirits that we are the sonnes of God. This certainely is most true because it is written in the Scriptures, the word of truth: howbeit it is no easie thing euen for the very sonnes of God to finde out this testimony in themselues, & many haue ben deceiued by taking a carnall presumption instead of the testimonie of the spirit: Therefore if there be any to whom it is certified by an euident & liuely witnesse of the spirit, that they are the sonnes of God, they haue much to prayse God for it: but if there be any in whom this witnesse is feeble and darke, let them not be discouraged:Simile. for as true fire is well discerned from painted fire by the heat it giues, though ther be neither light nor flame; so it may be as well knowne who be the children of God by the workes and fruits of the spirit, as by the witnesse of the spirit: they which want this latter may haue cause to be glad if they haue the former. For the Apostle Peter in the first chapter of his second Epistle, hauing exhorted the Christians to ioyne to their faith knowledge, to knowledge vertue, to vertue temperance, to temperance patience, to patience brotherly kindnesse, to brotherly kindnesse loue, he assureth them that if these things be in them and abound they should neuer fall, but haue their election sure, and haue an entrance made into the blessed kingdome of God. And to conclude, our Prophet in this Psalme, vnto that question (who shall dwell in thy Tabernacle?) makes this answere, euen hee that deales vprightly toward God and man, hee that liueth a iust life, hee that thinketh the truth, and speaketh as

hee thinketh, hee that hurteth not his neighbour in name, bodie, goods or soule, he that neither spreadeth nor receiueth false report against his brother, he that loueth godly men though they be hated in the world, and flattereth not wicked men though they be honoured in the world, hee that faithfully keepeth his promises, euen to his owne damage and losse, especially such promises as are confirmed with an oath, hee that auoydeth vsurie and briberie, and whether he lend of curtesie, or iudge of dutie, as led by loue and not by lucre, hee, hee, whosoeuer he is, rich or poore, learned or simple, high or low, euen he that doth these things, and all these things, and not onely knoweth them and liketh them, but doth them and performes them, and doth them constantly and sincerely, out of loue to God and men, though weakely and vnperfectly, and desireth in the doing of these things to aduance Gods glory, being hartely sorry that he doth these things so faintly and feebly, this is hee that may assure himselfe to be the person that now truely serueth God, and hereafter shall remaine in heauen with him for euer.
