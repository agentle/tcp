God is the insercher and inseer euen of the very secrete affectis of the harte / and aftir that faith

                  . to put him in mynde of this certayn gospel & of thassuerance of whom he was lerned ye scripture / how effectuouse myghty & perfit it is vnto saluacion / a none se wt how meruelouse erneste obtestacion he adiured Timothe before god & ye lorde Iesu cryste yt he shulde preche it: byddinge him to be feruēt be it in ceason or out of ceason: Improue rebuke exhorte wt al pacience &c. Now crystē reder / I obteste & adiure ye wt Paule / before God & ye lorde Iesu cryste yt shall Iuge the quyk & deed at his aperinge in his kyngdome / yt yu cleue vnto ye ancor of his wryten ād adsuered worde / not to leue it for Moris vnwryten rytes & ceremones / forsake not Goddis certayn wrytinge for Mores vncertayne vanytes. Beleue Goddis vndouted scriptures: & aborte Moris execrable & dampnable doctrine if yu wylt saue thy soule. What Crysten man dothe not doute of Moris vnwryten wordis or rather knowe them for vndouted blasphemyes & starke

heresyes? but of the trouth of goddis wryten testament / no crysten man beynge one of crystes floche heringe and knowing his herde mannis voyce neuer douted / nor neuer shal. but is assuered that it is his euerlasting trouth sufficient for our saluacion. Which god geue vs grace only to rede / to vnderstande / to beleue / to cleue to / and tops. cxix holde it vp before vs the very lighte vnto our fete / that we stomble not at Moris vn wryten lyes and fall into his dampnable doctryne.
               Amen.
