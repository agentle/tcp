to the opē vse ofliuing. In folowing of which intent, what by incre ase of iudgement for yeres, what by trauatlīg abrode in y• world, I foūde euer more and more so new profits, & commodities: y• wheras, methought, I had seene but y• shadow of thinges, now I begin more to see (as it wer) the holle bodie therof. And moste of all, this proofe I haue, in y• greatest and moste profitable parte of philosophie, which is cōcerning maners: and namely in the bokes, that of duties be written, by Marcus Tullius Cicero: a mater conteining the holle trade, how to liue among men discreetly, and honestly: and so rightly pointing oute the pathwaye to all vertue: as none can be righter, onely Scripture excepted. Insomuch, that when I had well considerd alltogither: I saide with miself, concerning this, as did a certein lerned mā, not long ago, by Homer: This is the fift time, I haue redde ouer this author: and as oft as I reade him, so oft somwhat I finde, that I marked not before: and that hath neede to be deeply pondered: so yt I fansied, at the first,

he was easie: but now, methinks, he requires a verie heedfull, & a musing reader. Wherfore, not without maruailous greate pleasure, espyeng: y• either in priuate life, to attein quietnesse, and contentation: or in officebearing, to winne fame, & honour: or in euerie estate, bothe to auoyde disorder, and enormitie, and also to keepe a right rule, & commēdable behauiour: this boke playnly is y• myrrour of wisdom, y• fortres of iustice, the master of manlinesse, the schoole of temperance, the iewell of cōmelinesse: I wisshed, many mo to be parteners of such sweetnesse, as I had partly felt myself: & to declare, that I mēt nolesse, thā I wisshed: I laied to, my helping hand: endeuouring, by translation, to do likewise for my contriemēne: as Italiās, Frēchmē, Spaniardes, Dutchmē, & other foreins haue liberally done for theyrs. So, chiefly for our vnlatined people I haue made this latine writer, english: & haue now brought into light, y• from them so longe was hidden: & haue caused an aunciēt wryting to beecōme, in a maner, newe agayne:

and a boke, vsed but of fewe, to war cōmon to a great meany: so that our mē, vnderstāding, what atreasure is amonge them, for the fashioning of their life: and beeing by nature most of all other nations giuē to ciuilitie, & humanitie: whē thei shall be aided, & directed by these perfite precepts: may, in all pointes of good demeanour, becōme people perelesse.
            Yet iudge I all this labour litleworthe, & smally, or nothing able to preuaile: withoute your honorable lordship were patrone herof: to whō I do dedicate bothe my good hert, & my worke also: (I call it mine, as Plautus, and Terence called the comedies theyrs, which they made oute of Greeke) not as to teache your lordshipp ought, that you haue not allredy: but by your authoritie, to gett it the more estimacion wt other. For as Tullies treatise, beeing so full of lerning, asketh alerned mans iudgement: which whoso refuse, thei showe themselues to be vnwise: euē so such a noble Coūseler of Englād seemeth most meete to receiue so noble a Senatour of Rome into a

straunge region. Doutlesse among so many honorable deedes of your lordships, it shall not be the leste honorable: if ye do Marcus Tullius this honour, to welcōme him hither: and to be the verie cause, that so famous a Romane may becomme familiar with our English men.
            So shall a worthy pere be worthylie entreated: as very curtesie requireth: so your lordshipps iudgement must needes be well lyked: which is wōte to alow louely knowledge, & goodnesse: so wyll the cōmon people more hyely esteeme the thing: as it is expedient for them to do: and the soner also will they folow these hollsome lessons: which is full necessarie, in a well ordered state: to be short, your lordship, for a chosen patrone: my translation, for a welcome worke: & Tullie shall be takē for such a Tullie, as he is. And like as Marcꝰ Cicero, wt the authoritie of a father, commended these bokes to his yonge Cicero: so whē our English youth shall beholde them once authorised by so reuerend a father in god: nodoute, they will be the rather in loue with

them: and will counte it pleasaunt paines taking, here to enriche themselues with enformations of vertue, ensaumples oute of stories, morall doctrine, politike prudēce, antiquitie, varietie of maruailous maters: so conningly, & oratorially treated, and endited: as hee was able to declare, & expresse: who was the first, and the chief, that euer cladde ladie Philosophie in Romane attire. Thus, verie lothe to let your lordship from your weighty affaires, I make an end: & praye god, longe to preserue your honorable lordship in helth, with increase of honour.
            
               Your humble oratour, Nicolas Grimalde.
            
         
         
            
            N. G. to the reader.
            
               ALl thinges in the world (good reader) be made for sōme vse, & end: which end is more worthe, than all, that dothe seruice therunto: and where bothe the end is good, & whatso serues therto: there y• holle doing is likewise good. In vs the best ende is, to vse ourselues well, and worthyly: who in the order of naturall thinges ar of the best, and worthyest kinde. For what is ther, that can vse itself: onlesse it bee enfourmed with reason, and vnderstanding? Dūme creatures, and liuelesse of other bee vsed: but themselues can they neuer vse. Beastes endewed with life, and sense, maye seeme to haue sōme sēblaūt herof: in yt, they vse theyr feedīg, lodging, & other necessaries: yet therbi they obtein neither praise, nor dispraise: seeing they do it not of any free choyse: but onely by the motion of kinde, & as theyr appetite draweth

them. But we, who haue the greate gift of witt, & reason, must not most of all sticke still in y• appetite: to gett nothing els, but pleasure, & profit: but ensewing the heuenly guyde of our nature, must be ledde to the desire of trouth, honour, & seemlinesse: wherwt the more that we bee decked, adourned, & beautified: yt 
               
                  •…
               rder we bee from the brutishnesse of beastes, and the nerer approche we to the nature diuine.
            In as much then as euery thing is borne to do that, which to his kinde is moste agreable: & vs it beseemeth moste to vse ourselues: our parte wt
               oute doute, & our dutie shall wee do best: if we employe the vsing of ourselues to deedes, that be honest, & cō
               mēdable. Other things whē we vse: as lande, howses, armour, horses, howndes, money, clothes, or stuff: we can not yet vse them at all times: and with them we must enforce, and bysie ourselues also: whereas the vsing of ourselues is in euery place at hand, and at no season to seeke.
            For whether we be doing somwhat, or at rest: whether wee abide in the

countrey, or in the citie: whether we be occupied in ernest, or in game: no pawse ther is at all, but night & day
                  •…
                we vse ourselues continually.
            Which thing sithe in euery portion of a mans life it hathe place: if it bee well, and wisely, and conueniently done: we shall be wealfull, and in a blessed case: if vngraciously, & fōdly, and wickedly: wretched shall we be, and in a wofull plight. This ar we taught tomuch, by the cōmon life of men: who for defaulte of skyll, how to behaue themselues, be cōfounded in deepe derknesse of errour, and ignorāce: and wanting the right rule, they take chalk for cheese, as the sayeng is: they can not frame theyr affections, nor keepe them in temper. But such maner clowdes be clerely dissolued, by the beames of Philosophie: which setts before our yiesight the verie endes, and markes, that self nature hath appointed vs.
            For in this worlde here beneath, ar thre kindes of liuing wightes: wherof somme haue nomore, but life: as plants, herbes, and trees, growing oute of the grounde: sōme haue not

onely life, but senses also: as sheepe, oxen, & other beastes: ye third comprehendeth bothe these: and ouer life, & senses, hath the souerain ruler, Reason: as in the nature of man we see thē all conioyned. It remains therfore, and meete it is for him, such doings to practise: as may bothe seuerallie agree with eche of these parts, and generallie with thē alltogither. To the parcell inferiour (by which we receiue our norishment, our growing, & the state of our bodie) wellfare is appointed the vttmost ende: wherin the thing cōsisteth, y• we call profitable: which concernes the getting, maintayning, or recouering of helth. Of the soule, or life endewed with senses, pleasure is the end, that it would enioye. The third nature, which is partener of reason, hathe this pricke to shoote at (if you consider it by itself alone) science, and knowledge of trouth: if you beholde it with the other two accōmepanied: it hathe honestie, worshipp, and honour.
            These bee the verie endes, wherto mannes life, and nature must endeuour

to attein: hither dothe Philosophie promise to bring a mā, by her information. For when she hathe tolde in a generaltie, what is honest, cōmely, vaylable, praiseworthy, and in euerie pointe conuenient: then may mē, by intelligence perceiuing the trouth, truly expresse the same in euerie particular deede.
            Wherfore seing reason conteins the holle life of mā: and to it, as to theyr captein, the other parts bee obediēt, or at leste wise ought to bee

            Mannes minde is contented, and satisfied with nothing somuch, as the clere vnderstanding, and the vndeceauable science of soothe. Chiefly standeth his minde in contemplatiō of immortall, & perdurable thinges: therto, in suche as fade, and fall, it teacheth, ordeineth, appointeth, cō
               maūdeth. Wherupō y• order, course, figure, light, influēce of sōne, moone,

                  •…
               , the moste righteous, and euerlasting. Yet is the selfsame minde by the felouship, and companie of the senses, and desires, many a time called awaie from that principall office, to consider these vnstable, and mutable thinges: and sōmtime to cast in conceite fourmes disseuered from the mater, mathematically: & sōmetime to view thīgs sensible, that can in no wise bee sondered from the materiall substance: as eleme
                  •…
               es, beastes, herbes, trees, metalls, stones, and such like: all the which must needes be fensed, & fortified wt the trade of debating doutes, and discerning of trouth from vntrouthe: which is the art of Logik, the verie rule of reason, and instrument of all discourse.
            Now, to speake of the vsing of the holleman: by the continuall tenour,

and stedfast rate of bodies celestiall, and naturall, the minde of man lerneth order, obedience, and concorde. For like as god gouerneth thinges manyfolde, moueable, and falling awaye, beyng himself but one, vnremoouable, and euerduring: so reasō within vs ought to rule raunging lusts, & rash motions of the minde, and the other vnworthyer, and weaker parts: beeing itself stedfast, sage, principall, and strongly established.
            In case a man loue any one parte of himself tomuch: or sewe after y• end therof by a wronge waye, and clene oute of fashion: he shall not leade a life all euē, and streyght, but hoked, and croked: nor easie, and quiet, but miserablie distempered. For whoso bee ouermuch enclined to paumpering, and pleasing of the vitall portion: thei be all bent to gather good, and holly giuen to gaine. They, that alonely serue theyr senses, and sett theyr delite to feele the pleasures of the same: be excessiue eyther in ryotting, & banketing, or in outragious 
                  〈◊〉
                or in other such

               aunces, as bee sensuall. They, which holde them content to leade a life cōtēplatiue, hauing no regarde, ne respect to y• forenamed ꝑcels: do proue sowre, sowring, blockish, rusticall, & farre from all ciuilnesse of life. He, in whome reason 
                  •…
               oynes with the senses, for to do thē seruice: will enforce himself to win worldly glorie, and soueraintie. He, that can comprise in his thought no large cōmepasse, nor deepe consideration: but is faynt, feeble, wauering, and full of infirmitie: will showe forthe himself chieflie with appareling, or wt sōme outward bragge, to supplie his want within.
            To such sortes of annoyaunce, and disconuenience, light, and moderation is brought by morall doctrine: the which, Marcus Lullius Cicero, in these bookes of duties, professeth. This lerning teacheth, somuch to graunt the vitall parte, and the netherest: as will be suffisant to preserue the life in helth, and wellfare. It willeth also the feeling portion so to take fruitiō of pleasures: that neither it defraude the lower parte of

the ꝓfits therto appropriate: nor wt importune egging annoye y• minde, which aspireth vnto veritie of opinions, and vprightnesse of maners.
            Withoute mo wordes, it assigneth that for to reigne, which is borne to reigne: & that to be obeysaunt, which is franied for obeysaunce.
            Now, when a man is so enstructed with philosophie: that he can full cō
               ueniētly liue sole, & at pointe deuice by himself: he must be brought forth abrode into the face of the worlde: to the intent he may procure, not onely that becōmes himself to do, but also the welth of other folke. He must remember the three folde state, & diuersitie, that he hathe espyed, & practised in himself: and must trans
                  •…
               erre thesame to the gouernaūce bothe of his housholde priuatlie, and of the holle commons openly. So shall the meanest sorte, like the vitall parcell in man, bee occupied aboute the moste seruile, and needfull workes: men of middle degree, like y• sensiue soule, shall attend to affaires, and sciences more liberall: the nobilitie in the cō
               mon gouernment, like reason in the

nature of mā, shall rule all the multitude. That thing also dothe Lullie touche in this treatise: and showeth mē in authoritie theyr duties, bothe iu warr, and peas: wherby thei may make themselues, and theyr subiects happy, and fortunate.
            And not onely them, but all sortes of men he admonisheth: what thei haue to do, thorough out their life: according to theyr age, trade, and estate: with respect to the circumstaūces of times, places, and persones.
            In the first boke, he first diuideth dutie into the perfit, and the meane: leauing the one (which belongeth to the end of good, & is in it self right) to men of perfectiō: and prosecuting y• other, in certein rules, & preceptes: so that therby euery mā may frame, and order his life. Then he leades vs to the fynding oute of duties, by taking aduisement aboute the choise of honest thinges, and refusall of the vnhonest. Afterward he setts for the the originall causes, and the chiefe parts of honestie, with theyr duties, & properties. At the last, he warneth vs to discerne y• more, or most honest

thing frō the lesse, or le
                  •…
               : & allwaies, in the vse therof, to preferr y• greater. In the second, rehersing profitable, & vnprofitable thinges: he showeth, how to attein, and to vse the profitable, & how to eschewe the contrarie: and in the end, makes a comparison of profits: teaching to preferre the greater before the smaller, or the mo before the fewer.
            In the third, he cōpareth profit with honestie, & with euerie parte therof: not as if ther could indeede bee contrarietie bitweene them: but hee means the profit, which semeth not honest, & the honestie, which seemeth not profitable: or of eyther of thē the apparaunt showe: and hee tells vs, what is to be done, when these seeme so to striue, one with an other: that honestie allureth vs one waye, and profit calleth vs an other waye.
            Thus the holle mater is referred, and applied to honestie, and profit, two principall pointes of good: the third (which wee call pleasure, and is placed by the Peripatetiks in the noumber of good thinges) Tullie, like a Stoik, dothe but briefly

            For who euer sawe in so few leaues so much morall doctrine, and politicall, set out with so many conning castes, and feates oratoriall? What a sort of stories be there so notable of themselues, so handsomly applied, so elegantly tolde? You shall not lightly reade the like, within so litle commepasse, in any historian, that of purpose dothe nothing els.
            How finely, & featly be y• poets verses alledged? With what a discretiō ar sōme auncient writers reproued? With what subtilitie, & fynesse of wit be certein cōtrouersies debated?

Posidonius, a Khodiane, meddled with the same mater: but nothing to Tullius. So did Hecato: but nothing to Tullius. And many other mo of later time: but, lorde, how farr be thei from Tulliꝰ? Tullius, in his graue yeres, after he hadd herde a noumber of lerned men: after he had redde the moste approued authors: after he had endyted so many volumes: and his style was woxen ripe, his witt sage, his

               der at in viewing, & yet not attein in folowing. Tullius, hauing done many glorious acts, in a state of gouernment most triumphāte, lerned the most part of these lessons by experience. Tullius out of the Greeke

authors, of whome also sōme had been gouer

               ours in florishing empires: trāslated a greate deale. Tullius to Marcus, his wellbeloued sonne, abyding euen at Athenes, among the best philosophers, was not afraid to send this parcell of philosophie. Nodoute, as welcō it was to y• lerned Athenians: as y• Greeks doings were to the Romanes: or as now adayes, the French, & Italians welframed writings be to those English men, that vnderstand thē: yea and somuch the more wellcōme: as it was a rare thing then, to see that kinde of knowledge expressed in pure latine. But in Rome, in Italie, in Europa, in all quarters, where latine speche had place: O, so it was embraced at all times, of all men, in euery degree, order, & estate. Rulers haue here foūde much witty policie, apperteining to the gouernaunce of realmes. Householders, & parents haue pyked oute of these bokes vertuous instructions for theyr children, & theyr seruauntes. Doctors, & diuines haue here mett with morall

sentence, and ensaumples verie excellent. Ciuil lawyers haue espied, touching iustice, and equitie, bothe rules appointed, and cases discussed. Schoolemen haue taken herehence problemes, and questions, to debate at large: and haue fetched from hence philosophicall conclusions, with reasons, and argumentes to proue, and to disproue. Oratours haue been well furnished hereby, with sondry graces, and ornaments of speeche: and in the like maner of mater, haue marked, how to bestowe their style. Rhetoriciās, who for their exercise, do vse declamatiōs: haue taken oute of this, cōmon places, like large feldes, where mē may walk at libertie. Schoolemasters neuer wist of fyner phrases, for to make theyr scholars acquainted with the verie veine of the latine language. At few wordes, all men, that of wisdome be studious, may gett sommewhat herein to sharpe the witt, to store the intelligence, to feede the minde, to quicken the sprite, to augment the reason, to direct y• appetite, to frame the tounge, to fashion the maners:

moreouer to rule, to obei, to dispute, to determine, to teache, to persuade, & to euery needfull purpose in a mās life. Onlesse theself thing witnesse as much, as I saie, let me not be credited: but incase bothe y• boke speake for it self: & to my testimoniall I am able to adioyne princely peres, wellbeknowne, and well approued: then shall bothe the worthynesse of the worke, & also the weyght of the authoritie winne credit, & assente. Tullies duties when Cesar August us had redde ouer, still standing on his feete: as he againe deliuered them to his neuiew, of whō he had thē: Eloquent (quoth he) was this man, eloquent he was indeede: & one, yt loued well his coūtrie. Tullies duties had Seuerus, the noble emperour, in so greate price, and reputation: that of all the Romanes bokes, to reade thē, he thought him best apaide. Tullies duties haue I knowne good clerks, and well lerned mē beare aboute in theyr bosōmes: layeng it full neare theyr herts, y• they woulde haue lodged in theyr heades: and entirely louing Tullies heuenly cōmepanie,

            These richesse, & treasures of witt, and wisdome, as Cicero trāsported oute of Greece into Italie: so haue I fetched from thence, & conueied thē into England: and haue caused also Marcus Tullius (more, thā he could do, whē he was aliue) to speake English. Maruailous is the mater, flowing the eloquēce, ryche the store of stuff, & full artificiall the enditing: but how I, in our maner of speche, haue expressed the same: the more the booke bee perused, the better it may chaūce to appere. None other trāslatiō in our toug haue I seen, but one: which is of all men of any lerning so well liked: yt thei repute it, & count it as none: yet if ye list to cōpare this sōmwhat wt y• nothing: perauēture this somwhat will seeme somwhat y• more. How be it looke, what rule the Rhetorician giues in precept, to bee obserued of an Oratour, in telling of his tale: that it bee short, & withoute ydle wordes: that it be playn, and wt

For if it be not as brief, as the verie authors text requireth: whatso is added to his perfite style, shall appeare superfluous, & to serue rather to the making of sōme paraphrase, or commentarie. Therto, if it bee vttered wt ynkhorne termes, & not with vsuall words: or if it be phrased wt wrasted, or farrefetched fourmes of speche: not fine, but harsh, not easye, but harde, nor naturall, but violent it shall seeme to bee. Then also, in case it yeeld not the meaning of the author: but eyther folowing fansie, or misledde by errour, forsakes the true pattern: it can not bee approued for a faithfull, & sure interpretation: which ought to be takē for y• greatest praise of all. These points as I haue studied to ꝑfourme: so where I haue not allwaies atteined vnto them: I shall desire you, gētle reader, gētely to cōsider bothe the excelence of the author, who is a perfit oratour: and also the greatnesse of y• mater, which is profounde philosophie.

(and that wt sōme profit, & pleasure) trye, what I haue done, & what they can do, all vnder one: if, layeng my trāslatiō aparte, they will set the latine before thē, & so assay theyr owne veine. Eyther they shall like themselues the better: when they conferre it with my poore workmāship: orels perchaūce conne me the more thank, for attempting, folowing, & accōplishing of this enterprise. Be it so, one hathe neyther the latine, nor the english eloquēce: yet, by the benefite of nature, sythe a mā may do much: namely if he therto adioyne vse, & exercise: here is for him occasiō bothe to whet his wit, & also to fyle his toūg. For allthough an English mā hath his mother toung: & can talk apace, as he lerned of his dame: yet is it one thing to title tattle, I wott not how, or to chatter like a iaye: & an other, to bestowe his wordes wiselye, orderly, pleasauntly, & pythiely. Such as haue english meatly well, & but a smatterīg, or small taste in y• latine: which noumber is great, among the scholars of this realme: may hereby fail into such acquayntaunce, and

familiaritie with this most excellent latine man: that neither shall his deuise seme hard, nor his art obscure, nor his style straunge. I dare well saye, if this worke happe into a good students hand: hee will not think it ynough to runne ouer it once: as we fare with trifles, and toyes: but aduisediy, and with good leasure, thre, or foure, or fiue times, he will reade it, and reade it, and reade it againe: first, by the principall points, by the definitiōs, and the diuisions: to see, what is treated, how farreforthe, in what order, and with what varietie: then, to mark the precepts, reasons, conclusions, & commō places: after, vnto the sayd places to referre all the stories, with the verses poeticall: finally, as well in the english, as the latine, to weygh well properties of wordes, fashions of phrases, and the ornaments of bothe. Moreouer, many clerks haue I knowne, eare this: which could conceiue, & vnderstand full well: whose toung neuerthelesse in vtteraūce, and vse of speche, was in a maner maymed: yea and sōme, that could also speake latine redyly,

            Now therfore, good reader, fare you well: and remember, how vnfyt (as Aristotle sayeth) and vnprofitable hearers of morall science yongmen be: as long as eyther they folow their youthly affections: or do continue vnskylfull, and rude in y• deeds, that of dutie belonge to mannes life. For, all the whyle, they yeelde themselues to be ledde awaie of their mad moodes: if you talke to them of vertues, and of maners, ye do but sing the deaffe a song. And how shall they be able to iudge, what is discreetly, rightfully, valiauntly, moderately, & worthylie done: who neyther haue any such qualitie, nor vnderstand by experiēce any pointe of the same?

And thus haue we spoken of the first fountaine of dutie.
            
            But of the other three vertuesOf iustice, as it is generall. remaining, that kinde extendeth fardest: wherin is conteined the felowshippe of men amonge them selues, and (as it wer) the enterpartening of mannes life.
            
            Whereof there bee twoo partes:Particular iustice.
               
iustice is one, in the which is the greatest brightnes of vertue, wherof good men beare their name: and to this is ioyned bountiefulnesse, which same we may terme eitherLiberalitie. gentlenesse, or liberalitie.
            But the principall dutie of iustice  is, that no man hurt an other,Duties of iustice. onlesse he be prouoked by wronge: the next, that he vse thinges cōmon, as cōmon, and thinges priuate, as his owne. How beit by nature thingesPriuate thinges. priuate be none: but either by aūcient possessiō, as of theirs, who in old time cam into waste groūds: or by victorie, as of theirs, who got thinges in warre: or by lawe, couenant, condition, or lotte. Whereof it cōmes to passe, that the grounde Arpinas is coūted the Arpinatiās: the ground Tusculane, the Tusculanians. And after thys sorte is the pointing out of priuate possessiōs. Wherupon seeing there is made a mans owne of euerie one of those thinges, which by nature wer cō
               mon: let euery one enioy, that to euery one is befallen. More thā that, if any man wyl couet to himselfe,

he shall breake the lawe of mannes felowship. But bicause (as it is notablie writtē of Plato) we be borne

            But faithfulnesse is the foundationFaithfulnesse of iustice: which is in worde, and couenaunt, a trouth, and stedfastnesse. Wherupon though this shall seeme to some perchaūce ouerhard: yet let vs be bolde to folowe the Stoiks: which heedfullie serche oute, frō whēce wordes be fetched: & let vs think, that it is called faithfulnesse, because it is fullfilled,

which was faithed.
            Cōtrariwise, ther be two kindesIniustice. of iniustice. One of such, as offer it: an other, of those, who, though they be able, do not defend wronge from thē, to whō it is offered. For whoso vniust

               , if he be able, is as farre in fault: as if he should forsake his parents, his frendes, or his countrey.
            And in deede those iniuries, thatOccasions of wrōg doing. 
               
                  〈◊〉

            And for the moste parte manie men  take occasion to do wronge, of intētConetousnes to comepasse those thīges, that they haue coueted: in which kīde of vice, couetousnes most largelie shewethThe vse of riches. herself. Notwithstanding riches be coueted, bothe for necessarie vses of the life, & also to enioye pleasures.

But in those, in whome there is a greater corage, coueting of money hath an yie to power, and ablenesse of pleasuring: as of late MarcusCrassus the riche. Crassus denied any substaunce to be greate inough for him, that in a common weale wolde be a prince: while he were not able with his reuenue to maintein an armie. Sūptuous furnitures doo also delite, & countenaūce of life, with fijnnesse, and plentie. By which meanes it is come to passe, that endlesse is the desire of riches.
            And trulie the enlargement of a mannes priuate goodes, hurtful to nobodie, is not to be dispraised: but euermore iniurie is to be shonned. But the moste parte of men chieflieAmbition. be brought to forgette iustice: whē they fall into y• desyre of rule, honour, or glorie. For that, which is in Ennius,
            
               In empire is no godlie felowship, nor no fayth,
               Ennius. reacheth furder. For whatsoeuer is of such sorte, wherin manie cā not be chief: therin commonlie happeneth so great contention, that verie hard it is to keepe a godlie societie.

The storme of Caius CesarCaius Iulius Caesar. declared that of late: who turned topset toruie all the lawes of God, and man, for that souerainties sake, which he to himself, by the errour of his own conceite, had imagined. And in this kinde, it is a greefful case: that desires of honor, rule, power, and glorie be cōmonly in the greatest corages, and goodliest wittes. Wherfore the more hede must be taken, that we offende nothing in that behalfe.
            But ther is a greate diuersitie inOf twoo sortes in wrong doing, whether is the woorsse. all iniustice, whether the wrong be done of anie sturre of the minde, which cōmonlie is but shorte, and for a seasō: orels of purpose, and aduisedlie. For the harmes be easier, that befall of some sodē moode, thā such, as be done being deuised, and prepared for. And thus we haue said inough of doing iniurie.
            But ther are wonte to be manie causes, why we refuse to defend an other, and doo leaue our dutie. For

necligence, slouthfulnesse, idlenes, priuate studies, or certein bisinesse: that they suffer thē to be helplesse, whō they ought to saue harmlesse. Wherfore we must looke, leste itIdle Philosophers disalowed. be not sufficient, that is spoken of Plato, touching the Philosophers: y• therfore they be iust, bicause they be occupied in tracig out trouth: & bicause they despise, & set at nought such thinges, as the moste parte of men greedilie desire, and amonge themselues ar wonte to be at daggers drawing for the same. For while they attein one kinde of iustice, that they hurt nomā with doing of iniurie, they fall into the other. For beeing letted with the studie of lerning, they forsake thē, whō they ought to defend. And therfore he thinks, they wolde not enter into the cōmonweale, wer they not cō
               pelied. But it wer more reasō, that voluntarilie it should be doon. For whatso is rightlie doon, thesame therbie is iust, if it be voluntarie. Ther be also, who either for loue of sauing their substaunce, or a certein hatred to mē, do saie, that they

meddle onelie with their owne maters: leste they maye seeme to doo anie bodie wronge: who, whyle they bee voide of one kinde of iniustice, doo runne into the other. For they forsake the felowshippe of life: bicause they bestowe no studie, no labour, nor substaunce vpon it.
            Seeing then after the declaringBriefe rehersall of things afore. of the twoo kindes of iniustice, we haue therto ioyned the causes of either kinde: and haue sette oute those thinges afore, wherin iustice is cō
               teined: we may easilie iudge, what is the dutie of euerie season, except we fauour ourselues to farre. ForCare of other mens mater

            But often ther befall seasons, that those duties, which seeme to be moste meete for a iust man, & him, whome we call a good mā, be chaū
               ged, and becomme contrarious: so that sometime it is iust not to restore, that is laied to keepe: also, not to perfourme promes with a mad man: and to denie those thinges, which concerne ones trouth, and honestie. For it is meete, they be referred to those foundations of iustice: which I layde in the beginning: first, that no mā be hurt: next, that cōmon profit be serued. When these be chaunged by time: chaunged is dutie, that it remaines not alwaies alike. For ther mai chaūce some promes, and couenaunt: that may be vnprofitable to be perfourmed, either to him, to whō it is promised: orels to him, that ꝓmised it.

For (as it is in the fables) if NeptunusOf These

For of the thre boones (as is writtē) that was the third, which in his furie he asked, for the death of Hippolytus: and when he had obteined it, he fell into heauie wailinges. Therfore neither those promises ar to be fulfilled, which ar vnprofitable to thē, to whome you made them: nor if they hurt you more, thē they profit him, whome you promised.
            It is against dutie, the greater  harme to be rather admitted, than the lesse: as if you haue appointed yourselfe wyth anie man, tocome, as his counseler in his ma-ter, that is in hand: and in the meane season, your sonne beginnes to fall sore sicke: let it not be reckened against dutie, not to perfourme, that ye promised: yea and he more shuld swarue from dutie, to whome the promis was made, if he wolde complaine himself to be disapointed.
            Now who seeith not? that it is not meete to stād to those promises.

So passīg great

regarde they had in making their warres. Ther is a letter abrode, of Marcus Cato, the olde mā, to Marcus his sōne: wherin he wrote, that he herd, he was discharged by the Consul, beeing a souldiour in Macedonie, at the Persian warres. He warnes him therfore to beware, that he enter not the battle: for he denieth, that it is lawfull for him, that is no souldiour, to fight with the enemie.

For he was called Hostis, with our aunceters, whō now we name Peregrinum, a straūger. That the twelue tables declare, Aut status dies cum hoste: and again, Aduersus bostem eterna auctoritas. What may there be added to this kinde of gentlenes? to call him by so faire a name, with whom you make warre.

                  Hostis is now taken for an enemie. maketh that name now more odious: for it is gone from the signification

As to go a theeuing, to begyle one, to commit aduouterie, is a thing indeede dishonest: but it is tolde, withoute dishonestie: likewise to gette childern indeede is honest, but to be vttered in talke it wer vnclenly.

Neither must we agree, that these thinges should be seemly in players, and oratours,Players. and left loosely in our selues. The custome of the stageplayers, euen of an olde order, hathe so greate regarde to shamefastnesse:

that noman commeth on the stage, withoute britches. For they ar aferd: leste, if it chaunce by anie mishappe, that sōme partes of the body be discouered, they should be seene vncomlye. And, as the fashion is wt vs: childern growing to mannesBaines. state be not bathed with their parēts: nor sōnes in lawe, with their fathers in lawe.

            So greate a force ther is bothe of place, and time. As for example, if a man, that shall pleade a cause, bee musing to himself in his iourney,

Now in thosesame thīgesComparison of honest thinges. which bee honest, ther may befall oftentimes a question, and comparison, of twoo honest thinges whether is y• honester: which pointe is passed ouer of Panetius.
            For whereas all honestie springeth oute of four braunches: wherof one is of knowledge, an other of common feloushippe, the third of great corage, the fourt of measurekeeping: it must needes bee, that in choosing of dutie these bee often compared togither. We think therfore, those duties be more agreeable with nature, which beeCommon felouship

to bee preferred before meane, and measure keping. I think not so.
            For ther bee sōme thinges partlie so filthy, partly so haynous: that a wise man woulde not do them, no not to saue his coūtrie. Uerie many such, Possidonius hath gathered togither: but somme of thē so fowle, and so filthie: that euen to be spoken they seeme shamefull.
            Those therfore ought noman to take in hād, for the commonweales cause: nother woulde the commonweale for her sake haue them enterprised. But this mater standes in better case: for that ther cā befall no time: y• the commonweale shoulde neede to haue a wiseman doo any of them.

not hard, in serching oute of dutie, to perceiue, emong them all which afore other is to bee preferred.

            Of the which maters, briefly debated,The order of his treating. may be gathered: how mē ar wonte not onely to doute, whether a thing be honest, or dishonest: but also twoo honest thinges layed before them, whether is the honester.

We bee longer in this place, than neede requires. For who is he, to whom those things ar not manifest, which in mo woordes bee recited of Panetius? that neither anie captein in warre, nor prince at home, could haue atchieued greate feates, & auailable, without mēnes endeuour. Kehersed of him is Themistocles, Pericles, Cyrus, Agesilaus, Alexander: whom he denieth to haue bene able to commepasse so great thirgs, without the ayde of men. In a mater nowhit doutfull, he vseth witnesses nowhit necessarie.
            And as we obtein great commodities, by the like minde, and consenteThe eruelnes of men, one against another. of men: so ther is none so lothesomme a pestilence, which dothe not growe to man by man.

            Seeing then this place hath no maner of doute, but that men both profit, and hurte menne veriemuch:By vertue must men bee wonne to our vse. I pointe this to bee a propertie of vertue, to winne mennes heartes to her, and binde them to her vse. Therfore whatso in things liuelesse, and whatso in the vse, and occupyeng of beastes is done profitablie to mannes life: it is all appointed to the laboursomme trades.

For the mater goeth not well: whē thesame that should bee wrought by vertue, is attempted by money. But bicause manie times this helpe is necessarie: we will tell, how it

ought to bee vsed, if first wee shall haue spoken of those things, which bee nerer to vertue.

            And certesse of all things neither is ther anie fitter to mainteine a power thā to be loued, neither anie vnfitter than to be feared. Notablie saith Ennius:

But lette a roughnesse hardilie bee vsed of them: who by rule doo keepe straite such as bee brought vnder by force: as of maisters ouer seruauntes, if they can not otherwise bee stayed. But who in a free citie so order themselues, that they be feared: ther can nothing possiblie bee madder, than they bee. For although the lawes bee sounke by sōme mānes might: allthough libertie bee alltoshaken: yet at length they swimme out again, either by secrete iudgements, or by priuie voices in auauncing to honour: and certesse the stinges of ceased libertie bee sharper, thā of libertie continued. Let vs then embrace yt, which moste largelie spredeth: & moste auaileth not onely to safetie, but also to welth, & power:

For what think wee of the first Dionysius?Dionysius the tyraunt, a mōg the Syracusians. with what torment of feare was he wonte to be troubled? who, fearing the barbers razers, with a reddehot cole singed of his owne berde.

to fauour them, in whom we think those vertues to be. And these verilie be the weightiest causes of fauoring: for othermo lighter ther maie be beside.
            But, that a trust may be had in vs, by two thinges it may be broughtHow to get a credit. to passe: if we shall be thought to haue atteined prudence ioined with iustice.

For all men do iudge this the profitable, and true prudence. But in such wise credit is giuen to iust, and trustie mē (that is) to good mē: that in them ther is no suspicion of deceite, and iniurie. Therfore to these our life, to these our goodes, to these our childern we suppose verie well to be cōmitted. Of these twoo then iustice is of more power to wi a credit: bicause it without prudēce hathe sufficient authoritie, prudēce

For, the sutteler, and the craftier that a man is: so much the more he is hated, and suspected, when the opinion of his honestie is pulled awaie. Wherfore iustice ioyned with vnderstanding, shall haue as much power, as it list, to purchase credit: iustice wtoute prudēce shal be of much power, prudēce wtout iustice shall be nothīg worth. But leste sōme man haue maruail: seeing amongst all philosophers itwhy he seuereth vertues, coupled by nature. is plaine, and by miself disputed often: him, that should haue one vertue, to haue all the vertues: why I do now sonder them so, as though ther may anie man be iust, which same is not prudent: of one sorte, is yt suttlenesse, when verie trouth is leueled in disputation: & of an other sorte is yt talk, whē it is all applied to the cōmon opiniō.

            Princelie dothe Philippus, in aPhiliphus to Alexander certein epistle, accuse Alexander, his sonne: that, by lauishnesse, he hunteth after the good will of the Macedonians. VVhat reason, in a mischiefe, quoth he, hath brought you into this hope? that ye should think, those wolde be to you faithfull,

whome you had corrupted with money.
            
            
               VVhy? go ye aboute this, that the Macedonians may think you not their king, but their seruaunt and briber?
            
            Well, he sayd, seruaūt, and briber, bicause it is vile for a king. Better also he sayd, in that he called largegiuing corruption. For he, that receiueth, is made the worsse therby, and the redier alwaies to looke for the like. This said he to his sonne: but let vs think it giuen in precept to vs all. Wherfore this certeinlie is no doute: but that same liberalitie, which standeth in trauail, and diligence, bothe is honester, and also spreddeth farder, and is able to profit mo. Oftentimes yet a manGiftes giuīg. must giue largelie: and this kinde of liberalitie is not to bee vtterlie cast of: and wee must manie times giue parte of our substaūce to mete men, that haue need: but wee must doo it heedfullie, and measurablie. For diuers haue spoilde oute their liuelod, by lauishing it vnaduisedlie.wastefulnes. But what is folisher, than to cause, that you cā no lenger doe the thing, which ye loue to doe? And

also spoile foloweth of lauishnesse.

            A measure is to be kept, and let it bee referred to abilitie.

            And therfore I maruail, whatTheophrastus praiseth sumptuousnesse. camme in Theophrastus minde, in that boke, which he wrote of riches: wherin he spake manie thinges notablie, but this, oute of course. For he is much in praising greate sumptuousnesse, and furnishment of peoplepleasing showes: and he deemeth the ablenesse of such charges to bee the frute of riches. But methinketh that frute of liberalitie, wherof I haue putte a fewe examples, is bothe greater, and more certain.

The holle maner then of such largesse generallie is faultie, yet for certein times it is necessarie: & then the same is bothe to bee referred to ones abilitie, and to bee tempered with a meankeeping.
            But in that other kinde of largegiuīg,Liberalitie. which proceedes of liberalitie, not all alike in causes vnlike, we ought to be disposed. Otherwise is his case, who is pressed with miserie: & otherwise his, who seeketh more welth, hauing no aduersitie.

            But whatso is giuen to a good man, and a thankfull: therby bothe ther commes frute from him, & also frō other. For so rashnesse be auoided, liberalitie is verie pleasureful: and somuch themore ernestlie most men praise it: bicause euerie greate mannes goodnesse is the common refuge of all.

            For what is more praiseworthy, & better, than eloquence? either for y• admiration of the hearers, or the hope of the needers, or for their cause, who haue been defended.
            Therfore to this likewise a preeminence in all honour was giuen of our elders. The benefites then, and the pleading of a finespoken man,

and gladlie taking paines, and (as it is in his countrie fashion) bothe not vnwillinglie, and also freelie defending manie mennes causes, be farre spredd abrode.
            The mater hath put me in minde:Discontinuaunce of eloquence. that in this place also I shoulde bewaile the discontinuance, I will not saie the destruction of eloquēce: but yt I feared, leste touching miself somewhat I shoulde seeme to complaine.

WherforeSet the good before the riche. I think a benefite better to bee bestowed vpon good men, than vpō riche. Yet allwaies we must giue our endeuour, that we may content all maner of men: but if the mater shall cōme into comparison: verilie Themistocles is to be taken for anThemistocles author: who, when he was asked coūsel, whether one should bestowe his daughter vpon a good pooremā, or a riche manne not so honest: I (quoth he) do rather like a man, who lacketh money, than money, which wanteth a man.

For bothe by wicked warre, and power, being put of from commonweale maters, and iudiciall causes, we take our quiet leasure: & for that cause leauing the citie, and walking abrode in the countrie, oftentimes we be alone. But neither this leasure is to be compared with Africanus leasure: nor this solitarinesse, with that of his. For he ceasing from the goodlie ministration of the commonweale, tooke himself leasure otherwhile: and from the prease, and resorte of men, now and than into a solitarie place, as into a hauen, withdrewe himself.

Allthough Africanus did gette greater praise, euen in my iudgement: yet no monuments of his witte put in writing, no worke of his quiet life, no frute of his solitariness remaines abrode. Wherof it must needes bee gathered: that he, by earnest occupyeng of his minde, and by beating oute those things, which by musing he atteined:

The promise rather shuld not haue been kept, than so hainous a deede should be cōmitted. Wherfore promises also, many times, ar not to be perfourmed.

            What if one, who hath lefte money wt you to kepe, would make warre against your countrie? shall ye restore, that was layde ye to keepe? No, as I suppose: for ye shall doo against the commonwelth, which ought to bee moste dere vnto you. So, manie things, which by nature seeme to bee honest, by chaūge

of times, becomme dishonest. To perfourme promises, to stande to couenauntes, to restore that is layde ye to keepe, when it otherwise behoueth: it becommeth dishonest. And of these, which seeme to bee cases of profite, contrarie to iustice, vnder pretence of wisdome: I think it sufficientlie declared.
            But for as much as, in our first boke, we haue drawne all duties, out of foure fountaines of honestie: we shall continue styll in the same: when we teache, what enemies of vertue those thinges bee: which séeme to bee profitable, and ar not so in dede.
            And thus of wisdom, whom wylinesse would resemble: and likewise of iustice, which is alwayes profitable, we haue discoursed.
            The other two partes of honestie remain: wherof the one is sene in the greatnesse, and worthinesse of an excellent corage: the other,Manlinesse. in the framing, and measuring of stayednesse, and temperaunce.Temperaūce.
               
It seemed profitable to Ulysses (asComparing of profit with manlinesse Ulysses. somme tragicall poetes haue sette it oute: for in Homer, the best author, ther is no such suspicion of Ulysses) but the tragedies doo laye it as a reproche to him: that, by coūterfeting madnesse, he wolde haue scaped going a warrefare. It was no honest deuise. Yet profitable it was (as somme perauenture will saye) to rule, and to liue quietly at Ithaca, with his parents, with his wife, & with his sonne.

            When Marcus Attilius Regulus,Marcus Regulus. being second time Consul, was taken by a traine in Afrik: Xantippus the Lacedemoniā being the guyde: and Amilcar, Annibals father, the generall: he was sent to the Senate vpon his othe: that except certein gentlemen taken prisoners wer restored to thē Penes, he should himself return to Carthage. When he was comme to Rome, he sawe well

the showe of profit: but, as the mater proueth, he iudged it verie vain: which was but on this sort: to tarie still in his countrie: to bee at home with his wife, and children: to kepe his degree of Consular estate: and to take the miserie, which he had felt in warre, to be common to warrefaring fortune. Who can denye these thinges to bee profitable? What think you? Greatnesse of corage, and manlinesse saith nay to it. Loke ye for more substantial authorities? For of these vertues it is the pr

He cāme into the Senate: declared y• he had in cōmaundemēt: refused to giue his sentence: and sayde, he was no Senatour, as long as he was bounde by othe ministred by his enemies. Yea and this moreouer he sayde (O foolish manne, will somme saye, and against his owne profit) that it was not expedient to haue the

captiues restored. For he alledged, they were yonge, and good capteins: whereas he was worne, and spent with age. Whose authoritie when it had preuailed: the captiues were kept styll: he himself returned to Carthage: and neither loue of his countrie, nor of his kinsfolke stayed him. Yet was it not vnknowne to him, that he returned to a verie cruell enemie, and to extreme tormentes: but he thought his othe meete to bee perfourmed. Wherefore, euen at that time, when he was putte to death with continuall waking: he was in better state: than if he had remained an aged captiue, and a persured Senatour at home.

            What greater harm could Iupiter  haue done, being offended, than Regulus did to himself?. Ther was

then no respect of religion, y• might ouerturn so great a profit.
            What? should he haue done dishonestlie? First, of euils the leste wer to be chosen. Shall then this dishonestie haue in it so much discommoditie, as had that torment?

            Hereunto they adde: that as wee  saye, sōme things seeme profitable, which ar not so in deede: that they in like maner saye, somme thinges seeme honest, which ar not so in deede: as for example, this same seemeth honest, that he did returne to torment, for the sauing of his othe

            They laye also to this: that whatso  is verie profitable, y• same groweth

likewise to bee honest, although it seemed not so at first.
            These things commonlie be alledged against Regulus. But lette vs consider the first.
            Jupiter was not to be feared, lest  he should hurt him in his anger: bicauseAnswer to the first obiection. neither to bee angrie, nor to do harme he is accustomed. This reason surelie maketh nomore against Regulus, than against all kinde of othes. But in an othemaking, not what the feare, but what the vertue of it is, ought to bee considered,An othe. For an othe is a religious assuring of any thing. And whatso assuredly you haue promised, as taking god to witnesse: it ought to bee obserued. For y• othe now respectes not the wrathe of the godds, which is none at all: but iustice, and faithfulness. For notablie said Ennius.
            
               
                  
                     O heauenly Faith, tye to thy wings
                  the othe of Ioue also.

               cetours would needs haue to stand in our Capitole, next vnto yt great,

and mightie Ioue.
            Yea but Jupiter, being displeased, coulde not haue done more harme to Regulus, than Regulus did to himself.
            That is true: if ther were nothing euill, but to fele paine. But the philosophers,Paine. that be of the greatest au thoritie, do affirme: that it not onely is not the vttermost euill, but also no euyll at all. For whō, I praye ye, do not refuse to take Regulus, as no meane witness, but (I beleue) y• grauest of al. For what more substatial witness do we loke for, thā a pere of the cōmonweale: who, for y• cōtinuing of his dutie, did willinglie enter into torments?
            For wheras they saye, of euyls the  least ar to be chosen: meaning it is better dishonestly, than miserablye to liue: is ther any greater euyll, than dishonestie? Which if in theDishonestie. deformitie of the bodie it breedeth sōme osfēce: how much must needs that corruption, and filth of a defyled minde appeare?

For first of al, where shall ther be a place appointed for wisdom? What? meane thei, that on euerie side she shoulde seeke after delicacies?

            After what sort then the mater is to be resolued, if at any tyme profit in apparaunce dothe striue with honestie: it is before sufficiently debated.
