               THe Queenes Maieſtie being of late time infourmed by the Ambaſſadour here reſident for her good brother the kyng of Spayne, that ſundry euyll diſpoſed & rebellious people inhabitauntes within the ſayd kynges lowe countries had come into this her Realme, and from thence were ſecretly returned into the ſayde lowe countreis, where they dyd commit many robberyes, ſpoyles, and murders: herevpon both for the inquiſition of the trueth hereof, and to prouide remedy therin, did geue ſpeciall charge to her officers of all her Portes frontyng vpon the ſaide lowe countreis, to enquire whether any kynde of people that myght be ſuſpected of ſuch crymes, or of the intentions to commit the ſame, had ſo reſorted into her Realme, whom to apprehende (if they coulde be founde) they ſhoulde vſe all diligence, and to foreſee that none herafter in whom any ſuch ſuſpition coulde be noted, ſhoulde be either receaued into her Portes, or be licenced to returne with any furniture for mayntenaunce of their rebellion or other lyke cryme. Whervpon although her Maieſtie had no aduertiſement from any officers of her Portes of any ſuch default to haue ben committed, although many other perſons of the ſayde lowe countrey of late tyme were arriued, partly in their accuſtomed maner for trade of Marchaundize, partly to enioy in this Realme a quietneſſe of their cōſciences in the ſeruice of god, which they preferred afore al worldly reſpectes of their natiue countreis, poſſeſſions, or friendes, a matter very lamentable: Yet her Maieſtie being agayne required by the ſayde Ambaſſadour to cauſe the foreſaide orders to be more generally and effectually directed to all maner her Portes, for that it had ben newly infourmed to him that in ſome places for lacke of diligent regarde, there were diuers that dyd purpoſe ſecretely to imbarke them ſelues towardes the lowe countreis with armour and ſuch like, to the intent to rebell agaynſt the ſayde kyng, & to commit other horrible crymes: Her Maieſtie meanyng in no wyſe to permit any ſuch kynde of euyll diſpoſed people to haue either acceſſe or ſuccour in any part of her dominions, ſtraightly willeth and chargeth all and euery her officers and miniſters, of what qualitie ſoeuer the ſame be, hauing office or charge in any her Portes or Creekes, as they wyll aunſwere at their vttermoſt perils, that they ſuffer none of the ſayde kynges ſubiectes, in whom may be founde any apparaunt ſuſpition of rebellion agaynſt the ſayde kyng, or of the committyng or intention to commit any murder or robbery, to lande in any place of her dominions: but that the ſame perſons ſo to be ſuſpected may be ſtayed, and his or their ſtate and condition duely enquired of. And if it ſhall any wiſe appeare, that he or they may be duely ſuſpected: that the ſame ſhalbe either ſtayed or repelled, and not ſuffered to abyde or haue any ſuccour within her Maieſties dominion. And like wiſe that no ſubiectes of the ſayde kyng, nor any other perſon of the Queenes Maieſties dominion, beyng armed or otherwiſe furniſhed to ſerue lyke a man of warre, be ſuffered to depart out of the Realme towardes the ſayde lowe countreis, without certayne proofe and knowledge that the ſame preparation & furniture is meant to ſerue for the defence of any ſhippes of Marchaundize tradyng to any place for Marchaundize only, or for the apprehention of Pirates, as the caſe may neceſſaryly require. And if any to the contrary ſhall attempt the ſame, then to ſtay them in ſafetie to be foorth commyng, and to aduertiſe her Maieſtie or her counſayle attendyng vpon her perſon, of the qualities of the ſayde perſons and their furniture, ſo as puniſhment and remedy may be ſpedyly geuen accordyng to the qualitie of the offence, and to ſuch treaties as for the like caſes haue ben prouided betwixt both their Maieſties progenitours and predeceſſours.
            
               Yeuen at her Maieſties Manour of Haueryng the .xv. day of Iuly, in the yere of our Lorde God. 1568. and the tenth yere of her Maieſties raigne.
               
GOD ſaue the Queene.
