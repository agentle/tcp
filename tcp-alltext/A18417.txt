                  SVch is the wilfull pouertie
of iudgements (sweet Ma:) wandring
like pasportles men, in contempt of the
diuine discipline of Poesie, that a man

            That, Enargia, or cleerenes of representation, requird in absolute
Poems is not the perspicuous deliuery of a lowe inuention;
but high, and harty inuention exprest in most significant, and vnaffected
phrase; it serues not a skilfull Painters turne, to draw the
figure of a face onely to make knowne who it represents; but hee
must lymn, giue luster, shaddow, and heightning; which though
ignorants will esteeme spic'd, and too curious, yet such as haue the
iudiciall perspectiue, will see it hath, motion, spirit and life.

            Obscuritie in affection of words, & indigested concets, is pedanticall

other should be more worthely glorious, nor professing sacred
Poesie in any degree,) I thought good to submit to your apt iudgment:

                  And enuious light. The downward burning flame,
                  Of her rich hayre did threaten new accesse,

                  Then cast she off her robe, and stood vpright,
                  As lightning breakes out of a laboring cloude;
                  Or as the Morning heauen casts off the Night▪

               Thus made they amorous excesse,
               Both Virgins, and both Princesses:
               Fayre Phillis wore a liberall tresse,
               But Flora, hers in curls did dresse.

               Nor in their ornamentall grace,
               Nor in behauiour were they base,
               Their yeeres and mindes in equall place,
               Did youth and his effects embrace.
