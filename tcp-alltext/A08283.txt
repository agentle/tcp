            To the right Worshipfull Sir Henry Kniuet Knight, and Lady Elizabeth his wife: Their humble seruant Iohn Norden, wisheth happines heere, and after this life eternall felicitie.
            
               
                  THales a wise Philosopher, beeing demaunded what was the hardest thing in the world, aunswered, for a man to know himselfe, beeing then demanded what was the easiest thing, he answered for a man to giue good counsaile vnto another. Both which his resolutions, to the sayde demaunds, I may be thought rightly to verify, by this mine enterprise, beeing of so slender iudgment, and young of experience, taking vpon me to discribe vnto the learned and wyse, a forme for their better instruction, wherein many may condemne my selfe, in neglecting the principles of the same. But (right worshipful, notwithstanding my weaknes) my good meaning, is not heerein altogether to be condemned, who of my selfe am nothing, and can doo nothing, Sed Deus bene facientes adiuuat, God is euer ready to further the good attempts of euery man, his hand is ready to guyde the pen of all that endeuour to

glorifie his name by their dooings, from whom if I should not acknowledge all godly desires to proceede, and attribute the benefit of euery mans godly trauaile vnto his prouident care of our welfare I should not but thinke my selfe an enemy vnto his diuinity. VVherby incurring his heauy displeasure, my trauaile should turne to mine own trouble, and my desired prayse vnto my deserued paines: But for asmuch as Lex domini imaculata est, conuertans animas, testimonium eius fidele sapientiam prestaus paruulis. The Law of the Lord beeing vndefiled conuerting the soule, his testimony faithfull and gyuing wisedome euen to the babes and little ones, mine hope is that his hand was the directour of my pen, and his grace the gouernour of my heart in my proceeding: and as my selfe haue had, no small comfort and sweetenes, in the exercise thereof already. And so much as I perswade my selfe it can not be, but likewise beneficiall to such as in 
                  •
               eale shall vouchsafe to bestowe some time in the faythfull practise thereof. Notwithstanding, some will say there is prayer bookes inough (in my iudgement) not too many, so that they bee consonant and agreeable to that forme of prayer which Christ himselfe sette downe and prescribed, wherein is conteyned sixe petitions or requests vnto God, whereof the three first are for the setting forth of the glory of God, the three last pertayne onely to our owne commodities, as for all thinges necessarye for our bodies for remission of sinnes, and to bee preserued from temptations which concerne the soule, in which sixe petitions, is conteyned the some of all prayers whatsoeuer.

And as it hath beene lawfull for the zealous & godly for their owne godly practise, heeretofore to writ, & the same for the benefit of others allowed to bee published, I presume, (acknowledging my trauaile altogether inferior to those) to cōmit this my practise to the Print, not deemeing it of my selfe worthy, but by the iudgment of others, learned, perswaded to consent therevnto, the rather wylling for that my purpose in wryting, and intent in publishing rightly wayed, and the matter duely considered, none (or rather the lesse) by reason of your good countenaunce wyll seeme to vomit out theyr contēptuous termes of the worke or reproches of the poore paintaker, as against the best booke, and most zealous Author that euer wrote, the enuious haue doone, but for mine owne part, I hold me rather woorthy rebuke then reward, for wading so farre into that that belongeth vnto the zealous, learned, and men of most sounde iudgement to sette foorth, and I (beeing as it were ignoraunt) should put before the eyes of such as haue bothe knowledge and wisedome, a glasse or spectacle for their better light and furtheraunce when as (in deede) I should rather repayre vnto them, as blinde, for theyr ayde to direct my selfe. But (right worshipfull) acknowledging my fault heerein (vpon hope of your taking it in good part) I presume to present this my simple trauaile vnto you, taking it in hand with no lesse good meaning vnto the highnes (my light, & guyde) with no lesse good will to you, then he who hath deserued farre better for his trauaile, I haue intituled it A pensiue mans practise: and I thinke (not vnfitly) who in my too much

liberty in the seruice of the right worshipfull, Lady Ann Knyuet, your late disceased mother, and my good Lady and Mistresse, spending many dayes in idlenes and voyd of good (but in fryuolous) exercises, among many inclyning to theyr owne pleasaunt deuises, considering that S. Ierom sayth that Per publicā viam non ambulemus we shoulde not walke after the moste: And weying the sentence of Terence, who sayth (truely) that Omnes deteriores sumus licentia, All men are the worsse for too much liberty. I withdrewe me from their so familiar society, insomuch, as I was thought of some sulleyne, of some prowde, of some foolish, and none past with out his verdite of my solitarines, wherevnto vpon these considerations, I had drawne mine vntoward desires, in so much, as by sundry sodaine passions, and greefes of heart, for thinges passed and to come, I was often perplexed, the grace of God (onely of his mercy) more preuailing with me, thē an infinite troope of carnall perswasions I betooke me to often & sundry prayers vnto almighty God in all my perplixities, and troubles, with earnest de sire to the reading of that, that most might stirre my dulled and vntoward minde to the desire therevnto, whereby by little and little, feeling a certaine inwarde sweetenes and comfort, to grow in myne heart, by the practise thereof, (the flesh being alwayes repugnant) it began to be of such force, & to my comfort in my necessities, as I thought it a fitte practise in allpensiuenes, a practise in all perplexities most precious, in all distresses most delectable yee in all thynges, in all places, at all

tymes most requisite and comfortable, which (although some wyll condemne my circumstaunce) mooued mee to gyue it the tytle of A pensiue mans practise, which (I speake not to myne owne glory) I woulde that euery one in all extreamityes would vse the same (I meane prayer) he should finde comfort therein, yea he shoulde finde (as I know by experience) pleasure in perplexitye, for no thing mooueth sooner desire of inuocation vpon God thē bodely necessities, for the pleasure of the body taketh away the good desire of the soule, we ought to pray for the gyft of the spirite of God, and then shall not our desires depart empty away, a zealous and faythfull inwarde desire, without motion of the tongue in our distresse, sendeth vppe euen to the throne of God so sweete a sauour. That euen the holy ghost, in our greatest pensiuenes, wylbe most ready to giue assistaunce to our good desires, and wyll bring the same to most wished perfection. But corruption aboundeth in all men, all men are prone to doo euyll euen by nature, and none there is that dooth good, no not one. The spyryte is often wylling, but the flesh is alwayes weake, we must therefore pray continually, and when we are so dull as that the outward showe dooth argue insufficient feruency, in vs hauing (yet) a longing desire. Let vs then in hart▪ faythfully say: Oh Lord increase our faith, and let vs bee occupyed in continuall contemplation of heauenly thinges, and no doubt but dulnes will soone vanish, and the spirit haue his effecte: for it is not the tongue onely or lippes, that maketh the sacrifice of prayer, sweete and acceptable to God, but an

humbled minde, a contrite and sorrowfull spirit, declyning from sinne, and inclyning to God: wherefore it behooueth vs vnder the burden of our sins, with Dauid to groane in heart, saying, wee haue sinned, we haue doone amisse, we haue dealt wickedly, and in the name of that seconde Adam, let vs pray for power to tread the fruites of the first Adam vnder our feete, for of our selues we are weake, we are of no force to remooue that is euill, or to imbrace and follow that which is good, but all what good is commeth from God, to whom we ought at all times to bend our repentaunt heartes, and pray him for his sweete and welbeloued sonne Iesus Christes sake to shew vs and guide vs, by the working and direction of his holy spirite, the right pathe vnto the kingdome of heauē, that all things▪ as wel ghostly as bodely, may be ministred vnto vs. It were superfluous to make any great collection of proofes, of the singuler effect of this most excellent practise, of earnest & faythfull prayer, for praying in the name of Christ, he shall obteyne whatsoeuer hee knoweth needefull for vs, examples whereof are infinite, wherefore, omitting further discourse, I haue sett before euery perticuler prayer, certaine godly motions vnto the prayer following, the rather to induce and stirre vppe the godly minded to the vse thereof: hoping by his assistāce, by (whose these small fruites haue proceeded,) to performe the execution of my small Tallant, to a further benefit of others heereafter: It resteth now (right worshipfull) to pray your fauourable pardon, for presuming to publish the same vnder your good acceptaunce, not

standing in deede, long in suspence, to whose handes firste to committe my trauaile. But your woonted clemencye, wisedome, and zeale, soone stirred my willing minde to present it vnto your selues, dismaid at nothing, but at the simplenes of the painetaker onely, who beeing in all respectes poore, presenteth this day a poore gift, praying pardon for his boldnes, and lawfull fauour at your handes for his rewarde. And though many be the precious giftes, that this day passe from one to another, and they tende (but as the smallest and simplest) to the remembraunce of the newe yeere, I most humbly beseech your worships willingly to accept this handfull of cold water, flowing from the fountaine of the well of life, which gift as it is not mine: so I craue but contentation at your hands & wylling enterteinment of the simple messenger, the presentor heerof, & with him to giue thanks to the heauenly giuer. In whom as all wisdome consisteth, so I humbly pray hym to instill into our hearts, that water of heauenly life, his holy spirite to direct vs al, to perfect perfection in heauē
               ly things for his sons sake, in whose name I hartely wyshe you as a whole & happy new yeere, & many heereafter to his wil, so new ioyes heere, and in the end eternall ioyes of eternall blisse. Westminster. 22. December.
            
               Your worships bound and obedient Seruaunt.

hath beene thy fatherly care of me, this night past that the sleepe which thou hast giuen me, is most cōfortable, bothe to my bodie, and soule, in so much, as I am the more aptly giuen to the execution, of my worldlie busines, and the seruice of thy diuine maiestie this morning, wherein asist me (sweete Lorde) with the helpe of thine holie spirite, comfort and defende me this day and euer, with thy mercifull ayde, that none affliction, hurte, or misfortune, dismay me, no tribulation or anguish of minde draw me from thee, no worldlie care, delight, or fantasie, carrie me at any time into anie wicked cogitation, action, or speeche, for (Lord) I knowe that it is not thy wil, that any euill shouldedwell in vs, or that we shoulde at anie time offende thee, but to keepe our hearts pure and vndefiled, as a fitte receptacle for thy Maiestie. Yet thou sufferest sometimes, vnlawfull affections to haue the vpper hande, to the end, that we (feeling our weaknes, and corruption) should wholie confesse, all our strength, all our godlie cogitations, and workes, to proceede from thee. And for that all flesh is full of sinne, and that the iust fall seauen times a day, forgiue (Lord) my wickednes, mine offences, and sinne committed, either this night past, by foolish dreames fantasies, or other temptations, or at anie time since I came into this miserable worlde, beeing a moste sinfull creature: and that (beeing pardoned by thy

mercie in Iesus Christ, I may proceede in the residue of my dayes (gouerned by thy holie spirite) voyde of all offences, vsing my vocation and calling so, as may be to the setting foorth of thy glorie, maintenaunce of thy fauoure towardes me, and getting those thinges which may be sufficient for the maintenaunce of mine estate heere, and for the reliefe of such as are committed to my charge; And graunt me alwaies, such regarde of seruing thee, as thine hande may alwaies directe mee to good and happy successe, in all mine affayres; Blesse thou the worke of mine handes (good Lorde) and graunt mee so to flye ydlenes, the mother and Nurce of all euill, that both this day and all my life, I may, by godlie care and trauaile, get me a sufficient, & competent liuing heere, that I be no burden and charge to such as are rich and welthie, nor depend vpon the succor, helpe▪ and furtheraunce of others, whose helpe is moste slippery and deceitfull Least that in hope thereof, I giuing my selfe to ydlenes, and loytering (when their helpe shalbe with-holden from me) I be driuen (as the wise man sayth) to goe in a ragged coate, & to want my foode. But contrary wise (Oh Lorde) graunt that I may so imploy my selfe, to laboure, and dilligent execution of thy busines, this day and euer, that, I may (through my blessing) luckelie prosper therein, and shew my selfe so helpefull to the poore impotent and needy, as the fruite of my trauaile, shall extende vnto. That thou maiest fulfill

Lord thy mercie is infinite, and thy loue towardes vs vnspeakeable, wherefore giue me grace, alwayes to serue thee, yea at all times and in all places both in laboure and rest, welth, and pouertie, sicknes and health, yea all my life and at the howre of my death, that I may passe this day, and all the rest of my transitorye life, in the fulfilling of thy lawes, and be readie at thy fauourable becke and call, to come and appeare before thy throne of mercie, in perfect hope, of thy louing receiuing me into the bosome of thy sweete imbracinges, not for my woorthines or d

I yeelde the humble and hartie thankes, for defending & sauing mee, thy sinfull creature, this night past, and all my life hethervnto, frō suddaine death, and from other perrils & daungers, wher into my sillie soule and weake bodie are subiecte to fall. And wherewith I am so besette, that (had I not beene preserued by thee) it could not otherwise haue beene, but my bodie had perished, and my sillie soule beene carryed into eternall perdition.
                  
                     But most sweete Lord, my strong Castell & defence, my shield & buckler, my sure refuge, and succour, who hast continuall regarde of the safety of thy seruants, that thou neuer sufferest them to bee ouercome with any kinde of euill, nor to fall into any kinde of daunger: vouchsase to forgiue me what soeuer I haue committed, and doone against thy diuine will, eyther sleeping or waking, this night or anie time (secretlie or openlie) heeretofore, by reason of the corruption which remaineth in me.
                  And vouchsafe, that as I haue quietlie passed this night, so I may enioy, at thy merciful hands whatsoeuer thy fatherlie prouidence, shall thinke meete and conuenient, for mine owne, and for the releefe, of such as thou hast committed vnto my charge, and gouernement.
                  
                     Establish (good Lorde) within my weake & feeble bodie, strength, to withstande all euill motions of the flesh, all vngodlie desires of the minde, & worldlie vanities, that I may feruentlie (as I ought) continuallie, both in the morning and at night, and at noone day, yea and at all times, and in all places, truely serue thee, without hypocrisie, dissimulation, or mallice. And for thy mercies sake, keepe mee this day, and all the rest of my transitory life, from suddaine and vnprouided death, keepe my tongue and lips, that I speake or vtter nothing, which may be eyther vncomelie to be spoken, or whereof may redownde hurt, or hinderaunce to my selfe or others, but that I may endeuoure (as much as in me lyes) to speake and vtter those thinges, which may be, to the setting foorth of thy glorie, maintenaunce of peace and concorde, and to the reducing such into the right way, as wander and goe astray; As for slaundering, lying, backbyting, falsewitnes bearing, enuie, and such like, (good Lorde) take vtterly from me. And keepe mine heart and minde, from the moste damnable sinne of murmuring against thee, and from dyspayre, that in all aduersities, tribulations, and troubles, I may alwayes, beare, a patient, contented, faithfull, and a thankfull minde, with full perswasion, that if thou suffer, mine aduersaries (being maliciousliebent against me) to reuile me, persecute me, to molest or hurte me, or if thou permitt either fire to consume me, or my substaunce, or any other

casuall meane to diminish mine estate, and stay of my liuing, or if I sustaine losse of freendes, sicknes of bodie, or hurt of my limmes, it proceedeth not but by thy diuine prouidence, yea onelie of thy meere loue, and fatherlie care, which thou hast of mine amendment: for nothing happeneth to those whome thou louest (breede it within theyr weake mindes neuer so great greefe, or fall it out neuer so contrary, to theyr desires) but it bringeth with it some secrete working, for their good. Wherefore in the name of thy sonne Iesus Christ, I most humbly beseeche thee, that thou wilt vouchsafe, to settle in mine heart, such perfection of patience, as what soeuer, eyther this day or heereafter shall happen or befall vnto me, I may accept it as a most wholesome medicine, for my so deadlie disease of securitie, and so in hope of thy louing kindnes, and mercie to goe forwarde this day, and all my life, in perfect loue, vnfeyned zeale, and continuall obedience to thy will. In hearing thy worde attentiuelie, in reading the same dilligentlie, in following it effectually, and in praying vnto thee zealously, and faithfully, imbracing all goodnes willingly, and auoyding all euill watilie, that so spending this day, I may the better proceede to the execution of my calling, this weeke following, to the releefe of my necessitie, & furtheraunce of my neighbours; That so continuing vnto the ende, I may receiue the reward of thy celestiall kingdome, which thy sonne Iesus Christe

hath purchased with his bloode, for all true beleeuers in thee. In number of whome (sweete Lorde) for the merytes of him thy sonne, make me, that I with them, and they with me, may continually sing laude and prayse vnto the Trinitie eternallie, which graunt for thy sonne Iesus Christ his sake.

In so much (Oh Lord) as he, our father, purchased for vs his children, none other possession or inheritaunce, but the vnhappy enteraunce into sinne and corruption; And we his children, beeing by succession ingrossed in this detestable stocke of sinne, haue hethervnto (notwithstanding thy most louing, and by so sundry meanes, calling vs by thine holye Gospell of comfort) continued therein, to our vtter perdition, deserued death and distruction, confessing and acknowledging our selues, runnagates, outcastes and trewantes, and of our selues altogether vnable, to cast away and lay aside, these workes of darknes, and to obteine againe the Lanterne of light.

                  ALthough that wee can not at all times, duely examine our selues as concerning our life past, yet once in the day it is most requisite to consider, howe we haue spent the time past: namely at night to weigh what we haue doon the day before, and in the morning, to consider, howe we haue past the night. For although the night was ordeyned for rest, yet as sayth Paule. 1. Thes 5. we should then watch and bee sober, singing prayses vnto the Lord, as Dauid did, Ps. 42 giuing him thankes for the helpe of his presence, that is to say, for his protection, the

                  FAith (as saith S. Paule vnto the Hebrues) Heb. 11 is a sure foundation of thinges hoped for & an euident feeling,

of the manifolde promises, which God the father hath made vnto vs, 1. Pet. 1 touching our saluation, in his sonne Christe our sauiour: and whereby also, wee already inwardely taste of the vnspeakable toyes wher of wee shalbe heereafter made full pertakers Heb. 11 in Heauen: without it wee can doo nothing: But by it Gal. 3. wee are blessed of him: and by it 1. Pet. 1 we are saued: by it Eph 6 are all the fiery darts of hell and sathan quenched. The iust man Aba. 2. shall liue by fayth: the daughter of the woman of Canaan, Ma. 8. was healed by the faith of her mother. Elias the Thesbyte, 3 Kin. 16. 17. through fayth was fed with Rauens in his distresse and hunger, hee prayed for rayne, and through fayth obteyned it: by his faith was the Oyle

of the widdowe of Zarphat encreased, Dan. 6. & her child raysed from death to life: The three Children were deliuered from the whot fornace by fayth, and Daniell out of the Lyons denne: by sayth the sinfull woman, Luk. 7. obteyned pardon: the Apostles by sayth. Act. 3. healed sundry diseases: Nowe wl at greater Iewell can there be had at the handes of God, then fayth: for haue fayth and all thinges foode sent from heauen: defence from Lyons: saftye from fire in the whott Ouen: forgiuenesse of sinnes: and whatsoeuer els, concerneth eyther body or soule: And therefore let it be a principall requeste vnto his Maiestie, that he will vouchsafe that gift. VVithout wauering aske it, and God will giue thee it aboundantly▪ VVithout sayth Heb. 11. it is impossible

to please God. Neyther can we haue accesse to Christe, Eod. without it, who is the Mediator betweene God the Father and vs.

feare thee, and serue in trueth, godlines, and sinceretie of life, is the onely way and meane to continue thy loue and fauour towardes vs, without the which, wee can not but perish. And beleefe and confidence in thy sonne Iesus Christe, the onely meane of our redemption, and attonement with thee, the onely holde of our saluation; whereof we can not be sufficiently assured, without thine especial gift of faith, which is the ancor, wherevnto the cable of our saluation is fastned. And beeing broken, the hope also of our saluation, decayeth & waxeth of none effecte plant therfore (most merciful God) one sparcke of true faith, in mine harte, that I may certainlye know thee, perfectly loue thee, and duely feare thee

Oh Lorde graunt me to take such holde, of his death, passion, resurrection, and assention, as by his death we may haue pardon by his resurrection, rise to righteousnes, & by his assention, ascende with him to celestiall glorie, and finally attribute the cause and meane of our saluatiō, to proceede onely by his passion.

and godlie behauiour, without the which (I cā fesse) faith cānot be, that I may bothe in life and conuersation, fulfill thy diuine will in all things, with-holde not from me (good Lorde) that singuler gift of thine which is the stay of our happines, & the want therof, a most certaine token of our perdition. It is the strength of the weake & feeble ones, the staffe & stay that guids the blind, the onlie way that leads vnto the vnspeakable ioies of eternal blisse, the meane to obteine, possesse, & enioy, the only good, which is the knowledge of thy will, the bande of mutuall peace, the Forte, the Castell, and comfort of a distressed minde, and the onelie harbour of a sorrowfull soule, no good thing wanteth to him, on whom thou vouchsafest to bestowe the same, to whom all thinges are light, in whom remaineth no darknes at all.
                  Banish therefore (sweete Lorde) all misbeleefe, all wauering, and doubting, out of mine heart, and plant insteede thereof, vnfeyned fayth, that applying the same to euery affliction, both of bodye and minde; I may vanquish and ouercome sathan, with stande the delightes of the worlde, and suppresse the corruptible motions of the flesh, ouercome my bodely enemies, and enioy at thy good pleasure, health of bodie, soundnes of minde, perfection of limmes,

(Lord) I beleeue, helpe mine vnbeleefe. Giue mee fayth but as the grayne of a Musterde seede, and I shall be able to doo great wonders, yea I shall bee able to remooue sathan, out of his desired habitation, expelling him and his ministers out of my minde, and walke no longer according to the will of the flesh, but casting away the workes of darknes, enioy the pure light of the Gospell, and perseuer and abide therein, enioying thy fauour & loue, vnto the ende, without fainting, in anie tribulation, or vexation of Spirite, going forwarde, in hope, in feare, in loue, and vnfeyned zeale towardes thee.

dyddest not, in respecte that thou beeing pure and without sinne, or will to sinne, were not so soone to bee wunne, as wee whose strength is weaknes, whose holines is meere corruption, & therfore was thy victorye lesse then ours: Sweete Iesus giue me thy strength, thine helpe, and the lighte of thy grace, to obteyne the victory, and to auoide his tyrannie. Saue me from the detestable crue of his ministers, for great are the conflictes which dayly arise in our consciences, betweene thy grace and sathan, betweene thy soirite, and our flesh, betweene thy diuine will, and the wicked worlde. Oh what an heauy burden is it, to beare the innumerable temptations which the deuill, the world and the fleshe doo ofter? and especially to those, that take not holde by the An

                  Oh sweete Iesus, guide the raynes of the bridle of my desires, that I runne not headlong into any vngodlie action, but beeing lead by the hande of faith, vnder the conduct of patience, I may ouercome this capitall, and archenemy of mine, that hee beeing once vanquished, his ministers may quaile and be discomfited, their craftie wilines wexe of none effect, and mine hope in thee, my loue towards

thee, and my feare of thee, daily increase. That the world with the desires therof, may die in me & I to it, that the vain dissembling showes therof, draw me not out of the way of truth. Strengthen me (sweete Iesus) in my conflictes, and temper them so with patience▪ that they may rather be Medicines, then maladies to my poore soule, and healthfull exercises that I neeuer thinke my selfe to be secure, but alwaies subiect to try all, for without exercise wee remaine vnskilfull, and without an enemie, we prepare not weapon, neither is victorie gotten without battaile, nor rewarde without victorie. Yet though we ouercome, the victory is not ours, but thine who fightest and ouercomest for vs, and yet such is thy loue, that thou giuest vs the rewarde, & crown, of victory. Make me strong (sweete Iesus) fortefye the Castell of my soule, with spirituall weapons, as with fayth, loue, hope, peace, long suffering, gentlenes, humblenes, thankfulnes, meekenes, strength, and patience, and such like, that I may continually withstand the prowde attemptes of these my ghostlie enemies, through thee, and by thee, sweete Iesus, mine onely sauiour and redeemer.
                  Amen.

                     ite of my neighbors. That I at no time, rashly, or vnaduised ly, leudly or loosly attēpt or determine any thinge

without thine especiall feare, duelie considering that thou art the author of all good thinges, and bringest prosperously to passe all godlie actions, attemptes, and purposes: And whatsoeuer is doon in secrete, or in intent to hide it from thy knowledge, which none (work he neuer so secretely) can doo although for a time it haue some sweete tast, namelie a fleshly delight some sauour, or likelyhoode of happy successe: vet is the ende thereof, bitter and most perilous, insomuch as it bringeth shame and confussion, to the so vnaduised enterprisers of the same. Lord thou sayest that a Sparrow can not light on the grounde, without thy permission, and prouidence, which is a creature of small value, in respect

of man, whom thou hast made to thine owne image and likenes, and whom thou accountest of more value then many Sparrowes: in respect whereof (good Lord) and for thy meere mercies sake, extende so thy fauourable care vnto me, thy frayle creature, that all mine intents may haue theyr beginning, by the working of thine holie spirite and mine actions end in the same, and not according to the motions, of mine owne foolish desires. Thou like a most louing father willest vs to take counsaile at thee, in all our exercises, concerning either bodie or soule, before we proceede too farre in them. Oh Lord blesse me, with thine heauenly inspiration, that my minde imagine nothing but what is according to the Lawe of righteousnes: Oh Lord blesse the workes of mine hands, the sight of mine eyes, blesse mine eares, that they hearkē not but to the hearing of godly and vertuous communication, and thine holie word, my tongue & lippes with decent speeche, and my feete that they may keepe the way of righteousnes. And place within the secret corners of my heart, such due regard what I goe about, or determine, as before I proceed to farr in request of good & luckie successe, I may vnderstād by the secrete working of thine holie spirite, whether my request bee according vnto thy will: And graunt that I neuer absolutelie craue thy furtherance, in accomplishing any my desires, vntil by the

same spirite, I be truelie resolued, that my desires be lawfull, consonaunt, and agreeable to thy diuine wyll, but may faithfully referre all my matters vnto thee, whether they be heard or not heard, whether presently or tarrying long, not giuing ouer, feeling in my selfe by thy grace, that it pleaseth thee, constantlie continuing, thy good pleasure, though it come not as I wish, let me not by and by fall from my good beginning, but perseuering in continuall prayers, for thine assistaunce, and fatherly helpe vnto the end, for thou hast promised neuer to deceiue our godly disires, nor to sende them away frustrate, mercifully heare me (Oh Lorde) in time conuenient. And attentiuely heare me, approching vnto thee, with vnfeyned desire, and hope of thy helpe, that when any plague, any affliction, misery or vexation shall come vpon me, when the want of any necessary thing oppresseth me, or accomplishing of any lawfull sute mooueth me, I flying vnto thee, as the fountaine from whence floweth all true helpe, all perfect assistaunce, all good successe, and prosperous euents of all godlie endeuours, not seeking any other by meane, either to auoide the one or to obteine the other, then thy fatherly directions and spirituall motions, I may obteyne the same, according vnto my necessities, and in thy good time oh heauenly God, for thy sonne our Lorde Iesus Christes sake, graunt this, sweete God.

with feare fall downe before the mercies seate of the highest iudge. Contemning our selues▪ to be moste vnrighteous, and iustly deseruing confusion. And then, (as S. Iohn sayeth) 1. Ioh. 1. 9. wee shall finde God moste mercifull vnto vs: who is most faithfull and iust to forgiue vs our sinnes: and to clense vs from al our vnrighteousnes for hee desireth not the death of a sinner, but that he turne from his wickednes and liue. And therfore as Ezekiell sayth, Ezek. 23. Turne you, turne you▪ from your wicked wayes, for why sayeth he, wil you dye in your sinnes: And againe Ioell sayth. Ioell 2. 13. Rent your hearts and not your garments, and turne to the Lorde your God. Because hee is gentle and mercifull, and of much mercy, and such a one as is

sorye for your afflictions, wherefore if thou bee afflicted in conscience by reason that thou haste beene a notorious offender, remember Mary Magdalen, whose wickednes was great, vpon repentaunce, receyued pardon, as also the theefe and the Publicau and many other: Dispayre not, but in heartie prayer, and by vnfeyned repentaunce, turne to the Lord.

                     nous offences, and am moste sorye for my sins, which are so vile, & the burden of them so intollerable, that when I turne mine eyes but to the beholding them a farre off, I am by and by, stryken with so great dreade that I am driuen to most heauie sighes, greeuous groanes, and thinke my life an enemie vnto mee, wishing the beginning of my dayes, had beene the day of my departure out of this miserable worlde. But (moste sweete Lorde) when I note them perfectlie in my minde, & take as it were a straight account, what the deedes of my youth haue beene, (beeing indeede) most lewde, most euill, most vile, and sinfull, what a terror doo I suffer in minde? what a dungion of dollours, doth open it selfe (as it were) to swallowe mee vp? what gryping greefes doo torment my poore conscience▪ in so much as I am at the pittes brincke, of dispayre, wauering in minde to and fro, seeking rest, but loe (Lorde) vnquietnes of minde, oppresseth

me so sore, that considering with my selfe, what I haue beene, and what I am, a greate matter vexeth me▪ But when I looke into the time to come, the time wherein all mine offences, and faults shall bee manifested and laid to my charge. Oh then whether shall I flye thinke I? whether shall I conueygh my selfe? who shall hide mee from thy presence? who shall saue me from thy iust iudgement? Oh sweete Lord I am euen at my witts ende, wishing for death and ende of my dayes; And yet then the feare of the torments of hell fire, so striueth in me to the contrarie, that I quake at the rememberaunce thereof. And when I couet to liue longer, and see more daies, Lord then I am striken with doubt, and imagine, that as my life hath beene (euen from my byrth) giuen and inclyned, so greedelie to sinne, and that, the cause of my present dread▪ I then loath and abhorre my longer continuance heere, fearing least the aptnes of my corrupt flesh, by the dayly rebellion thereof, against the spirite, heape greater plagues vpon my poore soule: What shall I doo Lorde? feare and dispayre thus oppressing me on all sides, all hope of comfort hath left me, onely greefe and sorrowe remaineth, knowing not to whom to flie for succour, or to whom to make my mone. If to man, I knowe his strength, pollicie and wisedome, and comfort to be vaine▪ his nature inclined to weakenes, and wickednes, as mine, and in him to be no helpe And seeking any wo

But the seeking therof to renue and increase my greefe, that I shoulde leaue and giue ouer, the true and onely platforme of my deliuery, and seeke to a counterfeyt showe of ayde. Oh God forbid that euer I shoulde, but onely seeke for pardon of thy self, whom most greeuously I haue offended, and therefore to thee I fall prostrate euen in heart (sweete Iesus) the onely Phisition of all sicke soules, in whose power consisteth the alone forgiuenes of sinnes▪ be they neuer so many or great. I come, I come, though altogether ashamed, vnto thee my sauiour Iesus Christ, who haste promised to be a Mediatour for the penitent, vnto God the father. It is thy property to call home such as wander and goe astray, and to traine them vp in new wayes, be theyr sinnes as redde as Scarlet, thou hast sayde thou wilt make them as white as snowe, and were they as purple, thou canst make thē as white wooll. Oh most sweete promise, Oh comfortable saying, Oh voyce of heauenly consolation, whereby I am comforted, whereby I am reuiued, yea nowe is my conscience lightened, now haue I founde the true & onely Phisition of my long disease poore soule, euen thy self (sweet Iesus) who callest mee, I come, I come Lord stretch forth thine hand and receiue mee, giue mee perfecte hand fast of thys moste comfortable saying of thine: let mee enioy the true working of this most singuler medicine, thy death and bytter

passion (sweete Iesus) who sufferedst for our sinnes, & camest to take away the punishment due for our transgression, and to call vs to repentaunce, without which there is no hope, of remission of our sinnes. Thy mercy is infinite, thy loue vnsearchable, and wisedome incomprehensible, whereby thou callest vs, whereby thou louest vs, and whereby thou guydest vs: And euen of meere loue, which thou haste to the saluation of my poore soule, whom thou wouldest rather should conuert then perish, thou hast stirred vp in mine heart, a lothing of my sinne, wherein I haue walked, and imbraced the same, euē with greedines: Oh that I were as ready to come, as thou to call; So willing to leaue, and giue ouer the fulfilling of vnlawfull desires, as thou art to forgiue the same; So apt to serue thee, as thou art to saue me. Then should sinne no more dwell in me, nor I in it, but should enioy thy continuall fauour, and rest vnder the winges of thy mercy. Oh Lorde, I humbly beseeche thee, that as it hath pleased thee, to stirre me vppe at this time, to repentaunce, as thou hast called me home frō the wildernes, of wickednes, from deepe dispayre, so to place me in the pleasaunt fieldes of sinceritie, trueth, and godlines, as thou hast pluckt me out of the clawes of sathan, so vouchsafe to holde me, vnder the shaddow of thy winges, and to imbrace me with the armes of thy mercy, that I runne no longer, after the vanities of this world, nor yeelde vnto the vngodly motions of the fleshe, that

my minde beeing free, from all sinfull cogitations, I may keepe my bodie an vndefiled member of thy Church vnto my liues ende. And although, til thine appointed time, this miserable vale, must be my continuing cittie. And although I must be driuen to vse this worlde according to the necessitie of worldlye causes, as thy prouidence hath assigned, euery man to exercise his vocation, yet graunt that my minde may be continually conuersant, in heauenly things, and though my bodie wander in earth, my soule & spirite, may haue theyr perfect beeing, and abyding, by perfect faith in heauen, where thou sittest & raigneth for euer.

                  ALthough thy store increase, & so greatly multiply, that thou be sayne to enlarge thy roomes to bestowe thy fruites: thinke thee not discharged of this most necessary exercise of praier, but so much the more bound thervnto, 
                        •
                     for it is not the increase of

fruites the labour of thy handes or store of wealth that mainteyneth thy lyfe, and feedeth thee, vnlesse it be seasoned wyth the word of God, which preserueth all that faythfully trust in him. Matth. 24.
                  
                  For thou canst not liue by Breade alone (which is) with thinges necessarye for thy bodie, but by the worde of almightye GOD: And yet we are not onely licensed and permitted, but most louinglye called to come vnto our heauenly father, for whatsoeuer we want: as did Iacob Gene. 28. who prayed for foode and apparell, and obteyned it with aboundance God seeth before wee aske, what we want, and yet to show our dutiful obedience & to acknowledg our helpe to come from hym, wee must prostrate our harts be fore him in fayth, asking

and he will giue, knocking and he will open, seeking & we shall surelie finde what we want. Dut. 20. For God of his meere mercy feedeth the fatherles, voucbsasing vnto them al good thinges wherefore, whatsoeuer thou be, pray faythfully, vse the giftes of God thankfully, and reuerenly, and thinke not that thy freendes can helpe thee, thy fruites satisfie thee, or laboure preuayle thee, without the blessing of God. Tim. 6. wherby enioying foode and apparrell, be therewith content, and in any case dispayre not▪ for the prouidence of God is great, to giue foode and things necessary, to such as trust in him. And it is not daintye feare that feedeth so much as the trust in God can releeue with a small & simple dyet, as doth appeare in the 1. of Daniell, by thē that were so well replenished

with pulse and water?
               
               
                  
                  OH almighty God and louing father, who of nothing hast created all thinges liuing, whose care is, so great ouer them all, that thou sufferest not the moste vile or symplest of them, to perishe for want of foode,

and thinges requisite for thē, but seeking the same at thy handes, thou gyuest it them, in due season: And by thyne vnsearchable wysedome haste appoynted to euerye liuing creature, an abyding, according to his kinde. But such was thine vnspeakable care of man, whome thou hast created to thine own image, that he is as a king and gouernour ouer all, the rest of thy creatures, whome thou haste sette & appointed vnder him, beeing so farre inferiour vnto him, as where thou haste planted in him reason, wysedome, and gouernment, in them brutishnes, beeing altogether vnreasonable, and where they liue & haue there beeing vppon the tops of cold mountaines in desartes, vpon hilles

on hie, and in vallies below, and in sundry other vncouth and vnknowne places, where tempest & heate, hardnes and colde, and other continual dangers oppresse them, thou hast giuen and prouided for man, houses, castelles, and townes to preserue them from the force of windes, tempestes, and stormes, and from the assaultes of wilde beastes of the fielde, in the night and darknes quietly to rest: And although born naked, thou giuest him ray ment to couer and to clothe him, hearbes for his vse, and oyle to make him a cheereful and glad heart, and ioyfull countenaunce. Besides all this of thy meere goodnes, haste giuen him the beastes of the fielde, the fowles of the ayre, and fishes of the sea, to be his

foode and sustinaunce, yea (Lorde) such is thy fauour towardes man, that all the rest of thy creatures, thou hast ordeyned for his vse and seruice, wherfore I thy sillie creature and worke of thine handes, humblie prostrate my selfe in heart, beseeching thee fauourably to looke downe, vpon my necessitie, and graunt me whatso euer thou seest necessarie for me, euen a competent and necessarie portion heere, not ouermuch, least I wexe prowde, or disdaine mine inferiors, and if it be thy will, vouchsafe vnto me, not ouer little, least vrgent necessitie driue me to ouer much care, & ouer much care carry me to vnlawful means, & so runne headlong into thy dis
                        •
                     auor. But fill my Baskett, & blesse my store Oh Lord that I may enioy at thy mercifull handes, sufficiēcie for my selfe, & for the releefe of such as thou hast cō mitted vnto my gouernment: and for as much (good Lord) as all mine industry, carke, and care, & great trauaile, can not any thing furder me, releeue or satisfie me, in my necessitie, vnlesse thou vouchsafe therevnto good successe, for thy mercies sake, blesse me in all mine affayres, blesse my fruites in the field, my cattell, and all other thinges, belonging eyther to my selfe, or any other thy seruauntes, as by the fruites thereof, I and they may be releeued. Blesse the workes of mine handes, that they may prosper, blesse my sences that they wexe not dull, but be alwaies capable of such thinges, as belong vnto my

vocation, effectually to execute the same, both according to thy lawes, and the trueth of that which I take in hand, for without thy blessing and fatherly furtheraunce, I can not sufficiently execute, neither can that prosper, where vpon the whole state, of my liuing and maintenaunce dependeth. VVherefore (good Lorde) guide mine handes, and blesse mine vnderstanding, to the prosperous execution of all thinges, concerning my vocation, that I may gett those thinges, which may be sufficient, for the releese and maintenaunce of me and mine, to the profit of my neighbours, and glory of thy blessed name. And what so euer dooth happen vnto me, pouertye or ritches, make me (good Lord) of a patient, contented, and thankfull minde, that in aduersitie, I runne not headlong into such meanes as are vngodlye, neither in prosperitie, wexe the prowder, but waight thy good pleasure in them both, with thankfulnes, & euer more liue in thee, & by thee, & in the end raigne with thee in heauen, where thou sittest as Author and giuer of all thinges, graunt this for thy sonne Iesus Christes sake, to whom with thee, and the holie ghost, be all honour for euer.
                  Amen.
                  Oh Lord increase my fayth.
               
            
            
               
               
                  A prayer necessarie after the hearing of the word of God.
               
                  
                     Attende vnto the Ghospell bright,
                     Heare it, and reade, and liue vpright.
                  
               
               
                  Consider when thou hearest the worde of God preached, it dooth but as it were beat thyne eares: and rendereth no further benefitt vntyll by the workyng of GODS holye spyrite, it bee inwardlye reuealed, vnto thee. For GOD by two meanes speaketh vnto vs, namely by the Preacher whome hee sendeth, to teache vs. And by hys holy Spyrite, wherby hys doctrine is so setled in our heartes, that we inwardly enioy the true benefit therof. For wythout the helpe of the holye

ghost, the voyce of the preacher vanisheth, and the hearers profite nothing at all, S. Iohn saith, That he that knoweth God, heareth his word, 1. Iohn. 4. but he that is not of God heareth it not. wherby the spirite of trueth is discerned from the spirite of error. For the word of God is liuelie, Heb. 4. and effectuall, and pearceth more then a two edged sword, entring euen into the diuision of the soule & the spirite. &c. wherefore pray that as the Lorde sendeth his messengers to showe his will. So you may both heare it, vnderstand it, & purelie liue thereafter, pray for fayth, For without fayth Heb. 4. the hearing of the word, profiteth nothing.
                  
               
               
                  
                  OH heauenlye Father, who hast not onely vouchsafed to make vs, to thine owne image, and likenes, but also to sende thy sonne, Iesus Christe into this worlde, for our saluation, and hast by him, not only, giuen vs knowledge, of thy diuine will, heere on earth, and lefte it for our learning. But also freely taken away our synnes, and sette vs downe the perfecte rule to directe all our▪ actions and dooinges by the same, which yet neuertheles

continues harde and darke, to such as neither by thy grace haue beene inlightened, nor by the preaching of such as thou hast sent, beene taught, which also is of none effecte, without thine especiall grace, wor king to the true setling thereof, within the bowells of the inner man, for (Lorde) although wee heare with our eares, wee can not conceiue it in our heartes, nor showe it in conuersation, without the especial woorking of thine holie spirite, within vs. Oh Lord I thanke thee that thou haste vouchsafed vs to liue, in the time wherein darknes and ignoraunce is so much defaced, and superstition suppressed. That thy trueth, the word of life, the seede of our saluation, is bountifully distributed, throughout this our Countrey, to our vnspeakable comfort, and greate

terrour of such as hate the same: Lorde I thanke thee, that it hath pleased thee, to feede vs at this time, with the wholesome bread of life, the heauenly Manna, the word of eternall trueth, wherewith graunt vs, so to be replenished, and fedde at full, that we may loathe and abhorre all thinges, which are not of the true table of our saluation, the gospell of thy sonne Iesus Christ.
                  But forasmuch (Oh mercifull Lord God) as wee may heare, and not perceiue, and reade, and not vnderstand, without the light of thine holy spirite guiding and instructing vs, I humblie beseeche thee to inspire our heartes, with a true vnderstanding of that which this day we haue hearde, with our outward eares, pronounced by the Messenger and Preacher of thy worde, and graunt that it may so worke to the amendment of our liues, and the increase of our faith, feare, and loue, of thee, continually abyding with vs, and to our great comfort, effectually worke in vs vnto our liues ende, accepting the same, at the mouth of thy messenger, as deliuered euen, by thine owne heauenly voice (as indeede it is) as long as it differeth not from thine holye worde and gospell, giuing all the prayse and glory vnto thine owne selfe, for he is but a Minister to declare thy will vnto vs, who are the grounde, and thy word the seede, which beeing sowne in our hearts, by this thy minister may, not onely take some roote, but grow vppe effectually, to our comfortable edification and

learning, beeing so liuely and effectuall, as it entreth euen into the diuision of the soule and spirite: giue vs grace (Oh heauenly God, in this so pernicious a time of sectes, scismes, and daungerous controuersies, that we may beare constant hearts, carefull and deuoute mindes, to the trueth, auoyding (with dilligence) the perswasions of such as seeke to sette vppe superstition, and to maintaine errours, and vntrue doctrine; And as the Niniuites at the preaching of Ionas, repented their sinnes, so giue vs grace, not only to repent, for a time, but earnestly to bewaile our manifolde offences, and wholie cleaue to fulfill the trueth of thy lawes, to the saluation of our poore soules. Let not sathan (sweete Lorde) at any time wrest thy trueth sowne in our heartes, neither let him, nor his ministers preuaile, in sowing tares, cockle, or Darnell, among the good Wheat of thy gospell, as they continually seeke and desire, to marre the Haruest of our good fruites, which (though they be fewe, by reason of our owne corruption) which we haue gathered by the hearing of thy ghospell, yet (sweete Lord) vouchsafe to increase them, by vertue of thine holie spirite, working within vs. And let not our desire of seruing thee, be either choaked or snared, with the vnlawfull desires of this moste wretched worlde, but rightly and truely discerning the trueth, from false doctrine, may vnderstand who are thy true ministers, with earnest attentiuenes vnto the vtterance of thy wil by thē, carefully & warily

auoyding the counterfeit barking of such as speake for their own benefit, hauing further respect to their owne pleasure, profit, and commoditie, then to the edifying of our poore soules, whom thou resemblest to Wolues, taking vppon them (vnder the shaddow of simplicitie, and feyned show of innocencie) to guide thy flocke, who (indeede) are moste detestable Hipocrites, and deuourers of thy sheepe, whom I beseeche thee to cutte off, from that godlie and diuine function, and office of preaching, that thy trueth, beeing at all times, purely vttered by godly and deuout Pastours, wee thy poore flock may for euermore be truely edified, and continue within the Hardels of sincere conuersation, and godlie liuing, to the prayse of thy holy name, and to the attainment of our heauenly inheritaunce for thy sonne Iesus Christes sake.
                  Amen.
                  O Lord increase our fayth and make vs euermore attentiue hearers, true conceiuers, and dilligent fulfillers of thy will.
                  Amen.
               
               
                  
                  A short prayer to the like purpose.
                  
                  
                     OH Lorde vouchsafe, that as of thy goodnes thou hast, through thy sonne our Sauiour, left for our learning, and to our vnspeakable comfort, the word of trueth, the gospell of our saluation, which none can learne vnlesse he be sent, I humbly beseeche thee to giue me thy grace, that as I haue heard the same, at this time by thy minister and messenger. So I may be able, perfectly to retaine the same, in the inner part of mine hearte, according to the trueth, and that I may expresse the same, in my conuersation and life, dooing all thinges according to thine heauenly will, vnto my liues ende. Amen.
                  
                  Oh Lorde increase my faith.
               
            
            
               A thankes giuing to God, for his benefites.
               
                  
                     Blesse thou the Lord, that giueth blisse,
                     Heblesseth him that thankfull is.
                  
               
               
                  BE thankfull vnto almightie God Ephe, 5. for all thinges, in the name of our Lorde Iesus Christe, who hath left vs a

perfecte patterne of thankfulnes, Mat, 26. alwayes lifting vp his eyes vnto heauen, giuing thankes vnto his heauēly father. So must we beare alwayes a thankfull heart, as a testimonye of our good wills, for the benefites of God toward vs let vs pray alwayes, 1. Thes 5. let vs alwayes reioyce, & without ceasing giue thāks, for it is the will of God the father, in hys sonne Iesus Christ, towardes vs, Saint Augustine breefely in this wise exhorteth vs to bee thankfull, namely, hartelye to say, God be thanked. A sweete sauour (no doubt) it is in the nostrelles of hys heauenly Maiestie, and an acceptable sacrifice. Chrisostome also willeth vs to giue thanks vnto the Lord, and to blesse him, yea although euill chaunces happen vnto vs, and then shal those euills be taken away,

and on the contrary, (as it must needes follow) he saies that if prosperous thinges happen vnto vs, and we continue vnthankfull, our prosperitie shalbe turned in to aduersitye. So pure a balme and sweete odoure, is giuing of thankes, that the Lord taketh it, as a moste acceptable recompence, for all his benefites, which as wee can not otherwise deserue, let vs continually say the name of God be praysed. Although it bea terme sometimes vsed of the wicked, who haue their reward with Hipocrites, but blesse the Lord in fayth, and thou shalt be blessed.
               
               
                  
                  OH God of vnspeakable mercie, & father of meruailous louing kindnes, the onelie giuer of all good and

perfect giftes, who art more readie to giue then we to aske, hearing befor we cal, and giuing before we desire, thinges necessary for vs▪ I yeelde thee humble thankes, for thy continuall fauour, and louing kindnes, towards vs thy creatures, for whose saluation when we were lost, thou wast contented euen of thy meere loue, to sende thine onely, delight into this world, thy sonne Iesus Christe, taking humaine nature vpon him, and abyding the most bitter pangs of death vpon the Crosse, to redeeme vs againe, into thy fauour, which by our disobedience was lost, from darcknes (wherevnto our blindnes had broughte vs) into the lighte of trueth, from ignoraunce and errour, to wisedome & knowledge. Oh what

greater comfort, what greater ioy, what a greater benefite, coulde thy diuinitie haue bestowed vppon silly man, then being of a castaway, to bee made a saued soule, of a lost sonne, made the child of God: and of a poore banished wretch, to bee made an inheritor of the kingdome of heauen, (Lorde) if it were possible for vs to yeelde vnto thee, as manie thankes and prayses, as coulde fill euen thine eates, at the ful, & did yeelde our bodies and soules to bitter torments in hell, for thy sake, frō which thou hast redeemed vs, it were nothing in recompence of the least parte of thys thy loue, in giuing this sacrifice thy sonne, in whom, was thine onely and whole delight, to pacifie thine owne displeasure, and to purchase thy fauour and loue againe a thing most merueilous, that the offended, shoulde seeke tha'ttonement with the offendour, and after so vnspeakable a meane, and yet requiring

nothing at our hands, but thankfulnes & obedient harts. Lord I yeelde thee all possible thanks, I yeelde thee thankes, euen frō the bottome of mine heart, from the very depth of mine vnderstanding, who hast deserued more then we can by any means, in desire satisfie, or any way requite, not onely in gyuing thy sonne for vs, but in leauing vnto vs a continual rememberance of the same thy gospel, wherin consisteth the rule for our direction vnto thee, euen thy word, which (although heauen and earth passe and perishe) yet shall not one iotte thereof (as thou hast promised) deminishe or decay, without the which we shoulde haue continued in our accustomed blindnes. These thy benefites are vnspeakable yet sweete Lord, the creating of vs after thy likenes, & making vs after thine owne image, deserueth no lesse praise and thanks, where it lay in thy power to haue fashioned vs, after sundry other formes, as of wormes in the earth, fishes in the sea, & beasts of the land, most owgly, and most straunge, hauing neither the knowledge of thy will, sence, or seeling of thy goodnes (which is the sweetest comfort in the world yea without the which, is no true comfort at all) nor enioy any quality either of body or minde, which is any thing at all comparable to the gifts which thou hast endued mankinde withall, I thanke thee also sweete Lord, for all other thine vnspeakable mercies & benefits, as for feding vs, clothing vs, & protecting vs hetherto, giuing vs al thīgs necessary both for our

soules & bodies, & lord as of thy free fauor & meere mercy, thou hast vouchsafed vnto vs thy creatures, all these, and many other vnspeakable benefittes. So vouchsafe the like loue and tender care towardes vs alwaies, that we may prosper in our vocations & goe forward in the daily seruice of thee, and through the merites of thy sonne Iesus Christ, obteyne pardon for our sinnes past, and liue in thy faith, feare, and loue heereafter, enioying all thinges requisite for mine owne, and for the releefe of those whom thou hast committed vnto me, and also for all other thy seruauntes, so that we may haue sufficient, and not be chargeable, but rather helpfull to others, for thy sonne Iesus Christes sake, graunt it.
                  Amen.
                  Oh Lorde increase my fayth.
               
            
            
               
                  A deuoute prayer, or Meditation, that we may alwaies haue consideration, that we must dye, which, as it is good at all times, so especially in the time of any common plague or sicknes, a godly meditation.
               
               
                  
                     Remember as thou art a man,
                     So must thou dye, none helpe it can:
                     No thing more sure, the time vnsure,
                     Wherefore take heede, liue not secure.
                  
               
               
                  
                     SYlenas the Philosopher (hauing it but by the instinct of nature, before

the publishing of the gospell) could see furder into the estate of man, in those dayes, then wee endeuour to vnderstande (liuing too securelye) nowe in the cleere light of the same. For his opinion was, that if wee consider, with our selues, what we are, whereof we are, and what we shall be, wee coulde not but lament, our miserable estate. This saying of his was meruailous then, when men liued in darknes, but muche more meruailous that it is no better considered, nowe in the time of the light of truth. For wher we shoulde haue great care to liue well, wee liue in wicked securitie, and where we shoulde haue greater care to dye well, wee foolishlye thinke to liue for euer. But let vs perswade our selues, and not only perswade, but fully resolue our selues, that we shall dye, and let vs endeuour

to make a good ende, for a good ende excuseth a badde life paste.
                  And euen so likewise is an euill ende a greate argument of an euyll life. For sake sinne and imbrace deathe wyllynglye, so shalt thou seeme happye in this life, and not vnhappye at the howre of death. In the morning, thinke not to liue tyll night: and at night, thinke not to liue tyll morninge. So shalt thou lyue so muche the more cyrcumspectlye, and bee alwayes readye to dye.
                  Account thy selfe in thys worlde but as a gueste, that lodgeth for a nyght, and departeth in the morning, and as a wandryng Pylgrime of no certayne abode, lyst vppe thy mynde to God, Ecclesi. 4, hauing heere no certayne Citty, for if thou liue tenne, or an hundred or a thousande

yeeres, there is no helpe but the graue muste bee thine end. Blessed are they Reu 14. that dye in the Lorde. VVherefore prepare thy selfe to dye, not in your owne wisedome, for that will deceiue you.
                  But in the wisedome of GOD, that your hope may be sure, his ioyes yours, and his goodnes your inhearitaunce.
               
               
                  
                  OH God the onely giuer of life, the mainteyner, and

preseruer thereof, and the life after death, graunt me continuall due consideration, that as this bodie of myne, is builded, vpon an earthly foundation, and framed of the substaunce of dust, and clay, which is not durable, the glory thereof vanishing, like the flowre of the fielde, which is soone cutte downe and withered. So the same beeing the mansion, or rather the Prison of my poore soule, so frayle, weake, and feeble, subiect to so many infirmities, diseases, greefes, and maladies, yea to so many causes, that procure the dissolution of bodye and soule, that it often happeneth, whē we think least thereon, it commeth sodamly, as the lightninge, and taketh vs vnwares.
                  VVherefore grant Oh

GOD of my life) that I may haue such continuall care, foresighte, and dylligent respect vnto the direction of my dealinges, cogitations, and wordes, that I loade not, my poore soule so muche with the burden of scenlesse securitye, sinne and iniquitye, that the bodye beeing sodainly intangled with the snare of deathe, it bee carryed where there is no reste, no ioye, no comforte, or consolation, but continual mourning weeping, and anguishe of minde, as the Glutton spoken of in thine holy Gospell, who going on blindly, loosly, and carelesly, without regarde, eyther of thee, or remem braunce of his ende, in moste detestable couetousnes, and all kinde of wickednes, was sodainly

taken from hys mucke & wealth which he had wrongfully gotten, and myserably whorded vppe, and yet denying poore Lazarus the croomes that fell, and were taken from his table, but was carried by the deuyll and his Angells into euerlasting and moste bitter tormentes, where was weeping and gnashing of teeth.
                  Oh my sweete Lord let not mine heart be so blinded, with the vale of vanitie, nor nouseled in the delightes of this world, so intangeled in the nette of concupiscence, nor clad in the weedes of wilfull forgetfulnes of mine estate, that I bee taken as the ritch man, who deuising within him selfe, to enlarge hys Barnes, wherin he might conuey his graine, so much encreasing, who standing in his euill conceite, of couetousnes, (thinking himselfe most secure) was taken vnawares from his aboundaunce, and left hys riches he knew not to whom (Oh most gratious and most louing God) a most vnhappy end, wherin steed of heauenly contemplations, and godly cogitations (which thou requirest at al times of such as are thine but especially at the houre of death) there appeared

a most horrible intent of couetousnes, which thou vtterly abhorrest, a manifest token (good Lorde) of forgetfulnes of his ende, and an argument, that hee was the childe of Sathan. But thou shewest mercye to as many as conuert and turne to thee.
                  Oh my most louing father, lighten mine eyes, that I sleepe not in sinne, nor wander in darknes, according to the will of the fleshe, that I fall not vnawares into the dungion of distruction, death, and hell, but make me alwaies ready and willing, to come vnto thee, euen with desire when it pleaseth thee to call me, by laying thy hande, by any plague or sicknes vpon me, let me not drawe me (as it were) backwarde, when thou inuitest me, to the sweete banquet of thine heauenly kingdome, as by the worde and gospell preached, and reueiled vnto vs, which is an especiall calling vs, or when I feele my selfe distempered, greeued, or vexed, with any kinde of sicknes, plague or disease, which is another of thy callinges, and an especiall warning that we must dye, or when by course of time, in extreame age, wee may imagine our ende to be neere, but (Lord) when I am at my dayly busines, and laboure, when I eate or drinke when I am in my best temperature & health in childehoode and young yeeres, at all times, and in all places, giue me grace to thinke, that death standeth at mine elbowe, alwayes ready to strike mee, that I sleepe not in sinne and securitie, till the time sodainly come of my departure, and so be taken vnprouided,

and perish withour repentaunce, who can perswade him selfe, to liue long and see many daies, especially, in daungerous and contagious times of sicknes, and seeing so many examples dayly to the contrary, euen in the most temperate time of health, some we see at their Mothers pappes, by humaine indgement likely to liue, sodainely to giue vppe the ghoste, some in theyr youth, some in middle yeeres, yea & when grauest experience aboundeth, to be sodainly called away, & to be no more seene. Al which, notwithstanding (Oh Lord) such is the blindnes of our nature, that we think this world a cōtinual being for vs, and couer (euen with greedines) to see many dayes, where we heape sinne vpon sinne, to the ouerburdening of our poore soules, seldome, or not at all thinking to dye.
                  Graunt (sweete Lorde) that as I desire to liue, so I may haue a greater desire to liue well, that I may make an happy ende, abandoning all feare of death, that the cogitation thereof, may dwell in peace, with in the mansion of mine heart, and when it shall approche neere vnto me, I flie not from it, but may goe foorth with ioy to meete the same, considering that it is a meane, to ende my cares, and to begin my ioy, it is the finishing of sorrow, and enteraunce into blisse, which made thy seruaunt Paule to say, That he desired to be deliuered of the burden of this life, and to be with thee, where is nothing but ioyes vnspeakable▪ and contrarie, heere on earth, nothing but care, and

woe, which mooued thy seruaunt Iob, to call this life a warfare, and this world a wildernes, and vale of misery, where is nothing but conflictes, betweene the flesh and the spirite, dayly increase of sinne, and continuall care, of vanities. Oh good God giue vs carefull hearts to loue thee while we liue heere, giue vs continual feare, vnfeyned zeale, perfit faith, godly care▪ to doo good to all men, and earnest desire to come vnto thee, who art the ende of all trouble and laboure, and the beginning of ease, the ende of strife and the beginning of peace, the ende of all misery, and the beginning of all blisse, wherevnto sweete (Lord) graunt, that with vnseyned desi
                        •
                     e, we may faithfully endeuour our selues, to come, and to take possession, of that thy most glorious kingdome, where thy sonne is gonne before, to direct vs the way and where thou sittest to iudge, according to euerye mans desertes, making all those that thou findest with the Lampe of true faith, burning in their harts, partakers of the euerlasting ioyes thereof. In number of whome, (Oh sweete Lord) accept me heere, that I may appeare among them, in the world to come, through Iesus Christ our Lorde, in whose name, I commend my selfe into thy handes▪ to liue for euer in thee, sweete God.
                  Amen.
                  Oh Lord increase my fayth.
               
               
                  
                  A short prayer to the like purpose.
                  
                  
                     OH God, in whose handes, consisteth the life of all mankind, for thy Sonne Jesus Christes sake, vouchsafe to giue me grace, to sett before mine eyes, (as a most certaine mark where vnto this frayle body of mine must tende it selfe) the Image of that which is to the faythfull the ende of payne, and beginning of pleasure, the ende of misery and beginning of blisse, but to the secure and careles, the ende of their pleasures, and beginning of eternall paynes. Ueuchsafe me therefore earnest desire of seruing thée, and leading my life according vnto thy will, that whē so euer it pleaseth thee to call me, I be not through feare striken with doubt of condemnation, but euen at my laste gaspe, through vnfayned faith in Jesus Christ, may take and haue a taste of eternall saluation, that death bee not terrible vnto me, but rather when it cōmeth, I may▪ with ioy receiue the same, in the name of Jesus Christe, mine onely sauiour and redeemer. Amen.
                  
                  Oh Lord increase my faith.

                     As God by Iames commandeth thee▪
                     
                     So shalt thou prosper in thy wayes,
                     And liue both many and happy daies.

of all men in generall and sette out for the vse of the whole congregation, as it were with one mouth, & one voyce to be pronounced begging at the handes of God, not onely pardon for such seuerall offences as are therein expressed, but also crauing thinges necessary, as well for them that are absent as present, yea for all men a thing most commendable & godly, praying one for another, as S. Iames willeth Iam. 5. vs to pray one for another, that wee may be hearde of God, for the prayer of the righteous auaileth much. And because the zealous may (without the so often repitition of these wordes. Good Lorde deliuer vs, and we beseech thee &c.) priuatlye vtter his godly desire of the prosperitie of his Christian bretheren, without answering himselfe in those respectes,

I thought it not much amisse, to contriue it into this prayer following, the which I pray the Reader willingly to accept.
               
               
                  
                  OH almighty God, and father of all that beleeue and

trust in thee, Oh Lorde God, sonne, redeemer, & aduocate of all thē who faithfully serue thee, Oh God holy ghoste, who proceeding from the father and the sonne, santifiest the elect and chosen ones. Oh blessed & most glorious Trinitie, three personnes, and yet but one God, haue mercy vpon vs, who most miserablie haue offended. Remember not our offences nor the offences of our fore-fathers nor punishe vs according to the multitude of our sins. Spare vs good Lorde, whome thou hast redeemed, and so directe all our cogitations, and actions, that wee giue none occasion of thine anger towardes vs, for euer, mercifully saue, and defende vs, frō sinne & mischeefe, from the craftes and assaults of

sathan, from thy displeasure and eternall damnation, good Lorde for thy mercies sake deliuer vs, from darknes of misbeleefe, from hautines of minde, from mallice, enuie, hatred, and double dealing, from euill motions of our corrupt fleshe, and from all worldly vaneties. Saue vs from plague pestilenee, from extreame hunger, and famine, from sodaine death, from heresie and false doctrine, and graunt vs alwayes will, and ablenes, to fulfill all thy most godly commaundementes, with a cleane and a pure heart.
                  Oh sweete Iesus deliuer vs from all euill, euen by thy death and passion, by thine anguish of mind, by thy bloody sweate, by thy glorious resurrection▪ from the deepe of death and hell, and by thine assention, into thy celestiall kingdome; Bee present with vs (good Lorde) in all our troubles, vexation of minde, & at the howre of our departure hence. And for thy meere mercies sake, be thou fauourable vnto vs, in the day, when we must giue account for our life past, that we be not rewarded according to our desertes, but by thy merites may enioy eternall saluation. Oh most mercifull and euerliuing God, wee most miserable and most wretched sinners, heere humbly prostrating our selues before thee, beseeche thee to listen to our petitions, and graunt vnto thine

vniuersall Church, godly & deuout preachers of thy word, and gospel, that it may dayly increase in vertuous and godly gouernment, dayly growing and proceeding, from faith to faith, truely knowing thee, and vnfeynedly seruing thee. Graunt vnto thy seruaunt Elizabeth, our Queene, true vnderstanding of thy will, and vnto her counsaile, knowledge and wisedome. That vnder her, for her, and in thy name, they may establish godly Lawes, statutes, and ordinaunces, for our good and godly gouernment, and vnto vs thy people▪ grace continually, to follow, and fulfill the same. Be thou (good Lord) her defendour in all aslaultes of her enemies; and so rule her hearte in thy faith seare and loue, that she may alwaies seeke to aduaunce thine honour and glory, deface superstiton, errour, and false religion, and euer be able to vanquish and ouercome suchas rise vp against her, to seeke the contrary. Lighten the hearts of all Byshops, ministers, and Pastours of thy church, with▪ right vnderstanding▪ and knowledge of thy worde, that they may not onely in speeche, & doctrine, but also by their conuersation and life, soundly and sincerely vtter the same, to the true edification of thy people. Oh Lord let not such as are put in authority to see the due execution of thy lawes, be slowe, negligent or ignorant therin, but endued with grace wisdom & vnderstanding, & boldnes, may execute iustice, & maintain thy trueth, without affectiō, fauor, or respect of persons, vouchsafe to endue vs all with

continuall vnfeined good will, one towards another that wee may liue all the daies of our life in vnitye, peace, & godly agreement, pleasing thee, by liuing according to the rule of thy blessed commandements. Graunt vs Oh Lord, feruent desire, to be where thy word & gospell is preached & taught, and endue vs with thy grace to heare & to beare away, & not only to heare and beare away, but to expresse the same in our life & conuersation, that the truth of thy gospel, which is the fruit of thine holy spirit, may dailye increase in vs: & call home all wandring soules, which are carried into blindnes, by the subtiltie, & procurements of sathan, & his wicked ministers, following strange Gods & worshipping that, that cannot auaile them in their distresse, and giue them (Oh Lord) repenting heartes, conuerting the soule. Shewe them thy true light, that they seeing it (though a farre off) may by little and little, attaine vnto the perfit enioying of the same. Strengthen al them that haue taken holde of thee by true faith, and pure religiō, that they fall not from thence, by any deceiuable show of any counterfeit secte, comfort those that are weake, & lift vp those that are downe, that they by thee, & thou in them maist beate down, & keepe sathan vnder their feete. Vouthsafe good Lord to giue succor, help & cōfort to all such as are in any kind of affliction, daunger, necessity, or tribulation, preserue and keepe safe, all such as labour & trauaile, by sea or land, for the benefit of our common weale.
                  
                     Strengthen all women with child, and sende them good deliueraunce; comfort all them that are sicke, and giue them either patience to beare it, or mittigate their greefe, giue health and nourishment to al young children, and graunt them grace, to goe forward in nurture and knowledge of thy will. Lorde we beseeche thee, to showe compassion, vppon all such as suffer impty sonment, and giue them deliueraunce, at thy good pleasure. Prouide (good Lord) for such poore children, as are fatherles, or helples, consider the cause of all VV iddowes, and be helpfull vnto them in their distresses. Lord haue mercy vpon all men, forgiue our enemies, and such as persecute vs, and if it please thee, turne the heartes. Fructifie those thinges on earth which thou hast appoynted for our vse, and so increase the same, that we may enioy the fruites thereof, with sufficiencie, for our necessities in time conuenient. And vouchsafe to giue vs grace, to fall downe vppon the knees of our hearts, with vnfeyned repentannce of all our sinnes, that we may obteyne at thy mercifull handes, pardon for our offences, negligences, and ignoraunces, and vouchsafe, to endue vs with thine holy spirite, that we may goe forward in daily amendmēt of our liues, & gouern the same according to thy wil. Amen. Oh sonne of almighty God, we beseeche thee to heare vs. Oh Lambe of God, that takest away the sins of the world, graunt vs thy peace, and haue mercy vpon vs.
                  
                  Oh Lord increase our fayth.
                  Amen.
               
            
            
               
               
                  A prayer for the fulfilling of the tenne Commaundements.
               
                  
                     Pray that thou maiest fulfill the will,
                     Of him whose hand defends thee still
                     And these precepts forget thou not,
                     Which Moyses for thy safety wrot.
                  
               
               
                  BLessed is the man (as sayth Dauid) Psalm. 1. 2. that delighteth in the Lawe of the Lorde, and meditateth therein day and night, he shall be blessed in his goodes, in all that hee taketh in hand, at his going out, and his comming in, and in all thinges. But contrariwise, he that declyneth from his commaundemēts and neglecteth them, shall be accursed in all his waies, and nothing shall prosper with him, although for a tyme it flourishe in showe heere, the ende of the same will be euill. And therfore

                     Dauid in all his prayers, (considering his owne infirmitie) besought the Lord to instruct him, in his commaundements, saying make mee Oh God to vnderstand thy lawes, and I will meditate vppon all thine wonderous works. Yea his delight was in the commaundements of God. And Saloman sayth, Pro. 28. that hee that turneth away his eares from hearing the lawe, his prayer shall be abhominable. For it is the loue of God that we should keepe his commaundements. 1. Ioh, 5, Praye therefore that God will stirre vp in you, an vnfeyned zeale in all your dooings and enterprises, to obserue the law of the Lorde.
                  
               
               
                  
                  OH almighty Iehouah, God of heauen & earth, who haste promised thy selfe, euen from the beginning to be our Lorde and our God, our shielde and our Fortresse, our buckler and defence, our Castell and refuge. And who hast brought vs with a mighty and strong hand, with an outstretched Arme, out of the Lande, wherein wee were straungers, wherein we liued in bondage, vnder the yoke and tytannye of Antechriste and sathan, into the lande

land that floweth with the Milke and Honny of true religion, wherewith thou feedest the soules of thy faithfull ones.
                  Grant that as through thy meere mercye and loue, thou vouchsafest to bring vs into this worlde, and to frame vs to thine owne image and likenes, So we may account thee as our onely God, worshipping none other besides thee, making vnto our selues, none image of any likenes, either of thinges aboue, or thinges beneathe, nor bowe or seeke helpe at the handes of any (as a God) beside thee, who as by thy mightye power, thou broughtest the children of Israell out of Egipt, by the handes of Moses and Aaron, where they were in bondage, where they were continually oppressed with sundry kindes of vexations both of body and minde. So hast thou vhuchsased

to bring vs and to deliuer vs from a greater bondage, seruitude, and stauery, euen from the power of Sathan, vnder whose tyranny we rested, and now escaped, not by the pollicie, strength, or power of any Moyses, but by the blod shedding of thine only son Iesus Christ, who tooke vpon him the death of the crosse for our sakes, to bring vs frō darknes, wherein we walked according to the will of the flesh, vnto the true knowledge of thee againe▪ & to redeeme vs out of the bondage of sin, into the land of righteousnes, from blinde ignoraunce, to the bright shining daystarre, of thine heauenly will, who art not onely a most loouing and gentle Father, but also a moste sharp punisher and reuenger, who art not onely desirous, that we should come vnto thee, but art also most ielious ouer vs, least we should seeke or follow any other God besides thee, yea in all our afflictions and troubles, to seeke onely vnto thee, and beeing releeued, to attribute the onely meane thereof vnto thy selfe, whereby thou hast promised to bee mercifull vnto thousandes that loue thee, feare thee, seeke thee, and truely take hold
                        •
                      of thee, as theyr onely God. And againe, threatnest thy vengeaunce, and heauy displeasnre, to continue vppon the thirde and fourth generation, of them that hate thee, and folow straunge Gods▪ (Oh sweete God) vouchsafe that it may be farre from our mindes to haue any desire, once to put our foote towardes any straunge Gods, appeare their helpe▪ neuer so likely or plentifull,

but that it bee bothe now and euer in our hearts, to confesse both in word and conuersation, that there is none other God besides thee, who art most glorious and a most louing Father, haue mercy vpon vs. And so vouchsafe to direct vs in all our dooinges, cogitations and wordes, as we may alwayes and in all thinges, fulfil thy will, neuer taking thine holy and most glorious name in vaine, by blasphemous speeches, dishonouring the same. Keepe vs moste louing Father, not onely from the most detestable sinne of periury, whereby thine holy name is often defaced, and (as it were troden vnder foote, as in making it the author of abhominable falshoodes and lyes, but from all friuolous and vaine othes, which (to the great greefe of thy children) are moste vncomly in the mouthes of such as vnreuerently and rashly vse it, euen in common speeches, without any vrgent cause or matter forcing, wherby they fal into the most hemous sinne, of taking thy most glorious name in vaine, but that we may vse such a reuerent manner, & godly order of vsing thy name for trial of any matter in lawfull causes, as thou maist alwaies find vs true hallowers of it therby. And forasmuchas thou within sixe daies didst finish al things in the be ginning, & in the seauenth day didst rest from the same labor, commanding vs likewise to obserue the sanctification of the same for euer, and to rest from all labours, trauailes and worldly busines and not onely our selues, but all other whom thou hast committed

to our charge, as seruaunts, Oxen and Asses, and such like? graunt that wee may not onely lay aside all worldly cares, and busines on the Sabaoth day, resting our wearied members, but may in all thinges sanctifie it and keepe it holy, with godly exercises, diuine prayers, and heauenly meditations with carefull and diligent regard, to the auoyding of all wanton pastimes, foolish and vncomly exercises, and vnlawfull practises, whereby (oftentimes) the affection beeing mooued to impatience, powreth forth chollour to the dishonoring of thy name. Let our conuersation be altogether modest, mortefiing our own desires, wholy appliing our selues, not onely on the Sabaoth day, but all the weeke, yea all our whole life, to the sreuice of thee, to the honouring and glorifying of thy name, to the benefit of our soules, profit of our neighboures, and due reuerence to our parents, whom thou hast commaunded vs to honour, loue, and obey, as the instruments of our beginning, thou beeing the workman. Graunt, Lord that we may truly and vnfeynedly, reuerence them as thou willest we should, that we may long continue vpon the earth, not in the number of careles and disobedient Children, in whom resteth no thankfulnes for so great benefits had and receiued at the hand of their parents, from whom thou hast saide, thou wilt with hold thy blessings, and altogether depriue them of theyr liberty and liuing.
                  But graunt that we may so order our selues, by

thy grace, both to them and to other our Superiours, as wee may bee blessed with many good giftes, and length of dayes heere according to thy will.
                  And that it may please thee, so to confirme theyr blessings in and vpon vs, as that it may goe well with vs all the dayes of our liues. Take from vs sweete Lorde) all desire of reuenge, all rancor, malice and hatred, least the deuill, (who redily standes to prick vs forwarde to a desperate minde) procure vs to slay the innocent, we beseeche the Lord, let not (at any time) such euill imaginations enter into any parte of our heartes, least we (giuing our selues ouer thervnto) lose the raynes of our naturall disposition, which is so inclined to wrathe, that vnlesse the strength thereof be subdued, or the venoumous sting thereof pluckt out, by vertue of thine holy spirite, it wil (no doubt) prouoke vs to wait oportunity to wreake our mallice with violence, vppon such as by slight occasions, haue offended vs, yea and by little and little, breake out into the flame of deadly hatred, and so seeke to destroy the innocent most wickedly.
                  Oh Lorde forbidde it, and keepe vs from the most pernicious sinne of adultery, which being so odious in thy sight, thou causedst to fall in one day, for the same three and twenty thousande. Oh Lorde indue vs with thine holie spirite, that we may keepe our bodies cleane and vndefiled members of thee, beeing

indued with perfect chastitie, may abandon all occasions, that may procure vs to offende thee, reteyning a godly behauiour, which thou so deerely louest, and expell euill concupiscence which thou so much abhorrest.
                  Oh mercifull God, vouchsafe to keepe vs from taking any thing, by secrete meanes, or otherwise from our neighbours, whom we ought to loue as our selues, The desire whereof (good Lord) proceedeth often by scarcitie and want, by pouertye and neede, which (indeede) thou art able and willing to releeue without any such vnlawfull meanes. And therefore I beseeche thee to graunt vs a sufficient & necessary portion, or els constancie and vnfeyned hope in thee, to be relieued in thy good time, and vtterly to derest the horrible sinne of stealing for thou hast promised neither to faile vs nor forsake vs, calling faithfully vpon thee. And as we ought to beware of taking any thing from others by stealth, so likewise vouchsafe vs grace, when any occasion serueth, or matter forceth, to beare witnes of the truth, in any controuersie betweene bretheren, graunt vs heedefull mindes, to depose and testifie that, which is trueth, according to our knowledge, without respecte either of the ability freendshippe, or fauoure of the one, or the enuie, malice, or pouerty of the other. And graunt that we rayse no false accusation or slander vpon any man, considering that the same faulte, whereof we wrongfully accuse another, shalbe imputed

as great vnto our selues, but that wee may keepe our mouthes, from speaking any thing hurtfull vnto others.
                  And like good men muse and meditate, before hand, what we ought to speake, not letting the brydell of our lippes loose, to babble out that which first commeth into our mindes, and that we may content our selues with our estates, whatsoeuer thou sendest, without any vngodly desire of any thing that belongeth vnto our neighbours. And graunt vs thine especiall grace, euer more truely to obserue, and faithfully to fulfill all thy most godly commaundements. In the name and for the sake of thy Sonne Iesus Christ, in whose name, as well for grace to keepe thy lawes as also for all necessaries for body and soule, I hartely pray thee, by that prayer which he hath sette downe vnto vs in these wordes. Our Father which are in heauen. &c.
                  
                  Oh Lord increase our faith.
               
               
                  
                  A short prayer to the like purpose.
                  
                  
                     FOr as much oh God of all wisdome, and mercy, as thou for our direction and godly lyuing, hast by the handes of thy Prophet set downe and prescribed vnto vs, godly institutions for vs to followe, considering our corruption, and naturall declination, from following thy Lawes, and howe we are inclined to the thinges forbidden by thee therein. I most humblye pray thee, to vouchsafe me not onely dilligent care, and daily endeuour, but especiall grace to fulfill them, according to thy blessed will, in all thinges, through Jesus Christ. Amen.

                  OH bountifull God, and most merciful father, naked came I into thys worlde,

bringing with mee not a clothe or ragge to couer this silly and weake body of mine, wanting sustinaunce and foode, without the which (sweete Lorde) life can not endure, which I haue receiued at thy merciful hands and that most largely the one to couer & keepe my naked members, and weake bodye from parching heate in the sōmer, and extreame colde in winter, and the other to feede and nourishe the same, in so much as it hath by neither of these extremeties, fainted or decayed to this day. I thanke thee (sweete lord) that I haue not continued in nakednes, wherein I was born, but in warme and necessarye clothing, not in hunger, but in fulnes, not in scarcety but in aboundaunce, and sufficiency

of all things, not in want but in wealth, not in labour but at ease, not amonge the lowest, but with the highest, which blessings of thine (Oh Lorde) I confesse were not gotten by mine owne industry & paines, not by mine owne pollicie or wisedome, nor bestowed on mee for mine owne sake or desertes▪ who am borne in sinne, but as sent from thee, as thine owne free blessings farre passing the capasity of man, by wisdome to comprehende, by labour to gette, or by pollicye to purchase, but onely by thy blessed prouidence, setting thine helpinge hande vnto the godly industrye of such as by their vocation and iuste trauaile shall endeuour to gather the same, which is thine onely and bountifull gift, as also where thou giuest and blessest the children with the inheritance

                  PRay that GOD may mittigate the paines of your trauaile which by reason of the transgression of your Graundmother Eue, God hath pronounced to be great, saying vnto her and in her, vnto you all, in sorrowe Gene. 3. shall you bring foorth Childe. And you daily see that th'extremity thereof, doth often ende the dayes of manye a sister of yours: (before that howre healthfull and strong.)
                  And therfore I thinke it a parte of great wisdome to prepare & addresse yourselues against that howre euen to giue vp the ghost,

for without the mercifull helpe and fauor of almightye God, you can not escape death: wherefore I wish, as many as are in that case, to betake them humbly on their knees vnto him, in harty praier, without whose outstretched arme no womās helpe can bee auailable in that behalfe: pray therfore pray, that God of his tender mercy, will vouchsafe you an howre, wherin you may be happily deliuered.

And vnto vs

the daughters of Eue for her▪ transgression thou haste appoynted moste greeuous paines and torments of body, in the trauaile of childbirth, saying that in sorrowe and great paynes wee shall bring foorth childe. Oh sweete Lord, for as much as thou art almighty and bringest all thinges to passe, according vnto thy good pleasure, and shewest thy selfe in no thing more omnipotent, then in the conceyuing, forming and bringing mankinde into the world, which (although it were in the beginning ordeyned most easie) by the subtilty of our continuall enemy sathan, in causing our first parents to transgresse thy commaundement, and to breake thy will, by tasting the forbidden fruite) it is nowe most painfull, greeuous and perilous.

Lord) mine humble and moste hartie desire vnto thy maiestie, is that thou wouldest vouchsafe to extende vnto me, and to all women in this my like case thy mercy and louing fauour to mittigate the paines thereof, that we may be able, patiently to endure and continue the panges of the same, at the howre appointed.
                  Make that easie and light vnto vs, which our desertes haue made burdensome and heauy, that the burden wherewith I am now loden, may fortunately be deliuered, from the shoulders of my weake body. Sende vs all (good Lorde) happye deliueraunce, that we may be made ioyfull mothers. And vouchsafe vnto me, and to all that haue conceiued, and be with Childe, strength to bring foorth, that which thine omnipotencie hath so wonderfully wrought in vs.
                  Be present with vs in our trauailes Oh Lorde helpe vs most mercifull God, and mightily deliuer vs. Let thy power, might and loue, be no lesse manifested, in the deliuery, then in the forming of thy creature, that beeing through thy goodnes, made glad and ioyfull mothers, we may obteyne our perfect strength againe, and liue to prayse and please thee for euermore.

Fauourably lighten me of this burden, in thy good and gratious time, and in the howre and instaunce of my deliuery, be present with mee (Lorde) and tender my safety, through Jesus Christe Amen.

which good is, nothing auoyded, which is euill, nothing continue safe, bee it neuer so durable, nor any enterprise either rightly begun or happily ended without the same, which Salomon considering (hauing promise at thine handes, that whatsoeuer he asked hee shoulde obteyne) aboue all thinges, aboue wealth or riches, worldly praise, renowne or glory, beauty or strength, yea aboue possessions or kingdoms he onely requested wisedome, which thou so aboundantly bestowedst on him, that they repayred and came from farre to heare the same, which is none other thinge (sweete Lorde) but the knowledge of thy diuine wil & heauēly misteries, it is the knowledge how to chose the good & auoid the euill, it proceedeth onely from thee, and with

and vaine cogitations of worldly wittes, considering that the one in all thinges, as well in aduersitye as prosperity, in sicknes as in health, in anguish of minde, trouble or greefe of bodie, as in wished estate and pleasure, continueth most constant, stable, patient and firme, with due consideration, that it can not be but good, whatsoeuer thou sufferest to light vpon vs; But contrariwise (sweete Lorde) the other seeketh with more dilligence, to auoyde afflictions, troubles, and worldly calamities, the crosse sweete Lord which thou layest vpon thy children, then wisely to auoyde thy heauy displeasure. And that by worldly deuised meanes, as by riches, freendship, pollicy, and strength, with this deceiuable and fonde conceite, that Fortune where she fauours, there is plenty and peace, but where she frownes there is continuall want and trouble.

wealth into want, my plenty into pouerty, and ioy into sorrowe & sadnes. Oh sweete Lord, my prosperity is turned into aduersitye, my freendes haue forsaken me. And where they haue often promised to helpe mee, they doo not onely, not performe the same, but they disdaine my company, they loath and abhorre my presence. I am vtterly refused of al mine acquaintaunce, and they that were before my familiars, are now my deadly foes. Sweete Lorde thou seeest howe I am clapt vp in cares, howe I am inuironed with a thousand causes, that procure intollerable greefe, bothe in body & minde. Oh Lorde I haue no refuge, I haue no place of defence. I haue no meane to helpe my selfe, I am

so bewrapped in calamitie, that I can not enioye any liberty either of body or minde, but moste sweete Lord, most loouing and moste fauourable, most able and moste ready to helpe, such as come to thee loden with distresse, loe heere I lye at the gate of thy mercy, knocking for ease, humbly crauing thine assistaunce, who hast willed such as are heauy loaden to come vnto thee, I come, I come, sweete Lorde, as one burdened with greefe, receiue me and helpe me, showe thy louing countenaunce, & extend the helpe of thine holy arme, and I shall be safe, mercifully heare me after thy wonted goodnes, consider my distresse weigh mine afflictions, & looke vpon my troubles.

turned againe into ioye, my pouerty shall bee releeued, with sufficiency, and all shall goe well with me, for (sweete Lord) although when I consider mine estate▪ whē I viewe my present mysery and feele my want I be striken with greate sorrowe in minde, and vexed with intollerable greefe: yet when I consider, the cause of my troubles, with due consideration of thine intent therein. Then can I not but comfortably resolue my selfe, Then doth inwarde comfort asswage the extreamitye of my greefe and sorrowe, remembring that thou hast sayde, that whome thou louest, thou punishest.
                  VVherfore I cannot but giue thee thanks (sweet Lord) for this thy fatherly correction, in altering mine estate, for better try all of my patience. That by patience I may take hold of hope, that so by hope

of thy goodnes, louing kindnes, and fatherly promises, which deceiuest no man, that vnfeynedly dependeth vpon thee) I may enioy a moste comfortable renuing of mine happie estate againe, at thy good pleasure. I cast all my burden vpon thee, as thou willest all those that are heauy loaden to doo. Refresh me most louing and mercifull God refresh me with the timely showers of thy fauour and loue. That the ioy and gladnes of mine heart, may growe vppe and choake the weedes of sorrow, and anguish of mind. Oh my surpassing comforter, leaue me not distitute of thy defence, and patronage, vouchsafe euermore to be present with me, in all my troubles, that I faint not, but may rather reioyce in tribulation, knowing, that a crowne of life, is layde vppe in store, for as many as beare thy yoke with patience. Assist me therefore (good Lord) in all these vexations and temptations of mine, that I may patiently looke for thy good deliueraunce, which although it come not as I wish, yet that (staying thy leasure) in thy good time, I may bee satisfied of my godly desire, which thou hast promised neuer to defraude vs off, nor suffer vs to depart empty away.

Thou knowest what is most necessarie and expedient for me: And therefore doo with me what thou wilt, sende mee helpe when thou wilt and as thou wilt. Loe heere I lye at the gate of thy goodnes and mercy, still looking for thy stretched out arme, to remooue that, which not of mallice, but of loue, thou hast layde vpon me. Good Lord for thy mercies sake, giue mee not ouer, leaue me not altogether helples, take not thy fauour vtterly from me. But as thou hast fatherly corrected me, so vouchsafe louingly to embrace me againe, sweete God for thy sonne Iesus Christes sake.

strength, which is as a broken Reede in mine own policie or wisdom which is foolishnes before thee▪ or in the helpe or freendship of man, which is vaine & fallable. But leade thou me and guide me in all my doinges, cogitations and words, least I erring from thy commaundements, inclining mine heart, to vaneties, and vice, mine enemies take iust occasion to say, ah ha, wee sawe it with our eyes, & bring vp an euill report of me, and that vndeseruedly: Oh Lord guide me in all trueth, establish in mine heart, true desire to walke vprightly in all my waies, in humblenes of minde, not in pryde, least they say he is so hauty he knoweth not himselfe, preserue me from drunkennes, least they say he is nowe out of the way of discretion, he is beside himselfe, we haue now sitte oportunity to worke our wills on him, and so sette on me to hurte me, vouchsafe also to keepe me from the daungerous desire of fleshly lust, from haū

Finally Oh lord keepe me from all euill, that although, by reason of my corruption, I be naturally inclined to wantonnes and excesse, thou wilt giue me sobriety, lowlines loue, (euen to mine enemies,) chastity, wisedome, and discreete vnderstanding, bothe of theyr wills, and mine owne weaknes, that through thy grace framing my dooinges according to thine heauenly

So shall hee likewise sende his Angels to take charge of thee that no kinde of danger shal preuaile against thee, if thou hartely praye his ayde, behauing thy selfe godly and vertuously, not prouoking his anger, by enterprysing that which is either vncomly or vnlawfull, but be dooing good, as S, Paule in all his

replenished with innume rable perrils and dangers both of bodye and soule, whereinto without thine assistaunce, protection & ayde, without the helpe of thy mighty hand, and out stretched arme, wee can not but fall and perish, walking and wandring, in the troublesome and daungerous coastes of the earth, where robbers, theeues, and euil affected persons, in greate number, secretely lurke, violently to take, not onely our proper substaunce and goods, which by the great labour and sweat of our bodyes, we haue gotten, or otherwise by thy prouidence, giuen vs, but out liues, also if we be not preuented, and by thy good and fatherly prouidence defended.

                     tinued, had not our firste parent, by transgression made forfeiture therof, & so highly displeased thee, that thou (repēting of the makīg of vs) didst drown the whole world, for our sins sake, & yet so tender was thy loue, so soone was thine anger conuerted into a desire of our saluation, that thou vouchsafedst to sende into thys world, Iesus Christ, to redeeme vs into thy fauor again, (a surpassing loue where the offended, shold seek attonemēt wyth the offendour) for which thy singuler loue, & mercy in finit, we can not sufficiēly thanke thee, (god of our cōfort) nor thee sweetsaui our Iesus christ, for thine obediēce, for thine vndeserued

humility, and ardent desire of our reconciliation, and eternall saluation▪ Lorde increase my faith, sende mee thy grace, and endue me with thine holy spirite, that I may hartely render, and continually yeelde; all possible thankes vnto thee, not onely for creating keeping and preseruing vs hethervnto, but also for reaching vnto vs thine hande of loue againe, after our so greate and long disobedience) I thanke thee (Oh sauiour Iesus Christe) redeemer and sauiour of our soules, who refusedst not, but most wilingly acceptedst (for our sakes) for our redemptiō, from hell and eternall death, beeing then thine enemies) the approbrious death of the crosse, among notorious offenders, beeing often spightfully intreated, buffeted, spette at, reuiled, and most iuiuriously handled, not for thine owne (sweete Iesus) but for our offences, for our sinnes (yea) to purchace that by thine obedience, which we lost by willfull rebellion against thyne heauenly fathers precept and will. Oh good Iesu, we thanke thee, that it hath pleased thee, to leaue the sacred mansion of thy Fathers right

hand, thy celestiall beeing, and to put on the base attyre of a seruaunt, to walke in the troublesome pathes of this miserable world, and yet thinking it no robbery to be equall with God, though leauing his heauenly habitation for a time, (according to his prouidence and heauenly knowledge) to suffer heer in this vale of misery, in this desert of sinne, moste cruell and most shamefull abuses, onely for our sins, which were so odious and vile, in the sight of our good God, that no sacrifice or oblation coulde appeaze his wrath, and deserued displeasure▪ towardes vs for the same, but thy death onely, and sacrifice of thy precious and vndefiled body vpon the Aulter of the crosse, who willingly sufferedst the same for our sakes, notwithstanding they were so greeuous, so in tollerable, and odius, that by reason of the extremitie and anguish rhereof, thou werte constrained, to sweat water and bloode.
                  Oh surpassing loue, Oh loue without the which, the hatred of thine omnipotent father, had not been appeazed, nor remooued from vs. Oh loue, without the which we had beene barred of all accesse vnto the seate of mercy and woonted fauour of almightye God, and continued in his heauy displeasure for euer to our vtter distruction, death and damnation. Oh sweete Iesus, Oh healthfull comforter, and giuer of health and restorer of life, howe can wee but prayse thee? how can we but loue thee? howe can wee but magnifie and extoll thine holy name for euer? who

haue receiued at thy mercifull handes so vnspeakable a benefitt, yea and who so tenderly louedst vs, that by thy meanes, (without our deserts) we are restored from death to life, frō the deserued displeasure of our creator, to his vnspeakable loue and fauour without which we had perished both body & soule, we haue attonement now with him, that before we had so greatly offended, euen God our maker, without whose fauoure wee fall, and without whose helpe wee perishe, and passe to naught.
                  Oh sweete Iesus thou haste also taken vppon thee, not onely to dye for our redemption, and rise againe for our Iustification, and to place vs in the sweete mansion of thine heauenly knowledge.
                  But haste also promised, to continue our mediatour to thine heauenly father for euer, while wee mortall men liue sinners on earth, making continuall intercession for vs, that he will vouchsafe neuer, to withdrawe his louing countenaunce from vs, his poore creatures, but to be our Castell, staye, and strong refuge vnto the ende. Oh Lord Iesus Christ we giue thee thankes, not onely for that thou haste beene for a time heer present with vs on earth, to manifest thy selfe vnto vs, by the visible showe of thine humanity▪ but in making the cause of thy comming certainly known vnto vs, which was (indeed) in that thou wast verie God) to call vs from blindnes & error (wherein we walked according to the will of sathā) to take hold of thy miracles, & wonders, which

thou so apparantly diddest worke, to declare and manifest thy selfe, to be our redeemer and aduocate, and to confirme the same in our heartes by faith, as thou diddest in the heartes of thy Disciples, who (notwithstanding there beeing present with thee, continued yet neuerthelesse in darknes and misbeleefe, without the working of thine holy spirite in them, whereby they confessed thee to be very Christe, son of the liuing God, and onely sauiour of the world; Among all which thy great benefits (Oh good Iesus,) we yeelde thee all possible thankes, for that it hath pleased thee, to leaue vnto vs after thy departure vnto the right hande of thy father, the Lanterne of light, the Gospell of comfort, the word of trueth, the foode whereon our soules may continually feede at full, without the which wee had beene left vnto our former darknes, walking in error, & in our wonted ignoraunce. And for that thou knowest vs from the beginning to be carryed into blindnes and error, wrongfully interpreting the parrables, & darke sentences of thy gospel, through the same thy loue, hast left vs a continuall cōforter, euen thine holy Ghoste, proceeding frō thy father & thee, who in the likenes of a Doue discended frō heauen vpon thee, showing himselfe vpon the Apostls in fiery tongues; Oh holy ghost our cōforter, we yeeld thee most hūble thanks that through the gift of thy grace we haue our harts prepared our vnderstāding lightned, & mouthes opened, to conceiue rightly thy word, to declare abroad

the wonderfull thinges of thy lawe, and to manifest the secrete misteries of the kingdome of God. Thou

                     rt the true light, and the light of trueth, without the which, it is impossible to please God the father, nor haue accesse to God the Sonne, who, together with thee (Oh holy ghost) are but one God in essēce though three in person.
                  Make our heartes pure, make vs cleane, sanctifye vs, and seale vs among the number of the electe and chosen, that when wee shall approche vnto the seate of iudgment, we may receiue (through the merittes of Iesus Christ) not onely the stipende of seruants, but the rewarde of obedient children, euen the inheritaunce of the kingdome of heauen. There to rest with thee Oh Father, our maker, with thee (sweete Iesus) our Sauiour▪ and with thee Oh holy ghoste our comforter, and sanctifier, for euer and euer. To whome bee all prayse and eternall glory, world without ende.
                  Amen.

                  THere is sayde sufficient in a certaine exhortation set downe in the booke of cōmon prayer, to stirre vppe the minds of all well disposed persons, willingly and zealously to come to this holy table, wher vnto before we come, wee ought to addresse and prepare our hearts, to put of all rancor mallice, wickednes, and all kinde of vice, with the fruites of the olde man, which is disobedience and sinne, and to put on the newe man, which is righteousnes, comming therevnto in a pure & cleane hart, abounding with loue, peace fayth, & charity that wee may receiue it to our comfort:

Reade the 11. chap. of the firste Cor. from the 20. verse vnto the 29. and there shall you finde, not onely the manner of the institution and celebration thereof, but also howe to receiue it with heauenly profit, the daunger in the vnreuerent and vnfaythfull receyuing of the same: (to the cosort of the Godly, & shame of the wicked.)
               
               
                  
                  SVVeete Iesus, sonne of the euerliuing and omnipotent GOD, vouchsafe I humblye pray, and beseeche thee euen for thy death sake, to instill into mine hart, the gift of thy grace, whereby approching vnto the sweete banquet of thine holy body & blood which thou vouchfafest to giue, for the redemption of vs miserable sinners, I may by faith, eate and drinke the same, and be made a fitte and faithfull member of thy misticall body, laying aside the darknes of olde Adam, embracing the light of thine obedience, loue,

and patience, that, that most preacious bodye of thine, bee not giuen not thy blood shed for me in vaine, but may direct the whole course of the residue of my life, by thine holy spirite according to thine heauenly wil, in all thinges, that after this life ended, I may appeare before the tribunall seate of his high and heauenly maiestie, as a faythfull member of thine, and enioy that heauenly enhearitaunce, which thou our head and guide hast purchased for all true beleeuers in thee.
                  Amen▪

                  Vouchsafe (oh sweet Iesus) that as thou hast giuen thy flesh to be the breade of our eternall saluation. So vouchsafe to worke in me by a liuely faith, that I receiuing the same, may be, and euermore continue one in thee, and thou in me Amen.
