lately preſſed to death in Newgate. 1569.
            
               TRue Preachers which God liketh well,
               To you I runne wyth all my hart,
               Your wordes with me are like to dwell,
               Vntyll thys lyfe I ſhall depart.
               As for the reſt whoſe tounges are tyde,
               To them who runs, he runs far wyde.
            
            
               ¶What ſo doth beſt commend the truth,
               All falſhood lykewyſe diſcommendes,
               I know you Preachers tender youth,
               And viſits them lyke faythfull frendes.
               Yet if there hap a diſmoll day,
               The Wolues would teare your liues away
            
            
               ¶But they that humbly do you beare,
               And eke well beare your woordes away,
               Hauing their vnderſtandinges cleare,
               Needes neuer feare the diſmoll day.
               Nor wyll ſeek
                     •
                   peace here in this lyfe,
               Where nought is found but war and ſtrife.
            
            
               ¶So they that do, nor yet wyll beare,
               When they be cald, and truth is told,
               Ill haps to them vnwares is neare,
               Yet blindnes maketh Bayardes bold.
               But they that warned are in tyme,
               Halfe armed are gainſt daungerous crime.
            
            
               ¶A tryall iuſt I found of late,
               Where Preachers dyd them ſelues addreſſe,
               To ſpend the day within Newgate,
               To comfort two whom Law bad preſſe.
               There did I ſee that comfort great,
               Whereof our Preachers oft intreat.
            
            
               ¶There ſaw I more, do what they might,
               Sharpe iudgement paſſ, the Preſſe at hand,
               The one would not remyt hys ſpight
               But doth the ſame to vnderſtand,
               By blaſphemies moſt horrible,
               And countenaunce moſt terrible.

               If ought there were within the hutch.
               And to it he went full egerly,
               As one that thought he ſhould not dye.

               Theſe partes you playd lyke ſlaues before.
               And vp he ſnatch hot coales in hand,
               To throw at one that by did ſtand.

               That Keeper ſhould now end hys dayes.
               Though he did burne in hell therefore.
               Sutch Keepers ſhould keepe there no more.
            
            
               ¶This deſperate foole intreated was,
               By Maſter Yong and others there,
               To pray for them that dyd treſpas,
               And to forgeue, ſithe death is neare.
               Gods woundes quoth he, it is ſhame for ye,

               ¶For my part if I boyle in lead,
               I cannot hold but brawle this out.

               ¶Thus parted he and Maſter Yong,
               Much greued for hys ſenceles ſoule.
               But I remayned and vſed my tong,
               As God dyd force vice to controle,
               But-Wat no chaungeling would not reſt,
               But fell a freſh vnto a

               ¶As I might then I did exhort,
               Them both with me to go and pray,
               Where I would ſpeake to their comfort,
               If that the Lord dyd not ſay nay.
               The time is ſhort, therefore quoth I,
               Let vs ſeeke the Lord whiles he is nye.

               The Lord hath mercy inough in ſtore,
               I may yet haue my part of that,
               As he to others hath geuen before.
               You muſt repent and cal for grace,

               With hym for to remayne alwayes.
               Wherein ſuch comfort great he found,
               That teares of ioy dropt to the ground.
            
            
               ¶I ſee now God is good (quoth he)

               Knowing that he doth heare my cry,

               And loue hym that hath loued them well,
               Who hath redeemed their ſoules from hell.

               So doth the power of the Lord,

               Then death to him could not come ill,
               For of Gods grace he had his fill.

               I ſaw no thought that he did take,

               Still all in vayne to hym was ſayd,
