                  That merite more praise,
                  Then all the rest of the yeare:
                  And welcome the nights,
                  That double delights,
                  as well the poore as the Peere:
                  Good fortune attend,
                  Each merry mans friend,
                  that doth but the best that he may:
                  Forgetting old wrongs,
                  With Carrols and Songs,
                  to driue the cold winter away.

                      a whip at his backe,
                  to the deep Tantalian flood:
                  In the Lethe profound,
                  Let enny be drown'd,
                  that pines at another mans good:
                  Let sorrowes expence,
                  Be banded from hence,
                  all

                  And wholly consort,
                  With mirth and with sport,
                  to driue the cold winter away.
               
               
                  Tis ill for a mind,
                  To anger inclind,
                  to ruminate iniuries now:
                  If wrath be to seeke,
                  Do not let her thy cheeke,
                  nor yet inhabite thy brow.
                  Crosse out of these bookes,
                  Maleuolent lookes,
                  both beauty and youthes decay:
                  And spend the long night,
                  In honest delight,
                  to driue the cold winter away.
               
               
                  The Court in all state,
                  Now opens her gate,
                  and bids a free welcome to most:
                  The City likewise,
                  Though somewhat precise,
                  doth willingly part with her cost:
                  And yet by report,
                  From City and Court,
                  the Countrey gets the day:
                  More Liquor is spent,
                  And better content,
                  to driue the cold winter away.
               
               
                  The Gentry there,
                  For cost do not space,
                  the Yeomanry fast in Lent:
                  The Farmers and such,
                  Thinke nothing too much,
                  if they keep but to pay their Rent:
                  The poorest of all,
                  Do merrily call,
                  want, beares but a little sway:
                  For a Song or a tale,
                  Ore a Pot of good Ale,
                  to driue the cold winter away.
               
               
                  Thus none will allow,
                  Of solitude now,

                  Of all the whole yeare,
                  that this is accounted the Prime,
                  December is seene,
                  Apparel'd in greene,
                  and Ianuary fresh as May:
                  Comes dancing along,
                  With a Cup and a Song,
                  to driue the cold winter away.

                  THis time of the yeare,
                  Is spent in good Cheare,
                  kind neighbours together meet:
                  To sit by the fire,
                  With friendly desire,
                  each other in loue to greet:
                  Old grudges forgot,
                  Are put in the Pot,
                  all sorrowes aside they lay:

                  Do Caroll and sing,
                  Like birds of the Spring,
                  no Nightingale sweeter in tune:
                  To bring in content,

                  to waste out his time in care:
                  And Clim of the Clough,
                  Hath plenty enough,
                  if but a penny he spare:

                  In ioy and delight,

                  To Maske and to Mum,
                  Kind neighbours will come,

                  Where Cake, Bread and Cheese,
                  Is brought for your fees,
                  to make you the longer stay:

                  When Christmas tide,
                  Comes in like a Bride,
                  with Holly and Iuy clad:
                  Twelue dayes in the yeare,
                  Much mirth and good cheare,
                  in euery houshold is had:
                  The Countrey guise,
                  Is then to deuise,
                  some gambole of Christmas play:
                  Whereas the yong men,
                  Do best that they can,
                  to driue the cold winter away.
               
               
                  When white-bearded Frost,
                  Hath threatned his worst,
                  and fallen from Branch & Bryer:
                  Then time away cals,
                  From Husbandry Hals,
                  & from the good Countrymans fire:
                  Together to go,
                  To Plow and to sow,
                  to get vs both food and array:
                  And thus with content,
                  The time we haue spent,
                  to driue the cold winter away.
