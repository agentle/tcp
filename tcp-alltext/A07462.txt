And now of late I chaunced to turne ouer my Papers, amonge the which I found this little Dialogue, concerning Phiſick and Phiſitions, writtē in the Caſtlyn tongue by a learned Gentleman, called Pedro Mexia, who ſometime was Chronicler to the late Emperour Charles the fifth. And then calling to memory the varietie of mans inclynacion, how ſome are enclined and haue delight to refreſh werineſſe, in reading & conferring with notable writers, other ſome haue great pleaſure in comfortable Muſick, and others in the conuerſation of faithfull and louing freends.
            And where I am certayne that your recreation is often times among bookes, and eſpecially in reading of trauailers woorks, as well by land as Sea. Yea and your owne perſon, hauing paſſed the Occean Sea. I may boldly ſay with no great pleaſure: yet your Woorſhippe dooth not repent

            I therfore am now the more bolder to offer this little pamphlet vnto you. Praying your woorſhip to accept the ſmall gift, and to remember the poore olde woman who offered two mites▪ her gift was ſmall, but yet with an exceeding good hart and will, and the Almightie graunt your gentle hartes deſire.

            TWo learned men Gentlemen, met by chaūce, the one of them ſpeaketh much euill of Phiſitions: and holdeth opiniō, that neither Phiſition, nor Arte of medicine ought to be, but yt men ſhould be cured with vſe and experience. The other doth commend alſo and defend, bothe Medicine & Phiſitions. And laſt of all, the matter is decided by a learned man, called Maiſter Velaſques, verie notably.

                  You ſay well, but looke what a fayre fronte he hath buylt to his houſe, certenly of late the building in this Cittie of Ciuil is greatly mended, for within theſe ten yéeres, their buildings are moſt bewtifull toward the ſtréete, with many faire wyndowes of diuers faſhions.
               
               
                  
                  Bernardo.
                  Troth it is, ye and manye auncient houſes are reedified, and although euery one can not doe as he would: yet truely ye amendment is great. But in one thyng I ſée it not, and that is, in their low buildings, for very fewe builde higher then one ſtory, whervpon the houſes remaine moyſt and of ſmall maieſtie. And therefore ſtraungers which come from Barſelona, and other Citties where their buildings are of thrée ſtories high: can not away with ours, nor yet the buyldings of this Cittie content them.
               
               
                  Bernardo.
                  You ſay troth, but it were not wiſedome to comply with bewty and brauerie, and to commit notorious hurt, bothe to health and life, in this countrey it is not conuenient to build high, and it hath been bothe aduiſe, & diſcretion, not to doo ſo, for naturally the ſituation of this Citie is hot and moyſt, and to reſiſt ye heate is a principall remedy, the ayre is freſh, which ordinarily runneth in the Sommer, it is therefore néedefull that ye houſes be open, & not very high, to be viſited with the ayre, and for this cauſe our aunceſtors

vſed this building, for certainly the high buildings are more hotter than the low, and more vnholſome in Sommer ſeaſon for want of aire, as we know ſome that are troubled with this defect, alſo it is neceſſarie in this place, the Edifices to be lowe, for remedie of the great moyſture, that both ſtréetes and houſes may be viſited of the ſunne and the ayre, ſo that if the houſes and Edifices héere in this Cittie were high: they ſhoulde be more cold & moyſt in wynter, and more hotter in Sommer. By meane whereof very vnholſome, for the moyſture is ſo great that alwayes wee muſt procure that the ſunne haue entraunce into all places of our houſes, if it were poſſible al day long, the which could not be if the houſes and lodgings were high. And alſo the cold here is not ſo great to conſume the moyſture, as it is in Castillia & other partes, and where great cold is: yet the heate of the ſunne is neceſſarie, although in Sommer it be great, to conſume the ouer much moyſture. And therefore I beléeue that our forefathers vſed to this ende, to make the ſtréetes brode, as nowe the moſt are, yea and in our daies, ſhades

and penthouſes were commaunded to be taken away for that purpoſe, where by a notorious commoditie and health hath followed:

                  Truely your reaſon is certaine and naturall, & although ſome times I haue muſed thereon, yet I was neuer ſo well ſatiſfied as now I am: and I thinke hytherto, the ſame reſpect hath bene, and if it had not, it is iuſt that it be héereafter. But it ſéemeth vnto me, that high Chā
                     bers are not good lodging, nor yet néedful for this place in the winter, which is not colde, and the heate of Summer excéeding hote. As for experience, noble men which haue high houſes, doo ſeldome dwel in them, for thoſe cauſes alleadged: but rather kéepe them to lay corne in, and for lodging of their ſeruauntes, rather then for other purpoſe, although in Caſtillia ſuch high buyldings are moſt holſome: ſo yt our houſes béeing lowe: the cauſe was not for want of knowledge: but rather came of a good foreſight. Let vs now ſée howe Don Nunio will buylde his houſe, which hath a good beginning, & héere I ſée

much ſtuffe prepared for the woorke.

                  No but yet it ſeemeth by yonder Moile that Maiſter Velaſques is with him: therefore let vs alight, and I will leade the waye.

                  No ſir, for now we come very conformable like good neighbours, and we haue not wherevpon to Diſpute, if you throwe not in a bone as you were wont to doo.

therein. For alwayes good fruite proprocéedes out of a good diſcorde.
               
               
                  Bernardo.
                  At the leaſt ſir you haue ſmall néede thereof: for it is euident that you teach vs all. But notwithſtanding our talke, ſir, how doo you féele your ſelfe.
               
               
                  Don Nunio.
                  Truely as yet I am very weake, for my diſeaſe principally hath béene of a long continuance, and alſo I was letten bloud thrée times, therefore I cannot ſo ſoone recouer ſtrength, and I haue alſo an excéeding drines, remayning in my mouthe ſo that I cannot abſtaine from drinking, and thinking my ſelfe neuer ſatiſfied, and ſurely I beleeue that the Phiſitions hath not vnderſtood the ſecretes of my diſeaſe, to cure it accordingly
               
               
                  Bernardo.
                  Sir beléeue me I know a man that would not be offended with the drines you ſpeake of, for on a time the ſame man hauing an exceeding burning feauer and drynes. The Phiſiſſion would haue giuen him certaine thinges to myttigate the heate and drought: vnto whom he

aunſwered very grauely. A pretie example. Maiſter Doctor, I pray you doo what you can to eaſe my extréeme heate. But as for my thyrſtineſſe, I would be contented to remayne with all.
               
               
                  Don Nunio.
                  Yea, but I am not ſo great a fréend of drinke: for when I am in health, I flée from the thinges that ſhould cauſe thyrſtineſſe. But truly the extréeme drineſſe which I haue now, came of a Purgation that was giuen me.
               
               
                  Iaſper.
                  Yea, and therefore I defie Phiſitions, for I promiſe you, if you had not purged your ſelf: you had bene ſooner whole, and not now ſo weake,
               
               
                  Maiſter.
                  Why ſyr, the Phiſitions know no better way to cure.
               
               
                  Iaſper.
                  Mary ſyr, and that way, I would they knew not, for it is not conuenient to be vſed.
               
               
                  Don Nunio.
                  If ye had ſéene what a diſputation héere was, about what ſhould be giuē to purge

me with all, and about the letting of me blood, ye would haue ſayde ſomwhat.
               
               
                  Iaſper.
                  Syr, I néeded not to ſée the thing, for I haue other cauſes more ſufficient, to approoue that which I meane to ſpeake of: Long agone I knewe howe the Phiſitions very ſeldome agrée in their opiniōs, yea, and I was about to ſay, that fewer tymes they happen to doo ye patient good.
               
               
                  Bernardo.
                  Then muſt I ſay alſo, that you haue for a cuſtome, ſeldome tymes to ſpeake well, either of Aduocates or Phiſitions. But ſay what you lyſt, you ſhall, will or nill, truſt the one with your life, and the A pretie concluſion. other with your goodes.
               
               
                  Iaſper.
                  Then accurſed be I, if I doo ſo, at the leaſt, to put my lyfe in the Phiſitions handes, for in all my life tyme hytherto, I was neuer let blood, nor yet haue had any Phiſitions counſell, as long as I haue gone abroade in the world. And I finde my ſelfe better in health, and more ſounder then you, who alwayes hath to doo with ſuch kinde of men.
               
               
                  
                  Bernardo.
                  Yea and therfore you brag, but I promiſe you, if any diſeaſe ſhould take you vehemently: you would then crye out for the Phiſitions.
               
               
                  Iaſper.
                  It might ſo be, that ye infirmitie might be ſuch to depriue mē of my witte, and ſo to demaund helpe of Phiſitions, but as long as my memorie ſerueth, feare not that I commit any ſuch madneſſe: for ſithens God be prayſed I haue lyued 45. yéeres without them, yea, and haue bene holpen of ſome infirmities, with holſom dyet & good regiment: I meane not now to prooue new inuentions.
               
               
                  Dun Nunio.
                  Now truly Signor Maister, this fire beginneth to kindle, for theſe Gentlemen are armed for the purpoſe.
               
               
                  Bernardo.
                  I am not diſpoſed to contend. But yet I will alwayes defend the trueth.
               
               
                  Iaſper.
                  And the ſame ſhall neuer want vnto me, therefore if you haue any thing to ſay, begin when you lyſt, for I am ready

to aunſwere.
               
               
                  Bernardo.
                  Truly Signor Iaſper, it ſéemeth a merry toy, to call medicine a new inuenciō, being as you know the moſt auncient Art in the world, approoued and admitted by God himſelfe, & by men. Haue you not read in Eccleſiaſtes, that God created medicine of the earth, & that the Wiſe man ſhould not ſlée from it, for the medicine dooth exalt & honour the Phiſition, & for medicine he ſhall be prayſed in preſēce of kings & mighty men. Alſo our Aucthors and humane woorks, maketh no leſſe accoumpt of medicine, although they differ in whom was the inuenter thereof, yet all agréeth to reuerēce & honour all ſuch. Some ſay & holde opiniō, that Mercurie was the firſt, others ſay Apis, other affirme Apoſto, & ſome Aeſculapius: Homero was alſo honored for a God, & fountaine of good writers, in many places, he I ſay commends medicine: yea, & did not let to ſhew; & name medicinall hearbes, & how medicin hath ben eſtéemed of Emperors and kings, you know better then I. You haue alſo read what reward Alexander
                     
the great gaue vnto Ariſtouolus Phiſitiō: and king Ptolome to Eraſiſtrato. Yea, & the incredible ſtipend & fees which they had in yt tyme of Emperors in Rome, wherof Plinie and others make mencion: In concluſion, looke what a treaſure health is, which paſſeth all worldly ioyes, the felicitie of the ſoule excepted: yea, and contrary wiſe, howe bitter is infirmitie. So that theſe thinges conſidered, you may ſée what honour is due to medicine, that conſerueth vs in the one, & kéepeth vs from the other.
               
               
                  Maiſter.
                  Although it hath not bene much which Signor Bernardo hath ſpoken, yet his ſtudy hath not bene ſmall, as appeareth by his explication.
               
               
                  Iaſper.
                  You haue played the good Retorician, and ſithens you haue taken the payne, I will doo the lyke. But I would firſt you ſhould vnderſtand, that I cōdempne not the good Medicine: for I tolde you that I had cured my ſelfe with only good dyet, and regunent, yea, and alſo with ſome hearbes, and other thinges whereof I

haue experience. But I condempne the euyll Phiſitions, who long agone made bothe Arte and Merchandize, inuenting and ſéeking ſtraunge and violent medicaments, fylling & darkning, with their opinions and Cawtelles, the faculties which moſt cleere and ſimply ought to be, and of himſelfe is and was in his beginning, when men cured one another for charity, and not for intereſt, and then they cured with hearbes and vertuous ſymples experimented, and not with venomous compoſitions that nowe are vſed, which you knowe not what they be, nor from whēce they come, nor to what vſe they ſerue, nor yet howe many they be, becauſe they are ſo many that they are out of number.
                  The Medicine which is commended in Eccleſiastes, is the ſame that was vſed in thoſe good dayes. But the Medicine inuented by thoſe which you ſay were holden for Goddes, becauſe they diſcouered the vertue & propertie of hearbes, ſtones fruites, and other thinges applyed them, to the Paſſions, ſores, and infirmities, without making them Artes, rules, and

preceptes, as afterward mallice & couetouſneſſe of men brought to paſſe, ſo that before that time, we foūd nothing written of medicine. Hipocrates by aucthority of Marcus Varro, according vnto Plinie affirmeth: was the firſt that wrote the precepts of medicine. The ſpace of, 600. yéeres, the Romaines defended them ſelues from Phiſitions, and would in no wiſe ſuffer them in Rome: ſince which tyme they neuer lyued ſo ſound. True it is, that in the tyme when Enullius, and Marcus Libio were Conſuls, which was after the foundation of Rome. 535 yéeres: I know not by whome perſwaded, they admitted a Greeke Phiſition Pelotones, called Archagatus, vnto whome they gaue a houſe & publique ſtipend, and as a new thing at the beginning, he pleaſed ſome men. But after they had experience of his letting blood, and his Cauteries, with ſtrange inuencions of curing: bothe he and others that were newlye come, were baniſhed, by the aucthoritie and counſell of the great Cato Cenſorinus, who lyued, 85. yéeres, becauſe you may conſider what want he had of Archagatus,
                     
or of any other. After Cato his death, the tyme running with couetouſneſſe, ambicion, and other vices, then entred Phiſitions into Rome.
                  
                  So that it plainly appeareth, before that time the Romaines had, dyet, medicines, and a way to cure with all, according to experience, without vſing any tyranny, for each neyghbour ſhewed vnto other, the thinges that he had prooued: in thoſe dayes I ſay, looue and charitie cured, and not couetouſneſſe and poyſon.
                  The Romaines only vſed not this good order, but alſo the Babilonians, who were learned. Estrabo, and Herodotus, wryte that, they had not knowen Phiſitions, and therefore they vſed (when any happened to be ſicke) to bring him foorth into the open ſtréete, becauſe his neighbours and fréendes (who had any experience in ſuch diſeaſes) ſhould giue their councell and aduiſe.
                  The ſelfe ſame order was vſed among the Egiptians and Portyngalles, after thoſe golden dayes, Signor Bernardo, Phiſitions crepte into the houſes of

Emperors & Kings, among whom, ſome were famous, as Hipocrates, who was the fountaine and father of them all, and after him came Aristogenes into ſeruice with king Antigonus of Macedonia, and Aſclepiades his familliar, who was froend of great Pompetus. Antonius Muga was entertained of the Emperour Octauianus. Alſo bothe the Appollodors, of whome Plinie wryteth: Cornelio Celſo the Romaine: the famous Eraſiſtratus who by his ſinguler knowledge, vnderſtoode howe the diſeaſe of Antiochus was vndecent looue, with his Mother in Lawe. Alſo Galenus, who now is honoured, and called Prince of Phiſitions, with many other which now I will not name. But this I knowe, notwithſtanding, that after Phiſitions began to multiply, mans lyfe began to ſhorten. And in thoſe dayes the auncient Romaines, lyued in more health then all theſe Princes, who entertayned the Phiſitions with wages, and other exceſſiue rewardes: And if you will not beléeue me, let Alexander the great, who you brought for an example, ſay his opinion, for he lyued not full fortie

yéeres. Let alſo the olde gray bearded men of the Mountaynes and Uillages, which neuer knewe Phiſitions, ſpeake their minde. And let the young men of the Cittie, declare alſo their opinions.
                  But doo you know what was the cauſe to admit Phiſitions in Rome, the great diſorder whereof I ſpake, becauſe men would not temper, and cure them ſelues according to ye rule of theyr Aunceſtors, they woulde néedes giue the charge of theyr health to them that knew it not. Wherevpon, as Plinie affyrmeth, great hurt followed to the health of man: for why, they left the care of them ſelues, and gaue credite to Phiſitions for theyr health: and the Phiſitiōs for theyr part, cared no more but for the intereſt & profit, exalting theyr Arte, and making ther of Merchandize, yea, and to giue a more comely viſage to theyr newe Science, that none might know the ſecretes therof: they began to flee from common and true renredies, and to vſe compoundes, mixtures, fruites, rootes, hearbes, neuer before ſeene nor heard of, to deceaue and bewitch the people, with the names and

hydden properties, and for the common remedies, they ſought ſtraunge, caſting cleane aſyde the true way, and ſticked faſt to their new deuiſes. Héere alſo began the diſtylling of Waters, bothe of cleane and filthy thinges. Héere began Syrrups, bothe ſwéete and ſower, ſome cléere, ſome darcke, made of ſuch conceytes, that the Diuell himſelfe would ſcarcely imagine what thing it were.
                  An other deuiſe alſo, is to cauſe vs to eate golde, ſtones, yea, and yron, lyke vnto Oyſtrages againſt all nature. Héere alſo began your Mytradate, and compound Treacle, made of aboue 54. things and ſome of them rancke poyſon: if euerie of them were good of himſelfe, the incomportable company of the one with the other, maketh an horrible poyſon.
                  The which Plinie almoſt 1800. yéeres paſt, ſayth, was made by oſtentation and apparaunce of his Arte, for it is impoſſible Nature to be ſéene, nor experience knowen, nor the temper and concordaunces of ſo many thinges dyſcordant, no it can not be. So that of theſe thinges and other lyke, they haue made

experience in mans body, with ſuch audacitie, and at all aduentures. So that in lew of giuing health: they happen many-tymes to kyll the patient, yea, and in recompence thereof, to haue his money for their labour: and that which wurſt is, there is no puniſhment for them. Tell me I pray you, what Phiſition haue you ſéene chaſtened, eyther for the death, or laming of any man?
                  Finally, Signor Bernardo, the mallice of man hath ſpoyled the beſt thing in the worlde, which is in making the thing naturall, an obſcure Artificer: charitie an intereſt, mercie, couetouſneſſe, darckening reaſon ſo much, as though none could cure but Phiſitions.
                  Ieſting at common experience, and extolling with perſwaſion theyr Arte, or Myſterie, yea, euen to the names of thinges, giuing them newe barbarous and ſtraunge tearmes, ſaying, both the Greeke and Latin names are well knowen.
                  Alſo in theyr writing they haue inuented Carraters and Sygnes, not to be vnderſtoode, but of whome they deale

withall for theyr Drugges: ſo that they procured by all meanes to darcken the thing which ought to be common, and knowen of all men.
                  Then what ſhall I ſay of the diuerſity of theyr doctrine and opinions. The Alarbes differ from the Greekes, ſo that among them ſelues, they are not conformable, neyther the one nor the other. The order and manner of curing theyr Auicena, differeth from Galenus, & thoſe of antiquitie, euen ſo much that it ſéemeth an other thing: nor yet thoſe of our tyme cure lyke Auicena, nor lyke the other, for now all conſiſtéth in inuenciōs and opinions. Yea, if you call two or thrée together, you ſhall finde each to be ſinguler in his iudgement. But when they agrée, iwis it is to the great peryll of the Patient: if you heare each of them by himſelfe it is a myracle to finde them conformable, yea, & theyr receytes ſhall be diuers and con̄trarie each to other: It ſhall not néede that I make any further recytall therof, for dayly you ſee it before your eyes, thereforē I will not weárie my ſelfe in the rehearſall.
               
               
                  
                  Maiſter Velaſques.
                  It ſhould ſéeme that theſe Gentlemen 
                        •
                     ame purpoſely to debate this matter, & héerein to ſhewe theyr learning & knowledge, becauſe I ſée them ſo earneſt: therfore we may doo well to cut of, and abreuiate theyr communication.
               
               
                  Don Nunio.
                  No Syr, that were not iuſt, that Phiſitions ſhould thus remaine, without defence. Yea, and for my part, I doo greatly reioyce to heare this talke. Therfore let the concluſion be, that ſithens each of them hath had his turne, although Signor Iaſper; hath bene ſomewhat long in his diſcourſe, let each of them haue another courſe, and no more, which ſhall be as one that wryteth his minde, and an other that replyeth in our iudgement court. And then I am to deſire you Signor Maister, to giue ſentence, who hath the right.
               
               
                  Iaſper.
                  I for my part am content, reſeruing the benefite of appellation, if the ſentēce be not giuen in my fauour.
               
               
                  
                  Bernardo.
                  And I for my part am alſo agréeed hauing ſo great a confidence in my Iuſtice, and alſo in the iudgement of Signor Maiſter, by meane whereof I binde myſelfe to his iudgement and ſentence.
               
               
                  Maiſter Velaſques.
                  A harde matter is commended vnto me. But notwithſtanding, I will ſaye what God ſhall giue me to vnderſtand, to make an ende of your contencion, ſeauing lybertie to each of you to doo what ye pleaſe.
               
               
                  Don Nunio.
                  Me thinketh Signor Bernardo, is ready for the purpoſe: begin on Gods name.
               
               
                  ¶ Heere followeth the aunſwer of Signor Bernardo.
                  
                  
                     Bernardo.
                     AT the begynning of our talke, I thought Signor Iaſper that you ieſted. But when I heard you touch in Doctrine and Hiſtories: then I knewe that

your argument was in earneſt. And therefore will I aunſwere accordingly: that which I vnderſtand of the thinges which you haue ſpoken, is in concluſion, that you thinke there ſhould be no Phiſions in the worlde: at the leaſt, ſuch as were knowen to be, and lyue of that vocation.
                     But rather you would haue vs all to be Phiſitions, and to cure one an other: alſo you would not haue medicine by Arte confounded, in Science nor Philoſophy: But onelye to followe experience and conference, and the voyce of the people, as though we ſhould lyue in the Mountaynes where no pollicie nor diſcretion ſhould be vſed.
                     Theſe two principall points I meane to ouerthrowe, as a begynning to the proceſſe, and then to aunſwer ſome of the other mallices which you haue ſpoken. In the fyrſt poynt touching Phiſitions, it is a cleare caſe that you haue no reaſon, for the name of a Phiſition is holie and amyable, and ought not to be odious vnto you: ſéeing Chriſte our redéemer dyd not deſpiſe both to be called and

holden for a Phiſition, when he was ſpeaking of himſelfe: ſayth he then, for the whole folke néedeth not the Phiſition. And againe, when he cured the eyes with clay and ſpyttle: and when he appoynted for medicine of the Samaritan
                              •
                           
                         Oyle & Wine, yea, he letted not to cure and heale infinite infirmities: and the lyke commaunded his Diſciples, for S. Paule Doctor of the people, tooke bothe perſon and office of a Phiſition, when he wrote to Timothens, willing him to drink Wine to comfort his ſtomacke. Saint Luke the Euangeliſt dyd name himſelfe a Phiſition, and letted not to giue this Office vnto the Apoſtles. The Angell Raphaell woulde alſo vſe this Office, whē he gaue a receyt vnto Tobias, wherwith he ſhould cure and recouer the ſight of his eyes. So that in this poynt you haue no waye to contend, becauſe the name of a Phiſition is profitable in the world. And if there haue bene ſome Phiſitions bothe falſe and couetous, and alſo haue vſed of ſuch things wherof you haue enlarged, and I thereof ignoraunt, you ought not iudge nor beleeue them. But

notwithſtāding, the wiſe and good ought not to be caſt of, it is a méete thing that there ſhould be perticuler and appointed perſons of ſo high an Office and miſterie, and not rather, as you would to haue all men Phiſitions, and ſo to walke in confuſion and inconſtancie, with ignoraunce of the people. Truly this way is not only vnprofitable, but alſo a thing impoſſible.
                     The example alſo of the Romaines, wherewith you helpe your ſelfe, who were. 600. yéeres without Phiſitions: I ſay with you, that it is true. But yet through ſimplicitie and want of knowledge, as they were at that time ignorant of learning, and other Arts, ſo were they wanting of Medicine. But after they vnderſtoode what Doctrine & Science was: and had receyued the ſame of the Greekes, they then embraced alſo medicine, as one of the moſt neceſſarie things. And lykewiſe the Maiſters, who had ſight therein: and euen ſo dyd the other Nations of whome you ſpake of. And where in the ſecond poynt, you will not that we follow or obſerue precepts,

nor yet to haue Arte nor foundation of Science, nor you will vs not to followe reaſon & cauſe, but only experiēce which you allowe: and therfore you iudge euill of the forme and order which is obſerued in medicines and their compound, wherof I doo not lyttle meruayle.
                     Fyrſt, you know how naked experience is in Science holden for doubtfull, and conſideration & iudgement dooth change in yéeres, with complexion, with tyme, place, and many other thinges. And therfore it is neceſſarie for him that wyll cure, to knowe theſe differences, the ſecrete cauſe and diſcouerie of the infirmitie: for it is a thing vnpoſſible the knowledge of curing vnto him that knoweth not whereof, and where the diſeaſe dyd ſpring. It is therefore néedefull that hée vnderſtand the compoſture and complexcions of humayne bodies, their humors, & which of them beareth rule, and what diſeaſe thereof may growe. For, without doubt, the cure muſt otherwyſe be handled, if you preuent the infirmyties of all fowre humors, as many Wiſe men affyrme. And contrarywiſe, if the

cauſe be in onely moyſture, as Eropilus holdes opinion: according to the writing of Cornelius Celſor and others, or in the ſpirits, as Hipocrates thought.
                     Yea, and alſo otherwiſe, if it be as Eraſiſtratus iudged, yt the blood turning backwardes, to the arteries or veynes of the ſpirits cauſe inflamation, and the inflamatiō cauſeth the moouing which we ſée in the Feuer. So that he ſhall knowe how to cure, which reacheth to the originall & true cauſe. And therfore you may conſider, whether Arte and ſtudy of Philoſophy, be requiſite or no: ſo that of neceſſity, the cauſes of infirmities ought to be knowen. And alſo to vnderſtand the quality and property of mettals, ſtones, trées, fruites, hearbs, rootes, and alſo of beaſts, and all other thinges which may ſerue to ye vſe of medicine, to auoyd error in their application. I doo not deny, but rather affirme yt experience is profitable. But I preſume and am bolde to iuſtifie, that there can be no experience without ſome reaſon or cauſe: nor yet I thinke yt our Aunceſtors dyd vſe their ſimples at all aduentures, without cōſideration.

But rather I iudge that by ſpeculations and foreſight in things conuenient, they made their experience, the which fyrſt they coniectured to be good. Therefore honour in this caſe ought not to be giuen to experience, but rather to wiſdome and counſell, which was the chéefeſt part. Nowbeit, dayly are diſcouered diuers kindes of infirmities, vnto whome experience and vſe cā not ſerue, becauſe there can be no experience of a thing not knowen. So that of neceſſitie it is néedefull to know by Arte and doctrine the obſcure cauſes of the vice and corruption, which the humors and members may ſuffer in a man, beſides theſe that are playne and open, as colde, heate, hunger, replexion, and other lyke.
                     He alſo that will be a Phiſition, ſhould vnderſtand what thing is actions, or naturall operations, and what are thoſe by the which we giue and take the ſpirit of breath, we eate and drinke, the place of diſgeſtion: and how the ſubſtance of our foode is deuided to giue ſtrength to our bodies in all places. Alſo it is néedefull to be vnderſtoode, why our Pulſes haue

continuall moouing, and what is the reaſon and cauſe of ſléepe & watching: without knowledge whereof, it ſéemeth that he ſhould not know how to preſerue and cure infirmities. Beſides this, men ſuffer great paynes and paſſions in the inward partes and members of the body, which is a thing néedefull to be known, & to haue ſéen Anothomyes of ſome dead bodyes, to haue marked & conſidered the cullor, the figure, the bigneſſe, the order, and the hardneſſe & ſoftneſſe of them all. Alſo the variety and deuiſion of the ſame members, among themſelues, which doo ioyne together, or how they giue place & receyue: As we reade that Erophilus and Erafistratus dyd, requiring for the ſame purpoſe, men that were condempned to death, to prooue experience. For it is a playne caſe, that when any gréefe or interior hurt happeneth, and not knowen, how or where it is, nor yet to apply outward medicine, for the vncertayntie of the inward gréefe, nor the nature & reaſon thereof. And finally, for auoyding of 
                           〈◊〉
                        , I ſay that there are many neceſſary things appertayning to a good

Phiſition, yea, and to declare them only▪ it is requiſit that ſuch a one be a learned Philoſopher. How much more to know how to put them in vre, inſomuch, that Hipocrates ſayth, that a good Phiſition ought to knowe the diſeaſe paſt, & to vnderſtād the cure preſent: and alſo to pro
                        
                           •
                        oſticate the thing to come. So that Signor laſper, if you haue harkened well vnto me, you will not let to confeſſe that it is a thing neceſſary for Phiſitions, to haue bothe rules and precepts, and that they be grounded on Sciences & Artes. And as this is a thing, that can not be common: it is therfore neceſſarie to haue perticuler men Phiſitions, who ought to be honoured and eſtéemed as alwayes they haue bene. And it is not ſufficient that you alleadge, that vices and diſorders brought Phiſitions to Rome, for although it had ſo bene, it ſéemed a ſpeciall gyft of God, who hauing ſent them diſeaſes, dyd alſo ſend them remedy: And againe, contend and ſay what you lyſt, the Phiſitions dooth not counſell any to diſtemper them ſelues: but when any happeneth to be dyſtempered, then the

ſtraunge is their owne proper and true names from their origen, which is not vulgarly vnderſtoode. And where you ſpeake of their Letters & receypt, it may be accoumpted a ieſt, & a thing not woorthy of aunſwer: becauſe you know that ſuch breuiations are vſed to auoyde perplexitie, for euery Science hath his tearmes, and breuiations in wryting.
                     And againe, where you touched theyr varietie in iudgement, the diſcharge is euident, conſidering the wittes & iudgemēts of men are diuers, ſo yt with a good & whole intenciō, they may be cōtrary in theyr ſentence, and with ſmall perill in medicine: conſidering that one diſeaſe may be cured by diuers wayes. And by this meanes Phiſitions may varry, and by ſūdry wayes come to one ende, which is the cure & health of the Patient. Now in this order, your euyll ſuſpition & opiniō is daſht and broken in péeces, by the ſufficiēt reaſons which I haue declared. And I thinke without any more contencion, you ought to ceaſe & leaue of your ar guing, and becauſe I hope you will ſo do: I will not now procéede any further,

although I haue matter ynough.
                  
                  
                     Dun Nunio.
                     By my fayth Signor Maister, although I vnderſtand little, yet me thinketh that Signor Bernardo hath ſhewed himſelfe a valliant Drator, ſo that I am nowe on the Phiſitions ſyde, I know not what Signor Iaſper iudgeth.
                  
                  
                     Maiſter Velaſques.
                     What he thinketh he wyll ſay: for as yet I ought not to ſpeake, becauſe ye haue made me Iudge, his turne abydeth for him, he hath alſo wytte and yéeres to aunſwer for himſelfe.
                  
               
            
            
               ¶ The ſecond part of the Dialogue of Phiſitions, wherin the matter is concluded and ended.
               
                  Iaſper.
                  
                     I Am cleane contrary to the opinion of Signor Bernardo, and wyll not conſent to any of his allegations: nay rather, I ſweare by my conſcience, that his own reaſon hath confirmed me more in my

Phiſition remedieth the ſame.
                  And where you murmure, of the inuencion of Syrruppes and diſtylled waters, and of the compoundes of medicines, you are the more to be blamed. For rather the wytte and aduice of the inuentor is to be prayſed, and to receyue the ſame as a good gyft, & mercy of God, who dayly giueth vs new remedyes and medicines.
                  And if in olde time they wanted knowledge to make Syrrups, and diſtyll holſome waters, both ſwéete & pleaſaunt, as now are vſed: I ſay therein, the aduantage is ours, and are therfore more boūd to be thankfull to Phiſitions, for ſo profitable and ſwéete a thing: and becauſe it is a new inuencion, it is not therfore to be deſpiſed. For likewiſe in olde tyme they knew not was Amber Muſke, nor Siuitte, which are moſt ſwéete and excellent Odors: And alſo the Mytridate and compound Treacle, which you reprehend. The reaſon is, becauſe you vnderſtand not, neyther the compoſition, nor the vertue of the things wherof it is made, nor yet the effectes therof.
                  
                     
And where you ſay that Phiſitiōs ought to be puniſhed as mankyllers, you are therefore worthy of great reprehenſion, to preſume that they of mallice would kyll any, ne yet through ignorance they cānot do it. But for their ſtraight examinatiō I doo not miſtike: but rather holde it for a thing conuenient, notwithstanding, the Phiſition vſing well his office in the obſeruing of Rule & Arte, and the Patient ſhould happen to die: he ought not to be puniſhed for his death. And of the ſame opinion was Plato, appearing in the ninth Dialogue of his Lawes.
                  And alſo where Phiſitions procure to be payde for theyr paynes, they ought not therfore to be reprehended, ſithens that by the Law of God and man, the laborer ought to haue his hyre. God alſo cōmaū
                     deth, that the Oxe that freadeth out the Corne, be not muſtod. Moreouer, I may ſay, that of too much ſharpnes of wytte, nay rather of mallice, wher you preſume that of induſtry they darcken their Arte, with ſtraūge names of things: for why, if you vnderſtoode them: you would ſay that thoſe names which ſeemed vnto you ſtraunge

opinion. And before I had heard him ſpeake: I was not ſo great an enemy of Phiſitions, as now I am. But whether I haue reaſon or no, by mine aunſwere ye ſhall heare.
                  Fyrſt, I ſay you haue well vnderſtoode my deſire, wherein I would haue no office of Phiſitions, in a common weale, at the leaſt, ſuch as ſhould cure for money. But that we ſhould one counſell & cure an other. And alſo we ſhall know & vſe ſuch remedies, which are already knowen & prooued by auncient men of experience, and to ſtick vnto the ſame. If this thing might ſo be, although there were ſome inconueniences: yet truly, they ſhould be much leſſe thē thoſe which procéede from the good and euyll Phiſitions. By meanes of theyr purges & repurges, bléedings and rebleedings: yea, and you ſhould haue as ſmall a diffyculty therin, if determynatly we ſhould begyn to dyſpute, as to ſpeake one language, and to haue one cuſtome which are auncient in our Countrey, yea, and the great vſe of olde tyme, ſhould be as eaſy to cure the diſeaſed, as in theſe our dayes.
                  So that héere is proofe and argument

to ſée, that for the one part of medicine, which according to theyr owne opinion is the principall, which they call 
                        •
                     ſuall: that is to ſay, to know of what the Patient ought to féede, howe, & what it ſhould be, more or leſſe, the experience, vſe and coūſell which they haue among them ſelues, and now ſo commō to men: wherby without either counſell or receypt of the Phiſition, men know what to eate, how & in what quantitie. And ſuch rule wiſemen dare vſe and obſerue. I ſpeak not of ſuch, who will voluntarily be diſordred. Why alas, if in this, which is the chéefeſt poynt, we can lyue without tutors? why ſhould we not then bring to paſſe, ye vſe of curing ſhould be as well knowen among vs? for why, the difficulty or peryl ſhould be no greater, as I will ſhew, after that I haue made aunſwer to your argument.
                  And therfore will I chaūge the forme of aunſwering, becauſe we are contrary in opinion. You meane to defend the Phiſitions; of tyme preſent, ſaying: that Chriſte our redéemer, dyd compare himſelfe to Phiſitions, and that truly is as

much, as to defend the cruelty of the Lyons, becauſe they are alſo called Lyons. Beſydes this, your argument is verie weake, becauſe your cōpariſon of Chriſt to a Phiſition dooth not ſo well fit your purpoſe. So that I ſay, you may make them more perticuler: yet you ſhall ſée ye Chriſte dooth rather approoue my opiniō then yours, for he dyd not appoynt amōg his Diſciples, one nor two to heale and cure: but generally, commaūded them all vnto whome he gaue eſpeciall grace, to cure and make whole, as you your ſelfe affyrme: ſo that this allegation maketh for me. And where you ſpeake of the Angell Raphaell, and S. Paule: truly thoſe holy Perſons, ſent not the ſicke folke to the Phiſitions of the Cittie to be cured: but rather they themſelues tooke ye cure in hand, béeing none of that vocatiō: and how I pray you? iwis not with Purgations, nor blood letting, nor with your Diacatulicions, nor Skamonea: but the one with a lyttle Wine, whereof he had experience, & the other with the vertue of a Fiſhe, which God gaue him for that purpoſe. And therefore, Maiſter mine,

ſithens that this Office is cōmon to Angelles and to men: it is not iuſt that two or thrée ſhould ingrate the ſame, lyke tyrants in the Towne: becauſe forſoothe they are learned men as you ſay, as I would to God they were: But if they be, in good time be it, for I ſay not that learning hurteth any. But I ſay that for the vſe of curing, it is not néedefull, for I holde not ſuch thinges neceſſary, but only for the knowledge of cléere and euident thinges. For why, it is not greatly materiall to knowe the firſt and ſecrete origen of a diſeaſe, but rather to knowe what dooth helpe: But the inquiſition and intelligence of ſecrete and hydden cauſes, and the knowledge of their naturall operations, and ye reſt which you ſay is neceſſary to be knowen, I holde for a vaine thing, and alſo impoſſible.
                  For beſides, that the ſecrets of nature are incomprehenſible, it is playne that this is ſo, for why, thoſe that preſume to know this matter, are Phiſitions and Philoſophers, who are diuers and contrary in theyr opinions, and can giue no certayne rule nor reſolution.
                  
                     
For how would you that the Phiſition ſhould know the radicall cauſe, and firſt origen of all infirmyties, theyr opinions béeing ſo variable, as you your ſelfe haue declared.
                  And why ſhould I more beléeue Hipocrates (who affyrmeth the ſubſtaunce of the matter to be in the ſpirites:) then Eraſiſtratus, who attrybuteth it to the turning backward of the blood to the arteries? And why ſhould I credite more theſe, then others, who aſſygned other prynciples? And howe will you knowe how diſgueſtion is made in the ſtomack. Truly, I for my part, dare no more credite the one, then the other. Séeing there are ſo many opinions, vpon the caſe, for ſome ſay yt the foode boyleth with heate, others ſay that it rotteth by way of attrycion & grynding, others denieth them bothe, & each giueth ſuch reaſōs, as ſéeme true: ſo yt following the opinion of any of them, the cure ſhalbe perticuler & cleane contrary the one to the other. So that ſéeing the cauſes & origen ſo diffycult, ye certeynty ſéemeth vnpoſſible, & I ſée no cauſe for a man to weary himſelf therin.

But only to cōtent and ſerue our ſelues with the remedy that experience hath taught vs. And cōſidering that it importeth not to know what cauſed the infirmity, but only the way to cure the ſame: Nor yet I will not trouble my ſelfe to know how diſgeſtiō is made, but chéefly to know what meate is ſooneſt diſgeſted, & what is good to helpe the ſame. Without vering my ſelfe to knowe the cauſe why: nor yet I paſſe not to knowe what is the cauſe of ſhortnes of breath, but rather ye way to remedy it without payne: I will neyther know, who mooueth, nor how the artyres mooue: but only vnderſtand what ſignifieth the diſordered moouing. And alſo it maketh not for your purpoſe, that you alleadge for new diſeaſes that may happen, for when any ſuch thing doo happen, he that cureth, ought not to imagine what ye origen was, ſéeing that of cōmon things he is ignorant, as before I haue declared. For it is ſufficient to conſider how the lyke infirmity hath bene cured, & without medicine, and ſo by experience, we may hyt on the certeynty. As for example, the diſeaſe of the

Poxe, how ignorant were Phiſitions in the cure, as long as they went by Sciēce & Arte? But after experience had taught vs ye vſe of the wood, called Lignum Vite, or Lignū Sanctum: How notoriouſlie were the diſeaſes cured? without the knowledge of the origen of the diſeaſe, nor yet the cauſe why the ſayd medicine dooth helpe?
                  It ſéemeth alſo vnto you a neceſſarye thing, the Anathomy of dead bodyes: and in my iudgement, it is a thing of ſmall effect, yea, & I rather holde it for a kinde of crueltie. For true it is, in ſuch an Anathomy, there remayneth neyther the proper cullor, ſoftnes or hardnes, or any other liuely thing, which you ſay was in the members of the dead and wounded bodyes, which are abyding in the lyue & ſound bodyes: for if there be in a whole and liuely man, colde, feare, wearines, or any other meane affect, or alteration, which make exterior, & notorious chaū
                     ges in the cullor and poſture of the face: it is much more lyke the interior members, which are more delycate to change and alter with a ſtraunge ayre.
                  And truly I holde it for a méere madnes

to beléeue that the Armony and conſert which is in ye liue body of a man, is to be found in one that lyeth a dying, or is already dead. Now if the Anathomy were of any effect, or coulde giue any lyght for the health of man, there dayly chaunceth men to be ſlayne in the warres, and by other miſchaunces: where without crueltie, but rather to cure theyr woundes, they might make experience without the ſpoyling and breaking vp of mannes fleſhe, by him that hath profeſſed rather to heale it.
                  And where you ſay that ſuch men experimented, are Fallares, becauſe they chaunge with age and tyme: I ſay that experience found out thoſe chaūges and not Arte, ſo that to experience all is due, and by the ſame, all is obtayned. Moreouer, the aunſweres which you make to my reaſons are ſo weake, that they néede no reply at all. And where you ſay that Phiſitions are not the cauſe of vices and diſeaſes, becauſe they counſell none to diſtemper them ſelues, but rather cure theyr hurte, receyued by diſtemperance. But I ſay, becauſe ſome men haue ſuch confidence in them, they encorrage them

ſelues to be gluttons, and dyſordered perſons, yea, and ſome tymes they giue them ſuch counſell.
                  But ſithens that Signor Maiſter, is héere preſent, marke what Saint Ambroſe ſayth, vpon the. Cviij. Pſalme, which is. The preceptes of Medicine are contrarie to the diuine counſelles, becauſe they forbyd faſting, and permit no Uigilles, yea, they will compell men in ſuch ſort, that he who giueth himſelfe there vnto, ſhall vtterly deny himſelfe.
                  And where againe, you would defend Phiſitions from puniſhment, by the Lawes of Plato I aunſwere: that it is firſt néedefull that you bring the approbation of thoſe Lawes from the Emperour, for without that, your Lawes are of ſmall effect: but although they were, Plato dooth not ſalue, but onely hée that cureth well, by whome if any miſchance happen, he is faultleſſe. But I ſpake vnto you onely of ſuch as knowe not what they doo, which is the cauſe that they erre in that which they take in hand, and where there is on the earth no puniſhment for ſuch: I beſeeche God to chaſten them, for it is a hard caſe that only Phiſitions

are neuer ignorant of any thing. But if you goe to an Aduocate or Counſellor in the Law, with any hard queſtion, he will aunſwer, that be will ſtudy the cauſe. If you goe to a Diuine, he will oftentimes make theyr aunſwere, and ſo will men of other faculties. But the Phiſition wyll incontinent make aunſwer to a thouſand diſeaſed ſolke, if they demaund any thing. Yea, they iudge it a leſſer faulte to erre, then to confeſſe that they know not. Likewiſe their errors and euill ſucceſſe, they will not let to lay on ſome body, eyther the diſorder of the Patient, or the mallice of the humor, and whether I ſay true or no, I put you for witneſſe.
                  And where you ſay, that I vnderſtand not ye properties & vertues of medicines, cōpounds: I aunſwer that you ſay true, and I affirme the ſame, & ſay, that neyther the Phiſitions, nor yet their Auicena, vnderſtood them: nor yet is it poſſible to vnderſtand the Armony and temper of. 300. thinges together, and therefore they are abhominable. And for my part I will yéelde no thankes for the inuencion of them, as you commaund.
                  
                     
Neyther yet holde I for profitable, the Muſke, Siuit, and Amber, although they are of delectable ſwéetnes in Odor, for we might wel be without them: for they profit not ſo much the health of the body, but in as many tymes they are hurtfull to the ſoule: And ſithens you are ſo wholy iudging, that thoſe names & darke receypts are not made by induſtry & mallice, I pray you be a meane héereafter, to kéepe me from occaſiō of ſinne: to induce them to Phiſitions, to make theyr receyptes with a fayre plaine letter in our language, & then I will iudge as you doo. So that now Signor Bernardo, ſéeing that your argumentes and aunſweres vnto mine, are of no efficacie or ſtrength, you ought to put them cleane from your opinion, and that you diſturbe not medicine to be commonly knowen, and let vs not permytte to be ſubiect to two or thrée: Wherof Plinie complayneth becauſe we will not knowe what is good for vs, and ſo we goe vpon other mens ſéete, we eat with other mens appetite, whervpon our lyfe and health is an arbitrement. Be not ſo curious in this matter, as to ſpend in learning, to ſtudy in the Uniuerſitie

all your lyfe tyme, by meane of which paynes, you may gette more diſeaſe, then by your ſtudy you might learn to cure. So to conclude, it is ſufficient what I haue ſayde, to approoue, that Experience, dyet, & good regiment, ſufficeth principally for our health. Therefore, let vs not ſéeke rationall experience: but embrace the experimentall. And thinke not that medicine was found before reaſon, for the good Huſbandman and the Marriner, by vſe and practiſe, came to be Maiſters, and not by ſtudy and learning to knowe the quallities of the heauens, nor the courſe of Planets and Starres, nor yet the bookes of heauen, and world of Aristotle: for why, we dayly fall among naturall infirmyties, with our chyldren, ſeruaunts, & neyghbours, therfore we ought not to be careleſſe, for the vſe and diſeaſe doo make vs Artiſtes, we haue nowe no neede of foundations: for the auncient and cōmon opinion, which experience we holde for Maiſters, without buying the ſame for money: howe much more men ought not to be inferior to the Fowles of the ayre, and Beaſts of the Wylderneſſe, among whome there

are many that haue knowledge in medicine, neceſſarie for theyr vſe: As the Harte knoweth howe to drawe out the arrowe wherwith he is wounded, with an hearbe called Ditamo. The Swallow giueth ſight to her young ones, with the hearbe Chilidonia: the wylde Boore cureth with Organy. And many others likewiſe, of whom Plinie, and other wryters make relation.
                  Then it ſhould not ſéeme much for man to doo the like: and thinke not, yt it ſhould be a thing vnméete to liue in ſuch vniformity, although you think we ſhould erre for want of Phiſitions: Howbeit, the greateſt error is, in hauing too many of them, and theyr medicines. Nature hath a care to heale the ſicke, with verie lyttle helpe: for the Phiſitions them ſelues, ſay, that Nature is he that woorketh and cureth, and that they be but myniſters.
                  In this ſort lyued the Romaines, the time yt I haue declared, and all the world accordinglye, before Phiſitions were knowen, and the lyke at this day among the people which dwel in the Moūtaines and barren Countries, who lyue longer and more in health, then the Cittizens,

where medicine & Phiſitions aboūdeth.
                  Thoſe men I ſay, would neuer ſuffer Phiſitions to come among them: but only cure them ſelues with good regyment, hearbes & experience, among whome I could name ſome notable perſons. But one will be ſufficiēt for all the reſt, who is the lyght, and honor of Spayne, for his incomparable doctrine and learning, he is called the Comendator, Hernam Nunes, maiſter of Rethorike, & other Artes, in the famous Uniuerſity of Salamanca, who as yet would neuer put his health in the handes of any Phiſition, and hath conſerued ye ſame aboue, 70. yéeres without their helpe.
                  You know alſo that in yt tyme of great Pompeius was the toppe of the Mountain is for power: and dellycate Romaine wittes, as Plinie wryteth, and other Authors. Howe Aeſclepiades the famous Phiſition, condempned the Rules & preceps of all others, and cured onely with dyet & rule, in eating, drinking, and rubbing the ioyntes and members, ſo that with theſe things of great experience, he condempned vtterly Purgations, Uomyts and ſuch lyke: the fruite of his curing

dyd ſo much profite, that he onely was prayſed and admytted, and infinite people came vnto him.
                  The ſame Plinie ſayth in his. 35. Chapter, that he happened to cure one that was thought to be dead, and caried to burying, or to be burned, as thē the vſe was: ſo that Aeſclepiades ſayde, that his medicine was certayne, which he affirmed of himſelfe, becauſe his regiment kept them from ſickneſſe, or elſe he required not to be taken for a Phiſition: and truly, be emplyed the thing which he affyrmed, for he himſelfe was neuer knowen to be at any tyme ſicke vntyll his death, although he lyued verie long, and with the fall from a Ladder, he ended his lyfe.
                  So that it appeareth manifeſtly by mine allegations and proofes, that my opinion is not new, or ſinguler, but common and of great antiquitie, bothe certayne and true: and for ſuch you ought to embrace it, and ſo I hartely pray you. Wherwith all I conclude, although I leaue much behinde to auoyde prolixitie.
               
               
                  Don Nunio.
                  Truly Signor Iaſper, you haue ſayde well, and I for my part am ſo tender of

condicion, that euery one hauing ended his tale, carryeth me with him. But yet now I will ſtay a whyle to heare the determination of the Signor Maister.
                  
               
               
                  Bernardo.
                  If you will giue me leaue, I promiſe that my aunſwere ſhall not want. But ſithens the Signor Maister hath to giue ſentence in Iuſtice ſo manifeſt, béeing ſo iuſt and wiſe a Iudge: there néedeth no farther information.
               
               
                  ¶ The Iudgement and determination of the Maiſter.
                  
                     Maiſter Velaſques.
                     TRuly Signor Dun Nunio, I would gladly be frée from my bond, becauſe I ſée each of theſe Gentlemen ſo earneſt in theyr opinions, yea, and the cauſe ſo well treated and defended, that I take the Plea for doubtfull: But ſithens the matter conſiſteth not in any Article of the fayth: I may ſpeake what I thinke, and they ſhall haue what they payd.
                  
                  
                     Don Nunio.
                     Yet ſyr I pray you procéede, although they are ſo bent to theyr opinions, they

referre the determynation to your learned iudgement, ſo that they cannot chuſe but humble themſelues thervnto, wheras reaſon demaundeth the ſame.
                  
                  
                     Bernardo.
                     That which Signor Don Nunio ſayth, is true, and therin we will bothe receyue curteſie, at the leaſt I for my part excéeding great.
                  
                  
                     Iaſper.
                     And I much greater, for I beléeue aſſuredly, his woorſhippe will approoue my opinion.
                  
                  
                     Maiſter Velaſques.
                     Becauſe I holde it for a good exerciſe, I will fulfyll your requeſtes, and giue my vowe in the matter, for I haue no iuriſdiction to pronounce ſentence, nor yet your maiſterſhippes bound to paſſe or accept the ſame. But if I ſpeake any thing to purpoſe, each may accept what he pleaſe, for I meane not to argue or diſpute, but bréefly in few woords, I will ſpeake what I thinke. Your contencion principally conſiſteth in two points, and all the reſt is acceſſary thervnto.
                     The firſt is, that the one ſayth, that for to cure humaine infirmities, neither

Arte nor Science, is néedefull, but onely ſuffiſeth vſe and experience.
                     The other ſayth, that Arte & Rules are moſt néedefull, and he that ſhould cure, ought to be a Maiſter, learned, bothe in Arte & Science, and to haue great foundation in learning, as largely the matter hath bene communicated.
                     The ſecōd point which ſéemeth to come from the firſt, is, that Signor Iaſper, who holdeth the part of only experiēce, would yt there ſhould be no knowen Phiſition: but that generally all mē ought to cure. And Signor Bernardo, defēdeth the cauſe & ſayth, that it is conuenient to haue them.
                     The troth is, that the firſt & principall queſtion is not new, nor yet you the firſt that haue mooued and diſputed the ſame: but rather it is very auncient in medicine and among Phiſitions. And we ſay that alwayes haue bene the lyke diſcord, for ſome doo follow only experience, and therfore they were called Experts. And other deſirous to knowe the reaſon and cauſes, and therefore they were named Rationalles. Cornelius Celſo, and other Authors doo wryte thereof at large, and bothe the one & the other, hath had great

fauorers, ſo yt of theſe two firſt extremes 
                           •
                        f of force the one muſt be accepted, and the other to haue remedy.
                     The laſt perill and moſt reaſonable, is to follow the firſt, as Ariſtotle ſayth, that thoſe of experience are moſt fit, and able to cure, then the learned without experience. And ſpeaking perticulerly, Plato of Phiſitions, in his bookes of common weale, affyrmeth that a good Phiſition néedeth to communicate bothe with ſick and whole men, yea, and that he himſelf haue bene alſo ſicke, finally, the ought to be experimented: and alſo there is no doubt, but that medicine and Arte therof had his origen of experience, and no otherwiſe. So that in this caſe Signor Bernardo hath no reaſō to deny the ſame, for certaynly the experiēces béeing knowen, men as amazed began thereby to enter into Philoſophy, and thereby to ſéeke out bothe reaſons and cauſes, and ſo is this true in other actes, as well as in medicine, whereof is aucthor Ariſtotle in his bookes of high Philoſophy, and alſo Marcus Manillius, and Virgill, doo teſtifie the ſame, ſaying: by vatiable caſes experience made Arte. And becauſe I

doo not remember which of theſe Gētlemen alleadged Saint Ambroſe.
                     
                     I doo remember nowe that fauouring and holding part with Medicine, he dooth ſay and affirme in the ſame, I will therfore declare his woords, becauſe his aucthority is great, which are theſe. Where ſayth he, had Medicine origen, but onely of infirmitie. And where in the firſt age, men would teache theyr ſucceſſors, and Decendentes, what thinges had done them good, and wherewith they cured theyr diſeaſes, whereby vſe made Arte, and infirmitie made maiſterie, and that is the firſt and ſufficient medicine, which experience made, and not the coniecture, and therefore they were called Expert, ſo that out of this ſort ſprung the other, and from thence tooke his vſe & force, ſo that woord for woord, S. Ambroſe affyrmes the ſame.
                     But to auoyde wearineſſe, I alleadge not other reaſons and aucthorities, for therein is no doubt at all: but that experience was origen to medicine, & totally neceſſarie. But yet notwithſtanding, thoſe that were named expert, remayne not victors, who will not allowe any other

thing but onely experience, nor yet are ouercome. The Rationalles, which followeth Arte, becauſe betwixt theſe two opinions there is a thyrd, & a meane which ought to be obſerued, and that is. That although experience was, and is the origen, and without the ſame we can not well craue this faculty: yet notwithſtanding, after the expected preceptes, Arte was profitable, and not onely profitable, but alſo neceſſary, as well for the inconſtancie and chaunges which are in experience, as by reaſons. Héere hath bene touched, as well to chuſe and know the beſt, which without learning were vnpoſſyble to doo. For it is a playne caſe, that without learning and doctrine you can not make an intiere iudgement and election.
                     And if this thing ſhould not be reduced to Rules and Arte: all ſhould be confuſion, and forgetfulnes, and diſcord would confound all: ſo that if onely experience ſhould be admytted. Yet Arte and Rules thereof, ſhould be needefull to knowe and learne, howe and at what tymes, in what places, at what ages, in what diſpoſitions, to what infirmities,

and to what occations the
                           •
                         
                        
                           ••
                        ofit to ſome, and what vnto others, and hereof perforce wée can not be without Rules and meanes, and this is the Arte which may not be wanting: for although experience hath bene the origen, and knoweth howe to finde, but not to kéepe.
                     But Arte dooth kéepe and conſerue: alſo you haue no leyſure, euerie day to make experience, nor all men can not make euerie proofe, nor yet to carrie in minde the thinges that hath bene done without Rule and artifice therof. And for proofe of a thing ſo notorious, it ſhall not néede many reaſons, nor aucthorities, for the experience wée haue before our eyes, that there is no worke nor occupation ſo baſe, which is not guyded by Arte and reaſon.
                     The Huſbandman, and the Marriner of whome Signor Iaſper ſpake, ſaying, vſe maketh maiſterie. Although the ſame were ſo, yet they can not want theyr Regimentes, grounded vpon experience, wherby they were guyded, and learned theyr Arte, to be a lyght to teach others the thinges, whereof experience neuer wanted vnto them.
                     
                        
The like dooth the Maſon, the Carpenter and other Artificers, who ioyntly with vſe and experience, haue their foundatiō and Rules. And ſithence medecin hath a more precious and higher ſuiect: it is no reaſon that it ſhould by them be deminiſhed, how much more many of the other cauſes, and knowledge of other things, which already hath béen argued, and although ſame will ſay that to know ſuch thinges: ſhould not notoriouſly be neceſſary. Yet at the leaſt they cannot deny, but that it is profitable, & alſo although the ſame ſhould not make a Phiſition more perfit: yet he ſhould be made more diſcréet and aduiſed, all which things can not be brought to paſſe without the learning of Arte and Rules, & if theſe things are difficult & many, they are not therefore to be refuſed nor yet the knowledge of them, as Signor Iaſper affyrmeth: we know well that Arte is long, but yet cō
                        tinuall labour and goodwill ouercommeth And alſo if all may not be known yet paſſe with the poſſible, and moſt neceſſarie: and though there be varietie in oppinions, yet alſo their are determinations, and reſolucions, there are alſo

Phiſitions and Counſell for all, wherof the good Phiſition, ought to be repleniſhed, more then an other, of this opinion are the moſte of the wiſe and learned Aucthors. But chéefely Plato in his booke of Rethorick, ſaith, for this cauſe is Arte the medecyn, for why: it is a faculty that dooth conſider & know the nature of him that cureth, and the cauſe of the thing that worketh, and can of thoſe thinges giue a ſufficient reaſon. And that which is alledged is not to be vnderſtood only neceſſary to cure the infirmytie, but alſo, a way to ſuſtaine the health: for although Signor Iaſper ſay that we know how to eate and drinke without counſell of the Phiſition, or other Arte by only experience: true it is, but he that ſo dooth vſing temperaunce: dooth follow counſels and Rules, and alſo aduiſes giuen by Phiſitions and wiſe men, and not ſo dooing commonly is cauſed infyrmitye.
                     And euen ſo the moſte Sapient Cicero in his ſecond booke of Offices, affyrmeth that for to gouerne and ſuſtaine health, is needefull for a man to know his owne complexion, and to abſtaine

from ſuche thinges that offende him, and to vſe of other thinges which agrée, and are profitable for him, and to followe the counſell and Arte of them who knowe the ſame, meanyng the Phiſitions. So that to conclude, for with men ſo graue and wiſe, I néede not to enlarge.
                     The reſolucion and my vowe is touching the firſt poynte, which was if onely experience were ſufficient, or elſe if Arte and learning were néedefull of which two wants in a Phiſition: The want of learning is more to be ſuffered than the want of experience, but alſo that the perfit Phiſition ought to be expert and learned, ſo that the Medecine muſte appeere on bothe ſides, that is aſwell in the experimented as rationales, and ought to haue Arte, precepts, and foundation ioyntly with experience.
                     Now let vs precéede to the ſecond point, which is whether it be néedefull to haue perticuler Phiſitions, apointed & ordained or no. I ſay that of my former words dooth follow the true concluſion: that it is neceſſary to haue Phiſitions and

knowen maiſters, and that generally all men may not be of that vocation for although that only experience were neceſſary: it were not poſſible that all men ſhould be experymented. How much more we haue approoued, and holde for certaine that Arte, Rules, and variable doctrines are néedefull, the which cannot be commen. And ſithence of all other Artes, and mecanycall Artifices, there are workemen, and knowen Maiſters: Medecin ought not to be of leſſe condiciō and to haue learned me therein, bothe to ſtudy and diſpute if néede require: then coning to be experimented, may vſe and cure with holly medecine: And it is not to holde for compariſon, that Chriſt did commaund all the Apoſtles to cure and heale infirmities, for that purpoſe was only to lay foundation of our holy faith, and not principally for corporall health whereof we now treate: how muche more, bothe for the one, and for the other, he choſe and apointed ſeuerall perſons, and gaue no power without diſtinction and election, the office and names of ordayned Phiſitions, Signor Iaſper, are of more antiquity, then as yet

we haue ſpokē, no nor yet your profaine writers make thereof no proofe, for before Aeſculapius, or Ipocrates, aboue 500. yeares, were Phiſitions in the world, we reade Gen. chap. 50. that Ioſeph commaūded his Phiſitiōs in Egipt, to anoint the dead body of Iacob his father, and in Exo. chap. 21. among the lawes that God gaue vnto Moyſes for his people is one, that he who hurteth his neighbour ſhall pay, what be looſeth in his worke, for the time ſpent, and alſo the coſt and hyer of the Phiſition where manifeſtly appeareth the wages and reward of the Phiſition is iuſt and of great antiquitie, and in other places of holy Scripture, we finde that Phiſitions were ordayned & knowen, as appeareth in Peralipomenon 2. Chap. 16. where king Aſſa was reprehended becauſe he called not on God in his ſickneſſe, truſting more in the Arte of the Phiſitions, in which place it is plainly called Arte and not experience, which place maketh for our purpoſe, and euen ſo are there many other moe. The Hiſtory and example of Aſclepiades, which you aledge, who was in ye time of great Pompeus, is true. And in that time began

the ſect, and maner of curing. But it was a plaine and a manifeſt deceit that he intended, becauſe he knew not how to cure by Science, as Plyny himſelfe affyrmeth: for he was an Oratour, and becauſe he gayned little by that office, he determined to make himſelfe a Phiſition, and there ſpronge that hereſy in Medecine, as other hath doone in other Artes, but as a thyng without foundation, it indured but a while, how muche more Eſclepiades made not medecyne common: but his meaning was to inuent a new Arte, and to make hymſelfe Maiſter thereof.
                     So that Gentlemen, let vs vnderſtande that experience made the Arte of Medecine, and that it is neceſſary to haue perticuler expert and learned Phiſitions, and alſo I ſay another thing which as yet hath not béene touched, and is the moſte neceſſarieſt of all, which is that ſuch men ought not only to be learned, but vertuous faithfull Chriſtians, and fearefull of God without the which no good Arte can be miniſtred, and for the abuſes and defects which Signor Iaſper hath touched, I knowe well that

ſome doo paſſe in the world, and I truely deſire the remedy of them. But I ſay not what ſuch Phiſitions are, but I declare what they all ought to be. I alſo ſay and knowe ſome that ſynneth not in their opinion in manifeſting them of their dealing, aſwell in their mallice as in theyr medecynes, but the good Phiſition will cure Chriſtianlye and plainely, and apply according to wiſedom the Medecines conuenient, he alſo knoweth what is néedefull, either in Medecine ſimple or compound, which is the chéefeſt thing that Signor Iaſper hath impugned, but not with reaſon, for although the ſimples are excellent and doo profite to mixe one with another: I ſay it is not hurtfull, for ſome vertues and properties doo helpe and temper others and that which one force could not doo: two or thrée do finiſh, for ſeldom, one humor offendeth the pacient, therefore it is to prouide for a whole & compound infirmitye, and thereto to apply compound medecine, and euen as we are compoūde of ſundry complexions and elements, euen ſo we ſtande in néede of compounde medecines, aſwell as of ſimples as in all

things we ſée plainly, in hot Countries, we myxe ſtronge wine with water, we compound thinges to make them more profitable for vs, we alſo ioyne and mixe our meates, to make them more ſauery and medicinall, to Uinegar we put oyle, & to Hunny, Sugar, all things doo ioine, temper and reſiſt, the which certainly is moſt neceſſary in medicine, and is of great effect and profit. But if in theſe things and others there be any indiſcreete Phiſitions or euill woorkemen: we ſhould not therefore reprooue ye good, nor yet the Arte, which of itſelfe is good, holye and profitable: but rather to procure that euery one be ſuch as is conuenient, and to deſire of God the ſame, vnto whom this Citty of Ciuill in my iudgment ought to giue moſte harty thanks, for the plentie of good and learned Phiſitions, which dwell in the ſame, of whō truly I preſume. But particulerly I haue had familiar conuerſation in my diſeaſes with fowre or fiue of them, and aſſuredly in them dooth conteyne ye qualities of excellent men, bothe of experience, learning and goodnes, and I haue the ſame opinion of many of the others,

and although Signor Iaſper is not contē
                        ted with onely literature and precepts: let him therfore loue, and procure iointly with them experience, and alſo Signor Iaſper, condemne not the doctrine in Phiſitions, and truſt not ſo little vnto them that you let to cure your ſelfe, whē you are ſick. But my meaning here is not of ſuch Phiſitiōs as the Ieſter tolde ye Marqueſſe Ferrara, of whom Pontanus writeth. But now here is no place to tel that tale, although it is not euill to declare, for ſuch as heretofore hath not harde therof. But ſithēce it is now late, I conclude for this day, the thing I was required to do: and the reſt ſhall remaine for another day.
                  
                  
                     Don Nunio.
                     
                        Signor Maiſter, I ſweare vnto God, that I beléeue there is no more to be ſaide, ſithence you haue ſo ſingulerly well determined the cauſe, & at the leaſt I for my part, am fully ſatiſfied, and ſhould finally profit in any further diſputation of theſe Gentlemē, to chaunge me from your ſentence, howbeit I beléeue that now they are of your iudgement, for alwaies troth is of great force

being alſo holpen by your authoritie and eloquence.
                  
                  
                     Bernardo.
                     I for my part doo holde myſelfe ſatiſfied, and doo conſent in the determination of Signor Maister, and I thinke Signor Iaſper will doo the like, and ſo we may depart as we came.
                  
                  
                     Iaſper.
                     I cannot chuſe but kéepe ſilence to the thing that Signor Maiſter hath ſayd, and the ſame ought to be moſte certaine, ſithence he hath ſo pronounced: but yet in my iudgement I thinke it not conuenient to cure with Phiſitions, but rather take diet and good Regiment to be ſufficient, yea and I haue heard them their ſelues ſay, that to cure therewith is a moſte happy cure, ſo that ſtill I will follow experience and counſell and you not able to condemne me, and for the other matters, let them paſſe in good time, as Signor Maister hath declared: and ſo we may depart, and God giue vnto your Worſhip entire health, that you neuer néede any Phiſition, but onely that you may dye of age.
                  
                  
                     Don Nunio.
                     Patience is good for aduerſytie, but yet

I wyll not that ye depart vntill Signor Maister hath tolde his tale, touching the Phiſitions of Ferrara. And with his tale Diſputation ſhall ceaſſe for this day, for it is not late, and time there is for all.
                  
                  
                     Maiſter Velaſques.
                     Becauſe, Signor Iaſper ſhall pacifie his anger, I will recite the tale, although he hath read the ſame as well as I: the Hiſtory is. That on a time, Nicholaus Marqueſſe of Ferrara, ſporting and ieſting with his Ieſter, he enquired of him of what Science or occupation were moſt number in Ferrara? the Ieſter aunſwered, ſaying ſir, the moſte in number of any one trade are Phiſitions, the Marqueſſe hearing this aunſwer, laughed him to ſcorn, ſaying, thou idiot ſéeſt yu not that of yt facultie there is not in the Citty aboue fiue or ſire, and I am ſure there is aboue 300. Shoomakers, and as many of many other Occupacions? The Ieſter aunſwered, ſir, where your Lordſhip is occupied in great matters you haue no particuler recknings, nor yet you know what nomber of Maſſailes you haue, but beléeue me ſir I haue told you troth, yt of the Art of medecin is the greateſt nūber

in Ferrara, and I dare lay 200. Ducats that you ſhall finde it ſo.
                     The Marqueſſe began to laugh againe and to deny his opinion, and in concluſion the wager was layde, although he iudged it for ſimplicity and madnes, and ſo he ſoone forgot what he had layd. But the Ieſter who had great deſire of the money that was laide, hauing well conſidered the matter: The next day in the morning he aroſe, being Sonday, and wrapped clouts about his head, & Towe and Wooll bounde to his chéekes, fayning that he was wonderfully vexed with the tootheache, and in this order he ſate him downe at the doore of the Cathedrall Church of the Cittie, and had ſitting by him a boy who was his ſonne, that had good ſkill in writing, this lad had his Pen, Inkehorne, and Paper, now the Ieſter being a man ſo commonly knowen in the Cittie, the people that entered and came out of the Church aſked of him the cauſe of his ſicknes, and he made aunſwer to euery one that he had a maruelous paine in his téeth and Gummes, deſiring them for Gods ſake to giue him ſome remedy for the ſame,

and where we generally vſe to giue coū
                        ſel to thoſe whom we ſée ſuffer any pain: as many as paſſed by tolde him what to take, although ſome one thing, and ſome another. So that his boye foorth with wrote euery mans name that had giuen any remedy, and hauing abode there the time conuenient, and his copie of names and medcines full, and in the pickle that he ſate at the Church dore: he went to the Marqueſſe Pallace, who had cleane forgottē his wager, & as the Marqueſſe eſpied him, he as other had doone, enquired the cauſe of his greefe, and being anſwered as the others were, he of gentlenes tolde him of remedy wherewith he ſhould be whole. The Ieſter ſayde ſir & kiſſe your Honours handes, and after a while that he had abode there, he went his way home to his houſe, and cauſed all his proceſſe to be writtē fayre, which amounted to néere 500. perſons, who were all Phiſitions, and the Lord Marquis was placed for the firſt and principalliſt in the copie, and euery mans medecine ioyned with his name, the next day he came to ye Lord Marqueſſe Pallace without his rags about his head, as

a whole man, ſaying, right Honourable ſir, now I am whole, and I thanke God cured by the moſte honourableſt Phiſition of all Italy, which is you, for with your good counſell I obtained my health. Therfore I pray you commaund to pay the wager: for aſſuredly for my diſeaſe I founde all theſe Phiſitions in Ferrara, that are here contayned in this memoriall, and if I would haue fought for more, iwis I had found more. The Marqueſſe beholding the roule of names and medecines, and ſéeing himſelfe the firſt man, and many other principall perſons of the Cittye, he laughed, and confeſſed that he had loſt his wager, and commaū
                        ded the ſame to be payde foorth with, which truely was a merry ieſt. So that if Signor Iaſper be contented with ſuche Phiſitions: I ſay he hath reaſon, and ſhall finde aboundaunce.
                  
                  
                     Don Nunio.
                     By my trothe the tale is pretie, and to be laughed at with reaſon. I wyll therefore ſtay you no longer, depart on Gods name.
                  
                  
                     Iaſper.
                     The Ieſter was pleaſaunt, but I promiſe

you on my faith, that if he had the tootheache in déede, he mought haue béen cured with the counſels giuen vnto him. And I would rather truſt the 500. Phiſitions contained in the memoriall, then the fiue or ſixe, which the Lord Marqueſſe ſpake of. And with this concluſion Signor Bernardo let vs depart, for although we haue béene earneſt in our Diſputation, yet we wyll depart as good fréendes as we came hether.
