in Churchyards behalfe:
               To him that hath bleared, and cried like a Calfe.
               Full well by his crying a man may now know,
               Where veale may be bought of a price very low:
               The head and the purtnaunce, with gather though ſmall,
               As cheape as a Shepes head, the hornes bought withall.
            
            
               REſtleſſe heads, I wel perceaue,
               to be acquainted ſure:
               Can raſhly fede on matters groſe
               as meate for them vnpure.
            
            
               ¶So well I doe perceaue by one,
               who hath of late take payne:
               By penned verce on high Churchyard
               to welcome home agayne.
            
            
               ¶In tauntyng wiſe (alas thou foole)
               what needed thus thy head
               To trauaile in ſuch flickeryng vearce,
               ſith all thy wits be fled?
            
            
               Doeſt thou know thou chattring Pye
               on whome thou doeſt thus rayle?
               Or haſt thou cauſe by gawled backe,
               to wag and wince thy tayle?
            
            
               ¶As no reuenge, this men accoumpt,
               to wreake thy angrie moode?
               To charge him with a vowed oth,
               for wearyng of a hoode.
            
            
               ¶Thy nature yll, doth well declare,
               thy rancour and thy ſpight:
               To heads that bare and naked are,
               yet needs not lanthorne light.
            
            
               *But canſt thou ſpare a hood in dede?
               of hoods haſt thou ſuch ſtore?
               How can thy hornes for hoods be ſene?
               huſht huſht, I ſay no more.
            
            
               Let Churchyard liue & raigne in place
               to his contented mynde,
               And ſo let euery horned beaſt
               go raunge, lyke to his kynde.
            
            
               ¶For cloughie Clem, and William to
               neede not to take more payne,
               Sith Adam Bel, for Clem of ye clough
               the monſtrous Shepe hath ſlayne.
            
            
               ¶And outlawes are (as I heare ſay)
               for this, ſo haynous deed:
               So farewell. C. with horned cap,
               good night, and eke good ſpeed.
            
            
               Thus doe I ceaſe with hoods Robin,
               now Robin Hood farewell:
               And Robinſon in Churchyards ſtede,
               ſhall weare the hood and bell.
            
            
               ¶And yf this rude and ſimple verce
               may not a warnyng bee,
               To ſtay your cockyug crakyng head
               take heed leſt that you ſee:
            
            
               The cokſcōbe knockt about your pate,
               then hoods no more wyll ſeeme
               Your hornes to hyde, but al men ſhall
               a monſter thee eſteeme.
            
            
               And as for Churchyards cūming hom
               was not of his free wyll,
               But for to pleaſe ſuch ſtats whos heſts
               may both commaund and wyll.
            
            
               ¶Thus bid I thee farewell a whyle,
               as one that keepes his pen:
               To aunſwer ſuch as ſhall preſume,
               to blea lyke Calues in den.
