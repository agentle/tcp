               Giuen vnto Christians for a loking Glasse, wherin we may behold our owne deformities. and therein and thereby, we are not onley forewarned of our destructions, but we are learned to humble our selues in these daungerous dayes of wickednesse, before the throane of Gods mercy, that wee maye be preserued from the Lake of damnation, in the great and notable day of Christs comming to iudgemente.

               warde Osbourne Knight, hir Maiesties Leiftenante, Lorde Mayor of hir Highnes most honorable Cittie London, the right Worshipfull Knight Syr Rowland Haiward, Alderman of London, the right worshipfull Mayster Iohn Spencer Alderman and Shriue of London, and the right worshipful of the fraternitie, and misterye of Clothworkers. Iohn Phillip the sonne of Robart Phillip Clothworker disceased, wisheth the feare of God, peace and prosperitie in our merciful Lord and Sauior Christ Iesus. &c.
            
               IF this small present right honorable and worshypful, rendered into your hands with all humility and reuerence, maye finde fauour in your sight, I shall not only accounte my selfe happye, but hereafter shew my selfe industerious to pleasure you wyth some other treatise, which with this shall redowne to the glory of god, your well liking, and the commodity of my natiue cuntrimen. In the meane season, I most earnestly besech your good Lordship, and euery of you, to pardon my boldnes, and to satisfie your mindes with this poore mite of mine, which to the comforte of the godly, and the reformation of the maleuolent is published, not doubting but as you are vertuous and godly affected, so

your honor and euery one of you being patrons & members of this common weale, in as much as in you shal consist, will doe your indeuors to beate down syn, whose branches are so monsterous, that they begin to ouer shade vertue, the which thing to cal vnto our memories, is a thing of al things to be lamented: who heareth not in the Gospel how diligently our wickednesses cōmitted against the maiestie of eternal God are reproued? but who or where are they that conuert and turne to the Lord in this our last time of our age and calling? no, we glory in our iniquityes and hate to be reformed, and generally to speake the truth, we I say for the most part and greatest number of vs that professe the name of Christ, are rockt and lulled in the corrupt cradle of our owne securities, and therin we slepe so soundly, that neither can the remembrance of Gods graces, signes & tokens, his greuous threat nings and terrible comminations serue, to rouse vs vp out of the dangerous and most perrilous slumber of our iniquyties, & it cannot be chosen (right Honorable and Worshipful) but that the day of our visitation is at hand, and except we repent, we shal perishe in our wickednesses, for Gods heauie indig

Thus shal you please God in discharging your dueties, and shewe your selues obedient subiects to hir excellent maiesty, that putteth you in trust to bridle the outrage of the wicked, that range as gracelesse after their vncleanesse. Thus wishing you right honorable and euery one of you the feare of god, peace and prosperitye in Iesus Christ, I leaue you to his gracious & heauenly preseruation, beseeching him of his infinite good nes, whilst his mercy holdeth his indignation at a bay, to giue vs the grace with humble and contrite hartes, to prostrate our selues before him, to craue pardon at his fatherly hands for our offences, to weepe bytterly for our sinnes, and to bring forth the fruites of repentance, thus shal we pacifie hys heauy displeasure, conuerte his fury to fauor, his
