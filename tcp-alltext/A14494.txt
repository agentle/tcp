            TO THE RIGHT NOBLE AND WORTHY KNIGHT SIR GEORGE HASTINGS, brother to the right Honorable the Earle of Huntingdon.
            
            
               SIR,
            
            
               BOoks haue euer sought out the fittest Patrons. Thinking seriously with my selfe, who might most iustly challenge the dedication of this labour at my hands, which I trust shall euer bring some light and comfort to our Grammar Schooles, I could finde none to haue thereunto a better title then your self. Sith God hath indeed made you a worthy light, for the sound loue and true aduancement of vertue and good learning, and that euen from your tender yeares. In as much as you (contrary to the course of the greatest

part of the flower of the Nobilitie and Gentrie of our age) haue addicted your selfe vnto your studies, for the good (I trust) both of the Church and Commonwealth, in stead of following the excessiue pleasures of the time; and haue moreouer in a singular maner manifested your affection towards them both, and towards all good learning to that end. Whenas out of that maintenance, which in regard of your high birth and noble line might seeme farre too little for your selfe; you haue yet separated and consecrated, as your first fruites, a portion thereof vnto the Lord, towards the maintaining of sundry poore schollers in the Vniuersitie, by whom his glorie may be aduanced, and the good of his people perpetually procured. Concerning which, let me craue pardon of you (good Sir) and beare the blame, that (though contrary to your minde) I yet still desire, as I ought, that memorable loue of yours to be knowne, for the good ensample and prouoking of many others to the like: wherein one day they should finde a thousand times more comfort, doing it with vpright hearts, then in all that

they shall bestow, not onely in the ouerhote pursuite of their vaine pleasures and delights, but euen in sundry other kindes, which make the fairest shew. As my selfe am euer bound in all places to acknowledge those great respects, which I iustly owe vnto your selfe and that right noble house for my selfe and mine, so I hope our God will enable vs to seek euermore to be answerable thereunto, as his Maiesty shall vouchsafe vs fit opportunities. What is wanting in vs, his goodnesse (I trust) will fully recompence, that you may be euer honoured, walking with him in this world, and liuing with him in blessednesse for euer in the heauens. And in this earnest desire, with my heartie prayers incessantly for you, that God may make you to increase daily in all true honour, I commend you to his heauenly grace, resting
            
               Yours euer most bounden, IOHN BRINSLEY.
            
         
         
            
            A plaine Direction to the painfull Schoolemaister and others, for the most profitable vse of this and the like Grammaticall translations.
            
               TO the end that all Schollers may find the seuerall benefites of these translations mentioned in my Grammar-schoole, not onely for sound vnderstanding, true construing, parsing, getting without booke, making and prouing the same Latin, speedy turning either into prose or verse, but also for growth in our English tongue together with the Latin; and principally for causing Schollers to study of themselues, and to prepare their lectures at home, to bring them more perfectly, and keep them more surely; and all this with very much certaintie, pleasure and ease both to maister and scholler, I finde this course most readie.
            1. Cause euery one to be well acquainted with their Grammar rules, and especially to be perfect in the rule of construing, that they may euer follow that direction.
            2. Because the greatest part in euery Forme are commonly of the duller sort of wits and more negligent, and also hardlier drawne to take paines at home, vnlesse they euidently see the way how they may do it with some delight; cause some pregnant scholler of their owne Forme, or of some higher, to reade them their lecture ouernight, onely construing it ouer once or twice, and shewing them the hard words and phrases briefly.
            3. Direct them either to trie first how they are able to construe of themselues, and finde out a reason of euery thing, why it must be so construed; and after to compare and trie that which they haue done, by the translation. On else if they haue not sufficient leisure, and that they would do it speedily, or be not so well able to do it of themselues, direct them to reade ouer the translation once or twice; first, that they may fully vnderstand the matter whereby all the construing will be made most easie, and then aduise them to examine carefully by themselues the reason of the whole construction. And so for parsing euery thing in the same order as they construe: for these two

so depend one vpon another, that they cannot be separated. In a word, cause them so to studie their lectures out of the Latine books and the translation together, that they may be able with their book vnder their arme, to deliuer and pronounce the whole lecture either Latine or English alone, so also to construe and parse without booke to deliuer their lectures either in the plaine Grammar order, or more elegantly, and so to giue varietie of phrase, and whatsoeuer is obserued in the translation.
            4. Be carefull that they take not ouermuch at a time, and then so many of them as are apt and painful, wil the next day at any time, within an houres space giuen them to meditate, be able to deliuer their lecture (so as I said) viz. pronouncing it without booke both in Latine and English▪ construe and parse without booke, giue varietie of English phrase, and whatsoeuer can be required for the vnderstanding and knowledge of euery word. Hereby also they will be able to keepe all that they haue learned, not onely to repeate each weekes worke most perfectly vpon the friday, but also their whole quarters worke at each quarters end, if they vse to repeate it now and then, and so to keepe their authors for euery vse, far more perfectly then by any other meanes.
            For these Eclogues and the booke de Apibus, I haue made choise of them to translate thus, as being the most familiar of all Virgils workes, and fittest for childrens capacities: and in some of them I haue made a plaine Analysis or resolution, for the more easie and full vnderstanding thereof, as namely of the first and last Eclogues, and so of that excellent booke of the gouernment and ordering of Bees, which is able to draw the very wisest into an admiration, for their policie, and the rare workes of God apparent in them. The resolution of the rest I haue omitted, as being for the most part but heardmens talke, or the matter not so fit, and so the translation of the latter part of the sixi Eclogue. In the first Eclogue I haue giuen a litle taste of the Rhetoricke in Tropes and figures: for the rest I referre to M. Butlers Rhetoricke, M. Far
                     •

                  mus Commentarie. The Eclogues being select Poemes, I would haue pronounced most exactly, as namely the 1. 3. 5. 7. &c. (like as Tullies Paradoxes, and some choise Orations for patternes of Theames and Orations) for that they may be most not able helps to an excellent pro
                  •
               ciation, which is a principall ornament to all

learning, and will bring the schollers much estimation with others, and delight in themselues.
            I haue onely proceeded thus farre in translating, being fully assured vpon certaine experience, that children first entred well in Grammar, and hauing gone through but those parts of the authors which I haue thus translated, will be able by Gods blessing (if they proceed in a right order) to take their lectures of themselues, at least with very litle assistance, in all the rest of Virgil and the higher Latin authors; by the meanes of the worthy Commentaries and other helpes, which the Lord hath in this last age prouided aboue all former times.
            As for that feare of making truants by these translations, which conceit arose meerly vpon the abuse of other translations, neuer intended for this end; I hope that happie experience in this kind, will in time driue it, and all like to it, vtterly out of schooles and out of the minds of all. Sith for my selfe, by the meanes hereof I finde the cleane contrary, in causing my schollers to giue a reason of euery thing why it must be so, and also almost double profit to that which I could otherwise. And finally for that I can hereby teach many
                  •
                then I could without, and cause euery one of them which are any thing diligent and apt, to render an account of that which he learnes from quarter to quarter continually; and all with much ease and pleasure to my selfe, delight and contention among themselues, and great contentation to their friends. Trie aright, and then giue your sentence. The comforts which my selfe haue found herein, without any of the furnised inconueniences, and the same approued and confirmed by many learned, do make me confident to desire to commend them to all. For all other obiections I haue answered thē at 
                  〈◊〉
                in my Grammar schoole. Experience, I trust, will fully satisfie all sorts in time. Though the slips in this as in the rest, be very many, the difficultie of the labour to obserue duly all the directions, both for Grā

Whereunto crauing thy loue and prayers, I

                  THE ARGVMENT.
                  
                     COrnelius Gallus was A choise Poet. an excellent Poet, and the first President or Lieutenant. gouernour of Egypt, who when as He was euen mad with the loue of Cytheris an harlot or where. he Desperately or outragiously loued. out of measure affected an harlot called Cytheris,

                     Neither she answered his mutuall loue, [viz. loued him not againe. and she answered not [his] mutuall loue, But he being despised▪ she had followed Anthonie into France, [viz. Anthonies armie. but despising him followed Anthonie into France; He is beleeued, or credibly reported. is thought to haue taken that repulse most grieuously. Whereupon. Therefore Virgil comforts him in this Eclogue, but yet so, as that he doth not depart

from pastorall persons and Vplandish, rurall, homely, or taken from matters of the countrey. rusticall comparisons. And also this whole. All this argument likewise is almost taken out of The first Idy

               In this Eclogue the Poet himselfe is the onely speaker, though he after seeme to bring in Gallus comforting himselfe that the Arcadians should sing of his loues.
               
                  The Poet in this last pastoral being to celebrate the memory of another famous Poet called Cornelius Gallus, inuocates the Nymphs of Syracusa to help him 
                  Oh Arethusa. ONymph of the fountaine Arethusa is a fountaine of sweete water of Syracusa, where Theocritus liued. Whereby he meaneth the Muses of Syracusa and of Theocritus, whom he inuocates to helpe him therein.] Arethuse, grant me this last labour.

                  The fountaine Arethuse is numbred among the wonders of waters, that it hauing the head in Peloponnesus is thought to run maruellous farre vnder the sea, and to breake soorth againe at this fountaine.

                  Here first begins the proposition of the Eclogue, wherin the Poet stirres vp himselfe and his Muse to sing some songs of Gallus and his carefull loues. And this from the time and his leisure, and also from the audience which they should haue. 
                  [O Nymph] begin, let vs speake of [or report] the carefull loues of Gallus. Begin, let vs record the carefull loues of Gallus.

               We sing not to the deafe, the woods Do answer all things [by their eccho, or by other shepheards.] do answer euery thing.
               
                  Secondly, he accuseth the Muses that they were so carelesse of Gallus, to let him so to leaue his studies, and to perish in such vnbeseeming loue, that they could not be found to reclaime or pitie him, no not in any hill, nor about any fountaine.

                     Who comforts Gallus as Apollo did, rebuking him louingly: That sorrow was no meanes to cure loue, but the more he wept, the more he might. And this he illustrates by three similitudes or arguments à pari. That as grasse cannot be satisfied by riuers running by, nor bees with the flower of Cythisus, nor goates with tender sprigs of trees, so nor loue with teares.

                     First, that the Arcadians the onely skilfull musitians of the world, should record his loues, and then how sweetly his bones should rest thereby.

And I do wish I hadSecondly, that Gallus detesting his owne estate, wisheth that he had bene a countreyman, either a shepherd or a dresser of vines, for the delights and companie which such haue to sport withall, as of Phillis and Amyntas. That although Amyntas was blacke, yet so are violets and bramble berries also. bene one of you, and either A keeper. a tender of your flocke, or A gatherer of your ripe grapes, [viz. a dresser of your vines. a gatherer of [your] ripe grapes.

As coole fountaines, sweet medowes and woods.

                  Here Virgil speakes himselfe, and concludeth this Eclogue with an Apostrophe and inuocation of the Muses, that Gallus might accept of his homely verse; that the Muses themselues wold make these verses meete for Gallus, whilst

                  And thence he laboureth to expresse his loue to Gallus, how his loue towards him did increase continually; & this by an argument à pari. That is increased as much each houre, as the alder trees shootes foorth in the prime of the Spring. To Gallus [I say]

                  The loue of whom increaseth so much to me in houres, [viz. euerie houre.] whose loue growes so much in mee euerie houre,

                  Afterward taketh occasion to end this Eclogue from the danger of the place where he sat, viz. vnder a iuniper tree, the shadow whereof is especially hurtfull, as the shadows of all trees are to things growing vnder them, and therfore he should arise. Let vs arise: the shade is wont to be Grieuous to [men] singing, [viz. to shepheards when they sing, lying vnder the shadowes of trees.] noisome vnto them that sing;

                  And finally he shuts vp all by turning his speech vnto his goates, that they might now go home, both being full, and the euening starre now shewing it selfe.

And also the hiues themselues, Whether [they shall be] sowed to them with hollowed barks, [viz. whether you shall make them of barkes of trees sewed together,] or whether they shall be wouen with a limber twig [or ozier] viz. made of rods. whetherFirst, for the matter, that they be made of hollow barks sewed together, or of rods or twigs. you haue them sewed [and made] with hollow barks, or wouen with limberSecondly, for the entrance

               After he proceedeth to giue warning of such things as are noisome to the hiues, like as he had before for the bee-gardens: as that the good husband should not suffer yough trees to grow too neare them; nor to burne the shels of sea-crabs neare vnto them: nor to let them stand ouer neare to deepe fens or standing waters.

               Here now followeth a third precept concerning the worke of the Bees in the Spring and in the Summer time. Where first the Poet describes the Spring by the efficient cause of it, to wit, the Sunne, viz. when the Sunne coming nearer vnto vs, hath with his light chased away the Winter, and begins to bring the Summer; that then the bees trauell forthwith far and neare thorough forrests and woods, and all other places where they may gather their prouision. That which remains [is this] [that] when the golden Sunne hath chased away the Winter driuen Vnto the Antipodes, where it is Winter when it is Summer with vs. vnder the earth, and The image of the voice offended leapes backe [viz. where there is a great Eccho, which comes by the beating backe of the voice. hath again set open the skie with Summer light,
            
               The [bees] presently passe through vplands or launds. They forthwith trauell through forrests and woods,

               Afterwards vpon this occasion of their flying abroad, he cometh to a fourth precept, for the retaining of their swarmes with sweete smels of herbes, and with sounds. Hence whenas Behold, [or marke it well:] for] they. you shall behold a swarme sent forth euen now out of their hiues vnto the skies, to waue through the cleare Summer aire;That when the keepers of them see a great swarme of them gathered like a cloud, and wauing in the skie, they then seeke waters, and a new house amongst the boughes of trees.

This is an herbe wherewith bees are delighted. and houses among the boughes of trees.Therefore to the end that they may settle, they are to sprinkle the places with the vsuall iuyces of certain herbs, as of balme, honysuccles, and the like; or to rub them with those herbes, and withall to ring or tinkle with basons, cimbals, and other such like sounding things, to keepe them from flying quite away. To this end sprinkle the Wonted or vsuall. appointed iuyces:

               And hence he proceedeth to a fifth precept, concerning the battels of the bees, which he setteth out by a principall cause thereof, and by signes. The chiefe cause is discord arising betweene the kings or maisterbees.

            For why, some of them Being filthy [or foule] are vgly and lothsome. are rough and illfauoured, like as when a Drie with thirst. thirstie Passenger, or wayfaring man. traueller comes out of the deepe dust, and spits vpō the ground With his mouth being drie [with thirst and dust.] with [his] drie mouth: Others are of a cleare and bright shining colour. others do shine and glister with cleare brightnesse,The other sort of them shines and glisters with a cleare brightnesse like gold:

               Here likewise is interposed the age of bees, and how long they liue. 
               Therefore albeit the terme of a narrow age receiue them, [viz. although the age of bees be but short.] Therefore althoughThat they liue but a small time, not aboue seuen yeares commonly, (which is much too, considering their industrie,) yet their stocke (if they be well looked to) and so the prosperous state and honour of their houses remains almost immortall [viz. for many yeares] that the owners of them may recken the grandfathers & great grandsires of them. the compasse of a small age entertaines them, (For neither more then a seuenth Summer is led of them. for they do not liue aboue seuen yeares,)

               Vnto the natures of the bees, the Poet addeth here their obseruance and honour towards their kings: which he illustrates by comparisons frō some dissimilitudes and sundrie effects. The dissimilitudes are these: that neither the Egyptians, Lydians, Parthians, Medes, nor Indians, are so obseruant & carefull for their king, as the bees are for theirs. Moreouer The people of Egypt and of Lydia.

               Hence the Poet sheweth, that by these obseruations of their gouernment, and these former signes of their wisedome, some haue thought that bees haue reason and some part of diuine vnderstanding. 
               Certaine men haue said by these signes, and following these examples, there to be a part of the diuine mind and airie breaths in bees. Some by these signes, and following these examples, haue said that there is a part of the diuine vnderstanding and Draughts from the firmament [or diuine draughts] viz. such spirits as they draw from heauen. also heauenly spirits in bees: for why [they say] God to go through all, [viz. that God is a spirit, and i
