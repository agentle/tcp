               THE Notable Hyſtory of two faithfull Louers named Alfagus anb Archelaus. Whearein is declared the true fygure of Amytie and Freyndſhyp. Much pleaſaunte and delectable to the Reader.
            Tranſlated into Engliſh meeter by Edwarde Ienynges. With a Preface or Definytion of Freyndſhyppe to the ſame.
            
               ¶ Such as are troubled in Publyque afayres,
               About common welthes by offyces and cares:
               In faythfull freindſhyp can neuer abyde,
               For ſo ſayth Tully the thinge hath ben tryde.

                  THe wyes Phyloſopher Aryſtoetell doth ſaie,
               Freindſhip is a vertue moſt incomparable,
               And Tully doth his wordes not denaye,
               Sayenge it is a thinge moſt commendable:
               Both fyrme and ſure, nothing deceyuable
               For freinſhip with out vertue in no man can remaine
               Thus the wyſe Phyloſopher Tully telleth plaine.
            
            
               ¶ Tully defyneth freindſhip on this wiſe alſo
               Sayenge it is none other thing at all
               But a perfecte conſent of thinges for to kno
               Whych as well to God as to men doth befall,
               Beneuolence and charitie imbraced of great and ſmall
               Nothing is more comodious while men on earth do liue
               Then this except ſapience which God to man doth giue.
            
            
               ¶ Then which definicion is excelent and true
               For in God and all thinges which of God doth come
               Nothing of more eſtemacion doth enſue
               Then Loue called in latin Amoi all and ſome,
               
                  Amicitia deſending and coming of Eum
               
               In engliſh called Freindſhip which taken a waie
               The life of man wyll ſoone fall in decaie.
            
            
               ¶ No houſe can ſtand in quiet peace and reſte
               No feilde can bringe his fruyte in due ſeaſon
               If hatred and enuie doth dwell both Eaſt and Weſte,
               All men may iudge then parfectly by reaſon
               Fynally of man is iudged by diſcretion
               He ſemeth from the worlde to take a way the ſume,
               That from mans life wold freindſhip daue vndon.
            
            
               
               ¶ Syth frendſhyp then to mans lyfe is ſo pure
               Then all other vertues it doth far excell.
               And onely in good men remaines, thys is ſure,
               From whoſe harte and mynde no paine maie excell:
               But fyrmly and ſure within them doth dwell,
               So that therof none euyll may proceede
               Ne cauſe of thynge which euyll is in deede.
            
            
               ¶ Betweene all men that be good can not be Amitie
               Alwayes abydynge without ſome decente,
               Except they ſeme both of on quallitie,
               Fourmed all a lyke by natures pretence:
               In maners and ſtudy both equally bente,
               And ſpecyally in maners, for that is the thynge
               Whych knytteth the hartes both of one lykinge.
            
            
               ¶ For Grauytye and Affabylytie be laudable both
               And qualyties highlye to be had in eſte macyon,
               So is Seuerytie and Placabylytie forſooth
               Magnyfycence and Lyberalytie is of the ſame faſſion
               And yet Frugalitie by all wyſe mens Oracyon
               Which ſhoweth a lyfe both moderate and ſober,
               Is hygher extolled then any of the other.
            
            
               ¶ Yet wheare theſe vertues and qualyties bee
               Seperately a ſundre amongſt perſones manye,
               Aſſembled together by tranquilitie
               May well be parfecte concorde trulie,
               
                  
                     •…
                  t freyndſhyp is there ſildome verelye,
               
                  
                     •…
                  or that which the one for a vertue imbraceth,
               The other contemninge his minde, it neglecteth.
            
            
               And there wheare deſcenſion of mindes doth appere
               By reaſon can ſtande no parfecte Amytie,
               Syth freindſhip is a conſent entyre,
               Of will and deſires in one like quantytie:
               Therfore is ſyldome ſeene for a certeinty,
               That freyndſhyp betweene ſuch parſons ſhould bee,
               Whych in theyr deſyres can nothinge agree.
            
            
               
               ¶ Thoſe which be liberall of harte and deede
               Withholoyng nothinge from them whom they loue
               Whearby increaſe of loue doth proceede,
               And in them that be conſtante and wyll not remoue
                     •
                  
               
               Is neuer myſtruſte nor ſuſpection to proue,
               Ne anye ſurmyſynge of euill reporte
               Can drawe theyr affection from them in any ſorte.
            
            
               ¶ And by this thinge is freindſhip made ſure
               Parpetually for euer both firme and ſtable,
               But if like ſtudye or learnynge procure
               Theyr mindes in one thinge to be delectable:
               Joyeing to thoſe vertues agreable,
               Freindſhip much rather doth happen to ſtande
               By mutuall agrement with faithfull bande.
            
            
               ¶ Nothinge euill or vycious to man
               In faithfull freindſhip doth happen to bee,
               The firſt election made of freindes than
               Receueth all the importaunce truely,
               Wherfore it wolde be done nothing raſhely,
               But with a longe proofe and great deliberacion
               Deſeruyng parfectly his former trade and faſhyon.
            
            
               ¶ For oft times by fortune it comith to paſſe
               A man now in welthe and great proſperytie,
               Is brought in a momit much worſſe then he was
               Standinge in peryll and great extremytie:
               Freyndſhyp oft times then faileth verely
               As Ouy
                     •
                  es ſweete ſentence to vs doth declare
               Hereafter folowyng with wordes good and fayre.
            
            
               ¶ Whylſte fortune thee fauoreth, freindes thou haſt plenty
               The time being troublous thou art alone,
               And Culuere haunt houſes made whyte and dayntie
               To the ruonous Lowers almoſt commeth none:
               Of Emotes innumerable, vnneth thou findeſt one
               In emptie barnes wheare fayleth ſubſtaunce,
               Happeneth no freinde in whom is aſſurance.
            
            
               
               ¶ But if amonge manie one chuſe to be found
               In all cares of fortune hys freyndſhyp to holde,
               The prayſe of hys nane ſhall highly rebounde
               And is more of valew then ſyluer or golde,
               Or any comodytie that els can be tolde,
               Of kyndred and blood none is ſo cōmendable
               As one parfecte freynde in nothynge deceyuable.
            
            
               ¶ For Tully ſaith from kyndred and lyne
               Beneuolence may ſoone be taken awaye,
               But freyndſhyp whych neuer at naught doth repine
               Can neuer be ſeuered by night nor by daye:
               So though beneuolence in kindred doth ſtaye,
               Yet the name of kindred doth alwayes ſtand ſtyll
               But take it from freindſhyp and cleane it doth ſpyll.
            
            
               ¶ I am not able of freindſhyp to ſhowe
               A true definycyon in euery thinge,
               Though all a whole yere my wyt I beſtowe
               In ſuch like ſentences ſtill wrytinge,
               With manie auncient Hyſtoryes ſearchynge
               Whearin I ſhulde fynde ſuch ſtoore to indyte
               That in a large booke I ſcarce coulde them write.
            
            
               ¶ But gentle Reader I praie you haue pacience
               In this malabour not worthy of praiſe,
               Acceptinge well my mynde and dillygence,
               Occupyenge my pen thus on many idle daies:
               Wherby ſome profit doth come manie waies,
               For vnto all men it ſhoweth the vertue
               Of amytie and freyndſhyp parfecte and true.
            
            
               ¶ Many yonge wyts deſyre for to read
               Heſtoryes oide, in Mecter delectable,
               Of dyuers good Knyghtes and ſuch as be dead,
               Leauyng behynde them a fame much commendable,
               Yet is the readynge therof nothinge profitable,
               But in this ſmall treatice a man maie beholde,
               How freyndſhyp is better then ſyluer or golde.
            
            
               
               ¶ The vertue of freindſhyp in this ſhalbe ſeene
               Betweene two parſons moſt worthy of fame,
               More truer in freinſhip hath neuer none bene
               Then theſe Alfagus and Archelaus by name:
               Many yeres lyuynge wythout anie blame,
               The one of Rome, of Carthage the other
               Lyuing more truly then brother and brother.
            
            
               ¶ And vnto God with all my harte I praye
               That by this treatice ſome may enſample take
               To learne to kepe theyr freinſhip night and daie,
               When to theyr freindes lyke yromyſe they do make:
               In wealth and wo them neuer to forſake,
               But now a daies I fere but few men do lyue
               That will vnto theyr freyndes ſuch freinſhyp gyue.
            
            
               ¶ And thus concludinge my ſimple Preface
               Moſt hartely I pray the Readers all,
               If in this booke parhaps by my treſpaſſe

            Cap. i.
            
               
                  IN Rome ſumfyme a Knyghte dyd dwell,
               Both noble, wiſe and good.
               Hys ſtocke of auncyente Romaynes were,
               And not of Raſcall blood:
               Lypodus hyghte thys noble man
               for ſo mem dyd hym call,
               Beloued he was of all folkes in
               the Cyttie, great and ſmall.
            
            
               ¶ A Ladye had thys noble Knighte
               of worthy ſtocke and fame,
               Betweene whom God a ſonne dyd ſende
               Alfagus was hys name:
               Acomely Chylde and fayre he was
               as any man myght ſee,
               In learnyng apte to euery thynge
               whych taught to hym myght bee.
            
            
               ¶ This knight therfore when as his ſonne
               to lawefull yeres ded growe,
               He thought how he by vertuous trade
               myght make hym wyſdome knowe:
               
                  
But at the laſte by muſynge longe
               he vnderſtood right well,
               Of Carthagye that noble place
               much praiſe he harde men tell.
            
            
               ¶ How that was cheefe and fountayne of
               all wiſdome and all grace,
               Next vnto God all prudence came
               and doctrine from that place:
               And noble men from far aboute
               theyr Chyldren thether ſent,
               And Lypodus this knight therfore
               euen of the ſame intent.
            
            
               ¶ His ſonne Alfagus brought foorth with
               to Carthagye, that hee,
               Myght lerne good letters and alſo
               a Scholler there to bee:
               And hoſted him with one who was
               an auncyent man and wiſe,
               A Senatour of the Cittie who
               good councell dyd deuyſe.
            
            
               ¶ Of Carthagie that noble place
               and Cyttie of great fame,
               The cheifeſt ruler then was hee
               and Olympus was hys name:
               Thys Olympus had a ſonne alſo
               whom Archelaus men dyd call,
               In euery parte both hande and face
               like Alfagus was hee all.
            
            
               
               ¶ Theyr age was equall both as one
               agreeinge iuſt and ryght,
               Theyr faces ſo proporſhined both
               a lyke in all mens ſight:
               That no man coulde deſerne the one
               and ſay this is the other,
               They were not knowē but by their names
               of father nor of mother.
            
            
               ¶ And as theſe two yonge gentlemen
               agreid lyke in lymme,
               Alfagus Archelaus vnto
               and Archelaus to him:
               So in ſhorte ſpace acquayntaunte grewe
               the one ſo to the other,
               That inwarde loue opreſt theyr hartes
               and eche one called brother.
            
            
               ¶ Theyr willes and Appetites both in one
               ſo God had congulated,
               That neuer ſince the worlde began
               like them was none created:
               At one time they together went
               to ſtudy and to learnynge,
               At one time they at meales alſo
               tooke both a lyke refreſſhynge.
            
            
               ¶ They both delyted in one kynde
               of doctryne, and therby
               They profyted and were therwith
               both learned equally,
               
                  
And to conclude, together they

               AFter the counſayle of his freindes

And ſayde fayre Lady is your mynde
               to haue me for your make,
               And can you fynde within your hart

               how ſay you Lady bryght?
               Shee aunſwered hym, (& ſayd) for ſooth
               all that is in my might,
               I am content to do your mynde
               my hartes deſyre is ſo,
               And thus when they had talked longe
               and eche theyr loue dyd knew.

               to Alfagus hys freinde,
               No loue of Lady in the worlde
               myght take hym from hys mynde:
               Yet often tymes when to ſtudy they
               together both dyd go,
               Many times Archelaus when
               Alfagus dyd not know.
            
            
               ¶ Stale ſecretly away, and to
               hys Lady did reſorte,
               That he with her in paſtyme good
               myght make ſome pleaſaunt ſport:
               And not withſtandyng the great loue
               whych to hys freynd he bare,
               Yet ofte tymes to hys Lady he
               on this wyſe dyd repayre.

               ſurmounted in his breſt,
               Wythin his harte he coulde not haue

               his woordes foorthwith did place:
               Why friende Alfagus at your harte
               is this ſame all the greefe?
               And had you thought within your harte

               but in your hatte it bare:
               Alas why keepe you of ſo long

               ¶ I do confeſſe my folly here
               wherwith I am attaynte,
               You haue diſcloſed my fond wyt
               to me in your complaynt:
               For ſhewynge vnto you the mayde

               ¶ Nor how our myndes and apetytes
               in all thynges doth agree,
               Nor yet the vnytie of our hartes,
               remembred was of mee:
               Wherfore it is no man but I
               which hath done all this ill,
               Surelye I can not well excuſe

               haue treſpaſſed at all,
               When wyth the mutable darte of loue
               your harte was ſtrooke wyth all:
               
                  
Why thynke you I am ſuch a foole
               which can not vnderſtande,

               the vyolent courſe of care,
               To preſſe the harte oportunatlye
               with panges ſhee doth not ſpare:
               Haue not you well ceſyſted when
               to death you are neere brought:
               And thus in tormentes for to ſlake,
               that apetyte you haue ſought.

               may I requyre then,
               More faythfull loue in all the worlde
               hath neuer ben of men:
               And ſhould I ſeeke for to expell
               that thyng which god hath wrought
               Seth ſhe, predeſtinate was to you
               before I of her thought.
            
            
               ¶ If I ſhould ſo thynke of this thynge
               my wyt were ſpent in vayne,
               What were my ſtudye all my lyfe
               but foolyſhe and no gayne:
               Shoulde I ſeeke for the prudent Arte
               Phyloſophye to knowe,
               Nay, nay, Alfagus in my harte
               let neuer god do ſo.
            
            
               
               ¶ But ſurely I confeſſe in deede
               to loue the mayde as well,
               As any man poſſyble may
               which wyſdomes arte can tell:
               And tooke more pleaſure in my harte
               berbeutye to beholde,
               Then in my landes my father lefte
               my ſyluer or my goulde.
            
            
               ¶ The which you know doth much aboūd
               in vallue for to be,
               Yet at my harte they are not halfe
               ſo pleaſaunt vnto me:
               But now I know within your hart
               her loue ſurmouuteth more,
               Then fiue tymes it hath done in me
               of all the tyme before.
            
            
               ¶ Yea without meaſure in your harte
               I know the darte doth ſtinge
               Of ragyng loue but ſhould I thinke
               that were wanton luſtyng:

               Then to this whom he dyd not fyrſte
               agree with contentacion:

               was clad in ſuch araye,
               In which full poorelye he had gone
               and traueyled nyght and daye:
               Wherfore to tarry thear beſydes
               he held it for the beſt,
               And ſo he ſet him downe a whyle

               and as he dyd deuyſe,

               he made no longe delay,

               departed with all ſpeede,
               And tydynges to the Cytie came
               of this his cruell deede:

               Complaynyng of his fortune then

               how terryble is the greefe.
            
            
               ¶ But when Archelaus ſawe hys freinde
               Alfagus to relent,
               And inwardly with doulfull teares
               his neclygence repente:
               Moſte louyngly imbraced hym,
               and ſayde my freynde be ſtyll,
               Leaue of your ſorowfull ſyghes ye make
               your vyſage for to ſpyll.

               no man may call agayne,
               Why hurte you now your ſelfe therfore
               and weepe with greuous payne:
               I knowe ryght well no faulte in you
               in this thynge was at all,
               But my owne neclygence cauſeth moſte
               of this vnluckye fall.
            
            
               ¶ For if my wyt had byn ſo good

               But ſyth the thynge is paſte of it
               to talke it is but vayne.

You ſhall haue all the ayde and helpe
