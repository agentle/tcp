Saynt Paule helyd syk folk /

to whō the spyryte answeryd:
I know Iesu and Paule, but
what ar ye? and so greuously

assawtyng them he preuayled
agaynste theyr presumpsyon.
The aged prophet of Bethell,
by whose dysceyte the man of

               Furthermore all suche
as occupy inchaūtmentis, coniurers,
& wytches, in theyr busynes
wyth many cerymonies
reherse the worde of god Also
our sauyour cryste sayth that
many shall come in hys name
sayng: I am Cryste, and they
shall dysceue many / but how?
surely in perswadynge yt theyr
doctrine ys goddys word / and
that they be hys messengers,
hys anoyntyd sonnys and specyall
prophetes. So dyd Symon
Magus delude the peple
of Samary, affermynge yt he
was Cryste. Lyke wyse Machomete
namyd hym selfe the

great prophete of god. And all
othere heretykys comenly in
fortefyenge theyr abhomynable
heresyes, allege the worde
of god & euangelyke veryte,
according as Martyn Luther
wyth the hole rable of hys adherētes
do dayly practyse. But
what auayleth yt to recyte the
worde of god, yf we interprete
yt by a false peruertyd sence?
what auauntage ys yt to say
Lord Lorde, and do not as he
comaūdyth vs? He yt saythe I
knowe god, and obserueth not
hys commaundementys / ys
a lyer, and there ys no trothe
in hym. The pharyseys dyicyples
sayd to Cryste: Mayster
we knowe yt thou arte a trewe
speaker, & thou teachest ye way
of god in trothe / yet thought

they nothynge so in theyr hartes▪
what thyng ys more easy
for these new teachers, thā in
blasynge theyr auctoryte / to
say that theyr doctryne ys the
trewe worde of god, and that
they haue hys spyryte: where
as they admitt no interpretacion
of scripture but theyr own / 
in so moche that they reiecte
parte of the byble because yt
seruyth not to theyr purpose.
Concernyng ye determynacyō
of generall councellys, & auctoryte
of auncyente doctours
of the churche / they vtterly cō
               temne,
except in few thynges
whereowt they gather sentē

               ly deprauyd
& othere whyle changed clene
contrary to the auctoures intent / 
they make to serue in colourynge

theyr heresye. How
shall wee then knowe whether
they be the ryght preachers, &
theyre doctryne the worde of
god or no? Trewly Cryste geuyth
vs a rule infallyble, sayenge:
By theyr frutes ye shall
knowe theym. A good tree can
brynge forthe no euyll frute,
nor a badde tree cane brynge
forthe no good frute. And they
whych here the worde of god
wyth an ernest and good hart / 
they holde yt faste, bryngynge
forthe frute in pacyence
                  •
                Also
saynt Iames descrybynge the
expedyent condycyon of crystē
prechers and heuenly lernyng
sayth: who that amonge you
ys wyse endued wyth cōming / 
lette hym shew hys good workes
out of a good conuersaciō
               
wyth softenes of wysdome. If
ye haue sower hatred and varyaunce
amonge you in youre
harte / wyll not ye reioyce & belyers
agaynste the trothe? for
thys ys not the wysdome comyng
frō aboue, but yerthly,
bestyall & deuelysh. where as
ys enmyte & contencyon / there
is incōstancy and all noughty
doyng. The wysdome yt descē
               dyth
from god ys furst chaste,
and so peasable / mylde, treatable,
full of mercy and good frutys,
wythout any mysdemyng
or dyssymulacyon. Now to
compare these frutys vnto the
actys of these Lutheran faccyons / 
ye shall finde a farre differe
                  •
               ce.
wherfore seyng that by
longe experyence I haue perc
                  •
               yuyd
the fassion, maner, and

order of all statys among thē,
& was no small whyle conuersaunt
wyth those whych are of
hyest reputaciō, both for theyr
sobernes of lyfe and fame of lyterature:
I haue thoght yt necessary
for the discharge of my
conscyence, & informacyon of
other / playnly to shew the veryte
as I haue knowen, wythout
hatred of them or fauoure
of any other ꝑsons: whych to
ꝑforme I haue here cōpylyd
thys lytle processe folowyng,
vnder the forme of a brefe dyaloge.
wherein though ye shall
rede some thyngys so strange
for the enormytees of them, ye
diuers men, namely the fauourers
of these sectys, wyll iudge
them vnlykely of trouthe, and
halfe impossyble to be vsyd amōg

resonable people endued
wyth any wysdome or lernīg:
yet are they matter in dede, accordyng
as ye shall see vnfaynydly
declared. And be ye full
assured that I reherse not by a
great parte all the abusys manyfestly
knowen by thē / nor so
many as I coud shew: which
god wyllyng hereafter in proces
of tyme may be dysclosyd
more largely. A great occasyon
why yt many be so feruēt
in fauouryng thys Lutherane
doctryne / ys the vayn prayses
of much people comyng from

               n
                  •
               e, reporting that there is
so good order, such charytable
lyberalyte, and euangelyke cō
               uersacyon,
whych ys all to gether
false. And dyuers of such
tydyng cariers, lest they might

seme ignorante in a few thyngys / 
they frame theym selfys
wythowt shame to lye in many.
It ys harde for a renegate
frere, a faythelesse apostata, a
forlorne copeman, a marchaū
               tys
prētyce, or ā embassatours
hostler / hauyng lytle lernyng,
lesse dyscressyon, small deuocyon,
and scant a curtesy of wysdome:
to make trew report in
such matters. And yet ar there
of them which make thē selfys
full besy / and ar as redy to tell
that they know not as yt that
they know accordyng as they
fele theyr affeccyons desposyd
whom they couet to please: by
whyche meanes they attayne
hye cōmendaciōs, made much
of, & ar callyd prety wyse mē &
proꝑ ꝑsōs, wyth many godd

blessyngys vppon theyr hartys.
Such ys the madnes of ye
world and folysh appetytys of
people, p̄ferryng theyr corrupt
affeccyons before ryghte iugemēt
and testymony of theyr
conscyence. Trothe yt is that
ye Germayns of old antiquite,
haue deserued specyall lawde
for theyr playnes in word and
dede voyd of dyssymulacyon,
& for theyr homely famylyaryte
wythout accepciō of ꝑsons / 
in whyche vnto thys day they
excell other nacyōs: wherof ye
originall cause many falsly do
ascrybe to thys Lutheran doctryne,
beyng dowtlesse meruelously
decayd through yt / so ye
trew playnesse was not wont
to be so scace there among scāt
good liuers, as frawdis begin

now to be plenty among theyr
new gospellers. wherefore
(crysten reders) I exhorte you
all ꝑcyalyte sett a parte / to fyx
your selfe vppon the lyuynge
worde of god whych may saue
your sowlys, and walk dyrectly
after yt / bowyng nother on
the one syde nor on the other.
I mene not that fleshly word
nor theyr gospell whych say:
ye haue no fre will, your good
deedys shall not saue you, nor
youryll dedys shall not dāpne
you, ye sacramentys of ye chirch
be nothing of necessite, ye nede
not to be confessyd to a preest,
ye are not bownde to obey the
lawes of ye chyrch &c. but that
trew worde of god & very gospell
of our sauyour Cryste / of
whose furste sermon the antetheme

was thys: Doo ye penaūce
for ye kyngdome of god
ys at hande. And at hys laste

               ermyd ye same, sayenge yt in

synnes: whych maner of preachyng
the apostles after his assencyon
obseruyd, cōtynually
exhortyng the people vnto penaūce
and to the drede of god / 
whyche ys the begynnynge of
wysdome, the inseperable companyon
of penaunce, & necessary
introduccyon to fayth. The
worde of god bryngyth forthe
penāce / accordyng as we rede
in the actes of thapostles .
                  •

Thys vnfayned penaunce leadyth
men to faythe, and is the
ētre to the gospell. Mar. 1. Do
ye penaunce sayth Cryste, and
beleue ye gospell. whych belefe
can not be attayned wythoute

fulnes of scyence / whereby we
cōe downe fyrst to know oureself / 
& so ascēd to ye knowlege

through heryng fayth taketh
her effect. The maiestie of goddis

in whose commendacyon it is
writen there, Actorum. 10. that he

               o I shew you great
ioy yt shall be to all people,
for there is borne a sauyoure
whych is Cryste our lorde. In
Exodo it is wryten . 14. the people
feared god, and so be leued
hym & hys seruaunt Moyses.

And they yt drede god saythe
the wyseman / shall not be vnfaythefull

Lyke as Martyn Luther in ye

for to go vnto my purpose,
ye shall vnderstande that this
Martyne Luther cheefe captayn
of new heretykes, & bringer
forth of old heresies / was

a frere augustyne in the cite of
wyttenberge, vnder ye dominion
of Frederyke duke of Saxony.
which duke opteyned a
perdon from Rome for the byldīg
of a certayne college there
within his own pallace, wherof
Martyn Luther was a great
setter forwarde / vntyll the
tyme that thyder came a Iubelye
from the pope, dysanullyng
the dukes perdon amōg
other for a season: wherwith
Martyn Luther not a lytle offended, endeuoured hym selfe
to preche agaynst it. And sone
after he putt forthe in prynt a
treatyse De indulgentiis, inueyng
agaynst the graunt of ꝑdons:
how be it so closely, yt he was
supposed not to haue condemned
the auctoryte but onely ye
                  
abuse / whych to say the trothe
was to farre owt of frame in

in hand to preche ye playn textes
of scrypture / dysclosynge

detectyng ye fautys of all estates
bothe hyghe & lowe, spyrytuall
and temporall / vnder
suche moderacyon yt he was
taken for a prophete of god amonge
them / & grewe in estymacyō
of ye peple dayly more

he pretendyd to take no parte
wyth any secte other faccyon
of heretikes, as wicklyf, Hus,
Berengarius, & suche other
whom he vtterly cōdemnyd / 
dyssalowing the Boemes because
they seꝑatyd thē selftys

cōstantly affermyng the pope
to be Crystys vycarye. Thus
he playd ye woolfe in a lābys

bewraid what he was in effect
For shortely after he alteryd
his mynde & reuokyd yt he had
spoken before / wysshēg all his
bookys that were empryntyd
to be burnyd & vtterly destroyd.
Then begane he stowtly to
fortefy his feyned fayth voyde
of good workys / perswadyng
lybertye and assuraūce of saluacyō / 
to ye defacynge of charytable
dedes and suppressyō

where as he had wytnessyde

Also the outragyous treatyse
that he wrote agaynst the kynges
hyghenes both in latyn &

that it is not onely condemned
of good men / but also
abhorred of hys owne adherē
                  tes.

because the occasyon
of yt was layde to his charge

to shyft hym selfe from suspicion

he wrote hastely a boke voyde

now a lyfe in farre greater mysery
& calamyte than euer they
were afore. After thys fell a
dissencyō betwene M. Luther
and Carolstadius aboute the
sacramente of the altare. For
Carolstadius denyeth in it the
bodely presence of Christe / affyrmynge
that when he spack
thes wordes: Hoc est corpus meum,
he meant thē of his owne corporall
bodye and not of the sacramēt:
where as M. Luther
holdeth the contrarye / all beyt

he beganne to fall from yt as
his owne wrytynge testifieth,
had he not ben 
                     •
                  uētyd by this
Carolstadius / whom the wycked
arrogaūcy of his stomake
could not suffer to be auctour
of so hye an heresie, wherof he
couetyd hym selfe to haue ben
father. This variaunce endurynge
betwyxe them: dyuers
forsoke M. Luther & leanyd
to Carolstadius syde / & many
malicious letters fraudulētly
forged were conueyde frome
the one to the other wyth calū

prechynges / ye & when
they met to gether, more redy
wyth fystes than wyth pacyēt
argumētes to trye theyr cause
had they not bene sonderyd.
Not wythstange through fauour
of the duke and other valyaūte

frendes / M. Luther so

                     •
                  uayled agaynste hym that he
was excomunycate: & beynge
a man of auncyent age, an old
preste newly maried, and some
tyme archedeaken of wytten
berge / was fayne to leue hys
younge wyfe and auoyde the
domynyon of Saxony. After
ye he had wandred thourough
dyuers cities and townes swadynge
hys opynyon wyth odious
reporte / to ye mynysshyng
of M. Luthers fame: at laste
he cā to Scyrich in Swytzerlande / 
where he founde one accordynge
to hys execrable appetyte,
named Swynglyus,
whych was there an excedyng
setter forth of M. Luthers doctrine.
To whō as sone as he
had disclosed his detcstable heresye

agaynst the blessed sacrament,
he gladly accepted him / 
and in denyenge the corporall
presence of Cryst, agreed both
in one / sauynge in this poynte
they dyffered: where as Carol
stadius sayd that our saueour
Christe spekyng thes wordes:
hoc est corpus meū, meaned his corporall
presence there syttynge
with his dysciples at the table
& not in forme of brede: Swinglius
affyrmed that they were
not to be vnderstandyd lytterally,
but by a figure of interpretacyon / 
so that est was takē
for significat: and thes wordes
of Chryste, this is my bodye / 
were as myche to saye, as this
sygnyfyeth my body. Of thys
mater he wrot sondry epistles
to dyuers of his familyar frendes,

gloryously reioycynge yt
he had founde oute the longe
vnknowen trothe of so hygh
a mysterye: not by the occasyon
of Carolstadius (as he bosted)
but through his own dilygent
redynge of scripture, and
specyally of saynt Augustyns
workes / who in very dede ys
clene contrary to his horryble
heresye. Neuertheles many of
M. Luthers adherentes assentyd
vnto hym / amonge whom
the chefe was Oecolāpadius:
whych beynge a seculer preste
of .xl. yeres of age, entred ye religyon
of saynt Brydgyttes order
in ye prouince of Bauarye / 
and for heresyes that he hadde
vttred both by prechynge and
wrytyng, stādyng in daunger
of the Dukes attachiament / 

he ranne awaye pryuely wyth
a nonne of the place / whō sone
after he forsoke, and gathym
for refuge to a Lutheran prince
named Fraunces de Sychken,
a noble personage by byrthe,
but a cruell tyraunte of behaueour,
a great murtherer, a
comune spoyler of marchaūts
and a rouere of hygh wayes / 
whiche mayntenyd hym and
one Hutten a knyghte of the
new gospell, gyuē holly to mischefe / 
till at the lest for feare of
displeasure of other princes he
was dryuen to put thē awaye.
Oecolampadius cam then to
Basyle / & there he founde many
fauourers of M. Luthers
faccyō: by whose ayde he was
promotyd to be curate of a paryshe
chyrche. where he handled

hys matters wyth such clokyd
hypocrisye, that he wān

in parell of insurreccyon and

Martyn Luther wrote a conuycyous
boke agaynst Carolstadius / 
and he an answere to
the same of lyke spyryte and
semblable charyte / so yt Swinglius
and his cōpany whyles
other men wondred at theyr
madnes, laughed them bothe
to scorne. Earolstadius perceyuynge
yt he was not so hyghly
estemyd as he reckened to haue
bene / also longynge very
sore for the companye of hys
yonge wyfe: at laste he made
meanes to be recōcyled agayn

hym vpon condycyon that he

               The
fyrste as I haue shewed you
are callyd Lutheranes, bycause
they folowe Luthers doctryne.

The seconde lyke wyse are
callyd Oecolampadyanes or
Swynglyanes / & are as one
with the Lutheranes in raylynge
agaynst the cleargye, &
in cōtempnyng the authoryte
of the chyrche, but in the sacrament
of the aultar they be gretely
repugnaunt: and so farre
at varyaunce / that they haue
made large volumes full of
owtragious furies one agaīst
another / in such vncharytable
maner that it excedith the blasphemous
contencyons of all
heretykes and infideles that
euer were before our dayes. ye
theyr hatefull enemyte is so
malycyous, that yf any of the
Oecolampadyanes resorte amonge
the Lutheranes: they
shalbe excōmunycatyd as hethen

persones, and fynde very
small charyte, whiche they call
loue after the newe interpretacyon.
And in lyke maner ye Lutheranes
shall fynde as lytle
fauour amonge the Oecolampadyanes.
The thyrde faccyō
be callyd Anabaptistes, because
they are twyes chrystened / 
& wyll admytte 
                     •
                  one as theyr
faythfull brotherē except they
be rebaptyzed agayne. They
suffre not theyr chyldren to be
chrystened vntyll they be of
greate age / and haue many
straunge opynyons. They affyrme
that it is impossyble for
kynges, prynces, iustices, and
other gouernours of ye comon
weale, to be chrystē men. They
obstynatly hold that yt is vnlawfull
for a iudge to requyre

any othe of a crystē mā. They
saye that chrysten men ought
to make no prouysyon nor resistence
agayns theyr enemies
but frely suffre thē to do theyr
wyll. Also they shew holye perfeccion
outwardly / obseruing
vigyles, fastynges, wyth contynuall
redynge of scrypture,
redye to helpe theyr nedy brotheren,
vsyng theyr goodes in
comoue. And they disprayse
mych the lyuyng of the Lutheranes
& Oecolampadyās / sayenge
as I haue hard them my
self reporte, that they be wors
than the clergye / whom they
call Papistes, for because they
haue the gospell in theyr mouthes
and frame theyr lyues no
thynge thereafter / shewynge
none amēdment of theyr lewd

conuersacyō, but cōtynue styll
in vycyous excessys after the
comone rate of mysbeleuers.
And therefore they be in greuous
hatred and suffre moche
persecucyon of the other / as excommunycacyon,
exyle, enprysonement,
& oftentymes cruell
execucyō of death: in so moche
that it is enacted throwgh out
Suytzerland among ye Oecolampadyaes,
and in dyuers
other places / that who so euer
is found of the Anabaptystes
faccyon / he shall be throwen
quycke in to the water & there
drownyd.
            
            
               N.
               I se well thā
sayenge and doeng are not all
one. For I am enformed that
Martyn Luther hath wryten
extremely agaynst the persecucyon
of prelates / affyrmynge

yt to be agaynst the spyryte of
god to persecute or to putte to
death for vnbelefe or errours / 
consyderyng that fayth (as he
doth saye) is a gyfte of god / &
no man maye haue yt of hym
selfe. Also because Christe neuer
compellyd any man to beleue
in hym, cōmaūdynge the
wedes to be suffered amonge
the corne vntyll the heruest cō
                  myth.
            
            
               ☞W.
               No fayle he wrote
so at the beginnyng / but afterwarde
experiēce tawght hym
the contrarye. For if so be that
he & ye Oecolampadyanes had
permittyd theyr clyentes to do
what they lusted wythout any
restraynte: they had ben quite
oute of auctorite ere this tyme
a daye. 
                     •
                  pon whych consideracyon
yt was forfendyd in all

cyties and iurisdyccyones of ye
Lutheranes / that no mā shuld
bye or sell other resceyue, any
booke or treatise compyled by
the Oecolampadyanes. And
they in lyke maner made actes
to suppresse ye Anabaptystes / 
fearyng left theyr sectes shuld

               yf ye Anabaptystes haue
so many sectes as ye recyte, I
praye yowe to declare some of
them.
            
            
               ☞W.
               At your instaunce
I shall gladly. There be some
whych hold opynyon that all
deuylles & dānyd sowles shall
be sauyd at the daye of dome.
Some of them persuade that
the serpent whyche dysceyued
Eue was Christ. Some of thē
zraunt to euery man and woman

two soules. Some affyrme
lecherye to be no synne, & ye
one maye vse a nother mānes
wyfe withoute offence. Some
take apon them to be sooth sayers
and prophetes of wōderfull
thynges to come / & haue
prophecyed the daye of iudgement
to be at hāde: some with
in thre monethes, some wyth
in one moneth, some wythin
vi. dayes. Some of thē bothe
men and women at theyre congregacyones
for a mysterye
shew them selfes naked, affyrmyng
that they be in the state
of innocencye. Also some hold
that no mā ought to be punysshed
or suffere execucyon for
any cryme or trespace be yt neuer
so horryble, wherof I will
shew yow an exāple done mater

in dede. In Switzerland a
lytle frō saynt Gall at a place
namyd Cella Abbatis; one of these
anabaptystes slew hys owne
brother / & smote of his heade.
when he was demaūdyd why
he dyd so, this was hys answer:
It was the wyll of the
father that I shuld do yt / and
so he escaped wythout punysshement.
For though they be
gredy īreprouīg other mēnes
fawtes / makynge haynous exclamacyones
agaynst thē: yet
ponder they full lytle the correccyon
of theyr owne enormityes / 
callynge them infyrmyteis
and weaknes of ye flesshe
be they neuer so abhomynable
            
            
               N.
               well yet me thynketh by
your sayenge here before, that
many of them leade a more cō
                  mēdable

life in face of ye world
than the comone sorte of ye Lutheranes
or Oecolāpadianes,

ostentacyon. But there
cōmeth greater incouenyence
by theym whych haue suche a
shadowe of holy lyuyng, than
by the other. And there is nothyng
more peryllous in seducynge

pretence of an holye lyfe / 
where as they swerue ones frō
the ryght fayth and catholyke
belefe. whyche ys easye to be
proued by euydent examples
as well of the olde heretykes,
as of oure newe captaynes of

of suche detestable heresyes
/that it wold make a cristē
harte to tremble for to here thē

one amonge many / I was aquaynted
wyth a certeyn persone
of the Oecolampadyans
in ye cytie of Argentyne, which
led a lyfe inculpable amonge
hys neyghbours, & was reputed
of vertuous conuersacyon
exercysynge hym selfe contynually
in charytable workes,
and vnderstode fresshly ye scryptures
in his mother tounge,
for he was ignoran̄t of latine.
Afterwarde he fell in to so abhominable

heresye / that he denyed
openly the new testamēt,
sayenge yt Chryste was a fals
prophete, and all his apostles
dysceuers, acceptyng no parte
of the olde testament but the
v. bookes of Moyses. The
chefe prechers and lerned mē
of the cyte cam vnto hym for
to reforme hym by waye of disputacyon,
and to brynge hym
from his errour / requyrynge
hym to shew what grounde of
scrypture or what occasyō moued
hym to take so peryllous

wolde nother dyspute nor argue

                  t was his belefe & was assurid
of god with witnesse of his conscyence

to be trewe. Apon this
incōtynēte he was enprysoned
and at last brought before the
lordes of the towne / whiche in
lyke maner exhorted hym to
reuoke his heresyes / manacynge
hym with feare of terryble
deth yf he wolde not chaū
                  ge
hys erronyous mynde. He
answered that he was redy to
suffre what so euer deth god
had ordeyned hym vnto, and
wolde nother for feare nor for
fauour go from his opynyon.
wherfore after a suffycyent delyberacyon
seynge he wolde
tourne by no meanes / sentens
was gyuen that he shulde be
burnyd.

               No. For
when he shulde haue gone to

the place of execucyon / accordynge
to the vsaunce of the
countrye he was fyrst brought
before the towne howse / and
there hys artycles recyted. He
was asked whether they were

affermyd before them. He answered
ye. Howbeit nowe (he
sayd) god hath openyd my ignoraunce,

I byleue perfytely that Iesus

               N.
               Thys may be a good admonysshemēt
that men shulde
not be so wauerynge in fayth /

to any persone for ye onely
pretēce of exteryoure holines,
in as moche as the deuyll can
transfygure hym selfe in to an

I consyder by your cōmunycacyon

here rehersyd / that yf the

haue spoken before, because ye

god sendyth theym according

For ye must consyder that god
hath not made the people for ye

hath ordeyned them to yt we all

ye haue in Exodus the thyrde
chapyter, that when the peple
of Israhell were in myserable
thraldome vnder kynge Pharo:
they cryed to god for remedye / 
and god prouyded theym

Moyses to be theyr delyuerer / 
to whom in gyuyng his of
                     •
                  yce
he sayde: The clamoure of the
childrē of Israhell is come vnto
me and I haue sene theyr afflyccyons
how they are oppressyd
of the Egypcians: therfore
approche and I shall sende the
to belyuer my peple. ye, god loued
the peple so entyerly, that
of theym he chose bysshoppes,
prestes, and deakenes, to offer
specyall sacrefyces for the clensynge
of theyre synnes / and to
be as meanes betwene hym &
the. Note of whom also Moyses
toke the noble & wyse men / 
& made of thē prices, captayns
and gouernours, for theyre polytyke
conseruacion. Agreable
to this the storyes of Iudicum
make r
                     •
                  encion, that the people

of Israhell longe season after
Iosues death obseruyng goddys
lawes and fulfyllyng hys

in peace and hadde gracyous
gouernours. But whē they fel

them in to subieccyon of theyr

at sōdry tymes / as Othonyell,
Ayoth, Gedeō, Sampson, and

And where as ye allege
the chyldren of Helye to haue
bene cawse of the takynge of

myndyd as they be nowe a dayes.
whyche perceyuyng yt the

destroyed. & vnder this blynde
audacyte they remayned styll
impenytēt / not aknowlegyng

the returne agayn of the arke / 
where aboue the nomber of .l.

thousande persons were plagyd
with sodayne deth. Also it
may be verefyed by ye wordys
of Samuell exhortyng the peple
to returne vnto god wyth

and vnquyete appetyte

to be lyke other hethē nacyōs:
whyche is to be ꝑceyued by the

whyche they dyd in the daye yt
I brought them out of Egypt
hytherto. As they haue forsaken

thus do they also to the. when
Samuell hadde shewed vnto
them the dyspleasure of god,
wyth the manyfolde myseryes
and calamytyes whyche they
shulde suffer by the chaunge:
yet wolde they not here hym / 

but sayd that nedys they wold

yt ys to be thoughte rather
that their wylful frowardnes
agaynst god was partely

the sentence of god spoken by

For yf he had bene an vpright

but god gaue them a kynge of

dysposycyon lyke to theyre demeanoure / 
so yt when he transgressyd
goddys p̄cept in dede / 
they dyd the same, at the laste
ī wyll & cōsent / wherby they deseruyd
to be punysshed wyth
hym. For god neuer taketh vē
                  geaunce

onely for theyre synne / whyche

thoughe Saull faryd the
worse for hys people / wher as
Moyses the most faythfull seruaunte
of god was partely by

their frowardnes debarred frō

As for kyng dauyd, it is playn
that god dyspleasyd wyth the

               ☞W.
               Naye / but the
abuse of the people hauyng yt
in theyr vulgare lāguage: for
whome yt were better to receyue
yt by the mynystracyon of
faythfull preachers, than vnworthely
to take it them selfs.
we haue in the gospell yt oure
sauyour Cryst tedynge the nō
                  ber
of .v. thousand men besyde
women and chyldren / fyrst gyuyng
thankys to his father he
blyssed the breade, brake yt &

gaue yt to hys dyscyples, and
they dystrybutyd yt to the company / and
so they dyd eate and
were sacyate.
            
            
               N.
               Syr accordyng
to thys ye peple shuld
holde them very well content,
yf so be they had faythfull prechers
to mynyster the worde of
god vnto thē. But I put case
they haue none, or ellys that
theyr peachers be suche as the
ꝓphete cōplayneth on / whych
preache ye vysyō of theyr hart
                     •
                  
& not of ye mouth of god: seking
also theyr owne worldly proffyte,
and not the gostly cōfort
of theyr cures.
            
            
               ☞W.
               I beleue
yt god hath not lefte his chyrch
destytute of faythfull preachers / wyth
the whych he hath
ꝓmnysed to be contynually present

vnto the worldys ende.
How be yt the fewer that they
be / the more fawte is to be imputed
vnto the peple, becawse
they aske not worthely of god
trewe preachers. For the gospell
sheweth that the people
came fyrst to Cryst / and he perceyuyng
thē was mouyd wyth
compassyon vppon theym, becawse
they were as sheepe hauynge
no hearde / and so feadynge
theyr sowles spyrytually,
afterwarde he dyd repaste
theyre bodyes wyth corporall
foode. wherfore yf they in lyke
maner approche vnto Cryste
(in whose name what so euer
is desyred of the father shall be
graūtyd) he wyll also here gracyously
theyr petycyon: for the

hande of god is not abreuyatt
nowe / nor hys power otherwyse
mynysshed than yt was
at that tyme.
            
            
               N.
               yet am
not I so satysfyed wyth all the
reasons yt ye haue made / but I
thynke styll that yt were lawfull
for laye people to haue the
new testament in Englysshe: &
perauenture wyth a lytell leyser
I cowd lay suche scrypture
for yt / that scant ye shuld be able
to obiecte ony contradyecyon.
            
            
               ☞W.
               ye shall haue leyser
ynowgh. But in the meane
tyme thys ye must consyder yt
our question is not whyther it
be lawfull to let them haue yt / but
whyther yt be vnlawfull
to kepe them from it / and why
ther of the twayn is more mete

and more expedyent, specyally
for the tyme that nowe ys the
peple beynge dysposed as they
now be / and after suche ensample
as we see before oure iyen,
with suche fruyte as we fynde
growē therof in Almayne all
redy and in many placys euyn
here at home also. But yf euer
the tyme come as I praye god
yt may / in whyche the people
shall be so good and so godly
dysposed that an englysshe byble
shuld do good in theyr handes:
yet myght Tyndals translacyon
in no wyse be suffered.
            
            
               N.
               well I shall bethynke
me tyll we mete agayne / and
then wyll I be so bolde also to
take Tyndals parte in defēce
of hys translacyon and other

bokys which he hath put forth
in englysshe, allegyng the best
that I can for theyr alowance:
to thentent I maye see what
stronge reasons ye can brynge
to cōfute them.
            
            
               ☞W.
               Ther
wyth am I ryghte well
pleasyd / and I trust
with goddes help

so effectuously
that
ye shall not counte the
