                  SIr,
            
            hauing a great
desire, by some
meanes to signifie
my affection vnto
you: I thought I could not
better do it, nor find a more
readie meane thereunto, then
by preferring and dedicating
this little Pamphlet vnto you:
the which containing most
rare and excellent examples

of wise and wittie sayings, and
notable instructions to vertue
and vertuous actions, I suppose
cannot more fitly be presented,
then vnto you, in
whose young yeares doth alreadie
appeare a most towardly
inclination and hopefull
expectation both of wit
and vertue, such as your riper
yeares (I doubt not) will
bring to an excellency of perfection.
To the furtherance
wherof, albeit this smal Treatise
shall perhaps be able to
adde little accesse, in regard
of the plentiful helpes, wherewith
you are alreadie furnished
to that effect: yet it may
be that both the pleasure and
the profite thereof, may in
some sort proue worthie, both
of your labour in reading and

perusing of it, and of my affection
in offering it vnto you.
Not doubting therefore but
it shall be accepted, as pleasingly
as I haue presented it
willingly, most humbly I take
my leaue.
            
               Your Worships euer to be
commaunded.

            MEMORABLE
Conceipts, of diuerse
Noble and famous personages
of Christendome, of
this our moderne
time.
            
               Of Pope Alexander the third of that
name, and the Emperour Fredericke
the first, surnamed Barbarossa.
               
                  THE Emperour Frederick
the first, hauing had lōg
warres with Pope Alexander
the third: and hauing
driuen him for
feare of him to forsake Rome, and to
flie disguised in the habite of a cooke

Gardiner within the Monasterie of

                     •
                  omming to be known to the Duke

and Senate of Venice, they tooke him
thence: and hauing with great solemnitie
and magnificence conducted
him in all his Pontificall ornaments
to the Church of Saint Marke: and he
there hauing bestowed his blessing
vpon them, they guarded him from
the power of the Emperour: who in
the end being brought to reason and
reconciled vnto him, came to doe
him reuerence at the entrie of the
said Church of Saint Marke in Venice:
and there offering to kisse his feete:
the said Pope set his foote vpon the
Emperours necke, saying: It is written:
Thou shalt walke vpon the Aspe
and the Basilisque: and thou shalt tread
vpon the lion and the dragon: whereunto
the Emperour (as he lay prostrate
at the Popes feete) answered: Not to
thee but to Saint Peter do I this honour:
and to his successour do I yeeld
my obeysance. The Pope replied:
Both to me and to Saint Peter.
               
            
            
               A Sentence of Pope Alexander.
               THe same Pope being accustomed
highly to commend the institution

of the single life of Priestes,
and to blame their vsing of concubines,
was wont to vse this speech:
God hath forbidden vs to get children:
and the Diuell hath giuen vs
Nephewes in their stead.
            
            
               Of Pope innocent the fourth, and the
Emperour Fredericke the second.
               IN the yeare of our Lord one thousand,
two hundred, forty and fiue,
there fell great contentions and deuision
betweene Pope Innocent the
fourth, and the Emperour Fredericke
the second: in so much as the Pope in
the Councell of Lions, denounced
sentence against the said Fredericke, to
depose him from the Empire: and
the Emperour in despite sent certaine
verses to the Pope, who returned him
answer in the verses following.
            
            
               Fredericke Emperour, to the Pope.
               Roma diu titubans varijs erroribus acta
Corruet: & mundi desmet esse caput.
               Rome that hath long stood staggering
in great daunger
               
                  
With sundrie errours tossed and distracted.

               The Pope to the Emperour.

               The Pope.
               Fata volunt, Scriptura docet, peccata loquuntur,
               Quòd tibi vita breuis, poena perēnis crit

               Of Pope Clement the fourth, and the
Panormitanes.
               THe Panormi
                        •
                     anes sent their Embassadours
to the Pope, to purge
themselues from the guilt of the conspiracie,
whereof they had bene accused
as parties in that famous murder
of all the Frenchmen in Sicilia:
called the Sicilian Euensong. These
Embassadors hauing prostrated thē
                  selues
at the Popes feete, beganne to
say vnto him: Lambe of God which takest
away the sinnes of the world, haue
mercie vpon vs: and graunt vs thy peace.
The Pope knowing them to be naturally
mutinous and seditious, told
them: that they did as the Iewes did
to Christ, who hauing saluted him
with Hosanna in the highest, yet after
many torments did crucifie him.
               To rebellious flatterers a seuere & rigorous
answer is best befitting.
            
            
               Of the same Pope Clement & his nephew.
               THe said Clement caused a nephew
of his, who had three Prebends,

to resigne two of them, and to keep
one onely. And albeit he was very
earnestly sollicited by many persons,
that he would suffer his nephew to
enioy the said Benefices, and to preferre
him to more rather then to take
those from him He made them this
answer: He is not worthy to be the
successour of S. Peter, who giueth
more to his kindred, then to the
poore members of Christ.
               A princ ipall part of the goods of the
Church is in right due to the poore.
            
            
               Of Pope Boniface the eighth, and his
sprinkling of ashes on his
Cardinals.
               THere was in time past a certaine
famous faction in Italy between
the Guelphes and Gibellines: in the
which Pope Boniface the 8. fauoured
the party of the Guelphs. Now it happened
that on an Ash-wednesday,
the Pope being to put Ashes vpon
the heads of the Cardinals and Bishops
(according to the vsage and
institution of the Church of Rome:)

one Prochet Archbishoppe of Genes
(who was of the faction of the Gibellines,
and therefore hated of Boniface)
came to present him selfe on
his knees before the Pope, to receiue
of his ashes: then Boniface both changing
the ordinarie words vsed in that
ceremonie, and casting the ashes in
to the Archbishop his face: whereas
the Pope should haue said, Memento
homo quòd cinis es, & in cinerem re
                     
                        ••
                     erteris:
that is, Remember man
thou art but dust and ashes, and into
dust and ashes shalt returne: he said,
Remember man thou art a Gibelline,
and die thou shalt with the Gibellines.
               
               This sheweth with how great power the
passion of hatred doth transport men:
when it causeth euen those which
should be most holy and deuout, to forget
their dutie and their reuerence to
God and his religion.
            
            
               Of the same Boniface, and the French
king Philip le Bel.
               THe same Boniface being at some
difference with the French king,

                  Philip the fair, touching the supreme
power and authoritie in matters both
Ecclesiasticall and Temporall: in
certain letters which he sent vnto the
King had these words: We will that
thou shouldest know, that the whole
Soueraigntie both of spirituall and
temporall matters in thy Realme
of Fraunce is of right and dutie belonging
to vs: and whosoeuer shall
say the contrary, we repute them as
fooles. The King returned him in
writing this answer: Philip by the
grace of God King of Fraunce to Boniface
calling himselfe Pope: we will
thee to take notice, that we acknowledge
in our temporall affaires no superiour
but God alone: and whosoeuer
shall affirme the contrarie, we
hold him for a foole and a sot.
            
            
               Another conceipt of Pope Boniface, touching
one that resembled him in
countenance.
               POpe Boniface being told by one
of his Court, that there was a pilgrime
of the country of Bauyer come

to Rome of purpose to visite the Religious
places of the citie, who did altogether
resemble him both in person
and in countenance: Boniface
hauing caused him to be sent
for to his presence, demaunded of
him, if his mother had euer bene at
Rome. The pilgrime perceiuing himselfe
touched with suppose of bastardie,
answered: Holy Father,Some report this of Augustus Caesar. my mother
was neuer in this countrie, but
my father hath bin here many times.
               In this answer the pilgrim soberly returned
that quippe vpon the Pope, which
he thought to haue put vpon him.
            
            
               Of Pope Gregorie; and one that praised
him to his face.
               POpe Gregorie hearing one to cō
                  mend
him beyond all measure,
and more then himselfe desired, said
vnto him: God graunt (my friend)
that I proue such a one as thou reportest
me, and that thou be so honest a
man as the opinion which thou hast
of me, may be free from blame and
exception.
            
            
               
               Of Cardinal Cossa who made himselfe
Pope by force.
               AFter the decease of Pope Alexander,
the Cardinals being assembled
in the towne of Bolonia the
great: and shut vp within the Conclaue
to chuse a new Pope: the Cardinall
Baltazar Cossa Bishop of that
Citie, being there with great forces,
told the Cardinals freely and plainely:
that if they did not chuse such a
one to be Pope as should be to his liking,
they should repent it. The Cardinals

                     ••
                  tonished at his menaces: and
seeing his armed forces attending
round about the Conclaue, named
diuerse vnto him, but none of them
would content him: whereupon they
being the more terrified, willed him
to nominate some one, and promised
that if so be he were a person capable
of the place, they would receiue
and admit him. With that Cossa
called for the Popes Pall, that he
might set it on him whom he should
chuse: which being brought and giuen
vnto him, he set it on his owne

shoulders, saying: I am Pope. The
Cardinals, howbeit this act was against
all law and custome, yet durst
not gainesay him, but consenting to
his election, they named him Iohn
the three and twentieth.
            
            
               A saying of Pope Alexander the fifth.
               POpe Alexander the fifth of that
name, was very liberall & bountiful
to the poore, and to such as were
learned. And he was wont to say in
his common talke: that when he was
but a Bishop he was rich: and being
made a Cardinall he became poore:
but after that he came to be Pope, he
was a starke begger.
            
            
               Of Pope Calixtus which would haue but
one Benefice.
               CAlixtus the third Pope of that
name, the yeare before he was
exalted to the Popedome being only
Bishop of Valentia and Cardinall:
would neuer accept of any other Benefice
nor Ecclesiasticall preferment:

saying, that he was well content to
haue one onely virgine to his spouse
and maried wife.
            
            
               Notable sentences of Pope
Pius the second.
               POpe Pius the second was wont to
say, That in a towne of libertie,
euery man may speake liberally and
freely.
               Being told on a time, that a certaine
person had spoken very badly
of him: he answered the partie reporting
it: If thou hadst bene in Campo
de Fier, thou shouldest haue heard
many others, who would haue spoken
farre worse of me.
               In esteeming more of good books
then of riches, he was wont to say:
That the most sumptuous & richest
iewels and precious stones which he
had, were inclosed within his books.
               His saying was: That by counsell
a man might prouide remedie for
any misfortunes or mishaps: like as
in diseases there needed nothing but
med
                     •
                  cine, yet so as it be taken in

time and place conuenient.
               He said: That the lawes had the
force and vertue to bridle the common
& inferior sort of people: but
they had little or no command ouer
the richer and greater persons: and
that the great affairs of Princes were
not vsually determined or decided
by the lawes, but by force of armes.
               Ignorant and vnlearned persons
(said he) are easily led and moued
with eloquent and artificial speeches:
but wise men are nothing moued
therewithall.
               He was wont to say: that Phisitions
ought not to demaund money
of their patients, but their health.
               Of sutes in law he had a saying:
That the suters or clients are the
birds: the courts or places of pleas,
are the fields: the ludges are the nets:
and the Aduocates are the birders.
               He said: that men ought to be bestowed
vpon dignities, and not dignities
vpon men.
               An ignorant Bishop he compared
to an asse.
               Ignorant Ph
                     •
                  sitions (quoth he) kill

the bodie: and ignorant Priests destroy
the soules of their patients.
               He that is too hastie and easie in
pardoning the follies of his child,
nourisheth to himselfe an enemie.
               A couetous man is not pleasing to
men liuing, nor doth any good till
himselfe be dead.
               A luxurious and riotous life doth
at all times spoile a man, but in old
age it vtterly killeth him.
               Lying is a most base and seruile
kind of vice.
            
            
               A sentence of Pope Innocent.
               POpe Innocent the eighth was wōt
to say: that it was not fit to make
warre to get glorie, or for conquest:
but onely to purchase peace and quietnesse.
            
            
               The titles which Pope Iulius gaue vnto
his seruants.
               POpe Iulius the second of that
name, had his houshold seruants
of sundry nations. And when he took

his repast in priuate, he would for his
sport and recreation call those Spaniards
that attended him, the birds of
the aire: because he reputed them
vaineglorious and great boasters, and
desirous of the vpper hand. The Venetians
and Genowaies, he named the
fishes of the sea, because they frequē
                  ted
the seas: and many times the fishes
fed vpon their dead bodies. The
Almaines he named the beasts of the
field: iudging them to be void of vnderstanding.
The French men he termed
winepissers. Wherupon it happened
that once a certaine Norman
(one of his tasters) merily said vnto
him: Holy Father, then are you a
right Frenchman. Wherfore said the
Pope? Because (quoth he) you are the
greatest winepisser of all others: if all
the Frēch of the world were together
            
            
               The speech of Pope Iulius the second, touching
his deuise in warres.
               THis Pope was a man that delighted
greatly in warres, the which
he did ordinarily nourish & mainetaine

betweene many Princes: and in
especiall against the king of Fraunce.
On a time some of his court said vnto
him: Holy Father, many great personages
do thinke it straunge, that
you shold be so desirous to entertain
warres, considering the dignities of
that calling wherein God hath placed
you, which ought to be an estate of
peace and quietnesse: and seeing God
hath committed vnto you the keyes
by which you should shut vp the way
to discord, and open it to peace and
amitie: but you do quite contrarie.
Whereunto the Pope gaue them this
answer: They which vsed those speeches
vnto you, say they know not
what. Haue you not heard how S. Peter
and S. Paul were companions,
and had but one Church betweene
them. My predecessours vsed 
                     •
                  aint
Peters key: and now will I helpe my
selfe with S. Pauls sword. One of the
parties replyed vnto him: You know
holy Father, that our Lord said vnto
Saint Peter: Put vp thy sword into thy
sheath. The Pope answered: true but
that was after Saint Peter had first

striken with the sword.

                     to de Varis seeing Iulian the
Cardinall of S. Angel (who was
President in the Councel of Basil) to
spend most of his time in the reading
of ancient bookes: he said vnto him:
Sir, why do you liue so solitarie, and
spend your time amongst the dead
of former ages? Come I pray and
passe your daies with vs that are aliue.
The Cardinal answered: you
mistake the matter cleane contrarie.
For these Auncients do now liue by
their learning and rare knowledge:
wheras you liue not, but be as dead
men, both in your name and in your
works: and passe away your life time
according to the nature of bruite
beastes.
               The life of the spirit consisteth in contē
                  plation
of learned vvritings, vvhich
are the true Monuments, Reliques,

and testimonies of such as haue for

               Of the Archbishop of Colaine, and
a countrey pesant.
               A Certaine old man a poore laborer
of the countrey seeing the
Archbishop of Coiaine to ride throgh
the fields, armed and accompanied
with armed forces, fell out of a loud
laughing whereupon being demanded
wherefore he laughed: he answered:
Because he wondered that S.
Peter, Christs Vicar in the Church being
exceeding poore, had left his successors
so rich and wealthie: and that
their traines should be more furnished
with men at armes, then with
Church men. The Archbishop desirous
that the fellow should haue better
knowledge of him in his place &
dignitie, told him: that he was not
onely an Archbishop but a Duke also:
and that as a Duke he rode so accompanied
with a traine of men at
armes: Howbeit when he was in his
Church, then he was attended on as

an Archbishop. Sir (said the labourer)
I pray tell me: when my Lord
the Duke shall be with the Diuell:
what shall then become of the Archbishop?
               Tvvo heads vpon one bodie, is a thing
monstrous in nature.
            
            
               Of the Bishop of Chartres and the French
King, Levvis the eleuenth.
               KIng Levvis the eleuenth, seeing
on a time Miles Bishop of Chartres
mounted vpō a Mule with trappings
of veluet, and his bridle richly
gilded, told him: that the Bishops of
elder ages were content to ride on an
Asse, and with a simple collar. O,
(quoth the Bishop) that was when
Kings were shepheards and did keep
sheepe. The King replyed: I speake
not of the Bishops of the old Testament,
but of those vnder the new.
The Bishop answered. I but that was
when Kings were great giuers of
almes, and did vse to set poore Lazers
with them at their tables, and to
wash the feet of the poore.
            
            
               
               Of the same Bishop, and certaine Priests
vvhich he met.
               THe same Bishop encountring
with two or three Priests passing
through the fields, said vnto them:
God saue you my maisters and
Clerkes: the Priests answered: we
are not Clerkes (sir) we are Priestes.
The Bishop replyed: then God saue
you my maisters and Priestes, no
Clerkes.
            
            
               A conceipted speech of the Abbot
of Baigne.

                        •
                     vvis the eleuenth demanded
of the Abbot of Baigne to
haue his Abbey for some small recompence:
but the Abbot being wily,
said vnto the King: Sir, I haue spent
almost forty yeares in learning the
two first letters of the Alphabet. A. B.
and I shall neede as long time to
learne the two next letters, C. D.
               By the equiuocation of these foure letters
in alluding A. B. to the vvord Abbey,
and C. D. to the Latin vvord cede

vvhich signifieth to yeeld vp: his meaning
vvas, that as he had bene fortie
yeares ere he attained to the dignitie
of an Abbot: so he vvould vvillingly
keepe it other fortie yeares cre he
vvould yeeld it vp.
            
            
               A saying of Pope Adrian the fifth.
               POpe Adrian being demaunded,
what was the greatest plague
which he would wish to his enemie,
and not wish him dead: He answered.
The greatest mischiefe I would
wish him, is that he were Pope, because
I hold that to be a maruellous
affliction and vexation of spirit.
               All kind of authoritie vvherein a man
hath a care and conscience to do his
dutie, should be rather refused for the
charge, then desired for hope of gaine.
            
            
               The Absolution of the king of Portugal.
               
                  EManuel king of Portugal withheld
from a Bishop of his kingdome
the reuenues of his bishoprick:
whereof the Bishop complained to

the Pope: who in fauour of the Bishop
sent a Legate to the King, to
cause him to make restitution or to
excommunicate him. The Legate
vpon the matter hauing denounced
sentence of excommunication, and
being on his way to returne, the
King enraged at the censure, mounted
on horsebacke to follow the Legate,
and hauing ouertaken him, he
drew out his sword and threatned to
kill him, vnlesse he would absolue
him: which the Legate hauing done;
the King retired to his Court, and the
Legate went on to Rome: where being
come, and hauing made report
vnto the Pope of the successe of his
iourney: the Pope reproued him very
sharpely for yeelding to absolue
the king. The Legate answered: most
holy Father, if you had bene in daunger
of your life as I was, you would
haue giuen the king absolution double
and treble.
               Feare of death may make a man sometimes
do do that vvhich he ought not
vvithout regard both of honour and
dutie.
            
            
               
               Of Charles the Great, and his Edicts.
               THe Emperour Charlemaine did
vse to weare his seale of armes
engrauen in the pomell of his sword:
and he was wont to say, whensoeuer
he set his seale to any letters of Edict,
Ordinances or Commissions: See
this is the sword that shall maintaine
my Ordinances: & which shall make
warre against those who shall contradict
mine Edicts.
               It is not a matter of so great importance
to establish and make good lavves &
decrees: as it is to cause them to be
kept and obserued.
            
            
               Of the sentence vvhich the Emperour
Fredericke gaue against the Citizens
of Milan.
               THe Emperour Fredericke Barbarossa
making war in Italy, compelled
them of Milan to yeeld themselues
in subiection to the Empire.
The Empresse his wife desirous to be
seene of the Citizens, entred into the

Citie in great pompe and magnificence:
supposing that she had bene
there in good securitie. But the Milanois
being ill affectioned to the Emperour,
and bearing a grudge against
him in their hearts, in regard he had
subdued them, they tooke the Empresse
and set her vpon a Mule, with
her face towards the taile, the which
they made her hold betweene her
hands in steed of a b
                     •
                  idle: and being
so mounted, they caused her to ride
out at another gate of the Citie then
that where she made her entrie. The
Emperour highly incensed, and that
iustly with this outrage, did besiege
their Citie, and pressed them so hard,
that he constrained them to yeeld
vnto him bodie and goods, with this
condition: that they which would
saue their liues, should take or catch
with their teeth certaine figges hanging
betweene the genitals of a mad
kicking Mule. Many of them preferred
death before a shamefull life:
the residue that were more desirous
of life, then carefull of their honour,
accepted & performed the conditiō.

And hereof is sprong that Prouerbe
vsed in mocquerie amongst the Italians:
when putting one finger betweene
two others, they say: see here
is a figge for thee.
               The common saying is: A dull Asse must
haue a sharpe spurre: a rebellious people
must haue a reuengefull Prince.
            
            
               The threats of Charles the bald.
               THe Empire being in controuersie
betweene king Charles the
bald and his Nephewes the children
of Loys, kings of Germany: he sent a
message vnto them, to let them vnderstand,
that he would bring such
huge numbers of men at armes ouer
the Rhine, as their horses shold drink
that riuer so drie, that they should be
able to passe it and not wet their
feete.
            
            
               Of Theodosius the Emperour
and his Decree.
               THe Emperour Theodosius being
highly incensed with the Thessalonians,
                  
for that they had slaine one
of his knights within the Theater. He
was determined to haue put all the
inhabitants of Thessalonica to the
sword: but being disswaded from the
act: after he had wel bethought himselfe
he repented him of his determination.
And thereupon he made a
law: that from thencefoorth, when
any sentence of death, or other punishment
should be giuen or pronounced
vpon any offender, either
by the Prince, or by any inferiour
Iudge his Lieutenant, the execution
of the iudgement for three daies after
should be deferred: to the intent
there might be place left, on the one
part for repentance, and on the other
for mercie.
            
            
               The act of Theodosius for the repressing
of his Choler.
               WHensoeuer his choler grew
to be enflamed, he would
suddenly withdraw himselfe out of
company: and being alone would
pronounce ouer all the letters of the

Alphabet ech after other with great
leasure: to the intent that in meane
time his wrath and anger might wax
cold, and be asswaged.
               He that cannot subdue his choler by nature,
must do it by art and cunning
            
            
               Of the Emperour Sigismond and a Page
of his chamber.
               THe Emperour Sigismond, and
one of the Pages of his chambet,
passing ouer a certaine riuer at a
foord on horseback: when they were
in the middest of the the riuer, the
Emperours horse stood still and began
to stale: which the Page seeing,
he said vnto the Emperour: Most sacred
Prince, your horse is ill taught,
and resembleth you very well. The
Emperour answered neuer a word,
but rode
                     •
                   on towards his lodging:
where being come, and in pulling off
his bootes, he demaunded of his
Page, why he had likened his horse
vnto him. Because (quoth the Page)
the riuer had no need of any water,
yet your horse in pissing there, did

adde water vnto water: & so do you:
For you giue wealth and riches to thē
which haue plenty, but to such as
haue none you giue not any. It is
now a long time that I haue bene in
your seruice, and yet did I neuer tast
of your liberality. The next morning
the Emperour tooke two little iron
Coffers both of a greatnesse & like
weight: the one of them being full
of duckets, and the other of lead: &
putting them vpon a table, he said vnto
his Page: here be two Coffers,
make thy choise of the two which
thou shalt like best, and take it for
thy wages and recompence of thy
seruice. The Page chusing that which
was full of lead: the Emperour said,
Now open it, and see what is within
it: which he did, and found it to be
but lead. Then said the Emperour:
now thou knowest thy fortune: the
fault was none of mine, that thy
choise was no better, and that thou
wert not made rich: for thou 
                     •
                  ast refused
thy good fortune when it was
offered thee.
               Some are poore through their ovvne default,

because vvhen occasion is offered
to enrich themselues, they k
                     •
                  ovv
not hovv to take their time and to lay
hold of it.
            
            
               Diuerse notable sentences of the
same Sigismond.
               THe said Emperor being demanded,
what kind of man he esteemed
most fitte and worthie to be a
king: such a one (quoth he) as neither
glorieth in his good fortunes, nor is
daunted with aduersitie.
               When one complained vnto him,
that the citie of Constance in Almaine,
had not free vse of their liberties and
franchises: he answered: If they had
not great libertie in the towne of Cō
                     stance,
thou which art one of that citie,
wouldest not speake vnto me so
liberally: for franknesse of speech is
a signe of libertie.
               He said also: That as God would
be both loued and feared: so should
Kings and Princes be: for there can
hardly be any true loue where there
is no feare.
               
                  
There be three degrees of persons
who ought to be both loued &
honoured. Frst, God aboue all, and in
all places. Secondly, Kings and Princes
in their kingdomes and estates.
And lastly, parents and maisters in
their priuate families.
               The same Prince hearing one to
praise him to his face, beyond all
measure more then he well liked of,
and to resemble him to God: he
stroke him on the cheeke: and the
partie saying vnto him: Wherefore
doth your Maiestie strike me? He answered:
Wherefore doest thou bite
me?
               He had an ordinarie saying: That
kings should be exceeding happie in
this world: if all proud persons were
chased out of their Courts: and that
they were followed and attended
with none but such as were courteous
and mercifull.
               He said also: that those were to be
held for sage and wise persons, who
could modestly endure any reasonable
iest or mocquerie: And that those
who were prompt in pretie iests and

meriments, were to be reputed men
of a good spirit.

of Sigismond, made to those that
persvvaded her to continue
a vvidovv.
               AFter that the Emperour Sigismond
was deceased, the Ladie
Barba his widow was perswaded by
one to liue still a widowe, in imitation
of the example of the Turtle,
which after the death of the male,
doth keepe continuall chastitie.
Whereunto she made this answer: If
so be thou wilt counsel me to follow
the conditions of the birdes of the
aire which are destitute of reason:
why doest not thou as well tell me of
the Doue and the Sparrow.

the first.
               
                  ROdulph Emperor, who first translated
the Empire of Almaine into
the house of Austria: as he was deuising

with his familiar friends vpon
that matter, how the same had bene
effected: It is no maruell (said he) if
they be accompted fooles that know
not how to raigne: for there is not any
man liuing that iudgeth himselfe
to be a foole.
            
            
               A Sentence of the Emperour Albert.
               THe Emperour Albert, was wont
to say: That the delight of hunting
was an exercise fit for a man:
but dauncing and leaping did appertaine
to women. And howbeit he
could temper himselfe to abstaine
from all other pleasures; yet he could
not restraine himselfe from the exercise
of hunting.
            
            
               The Fable of the Emperour Fred
                     •
                  ricke
the third, propounded to the Embassadour
of k
                     •
                  ng Levvis
the eleuenth.
               
                  CHarles duke of Burgundy hauing
planted his siege before the city
of Nuce, which was succoured by the

Emperour Fredericke the third and
the Almaines: King Levvis the eleuenth
of France (who sought nothing
more then the ruine of the said Duke
of Burgundie) sent his Embassadour
to the Emperour Fredericke to practise
and perswade with him to seize
and confiscate into his owne hands
all those lands and Seignories which
the Duke of Burgundie held of the
Empire: and that he for his part wold
do the like for the countries of Flanders,
Artois, Burgundie, and others dependants
of the Crowne of Fraunce.
The Emperour vpon this motion,
made the Ambassadour this answer.
Neare vnto a certaine citie in Almain
did once haunt a most cruell and dā
                  gerous
Beare, which did many mischiefes
and displeasures to the inhabitants
adioyning. Now it happened
that three merrie companions (as
they were drinking in a Tauerne, &
hauing litle mony to pay their shot)
they agreed with their host to make
sale of the Beares skinne, and to pay
him out of the money: and for the
performance thereof, they prepared

themselues presently to go and take
him. The bargaine being made and
the dinner ended, they put thēselues
in quest of the beast: and approching
to the Caue where he was lodged: the
Beare issued out vpon them so fiercely:
that being surprised with a sudden
feare, one of them fled away backe
towards the towne: another saued
himselfe by climing of a tree: and the
third being ouertaken by the Beare,
fell downe vnder him as dead. And
the Beare (without doing him any other
hurt) did often put his mouth to
the eares of the poore fellow, who all
the while held his wind, and abstained
from breathing: for the nature of
the Beare is not to touch or to offend
any dead bodie. Now the Beare being
gone, the man got vp and went
his way also: after which he that was
aloft in the tree came downe, and hauing
ouertaken his companion, demanded
of hm: what it was that the
Beare told him in his eare: marrie
(quoth the fellow) he bad me, that I
should neuer after vse to sell a Beares
skin, till the beast were dead.
               
                  
By this fable the Emperor payed the Embassadour
with an answer: as if he
should haue said: Let vs first be sure
to take the Duke, and then afterwards
let vs make partition of his dominiōs.
            
            
               Graue sentences and answers of the Emperour
Fredericke.
               THe Emperour Fredericke being
demaunded: whom he accompted
his greatest friends: He answered:
Those men which feare me lesse
then God.
               Being likewise asked what he
thought was the best thing which
could happen to a man: he answered:
A happie and good departure out of
this mortall life.
               If the end of a mans life be not
good and in the feare of God, all the
rest is little worth.
               He said: That those Princes which
are giuen to be cruell and too rigorous,
haue great cause to feare death:
For with the same iudgement they
haue adiudged others in their life,
themselues are like to be adiudged

after their death.
               The same Fredericke hauing subdued
the Guntians a people in Hungarie:
he said, We haue now done a
great deed: it remaines yet that we do
another deede more great: that is:
That we vanquish our selues, by refraining
from auarice, and from the
desire of reuenge.
               This Emperour Fredericke did
bring vp in his Court, euen from an
infant, Ladislaus the sonne of the king
of Hung
                        •
                     rie and of Boheme: and there
were m
                     •
                  ny which perswaded and
counselled him to 
                     ••
                  ke away the
child, and to put him to dea
                     •
                  h: because
in processe of time, his life
might cause him great hurt and hinderance:
and by his death, he might
succeede him in his Realmes and riches.
To whom the Emperour made
this answer: I perceiue then, that you
had rather haue me a rich King, then
a iust Prince and a pitifull. But for my
part I had rather haue an honourable
report and good renowme, then all
the riches and treasures of the
world.

                  MArtian Emperour of Constantinople,

he ought not in any case to
entertaine warres.

                  SEptimius Seuerus, Emperour of
Rome, was a Prince so well beloued,
and ruled so well and commendably,
that the Senate said of him:
That it had bene good, either that he
had neuer bene borne, or that he
might neuer dye.

Emperour, whensoeuer he appointed
any one to be punished opē
                  ly,
he caused the common Cryer
with a loud voice to pronounce this
sentence: Do not that to another, which
thou wouldest not haue done to thee. And
the same sentence did he cause to be
engrauen in his Pallace, & in the publique
Edifices.

That the Emperour of all other men

               The answer of Maximilian to one that
would be made a Gentleman.
               THe Emperor Maximilian being
at Bologna: a citizen of that Citie,
exceeding rich and wealthie, but

of base parentage, presented himself
before the Emperour, saying: May
it please your sacred Maiestie to
make and create me a Gentleman:
For I haue wealth sufficient to maintaine
the state and degree of a Gentleman.
The Emperor answered him:
I can make thee much more rich thē
thou art, but it is not in my power to
make thee noble: For that is an honour
which thou must purchase by
thy owne proper vertue.
            
            
               An answer of Maximilian to one that
demaunded an almes of him.
               A Certaine poore man very ill appointed,
entred into the Pallace
of the Emperour, and required that
he might haue accesse to his Maiestie
to speake with him: which being
denyed him, he continued notwithstanding
so to importune the Vshers:
that the Emperour willed the poore
man to be brought vnto him, to
whom he said: Most sacred Emperour:
you and I are brothers borne of
one Father, Adam: and of one Mother

                  Eue: and you see my pouertie:
may it therefore please your Excellencie
to enlarge my estate, and to
bestow some wealth vpon me, as ech
brother is bound to do one for another.
The Emperour noting the rashnesse
and follie of this fellow, caused
a small peece of money to be giuen
him: where at the poore man making
shew but of small contentment,
because he found his hope frustrate,
in regard of that great liberalitie
which he expected. The Emperour
said vnto him: me thinkes thou sholdest
hold thy self contented with that
which I haue giuen thee: For true it
is (as thou saidest,) we are all brothers:
and if all the rest of our brethren
would giue thee as much as I haue
done, thou wouldest be much more
rich, and a greater Lord then I am.
            
            
               The wish of the same Maximilian.
               AS he was one day deuising with
his familiar friends, and discoursing
of Empires, Realmes, and Seignories:
If it were possible for a man

to be God: and my selfe were so, hauing
two sonnes, I would desire, that
the eldest might be God after me: &
that the second might be king of
Fraunce.

               A notable sentence of Constantine
the Emperour.
               
                  
                  COnstantine Ducas the son of Andronicus,
Emperour of Constantinople,
was not in any sort himselfe
learned: and yet he did so exceedingly
loue both learning and men of
knowledge, that he was wont to say:
I hold it farre better to be made noble
and excellent by learning, then
by the possession of the Empire.
            
            
               A speech of the Emperour Henry touching
his contentment.
               THe Emperour Henry the first of
that name, of the house of Saxonie:
before that he came to be crowned
in Italy, or to receiue the ceremonious
Titles of the Empire. Howbeit
that the Pope had offered him
the Imperiall Crowne and Diademe,
and to annoint him Emperour: yet
he neither accepted nor refused it:
saying vnto his people: It sufficeth me
that by the g
                     •
                  ace of God and you, I
haue the name of Emperour. None
of my predecessors and auncestours
hauing euer had the honour to attaine
thereunto.
            
            
               
               The Charitie of the Emperour
Tiberius.
               THe Emperour Tiberius Constantine,
a Thracian borne, being reprehended
by his wife Sophia Augusta
because he distributed in great abundance
to the poore, all the treasures
which she and her first husband Iustin
had gathered together in many
yeares: he answered her: My trust is
in God, that our treasure shall be neuer
a whit the lesse, for being distributed
to the releefe of the poore, and
the redeeming of captiues and prisoners.
For in so doing, we gather that
great treasure, whereof our Lord Iesus
Christ spake in the sixt chapter of
Saint Mathevv his Gospell, saying.
Lay vp for your selues treasures in
heauen, where neither mothes nor
wormes can corrupt thē, nor theeues
can do you any dammage by stealing
them.
            
            
               The saying of the same Tiberius at the
time of his deaeh to his son in law.
               THe same Tiberius perceiuing the
time of his death to approch, by

the connsell and aduice of the Empresse
Sophia, pronounced for his
successour to the Empire Mauritius,
one borne in Cappadocia: and giuing
vnto him in mariage his daughter,
with the Imperiall vestures and ornaments,
he said: Here I deliuer vnto
thee both my Empire, and this maiden
for thy wife: wishing thee to
serue thee of her so, as may be for
thy good and benefite: and that aboue
all things thou remember to
maintaine equitie and iustice.
               The fairest flower of a Princes Crowne,
is iustice: by which Kings do raigne.
            
            
               Of a duke of Freeze, vvhich vvould not
be baptized.
               
                  ROboald duke of Freezeland, at the
preaching of VVal
                        •••
                     n Archbishop
of Sens, had determined to haue
bene baptized: to which end being
stripped out of his garments, as he
stood naked and had put one foot into
the water, he bethought himselfe
and asked the standers by, what was
become of his parents and friends deceased,

whe
                     •
                  her they were in Paradise
or in hel. Answer was made him:
that doubtlesse they were all damned
in hell, and that not any of them
was in Paradise, because they were
not Christians. At this speech he suddenly
drew backe his foote, and contrarie
to the expectation of all the assembly,
said aloft: That he would not
be baptized: but that he would goe
after his death, where he knew he
should find most of his friends. And
the same day he dyed suddenly.
            
            
               The revvard vvhich Clouis king of
Fraunce, gaue to those vvhich
had betrayed their maister.
               
                  CLouis the first Christian king of
Fraunce, hauing warres with Richer
duke of Cambray, a man of very
bad conditions and lewd life: the
Barrons of the said Duke promised
the King, that if he would come and
deliuer battell to their Lord, they
would betake themselues to flight, &
leaue their Lord to be taken prisoner.
The king Clouis, for the effecting of

this enterprize, sent vnto the traitors
a number of Corcelets of Copper very
richly guilt: And the plot being
executed according to the agreement,
Richer was taken and put to
death After which the traitors being
aggrieued that the presents which
the King had sent them were of so
small valure: They complained vnto
him, saying: that they were but
badly recompenced: to whome the
king answered, not without discretiō:
Do you not konw how sufficiently I
haue rewarded you, in giuing you
your liues? In your own iudgements
thinke with what torments they deserue
to be punished which haue
betrayed their Lord and maister.
Wherefore hold it for no small benefite
and fauour, that I suffer you to
liue: and get you hence speedily, if
you be not wearie of your liues.
Where at the traitors being abashed,
they soone withdrew themselues frō
his presence.
            
            
               Of the shame which Aulilia did vnto her
sonne Thierrie, whereby she was a
cause of his victorie.
               
                  
                  THierry being Generall for the
Emperour Zenon in Italy: and hauing
bene defeated by Odo
                        •
                     cer king
of the Herules, fled towards Rauenna.
On the way being met by his mother
Aulilia, and she perswading him
to returne againe to the field, and to
renue the battell: and seeing him to
make a difficultie so to do: She said
vnto him: my sonne beleeue me, and
assure thyself, thou hast neither castle
nor fortres where thou canst be safe,
except I take vp my clothes, and suffer
thee to returne againe into my
belly from whence thou hadst thy
first being. Thierry being both ashamed,
and enflamed at this speech of
his mother, reassembled his armie,
returned to the place of battell: and
finding his enemies in disorder, by
reason of their first victorie: he charged
in vpon them and defeated
them
               Fevv vvords vvell spoken and vvell taken,
cause great matters be put in execution.
            
            
               
               Of the good counsell which a Gentleman
gaue vnto the same Thierry, Lieutenant
to Zenon the Emperour, vnder the couerture
of a Fable: by meanes
whereof, Thi
                     •••
                  y made
himselfe king of
Italy.
               
                  THierry was accused vnto the Emperour
Zenon by some enuious
persons, that he affected the Empire:
whereupon the Emperour sent for
him home to Constantinople, & there
held him prisoner: till such time as
being put to his triall he purged him
selfe. Within a while after, he was againe
accused for the same matter: &
being commaunded by the Emperour
to make his repaire vnto him,
who was purposed to put him to
death: he sent a messenger to the
Emperours Court, vnto one Tolomee
his great friend and familiar, to vnderstand
his opinion, if he held it
good for him to come to the Court
or not. Tolomee in regard of his oath
made vnto the Emperour, durst not

reueale the secret of the Emperours
purpose vnto the messenger of Thierry:
but appointing him to attend the
Emperor at dinner time: he streightly
charged him to marke well what
he should heare him there say▪ to the
intent he might rehearse the same
vnto his maister that sent him. The
next day, the Emperour sitting at his
table, and keeping open state, Tolomee
(who was one of his nearest fauorities)
deuising with him of many
things as they were at meate, let fall
this fable of set purpose. The Lion
(quoth he) being chosen king by the
other beasts: they all came to do him
reuerence: the Hart (which is a goodly
beast) approching to salute him
with the rest, and bending himselfe
before him, the Lion tooke him by
the hornes purposing to deuoure
him: but the Hart drew away his
head with that strength and force as
he escaped and saued himselfe. The
Reinard seeing the Lion to frown, &
to grow in a great rage, because the
Hart had escaped him, did promise
the Lion to cause the Hart to come

backe againe. And vpon the matter,
he did so flatter the Hart with so many
sweet and sugred words, that he
drew him backe againe to the Lion,
to whom he doing reuerence as before,
the Lion seized vpon his horns,
and the other beasts falling also vpon
him, so as he was soone deuoured.
The Reinard pulling out his heart▪
did secretly eate it. Each of the beasts
sought very earnestly for his heart to
make a present of it to the king: but
the same not being to be found, the
blame was laid vpon the Renard with
great threats and stripes: Alas (quoth
the Reinard) I am wrongfully punished:
for the Hart had no hart at all:
for if he had had any, he would neuer
haue returned to be slain and deuoured.
This tale being marked and vnderstood
by the messenger, he returned
to Thie
                        ••
                     y, to whom he recited
what he had heard: whereby he was
aduertized not to returne any more
to the Emperour: and within a while
after he made himselfe king of Italy.
               
            
            
               
               A sentence of king Attila and his titles
               
                  ATtila king of the Gothes, was
wont to say: That the griefe
which he had conceiued in loosing
of riches, was greater then al the pleasure
that he euer took in possessing
of them. Amongst many other titles
which he esteemed excellent, he
chiefly bore this to be called: The
feare of the world: and the scourge
of God.
            
            
               The words of Clotarius king of Fraunce,
at the time of his death.
               
                  CLotarius the first of that name,
king of Fraunce, at the time of
his death fell into these speeches, saying
often: Vuach, Auach: How great
is this King of heauen, that thus killeth
and causeth to dye the most
great and mightie Kings and Princes
of the world?
               To men that are too much in loue with
the world, the tast of death is very bitter.

the electing of the King
of Fraunce.
               
                  PEpin Maister of the Pallace of the
king of Fraunce, sent his Ambassadours
to Pope Zacharie, to haue his
aduice whom he held to be most
worthie to be King: either him, who
for the profite and common good of
the Realme, did expose himselfe to
all turmoile and trauell: or him that
liuing in idlenesse and slouth, had no
care or regard of the Commonwealth,
neither to augment it nor to
defend it. The Pope returned him in
writing this answer: That he was the
fittest person to raigne, and to be entitled
King, which tooke vpon him
the charge and managing of the publique
affaires, both for the defence
of the Realme, and for the maintaining
of iustice. The French being informed
of this answer, deposed their
king Childericke, and thrusting him
into a Monasterie, elected Pepin king
of Fraunce in his stead.

                     •
                  ng, he would
prouide him of lights against his
Churching. The Duke returned him
this answer: That he would not faile
to let him vnderstand of his vprising:
and that he meant to come in person
into Fraunce, where himselfe would
cause a solemne Masse to be song at
his Churching: and that for lights, he
would prouide a thousand Torches
without waxe, whose s
                     •

               Of the letters of promise which the same
William Duke of Normandie, sent
vnto the Earle of Flanders.
               THe same VVilliam Duke of Normandie
hauing a determinatiō,
to make a conquest of England, as being
his right, in that it was giuen vnto
him by king Edvvard the Confessour:
he required diuerse great Princes
of Fraunce and elsewhere to aide
him in that enterprize both with mē
and mony. Amongst others he prayed
the Earle of Flaunders (whose sister
he had marryed) to aide him in
that exploit. The Earle demaunded
of him, what part he should haue in
the kingdome of England, if the duke
should conquer it
                     •
                  . The duke answered
him: That he would send him
wor
                     •
                   thereof in writing. After which
the Duke being now readie to depart

out of Normandie vpon his intended
voyage, he caused a faire peece of
white parchment without any writing
within it, to be folded and closed
vp in forme of a letter: vpon the
which for an inscription, he caused to
be written these two verses: sending
them in way of a scoffe to the Earle
of Flaunders:
               
               
                  Beaufrere, d'Angleterre aurez
                  Ce que cy dedans trouuerez.

               Another conceipt of VVilliam the Conquerour,
at his landing in England.
               VVHen the same Duke had
passed the seas to the conquest
of England, the first fortune
that befell him in his landing, was:
that in leaping out of his shippe, he
fell flat vpon the sands, and the first
part of his bodie that touched the
ground were his hands. The which

accident some of his people interpreting
to be a signe of ill fortune:

and it is his wil that I shal take it with
both my hands: because by the aide
both of him and you, I make no
doubt but to conquer it. And his successe
was answerable to his hope: for
he came to be king, and left the
Crowne of England to his posterity.

Baldvvin Earle of Mons in Heynault,
pretending right thereunto, said vnto
the King: That he had wrong done
him: for that the Earledome did appertaine
vnto him. He demaunded
with great instance to haue the combat
graunted him against those that
should dare to auerre the contrarie.
The king said vnto him: It is against

me thē that you must haue the combat:
for the Seignorie which you
claime and striue for, is mine owne
proper right and inheritance.
               He that contendeth against his Lord and

               A braue speech of king Levvis the grosse.
               THe same king of Fraunce taking
part with Hely Earle of Maine,
against Henry king of England in a
certaine battell fought between thē,
found himselfe farre seuered frō his
people. A certain English knight seeing
him, and being in hope to make
himselfe rich by taking the king prisoner,
he laid hold vpon the reines of
the kings horse with intēt to stay him
and began to cry with a loud voice:
The King is taken. The king being
valiant and of a noble courage, at one
blow with his sword ouerthrew the
knight dead to the ground: & seeing
him fall, he said: It is not one man alone,
that in Chesse play, can giue the
king the mate.
            
            
               
               Of an inuention found by king Levvis,
to punish the Earle of Vermandois.
               
                  LEvvis king of Fraunce, the sonne
of king Charles the simple, desiring
to be reuenged for the death of
his said father, who dyed in the castle
of Peronne, being there imprisoned by
H
                        •
                     bert the Earle of Vermandois his
subiect: And being at Laudun with a
great assembly of the Lords and Nobles
of Fraunce, whom he had reconciled
vnto him, he vsed a fine deuice
to bring about his purpose: for he
had caused one to be attired like an
Englishman, who being well instructed
in that which he had to do, came
i
                     •
                  post to the Court, and required to
be instantly admitted to the presence
of the kings Councell, for the deliuerie
of certaine letters to the king frō
the king of England. The partie being
entred into the Councell chamber,
presented the letters to the king,
which himselfe had before caused to
be written And as the Secretarie read
them to the King with a soft and low

voyce, the King began to smile:
wherof the Princes and Lords there
present demaunded the occasion.
Now I see well (quoth the King) that
the English are not a people of any
great wisedome: for our cousin Harmant
king of England hath written
me here: that there is in his countrey
a labouring man, who hauing inuited
his maister to his house to dine
with him, caused him to be slaine: &
he hath sent to demaund your counsell
(my maisters) what punishment
this fellow hath deserued. Thibaut
Earle of Bloys was the first that gaue
his sentence, saying: That albeit the
man was worthie of many grieuous
torments, yet the most ignominious
and shameful death that he could adiudge
him, was, that he ought to be
hanged and strangled on a Gibbet.
To this sentence all the rest of the
Lords there present did consent: and
the County Hebert of Vermandois also
who had no sooner ended his speech,
but he was apprehended by the kings
Officers, there prouided in a readinesse.
And the King said vnto him:

                  Hebert, thou art this wicked labourer,
which hast caused thy Lord and
maister the king Charles my father to
be put to death: now therefore receiue
the punishment which thou
hast iustly deserued, and which thou
hast denounced against thy self. This
said, Hebert was hanged on a Gibbet
vpon the toppe of a mountaine nere
Lodun: which at this day is commonly
called mount Hebert.
               
            
            
               Of the wine which Philip Augustus king
of Fraunce presented to the Barons
and Captaines of his army.
               
                  PHilip Augustus king of France, cō
                  ducting
his armie against the
Emperour Otho in the yeare 1214. &
being by necessitie constrained to
ioyne battell with him: he tooke a
great cup or bowle of gold, which he
caused to be filled with wine & sops
of bread. After turning himself to the
Princes and great Lords of Fraunce
which were with him, he said vnto
them: My friends and companions in
Armes: you which are resolued to
liue and dye with me this day: take
ech of you one of these lops of bread

dipt in wine, and eate the same as I
haue done before you. He had no
sooner spoken the word, but the cup
was emptie in an instant. And immediatly
the battell being ioyned, he
gained the victorie at Bouines, where
the Emperour was put to flight: and
the Earle of Flanders with diuerse other
great Lords remained prisoners.
            
            
               The titles vvhich the king Saint Levvis
of Fraunce gaue himselfe.
               THe king S. Levvis being demanded
by certain of his Lords, with
what title he would chuse to be honoured
in imitation of the old Romane
Emperors, and of other forrain
kings, & the kings of France his predecessors:
who for some notable acts
or victories had purchased vnto thē
                  selues
diuerse titles of honours, he
answered: the greatest victorie which
I euer obtained was against the diuel,
at such time as I was baptized in the
church of Poissi. And therefore the
greatest honour which I would haue
done me, is: that men should cal me,
Levvis of Poissi.
               
            
            
               
               Of the same Levvis.
               A Certaine priuate friend of his
did blame him, for that in writing
his priuate and familiar letters,
he did not entitle himselfe king of
Fraunce, but Loys of Poissi. To whom
he said: I am like the king which mē
chuse with the Beane at Twelfetide,
who commonly doth obserue the
feast of his royaltie in the euening.
               His meaning vvas, that the Crovvne
vvhich he expected vvas the kingdom
of heauen: and by the euening, he
meant the end of this mortall life.
            
            
               The desire that Saint Levvis had to cut
off all blasphemies out of his
kingdome.
               KIng Levvis hauing caused one
(who had blasphemed the name
of God) to be marked in the lippes
with a hote burning iron: and hearing
that some of his subiects did
murmure at it: he said openly in the
hearing of a great multitude: I wold

to God that I my selfe were so marked
with a hote iron on my lippes,
on the condition that there were no
oathes nor blasphemies vsed within
my realme
               Whensoeuer he began to speake
or to do any thing, and especially
when he was set in Councell, the first
thing he vsed to do, was to blesse
himsel
                     •
                  e with the signe of the Crosse,
in calling vpon the name of God. For
his saying was: that his mother had so
taught him euen from his infancie.
            
            
               Of the instructions vvhich the king Saint
Levvis of Fraunce gaue vnto his
sonne Philip.
               MY sonne, the first lesson which
I giue thee is: To loue God
with all thy hart, with all thy strēgth,
and with all thy soule.
               Offend not God in any case.
               Suffer any torments rather then sin.
               Take patiently whatsoeuer aduersitie
God shall send thee: and thanke
God for it, acknowledging that thou
hast deserued it.

Confesse thy selfe often to some
good man, a Minister of the church.
               Be diligēt to heare the deuine Seruice
song in the Church of God.
               Obserue carefully the good customes
of thy kingdome: but take away
such as are euill.
               Raise not any Taxes or Tallages
vpon thy subiects, but vpon great necessitie.
               Entertaine those into thy seruice
who feare God: loue iustice and hate
couetousnesse.
               Desire not that thy Iudges should
giue iudgement for thee in any cause
against thy subiects, farther then reason
and truth will iustifie.
               Preserue the cities and townes of
thy kingdome in their franchises and
liberties, wherein thy predecessours
before thee, haue maintained
them.
               Giue the Benefices and Offices of
thy kingdom to good men, and such
as are capable of them.
               Moue not warre against any Christian:
and if any offence be committed,
thou oughtest to pardon it being

required.
               In places of iustice and iudgment
see thou prouide such as are good
men and godly.
               Make diligent enquirie of thy houshold
seruants, whether they be addicted
to couetousnesse or to prodigalitie.
               Be thou such a one in thy life and
conuersation, as men may take good
example by thee. For as the head is,
such commonly are the members.
               Take good heede that the expences
of thy house be moderate and in
measure.
               And the blessing of God be alwaies
with thee.
            
            
               A notable saying of Philip the faire, king
of Fraunce.
               
                  PHilip le bel, king of Fraunce, hauing
a certaine quarrell against
Pope Boniface the eight: (wherof hath
bene before spoken) and being vrged
by some to take reuenge of the Bishop
of Palmers, who was the principall
procurer and perswader of the
contentiō between thē: he made thē
                  
this answere: That it was a greater
glorie for any Prince of courage and
magnanimitie to pardon those of
whom he might easily take reuenge,
then to execute reuenge vpon them.
            
            
               Of king Philip de Valois, vvho confirmed
the lavv Salique by the
Scriptures.
               
                  CHarles le bel, king of Faunce, being
deceased without heire
male, Edvvard the third king of England,
intitled himselfe King and inheritour
of Fraunce, in the right of
his mother Isabel, sister to the said
king Charles. Philip de Valois being
the next heire male, opposed himself
against the title of king Edvvard, and
obtained the kingdome by colour
of the law Salique which excludeth
women from the Crowne of France:
and (as the common saying of the
French is) suffereth it not to fall to the
distaffe. And amongst many authorities
cited for the iustification of that
law, he alleadged for one these words
of the holy Scripture: Consider the Lilies

of the field, hovv they do grovv, and
do neither labour nor spinne.
               
            
            
               Of the Latin verses, vvhich king Edvvard
and king Philip de Valois
sent each to other.

of Fraunce with those of England, &
had ioyned the three flowers Deluce

these foure verses: which howsoeuer
they might be thought of in
that age, at this day are held but barbarous:

king Philip replyed in other sixe
as good stuffe as the former.

               The ansvver of king Edvvard the third,
to those that required him to send
aide to his sonne the black
Prince at the battell
of Cressie.
               THe same Edvvard king of England,
in the field foughten betweene
the armie of England, and the
French power vnder Philip de Valois
at the battell of Cressie in Ponthieu:
(where the French had a notable ouerthrow)
being told by an English
knight: that his sonne the Prince of
VVales (who had the conduct of the
maine battell of the English,) and the
Noblemen (which were there with
him) were very fiercely assailed by

the French, and did desire his Maiestie
to come to their succour with the
Reareward, whereof the king himselfe
had the leading. The king demaunded
of the knight, saying: Is my
sonne dead, or hurt, or striken down.
No Sir, (said the knight) but he is
hardly bestead. Returne then (quoth
the king) to them that sent you hither,
and tell them: That my pleasure
is, they send no more to me for
any aide, as long as my sonne is liuing:
but let him alone this day win
his spurres. For (if God so will) my
meaning is, that the honour of this
day shall be his. This message did so
encourage the English, that they caryed
away the victorie.
               By vvinning of his spurres he meant, he
should get him the honour of a hardie
Knight: because one of the Ceremonies
at the dubbing of a new Knight, is to
tye on a paire of gilt spurres.
            
            
               Of tvvo Latine verses made by king
Philip de valois, against
king Edvvard.
               
                  
BEcause king Edvvard was supposed
contrarie to his faith and allegiance,
to haue inuaded the realme
of Fraunce: king Philip to taxe him
with it, made these two verses.

                     Anglicus Angelus est, cui nunquam credere
fas est▪
                     
                     Dum tibi dicit aue tanquā ab hoste caue.
                  
               
               Howbeit some say, that this was
Pope Alexander the third, at such time
as the English went to Rome, to excuse
and purge themselues to the Pope,
of the death of Saint Thomas of Canterburie,
whome they had caused to
be slaine.
            
            
               The bold speech of Blaunch the daughter
of king Charles the faire.
               THe same king Philip on a time
speaking very bitterly to the Ladie
Blaunch, Duchesse of Orleance,
daughter of king Charles the faire,
touching the succession of the realm
of Fraunce: she said vnto him very liberally
and boldly: Sir, if I had had
a paire of stones, you durst not haue
vsed those wordes which you haue

now vttered, but you had smarted
for it.
               Meaning, that if she had bene a man, as
she vvas a vvoman, she should haue
bene king of Fraunce.
            
            
               The speech of king Iohn of Fraunce to the
Prince of VVales, vvhen he vvas
taken at the batell
of Poytiers.
               
                  IOhn king of Fraunce being prisoner
in the battell of Poytiers to the
Prince of VVales, was conducted to
the English campe, where his supper
was prepared for him, at the which
the Prince serued him with his head
vncouered. The king prayed him diuerse
times to sit downe with him:
but the Prince excused himselfe, saying:
that it did not beseeme the vassal
to sit nere his Lord. The king said
vnto him: my purpose was to haue
bestowed a supper on you this night:
but the fortune of warre would that
you should giue it me.
            
            
               The cautelous answer of king Edward
to king Iohn.
               
                  
IN the time of truce accorded betweene
Iohn king of Fraunce, and
Edward king of England: the English
men for a summe of money got by
composition the castle and towne of
Guines to be rendred vnto thē: whereof
king Iohn being aggrieued, complained
to the king of England: and
told him that he had brokē the truce
contrary to the compact betweene
them: whereunto king Edward made
this answer: I haue not (quoth he) broken
the truce: for there was not any
article contained in the Treatie betweene
vs, that did prohibite or defend
vs, from traffiquing together, or
to debarre vs or our subiects from the
trade of merchandize each with
other.
            
            
               The commendations which Edvvard
king of England, gaue to Charles
the fifth king of Fraunce.
               THe same king Edvvard hauing
taken the seas with a fleete of
ships, wherein were foure thousand
launces, and eleuen thousand Archers,

with intent to go and raise the
siege of the French before Tours in
Aquitaine: he had the wind so contrarie,
that he could not proceede nor
prosecute his intended voyage into
Fraunce: wherefore returning much
discontented into England, he vsed
these or such like words of king
Charles the fifth. There was neuer yet
(said he) any king in Fraunce, who
vsed lesse to beare Armes then this
Prince: and that without once stirring
out of his chamber, but onely
by sending and writing of letters, did
so much trouble his enemies, or my
selfe either, as he hath done.
            
            
               The Cartels which Henry king of England,
and the duke of Orleance
sent to each other.

king Charles the fifth, after that
the truce was accorded betweene the
French king Charles the sixth, and
Henry of Lancaster king of England,
the said Duke being young of yeres
and desirous of glory (contrarie to

the alliance which was made with
the said king of England, sent vnto
him a Cartell of Armes with a chalenge
of combate betweene them
two, and a hundreth Knights on ech
partie: who for the loue of their Ladies
should trye their valour and
prowesse each against other: and that
they which did best should haue the
honour of the victorie. Vnto which
Cartell the king of England made
this answer: We are not determined
to breake the truce, much lesse will
we violate or disanull the league of
amitie and alliance made betweene
vs: neither do we meane to admit any
equalitie betweene our royall Maiestie
and your Lordship. Howbeit seeing
you are disposed to combat, I can
be content to accept and make it
good man to man, to the intent we
may auoid effusion of bloud, and not
either for our Ladies or for vaine
glorie: but onely for the honour, increase,
and preseruation of our
Realmes, Countries, Territories and
Dominions.
               The true valour and magnanimitie of

men is not to hazard their persons
and liues: but onely for the good of
their countrey, or for their honour, or
for the safetie of their liues.
            
            
               The Oath vsed to be taken by the English
men to their King, at their
going to the warres.
               
                  FRoissard reporteth: that when the
English in former times came into
Fraunce to make warres, they had
this custome: that the Captaines putting
their hands into the handes
of the king of England, did solemnly
sweare to obserue inuiolably
these two things: The one was, that
to no man liuing, but to & amongst
themselues they would neuer reueale
the secrets of their voyage and enterprize.
And the second: that they wold
neuer make nor consent to any treatie
or accord with their ene

               The choise of king Charles the sixth.
               
                  CHarles the fifth on a time hauing
shewed vnto his son (afterwards

called Charles the sixth) a Crowne of
gold richly set with precious stones,
and a helmet of steele faire gilt: demaunded
of him which of these two
he would most willingly haue, if he
were put to make his choise. His answer
was: that he would rather chuse
the Helmet then the Crowne. The
like affection did he bewray at his
new comming to the Crowne of
Fraunce. For when the Officers of his
house shewed him the rich treasures
and precious moueables of his father
lately deceased: and did afterwards
bring him to the sight of the
goodly Armories, wherein were all
sorts of Armes, swords, Corcelets,
Headpeeces, and other furnitures fit
for the warres, he said all aloft: Of the
two (quoth he) I had rather haue
these Armes, then the riches which
my father hath left me.
            
            
               The Sayings and Sentences of king Lewis
the eleuenth.
               KIng Lewis the eleuenth, after the
battell of Mountleherry, against

the Count of Charolois, bethinking
himselfe of the Duchie of Burgundie,
and how the same was aliened in fee
from the Crowne of Fraunce, to the
auncestours of the said Count of Charolois
Dukes of Burgundie, descended
of a younger sonne of the bloud royall
of Fraunce: he brake into these
speeches: Men say (quoth he) that
Charles the fifth, was called Charles the
sage: but they had little reason to
tearme him so: for it was but a foolish
part to giue vnto his youngest
brother the Duchie of Burgundy for
an inheritance: hauing giuen him
therewithall Margret the sole daughter
and heire of Flaunders to his wife.
               After the said battell of Mountleherie,
one told him that his enemie the
County of Charolois did passe the
night following in the place where
the battell was foughten. No maruel
(quoth the king) if he remaine and
lodge in the fields, seeing he hath
neither Towne nor Castle to retire
vnto.
               He was wont to say: That where
pride rideth afore, shame and dishonour

do follow after.
               He being on a day at Masse in a
church of Chanons, he was told that
one of the Chanons was that day departed:
whereupon casting his eye
aside, and perceiuing a simple Priest
which lay sleeping in a Chappel therby
adioyning: he said: I do giue this
Prebend to that fellow that lyeth
there: because he shall say hereafter,
that his wealth and good fortune
came vnto him sleeping.
               THe Capitaine Maran making his
repaire to the Court of this king
Levvis, with purpose to aduertise him
of the exploits which he had done at
Cambray, he wore about his necke a
rich collar or chaine of gold, which
(as the reportwe
                     •
                  t) had bene made
of the reliques of the church of Cambray.
And as a certaine Gentleman
standing by, was readie to handle the
said collar: the King said vnto the
Gentleman: Beware and take good
heede sir how you touch that chaine:
for I can tell you it is a holy thing.
               By this saying he taxed the Captaine

with sacriledge, wherevvith souldiers
should not be tainted: because in sacking
of any place, all holy things are
to be spared.
               THe Archbishop of Tours talking
familiarly with him, of the great
troubles which he had at the beginning
of his raigne, against the Princes
of Fraunce: he said vnto him: If I
had not caused my selfe to be feared,
and shewed my self both of courage
and experience, I might well haue
bene put in the last chapter of Boccace
his booke, where he intreateth of vnhappie
and vnfortunate Princes.
               HAuing heard it reported, how
Nicholas Raulin the Chauncelor
of the duke of Burgundie, a man of
excessiue wealth & riches, had founded
at Beaune in Burgundy a goodly
Hospital, that did excell, both for the
statelinesse of the building, and for
the sumptuousnesse of the mouables
wherewith it was furnished: he said:
There is great reason, that the Chancelour
of Burgundie, which in his life

time hath made many a man poore'
should at his latter end make an Hospitall,
where to nourish and lodge
them.
               THe said king Levvis being vnwilling
that his sonne Charles the
eighth should apply his mind to learning:
he said: That the time which
was spent in studie, ought to be employed
rather in the care of gouerning
the kingdome and commonwealth:
and that he which should betake
himselfe to studie and learning,
by the vse thereof would become 
                     •
                  imerous
and lesse hardie to vndertake
great affaires: because in taking example
of others out of histories, he
would not dare to enterprize any action
of importance, the execution
whereof might be doubtfull and vncertaine.
               He was wont to say: That he which
knew not how to dissemble, was altogether
vnskilfull how to rule and
gouerne.
               One of the Pages of his chamber
hauing taken a louse from off his

garment: he said: This sheweth that I
am a man as others are.
               One comming to tell him, that the
Genowaies had a disposition to yeeld
themselues vnder his protection: he
answered: They shall not long remaine
vnder me: for I bequeath thē
to the Diuell.
               The said king Lewis being determined
to send an Ambassador to the
Venetians: he conferred with his
Councell, whom he might choose as
most fit and proper to dispatch that
seruice. A certaine Nobleman naming
one vnto him that was his near
kinsman, and whom he was willing
to aduaunce: the King demaunded
of him: what kind of man he was.
The Nobleman answered: Sir, he is
Bishop of such a place: Abbot of such
a Monasterie: Lord of such a Seignorie:
and so curiously discouered al his
qualities and Seignories. The King
alluding to the briefe maner of writing
then vsed, said: There where are
so many titles, is litle learning or
none at all.
               
                  
A Certaine great personage hauing
told him how he was alwaies
troubled with the Gowte, whilest
he hued at ease, with good and
daintie fare, and rich clothing; and
that afterwards when he began to accustome
himselfe to trauell and take
paines, to fare grosly, & to go coursly
clad: that then the gowte began
to leaue him, the King said: and I
for my part will neuer from hencefoorth
weare other clothes then of
cloth: for that the gowt doth sooner
take hold of silke then of wooll.
               He had a saying: That there was
not any thing whatsoeuer but he cold
find it both in his kingdome, yea and
in his house, saue onely one thing▪
And being demaunded by a great
Lord: what thing that was: he answered:
It was truth. For I remember
(said he) that my late Lord and father
was wont to say: That in his
time truth was sicke: but I think that
now it is sta

had any ghostly father to cōfesse
her at her death.
               
                  
A certaine Nobleman demaunded
of him, how much the kingdom
of Fraunce was worth in a yeare? he
answered: My Realme is a medow,
which I cut both euery yeare, and as
often as I list.
               A certaine meane person of base
condition following the Court of
king Lewis, and yet not knowing the
king when he saw him: it happened
that one day the king aduising him,
asked him what he gained by following
the Court. The fellow answered:
I gaine as much as the king:
for both he and I liue of God his
bountie: and at our departure out of
this world he shal haue no more with
him then I shall. The King esteeming
well of the speech of the man, made
him one of the Pages of his chamber.
            
            
               The life of men is different: but the end
of all is common and alike.
               BEing told that a certaine great
personage had a goodly Library,
and a great number of faire bookes:
he said: Then may he well be resembled

to a man that is crooke backed,
who caryeth his great bosse behind
him at his backe and neuer seeth it.
By this saying he taxed the partie both of
curiositie and ignorance.
               
               VVHensoeuer he had neede or
occasion to employ any mā
in his affaires, he would gaine them
to do it with rewards and store of
gold▪ For he was wont to say: that
when a man fighteth with siluer lances,
he commonly caryeth away the
victoria.
               HE vsed to say: That many times
too great seruices done to Princes,
did cause the losse of them that
did the seruice, for that most commonly
they are recompenced with
great ingratitude. Howbeit, that it
might happen by the default of the
parties themselues, who in regard of
their great seruice, do vse their good
fortune with ouermuch arrogancie,
both towards their Lords, and towards
their friends and equals.
               He said moreouer: that to get to
wealth and preferment in Court: it is

a more happie thing for a man to
receiue of his Prince benefits exceeding
farre beyond his desert, then
that his desert and seruice should be
greater then the recompence, wherby
his Prince should remaine indebted,
& (as it were) bound vnto him.
For I (quoth he) do more naturally
loue those that are beholding vnto
me, thē those to whō I am beholding
               AFter the enterview between him
and Edward the fourth king of
England at Piqu
                        •
                     nie, where a peace
was accorded between them for nine
yeares: as he returned he said to som
of his familiars: I like not very well
of the company of the king of Englād
on this side the seas: but being beyōd
the sea at home in his owne country,
I can well loue him as my brother
and my good friend.
               Hauing caused a goodly Tombe
or Sepulture to be made in the castle
of Loc
                        •
                     es for the faire ladie Agnes, the
loue of his late father
                     •
                   within a while
after, the Chanons of the church did
desire him that the Tombe might be

remoued out of the heart of the
Church, and set in a side Isle or chappell:
he answered: Your request is
neither iust nor reasonable: neither
will I suffer her Sepulture (whom my
father loued so affectionately) to be
violated: for it should be against all
law and equitie.
               He being to make his entrie into
Hesdin, whilst execution was in doing
vpon certaine of the principall
Gouernours and Burgesses of Arras
his enemies, which were some two
and twentie in number: and eighteen
of them being executed, he caused
the execution to cease: and demaunding
if M. Oudard de Bussi were beheaded
or not: and answer being made,
that he was: and that al the bodies of
the parties beheaded were buried: he
commaunded the head of the said de
Bussi to be againe digged vp: & caused
a high pole of wood to be set vp
in the middest of the market place,
vpon the which he caused the head of
the dead partie to be placed, couered
with a Cap of scarlet furred with Miniuere,
as of one that had bene a

Councellour of the Parliament. He
held him in very great reputation, because
he had bene a most prudent &
wise man, and of sound iudgement
in graue and waightie affaires. And
he would once haue giuen the said
Nobleman the office of Councellor
in the Parliament of Paris: but the
said Bussi being not willing to accept
of it in his life time, he did him this
honour after his death.
               A certaine person was a suter to
him for an Office which was void in
the towne where he dwelt: which the
king refused to graunt vnto him: insomuch
as the partie was out of all
hope to obtaine it: howbeit he humbly
thanked the king & so departed.
King Lewis iudging the man to be of
no meane spirit, and surmizing that
he had not well vnderstood what he
had said vnto him, caused him to be
called backe againe, and asked him
if he had conceiued aright of his answer:
the partie said: Yea sir. Why,
what said I vnto thee? (quoth the
king) You denyed me my sute (said
he) Why didst thou thanke me then

replyed the king? Because Sir (quoth
he) you did me a greater pleasure thē
you thought of, in giuing me my dispatch
so speedily, without causing me
to loose my time in comming after
you vpon vaine and idle hopes. The
King holding himselfe highly satisfied,
and taking great contentment
by this answer, granted him the Office,
and caused his Patent to be made
immediatly.
            
            
               An Apotheg of Monsieur Bresay,
to king Lewis the
eleuenth.
               THe same King being to ride on
hunting, mounted on a very little
horse: Monsieur Peter de Bresay Seneshall
of Normandie who accompanied
him, asked him where he had
gotten that so goodly and so stout a
horse. How meane you that (quoth
the King) seeing he is so weakean
                     •
                  d
so litle? Me thinkes (said de Bresay)
he must needes be very strong, because
he caryeth you with all your
counsell.
               
                  
He taxed the king, in that he would manie
times beleeue no other counsel thē
his ovvne, being vvise in his ovvne
conceipt: vvhich sometimes he repented.
            
            
               The counsell of the said Monsieur de
Bresaie to the said King.
               THe Embassadours of the king of
England, hauing on a time deliuered
their charge to king Levvis:
he demaunded of Monsieur de Bresay
his opinion, what thing he might bestow
vpon the Ambassadours which
might not cost him much: who answered
him: Sir, you were best to
present them with your Musitians: for
they cost you much, and are chargeable
vnto you: they do you litle or no
seruice, neither do you take any
great pleasure in them.
            
            
               The death of the said Seigneur de Bresay.
               IN the battell foughten betweene
Levvis the eleuenth, and the Countie
de Charolois neare mount Leherie:
                  
the said King (as his custome was to
speake hastily) said vnto Seignor de
Bresay, that he had no great trust nor
affiance in him for that iourney. Sir,
answered de Bresay, because you shall
well see that I am your loyall and
faithfull seruant, giue me your coat
Armour that I may weare it: for you
know your enemies aime at nothing
more then the destruction of your
person, and it may happen to saue
your life. Whereupon the king and
he exchaunged both Armes and En
signes. And the Burgonians supposing
that de Bresay (whom they saw in the
middest of the presse) had bene the
king: they charged furiously in vpon
him, and so slue him.
            
            
               Of king Charles the eighth, who gaue an
answer to the Florentines in tvvo
Italian verses.
               KIng Charles the eighth being in
Italie on the conquest of Naples,
the Florentines sent an Embassade
vnto his Maiestie: the king reposing
no trust in them, for their answere

caused two Italian verses to be read
vnto them which he had written vpō
a wall in great letters: and were
these.

                     Concortesiae fede poca.
                     Va a Fiorence vender loca.
                  
Which is to say:

                     To Florence he went of his goose to
make sale,
                     Without any faith or courtesie at all.
                  
               
               The argument of which two verses
was this: A pesant of the country
neare Florence, sold a goose to a braue
dame of Florence, onely to haue his
pleasure of her: which hauing had,
yet notwithstanding in his agreemēt
he vsed so little fidelitie or courtesie
to the gentlewoman, as he exacted
the price of his goose in the presence
of her husba
                     •
                  d, so as she durst not
deny but to pay him. And thence had
this Italian Prouerbe his original
                     •
                  :
which king Charles pronounced to
the Embassadours for their answer.
            
            
               A speech of king Charles the eighth, touching
the keeping of his counsell.
               
                  
VVHen the said king Charles the
eighth meant to discouer any
secret to any man: he was wont
to say vnto him: If I thought that my
shirt next my backe knew it, I would
plucke it off and burne it.
            
            
               The speech of Queene Anne, vvife
to Charles the eighth.
               
                  CHarles the eighth being deceased,
and the tidings of his death
being brought to Queene Anne his
wife, she said: Gods will be done. For
my part I doubt not but I shall be as
great as I was before.
               She promised herselfe in her hopes to be
twise Queene of Fraunce, and so she
vvas: for she vvas aftervvards maried
to king Levvis the tvvelfth.
            
            
               A notable sentence of king Levvis
the tvvelfth.
               AFter that Levvis duke of Orleance
had attained to the Crowne of

                  Fraunce, some of his familiars did
perswade him to take vengeance vpon
them of Orleance, who had shut
the gates of their citie against him, at
such time as king Charles the eighth
made warre vpon him, and compelled
him to flie into Britaine. But the
said Levvis the twelfth of that name,
made them this worthy answer: It appertaineth
not any thing to the king
of Fraunce, to reuenge the iniuries
done to the duke of Orleance.
               
            
            
               Other vvorthie speeches of the
same King.
               THe said Prince making warre in
Italie for the recouerie of the
Duchie of Millaine: it was told him
that his enemies had taken Agnadel:
& that he wold come thither too late
to lodge in it. Whereunto he answered
with an hautie courage: Then wil
I lodge vpon their bellies, or els they
shall lodge vpon mine.
               Another came vnto him, saying: Sir,
take heed to yourselfe that the great

Ordinance do not annoy you. He answered:
There was neuer rightfull
king of Fraunce slaine with a shot of
a canon: therefore whosoeuer is afraid
let him come behind me.
               Another time the said king lying
in Campe, and a certaine souldier, a
man at armes which stoode neare
him, being slaine with a Canon shot,
some of the standers by shewing him
vnto the king: he said laughing: He is
but a little cold in his hands.
            
            
               His speech to certaine souldiers,
vvith the ansvver that
they made him.
               THe said king Levvis being determined
to leauie a certaine companie
of footemen, gaue commandement
that choise should be made
of the strongest and most able and
actiue men that could be found The
day appointed for the muster of thē
being come, there was presented vnto
him a goodly company of lustie
fellowes, who hauing bene trayned
vp in the warres, and carying diuerse

skarres and wounds vpon them, did
appeare to be old souldiers, whose
markes did testifie that they had not
lien idle nor vnemployed. The king
seeing them so hacked and hewed in
their bodies, said vnto their leaders:
Indeed these be good souldiers: but
it seemeth they haue bene more willing
to take then to giue: and those
men which gaue them these markes
in their faces and elsewhere, seemed
to be farre more expert in deedes of
Armes then these were. The souldiers
hearing the king to giue this cē
                  sure
of them, presently made him this
answer: Sir, (sauing our due reuerence
to your Maiestie) they were not better
men nor more valiant then we:
for if they hurt and wounded vs, we
slue them for their labours.
            
            
               A braue speech which he gaue
to a boaster.
               A Certaine Gentleman was very
importunate vpon king Lewis
the twelfth, to haue some reward and
recompence for the losses and dammages

which he had sustained in the
warres: & he shewed him the wounds
which he had receiued in his visage.
The king seeing him so rash and audacious:
and being disposed to paye
him home for his braue vaunting &
ostentation, said vnto him: Take heed
thou turne not back thy face another
time, when thou art flying from thy
enemie.
            
            
               His opinion of the Venetians.
               BEing resolued to make warre vpon
the Venetians, one of his nobles
would haue disswaded him from
it, telling him: That he could not do
it without great perill to the French:
and that the Venetians were a most
prudent and sage people. Be it so
(quoth the king:) yet we will set so
many fooles vpon them, who shall
so beard them to their teeth, as they
shall not know which way to turne
themselues.
               CErtaine Embassadours of Greece
being come to the French Court

to demaund succours of king Levvis
against the great Turke: and promising
on their part to do their best indeuours
to chase the Turkes out of
such places as they had possessed: the
king reposing little trust in this
strange Nation, excused himself touching
their request: and taxing the
nature of the Greekes, he alleadged
this verse of the old Grammarian Alexander
de ville Dieu.
               
               Barbara Graeca, genus retinent quod habere
solebant.
            
            
               A pleasant speech vvhich he spake to the
Lords of the Parliament.
               HAuing giuen a certaine office of
a Counsellour of the Parliament
to one that was none of the wisest,
the Court would not admit him into
their societie: but sent two Counsellours
of the Parliament chamber to
the king, to let him know the insufficiencie
of the man. The king hauing
heard them condemne the partie
of ignorance, demaunded of thē
this question: How many be there of

you in your Court? Sir, (said they)
there be an hundred. And how is it
(quoth the King) that you being so
many wise men together, cannot
make one to become wise?
            
            
               Another merie conceipt of
the same King.
               CErtaine Gentlemen of his Court
wondering at the vnmeasurable
stature of a Courtier, whome euery
man reputed in manner of a Giant:
the king taxing the honestie of his
parents, said: No maruell if he be so
exceeding great: for his mother took
great paines to make him, and perhaps
he had many fathers.
            
            
               Of a certaine Fable recited by him.
               BEing in familiar discourse with
the Ladies, he said vnto them: In
the beginning nature gaue hornes
aswell to the Hinds as to the Harts:
but the Hinds growing proud to see
thēselues haue so goodly heads, they
began to rebell against the Harts:

wherewith nature being displeased,
and willing to represse their arrogancie
and pride, and reduce them to the
subiection of the males, she depriued
them of their hornes: so that neuer
afterwards they wore any.
            
            
               By this fable, he gaue the Ladies to vnderstand,
that it vvas their dutie to
be obedient to their husbands.
               BEing one day in talk with Francis
Duke of Angolesme, his son in law
who expected the Crown of France,
as of right after his decease it was to
come vnto him: he told him this parable:
A certaine father (quoth he)
trauelling with his sonne on the way,
held on their course to come vnto a
good towne: the sonne being very
wearie, by reason of the length of the
way, yet perceiuing a farre off the
turrets and wals of the towne, very
chearefully said vnto his father: Father,
me thinkes I am now somwhat
fresh, for we are euen at the towne alreadie.
After these words, they went
on so long, that it was full night notwithstanding,
ere they got to the

towne: where being readie to enter,
the father said vnto his sonne: From
hencefoorth sonne, neuer say: I am at
the towne, till thou hast gotten past
the gates.
            
            
               His speech of beneficed persons.
               HE was wont to say: That the Asses
had a better world then the
horses: for the horses (said he) do
runne post towards Rome, to get those
Benefices, whereof many asses are
possessed.
            
            
               An Apotheg of the said king.
               A Motion being made vnto him
on a time to marie the Ladi
                     •
                  
                  Claude his daughter to some straunge
Prince: he answered: No (quoth he)
I will neuer make any other alliance,
then with the Cats and Mice of my
owne kingdome.
            
            
               A Princely speech of king
Frauncis.
               
                  
KIng Frauncis the first of that
name, to one that demaunded
pardon for another man that had vsed
ill speeches of his Maiestie, said:
Let him for whome thou art a suter,
learne to speake little, and I will
learne to pardon much.
            
            
               A speech of the same king touching
Religion.
               IN an Oration which he made on a
time at Paris in the presence of his
Princes and Nobles against the Heretickes,
with intent to purge his
realme of them, amongst other
words, he vsed this speech: If I knew
that my arme were infected with
that contagion, I would cut it off &
separate it from my bodie, and cast
it into the fire.
            
            
               The opinion vvhich he had of
Noblemen.
               HE was wont to say: that it much
grieued him, that the Gentlemē
                  
of his Realm did not giue themselues
to the studie and exercise of letters, to
the intent he might prouide them of
the dignities and Offices appertaining
to the long robe. For he was
perswaded, that that kind of men did
do him the best seruice: and that they
ought to be lesse enclined to dishonest
actions, then men of meane parentage
and base condition.
            
            
               An excellent Apothegme of the
same king.
               THere being a purpose of a treatie
of peace betweene the Emperour
Charles the fifth, and the said
king Frauncis, and being euen vpon
the point to conclude it, he said: It is
not possible that we can long continue
in peace and amitie: because the
Emperour cannot abide any equall
or companion: and I can lesse endure
to haue any man to my maister.
            
            
               Of Pope Benedict the twelfth, and
his Epitaph.
               
                  
POpe Benedict the twelfth was one
that loued peace, and vsed to say:
that he would neuer vse the sword against
any person, because it was not
belonging to his place and calling.
He made many good decrees and
constitutions: and amongst others
prohibited religious persons to go
to Rome to sue for Benefices: notwithstanding
after his death, whether
it were right or wrong, or vpon hatred:
some made this Epitaph of
him.

                     Hic, silus est Nero, laicis mors, Vipera
clero,
                     Deuius á vero: cupa repleta mero.
                  
Which is to say:

                     Here lyeth a Nero: to the laity a cruel
tyrant: to the Cleargy a viper:
                     To truth a mortall enemy: and a notable
wine bibber.
                  
               
            
            
               A mocke of the Flemmings
to king Philip.
               IN the yeare, a thousand, three hundred,
twenty and eight, the king

                  Philip de Valois in the quarrell and
behalfe of the Earle of Fla
                        •
                     ders, gaue
battell to the Flemings at Mount Cassell,
where were slaine of the said Flemings
19800. who before the conflict,
seeing the mightie Armie and
puissance of the king, very arrogantly
caused the picture of a great cocke
to be painted vpon a great peece of
cloth, about the which was written
this Distichon:

                     VVhen this cocke shall happen to
crovv,
                     The king shall here enter, and not
before I trovv.
                  
               
               But this mocke cost them deare:
for they sustained a bitter ouerthrow
that same day.
            
            
               Princely sayings and sentences of Alphonsus
king of Naples.
               
                  ALphonsus surnamed the couragious,
the 17. king of Aragon,
and king of both Sicilies, hearing it
reported how one of the kings of
Spain was wont to say: that it was not
decent nor conuenient for a Prince,

or great personage to be learned: he
said: This speech was not the speech
of a man, but of an Asse crowned.
               One day as he sate at supper, a certaine
old man being a suter vnto him
for some thing, which importuned
him exceedingly & beyond all measure
to haue his petition graunted
him: in somuch as the king could not
eate his meat quietly, so troublesome
was this fellow vnto him. Whereupo
he brake into these speeches: Assuredly
I see that the state and conditiō
of Asses is better then this of Princes:
for their maisters do allow thē time
and leasure to eate: but kings cannot
obtaine so much of their subiects.
               A certaine knight being imprisoned
for debt, who for a long time
had bene a prodigall and great spender,
and had liued voluptuously vpon
the goods of diuerse Merchants and
others, to whom he was become indebted:
some of the friends of the
said knight became instant suppliants
to the king, that he wold not permit
the knight to be charged for the paiment
of his debts. To whō the king

answered: Seeing this knight hath
not consumed himselfe, nor runne
into debt for my seruice, nor for the
good and benefite of his country, nor
for his owne friends and kinseflkes:
but hath spent and wasted all his
wealth for the pleasure of his owne
bodie: it is good reason that he suffer
the punishment of his prodigality
in his body.
               Being one day reproued for his
too too much clemency, and because
he many times pardoned those which
had bene most hainous offenders:
his answer was: That he did desire to
stand readie prepared (whensoeuer
it should please God to call him) to
yeeld an accompt of those sheepe
which were cōmitted to his charge:
and that when they should be demaunded
of him, he might render
them vp safe and sound.
               He had also an vsual saying, That by
executing of Iustice he got the loue
of good men: and by his clemencie,
he purchased the liking euen of the
wicked.
               To some which at another time

playned of his ouer great clemency
and humanitie: he said: That they
should consider and looke vpon the
gouernment of Lions and of Beares:
and that then they should soone see
that Clemencie was a qualitie proper
to man, but crueltie was proper to
brute beasts.
               He was wont likewise to say: That
he who knew not how to rule himself,
& tomaister his own affections,
was neither fit nor worthie to command
ouer others.
               He said, that flatterers were like
to wolues: for as the wolues by tickling
& scratching the Asses, do come
to eate and deuoure them: so flatterers
by their assentations & leasings,
do aime at nothing more, then to
worke mischiefe vnto Princes.
               The Ambassadours of a certaine
Prouince repairing vnto him, to
craue his aduice, to which of these
two famous Chieftaines, Frauncis
Sforce, & Nicholas Picinni they shold
gratifie with their friendship and amitie:
he answered: That it behoued
them both to receiue and entertaine

each of them in shew of friends: and
yet to take good heed to either of
them as to ehemies.
               Whereas there was growne a secret
hatred or dislike betweene the
said king Alphonsus & Cosmus de Medicis,
a man of principall regard and
authoritie in Florence: the said Cosmus
notwithstanding fent vnto the king
for a notable and singular present the
historie of Titus Liuius with a Commentarie,
because he well knew that
the King would take great pleasure
in it. The kings Phisitions being acquainted
herewithall, told him: that
he should do well not to reade in that
booke, but to take good heed of the
subtiltie of the Florentines: for (said
they) it is not good nor safe to trust
an enemie: and it may be that some
venimous and infectious poise
                     •
                  n is secretly
hidden either in the letters or
leaues of this booke, which may empoison
you as you are reading of it.
For all these disswasions the king opened
the booke, and hauing both
read therein, and turned it ouer in
many leaues each after other: he the

said vnto his Phisitions: Learne now
to leaue these fooleries, and know
this: that the spirit of a king doth not
gouerne it selfe by the iudgement of
priuate persons.
            
            
               Of a merrie conceipt vttered by
one to the king Alphonsus.
               THis king Alphonsus being well
knowne to be a prince that took
great pleasure and delight in good
speeches and wittie sayings well and
aptly placed: a certaine man of very
meane and base estate, came as a suter
vnto him, and said: Sir, do me iustice:
I haue a certaine creditour vnto
whom my late deceased father ought
a certain debt: and my father left me
nothing wherewith to pay him: howbeit
afterwards I payed this debt vnto
that creditour: who notwithstanding
demanded it of me againe with
great extremitie, and I payed it him
the second time: he not so content,
still demandeth of me the same debt
againe and againe, in somuch as

I haue many and oftentimes paid it,
and yet he pursueth me still for this
debt, as if he had not bene paid at all:
Now sir, I haue not any more left
wherewith to pay him: and if your
Highnesse do not helpe me to acquit
me of this creditour, I know not
what remedie to find for this mischiefe,
Beleeue me (quoth the king)
this is a most rigorous & cruell creditour:
Who is it? Sir, (said the poore
man) it is my belly, vnto whom I haue
so often paid the debt which is due
vnto him, as I haue nothing more
left to giue him: I humbly therefore
beseech your Highnesse in charitie to
help and releeue me to content him.
Why (quoth the King) I my self haue
euen such another like creditour as
thine. You say true, Sir, replyed the
poore man: but you (God be thanked)
haue wherewithall to satisfie
him, and I haue not. The king hearing
this request, and esteeming it to
proceede of a quicke and good inuention,
caused a certaine summe of
money to be deliuered vnto him.
            
            
               
               An answer vvhich Alphonsus made
vnto a Dreamer.
               A Certain person in the kings presence,
being in talke of dreames
and of their signification, there was
a pleasant Courtier who to trie the
king, told with a good grace before
all the company: how the night before
he dreamed a dreame, that the
King bestowed vpon him a bagge
full of duckats. Whereunto the king
presently answered: why foole, art
thou so very a beast as to thinke that
a Christian man ought to giue credit
to dreames?
               The same Alphonsus had a daughter
called Eugenia, who being maried
had no children: and one day it happened,
that she brought out of her
Coffer certaine Poppets which being
made very finely, caryed a resemblance
of excellent beautie, honestie
and gracious cariage: whereupon
Alphonsus said vnto her: O my daughter,
how much better had it bene
both for thy father, thy husband, and

thy self also, if thou haddest had children
of thy bodie so wise and vertuous,
as they might haue represented
the countenances of these l'oppets.
            
            
               The answer of Anthony Panormitane,
to king
Alphonsus.
               
                  ANthony of Panorm being demanded
by the king Alphonsus, what
things were most requisite and necessarie
to liue a ioyfull and peaceable
life in the estate of mariage, considering
that ordinarily it is full of troble
                     •
                  s,
vexations and discontentments:
He answered: that there are two
things most needfull. The first, that
the husband be deafe, not to vnderstand
the follies, the ill speeches, and
maner of his wiues behauiour. The
second, that the wife be blind, not to
see all the intemperate qualities
and misdemeanours of her husband.
            
            
               
               A speech vvhich he vsed to one
that had imbezilled
his rings.
               ON a time as he was readie to sit
downe at his table, being about
to wash his hands, he drew off his
fingers certaine rings of gold, which
were very rich and precious, and
gaue them to one that came first and
next to hand, not much heeding who
it was that tooke them. The partie to
whome the King deliuered them, for
that he did not againe demaund thē,
thought that he had forgotten them,
and therefore was easily drawn to retaine
them: which he did. And for
a long time after, seeing that the
matter was vnremembred, he then
kept them for altogether. But ere
the yeare was ended, the king being
readie another time to sit downe at
the table, the same man drew very
neare (for another booty) to the king,

and held out his hand to take his
rings of him as he had done before.
But the king rounding him in the
eare, said vnto him with a very soft
voice: Let it suffice thee to haue had
the former: for these may serue for
anothers turne.
               He said, that in the flourishing estate
of Rome, the Romanes had caused
to be built right ouer against their
Senatehouse, a temple which was dedicated
to Iupiter depositorie, wherein
before their entrie into the Senate,
the Senatours and Councellors of Estate
came to disrobe themselues of
all affections of loue, fauour, hatred,
vengeance, and other priuate
passions and affections.
               Seeing on a time a woman to
daunce and vault very high, with
great shamelesnesse and immodesty:
he said vnto the standers by: Stay awhile,
and you shall see Sibilla will
giue foorth her Oracles; noting
thereby, dauncing to be a kind of furie:
for the Sibils neuer gaue their
answers, but when they were surprized
with furie.
               
                  
A certaine Knight which had bene
taken prisoner in the warres, complained
him to the king Alphonsus
of his losses and misfortunes, and demaunded
of him many gifts, which
being exceeding great, yet by his
importunitie he obtained them. After
he was departed, the king said vnto
his familiars: I was in a feare, lest
this importunate fellow, would haue
begged my wife also from me.
               Another Courtier, who had very
prodigally spent many a gift, which
the king had bestowed on him, did
preffe him very vrgently to giue him
a certaine peece of money: to whom
the king said: If I should continue to
be thus liberall in giuing, I should
sooner impouerish my selfe then enrich
thee: for whosoeuer giueth thee
doth nothing else but powre water
into a Siue.
               Being demaunded, which of his
subiects he loued best: Those (quoth
he) who are more afraid for me
then of me.
               A Certaine Knight a Neapolitane,
                  
named Stephen, hauing many Offices
and places of great charge vnder the
king Alphonsus within his realme of
Naples: and being by meanes of an amorous
potion, bereft of the vse of
his senses, some of the Court begged
his Offices of the King: pretending
it to be a thing very vnfit and inconuenient
that such places should be
administred by one that was become
senslesse: to whom the King answered:
It were a very vncourteous and
inhumane act, to take away from
him his substance and meanes of liuing,
from whome fortune hath alre
adie taken his vnderstanding.
               He said, that those men seemed
vnto him meerely senslesse and void
of vnderstanding, who would seeke
to haue againe their wiues, which
had bene fled and seuered from
them.
               He said: that it were a very good
thing, if men would so ballance their
wils and affections, as they might
stand indifferent betweene loue and
feare: to the intent that when our
loue should constraine vs to exceed,

our feare might cause vs to retire, and
to draw to the contrarie.
               HEaring certaine labourers talking
together, and telling how
they had made apples, which by
their nature were very sowre, by industrie
and diligence to become very
sweete and pleasant: he said: So
ought we to do, that our people, citizens,
and subiects being rude peruerse
and euill minded, by our labor
and paines may be transformed and
chaunged into wise, prudent, and
good men.
               He was wont to say: that the greatest
argument which he had obserued
to proue the immortalitie of the
soule: was: That when we see our
bodies to decay and weare away, and
to approch neare to death, and that
when all our members beginne to
faile vs, euen then the powers and
vertues of the soule do increase, and
as it were grow stronger, and more
puissant in vnderstanding, vertue and
wisedome.
               
                  
Being one day hearing of Masse,
and the church in great daunger of
falling, by reason of a sudden earthquake:
the people there present began
to fly out of the church, and the
Priest made hast to be gone with
the foremost. But the king Alphonsus
stopping him, made him stay and
make an end of his Masse. Afterwards
being demaunded why in a
time of so great daunger and common
feare, he did not offer to shunne
and abandon the place: he answered
in great grauitie with this sentence
of Salomon out of Ecclesiastes:
                  Corda regum in manu Dei sunt.
               
               The harts of Kings are in the handes
of God.
               HE had a saying: that beauty most
commonly was a significant
signe and a token of a good and gentle
conuersation: as the flower is a
signe of the fruit.
               Hearing one tell: how Titus the
Romane Emperour was accustomed
to say: That in what day soeuer he
had not giuen some one gift or another,

he had lost that day, Alphonsus
said: That he thanked God, because
he in that respect had neuer lost one
day in all his life.
               He tooke so great pleasure & delight
in studying, and in reading of
Diuinitie: that he would many times
glorie, how he had read ouer the old
and new Testament fourteene times,
together with the gloses and Commentaries.
               He was wont oftentimes to say:
That he had not any better Councellours
then the dead. By the dead
he meant his bookes: and he caried
for his Ensigne and deuice a booke
open.
               He was a great louer of antiquities,
and of the auncient mettals and
monies of Princes, saying: That in
the viewing and beholding of them,
he seemed to grow the more inflamed
with the loue of vertue and of
glorie.
            
            
               Of the magnanimitie of Charles Martell:
as it is 
                     •
                  ritten of him in
his Epitaph.
               
                  
                  CHarles Martell, Maior of the
Pallace of the Crowne and kingdome
of Fraunce (which some say is
the Office of Constable) did make
foure kings in Fraunce each successiuely
after other: to wit: Childericke
called Daniel, Clotarius the fourth,
Theodorike the second, and Childericke
the third. This last Childericke offered
vnto the said Charles Martell the
Realme and Crowne of Fraunce, and
prayed him to take vpon him both
the name and the Diademe, which
he refused saying: That it was more
glorious to raigne and commaund
ouer kings, then to be a king: And in
his Epitaph is written this sentence:

                     Ille Brabantinus dux primus in orbe triumphat.
                     Malleus in mundo specialis Christicolarum,

               He was surnamed Martell, for the
the exceeding great strength of his
arme: & in memorie of the victories

which he obtained in diuerse battels.
            
            
               The iudgement of Sultan Soliman
the great Scigneur or Emperour
of Turkes.
               IN the citie of Constantinople a certaine
Christian desired to borrow
of a lew the some of fiue hundred
duckets. The lew lent them vnto him
with condition, that for the vse of the
money lent, he should at the end of
tearme giue him two ounces of his
flesh, cut off in some one of the mē
                  bers
of his bodie. The day of payment
being come, the Christian repayed
the fiue hundred duckets to
the lew, but refused to giue him any
part of his flesh. The lew not willing
to loose his interest, conuented the
Christian before the Grand Seigneur:
who hauing heard the demaund of
the one, and the answer of the other,
and iudging of the matter according
to equitie, commaunded a Razor to
be brought, and to be giuen to the
Iew, to whome he said: Because thou
shalt know that iustice is done thee:

take there and cut off of the flesh of
this Christian the two ounces which
thou demandest: but take heed thou
cut neither more nor lesse, for if thou
doe thou shalt surely dye. The Iewe
holding that to be a thing impossible,
durst not aduenture, but acquitted
the Christian of his interest.
            
            
               Of a writing which the king of Naples
caused to be engrauen vpon
his svvord.
               
                  ROger the second of that name,
king of Naples, held warres for a
long time with the Popes of Rome, by
reason of those Lands and Territories
which he pretended to be his by conquest.
And he had discomfited also
the king of Thunis in a battell at sea.
Of the which victories he did so glorie
and triumph, that he caused to be
engrauen on the blade of his sword
this verse.

hauing pilled the Churches
and Monasteries of his Realme, and
taking away their Chalices & other
Reliques of gold and siluer, which he
found in them, vsed these words: The

to eate, and it causeth Princes to
make good cheare.

                  SAladin king of Asia, of Syria, and
of Egypt shewed at his death, how
well he knew the life of man to be
most miserable. For he commaunded
that after his decease, the shirt
which he vsed▪ to weare, shold be caryed
vpon the top of a lance throughout
all his Campe in the open sight
of all his Nobles, Captaines & souldiers:
and that the party which shold
carie it, should cry with a loud voice:
Behold how Saladin the great Conquerour
and Commander of Asia, of
all those great riches and conquests
which he hath purchased, doth carry

nothing with him, saue this onely
peece of linnen
               The chiefest thing wherein men can iustly
triumph at their departure out of
this world, are their vertuous deeds.

tooke of some of his Nobles
that derided him.
               
                  RAymire the second of that name
king of Arragon, a very simple
man, being determined to make
warres vpon the Moores: his Barons
caused him to be armed and mounted
on horsebacke, and put a shield in
his left hand, and a launce in his right
hand: and offering to put the reines
of his bridle in his hand likewise. Let
be (quoth the king) and giue me thē
to hold in my mouth, for my hands
are full enough alreadie. At which
speech his Barons fel a laughing with
open mouth, and making a iest of it,
demeaned themselues very vnseemely
without any kind of reuerence. But
the king Raymire perceiuing their
mocquerie, got eleuen of the most

noble and chiefest of his Barons to
come into the towne of Osey, where
he caused them to loose their heades
without saying any other words then
these:

                     La renardaille,

               The humilitie of Godfrey
of Buillon.
               VVHen the duke Godfrey of Buillon
was chosen king of Ierusalem
by the Christian Princes, and
the Diademe being presented vnto
him, he refused it saying: It is not fit
nor conuenient for any Prince Christian
to weare a Crowne of gold, sithence
Iesus Christ the King of kings
did weare one made but of thornes.
            
            
               The ansvver of the great Turke to the
Ambassadours of Hungarie.
               
                  BAiazet the sonne of Amurath, Emperour
of the Turkes, being with
a great armie in Bulgaria, which is a
part of Hungarie: the king Sigismond
                  
sent his Ambassadours vnto him, to
pray him that he would not molest
his countrie and Dominions, wherein
he had no right nor interest. Baiazet
for answer to this Ambassade, caused
all the armed forces of that Prouince
to be assembled together into
a great hall, where hauing made the
Ambassadours of the king of Hungarie
to be called: he said vnto them
pointing to those forces with his finger:
Behold, said he: the reason and
the right by which I haue & do hold
the possession of Bulgarie.
               
               Right and equitie haue no place in the
Court of a Tyrant.
            
            
               The ansvver of the Count de Lazaran
to the Ambassadours of
the Turke.
               NO lesse notable was that answer
which the County de Lazaran
made vnto the Ambassadours of Lamorabaquin,
or Baiazet the Amira or
king of the Turkes: who purposing
to inuade the realme of Hungary with
a mightie armie, sent his messengers

to the Count de Lazaran with a mule
laden with Rice, and demaunded to
haue passage through his countrey
into Hungarie. The Ambassadours
proceeding on their Commission,
found the County in his castell called
the Archforme, and according to
their charge did demand passage for
their Lord and his armie: and that he
should become his vassall and subiect:
otherwise that their Lord Baiazet
would bring into the countrey of
the Count more men of warre then
there were graines of Rice in the
sackes wherewith their mule wa
                     •
                   laden:
and in so saying, they powred
out the graine in the middest of the
castell yard. The Count receiued &
heard their message very courteously:
and the third day after being disposed
to giue them their answer, cō
                  maunded
to be brought into his Castle
court a great number of powltry
which for three daies together had
bene shut vp without any meat giuē
vnto them: the which in lesse then a
quarter of an houre, did eate vp all
the Rice which had bene there powred

out. Whereupon he said vnto the
Ambassadours: Now go tell your
Lord, that true it is, he hath a great
number of armed souldiers: howbeit
he cannot bring so many into the
field, but they shall be either slaine or
vanquished: as you haue seene these
grains of Rice deuoured by my pullen.
And according to his hope the
Count had the victorie.
            
            
               A vvorthy Sentence of the Ambassadors
of Sicilia.
               CErtaine Ambassadours of Sicilia
deliuering that which they had
in charge to Iames the eleuenth king
of Arragon: he shewed them that they
ought to yeeld their obedience to the
Church: and to Charles king of Naples
his father in law: whereupon one
of the Ambassadours said vnto him:
Sir, we reade in many histories, that
peoples haue bene defeated by their
Princes, and we haue seene the proof
thereof in our time: but that subiects
haue bin destroied by their kings, we
haue neuer yet seen, or hard it spokē.
            
            
               Of the death of Vladislaus king of
Hungarie.
               
                  
                  VLadislaus king of Hungary and
of Poland, whome the French
named Launcelot, leauying a puissant
armie against Amurath great Seigneur
of the Turkes, was disswaded
from it by many Barons of his realm
and other his allies. Amongst whom
one Dracocles a Valachian did disswade
him from that enterprise. But
in the end seeing that his aduice took
no effect, he yeelded that his sonne
should go in his company with two
thousand horse: and at their departure,
he gaue vnto the king Vladislaus
and to his sonne two very swift and
light horses, saying: Because I foresee
that the losse is like to fall on your
side in this warre which you enterprise:
I haue giuen you these two
horses, by whose swiftnesse of foote
you may saue your selues, and serue
you of them in your necessitie: for I
feare me that you shall haue great
need of them. And accordingly it fell
out: for in a set battell foughten betweene
Vladislaus & the Turks, in the
yeare 1444. as Dracocles had foretold,
the king there lost his life.
            
            
               
               Of the tvvo verses vvhich Conrad king
of Naples caused to be vvritten
vpon a horse of brasse.
               
                  COnrad the sonne of Fredericke, hauing
taken the towne of Naples
by composition in the yeare 1253.
caused the wals, fortresses, and principall
houses of the citie to be ruinated:
and going into the great church
within the middle whereof was a
horse of brasse without a bridle,
which had bene kept there of a long
time for the antiquitie of it: he caused
a bridle to be put vpon him, and
on the reines thereof were written
these two verses:

                     Hactenus 
                           •
                        ffrenis, Domini nun

                     Rex domat hunc, aequus parthenopensis
equum.
                  
That is to say:

                     This horse till now vnbridled, now is
made
                     To beare the reines which on his
necke are laid:
                     His lord the rightfull king of Naples
towne,
                     
                        
Did tame this horse, and bring his
courage downe.

                  REne king of Sicilie, said oftentimes
vnto the Princes and Ambassadors
of diuerse places that came
to visit him: I loue the countrey life
aboue all others, because it is the best
manner and the surest course of liuing,
and the most free from earthly
ambition.
               This King loued husbandry exceedingly:
and vvas the first that caused to be
brought into Fraunce out of straunge
countries, vvhite Peacockes, red Partriges,
vvhite, blacke and red Conies:
Betony and roses of Prouence. He was
a good Prince, a perfect Musitian: and
composed sundry bookes in verse and
in proes: amongst the vvhich are that
of the conquest of Gentle mercie, and
that of the mortification of vaine
pleasure, vvhich I haue read.
            
            
               A conceited speech spoken to
king Ferdinand.
               
                  
THe king Ferdinand of Naples was
very malecontent, and could not
endure to see men walke together
two or three in a company, or to
talke together of their priuate affaires.
A certaine Courtier seeing the
King in this passion, to currie fauour
with him, said vnto him: Sir, you
ought to shunne and take away this
vsage that is so troublesome vnto
you, or else to make your benefite
of it: and in my aduice, it were good
that you imposed a tribute vpon
them that vse to walke in this maner
vp and downe: for it would yeeld
you a greater reuenue, then the customes
which you leauie vpon the
merchandizes of all your Realme
and Dominions.
            
            
               Of a pretie quippe giuen by Anthony
of Panor
                     •
                  e to a
certaine Knight.
               THe king Alphponsus (of whome
we haue before spoken) beeing
aboue all things well affected to

the exercise of hunting, did very earnestly
enquire of Anthony of Panorme,
what Gentlemen of Naples were the
greatest louers of that game of venerie:
and whether any of them had
written of the nature of dogges and
hounds. Why sir (quoth the Panormitan)
how is it that you demaund of
me this question? Haue you not a
person in your company euery day,
which hath conuersed with this kind
of creatures for these forty yeares together:
and night by night hath lien
by a brach: he I trow is sufficiently able
to write of the nature of hounds,
and the manner how to keepe and
cherish them. Now the partie of whō
the Panormitan spake, was a certaine
Knight, who was in very good grace
and fauour in Court: which made the
king immediatly to fall on laughing,
knowing that the said Panormitan vnder
the name of a brach, did meane
the Gentlemans wife, because she
was a woman that did vse to be very
loud and clamoursom in her speech,
and was the most subiect to furiousnesse
and outragious passions of any

woman liuing.
               A contentious and quarelsome wife is
an incurable disease.
            
            
               The letters of the Earle of Aniovv to the
king of Fraunce.
               
                  LEvvis king of France, the sonne
of king Charles the simple, being
in the church of S. Martin of Tours at
diuine seruice: diuerse of his Gentlemen,
young Courtiers, shewed him
how Fovvkes the good Earle of Aniovv
was set amongst the singing
men, and did sing with them, for the
which they mocked and contemned
him. Whereof the Countie
being informed, he sent letters vnto
the king, wherein was nothing
written saue these words only: To the
king of Fraunce the Earle of Aniovv
sendeth greeting. Sir knovv you: that a
King vnlearned is but an asse crovvned.
               
            
            
               The counsell of the Earle of Aniovv
to his brother at the time
of his death.
               
                  
                  MAurice Erle of Aniou at the time
of his decease, giuing some instructions
to his brother Fouques Nerra
that succeeded him in his Earledome,
said vnto him: My brother, I
pray remember how in all my life
time I haue laboured to get me
friends, knowing that this is great riches:
and that the house which hath
many friends ought not to be reputed
poore nor destitute. And therefore
I aduise thee in any case to hold
them deare vnto thee, who haue
heretofore bene faithfull and trustie
vnto vs.
               A friend hath no greater treasure then a
true friend in time of necessitie.
            
            
               A Christian Act of the Earle
of Aniou.
               
                  FOuques the fifth of that name, earle
of Aniou hauing gained the victorie
in a battell foughten against Henrie
king of England, neare the towne
of Sees (where the Angeuins and Manceaux
tooke a great number of prisoners,

whom they bound & enchained
together, and lodged in an Abbey
church neare the campe. On a
morning early the Count being disposed
to go heare a Masse in the
same church, and being not able to
enter into it for the multitude of prisoners
there enchained, he was very
much discontented at it, and turning
him to his men at armes, he said: My
companions and friends, what haue
you done? Do you not know that the
church is the house of God and of
prayer: and haue you turned it into
a prison? Do you not feare the wrath
of God, in that you execute crueltie
in his temple? You ought to know
that the church is our mother, and we
are her children: this place is a Sanctuarie
and a place of priuiledge: but
you haue made it a place of seruitude.
This said, he caused the prisoners
to be vnbound: & hauing made
them to eate & drink, he set thē at liberty
without paying of any ransom.
               The same Earle on a time said:
that to support or cherish the wicked
was to do iniurie to the good.
            
            
               
               A Sentence of the duke
of Brittaine.
               
                  IOhn duke of Brittaine the fifth of
that name, being willing to make
a mariage betweene his sonne the
Lord Frauncis and the Ladie Izabel
daughter to the Scottish king: the
young Prince Francis enquired what
kind of Ladie that Izabel was: to whō
answer was made: that she was a very
goodly Gentlewoman, wise, and discreet:
and one that was likely to haue
faire issue of her bodie; sauing that
she had some impediment in her
speech. Then is she, such a one as I
desire quoth the Duke: For I hold a
woman wise enough, that knoweth
how to put a difference between the
wastcote and shirt of her husband.
            
            
               The haughtie courage of the duke
of Burgundie.
               
                  PHilip the hardie duke of Burgundie
was wont to say: That kingdomes,
Lordships, and Dominions,

did of right appertaine vnto thē that
could by conquest get and purchase
them: he got the name of hardie: because
at a certaine banquet, he leaped
ouer the table, onely to haue the
chiefest place next to the person of
king Charles the sixth: he had both
the courage and the speech of Alexander
the Great.
            
            
               An act of Galeace duke of Millain.
               
                  GAleace duke of Millain was giuen
to vnderstand, that there
was a certaine Aduocate in that citie
so subtill and cunning, that he could
prolong sutes in law, and so draw thē
out in length, as he would make thē
almost endlesse, whensoeuer he listed
to vndertake to do it either for loue
or for money. The Duke willing to
make proofe thereof, enquired of the
chiefe steward of his house, if there
were not some debt due and owing
by him to those that were to serue
him with prouisions for his house. In
the end it appeared that there was
owing to a certain Baker an hundred

pounds: in whose name he caused
himselfe to be summoned, and a day
to be set downe for his appearance
before the Senate, to answer for the
paiment of this debt vnto the said Baker.
In the meane time he sent to
this Aduocate, and demaunded his
counsell, how he might make delaies,
and not be enforced to make
paiment of this money. The Aduocate
promised him to find the means
and to deuise such sleights, as the Baker
should not finger a peny for one
yeare at least, or not for two yeares
if he listed. The action being prosecuted,
and iudgement ready to be giuen:
the Duke then demaunded of
the Aduocate, if it were not possible
yet longer to protract it: where unto
the Aduocate answered: that he wold
so handle the cause, as it should not
be ended for two yeares. Oh notable
iniustice! (quoth the Duke to the Aduocate:)
Thou wicked man, diddest
thou not know, nay did not I tell
thee that I owed him an hundred
pounds: and yet wouldest thou, euen
against thy owne conscience & mine

also, frustrate the poore man of his
due? Is there any reason to hold plea
against a iust debt? Take the wretch
(said he to his Officers) and let him
be presently hanged, and his bodie
quartered: to the intent from hencefoorth
the commonweale may not
by him be any more corrupted. And
according as the duke had pronounced
this sentence, so with the consent
of the Senate was the Aduocate executed.
            
            
               The resolution of a Gentleman of Millaine
at his death.
               THe same duke Galeace was murthered
within the church of Saint
Stephen in Millain, as he was hearing
of deuine Seruice. One of the conspiratours
and murtherers was slaine instantly
in the place where the murder
was committed: the other named Ierome,
hauing bene hidden for three
daies vnder a Merchants shoppe in
the streete, was constrained by famine
to come foorth: and being apprehended,
was adiudged to be

quartered aliue. The execution being
to be done, and he stretched out
on a table, at the end wherof his head
hanged downe, as his belly was ripped
open: with pure strength he lifted
vp his head, to see his intrails taken
out of his bodie: and therewithall
vttered these words:
Collige te, Ieronyme: Vita breuis, Mors
acerba, Laus perpetua.
               
               That is:
Plucke vp thy heart Ierome: life is but
short: death is bitter: but the renowne
will be perpetuall.
               
               And so saying, he gaue vp the
ghost.
            
            
               The cunning of Count
Rodericke.
               THe Count Radericke Gonthier hauing
bene taken prisoner in a
battell, by Ferdinand king of Catelonia:
in the which Aluara the brother
of the said Countie was slaine: the
Count himselfe was set at libertie, vpon
his faith giuen to returne again,
after he had caused his brother to

be interred. Which promise the said
Rodericke being willing to performe,
and yet withall desirous to keepe his
libertie: he caused the dead bodie of
his said brother to be embaulmed, &
to be put in a Coffin, the which he
made to be caryed with him wheresoeuer
he went: and he would neuer
suffer it to be buried till after the decease
of king Ferdinand And by this
pollicie he thought his oath sufficiently
obserued, which he had formerly
sworne to the King.

of warres, was wont to vse this
saying: VVhen thine enemie is vvilling

vvith a bridge of gold.

of Burgoine.
               
                  PHilip duke of Burgoine, hearing
say how they of Gaunt did exceedingly
loue the Count Charolois his

sonne▪ he said: Oh they practise the
common Prouerbe, which is this:
The Gauntois do euer loue the yong
Prince, the sonne and heire of their
Lord: but afterwards when he commeth
to inherite the Duchie, and to
raigne, then they hate him.

                   duke of Venice,
being vnwilling to take reuenge
of certaine iniuries that had
bene offered him, said: That a good
Prince, and such a one as was not inclined
to crueltie, had a sufficient reuenge
of his enemies, when he made
it knowne to others, that he had the
power to worke reuenge if he listed:
and that he would not do it vpon priuate
persons, though he did sharpely
punish the publike offences.

                  BOrso the first duke of Ferrara, was
wont to say: That the hearts and

affections of men were sooner gained
by benefites and good deedes,
then by force & constraint of Armes.

duke of Sauoy, being demaunded
by certain Ambassadours, where
were his hounds with which he vsed
to hunt: and desiring to haue a sight
of them, he told them that if they
would come againe to his Court the
next morning they should see them.
The day after they came, and the
Duke led them into a Hal, where was
a great number of poore people and
beggars eating and drinking at a table.
Behold (said he to the Ambassadours)
the dogges which I keepe and
nourish: and with which I purpose to
purchase and to lay hold on the heauenly
glorie.

of Rhodes.
               
                  PHilip de Villiers, great maister of
the knights of the Rhodes, being

be sieged in the said citie by Solyman
the grand Seigneur of the Turkes: &
hauing lost so many of his people,
that he had very few left, said oftentimes:
That it was much better to
saue one of his owne men, then to kil
a thousand of his enemies.
            
            
               The speech of the great Turke to the
said great Maister.
               AT what time the said Villiers was
constrained to render the same
towne of Rhodes to the said Sultan Soliman:
and that he came to the presence
of the said grand Seigneur, to
confirme the rendring of the place
whereunto he had bene forced, and
to take his leaue of him for his departure
towards Christendome: the
grand Seigneur vsed a speech vnto
him worthy of so great a Prince,
which was this: To loose townes,
Lordships and Dominions is a thing
so vsuall and accustomable amongst
men: that it is a sufficient testimony,
how we are all of vs subiect to infi
                     •

                   that is:
E ther I will be Emperour or nothing.
And so fell it out in the end accordingly:
or ere he came to that he aspired,
his wicked conditions brought
him to an vnhappie end: for he dyed
prisoner in Spaine.

aduised & disswaded by many Captaines

of the Romaines: neither are

his souldiers: howbeit notwithstanding

the honour of the battell.

curtizans richly apparelled after the
fashion of that countrie
                     •
                  , who did
him great reuerence, and he rendred
them the like. Huguenin de Tolligney,
a French gentleman which did then
accompany him, caused him to stay
and said vnto him: My lord: who are
these two dames to whom you haue
done this great reuerence? I know
not said the Marshall: Huguenin replye'd:

Why sir, they be common
women. The Marshall answered: wel,
I know not what they be, neither
skils it: for I had leifer do reuerence
to tenne common women, then to
faile of saluting any one that is honest.

said Bouciqualt was Marshall of
Fraunce, there liued then also a famous
renowned knight called Iohn de
Saintré: of which two persons, the
French in their commendation made
these verses:

                     Of much more worth in an assault,
                     Is Saintré then is Bouciqualt:
                     But much better in a treatie,

               An Act of the Earle
of Sauoy.
               
                  PEter Earle of Sauoy, being to go
before the Emperour Otho the
fourth, to do him homage for his

landes which he held of the Empire:
went apparelled with a certaine robe,
the one halfe whereof was of steele
in fashion of an armour gilded: in
such sort that on the right side he was
most richly apparelled; and on his
left side he was armed: in this manner
attired did he demaund the inuestiture
of his lands of the Emperour:
who hauing graunted it vnto him:
and the Earle being retired, and repairing
to the Chauncellour to haue
his dispatch, shewed him the auncient
Euidence, and letters Patents
graunted to his Predecessours wherby
he held his landes. The Chauncellour
then demaunded of him, if he
had the like for the territories of Chablais,
Oste, and Vaux, well knowing
that he lately had gotten those lands
by conquest. Whereupon the Earle
setting his hād on his sword, & drawing
it naked out of the scabbard, shewed
it vnto the Chancellour, and said:
that he had no other Euidence for
those lands but his sword: and by
that he held them. After which the
Emperour demaunded of him:

why he ware such a garment, with the
one halfe of cloth of gold, and
the other halfe of steele. The Earle
answered: that he ware the cloth of
gold on his right side to do honour
to his Maiestie: and for my attire on
the left side, it signifieth (quoth he)
that if any man deale sinisterly and ill
with me, or offer me any iniurie, I
am readie to defend me, and to fight
for my right enent to the death.
            
            
               How the duke of Millain serued
an Astrologer.
               A Certaine Astrologer (which
tooke vpon him to foreshew
things to come, and the good and ill
fortune of men,) regarding the countenance
of Iohn Galeace duke of Millain,
said vnto him: Sir, dispose of
your affaires betimes, for you cannot
liue long. How knowest thou
that, sard the duke? Marry sir, quoth
he, hauing obserued the starres that
are the gouernors of your life, I find
that they do threaten you death in
your flourishing age. Well, (quoth

the Duke) and for thy selfe, how long
shalt thou liue? Sir (said the Astrologer)
my Planet promiseth me long
life. To the end therefore (said the
Duke) that thou shalt neuer more
haue affiance in thy Planet, thou shalt
dye presently contrarie to thy opiniō,
and all the Planets of heauen shall
not saue thy life. And he had no sooner
spoken it but he perfourmed it:
for he commaunded him instantly to
be hanged: which was accordingly
executed.
            
            
               The message sent from Narses to
Sophia, the Empresse of
Constantinople.
               
                  NArses the Eunuch, a most excellent
Chieftaine, who was Lieutenant
Generall for the Emperours
Iustinian and Iustin of their warres in
Italy, was sent for by the Empresse
Sophia the wife of Iustin (a most stout
and proud Ladie) and commaunded
to returne from Italy & Naples where
he was Gouernour, and to come to
Constantinople to the Court: letting

him to vnderstand, that she meant to
employ him in another manner of
seruice then the warres, and fitter for
his estate: namely, to spin and weaue
wool with her women and maidens.
To the which message, Narses returned
this answer: that he would weaue
such a webbe, as neither she nor her
husband, (whom she ruled as she listed)
should be able euer to vntwine.
And he did no lesse thē he promised:
for he secretly sent for Alboin king of
the Lombards out of Hungarie being
his very great friend, and set him in
possession of Italy, so as both he and
his successours enioyed it for a long
time after.
               A vvoman of insolent and proud cariage
and haughtie in speech, is the cause of
notable mischiefes.
            
            
               The magnanimity of Bertrād du Guesclin.
               THis Bertrand du Guesclin was no
lesse famous & renowned for his
magnanimitie & courage, then was
Narses the Graecian. For before that
he was Constable of Fraunce, he held
the part of Henry king of Spaine against
king Peter the brother of the

said Henry. And in a battell foughten
at Nadres between the two brothers,
Henry was put to flight and Bertrand
was takē prisoner by the black prince
of VVales, who followed the party of
king Peter, who led him prisoner to
Burdeaux: hauing held him there a
time, he was willing to deliuer him,
and to acquit & pay his debts, on cō
                  dition
that the said Bertrand should
neuer beare armes against him the
said Prince, against the king of Englād
his father, nor against king Peter of
Castill, nor their allies. But Bertrand
refusing to yeeld to those conditions,
was notwithstanding put to his raunsome
such as himselfe would nominate
and set downe. Bertrand (howbeit
that he was & alleadged himself
to be but a poore knight) yet hoping
on his good fortunes, offered the
Prince an 100000. double Florins of
gold. The Prince supposing that he
mocked him, quitted him for the
quarter part: but Bertrand standing on
his honour, would not yeeld to pay
lesse then sixtie thousand, saying:
That he would be well able to pay it.

The Prince accepting his offer: Bertrand
spake out aloud before all the
Lords and Nobles there present: now
may Henry of Castill well vaunt himselfe
and boldly say: That he shall dy
king of Spaine: for I doubt not but to
set the Crowne on his head: and he
shall yeeld me the one moitie of my
raunsome: and king Charles of France
shall furnish me with the other moitie.
Such was the haughtie courage
of this valiant Chieftaine, who afterwards
accomplished and acquitted
himselfe of that his promise.
               The same Pertrand being afterwards
Constable of Fraunce vnder
Charles the fifth, left a custome in
Fraunce which he brought vp in his
time: That whatsoeuer Gentleman
had committed any forfeit against
the reputation and honour of his estate:
if he did afterwards happen to
be in company at any banquet: the
meate which was set before him
should be cut in peeces.
            
            
               A hardy speech vttered by Hire, a
French Captaine to king
Charles the seuenth.
               
                  
THe Hire a French Captaine being
sent from the armie to the
king of Fraunce Charles the seuenth,
to shew him in what estate the affairs
of the warres then stoode: and that
for default of victuals, money, and
other necessaries, the French had lost
certaine townes & battels to the English.
The king willing to entertain
the Captaine in good familiar sort,
shewed him all his delicate preparations
of his pleasures and delights, the
sports, the Ladies, and the banquets
wherewith he recreated himselfe: and
withall demaunded of him how he
liked them. The Hire very freely and
liberally answered him, saying: Sir, I
neuer in my life saw Prince, that lost
his patrimonie more pleasantly then
you do.
               That man is to be reputed mad & senselesse,
that vvill sit playing, vvhilest
his house is a burning.
            
            
               A prompt and readie ansvver of an
English Captaine the
Lord Talbot.
               
                  
                  TAlbot an English Captaine, hauing
besieged the citie of Orleance
in the time of king Charles the
seuenth: the citizens fell to practise
with the duke of Burgundie, to yeeld
themselues vnder his obeissance:
whereupon the Duke wrote to the
said lord Talbot wishing him to leaue
the siege, and the rather for that his
long abode before that place, might
be a great dammage and preiudice
vnto him. The lord Talbot suspecting
the practise then in hand, would not
cōsent to the Dukes motion: but sent
him this answer: I do not meane to
beat the bush, and that another shall
haue the birds.
               This speech in some histories is attributed
to the duke of Bedford Regēt of France
vnder Henry the 6. king of England.

                     w Aluiano a Captaine of
the Venetians, and Generall of

their armie, at the battell of Agnadell
was there taken prisoner by the
French, and presented to king Lewis
the twelfth: who demanding of him,
vpon what ground or reason he bore
armes against him: the said Barthelmevv
made this answer: Sir, I haue
vndertaken the warre against you for
two speciall reasons. The first is, for
discharge of my dutie to my countrie.
The second is: for that hauing to
deale against so great and puissant a
Prince as you are: if I had obtained
the victorie, my renowne and fame
had bene eternall: and being vanquished,
I shall haue neuer the lesse
honour and reputation with them of
my countrey, when they shall enter
into due consideration of your greatnesse
and excellencie: for the hardinesse
& couragious boldnesse which
I had to resist against you, shall turne
to my glorie and honour.
               Men of haughtie courage do not attempt
other then great actions: the issue
vvhereof cannot but turne to their
honour.
            
            
               
               A tyrannicall Sentence of Prospero
Colonna.
               
                  PRospero Colonna being Colonel of
the Italian men at armes which
were within Millain: a citizen of Millain
came to complaine vnto him of
the exactions and pillaging of his soldiers:
vnto whom he said: Millain is
like vnto a bird, from which if one
pull away the feathers, she bringeth
foorth others much more faire and
beautifull.
            
            
               The ansvver of an Italian to
Ascanio Colonna.
               
                  AScanio Colonna hauing many
goodly liuings and possessions
in Romania, arriued in a certaine
towne of his own: where all the chief
men came vnto him to salute him &
to do him reuerence, onely one citizen
excepted: who being very rich,
yet no Gentleman, had one only son
an honest faire conditioned young
man, who being singularly endued

with all the gifts and graces wherewith
nature cold enrich him, was not
inferiour, but rather excelled all others
there inhabiting. Seigneur Ascanieo
inuited that same citizen to supper:
at the end whereof, he demaunded
of him to haue his sonne to serue
him: promising to preferre him and
aduaunce him highly. The citizen
said vnto him: no sir, I will not that
he shall serue you: for I remember
me of an old Prouerbe which withholdeth
me from condescending
hereunto. What Prouerbe is that,
said Seigneur Ascanio? The citizen
answered: Hearken sir, and I will repeate
it vnto you:

                     Male è chi gli serue.
                     Peggio è chi gli disserue,
                     Beato è chi non gli conosse.
                  
That is to say:

                     Ill is he that serueth:
                     Worse is he that cannot please:
                     But happy is he that knoweth
neither.

                  LEwis Sforce being determined to
exact a great summe of money
by compulsion vpon the citie of Genes:
sent an Ambassadour thither to
negotiate this businesse: who being
inuited by a chiefe personage of the
Citie to dine with him, and walking
into the garden of that citizen his
house: there they two fell into communication
of that matter: the Gentleman
Geneuois seeing the herbe
Basell, said vnto the Ambassadour:
My lord Ambassadour, stroke your
hand along vpon, and after smell vnto
it: which he did, and confessed that
the sauour of it was most sweete and
odoriferous: My Lord (quoth the
Geneuois againe) straine the herbe in
your hand and then smell to it: which
he did likewise, and said that it yeelded
a very bad and lothsome sent.
Wherupō the Geneuois said vnto him:
My lord, if the duke Lewis wil gently
stroke the hand of his puissance ouer
this citie without any violent dealing
he shall find it to yeeld a good sauor,
& very obedient vnto him: but if he
come to oppresse it & to force it by

compulsion, surely it will yeeld but a
sharpe and ill tast by disobedience
and rebellion.

giuen to their
souldiers.

the potestates of Italy to king
Charles the eight at his returne from
the conquest of Naples: the French
Knights passing by the rankes of the
battels, as they were doing their deuoit
in the thickest presse of their enemies,
and fearing lest the couetousnesse
of the souldiers might
make the French loose the victorie:
they cryed vnto their souldiers: Remember
the battell of Guinegare.
This was a battell foughten in the
time of king Levvis the eleuenth against
Maximilian king of the Romanes:
the which the French lost by
giuing themselues to the pillage.

                  RAault the Dane, who was afterwards
the first duke of Normandy
comming into Fraunce with a great
armie: there was sent against him Robert
Earle of Aniou, Marshall of
Fraunce: who demaunded of one Hastingue
(a Dane likewise, being then
Countie de Chartres) whether he
thought best to giue battell vnto Raault
or not, and what was his aduice
therein? Hastingue for some reasons
disswaded him. But a certaine noble
Knight which caried the Banner of
Fraunce, perswaded the Marshall to
the contrary, saying: My Lord: did
you euer see a wolfe seize vpon a
wolfe: or one foxe make war against
another foxe? Inferring hereby: that
they were both of one nation: and
that therefore it was very vnlikely
that the one would hurt the other.
               THe Elect of Senlis encouraging
the French men at armes against
the Flemings in the battell of Bouines,
vnder the king Philip Augustus, amongst
other words, said: It is not

the part of any noble and valiant
Knight, to make the bodie of another
Knight to serue him for his
shield and rampart.
            
            
               The Sayings of Captaine Baiard.
               
                  FRauncis de Stritigen, a Colonell vnder
the Emperour Charles the fift,
hauing besieged Mezieres, within the
which was Captaine Bayard: for
Frauncis the first of that name, king
of Fraunce summoned him by a Herald
to yeeld himselfe and the place
whereof he had the gouernment.
Wherunto Bayard made this answer.
The Baiard of Fraunce feareth not the
Roussin of Almaine.
               
               This conceipt vvas vpon the allusion to
his name, vvhich vvas so famous and
renowned, that the Spaniards had this
saying of him: In Fraunce are many
Graybeards, but there are but fevv
Bayards.
               A Gentleman demanded of Monsieur
Bayard: What goods and
possessions a Gentleman ought to

leaue vnto his children? he answered:
Marry that which needeth not feare
any stormes nor tēpests, nor force of
man, nor humane iustice: and that is
wisedome and vertue. And it behooueth
the father to haue like care of
his children, as a Gardiner hath of his
garden: that is: to be carefull in trimming
of it, to see it well sowed, & wel
planted with good seedes and plants.
               Another demaunded of him, what
difference there was betweene the
learned and the ignorant: As much
(quoth he) as is betweene a Phisition
and his patient.
               He said: that the greatest honour
and Seignorie which any Nobleman
could possibly haue, was to be familiar
and conuersant with men that are
vertuous: and the greatest euill which
could possibly betide to any great
person, was to be accompanied with
those for his familiar friends, who
were ignorant and vicious: for (said
he) there cannot be a greater plague
or pestilence, then when audaciousnesse
and puissance is accompanied
with ignorance.
               
                  
A certaine Gentleman on a time
said vnto him: Sir, I see euery where
great store of riches and worldly
goods, but I see not that prudence &
wisedome which you haue so highly
commended. That is no maruell (answered
Bayard) for you haue the
earthly eyes of the bodie, with which
you see earthly things: but you haue
not the eyes of the spirit and vnderstanding,
wherewith to discerne and
consider wisedome and prudence.
               A dangerous iest of a soldier of Nauarre.
               IN the yeare 1916. at such time as
the French and Venetians had laid
siege before Bressia, which the Spaniards
held for the Emperor: after that
the souldiers of both parts had vsed
each against other sundry taunts and
reprochfull arrogant speeches: a certaine
souldier a Nauarrois, (to the intent
he might in some sort represse
the vaunting speeches of the Spaniards)
in giuing them occasion to suspect
the mines wrought vnder the
groūd against thē: he vsed this speech
vnto thē: My friends, you that are
so full of your mocks within the town

take good heed and looke well to
yourselues, to preuent the harme
that may betide you, lest that when
the henne hath done scraping & digging
the ground with her feete, you
repent you that you did not dreame
of it.
               It is a good threatning, that giueth a man
good admonition.
            
            
               Of the two Marshals of Fraunce,
Monsieur de Antrehan, and
Monsieur de Cleremount.
               THe Prince of VVales surnamed
the Blacke Prince, hauing made
sundrie offers vnto Iohn the French
king before the battell of Poytiers:
the king assembled his Councell to
haue their aduice. The lord de Antrehan
one of the Marshals, did counsell
the king to accept the offers of the
Prince, and not to hazard the battell
and to aduenture the certaine for the
vncertaine. The lord of Cleremount
the other Marshall, reproching the
Marshall de Antrehan, and obiecting
that his counsell proceeded of feare

and cowardice, because he durst not
be at the battell, De Antrehan being
very highly offended, and esteeming
himselfe much wronged in his honor
and reputation, said vnto him with a
stout courage: Cleremount, to the intent
thou maist know that it is no
cowardly feare that made me speake
as I haue done: I would thou shouldest
well know, that the arrest of my
launce shall be more forward in the
battell, then thou shalt be with the
point of thine. And the battell being
foughten, the French lost the field,
and king Iohn was taken prisoner.

her husband Bertrand du
Guesclin.
               AFter that the Lord Bertrand du
Guesclin was espoused vnto the
Ladie Tiphanie, who was issued of a
noble and great familie: he discontinued
for a time the vse and exercise
of armes, which he had bene accustomed
to follow: for the which his
new espoused wise greatly blamed

him, saying: my sweete friend and
loue, before that we were maried
you were wont to follow the warres,
and many faire exploits haue bene
atchieued by your prowesse: in such
sort as many haue thought, that by
you the realme of Fraunce would be
recouered out of the hands of the English.
Surely, it cannot stand with the
nature of a true gentleman, that an
ouer exceeding affection to a new
wife should make you loose the honour
which you haue formerly obtained:
and sir, for my part, I who
ought to be honoured by your
meanes, shall esteeme my selfe much
disgraced, if you surcease from following
this course which you haue
so well begunne: and I shall beare
you the lesse loue & affection for it,
because you ought not to leaue and
forgo the honour and reputation of
chiualrie, and the art militarie which
euery man hath attributed vnto you.

                   the son
of King Philip of Fraunce.
               
                  LEvvis the sonne of king Philip
the first of that name, who was
afterwards surnamed Levvis le gros:
making warre against certaine Noblemen
of Fraunce that had rebelled
against his father: and hauing besieged
a certaine castell, his men at
armes would needes leaue him and
depart, by reason of the vnseasonablenes
& ill disposition of the time:
insomuch as he was not able either
by prayers or menaces to retain thē:
wherefore being thus abandoned &
forsaken of his forces, he was constrained
to retire and raise his siege,
saying & oftentimes repeating it: that
it was better by farre for a man to dy
a cruell death (prouided it were honest
& honorable) rather thē to prolong
his life with shame & dishonor.
            
            
               
               A courteous and gentle answer of
king Philip Augustus.
               CErtaine Councellours and Courtiers
shewed vnto the French
king Philip surnamed Augustus: that
the Cleargie of Fraunce did vsurp the
authoritie and royall iurisdictions appertaining
to the Crowne: whereby
his princely dignitie and prerogatiue
was greatly iniured and endammaged:
and wished him therefore to
cut off their authoritie so vsurped:
whereunto he wisely aunswered: I
do easily beleeue, that what you say
is true: howbeit calling to mind the
benefits wherewith God hath blessed
me, I had rather suffer and endure
losse and dammage in my rights, thē
to commence sute or to bring processe
against the seruitours of God &
his Church, whereof may arise and
grow any offence and scandall.

               KIng Charles the fifth being desirous
to ridde his countrey and
kingdome of Fraunce of those men

at armes both English and French,
which (after the treatie of peace accorded
betweene those two nations)
did ouerrunne and spoile the countrey
of Fraunce: the lord Bertrand du
Guesclin obtained leaue of the king,
to leade them into the realme of Granada
against the Saracens. And by reason
of the pilferies and robberies
which these men at armes had committed,
the Pope Vrban the fifth had
excommunicated them: Bertrand du
Guesclin hauing assembled them together,
and being chosen Generall of
these forces to passe with them into
Spaine, marched away with them by
the way of Auignon, where the Pope
Vrban the fifth was then resident: who
sent a Cardinall vnto them to know
what was their demaund: to the
which Cardinall, Bertrand answered:
Sir, I pray tell his Holinesse, that these
men of warre do demaund pardon &
absolution both from the gilt and
the punishment of their sinnes which
they haue committed, and for the
which they haue incurred the sentence
of excommunication: and besides

they do require two thousand
Florins of gold to maintaine them
and to defray their charges in their
voyage vndertaken for the aduancement
of the Christian faith. The Cardinall
making report vnto the Pope
of his message: his answer was this:
This is very straunge and a maruellous
matter, that this people should
demaund absolution and money:
and our custome is to giue absolution
and to take money.
            
            
               The opinion of the Earle
of Arminacke.
               THe Nobles and Barons of Guien
being assembled in counsell to
giue an answer vnto the demaunds
of the Prince of VVales, who was
purposed to make warre in Spaine,
because the most part of them
thought it vnlawfull, and an enterprise
of small reason: and were desirous
to be resolued amongst themselues
of the truth of the matter. The
Earle of Arminacke spake vnto them
on this manner: It is not fit, nor a

thing appertinent to the subiect, (who
standeth vpon the reputation of his
faith and loyaltie) to dispute of the
rights and interests which his Prince
may haue, in vndertaking warre against
another Prince: but he ought
to yeeld him his best seruice and endeuours,
whensoeuer he shall be required
thereunto: for he ought to be
perswaded, that his Prince in so doing,
doth nothing but vpon good
counsell & aduice: neither ought he
any further to be inquisitiue therinto.
               Euery vvarre vndertaken vpon an vniust
quarrell, is to the dishonour rather
of the Prince then of the subiect.
            
            
               The saying of the Earle of Foix.
               
                  GAston the second of that name,
Earle of Foix, hauing taken to
wife Elinor the daughter of Cōminge,
who was much elder then himselfe:
certaine Nobles of that countrey being
in communication with her of
that mariage, told her: That she had
taken and chosen an husband, who

was much younger then she: to whō
she answered: If I had knowne that
the Earle of Foix should haue bene
my husband, I would not haue bene
borne so soone, but haue stayed for
him.
               In euery good mariage, it is requisit that
the parties be equal and alike in conditions,
age and vvealth.
            
            
               The last words of the king of Nauarre
at his death.
               
                  FRauncis Phoebus Earle of Foix, and
king of Nauarre, lying vpon his
death bed, in the very agonie and last
panges of death, vsed these wordes
for his last speech: Regnum meum non
est de hoc mundo. I d
                        •
                     ò relinquo mundum
& non conturbemini, quia vado ad patrem.
My kingdome is not of this
world: therefore I leaue the world: &
be not you troubled, for I go to the
father.
            
            
               The answer of Iouian Pontanus.
               
                  IOuian Pontanus an excellent Philosopher
and a notable Poet, being

demaunded why he did eate but of
one kind of meate at his meale: and
of that also very little and in great sobrietie:
he answered: Because I wold
not haue any need of the Phisition.
               All Phisitions are of accordin this: that
diuersitie of meates do hinder the digestion,
and ingender sicknesses and diseases.
            
            
               A pleasant conceipt of the brother
of Sanctius, brother to the
king of Spaine.
               A Solemne Councel being assembled
at Rome, to consult vpon
the taking of armes against the Saracens
who had the possession of the
holy land: it was of a long time there
debated who should be chosen as the
most worthie and sufficient to haue
the conduct and commaund of the
armie. After many opinions, it was
concluded, that Sanctius brother to
the king of Spaine in regard of his
good parts, his hardinesse, courage,
and vertues, should be the chiefe and
Generall of this honourable enterprise:

because it was well known that
he was a man deuoide of couetousnesse
and ambition: and of excellent
expedition in deedes of armes: whervpon
he being after this election
come to Rome, and repairing to the
Conclaue where the Pope, Cardinals,
and Princes of Christendome were
assembled together: he was immediately
in the presence of them all,
by the decree and ordinance of the
Pope, amongst other articles proclaimed
and declared King of Egypt:
vpon the which Proclamation all
the people showted with a publicke
crie and acclamation exceedingly
reioyced. He not skilled in the Latine
tongue: and not knowing wherat
the Consistorie did make that triumphing,
demaunded the cause of
his interpreter: who hauing told him
that the Pope had graunted and proclaimed
him king of Egypt: he said
vnto his interpreter: Stand vp, and
make here presently a Proclamation
before all this people here assembled:
that seeing the Pope hath
made me king of Egypt, he therefore

shall be Caliph of Babylon.
               
               This was a sudden and royall liberality,
to recompence him with a vaine title
of Pontificalitie, from vvhom he
had receiued the name and stile of a
king vvithout a kingdome.
            
            
               The opinion of the king
of Sicilie.
               
                  RObert king of Sicilie, being on a
time in communication with
that famous Italian Poet Frauncis Petrarch,
told him: That he was more
in loue with his bookes then his own
Crown: and that he held more deare
the learning and knowledge which
he had gotté in the studying of good
letters, then all the honours and riches
of his realme.
               This opinion vvas cleane contrarie to
that of the French king Levvis the eleuenth.
            
            
               The mind of the Emperour
Fredericke, vvhich he
shevved towards
his vvife.
               
                  
THe Emperour Fredericke did neuer
vse to drinke wine but at
his meals: and euen then he vsed to
mingle and temper it with a great
quantitie of water. His wife the Empresse
Leonor did likewise neuer vse to
drinke any wine whilest she liued in
her fathers house: and being come
to the imperiall dignitie, the Phisitions
of Almaine aduised her to vse
wine, if she meant to haue any
children, because the climate of that
countrey was very cold: wherof Fredericke
being aduertised, commaunded
one of his neare and familiar
friends to go vnto the Empresse, and
to say this vnto her from him: I had
leifer haue a wife that is barren, then
one that is subiect to drinking of
wine. The Empresse returned to the
messenger this answer: During my
life I shall euer be obedient to the wil
and commaundement of my Lord &
husband: neuerthelesse, if the Emperour
should commaund me to vse
wine, I had rather dye then therein
obey him.
            
            
               
               A Sentence of Pope Clement
the seuenth.
               POpe Clement the seuenth, speaking
of the retaining of Princes
in peace and amitie for the quiet and
tranquilitie of the Christiā commonweale,
vsed to say: that it was a daungerous
and most perillous thing to
be in amitie with some particulars
onely: but to entertaine it with diuerse,
it was well befitting and beseeming
the dutie and dignitie of the
Papall See: which ought to declare it
selfe the common father and wel willer
of all in generall.
            
            
               The allusion of the Lantgraue
of Hesse.
               THe Lantgraue Philip of Hesse,
making warres against the king
Ferdinand brother to the Emperour
Charles the fifth, for the restoring of
Vtrich duke of VVittenberg to his
right: & being entred into the country
and and territories of the said Duchy,

there he encountred with his enemies,
whom he rudely put to the repulse.
And as he made his infanterie
to march on, he demaunded of the
aduaunteourrers where they had left
their enemies. Answer was made
him: that they were at Loffen. Well
said, (my good souldiers quoth he)
I take this your answer for a prognostication
of our victorie at hand: seeing
it seemeth to bring vs tidings
that our enemies are in flying.
               Loffen in Dutch signifieth flight, vvhich
made the Lantgraue by the allusion of
the vvord, to take it for a presage of
their flight.

Gentleman.
               COmmunication being moued
in the presence of the lord Claude
Duke of Guiz
                        •
                     
                   touching a certaine
battell giuen by Frauncis the French
king, against the Emperour Charles
the fifth: the duke of Guize began
to vse some speech vnto a French
Gentleman who had bene seene

in the armie gorgiously attired and
well armed at all points, and exceedingly
well mounted: howbeit that
he was not seene in the battell. By
my faith Sir (answered the Gentleman)
I was there: and I can bring
good proofe thereof, yea in such a
place as you durst not haue bene
seene. The duke tooke this speech
very ill, and supposed himselfe highly
touched, and therfore grew greatly
offended with the answer: but the
Gentleman laughing very pleasantly
appeased him in saying vnto him: My
Lord, I was with the baggage, where
I am sure your Lordship would not
haue vouchsafed to haue stayed as I
did.
               Sometimes a man that hath lost his honour
by his deedes, may recouer the
same againe by gracing it vvith good
speeches.

counsel vnto the aforesaid French

king Saint Levvis not to return back
into Fraunce, till he had ended his
warres in the holy land: was iniured
by som of the great lords & Nobles
neare about the Kings person, who
desired to depart from thence: in somuch
as they called him Colt: which
at that time was held a word of great
disgrace amongst the pesants of
Fr
                        •
                     unce: but he very gently replyed
vnto them: I had rather be a kicking
Colt, then a wincing Iade.
               His meaning vvas, that a young Colt
might helpe both himselfe and his master
out of dannger: but an old horse
endangereth both himself & his rider.
            
            
               The fidelitie of the French king
Saint Levvis.

paid the summe of two hundred
thousand pounds for the raunsome of
the Earle of Poitiers, brother to the
king Saint Lewis, who had bene taken

land: Monsieur Philip de Mon
                        •
                     fort
made report to the king, that the Saracens
                  
were misreckened in their receipt
of tenne thousand Franks wherupon
the king presently made him
sweare, and to giue his faith, that he
should see them paid, which he did
accordingly: and the king wold not
depart out of harbour, nor set saile to
sea, where he was readie embarked
for his returne, till the said summe of
ten thousand Frankes were deliuered
them.
            
            
               The speech of the Lady of Heluin.
               A Councell being held within the
citie of Gaunt, for the mariage
of the Ladie Mary Princesse of Burgundie,
(the daughter of duke Charles
which dyed before Nancie) with the
Prince Dolphin of Fraunce sonne of
king Lewis the eleuenth, who was afterwards
called Charles the eighth of
that name king of Fraunce, who was
then very young in yeares: the ladie
of Heluin chiefe Lady of Honour to
the Princesse, said: We haue need of
a man and not of an infant or child:
for my mistresse is a woman sufficient

to beare such a child as our countrey
hath great need of.
               This vvord to beare a child hath tvvo interpretations:
either to be married to
a man of prudence and vvisedome: or
that by the mariage, there may issue
a child of a good and vertuous disposition:
according to that sentence of
Salomon: The land is in weake estate
of which a child is Prince:
that is, a child in vnderstanding.

one day as he sate at dinner, he
could not away but fell in mislike
with the tast of all his meate set before

his Cooke, and was very angry with
him. But the Cooke read
                     •
                  e enough
to iustifie & free himself from blame
(after many excuses made) said vnto
the Duke: My lord, your me at is well
enough dressed: but the Florentines
haue put your mouth out of tast.
               
                  
To that man vvhich in vvarres is timerous,

               The persvvasion of the Lord Talbot
to his sonne.
               THe French vnder king Charles
the seuenth hauing laid siege before
the town of Chastillon which was
possessed by the English in the yeare
1453. the Lord Talbot then Lieutenant
General for the king of England
in Aquitaine, issued out of Burdeaux
to raise the siege of the French. Battell
being ioyned between them, and
the losse likely to fall to the English:
the lord Talbot said vnto his son: Son
I would wish thee to prouide for thy
safetie, and to reserue thy self to some
other time: as for me, it will be for
my honour to die here, after so many
victories by me obtained in times
past: but if thou shouldest miscarie in
this fight, litle honour wold it be vnto
thee: who by sauing thy selfe now
maist augment it in time to come: in
reseruing thy selfe for more haughtie
enterprises, and for the benefit of Enland
thy natiue countrie.
               
                  
This was a speech well beseeming a true
and noble Gentleman, and one that
was a louer of his conntrey: how beit,
his sonne would not yeeld vnto that
motion: but both father and sonne
there lost their liues.

               THe English being chased out of
Fraunce by king Charles the seuenth,
as certaine of them were readie
to passe the sea, the French in
mockage demaunded of an English
Captaine, when they would come
againe to make warre in Fraunce?
who answered: That shall we when
your sinnes do exceed ours in number.
               It is our sinnes onely that draweth down
the vvrath of God: and causeth him
to send vs both vvarres, famine and

               A good opinion of the Venetians.

               The ansvver of a Duchesse of Normandie
to her husband.
               A Certaine Damosell, named Gonnor,
which in former times had
bene beloued by Richard duke of
Normandie, the sonne of VVilliam
Long spath: being afterwards maried
to the said duke after the death of the
Ladie Auina his first wife, the daughter
of Hugues the great Erle of Paris:
the first night after she was maried to
the said duke being laid in bed with
him, she turned her backe towards
him. The duke maruelling at that
manner of her behauiour, said vnto
her: Full often haue you lien with
me: yet did I neuer see you thus do
before. Whereunto she answered:
True it is my sweet loue: for heretofore
I lay in your bed, and therefore
did as pleased you: but now I lye in
the bed that is mine as well as yours,
and therefore I may rest me of what

side do I please.
            
            
               The constancie of Elizabeth the
daughter of the King
of Boheme.
               
                  ELizabeth the daughter of VVenceslaus
king of Boheme, being conducted
with great honour to the city
of Spire in Germanie, of purpose there
to be espoused to Iohn the eldest son
of the Emperour Henry the seuenth:
and perceiuing that the celebrating
of the mariage, was deferred, she
made so secret inquirie of the cause,
that in the end she knew it was prolonged,
in regard of a iealousie
which the Emperour had conceiued
that she had not kept her virginitie:
for the truth is, she was of a most singular
and incomparable beautie farre
excelling all the Ladies of that age:
knowing therefore whereupon this
delay grew, she stripped her selfe out
of her clothes starke naked, and couering
her selfe onely with a mantle
of pure fine linnen, which was soone
and easie to be cast off: in this forme
she presented her selfe to the Emperour,

saying vnto him: Sacred Prince,
I will now instātly make good proof
of my virginity by the view & search
of my bodie: & the examinatiō therof
made by sage & honest women: &
I will neuer stir foot from hence, till
you be free from that suspitiō which
you haue conceiued of me. The Emperour
astonished and afraid at her
speech, could not possibly remoue
her from her determination by any
excuse or perswasion that he could
vse: but he was constrained to cause
her to be searched: and she being
found to be pure and a virgine inuiolate,
he caused her to be maried vnto
his sonne.
               True vertue is alwaies of that strength
and fortitude, as it can neuer he vanquished.

Levvis of Bauier: & hauing assembled
vnder the charge of certain captaines
of the estate of Germany to the number
of 20000. men horse & foot, to

the end he might cause them to set
forward: he consulted with his Counsell,
by what way he might best enter
into the Svvizzers countrey. The
Councel being resolued of the course
which they meant to take, the dukes
foole named Kune de Stocken who was
present, and had heard their deliberation,
said vnto them in his accustomed
habite and countenance of a
foole: I do not like of your counsell:
for all of you haue consulted, how,
and by what meanes we may enter
into their countrey: but there is none
of you that hath giuen his aduice,
how and in what sort we shall get away
againe from thence.

               The good conditions of the Emperour
Theodosian.
               THe Emperour Theodosian could
not endure to haue any to his
seruants who were proud and arrogant,
or of too braue and vaunting an
humour: much lesse could he suffer

them that were shameles, mutinous,
dissolute, seditious, or rash in their
speech. And he was wont to say, that
that Prince could neuer be well beloued
of his people, nor obeyed of
his subiects, as long as he did suffer
any to be neare him or about him
for his ordinarie seruants, that were
presumptuous and arrogant: or if his
Officers were ambitious and couetous:
or if his fauorites and familiars
were either dishonest, or imprudent,
double hearted, or double tounged.
               By the seruant, men iudge vvhat his
lord is: and such a man, such a maister.

by his friends to make his wil,

should happen to be slaine in that
warre: to whom he gaue this answer:
What need I take care to trouble my
selfe, with thinking where I shall be
buried, or by whom? shall I not haue
(trow ye) Pioners enough about
me, who will not leaue me vnburied
if I fortune to dye there?

                  e taking his leaue of him

to go to the battel of Serizoles against
the armie of the Emperor Charles the
fifth, he said vnto him: You cannot
possibly get to be at the battell in
time. His sonne answered him: I will
ride thither post. The father replyed:
What, will you cause your horses to
runne, and your armour to be caried
post? No (quoth the sonne) when I
my selfe shall haue gotten thither: I
shall easily find horse and armour.
Oh poore man (said the Lord of
Assier) wilt thou go seeke thy death
in post?
               As if he had said vnto him: you cannot
find there such horse and armes as
will be fit for thy bodie, which will be
the cause of thy death. And indeede
there he made his end.

                     〈◊〉

giue audience: they

the cause, vnderstood: 
                     〈◊〉
                   it was the

custome to send on Ambassade to
the Emperour, men that were aged
and of good yeares, and not young
beardlesse men, such as they were.
Whereupon they humbly besought
the Emperour that he would giue
them leaue to speake a word vnto
him nothing concerning their Ambassade:
which being granted them,
they said vnto the Emperour: Sacred
Maiestie: If the Seignorie of Venice
had thought, that knowledge and
prudence had onely had his abiding
in beards, they would haue sent vnto
your Highnesse two Goates for Ambassadours.
               The truth is, that the speeches of an Ambassadour
are of much more respect &
authoritie, vvhen they are accompanied
with aged yeares, prudence and
experience: and these young Ambassadours
did sh
                     •
                  vv by their speech, that
the conceipt and opinion of the Emperour

of them.

                   speech of Dant the
Italian Poet.
               
                  
THe Poet Dant demaunded of a
citizen of Florence, what houre it
was: who answered him very rudely,
that it was the houre, in which horses
go to be watered. Dant suddenly replyed:
What doest thou here then,
that goest not with them?
            
            
               Of a cause decided by a French
Gentleman.
               Two French Gentlemen discoursing
of single fight and combat,
whether it be lawfull or not: the one
of them said: That there was no agreement
between learning and the
sword: the other answered: We which
liue in the Latine Church, as Christians,
are bound to obserue those lawes
which it ordaineth: and to protect &
defend them with the sword: which
ought not to be drawne but for that
cause onely.
               The lavv of man permitteth single combate,
but the lavv of God prohibiteth
it.
            
            
               
               A sentence of the Chauncelor
of Fraunce.
               SPeech being had in the presence
of Anthony de Prat Chauncelor of
Fraunce, touching the warre of king
Frauncis for the recouerie of Millain:
and some affirming that it were
good that Millaine were vtterly destroied
and ruinated, in regard of the
dammage that it had brought vnto
the French: he answered: It is very
necessarie that Millaine should stand
in state as it is: because it serueth as
a purgation to the realme of France,
to take away and remoue the ill humours
of idle and ill disposed persons
which otherwise might corrupt and
destroy it.
               This was the sentence vvhich Scipio Africanus
vsed in his speech to the Romanes
concerning the preseruation of
Carthage from being ruinated.
            
            
               The patience of Seigneur
Sforce.
               
                  
A Knight of Nola came to tell Seigneur
Sforce how a Gentleman
one Tartaglia had spoken very badly
of him at a certain banquet, where
he had reproched him with all kind
of villanie: and he affirmed his report
with many great oathes, to the
intent he might the better be beleeued.
The Lord Sforce said vnto him:
My friend, thou needest not paine
thy self so much to make me beleeue
that which thou tellest me: because
that Tartaglia doth vse neuer to speak
of any but euill: and it is very likely,
that he would not make spare of his
ill speech with all kind of violence,
licentiousnesse and libertie euen to
his vttermost, especially being in
place fit and conuenient for such a
purpose.
               By this answer he gaue the talebearer to
vnderstand: that Tartaglia was not
much to be regarded, both in respect
he vvas reputed a common backebiter:
and in regard of his drunkennesse
whereunto he noted him to be subiect.

THe said Sforce being in doubt of
the ambushes & forces of Paule
Vrsin, forsooke the citie of Rome
where he was abiding, and went to

                  etie
during his being there: and amongst
other speeches vsed vnto him, he said:
Seigneur Sforce, will you be afraid of
a Beare, being vnder the protection
and assurance of a strong Colonne or
pillar to defend you? (for then was
the Pope of the house of the Colonnois
which in Italian signifieth a pillar:)
but Sforce made him this answer: My
lord Cardinall, you might thinke me
a very foole, if I would rely or trust
vpon the succours and defence of a
deafe and dead peece of Marble: and
not be afraid of a great monstrous
beast: who being armed with terrible
teeth and nailes, doth walke notwithstanding
as men vse to do.
               By this allusion, he shewed that the succours

of the Pope were slow and long
in comming: and he discouered the
high courage and great forces of Paul

               Philip of Commines in his hostorie testifieth,

of England.
               
                  KAtherine of Spaine the wife of
Henry the eight king of England,
said: That she loued better a temperate
and meane fortune, then that
which was either too easie and prosperous,
or too sharpe and aduerse.
Neuerthelesse that if she should be
put to her choise which of the two
last she would accept, she had rather
haue the aduerse then the prosperous:
because (said she) commonly they
which are vnfortunate, are not altogether
destitute of some consolation
and comfort: but they which liue in
prosperitie for the most part do want
the true vse of vnderstanding, reason
and iudgement.
            
            
               Of the President Moruillier.
               
                  PHilip de Moruillier President of
the Parliament of Paris in the
time of king Charles the 7. for some

enuie and malice conceiued against
him by the Councellours of the
Court, was greatly disliked of them,
insomuch as he retired himselfe to
the kings Court: who assoone as occasion
was offered preferred him to
the dignitie of chief President. Within
a while after being come into the
Parliament there to take possession
of his new place and dignitie: and
being set in the chiefe and principall
seat, he began very aptly his Oration
in this manner with a place of the
Scripture.
               Lapidem quē reprobauerunt aedificantes,
hîc factus est in caput anguli.
               The stone which the builders refused,
is become the head stone in
the corner.
               Monsieur de S. Romain at that time
Procurer generall for the king, answered
him with another text of the
Psalmist as fit as the former, saying:
A Domino factum est istud, & est mirabile
in oculis nostris.
               
               This is the Lords doing, and it is
maruellous in our eyes.
            
            
               
               A merrie conceipt of king
Alphonsus.
               
                  ALphonsus king of Naples had in
his Court a foole or iester, who
did vse to put downe in a booke or
paire of writing tables all the follies,
(at least those which he thought such)
of all the Lords, Gentlemen, and others
of his time which he knew to
frequent the Court. It happened that
the king Alphonsus hauing a Moore
in his house, sent him into the Leuāt
with ten thousand duckets there to
buy him horses: the foole set downe
in his booke this act of the king as a
tricke of folly. A few daies after, the
king Alphonsus called to his foole to
see his booke, hauing not seene it of
a good time before: In reading within
it, in the end thereof he found the
historie of himselfe, and his Moore,
and the 10000. duckets which he had
deliuered him: whereat the king being
offended, and growing into choler
demaunded of the foole: wherefore
he had put him in his booke?

Because (quoth the foole) you did a
very foolish act in giuing your money
to a straunger, whome you are
like to see no more. But how if he
come backe againe (said the king)
and bring the horses with him, where
is my folly then? Marrie (replyed the
foole) whensoeuer he commeth againe,
I will then blot your name
out of my booke, and will put in his
in stead of yours: for then I shall hold
him the more foole of the two.

of England.
               
                  CHiniton or Chinite king of England;
who raigned about the
yeare of Christ 1025. was of so
haughtie and so great a mind, that he
caused a royal throne to be prepared
and erected for him neare the sea
side: and seeing the tide to beat with
the waues against his seat, he spake
out aloud vnto the sea: Thou art my
subiect, and the land whereon I am
set is mine: and therefore I forbid
thee to rise against my land, or to

wet the bodie and apparell of thy
Lord and maister: the sea notwithstanding
holding on his course in
flowing, came to wet his feete, which
he seeing presently gaue backe and
said: Now may all men know, that
all humane power is but meere vanitie:
and no mortall man is worthy to
beare the name of a king, but he only
to whose commaund the heauens,
the earth, and the sea by a perpetuall
decree are subiect and obedient.
            
            
               A pleasant conceipt of an Italian Gentleman,
vpon the interpretation
of the names of two Popes.
               AFter the death of Pope Alexander
the sixt, Nicholas the fifth being
created Pope, certain Italian Gentlemen
walking in the Popes hall, deuised
together of the death of the one
and the creation of the other, and of
the conditions of thē both. Amongst
them was maister Antonio Agnello,
who with a good grace said vnto the
rest of the company: My maisters:
you need not much to trouble your

selues in giuing your iudgements of
the two Popes: for I beleeue that
these two inscriptions will easily resolue
vs of our doubts: and so saying
he cast his eye vpon one of the two
portals of the hall: and standing still
shewed them with his finger this inscription:
               
                  Alexander PP. VI. which signifieth:
Alexander Pope the sixth of that
name. See (said he) what this inscription
doth import: Is it not as much
as to say: that Alexander was made
Pope by force? Let vs see now if we
can vnderstand any thing touching
the new Pope: & then turning himselfe
(as if it had bene at aduentures)
to the other portall, he shewed them
this inscription: N. PP. V. which signifieth
Nicholas Pope the fifth. O Lord
God (quoth he) see, here is ill newes:
Nihil Papa valet: that in English is:
The Pope is nothing woorth.
            
            
               An honourable act of
an Italian
Lord.
               
                  
AN Italian Nobleman surnamed
the grand Captaine, being set at
his table, and seeing two Gentlemen
(who had serued very valiantly in the
warres) to stand below in his hall because
the seates at the table were all
filled: he immediatly arose, and caused
all the rest of his guests to make
place for these two, saying: Make
place I pray for these two Gentlemen
to dine: for if they had not bene in
our company elsewhere, we should
not haue had at this time whereof to
eate.
            
            
               Of a mocke which he gaue to another
Gentleman.
               THe same Captaine seeing a Gentleman
of his own come before
him in good order, and richly armed
after the battell of Serignolle: and
when all things were safe and in quiet:
he said vnto his company: We
neede not now feare any storme, for
Saint Hermes hath appeared vnto vs.
By this quippe he taxed the Gentleman

to be of small valour, for comming to
the field after al daunger of fight was
past: for the common opinion is, that
Saint Hermes doth vse to appeare at
sea to the Mariners, after that the furie
of a tempest at sea is gone & past.

Gentleman touching
himselfe.
               
                  DIego Garsia Spanish Gentleman
counselled the grand Captaine
Gonsaluo, to withdraw himselfe from
a place of great daunger where the
Artillerie of the enemie did play vpō
them: O (quoth he) seeing that God
hath not put any feare in thy courage,
do not thou seeke to put any in
mine.
            
            
               Of the brother of the
great Turke.
               
                  GEin Ottoman brother vnto the
great Turke being prisoner at
Rome, and seeing the Gentlemen of

                  Italy to iust a
                     •
                  d tilt together: he said:
That that manner of turney (in his
opinion) seemed too much to be
done in sport, and too little to be
done in earnest.
               It happened on a time that one in
the presence of this Turke, highly
commended the young king Ferdinand
of Naples, in regard he was a
man of excellent agility and actiue of
his person for running, vaulting, leaping
and other corporall exercises of
that kind: whereof he tooke occasiō
to say: That in his countrey, those
were the exercises of slaues: and that
the young Gentlemen and Noblemen
did learne to practise bountie
and liberalitie, and that by such vertues
they made themselues the more
commendable.
               Liberalitie is a vertue whereby Princes
do purchase and entertaine the loue
both of their subiects and of strangers.

sitting at the table in companie
of many Gentlemen: one of them
after he had eaten vp all the broth,
tooke his porenger with that little
that remained and threw it on the
ground: saying withall (as it were by
way of excuse) my Lord, I pray pardon
me: whereupon the Marquesse
suddenly answered: Demand pardō
of the swine: for if there be any harm
done it is to them and not to me.

               THe lord Iohn de Gonzaga playing
and loosing his money at dice,
saw that his sonne Alexander did
grieue at his losse: whereupon he
said vnto some Gentlemen there present:
It is written of Alexander the
Great, that when he heard of a victorie
gotten by his father Philip king
of Macedon, and of a realme which
he had conquered: he fell on weeping:
and being demaunded the
cause why he wept: he answered:
Because his father got so many
Countreys, that he doubted lest he

would leaue none for him to conquer:
Cleane contrarie (said he) doth
my son Alexander: for seeing me to
loose, he is afraid lest I will lose so
much, as I will leaue little or nothing
for him to lose.

Italian Painter to tvvo
Cardinals.
               THe excellent and famous painter
Raphael of Vrbin being very
inward with two Cardinals they (to
see what he would say vnto them) in
his presence found fault with a certaine
table or picture of his making,
wherein S. Peter and S. Paule were
painted, saying: That the visage of
those two images were too red:
whereunto he quickly made answer:
My lords, thinke not much that they
looke so red: for I haue painted thē
as they now are in heauen: and this
rednesse in their faces commeth of
pure shame which they haue to see
the Church so ill gouerned by such
men as you are.
            
            
               
               A prudent counsell of Laurence
de Medicis.
               SEigneur Lavvrence de Medicis not
knowing how to restraine the excessiue
liberalitie of his sonne Cosmus
de Medicis, who vsed to giue vnmeasurable
summes both of gold and siluer
to his fauorites: and not willing
to haue either his sonne noted of prodigalitie,
nor himselfe of auarice: &
yet being withall more vnwilling to
tell him of it, because he would not
discontent him: he deuised a very subtill
and honest pollicie how to effect
his desire, which was this: He commaunded
his pursebearer, that when
his sonne did demaund any money
of him, that he should not deny him
any, but should giue it him whatsoeuer
he desired, yet with this conditiō,
that Seigneur Cosmus himselfe should
count and tell out the money which
he desired. Within a while the sonne
came to the pursebearer, & demanded
8000. duckets, which he meant
to giue for a present to some great

personage: the pursebearer said vnto
him: that he wold gladly deliuer him
the summe he desired, vpon condition
that himselfe would count it out,
according as he had in charge giuen
him from his Lord and maister Seigneur
Laurence. Cosmus accepting the
offer, fell to telling of his duckets, but
he had not counted the two thousand
of them, but he began to bewearie,
because he thought too much time
lost from his accustomed pleasures,
insomuch as in the midst of his count
he left all: and fell into consideration
with himselfe that the summe was
too great to giue away: and so determined
from thencefoorth to be no
more so prodigall.
            
            
               A counsell of Cosmus de Medicis.
               A Certaine man had obtained an
office neare vnto Florence, by the
meanes and mediation of Cosmus de
Medicis, of whome he demaunded
his aduice, what meanes he might
vse in his office for the good managing
of his affaires: Seigneur Cosmus
answered him: Cloth thy selfe with
scarlet, and speake little.
               
                  
The man that speaketh litle cannot be
conuinced of folly: and a goodly habite
(were it on a beast) vvill get
him reputation: but a vvise man wil
soone find a difference.
            
            
               A speech of a Pope.
               THe Bishop of Seruia desirous to
sound the Popes mind, touching
a sute which he would gladly haue
graunted him, said vnto him: Holy
Father: it is a common speech ouer
all Rome, and in your pallace: that
your Holinesse hath made me Gouernour
of the citie: whereunto the
Pope answered: Let them say what
they list: they are some leud fellowes
that talke so: But do not you beleeue
it to be so: for you shall find it nothing
lesse.
            
            
               The death of the Chauncelor of Millain.
               
                  LEvvis Sforce being in the castell
of Millain: and perceiuing that
the army of the French king Levvis
the twelfth was comming to besiege
him, demaunded of Maister

                  Sico his Chauncellour: what he
thought the best meane to gard and
defend his castell against the French:
he answered: L'amor de gli huomini:
The loue of the people. The duke
storming very exceedingly at his
speech: and knowing that the Chancellour
was well beloued of the Millanois,
entred into a suspition of him,
that he had a purpose to depriue him
of his principalitie. And to set his
mind at quiet from this conceipt, he
caused the Chauncellour to be beheaded
on a high scaffold in an open
and publike place. The Chauncelor
before his death complaining of the
crueltie of the said Levvis, said these
words: Ameil cappo á te il stato: which
is, as if he would say: Thou causest
me to lose my head: but others will
make thee lose thy Seigneurie and
state: which was in the end well verified:
for within a small time after,
hauing lost the Duchie and castell of
Millaine, he was led prisoner into
Fraunce where he died in great miserie.
               The loue of the subiects is the most firme

pillar for any Prince to leane vnto:
for vvhere hatred raigneth, a Prince
hath no assurance. Also many men
at their death do foreshevv things to
come, and that oftentimes, by the iust
iudgement of the deuine vengeance.
            
            
               A saying of Pope Alexander
the sixth.
               VVHen king Charles the eighth
passed into Italy towards the
realme of Naples, (which he conquered
in a very short time:) Pope Alexander
the sixth who then liued, said:
The French men are come into this
countrey with their spurres made of
wood, and with chalke in their hands
as though they came like Friers, to
marke out their lodgings without any
further labour or trauell.
               By this speech he noted, with what ease
& facilitie the French atchieued the
conquest of the kingdome of Naples.
            
            
               The ansvver of the Countie of Nansot.
               THe Earle of Nansot Lieutenant
for the Emperour Charles the

fifth, hauing besieged the towne of
Peronne which held for the French:
the Queene of Hungarie, sister to the
Emperour, and Regent of that countrie
for him, sent letters vnto the said
Earle, the contents whereof were:
That she was ashamed and much
maruelled how he could spend so
long time before Peronne, which was
but esteemed but in manner of a
douecote? whereunto he returned
this answer: that true it was the towne
was but a little douecote: but yet the
pigoens which were within it were
strong and not easie to be taken.
               A small place, the stronger it is, the
more difficult it is to be gotten: and it
is more easie to be defended, vvhen the
defendants are vvell appointed and
furnished for resistance.
            
            
               Of the Lord of Trimouille.
               KIng Frauncis the first ordinarily
did vse to go to Masse in his
Chappell: but the lord of Trimouille
would euer go to the publick church
that was next adioyning; and being

on a time demaunded why he went
not to heare Masse in the Chappell
with the king: he answered: I will go
thither where my great maister is.
            
            
               An act of the Duchesse
of Burbon.
               THe report is that the Duchesse
of Burbon had in her house a certain
damosell, who through loue suffered
her selfe to be gotten with
child: for which fault she being
sharpely reprehended, to purge her
selfe she said, that a gentleman in
the house had enforced and rauished
her against her will. The gentleman
came to the presence of the Dutches
to excuse himselfe: whereupon the
Dutchesse tooke his Rapier, and put
it into the damosels hand that accused
him, keeping the scabbard in her
owne hand, and then said vnto her:
Put the Rapier into this scabbard: &
as she endeuoured to put it therein:
the Duchesse holding the scabbard
to her, stirred her hand vp and
down, so as by any means the damsel

could not sheath it: then the Dutches
said vnto her: If thou hadst done as
thou seest me do with this scabbard,
then this mischaunce had neuer befalne
thee.
               It is impossible for a vvoman to be forced
against her vvill: notvvithstanding
that vvhich is reported of Lucrece.
            
            
               Another act of a Dutchesse.
               I Haue heard the report of another
act which was most excellent and
worthie to be had in remembrance.
A great Prince of Fraunce by the
counsell of some of his friends, and
with the Popes dispensation had caused
a separation betweene him and
his wife, onely because she had no
issue of her body, which he imputed
to her disabilitie: and thereupon maried
another wife. Within a small
time after, this Noble man remembring
himselfe of his first wife, sent
vnto her on a Newyeares day a most
rich and precious robe by a Gentleman
his familiar friend, who presented

it vnto the Lady the same day.
The Princesse receiuing the robe, after
long speech had with the Gentleman,
demaunded if it were her husband
of himselfe that sent her this
present: and being assured by him
that it came directly from her husband:
she presently cut it asunder, &
separated the vpper frō the neather
part: and afterwards deliuering the
vpper part of the garment backe vnto
the Gentleman, she said vnto him:
My friend: thanke your maister from
me for the loue and affection that he
seemeth to continue towards me: &
carrie him backe againe this part of
his robe, and tell him from me, that
he keepe well the vpper part: and for
the neather part, let him not doubt
but I will looke well vnto it, & keep
it safely as long as it shall please God
to lend me life.
               By this conceipt the Princesse meant that
she vvould during her life keepe her
chastitie vvithout marying againe,
vvhich she did vvith great patience
and constancie.
            
            
               
               A christian saying of the Emperour
Charles the fifth.
               AFter the victorie which Charles
the fifth, obtained against Iohn
Fredericke duke of Saxonie Elector of
the Empire, who was taken prisoner
in a battel foughten betweene them:
the Emperour said all openly: I cannot

                     〈…〉
                   
                  Iulius Caesar said: Veni, vidi,
vici: 
                  
                     〈…〉
                   will onely say: Veni, vidi,
& 
                        〈◊〉
                      Deus vicit.
               
            
            
               A braue ansvver of the Countie
of Anguien.
               
                  FRauncis of Burbon Earle of Anguien,
being for king Frauncis in
Piemont against the armie of the
Emperour Charles the fifth, whereof
was chiefe General the Marquesse of
Guast: the said Marquesse sent this
message vnto the said Lord of Anguien,
(who was very young) that his
beard was to little for him to haue
the hardinesse to meete him in battel.

Whereunto the Lord of Anguien
sent this answer: That it was not with
their beards that the French did vse
to fight: but that as this was the office
of their swords: so with the sword
he came to seeke him and to offer
him battell.
               There are many affaires of great importance,
vvherein regard is to be had
not to the age, but to the prudence &
experience of him that hath the managing
of them.
            
            
               A sharpe and pleasant speech
of a foole belonging to
the Marquesse of
Guast.
               BEfore the battell foughten at Serizoles,
the same Marquesse of
Guast assuring himselfe of the victorie,
gaue vnto one that was his iester
afaire gilt Armour, and a Iener of
Spaine, promising him (ouer and aboue
that of his owne good grace
and pleasure) to giue him fiue hundred
duckets, to the intent he should
be the first that should go & cary vnto

his lady the Marquesse the newes of
his victorie. It happened (as good
fortune would) that the French gained
the iourney, and the Emperours
armie was defeated. Amongst the
Spaniards that were taken prisoners,
this iester of the Marquesse hapned
to be one: who by reason he was so
well mounted & armed, was thought
to be some great Lord or Knight: &
being brought before the Lord of
Anguien after he had a while questioned
with him, he knew him what he
was: and demaunding of him who
had furnished him in that good order:
the iester answered: My lord the
Marquesse gaue me my horse and
armes: and should haue giuen me besides
fiue hundred duckets to go and
tell my ladie his wife the first tidings
of his victorie: but I beleeue (said he)
that the Marquesse will gaine the
money himselfe, and that he is posted
thither in person.
            
            
               Of a Parmisan that by his subtilty
saued himselfe from
trouble.
               
                  
A Certaine man at armes a Parmisan,
passing by Saluces arriued
into a publike place, in the middest
whereof was an high columne or pillar
erected, vpon the which was pitched
an Eagle imperiall: to the which
this souldier casting vp his eyes very
attentiuely, as if he had bene suddenly
astonished, he began in manner of
cursing to say: Oh foule mischiefe
may befall him that set thee there so
high! Diuerse standing there by, and
walking vp and downe in that place,
acquainted the Magistrate with this
speech of the Parmisan: who being
led before the Iustice, and demaunded
if he had spoken such words as
were obiected against him: he confessed
that he had spoken them: and
that the occasion which moued him
to say so, was, for that the Eagle was
set ouer high. For (said he) I beare so
great reuerence and loue to the Eagle
which representeth the Maiestie
imperiall, that if it had bene below
where I might haue reached it, I
would not haue spared to haue embraced

and kissed it. By this answer
turned contrarie to the intendment
and expectation of them all, he saued
himselfe from trouble, and was suffered
to depart safely out of the
towne.
               Necessitie vvill sometime constraine a
man to avvaken his spirits: and to auoide
daunger to turne his vvords in
a double sense.
            
            
               An honorable opinion of the
Dolphinesse of
Fraunce.
               
                  MArgaret daughter to the king of
Scots, and wife to the Dolphine
of Fraunce, who was afterwards king
Levvis the eleuenth, passing on a
time through a hall, where lay sleeping
on a bench Alan Chartier Secretarie
to king Charles the seuenth, a
man of singular learning, and a most
excellent Poet and Oratour in the
French toung, went to kisse his
mouth in the presence of al her companie.
Whereupon one of those who
attended her, said: Madame: It is verie

straunge that you should kisse a
fellow so filthie and deformed. She
answered: I did not kisse the man but
the mouth, out of which hath proceeded
so many excellent conceipts,
graue matters, and most eloquent
speeches.
               The goods of the mind are to be preferred
before the beautie of the body: and
many times in vessels of base stuffe,
are enclosed most precious liquours.
            
            
               The subtill request of Iohn de Menu,
to saue himselfe from the
furie of certaine
Ladies.
               QVite contrarie to the former
act, was that which a Queene
of Fraunce with her ladies did vnto
Iohn de Menu the first and principall
Poet of the French nation: for he
hauing composed that renowned
booke of The Roman of the Rose: (in
the which he bringeth in a iealous
man, that speaketh all the euill that
possibly can be imagined of women
and their dispositions) by reason

thereof he incurred the indignation
and displeasure of the Queene and
other Ladies, who determined to be
reuenged of him. One day therefore
the Queen by the means of the other
Ladies did so much that she got Iohn
de Menu in her power, and hauing reuiled,
iniuried and threatened him
exceedingly for speaking ill of womenkind:
she commaunded her damosels
to strippe him naked, and to
tye him to a pillar, purposing that
they themselues should scourge him.
He seeing that all the reasons and excuses
which he could make, could
not preuaile against their rage and
furie, humbly intreated that before
they began to execute their wrath
and malice vpon him, it wold please
the Queene to graunt him one request,
which with great difficultie he
obtained. Well then (quoth he) faire
Ladies, seeing you haue vouchsafed
me this fauour, as to condescend vnto
my demaund: I pray you that the
most arrant and notorious whore in
all your company may begin to
whippe me, and to giue me the first

stripe. This said, they were all confounded
and amazed, and left him alone
at his libertie.
            
            
               The answer of the Lord Chabanes
to king Lewis the eleuenth.
               KIng Levvis the eleuenth hauing
giuen charge to Baluë Bishop of
Eureux to go take and receiue the
muster of the men of armes in Paris:
The lord of Chabanes great Maister
of Fraunce requested the king to
graunt him a Commission to go and
reforme the Chanons of the Church
of Eureux. Why (quoth the king) that
is no fit and conuenient charge for
you: yea but (said he) this is as well
befitting to my estate and calling, as
it is for the Bishop of Eureux to haue
to do with the ordering of men at
armes.
            
            
               A historie of a Radish giuen to king
Lewis the eleuenth.
               THe same king Levvis being but
yet Dolphin of Fraunce did for a

certaine time soiourne and remain
in Burgundie for feare of his father:
during the which, vsing to take his
pleasure and recreation in hunting,
he did often frequent and resort to
the cottage of a poore forrester named
Conon (as it is often seene that
great Princes do sometimes take
pleasure to be familiar with people
of meane reckening) with whome
taking his repast, he did vse diuerse
times to eate Radishes. Afterwards
coming to be king, this poore fellow
Conon (by the perswasion of his wife)
in hope to feele the bountie and liberalitie
of the Prince, came into
Fraunce, and brought with him of
the fairest Radishes of his garden, to
make a present of them to his Maiestie:
but by constraint of hunger
for want of victuals on the way, he
was enforced to eate them vp al saue
one, which was the greatest and fairest
of them all. Being come to the
Court, he was knowne by the king,
who sent for him to his presence, and
he good man verie cheerefully presented
the great Radish vnto his Maiestie.

The king tooke it and accepted
it very graciously, and caused one
that was neare about him to lay it
vp amongst his chiefest and most
precious iewels: and after he made
the forrester to dine well, he gaue
him a thousand Crownes and so dismissed
him. It happened not long after,
that a Courtier vpon a vaine hope
presented the king with a very goodly
horse, of a most excellent making
and perfection in all parts: supposing
that the king would recompence
him for him most bountifully. The
king bethinking himselfe wherwith
he might reward him, remembred
him of his Radish, which being wrapped
vp in white paper, he gaue to the
Courtier: telling him that he should
accept of that in good part. The gentleman
returning to his lodging, and
hoping to find some great treasure,
vnfolded his packet and found nothing
but a Radish: whereupon he
went and made his complaint vnto
the king, thinking that he had but
mistaken one thing for another:
but the king presently made him this

answer: Passion of God, man: I think
I haue well payed for thy horse: for
the present which I gaue thee cost
me a thousand crownes.
               This vvas a most royall kind of liberalitie,
in recompensing bountifully the
good affections and long trauels of a
poore man vvell deseruing: and to revvard
the audacious according to his
demerites.
            
            
               The speech of a President of Paris
to king Levvis the
twelfth.
               A Great Lord of Fraunce betaking
himselfe to force of armes, violently
entred the prison of the Castle
of Paris, and tooke thence a Gentleman
of his house who was held there
prisoner, and led him away. The lord
of Vacquerie chiefe and first President
in the Parliament of Paris being aduertised
of this case, went vnto the
king Levvis the twelfth, vnto whome
(after he had done due reuerence) he
said: Sir, I wonder how you can be
merrie considering the wrong that is

done you, and me thinkes you shold
feele it. Wherfore quoth the king?
Because sir (said he) your right arme
is broken. I vnderstand you not (replyed
the king:) your right arme
sir (quoth the President) is your iustice,
which is now broken and violated:
and so recounted vnto him from
point to point what had happened,
wherewith the king was highly displeased:
and hauing caused the Lord
to be sent for to appeare before him,
he commaunded him to repaire his
fault, and made him to yeeld such satisfaction
as was fit and according to
reason.
               Iustice is that vvherby Princes do raign:
and it is the principall force and
strength to preserue a realme in good
estate.
            
            
               A iudgement of a king of
England.
               A King of England seeing two
Gentlemen earnestly contending
and desiring the combat each
of other for the armes of their houses

(for both of them bore a Buls head
in their shield) before they entred into
the lists to darreine the battell, he
called them both before him seuerally
and in secret, and said vnto them:
As farre as I can perceiue, the onely
thing that induceth you to claim the
combate each of other, is: that the
one of you cannot suffer the other to
carrie the armes of his family: But
if I can bring it to passe, & shew you
how the Armes of your aduersarie
are farre different from yours, will
you be contented to surcease your
quarrell, and to leaue the combate?
Whereunto when either of them had
seuerally consented, the king by a
Herald caused it to be proclaimed,
that he had found a meane to accord
them: and that their armes were diuerse:
for from hencefoorth (quoth
the king) the one shall beare in his
shield the head of a Bull, and the other
the head of a Cow.
               This sentence was vvorthie to be commended:
both in that it sauoured of a
pleasant and vvittie conceipt, and

                     〈◊〉
                   them also from proceeding to the

combate vpon so trifling an occasion.
            
            
               A similitude of the foole of the
Duke of Millain.
               IT happened that there fell a pleasant
controuersie in the presence
of the duke Sforce of Millain, whether
was to be preferred as most worthie
of honour either the Aduocate or the
Phisition. For (said one) the Aduocat
pleadeth causes for the conseruation
of right and equitie, and for the augmentation
both of the priuate and
publicke good. The Phisition (said
another) by his skill and knowledge
keepeth man in health, and freeth
him from sicknes and diseases. Vpon
this debate, the Dukes foole being
in place, began to speake and said:
If it please my lord the Duke that I
shall shew my conceipt vpon this
point, I shall soone end the controuersie.
Marry and good reason (quoth
the duke) speake on hardly, and let
vs heare thy opinion. My lord (said
the foole) you see ordinarily: that

when a felon is led to the gallowes to
be hanged, commonly the theefe
goeth before, and the hangman followeth
after.
               By the theefe be vnderstood the Aduocat,
and by the hangman the Phisition: because
the one often robbeth his Clients
of their money: and the other killeth
his patients with his Phisicke.
               FINIS.
            
         
         
            
            NOTABLE AND
excellent Sentences of ancient
Authors, both Hebrewes,
Greekes, and
Latines: inducing euery
man to liue well and
vertuously.
            FIRST, and aboue all
things, shew thy selfe religious
towards God, not
onely by thy oblations
and sacrifices, but also in keeping the
vowes & promises which thou swearest
vnto him: the one will be an argument
of thy wealth and abilitie:
by the other is knowne thy faith and
honestie.
            2 Honour God daily: but principally
after the manner and fashion
instituted and ordained by thy countrey
wherin thou liuest: to the intent
thou maist be esteemed both deuout
in thy religion, and obedient also to

the lawes: both together and at one
instant.
            3 Be thou such a one in thy behauiour
towards thy parents, as thou
wouldest that thy owne children
(when thou hast any) should be towards
thee.
            4 Vse thy bodie to labour and
exercise, not onely to make it strong
and able, but also healthfull and well
disposed: the which thou maist well
do, if thou vse to make an end of thy
labour, whilest thou art able to continue
and endure labour.
            5 Be not immoderate in thy
laughter, nor too audacious in thy
speech: for the one is a signe of
folly: and the other is an argument
of pride and arrogancie.
            6 That which is dishonest in the
doing, do not thou thinke honest to
be spoken.
            7 Accustome thy self to a countenance
not too much addicted to
sorrow or sadnesse: for that will be
imputed to a proud and loftie spirit:
but shew thy selfe imaginatiue and
secret: for that is an office well beseeming

a mā of wisdom & prudēce.
            8 There is nothing more beseeming
a man, then to be neat, proper,
modest, iust and temperate: all
which things are maruellously fitte
for young men.
            9 Thinke not in the doing of any
ill deed that thou canst conceale
it: for albeit it neuer come to be
knowne of others: yet thou shalt alwaies
find it in the remorce of thy
owne conscience
            10 Feare God: honour thy parents:
reuerence thy friends: obey the
lawes.
            11 Embrace in all honest and
good sort thy pleasure and delectation:
for honest recreation is good,
though the contrarie therof be most
pernicious.
            12 Shun the calumniations of
men to the vttermost of thy power,
yea though they be false and vndeserued:
for the most part of the world
is ignorant of the truth of matters, &
is guided by opiniō, not by iudgmēt.
            13 Whatsoeuer thou dost enterprize
and vndertake, so do it as if it were

to come to the knowledge of all
men: for albeit for a time thou maist
keepe it secret, yet in the end thou
shalt be sure to be discouered.
            14 It is a most sure and readie
way for a man to get credite and estimation,
not to cōmit those things
which he shall reprehend in others
that do the same.
            15 If thou be greedie and desirous
of knowledge, thou shalt be
sure to attaine to knowledge.
            16 The best way for a man to
retaine in memorie that which he
knoweth, is to exercise himselfe continually
to the often remembrance
of it.
            17 That (whereof thou art ignorant)
learne of them that are skilfull:
for it is as shamefull and foule a
thing not to learne a good thing
when thou hearest it: as it is to reiect
his friend in an honest gift when he
presenteth it.
            18 Lay hold of time whilst thou
hast leasure and time to learne: and
be diligent to giue eare vnto those
that are wise and learned: for by this

meane thou shalt easily get vnderstanding
and knowledge of that,
which others haue inuented with
great difficultie.
            19 Preferre knowledge before
wealth and riches: the one soone fadeth,
the other abideth for euer. For
amongst all the goods of this life only
wisedome is immortall.
            20 Be not slacke or negligent to
go into farre and forraine countries,
to learne of those that are famous for
their skill and knowledge in any
good thing or science: for it must
needes be a shame vnto thee, to see
that Merchants will aduenture their
liues to the daunger and hazard of
the seas to enrich themselues: & that
thou being lustie, young, and able,
shouldest not trauell throughout the
world to better thy mind and vnderstanding.
            21 Be thou in thy manners curteous
and full of humanitie: and in
thy speeches affable and friendly:
The courteous person will salute
those whom he meeteth gladly: and
the affable will discourse with them

familiarly.
            22 Make thy selfe pleasing and
agreable to euery man if it be possible:
and acquaint thy selfe onely with
such as are good and vertuous: for in
so doing thou shalt shunne the hatred
of the one, and shalt be sure to get
the fauour of the other.
            23 Frequent not the companie
of one and the same sort of men too
often: nor vse not to discourse too
long of one and the same matter: for
there is nothing but it may be tedious
and wearisome.
            24 Accustome thy selfe gladly
and willingly to endure things with
patience: to the intent thou maist the
better do it, when thou shalt be forced
to sufferance.
            25 Abstain from all such things
wherein thou shalt haue little or no
honestie to be exercised: as to be too
greedie and couetous of gaine, to be
cholericke, voluptuous, or melancholie:
which thou shalt easily do, if
thou esteeme it gaine to get honour
rather then riches: & if thou vse choler
against those that offend thee, as

thou wouldest that others should vse
it towards thee if thou shouldest offend
them: and as thou iudgest it not
seemely to be commaunded of thy
seruants: so is it not fit that thou sholdest
be subiect to thy affections. And
last of all, endure with patience and
constancie misfortunes and aduersitie:
and fixing thine eye and regard
vpon the miseries of other men, consider
that thou thy selfe also art a
man.
            26 Be more carefull to keep thy
word and promise, then the money
which is committed to thee in trust:
for honest and good men ought so
to gouerne themselues, that men
should haue more confidence on
their honestie, then in their oath.
            27 There is no lesse reason for
a man to be distrustful of the wicked
then to giue credite to such as are
good and vertuous.
            28 Reueale not thy secret to any
person liuing, vnlesse they to whom
thou shalt disclose it, haue as great
reason to conceale it in silence, as
thou hast to impart it vnto them.
            
               
29 When thou shalt be enioyned
to take an oath, thou oughtest
for two reasons to accept of it: either
to cleare and purge thy selfe of some
villanous actiō that may be obiected
vnto thee: or to preserue and saue thy
friends from daunger.
            30 Sweare not in any case for
lucre or desire of money, although
thou haue iust occasion to take an
oath: for in so doing, thou shalt be
esteemed of some little better then a
periured person: and of others thou
shalt be held a man wretchedly couetous.
            31 Neuer make choise of anie
man for thy friend, of whome thou
hast not first gotten some informatiō
how he hath vsed his friends before
times: and be thou very well assured
that he will proue such towards thee,
as he hath bene before towards others.
            32 Enter not suddenly or too hastily
into amitie with any man: and
yet after thou hast once professed thy
selfe to be a friend, perseuer in his
friendship (if it be possible) vnto the

end. For as little honestie it is vnto any
man to be without friends, as to
chaunge them and to make choise of
new often.
            33 Make not trial of thy friends
with losse: and yet trie them sometimes:
the which thou maist do, if not
hauing need of them, & before time
of necessitie, thou do faine and make
shew as though thou hadst neede of
them.
            34 Communicate thy affaires
which thou wouldest haue knowne,
as if thou haddest a pretence and purpose
to keepe them secret: for if they
(to whome thou shalt impart them)
do conceale them, thou canst not receiue
any dammage by their secrecy:
but if they do reueale them: then hast
thou good proofe and triall of their
manners and conditions, and thou
maist afterwards take heed of them.
            35 There is no meane so ready
for a man to know his friends, as in
the middest of the misfortunes of
this mortall life: and by the helpe &
succours which they affoord a man
in his affaires. The former maketh a

triall of them as gold is tried by the
fire: and by the latter a man shall
know how to trust his friends in time
of neede.
            36 He that preuenteth the request
and intreatie of his friend, and
succoureth him in time before he be
required, perfourmeth the true dutie
and deuoire of perfect amitie.
            37 Perswade thy selfe that it is
no lesse indignitie to be surmounted
in benefites by thy friends, then it is
to suffer them to be ouerborne with
the iniuries of their enemies.
            38 Receiue into thy amitie not
onely those which haue compassion
of thy aduersities, but them also
which are not enuious of thy prosperitie.
For there are many who will
condole the misfortunes of their
friends, and yet afterwards when they
see them in prosperitie, will enuie
their good fortune.
            39 Vse to talke often of thy
friends which are absent, before them
that are present: to the intent they
may perceiue and be perswaded, that
thou wilt not be forgetfull of them

likewise, when they shall be absent
and farre away from thee.
            40 Let the furniture and ornaments
of thy person be fit and sutable
for thine honour, but not too curious:
for the one is seemely and befitting
a man of great estate and magnificence:
the other appertaineth to
persons effeminate, and such as delight
in superfluitie.
            41 Esteeme not of those, who
haue care of nothing else then to
heape vp riches, not being able to
vse them: they are like to those men
that haue goodly horses, and know
not how to ride them.
            42 Spare not to get riches; yet
so, as thou do not only seeke to haue
the possession of them, but that thou
labour also to haue the true vse of
them: for the true fruition of riches
yeeldeth pleasure vnto thē that know
how to take it: and the possession of
them serueth vnto those that can
rightly vse them.
            43 Esteeme of goods for two
reasons: the one that thou maist by

their meanes free thy selfe from an
inconuenience: the other that thou
maist be able to succour and helpe any
honest man thy friend in time of
his necessitie.
            44 Care not to attaine to that fashion
and kind of life, which being
excessiue and superfluous, is vsed by
other men: but regard the mean and
moderate estate.
            45 Grieue not nor trouble thy
selfe at thy estate and condition present:
but labour to amend and better
it.
            46 Neuer reproch any man with
his miserie and calamitie: for asmuch
as the like fortune is common to all
in generall: and there is no man that
knoweth what will befall him.
            47 Succour and releeue the good
in their time of need: for this is a
great treasure, to do good vnto those
that are vertuous, and to bind them
vnto thee by thy benefites.
            48 He that doth good vnto the
wicked, is like vnto him that giueth
meate vnto another mans dogges:
for they barke aswell at him as at

others whom they meete: and euen
so do the wicked men vse to wrong
and iniurie those that releeue them,
as others that do trouble and hurt
them.
            49 Abhorre flatterers no lesse
then common cousiners: for both of
them do exceedingly deceiue such as
haue any trust or confidence in them.
            50 If thy friends do not abandon
and forsake thee in euil matters,
much more reason will they haue to
aide thee in all good actions.
            51 Let thy cariage and behauiour
be familiar, and not too graue
and austere towards those that conuerse
with thee. For seruants can
hardly beare the haughtinesse and
pride of their maisters: and all sorts
of people, do gladly fashion and
frame themselues to conuerse with
those that are priuate and familiar
with them. The way to be accounted
companiable, is: not to be quarrelsome,
troublesome, nor contentious:
and moreouer, that thou do not too
rudely crosse thy friend in his choler,
(although he haue growne into it

vpon a wrong occasion) but rather
yeeld and giue way vnto him during
his anger: and when it is ouerpast,
reprehend him friendly
            52 Affect not nor accustome thy
selfe to grauitie in trifling matters,
nor trifle not in matters of grauitie
and importance: for whatsoeuer is
done out of season is troublesome
and tedious.
            53 Be not vnpleasing in doing
of a pleasure to any man: as we see
many vse to do, who know not how
to do a pleasure to their friends with
a good and gracious countenance.
            54 It is a very troublesome thing
to be giuen to be quarrellous: and
for any man to studie and beate his
braines how to reproue another, doth
but incense and irritate men.
            55 Gouerne thy selfe with moderation
and modestie in thy drinke:
but if it happen that thou fall into
companie, arise and depart rather
then be ouercome with drinking: for
whē the spirit is possessed with wine,
it is like vnto a chariot or coach horses,
which hauing ouerthrowne their

coachman, do runne here and there
without all order, hauing none to
guide and direct them: so is the soule
of a man very much offended, when
the vnderstanding is distempered and
troubled.
            56 Propōund vnto thy self things
immortal, as a man of courage and
magnanimitie: & vpō mortall things
so set thy affections, as thou do vse
thy goods which thou hast with moderation
and modestie.
            57 Knowledge ought to be preferred
before ignorance for many
reasons, and especially for that in all
other things which are odious, yet
there is some profite to be found: but
ignorance onely is euer noysome &
hurtful to the ignorant, & doth make
them beare the paine of those offences
which they commit, euen in speaking
ill of others. When thou wouldest
win the friendship and loue of any
one, speake well of him vnto thē
who may make report thereof vnto
him.
            58 The beginning of friendship
is praise & cōmendation: & the original

of emnitie and hatred, is detraction
and contempt.
            59 When thou wilt consult vpō
any case, take example by that which
is past vpon that which is to come:
for it is easie to vnderstand that which
is obscure & vncertain by that which
hath bene formerly manifest and
certaine.
            60 Be not too hastie in thy deliberations:
but when thou hast resolued
vpon any enterprize, put it speedily
in execution.
            61 Thinke that the greatest blessing
that can befall thee from God,
is to enioy true felicitie: and that the
greatest good that can light vpon
thee by thine owne industrie, is good
counsell.
            62 When thou doubtest with
hardinesse to vndertake any matter,
communicate the same with thy
friends, and conferre with them vpō
it, making shew as if it were some other
mans case: in so doing thou shalt
know their opinion without discouering
thy owne secrets.
            63 When thou wilt deliberate

of any matter of importance with another,
consider first how he hath
caried himselfe in the like affaires of
his owne: for it is very vnlikely that
he which hath ill managed his owne
proper businesse, can well and prouidently
dispatch the affaires of another.
            64 There is nothing that doth
more incite a man to bethinke himselfe
for the good ordering of his affaires,
then to regard the losses and
dammage which he hath formerly
receiued by his own indiscretion: for
it is commonly seene, that we are
more carefull of our health, when we
call to memorie the extreame dolours
which we haue suffered in time
of our sicknesse.
            65 Follow the manners & conditions
of Princes, and accommodate
thy selfe to their manner of liuing:
for in so doing, thou shalt bring
them to thinke that their doings are
to thy liking: whereof it will ensue,
that thou shalt both purchase more
authoritie and estimation amongst
the people: and thou shalt be the better

assured to stand in the good grace
and fauour of thy Prince.
            66 Be obedient to the Edicts &
Ordinances made by Princes: with
this opinion notwithstanding, that
there is no law which hath so much
strength and efficacie as their liues:
for as it is very requisite for those that
are gouerned by a popular estate, to
honour the people: so it behoueth
him that liueth vnder a Monarchie,
to admire and reuerence his Prince.
            67 Whensoeuer thou shalt be
aduanced to any dignitie, in any case
vse not the aide and assistance of such
as are wicked in any charge or affairs
of consequence whatsoeuer: because
the blame of all the mischiefe and
wickednesse by them committed,
shall be imputed continually vnto
thee.
            68 Whensoeuer thou leauest any
place of publike charge, do it rather
with a good credite and reputation,
then with the request of great
wealth and riches: for the praise and
commendations of the people ought
to be preferred farre before riches.
            
               
69 Take heed that thou giue
no aide nor assistance to any wicked
action, nor that thou countenance
the same with thy company: for the
faults of those whom thou fauourest
will be imputed vnto thee as thine
owne.
            70 So carrie thy selfe in thy behauior,
as thou maist be alwaies sure
to haue the aduantage and preheminence
aboue others: yet so neuer thelesse
as thou euer embrace equitie: to
the intent that men may thinke thee
to loue and embrace iustice, not for
want of power to do wrong, but of
pure loue to honestie and modestie.
            71 It is farre better to be poore
and honest, then to be rich and wicked.
For certainely iustice is better
then riches: because the latter is onely
profitable to men liuing: but the
former maketh a man to be honoured
euen after his decease. Besides,
adde hereunto: that riches are oftentimes
distributed and bestowed vpon
wicked and leud persons, who cannot
in any sort notwithstanding participate
of vertue and iustice.
            
               
72 Be not a follower of those
that seeke to enrich themselues by
vnlawfull and vniust gaine: but of
those rather, who can be content to
sustaine losse so they may be reputed
honest and good men: for admit that
iust men haue no other aduantage or
preheminence aboue the wicked: yet
herein at least do they surmount thē,
in that they haue good and vertuous
hopes.
            73 Haue a care to embrace all
that which concerneth the life of mā:
but principally and aboue all, exercise
prudence: for it is not a thing of
small reck ening, for a man to haue a
bodie endowed and beautified with
a mind of good vnderstanding.
            74 Accustome thy bodie to labour
& trauell, & thy mind to knowledge
and learning: to the intent that
by the meane and helpe of the one,
thou maist be able to execute that
which shall seeme good vnto thee: &
by the aide of the other, thou maist
foresee that which shall be for thy
profite and commoditie.
            75 Bethinke thy selfe well of

that which thou art to speake: for of
tentimes the toung runneth before
the thought.
            76 Esteeme not any thing in
this world to be stable and certaine:
for so shalt thou not reioyce ouermuch
in thy prosperitien, or waxe ouer
sad or dismayed with aduersitie.
            77 There be two occasions wherin
thou maist freely and boldly speak
thy mind: the first is, in things which
thou knowest perfectly & assuredly:
the other is, in matters that do necessarily
concerne thee: in both which,
it is more expedient for thee to speak
liberally, then to be silent or say little.
As concerning al other matters, it is
farre better to be silent, then to talke
of them.
            78 Take thy honest pleasure and
recreation of any thing that is good:
and whatsoeuer euill befalleth thee,
endure and beare it quietly and contentedly.
            79 Be close and secret to thy vttermost
in any thing that concerneth
thee: for it is small wisedome, and to
little purpose, to keepe thy wealth

streight locked vp within thy house:
and to haue thy mind laid open to
the world.
            80 It behooueth any man of
discretion to feare reproch more thē
any daunger whatsoeuer.
            81 Death is fearefull and terrible
to faint hearted and wicked persons:
but the good & vertuous ought
not to feare any thing but dishonour
and ignominie.
            82 It is good for a man to liue
in the greatest assurance that he can
possibly: howbeit, if he be constrained
to hazard and aduenture himself,
it is more fit that he cōtend & striue
with it honestly, then to shun & flye
from it shamefully, considering that
we are all destinated to die: but nature
hath onely ordained and framed
them that are vertuous to dye valiantly
and couragiously.
            And now to conclude, if thou find
that most of these precepts are nor fit
and agreable to thy age, maruell not
hereat: for I my selfe do thinke no
lesse: notwithstanding I thought it
not amisse by one and the same

meane, both to giue thee counsel for
the time present, and to leaue thee
also precepts for the time to come:
wherein thou maiest with more facilitie
know what is most fit and conuenient
to be vsed: for thou shalt very
hardly find any man that wil counsell
thee friendly and faithfully, and
therefore I was not willing to omit
any thing, which I thought would be
for thy profi
                  •
               : to the intent thou sholdest
not be driuen, to borrow ought
of others: but here to find of freecost
whatsoeuer shall be fit to serue
thy turne. And I shall hold my selfe
also much bounden to thanke God,
when I shallsee that I am not deceiued
of that good opinion which I
haue conceiued of you. For euen as
it is a common thing with men, to
delight themselues in things which
are pleasant, rather then such as are
wholesome: so do they more willingly
conuerse with such as are of
corrupt behauiour, and like vnto
themselues, then with those that seek
to correct and amend them of their
ill dispositions. Neuertheles I thinke

that thou wilt be of a contrarie opinion,
if thou do but take a coniecture
of the labour and trouble which
thou shalt endure by addicting thy
selfe to the studie of other disciplines.
For it is very likely, that he which cō
               maundeth
himselfe to do good and
vertuous acts, will willingly giue eare
to others who exhort him vnto vertue.
Now there is no better meane
to incite and prouoke thee to enterprize
laudable deedes and actions,
then to consider how the true pleasure
and contentment reaped by thē
doth still continue and abide with vs:
and on the contrarie, how idlenesse
and deliciousnesse doth soone grow
wearisome and tedious: adde therewithall,
that voluptuous pleasures are
alwaies accompanied with troubles
and molestations: but to trauell for
vertue, and to liue soberly, bringeth
with it true pleasure, and such as is alwaies
durable. I deny not but that in
the beginning voluptuousnesse may
yeeld vnto a man some pleasure and
delectation, howbeit sorrow & grief
doth soone ouertake it. but in vertue

after great labours and trauels commeth
true rest, contentment and perfect
pleasure. Now certaine it is that
in all our affaires we haue more regard
to the issue and end thereof, thē
to the beginning: and we do in a maner
estimate all our actions by their
euents. Moreouer, it is to be considered,
how the wicked are neuer at a
stay of their wicked actions, but do
continue in that fashion and manner
of life which they haue taken at the
beginning: and the vertuous do hold
it in no sort lawfull to leaue vertue,
vnlesse they will wholly yeeld themselues
to be a scorne and reproofe to
the whole world: for this is to be noted,
that men do not so much hate
them that are notoriously vicious, as
those which boast themselues to be
good and vertuous, when indeede
they are nothing different from the
common and worst sort. Now if we
do blame lyers for their leasings,
much more reason haue we to reproue
them, which in the whole
course of their liues are depraued and
corrupted: who do not onely therein

offer wrong vnto themselues, but do
(as it were) betray that good fortune
which is put into their hands, euen
riches, honour, and aboundance of
friends: and yet neuerthelesse do
make themselues vnworthie of their
present felicitie. Furthermore, if mā
which is mortal, would but seeke to
obserue and regard the will of the
immortall Gods, I suppose he should
easily and euidently know and vnderstand
it: because euen in those that
were most neare and deare vnto thē,
they haue testified and made known
what difference they make betweene
the vertuous and the vicious. For Iupiter
hauing ingendred both Hercules
and Tantalus, is said to haue made
the one immortall for his vertue, and
to haue condemned the other to
grieuous punishment and torments
for his leud life and wickednesse.
            In imitation therefore of these examples,
it is fit and conuenient for
men to loue honestie, and to follow
vertue: and not onely to relye vpon
these precepts, but to learne also the
most choise ensignements of the

most famous and excellent Poets, &
to reade the writings of other good
Authours. And as the Bees flying &
lighting on all sorts of flowers, do
take of each that which is fit and proper
for honie: so it behooueth them
that desire knowledge and vnderstanding,
to leaue nothing that good is
vnprooued, and to make profit of all
that commeth to their knowledge:
and yet when they haue vsed all and
their vttermost diligence to that effect,
it will be very hard and difficult
notwithstanding to correct the vices
and imperfections of nature.

               Of the power of God.
               CHAP. I.
               
                  THE Poet Pindarus seeing
men disputing of
the nature of the soueraign
and supreme God,
said: that they went about to gather
an imperfect fruit of wisedome.
               2 A certaine Astrologer being
in a place where was a table hauing
the starres therein painted, shewed
them vnto some standers by, & said:
These starres here be the wandering
starres. Diogenes being in companie,
said vnto him: My friend lye not: for
assuredly those be not the wandering
starres, but these be they: and in so
saying, pointed to the men that stood
about him.
               3 Eusebius the Philosopher was
wont to say: That it was a very hard
and difficult thing to know God: and
that we cannot tell in what manner
he is to be comprehended: because

we are not sufficient with the bodie,
to expresse a thing without a bodie:
and a perfect thing cannot be comprehēded
of that which is imperfect:
and a thing eternall hath no agreement
or correspondencie with that
which is finite. The life of man is
short, and passeth away speedily: but
God is euerlasting, and is truth, whereas
man is but a shadow of imagination.
There is as great difference betweene
a feeble man and a strong,
betweene a little dwarfe and a giant:
as there is betweene one that is dead,
and one that is immortall. Imagine
then what God is, who cannot be expressed
nor declared with humane
vtterance.
               4 Camillus a Captaine of the
Romains was wont to say thus: Thou
shalt find that all things do happen
prosperous to men that follow and
serue God: and that things fall out
aduerse to those that contemne and
despise God.
               5 Seneca the morall Philosopher
said: That the Gods euen to vngratefull
men do vse to giue many things.
               
                  
6 Tertullian the Diuine, said:
That God the Creatour of all the
world, was not easie to be found: nor
that a man could well speake of him,
but with great difficultie.
               7 Xenophon the Oratour enioyned
men, that in their prosperity they
should principally haue God in remembrance.
               8 Plato said: That a good man
was like vnto God: also that a good
man was of all worldly things the
worthiest: and that contrariwise, the
wicked man was of all things the
worst.
               9 Apollonius of Thianea a sage
and wise Philosopher, said: That it
was a good thing to sacrifice to the
Gods, without whom we are nothing
               10 The Poet Sophocles hath written:
That the Gods onely haue this
power and priuiledge, not to waxe
old: and that all other things are surmounted
and ouergone with time.
               11 Plato writeth: That in all
things which are thought and spoken,
the beginning ought alwaies
to be taken from the foueraigne

deuine powers.
               12 Plato said likewise: That the
knowledge of God is wisedome and
true vertue.
               13 Diodorus the Historiographer
hath written: That in much & great
prosperitie God is forgotten and cō
                  temned.
               14 Lactantius hath written: that
God is not knowne of vs but in aduersity
and time of calamitie.
               15 Silius Italicus a Poet hath
written: That as long as the affaires
of mortall men are in any doubtfull
kind of state, or in great feare and
daunger: so long they are verie forward
in doing honour to the Gods:
but in time of their prosperitie, their
al
                     •
                  ars do neuer smoke.
               16 The Poet Virgil writeth: that
it is not lawfull for any man to be
confident, or to trust in any thing against
the will of the Gods.
               17 Salomon saith: Feare God, &
keepe his commaundements: for
this is all in all to each man: and
whatsoeuer is besides this is nothing.
               18 Eusebius said: that the heauens

the earth, the time, the sea, the Planets,
and all other things whatsoeuer
do come to their perfection only by
the word and will of God.
               19 Antistenes the Philosopher
said: That God is not like to any
thing: and that therefore it is impossible
to know him.
               20 Xenophanes the Philosopher
said: That there was one onely God;
who neither in body, nor in thought
was like vnto men.
            
            
               Of Loue.
               CHAP. 2.
               
                  PLinie said▪ That there is nothing
in loue worthie of commendation,
but onely constancie.
               2 Quintilian hath written: That
it is a thing vsuall and accustomed to
louers, not to iudge of beautie and
fauor rightly: because that loue doth
dim & darken the sight of the eyes.
               3 If he which is in loue be poore,
he is tormented with a most miserable
calamitie.
               4 It is a thing vnprofitable to desire

the sight of that shape and figure, by
the which a man hath bene once taken
captiu: and it is ill done for any
man to expose himselfe to the experience
of those things, frō the which
he may refraine and absent himselfe
without any great difficultie.
               5 It is better to loue with seuerity,
then to deceiue with affabilitie.
               6 The custom of louers is so to do,
as they cannot couer their loue.
               7 The amorous person that loueth
the body more then the soule, is
commonly euill: because he is not
constant and stable: and because the
thing which he pursueth with his affections
is vnstable.
               8 He that maketh resistance to
the first assaults of loue, remaineth a
conquerour.
               9 Loue delighteth to dwell and
inhabite in persons of high and noble
houses.
               10 He that nourisheth and entertaineth
loue, shal hardly free himselfe
from the yoke which he hath
once taken vpon his necke.
               11 Louers aboue all other persons,

haue a custome to number the
daies, and to keepe an accompt of
the times.
               12 The amorous after they haue
once had a fill of their luxurious desires,
do soone repent themselues of
any good thing wherwith they haue
departed.
               13 Loue doth many times put
a bridle vpon harts that are obstinate.
               14 Neuer was there any loue,
that could keepe any measure.
               15 In wine and banquetting
loue burneth most cruelly.
               16 With louers it is a common
vse and custome to begin to speake:
and in the middest of their discourse
suddenly to stoppe and to cut off
their speech.
               17 What thing is there in the
world so great or so high, whereunto
loue will not stirre and animate
the minds of mortall men?
            
            
               Of Faith.
               CHAP. 3:
               1 PLato hath written, that Theognis
of M
                        •
                     gara was wont to say: That

in a towne besieged, a man of faith
and fidelitie was better then all the
gold and siluer of the world.
               2 He which giueth counsel to another:
what thing can there be which
he ought sooner to giue then faith?
               3 Little or no faith is attributed
to those persons that are fallen into
any great distresse or miserie.
               4 It is commonly seene, that true
friends do find little faith in requit all
of their friendship.
               5 Faith is the ground and foundation
of iustice.
               6 The faith of men, sleepe, and
the wind are very deceiptfull.
               7 True faith is the best & chiefest
good thing that is in the interior parts
of a man: for no necessitie will constraine
it to proue deceitfull: no gifts
nor bribes can corrupt it: come fire,
come sword, it knowes not how to
betray a man.
               8 In a great company of leud and
wicked persons, faith is not giuen to
things but with great difficultie.
               9 He that hath once lost his faith,
hath no more to lose.
               
                  
10 Faith is a better guard for a
Prince then the sword, or armed forces.
               11 Faith is seldome seene to haue
any entrance or entertainement in
Princes pallaces.
               12 In no place is faith sure or in
securitie.
               13 The Auncients did sacrifice
vnto faith, hauing their hand couered
with a white cloth: to shew, that their
faith ought to be right and secret.
               14 Philip king of Macedon, the
father of Alexander the great, hauing
made one a Iudge that vsed afterwards
to paint his beard & his haire,
suddenly depriued him of his office,
saying: That he which would counterfeit
his haire, was not to be thoght
a man of that woorth or integritie,
that he should be likely to keepe his
faith in all things.
               15 Metellus Nepos hauing conceiued
great indignation and displeasure
against Ci
                        •
                     ero, told him: That he
had brought more men to their
death by his testimonie and bearing
witnesse against them, then he had

saued from death, by defending and
pleading for them: whereunto he answered:
Truly that argueth that my
faith is much, and more greater then
my eloquence.
            
            
               Of Hope.
               CHAP. 4.
               1 HOpe and feare are the two tormentors
of things to come.
               2 Oftentimes do happen sooner
things vnexpected, then those
which are hoped for.
               3 Hope is the last solace and cō
                  fort
of men that are in miserie and
aduersitie.
               4 When fortune doth abandon
vs and deceiue vs in our first hopes:
the things that are to come, do seem
and appeare vnto vs to be better,
then the present.
               5 Hope is the thing that doth
nourish and feede false loues.
               6 Like as by hope we are all saued:
euen so by hope are we to become
truly and perfectly happie.
               
                  
7 We ought to hope for all
things: and to despaire of nothing.
               8 The hopes of those which are
discreet and wise, are not vaine: but
those of vnwise and imprudent men
are light, void, and difficult.
               9 Euill hopes may be compared
to ill captaines, who leade their followers
in errours, yet with pleasures.
               10 A woman without a man, &
good hopes without paines and industry,
can ingender nothing that good
is.
               11 Neither ought a ship to trust
to one anker: nor the life of man
ought to rely vpon one simple hope.
               12 It is good alwaies to be of
good courage: for peraduenture to
morrow will be better and more fortunate
then the time past or present.
               13 Hope is the dreame of those
that vse watching.
               14 Hope is a thing most common
with all men: who when they
haue no other thing remaining, they
do wholly and altogether relye vpon
hope.
               15 Where the hope of a louer

is exceeding great: there is the mind
most desirous of luxuriousnesse.
            
            
               Of adulation and flattery.
               CHAP. 5.
               1 THe world is growne to that corruption:
that he that cannot flatter
is either accompted enuious, or
reputed proud and arrogant.
               2 We haue a custome to please
our selues so much: that we desire to
be praised euen in that, the contrary
whereof we do most commonly put
in practise.
               3 I had rather offend in telling
the truth: then to please by flattering
of any man.
               4 Phocion an Athenian Captaine
being required by Antipater to do a
thing that was vniust, made him this
answer: Thou canst not vse me both
as thy friend and thy flatterer.
               5 Cato the elder suing for the office
of Censorship in Rome, and seeing
that many did curry fauour and
flatter with the people to obtaine it,
with an high & loftie voice, said vnto
them: that the people of Rome had
as much neede of a seuere, speedie,

and sharpe Phisition, as they had of a
strong purgation.
               6 The same Cato said: That those
which were studious of things ridiculous:
afterwards in matters of grauitie
and waightie importance, would
grow so to demeane themselues, as
they would be mocked and derided
of all men.
               7 Where deceiptfull flatterie &
adulation is: there can neuer be any
true friendship nor amitie.
               8 They which haue gotten and
make it a custome to flatter continually,
are of no faith nor honestie.
               9 Adulation is deadly, pestiferous,
and deceiptfull.
               10 If necessitie should enforce a
man to take his choise, he were better
fall amongst crowes then among
flatterers.
               11 Crates the Philosopher seeing
a rich and wealthie young man accompanied
with many flatterers, said
vnto him: O my youth, I am very sorie
to see thee so solitarie.
               12 Shunne as a thing most abhominable,
both the beneuolence of

flatterers, and the misfortunes of thy
friends.
               13 Remoue farre away from
thee the audacious and bold speeches
of flattering persons.
               14 The wolues do resemble
dogs: so do flatterers seeme friends:
but notwithstanding they desire
things different.
               15 Like as Actcon was torne in
peeces by the dogges which himself
had nourished: so are many destroied
by flatterers that haue familiaritie
with them.
               16 The hunters take Hares by
hunting them with dogges: and many
others do take foolish men with
their false praises.
               17 The flatterers are contemners
of the poore: and liue by soothing
vp and pleasing the minds of
the rich: they laugh at men secretly
& amongst themselues, though they
haue no occasion: they are free by
fortune, and yet they make themselues
villaines and slaues by their
owne election.
            
            
               
               Of Ambition.
               CHAP. 6.
               1 AMbition and fauour do then
most signorize, when they hide
& conceale themselues vnder a kind
of seueritie.
               2 Ambition is easily maintained
by old age.
               3 It is most certaine, that he
which is couetous of glorie, and desireth
to be praised of the wicked,
must of necessitie himselfe be wicked.
               4 It is not fit for men to becom
couetous of glorie, in troubling thē
                  selues,
and bearing enuie one towards
another.
               5 Ambition teacheth men to
become disloyall.
               6 After ambition hath once gotten
possession of the honours which
it desireth, she beginneth to waxe
old.
               7 Ambition is the bestiall nurse
of a
                     •
                  arice.
               
                  
8 The glorie that is ambitious,
doth many times worke the ruine euen
of brethren.
               9 The man that desireth superioritie
& power, doth hardly obserue
iustice: and he which is couetous and
greedie of glorie, doth most easily
fall into vniust actions.
            
            
               Of Enuie.
               CHAP. 7.
               1 NO man doth lightly enuy him
who vseth his fortune modestly
and gently: the enui
                     •
                  us do not
beare enuie so much to the persons
of those whom they enuie, as they do
to the good things which are in
them.
               2 Wicked men do not so much

                     •
                  eioyce at their owne proper good
fortunes: as they do at dammage &
discommodities of other men.
               3 
                     •
                  nuie is punished, not onely
with her owne proper euils: but also
by the good and welfare of straungers.
               
                  
4 The common vse of the enuious,
is to desire that there come no
good vnto any.
               5 Enuie is engendred of the superfluitie
of goods.
               6 A great blot and staine of this
age wherein we liue, is that vertue is
neuer without enuie.
               7 Bion the Philosopher seeing an
enuious man carry his head & countenance
hanging downe towards the
ground, said: Either some great mischiefe
is befalne to this man, or som
great good to another.
               8 No felicitie is so modest as it
can avoid the biting tooth of malignitie.
               9 It is a very troublesome and
vneasie matter to eschue and avoide
the eye of the enuious.
               10 This ought euer to be had
by vs in remembrance, that after
glorie euer ensueth enuie.
               11 Assuredly this vice of enuie
is very common in any great & free
citie: and enuie doth alwaies accompany
glorie.
               12 Euen as rust eateth out the

iron: so doth enuie consume the enuious.
               13 That enuie which is secret &
hidden, is more to be feared, then
that which is open and manifest.
               14 Enuie will neuer yeeld to
giue renowne vnto them which are
liuing.
               15 When the affaires of another
are most ioyous, then is enuie most
sad and sorrowfull.
               16 Enuie is the mistresse of iniustice:
and it inciteth both the
thought and the hand to ill and wicked
actions.
               17 Whosoeuer beareth enuie to
any good man and doing well, he
may well say: That he is enuious
both to the whole commonwealth,
and to himselfe also.
               18 Scipio the African for feare
of the enuious, very aduisedly forsooke
Rome, and went to dwell in a
certaine village, there to spend the
rest of his life, and to giue libertie to
the enuious to breath their fill.
            
            
               
               Of couetousnesse, and couetous
persons.
               CHAP. 8.
               1 AVarice and couetousnesse do
vse to diminish and violate all
offices, be they of neuer so great holinesse
or solemnitie.
               2 Auarice doth make both faith
and bountie to decay.
               3 Auarice and couetousnesse is
not the vice of gold, but of man that
vseth gold ill and wickedly.
               4 The daies of that man must
needes be long, that hateth and abhorreth
couetousnesse.
               5 Many things are lacking to
pouertie: but to auarice all things
are wanting.
               6 There be two things that do
soone incite and prouoke a man to
villanous and base gaine: that is to
say, pouertie and couetousnesse.
               7 If there be any that possesseth

many goods, and yet leadeth his life
in anguish and trouble: certaine it is
that he will be the most vnhappie of
all men that euer were liuing or shall
bee.
               8 Couetous persons do leade
such a life as Flies, who are euer trauelling,
and busying themselues,
as though they should liue for
euer.
               9 I see many rich men that are
hoorders and keepers of riches:
but they are not maisters of their
money.
               10 We were borne once: and
it is not graunted vnto vs to be borne
twice: and as thou art not maister of
the day to morrow, so prolong not
the time, and liue as thou shouldest
but liue to day.
               11 O then cursed hunger of
gold, what peruerse, infortunate, and
vnhappie mischiefes, doest thou
bring into the mindes of mortall
men?
               12 The studie of the couetous
person is onely to gather and gaine

monie: which no wise man ought to
desire.
               13 Out of the depth and bowels
of the earth, hath God shewed gold
vnto men▪ and they haue made it the
occasion of all mischiefes and wickednesse
               14 I may well say, that some mē
are so couetous, as if they were to
liue here for euer: and other some are
so prodigall, as if they were to dye
instantly.
               15 Man passeth away his daies
with vaine cares, because he knoweth
not, nor considereth what is the
true end of hauing.
               16 Wicked men are as couetous
of a little gaine as of a great.
               17 Money to many men is more
deare then either faith or honestie.
            
            
               Of Prodigalitie.
               CHAP. 9.
               1 SOme excusing the vice of prodigalitie,
said: That in great aboundance
of wealth and riches it

may well be vsed to whom Zeno the
Philosopher answering, said: Truely
then ought we aswell to pardon our
Cookes, if (for hauing store and abundance
of salt) they say that they
haue therefore made our meates too
salt.
               2 Diogenes the Philosopher demaunding
of one that was a prodigal
spender, a peece of money which
might be perhaps about some 150.
pence, he said vnto him: Wherefore
doest thou aske of me so great a
summe, whereas of others thou dost
commonly begge but three small
pence: to whome Diog
                        •
                     nes answered:
Because I hope that of others I may
aske again another time: but of thee
I thinke neuer to haue more.
               3 Socrates the Philosopher seeing
one without all reason, feasting all
sorts of persons with the welth which
he had: Ill maist thou perish (quoth
he) who makest thy graces which
should be virgins to be strumpets:
noting that true bountie and liberality
ought to be employed vpon occasion
of merit and vertue, and not

confusedly.
               4 Crates the Philosopher was
wont to say: That the monies of rich
prodigall men were like vnto figgetrees
planted vpon the tops of high
rockes and mountaines: the fruites
whereof no men could come to gather,
but the crowes and kites onely
did take and deuour them. So the
treasures of prodigall rich men were
possessed and enioyed only by bauds,
harlots and flatterers.
               5 Pouertie is the torment of a
luxurious life.
               6 Prodigall persons do employ
their money in things, by which
they can leaue, either a very short or
no memorie at all of themselues to
posterities.
               7 No man ought to maruell at
those, who do spend their goods to
make themselues more pleasing and
agreable to the multitude and common
people.
               8 The Emperour Nero had no
other fruite of his riches and treasures,
but onely an excessiue charge
of expences made by exceeding

prodigalitie.
               9 Many do cast away their
goods and patrimonie, in giuing it
without either iudgement or reason:
but what greater follie can there be,
then to studie and willingly to take
care for the doing of that which thou
canst not long endure and continue
to do?

               1 PHiloxenus a man of great knowledge,
being imprisoned by Denis
the tyrant of Syracusa, for that he
had dispraised or not commended
certaine verses which he had made:
was on a time taken out of prison,
and brought before the tyrant once
againe to heare and giue his iudgement
of the same verses: being come
and hauing heard them pronounced
and read, he made hast to be gone
away out of his presence: The

tyrant asking him whither he went:
Philoxenus answered: I go againe to
thy prison: noting that his verses were
then as worthie to be misliked as before.
               2 Diogenes was wont to say: that
some dogges did barke against their
enemies with purpose to bite them:
but I (said he) do barke at my friends
to the intent to purge and heale thē
of their ill deedes.
               3 Hippocrates the Philosopher
being perswaded by one to go seeke
out Xerxes the king of Persia, because
he was a good king: he answered: I
haue not any thing to do with so
good a patron
               4 Thales the Philosopher being
demaunded, how farre different lying
was from truth, answered: As farre as
the eyes are distant from the eares.
               5 Theophrastus the Oratour being
growne old and gray headed, and
comming to Lacedemon, thought to
shew himselfe as if he had bene but
young: for he delighted to hide the
whitenesse of his haires with a certain
dye or painting: and being there before

the Iudges pleading a certaine
cause wherein he was retained: one
Archidamus a man very free and liberall
of his speech, happened (notwithstanding
he was so disguised) to
know him: who suddenly burst out
into these words: But I pray what
truth can you expect in this mans
speech, who both within and without
him doth carry nothing but lyes and
counterfeitings: and that not onely
in his mind, but euen in his gray and
aged head?
               6 There cannot happen any
greater mishap or infelicitie to free
men, then to be depriued of their libertie
of speech.
               7 Diogenes being blamed by a
Greeke, who told him: that albeit he
praised and commended the Lacedemonians
more then any other people,
yet he would not liue with them nor
neare them: he answered him: That
the Phisition which is studious of
health, had no reason to dwell amongst
those which were healthfull.
               8 Zenon hauing a purpose to
giue an admonition to a certaine

young man whom he saw more desirous
to be talking then to heare others,
said vnto him: O thou young
man, I would wish thee to know, that
nature hath giuen thee two ea
                     •
                  es, to
the intent thou shouldst heare more
then thou shouldest speake.
               9 Antistenes the Philosopher hauing
made a certaine long and tedious
speech in the audience of certain
persons, Plato said vnto him: Thou
knowest not Antistenes, that the measure
of mans speech ought not to be
made by him that speaketh, but by
them that giue him the hearing.
               10 Careon a man reputed a great
babler, came to Isocrates, and would
needes be his auditour to learne eloquence:
who demanded of him double
wages. Careon suddenly asked
him, what made him to demaund
double stipend? Isocrates answered: I
aske one, because I must learne thee
to speake: and I will haue the other,
because thou must learn also to hold
thy peace.
               11 Anaximenes being about to
make a certaine speech to an auditorie:

                  Theocritus said out all aloude:
See how he is readie to powre out a
floud of words, whereas he hath not
one drop of reason.
               12 Lying is a thing most readie
and prompt with those, who haue accustomed
often to do euill.
               13 Lying and falshood is not
befitting nor seemely to good and
vertuous persons.
               14 Foolish men do accompt
this a goodly treasure and an ornament
to their toungs, that they hold
themselues to haue made a faire purchase,
when they haue spoken ill of
good and honest men.
               15 There is no one thing in vs,
wherein we are able to offend with
more facilitie, then the toung.
               16 Speech is the image of the
mind: therefore the temperance of
the toung and silence ought to be
great: and men ought to vse and
employ their eares oftener then their
toungs.
               17 It is not good to be too
prompt & forward in speaking: because
many words & much speech is

apparant signe of folly.
               18 Some men in their speeches
are so tedious, vnprofitable, and importunate,
that all whatsoeuer they
speake seemeth to come from the
mouth onely, and not from the hart.
               19 Cicero desired to heare one
speake wisely without eloquence: rather
then a long eloquent oration
stuffed with nothing but vanitie and
follie.
               20 The toung ought to be alwaies
kept short, & especially in the
time of repast.
               21 We ought not much to trouble
our selues, nor care for the tongs
of men: but we ought to haue a care
of our owne conscience.
               22 Doest thou not know it to
be most true: that both God and men
haue lying in hatred and detestation?
               23 Lying and falshood commeth
from persons of a seruile and
slauish nature: and truth proceedeth
from free men.
               24 It is most certaine, that it is
a much more pleasant thing to speak
and vtter matters of truth, then to

giue the hearing vnto them.
               25 Abundance of words and ignorance,
do for the most part beare
sway amongst men.
            
            
               Of Silence, and of speech spoken
in time conuenient.
               CHAP. 11.
               1 XEnocrates hauing an vse to dispose
of all his deedes and actions
by the seuerall houres of the day:
did euer vse to employ one houre in
silence.
               2 I neuer repented me to haue
held my toung, but I haue oftentimes
bene sorie that I haue spoken.
               3 Do you thinke (ò you Athenians)
that I do not well vnderstand,
how silence is a sure thing!
               4 My sonne, it is a good and necessarie
thing for thee to be silent, &
to vse few words: for silence containeth
in it many good things.
               5 Silence is a gift without daunger
and perill.
               
                  
6 A question was demaunded
by one on a time, why & vpon what
occasion the Lacedemonians did vse
so great breuitie in their language:
whereunto Licurgus made this answer:
that breuitie of speech is next
vnto silence.
               7 We ought to haue great regard,
that we speake not things not
fit and conuenient: because that it is
the office and dutie of a man of smal
wisedome to speake and vtter those
things which ought to be kept secret.
               8 A man ought to chuse rather
foolishly to rowle and tosse a stone
vp and downe in vaine, then to
speake any one idle and vaine word.
               9 Solon being set at table with
Periander the tyrant of Corinth, and
not vsing any speech, was demaunded
of the tyrant, if his silence proceeded
either through default of
knowledge how to speake, or else of
follie. Whereunto Solon gaue him
this present answer: That he is no
foole that can be silent in a banquet.
               10 Solon the Philosopher did admonish
men to seale & shut vp their

words vnder silence: and that silence
ought to be vsed and obserued according
to the fitnes of the time & seasō.
               11 Isocrates said: that there were
two speciall times wherin it was lawfull
for any man to speake without
reprehension: the one, when we speak
of things which we know certainely
and manifestly: the other, when we
speake of things needfull and necessarie.
In these two times onely speech
is better then silence: but at other
times silence is to be preferred before
speech.
               12 It is a rare vertue to know how
and when to be silent.
               13 It is a most miserable thing
when a man is constrained perforce
to keepe secret those things which he
would gladly and willingly vtter and
make knowne.
            
            
               Of Folly and imprudence.
               CHAP. 12.
               1 IF any man do contrarie to that
good which is naturally in

him: he ought to be called and accounted
imprudent, foolish and vnhappie.
               2 I say, that they which vse their
bodies to exercise, and despise the
mind, do no other thing but as it
were carelesly neglect the things
which are commaunded, and trauell
themselues about doing of things
not commaunded.
               3 I see that men do with great
care seeke for the things which appertaine
to this life: but they do not
esteeme and set by such as are profitable
to liue well and happily
               4 Proteus (as the common saying
is) did vse often to change himselfe
into many formes and shapes:
so the ignorant man in euery thing
doth chaunge and alter.
               5 Theocritus seeing one that was
a schoolemaister, to teach some erroniously
in the nature of the Elemēts:
he said vnto him: Wherefore doest
thou not teach Geometrie? He answered
him: I am not skilled in it. O
good God (quoth Theocritus) how
great is thy follie, that takest vpon

thee to teach, and canst hardly reade!
               6 Glorie and riches without prudence,
are possessions of no great
assurance.
               7 Bion being demaunded what
thing was folly, answered: That it is
the hinderance of felicitie.
               8 They ought to be reputed &
esteemed for little lesse then fooles,
who honour wicked men being rich,
and despise such as are learned and
men of vertue.
               9 As the luxurious and intemperate
persons, cannot be easily healed
of their diseases: so cannot fooles
receiue any medecine against their
aduersities.
               10 Dascius said: That they which
despise the studie of good letters, for
the exercise and gaine of any mechanicall
art or trade: are like vnto Penelopes
wooers, who being reiected by
the mistresse, fell to lasciuiousnesse
with her maides.
               11 Know you that there are two
kinds of follie: the one is called frenzie
and furie: the other is truely named
ignorance & grosse simplicitie.
               
                  
12 Straungers and pilgrimes do
often go astray out of their way: so
the ill instructed, and men of grosse
vnderstanding do go wandering in
the way be it neuer so plaine.
               13 Euen as corrupt wine is not
desired in banquets: so the rude and
ignorant person is not receiued in any
good company.

               1 KIng Philip the father of Alexander
the Great, hauing vanquished
the Athenians at Choe
                        •
                     onca: albeit
he knew himselfe to be proud enough,
by reason of this great victorie
which he had gotten: yet following
reason, he committed no insolencie
against the people whom he
had conquered: but considering well
with himselfe what was the force of
felicitie, and how difficult a thing it

is for a man to temper and moderate
himselfe in so glorious a victory,
he aduised himselfe that it was needfull,
and accordingly he tooke order,
that one of the Pages of his chamber
for his aduerticement, should euery
morning rehearse vnto him this sentence:
and say: O Philip, remember
that thou art a man.
               2 Heraclitus the Philosopher euen
in his younger yeares was held for
a very sage and wise man: onely for
that he confessed of himselfe, that he
knew, he knew nothing.
               3 Demon the Philosopher being
demaunded, when, and at what time
he first began to be a Philosopher,
he answered: When I began first to
know my selfe.
               4 One demaunded of Theocritus,
for what occasion he made no
workes? he answered: Because I cannot
make such as I would: therefore
such as I can, and am able to do, I
will not.
               5 It is affirmed by many, that
this sentence: Know thy selfe: was
the Prouerbe of the Philosopher

                  Chilo: which thing he said was verie
difficult.
               6 Socrates knowing that Alcibiades
a goodly faire young man did
grow proud, by reason of the great
riches and liuings which he possessed:
he led him into a secret place of the
citie, where he shewed him a table,
wherein was painted a Mappe of the
world: and willed him to see if he
could there find the region of Athens
their natiue countrey. And when Alcibiades
had shewed it him: Socrates
then said vnto him: See now if thou
canst find there the place where thy
lands and possessions do lye. Alcibiades
said: I cannot see that they are here
painted at all. Whereupon Socrates
presently replyed: what reason then
hast thou to grow proud, by reason
of those lands which do not appeare
in any part of the whole earth?
               7 Seeing thou art borne a mortall
man, thou oughtest to haue remembrance
of the commō fortune:
and if thou hadst bene borne a king,
yet thou oughtest to vnderstand, that
thou art mortall.
               
                  
8 Things that are vaine and emptie,
are easily blowne vp with the
wind: and fooles are soone puffed vp
with pride.
               9 They that can talke well and
according to reason, and cannot thē
                  selues
hearken vnto it: may be resembled
vnto harpes, which yeeld a most
pleasant sound and harmonie vnto others,
but perceiue no part thereof
themselues.
               10 Many men are defenders of
their owne faults, and sharpe accusers
of the offences of other men.
               11 Whensoeuer we are disposed
to mocke another: let vs first looke
into our selues, and consider if we
be inclined to the same vices: for
our selfeloue doth hide many offences
in vs.
            
            
               Of friendship and
friends.
               CHAP. 14.
               1 OF all other things that wisdom
hath inuented for men to liue

well and happily: there is none greater,
nor more goodly or pleasant
then friendship.
               2 He is to be reputed iust, which
maketh no reckening of his owne
losse and hinderance, to the intent he
may keepe his friend.
               3 That friendship that hath an
end, was neuer to be accompted true
friendship.
               4 No man is friend vnto a tyrant,
but either for hope or for
feare.
               5 Friendship betweene men of
equalitie is commonly stable: and
amongst such there is neuer experience
made of their forces.
               6 One friend ought not to be
intreated by another, when they demaund
any thing each of other.
               7 This is true friendship, when
both will one and the same thing: and
both do not will one and the same
thing.
               8 Friends are esteemed to be
the onely refuge in pouertie, and in
all other calamities.
               9 Perfect amitie is betweene

good men: and such as are like in vertue.
               10 Friendship is an honest vnion
of a perpetuall good will.
               11 Friendship is a kind of equalitie
and semblance of persons: and
the fruite of friends, is to loue.
               12 A new friend is not to be iudged
or tried in time of feasting or
banquetting.
               13 He committeth a great ouersight,
that thinketh to recommend
himselfe vnto his friends.
               14 A friend ought to be embraced
euen to the death.
               15 It is a shame for any man to
abandon, and not to aide and succor
his friend.
               16 Euery man knoweth, that he
cannot be held a friend to honest and
good-men, who liueth so foolishly,
as to make himselfe pleasing and acceptable
vnto wicked men.
               17 It is better to haue a good
friend then great wealth and multitude
of riches.
               18 Friends ought to aide & help
each other with many good deedes

and benefites: to the intent their
friendship may grow more firm and
greater.
            
            
               Of Liberalitie and
Magnificence.
               CHAP. 15.
               1 THis cannot be said perfect liberalitie:
when a man giueth
more vpon occasion of vaine glorie,
then for true compassion and pitie.
               2 Liberalitie ought alwaies to
be forward and hastie: for this is the
proper and true dutie of him that giueth
willingly, to giue promptly and
readily: and whosoeuer releeueth another
in deferring him from day to
day, he cannot be said to giue liberally
and with a good heart.
               3 Artaxerxes king of Persia, was
wont to say: that it was much more
befitting and seemely for the royall
maiestie of a Prince, to giue vnto others,
then to receiue of others.
               4 King Philip the father of Alexander,
                  
hauing conceiued great grief
for the death of Hipparchus, a man of
Nigrepont: and one telling him, that
he died not but in good time and of
full age. Philip answered: truly he died
too too soone: and so much the
more too soone, because he had neuer
receiued of me any kind of
bountie, worthie of my good loue &
affection towards him.
               5 Perillus one of the friends of
Alexander, demaunded of him a certaine
summe of money to marrie a
daughter which he had: to whome
Alexander caused immediatly to be
deliuered aboue fiftie talents, which
was a very great summe. Then said
Perillus vnto him. My Lord, ten talents
will suffice: but Alexander answered:
It is enough for thee to receiue
ten talents: but it is not enough
for me to giue so little.
               6 Alexander the Great, hauing
charged his Chamberlaine to deliuer
to the Philosopher Anaxarcus so
much money as he would demaund
of him: Sir (said the Chamberlaine)
he demaundeth a hundred talents:

whereunto Alexander answered: He
doth well and like an honest man: for
he knoweth that he hath a friend, and
such a friend that can and will gladly
bestow vpon him asmuch gold as he
will desire.
               7 King Ptolome did vse to eate
and drinke very often in the house of
his friends: and he neuer cared for
the possession of any thing more thē
was for the necessitie of life: and he
would commonly say: that it was a
more princely thing to make others
rich then himselfe.
               8 True liberalitie is to giue vnto
their nearest and next friends.
               9 Simon a famous captaine of
the Atheniās, was a man of that bountie
and liberalitie, that hauing many
possessions and gardens in diuerse
places, he neuer set any to watch thē,
to hinder others from taking away
the fruites that grew in them, but suffered
euery man to vse them at his
pleasure.
               10 The Emperour Domitian, refused
many a faire inheritance, which
diuerse rich men had left & bequeathed

vnto him.
               11 I esteeme that the most royall
praise and commendation that can
be giuen to any man, is to do good
vnto others, and to be liberall.
               12 It is a very hard and difficult
matter for a rich man to be liberall:
because the liberall man doth not vse
to be much sparie: but is enclined
plentifully to poure out and to depart
with his riches.
               13 Marke Anthonie the Philosopher
had nothing more in hatred &
detestation then couetousnesse.

               CHAP. 16.
               1 THe same Anthonie being reproched
by a fife-player, that
he was not borne of noble bloud,
made him this answer: I am therefore
the more worthie to be commended,
because the nobilitie of my
lineage beginneth with me.
               2 Beautie or comelines of countenance,

and moderation of mind are
two things that do principally and especially
belong to noble and men
of honest reputation: and those two
qualities haue neede also of force &
strength to be ioyned with them. As
for other delicacies and lasciuities,
they haue a good grace in herbes
and flowers.
               3 Anachar
                        •
                     is the Philosopher being
cast in the teeth as with a matter
of ignominie or infamie: That he
was a Scithian or Tartarian borne,
answered: certainely I do not liue according
to the custome and fashion
of the Tartarians.
               
               4 Socrates being demaunded
what was nobilitie? answered: It is a
temperance both of soule and of
bodie.
               5 As we do not therefore iudge
bread to be good, because the corne
grew in a faire field, vnlesse the same
be leauened and baked with great labour
and trauell: so do we not esteem
any man noble, albeit he be borne
of a noble familie, vnlesse he be noble
by vertue and honest conditions.
               
                  
6 The man that is magnanimous
and of a great spirit, doth continually
carrie himselfe vpright vnder
any burthen be it neuer so puissant:
and nothing doth happen displeasing
vnto him be it neuer so difficult and
hard to be borne: for he knoweth his
owne forces, and with vertue he vanquisheth
fortune.
               7 The nobilitie of anothers
bloud doth not make thee noble, if
thou do not purchase thy nobilitie of
and by thy selfe, and thy owne vertue.
               8 Nobilitie ought not to be
measured and considered according
to bloud, but according to the customes
vsually obserued.
               9 We do not say that any man
is good, in regard of the nobilitie of
his birth: but for the excellencie of
his vertue.
               10 True nobilitie dependeth of
vertue, and all other things are of
fortune.
               11 The noble and couragious
hart hath this propertie, to be alwaies
doing of things honest and vertuous:

and you shall neuer see any man of
an high and great spirit to delight in
small and base things, or in such as
are dishonest.
               12 What auaileth it any man to
be of a noble lineage, and to be polluted
with vices? And what hurteth it
a man to be issued of a poore house,
if he be adorned and beautified with
vertuous qualities?
               13 True nobilitie is to relye vpon
a mans owne proper vertues, and
not vpon those of another.
               14 Magnanimitie and greatnes
of courage, is as a certaine ornament
of all vertues.
               15 That man onely is to be called
and accounted a man of a great
spirit and magnanimitie, who both is
and esteemeth himselfe worthie of
great things: and he which in his actions
doth not carrie himselfe according
to the power and abilitie of his
dignitie, is reputed a simple and a
foolish person.
               16 There be foure sorts of nobilitie
or gentrie: the first is, of those
who are borne of good and honest

parents: the second, is of those whose
parents haue bene Princes and great
personages: the third is of them,
whose auncestors haue bene renowned
and famous: the fourth and most
commendable of all is: when a man
is excellent by his owne proper vertue,
his owne industrie, and haughtinesse
of courage.

               1 IT was said by Licurgus of Lacedemonia:
that victorie was gotten by
riches, and bountie by the perseuerance
of good customes.
               2 Aristippus the Philosopher being
demaunded, what thing in this
life was most worthie of admiration?
answered: that it was man: prouided
alwaies that he were such a one as
were good and modest.
               
                  
3 Scipio the Affrican obseruing
the admonitions of Polibius, during
his whole life, would neuer lightly
depart or leaue any place where he
came, but he would first purchase
himselfe some one or other for his
friend.
               4 Alexander the Great hauing
sent for a present an hundred talents
to Phocion of Athens, was demaunded
by those which carried the siluer: that
seeing there was so great number of
Athenians besides him, why he shold
giue vnto Phocion onely so great a
summe of money? Alexander answered:
because I do not hold nor iudge
any other Athenian so good and iust
a man as Phocion.
               
               5 Themistocles in setting to open
and publike sale a certaine peece of
inheritance, to him that would giue
most, said vnto the Crier: Let it be
cryed, that it hath good neighbours
dwelling round about it.
               6 The Oratour Demosthenes making
an Oration vnto the Senate, and
seeing Phocion comming a farre off,
said: Behold the hatchet, and the

sharpe cutting sword of my speech
commeth here at hand: by which
kind of speech, he meant that the
force of speech hath no such effect
and puissance, as the excellencie of
good and vertuous conditions.
               7 They who do accustome thē
                  selues
to good fashions, their life
commonly is well fashioned and ordered.
               8 It is a most assured signe and
prognostication, that that citie will
quickely runne to ruine, wherein the
good are not knowne nor discerned
from the wicked.
               9 It is requisite that the good be
stirred vp to vertue by praise and rewards,
and the wicked by correction
and punishment: and they that will
not be reformed, ought to be driuen
into exile.
               10 It is a thing very vnfit and
inconuenient for a man to carrie
goodnesse in his mouth, and none at
all in his heart.
               11 As it is a great fault and folly
for a man to recite things that are another
mans, and to vsurpe them for

his owne: so it is a good thing and a
token of humanitie, to make their
names knowne and manifest by whō
a man commeth to learning and
knowledge.
               12 Iulius Caesar was wont to forget
nothing more soone and readily,
then the iniuries which he had receiued.
               13 No man can be good by the
will and pleasure of another, but only
of his owne will and disposition.
               14 Titus Vespasian being crowned
King of Ierusalem by the people,
said: That he was not worthie of so
great honour, because it was not he
that had gotten that victorie, but that
God had fauoured him against the
Iewes.
               15 Octauian Augustus would neuer
recommend his children to the
people: but onely in vsing these
words: vz. If they deserue well.
               16 There be three sorts of humanitie:
the first, when one saluteth
others courteously: the second, when
one aideth those which are in misery,
and which haue lost their goods by

ill fortune: the third: when men do
frankely of their owne freewils make
banquets, and feast their friends and
acquaintance.
               17 A certaine man came to tell
Octauian, that Aemilius Elian spake
very ill of his vncle Iulius Caesar: to
whome Augustus answered: I would
wish that thou make good proofe of
that which thou sayest: for I will
make Aemilius Elian to know, that
I haue a toung left me.
               18 Cecilius Metellus a Senatour,
was a great enemie to Scipio African
as long as he liued: howbeit, when
he vnderstood of the death of Scipio,
he grew very sorrowfull, and commaunded
his sonnes presently to go
and helpe to carrie the corps of so
worthie a personage to the sepulture:
vsing these or the like speeches: I
yeeld infinite thankes to the immortall
Gods for the loue which I haue
to Rome, that it is thus happened:
that Scipio the African was not born
in another nation.
               19 It is in our owne power to be
either good or euill.
               
                  
20 Courtesie and faire behauiour
is a meane to appease wrath.
               21 Humanitie amongst men is
a strong bond, & he which breaketh
it, is a most wicked man and a murtherer.
               22 The office of humanitie is to
relieue men in time of necessitie and
perill.
               23 The soueraigne good of a
man, is life eternall: and the soueraigne
and chiefest ill of man is death
euerlasting.
            
            
               Of Good deedes and
honour.
               CHAP. 18.
               1 IN doing good to good men: it
seemeth, that this is not to giue
but to receiue.
               2 He which receiueth any good
turne, especially of one that is his seruant,
the which he maketh any reckening

of: let him regard not of whō
he receiueth it, but what it is which
he hath receiued.
               3 It behooueth each man to be
forward to do good vnto another: &
to haue a care also that such fauor be
not concealed.
               4 When mortall men become
benefactors, they imitate the gods.
               5 Benefites receiued by importunate
requests, are little or nothing
worth.
               6 It is no benefite to giue a mā
that hath no need nor necessitie.
               7 To giue more honour to a
man then he deserueth, is to make
way to fooles both to perceiue and
to thinke ill.
               8 In my opinion it is an honourable
action, to accuse the wicked, &
to defend the good.
               9 Honour ought to be gotten
by vertue, and not by deceipt: for the
one is the office of wicked and leude
persons, and the other of good and
honest men.
               10 Conon the Athenian being
sent Ambassadour by Pharnabazus, to

the king Artaxerxes, was counselled
by Chiliarchus, that when he should
come vnto his presence, he ought to
encline and prostrate himselfe before
him: to whome Conon answered: It
will not grieue me to do that honor
vnto the king which thou aduisest
me, but I doubt lest I shall dishonour
my countrey in so doing: because the
citie wherein I was borne, is such a
place, as it hath vsed to rule and commaund
ouer all other cities.
               11 It is the part and dutie of a
friend to do good, especially to those
that stand in neede of it: and that before
they require and aske it: because
both to the one and to the other, it
will then be a thing both more honest,
and more pleasing and acceptable.
               12 There is no doubt but that
rare vertue cannot haue too much
honour and reuerence done vnto it.
            
            
               
               Of Exercise and
industrie.
               CHAP. 19.
               1 HE which hath begunne to purchase
himselfe praise and commendation
with glorie, ought to
take great paine and trauell to continue
it: for in truth slouth and negligence
do vse to bring foorth at the
first a kind of pleasure and delight,
but the end therof is grief & sorrow.
               2 Labour and trauell by vse and
custome, commeth to be more easie,
light, and lesse burthensome.
               3 There are many more men
that grow and become good by exercise,
then by nature.
               4 Cuus king of the Persians, did
not loue that glorie for which he had
not first endured labour and trauell:
and he neuer dined nor supped, except
he had first by some vehement
labour euen wearied himselfe.
               5 Pithagoras said: that art without
exercise is nothing: and that exercise
without art likewise is nothing.
               
                  
6 Demosthenes being demanded
by what means he became more excellent
then others in the art of eloquence,
answered: In consuming
more oyle then wine.
               7 Demades the Oratour being
demaunded: who was his schoolemaister,
answered: The Parliament
of Athens: shewing that experience is
more noble and of more worth then
all discipline.
               8 Denis the tyrant hauing entertained
a Cooke out of the countrey
of Laconia: and supping of a certaine
broath which he had prepared for
him, cast away from him the dish
immediatly, and demanded of him
what should make the Laconians to
delight in eating such a kind of pottage
the same being so sharpe and
without any pleasant tast? The Cooke
answered him: Sir, this broath hath
not that kind of tast which the broth
of the Laconians is accustomed to
haue, and that is the matter that you
thinke it so vnsauorie. Denis replyed:
why what tast then haue their broths?
Certes sir, (said the Cooke) before

they euer vse to sit downe to meate,
they vse first to exercise the body.
               9 Continuall exercise surmounteth
the ensignements and instructions
of all schoolemaisters.
               10 No man ought to labour to
make himself eloquent by the good
of another.
               11 Exercise is the most artificiall
and best mistresse of eloquence: &
to learne to speake well.
               12 Exercise in youth is a great
ayde and furtherance to any man.
            
            
               Of Wrath and
anger.
               CHAP. 20.
               1 PLato said vnto a seruant of his:
Thou maiest thanke God, for
that if I had not bene angrie, thou
haddest surely felt the punishment of
thy misdeeds.
               2 The Philosopher Naucrates
did resemble angry men vnto a
lampe, which if the oyle therein be

too much and ouer aboundant, will
yeeld little or no light, or rather putteth
out the flame.
               3 It must be of necessitie, that
all things which angry men do, must
needes be full of blindnesse and necessitie:
because it is no easie matter
for a man troubled with anger, to
haue the true vse of reason: and whatsoeuer
is without reason is without
art. It behooueth vs therefore to take
reason as our guide in al our actions,
and to remoue wrath and anger vtterly
from vs.
               4 Wrath is the enemie of counsell:
and victorie, naturally is proud.
               5 Wrath is commendable, whē
the occasion is iust.
               6 Anger is an euill desire of reuenge.
               7 Darius king of Persia, being
very angry, for that he was vanquished
of the Athenians by fraud, commaunded
one of his seruants, that as
often as he sho
                     •
                  ld see him sit downe
at meales, he should vse these words
vnto him: Sir, remember the Athenians.
               
                  
8 Anger is no infirmitie: nor
yet to be offended: but for a man to
perseuer in his anger, that is an infirmitie.
               9 If a man subiect to wrath
and anger, haue any power of command,
or imperiall authoritie, he will
soone bring al things to destruction:
he will fall to bloudshedding, ouerthrowing
of cities, murthering of
people, and making whole Prouinces
and countries solitarie and desert.
               10 That man that can dispute
or discourse well, ought to speake
without choler.
               11 Certainely they are much to
be blamed, who are not moued with
anger in such things as are requisite,
and when necessitie and occasion requireth
it.
               12 It is a goodly thing for a
man to conquer his anger and wrathfull
passions.
               13 There is nothing that maketh
a more enclining to anger,
then delicate nourishment full of
nicenesse and flatterie: for it is an vsuall
thing with prosperitie to nourish

choler and wrathfulnesse.
               14 It is a more difficult thing
(said Heraclitus) to striue and contend
against luxuriousnesse and lasciuiousnesse,
then against wrath and anger.
            
            
               Of Patience.

                     ••
                  ely iniuried
by one with most vile tearmes, said
vnto him: Thou speakest ill, because
thou hast not yet learned to speake
well.
               3 Aristippus the Philosopher being
abused by a fellow with most opprobrious
speeches, said thus vnto
him: Thou art a maister of ill speaking,
and I of ill hearing.
               
                  
4 Euripides seeing two men reuiling
each other with iniurious
termes, said: He of you which abstaineth
most from villanous & leud
speeches, is to be held the most sage
and wisest of the two.
               5 That man must needes be reputed
of the greatest and best courage,
who can rather endure and
beare out an vnhappie and miserable
life, then shunne and auoid it.
               6 Archilocus said: That patience
is the inuention of the Gods.
               7 Denis the tyrant being exiled
for his tyrannie, was demaunded,
wherein Plato & his Philosophie had
benefited him. He answered: They
haue taught me quietly and with a
patient spirit, to beare and endure
the chaunge and mutabilitie of fortune.
               8 That body which is accustomed
to patience, will neuer quit or
forsake any place for any paine or
trauell whatsoeuer.
               9 He is to be esteemed patient
and valiant, who is not easily drawne
to be tender and delicate in the time

of his prosperitie.
               10 The Philosopher Chilon, seeing
one that was very pensiue by reason
of some misfortune that had befallen
him, and that in more vnfit &
vnseemely sort then was conuenient,
he said vnto him: Assutedly if thou
knewest the misfortunes of all other
men, thou wouldest not beare thine
owne aduersitie so impatiently.
               11 Pittacus the Philosopher said:
That the office of a wise man was to
take to himselfe good aduice and
counsell, to the end no euill might
befall and happen vnto him: and if
it did afterwards happē that any misfortune
did betide him, then to beare
it couragiously and patiently.
               12 Socrates being in a disputatiō,
and hauing in the middest of his discourse
heard tidings of the death of
his sonne, was not any thing at all
therewith moued: but after that his
disputation was ended, he then said
vnto those which were with him:
Come on, let vs now go and accompanie
the corps of my sonne Sophronison
to his funerals.
               
                  
13 Democritus said: That it was
a notable good thing, to know how
to prouide a remedie for calamitie.
               14 Xantippe the wife of Socrates
was wont to say: That albeit many
chaunges and variable chaunces did
daily trouble and perplexe the whole
citie of Athens: yet she neuer saw the
countenance of her husband Socrates
for any matter euer changed or troubled:
but that he continued still one
and the selfe same man in all fortunes.
And indeede Socrates did so
frame his mind, that he alwaies bore
his visage in one sort, as well in aduersitie
as prosperitie.
               15 As Xenophon was sacrificing
in the citie of Mantinea. there came
a missenger to bring him tidings how
his sonne Grillus was dead: vpon the
receipt of which newes, he presently
tooke the crowne from off his head
without further interrupting of the
sacrisice. But the messenger hauing
added this vnto his tale, that his sonne
died victoriously, he tooke vp the
crown & set it againe vpon his head,
& so went on with the finishing of his
sacrifice.
            
            
               
               Of the praise of riches.
               CHAP. 22.
               1 THe Poet Simonides being demaunded,
which of these two
things he had rather choose, either
riches or wisedome: answered. I cannot
tell whether: but certaine it is,
that I see wise men euer attending about
the gates of rich men.
               2 It is a thing most requisite &
necessarie for a man to haue money:
without which it is impossible to do
or effect any thing with oportunitie,
or in time conuenient.
               3 Money amongst mortall men
is as the bloud and the soule of a mā:
and he which hath it not, is as one
that walketh dead amongst the liuing.
               4 Onely gold and riches establisheth
customes and manners: maketh
and giueth beautie, nobilitie,
friendship, and all other things whatsoeuer.
               5 Ha father, speake not to me

of gentrie or nobilitie, for it relyeth
altogether vpon wealth and riches:
giue me my house stored with gold:
and if I were left a slane, I shall then
soone become and be reputed noble.
               6 Mony is it that findeth friends,
and bringeth men into fauour and
dignitie neare about Princes.
               7 Riches are the sure friends:
but they which are commonly reputed
for friends, do soone forsake him
which is poore.
               8 Great riches are to be bestowed
vpon friends.
               9 I see it is an ordinarie humor
in women, to take pleasure in riches
and iewels.
               10 Apollonius of Thianea said vnto
Denis the tyrant: Thou shalt be
sure to employ thy riches very well,
and in better sort then all other kings
vse to do, if thou bestow them vpon
the poore and needie.
               11 Riches do hurt exceedingly,
except the possessor of them vse
them well and rightly.
            
            
               
               Riches dispraised & cōdēned.
               CHAP. 23.
               1 THe common Prouerhe is: that
a man shold not put a knife into
a childs hand: and I say, that thou
shouldst neither giue him knife nor
yet riches.
               2 Esteeme not of those men,
whose hearts are wholly set vpon the
riches which they possesse: because
not knowing how to vse them, they
are to be held like vnto those men
that haue a faire and goodly horse,
but know not how to ride nor manage
him.
               3 Riches are most commonly
made the ministers and instruments
of vices rather then of vertues: and
they entice and allure young persons
to foolish voluptuousnesse.
               4 The Poet Anacreon hauing had
fiue talents bestowed vpon him by
the tyrant Policrates: & for two nights
after hauing bene very sad & pēsiue,
& not able to sleepe or take his rest,
caried him back again his fiue talēts,
saying vnto him: this mony is not to

be valued or prized at so high a rate:
as that for the same, I should suffer
my selfe to be disquieted with continuall
care and pensiuenesse.
               5 It is a very hard thing naturally
for a man to refraine and bridle his
appetites but if it happen to be accompanied
with aboundance of
wealth and riches, then is the appetite
vtterly vntameable.
               6 Bion the Philosopher said; that
it was a thing meerely ridiculous, for
a man to set his studie and desire vpō
riches which are giuen and gotten
onely by fortune, by miserable sparing
and pinching, and by wretched
couetousnesse: and are soone spent &
dispersed by bountie.
               7 Diogenes was wont to say: that
it was almost impossible for vertue
to inhabite or dwell in that citie or
house where riches were abounding.
               8 Pithagoras said: that men cannot
easily reine nor hold in an horse without
a bridle: nor rule riches without
great prudence.

                        •
                     o being demaunded what
things a man most needed in this

life, answered: First, to be free frō trecherie:
that he come not to be murthered
by treason: and next, that he
be not in too great needinesse and
necessitie of things necessarie.
               10 Riches do commonly seduce
and draw a man out of the right
way.
               11 He that putteth his trust in
his riches, is in the high way to ruine
and destruction.
               12 As riches are but impediments
to those that are wicked: so to
good men they giue an aide and assistance
to their vertues.
               13 It is most certaine, that it is
impossible for any man to be excellent
both in riches and in goodnesse.
               14 Rich men are called monyed
men: but if they be couetous, they
are poore in their thoughts: and so
likewise the poore are named needy
persons and indigent: but inwardly
they are rich, (if they be contented.)
               15 The Cinicke Philosophers
did altogether despise vaine glorie,
nobilitie and riches.
               16 Riches are the possessions of

fortune.
               17 The life of rich men is very
miserable.
               18 Excesse and ouer great abundance
of riches, are as the rudders of
great shippes put to small barkes,
which cannot well stirre and guide
them.
               19 Riches are the occasions of
all kinds of mischiefes.
               20 Amongst many men, they
who do abound in wealth and riches,
are held and reckened for honest and
good men.

suffer any of their daughters to be
maried, except she haue first staine
with her owne hand, one of their enemies.
               
                  
2 The Licians do honour their
women more then their men: and
they take their surnames of the mother
and not of the father: and they
leaue their daughters to be their heirs
and the inheritours of their lands and
not their sonnes.
               3 The kings of Persia before
they do sacrifice to their gods, do vse
to dispute of religion: before they
drinke, they argue of temperance: &
before they go to the warres, they
dispute of their strength and forces.
               4 The Atlanticke peoples of Libia,
amongst all their daughters do
esteeme of her best, that keepeth her
virginitie longest.
               5 The Autyles a people of Lybia
in times of warre do vse to fight by
night, and in the day they do make
truce and an abstinence from warres.
               6 The Mirines a people of Licia
in the act of generation do vse their
women in common: their children
for fiue yeares are nourished in common,
and after in the sixth yeare they
put all their children of that age together:
and then they compare the

children with the men; and that man
to whom any child is most like in resemblance,
hath that giuen vnto him
to bring vp as his owne.
               7 The lawes commaund: That
men accustomed to wickednesse and
viciousnesse should be cut off, without
being spared or concealed: and
that they which are attainted & conuinced
as guilty of any crime, should
neuer be let go without punishment.
               8 Those lawes which grow and
arise of customes, are much stronger
then those that are made by learning
and ciuill prudence.
               9 As man is the best of all creatures
vsing lawes and iustice: so is mā
the worst of all creatures when hee
swarueth from law and iustice.
               10 The lawe is the Queene of all
creatures, both mortall & immortall.
               11 To a wise man God is a lawe:
but to a foole his owne appetite.
               12 I see that the ruine of that citie
is at hand, wherein the lawes haue
not the command ouer the magistrate:
but the magistrate ruleth ouer
the lawes.
               13 Pausanias a captain of Athens,
                  
being demaunded by one: wherfore
certaine auncient lawes remaining in
force amongst them, were not abrogated
and discontinued? answered:
It is necessarie that the lawes should
beare rule ouer men, and not men ouer
the lawes.
               14 They which haue too many
lawes, and too many penalties and
punishments, by meere constraint
must become wicked.
               15 The true lawes are those that
bring foorth honest things, and not
abundance of gaine and riches.
               16 The feare of the lawes doth
not hide the wickednesse of offendors:
but defendeth them from licentiousnesse
and libertie of doing ill.
               17 Lawes were ordained, to the
intent the audacious actions of men
might be restrained: and that innocencie
might liue secure and in assurance
amongst the vicious and wicked.
               18 The law is nothing else then
a rule of right or reason, deriued frō
the diuinitie of the Gods: which commaundeth
that which is good and

honest, and defendeth the contrary.
               19 Solon said: That the lawes
were like vnto Spiders webbes: because
commonly by the extremitie
and seueritie of lawes, the poorer and
weaker sort of men are entrapped &
brought to punishment, but the rich
and mightie men do breake through
them vncontrolled.
            
            
               Of Renowne and
glorie.
               CHAP. 25.
               1 REnowne commonly hath more
fame then defame.
               2 A Prince ought to be bred &
brought vp in glorie.
               3 Glorie despised, by time commeth
to be greater.
               4 All sorts of men are drawne in
with the desire and studie of glorie:
and therfore euery good man is guided
by glorie.
               5 Democritus a most excellent
Philosopher, did glorie in that he
came to Athens vnknowne of any

person.
               6 Alexander the Great said: If I
were Parmenio, I had rather haue
wealth then glorie: but now as I am,
I know my selfe to be a king and not
a Merchant.
               7 Many men feare their renowne:
but few or none feare their
conscience.
               8 I haue learned to be afraid of
that renowne which is dishonest and
shamefull.
               9 Of all humane things that are
voluble and subiect to inconstancie:
there is none more vnstable then renowne
and glorie.
               10 Diogenes the Philosopher said:
That nobilitie and glory were a couerture
for malice.
               11 When as Appius Claudius the
Competitour of Scipio African, did
commend himselfe, for that he could
salute all the Romaines by their
names: Scipio said vnto him: my care
hath alwaies bene to be knowne of
all men, rather then to know any
man.
            
            
               
               Of a short life and
sickely.
               CHAP. 26.
               1 ARistotle being demaunded what
man was? answered: he is the
example of sickenesse: the pray of
time: the scorne and play of fortune:
the image of ruine: the ballance of
enuie and calamitie: and for the rest
he is nothing but fleame and choler.
               2 Simonides the Poet being demaunded
how long he had liued: answered:
A very little time, but many
yeares.
               3 The Philosopher Zenon said:
That there is nothing whereof we
are so poore as of time. The life of
man is but short: but art to heale the
maladies and diseases of the bodie, is
longer and much more then man
can attaine vnto.
               4 Socrates said: thae he thought
the gods, in regarding & beholding
our vaine studies and desires, could
not but laugh continually.
               5 All our life is vncertaine & without

coniecture, as that which goeth
on wandring without any faith or cō
                  stancie,
and with vaine hopes in idle
words, it feedeth the thoughts and
cogitations of men. No man knoweth
what will happē in time to come:
howbeit God gouerneth all mortall
men in the middest of all perils and
daungers: and many times on the
contrary, he bloweth vpon vs a strong
wind or tempest of aduersitie.
               6 Albeit this life be full of troubles
and miseries, neuerthelesse it is
greedily desired of all men.
               7 Life is good, if a man liue
vertuously: but it is euill if it be accompanied
with wickednesse.
               8 In the Isle of Taprobana it is
said, that men liue without griefe.
               9 If thou knowest how to vse thy
life well, it will be of long continuance.
               10 Oh how late is that houre,
for a man then to begin to liue well,
when he must of necessitie dye and
depart out of this life!
               11 The life of man is fraile and
short.
               
                  
12 That life is pleasant which is
led in honestie.
               13 A quiet and peaceable life
ought to be preferred before all other
things.
               14 A mans care and studie ought
to be, how he may passe his life time
in ioy and contentment.
               15 Without ioy and loue this
life of ours is bitter and vncomfortable.
               16 The torments of this life are
of diuerse sorts.
               17 A short life cutteth a man off
from long hopes.
               18 Not he which liueth long,
but he that liueth iustly and vertuously,
is worthie to be honoured and
commended, notwithstanding that
he liue but a short and small time.
            
            
               Of Pouertie despised.
               CHAP. 27.
               1 A Man hath no greater enemie
then pouertie: the poore man
is fearefull in euery thing.
               2 Diogenes being reproched by

one because of his pouertie, answered
him, saying: O wretch, thou diddest
neuer see any man exercise tyrannie
for pouertie: but many tyrants
do it to get wealth and riches.
               3 If thou do not desire much and
many things: that little which thou
hast will seeme much vnto thee.
               4 After that pouertie became
once to be held in contempt, and to
be accounted a thing disgracious
amongst men, riches & wealth haue
euer since bene sought of men by all
kind of wickednesse and mischie
                     •
                  es
               5 Pouertie is content to satisfie
the demaund of desire.
               6 There is no man liuing which
is borne rich: but he may well be accounted
great, who in the middest of
his riches doth shew himselfe to be
poore.
               7 Nature desireth and is contē
                  ted
with a very little, but the fancie
and opinion of man coueteth much.
               8 Honest pouertie is a ioyfull
and pleasant thing.
               9 He is not poore that possesseth
small wealth: but he which desireth

reth much.
            
            
               Of Pouertie commended.
               CHAP. 28.
               1 ARistides, Phocion, and Socrates Athenians,
Epaminondas also and
Pelopidas Thebans, all of them most
famous and renowned persons, were
very poore men: and yet they were
better, more honest and iust men thē
any other of the seuerall nations and
countries where they liued.
               2 Diogenes being vpbraided by
one that he was poore, answered: I
neuer saw any man tormented for
his pouertie: but I haue seene many
p
                     •
                  nished for their vices.
               3 To be poore by nature is no
shame vnto a man: but we hate to
see any man made poore by any euill
or vnhappie occasion.
               4 There is one thing onely for
which pouertie ought to be beloued:
because that maketh shew and triall
of whom thou art beloued.
            
            
               
               Of Beautie.
               CHAP. 29.
               1 THere is no man be he neuer so
beautifull and of an excellent
spirit, that can therefore boast or
vaunt of himselfe: for in a very short
time he looseth the flower of all his
pride.
               2 The Philosopher Diogenes did
vse to call those harlots and strumpets
which were faire and beautifull, by
the name and title of queenes: because
men held them in no lesse reuerence
then queenes: and most men
were readie to do whatsoeuer they
commaunded them.
               3 It is a most pleasant and ioyfull
thing to regard and behold beautifull
persons: but to touch and handle
them is very danngerous.
               4 Fire doth burne onely neare
at hand: but beautifull faces, be they
neuer so farre off, do enflame and
burne men.
               5 Beautie being naturall & without

art, is much more pleasing and
delightfull.
               6 Beautie is a very fraile thing:
and is soone diminished by time.
               7 That beautie is passing rare,
which is without any fault or defect.
               8 Beautie ought not to be adiudged
by night.
               9 Beautie vnto many hath bene
the cause of extreame dammage.
               10 Beautie onely hath this good
fortune, that aboue all other things
it is exceeding glorious and amiable.
               11 Aristotle said: That in one recommendation,
beautie had more
force and valure, then all the letters
missiue of the world.

               1 FLye infamie sooner then any

                     monians, seeing his sonne combate
most obstinately against the Athenians,
said vnto him. Either adde
more strengrh to thy forces, or leaue
thy audacitie.
               4 Strength with prudence doth
much profit and helpe any man: but
without it the same is very hurtfull.
               5 In things of great daunger,
hardinesse and audacitie begun with
reason, is highly to be commended:
because it is most certaine that this is
the true fortitude: but fiercenesse
without reason is to be held no other
then meere temeritie.
               6 It seemeth that the audacious
person is arrogant and a dissembler
of his force.
               7 Audacious persons are headlong
before time of perill▪ and when
they are neare daunger, they turne
their backes.
               8 When strength entreth into
actions that are perillous without an
honest occasion, it is called temerity.
               
                  
9 In these daies, it is lawfull to
vse audacitie in stead of wisedome
and prudence.
            
            
               Of Piety and Clemency.
               CHAP. 31.
               1 PIetie in my iudgement is the
foundation of all vertue.
               2 This is true clemencie, when
one pardoneth the life of another as
his owne proper life.
               3 There is nothing more commendable
then clemencie: nor is
there any thing more worthie of a
great and noble man, then to bee
soone appeased.
               4 Lucius Paulus a captaine of the
Romanes, hauing taken Perseus king
of Macedonie, and entertaining this
his prisoner with great humanitie, he
said vnto him: If it be an honour for
a man to suppresse and subdue his enemie,
it is no lesse praise worthie to
haue compassion of him that is falne
into misfortune.
               5 God keepeth the good & vertuous
man from all euill & mishap:

the onely good thing that can be in
man is pietie and religion.
               6 Pietie is the true knowledge
of God.
               7 They which haue written of
pietie, haue giuen the first place vnto
the burying of the dead.
               8 Clemencie is not so fit and
conuenient to any, as to kings and
Princes.
               9 Pietie was neuer yet rewarded
with any punishment.
            
            
               Of Liberty and seruitude.
               CHAP. 32.
               1 WHosoeuer accompanieth
with a tyrant, although he
be in libertie, yet he is his seruant.
               2 Libertie ought not to be lost
without losse of life.
               3 All kind of seruitude is miserable,
but that especially is intollerable,
when a man is enforced to serue
one that is dishonest and vicious.
               4 It is fitter for any man to reioyce
when he hath done any good

seruice, & hath performed the part of
a good seruant: then when he hath
played the part of a great maister and
commaunder.
               5 He serueth honestly, who giueth
place vnto time.
               6 If any man haue found a seruant
that is willing and diligent, he
can neuer haue a better or more precious
treasure.
               7 There cannot be a heauier
charge, then for a man to haue a seruant
which will take vpon him to
know more then appertaineth vnto
him: and there canno
                     •
                   be a worse
thing or more vnprofitable, in any
house, then such a one.
               8 A certaine Spartan said: We
onely of all the Grecians haue learned
to be truely free, and not to be
subiect to any.
               9 Caesar desired to be despised,
and to haue nothing of himselfe, to
the intent his souldiers might be
franke and free.
               10 It is better to liue free with a
little out of feare, then to be in seruitude
with much & great abundance.
            
            
               
               Of Ignorance.
               CHAP. 33.
               1 IT is a signe of great folly for a mā
to blame those things which he
vnderstandeth not.
               2 They may well be reputed for
ignorant persons, who condemne
things they know not, notwithstanding
they deserue to be abhorred.
               3 It is a very vniust and vnseemly
thing, that ignorant persons should
be preferred before those that are
skilfull maisters in any facultie: or
new men before the old and auncient:
or fooles before those that bee
wise and learned.
               4 It is a matter worthie to be
considered
                     •
                   what and how great a
mischiefe ignorance is vnto men: it
being so, that by the same, the faults
which we do are concealed and kept
from vs.
               5 It is better to be a begger thē
to be ignorant.
               6 Ignorance and too much aboundance
of speech are faults that

haue dominion ouer the most part
of men.
               7 Ignorant persons commonly
do liue viciously: the life of which
men is their death.
               8 The Poet Ausonius did make
a mocke and a iest of the ignorant
Philomuso, who vsed to buy many
bookes, because he would be thoght
to be learned.
               9 Catullus said: that many did
vse to buy bookes to their great
charge and expences, although they
knew little or nothing at all.
            
            
               Of Doctrine and a

               CHAP. 34.
               1 IN my iudgement it is not too late
for any of what age soeuer, to
learne that which is necessarie.
               2 Chuse thee such a maister, at
whome thou maist take more occasion
of admiration by seeing, then by
hearing of him.
               
                  
3 Honourable actions and customes
are not so much gotten to
man by nature, as by doctrine and
learning.
               4 Who can endure to see a rich
man placed in the seat of honour and
dignitie? and that one which is more
honest and of greater wisedome,
should be despised and contemned?
               5 In very truth, there is nothing
more deuine, and whereof a man
ought to take counsell sooner then of
his owne learning, and by his friends.
               6 Certainely the spirit of a man
cannot deuise to make any artificiall
workmanship perfect without doctrine:
neither can doctrine come to
perfection, without a good spirit.
               7 Oh how often are the most excellent
spirits concealed in secret, and
remaine vnknowne!
               8 Euen as the health is the preseruation
of the body: so is doctrine
the safegard of the soule.
               9 A good spirit may well be hidden
vnder any skinne whatsoeuer.
               10 Alexander desired to surmount
and excell all others rather in knowledge

and learning, then by numbers
of souldiers and men at armes.
               11 Many men of most excellent
wisedome and knowledge, haue bin
of this mind: that learning and the
studie of good letters was the onely
remedie against all aduersities.
               12 Men who are of a subtill and
craftie spirit, are to be feared and mistrusted.
               13 The spirits and minds of men
generally are intentiue to the getting
and heaping of riches.
               14 Those men who are of an excellent
and extraordinarie spirit, for
the most part are continually blamed.
               15 Learned men do liue euer.
               16 Desire onely to please them
that are learned, and care not for the
vulgar and common sort.
               17 To noble spirits, commonly
short life is incident.
               18 It is seldome seene, that learned
men are ouerpestered with multitude
of affaires.
               19 Propertius said: that there was

               20 Man getteth wisedome and
prudence by a good spirite, and vnderstanding,
and not by age.
               21 Plato Museus, Melampus, Eudoxus,
Licurgus, Solon, Orpheus, Homer, Pithagoras
and Democritus, being all
men of excellent skill and science,
yet went into Egypt to increase their
knowledge and learning.
               22 Socrates admonished all such
as haue a desire to get fame and renowme:
that they neuer come to
haue enmitie or contention with the
learned, because men of learning and
knowledge haue a great power both
on the one part and the other.

and tedious to our eares,
who fal into the praise and commendation
of voluptuous pleasures.
               2 The Ambassadours of the Samnites
being come with great treasure
to the campe of the Romanes, and
purposing to make a present thereof,
vnto Fabritius: he sodainely laid his
hands on his eares, on his eyes, on his
nostrels, on his mouth, on his throat,
and on his bellie, and said vnto them:
As long as I can striue and get the
masterie ouer all these my members
which I haue touched, I will neuer
haue neede of any thing that may be
an ornament vnto me.
               3 Alexander the great hauing taken
the daughters of Darius king of
Persia: and so likewise Scipio the Africane
hauing in his possession the
daughter of his enemie, neither of
them would take the paine to go

and see them, iudging it to be a thing
dishonourable and nothing seemely
for them, who were the conquerors
of their enemies, to be in any sort
subiected vnto those, whome they
had conquered and taken captiues.
               4 The continencie of Alexander
the Great was such, as he wold neuer
be drawne by constraint to see any
woman, but he euer shewed himself
most haughtie towards such as were
fairest and most beautifull: but to all
others he was exceeding full of courtesie
and humanitie.
               5 Amongst domesticall things,
continencie deserueth the chiefest
commendation: and amongst publique
things, dignitie and estimatiō.
               6 Continencie sustaineth and de
                     •
                  fendeth
all the vertues of the mind:
as a most firme foundation and vnderprop
of the rest of the edifices.
               7 He that passeth measure in drinking,
is no more maister of his
thoughts nor of his toung: and without
shame he speaketh of al dishonest
things and such as are vnseemely: and
of a man he becommeth a child.
               
                  
8 The gold-finers make a triall
of the goodnesse of gold and siluer

               9 A shippe, a coach or any other
exercise gouerned by a drunken man
suddenly runneth to ruine and perdition.
               10 It is a thing of exceeding great
difficultie for a man to conceale and
hide his ignorance: but much more
difficult is it for a man to conceale
any thing when he hath drunke well.
               11 Socrates said: that true continencie,
was to shunne and auoid the
pleasures of the bodie.
               12 Pericles a noble captaine of Athens,
when Sophocles the Poet shewed
vnto him a very faire young boy,
said vnto him: O Sophocles, it is very
fit and conuenient for a modest and
temperate captaine, that not onely
his hands, but his eyes also should be
continent.
               13 Hieron the tyrant hauing heard
Epicarmus the comicall Poet vse som
dishonest and lasciuious words in the

presence of his wife condemned
him in a cerraine fine for his punishment.
               14 Philon of Thebes being disposed
to giue certaine things vnto Philip
the father of Alexander, who had
conquered the citie of Thebes: he said
vnto him: I pray thee do not depriue
me of the glorie and honour of my
conquest: for by thy benefite and
curtesie which thou offer
                     •
                  st me, thou
wouldest make me to be not as a
Conquerour, but as one rather ouercome
and conquered.
               15 Cato the elder making an oration
against the prodigalitie and superfluous
expences of the Romanes,
said, that it was no easie matter for a
man to vse speech against the belly
which was without eares: and that he
maruelled how that citie could be
long preserued from destruction,
wherein a fish should be of more value
and cost more then a Beefe.
               16 Antiochus the third king of Syria,
seeing a very faire Nunne in the
citie of Ephesus, consecrated & vowed
to the Goddesse Diana, speedily departed

thēce, for feare lest her beauty
should draw & constraine him to do
that thing which was euil, euē against
the opiniō of his own mind & spirit.
               17 After that Carthage was taken
by Scipio, certaine souldiours presented
him with a verie beautifull maiden:
to whom he answered: If I were
a priuate man and not a Generall, I
would gladly accept of your present.
               18 Pythagorus did esteeme it much
better to die, then for a man to pol

               19 Alexander the great hauing sent
his oratours to Zenocrates with a
present of more then fiftie talents:
he inuited (according to his vsual custome)
the said Ambassadours to his
sparie and sober dinner, and said vnto
them, Tell Alexander from me, that
as long as I haue wherwith to maintaine
this life, I shall not know what
to do with these fiftie talents.
               20 Demonsthenes said, not euerie
pleasure, but that onely which is honest
and vertuous ought to be chosen

he haue not the ordinarie vse of those
things which bring pleasure, yet is he
in want of none of them.
               22 Diogenes being gone to Delphos,
and seeing a statue of gold made
in the name of Phirna a most famous
strumpet, he said: This is for the intemperancie
of the Greekes.
               23 The Philosopher Epictetus
said: That no man ought to adorne &

and pictures, but with continencie
and good customes.
            
            
               Of Prudence.
               CHAP. 36.
               1 THe king Darius the father of
Xerxes said: that he came to be
much more prudent by the experience
of the battels which he had had,
& of his forepassed perils and aduersities.
               2 Paulus Emilius assailing certaine
places in Macedonie, Scipio Nasica
said vnto him: Wherefore doest

thou not rather affront the campe of
thy enemies which is furnished and
fortified against thee? To whome he
answered: Certainely, if I were of thy
age, I would do so as thou aduisest
mee.
               3 Denis the tyrant hauing sent
certaine goodly vestments to the
daughters of Lisander for a present:
he sent the same backe againe vnto
him, saying: that he was greatly afraid
lest his daughters with those habites
should appeare much more deformed
then they were.
               4 Archidamus being praised by
certaine men, who demanded of him
in what time he had subdued the peoples
of Arcadia? he answered: that it
had bene better for him to haue ouercome
them by prudence then by
force.
               5 Prudence hath great need of
fortune to accompany it: but wisedome
onely hath no neede of any
counsell for the acquisition and attainement
of that end whereunto it
tendeth: because it applyeth and keepeth
her selfe continually to things

that are eternall.
               6 Prudence properly is a vertue
belonging and appertaining to a
Prince.
               7 Whosoeuer is prudent must
needes be temperate and constant:
he that is constant is not troubled: he
that is not troubled with any thing,
must of necessitie be without griefe
and sorrow: he therefore that is prudent,
cannot chuse but be happie.
               8 Prudence is compounded of
the knowledge of good and euill
things.
               9 Prudence of all other vertues
is the greatest: for by it all things
both ciuill and domesticall are guided
and gouerned: & the name therof
is temperance and iustice.
               10 They are to be esteemed &
held for prudent and iust men, who
know both how to say and do those
things which are needefull and conuenient
to be obserued towards God
and men.
            
            
               
               Of Force.
               CHAP. 37.
               1 THey are not called nor truely
accounted valiant and couragious
persons, who do and offer iniury:
but they which do repell and keepe
iniurie and violence from them. And
in truth he onely is of a valiant and
constant courage, who is not troubled
with aduersitie.
               2 He ought to be esteemed the
most stout and valiant, who driueth
away from him couetous persons as
his enemies.
               3 He is said and held to be a valiant
man, who endureth and feareth
the things that ought to be feared &
endured, vpon all occasions both
whence, how, and when it is needful:
and he likewise that is confident in
himselfe and in his owne courage.
               4 Fortitude or valiantnesse is
the science and knowledg
                     •
                   of things
which are to be held, and not to be
feared, aswel in daunger of warres as
of all other things.
               5 If force and valure do hazard

it selfe into perils and daungers, not
constrained by necessitie, or vpon any
occasion not honest: it is no longer
to be reputed for valure, but rashnesse
and temeritie.
               6 Scipio the African seeing a soldier
of his to shew his buckler with
bragges and ostentation, said vnto
him: My friend, true it is, thou hast a
faire buckler, but it is a more seemely
and decent thing for a Romane, to
haue his hopes depending rather vpō
his right then his left hand.
               7 Caius Popilius being sent by
the Senate of Rome as Embassadour
to Antiochus king of Syria, to shew
vnto him, that their pleasure was, he
should desist frō molesting the children
and orphanes of the late deceased
Ptolome king of Egypt, was by the
said Antiochus saluted and entertained
with great courtesie: which notwithstanding
he would scarce vouchsafe
to requite with thankes, but deliuering
him his letters, and being answered
vpon the reading of them by the
king, that he would consult with his
Counsell vpon the contents thereof,

                  Popilius hauing a white rod in his
hand, made therewith a round circle
about the king where he stoode, and
said vnto him: Sir, I would wish you
euen here as you stand to aduise your
selfe, and to giue me your present answer.
The Nobles there present with
the king, maruelled at that his exceeding
greatnesse of courage: and Antiochus
himselfe immediatly answered:
that he would do all that the Romanes
required: whereupon Popilius
instantly saluted him with great reuerence,
& embraced him as the friend
of the Romanes.
               8 Agesilaus the Lacedemonian
being demaunded, which of the two
was the better vertue, either fortitude
or iustice, answered: That valure
without iustice was of no fruit nor
profit
               9 Pausanias a captaine of the Lacedemonians
hearing Pedaretus say,
Oh what a multitude of enemies do
come against vs! answered: so many
the more shal we haue the killing of.
               10 Agesilaus being demaunded
by one, why the citie of Sparta was

not enuironed with wals: he shewed
vnto him the citizens armed, & said:
Behold these be the wals of the Lacedemonians.
               
               11 Argeleonida the mother of
Brasidas a renowned captaine of the
Lacedemonians, being giuen to vnderstand
by the Ambassadours of Greece,
that her sonne was slaine in battell,
demaunded of them if he died valiantly:
the Ambassadours answered,
that there was neuer man that died
with more honour and renowne. To
whom she replyed: O my maisters,
for all this do you not know, that
though my sonne Brasidas was a mā
of great woorth, yet hath our citie
of Sparta a great number better and
more worthie then he.
               12 Philip king of Macedonie being
come with great furie into the
territories of the Lacedemonians, one
said vnto him: Oh what a world of
miseries will the Lacedemonians be
enforced to endure, if they do not reconcile
themselues to the good
grace and fauour of king Philip:
Wherunto Daminda answered: Thou

speakest like a woman: what misery
can we suffer, if we be not afraid of
death?
               13 When the Ambassadours of
Pirrhus being come before the Lacedemonians
did menace them, that if
they did not frame themselues to the
good liking & contentation of their
king, they should find that his forces
were greater then theirs. Dercilida
answered: Certainely if your king be
a God, yet we feare him not, because
we neuer did him any iniurie: but if
he be a man, assuredly he is no better
then we are.
            
            
               Of Iustice and iudgement.
               CHAP. 38.
               1 IF thou wilt iudge vprightly, thou
oughtest to haue a regard nor respect
to nothing but to iustice onely.
               2 In India he which is most learned
is made the minister of their sacrifices:
And hee demaundeth

no other thing of the gods, but iustice.
               3 As the touchstone by the
touch approueth the gold, not the
gold the stone: so the iust and vpright
man which sitteth in iudgement, is
not corrupted with gold.
               4 He is not only iust which doth
no iniurie nor wrong, but he also,
who hauing power to do wrong,
doth shunne and auoid the occasions
thereof, to the intent he may not do
any. Againe, he is not iust which receiueth
small gifts: but he is iust, who
hauing power to take great bribes,
doth abstaine from doing it. Besides,
he is not iust that obserueth al things:
but he is iust, who with an vncorrupt
and free nature, will rather be, then
seeme and appeare to be iust.
               5 Those men are chiefly, and in
the first ranke to be praised, who preferre
not any matter of profit, before
honestie and iustice.
               6 Science and knowledge separated
from iustice and other vertues,
ought not to be tearmed wisedome,
but craft and cunning.
               
                  
7 God in no place, nor in any
manner is to be held vniust, but most
perfectly and absolutely iust: & there
is nothing that more or better resembleth
him, then that man who amongst
vs is most iust.
               8 The man that is iust, though
he be a straunger, is not onely to be
preferred before a free borne citizen:
but before those also that are of a
mans owne kindred.
               9 There is nothing, wherof can
come profit or commodity by force,
if iustice be absent: but if all were
iust we should haue no need offorce.
               10 They onely are to be held &
receiued as friends vnto God, to
whom iustice is welcome as a friend.
               11 There were certaine which
said vnto Antigonus king of Macedonie,
that all things were honest and
iust vnto a king: to whome he answered:
It is true indeede: but that is
to such kings as are barbarous, but
vnto vs those things onely are honest
which are indeed honest, and those
onely iust which are indeed iust.
               12 The Poet Simonides contending

against Themistocles, and affirming
that in a certaine controuersie
he had not iudged according to right,
he answered him: that he could not
be a good Poet, if he should compose
his verses out of that forme and
number which appertained vnto thē:
euen so I (quoth he) should not be a
good citizen, if I should iudge beyond
the lawes.
               13 It is the office of a good &
sage Iudge to take counsel of the law,
of religion, of faith and of equitie: &
also to remoue farre from him luxuriousnesse,
hatred, enuie, feare and
couetousnesse.
               14 The precepts of iustice are
very bitter to the vicious and ill liuers.
               15 Iustice is the mistresse and
queene of all vertues.

               Of a wife and of mariage.
               CHAP. 39.
               1 THe peoples of Lacedemonia had
this law: that whosoeuer did
not marry should be punished: and
another punishment was ordained
for them that maryed too late: and a
third and most grieuous punishment
for him that maryed an euill wife.
               2 She cannot be thought a true
mother of her sonne, who hireth a
straunge nurse to giue him sucke, and
denyeth him her owne teates: the
two dugges of a woman are not giuen
her only for an ornament to her
brest, but also for the nourishment of
her children.
               3 If thou hast a faire wife, thou
shalt be in daunger: if she be deformed
thou wilt repent thee to haue
maried her: the meane and indifferent
fortune therefore is the best and
most assured.
               4 Socrates being demaunded, why
he did not 
                     •
                  ue a diuorce betweene
him & his wife Xantippe, who was a

woman of a most peruerse and crooked
disposition, and vsed him very iniuriously:
he answered: Because by
enduring within my house a wife
that is so disloyall and disobedient,
I haue learned to suffer more easily
when I am abroad the iniuries offered
me by other men.
               5 A wise man may take a wife if
she be faire, well behaued, and of a
noble linage.
               6 The principall & chiefest vertue
appertaining to womankind, is
pudicitie and shamefastnesse: which
being once lost in any woman, all other
vertues are cleane gone and decayed
in her.
               7 Amongst al the wars of Christians,
the worst are the assaults and
attempts giuen by men to the vndermining
of Chastitie: where the warre
is continuall without end, and the
conquest is little or none at all.
               8 There are 3. good things in mariage:
linage, faith, & a sacrament.
               9 The pudicitie and honour of a
womā cānot be violated, if her mind
be sound and preserued in chastitie.
               
                  
10 Chastitie in a woman is the
fortresse and bulwarke of her beauty.
               11 To be gouerned by the wife,
is an exceeding great iniurie to the
honour & reputation of the husband.
               12 Like as the worme eateth out
the wood: so doth the ill wife consume
the husband.
               13 It is much better to dwell in
the common high way, then to abide
in a house with a wife full of words.
               14 Hell, the loue of a woman,
the drye earth, and the fire, are neuer
satisfied, nor euer crie, ho.
               15 Martia the daughter of Cato,
being a widow, was demaunded
why she did not marry againe. Her
answer was: Because I cannot find anie
man, that had rather haue me
then my goods.
               16 To nourish or maintaine a
poore wife is a thing very difficult,
but to endure a rich wife is a hellish
torment.
               17 Theana a Greeke Ladie of notable
fame and memorie, by chance
on a time drawing vp her smocke so
high ouer her arme as she shewed

her naked elbow: One standing by
said vnto her: Oh what a faire white
arme is there! to whome she answered:
and yet for all that it is not commonly
open: and in truth it is very
requisite that not onely the elbow of
a chast woman should not be publike,
but secret in her speech likewise.
               18 The wife of Philo being demaunded,
why she did not weare
iewels at the publike feasts, answered:
It sufficeth me that I haue for my ornament
the vertue of my husband.
               19 Cato the elder condemned a
Senatour to be banished, because he
had kissed his owne wife in the presence
of his daughter.
               20 Euen as the mirror or glasse
doth not yeeld any more profit, in
being set out and garnished with precious
stones, or with gold and siluer,
if it do not perfectly represent the
forme that is presented vnto it: So a
rich wife is little woorth or of small
estimate, if her life and behauiour
be not sutable and conuenient to the
customes and fashions of her husband.
               
                  
21 Those husbands which will
not recreate and sport themselues,
drinke, laugh, and make merrie, and
vse other amiable pleasures with their
owne wiues: it is signe that they
will seeke and take their secret solace
by stealth with other women.
               22 We see that the Moone is
most bright and cleare shining, when
she is far off from the Sunne: and
when she is neare it she becommeth
obscure, and her light is darkened:
but a good wife is of a contrarie qualitie,
because her husband being in
place, she careth not to be seene of
euery bodie: but when he is away,
she keepeth her selfe priuate, & shut
vp within her house.
               23 The lawful wiues of the kings
of Persia, were accustomed to sit at
meales with their husbands: where if
they listed to vse any lasciuious or

24 A yong womā of Sparta being
questioned by one to tell him if she
had euer intreated the companie of
any man: she answered him, no truly:
but a man is welcome vnto me: teaching
thereby all honest women not
to be desirous to seek their pleasures,
but to attend til their husbands come
to offer it them.
               25 The husband that taketh a delight
in lasciuious pleasure, and is willing
that his wife should yeeld her
consent and good liking thereunto:
in my aduise may be resembled vnto
him, that commaundeth his wife to
fight with his enemies, to whom he
hath alreadie yeelded himselfe a prisoner.
               26 The foundation of all feminine
vices is auarice and couetousnesse.
               27 Necessitie is a most disloyall
gardian, and keeper of the chastitie
of women.
               28 Many women care not though
they be poore of good counsell: but
most skilfull in all wicked subtleties.
               29 The death of the husband

doth not cut off the loue of a chaste
wife.
               30 The woman is more subiect
to loue then the man.
               31 That bed is full of disquiet and
contention where the wife bringeth
with her a great dowrie or portion.
               32 Wandring and outloaping
wiues are easily corrupted and seduced.
               33 By how much more a womā is
kept straight so much the more is she
desirous of luxuriousnesse and lasciuiousnesse.
               34 Some women do more gladly
reade things that are lasciuious then
such as are honest.
               35 A woman is (as it were) a briefe
and compendious way to all mischieues:
and an artificiall inuention of
all wickednesse.
               36 Nature hath denied vnto women
strengh and great force: for otherwise
their courage being strengthened
with trumperie and deceipt
would be vnexpugnable and vnconquerable.
               37 A woman is alwayes mutable

and vnconstant.
               38 There be three things that
be notable euils: the sea, the fire, and
a woman.

               Of Fortune.
               CHAP. 40.
               1 APelles a painter of Athens, being
demaunded why he painted
Fortune standing vpon her feete: answered:
because she cannot sit.
               2 Denis the younger being demaunded,
how it could be, that his
father of a priuate man had attained
to a tyrannicall gouernement: and
that he the sonne of a tyrant was expelled
and chased from his rule and
scepter? he answered: Truely, my father
left me his tyrannie, but not his
fortune.
               3 Philip the father of Alexander
                        •
                     ,
hauing in one day many good fortunes
befallen him, said: O fortune

for these so great and notable good
fortunes, graunt me that I may haue
but one vnfortunate day.
               4 In all aduersities and misfortunes,
the most vnhappie condition
of the vnfortunate, is to remember
that once he was happie.
               5 The Poet Ion said: that fortune
and wisedome being two diuerse and
farre different things, did make notwithstanding
and bring foorth most
like and semblable effects: because
both the one & the other did exalt,
adorne, and lift men vp to the
highest degree of glorie.
               6 The goods of fortune are such,
as a man hath neede of reason for the
vse of things, and of patience in the
necessitie of them.
               7 He which is ashamed of his
fortune, is worthie of all misfortune.
               8 As euery man can vse his happie
and better fortunes: so is he most
excellent, when he can vse well his
aduerse fortunes.
               9 Fortune is more fauourable to
the vniust then to the iust: as therein
shewing her puissance & temeritie.
               
                  
10 He which is held too much
embraced and fauoured of fortune,
becommeth to be little better then a
foole.
               11 It seldome happeneth but that
fortune doth offend the greatest and
most excellent vertues.
               12 No man ought to refuse that
fortune which all others do endure.
               13 Fortune is a sodaine occurrence
of things vnthought of and vnexpected.
               14 Fortune is a proud Goddesse,
drunken and audacious.
               15 All things are gouerned by the
will of Fortune.
               16 Pompey the great said: alas Fortune,
seeing thou doest rend and
breake in sunder all things, I thinke
that I haue not any thing which I can
esteeme as my owne.
               17 The same Pompey said likewise,
I neuer had any prosperous or happie
fortune that made me proud: neither
did euer any aduersitie make me
fearefull.
               18 Fortune giueth too much to many:
but to none that which is sufficiēt.

               1 THere is none whatsoeuer aduanced,
or that can attaine to
be a Prince without the will and permission
of God.
               2 Principalitie and soueraigntie of
cōmand is giuen by fatal disposition.
               3 Kings are ordained and created
by Iupiter.
               
               4 It is not necessarie that any
should vnderstand things better then
a Prince, whose knowledge and learning
shold be a help to al his subiects.
               5 A good Prince ought to carrie
himselfe towards his subiects, as a father
amongst his children, and as God
doth towards the world.
               6 The Poet Pindarus said, that a
king was (as it were) a custome and
example to all others.
               7 A King or Prince ought to shew
himselfe terrible and seuere rather
by threates and menaces, then by
punishments and executions.
               
                  
8 The vertue of a Prince is to be
valiant, iust, seuere, graue, magnanimous,
a benefactor to many, bountifull
and liberall.
               9 A good prince is knowne by
the good qualities and giftes of his
mind: and not by gold, or rich and
sumptuous apparell.
               10 The soueraigne and chiefe
wisedome of a king, is to know how
to gouerne himselfe.
               11 The friends of a Prince ought
to feele his power and puissance, rather
by his benefites, then by iniuries
and oppressions.
               12 The people must needes cō
                  plaine,
when wicked persons come
to be their Princes.
               13 The king Anaxilaus being
demaunded, what thing was to be
said most happie in any Realme? answered:
Not to be ouercome by any
benefites.
               14 Alexander complaining himselfe,
for that his father had left so
many sonnes by diuerse women, who
might pretend title to his realme and
kingdome: king Philip his father

said vnto him: Labour to become
an honest & good man, and then by
thy owne deserts & good behauiour,
and not by mine, thou shalt be sure to
enioy and inherit my kingdome.
               15 Alcamenes a Spartan being demaunded,
how a realme might long
continue in happie estate, answered:
When the king that raigneth ouer it,
shall not care for his owne priuate
gaine and profite.
               16 In each commonwealth, this
aboue all things ought to be regarded
and established, that offices be
not set to sale for gaine or rewards.
               17 The publike wealth is the
life of a citie: and where the lawes
haue no force, it cannot be named a
weale publike.
               18 The Philosopher Antisthenes
was demaunded, why he said, that
hangmen had more humanitie then
tyrants? Because (quoth he) only guiltie
persons and offenders are put to
death by the hangman: but tyrants
do kill and murther the harmelesse
and innocent.
               
                  
19 A man is then fit to rule and
gouerne, when he hath first learned
how to gouerne.
               20 The Philosopher Bion said:
That it was needfull for a good and
iust magistrate to depart and leaue
his charge in the commonwealth, rather
with increase of honour then of
wealth.
               21 Those Princes that punish
them who do outrage and iniurie to
others, are the cause that others will
abstaine from profering the like iniuries.
               22 In a certaine great and open
place within Thebes, were set vp the images
of Iudges without hands, and
the chiefe Iudges with their eyes
blindfolded: whereby they shewed
that iustice ought to be without any
corruption of bribes or rewards.
               23 When thou shalt be placed
in any publike charge or office, admit
not about thee leud or dishonest men
for thy ministers: because the euils
which they commit, will be imputed
and attributed vnto thee.
               24 He which is in an office or

place of commaund, and maketh
lawes for other men, ought not to
gouerne onely by might and stronghand:
but by his dignitie, vnderstanding,
and other vertues, he ought to
make himselfe knowne aboue other
men.
               25 Like as the sunne which is the
life of the world, doth not attend nor
expect, that the morning should intreat
it to arise in the East: so the
prince should not looke by praises
and flatteries to do good deedes, but
he ought of himselfe to enlarge his
hand and mind to bountifull and liberall
and actions.

being demaunded, what
thing was needfull and necessarie to a
good captaine, answered: Audacitie
against his enemies, beneuolence to
his souldiers in such things as are cō
                  uenient,
and counsell for the managing
of his affaires.
               3 Pelopidas a captaine of the
Thebanes being to go to his armie, his
wife prayed him that when he came
into the field, he would haue a speciall
care to his owne safetie: to whom
he answered: that as touching that
matter, she should do well to counsel
others so to do, but for his part he
held it the part of a captaine & commaunder,
to haue a speciall regard
to the safetie of his citizens.
               4 The campe of the Numantines
in Spaine, hauing of a long time
vsed to be victorious against all the
captaines that came against them
with the Romane forces, seeing afterwards
that Scipio came as General
against them, by whom they were
defeated and slaughtered: the Senatours
of Numantia did exclaime against
their people and souldiers, reproching

them, for that they had so
shamefully betaken themselues to
flight: vnto whom a certaine Numantine
souldier said in this manner: My
Lords, I would you shold vnderstand,
that in the campe of the Romanes
there are still the same beastes that
were there before, but they haue not
the same shepheard.

pitched his campe against the
Almaines in a very drie place, where
his people were much pained with
thirst and want of water, the riuer
running close by the rampart of his
enemies; in a di
                     •
                  contented humour,
pointing with his finger to the valley
beneath his campe which was full of
water, he shewed the same vnto his
souldiers and said vnto them: There
my maisters you may haue water enough
and drinke your fils, if you
list paine your selues to take it.
               6 Lauinius a Romane hauing taken
the citie of Corinth, did not carry
away any riches or treasure to his
owne house: and albeit all Italy were
enriched with the pillage of that city:

yet was he in such pouertie and necessitie,
as the Senate of Rome did
marrie his daughter at the common
charge of the citie.
               7 Quintus Fabius Minutius being
aduised by his sonne to seize vpon
a certaine place, as a thing which he
might do with the losse of a very few
men: he said vnto him: Wilt thou be
one of those few?
               8 Scipio the African being accused
by one, that he was alwaies fighting,
and in the field, answered: It is
true, for my mother bred me from
the cradle to be a captaine and a soldier.
               9 Marcus Iiuius being exhorted
by some to pursue without ceassing
the campe of Hasdarubal, which he
had defeated and put to flight: answered:
Let them alone, let some of thē
liue, that they may carrie to our enemies
the newes of our victorie.

was not fit for any to erre twice: because

that they wold not allow any of their

part of the pray or bootie vnto the
king: who smiling thereat answered
presently: Thou tellest me good

mother. This he said, because he

               10 Eudamidas the sonne of Archidamus,
seeing Xenocrates now
growne old, disputing with one of
his familiars, demanded of him who
that man was: whereunto answer being
made, that he was one of the
most wise and sagest men that knew
how to search out vertue▪ he replyed,
And when trow you will he vse vertue,
that now at these yeares is but
seeking and searching for it.
               11 Pausanias after he was sent
into exile, giuing great commendations

not the custome of Phisitions to dwel
with them that be sound and healthfull:
but in that place where men are
sicke and diseased.
               12 Archidamus being demaunded

possessed, answered: So
much as they could get and purchase

by the sword.

               Of Vertue.
               CHAP. 44.
               1 THe practise of vertue is seene to
be euer conuersant about the

affections and the actions, in which
consisteth much, little and a meane.
It many times falleth out, that we
feare one more and another lesse: that
one is confident, another desireth:
one is fierce, and another is angry &
cholerick: & there is not any good either
in the one sort or other: and especially
when it is needful, and to whō,
and for what occasion, and how. But
mediocritie is the best, the which of
it selfe properly is the true vertue:
Then vertue is an habite of election
which consisteth in the meane, which
men call mediocritie.
               2 I haue made search if it be possible
for a man to know those things
which are manifest in vertue: but I
could neuer yet find them.
               3 It appertaineth vnto the vertue
of the sexe feminine to gouerne the
house well and rightly, and to haue
the custodie, and looking to domesticall
matters, and to be obedient to
her husband.
               4 Force, wisedome, temperance,
magnificence, are vertues with many
others: but vertue cannot be caught:

seeing then that vertue cannot be had
by doctrine, it is not a science.
               5 If vertue do faile and escheat
in man, (which no man can deny:)
then doth felicitie also faile in him.
               6 Vertue is a thing which is able
to giue vs immortalitie, and to make
vs equall to the gods.

euen the most valiant.
               9 Nature cannot establish any
thing so high, but vertue can reach
vnto it.
               10 To die continually for vertue,
is not to dye.
               11 Vertue it selfe ought to be
honoured, and not the image of vertue.
               
                  
12 There is no vertue in this
life, except it be to loue the thing that
is to be beloued: and to loue that, is
prudence: and not to be moued or
troubled for any matter of molestation,
that is fortitude: nor for any
matter of flatterie and delight, that is
temperance: nor for pride, that is iustice.
               13 Gorgias the Oratour being
demaunded if the king of Persia were
happie, answered: I know not how
much vertue he hath.
               14 I neuer knew any man, who
trusting in his owne vertue, did enuie
the vertue of another man.
               15 Vertue is couragious through
her owne proper riches: and she careth
not to be celebrated with the fauor
of the common people, because
she hath no need of praise and commendation.
               16 The vertue of the mind liueth,
when all other things do dye
and perish.
               17 That vertue which proceedeth
out of a comely and beautifull

                  son, is much more amiable, and

purchaseth the greater grace and fauour.
            
            
               Of Death.
               CHAP. 45.
               1 ONe saying, that it was a hard &
difficult thing to liue: Nay
(quoth Diogenes) but it is hard to liue
ill.
               2 If a young man do liue to old
age then he commeth to lament and
to plaine himselfe to the gods, saying:
that when it is requisite his labours
and troubles should cease and he liue
at rest: euen then is he most troubled
and surcharged with affaires: afterwards
when death approcheth, then
would he liue, and requesteth the
Phisitions not to be carelesse of his
health and welfare.
               3 O straunge and wonderfull
minded men, who would not willingly
neither liue nor dye!
               4 I had rather liue and serue a
man that is poore and beggerly, and
one to whome meanes of liuing are
wanting, then to commauud ouer all

dead men.
               5 Death is no grieuous thing:
neuerthelesse it is a kind of iniurie in
the end, which is ful of feare & terror
               6 Seeing all men must needes
dye, I do hold that it is a happie
thing to dye not late but honorably.
               7 The Poet Simonides said: That
death is the medicine of all euils incident
to man.
               8 There is nothing better for a
man then to be borne, nor any thing
better for him then to dye soone and
quickly.
               9 Gorgias Leontin being neare his
end, and departing by little and little
as it were in a sleepe or dreame, was
demanded by a familiar frend of his:
what do you? To whome he answered:
Now doth sleepe begin to recommend
me to her sister.
            
            
               Of Felicitie.
               CHAP. 46.
               1 FElicitie is the end of all things
which are to be desired. Some
haue said, that felicitie is prosperitie

of fortune: and some say vertue: but
it is fit and conuenient, that felicitie
be giuen from the Gods. The felicitie
of the soule, is an operation perfected
by vertue.
               2 Vertue commeth of science,
and of vertue proceedeth the soueraigne
good: what can this soueraign
and chiefe good be, but God & heauen,
whence our soule is deriued?
               3 The soueraigne good of the
soule is to be like vnto God.
               4 This is felicitie (as saith Aristotle)
which is not consisting in one
onely art, but in all the course of a
perfect life.
               5 They are truely happie which
are with truth: but they which liue in
vanitie cannot be happie.
               6 Some by too great felicitie,
care nothing for God at all.
               7 To happy men, the consideration
of miseries seemeth to be a very
streight and difficult thing.
               8 To be happie, is to liue well
and to do well.
               9 No man can be happie, but
he that is wise and good. It followeth

then that wicked men are miserable:
and therefore not the rich man but
the prudent man flyeth and shunneth
miserie.
               10 Felicitie is deuided into fiue
parts. The first is, to take good counsell:
the second is, to haue the sences
strong and sound, & to be of a good
disposition of bodie: the third is, to
be fortunate in all actions: the fourth
to be alwaies neare and in companie
with men excellent in glorie and renowne:
the fifth is to abound in
wealth and all other such things as
serue for the necessitie of mans life.
               11 Happie are they that haue a
good soule: and that is giuen them
from heauen.
               12 Felicitie is either by destiny,
or of fortune, or of vertue.
               13 As sicke men cannot tast the
sauour of any meates, so cannot any
man attaine to happinesse and felicitie,
if he embrace not vertue.
               14 They are not happie whom the
common sort reputeth happie.
               15 No man in truth is happie amongst
all mortall men liuing.
