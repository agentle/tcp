And sūtime if it be to playn agaīst him / thā wyll he call it no scrypture / as he playth wt ye pystle of saynt Iamys. And because the olde holy doctors be full & hole against him / he settyth thē all at nought. And wyth these worshipfull wyse ways he proclamyth hī self a cōquerour / where besidꝭ all ye rēnaūt / wherin euery chylde may se hys proud frātyk foly he ys shāfully put to flyght in ye furst poynt / yt had at ye furst face sum vysage of ꝓbabylyte.

Now must he by that meanys condemne the chyrch of Cryste / for that they sayntyfy not the saturday which was the sabbaothe day instytute by god amonge the Iewes / cōmaundyng the sabbat daye to be kept holy. And albeyt the matter of ye precepte ys morall & the day legall so yt yt may be chaunged / yet wyll ther I weene no man thynke / that euer the chyrch wold take vppon thē to chaūge yt wythout specyall ordynaūce of god. wherof we fynd no remēbraunce at all in holy scripture. By what scripture is euydētly knowen yt euery mā & womā hath power to mynyster the sacramēt of baptysme? Let yt be shewyd / eyther cōmaundment / councell / lycence or example expressyd in scrypture. ¶Many thyngys ar there lyke / whyche as holy doctours agree / were taught thappostels by Cryste / & the church by thappostels / and so comen downe to our days by cōtynuall successyō fro theyrs. But I wyll lette all other passe ouer & speke but of one. ¶Euery good cristen man I dout not beleuyth that oure blessyd Lady was a perpetuall vyrgyn aswell after the byrth of Cryste as before. For yt were a straunge thynge yt she shuld after that blessyd byrth be lesse myndid to clennes & puryte / and set lesse by her holy purpose & ꝓmyse of chastyte vowed and dedycate vnto god / thē she dyd before. For suerly who so consyderyth ye wordys of the gospell in saynt Luke / shall well ꝑceyue that shee had vowyd vyrginite. For when ye angell had sayd vnto her / Lo thou shalt cōceyue in thy wōbe & bryng forth a chylde / and thou shalt call his name Iesus / she answerd hym / how may thys be? for as for man I know none. whych though yt be spoken but for the tyme than present / yett muste yt nedys sygnyfy that she neuer wolde knowe none after the maner of spekynge. By whych a nunne myghte say / as for man there medelyth none wt me. sygnyfieng that neuer there shall. And in commen speche ys that fygure mych in vse. By which a woman sayth of one whom she is determynyd neuer to mary / we maye well talke to gether but we wed not to gether / meanyng yt they neuer shall wed to gether. And in such wise ment our lady whē she sayd / how may thys be for I know no man / meanyng that she neuer wolde medle wyth man. Or els had her answere no thyng bene to purpose. For the angell sayd not / Lo thou art cōceyuyd. which yf he had sayde / shee myghte well haue maruelyd onely for yt she knew no man all redy. But when he sayd thou shalte cōceyue / thys coud be no maruell vnto her for that she knew no man all redy. And therfore syth she maruaylyd how it myghte be yt euer she shuld cōceyue & haue a chylde / it muste nedys bee yt her answer mēt yt she neuer wold medle wt man. And therefore shee maruelyd because he said it shuld be & she knew not how it coude be / but yt ways by whych she was at full poīt wt her self yt it shuld neuer be. so yt thē he shewyd her how it shuld cū about by ye holy gost cūmyng into her / & ye power of god on hygh shadoyng her. & thē she assētyd & sayd / Lo here ye handmayd of god / be yt done to me after thy worde as thou tellyst me. And thus appereth yt euydently yt she had than a full determinyd purpose of vyrgynyte. And that as it semith such as she thought not lawfull to change..

For ellys whā ye angell did ye message / she might haue enclined therto though she had byfore bene in a nother minde. Now whan she had then so full & faste a purpose of ꝑpetuall vyrginite bifore the birthe of her blessyd chylde / whiche cam among his other heuinly doctrine to call and exorte the worlde frome all pleasure of ye fleshe to ye purytye & clennes of the body and soule / and from ye desyre of carnall generacyō to a gostly regeneracion in grace / more

Or what man coud thynk yt that euer god wold suffer any erthly man after / to be conceyuyd in that holy closet taken vp and consecrate so specyally to god? Thys reuerent artycle of our ladys perpetuall vyrgynyte / the chyrche of Cryste beyng taught the trouthe by Cryste / perpetually hath beleuyd syns the tyme of Cryste. And yet is ther no worde therof in Crystys gospell wryten / but rather dyuers textys so sownning to the contrary / that by the wrōg vnderstangyng of them / the heretyke Eluydyus toke the occasyon of hys herysy / by whych he wold that oure lady after the byrth of Cryst had other chyldern by Ioseph.

Poule had nothyng fered nor forbode / but lest Timotheus shold take in such a wydow as neuer had no husbande at all. Were not thys wysely construed? Now yf Tyndall wyll agree as he nedys must but yf he be mad / that saynt Powle in gyuyng cōm

And theron he concludeth that prestys muste nedes haue wyues. But now what yf a man wolde deny hym though chastyte be a grete gyfte / yt yet yt is a seledome gyft. For though yt be rare and seledome in respecte of ye remanaūte of the people that haue yt not / yet is yt not seledome in dede / for many men haue yt. And Cryst sayth ye al mē take it not / but he sayth not that no man taketh yt / nor that fewe men take yt. And hyghly he cōmēdeth them that for hys sake do take yt. What incōuenyence is yt than to take in to his specyall seruyce men of that sorte that he moste specyally cōmendeth? Or yf we graūted to Tyndal that fewe men can lyue chaste / whych is playne false (for many hath done & doth) but now yf we dyd I saye graūte hym yt thyng / though he myght ꝑaduenture thervpō conclude / yt there shold not be so many prestys made and bounden to chastyte as coulde not lyue chaste / yet coulde he not cōclude as he now cōcludeth / that no preste shold be suffred to lyue chast / but that euery preste muste nedes haue a wyfe.

And vppon heresye so proued agaynst hym whome they had hanged / lest he sholde saye for hym selfe / they burned vppe the holy scrypture of god / and the body of a good man therwyth. For I haue herd hym called a very honest person and of a good substaunce. ¶Forsothe quod I of good substaunce he was I thynke well worthe a. M. markys.

For I haue not only ben dyuers tymes present my selfe at certayn examynacyons therof / but haue also dyuers and many tymes sunderly talked wyth almost all such except the ded mā hym self / as moost knew of the mater. whych mater was many tymes in sundry placys examyned.

For it was thei say by necromācie And the bysshops yt were there wolde haue had y• man burned to for wychecrafte. And told me also yt there was a nother whyche had sene meny men yt had hanged thē self / a man that had bē long in offyce vnder dyuers of the kyngys almoygners / to whom ye goodys of such men as kylled them self be appoynted by ye law / and hys offyce / as deodandes to be gyuen in almoyse This man as I haue herd saye / shewed vnto the lordys by suche experyence as he had good and playne tokēs / by whych they perceyued well that Hunne dyd neuer hange hym selfe. I haue herd also that a spyrytuall man and one that loued well the chaunceler / and was a laborer for that parte / yet coulde not deny before all the lordys but that he hadde tolde a temporall man and a frende of hys / that Hunne had neuer ben accused of heresye yf he had neuer sued the premunyre. And by saynt Mary that was a shrewd worde. How be yt in dede yt went not so nere the mater as the tother two thyngys dyd. ¶ Yes in good faythe quod I all thre lyke nere whan they were all herd. But of trouth many other thyngys were there layd / that vppon the herynge semed myche more suspycyouse than these. Whyche yet whan they were answered / alway loste more than halfe theyr strength. But as for these thre maters I promyse you proued very tryfles / and such as yf ye had herd theym ye wolde haue lawghed at theym seuen yere after. ¶ I beseche you quod he lette me here howe they proued. ¶ I am lothe quod I to lette you and lese youre tyme in suche tryfles.

For I haue shewed you that they kepe none frome theym / but suche translacyon as be eyther not yet approued for good / or such as be all redy reproued for naught / as Wyclyffys was and Tyndals. For as for other olde onys / that were before Wyclyffys days / remayn lawful / and be in some folkys handys had and red. ¶Ye say well quod he. But yet as women say / somwhat yt was alway that ye cat wynked whan her eye was oute. Surely so ys yt not for nought that ye englysh byble is in so few mennys handys / whan so many wold so fayn haue yt. ¶That ys very trouth q I. For I thynke that though the fauourers of a secte of heretyques be so feruent in the settynge for the of theyr sect / that they let not to lay theyr money togyder and make a purse amonge thē for the pryntyng of an euyll made or euyll translated boke / whych though yt happe to be forboden and burned yet som be solde ere they be spyed / & eche of theym lese but theyr parte / yet I thynk ther wyll no prynter lyghtely be so hote to put eny byble in prent at hys own charge / wherof the losse sholde lye hole in hys owne necke / and than hange vppon a doutfull tryall whyther the fyrst copy of hys translacyon was made before Wyclyffys dayes or synnys. For yf yt were made synnys / yt must be approued byfore the pryntynge. And surely howe yt hathe happed that in all thys whyle god hathe eyther not suffred or not prouyded that eny good vertuouse man hath had the mynde in faythfull wyse to translate yt / and thervppō eyther the clergye or at the lest wyse somone bysshop to approue yt / thys can no thynge tell.

And where as many thyngys be layd agaynst yt / yet ys there in my mynde not one thyng that more putteth good men of the clergye in dout to suffer yt / than thys yt they se somtyme myche of the worse sort more feruent in the callyng for yt / than thē whom we fynde far better. Whych maketh theym to fere lest such men desyre yt for no good / and lest yf yt were had in euery mānys hand / there wold gret parell aryse / and that sedycyouse people shold do more harme therwyth / thā god and honest folke sholde take frute therby. Whyche fere I promyse you no thyng fereth me / but that who so euer wolde of theyre malyce or foly take harme of that thynge that ys of yt self ordeyned to do all men good / I wold neuer for thauoydyng of theyr harme / take frome other the profyte whyche they myght take / and no thyng deserue to lese. For ellys yf thabuse of a good thyng shold cause the takynge awaye therof frome other that wolde vse yt well / Cryst shold hym selfe neuer haue ben borne / nor brought hys fayth in to the worlde / nor god sholde neuer haue made yt neyther / yf he shold for ye losse of those that wold be dāpned wreches / haue kepte away thoccasyon of reward from theym that wold wyth helpe of hys grace endeuoure theym to deserue yt. ¶I am sure q your frende ye dowt

not but that I am full & hole of youre mynd in thys mater that ye byble shold be in our englysh tonge. But yet that ye clergye ys of the cōtrary and wold not haue yt so / that appereth well in that they suffre it not to be so. And ouer that I here in euery place almoost where I fynde eny lerned man of theym / theyr myndꝭ all set theron to kepe ye scryptur from vs. And they seke oute for ye parte euery roten reason that they can fynd / and set them forth solemply to ye shew / thoughe fyue of those reasons be not worth a fygge. For they begyn as far as our fyrst father Adam / and shew vs that hys wyfe and he fell out of paradyse wyth desyre of knowlege and cunning. Now yf this wold serue / it must from ye knowlege & studye of scrypture dryue euery man preste and other / leste yt dryue all cut of paradyse. Than say they that god taught hys dyscyples many thyngys aparte / bycawse the peple sholde not here yt. And therfore they wold the people shold not now be suffred to rede all. Yet they saye ferther y• yt is hard to translate the scrypture out of one tonge in to a nother / & specyally they say in to ours. whyche they call a tonge vulgare & barbarous. But of all thyng specyally they say that scrypture ys the fode of the soule. And that the comen peple be as infantys that must be fedde but wyth mylke and pappe. And yf we haue eny stronger mete yt muste be chammed afore by the nurse and so put in to ye babys mouth. But me thynk though the make vs all infantys / they shal fynd many a shrewd brayn amōg vs / y• can perceyue chalk fro chese wel ynough and yf they wold onys take vs our mete in our owne hāde.

For let them cal vs yong babys & they wul / yet by god they shal for all that well fynde in some of vs y• an olde knaue ys no chylde. ¶Surely quod I such thyngys as ye speke / ys the thyng that as I somwhat sayd before putteth good folke in fere to suffer the scrypture in our englysh tōge. Not for the redynge & receyuyng / but for y• bysy chammyng therof / and for myche medlyng wyth suche partys therof as lest wyll agre wyth theyr capacytees. For vndoutedly as ye spake of our mother Eue / īordynate appetyte of knowledge in a meane to dryue eny man out of a paradyse. And inordynate ys the apperyte whan men vnlerned though they rede yt in theyr langage / wyll be bysye to enserche and dyspute the grete secrete mysteryes of scrypture / whyche though they here they be not able to ꝑceyue. Thys thynge ys playnly forboden vs that be not appoynted nor instructed therto. And therfore holy saīt Gregory naziazenus that grete solempne doctour sore toucheth and reproueth all suche bolde besy medlers in the scrypture / & sheweth that yt is in Exody by Moyses a scendynge vp vppon the hyll where he spake wyth god and ye peple taryeng benethe / ye ye peple be forbodē to presume to medle wt the hygh mysteryes of holy scrypture / but owe to be content to tary bynethe & medle none hygher than ys mete for theym / but receyuynge fro the heyght of the hyll by Moyses that y• ys delyuered theym / yt ys to wyte the lawys and preceptys yt they muste kepe / and the poyntys they must byleue / loke well theruppon / and often / and medle well therwyth.

               ¶To thys yt was answered that yf thys opynion were true / yet yt well appered that thys ys not the thynge that they mene. For the wordys of Luther and Pomerane and all the archeretyques of that secte be very playne. For they saye yt yt ys sacrylege to go about to please god by eny good workys but fayth onely.

                   he answered that many textys of scrypture enduced theym ther vnto / & specyal textys of saynt Poule / Fides iustificat / fayth iustyfyeth. And Credidu Abraam deo / et reputatū est

If we be iustyfyed by workꝭ / thā dyd Cryst dye for vs for naught. Gratꝭ redēpti estis / ye be redemed frely. And therby maye we se that oure workys were parte of the cause. And yet specyally these wordys of our sauyour Cryst he sayd mych moued them to be of that mynd / wher he sayth Qui crediderit et baptisatus fuerit saluus erit / He that byleueth & ys baptysed shall be saued. where Cryst requyryth nothyng but only fayth.
               ¶By all these textys he sayd y• playnly appered that all our saluacyon cam of faythe / as Abraam was iustyfyed by fayth and not by his workꝭ. And that yf our good workys shold be the cause of our saluacyon / than as saynt Poule sayth Cryst dyed for nought. For he neded not to dye for vs / yf our own workys myght saue vs. Nor we were not redemed frely / yf we shold redeme our selfe wyth the payement of oure owne workys.
               ¶To this was yt answered that those textys and all other alledged for that purpose / sygnyfye none other but that after the faythe of Cryst brought in to the worlde by the incarnacyon & passyō of our blessyd sauyour / men are no le

Nor that all the law of Moyses / nor all the good workys of man / were not able to saue one man of them selfe / nor wythout fayth / and y• Cryst frely redemed vs. For neyther had he or euer shall haue eny reward of vs for the bytter paynes taken in hys blyssed passyon for vs. Nor neuer deserued we vnto hym that he sholde so mych do for vs. Nor the fyrste faythe / nor the prechynge therof / nor the fyrst iustyfycacyon of man therby / nor the sacrament and fruyte of our baptysme / was not gyuen to the world for eny good workys that euer the world had wrought / but only of goddys mere lybetal goodnes. But yet there ys neuer a texte of them nor eny other in all scrypture so mēt / that after the baptysme the fayth onely shall saue vs wythout good workys / yf we lyue and haue reason to do thē. For though it be sayd by the mouth of our sauyour / he that byleueth shall be saued / where he nothyng speketh of eny good workꝭ / yet meaneth he not that he that byleueth shall be saued / wythout good workys yf he lyue to do theym.
