            TO THE MOST WORTHY, the moſt vertuous and godly Prince Henry, by the grace of God, Prince of Wales, Duke of Cornwell, Earle of Cheſter, and heire apparant of the Realmes of England, Scotland, France and Ireland.
            
            
               MOſt worthy & moſt renowned Prince, there is nothing more pleaſing to a ſpirit endued with knowledge, then Truth when ſhe is moſt bare and naked.
            The pure Corall needes no colouring, and a good cauſe it ſelfe bringeth credit, it needeth not the help of Art.
            The deceitful Phiſitian giueth pleaſant Syriopes, to make his poyſon to goe downe the ſmoother, and the ſweet ſongs of Calipſo, were but ſubtill ſnares to Vliſſes.
            
            An oylie mouth may haue a gaulding minde, and it ſeemeth vnto me, that theſe profeſſors of Eloquence are to be ſuſpected, and their ſtraining of words and ſentences (as it were to ſet them on the Teynter) doth ſhewethe little plaine dealing that is within them.
            Yet I would not ſeeme to take the Penne out of his hand that doth write of Eloquēce, for that were as if a man ſhuld labour to take the lightning from Iupiter, or to ſeeke to bereaue the fire of his heate.
            And Art (I know) is the Pilot in the ſea of wit: Art is the ſword to conquere Ignorance: and Art is the ſole directer when the worlde would erre. But yet to vſe ſuperfluous Eoquence, in a matter of ſufficient excellency, is a greater ſhew of a pregnant wit, then of a perfect wiſedome.
            Now ſithens my abilitie ſerueth to no better purpoſe, then to ſet foorth in this kind of writing thoſe experiments which 40. yeares training in the warres hath taught me, I haue not vndertaken as a ſubtill Logitian, for I neuer learned thoſe places from whence arguments are drawne.
            Thoſe haue need of artificial ſpeeches, who with pleaſing words do go about to couer diſhoneſt deeds.
            
               
The matters by me handled, I haue ſet downe plainly, I haue neither floriſhed them with Art, nor ſmoothed them with Flattery.
            I haue graſped at abuſe: yet vnder generalities, not aiming at any one particularly, that hath not a guiltie conſcience to accuſe himſelfe, I haue winked at ſomewhat, leaſt I might ſeeme curious, and haue pretermitted neceſſities, in that they require matter paſſing my reach: neither doe I ſeeke heerein the praiſe of mine owne wit, but to declare the loue I beare to my Countrie, and the dutifull zeale I tender, (and withal humblenes I here preſent) to your excellēt highnes.
            If my vnlettered diligence be gratiouſly accepted, I neither feare the ſpightfull eye of Enuie, neither yet the cenſure of any others in thoſe things, which I haue onely conſecrated to your gratious vewe.
            I acknowldge mine owne vnworthineſſe, and I confeſſe my little skill and abilitie to performe, but it is a gratious acceptance, that incourageth me, for I aſſure my ſelfe, that a magnificent and princely minde cannot want in him that is deſcended from ſo magnificent and princely regenie: Alexander diſdained not to be praiſed by a M

            The ſubiect is not altogether vnneceſſarie to be conſidered of, for it concerneth the affaires of warre, a knowledge behouefull for the greateſt Monarch, when a King is not ſo much renowned for his crowne, as for his courage and ſkill in the knowledge of armes.
            For although all the giftes of Fortune are to be deſpiſed in reſpect of learning, yet in a Prince, there is nothing ſo glorious as to be called a great Captaine, or a worthy ſouldier.
            Accept them (gratious Prince) as the earneſt penny of a faithfull heart, accept them and protect them from the malitious interpretour, accept them (with all humbleneſſe I beſeech it) for his ſake, that with all loue and dutie will daily pray, that as you are knowne to be deſcended from a moſt royall and princely progenie, and to be the vndoubtfull heire of your worthie fathers Crowne and Scepter, ſo you may growe in renowne & honour equall to your aunceſtors, & may ſucceed your royall parents in their vertues.

            To auoyd Idleneſſe, I haue betaken me to write, and to make my ſelfe ſociable with the multitude, I haue mingled matters of importance, with matters of ſmall regarde: I know this is the humorous age, and although to reade ouer fewe things aduiſedcy, proſiteth, yet to runne through many things (though ſlightly) delighteth, and a man that can but tattle of this and that (though to little purpoſe) shall haue audience.
            I know ſome wil ſay, that he which wil aduenture to ſpeake of many matters, may rather be tearmed venturous then learned: but I anſwere with that great Captain Marius, who ſpeaking before the people of Rome, ſaid, If my words be not wel ſet together, I care not: ſo long as I know my meaning to be good and honeſt.
            
               
Then let Maenius finde fault, and let Boldunus eauil, all is one to me, I will but turne the Buckle of my girdell a litle behind me, and then let any Ieſtmonger of them all, runne at me with his ſtrongeſt inuention, and he ſhall neuer hit me, whre he ſhall be able to hurt me.
            I will wade no farther in mine owne praiſe, becauſe I was neuer beholding to mine owne tongue: but as I know there are ſome that are too quicke of ſight, ſo there be ſome others that wil winke if they ſee a fault: I reuerence him, and do wiſh with all my heart, that this ſecond incounter betweene Captaine Skill and Captaine Pill, might be as pleaſing vnto him, as I hope it wil be profitable to ſome others, that shall peruſe & ouer looke it, with aduiſed iudgment.

               Captaine Pill, the time that you tell me you haue ſpent in the campe, hath not bene ill imployed, for that I perceius you haue profited much: I ſée it hath inlightened your vnderſtanding to know your owne imperfections, and there cannot be a more learned ignorance, then for a man to confeſſe his owne ignorance: now for the Militia of theſe times which you ſay is ſo confounded with abſurdities, I beleeue it to be true, but he that ſhould thinke to amend it by finding faulte, might do as Apelles prentiſe, who drawing of a picture, ſéeking to mende the noſe, marred the chéeke: you and I may talke of many abuſes, as it were by the way of communication, but I dare not attribut any ſuch ſingularity to my ſelf as to giue any cenſure, yet vpon the requeſt you haue made, of any thing it ſhall like you to demaunde, I am contented to aduenture my opinion, but not to ſet-downe precepts.

               Why then Captaine Skill I will procéede: but here now I ſhould kéepe a gods Decorum, eſpecially in Method, but that is looked for from Schollers, and not from Soldiers, and I haue learned the further off from art, the more Souldierlike: then mount you vp my thoughts, yet raiſe your ſelues with reuerence, ſo as you neither do Minerua wrong, nor care what Momus can obiect.
               Now before I ſpeake of defects, I will firſt beginne with warre it ſelfe, that I thinke cannot be managed but with diſorder, whoſe beſt fruites are ſo inormious, that it hath béene had inqueſtion, and many times diſputed on, whether warre may be approued to be either good or lawfull, before the ſeats and Maieſtie of God?
            
            
               Skill.
               I take thoſe men that wil moue ſuch doubts, to be vtterly ignorant aſwell in the hiſtory of the Scriptures, as in the ſtate of a happy Common-wealth, for he that taught Dauid to ſing, Bloſſed be the Lord my ſtrength, which teacheth my hands to make warre, and my fingers to fight, had

               But what excuſe for the great effuſion of bloud? or is it not a horrour to thinke of the murthers & ſlaughters made by men vpon men in the furie and heat of warre?
            
            
               Skill.
               I will referre this to the noble Ioſua, who being in the purſuite of his enemies, and fearing that the day had bene too ſhort, commaunded the Sunne to neglect his accuſtomed courſe, and to ſtay her ſelfe in the middle of the heauen, till he had performed his ſlaughter to the full.
            
            
               Pill.
               Why then to ſpoile and kill an enemy we ſée the warrant is good, but there be ſome that will make difficulties, and then they will diſtinguiſh betwéene ambitious warre, & warre that is but defenſiue, and almoſt they will admit of no warre at all to be lawfull.
            
            
               Skil.
               Warre is to be vndertaken but to the end to haue peace, and for matters in clayme, in defence of libertie, and ſuch other like, aſwell the lawes of nature as the lawes of nations doth admit it.
               For theſe diſtinctions I will leaue them to Diuines, but warre is euermore attended on by Sword, Fyre, Famine, and Murther: the ſinnes of the people is it that giueth the firſt Allarum, and vnſheatheth the ſouldiers ſword, and warre hauing once diſplayed his Banner, it is the iuſtice of the cauſe that approoueth it eyther to be good or bad.
               But yet the obtaining of a victory is not a ſure confirmation of this right & equity, for when the children of Iſrael were gathered together in Silo, to puniſh the ſhamefull ſodometry of the tribe of Beniamin, they loſt in two ſeueral battells 40000.

men: notwithſtanding they had a iuſt cauſe, and fought both the times by the appointment and commaundement of God.
               By warre to ſubdue a forraine foe, the conqueſt is glorious, but in ciuill warre there is nothing more miſerable then victorie.
               The practiſe and knowledge of Armes, hath euer béene carefully indeuoured in all ages, and in euery well gouerned Common-wealth, when by it Empires haue béene attained, Kingdomes inlarged, the ſtraights of Pontus hath béene opened, and the incloſures of the Alpes broken vp.
               By it Princes are protected, Iuſtice is maintained, good lawes preſerued, and the Common-wealth defended.
               Great is the knowledge of Armes therefore, and there is nothing more neceſſary, immediatly after the knowledge of God, then to knowe how to mannage our martiall cauſes, and as in euery action it is odious is erre, ſo in warres it is moſt daungerous of all other, becauſe that one miſtaking is ynough to ouerthrowe a whole Armie, whereon might depend the wracke of a Common-wealth, and the loſſe of a Princes Crowne.
               Warre and the Soule communicates in this, that both of them are in their ſimple natures hardly found out, but are duly defined by their effects.
               Nothing waxeth young in this world but warre, neyther hath arte euer ſought out a ſubiect more ambiguous, for with the Camelion it changeth according to the obiect, and like an impoſſible infinit in nature, carrieth his euents beyond the reache of coniecture.
               In the heauens it worketh harmony, on the earth peace, it is the hand of deſteny to inforce chaunge, the ſcourge of God to puniſh ſinnes, the true adamant that draweth courage vnto it, and a Baſilique to feare that dyes to behold it: It is oyle in the ſtomacke that hath diſgeſted poyſon, as a medecine to a body that is choaked vp with corrupt humours, as a Fyre to the mettall that wants refining, as exerciſe to the body growne purſie with ydleneſſe, it is the Theater wheron Nobilitie was

borne to ſhew himſelfe, a glaſſe wherein policie eſpieth his infirmities, the worſt and beſt that euer Fortune could promiſe her fauourites.
               The ſurfits of peace firſt quickened it, and tyrany that gaue it ſucke, periſhed in cheriſhing it.
               It began in heauen, in the rebellion of Lucifer, it preſumed vpon Paradiſe, betwéene the firſt man, and the Angell, in Shinare ambition made Nymrod embrace it: Neare Sodom affection cauſed Abraham to entertaine it: Sithens in the world it hath béene the Key of alterations, the diſpoſer and ſpoyler of Monarchies, the founder of obſcurities, the worker of miracles.
               There is nothing ſo intire, that it hath not ſeparated, neither ſo diſſolued that it could not reconcile.
               Peace vnto it, is as Caſtor and Pollax in a ſtorme, a hope of ſafetie, warre vnto peace, as a motion to reſt, the meanes to produce it.
               It fauoureth not the multitude of men, but reſpects the value, and ſuffers valour ſometimes to periſh in the armes of a fearefull multitude: it is the ſcourge of ſecuritie, the plague of timerites, the end of hatreds, and the beginning of diſcontents.
               It fauoureth iniuſtice, and oppreſſeth innocents, it ſtrikes as God willes, workes as ſinne warpes it: briefly, a miſerable neceſſitie in nature, and a neceſſary corrector of times infirmitie.

               Why, then by this deſcription and by the reſt, what I haue noted, I perceiue that it is good to be a ſkilfull warriour, but ill againe to bée a great warre louer. Well Menelanus, I may commend thy valour, but neuer thy wit, that wouldſt make a continuance often yeares warre, but to recouer a ſtrumpet.

               Ten yéeres war could not be cōtinued but with ten yeres woe, yet this bleſſednes of peace that is ſo much deſired, doth eſpecially conſiſt in the knowledge of warre.

               Why, then the feates of warre are not to be neglected, though in the midſt of the moſt happie peace.
            
            
               
               Skill.
               When is the ſtorme more rather to be prouided for, but whyleſt the weather is faire, neyther is there a more dangerous thing then in the time of peace to neglect the knowledge of Armes, for when that care is ſet aſide, both Prince and People are left as a pray for euery oppreſſour, and is an inducement for him to attempte, that otherwiſe would bée glad to combine.
            
            
               Pill.
               I can tell you Captaine Skill, this doctrine will be reputed flat hereſie: what in the time of peace to prouide for warre, & to ſpend money when they ſee no danger? I can tell you our peace-mongers cānot abide it, nay they will not heare the name of warre ſo much as ſpoken of, till they haue newes that the Beacons be on fire about their eares.

               I might ſpend a long time in deliuering preſidents, how manie inconueniences haue bene incurr'd where they haue neglected this preparation, and omitting all the reſt, let Salomon giue vs light, who though he were promiſed a peaceable gouernment by God himſelfe, and had this addition to be called Rex pacificus, yet he furniſhed his Garriſons with more warlike prouiſions then euer his father Dauid had done before him, notwithſtanding he was ſtill turmoyled and euery day bu

               Preparation then is alwayes to be in readineſſe, but doth not this readines conſiſt aſwell in training men, & making them ſkilfull & ready in Military knowledgs, as in preparing all other habiliments & neceſſaries appertaining to the wars?
            
            
               Skill.
               Yong ſouldiors vnprouided and ſleightly trayned, are not to be drawen into the field againſt an Armie exercized and beaten with long practiſe, for vnexperimented men are fitter to furniſh a funeral then to ſight a fielde: as little ſafetie is to be hoped for in ſmall and vnequall numbers, which do rather ſéed then end the warres, & do rather increaſe charge then win Honor: ſmall cōpanies are ſhut vp without doing good to

themſelues or hurt to their enemies, & as they are little feared of their enemies, ſo they are leſſe eſteemed by their friends.
               Where there is a mighty Army in the field, what City or Towne, Country or Prouince, wil not be glad to curry fauor, and willing to redeeme their good will?
               To conclude, a féeble Armie is euer deſpiſed aſwell by friends as fues, but an able Army that is prepared and managed as it ought, will ſoone bring an enemie to yeelde eyther by victorie or compoſition.
            
            
               Pill.
               Then they are a little miſtaken that doo thinke becauſe they are able on the ſodaine to furniſh a Muſter rowle with infinite numbers of names, that therefore they can as quickly ſupplie the field with an able company of Soldiours: and there muſt be a like preparation of mony as of men, for monie is tearmed to be the ſinewes of warre, and is of ſuch importance in the Campe, that though a man haue plentie of Souldiers to follow him, and ſtore of Munition to ſerue him, yet waiting mony to make paye, a man may ſay as Flaminius did by Philopomines, that he had the handes and legge of warre, but he wanted the belly.
               The Prince therfore that will leuie an Army, muſt learne with Theſeus not to enter the Labyrinthe without a Clue, he muſt be prouided with ſufficient Treaſure, for the want wherof many Armies haue bene forced to diſſolue.
            
            
               Skill.
               And there is no preparation exactly to be ſet downe what might ſuffice, for warres haue neyther ſtint nor ſet boundes.
            
            
               Pill.
               And the preparation is not ſo vncertaine, but it is as hard to be attained vnto, for though Arithmetick can quickly cypher downe a whole myllion of Treaſure, yet all the reſt of the Liberall Sciences are not ſo prodigall to bring it in together.
            
            
               Skill.
               And yet I thinke there is more diſorder in the iſſuing of the treaſure when it is prepared, then there is trauell in the aftaining to it, and that if there were a good order executed in the expending, neither the charge would be ſo great, nor the expences ſo burthenſome, as I know they haue beene.

               Captaine Skill, I am not ignorant what reportes haue gone, how Princes haue bene porloined by cheatting officers, but our diſcourſe is now of preparation, and by what meanes money might be prepared for the expence of warre.

               He that ſhould aduiſe theſe preſidents to be followed here in England, perhaps might offend more thē a good many, and yet me thinks there were ſome reaſon to induce, that thoſe that haue robbed others of theyr money by fra

                  ulent and deceitfull meanes, ſhould be vſed like Sponges, that when they haue drunke theyr fill, are then fit to be preſſed.
               But now whileſt I thinke of it, I will tell you what aduiſe a plaine country fellow did ſometimes giue to Gentleman of good ſorte, and one that had a great & a gainefull office fréely giuen him by a gratious Prince, which gentleman being appointed to borow mony for his Soueraigne vpon priuy ſeales, comming into a part of the country where the men of beſt abilitie in the ſhire (by a former appointment were repayred vnto him, to whom this gentleman in a briefe diſcourſe told them how many occaſions their Soueraigne had to imploy mony, and was therfore driuen ſo make bolde amongſt his good ſubiects to borow for a time till it might be repayed againe.
               One amongſt the reſt (being no leſſe plaine then wealthy) anſwered againe after this ſort, if not directly in the ſame maner, yet I am ſure not farre from the matter.
               I pray God bleſſe our Soueraigne (ſaid he,) and ſéeing

there is ſuch néede of money as your maiſterſhip hath ſpoken of: for my part I am not onely willing to lend this proportion that is demaunded, but if his Maieſtie would follow my further aduice, I could teach him ſuch a tricke, that he ſhould haue money comming in euery day, little or much, and it would come trowling in ſuch ſort, as I warrant there would not be ſo great neede to borrowe of ſubiects, as now of late time there hath beene.
               If you haue ſuch a tricke (anſwered the Gentleman) you might merit much; and there is no doubt, but it would be very grariouſly taken by your Soueraigne, in making it knowne.
               I can do it (ſaid the other) and I will tell you what it is: and if his Highneſſe could but make ſhift to buy your Maiſterſhips office, and thrée or foure others that I could name, and keepe them in his owne hands, your worſhip knowes he néeded to want no money, but it would ſtill be comming in, his cofers I warrant would neuer be emptie.
               The concluſion was, I thinke this honeſt meaning man had but ſmall thankes for his counſell, for thoſe were no times for men to ieſt with Officers.
            
            
               Skill.
               Beſides money, there are many other prouiſions to be cared for: as Armour, Weapon, Munition, and infinite of other furnitures, that are all to bee prouided afore hand.
               But the neceſſitie of victuall (in the time of ſeruice) are of no leſſe importance then the neceſſitie of money, without the meanes of which, there is neither meane to conquer, nor hope to liue.
               Ualiant mindes, wil oppoſe themſelues againſt the Pike, will aduenture vpon the Muſquet-ſhot, or runne vpon the Cannon, but I did neuer know any man ſo hardy, that would yeeld himſelfe to encounter with Famine.
               Where victuals therefore are not conueniently prouided for, the greateſt mindes are terrified and ouercome without ſtroke: and a hungry Army can neither obſerue Diſcipline, nor performe any great enterpriſe.

               I haue knowne eſpeciall ſeruices neglected, yea, and ouerthrowne, & but onely for this want of victuall, but I

will not ſpeake of particulars, becauſe in finding a fault, I know not whome I ſhould offend, whether thoſe of ſuperiour authoritie, that might haue commanded, or thoſe that were but inferiour Officers that ſhould haue prouided: but this is to be cōſidered, yt for the expeditiō of war, ſuch Cōmanders, & Officers ſhould be made choice of yt had iudgement aſwel to conſider of y• purſuit of an enterpriſe, as to looke into the beginning.

               But there is great error in Election, and it is committed in two maners, either thinking that he which is noble ſhuld likewiſe be vertuous, or for particular affection, perhaps in the behalfe of ſome one from whom the party would expect the like fauour againe: now if wars were to be waged againſt enemies, which would not take aduantage of errors and negligences, a Prince might chuſe more for fauour thē for néede.

               This election which you do here ſpeake of (as I perceiue) doth not ſo much concerne the ordinary Souldiour, as it doth reſpect the appointment of Generals, Captains, Cō
                  manders, and all other Offices that are to direct and mannage the warre, in whole worth and vertue it conſiſteth either to make the Souldier more or leſſe profitable for ſeruice, and it belongeth to their prouidence and care to make him able or diſable to ſerue.
            
            
               Skill.
               This well chuſing of Officers is the moſt eſpecial thing to be obſerued by thoſe that are deſirous to accompliſh by warre: Amongſt the reſt, the place of the Generall hauing the firſt ſuperioritie, if in his electiō there be not the like regard and circumſpection had to his ſkill and worthineſſe, there may be choſen an inſtrument of all diſorder, when by his vnſkilfulneſſe in martiall gouernment, there may ariſe ſo many euils, ſo many miſchiefs, deſtructions, and confuſions, as it may be called a much greater plague, then that which ariſeth by the moſt infected ayre.
            
            
               Pill.
               The olde prouerbe is, Such Carpenters, ſuch chips, ſuch Saints, ſuch Relikes: and I beléeue (indéed) where a Generall is choſen vnſkilfull, he lightly draweth about him Captaines and other Officers, as vnſkilfull as himſelfe, and then where the blind leades the blind, if they ſhould performe any great enterpriſe, it might well be regiſtred amongſt other miracles of wonder. But I will not take vpon me in this place, to ſay how many abuſes hath béene committed in the election of Captaines, and other Officers of the warre, I will leaue them till another occaſion, and will here firſt ſpeake of the choyce of the Generall himſelfe, on whoſe ſkill and worthines (immediatly after the permiſſion of God) the warre may bée ſaid to be happy, or infortunate.
               Since then the hope of winning or looſing doth ſo much depend in the Generall, by doing, or not doing his dutie, mée thinkes an Armie would bée much better mannaged

vnder the conduct of two or thrée Generalls, and the Prince might hope of better ſucceſſe in thoſe ſeruices where he had ſeuerall to commaund, and not to truſt ouermuch to one.
            
            
               Skill.
               I will alwaies preferre the gouernment of one, becauſe it is a gouernment moſt agréeable to nature: and if without preſumption we may compare ſmall marters with infinite, it is moſt agréeing to the example of the Almightie himſelfe, who being but one God alone, gouerneth and ruleth vniuerſally altogether: From hence it like wiſe ſéemeth meete, that the people of one Nation, ſhould bee gouerned by one Prince.
            
            
               Pill.
               But it happeneth many times, that in matters of doubt, there is not ſo much ſafetie in the opinion of one, as in the aduiſement of many, becauſe affection, or paſſion, either through anger, or through ſpight, or through luſt, or by ſome other turbulent occaſion, ſooner entereth into the minde of one alone, then into a multitude.
            
            
               Skill.
               But I ſay againe it is an eaſier matter to finde one alone to be good and wiſe, then to finde a great many: I could inferre preſidents, but by former experience it hath bene found, that it is better for thoſe that be good and honeſt, to liue vnder the gouernment of one Prince, though he ſhould be ſeuere and halfe a tyrant, then to liue in thoſe regiments where there are as many Kings, as there be Officers in authoritie: where there is more daunger in diſpleaſing of a great man, then there is ſafetie in ſeruing of a Soueraigne.
               Bleſſed ſay I, is that Regiment where the mightie oppreſſors are gouerned by one vertuous Prince, and not where the vertuous Prince is ouerruled by many great oppreſſors.
               And as there is nothing more noyſome ſo good ſubiects, then to haue many Kings in one dominion, ſo there is nothing more pernitious for a Prince, then to make ſeuerall Generals in one Army of equall principalitie: For where there are ſeuerall Commaunders of equall power and authoritie, if there be not contention for preheminence and ſuperioritie, yet bée

               The wings of true Nobility to make her flie high, are the déedes of Chiualry, and being inlightened by martiall ſkill, maketh her to ſhine more cléere and light.
               I know not any thing ſo certaine that carryeth with it a greater Maieſtie, then for Nobilitie to make noble defence againſt ſuch as compound the miſeries of Ciuill warres, and to be great leaders againſt forraine Inuaders.
            
            
               Pill.
               True Nobilite loueth glory, abiect Nobility loueth wealth: true Nobilitie ſcorneth that fortune that is vnaccompanied with Uertue, and ſeeketh out that danger which is attended by Honour: ſhe deſireth not to ſéeme but to be Noble, and rather to be a Lion amongſt Hartes, then to be a Hart amongſt Lions.
               Nobilitie conſiſteth not in titles borowed from our progenitors, but is extinguiſhed in him that onely hath wit to kéep mony, and no hart to win Honor: it is a title to a good man of great excellencie, but not to a wicked man of great infamie.
               To conclude, true Honour onely leaneth to this, to deſerue by noble deedes, to endeuour for her Countries good, to cheriſh the well deſeruing of the Ualiant, to baniſh Fooles and Flatterers, to liue an excellent life, and not to ſhame nor

ſhunne an honourable death.
            
            
               Skill.
               Then who ſo fit to commaund an Army, as he that is Noble? and the Art military is the principall profeſſion for Nobilitie: as for all other qualities, they are but as ornaments to garniſh the firſt: no not the ſtudie of Sciences and learning it ſelf, are but as complements to this glorious ſtudy of armes: As one demaunding of his friend whether he would rather wiſh to be Achylles or Homer, was anſwered; Tell me thou thy ſelfe whether thou wouldeſt rather to be a Captaine or a Trumpeter? but for him that is Noble, what tytle ſo honourable as to be called a great Souldier, vnleſſe we care not to ſhewe our ſelues like vnto thoſe that in learning will ſeeme to be men of warre amongſt the ignorant, but amongſt Souldiers, can but ſhewe themſelues to be learned.
            
            
               Pill.
               But where Nobilitie by her owne contemning this honorable profeſſion, haue thereby made her ſelfe vnable to command, is not he then to be reputed noble & honorable both, who for the good of his country refuſeth no danger, but is contented to hazard himſelf to the death, only to attain experience?
               What are we to looke after birth or parentage, when we ſee many times, perſons that are but of a baſe degree, to be yet inueſted with moſt high & noble gifts of Nature?
            
            
               Skill.
               Theſe are to be commended and ſo receiue their reward, but vnfitting yet to beare this rule of an abſolute Commander: for where Noblemen are inflamed with the deſire of glory and renowne, thoſe of meaner parentage do more deſire to exceed in wealth then in worſhip; for they haue neither true taſte nor feeling of honor & renowne, but are rather inclined to a couetous humor (which is the roote of all Impietie) and leadeth them many times to neglect goldē glory for gripple gain.
               Then who is ſo dull of vnderſtanding, but would be enflamed with the loue of Vertue, and would thinke himſelfe moſt happy & bleſſed, to be gouerned by the wiſdome & vertue of noble perſonages, whoſe deſire is to haue the rule & gouernment of others, only for this conſideration, that they might in their Office & gouernment, ſhew forth magnificent bountifulneſſe, & impact ſuch vertues vnto others, as with which their owne mindes are fraught & ſingularly furniſhed.

               But now it is to be vnderſtood, that euery ſtocke and lynage is ſet forth and beautifled by Vertue, and Vertue not beautified and ſet forth by lynage.
            
            
               Skill.
               Yet Nobleneſſe hath euer bene honored by all men, becauſe it ſtandeth with reaſon that good ſhould ſpring of good, and Vertue is moſt often ſucceeding in Noble blood: and the worthineſſe of honorable anceſtors craueth a reuerend regard to be had in their poſteritie, where he that is but of meane or ſimple parentage, muſt endure much to aduance his reputation, and cannot raiſe his eſtimation but with that tediouſneſſe of time, which the Noble by birth ſhall attaine vnto in a moment: and the innovle may be ſometimes inticed to Vertue, but not by the allurement of Vertue it ſelfe, but are rather prouoked vnto it by dread, or by compulſion, or ſometimes perhaps in hope of preferment: and where Vertue is thus darkened with a wauering hope & a faint courage, it is brought low, and but créepeth by the ground, where the vertue of true Nobleneſſe (indeed) being pure and vndefiled, doth ſwiftly raiſe it ſelfe on high, and doth with confidence mount vp to the higheſt heauens.
            
            
               Pill.
               I acknowledge that Nobilitie which as on a chiefe pillar is ſtaied vpon Vertue: but where that pillar of Vertue is ſhaken and ouerthrowne, there Nobilitie it ſelfe muſt likewiſe fall to the ground: And I do further truly confeſſe, that he can do nothing gallantly, valiantly, or forceably, whoſe minde is not kindeled and inflamed with honourable deſire.
               Thus giuing Nobilitie her due, I preferre the Noble to be moſt worthy of this great commaund, knowing that the bare tytle is more effectuall to draw a reuerent regard, and to enforce a more dutifull obedience in an Army, then the largeſt Commiſſion. A Prince may deuiſe to graunt to him that is but newly crept vp from a meane reputation or a ſlender account: And becauſe I haue here ſpoken of a Commiſſion, here now ariſeth a doubt, whether it be behouefull for a Prince, for the benefit of his owne ſeruice, to preſcribe a Commiſſion to his Lieutenant or Generall, ſo tying him within certaine limits, that he may not paſſe the bounds of his commandment, whatſoeuer occaſion might be taken for the benefit of ſeruice.
            
            
               
               Skill.
               For the anſwere of this doubt, it is firſt to be conſidered, that when a Prince will bridle his Generall by ſuch a-Commiſſion, it is neceſſary that he furniſh him with all maner of prouiſions ſo aboundantly that he ſhall not want: for otherwiſe, what ſeruice is to be expected where they are firſt pinched in theyr prouiſions, and after bound ſo faſt by their Commiſſions, that they ſhall not be able to helpe themſelues?
               Next, it is as behoouefull for that Prince that will tye his Generall to ſtraight limits, that he doo likewiſe very circumſpectly inſtruct and direct him in thoſe ſeruices he hath to performe, which is almoſt impoſſible for him to doo: for how ſhould men that are ignorant themſelues in the affaires of warre, preſcribe their Generalls what they ſhould do, or what they ſhould not doo? or how ſhould thoſe that are abſent, giue preſcriptions to him that is and muſt be in preſent view, and not bereaue him of thoſe aduantages that the varietie of times and occaſions may offer?
               Some Princes and States that haue bene ſuſpitious of their Captaines, haue brideled them by ſtraight Commiſſions, other ſome againe, that hauing had reſpect to the dangers of times, yet foreſeeing the inconueniences that might enſue by ouermuch pairing their Generalls authoritie, haue in theyr Commiſſions left this (proviſo) That they ſhould proceede according to the variety of time and occaſions, notwithſtanding any reſtraint in them contained.
               
            
            
               Pill.
               But whether a Generall that is thus tyed, may not ſometime vſe his owne diſcretion vpon occaſion, as opportunitie may offer?
            
            
               Skill.
               The ſeueritie of Manlius Torquatus might ſuffice to diſcourage any man to ſtand in this conceit, who ſpared not the life of his own ſonne, but for fighting with an enemie contrary to his commandment, notwithſtanding he obtained the victorie.
               But the Almighty himſelfe preferreth obedience to be better then ſacrifice, and it is more fit by executing the commandement of a Prince to ſhew obedience, then by exceeding their bounds to ſhew contempt.
               
                  
For this cauſe the Souldier was worthily commended, who hauing already aduanced his weapon to haue taken the life of an enemie, that was vnder his mercy, whileſt his arme was yet lifted vp to haue giuen the deadly ſtroke, the Trumpet ſounded a retraite, wherewith the Souldier ſtaying his blowe, let his enemie thus eſcape: this being eſpied, it was demaunded of him, why he let ſlip ſo great an aduantage; he anſwered, I bolde it farre more honourable to obey my Captaine, then to kill mine enemy.

               He that had a compleate Army of ſuch Souldiers, might worke wonders: but ſome wil ſay, that when occaſion is offered to a Generall for the benefit of his Prince, he ought not ſo

                  icely to ſtand vpon the preſcript of his Commiſſion, as to neglect the benefit and fortune preſented vnto him, when there is no Prince ſo prouident who is able to foreſee euery accident that may happen: he is therefore to be reputed neither for wiſe nor valiant, that wil ſtand ſo much vpon his Commiſſion as to neglect any occaſion that may bring aduancement to the honour and profit of his maiſter.
            
            
               Skill.
               It is a daungerous thing for him that ſhall ſwarue from the Commaundement of a Prince, truſting more to his owne iudgement, then in his whom of reaſon he ought to obey, becauſe if his imagination do faile him, and his enterpriſe conclude but with ill ſucceſſe, he runneth into the penaltie of diſobedience, without any hope of excuſe or pardon.
               But admit that his purpoſe be well effected, and brought to a good paſſe according to his deſire, he may then thanke his fortune more then his wit, and this is all that he hath to truſt vnto.
               The Romanes in the prime of their greatnes, were not only ſtrict in puniſhing theſe offences, but they were as ſeuere to puniſh with ſhame and ignomy, their Generalls and principall Commaunders (without any reſpect of their greatnes) that by ſhamefull practiſes had ſought to vanquiſh and by diſhonourable meanes had obtained victories vpon their enemies: neither could I

               I hope our honeſt meaning will not be imputed to preſumption, and I haue the rather aduentured the matter vpon this occaſion, the mittigation of warre now hoped for, and a bleſſed peace expected, by a moſt gracious and happie gouernment, hath giuen Souldiers a time of truce, that they may lay by their Armes, and indeuour to what their wits in any other commendable exerciſe: And we may a little take this aduantage in our diſcourſe, and not ſo to tye our ſelues to martial matter, but that vpon occaſion we may a little digreſſe, like a cunning gameſter when he is at Hazard, will ſometimes leaue the Maine to play vpon the Bye: And I would not be thought to be of ſo furious a humor as y• firy ſpirited Gentleman Soldier, that hitting amongſt pleaſant company, was requeſted by a Gentlewoman to dance, but he with a diſdainfull looke, tolde her that he tooke no pleaſure in ſo vaine delights: the Gentlewoman requeſted him againe, to ſay wherein his pleaſure did eſpecially conſiſt, and hée bending his browes and looking with a ſt
                     •
                  rne countenance, tolde her his felicitie was,

                  Armed in the field to encounter his enemies. The Gentlewoman ſmiling at the folly of our vaine-glorious Martialiſt, made this anſwere. Now God be thanked there is yet no néed of your ſeruice, for our turritories and confines are happily bleſſed with peace, and therefore I could wiſh that you were wel beſmeared ouer with oyle, and ſo hanged vp in ſome faire Armory till we haue néed of your helpe: for it were great pittie that a man of your courage ſhould be cankered and eaten with ruſt now in this peaceable time.
               I would be ſory to receiue ſuch a frump, neither wil I ſtand ſo much vpon my martiall points, as though I could do nothing but ſpeake of fighting of fields.
               I wil therfore ſpeak or do anything as occaſion ſhall ſerue: in the time of warre, I can liſten to the Drum, but in the time of Peace, a Tabret and a Pipe are merry about a May-Pole: and although I be ill made to daunce, yet I wil rumble on amongſt the reſt, I had rather they ſhould finde fault with my cunning, then to repute me to be diſdainfull.
               And now we haue taken this little breath, let vs (in Gods name) martch backe againe to the Campe from whence we came, where we haue left our Generall not ſo fully complete as is requiſite: for it is not enough for him that ſhal command an Army to be nobly borne, but he muſt be likewiſe fortified with thoſe gifts that are no leſſe to be attained vnto by education as by nature. And as I remember, Cato preſcribeth thrée ſpecial vertues to be had in a Generall, that is to ſay, Experience, Policie, and Valiance: and the Antiquitie would neuer admit of him for a Commander, that was either inſufficient in ſkil, or openly detected of vice.
               Swearing bréedeth hatefulneſſe to all honeſt eares, Couetouſneſſe extorteth both of Prince and Souldier, Pride bringeth with it diſdain: and Cato being Cenſurer to make choice of a Generall in the Panonian warres, openly diſgraced and diſmiſſed Publius, becauſe he had ſéene him walke the ſtréetes of Rome perfumed.
            
            
               Skill.
               To this Experience, Policie & Valiance preſcribed by Cato, we wil adde two others, namely, Iuſtice & Mercy.
               
               
                  
Amongſt the reſt, Iuſtice is the foremoſt and firſt to be preferred, for it is the foundation of Eternall Fame, without the which there is nothing can deſerue to be praiſed or commended: and Iuſtice in a Generall towards his Souldiers, is the key of his Diſcipline, the enterance to confirme their loue that ſerue him, and a curbe to reſtraine their miſdemeanures that would offend him.
               Againe, the force of commaunding is the conſent of them that obey: and this conſent ſpringeth by eſtimation, ſhe which by no one meane is more exactly ſquared out then by the execution of Iuſtice: for when the Souldier ſhall perceiue that he ſhall be ſuffered neither to do nor take wrong, it ſo confirmeth him with ſuch feare and loue towards his Commaunder, that he wil refuſe no enterpriſe though he ſhould be willed (as Scipio ſaide) to caſt himſelfe headlong from the height of a Rocke.
            
            
               Pill.
               Iuſtice hath bene reputed to be the Twin-ſiſter of Mercy, and to vſe too much ſeueritie, is not the readieſt way to winne, eſpecially amongſt Souldiers.
            
            
               Skill.
               An vncontrowled Army, that is not curbed & mannaged by Iuſtice, is like a brain-ſicke Iade without a bridle, more noyſome and corrupt then is a body without a ſoule: but yet to holde a meane, is the ſalte and ſoule of euery vertue: neither is there any thing more nigher to Iniuſtice then is the aſperite and rygor of Iuſtice.
               The warres are therefore to be proſecuted with as great Iuſtice as ſtrength, and as the Iuſtice of the cauſe is firſt to be approued, ſo with like equitie and right, the warres muſt be maintained.
               A righteous and a iuſt cauſe addeth encreaſe of courage, it inciteth to Valiance, and it doth ſo concytate and ſtrengthen the mindes of men, that they may aduenture their lines with the greater boldneſſe, when they know that whether they liue or dye, they may do both in the ſeruice and feare of God.
            
            
               Pill.
               And is not this obſeruation of Iuſtice as well to be kept with enemies, againſt whome we are Armed, and haue entered hoſtilitie, as with adherents and friends, whom we may commaund and ouerrule?
            
            
               
               Skill.
               The example vſed by Camillus vpon the Schoole-maiſter may ſuffice for the matter, that was more effectuall to ſubdue the Phalatians, then was the might or force of the Romane Armie, neither was there any thing that made the Romane Common-wealth, ſo glorious and triumphant, as theſe vertues of Iuſtice, Clemency and Loyalty, which they alwaies vſed to their very enemies.
            
            
               Pill.
               The warres then were performed with as great honour as they are now with trechery, and the Campe might then haue bene reputed for a Schoole of honour, iuſtice, obedience, dutie, and loyaltie: but now it is become a denne of deceit, trechery, robbery, blaſphemy, & all maner of other impiety.
               And as this obſeruation of Iuſtice is of great excellencie, and is a bleſſing powred downe from the heauens, ſo the effect of it, is but in maintaining of right, and doing no wrong: A leſſon of no great importance to be learned and carried away, though not ſo eaſily kept. But now for this Militarie Experience, that is behoouefull for a Generall or Captaine, how is this to be attained vnto? for this is not to be learned by precepts, but it is to be taught by time, not to be comprehended but by continuall practiſe, it is bought with gray haires, grieuous woundes, and great daungers: If I be not therefore deceiued, he that ſhould commaund, ſhould firſt learne to obey, and he ought to be a man of tride and knowne Experience, that ſhould haue ſo many mens liues depending on his ſkill.
            
            
               Skill.
               There is no occupation, be it neuer ſo ſimple, neither is there any profeſſion, how ſlender ſo euer in account, but it craueth both practiſe and Experience, and at the leaſt a full apprentyſhip of ſeuen yeres, before a man may be thought worthy to be imployed in his Facultie. If then in theſe meane and pettie cauſes, the attainment of ſkill is not to be apprehended, but by ſuch continuance of time and practiſe, how many yeares were then behoouefull, or what proceſſe of time might be thought ſufficient, for him that ſhould be perfected in martiall Experience in the knowledge whereof, there was neuer any man yet ſo complete and exact, but he was ſtill euery day to learne: yea, though he had ſerued full out ſeuen aprentizeſhips.
               
                  
Onely the knowledge of the Art Military, ſhe older it is worne out with yeares, the yonger it waxeth, and the farther off to be attained and comprehended.
               The want then of this Experience, bréedeth the want of courage, when the ſuddainneſſe of peril is more terrible then the daunger it ſelfe, and by how much it happeneth to a multitude, by ſo much the matter ſeemes more deſperate: for when their mindes are once poſſeſſed with feare, there is no place left for confidence, but turning all their hopes into doubtes, they ſurrender themſelues without conſideration, not whither aduiſe and counſaile ſhould direct them, but whither their diſtracted fortunes wil conduct them.
               Thus Ignorance begetteth feare, feare engendreth doubt, doubt leadeth to deſperation, and deſperation bringeth to deſtruction.
               But it is Experience that confirmeth mens minds in the vertue of Valiance, maketh them to be reſolute, and truly magnanimious.
               Occaſions themſelues do rather giue counſalles to men, then men to occaſiōs, when occaſions many times wil affoord more helpe in warre, then Uertue, but it is Experience that muſt take opportunitie when occaſion doth offer.
               And Reaſon it ſelfe muſt many times giue place to neceſſitie (eſpecially in matters of warre) in that it ſeldome ſuffereth a man to make choyce of time: Againe, the fitneſſe of place is to be conſidered, which many times yéeldeth more aduantage then the vertue of Force, but ſtil it is Experience that muſt diſcerne of altogether.
               So that we may wel conclude Experience to be the firſt, the ſecond, and the third meane whereby to obtaine in warre.
            
            
               Pill.
               O how many Turft-Taffita Captaines haue we in theſe dayes, that perhaps haue made a Caales Voyage, or haue bene a moneth or two in the lowe Countries, or in Ireland, or haue had the conducting of Souldiers to the waters ſide, or hath bene a trainer or a Muſter-maiſter (as they call him) in the ſhire: yet if they had but learned to double their ranckes on the right hand, and ſometimes to runne away on

the left, and can ſpeake a little of the newe Diſcipline, they will diſcourſe of greater exploytes then euer was performed before Troy.
               
               They will ſpeake of conducting of Armies: howe to imbattell them, when to ſhake off ſkirmiſhe, howe to fight with aduantage, where to imploye horſe-men, when the ſhotte ſhall giue theire vollyes, how to incounter with the puſh at the pike, when it is time to charge, when to retyre: you ſhall heare them fight a field and giue an ouer-throwe, and all by imagination.
               You ſhall heare thoſe ſometimes that will ingroſſe the actions of a whole Armie, and will attribute ſo much to their owne value, that it were a hard matter to beléeue them without a ſtedfaſt faith.
               With theſe toyes they haue deceiued men of reaſonable wit, though of little vnderſtandng: and ſometimes when they haue hit into the preſence of ſome Nobleman that was ignorant of martial matters, they haue ſo amazed his ſences with theſe errogating erplycations, that his ſuper excéeding courage, ſhall not onely be admyred and wondred at, but his martiall ſkill and Experience, ſhall be ratified and commended by Nobility it ſelfe.
               It is enough for him that can but robbe a printed cloath of a hiſtorie, a booke of a diſcourſe, a foole of a faſhion, if bée can ſweare Sblood and Sownes, take a pipe of Tabacco, and bring my Ladies letter to my Lord, it is Experience enough, and he ſhall be prefererd before another that hath ſerued twenty yeares in the Campe.
            
            
               Skill.
               God bleſſe me, my Countrey and friendes, from his direction that hath no better Experience then what hée hath atteyned vnto at the fetching home of a Maye-pole, at a Midſomer ſighte, or from a trayning at Mi
                        •
                     ende-Greene: neither is it a Ladies letter, nor a Noble mans fauoure, nor at the leaſt, thrée or foure yeares trayning, that can make a man fit to commande in a well gouerned warre.
            
            
               
               Pill.
               How ſhould we now diſtinwiſh of that honeſtie which is perſect and abſolute (indeed) from that falſe and pretended colour of honeſtic, that is but counterfe it and falſly ſurmiſed, or of that policy, that ſhould be an ornament of honour to a Captaine or General worthilie renowned, from that craft & ſubtiltie that is now ſhrowded & cleaked vnder the titles of wit or policie, which are no other then fraud and deceipt? and then if Plutarche ſpeaketh true, there is no fraude without iniurie.
            
            
               Skill.
               I commend policie ſo it be legitimate, firſt begotten by wit, and foſtered vp by honeſtie? and there is a certaine honeſt ſobtilty which paſſeth vnder the name of policy, as to make attempt againſt a common enemie, a robber, a ſpoiler, a rebel, a traitor, in ſuch a caſe it importeth nothing in reſpect of Iuſtice, whether he be aſſailed openly or intrapped by ambuſh, or by any other practiſe wherein faith and honour may bee preferued, and Iuſtice nothing violated: this policie hath beene of great commaunde amongſt Souldiers, and good reaſon too, when in the action of warre, it is vtter for the field then Force.
            
            
               Pill.
               Policie without ſorce, is like a workman without ſooles.
            
            
               Skill.
               And ſorce without conduct and ſtill, may well charge an enemie, but ſridome win honour.
               I know Force to be requiſite, but where it beares more ſwie then vnderſtanding, it runnes to confuſion, and to deſtruction in the end.
               Force that is not aſſiſted by aduice, is like a horſe withotout a rider, of it oſone ſelfe, it deſtroicih it ſelfe▪ and Force and furie, without Diſcipline & Order, are caūly vanquiſhed and ouerthrowne by Policie.
               The ſtrength of vnderſtanding is therefore more availcable in the day of battell, then is the ſtrength of vnſkilfull men, and more fields haue bene loſe for want of pollicie, then for want of ſtrength: for where force ſtrueth for execution, policie is he that prepareth the meane.
               To daunte an enemie by Force is the Souldiers praiſe,

but to intrap him by policie is the Captaines honour: & more glory for a Captaine to be ſeared of a wiſe enemie for his policie, then to be praifed by a fooliſh Citizen, rather for the forces that follow him then for any wit in his head.
            
            
               Skill.
               Beſides Stragemus that are euerie dap inauated and deuiſed as occaſions doe ariſe, ſo there are manie preceptes politiquely preſcribed, that me thinkes in this place wouldr partlie bee remembred, becauſe they are behoueful for cuerie Captaine to obſerue: amongſt the reſt, whether it may ſtande with policie, that thoſe enterpriſes vndertaken with indiſcretion, or againſt reaſon, ſhould eſcape vnreprooued, though they conclude with ſome good or lucky ſucceſſe.
            
            
               Skill.
               Reaſon veholdeth ſome purpoſed ende, whether it directeth euerie action, and hee that vndertaketh with Iudgement and diſcret on, if bee bring his affaires to a good and happie ſucceſſe, it will be imputed to his vertue: but if to any ill iſſue, it will be attributed to the malice of his fortune: and the antiquitie puniſhed nothing with more ſeueritie, then thoſe enterpriſes attempted againſt commaundement, or vndertaken againſte Reaſon: but as they puniſhed thoſe victories that were attained by lewde and fooliſh hardineſſe, ſo miſfortune diminiſhed not his reputation, that attempted with diſcretion, neither attributing coboardlineſſe to ill ſucceſſe, nor Maliance to good fortune.
            
            
               Pill.
               A Captaine then ought warilie to examine the ende of his driſtes, before he giues them courſe, for he that enterpriſeth raſhlie not conſidering of the iſſue, ſhal repent him of his rollie when it is paſt remedie.
            
            
               Skill.
               When a Captaine hath to deale with an enemie, whom he knoweth

ſo long it may be beléeued, there is nothing dene extraordinarliy, otherwiſe then with a due courſe, according to Iudgemēt and martiall ſkill, but when attempts are made as it were againſt the haire, and enterpriſes put in practiſe, that are deuoid of Reaſon: A wiſe Commaunder in thoſe caſes ought to be the more vigilent and wary, and to thinke that ſuch offers are neuer made, but vpon ſome hidden purpoſe.
            
            
               Pill.
               To be ouerlight of beliefe, argueth a lightneſſe of wit, and thoſe that are ouermuch creailous, may be reputed to be men of the firſt Impreſſion: to make account of an enemy ſo farre forth as is néedefull, is the part of a wiſe Captaine, but ſo to feare him, as to be afraid to encounter him, argueth the want of Courage, and there is no greater ſigne to looſe, then when a man is perſwaded, not to be able to win.
            
            
               Skil.
               To make ſmall account of an enemy, is a daungerous matter, and many honourable enterpriſes hath béene entercepted, where an enemie hath beene thought ſo féeble and weake, that they haue rather deſpiſed him, then made any account of ought he could do: but a wiſe Captaine will neuer ſo lightly regard an enemy, for if he be olde, his wiſedome and Experience is to be feared, but if he be rong, and therewithall either heady or raſh beware of his fortune, for according to the olde prouerbe, Fortune doth not onely fauour Fooles, but is likewiſe helping to thoſe that bee bolde and hardy.
               
               And in daungers where there be many eyes to beholde, you ſhall ſée ſome whoſe hearts are already almoſt dead, yet pricked with ſhame, or intiſed onely by company, they will goe forwardes (as it were) blindfold, and do their dutie.
            
            
               Pill.
               
                  Machiuill thinketh it no policie for a Prince to be aduiſed in his martiall cauſes, by ſuch a Councell as are altogether addicted to warre, or too much inclined to peace, but miſerable is that warre, ſay I, where Couetouſneſſe doth either commaund or giue counſell, or hath any intereſt at all either with Officer or Souldier.
            
            
               Skill.
               There is nothing more rather to ouerthrowe an Army, then where the Captaine or Souldier are more deſtrous

ofſpoyle, then careful of honour: And couetouſneſſe is the cauſe of many great euilles, for as it hindereth victory before the fight, ſo againe after the fight it plucketh the glory of an ouerthrow out of the victors hands, making him of a Conqueror, to become conquered.
            
            
               Pill.
               There is not a more pernitious euill, then that of Couetouſneſſe: and a couetous wretch, as well in the time of peace, as in the time of warre, is deteſted and abhorred, and by how much he is aduanced to greatneſſe, either by his owne wealth, or by authoritie, by ſo much the more hee is curſed by the people, and vengeance daily denounced againſt him, by as many as hath to deale with him.
            
            
               Skill.
               Conetouſneſſe is the Curre that deuoureth his owne Acteon, the Ball of Hipomines, to hinder the courſe of Atlanta, the Charibdis that ſwalloweth vp al honeſt meanes whereby the multitude ſhould maintaine life: The Scraping Brier that ſcratcheth the wooll from the ſilly Shéepe, when it commeth but to ſeeke ſhelter, the Canker that fretteth the Common-wealth, eating and deuouring the gettings of the poore.
               It is Couetouſneſſe that poiſoneth the eares of Princes, and teacheth them to neglect and ſet aſide all iuſt and honourable dealing: It is Couetouſneſſe that holdeth nothing vnlawfull that bringeth in gaine: It is Couetouſneſſe that maketh no conſcience in gathering of Golde, nor in ſpilling of bloud.
            
            
               Pill.
               It is Couetouſneſſe, that was neuer cheriſhed by vertue, nor beloued of God, and as Couetouſneſſe is a moſt hatefull vice in him that ſhould commaund an Army, ſo I cannot admit of him, that from a bare and néedie eſtate ſhould be aduanced to that dignitie of a Generall, becauſe his pouertie would be a ſpurre to pricke him forwardes to exact from thoſe, that Nobilitie inueſted with Honour, would otherwiſe cheriſh and maintaine, though to his owne expence.

               Here is yet to bée remembred, how much digreſſing

               And no leſſe daungerous againe to be ſerued by Souldiers, that are to encounter with an enemie, who is like wiſe ſerued with Souldiers of the ſame Nation, conſidering how hard a matter it is to bring Souldiers of one Nation, ſo any incounter, the one againſt the other.

               We ſhould not neede to looke out farre for preſidents, for he that hath beene well acquainted with the ſeruices of Ireland, will quickly ſet downe, probatum eſt.

               And it is ſtrange to ſee how many water-caſting Phiſitians hath taken vpon them to looke into the diſeaſed eſtate of that Realme of Ireland, and how they haue pretendes not onely to knowe the nature of the ſickneſſe it ſelfe, that doth oppreſſe it but alſo from whence the cauſe hath had proceeding, and how it might be cured.

               But this is more ſtrange then all the reſt, that there ſhould be any hope at all to reforme a people, that from their verie infancy haue beene trayned vp vnder Schoole-maiſters, who not only inſtructed and

               This hath béene the vſe of Ireland in times paſt, and I am ſure hath béene as conuerſant and generall throughout the whole Realme, as there were either Schoole-maſters to teach, or Schollers to be taught.

               The caſe is altered howſoeuer it happeneth, and it ſhould ſéeme that either the Iriſh are become more hardie, or we haue

loſt our wonted Courage, for nowe of late wée haue béene driuen to imploye farre greater numbers, and all little enough ſo farre as I can perceiue, and ſometimes with the leaſte to performe but what were requiſite.

               It would ſéeme that our progenatours many yeares agoe, ſtood in ſome feare of that which is now come to paſſe, and knowing the inclinatiō of the Iriſh, how readie they were to runne into rebellion, and how deſirous to ſhake off the Engliſh gouernment, to preuent thoſe meanes that might further their rebellious pretences, they eſtabliſhed certain decrées, cō
                  ming them by act of Parliament, amongſt manie other that were inſtituted for that purpoſe, it was ordeined that no man of the Iriſh birth ſhould haue charge or cuſtodie of anie Caſtle or place fortefied belonging to the Prince: nor that anie Captaine ſhould reteine aboue thrée Iriſh men at the moſt in his companie of one hundred and theſe to be admitted but as ſptes or guides to paſſe through the countrey.
               There were manie other lawes made, prohibiting the Iriſh from certaine principall offices, and in like maner prohibiting the Engliſh from marrying feſtering & combining with the Iriſh.
               Whilſt theſe prohibitions were carefully obſerued in the countrie, they were not able to raiſe anie great rebellion, but that might haue bene ſuppreſſed with a ſmall number of men, and with no great charge to the Prince.
               But after theſe good conſtitutions were neglected, and that euerie Captaine was at libertie to reteine as he liſted, and for his owne gaine to conuert his companie that ſhould haue bene all Engliſh into three parts and more of the Iriſh, and when whole companies of the Iriſh were erected, I will not ſay the meſt of them ſent from the rebels themſelues, but of purpoſe to betray, but by this meanes the whole rable of raſcals were armed, trained, diſciplined, and made apt and fit for any rebellion: and by theſe meanes the number of the rebels dailie increaſed, that were ſtill armed and weaponed at the Princes charge.
               
                  
I wil not ſpeake of the ſeueral reaſons and practiſes frō time to time by them performed, but this is not to be forgotten, that the Iriſh themſelues finding how ſlily they had deceiued vs in hoping of any aſſiſtance in their ſeruice, would merily demaund, When it was euer heard on, that one Wolfe would pray vpon another.

               Will you giue me leaue Captaine Skill, but to deliuer a matter of my knowledge?
               There is an olde Iriſh practiſe, that ſince I haue known Ireland, hath coſt our late gracious Quéene more money then would well haue ſerued to haue conquered three Irelands: and this ariſeth likewiſe by the ouermuch truſt and confidence that is had in the Iriſh: and it is the ſhoote Anker that they all truſt vnto, for when all hopes do faile them, this they are ſure will neuer deceiue.
               The matter is, when they haue plaid the fraitors, and haue ſtood out in open rebellion, and that they haue beene purſued with great expence of treaſure, and haue béene brought (as it were) to the laſt gaſpe, not longer able to endure, then to take breath, and to ſupply themſelues againe with their further practiſes they pretend humilitie, and they will make choyce of ſome ſpeciall man ſometimes perhaps of ſome great Councellor of that Realme, or of ſome other great Commaunder of that part of the countrey, where themſelues are abiding: but ſuch a one they will ſtill make choyce on, as they will bée ſure ſhall be well be friended, as well at the Councell Table of Ireland, as otherwiſe in the Court of England: To him they will pretend great ſubmiſſion.
               They will deſire him to be a meane for a pardon, they will make great offers and proteſtations of their future fidelitie, they will ſay they will deſerue, and they will put in pledges for ſecuritie: perhaps they will giue their Procurador, a ſcore of Beeues, or a brace of faire Horſe.
               This Councellor, or Commaunder, or whoſoeuer looking into his owne lands, & ſeeing them euery day waſted (or at the leaſt in danger to be ſpoiled) by this traitor y• now eraueth his aſſiſtāce, is glad to imbrace his frēdſhip, together with his ſute,

and howſoeuer he thinketh the Rebell wil holde promiſe with the Prince, he is ſure in the meane time his tenants and himſelfe ſhal be ſpared from ſpoile.
               Héere he calleth to minde againe how acceptable a péece of ſeruice it is accounted to bring in a Traytor, how much it will redounde to his reputation, when it ſhal be reported what a notable rebell hee hath brought in, how highlie it ſhall aduance his credit, and how his friends in the Courte of England ſhall reioyce and glorifie his ſeruice, con mending it to the eares of his Soueraigne Prince, whome they haue made beleeue what a ſparing it ſhoulde bee as well of monie as of manie mens liues, that the Traytor ſhoulde thus be receiued to giue the matter the better grace, they wil tell what wonderful ſeruice by his meanes might after bee performed, and how manye ill diſpoſed perſons will bee diſmaied and terrifyed vpon his comming in.
               There is no opportunitie left, nor no labour be ſpared till a pardon be purchaſed, which being once attained, the Traitor is brought in, and where in his action of rebellion, he was able to furniſh the field, with foure hundred, ſix hundred, or a thouſand traitors, he is not now able to ſerue his Prince with ſix true men: but he ſerueth his purpoſe, and watching his time, goeth out againe, and wil after be thrée times more chargeable then he was before.

               By this I perceiue, it is better for wayfaring men to to tread thoſe tracts alreadie troden out to their hands, then to ſéeke vnknowne waies, that may perhaps ſometime lead them

aſtray, or at the leaſt, lead them the fartheſt way about: for if thoſe preſidents by you rehearſed, left by predeceſſours, had bene as carefully obſerued, as they were wiſely preſcribed, the rebellious ſort of the Iriſh, had not bene ſo wel inabled to haue maintained their rebellions: and now I ſee how that which was attributed to the execeding wiſdome, policy, & valiance of the Iriſh, might rather be imputed to our ouerſight, when they ſtrengthened themſelues rather by our

               For the wiſdome and policy that hath bene noted in the Iriſh I muſt not ſpeake of, & the beſt commendations that I can giue is this: they haue bene beholding to their Engliſh friends, it is not the Iriſh, but the Engliſh with the Iriſh hearts that hath vndone Ireland: let the reſt paſſe, and let vs render him his due that hath merited more honour than my pen can expreſſe: the noble Earle, the now Lord-lieutenant of Ireland, whoſe wiſdome ioyned with magnanimitie, hath not onely repulſed the Spaniard, and freed that eſtate from Spaniſh practiſes, but hath likewiſe ſo qualified & quieted the deſperate condition of that decaied Common-wealth (almoſt paſt hope of recouerie, that he hath thereby aduanced his honour to poſteritie, in farre greater meaſure then I am able to ſet downe: I can therefore but wiſhe all happineſſe to himſelfe, and good ſucceſſe to his honourable procéedings.
               And now to ſpeake a little of that Ualiance ſo imputed to the Iriſh, when doe they ſhew it, or where doe they performe it but in a Bogge: in a pace, or in ſome other ground of aduantage, where they are ſure our horſemen ſhal neither charge nor chace them, and where, if our footmen doe preſſe them with good conduct, they can retire themſelues by their faſt footemanſhip without any danger.
               This is it that maketh them hardy, but vppon an equall ground that yeeldeth no other aduantage then the vertue and valiance of him that doth commaunde, and where horſemen and footemen may doe their indeuors and be brought to ſerue, the Iriſh are as timerous as any other nation: neither is there

a people in any place where I haue bene, that will ſooner truſt to their héeles then they.

               It may be the Iriſh are the more ready to runne, knowing their owne dexteritie and abilitie to performe it: but let vs leaue Ireland, and ſpeake of Valiance truly what it is, as we haue alreadie done with Iuſtice, Experience, and Policie, and how it is or may bée behouefull for a Generall or Captaine.
            
            
               Skill.
               
                  Valiance is a vertue without the which our liues are of ſmall value, but the ſame being deſtitute of Iuſtice, is hurtfull to the good: If Temperance doe not moderate hir, ſhe will turne into rage, and being not guided by Experience and Skill, wil labour out of reaſon.

               Some will not hold him to be Valiant, that is not too venterous, and they wil account of him to be but a daſtard, that is not deſperate.
            
            
               Skil.
               True Valiance (indéed) is many times counterſeited, ſometimes for feare of puniſhment, ſometimes vpon wrath, ſometimes vpon ignorance not foreſeing pertill, wil runne on as a blind man in a daungerous paſſage.
               
                  Ariſtotle would in no wiſe admit that Diomides ſhould be accounted either Valiant or wiſe, for that when the Crakes were put to flight, he remained alone, and aduentured himſelfe againſt the Force of Hector, which he did rather to ſake the vaine praiſe of the people, becauſe he would not be accounted a runne away, then for the true and ſoueraigne good, wherein conſiſteth the end of vertue.
               The like hée iudged of Hector himſelfe, who many times beholding his wife and other women vppon the walles of Troy, would more boldly and couragiouſly aduenture himſelfe, rather fearing ſome brute thoſe women might haue raiſed ſounding to his diſhonour, then otherwiſe he did reſpect the Iuſtice of his cauſe, or the generall good of the City ſo diſtreſſed by the Gréekes.
               Héere is now a matter worthy the noting, that Ariſtotle being but a Heathen, would not admitte of this vaine oftentation, and as he had not the true knowledge of God, ſo

he could not looke into the ſoueraigntie of vertue with a right reſpect: for thoſe great Philoſophers, that were accounted the wiſe men of the worlde, who onely but for the winde of the world, could deſpiſe and contemne the vanities of the worlde, they that could weepe when they were borne laugh when they ti

                  d, and all that they might appeare to be conſtant, but to whom, euen to this vnconſtant world.
               Now for thoſe that are better inſtructed in the knowledge of God, they are to aime their actions at an other mark, they muſt looke after the ſubſtance & not after the ſhadow, they may wel conſider that true chriſtian valiance neuer oppoſeth it ſelf without the feare of God, it neuer fighteth for vaine glory, nor greedie deſire, but for equity and iuſtice, & for the cōmon & generall good: it neuer aduentureth raſhly or vnaduiſedly againſt reaſō, but with iudgement & deepe foreſight; for courage without conſcience, is like the Phariſes faſt, and he that wil fight deſperatly without Experience, may wel be called an angrie foole, but neuer a valiant foole.

               I neuer heard a foole reputed to be valiant, & yet I haue knowne ſome not greatly ouerburthened with wit, that were raſh & hardy enough: but I perceiue ye euerie bold bayard is not valiant, & how that courage which is forward to danger without iudgement, may rather beare the name of lewd hardines, then of manlineſſe.

                  Plutarche maketh the diſtinction, for he ſaieth, that all valiant men are hardie, but all hardie men are not valiant, as thoſe that wil oppoſe themſelues into perill, ſometimes without iudgement.
               To conclude, he cannot be ſaid to be Valiaunt, that is not ſtrengthened by the goodneſſe of this cauſe, and fortified againe by his owne ſkill and knowledge: but he that is thus armed, he ſheweth himſelfe reſolute, and without feare in the middeſt of the greateſt perriles: yea in the verie daunger of death it ſelfe: and although he be at any time oppreſſed with an impoſſibility of bring victorious, yet to ſhunne and eſchew deſperation, he betaketh himſelf to patience, which ſo mightily defendeth him, yt with great difficultie he may be ouercōe, but neuer cōquered.

               Patience is but a drie plaiſter, but it is a tried medicine, for it armeth men to the proofe againſt al the aſſaults of Fortune: and I thinke that courage which at the point of death it ſelfe, ſheweth no diſcontentment, nor ſigne, nor ſhewe of griefe, may well be imputed to conſtancy, and why not to Valiance?
            
            
               Skill.
               Thoſe whome Fortune hath throwne downe, being ſpoyled and bereaued of ſolace and contentment, if in extreame deſperation they make light account of death, there is in them yet a certaine aſſurance of daſtardly Cowardiſe, becauſe they haſten their dying day, not ſo much for ſhewing their Conſtancy, as for auoyding of miſerie, as may thus bee expreſſed.
               
                  In Fortunes high diſgrace, each wight may death diſdaine,
                  But he moſt valiant is, that can in wretched ſtate remaine.

               By this now it doth appeare, that although Valiance be a ſpeciall ornament for a Captaine, yet it marcheth but in the Rereward, preferring the other two before him as more woorthy, I meane Experience and Policie: and I ſée it is not ynough for the valiant man, to doe what he can, but hée muſt likewiſe take héede, that he attempt nothing, but what he ought: and therefore without Experience, he ſhould runne into many errours, and wanting Policy, hee ſhould likewiſe want meanes to execute: but I wonder what Souldiers haue to doe with Mercy, which you ſay is required in a Generall? I remember the Germanes will needs haue it confirmed, that there are thrée notable fooles in the world. The firſt, an honeſt Dice-player: the ſecond, a mercifull Souldier: the third, I thinke be a Vintner, that will ſell wine without water. But for a Souldier that muſt be tied to Experience, Policie, and Valiance, and all but to reuenge, what hath he to doe with Mercy? or how can Mercie and Reuenge draw both in one yoke?
            
            
               Skill.
               As Iuſtice without temporance is reputed crueltie, ſo Magnanimitie without Mercy, is accounted Tyranny.

This goddes is milde, gentle, & gratious, and there is nothing wherein mortall men may ſo néerely reſemble the diuine nature, as in ſhewing of mercie, and in giuing of life and ſafetie: to ſhew comyſeration to the diſtreſſed, who in their ſorowes haue no other recourſe then to ſighes & ſobbes which aſcende vnto the preſence of God, where they are moſt fauourably receiued: and what can men doe to ſhewe themſelues more like Gods vpon the earth, then in beſtowing of this bleſſing, to giue pardon and life?
            
            
               Pill.
               But this is fitter for Magiſtrates héere at home, and to ſuch as ſhould receiue the petitions and complaintes of the poore, but what is this to ſouldiers whē they are in the field in the preſence of their enemies?

               The incounter then muſt be purſued with courage, but the victorie muſt be vſed with mercie.
               The Lacedemonians vſed before they entered battell, to make ſolemne ſacrifice to the Muſes, to the end they might by them attaine, aſwell how to vſe victorie gentilly, as of Mars to become victors manfullie: and Mercie carries not that grace and comelineſſe in anie other perſon, as it doth in a mightie Conquerour, or a great Commander, becauſe they haue more occaſion to vſe and exerciſe it, and it manifeſteth it ſelfe moſt of all, where it hath moſt matter to worke vpon.

               Pittie without equitie is plaine partialitie, and Mercie out of time & ſeaſon, or leaning ouermuch to lenitie, hath more re

                  emblance to fooliſh Pittie.
               But Policie ſometimes excludeth both Mercie and Pitie, as the Greeks who after the deſtruction of Troy, ſlue Aſtianax the ſonne of Hector, fearing if he had liued he might haue ſought reuenge.
               It muſt therefore be a great vertue, and eſpecially in a Captaine to be both mercifull and wiſe together.
            
            
               Skill.
               Mercie is then a ſpeciall ornament if vſed in reaſon, and as the pleaſure of Reuenge, doth ſudainlie paſſe & vaniſh away, ſo the contentment of Mercie doth for euermore indure.
               
                  Alexander was more famed for the clemencie he vſed to his enemies, then by all the victories he otherwiſe obtained: neither did hée repent him of the pardon he gaue to

                  Diomides (though a tyrant) nor Marcus Antonius of the fauour he ſhewed to the great King Herod.
               
               It is a common thing to pardon light and ſmall offences, but to remit faults of great importance, belongeth onely to the magnificent minde: and as much impoſſible for a noble hart to be cruell, as it is for a cruell hart to be couragious.

               Then we may haue the leſſe néede of Souldiers now at this preſent: but yet as we haue already ſpoken of the Generall himſelfe, and of thoſe things appertaining to his place, ſo let vs now ſpeake ſomething of the ordinarie Souldier, and of his reputation, what it is, or ſhould be. Now if you pleaſe Captaine Skill, to make definition of a Souldier, and how he ſhould be accompliſhed, being in that prime and full perfection as he ought, I will aduenture my ſelfe to ſay what they are, and to what condition they are growne vnto now at this preſent.
            
            
               Skill.
               Then to ſpeake of a Souldier as I would haue him, I will ſpend a great deale of ſpirit, amongſt the good ſpirits of theſe times, not of that ſpirit that makes a winter billowe to breake vpon it ſelfe, but of that ſpirite which like a Martyrs fire, burnes vp a bodie to quicken many ſpirits.
               I make my tongue mine eyes Oracle, I chalenge time to

be my tongues inſtance; I will ſpeake of pure loue in weake oratory: I will ſhew, though not a Philoſopher to define, yet a Souldier to execute.
               Then what inferre I, but this: I will ſpeake of a Souldier, ſhall I ſearch him as Diogenes did a man with a Candle at noone day? no, I will finde him with Scipio, with a ſworde at midnight: I will define him as I proue him▪ deſcribe him as I wiſh him, and wiſh him ſuch in his life, as I would be in my death.
               Execution craues hazard, and they that attempt much, expect reſiſt: reſiſt attaines an oppoſite, an oppoſite ouer-throwe.
               To make a Uictor tryumph, is to inferre a Conquered: to be conquered and not dye, is to bée diſgraced and yet liue: to conquer and not dye, is to buy Eternitie with little price.
               Out of theſe concluſions choſe I a Souldier, as the Stoicks do their Wiſe men, in that (as they vainly imagine) can no wayes erre.
               I knowe him to be created to execute honourably, and to be prepared for death: ſince he liueth ſtill marching forth to ſeeke it: to hate ſubiection more then he feareth death, and ſo coniecture the honour of his calling, by the conſequence of that he vndertaketh.
               For what is the effect of a Souldiers life? to vndertake the defence of Religion, to fight for his Prince, to withſtand the hazards of his Countrey, to repulie thoſe that would depreſſe the ſame to protect his friende and family.
               It followeth then, that as none but the Ueſtall Uirgins were ſuffered to kindle the ſacret fire, neither any other admitted to ſacrifice to Iupiter, but ſuch as were his Prieſts, and were honoured for puritie of life: ſo none ſhould be admitted to the honour or title of a Souldier, except his Conſcience were anſwerable to his cauſe, and his life as honeſt, as the quartell he vndertaketh is waightie and good.
               I account not him for a Souldier, that like a Nazaret
                  
weares long lockes, that can ſweare, ſwaſh and ſwagger, and is more noted for the brandings he brought from the Seſſions, then for the woundes he receiued in the warres.
               The Souldier I define and ſéeke, muſt accuſtome himſelfe to enquire with the Spratans, not how many the enemies be, but where they be.
               His life muſt be deuout, his behauiour modeſt, his diet temperate, his moſt hated enemy, ſhamefull flight, his greateſt ſtudy, to learne Agis, that he is vnworthy to gouerne many, that hath not often and ſundry times fought againſt many.
               Such in my iudgement ſhould Souldiers be, but ſuch (as Ciceros Orator) are eaſily defined, but ſeldome found.

               But for him, that from a Pſalme of mercy, is made a maintainer of Iuſtice, and that is redéemed from the whip, to fight for his Prince, or that is but raked vp in the ſtreetes, to vndertake for his Countries defence, what policie this is, let ſome Philoſopher decide, for my little wit is too ſlender to coniecture.

               Let me now ſpeake truly of Souldiers what they 
                     〈◊〉
                  : I thinke of all Occupations they be the men of the beſt

conſcience, for they neuer riſe nor fall with the Market, but let corne be cheape or deare, their pay is ſtill eight pence a day: let the dayes be ſhort or long, faire or fowle, hote or colde, they kéepe their price, eight pence a day, no more then they had many yeares agoe, when they might haue bought more for the eight pence, then they can do now for their eighteene.
               Againe, the Souldiers in theſe dayes, do neuer put out their money for vſurie, they neuer purchaſe lands nor liuings out of their neighbours hands: you ſhall not finde him in the Marchants bookes for any great ſummes, and yet if it be but for a matter of a thouſand pounds, a Souldiers word is as good as his band.
               This honeſt demeanure of theirs, doth ſo priuiledge them, that after the warres ended, when they returne into their Countrey, it is in their owne choyce, whether they will begge or ſteale: if he cannot procure to be one of the Knights of Winſor, he may eaſily compaſſe to be whipt about the ſtreetes at Weſtminſter.
               
               Now of all Occupations, I would not wiſh my friendes to bind their ſonnes Apprentiſes to the Soldiers trade in theſe dayes, and yet the profeſſion hath bene accounted honourable, and it may well retaine the honour ſtill, for any thing that I know: but there is no gaine, nor great commoditie bolonging to the Occupation.
               Perhaps yet a man that hath honeſtly ſerued, at his returne home, may get ſome worſhipfull Gentlemans countenance, or a Noble man may now and then vouchſafe him a nodde, or a fauourable looke: And it is a goodly matter that ſame, and very acceptably receiued of many: but for my part I had rather haue a Lambes Purtinance, then ſuch a Countenance: for the one may ſerue to fil the belly, and for the other, it may well feede a foole, but I am ſure it will neuer make him fat.
               I thinke in times paſt, it was as rich a bootie to get ſome Noble mans countenance, as it was for Scoggin to get the Biſhops Bleſſing, that being once attained, they were both ſcarce worth a couple of pence.

               If Heraclitus were now liuing, and ſhould take a ſuruey of this ſtraight of times, I wonder with what countenance he would looke vpon vs?

               And I doubt againe, that if we had another Democrites amongſt vs in England, to looke vpon the conuerſation of all ſortes of people, I wonder whether he woulde laugh for ioy in contemplating our happineſſe, ſtill ſquared out by the prouidence of godly Princes, or laugh to ſcorne the practiſes of the vngodlie, that are ſtill platting and practiſing their owne infelicitie?
               Some will ſay the world runnes on whéeles, and it may be it hath done ſo in times paſt: but I ſay now it goes on crourhes, it is become Bis puer, it is waxen olde, decrepit and lame: A limping worlde God knowes, and nothing but halting betwéen neighbour and neighbour, betwéen friend and friend, betwéen brother, and brother, and ſometimes halting downeright betwéen? the father and the childe.
               Our aunceſteurs alas, they were but plaine dealing men, they had not the mineing complements now in vſe, they knew not a Fantaſtick from a foole, and they were better acquainted with a Shooing-horne, then they were with a Setting-ſtick.
               But now I will not giue a groate for his conceipt that cannot make an Owle an Hawke, a Iack Napes a Shéepe, an old Mil-horſe, a Palfrey for a man of honour, if he cannot work wit like wax, forme it into anie impreſſion: if he cannot poulder it, perfume it, and ſeaſon it to pleaſe fancies: if he cannot Anothomize and Martyr it: and if néed require, if he cannot

               If theſe men did but knowe their owne vnworthineſſe, I think they would change their ſimplicitie to deſperation, and would conuert their pange of drowſie ignorance, to a quotidian fit of frenzie.

               It would be tedious for me to deliuer the diuerſitie in the diſpoſitions of men: we ſée one readie to die for the loue of a woman: another will ſet his wife to ſale: one would that euerie man ſhould liue of his owne: ſome other are ſo much inclined to Pitharoras ſect, that they would haue all things to be in common amongſt friends: one will boaſt with Thraſo, another will flatter with Gnato: another to make Iohn his ſonne a gentleman, will himſelfe lye like a mizer all the daies of his life: but I think that be to verifie the prouerb, Happie, is the child, whoſe father goes to the diuell.

               The propogation of Souldiers with vs héere in England (thus lately growne to this baſterdlie kinde) are eſpeciallie miſbegotten in their verie firſt choice: for in times of imploiment, when Souldiers are to be leuied and prepared, the election is made of Rogues, Runnagates, Drunkards, and all ſorts of Uagabonds and diſordered perſons, ſuch as are fitter to garniſh a priſon, then to furniſh a Campe: And the authoritie of theſe appointments are committed to ſillie Conſtables, or perhaps ſometimes, to ſome Iuſtice of peace, as ſillie and ignorant as he that is moſt ſimple: and theſe doe thinks they haue performed a verie wiſe piece of ſeruice, when they heue rid the countrie of this ſcumme of idle loiterers.

               It was my fortune not manie yeares ſithence to paſſe along the ſtréets, where I ſawe a companie of townes men, that were weaponed with olde ruſtie bills, who were haling and pulling of a fellow by the head and the ſhoulders (I had thought to ſome place of execution) and demanding of one of the companie what affence the fellow had cōmitted: I was

               With this demaund, the Conſtable of the Warde began to grow very hote and angry, and he tolde me flatly, he was not ignorant how farre his Commiſſion did extend: and as for theſe Rogues, Wagabonds, and other like excremen

               But what ſucceſſe may be hoped for by thoſe warres that are ſupplied by men altogether Irreligious prophane, wicked, vngracious, ſuch as God hath not promiſed to bleſſe, but hath denounced againſt them his malediction and curſe? O wit neglecting times, that cannot looke into this apparant ill, and cannot diſcerne afore hand of the inconuenience that may ſuccéede.
               Wée firſt preſſe Rogues, Drunkards, and ſuch other ill diſpoſed perſons, which being once preſſed, muſt be kept with continuall guard, perhaps in Bridewell, or other like places, for running away: What a heauy burthen then to the Common-wealth to Arme and appoint them fit for the field? thē being deliuered to their Captaines & Conductors, they are tranſported to the place of Rende vous, with as good a will, as a Beare is brought to the ſtake, and the time that they ſhould ſpend in the practiſe of their weapons, they practiſe nothing but how to run away: ſo that before one moneth be fully ended, he that can ſhewe fiftie for his hundred, is worthy to paſſe the Muſters for an able company.
               How Generals and great Commaunders were by theſe meanes abuſed by their Muſter Rowles, where they might finde for euery thouſand mē, at the leaſt two thouſand names: the Commiſſaries, and other Officers of the Muſters, (that were not corrupted by the ſcraping Captaine) can well ynough report: But how Princes and eſtates were deceiued of their pay, I may ſlightly paſſe, becauſe (as it ſhould appeare) the matter was but ſlenderly regarded: and how the Common-wealth likewiſe was continually charged with the leuying of ſupplies, that ran away againe as faſt as they were ſent: the matter deſerueth no great conſideration, when both

citis and countrie did pay ſo dearely for it: as they deſerued no better, that would make no better choyce.
               Thus through the ſimplicitie of a Conſtable, the Princes ſeruice was abuſed, the manners and Diſciplines of the auncient Militia corrupted, and the name and eſtimation of the noble Souldier vtterly deſpiſed.
               But héere is the maine miſchiefe, if neceſſitie ſhould inforce to fight, what hope to confirme thoſe fellowes with a ſetled reſolution, to inco

               I will leaue the reſt to thoſe that are (indéede) inducious and able to diſcerne: but foraſmuch as the ſouldier is the arme and ſtrength of the warre, it ſhal not be altogether inconuenient, brieflie to touch and ſlippe euer what conſideration former times haue had in their election and choyce.
               The holie Scriptures themſelues doth furniſh vs with manie examples tending to this purpoſe, as when the whole Hoſte of the children of Iſrael were vtterlie diſmaied, for the multitude of their enemies, the Lord commanded Gedeon, to muſter ſuch to incounter them, as were moſt faithful, & doubted nothing of his promiſes made vnto them, which were but thrée hundred in number, and were choſen by the lapping of water.
               And who is ſo ſillie as not to think, but that the antiquitie of Muſters, is no leſſe auncient then the antiquitie of Warres, neither hath their bene any errour more ſeuerely puniſhed, then thoſe abuſes in the Training and Muſtering of Souldiers.
               
                  
This chopping and changing is but a late practiſe, and ſhe Muſters in times paſt, were euermore taken in the preſence of men of iudgement, grauitie and wit: and amongſt the Romanes, they were committed to priſon, their goods confiſcats and ſolde, that would not perſonallie appeare and anſwer to their names at any time of Muſters when they were called: and to conclude, I thinke he doth but ill deſerue ſo enioy any benefit in his country, that wil refuſe to fight for the libertie and ſafetie of his countrie.
            
            
               Pill.
               I may ſay Amen: but he that ſhould preach this doctrine, perhaps might offend the better ſort of his pariſhoners: but now I perceiue they be not all Souldiers that runs vp and downe the country a begging vnder Souldiers Paſports, but according to the prouerbe, Catte after kind: ſo theſe I perceiue wil follow their former function, firſt from a Rogue to a Soldier, and from a Souldier again to a Rogue, it muſt néedes be a wel formed Campe that is framed of ſuch ſtuffe.
               I wonder now what Diſcipline might be preſcribed to containe theſe fellowes in order in the time of Warre, that could neuer be brought to obſerue order nor 
                     •
                  oneſtie in the time of Peace: yet there is nothing more neceſſarie then order, eſpecially in Warre, without the which all runs to confuſion: but for my ſelfe, I think I were beſt to ſpeake of order, as he that came from Church, who could ſay, There was a verie good ſermon: and yet could neither remember the text, nor any other word that the Preacher had ſpoken: ſo ſay I, order is good, (if it be decent:) but many doth vſe it, as they doe vſe the new faſhion, that doe neuer thinks themſelues to be in faſhion, till they be quite out of all faſhion.
            
            
               Skill.
               The auncient orders and maners left vnto vs by the great Captaines of former ages are omitted, ſometimes by corruptions, ſometimes by neceſſitie, and many times innouated by Captaines, who to ſhewe themſelues as wiſe as womens Taylors, can deuiſe euerie day a new faſhion.
               This order that we ſpeake of, is to be obſerued in the field, in the Towne, in the Campe, in marching, in fighting, in charging, in refyring.
               
                  
In like maner, whether to offend or defend, there is nothing of more importance then order, when by the neglect thereof, great and mightie armies haue periſhed.
               In the beginning, before they knew any maner of forme, or order of aray, the victorie was euermore caried away by the ſtronger part: but fithens they haue learned to order themſelues into Rankes, and to fight in good aray, the conqueſt now is not ſo proper to the ſtrength of men, as it is to this experimented order: neither is there any multitude (being once broken and diſordered) that are able to abide a farre inferior number, that ſhal aſſaile them with order and ſkill.
               This order therefore is to be obſerued, firſt in diſtributing their whole forces into Companies, into Regiments, into Squadrons: and it is a pleaſing thing, becauſe an Armie conſiſting of many partes, may with the more eaſe be diuided and martialled

               That muſt néedes ſtand with reaſon: but yet there be ſome not knowing this, that wil figure forth ſuch formes of Battells, as (I think) were vſed in Alexanders time, and were fitter for the incounters of that age, then for the ſeruice of the time preſent, & this antiquitie they inferre as a matter of great importance whereby to priuiledge thē: but héere by they doe ſo much the more be wray their ignorāce, for thoſe orders then in vſe, would be altogether out of ſeaſon, or to verie little purpoſe.
               But there is a ſecond Parodox which is now lately crept out of a budget, that doth all to be pepper this opinion, and will in no wiſe endure that the alteration of weapon ſhould likewiſe enforce the alteration of order, and hath inferred no leſſe then 30. imputations verie wiſely obiected againſt the moderns Captaines of this age as he calleth them, for digreſſing from the diſciplines and orders vſed by the auncient Captaines (I think he meanes in the time of King Arthur) amongſt the Greekes and Romanes.

               But as from the beginning, the hatred and malice of men one towards another hath continually increaſed, ſo with this rage and furie, they haue not failed from time to time, to practiſe new inuentions whereby to kill and murther, and to this purpoſe they haue till deuiſed weapons, euerie one of more aduantage then other.
               At the firſt before weapons were knowne, they avenged themſelues with teeth and naile, after they began to fight with ſtaues and clubbes, then they found out the forging both of weapons and armours, and from age to age, new inuentions of ſwordes, Iauelins, billes, pikes, and other manual weayons were found out and practiſed by ſundrie men at ſeueral times, entertaining ſtil thoſe weapons in vſe, which they ſound to be of greateſt force and moſt aduantage.
               Thus by péece meals they likewiſe inuented ſundrie parcels of armour, where with they armed men: then they fel to arming of Chariots, Eliphants: And Horſes were likewiſe armed and barded till within theſe few yeares.
               Continuance of time brought in Long bowes, Croſbowes, Slings, Brakes, Darts, and ſuch other like, and now of late we haue changed them all for the Caliuer and Muſket.
               
               Thoſe formes and proportions that were vſed when they had no other incounters but with manuall and ſhort weapons (and that the hope of victorie conſiſted in the vigor and ſtrength of mens armes, and in his ſkil that could bring moſt handes to fight) would be now to little purpoſe, when the mightieſt troupes and ſquadrons may be ſo diſcomfited with the furie of ſhotte, that they ſhal neuer be able to ſtrike one ſtroke.
               We haue therefore left thoſe formes & battels that were then vſed, and haue retained an order perfected by time, and bettered by Experience.

                   For our ancient Engliſh weapon the Long-bow, I am ſure there be manie that would gladlie maintaine the excellency of them: but for aſmuch as in the firſt diſcourſe betweene vs, we haue ſufficiently delated of their greateſt effects, we may therefore let thē yas, yet for my part I could wiſh they were but half ſo effectual as ſome ignorāt men would willingly perſwade.

               I think there is nothing wherein Fortune is more variable then in the actions of Warre, for as there is no ſetled forme or Diſcipline which is not chopped & changed in euerie age, ſo in field incounters, there is no hope nor certaintie, which is not quaſhed againe in euerie moment: and therefore Princes doe in nothing more deceiue themſelues, then when they doe refuſe a reaſonable compoſition when it is offered, and relie in the hope and hazarde of a Battell.
            
            
               Skill.
               It were good that Princes (with iuſtice and equitie) could kéepe their owne, rather then by tyrannie to incroach of others: but in the time of Warre to neglect the proſecution of ſeruice by Parlies, by taking of Truces, and delaying of time, it is cloaked vnder the plauſible pretence of Policie, which they cal the winning of time, when in truth they do looſe both time and opportunitie.
               And who be theſe Polititians that doth perſwade it, but Ignorance, Fearefulnes, Conetouſnes, and many times it is induced by Treaſon it ſelfe.
               Under the colour of treatie of Peace, manie practiſes of hoſtilitie hath bene performed: and what greater errour may be committed, then to ſuffer an enemie to buie his owne aduantage but with a few flattering words, and then to laugh vs to ſcorne for our follie.
               This olde Canticle, Da pacem in diebus noſtris, hath ſometimes bene too much imbraced, and the bare motion and ſound of Peace, is ſo ſwéete and pleaſing to the feareful and faint harted, that to patch and péece it vp, they neglect and ſet aſ

                   all occaſions, giuing an enemie thoſe aduantages, that many times are not to be redeemed.
               And what conditions ſo diſhonorable and baſe, but the

coueious minded man (for ſparing of mony) will ſurrender vnto, and all to conclude a Peace more deabtful and daungerous then the bloodieſt Warre.
               I will not ſay but in the time of Parlies, perſwaſion may doe much, but it is beſt then to perſwade, when there is force to commaund: for in the time of Parlies and Treaties of peace, the Conquerour and he that is of greateſt power, doth rather giue then receiue conditions.
               I acknowledge, aſſured peace, is euermore to be imbraced: but theſe coloured treaties and bad aſſurances, are both daungerous and vnprofitable, and Princes haue incurred by them great loſſe, both of time and experience.
               This dallying out the time of ſeruice with deluding Parlies, hath béene holden by timerous people to be verie politique, but if Miſerie be reputed for Policie, and ſparing out of ſeaſon be called good huſbandrie, I ſay ſtill they are ill ſpared pence, that doth afterwardes coſt a great many of poundes.
               I muſt not ſpeake of the delaies of our times, but if it be true, that the wit is beſt that is deareſt paid for, we might in this age bée wiſe and warie both, and learne to looke better to the market, leaſt after this, we buie our owne follie at as deare a rate, as wée haue alreadie purchaſed wit.

               I know not how to value wit, nor what price it hath borne in times paſt: but if it hath bene ſo dearely bought, me thinkes they ſhould haue done well to haue ſpared ſome parte of the charge to haue paied poore Souldiers, that (God knowes) haue manie times wanted both paie and meanes whereby to maintaine themſelues in anie able ſorte to ſerue.
            
            
               Skill.
               As the Warres cannot bée performed without Souldiers, ſo Souldiers cannot bée contained without pay: for where there is want of pay, there muſt néedes be but a ſcambling warre, manie diſorders committed, and as many opportunities pretermitted.

               For want of pay, the Souldier cannot bée kept

from ſcraping, aſwell from friendes as fees: it likewiſe bréedeth mutinies and all maner of diſorders, and Souldiers vnpaid, will make but a ſlowe march, maintaine but a faint fight, and it makes them ſo weake of bodie, and féeble of courage, that one thouſand of Souldiers that were dulie paid, and well prouided for, would be more profitable in the day of battell, then flue thouſand of ſuch ſteruelings that are almoſt ſamiſhed aforehand, and for want of neceſſaries, are brought ſo lowe, that they are neither able to indure fight, nor yet able to runne away.
            
            
               Skill.
               The want of mony in the time of Warre, bréedeth in a Generall diſgrace, in a Souldier contempt, in the enemie occaſion of treaſon, in the confederate, a will to reuolt.
               The Romans (amongſt others) maintained their Monarthies by theſe meanes, they indeuoured nothing more, then to reward good deſert: nor ſought any thing leſſe, then to defraude their ſouldiers of their pay: in peace they prouided them priuiledges, at home they allowed them colonies to dwell in; and in the waine of the Empire, ſo carefull were Monaches to requite them, that their elections did hang in their choice, and their fortunes, on their ſwords: that as one ſtudied to be liberall, ſo the other ſtroue to be loyall.

               To maintaine this pay, your opinion is (as I perceiue by yeur former ſpieches) that we haue not ſo much neede of mony, as we haue of good orders, to ſée them firſt ſet downe, and then well executed.
            
            
               Skill.
               I ſay ſo ſtill: and I adde thus much farther, that if in times paſt, the corruptions of all ſorts of officers had bene examined in time, great ſummes of mony might haue bene ſpared to pay ſouldiers, that was worſe imployed, and more vnprofitably ſpent.
            
            
               Pill.
               I know not in this caſe what I ſhould iudge: but for theſe thirty or fortie yeares I haue bene a little acquainted with the warres of ſeuerall Countries, and I neuer knew but in euery place they ſtill complained for want of pay: but to ſay the truth, our Engliſh nation, more then

               Skill.
               Not poſſible, ſo long as their is brying and ſelling of companies, nor ſo long as offices are to be bought and ſolde for mony.
               I dare not take vpon me to aduiſe Princes whom they ſhould truſt in theſe cauſes, but with reuerence and vnder correction, I wil ſay a little whome they ſhould not truſt, and of whome they ought to beware.
               Then firſt let them take héede to the Irreligions, & againe, of him that is couetous: but if they doe wiſh good ſucceſſe to their owne affaires, let them beware how they truſt him that wil buy his office, and wil giue mony to attaine his place.
               I proteſt I haue not ſpoken any thing particularly, whereby to detect or impeach any perſon in priuate, but onely in commiſſeration of the poore Souldiers, who by theſe diſorders haue bene miſerablie wronged.
               And as the pay that hath bene thus ſpent, might haue bene a great deale better ſpared: ſo there is nothing more hurtful to the procéedings of Warre, then too much miſerie and pinching, where the ſpending of mony (and but in neceſſary ſort) ſhall be more reſpected, then either the loſſe of honour, or the hazard of a Kingdome.

               And it might be tearmed to be but a thréed-bare War, where beſides an ordinarie pay, there is not likewiſe an extraordinary recompence, whereby to gratifie deſert.
            
            
               Skill.
               Where well doing is not regarded, there dutie is many times neglected: and although the law doe inforce ſome, and neceſſitie prick forwards others to the ſeruice of their countrie, yet Rewarde and Recompence are more effectuall to induce a noble courage, then any other meane: for men hardly entertaine hazard where there is no hope, and great mindes that wil aſpire to great aduentures, muſt be recompenced with great rewardes.
               
                  
But would you haue examples, how good deſert hath bene aduāced? looke into the holy ſcriptures, ſée the noble Caleb promiſed his reward by Gods owne mouth, for his great courage and conſtancie amongſt the children of Iſrael, and Caleb himſelfe beſtowed his faire daughter Achſah vpon Othniell his brothers ſonne, for taking the Citie Cariath.
               
               
                  Dauid in like maner receiued great riches of Saul, for killing Goliath: but the Romanes amongſt the reſt, to ſtirre vp mens mindes to martiall prowes, beſides bountifull and liberall rewardes, they inuented glorious triumphes, whereby he that deſerued Fame, might for euer after be eternized.
               In thoſe daies honours and the higheſt places were rewards for valiant men, and good deſert was recompenced with great preferment: now there is no reward but for villanie, for betraying of a Towne, for poiſoning of a Prince, for practiſing of treaſon, or for ſome other like conſpiracie.
               Now for him that liues within the compaſſe of an honeſt life, they think his wit wil afforde him no better: & as there is no reward for the couragious, ſo there is no puniſhmēt for ye coward.
               
                  In diebus illis, after victories obtained & troubles ouer-paſt, then began the Souldiers glorie, for then good deſerts were euer recompenced: ſo that the end of the war, was the beginning of the ſouldiers felicitie, but now the end of the warre is the begining of his beggery, and an almes is the beſt recompence for the beſt deſert.
               When Glorie was the reward of Vertue, men would then contend who ſhould moſt excéede in Vertue, but now ſithence that hope hath bene quenched, they ſ

               There is yet a comfort left to thoſe that haue honeſtlie ſerued the Countrie, when they may ſay that there beſt recompence is, the teſtimony of a good conſcience, and the contentment of an honeſt minde.
            
            
               Skill.
               The teſtimonie of a good conſcience is better then a thouſand witneſſes, and he that hath a contented minde, hath greater treaſure then Fortune is able to depriue: for what aduerſitie can check him that is armed with contentment?

               Contentment is the marke we all ſhoote at, but who could euer hit it? Salomon ſought ſeriouſly after it, but he could not finde it: the wiſe men of the world, haue hunted after it in the world, and although they haue ſometimes had it in chaſe, baiting themſelues with a preſent ſatiſfaction for a time, yet our affections are ſo variable, that more changeable then the Moone, we erect euerie day a new choyee, loathing that to morrow, that we liked of to day.

               There are yet many reaſons whereby to maintaine that ſoueraigntie of contentment, which to thoſe that are earthly minded may ſéeme vnpleaſant, but to a ſoule once ſetled in contemplation, they are the miniſters of méere Diuinitie.

               If his meanes will not ſerue to mount, ſo he cannot lightly fall, for Flatterie cānot blaſt him with his breath, nor Aſpolike Enuie flinges him not aſléepe: héere the Traitors armed hand affrightes him not, nor Sinon ſugered teares are able to deceiue: but Magnitude with a perfect courage of a conſtant minde attends and waites on him, and thus retirde from all his worldly cares, he reapes the fruite of ſwéete and quiet reſt.

               Then to winde vp our concluſion, and to make an end of our conference at this time, I will ſpeake a little of life and death as they ſhould be eſteemed: for if we could dulie conſider of the good that cōmeth vnto vs by death it would appeare that the whole Tragedie of the euils of this life is there finiſhed, and that the ſting of Death, is but the beginning of life.

               Skill.
               Since life is the race, wherein we ſtriue to obtaine honour, and death is the tearme whereby our honours are crowned, I will ſpeake of life as it ſhould be confirmed to vertue, and of death as the true gate of felicitie.
               Life ſaieth the Philoſopher is but a borrowed dreame of pleaſure, wherein we apprchend all things incertainly, by reaſon of the ſwiſt and irrecouerable chaunges thereof.
               It is a race wherein the wicked man ſeeketh to ouerthrowe the good, and the good man that ſtandeth on his feete, will not helpe the good man that fieth on the ground.
               It is a viſion of delight that vaniſheth in imagination, a warfare of vncertaintie, and a way to death.
               In life there is no diſtinction either of greatnes or abiectnes, for the begger in life, hath as great intereſt as the King.
               It is only the way wherein we walk crowned with honour to our graue, or buried wt infamies to ſéeke out eternall death.
               Wretched is that life, which hath but a time to liue, and that in death, a life without the which death had not béene.
               Briefly to expreſſe how abiect a thing life is, let that ſaying

of Philip of Macedon ſerue to confirme y• ſame, who finding a fit place to incampe in, but vnfit to allowe his beaſts of burthen any 
                     •
                  other: How miſerable (ſaith he) is our life, who are inforced to beſtow the beſt opportunities of the ſame to the ſeruice of Aſſes?
               
               It is like a Pageant or Stage, whereon all ſortes ſhew thēſelues, that chalengeth nothing frō eternitie, but the fruits of good imploimēts. The hazard of life is determined by y• iuſtice of y• cauſe, & it is neuer more happy, thē whē loſt worthily.
               The ſhortneſſe thereof is redeemed by the vſe, for Life well imploied is a preuention of Death.
               As for Death, what is it but a bleſſed neceſſitie to the good man, and a fearefull enemie to the euill?
               There is nothing more certaine to fleſh & blood, thē Death, & nothing more fearful to fooles, then to thinke they muſt die, when it is but a paſſage to a better life: And how happy is that death, which leadeth to that life, which is not ſubiect to death?
               It is a ſeperation from an vncertaine to an aſſured eſtate, a retrail wherein Honour liueth, and obſcuritie ſléepeth: A Harbinger, aſſigning reſt without payment, A Gate, to that felicitie the ſoule longeth for.
               For which cauſe Aeſchilus calleth it the remedy of worldly ſorrow, wherein we eſcape that which life feared, and winne that, which a quickning faith hopeth for.
               Since therefore, Life is but a ſum of money put out to vſe, and our iudgements and honours are aſſigned vs, as we imploy the ſame, & death is but the fire to try our deſeris, whether they were born to obſcuritie, or reſerued for eternitie, let Souldiers liue ſo, as when the caſualties of warre ſhall allot them death, they may be held good ſtewards of this betruſted and vncertain treaſure, that like good children being nouriſhed in all dutie, by their mother the Common-wealth, they may dye with cōſtancy in the defence therof: that as earſt the Spartan womē, ſo their mothers may ſay in their deaths, We bare them for their country, and we haue happily loſt them for their country. Or rather thus with Critias, He rather pleaſeth me more that he died a death, both worthy his friends and country, thē that he ſhould haue liued a life vnworthy both his friends and country.
