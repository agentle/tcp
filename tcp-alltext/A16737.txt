            To the Reader.
            
               MEeting with many
Crosses in the world,
among them all I
found some in books,
as Crossing of Prouerbs,
Crosse answers
and such other like Crosse humours, as
I haue collected out of Crosse Authors,
which I haue here put together in this
little booke, in which, if you find any
thing crosse to your liking, crosse it out:
and if there bee any thing that is better
worth then nothing, be not crosse
to patience to esteeme of a little, though

but a little: so loth to crosse mine owne
Reason, with too much persswasion
of your too kinde, either disposition
or discretion, I
rest as I finde
cause.
            
               Your well-wisher,
