               ¶ This treatyſe is called the doctrynale of dethe and is to be rede afore a man or a woman whan it ſemeth that they be in the artycle of deth.
            
               REde this as it foloweth afore the ſeke perſone ye ſhall vnderſtonde that none ſhall haue the kyngdome of heuen but ſuche as fyghteth for it / and ſpecyally agaynſt theyr body the tyme of temptacyon and ſekenes. The ſoule and the body are of contrary na ture and of contrary condycion / and betwyxt them is contynuel bathayl. Yf your ſoule take pacyently the bodely ſekenes / and as hertly as it can thanke god therof / for ye haue diſerued this paynes & moche more in punyſſhement of ſyn̄e / than your ſoule preuayles agaynſt your fleſſhe and getteſt the vyctorye / and in rewarde therof ye ſhal haue the crowne of glorye. ¶ Rmembre how oftentymes your fleſſhe hath drawen your ſoule after it to ſynne by delectacion / therfore now our lorde hath ſente you a tyme for to recompence for thoſe many offences Wherfore now late the ſoule drawe the fleſſhe to it and offer it to god as a ſacrefyce brennynge wyth paynful ſekenes in ſatiſfaccyon of that inordinat pleaſure that it hath had in the fleſſhe from the tyme that it was Ioyned therto / pacyently and thankefully take the payne & than the payne is prouffytable to you / & more ſwete in th acceptacōn of god

thenne euer fleſſhly pleaſyre was accepte vnto you from the tyme ye ware borne / thenne ye ſhall haue therby the loue of god / remyſſyon and foryeuenes of ſynne. Increace of grace / and the grete helpe of our lorde at the houre of deth / & ye ſhall haue per petuell Joye for that ye haue ſoo pacyently taken this temporell payne for the loue of hym. ¶ Now lerne ones to haue a pacyent herte / lerne mekely to here the yocke of god / do one prycypall acte for the loue of hym that bare the croſſe of mooſt byttereſt payn for your loue. Remembre he aſſayed your burden / he feled it / he is redy to rewarde you for it / he hath layde it on youre backe / than thynke that ye wyll bere it / ſhewe you his obedyent ſeruaunt / and yf ye bere it of loue ye ſhall fynde it the more lyghter / and ye ſhal fele that his mercy ſhal leſſen your burden & Inwardly refreſſhe you by his grace wt Joyfulnes of ſpyryte as he ſayth hymſelf. All ye that haue laboured & haue borne grete burden for me come to me & I ſhall refreſſhe you / ſhewe your ſelfe now a trewe chylde and dyſcyple of our lorde whiche ſayth yt who wyll be my dyſcyple he muſte forſake his fleſſhly deſyre and take vpon hym the croſſe of trybulatyon. ¶ Now the croſſe is on your backe now bere it myghtely after youre ſaueyour your fleſſhe deſyreth helth an reſt / ye muſte forſake this deſyres and conferme your wyll to the wyl of god whiche knoweth what thyngꝭ is moſte to your auayle / and by this ſhorte payne hath ordeyned yf

ye applye you obedyently to take it that ye ſhal be delyuered therby from many a ſynne whiche ye haue longe tyme contynued in / and a lytell payne in this lyfe auoyded grete payne after this lyf / and a ſhorte payne here recompenſed for a longe payne there / and by the payne that ye ſuffre in this lyf ye ſhal not only haue for yeuenes of ſynne but ye ſhal haue grete Joye after this lyfe. And the payne whi he he ſuffred after this lyfe it deſerued only forgyuenes of ſynne but noo more Joye they ſhall haue therfore. Wherfore vnderſtondynge that ye muſte haue payne for ſynne acordynge to the ryghtwyſnes of god / be gladde that ye haue the leſſe payne whiche is more proyffytable to you than that grete and longe payne ſhold be. This ye thynke is a grete payne but in regarde of that payne whiche is a uoyded by this graciouſly takynge it is in manere no payne. The dere beloued ſoules of our lord they had grete payne afore they departed out of this lyf and they deſyred ſo to haue for they knewe the profyte and fruyte whiche they ſhold haue therby whiche they haue now & are put in ful ſurte that they neuer ſhall haue ſuffraūce of payne after this. Remembre this bleſſyd felawſhyp whiche hath gone afore you / and be glad that ye maye be felawſhyp with them / truſte it veryly ye ſhall haue grete comforte of them agaynſt your goſtely enmye yf ye Joy fully folowe them. I wote wel your fleſhe grugeth with payne but that ſhall not leſe your meryte / for

it is naturall to the fleſſhe ſo to do / the meryte is in your ſoule that ye thynke ye haue deſerued it and haue a wyll to ſuffre it as longe as it pleaſed god ye ſhal haue it and ſaye in your ſoule / lorde I than ke the for this ryghtwys payne whiche I ſuffre bleſſyd be thou that ſendes me reaſon and techynge to take it pacyently / thy name be bleſſyd euerlaſtyngly and with al the force yt ye may applye your body to ſuffre payne lyke as our ſauyour applyed his body to the croſſe for you. And whan ye fele that ye drawe to ſekenes haue wyll to ſaye gramercy my lorde lyke yf ye receyued a precyous gyfte of hym / & yf your payne be ſo grete that ye thynke not vpon thankynges at that tyme / ſoone after whan ye fele the payne aſſwaged than hertly thanke hym that he wyll make you partener with hym in paſſyon For as ſaynt Poule ſayth / lyke as we are parteners with hym in paſſyon / ſo we ſhal be parteners with hym in Joye and conſolacyon. ¶ Remembre alſo the grete rewarde that ye ſhall haue for pacyently takynge of this payne. For as ſaynt Poule ſayth / all the paynes yt we may ſuffre are not able to haue that Joye whiche we ſhall haue for payne / but only by ye grace of god whiche hath ordeyned that a lytell payne well taken here ſhall haue Ineſtima ble Jope there. Ye ſhall haue god hymſelfe for the good labour of your ſuffraunce & the ſame glorye that he hath. That is to ſaye / ye ſhall clerly ſe the ſame godhede and bleſſyd dyuynite that he ſeeth / 

& haue euerlaſtynge gloryous fruycyon with moſte ſwete & brennynge loue of the ſame / and be in felawſhyp with his bleſſyd moder and all the angels and ſayntes of heuen in myrth and Joye with endles blyſſe ſo grete that neuer eere dyde here / neuer eye dyde ſee / neuer herte dyde thynke the leeſt parte of that Joye. ¶ O what payne wyll the dampned ſoules whiche are now in helle ſuffre ſoo that they myght auoyd that outrage & horryble payne that they haue & euerlaſtyngly ſhal haue / yf they myght auoyde yt perpetuell payne by ony temporel payne that they myght ſuffre / yf they had lycence to torne agayne to this lyfe al erthly payne ſhold be ſwete to them / and all payne of this worlde ſholde be in maner as noo payne to them / all that payne they ſholde haue auoyded yf thy had gracyouſly taken payne in this lyfe afore yt they departed / and they that ben in heuen haue ſo grete Joye for the payne that they ſuffred in this lyfe bleſſydly yt they thyn he yf that they were here agayne they wolde ſuffre an hondred tyme more payne than euer they dyde therfore now applye you to ſuffre thankfully this payne that ye may haue there the grete ineſtymable Joye whiche groweth of good ſuffraūce. Now gyue gode example to thoſe yt are aboute you that they may ſee by your meke takynge of payne that ye are ye faythfull chylde of god / & that they maye lerne of you lyke wyſe to do in tyme comynge / and than your rewarde ſhal be doubled / for ye ſhal not

onely than for your ſelfe he rewarded / but alſo for them whiche are byttred by you. ¶ Haue alſo in ye ſyght of your ſoule your ſauyour Lryſte Jeſu and ſee the grete effuſyon & ſheddynge of his blode and mooſt paynful deth that he ſuffred for you whiche neuer dyde ſynne / but ſuffred for your ſynne yt ye ſholde neuer be dampned yf ye wyll aſke mercy & be confeſſyd of youre ſynne / & he purchaſſed grace by the ſacrament of baptyſme that yf ye had deyed than whan ye were fyrſt cryſtened ye ſholde neuer haue had payne after this lyf / but for thoſe ſynnes that ye haue done from that tyme ye muſte ſuffre payne in this lyf or in that other lyfe bāt yf ye ſynne be done awaye by the ſacrament of confeſſyon / therfore folowe now the example of your ſauyour in ſo moche he ſuffred for your ſynne ye mooſt greuous payne applye you to ſuffre that ye maye / for all yt ye may ſuffre is no thynge comparable to yt he ſuffred for you / & than truſte veryly ye ſhal be hertly welcome to hym for ye haue wel folowed hȳ / thyſe paynes pacyently taken ſhall delyuer you from ye mooſt outrage payne of hell / & ye maye ſo bleſſydly take them wt geuynge thankyngꝭ to oure lorde for them yt ye ſhal neuer haue payne in purgatory / but thyſe paynes with the vertue of the ſacramentes of the chirche ſhall be to you perfyte purgacyon. Our lord of his Infynyte mercy graūte you habūdaūce of his grace ſo to take youre ſekenes as maye be mooſt prouffytable to your ſaluacyon. Amen.
            
               
AFter that ye haue ſhewed to the ſeke perſon how they ſhal pacyently take the ſekenes to the pleſyre of god and theyr grete meryte / yf ye ſe that of lykelyhode it is a dedly ſekenes and that they be lyke to departe out of this world / than fyrſte of al counſell them to receyue the holy ſacramē
               tes of the chyrche whiche they are bonde to receyue whan they are lyke to deye / whiche are the ſacrament of confeſſyon / the ſacrmente of the body of our lorde / and after this counſell them to receyue the ſacrament of anelynge / and ſaye to them thys Ye ſhall vnderſtonde that all ſekenes & payne cometh of ſyn̄e / for yf there had neuer ben ſyn̄e there ſholde neuer haue ben no payne / and the remedye ayenſt ſynne is grace whiche our lorde hath ordeyned to be receyued by the ſacramentes of the chyrche / therfore the ſouerayn medecyne bothe for ſoule and body are the ſacramentes of the chirche / wherfore yf it pleaſed god that ye ſhal haue youre helth agayne ye ſhall haue it ye ſoner and the better / for withoute the ſpecyal helpe of god there is no medycyne that may helpe nature / & yf it pleaſe his grace that ye ſhall not deye at this tyme ye ſhall haue the more gracyouſe contynuance of lyfe that ye holyly dyſpoſe you to deye. And yf it pleaſe god to take you out of this lyf ye ſhal go ſurely armed with his grace and haue ſpecyali helpe of our lorde and departe lyke a true cryſten man ¶ Alſo I counſell you that ye neyther deſyre to go out of this worlde

ne abyde in it but that ye offre you holy to yt wyll of our lorde as the obedyent chylde of hym whyche was obedyent to the wyll of his fader whan he ſuffred deth for you / and of both rather orther yourſelfe to deye thenne to lyue / thenne ye ſhall not be deceyued for it is ye moſte ſureſt waye / many a man is deceyued the tyme of theyre dethe by hope yt they haue to contynue in this lyfe / for as longe as they truſte verely to lyue they neuer diſpoſe them perfytly to deye / and ſo deth taketh them vndiſpoſyd to the domage and hurte of theyre ſoule. ¶ Alſo ſay I coūſel you as moche as ye may to enforce yourſelf to haue ſorowe and dyſpleaſure for the manyfolde offeuces in dyuerſe ſynnes wherby ye haue dyſpleaſed god / or haue a wyll to be ſory therfore wt perfyte wyl to amende youre lyfe and ſerue god the better as longe as they ſhall lyue yf it pleaſe god that ye ſhal retourne to your helth agayne. And ye ſhal not haue ſorowe ne wyll to ſorowe for fere of dethe ne for fere of payne / but ye ſhall wyll to be ſory for that ye haue be ſo vokynde and ſo greuouſly hath offended ſo gentyll & louynge a lorde whiche hath made you and gyuen you al that euer ye hadde in goodnes from the tyme ye came in to this lyf / and whiche wolde ſuffre deth for the greate loue he had for your ſaluacyon and hath ordeyned euerlaſtynge Joye for you be ſory that ye haue offended his grace / & bycauſe ye wolde not be diſceyued from hym. Yf ye ſee that ye ſeke perſone is lyke to contynue a

good ſpace or it come to deth / than it is expedyent to rede afore them ſome holy mater of the loue of our lorde / or of his grete mercy / or the cōmaunde mentes of god / or ſome cōfeſſyonall / that is to ſaye ſome boke whiche teched a man how he ſholde confeſſe hym / for that ſhall brynge many maters to theyre mynde whyche peraduēture they were neuer confeſſed therof in theyr lyfe / or ſome holy prayers to ſtyre them to the more deuocyon. ¶ Alſo ſee that there be plente of holy water & that it be oftymes caſſed aboute the hous of the ſeke perſone. Alſo ſet in the ſyght of ye ſeke a crucyfyx and alſo an ymage of our lady yf ye can haue it other n piicture or in carued werke. & oftentyme biddeth them remembre the paſſyon of our ſauyour wherby they ſhal haue remyſſyon of ſynne / and ſpecyall defence from theyr goſtely enmye / and bydde them hertly beſeke oftentymes that bleſſyd moder of mercy / to praye for them & that ſhe wyl be with them at the houre of dethe. And alſo yf he be lettred ſaye wyth hym the ſeuen pſalmes and the letanye and the pſalmes of the paſſyon / or holy aniemes and reſponſes and hymnes of the trynyte or of our lady or of other feſtes. ¶ Alſo ſee that the holy candell be brennynge ſpecyally whan ye ſee he draweth nyghe to deth / & blyſſe hym oftentymes with it and yf ye haue ony holy relukes laye them vpon hym. And whan ye ſe that he gyued vp the ſpiryte crye and bydde thoſe whyche are aboute you crye the fader the ſone and

the holy gooſt helpe your ſeruaūt. Jeſu Jeſu Jeſu by the vertu of thy paſſyon helpe thy ſeruaunt / bleſſed virgyn Marye and moder of mercy helpe thy ſeruaunt. Jeſu haue mercy of thy ſoule / all the courte of heuen we beſeke you in the charyte of oure lorde praye for his ſoule / the grace of the holy gooſt and the merytes of Cryſtys paſſyon be with the Amen
            ALſo yf ye thynke the tyme wyll ſerue therto it is expedient to ſhewe to the ſeke perſone the temptacyons wt whiche cōmonly ye deuyl aſſayled yt ſoule at yt houre of deth yt it may be more ſtronger to reſyſte his malyce at that tyme for than he is mooſt 
                  •
               erſe to tempte them / he woie well yf he gete them not than he ſhal neuer haue them / wherfore with all his deceyte and ſutelnes he laboured to dyſceyue the ſoule and brynge it in dyſperacyon yf he maye / and ſpecyally he wyll tempte them in theyr fayth and make them to beleue that it is falſe / and therfore ſaye to them / ſee that ye he faſte in the fayth of Cryſte / for the denyll wyll tempte you therin and make you to byleue yf he can ye yt fayth that ye haue byleued on is falſe / and that ye haue ben dyſceyued all your lyfe therby / for he knoweth that the fayth is the grounde of al vertue and that no man is ſaued without the fayth / for this cauſe ſaye to them / ſee yt ye be faſte in the fayth of Cryſt for your goſtely enmye wyl now do that he may to make you to forſake youre fayth / he wyl ſaye that

ye haue ben diſceyued all youre dayes in ye fayth / for it maye not be that thre perſones ſholde be one god. ¶ Alſo he wyl ſaye that Cryſte was not very god and man & that he was not borne of a virgin & that he is not verely in the ſacrament of the auter / wherfore I exorte you in gode vnderſtōdynge that ye may not be ſaued without fayth that ye kepe faſte the fayth that ye haue taken at the foute ſtone & defye the deuyll with al his falſehode and ſaye in your herte ye wyll dye in the fayth of Cryſte whiche god hath declared with ſo many & grete myracles propre to hym ſelf that he hath ſhewed it true lyke as hymſelfe is true / therfore thynke that ye wolde ſuffre all ye martyrdomes & paynes that the body of man myght ſuffre rather than ye wolde forſake the fayth whiche god hath ordeyned to your ſaluacyon / wherfore put your hole confidence in god whoſe power is able to defende you agayne all the malyce of the deuyll and wyll not fayle his faythfull chylde / and truſte verely that your myghty fayth ſhal affraye the fende / and with ye power of god and ſpecyall aſſyſtence & helpe of that fayth full virgyn whiche by the meryte of her fayth dyde cōceyue the ſone of god without knowlege of man And with the helpe of ſaynt mychell & your good angell with his felowes ye ſhall make the fende a ferde of you. ¶ It paſſeth the power of the fende to compelle ony ſoule wylfully to erre in the fayth and what ſo euer temptacyon comed in your myn

de contrarye to your fayth / haue wyll to byleue as the chirche of god byleueth and as our ſauyour Jeſu Cryſte teched the chyrche to byleue / and all the falſe ſuggeſtyons of the deuyll and thoughtes contrary to the fayth ſhall noo thynge hurte you / for there is neuer ſynne in the mynde dampnable excepte it come of the wyl nor in none other power of the ſoule. Byleue fayhtfully ſuche techynge & prechynge as ye haue had by the chirche / and what ſo euer cometh contrary to that in your mynde / thynke it is falſe and cometh of the deuyll fader of all falſehode. Werfore I exorte you that lyke as ye haue begonne youre lyfe in the perfyte fayth of the chirche / ſo ende it in perfyte fayth and obedyence / for all the wele of your lyfe now hyngeth of the ende. ¶ Yf they be lerned ſaye the crede afore them in latyn. Yf they vnderſtonde no latyn ſaye it in Englyſſhe after this fourme. I byleue in god fader almyghty the maker of heuen & erthe / and in Iheſu Cryſte the ſone of hym our oonly lorde whiche by the werke of the holy goſte was conceyued & borne of the vyrgyn Marye / and ſuffred paſſyon vnder Pylate and was crucefyed / deed / and beryed / the thyrde daye he roſe from deth to lyfe and aſcended to heuen & there he ſytteth at ye ryghte honde of the fader almyghty / and from thens he ſhall deſcende to Juge quycke & dede. I byleue alſo in the holy ghoſte and in holy chyrche and in all ye ſacrament therof / alſo I byleue in foryeuenes of ſynne & that

euery man ſhal ryſe from deth to lyf and that the good people ſhall haue euerlaſtynge lyfe and Ioye Amen. ¶ And ſpeke this with an hye voyce that it maye be well herde / & yf ye thynke ye tyme ſhal be ſuffycient afore the deth reherſe the crede dyuers tymes that the ſeke maye be made ſtronge in ye fayth & to confonde ye deuyll whiche loued not to here ye crede & fleed from ye ſonde of the voyce ſpecyally whan it is ſayd to the entente y• it ſhold confunde the deuyll. ¶ Alſo ſaye to the ſeke / remembre ye grete fayth of ye Patriarkes Abraham Yſaac & Iacob whiche they had in god our ſauyour Cryſt of whome they ꝓphecyed / & for theyr fayth they were ſpecyally byloued of our lorde & preſerued from grete peryl / & after the paſſyon of our ſauyour they were brought out of ye pryſon called lymbo in to ye kyngdome of heuen. Alſo remēbre ye faythe of ye apoſtles Peter Poule ſaynt Iames ſaynt Iohan wt all theyr felowes. Alſo remēbre what paynes Innumerable martyrs dyde ſuffre bycauſe they wold not forſake theyr faythe / & in theyr martyrdoms our lorde ſhewed ſo many grete myracles yt yt enmyes of yt fayth were torned to ye fayth. Alſo remēbre ye inumerable men & wymē whiche haue keped this fayth truly in theyr lyf & deyed therin for whom god dayly ſhewed myracles al thoſe dyd pleſe god by fayth / & wtout fayth no ſoule maye pleaſe hym. Remembre the profyte of y• faith it opteyned al thynge of god proufytable to the ſoule as he ſayth hymſelfe all thynge are poſſyble to a faythfull ſoule.
            
               
               ¶ The ſeconde temptacyon is agaynſte ye vertue of hope by diſperacyon.
               WHan ye ſoule at the artycle of deth is troubled ſore wt grete ſekenes / thā ye deuyl wyl put in theyr ymaginacion al ye grete ſyn̄es that it hath done / and ſo in theyr grete trouble bodely & ghoſtely he purpoſed that they ſhal no thynge conſydre but payne & ſynne wherby they ſholde fall in diſperacion ſeynge the grete abhomynacyon of theyr lyfe. And ſpecyally he wyll labour to confunde them in ſuche ſynnes as they were neuer cōfeſſyd of whiche for neglygence they dyde forgete Wherfore ye ſhall ſaye to the ſeke / ſee that ye put your full hope in ye mercy of god / for of all ſynnes ye ſholde ſpecyally offende god yf ye had not a ful bylyue and hope of his mercy. And truſte ye verely that ye haue foryeuenes not onely of thoſe ſynnes of whiche ye be confeſſyd but alſo of all thoſe of ye whiche ye wolde haue be confeſſyd of yf they had comen in your mynde / knowe ye verely yt the mercy of god is Infinite it paſſed your mynde to thynke how grete it is / wherfore I waren you truſte verely in the full mercy of god / and yf ye had neuer done good dede in al your dayes but as many ſynnes as there are droppes of water in the ſee / or cornes of ſonde in the worlde / and yf there come but two of them to your mynde the tyme of confeſſyon vnder vnderſtondȳge ye wold be cōfeſſyd of them al yf ye

myghte haue them all togyder in mynde and haue wyll for to be ſory for them ye ſhall haue foryeuenes of them al / and yf your ſpeche fayle you yet yf ye aſke mercy in your mynde and haue wyll to be confeſſyd yf ye myght ye ſhall neuer be dampned for them. wherfore ſee that ye haue dyſpleaſure in your herte that euer ye dyde breke the commaunde mentes of god & ſynned dedly / and haue very purpoſe yf ye myght lyue a thouſand yere that ye wyl no more breke his cōmaundement and that ye wol de rather ſuffre all the torment of the worlde than ye wolde ſynne dedly and deſerue to loſe the glorye of our lorde god and the kyngdom of heuen / thus meke your herte and ye ſhal haue grace. Our lorde ſaytn in the ſauter that he neuer deſpyſed a contry te & a meke herte. And the prophete Ezechyel ſaith that in what houre a ſynner taketh ſorowe for his ſynne he ſhall be ſaued. And ſaynt Bernard ſayth that the pyte of god paſſeth without all meſure the wretchydnes of man / for he is euer redy to forgyue the ſynne yf we haue wyll to be ſory therfore and aſke mercy with confeſſyon. One of the greteſt ſȳ
                  nes is to byleue yt god is not mercyfull / for in that a ſynner dooth all that is in hym to ſpoyle god of one of his mooſt greteſt vertues whiche is called mercy / & as longe as your ſoule is in your body ye ſhall haue mercy yf ye aſke it / therfore ſee that oftymes ye lyft vp your hert to god & aſke hȳ mercy And whan the perſone whiche is in the artykell of

deth maye not ſpeke / bydde them holde vp ye fynger or ſtyre it in token that they aſken mercy with herte. And yf they haue ſyght to loke vpon the crucefyxe / ſaye thus to them. Beholde how you lorde god bowed his necke to kyſſe you / his armes caſted abrode to halſe you / his handes are open to rewarde you / his herte alſo is opened to loue you / all his bleſſed body is offred to the fader in ſacrefyce for you yhat ye ſhall by the vertue of this oblacyon haue remyſſyon of ſynne / and yf ye hertly aſke mercy ye ſhall haue foryeuenes by ye vertue and merytes of his paſſyon though ye neuer haue done gode dede wherby ye deſerue to haue foryeuenes / for this cauſe he ſuffreth paſſyon that al ſynners ſholde haue helpe therby whyche wyll aſke mercy. And euery man as longe as ye ſoule is in the body is in the ſtate yt he may haue grace. ¶ Remembre how that ſaynt Peter denyed Cryſte and aſked grace & had it. ¶ Alſo ſaynt Poule dyde perſewe yt, cryſten people for to kyll them / and afterwarde he aſked mercy and was made the choſen veſſell and ye louer of god. ¶ Alſo ſaynt Mathewe and zache were ſynfully occupyed / and yet afterwarde by a repentaūce of herte they came to greate grace. ¶ Alſo Marye Mawdeleyne by aſkynge mercy and repentaūce of herte is now aboue many virgyns in heuen / notwithſtondȳge ſhe was a comon woman in this lyf ¶ Alſo Marye Egypcyen a comon woman and now by mercy is an holy ſaynt. ¶ Alſo the theef

whiche hynge on the ryght ſyde of our lorde aſked mercy and had it and was that ſame daye put in poſſeſſyon in the glorye of god. ¶ Adam. Dauyd. yſachy / & Manaſſes, with many moo / thus by cō
                  trycyon and aſkynge of mercy hadde foryeuenes of theyr ſynnes / wherfore ſythen that ye haue thus many wytneſſes of the mercy of our lorde I requyre you in god that ye put full confydence in the me rytes of Cryſtys paſſyon & aſke mercy & ye ſhall haue it.
