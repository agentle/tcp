               A Lamentable Song of the death of King LEARE and his three DAVGHTERS.
               To the tune of, When flying Fame.
               
                  KIng Leare once ruled in this Land,
                  with princely power and peace
                  And had all things with hearts content,
                  that might his ioyes encrease.
                  Amongst those guifts that nature gaue,
                  three daughters faire had he,
                  So princely séeming beautifull,
                  as fayrer could not be.
               
               
                  So on a time it pleasd the King,
                  a question thus to mooue,
                  Which of his daughters to his grace,
                  could shew the dearest loue:
                  For to my age you bring content,
                  (quoth he) then let me heare,
                  Which of you thrée in plighted troth,
                  the kindest will appeare.
               
               
                  To whom the eldest thus began,
                  
                     deare father mine (quoth she)
                  Before your face to doe you good,
                  my blood shall tendred be.
                  And for your sake my bleeding heart,
                  shall heere be cut in twaine,
                  Ere that I see your reuerent age,
                  the smallest griefe sustaine.
               
               
                  And so will I the second said,
                  deare father, for your sake,
                  The worst of all extremities,
                  ile gently vndertake.
                  And serue your highnesse night and day,
                  with diligence and loue:
                  That sweet content and quietnesse,
                  discomforts may remoue.
               
               
                  In doing so you glad my soule,
                  the aged King replyed.
                  But what sayst thou my yongest Girle,
                  How is thy loue allyed.
                  My loue quoth yong Cordela then,
                  which to your grace I owe,
                  Shall be the duty of a childe,
                  and that is all ile shew.
               
               
                  And wilt thou shew no more (quoth he)
                  then doth thy duty binde:
                  
                     I well perceiue thy loue is small,
                  when as no more I finde.
                  Hence forth I banish thee my Court,
                  thou art no child of mine,
                  Nor any part of this my Realme,
                  by fauour shall be thine.
               
               
                  Thy elder sisters loues are more,
                  then well I can demand:
                  To whome I equally bestow,
                  my kingdome and my land.
                  My pompall state and all my goods,
                  that louingly I may
                  With these thy sisters be maintaind,
                  vntill my dying day.
               
               
                  Thus flattering speeches won renowne,
                  by these two sisters here:
                  The third had 
                        •
                     anselesse banishment,
                  yet was her loue more deare:
                  For poore Cordela patiently
                  went wandring vp and downe,
                  Unhelpt, vnpittied, gentle maid.
                  through many an English towne.
               
               
                  Untill at last in famous France,
                  she gentler fortunes found,
                  Though poore and bare, yet was she dee

                     the fairest on the ground:
                  Where when the King her vertues heard,
                  and his faire Lady séene,
                  With full consent of all his Court,
                  he made his wife and Quéene.
               
               
                  Her father, old King Leare, this while,
                  with his two daughters stayed:
                  Forgetfull of their promisd loues,
                  full soone the same denaide.
                  And liuing in Quéene Ragans Court,
                  the elder of the twaine,
                  She tooke from him his chiefest meanes,
                  and most of all his traine.
               
               
                  For whereas twenty men were wont,
                  to waite with bended knee:
                  She gaue allowance but to ten,
                  and after scarce to thrée.
                  Nay, one she thought too much for him,
                  so tooke she all away:
                  In hope that in her Court, good King,
                  he would no longer stay.
               
               
                  Am I rewarded thus, quoth he,
                  in giuing all I haue
                  Unto my children, and to beg,
                  for what I lately gaue.
                  
                     Ile goe vnto my Gonorell,
                  
                  my second child I know,
                  Will be more kinde and pittifull,
                  and will relieue my woe.
               
               
                  Full fast he hies then to her Court,
                  where when she heard his moane,
                  Returnd him answer, that she grieude,
                  that all his meanes were gone.
                  But no way could relieue his wants,
                  yet if that he would stay.
                  Within her Kitchin, he should haue,
                  what Scullions gaue away.
               
               
                  When he had heard with bitter teares,
                  he made his answer then,
                  In what I did let me be made
                  example to all men.
                  I will returne againe, quoth he
                  vnto my Ragans Court,
                  She will not vse me thus I hope,
                  but in a kinder sort.
               
               
                  Where when he came, shee gaue command,
                  to driue him thence away▪
                  
                  When he was well within her Court,
                  (she said) he could not stay.
                  Then backe againe to Gonorell,
                  
                  
                     the wofull King did hie:
                  That in her kitching he might haue
                  what Scullion boyes set by.
               
               
                  But there of that he was denied,
                  which she had promis'd late:
                  For one refusing he should not,
                  come after to her gate.
                  Thus twixt his daughters for reliefe,
                  he wandred vp and downe,
                  Being glad to feed on beggers food,
                  that lately wore a Crowne▪
                  
               
               
                  And calling to remembrance then,
                  his yongest daughters words,
                  That said, the duty of a childe,
                  had all that loue affords.
                  But doubting to repaire to her,
                  whom he had banisht so:
                  Grew franticke mad, for in his minde,
                  he bore the wounds of woe.
               
               
                  Which made him rend his milk while locks
                  and tresses from his head:
                  And all with blood bestame his cheekes,
                  with age and honour spred:
                  To hils, and woods, and watry founts,
                  he made, his hourely moane:
                  
                     Till hils and woods, and sencelesse things,
                  did seeme to sigh and groane.
               
               
                  Euen thus possest with discontents,
                  he passed ore to France,
                  In hope from faire Cordela there,
                  to find some gentler chance.
                  Most vertuous dame, where whē she heard,
                  of this her fathers griefe:
                  As duty bound, she quickly sent
                  him comfort and reliefe.
               
               
                  And by a traine of noble Peeres,
                  in brane and gallant sort,
                  She gaue in charge he should be brought
                  to Aganippus Court.
                  Her royall King, whose noble minde,
                  so freely gaue consent,
                  To muster vp his knights at armes
                  to fame and courage bent.
               
               
                  And so to England came with speed,
                  to repossesse King Leare:
                  
                  And driue his daughters from their throne
                        •
                     
                  
                  by his Cordela deare.
                  Where she true hearted noble Queene,
                  was in the battell slaine:
                  Yet he good King in his old dayes
                  
                     possest his crowne againe.
               
               
                  But when he heard Cordela dead,
                  who dyed indeed for loue
                  Of her deare father, in whose cause
                  she did this battell mooue
                  Heswounding fell vpon her brest,
                  from whence he neuer parted,
                  But on her bosome left his life,
                  that was so truely hearted.

                  they doomed by consents
                  And being dead, their crownes were left,
                  vnto the next of kin,

                  In Wales we haue fountains no christal more cleare
                  Where murmuring musick we daily may heare:

                  UUhere true loue with true loue may merrily meet.
               
               
                  Queene Katherine.
                  But there is no tilting nor tornaments bold,
                  Which gallant yong Ladies desire to behold:
                  No maskes nor no reuels where fauours are worne
                  By Knights or by Barons without any scorne.

                  Our May-poles at Whitsontide maketh good sport,
                  And moues as sweet pleasure as yours doe in court:
                  UUhere on the green dancing for garland and ring,
                  Maidens make pastime and sports for a King.

                  UUhilest siluer-like melody murmuring keepes
                  And rocks vp our senses in heauenly sicepes.

                  Queene Katherine.
                  What if a kind Princesse should so be content,
                  By meeknesse thus mooued to giue her consent:

                  I feare yet to fancy thy loue tempting tongue,
                  For Cupid is cunning, his bow very strong,

                  To succour her, all Christendome
                  did willingly accord,

                  King Richard from this land:
                  Of noble Knights and Gentlemen,
                  with him a warlike band:
                  To fight for Iesus Christ his name,

                  But tooke him prisoner cowardly,
                  where ransome must be paid,
                  And not fight for our Sauiour Iesus Christ
               
               
                  His noble Knights and Soldiers then,
                  with sorrow went away:
                  Wofully complaining all,

                  a prisoner there should stay,
                  And not fight for our Sauiour Iesus Christ.
               
               
                  While they were here prouiding
                  a ransome for his Grace,
                  The Dukes owne Sonne vnreuerently,

                  the Daughter of the Duke:
                  Whom deepely wounded was with loue,
                  proceeding from his looke,
                  For which to saue his Princely life,
                  she kindly vndertooke:

                  she secretly conuaid,
                  Into the Dungeon where the King,
                  his execution staid:
                  The which to saue his gentle life,
                  an instrument was made.

                  For when the hunger starued beast,
                  into the Dungeon came:
                  With open mouth to swallow him,
                  he nimbly tooke the same:
                  And stoutly thrust it downe his throat,
                  the Lyon thus to tame.
                  In honor of our Sauiour Iesus Christ.
               
               
                  And so with valiant courage, he
                  puld out the Lions heart:
                  Which made the Duke and all his Lords,
                  in fearefull manner start:
                  To see this royall English King,
                  to play so braue a part:

                  The country and our law of Armes,
                  commands it so to be.

               A gallant Song of the Garter of England and how it was made first an honour to this Kingdome by King Edward the third.
               To the tune of, When Arthur first, &c.
               
                  WHen as third Edward ruld this Land:
                  And was our English king:
                  He had good speed in all his fight
                  braue conquest home to bring:
                  Two Kingly Crownes vpon his sword,
                  In sumptuous sort was borne:
                  Most gallantly to grace the third,
                  that on his head was worne.
               
               
                  
                  Thus three in one made Englands same,
                  through all the world to shine:
                  Which well might clame a titled grace,
                  amongst our worthies nine:
                  Seauen princely Sonnes he likewise had,
                  whose vertues wonne him prayse,

                  Which made the world thinke, Mars his Court

                  Of whom the noblest Prince that liued
                  gaue sounds of braue report.
                  Right valiant King, himselfe likewise,

                     such honours did obtaine,
                  As Mars himselfe in glistering stéele,
                  the prize from them would gaine:
                  So braue and bold his Barons were,
                  and so successefull then,
                  That none of all the Lords of Fram
                        •
                     ,
                  were like our English men.
               
               
                  Thus many moneths he with his Peeres
                  spent there with braue delights,
                  Whose dayly sports concluded were
                  by reueling at nights:
                  Where Measure and Carantoes fine,
                  so gract the Court of France:
                  As if Quéene Iuno with her Ioue,
                  
                  had brauely led the daunce.
               
               
                  Amongst which glorious troope of Dames,
                  that richly sate to sée,
                  The French Quéene there aboue the rest
                  the fairest séemd to be,
                  Whom English Edward by the hand,
                  in curteous manner tooke,
                  To dance withall, at which the French,
                  gaue many a scornefull looke.
               
               
                  But Edward still like Mars himselfe,
                  with countenance and grace,
                  
                     By Courtship won great liking there,
                  from all within that place.
                  King Edward pleasd the Princely Queene
                  the Queene king Edward well,
                  But as they daunct, there from her leg,
                  by chance her garter fell.
               
               
                  The which king Edward soone tooke vp,
                  And it in kindnesse wore,
                  For fauour and for curtesies
                  he to her vertues bore.
                  But some there present gaue forth words▪
                  
                  The Queene of purpose lost
                  Her garter there for him to find
                  whom she affected most.
               
               
                  But when she heard these ill conceits
                  And speeches that they made,
                  Hony soyt qui maly pens,
                  the noble Princes said.
                  Ill hap to them that euill thinke,
                  In English it is thus
                  Which words so wise (quoth Englands King)
                  shall sur

                     ly goe with vs,
               
               
                  And for her sake shall Englands Peeres,
                  In honour of our land,
                  A Garter weare, and in the same,
                  
                     these words in gold shall stand.
                  That all the world may nobly speake,
                  Our garter came from France,
                  In Princely manner named thus,
                  our Countrey to aduance.
               
               
                  The Tilts and Reuels thus had end,
                  That long had lasted there:
                  And home our King and Nobles came
                  with mirth and meery cheere:
                  Where soone he brauely did create,
                  Full many a Lordly Knight,
                  To weare this golden Garter faire,
                  So sumptuous and so bright.
               
               
                  And named them S. Georgies knights,
                  And of this Garter braue:
                  As noble an order of estate,
                  as any King can haue,
                  Which Knights vpon S. Georges day,
                  Still their precession goes,
                  Through Englands Court in robes of gold
                  and most delightfull shoes.
               
               
                  At Windsor is this Order kept,
                  Where kings be of the same,
                  And forraigne Princes much desire,
                  the honours of that name.
                  
                     Third Edward first began this grace,
                  of knight-hood to his praise:
                  Which still is kept with high renowne,
                  in our King Iames his dayes.
               
               
                  Ten English Kings haue been thereof,
                  of Princes and of Peeres
                  A number great, whose honors liu'd,
                  most braue in ancient yeares:
                  And at this day of Dukes and Lords,
                  our land hath honoured store:
                  Whose names and fames the Lord increase
                  and make them more and more.
               
               FINIS.
            
            
               A lamentable Ditty on the death of the Lord Guilford Dudley, and the Lady Iane Gray, that for their parents ambition, in seeking to make these two yong Princes King and Queene of England, were both beheaded in the Tower of London.
               To the tune of, Peter and Parnell.
               
                  WHen as King Edward left this life
                  In yong and tender blooming yeeres▪
                  
                  Began such deadly hate and strife,
                  That filled England full of feares:
                  Ambition in those ancient dayes.
                  
                     More then ten thousand, thousand, thousand
                  thousand troubles did arise.
               
               
                  Northumberland being made a Duke,
                  Ambitiously doth seeke the crowne,
                  And Suffolke for the same did looke,
                  To put Queene Maries title downe.
                  That was King Henries daughter bright,
                  And Queen of England, England, England
                  and King Edwards heire by right.
               
               
                  Lord Guilford and the Lady Iane,
                  
                  Were wedded by their parents wils
                  The right from Mary so was tane,
                  Which drew them on to further ils:
                  But marke the end of this misdeed,
                  
                     Mary was crowned, crowned, crowned,
                  and they to death decreed.
               
               
                  And being thus adiudged to die
                  For these their parents haughty aimes,
                  That thinking thus to mount on high,
                  Their children King & Queene proclaimes,
                  But in such aymes no blessings be,
                  When as ten thousand, thousand, thousand,
                  their shamefull endings see.
               
               
                  Sweet Princes they deserud no blame,
                  
                     That thus must die for fathers cause:
                  And bearing of so great a name
                  To contradict our English lawes,
                  Let all men then conclude in this
                  That they are haples haples, haples,
                  whose parents doe amisse.
               
               
                  Now who more great then they of late
                  Now who more wretched then they are:
                  And who more lofty in estate,
                  Thus sodenly consumd with care:
                  Then Princes all set downe this rest,
                  And say the golden golden golden,
                  golden meane is alwayes best.
               
               
                  Prepard at last drew on the day
                  Whereon these Princes both must die
                  Lord Guilford Dudley by the way
                  His dearest Lady did espye
                  Whilst he vnto the blocke did goe
                  She in her window, weeping, weeping,
                  did lament his woe.
               
               
                  Their eyes that lookt for loue ere-while,
                  Now blubberd were with pearled teares,
                  And euery glance and loners smile
                  Where turnd to dole and deadly feares:
                  Lord Guilfords life did bleeding lie,
                  
                     Expecting Angels, Angels, Angels.
                  siluer wings to mount on hie.
               
               
                  His dearest Lady long did looke,
                  When she likewise to blocke should goe,
                  Where sweetly praying on her booke,
                  She made no signe of outward woe:
                  But wisht that she had Angels wings,
                  To see that golden, golden, golden,
                  sight of heauenly things.
               
               
                  And mounting on the Scaffold then,
                  Where Guilfords liuelesse body lay:
                  I come (quoth she) thou flower of men.
                  For death shall not my soule dismay:
                  The gates of heauen stand open wide,
                  To rest for euer, and euer, and euer,
                  and thus these gentle Princes dyed.
               
               
                  Their parents likewise lost their heads,
                  For climing thus one step too high:
                  Ambitious towers haue slippery leades,
                  And fearefull to a wise mans eye.
                  For onee amisse great houses fall,
                  Therfore take warning, warning, warning
                  by this you gallants all.

                  UUen Ambassies did come

                  To euery language speech and tongue,

                  But being there ariued,
                  With noble heart she striued:
                  to giue them all what they desird to haue
                  A louely grace and countenance,
                  Smiling with perseuerance,

                  As it was best besitting
                  for such a royall Princes thus to speake:
                  A Soldier I will liue and dye,

               A new Song of the strange liues of two yong Princes in England, who became two Shepherds vpon Salisbury Plaine, and after restored to their former estates.
               To the Tune of the Merchants man.
               
                  IN Kingly Stephens raigne,
                  Two royall Dukes there was:
                  That all our other English Lords,
                  for greatnesse far did passe.
                  The one of Deuonshire namd
                        •
                     ,
                  that had a daughter faire:
                  Which he appointed at his death,
                  to be his only heire.
               
               
                  And her in loue commits,
                  Unto the Cornewall Duke:
                  Whom he with tendernes and care,
                  most kindly vndert
                        •
                     oke.
                  
                     The promise being made,
                  The Duke of Deuonshire dyes:
                  And all that Cornewall vow'd to doe▪
                  
                  he afterwards denies.
               
               
                  Yet well he educates the Maid,
                  That Maudlin she was growne:
                  The fairest Lady vnder Heauen,
                  for beauty being knowne.
                  And many Princes sought for loue,
                  But none might her obtaine:
                  For couetous Cornewall to himselfe,
                  the dukedome sought to gaine.
               
               
                  So on a time Prince Raymond chanc't,
                  This comely dame to see:
                  With whom he fell so deepe in loue,
                  as any Prince might be.
                  Unhappy youth what should he do,
                  She still was kept in mew:
                  Nor he nor any of his friends,
                  admitted to her view.
               
               
                  One while he melancholly pines,
                  Himselfe with griefe away:
                  Anon he thinkes by force of Armes,
                  to win her if he may.
                  Untill at length commanding loue,
                  
                     Became to be his Iudge:
                  And chang

                  into a kitching drudge.
               
               
                  And so accesse had he good Prince,
                  Her purpose to bewray:
                  But still faire Maudlins answere was,
                  she husbandlesse would stay.
                  Mean while her Gardiant beat his braines,
                  Her dukedome to atchiue:
                  Nor caring wat became of her,
                  so he by her might thriue.
               
               
                  And so resoluing that she should,
                  Unto some peasant wed:
                  And Raymond then suppos
                        •
                     d a drudge,
                  should stand him in that stead▪
                  
                  But Maudlin marking his intent,
                  Unkindly takes that he,
                  Should bar the noblest match from her,
                  thus for a base degree.

                  Forgetfull of himselfe and birth,
                  His country friends and all:
                  And minding onely her to seeke,

                  But liu'd with pinchings cares and griefe,
                  among the country grounds.
               
               
                  A brace of yeares vpon that plaine,

                  But then began againe,

                  Where Raymond kept his sheepe:
                  Did feed her droue with whom this prince,
                  in loue was wounded deepe.
                  Where sitting on the downy plaine,
                  And hauing small to do:

                  The Merchant venturing abroud,
                  Suspects his wife at home:

                  Forgetting morrowes cares:
                  Nor feares the blasting of his corne,
                  nor vttering of his wares.
                  And this I know full well faire Lasse,

                     A forehead smooth and hie:
                  A seemely nose, on either side
                  did shine a graish eie.
                  Two rosie cheekes and ruddy lips,
                  White Iuory teeth within:
                  A mouth in meane and vnderneath
                  a round and dimpled chin.
               
               
                  A snow-white necke with blewish vaines,
                  To make her seeme more faire:
                  Yea all her body framd so fine,
                  that earth had none more rare.
                  For life, for loue, for forme and face,
                  None fairer was then she:
                  And none but only she alone,
                  so faire a maid could be.
               
               
                  I knew the Lady well quoth she,
                  But worthlesse of such praise:
                  But credit we no sheepheard thou,
                  thy speeches so be wraies.

                  And equally perplext in loue,
                  they sate them downe to weepe.

                  In Scotland is my fathers court,
                  And Raymond is my name:
                  With Cornewals duke I liu'd in pomp,
                  till loue controld the same.
               
               
                  And did this Lady dearely loue,
                  Though she not loued me:
                  But all that loue is wasted quite,
                  and now I die for thée.
                  I grant quoth she you lou'd her well,
                  If that your loue were such:
                  Yet thinke of me your second loue,
                  in loue to be as much.
               
               
                  Your twice beloued Maudlin heere,
                  Submits herselfe to thée,
                  And what she could not at the first,
                  the second time shall be:
                  In fortune, not in person chang'd,
                  For I am still the same,
                  In heart and mind as chast and true,
                  as first to me you came.
               
               
                  Thus swéetly surfetting in ioy,
                  They tenderly imbrace:
                  And for their wished wedding day,
                  
                     found fitting time and place.
                  And so these louely princes both,
                  Each other did befriend,
                  Where after many a hard mishap,

               To the tune of regard my sorrowes.
               
                  WHen Richard the second in England was King
                  And raigned with honor & state:
                  Sixe vncles he had his Grandfathers sons,
                  King Edwards that ruled of late.
                  All Counsellors noble and sage,
                  yet would he not heare
                  their precepts deare,
                  So wilfull he was in this his young age.
               
               
                  A sort of braue gallants he kept in his court
                  That traind him to wanton delight,
                  Which parasites pleased him better in mind
                  then all his best Nobles and Knights:
                  Ambition and auarice grew
                  so great in this land,
                  that still from his hand,
                  
                     A masse of rich treasure his parasites drew.
               
               
                  His péeres and his barons dishonored were
                  And vpstarts thus mounted on hie:
                  His commons sore taxed his cities opprest,
                  good subiects were nothing set by:
                  And what to his Coffers did come,
                  he wantonly spent,
                  to please with content,
                  His flattering vpstarts stil sporting at home
               
               
                  When thus vnto ruine this kingdom began
                  To fall from the highest estate:
                  The Nobles of England their Princes amisse,
                  by parliament soone did rebate.
                  And likewise those flatterers all,
                  they banisht the court,
                  that made but a sport,
                  To sée this so famous a Kingdome to fall▪
                  
               
               
                  But after these galltās disgraded were thus
                  King Richard himselfe was put downe,
                  And Bullenbrooke Lankasters noble borne Duke,
                  by pollicie purchast his crowne:
                  Thus ciuill warres héere begun,
                  that could haue no end,

                  But Richard the breeder of all these same broyles,
                  In prison was wofully cast:
                  Where long he complained in sorrowful sort
                  of Kingly authority past:
                  No Lords nor no subiects bad he,
                  no glory, no state,
                  that earely and late,
                  Upon him attending had wont for to be.
               
               
                  His robes were conuerted to garments so old,
                  That beggers would hardly them weare:
                  His dyet no comfort at all to him brought,
                  for he fed vpon sorrow and care:
                  And from prison to prison was sent,
                  each day and each night.
                  to worke him despight,
                  That wearied with sorrowes, he still might lament.

                  Yet here to ease my dying heart,

               Captaine Ienkinsons Answere.
               
                  
                     I haue perusd I know not what,
                  forsooth thy scroule of loue:
                  In hope by these thy flattering lines,
                  
                     My setled minde to moue:
                  But I disdaine to talke of loue,
                  much lesse in loue to be:
                  For martiall druins and warlike stéeds,
                  more better pleaseth me.

                  haue likwise smarting stings:
                  And thou no whit dost want a bait,
                  that to repentance brings.
                  Content thee therefore Elinor,
                  
                  thou temperst loue by art:
                  Although it come vnto mine eyes
                  it shall not touch my heart.

                  and mortall men shall die:
                  And riuers ouerflow their bankes,
                  in loue will then be I.
                  When these shall be and I not be,
                  then may I chance to loue:
                  And then the strangest change youle see,
                  that I a louer proue.
               
               
                  Let beauers hide, not kisses hurt,
                  my lippes for lippes vnfit:

                     on top of honour sit.
                  I scorne a Souldier that should stoope
                  to please a louers mind:
                  That fights for Fame in fields of blood
                  should alter thus from kind.
               
               
                  Yet some there be whose maiden hayres
                  no sooner buds on chin,
                  But they to loue our Ladies faire
                  doe wantonly begin.
                  And wins them soone who would be won
                  and being won with speed:
                  They gained haue a crop of corne,
                  that scarce is worth the seed,
               
               
                  These loue in sport but leaue in spight,
                  as I haue found it true,
                  And being thus so easily won,
                  are changed for a new.
                  But kindnesse must haue kind

                  though kind be hardly one,
                  Their kindnesse then I must refuse,
                  because I will haue none.
               
               
                  And strange it were (a Souldier) I
                  should loue this English maid.
                  The wonders seuen should then be eight
                  could loue me so perswade:
                  But loue er hate, fare ill or well,
                  
                     I thus conclude my minde:
                  My welcome when I come to thée,
                  Shall surely proue vnkinde.
               
               
                  This Answer brought to Elinor,
                  
                  such inward sorrow bred:
                  That she in reading of these lines
                  poore Lady fell downe dead.
                  Where her deare loue and gentle life,
                  Had both together end:
                  And as we may suppose in death,
                  her soule did liue his friend,
               
               
                  For she by Will did him bequeath,
                  Her substance and estate:

                  can neuer turne to hate.
                  Her wealth, her meanes, and all she had,
                  This Captaine did possesse:
                  Which brought vnto his grieued soule,
                  much woe and wretchednesse.
               
               
                  For comming from Ierusalem,
                  And entring on the same,
                  To view what wealth the Lady left,
                  he to her Chamber came:
                  Where as the Ladies picture hung,
                  With which he fell in loue.
                  
                     And so the shaddow wrought the thing,
                  the substance could not moue.
               
               
                  Her courtesie and his despight,
                  He calleth then to minde:
                  And of her beauty being dead
                  a sodaine change did finde:
                  Remembring then his low degree,
                  And reckoning her desert:

                  This picture hath procurde my death,
                  and for the same must dye.

                  For lacke of loue that dyed:

                     her of my loue denied.
               
               
                  Thus by her picture prickt with loue
                  He felt continuall woe
                  And bearing it still in his hand
                  he to her graue did goe.
                  Where sitting on the same he said,
                  He loues the shadow now:
                  Whose heart vnto the substance late,
                  would rather breake then bow.

                  I must indure your doome:

                  Whose onely beauty worthy was,
                  To match without a dower:
                  Yet she in vaine did beg my loue▪

                  His dagger from his side in hast,

                  And to his heart he strooke the same,
                  With all his manly force:
                  And so vpon his true loues graue,

                  If wild wanton Rosamond one of our sort,
                  Had neuer frequented King Henries braue Court,
                  Such heapes of deepe sorrow she neuer had séen,
                  Nor tasted the rage of so iealous a Quéene.
               
               
                  All men haue their freedome to shew their intent,

                  Who still go vpright, vntill women do hault?

                  For women vnconstant can neuer be prou'd,

                  The Prince the eldest, but eleuen yeares old,
                  The Duke more yong as Chronicles haue told.
               
               
                  The dead Kings brother, Duke of Glocester,
                  Was chosen for the Prince his Protecter:
                  Who straightway plotted how to get the Crowne,
                  And pull his brother Edwards children downe.
               
               
                  
                     Edward the fift, the Prince was cald by name
                  Who by succession did that title gaine.
                  A prudent Prince whose wisedome did excell,
                  Which made his vncles heart with hatred swell.
               
               
                  Then did the Duke vse all the meanes he might,
                  By dambd deuises for to worke their spight:
                  At length the diuell put it in his head,
                  
                     How all his plots should be accomplished.
               
               
                  With sugred words which had a poysond sting,
                  He did intice the Duke and the yong King:
                  For safeties sake to lodge them in the Towre,
                  A strong defence and Londons chiefest Flower.

                  And for to do the same you must not misse:
                  This night so that the King be murthered,
                  And the yong Duke as they lie in their bed.

                  Ith Tower within a But of Malmesey drownd.
               
               
                  It was my plot that he should drowned be,
                  Because that none should claime the Crowne but me,
                  And when these children thou hast murdered,
                  Ile weare the Royall Crowne vpon my head.
               
               
                  And know thou Tirrill when that I am King,
                  Ile raise thy state and honours to thee bring:

                  Hell-hearted murtherers and did them disguise
                  The one Miles Forrest which there keeper was
                  The other Dighton kéeper of his horse.
               
               
                  At midnight then when all things they were husht,
                  These bloody slaues into the chamber crusht:
                  And to the bed full softly did they creepe,
                  Where these sweet babes did lie full fast asleepe.
               
               
                  And presently did wrap them in the cloathes,
                  And stopt their harmelesse breath with the pillowes▪
                  
                  Yet did they striue and struggle what they might,
                  Untill the slaues had stifeled both them quite.

                  They tooke their bodies forth the cursed bed,
                  And then they buryed these same little ones
                  At the staire foot vnder a heape of stones.
               
               
                  But marke how God did scourge them for this deed,
                  As in the Chronicles you there may reade
                  Blood deserueth blood, for so the Lord hath said,
                  So at the length their blood was truely paid.
               
               
                  For when their Uncle he had raign'd two yeares:
                  He fell at variance then amongst his Péeres:
                  In Lestershire at Bosworth he was slaine,
                  
                     By Richmonds Earle as he did rightly gaine.
               
               
                  In pieces was he hewed by his foes,

                  They stript him then, and dragd him vp and downe,
                  And on stout Richmonds head they put the Crowne.

                  Not farre from thence on a feat right nigh,
                  There was an old man sitting by,
                  Who said good sir I can you shew,
                  How you that penny shall bestow,
                  for if you haue a wedded wife,
                  I wish you haue her during life.
                  A wife I haue indeed quoth he,
                  And a Lemman faire and bright of blee,
                  Whom I do trust, and euer shall,
                  So constant is her loue withall.
               
               
                  
                  The old man answered at last,
                  So soone as you the Seas haue past,
                  Then put of all your faire array,
                  And to your Lemmon take your way,
                  saying that thou a Merchant great,

                  Now which of both doe pitty thow,
                  With her abide in weale and woe.
               
               
                  With that the penny forth he drew,
                  Which to the old man straight he threw,
                  Saying he would go trie the same
                  So in short space he ouer came▪

                  vnto his Lemmans house went he.
                  And softly knocked at her doore,
                  But when she saw he was so poore,

                  He said sweet Lemmon for Christ his sake,
                  Upon me here some pitty take,
                  Upon the Seas my goods I lost,

                  But she with words right fierce and fell,
                  Said villaine, wretch adieu, farewell.
               
               
                  Shall I giue succour to thy deed?
                  The Diuell grant thee ill to speed,

                  let her giue succour to thy life,

                  Then in that poore and simple array,
                  Unto his wife he tooke his way,
                  And told like tale as he before,

                  and said sweet wife without your aide

                  With that he did his wife embrace,

                  vnto his Lemmans house he went,
                  As by the way she did him spy,
                  She ran and met him by and by,
                  And said my loue for very shame,

                  Why did you faigne your selfe so poore?
                  Sith you do know you haue my loue,
                  And all my goods for your behooue?
                  She then with him did kisse and dally,
                  as she was wont with ancient fally,
                  My Lemmon deare he said againe,
                  
                     To me it hath been told right plaine,
                  You haue another friend in store,
                  Whom you doe loue at heart right sore.

                  He hath in hold I tell you true:
                  Then vp she rose all in a braide,
                  And all those things before him laide:
                  he tooke them vp and cald his men,
                  and said go get you home agen,
                  With this apparell and this geare,
                  She said what will you robbe me here,
                  He tooke all things to hand that came,
                  And bare all home vnto his Dame.
               
               
                  And said behold my louing feere,

                  Looke well thereon and do not spare,
                  Here is a penny worth of ware:
                  he told her likewise how and when,
                  he had this counsell of a man:
                  She saw those iewels did abound,
                  In value worth a hundreth pound,
                  They thanked God both, for his grace,

                  Giue eare to me that ten yeares fought for Rome.
                  Yet reapt disgrace when I returned home.
               
               
                  In Rome I liu'd in fame full threescore yeares.
                  By name beloued deare of all his Peeres:
                  Full fiue and twenty valiant sonnes I had,
                  Whose forward vertues made their father glad·
               
               
                  For when Romes foes their warlike forces felt,
                  Against them still my sonnes and I were sent:
                  Against the Gothes full ten yeares weary warre,
                  We spent, receiuing many a bloody s

                  Iust two and twenty of my sonnes were slaine
                  Before we did returne to Rome againe:
                  Of fiue and twenty sonnes I brought but three
                  Aliue, the stately Towres of Rome to see.
               
               
                  When warres were done I conquest home did bring,
                  And did present my prisoners to the King
                  The Queene of Go

                     h her sonnes and eke a Moore,
                  Which did much murder like was nere before.
               
               
                  
                  The Emperour did make this Quéene his wife
                  Which bred in Rome debate and deadly strife:
                  The Moore with her two sonnes did grow so proude,
                  That none like them in Rome was then alowd.
               
               
                  The Moore so pleasd the new-made Empresse eye
                  That she consented with him secretly:
                  For to abuse her husbands marriage bed,
                  And so in tune a blacke a moore she bred.
               
               
                  Then she whose thoughts to murder were in
                        •
                     inde,
                  Consented with the Moore with bloody minde:
                  Against myselfe, my kin and all my friends
                  In cruell fort to bring them to their ends.
               
               
                  So when in age I thought to liue in peace,
                  Both wo and griefe began then to increase:
                  Amongst my sonnes I had one daughter bright,
                  Which ioyde and pleased best my ages sight.
               
               
                  My deare Lauina was betroth'd as than
                  To Caesars sonne a yong and noble man:
                  Who in a hunting by the Emperours wife,
                  And her two sonnes bereaued were of life,
               
               
                  He being slaine was cast in cruell wise
                  Into a dismall den from light of skies:
                  The cruell Moore did come that way as then,
                  
                     With my two sonnes who fell into that den.
               
               
                  The Moore then fectht the Emperour with speed,
                  For to accuse them of that murtherous deed:
                  And then my sonnes within the den were found
                  In wrongfull prison they were cast and bound.
               
               
                  But now behold what wounded most my minde,
                  The Emperours two sonnes of Tygers kinde:
                  My daughter rauished without remorse,
                  And tooke away her honour quite perforce.
               
               
                  When they had tasted of so sweet a flower,
                  Fearing their sweet should shortly turne to sowre,
                  They cut her tongue, whereby she could not tell,
                  How that dishonour vnto her befell.
               
               
                  Then both her hands they falsely cut of quite,
                  Where by their wickednesse she could not write,
                  Nor with her needle on her sampler sow,
                  The bloody workers of her direfull woe.
               
               
                  My brother Marcus found her in a wood,
                  Staining the grasse ground with purple bleed:
                  That trickled from her stumps and handlesse armes,
                  No tongue at all she had to tell her harmes.
               
               
                  But when I saw her in that woefull case,

                  When as I saw she could not write nor speake,
                  With griefe my aged heart began to breake,
                  We spread a heape of sand vpon the ground,
                  Whereby those bloody tyrants out we found.

                  The Empresse then thinking I was mad
                  Like Furies she and both her sonnes were clad:
