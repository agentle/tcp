               Thanks, Earle of Flaunders, Duke of Orleance, thanks,

               The French and Engliſh make one warlike body,
               Whereof your Highneſſe is the mouing head:
               Or peace or warre, as pleaſeth you, direct.

               What wrong, King Lewes?
               The Kingdome of Nauar we will acknowledge
               To hold of none but of the King of Kings.

               Talke not of yeres, yeres limit not a Crowne,
               There's no preſcriptions to inthrall a King:
               
                  He finds it written in the Rowles of time,
               Nauar's a Kingdome ſolely abſolute,
               And by colluſion of the Kings of France,
               Becauſe it lies ſo fitly vpon France,

               It hath bin wreſted for a Royalty,

               That Pembrook ſpeaks the truth, behold my ſword,
               Which ſhall approue my words ſubſtantiall.

               I tell thee, Rodoricke, Pembrooke ſoldier-like
               Hath truely opened, what ten thouſand liues
               Will hardly doe, if warre be made the Iudge.

               If war be Iudge? why, ſhallow-witted Burbon,
               
               Who ſhall decide this difference, but war?
               Hath not the Iudge put on his Scarlet Robe?
               Is not the field prepar'd? our men in armour?
               The Trumpets ready for the ſound of death?
               And nothing hinders vs but our owne words?
               Leaue idle parley, my dread ſoueraigne Lord,
               And ſoone reſolue the Duke in fire and ſmoke,
               That he maintaines a title falſe and forg'd,
               And that Nauar is a vſurping Lord.

               Pem.
               Pity ſuch true loue, which like bleſſed ſeed,
               Sowne in ſuch fertile ſoyle, his princely breſt,
               By the rough ſtormy brow and winters hate
               
                  Of aduerſe parents ſhould be timeleſſe nipt,
               And dye e're it attayne maturity:
               For I haue heard, the Princeſſe whom he ſerues,
               Is hotely courted by the Duke of Burbon,
               Who to effect his choyce, hath in theſe warres
               Furniſht your father with a gallant power:
               His loue may haply then diſable Philips.
               
            
            
               Fer.
               O no, my father doth affect the Prince:
               Beſides, my ſiſters heart is ſo combin'd
               To his in perfect loue, that Burbons hate,
               Nor all the world that knot can ſeparate.
               Then ſorrow not for him, but turne the ſtreame
               Of gentle pity on thy wretched friend,
               Within whoſe boſome loue hath kindled fire,
               So ardent, that the flames will bury me.
               
                  Philip is throued in my ſiſters eyes:
               But in my loue diſdayne and hatred lyes.
            
            
               Pem.
               Doth ſhe not pay true kindneſſe with the like?
            
            
               Fer.
               As ſtepdames, orphanes, night, the cleer-fac't day,
               So doth ſhe hate me, and returne my woes,
               Like a ſteeld Anuill backward on my ſelfe.
               She is all hate, yet ſuch a louely foe,
               That I muſt kiſſe the ſword that wounds me ſo.
            
            
               Pem.
               Interre theſe thoughts, this is her fathers tent.
               Drum, giue a friendly ſummons to the King.
            
            
               Fer.
               Forbeare a while (deare Pembrooke:) by our vowes,
               Which in the booke of heauen are regiſtred,
               By all the rightes of friendſhip, by that loue
               Thou bearſt thy natiue Countrey, I coniure thee,
               This day to be the Trumpet of my worth,
               To ſpeake the paſsions of thy grieued friend,
               To Katharines eares, till thoſe pure Iuory gates,
               Pearſt with the volley of thy battring words,
               Giue way to my laments to touch her heart:
               For this haue I extracted the from many,
               Made thee my fellow Pilgrim to her ſhrine,
               
                  Knowing thy thoughts from loues Religion free,
               When my prayers fayle, thy tongue may plead for me.
            
            
               Pem.
               Muſt I be ſpokesman? Pembrooke plead for loue?
               Whoſe toung tunde to the Inſtruments of war,
               Neuer knew ſtraine of fancy on my breath:
               Affection neuer dwelt, but war and death.
               But if thou lou'dſt to haue thy ſoldiers fight,
               Or hearten the ſpent courages of men,
               
                  Pembrooke could vſe a ſtile inuincible.
               Lou'dſt thou a towne, Ide teach thee how to woo her,
               With words of thunder-bullets wrapt in fire,
               Till with thy Cannon battry ſhe relent,
               And humble her proud heart to ſtoop to thee.
               Or if not this, then mount thee on a Steed,
               Whoſe courage neuer awde an yron Bit,
               And thou ſhalt heare me hollow to the beaſt,
               And with commaunding accents maſter him:
               This Courtſhip Pembrooke knowes; but idle loue,
               The ſlicke-fac't obiect of an amorous brayne,
               Did neuer clothe mine eye-balls, neuer taught
               This toung inurde to broyles and ſtratagems,
               The paſſionate language of a troubled heart:
               I am too blunt and rude for ſuch nice ſeruice.
               Yet ſince my friend inioynes me to this taske,
               Take courage, ile both ſpeake, plead, woo for thee,
               And when I want fit words to moue her mind,
               Ile draw my ſword, and ſweare ſhe muſt be kind.
               Drummer report our preſence to the King.

               After, to banquet, and from thence to woo.

Exeunt,
               
            
            
               Enter Katharina, her man Bowyer, and a Paynter.
            
            
               Kath.
               See that the Tent be ready furniſhed.
               By this, my father and thoſe Lords are met,
               Mongſt whom, the noble Pembrooke, like the Sunne.
               Out-ſhines the borrowed glory of the reſt:
               And well I may compare him to the Sunne,
               That but once lookt vpon with his fayre ſhape,
               Hat dazled my poore ſences, and left me blind.
               But ſirra, where's the man I bade you bring?
            
            
               Bow.
               If you can iudge of colours (Madam) this is he.
               Paynter, ſtand forth.
            
            
               Kath.
               An earneſt cauſe (my friend) importunes me,
               Wherein I am to craue thy cunningſt Arte.
            
            
               Payn.
               Such as it is, you may commaund, faire Princeſſe.
            
            
               Kath.
               But are thy colours freſh? thy penſill ſmoothe?
               Thy hand vnwauering? and thy head diſlodg'd
               Of all vnquiet harſh incumbrances?
               For thou muſt draw proportion of thoſe parts,
               Whoſe worth to tell, my toung wants vtterance.
            
            
               Payn.
               Feare you not (Madam) I am well prepar'd.
            
            
               Kat.
               Then hither ſtrait with youthfull Ferdinand,
               
               
                  Nauars ſtout ſonne, there comes an Engliſh Knight,
               
                  Pembrooke they call him, honourably borne:
               Him (whilſt we are in conference) thou ſhalt marke,
               And to the life ſet downe his counterfet.
               
                  Nor is it needfull I ſhould ſhew him thee,
               The goodlieſt perſon in the traine, that's he.
            
            
               Bow.
               Let me alone to giue the Paynter deſtruction, I know him as well as the Begger knowes his diſh: he weares a white Scarfe in his hat, and an Orange tawny feather vpon his arme.
            
            
               Kath.
               Foole, indirectly thou deſcrib'ſt another:
               Thats Prince Nauar, Pembrooke his plume is Azure,
               A little intermixt with ſpotleſſe white,
               Prefiguring the temper of the Sky,
               With whoſe hye motion his great mind doth moue.
            
            
               Bow.
               Orange tawny and Azure, all's one, all is but feather, there is no difference I am ſure but in colour.
            
            
               Kath.
               Why, thats as much as may be, is it not?
            
            
               Bow.
               Not ſo, ile proue the contrary: You are fayre, and I am foule, is that all the difference betweene you and I? there's another thing in it, if you marke it well.
            
            
               Kath.
               I prythee peace, and with thy ignorance
               Draw not the Paynter likewiſe into errour.
               Here take thy ſtand, thou knowſt him by theſe markes
               I lately ſpake of: ſeeme to excell thine Arte,
               And I will ſtudy to requite thy paynes.
            
            Enter Lewes, Ferdinand, Pembrooke, Rodoricke, and Flaunders.
            
               Lew.
               Thus did the Greeks, when they begirt the walles
               Of ſtrong built Troy, ſometimes with friendly cheeke
               Entertayne peace, and ſpend their frollick houres,
               In courtly feaſting of each other foe.
               Welcome (young Ferdinand) I promiſe you,
               It cheeres my ſpirit we doe imbrace you here,
               And welcome too (braue Lord) we cannot ſay,
               As if we were in Paris; we might ſay,
               Your viands ſhall be coſtly: but preſume,
               Such as the Camp affords, weele haue the beſt.
               Daughter, I prythee bid▪ them welcome.
            
            
               
               Kath.
               My Lord, I doe
               That with the Congy of a bended knee:
               But this with my true hearts loyalty.
               Lords, you are welcome, by my fathers leaue.
            
            
               Lew.
               Why, now thou doſt content thy father, Kate,
               
               When wholy vnto merryment inclin'd,
               Thou anſwerſt with like ſimpathy of mind.
            
            
               Fer.
               But yet her lookes are haggard and obſcure,
               Which makes me doubtfull ſheele not ſtoop to lure.
            
            
               Lew.
               Princes, let's enter: come, Ile lead the way▪
               
               The feaſt is mine, you are my gheſts this day.
            
            
               Fer.
               Now Pembrooke, ſhew thy friendſhips true effect,
               Obtayne her loue, my life thou ſhalt protect.
Exeunt.

               Fayre Madam, in this confluence of ſweet ioy,

               I am not (Sir) alone, nor do I ſtarue
               My appetite with any wil-full faſt,
               I haue a banquet of ſweet pleaſing thoughts,
               That is more precious then the coſtlieſt feaſt.

               But at your fathers boord there ſits a gheſt,

               Yes, Madam, I haue heard when Ferdinand,

               Couch his ſtaffe Launce with ſuch dexterity,
               As if the god of battell had himſelfe
               Entred the Liſts, and preaſſing to the midſt
               Of ſteele-compoſed troops, like lightning fly,

               So puiſſant in his fortitude with men,

               How can that be?
            
            
               Pem.
               Yes, when you weygh the force
               Of your reſiſtleſſe and controwling beauty,
               It is your beauty: were his power and ſpirit
               Ten times more hauty ventrous then it is,
               Compels it ſtoope in homage to your foot,
               As trembling Lambs, when they to Lions couch.

               Yes, for your ſake we haue indur'd his name;
               And for your ſake we tolerate his ſuite:
               But when you ceaſe to ſpeake, then all that prayſe
               You haue attributed to his deſert,
               Seemes borrowed from your ſelfe, you are the man
               Whoſe eloquence compares with Ciceroes.
               
               You are the man, whoſe knightly fortitude
               Liues in the world vnpreiudic'd of any.

               Pet.
               Here is the key that opens to the Tent,
               I ſtole it from my ſweet heart Thomaſin.
               Enter without prolixity, woo and winne the Lady:
               But giue me gold (my Lord) and Ile to Dice▪
               
            
            
               Bur.
               Hold, take thy fill.
            
            
               Pet.
               And it ſhall goe as faſt.
            
            
               Bur.
               Now gentle Peter, get thee vnto reſt:
               
                  My buſineſſe craues the abſence of the world:
               None but my ſelfe and Rodoricke ſhall behold
               The ſecret complot that I doe intend.
            
            
               Pet.
               I goe, my Lord.
Exit.
               
            
            
               Burb.
               Now bleſſed key, open vnto my loue,
               Doe more then louing lynes or words can doe:
               My letters haue bin anſwerd with diſdayne:
               Her father I haue mou'd to gayne my 
                     •
                  oue,
               But he is froſty in my feruent ſuite,
               And now perforce I will obtayne my loue,
               Or eaſe her puling hatred by reuenge.
            
            
               Ro.
               You ſtay too long, ile help to turne the key.
            
            Diſcouer her ſitting in a chayre aſleepe.
            
               Bur.
               What do I ſee? the maieſty of heauen,
               Sit in a mayden ſlumber on the earth?
               What, is my Bellamira turnd a goddeſſe,
               Within the table of her glorious face!
               Me thinks, the pure extraction of all beauty
               Flowes in abundance to my loue-ſicke eye.
               O, Rodoricke, ſhe is admirably fayre:
               And ſleeping, if her beauty be ſo rare,
               How will her eyes inchaunt me if ſhe wake!
               Here, take the poyſon, ile not ſtayne that face,
               For all the treaſure of the Weſterne Iland.
            
            
               Rod.
               I ſee no ſuch admired perfection.
               Waken her, Burbon, and this louing charme,
               Which now hath led your ſences priſoner,
               Will vaniſh, and her ſpeach full of reproofe,
               Beget a new phantaſma all of hate:
               Thou wilt deteſt her when 
                     •
                  he ſhall deny thee.
            
            
               Bur.
               Wakē her, Rodorick, for I want the power.
            
            
               Rod.
               I hope I am diſguiſde ſufficiently,
               That Bellamira cannot know my face.
               Madam, fayre Bellamira.
            
            
               Bel.
               Here I am, who calls on Bellamira?
            
            
               Burb.
               I, fayre loue,
               The Luke of Burbon that doth honour thee.
            
            
               
               Bel.
               The Duke of Burbon in my Tent ſo late▪
               
               Where is my Gard? what Peter, Thomaſin.
            
            
               Rod.
               Step to her, and reſtrayne her, leſt ſhe call:
               Ile be a looker on, and be vnknowne.
            
            
               Bur.
               What needs your Highneſſe call for any gard,
               Since you are garded with a faythfull friend?
               Behold me, Madam, humbly on my knee,
               Come to renew my ſuite, vouchſafe me loue,
               Or with this weapon take away my life:
               Much better 'twere a thouſand times to dye,
               Then liue in torment of your ſcorching eye.
               You haue inflam'd my heart, oh quench that flame,
               Or into cinders turne my hapleſſe truncke:
               Hapleſſe, in being vnbelou'd of you.
            
            
               Bell.
               My Lord of Burbon, you preſume too much
               On th'extremity of paſſion.
               Haue I not anſwerd many an idle letter,
               With full aſſurance that I cannot loue?
               Haue I not often, viua voce checkt
               Your courtly kindnes? frownd vpon your ſmiles▪
               
               Vſde you vnkindly, all to weane your loue?
               And doe you ſtill perſeuer in your ſuite?
               I tell thee, Burbon, this bold part of thine,
               To breake into my Tent at dead of night,
               Deſerues ſeuere correction, and the more,
               Becauſe it brings mine honour into queſtion.
               I charge thee, as thou art a Gentleman,
               Betake thee to thine owne Pauilion,
               And let this anſwere ſatisfie for all:
               Burbon, I cannot, nor I will not loue thee.
            
            
               Bur.
               Cannot, nor wil not? zoūds, Madam, but you muſt.
            
            
               Bel.
               Muſt I?
            
            
               Bur.
               And ſhall.
            
            
               Bel.
               You will not force me to it?
            
            
               Bur.
               Or force that ſparkling beauty from your face.
               Looke not ſo fiercely, nor cry out for helpe:
               For if you doe, this makes you cry your laſt.
               
                  Seing neyther words, kind letters, hearty ſighes,
               Humble intreaty, nor a world of payne,
               Can moue you to take pitty of my loue:
               But Tyrant-like, your beauty ſeeks my life,
               I will blot out that beauty with this iuice.
               Thus, thus I wipe away my paſſions:
               Thus doe I heale the torments of my loue:
               Thus doe I ranſome my inthralled eye,
               And by depriuing of the cauſe of life,
               Kill th'effect, which was a world of ſorrow.
               Farewell, foule Bellamira, I am pleaſde
               In this reuenge, that no way could be eaſde.
Exit.
               
            
            
               Rod.
               Zounds, he has don't: now, Rodorick, ioy thy fill▪
               
               Burbon is thine, the Dukedome is thine owne:
               For onely he in the Inheritance
               Stood as an obſtacle, to let my clayme.
               This deed of his will take away his life:
               And then let me alone to inioy his land.
               Ile ſteale away vnſeene, cauſe vnſuſpected:
               I would not for the world be once detected.
Exit.

               Poyſon my face! oh moſt inhumane wretch▪
               
               Reuenge more vile, then to abbridge my life▪
               
               What, Thomaſin, what, brother Ferdinand:
               My kingly father: is there none that heares?
               Then Treaſon, treaſon, let that waken you:
               For capitall is this offence to me.
            
            Enter Nauar, Pembrooke, Ferdinand, and Thomaſin.
            
               Tho.
               O Ieſu, miſtris, what ayles your face!
            
            
               Nau.
               Her face!
            
            
               Ferd.
               Tis ſpotted like a Panthers skin.
            
            
               Pemb.
               O, were thoſe ſpots as kindly beautifull,
               Then were fayre Bellamira vndeform'd.

               O, what diuine power hath ſent this Leproſy?
            
            
               Ferd.
               Say, beautious ſiſter.
            
            
               
               Pemb.
               Speake, fayre Bellamira.
            
            
               Tho.
               Speake, my good miſtris.
            
            
               Nau.
               My ſweet daughter, ſpeake.
            
            
               Pem.
               Her ſilence argues a tormented ſpirit.
            
            
               Fer.
               Thy countenance argues a deceitful ſoule.
            
            Enter Lewes, Philip, Rodoricke, and Flaunders.
            
               Lew.
               Where is Nauar?
            
            
               Phil.
               Where is fayre Bellamira?
            
            
               Bel.
               My Philip, oh giue leaue to fly his ſight.
            
            
               Nau.
               Stay, gentle daughter▪ heele not iniure thee.
            
            
               Lew.
               Heere are the Articles concluded on,
               I could not reſt, till I had ſigned them,
               And brought them to your Highneſſe. A moneth hence
               The mariage ſhall be fully ſolemnized,
               So pleaſe your Maieſty and your fayre daughter:
               Are you content?
            
            
               Nau.
               To liue in diſcontent.
            
            
               Phil.
               Me thinks, this royall preſence hath dim lookes:
               Is it becauſe they are in the armes of night,
               Which ſets a leaden luſtre on the eye?
               Or hath ſome accident occoaſted them,
               That troubles their aſpect with melancholy?
               Is Nauar well? is Ferdinando well?
               Is Pembrooke well? Is Bellamira well?
               O, where is Bellamira? tell me, Princes,
               For now my tongue hath ſtrook vpon her name.
               I feele a kind of killing extaſie.
               Where is ſhe? in her Tent?
            
            
               Bel.
               Deny me, father,
               I would not ſee Prince Philip with this face.
            
            
               Phi.
               Why ſpeak you not? what, haue I toucht the ſtring,
               Whereon the burden of your ſorrow lyes?
               Father, looke round about, ſee you my loue?
               Rodoricke, looke round about, ſee you my loue?
            
            
               Lew.
               I ſee her not.
            
            
               Rod.
               Nor I.
            
            
               Phil.
               I ſay not ſo.
               
                  The garments that ſhe weares, mine eye ſhould know.
               What Lady's this that hides her heauenly face?
               Here are no Baſilisks with killing eyes:
               You need not hide your beauty: ſweet, looke vp,
               Me thinks I haue an intereſt in theſe lookes.
               What's here, a Leper amongſt Noblemen?
               What creatures this? why ſtayes ſhe in this place?
               Oh, tis no maruell though ſhe hide her face:
               For tis infectuous: let her leaue the preſence,
               Or Leproſie will cleaue vnto vs all.
            
            
               Bel.
               O let me leaue the preſence, gentle father,
               When Philip bids his Bellamira goe.
            
            
               Phil.
               My Bellamira!
            
            
               Lew.
               How? my ſonnes belou'd!
            
            
               Phil.
               Is this my loue? was this your beauteous child?
            
            
               Nau.
               My child.
            
            
               Ferd.
               My ſiſter.
            
            
               Pemb.
               Beauteous Bellamira.
            
            
               Nau.
               Spotted.
            
            
               Ferd.
               Diſfigured.
            
            
               Pemb.
               Made a lothſome Leper.
            
            
               Rod.
               How came this ſudden alteration?
               For ſhe was comely, louely, beautifull,
               When the day left his Charriot to the night.
            
            
               Na.
               That heauen doth know, and onely Bellamira.
               Daughter, I charge thee, tell me how it came.
            
            
               Bell.
               Burbon, oh Burbon.
            
            
               Lew.
               Did he doe the deed?
            
            
               Bel.
               He came into my Tent at dead of night,
               And rubd my face with an infectuous herbe,
               Becauſe I would not graunt vnto his loue.
               I cry'd for helpe, but none did ſuccour me.
            
            
               Rod.
               I know he did, and laugh to thinke on't.

                  A countenance fayrer then Auroraes lookes,
               When all the Eaſt is guilded with her bluſh▪

               And, ſhould I now forſake her thus diſtreſt,
               I could not merit a true Louers name.
               To ſhew I loue her, I will marry her,
               Before the moneth expire: nay in the morne:
               Delayes, perchance, may make her think I ſcorne.

               Oh, I deteſt my ſelfe: Deare, hate me too:
               I am not to be maryed but to death.
               Though I were Empreſſe of the ſpacious world,
               Ide lay my ſelfe and Kingdome at thy feet.
               Liue, noble Philip, ioyſome happyer match:

               Thinkſt thou, becauſe thy face is ſpotted ſo,
               Thou art not worthy of thy Philips loue?
               Thy face to me was but a Marſhall,
               To lodge thy ſacred perſon in my mind,
               Which long agoe is ſurely chambred there:
               And now what needs an outward Harbinger?
               I doe affect, not ſuperficially:
               My loue extendeth further then the skin.
               The inward Bellamira tis I ſeeke,
               And vnto her will Philip be epouſde.

               To wed himſelfe to my vnworthy ſelfe,
               It would be counted vertue in the Prince;

               No, Philip, no, thou ſhalt not wrong thine honour,
               Nor be impeacht by Bellamiraes ſpots.

               Tis true, they are gone together, and I am ſent to watch Prince Ferdinand, and the Earle of Pembrooke: this way they went; but they are got out of ſight. I were very bad to be a Hound, that haue no better a ſent: if they were hares, as they are men, I ſhould think them ſquatted: but huſht, here comes one of them.
            
            Enter Ferdinand.
            
               Ferd.
               The morne lookes red: red mornes doe threat a ſtorme,
               That ſtorme ſhall light on Pembrooke or my ſelfe.
               This is our meeting place: here runnes the ſtreame
               That parts our camps: the time conſorts the place;
               And (Pembrooke) if thy reputation hold,
               It is thy q. to enter.
Enter Pembrooke.

               Haue ſtumbled in a playne and euen way,
               My ſword forſooke his ſcabberd once or twice,
               Bloud from my noſtrilles thrice hath ſpowted forth,
               And ſuch a dymneſſe ouerrunnes my ſight,
               That I haue tane a tree to bee a man,
               And queſtion'd with it about ſerious things▪
               
               This is the place where I muſt meet my friend.
               Yonder he ſtands▪ Good morrow, Ferdinand.

               Good morrow to thy death: draw, Pēbrook, draw,
               The ground thou treadſt vpon, muſt be thy graue.
            
            
               Pem.
               Draw vpon Ferdinand?
            
            
               Fer.
               I, vpon me.
               Dally not, Pembrooke, I am bent to fight,
               And that with thee for the beſt blood thou bearſt.
            
            
               Pem.
               You haue ſome reaſon for this reſolution.

               Pem.
               A ſorry argument to kill your friend.
               I muſt haue better reaſon then your will,
               Or ile not draw vpon my Ferdinand:
               Our loue is older then of one dayes growth,
               A yeres continuance hath vnited vs.
               Haue we not made an enterchange of othes,
               Sworne loue to one another twenty times,
               Confirmd that friendſhip by ſociety,
               Encreaſde it with the ſimpathy of mind,
               Making one pleaſure, pleaſure vnto both?
               And ſhall this bond be broken vpon will?
            
            
               Fer.
               Then youle not draw?
            
            
               Pem.
               Yes, neerer to thy perſon,
               In friendly ſort to imbrace thee, Ferdinand.
            
            
               Fer.
               Thou art a coward, and thou dar'ſt not fight.
            
            
               Pem.
               Thou knowſt the contrary: for we haue fought
               At euery weapon, to approue our skill.
            
            
               Fer.
               Goe to, you are a villayne and a coward,
               And by the royall bloud that gaue me life,
               Ile kill thee, Pembrooke, though thou do not draw.
            
            
               Pem.
               Kill me? thou wilt not wrong thine honour ſo?

               Pem.
               Wound me ſo deſperately? nay then ile draw,
               Not to offend, but to defend my ſelfe.
               Now I perceyue it is my bloud thou ſeekſt:
               Witneſſe you heauens, and all you gracious powers,
               That ſtand auſpicious to this enterpriſe,
               That Pembrooke drawes forth an vnwilling ſword.
            
            
               Fer.
               Why ſo, now manfully defend thy ſelfe.
            
            
               
               Pem.
               Another woūd? then Pembrook, rowſe thy ſpirit,
               And beare no longer with this haire-braynd man.
               Yet (Ferdinand) reſolue me of the cauſe,
               That moues thee to this vnkind enterpriſe:
               And if I ſatiſfie thee not in words,
               This double wound ſhall pleaſe thee with my bloud.
               Nay, with my ſword Ile make a ſcore of wounds,
               Rather then want of bloud diuorce thy loue.
            
            
               Fer.
               I hate thee deadly, and I ſeeke thy life:
               What other reaſon, Pembrook, wouldſt thou haue?
               Prepare, prepare, in this conflict to

               Pem.
               And if I ſpare thee not, impute the cauſe
               To thine owne raſhnes, and mine aking wounds.
            
            Fight, and hurt eche other, both fall downe as dead.
            
               Fer.
               I hope I haue ſlayne thee.
            
            
               Pem.
               Oh, I feare thy life: how fares my Ferdinand?
            
            
               Fer.
               What, liu'ſt thou yet? then my fare is ill.
            
            
               Pem.
               I am markt for death,
               I feele a generall fayntneſſe through my lymmes:
               Expence of bloud will ſoone expend my life.
            
            
               Fer.
               The like debility my ioynts doe feele.
            
            
               Pem.
               Then we muſt both dye in the lateſt of death.
               Tell me, oh tell me, whence proceeds this hate?
            
            
               Fer.
               I feare not (Pembrooke) to diſcouer now.
               Thou wert my Spokeſ-man vnto Katharine,
               And treacherouſly thou ſtol'ſt away her heart.
               Oh, I can ſay no more, my ſpirits doe faynt.
               Pembrooke, farewell, I haue reueng'd my wrong.
            
            
               Pem.
               Oh▪ yet a little longer, gracious time,
               Detayne his princely ſpirit to his breſt,
               That I may tell him he is miſſe-inform'd,
               And purge my ſelfe vnto my dying friend:
               But death hath layd his num-cold hand vpon me:
               I am arreſted to depart this life.
               Deare Ferdinand, although thou be my death,
               
                  On thee ile friendly breathe my lateſt breath.
            
            Enter Forreſter.
            
               For.
               How full of pleaſure is this Forreſt life!
               My Parke I liken to a Common wealth,
               In which, my Bucks and Does are Citizens:
               The Hunters Lodge, the Court, from whence is ſent
               Sentence of life or death, as pleaſe the King:
               Onely our gouernment's a tyranny,
               In that wee kill our ſubiects vpon ſport.
               But ſtay, what Gentlemen doe heere lye ſlayne▪
               
               If any ſparke of life doe yet remayne,
               Ile helpe to fanne it with a nymble hand:
               The Organ of his arme doth play apace,
               He is not ſo far ſpent, but that with helpe,
               He may recouer to his former ſtate.
               How is the other? I doe feele ſoft breath

               To beare them to the Forreſt, to my Lodge:
               But as I am, ile try my vtmoſt ſtrength,
               To ſaue their liues: firſt ſeene, ſhall be the firſt:

               Fiſher.
               My angle-rod is broke, my ſport is done;
               But I will fetch my net, to catch ſome fiſh:
               To loſe both fiſh and pleaſure, is too much.
               Oh what contentment liues there in the brooke!
               What prety traines are made by cunning hands,
               To int

               Sleepſt thou? or art thou ſlaine? hath breath his laſt?
               No ſparke of life appeares: yet from his eye,
               Me thinks I ſee a glymmering light breake ſorth,
               Which wanting ſtrength, is like a twilight glimſe.
               If there be any hope to ſaue his life,
               Ile try my vtmoſt cunning. To my houſe,
               Poore Getleman, Ile beare thee as a gheſt,
               And eyther cure thy wounds, or make thy graue.

               Thou angreſt me, with ieſting at my ſorrow:
               Hence from my ſight, my heart is full of griefe,
               And it will breake, the burthen is ſo great.
            
            
               Clow.
               Goe from your ſight? then let me goe out of your company: for I had as leeue leaue your ſight as your company. Is this my reward for watching and watching? Oh Miſtris, doe not kill mee with vnkindneſſe: I ſhall, I ſhall —

               I prythee leaue me, I am not diſpleaſd,
               But fayne would vent my ſorrowe from my heart.
               Hold, take my purſe, ſpend that, and leaue my preſence:
               Go euery where, enquire my Pembrooke out:
               And if thou bringſt me to his breathleſſe truncke,
               I will reward thee with a treble gift.
            
            
               Clow.
               Well, I were beſt bee going, now I am ſo fayrely offred. Miſtris, your reward hath ſtopt my teares, and entic'de my legges to be walking. Farewell, I will goe, God knowes whither, to ſeeke and to finde both, and neyther. Farewell, ſweet Miſtris.

               I vow to dye with thee: this field, this groue
               Shall be my receptacle till my laſt:
               Content with that that feeds the ayry ſoules,
               My pillow ſhall be made a banke of moſſe,
               And what I drinke, the ſiluer brooke ſhall yeeld.

               She grieu'd to tye you to a hated bed,
               And therefore followed Burbon for reuenge.
            
            
               Phil.
               Burbon? who names him? that ſame verball ſound
               Is like a thunderclap to Philips cares,
               Frighting my very

               And to that prodegie you ioynd reuenge:
               Reuenge, that like a ſhaddow followes him.
               'Twas he that made me bankrout of all bliſſe,
               Sude the diuorce of that pure white and red,
               Which deckt my Bellamiraes louely cheeks:
               And ſhall he ſcape vnpuniſht?

               Phil.
               Not for the world: who proſecutes his hate
               On Burbon, iniures me: I am his foe,
               And none but I will worke his ouerthrow.
            
            
               Lew.
               What meanes our ſonne?

               The darkeſt angle of this vniuerſe,
               Shall not contayne him through the bounded world:
               Ile proſecute his flight with ceaſleſſe ſteps:
               And when long trauell makes them dull or faynt,
               Bayting them freſh with Bellamiraes wrongs,
               Like Eagles they ſhall cut the flaxen ayre,
               And in an inſtant bring me where he is.
            
            
               Lew.
               Where goes our ſonne?

               To hell, ſo that in that kingdome,
               Fate would aſſertayne me to meet with Burbon.
               Where euer I confront him, this ſhall kill him.

               Hee's ſlaine by Pembrokes hands,
               And Pembroke left breathles by Ferdinand.
               Their quarrell is vncertain, and their bodies
               By ſome vnciuill hands conuayed away,
               And no inquiry can diſcouer them.

               Who doth report he heard a wretched Lady

               That was my child dishonor'd by thy ſonne.

Enter Kathar.
               
               Thou ſendſt a woman to incounter me.

               And no diſpoſer of my Chriſtian hopes:
               But ſoft, I know that face: oh! I, tis ſhe
               Was vniuſt cauſe of all this miſery.
            
            
               Kath.
               Long haue I wandred with vnquiet mind,
               To find my Pembrook: that they fought, I heare:
               That they were wounded both to death, I heare:
               But whether cur'de or dead, I cannot heare:
               Nor liues there any (if deceaſde) can tell,
               Within what place their bodies are interr'd.
               Since therefore all my trauell is in vayne,
               Here will I take a truce with former care.
               This curſed nooke was that vnlucky plot,
               Where curſed Ferdinand did kill my Loue.
               What Knight is this? ile queſtion him, perhaps
               He can reſolue me where my Pembroke is:
               Ioy and good fortune, ſir, attend your ſtate.
            
            
               Pem.
               Your wiſhes come too late.
               VVhat ſeeke you, Madam?
            
            
               Kath.
               Tel me, ſir knight, for ſo you ſeeme to be:
               Know you this diſmall place you do frequent?
               Or haue you heard of that vnhappy fight,
               VVas here perform'd by Pembrook and his foe?
            
            
               Pem.
               Yes, Madam, I haue heard of it long ſince,
               And, to my griefe, knew both the Gentlemen.
            
            
               Kat.
               But can you tell me if they liue or no?
               Or dead, what hand hath giuen them buryall?
            
            
               
               Pem.
               Reſt you aſſured, Madam, they are dead:
               The one of them to whom I was allyed,
               And neerely knit in friendſhip from my youth,
               By me lyes buried heere: a brauer Knight,
               And truer Louer neuer breathd in Fraunce.
            
            
               Kath.
               O tell me, is it Pembrooke? if for him
               You haue erected this fayre monument,
               Perpetuall honour I will doe your ſtate.
            
            
               Pem.
               Not only, Madam, haue I built this tombe
               In his memoriall: but my ſelfe haue ſworne
               Continuall reſidence within this Wood:
               And for the loue I bare him, weare theſe armes,
               That whatſoeuer Knight, aduenturer or other,
               Making his iourney this way, and refuſing
               To do Knights homage to my breathleſſe friend,
               By this aſſayling ſteele may be compeld.
            
            
               Kath.
               Oh, let me know your name, ſo kindly mou'd,
               To dignifie my Pembrookes high deſerts.
            
            
               Pem.
               You did not heare me ſay'twas Pēbrook, Madam▪
               
               What is become of him, I doe not know,
               Nor greatly care, ſince he did wrong my friend,
               And firſt in kindled this diſſenſious brawle.
               This buryed here, is noble Ferdinand,
               His fathers comfort, and his Countryes hope.
               Oh Madam! had you ſeene him as I did,
               Begirt with wounds, that like ſo many mouthes,
               Seem'd to complayne his timeleſſe ouerthrow:
               And had before bin inward with his vertues,
               To thinke that nature ſhould indure ſuch wracke,
               And at one time ſo many precious gifts
               Periſh by death, would haue diſſolu'd your heart.
               He was the very pride of fortitude,
               The houſe of vertue, and true frendſhips mirrour:
               Looke on his picture, in the armes of death,
               When he was ready to giue vp the ghoſt,
               I cauſde it to be drawne: if at that time,
               In that extremity of bitter pangs,
               
                  He lookt ſo louely, had ſo freſh a colour,
               So quick a mouing eye, ſored a lip,
               What was his beauty when he was in health?
               See with what courage he indur'd the combat,
               Smiling at death for all his tyranny.
               Had death bin ought but what he was, ſterne death▪
               
               He would haue bin enamour'd with his looks▪
               
            
            
               Kath.
               A certayne ſoft remorce
               Creeps to my heart, perſwades me he was true,
               Louing, and vertuous: but my ſelfe vnkind,
               Coyly to ſcorne the proffer of his mind.
            
            
               Pem.
               O that in Iuſtice of her former hate,
               She now would hopeleſſe doate on Ferdinand!
               Ile do the beſt I can to bring her on:
               Deſpaire and madneſſe, fetch her off againe.
               Madam, how ſay you? waſt not a grieuous thing,
               So rich a Iem, ſhould lye rak't vp in duſt?
               So ſweet a flower, be withred in his prime?
            
            
               Kath.
               Death was a villayne for attempting it,
               And ſo was Pembrooke for effecting it.
               No bloudy Scythian, or inhumane Turke,
               But would ha trembled to ha toucht his skin,
               Or ſpilt one drop of his Heroick bloud.
            
            
               Pem.
               Had not that Lady then an yron heart?
               A rude ingratefull mind? a ſauadge ſpirit?
               That knew this vertuous honourable Knight,
               This gracious ſhape, and vnmatcht excellence,
               To be intangled with her feruent loue,
               To ſerue her in all loyalty of heart,
               To reuerence and adore her very name,
               To be content to kiſſe the lowly earth,
               Where ſhe did ſet her foot: and when he ſued
               For grace, to ſcorne him, to deride his ſighes,
               And hold his teares and torment in contempt?
               Of all that euer liu'd, deſeru'd ſhe not,
               The worlds reproch, and times perpetuall blot?
            
            
               Kat.
               Heard you him euer ſpeak of ſuch a one?
            
            
               
               Pem.
               Oft times: but chiefly then, when he perceyu'd,
               His hurt was mortall, and no way but death.
               At euery groane, he cald vpon her name,
               As if that ſound were preſent remedy:
               And when inſulting death drew ſhort his breath,
               And now was ready to cloſe vp his eyes:
               Farewell, quoth he, where e're I find a ſhrine,
               My ſoule fly thou to beautious Katharine.
            
            
               Kat.
               That ruthleſſe mind, that iron ſauage heart,
               So greatly loued, and ſo little louing,
               Breathes in this breſt, 'twas I returnd diſdaine,
               For deepe affection; ſcorne for loyalty:
               And now compaſſionleſſe ſhall pine my ſelfe.
               Oh Ferdinand, forgiue me, Ferdinand:
               Inioyne me any penance for that wrong;
               Say I ſhall tread a tedious pilgrimage
               To furtheſt Paleſtine, and I will do it.
               But peace, fond womā, theſe exclaimes are vaine:
               Thy Ferdinand is dead and cannot heare,
               As thou waſt ſomtimes deafe, and wouldſt not heare.
            
            
               Pemb.
               A iuſt reward. Come, Madam, haue you done?
               Giue me the picture I may hang it vp.
            
            
               Kath.
               Oh take it not away: ſince I haue loſt
               The ſubſtance, ſuffer me to keepe the ſhaddow:
               Me thinks, ſo long as this is in my hand,
               I claſpe my Ferdinand betweene mine armes:
               So long as I behold this liuely forme,
               So long am I refreſhed by his ſmiles:
               So long, me thinks, I heare him ſpeake to me.
               Knew I the Paynter drew this counterfeyt,
               I would reward him with a mynt of gold.
            
            
               Pem.
               If ſuch a pleaſure you receyue by this,
               I tell you, Madam, I ſhall ſhortly haue
               His whole proportion cut in Alablaſter,
               Armd as he was when he encountred here,
               Which kneeling, ſhall be ſet vpon his tombe.
            
            
               Kath.
               On that condition I will gather flowers,
               
                  And once a day come ſtraw them at his feet:
               And once a day pay tribute of choyce thanks▪
               
               To you the furtherer of my happineſſe:
               Till then, I place the picture where it was.
            
            Enter Clowne, and Bellamira.
            
               Clow.
               Come on, Madam, me thinks now a maske would do well: but I perceyue your drift, I ſmell your policy, you think a bald face hath no need of a black mask. Shall I tel you what you looke like? A broyld herring, or a tortur'de Image made of playſter worke.
            
            
               Bel,
               So, ſirra, you may ſcoffe my miſery.
            
            
               Pem.
               Still haunted with theſe women? are men vaniſht?
               Or what occaſion leaues the Realme of Fraunce,
               So voyd and empty of aduenturous Knights?
            
            
               Clow.
               Out of peraduenture, Madam, the ghoſt of Saint George is come out of England, to ſee what hoſpitality S. Denis keeps in Fraunce.
            
            
               Pem.
               Poore Bellamira, I lament thy ſtate;
               But I muſt ſtill ſuppreſſe my diſcontent.
               What are you ſo deformd with lothſome ſpots?
               And what that Anticke keeps you company?
            
            
               Clow.
               Anticke! thou lyeſt, and thou wert a Knight of ginger-bread: I am no Anticke, the whole pariſh where I was borne will ſweare, that ſince the raigne of Charlemain there was not a better face bred or brought vp amongſt them.
            
            
               Pem.
               Away, ye ruſſeting.
            
            
               Kath.
               Haue patience, Knight, how euer thus deform'd,
               This Lady is the daughter of Nauar.
               Madam, it ioyes me I haue met you heere,
               Though much laments me of your heauy plight.
               There needs no repetition of your wrong:
               I know, the villayne Burbon did the deed,
               Whom my incenſed brother will reuenge.
            
            
               Bel.
               For Philips ſake I haue bin martyrd thus,
               And for his ſake left King and Courtly life,
               To entertayne a Pilgrims paynefull habit.
               But on what ſtrange aduenture ſtayes this Knight,
               
                  Within this deſolate forſaken wood?
            
            
               Kat.
               For loue of Ferdinand your princely brother,
               Whoſe Hearſe he gards in honourable Armes.
            
            
               Bel.
               Is this my brothers Hearſe? is this the place,
               Where I was ſhipwrackt of a brothers name?
               Oh, let me ſpend a louing ſigh for him,
               And ſacrifice a ſiſters holy rites:
               For euer reſt, ſweet Ferdinand, in peace,
               Vntill thy body glorified from heauen,
               Become immortall by thy ſoules returne.
            
            
               Pem.
               Poore Bellamira, how I pity thee!
               Yet muſt forbeare to comfort thy diſtreſſe.
            
            
               Clow.
               Is my yong Lord buried here? I ſay no more, but
               I pray God ſend him a ioyfull inſurrection.
            
            
               Kath.
               Inough, ſweet Bellamire,
               Theſe leprous ſpots, tis time they were remou'd.
               Come, goe with me. Since I left Aquitayne,
               And came acquaynted with theſe priuate walks,
               It was my happy chance to meet an Hermit,
               Whoſe skill in Phiſike warrants preſent cure,
               And pure refining of your poyſoned bloud:
               Ile bring you thither: afterward ſelect
               Delicious ſweets, to decke your brothers tombe.
               Come, ſirra, follow vs.
Exeunt.
               
            
            
               Clow.
               Doe not think, Madam, that ile forſake you. And ſo, ſir, you that walk in pewter veſſayle, like one of the worthyes, will you be rul'd by me?
            
            
               Pem.
               Wherein?
            
            
               Clow.
               To ſet a gyn for Woodcocks, & catch your ſelfe firſt.
Exit.
               
            
            
               Pem.
               Hence, beetle-head. And Pembrook, now bethink
               How great a tyde of miſeries breakes in.
               Firſt, thou art taxed with the loſſe of him,
               Whom equall with thy ſelfe thou holdeſt deare:
               Next, Bellamira is become a Leper,
               Whoſe abſence Philip carefully laments▪
               
               Then trecherous Burbon ioynes himſelfe with Fraunce,
               And both the Kings are angerly incenſt:
               
                  But laſt, which is ſome comfort to the reſt,
               Diſdaynfull Katharine waſtes with fruitleſſe loue.
               Would all ſo minded like miſhap might proue.
               But by this ſignall there are Knights at hand,
               I muſt prouide their valours to withſtand.
            
            Enter Fraunce, Burbon, Rodoricke, Peter de Lions, at one dore: at the other, Nauar, Flaunders, Dicke Bowyer, and Souldiers, Pembrooke betweene them.
            
               Pem.
               Stay your intended march.
            
            
               Lew.
               What Peere of Fraunce,
               Or in the world ſo haughty reſolute,
               Dare breathe the word of ſtay to mighty Fraunce?
            
            
               Na.

               A valiant Knight, his name, yong Ferdinand,

               My deareſt Ferdinand, I would my ſighes,
               Or ſad lamenting teares might haue the power,
               Like Balme to quicken thy benummed ioynts,
               Then would I drowne this marble e're I went,
               And heat it hote with vapour of my breath.

               Thou maiſt be guilty ſtil for ought I know:
               For though I find him dead, I find not yet
               The Tragick maner of his haples end.
               Thou mayſt as well haue murdred Ferdinand,

               Content thee, knight, Ile eaſe thee of that labor.
               To morrow is expir'd the time of truce.

               And I will meet with thee.

               Thus heady rage, blind in her raſh reſolue
               Drew Ferdinand and mee into the field,
               As now it doth theſe hot incenſed kings.
               Wer't not my vowes prohibit my deſire,
               To ſtay the inconuenience of this fight,
               I would diſcouer where their Daughters are,
               To ſhew the error they are ſhrouded in:
               But Time hath run a deſperate courſe with mee,
               And deſperate let them runne to miſery:
               Here comes a Straggler of their Army. Stand.
            
            Enter Philip.
            
               Phil.
               What voice is that preſumes to byd me ſtand?

               His that can force thee, if thou wilt not ſtand.
            
            
               Phil.
               By this bright ayre reflecteth on my ſword,
               If the whole Army of Nauar had ſaid
               As much to Philip, yet he would not ſtand.
               And thou but one, how dar'ſt thou profer it,
               Knowing how ſharp a Spurre doth pricke me on,
               The death of Burbon for my Bellamire?
            
            
               Pem.
               Hang vp thy ſhield, as other knights haue done,
               Vpon the Hearſe of noble Ferdinand,
               And thou mayeſt freely paſſe without controule.
            
            
               Phil.
               The Hearſe of Ferdinand! I honor him,
               He was the brother of my deareſt Loue,
               What's this I ſee? my fathers batterd ſhield!
               The ſhield of Fraunce! of Flaunders! Burbons too!
               
                  It can not then impeach or preiudice
               The name of Philip, to conſort with ſuch,
               Eſpecially being done for Ferdinand.
               There is my ſhield: and Knight, but for my haſte,
               I would expoſtulate of other things:
               But after traytrous Burbon I haue ſlayne,
               Knight, looke for me, ile viſit thee agayne.
               Now Rodorick, keepe thy word, and I am bleſt:
               But if thou fayle, ile forward with the reſt.
Exit.
               
            
            
               Pem.
               Succeſfull action ſit vpon thy ſword:
               This net of ſorrowes, I perceyue, intangles
               Not only Pembrooke, but the Court of France.
               Nauar and his aſſociats are all toucht.
               Time looke vpon vs, and at laſt determine,
               This heart-diſſeuering tumults with a peace.

               Ferd.
               Since▪ Ferdinand, by gracious prouidence,

               Reuiue the ancient paſſions of thy mind,
               Think on thy friend, on Pembrook take remorſe,
               Whoſe honord life, thy haſty hand cut off:
               This is the place, as I remember mee.
               Whats heere? a Tombe? who hath preuented me
               In my religious duty to my friend?
               You, Knight, I doubt not, can reſolue me.
            
            
               Pem.
               What art thou? ſtand.
            
            
               Ferd.
               A Knight, and fayne would know,
               What ſacred monument and Tombe this is?
            
            
               Pem.
               His, whilſt he liu'd, that of the worlds increaſe,
               Was the moſt loyall friend, and valiant Knight:
               Which thou muſt likewiſe ratifie with me,
               And hang thy ſhield vp to adorne his Hearſe,
               Or venture Combate for denying it.
            
            
               Fer.
               His name, I pray thee.

               Ferdinand.
            
            
               Fer.
               What's he acquainted with my name? belike ſome one
               
                  Lou'd Pembroke, and ſuppoſing (wrongfully)
               Me ſlaine by him, to ſatiſfie for that,
               Obſerues this honor in my memory:
               Be not thou Ferdinand ingratefull then,
               But ſtand for Pembroke, as this knight for thee.
            
            
               Pem.
               What anſwere giueſt thou? ſhal I homage haue?
            
            
               Fer.
               Not for his ſake thou nam'ſt, not for Ferdinand:
               There liu'd a knight exceld his petty fame,
               As farre as coſtly Pearle the courſeſt Pebble:
               An Engliſh knight cald Pembroke, were his bones
               Interred heere, I would confeſſe of him
               Much more then thou requir'ſt, and be content
               To hang both ſhield and ſword vpon his Hearſe.
            
            
               Pem.
               How comes this ſtranger by my name? Belike
               He was affected vnto Ferdinand:
               And for his ſake (hearing he did me wrong)
               Couets to make amends, or meanes to prooue
               If I imbrace him with vnfayned loue.
               He ſhall not doubt of that, once more I ſay,
               'Twas Ferdinand was the renowned Knight
               Of all the world.
            
            
               Fer.
               But I deny that ſaying,
               Giuing to Pembroke that preeminence.
            
            
               Pem.
               For Ferdinand my valour will I try.
            
            
               Fer.
               In Pembrooks valour I will fight and die.
            
            Diſcouer eche other in fighting.
            
               Pem.
               Eyther I dreame, or this is Ferdinand.
            
            
               Fer.
               My ſight deludes me, or ſtout Pembroke lyues.
            
            
               Pem.
               Thrice happy honord, I do imbrace my friend.
            
            
               Fer.
               Welcome, oh welcome Pembrok, to myne armes,
               Whom I imagined, death had tane from me.
            
            
               Pem.
               The like did I by Princely Ferdinand:
               But that he liues, my ſoule confounds with ioy.
            
            
               Fer.
               Tell me, deare friend, ſince our vnlucky fight,
               Haue you heard ought of my diſdainfull Loue?
            
            
               Pem.
               Of her and all the reſt: Her father liues:
               This is his ſhield, and this is great Nauars:
               
                  This Rodoricks, the Duke of Orleance,
               And this malicious Burbons: all the which
               I forc't from them, to beautifie thy ſhrine.
               But tis of Katharine thou deſir'ſt to heare:
               She likewiſe hath bin here; her flinty heart,
               So much before inclind to cruelty,
               Now waxeth tender: ſhe no ſooner ſaw
               Thy picture here; but by heauens prouidence,
               Or how I know not, ſhe ſo doats on it,
               As I ſuppoſde ſhe would a dyed for loue.
            
            
               Fer.
               Has then my ſhaddow and ſuppoſed death
               Brought that to paſſe my liuing ſubſtance could not?
            
            
               Pem.
               It hath, and neuer Lady more enamour'd,
               Then now is Katharine of her Ferdinand.
               I told her, and no more then truth I told,
               A cunning Caruer had cut out thy ſhape
               And whole proportion in white Alablaſter,
               Which I intended here ſhould be ſet vp.
               She earneſtly entreated ſhe might haue
               A ſight of it, and dayly be permitted
               To deck thy tombe and ſtatue with ſweet flowers.
               Shee's but euen now departed to that end.
               And will (I know) be quickly here agayne.
               Now for aſſurance I diſſemble not,
               Inſtead of thy reſemblance cut in ſtone,
               Kneele here thy ſelfe, and heare her pitious mone.
            
            
               Fer.
               Content, I hold your counſell for the beſt:
               Weele once conclude our ſorrowes with a ieſt.
            
            
               Pem.
               Soft, there's a cuſhē: nay, you muſt be bare,
               And hold your hands vp, as the maner is.
            
            
               Fer.
               What if I held a booke, as if I prayed?
            
            
               Pem.
               'Twere beſt of all; and now I think vpon't,
               Here is a booke: ſo, keepe your countenance,
               You muſt imagine now you are tranſform'd.
               Yonder ſhe comes, in any caſe ſtir not.
            
            Enter Katharine.
            
               Kath.
               I feare I haue detracted time too long.
               
                  In my determinde ſeruice to my Loue:
               But Ile redeeme my fault with double care.
               See where his ſtatue is ſet vp: kind Knight,
               For euer Katharine will record thy truth.
            
            
               Pem.
               How ſay you, Madam, 1ſt not very like him?
            
            
               Kath.
               As like, as if it were himſelfe indeed.
               And would to God my prayers might be heard,
               That as the Image of Pigmalion once,
               Life might deſcend into this ſenceleſſe ſtone:
               But that was faynd, as my deſire is fond,
               Relentleſſe death withholds my Ferdinand;
               And no intreaty may recouer him.
               In token then I doe repent my ſcorne,
               That I was cruell to ſo kind a friend,
               Thou the preſenter of his abſent perſon,
               Receiue theſe ſweets, thy temples be adornd
               With this freſh garland; thy white Iuory hand
               Boaſt of this Ring, which if thou wert aliue,
               Should bind our faythes vp in a nuptiall knot:
               But for thou canſt not be reuiu'd agayne,
               Ile dwell with thee in death: and as my ſpirit
               Mounts to the happy manſion of thy ſpirit:
               So to accompany thy ſhaddow here,
               Ile turne my body to a ſhaddow too;
               And kneeling thus, confront thy ſilent lookes,
               With my ſad looks: this is the Inſtrument,
               Now Ferdinand, behold thy Katharine comes.
            
            
               Fer.
               And ſhe is welcome vnto Ferdinand.
            
            
               Pem.
               Ile play the clark for both, and ſay Amen.
               Nay, muſe not, Madam, tis no ſenceleſſe Image,
               But the true eſſence of your wiſhed Loue.
            
            
               Kath.
               I am aſham'd to looke him in the face.
            
            
               Fer.
               Hide not thoſe ſplendāt lights, hereafter be
               A conſtant wife, it ſhall ſuffice for me.
            
            
               Kat.
               Heauen caſt her off, if Katharine proue not ſo.
            
            
               Pem.
               Of that no more: now let vs haſte from hence,
               To quiet the diſſenſion lately ſprung
               
                  Betweene your parents, Philip likewiſe gone,
               To be reueng'd on Burbons trechery,
               Perhaps may ſtand in need of friendly ayd:
               To him and them our vowes muſt next be payd,
            
            
               Fer.
               What Pembrook counſels, we cōſent vnto.
Exeunt.
               
            
            Enter Rodericke and Philip.
            
               Rod.
               Now whileſt our Armies wearied with the heat
               That the bright ſunne caſts from his midday throne,
               Abſtayne from bloudy entercourſe of warre,
               Ile lead thee Philip vnto Burbons Tent.
            
            
               Phil.
               Rodoricke, thou highly fauoureſt me in this,
               And doubt not, if my complot take effect,
               Ile make thee Duke of Burbon.
            
            Enter Lewes, Flaunders, and Burbon.
            
               Rod.
               Stay your ſpeach, heere comes king Lewis.
            
            
               Phil.
               They can not know me, I am ſo diſguiſde.
            
            
               Burb.
               Follow my counſayle, and immediatly begin the Battayle.
            
            
               Lew.
               Why, the heat's great,
               It burnes in our Armour as we march.
            
            
               Flan.
               It burnes the enemy as well as wee.
            
            
               Bur.
               It warmes our Souldiers ſpirits & makes them fire:
               I had rather dye, then when my bloud is hot,
               Be awde by counſell, till it freeze like Ice:
               He is no Souldier, that for feare of heat,
               Will ſuffer victory to fly the field.
            
            
               Rod.
               My Lord of Burbon, ye are more hot then wiſe.
            
            
               Bur.
               Rodorick, me thinkes you are very peremptory.
            
            
               Rod.
               It is in zeale of the generall good:
               Go to your Tent, refreſh your vnſcorcht lymmes:
               There draw your battels modell: and as ſoone
               As the coole winds haue fand the burning Sunne,
               And made it tractable for trauaylers:
               Arme you, and mount vpon your barbed Steed,
               
                  Lead foorth your Souldiers, and in good array,
               Charge brauely on the Army of our foe.
            
            
               Lew.
               The Duke of Orleance hath counſeld well,
               Ile in and recreate me in my Tent.
               Farewell, my Lord, when you reſolue to fight,
               Proclayme your meaning by a Canons mouth,
               And with a volley I will anſwere you.
Exit Lewes.
               
            
            
               Bur.
               If you will needs retyre, farewell my Lord.
               Ha Rodoricke, are not we fine Polyticians,
               That haue ſo quaintly wrought the King of Fraunce
               Vnto our faction, that he threatens warre,
               Againſt the almoſt reconcilde Nauar?
            
            
               Rod.
               But this is nothing to the actes weele do:
               Come, come, my Lord, you trifle time with words:
               Sit downe, ſit downe, and make your warlike plot:
               But wherfore ſtand theſe murdrous Glaues ſo nye?
            
            
               Phil.
               Touch them not, Rodorick, prythee let them ſtand.
            
            
               Bur.
               Some paper, pen, and incke.
Enter Peter.
               
            
            
               Peter.
               My Lord.
            
            
               Bur.
               Poſt to the Maſter Gunner,
               And bid him plant his demy culuerings
               Againſt the kings pauilion.
            
            
               Peter.
               Preſently.
            
            
               Bur.
               But firſt, bring pen and incke and paper ſtraight.
               Rodoricke, thou ſhalt aſsiſt mee in this plot.
            
            
               Rod.
               Do it your ſelfe, my Lord, I haue a charge
               Of Souldiers, that are very mutinous,
               And long I dare not ſtay, for feare my abſence
               Be cauſe of their reuolt vnto Nauar.
            
            
               Bur.
               Then to your Souldiers: I will to my plot.
            
            
               Phil.
               Away my Lord, leaue me vnto the Duke.
            
            
               Rod.
               Kill you the Duke, and after Ile kill thee.
            
            
               Bur.
               This pen is ſtabbed, and it will not write,
               The Incke that's in the Standage doth looke blacke,
               This in my pen is turnd as red as bloud.
            
            
               Phil.
               The reaſon that the platforme you would make,
               Muſt by this hand be written with thy bloud.
            
            
               
               Bur.
               Zounds, what art thou that threatens Burbon ſo?
            
            
               Phil.
               One that's as deſperat-careleſſe of his life,
               As thou art timerous, and fearſt to dye.
            
            
               Bur.
               Comeſt thou to kill me?
            
            
               Phil.
               If I ſhould ſay no,
               This weapon would condemne me, which I ſeyz'd
               Of purpoſe, Burbon, to bereaue thy life.
            
            
               Bur.
               Why, fond man, mad man, know'ſt thou what thou doeſt?
            
            
               Phil.
               I know it, Burbon, and I know beſides,
               What thou wouldſt ſay, to daunt my reſolution.
            
            
               Burb.
               What would I ſay?
            
            
               Phil.
               Why, that this place is death,
               As being thy 
                     •
                  ent, enuiron'd with thy ſlaues;
               Where if I kill thee, tis impoſſible.
               To ſcape with life: this Burbon, thou wouldſt ſay:
               But Philip is not to be mou'd with words.
            
            
               Burb.
               Philip!
            
            
               Phil.
               I Philip, Bellamiraes Loue,
               Whoſe beauty, villayne, thou haſt poyſoned:
               For which I haue vow'd thy death, and thou ſhalt dye.
               Therefore betake you to what fence you will,
               Amongſt this bundle chuſe one weapon forth,
               And like a worthy Duke prepare thy ſelfe,
               In knightly maner to defend thy life:
               For I will fight with thee, and kill thee too,
               Or thou ſhalt giue an end vnto my life.
               But if thou call vnto thy ſlaues for helpe,
               Burbon, my ſword ſhall nayle thee to the wall:
               And thinke Prince Philip is a Prince indeed,
               To giue thee this aduantage for thy life.
            
            
               Bur.
               Boy, I will ſcourge your inſolence with death.
            
            
               Phil.
               Come on.
            
            Fight, and kill Burbon.
            
               Bur.
               Oh, I am ſlayne.

               Peace, Rodorick, I am Philip thy deare friend.

               Didſt not thou guide me vnto Burbons Tent?
            
            
               Rod.
               I guide thee to the Tent? I know thee not.
               What, murder, ho: will no man heare my voyce?
            
            
               Enter Peter, and 2. or 3. ſouldiers.

               Where is the murdered, and the murderer?

               Peter, behold thy maſters breathleſſe truncke,
               And there's Prince Philip that hath murdered him.

               Phil.
               He that firſt ventures to attach my life,
               Let him be ſure he hath a life to ſpare:
               For I will ſend one breathleſſe to the graue.
            
            
               Pet.
               You that haue nyne liues, aſſault the gentleman.
            
            
               Rod.
               What peaſants, dare you not attach the ſlaue?
               Ile rayſe the whole Campe, but ile apprehend him.
               Alarum drummes: Souldiers, incircle him,
               And eyther apprehend or ſlay the wretch.
            
            Enter Pembrooke, and Ferdinand.
            
               Pem.
               Tis princely Philip, helpe to reſcue him.

               Zounds, men are mortall; to auoyd prolixity, my Lord of Orleance, your beſt courſe is flying, and therein I will be your follower.

               Pem.
               Liue, worthy Philip, Pembrooke bids thee liue,
               That did ſuſpect this complot at the tombe,
               When in the honour of Prince Ferdinand,
               You did reſigne your ſhield.
            
            
               Phil.
               Th'Earle of Pembrooke!
            
            
               Fer.
               And Ferdinand that loues thee as his ſoule.
            
            
               Phil.
               Two liues I owe my ſtarres, beſide mine owne,
               In ſending me two friends of ſuch import.
               Durſt you aduenture thorow the enemies Campe,
               And put your liues in danger to ſaue mine?
            
            
               Pem.
               The rumour of the Duke of Burbons death,
               Hath ſo poſſeſt the Campe with admiration,
               That they regardleſſe ſuffer all to paſſe:
               Only this, Rodorick wakens them a little;
               But cannot weane them from their wondring minds.
            
            
               Phil.
               That Rodorick is a perfect villayne turn'd:
               For though he guided me vnto his Tent,
               And gaue his liking that the Duke ſhould dye;
               Yet how the villayne cryed to murder me.
               But come, in this confuſion let's be gone,
               Tis dangerous to abide in Burbons Tent.
               Rodoricke, thou art the next muſt taſte of death:
               That taske once done, we ſhall with little payne,
               Our angry fathers reconcile agayne.

               The aduerſe part comes on, fight gallantly.

               Is falſe Nauar ſo thirſty to drinke bloud,
               That he muſt ioyne the Squadron of his troops,
               Before the ſignall of the battel's giuen.
               Belike you thought to take vs vnpreparde.

               Purſue them, Sirs, the victorie is ours.

               Dig not for Traytors loue your ſubiects graue.
            
            
               Lew.
               What franticke knights are thoſe that dare oppoſe

               Thoſe that wiſh you and Fraunce bright fames encreaſe.
               So you would chaſe hence war, and welcome peace.
            
            
               Rod.
               That was the Traytor, that ſlew royall Burbon.
            
            
               Pet.
               Downe with the villaynes.

               Pem.
               Princes, agree: force cānot end this war, but policy.
               Therefore diſpearſe your ſelues, and let our Squires,
               With Trumpets in their mouthes ſound lowd retreat,
               Where you perceiue the fight moſt violent.
               The ſtrangeneſſe of which act will ſtraight amaze,
               When they ſhall heare both peace and war denounc'd,
               And one ſelfe inſtant, they will ſoone retire.
               To know the iſſue, Princes, fall to worke:
               Tis worke of charity, 'twould doe me good,
               If we could end this battell without bloud.

               Yet though I ſeeke the ſafety of my frends,
               Rodorick ſhall loſe his bloud, e're this fight ends.
            
            Alarum, excurſions. Enter Peter leading Thomaſin.
            
               Pet.
               Struggle not, ſtriue not, your ſweete heart Bowyer cannot ſaue you. Without prolixity, you muſt goe with mee.

               And the God of warre come in thy defence, my humour is to kill him. Come away.

               Bow.
               By Ieſu, & you go this way, you muſt pay cuſtom. Zounds, you pickt-hatch Caualiero petticote-monger, can you find time now to be catching Thomaſin? come, deliuer, or by Zenacrib, & the life of king Charlemayne, ile thraſh

            They fight, Bowyer hath the wench, reſcued by France, recouered by Nauar: Philip meetes Rodorick, reſcued by Peter: retreat is ſounded, the enemies begin to retire, Rodorick chaſ'd by Philip: Enter at ſeuerall doores, after retreate ſounded, Pembrooke and Ferdinand.
            
               Fer.
               Are the Kings ſeuerd? will they bow to peace?
            
            
               Pem.
               Peace is a welcome gheſt vnto their hearts:
               But Rodoricke, like a greedy enuious churle,
               Fearing to ſpend his wealth, ſtill keeps them backe,
               Tis he exaſperates the Princes hate:
               And when our Trumpets call them to retyre,
               He with warres clang or ſets them on agayne.
               Vnleſſe he be remoou'd, our labour's loſt.
            
            
               Fer.
               It ſhall not; for ile ſeeke him through the Hoſt,
               And with this ſword pare off the Traytors head.
            
            
               Pem.
               Doe, and ile ſcowre theſe ranks: if Pembroks eye
               Encounters his, he meets his Tragedy.
            
            Alarum, Enter Philip, purſuing Rodoricke.
            
               Phil.
               Stay, warlike friends, and ayd me in reuenge.
            
            
               Fer.
               That is Rodoricke.
            
            
               Pem.
               Heere's the Traytor, ſtrike him downe.
            
            
               Phil.
               Who lifts his arme at him, ſtrikes at my breſt.
            
            
               Rod.
               Why haue you thus ring'd me about with ſwords?
            
            
               Phil.
               To ſhew thee thou muſt dye.

               What haue I done,
               That thus you labour my deſtruction?
            
            
               Pem.
               Thou wer't a party in all Burbons wrongs.
            
            
               Fer.

               Villayne, for this, our ſwords ſhall ſtop thy breath.

               Stand not to argue, let's all runne at him.
            
            
               Phil.
               Now as you loue my loue, or prize mine honour,
               Touch not the Traytor, he is Philips foe;
               And none but I muſt worke his ouerthrow.
               Thrice in the battell he was reſcued from me:
               But now hee's falne into the Lyons paw,
               From whence the whole world cannot ranſome him.
               Preſeruers of my life, heroick friends,
               Be you my ſafety, keepe the Souldyers off,
               Whilſt in the midſt by fayre and equall fight,
               I ſend this Traytor to eternall night.
            
            
               Ferd.
               By heauen agreed.
            
            
               Pem.
               Heere Pembrooke takes his ſtand:
               Come Fraunce and all the world, I will not ſtart,
               Til Philips knightly ſword pearce Rodoricks hart.
            
            
               Rod.
               Accurſt, I am betrayd, incompaſt round:
               Now lyfe and hope and ſtate muſt kiſſe the ground.
            
            
               Phil.
               Rodorick, thou ſeeſt, all wayes are ſtopt to flie,
               Be deſperat then, fight brauely, and ſo die.
            
            Alarum▪ they fight: enter to Pembrooke Nauar, Bowyer, & Souldiers: to Ferdinand, Fraunce, Flaunders & Souldiers: they fight and keepe them backe: Rodoricke would ſcape, ſtill kept in the midſt, and kild by Philip.
            
               Phil.
               Now are his trecheries repaid with death:
               Philip and Pembrooke, ſound your retreat
                     •
                  
               
               With better hope; in him all hatred endes:
               The kings will now loue peace, & ſoone be friends▪
               
            
            Exeunt. Enter Peter wounded, Bowier following.
            
               Bow.
               Zounds, neuer runne for the matter, a ſcratcht face can not ſerue your turne, we muſt haue bloudy noſes: ſtād on yout gard: & I do not make haggaſſe puddings of your guttes, Ile neuer dominier in the long Alleyes agayne.

               Cymnell, Ile cracke you for this, Ile teach you to deale with Peter de Lions, and that without prolixitie.
            
            
               Bow.
               Do: haue at you in earneſt: S. George, you rogue.
            
            Alarum, fight: Bowyer kills him.
            
               Bow.
               So, there's for your prolixities: there's for Thomaſin: the Thornbackly ſlaue, and he were made of any thing but griſtles, I am a pumpian: 'Shart, he had no mettle in him: yet how the villayne crak't and dominierd when he was liuing: ah, ſirra, neuer gryn for the matter, tis Captayne Bowyer that ſpeaks it. When thou meetſt the great Deuill, commend me to him, and ſay, I ſent him thee for a new yeres gift: and there's one Sarlaboys to, as arrant a bloud-ſucker, and as notable a coward, as euer drew weapon in a bawdy houſe: hee carryes my marke about him: if Dicke Bowyer be not writ a bountifull benefactor in hell for my good deeds, in ſending thither ſuch Canibals, I am a Rabbit-ſucker: yet I ſcorne to vaunt of my deeds too. They ſound a retreat: farewell, Peter, and learne hereafter what it is to be riuall to an Engliſh gentleman, Caualiero Bowyer, one of the nyne worthyes.
            
            Exit.
            A retreyt. Enter at one dore, Fraunce, Flaunders, and Souldiers: at the other dore Nauar, Bowyer, and Souldiers.
            
               Lew.
               Nauar, why haue you ſounded a retreyt?
               Will your proud heart decline and call vs Lord?

               We thought by the faynt lāguage of your drums,
               Fraunce would haue knowne his errour, and beg'd peace.
            
            
               Lew.
               Fraunce beg a peace!

               Why did you ceaſe the fight, and ſound retreat?

               Not we, by this beard: not we, by the life of Pharo.

               Your Trumpets guided by your faynting breath,

               Sound war, and brauely let vs once more too't.
            
            Enter in the middeſt, Pembrooke, Ferdinand, and Philip.
            
               Pem.
               Kings of Nauar and Fraunce, why doe you thus
               With ciuill butchery wound this bleſſed land,
               Which like a mother, from her melting eyes,
               Sheds crymſon teares, to ſee you enemyes?
               Lewes of Fraunce, wherein hath great Nauar
               Dangerd your ſtate, that you ſhould proſecute
               War with her largeſt ruine? how hath Fraunce
               Sowed ſuch inueterate hate within your breſt,
               That to confound him, you will vndergoe
               The orphants curſe, the widdowes teares & cries,
               Whoſe husbands in theſe warres haue loſt their liues?
               E're you contend, diſcourſe your grieuances.
            
            
               Lew.
               Falſe Ferdinand his ſonne, rauiſht our child.
            
            
               Fer.
               Now by my Knighthood, honor, and this gage,
               Fraunce, 
                     •
                  le approue you wrong that Ferdinand.
            
            
               Phil.
               Who can accuſe him?
            
            
               Lew.
               That did Rodorick.
            
            
               Pem.
               That Traytor, for a deed ſo falſe, ſo foule,
               Hath anſwered it by this, euen with his ſoule.
            
            
               Nau.
               Our ſonne, and valours bloome, th'Engliſh Pembrooke,
               By Lewes trechery were butchered.
            
            
               Phil.
               Were the whole world ioynd in ſo falſe a thing,
               Alone Ide combat all, and cleere the King.
            
            
               Pem.
               Fraunce neuer had deſsigne in their two deaths.
            
            
               Nau.
               He leagu'd with Burbon, that deſtroyd my child.
            
            
               Lew.
               He poyſoned her deſeruedly.
            
            
               Phil.
               That deed of ſhame
               Cut off his life, and rac'd out Burbons name.
            
            
               Lew.
               His death ſhalbe thy death; for thy hand ſlue him.
            
            
               Nau.
               This other in the battell twice to day,
               
                  Made vs retire, Fraunce, ſhall we ioyne in league,
               Till we haue veng'd our malice on theſe knights?
            
            
               Lew.
               Nauar, agreed. Souldiers, this kyld your Lords.
            
            
               Nau.
               And this our fame: let's mangle them with ſwords.
            
            
               Pem.
               Take truce a while with rage: heare what wee'le vrges
               This knight flew Burbon, this inforſt you fly;
               Therfore you hate them, and for hate they die.
               Since then true vertue is disfigured,
               Deſert trod downe, and their heroick worth,
               In iuſtice doomd on Traytors merits, Death:
               Behold theſe two, which thouſands could not daunt,
               But your vngratitude, on bended knee,
               Yeeld vp their ſwoords to bide your tyranny.
               'Twas he kild Burbon: if you loue him dead,
               Shew it by paring off this valiant head:
               Do you the like: to this reuenge apace.
               They feare not threats, and ſcorne to beg for grace.
            
            
               Lew.
               And they ſhall find none.
            
            
               Nau.
               Knights, tryumph in death,
               We are your headſmen, Kings ſhall ſtop your breath.
            
            They take off their Helmets.
            
               Lew.
               Philip, my ſonne!

               Young Ferdinand my ioy!

               Call them not ſonnes, whom you would fayne deſtroy.
            
            
               Nau.
               Hold not our age too long in deepe ſuſpect.

               Lew.
               And thou Philip?
            
            
               Fer.
               We are the friendly ſonnes of aduerſe parents,
               Your long loſt children, though ſuppoſed ſlayne,
               We liue, and come to ioy your age agayne.
            
            
               Nau.
               Welcome all earthly bliſſe.
            
            
               Lew.
               Welcome, deare child,

               Pem.
               How ſoon this Scene is chāg'd! thoſe that euē now
               Were ſworne warres ſeruants, now to peace do bow:
               Then Pembrooke, ſtriue to make their ioyes more full.
               See, kingly father, to that princely ſonne.
               
                  Pembrooke, the hated murderer of his friend:
               Pembroke, that did deuide thee from his ſight,
               And cut ſo many paſſages of death,
               In his indeared boſome, humbly thus
               Forgets his honour, and from your hye hand,
               Inuokes reuenge for wounding Ferdinand.
            
            
               Fer.
               Still he ſurmounts me in an honour'd loue.
               Riſe, friend; or if thou ſtriu'ſt to haue the world,
               In me, as in a glaſſe, ſee a falſe friend.
               Behold, I kneele, and here proclayme to all,
               My friendſhip's broke, but thine ſubſtantiall.
            
            
               Na.
               Model of vertue, honord Pembroks Earle,
               Riſe in as deare regard as Ferdinand.
               Oh, had I Bellamira once in hold,
               Age would turne youth, & I ſhould ne're be old.
            
            
               Lew.
               Had I my Katharina once agayne,
               Our ioy were then ſtretcht to the higheſt ſtrayne:
               But ſhe was rauiſht, and then murthered▪
               
            
            
               Phil.
               Beare not that hard opinion: Rodoricks toung
               Slaundred that Prince, and did his vertue wrong.
            
            
               Pem.
               Lewis of Fraunce, heare what an Engliſh Earle
               Speaks in the front and view of all thy Hoſt:
               If euer Ferdinand ſtaynd Katharines honour,
               I was a party: yet in all your Campe,
               Who dares ſtep forth and call me rauiſher?
               No, Fraunce, know Pembroke is an Engliſhman,
               Highly deriu'd, yet higher in my thoughts;
               And for to regiſter mine acts in braſſe,
               Which all-deuouring time ſhall ne're race out,
               Haue I through all the Courts of Chriſtendome,
               In knightly tryall prou'd my vertue ſound,
               Raiſd Englands fame aloft; and ſhall I now,
               In her next continent, her neighbour Realme.
               Fraunce, on whoſe boſome I may ſtand and ſee
               That bleſſed ſoyle, that bred and foſtred me,
               Soyle all my late got honour, to conſent
               Vnto a royall Princes rauiſhment?
               
                  Ide ſooner from a mountayne caſt my ſelfe,
               Or from a hungry Lyon teare his pray,
               Then dare to act a deed ſo infamous:
Enter Katharina.
               
               But words are ayre: Lewis, behold this face;
               This proues our honour cleere from all diſgrace.
            
            
               Lew.
               My Katharine!

               Pem.
               See, Princes, loues effect: ſhe flies your hand,
               To liue imbrac't with her deare Ferdinand.
            
            
               Lew.
               And heauen forbid that we ſhould ſunder them.
               Nauar, reach me thy hand: grym war is fled,
               And peace ſhall end the ſame in a nuptiall bed.
               Sonne Philip, ratify your ſiſters choyce.
            
            
               Phil.
               Euen with my ſoule: for euer liue you bleſt.
               Oh Bellamira, had not curſed Burbon,
               For beauty robd thy cheeks with Leproſie:
               Hadſt thou but ſtayd with me, as is their ſtate,
               So had bin mine, happy and fortunate.
            
            Enter Clowne attyred like a Gentleman, Bellamira following with a Scarfe on her face.
            
               Clow.
               By your leaue, ſweet blouds: may a Gentleman or ſo, deceyue two or three ounces of words in this aſſembly?
            
            
               Lew.
               You may.
            
            
               Clow.
               Is there not a young Kings ſonne amongſt you, who treading the ſteps of his father, is called Philip?
            
            
               Phil.
               I am the man thou ſeekſt.
            
            
               Clow.
               Then the old ſaying is verified, He that ſeeks, ſhall find. Heere is a poore kinſwoman of mine would deſire ſome priuate conference with you, or ſo.
            
            
               Phil.
               With me? whom ſee I? Bellamira!
            
            
               Nau.
               Daughter!
            
            
               Phil.
               Do not deride my woes, ſpeake, ſpeake, I pray.
            
            
               Pem.
               Looke not ſo ſtrange, it is thy louely Loue,
               
                  Thus manag'd, to approue thy conſtancy.
               Embrace her then: and now Nauar and Fraunce,
               Here end your ſtrife, and let all hatred fall,
               And turne this warre to Hymens feſtiuall.
            
            
               Nau.
               This Pembrooks counſell we ſubſcribe vnto.
            
            
               Lew.
               The like doth France: Louers imbrace your Loues;
               And Captaines, ioyne your Bands, mix power with power,
               And let thoſe ſwords, which late were drawne for death,
               Sleepe in their ſheathes. You, worthy Pembrooke,
               And all your followers, ſhall receyue our fauours,
               In plenteous largeſſe: ſo, ſet on to Court;
               Sound Drums and Trumpets, deafe the ayre with cryes,
               And fill eche ſubiects heart with ioyes increaſe,
               T'applaud our childrens loue, and this dayes peace.
            
            FINIS.
