the chiefe care hereof. Besides, the Author of this worke, whilest he liued, so much honoured your sincere and religious courses in managing the publique affaires of your eminent place, that had he thought of the publishing thereof, no doubt but he would haue presumed to gaine some luster vnto it from your gracious Patronage. Succeeding him in his temporall blessings, I doe endeuour to succeede him in his virtues, dutifull affection towards your grace, and prayers to the almightie, for the good of his Church, to increase daily your honours, and happinesse.

               ng out of hidden verities, they haue not all the same proiectes, but their various cogitations are vsually fixed vpon diuers ends. Some (saith a deuout Father) know that they may be knowne, and this is vanity: some know, onely that they may know, and this is curiosity: others know to edifie, and this is charity. How distastfull the vanity of the first sort was vnto the learned, and iudicious Author of this ensuing discourse, his priuate and retyred course of life, his setled, and constant vnwillingnesse, whilest he enioyed his earthly tabernacle, to expose any of his accurate labours to the publicke viewe of the world, may sufficiently testifie: and yet to auoyde the fruitelesse curiosity of the second ranke, he was euer most ready in priuate either by conference, or writing to instruct others repayring vnto him, if they were desirous of his resolution in any doubtfull pointes of learning within the ample circuit of his deepe apprehension.
            
               From this his modest, and humble charity (vertues which rarely cohabite with the swelling windenesse of much knowledge) issued this spisse and dense, yet polished; this copious, yet concise; this concise yet cleare and perspicuous Treatise of the variety of Languages and Religions through the chiefe regions of the world.

Paul writeth to the Romans in the Greeke, saith, it was the large extent then of this language, that his instructions might more generally be vnderstood; to make the truth of Erasmus assertion more euident, he was intreated to point out particularly the amplenesse, and multitude of such Regions, wherein this learned tounge was aunciently most vulgar.

            And forasmuch as Guido Fabritius doth clearely demonstrate the vulgar tongue of Iury in the daies of our blessed Sauiours pilgrimage here vppon earth to be the Syriacke, which (saith

                that the one could not be vnderstood by the other: he was questioned in which of

these languages the Hebrew or Syriacke the publicke reading of the sacred Scriptures in those times were prformed.
            Lastly, whereas there are many Christians in Greece, Asia, Muscouia, Aegypt, and Aethiopia, it was desired of him that he would more distinctly set downe the Countries wherein they liued, their superiours to whom they are subiect, and their differences from the Romane Church, that it might more manifestly appeare, how idle are the common vaunts amongst the ignorant of her amplitude, as though all the Christian world saue a few Protestantes shut vp in some obscure corner of Europe, professed the same faith she embraceth and were within the territories of her Iurisdiction. The falsehood of which glorious boastings are in part most liuely discouered in this learned Tractate, describing the diuers conditions of Christians in the East, North and Southerne Regions of the earth which haue no subordination vnto the Papall Hierarchie, but not in the West, where Protestantes haue cheifely their aboade; and therefore to make it a more compleate worke, it will not be amisse compendiously to declare their multitudes, amplenesse, and seuerall habitations in this Europaean world.

            For whereas there are diuers sorts of these Polonicke Protestants, some embracing the Waldensian, or the Bohemick, others the Augustane, and some the Heluetian confession, and so doe differ in some outward circumstances of Discipline, and ceremony: yet knowing well that a kingdome diuided cannot stand, and that the one God whom all of them worship in spirit is the God of peace and concord, they iointly meet at one Generall Synode, and their first Act alway is, a religious and solemne profession of their vnfained consent in the substantiall points of Christian Faith, necessary to saluation.

of God, Sinne, Freewil, the Law, the Gospel, Iustification by Christ, Faith in his name, Regeneration, the catholike Church, and Supreame head thereof Christ, the Sacraments, their number and vse, the state of soules after death, the resurrection & life eternal, they decreed, that wheras in the forenamed confessions there is some difference in phrases, and formes of speech concerning Christs presence in his holy supper, which might breed dissention, all disputations touching the manner of Christs presence should bee cut off; seeing all of them doe beleeue the presence it selfe, and that the Eucharisticall elements are not naked and empty signes, but doe truely performe to the faithfull receiuer that which they signifie, and represent, and to preuent future occasions of violating this sacred consent, they ordained that no man should be called to the sacred ministery without subscription thereunto, and when any person shalbe excluded by excommunication from the congregation of one con

                  ession, that he may not be receiued by the congregation of another; Lastly, forasmuch as they accord in the substantiall verity of Christian doctrine, they professe themselues content to tolerate diuersitie of ceremonies, according to the diuerse practise of their particular Churches, and to remoue the least suspition of rebelling, and sedition, wherewith their malitious, and calumniating aduersaries might blemish the Gospell, although they are subiect vnto many greeuous pressures, from the adherents of Antichrist, yet they carnestly export one another to follow that worthy and Christian

admonition of Lactantius: Defendenda Religio est, non occidendo, sed moriendo, non saeuitia sed patientia, non scelere, sed fide, illa enim bonorum sunt, haec malorum.
            
            This is the state of the professors of the Gospell in the electiue Monarchy of Polonia, who in the adioyning countries on the South Transiluania and Hungarie, are also exceedingly multiplied. In the former by the fauor Gabriel Bartorius now Prince of that Region, who not many yeares, since hath expulsed thence all such as are of the Papall faction, in a manner the whole body of the Inhabitants (except some few rotten and putred limmes of Arrians, Antitrinnitarians, Ebionites, Socinians, Anabaptists, who heere as also in Polonia, Lituania Borussia haue some publicke Assemblies) are professed Protestants: in the later, a greater part, specially beeing compared onely with such as are there addicted to the Romish superstition.

the Empire (none of note excepted besides the Duke of Bauaria) are firmely Protestantes. Now what the multitudes of subiects are professing the same faith with these Princes, we may guesse by the amplenes of the dominions vnder the gouernmēt of such only as for their cōmands are chiefe, and most eminent amongst them; As of the Prince Elector Palatine, the Duke of Saxonie, the Marquesse of Brandeburge, the Duke of Wirtenburg, Landgraue of Hesse, Marquesse of Baden, Prince of Anhalt, Dukes of Brunswicke, Holst, Luenburg, Meckleburge, Pomerane, Sweyburge, Nauburge
               ▪ amongst whom the Marquesse of Brandeburge hath for his Dominion, not only the Marchasate it selfe contayning in circuit about 520. miles, & furnished with fiftie cities, and about threescore other walled Townes; but likewise part of Prussia, for which he is feudatarie vnto the king of Poland, the Region of Prignitz, the Dukedome of Crossen, the Signories of Sternberg, and Cotbus, the Countie of Rapin, and lately the three Dukedomes of Cleue, Gulick, and Berg, of which the two former haue either of them in circuit 130. miles.
            
               Neare adioyning vnto these three last Dukedomes, are those Prouinces of the low Countries gouerned by the States, namely Zutphen, Vtrech, Oberyssel, Groningham, Holland, Zeland, West-frizland, in which onely Protestants haue the publicke (for otherwise Arrians, Anabaptists, Socinians are here priuately tolerated) and free exercise of their Religion, as also in the neighbour dominion of the Earle of East-Freezland.
            
            But to passe from these vnited Prouinces vnder the States vnto France; in this mighty kingdome, those (as

they usually stile them) of the Religion, besides the Castels, and fortes that doe belong in propertie vnto the Duke of Bullen, the Duke of Rohan, Count of Laual, the Duke of Trimouile, Mounsieur Chastillion, the Mareshall of Digners, the Duke of Sully, and others, are seased of above 70. Townes hauing Garrisons of souldiers gouerned by Nobles and Gentlemen of the Religion; they haue 800.

Which multitudes, although they are but small, and as it were an handfull in comparison of all bearing the names of Papists throughout the spacious continent of France; yet in regard of such as are entirely Popish, they haue some proportion.

France, and hath no power to dispose of Temporall things; That it belongeth to Christian Kings and Princes to call Ecclesiasticall Synods, and to establish their decrees, to make Ecclesiasticall lawes for the good of the Church, reforme the abuses therein, and to haue the same power and authority ouer sacred persons in causes Ecclesiasticall, as was exercised by Iosias, and Constantine the Great, who said he was a Bishop ouer the outward things of the Church; That the lawes whereby their Church is to bee gouerned are onely the Canons of the more ancient Councels, and their owne Nationall Decrees, and not the Decretals of the Bishops of Rome; That the Councell of Constance assembled by Sigismund the Emperour, & with a concurrent consent of other Christian Princes, decreeing a Generall Synode to be superiours vnto the Pope, and correcting many enormious abuses in the Roman Church which yet remaine in practise, was a true oecumenicall Councell, and so likewise the Councell of Basill; That the Assembly of Trent was no lawfull Councell, and the Canons thereof are rather to be esteemed the Decrees of the Popes who called and continued it, then the Decrees of the Councell it selfe, because in this Assembly Bishops onely (contrary to the practise of the Councell of Basill) had decisiue voyces, and the greatest parts of Bishops were Italian the Popes vassals; and besides, nothing was then determined that was not at Rome fore-determined by the Pope; That the Sacrament

of the Lords Supper ought to be administred vnder both kinds, and at the least a great part of diuine seruice is to be performed in their vulgar tongues; Thus are the greater number of Lawyers and learned men in France affected, and those who are throughly popish are for the most part men of the basest sort wholy leauened with the bitter slanders and calumniations of malicious Friers.

            And if any shall except that the Protestants in diuerse Countries before mentioned cannot bee reputed as one body, and of one Church, by reason of many differences, and hot contentions amongest them, let such remember, that howsoeuer some priuate men in this holy society rather then of it, preferring their nouell and passionate fancies, before the peace of the Church, purchased with Christs precious bloud, and the publicke weale of Christian Monarchies, vnnaturall toward their owne deere Mother,

rending that wombe wherein they were new borne by the lauer of Regeneration, forgetfull of their heauenly embassage, which is not onely to reconcile men vnto God, but men with men, so farre neglecting their owne eternall saluation, as to be vnmindfull of that most vndoubted truth, He that is not in charity, is in death, trampling vnder foote that glorious legacie of their Lord and Maister, My peace I giue vnto you, my peace I leaue with you, haue in heat of contention, and bitternesse of their soules strained and racked their weake vnderstandings, to make differences betweene themselues, euen in the maine Articles of Faith, and branded one another with blasphemy, and heresie, yet these vnchristian and vncharitable dissensions are not to be imputed to the whole sacred community of Orthodox Churches, whose harmony and agreement in necessary points of Faith, are onely to be esteemed by their confessions which by publicke authority they haue diuulged vnto the world.
            How many are the differences both in doctrine and discipline betweene the Proctors for the Papall faction, touching Discipline? some teach their cheefetaine the Pope may erre, others that he cannot: some that he is subiect vnto a Generall Councell, others that hee is aboue it: some that all Ecclesiasticall authority is immediately in the Prelates of the Church, others that it is onely in the Pope, and from him deriued vnto inferiour Bishops: some that he hath temporall authorities ouer Princes, others not; concerning doctrine, some at firme that predestination both by grace, and glory is meerely from Gods free pleasure, others from foreseene desert and merit, some that all the bookes or part of them belonging vnto the old Testament which

were not in the Canon of the Iewish Church are Apocriphall, others canonicall euen in the matters of Faith: some that there is no originall sinne inherent in vs, but only imputed, others that it is both inherent and imputed: some that wee are most freely iustified, by the meanes of Faith, Hope, &c. others by the value, and merit of these vertues: some that faith is onely a generall assent vnto diuine truths, others that it is a speciall perswasion touching the remission of our sinnes through Christ, some that wee appeare righteous in Gods sight, partly through imputed, partly through inherent righteousnesse, others onely by inherent: some that eternall life is due vnto our works onely by vertue of Gods free and gratious promise, others through the merit of the worke done: some that all the morall good works of Infidels, and Ethnicks are sinnes, others that they are without sinne; some that the B. Virgin was conceiued without originall sinne, others the contrary, and that with such eagernesse, that the one condemne the other of heresie: yet because these contentions are betweene priuate men, and they all (in Spaine and Italie, but not in France, as hath beene (hewed) accord in the cheefe points of doctrine publiquely established in the Councell of Trent, they boast much of their vnity.
            Although then some priuate men vnworthy to take the word of peace and reconciliation into their virulent and contentious mouthes, led more by passion, and their owne selfe-pleasing conceipt, then by the sacred rules of truth, and piety, haue laboured to sow the tares of dissention in the vineyard of the Lord, and heereby haue made crooked some few branches cleauing vnto them: yet the generall societies of Orthodox Churches in the publicke

confessions of their faith, doe so agree, that there is a most sacred harmony betweene them in the more substantiall points of Christian Religion necessary to saluation.
            This is manifest out of the confessions themselues, which are these, the Anglicane, the Scotiane, French, Heluctian former, and later, the Belgie, Polonie, Argentine, Augustane, Saxonicke, Wirtenbergicke, Palatine, Bohemicke or Weldensian confession: for there is none of the Churches formerly pointed out in diuers places of Europe which doth not embrace one of these confessions, and all of them harmoniously conspire in the principall Articles of Faith, and which neerest concerne our eternall saluation; as in the infallible verity and full sufficiency of the Scriptures, diuine essence and vnitie of the euerlasting Godhead, the sacred Trinitie of the three glorious persons, the blessed incarnation of Christ, the omnipotent prouidence of God, the absolute supreame head of the Church, Christ, iustification by Faith through Christ, and the nature of a liuely faith, repentance, regeneration and sanctification, the difference betweene the Law, and the Gospell, touching freewill, sinne, and good works, the Sacraments their number and vse, the notes of the Church, the diuine authority of Magistrates, the resurrection, and state of soules after death.
            And for the cheefe point of difference which is conceiued to be betweene the professors of the Gospell about the presence of Christ in the sacred Eucharist; such as are parties in this contention ingenuously confesse, that de reipsa, touching the thing it selfe there is no oppositiō but only we varie in some ordinances, and circumstances of the thing. We agree reipsa, in the

matter it selfe, although we differ according to the diuersity of Gods gifts in expressing aptly and cleerely what we conceiue concerning this matter. We all acknowledge that the holy Symboles, or signes, are not inanes significationes, barely significatiue, but what by diuine institution they represent and testifie vnto our soules, is as truly and certainly deliuered vnto vs from God as the symboles themselues. But the question is, whether as the signe with the thing signified is presēt in respect of our body, and not rather in regard of our well receiuing it by faith. Moreouer, whether as both the signe, and thing signified are exhibited to all, so all receiue both, some to life, others to their perdition. So that wee all beleeue the true communication of the true body and bloud of our Lord Iesus Christ, onely concerning the manner of communication is the controuersie. But who can rightlie iudge that for this the sacred vnion and fellowship of Churches, is to be dissolued.
            
            There being so excellent a foundation and firm groundworke of vnity betweene the Protestants, how worthy a worke would it be for Christian Princes to imitate the professors of the Gospell in the kingdome of Polonia, and by a generall Assembly of moderate, and vnpartiall Iudges and sensible of the bleeding wounds religion receiueth by sects, and discords, make vp the ruines and breaches of Churches, caused hitherto through priuate contention, & to sement them together (if it shall please God out of the riches of his mercy to prosper their heroicall and religious endeauours) with an euerlasting bond of concord. There

were neuer greater hopes of the successe of so noble and

               ncomparable a worke, then in this age which hath affoorided vs the blessing of our most gratious Soueraigne, so religiously studious of publicke peace, and so exquisitelie enabled with many rare endowments to promote so pious and renowned an action.
            In the meane time, if any in these priuate distractions concerning matters of Religion excited by the malice of Sathan, and his wretched instruments, shall doubt which way to take, let him folow the graue & diuine instructions of that excellent light of the Church S. Augustine; who first exhorteth vs not to busie our selues ouermuch in enquiring after those things quae nihil certi habent in Scriptura, which haue no firme footing in the Scriptures, but in receiuing, or reiecting them to follow the custome, & practise of particular Churches wherein we liue; otherwise (saith 
                  Epist. 86.
                he) If we will dispute of these things, & contend one with another: orietur interminata luctatio, there will hence arise an endlesse strife. And his second admonition is, that for the establishing of our consciences in points of faith necessary to obtaine eternall life, we would follow our blessed Sauiours commandement: Search the Scriptures, Why (
                  In Psal. 21.
                saith this deuout and learned Father speaking to contentious Christians) doe we striue? we are brethren. Our Father hath not dyed intestate: he hath made his last wil: he is dead, & risen againe. There is contention still about an inheritance as long as the Testament is not made knowne, but when it is published in judgement all are silent to heare it. The Iudge attentiuely listneth vnto it, the Aduocats hold their peace: the cryers

command silence, & the whole multitude present, stand in a suspence, that the words of a dead man lying in his graue without sense and life may be rehearsed. Are the words of a dead man & interred, so powerfull & aualeable, and shall the Testament of Christ sitting in heauen be impugned? Open it, let vs read, we are brethren, why do we striue? Our father hath not left vs destitute of his last wil: he that made it liueth for euer; he heareth our voice & acknowledgeth his owne voice. Let vs reade, why contend we? Hauing found the inheritance let vs lay hold of it aperi, lege: open and read.
            
         
      
      
         
            
            OF THE ANCIENT LARGENES of the Greeke tongue. CHAP. 1.
            
               GREECE, as it was ancientlie knowen by the name of Hellas, was inclosed betwixt the Bay of Ambracia, with the riuer Arachthus, that falleth into it on the West, and the riuer Peneneus on the North,Strabo. l. 8. nō longè a principio. & the Sea on other parts. So that Acarnania and Thessalie, were toward the Continēt, the vtmost regions of Greece. But yet, not the Countreys onely contained within those limits, but also the kingdomes of Macedon, and Epirus; being the next adioyning prouinces (Macedon toward the North, Epirus toward the West) had aunciently the Greeke tongue for their vulgare language: for although it belonged originally to Hellas alone, yet in time it became vulgare to these also.
            Secondly, it was the language of all the Isles in the Aegaean sea; of all those Ilands I say, that are

betwixt Greece and Asia, both, of the many small ones, that lie between Candie and Negropont, named Cyclades (there are of them 53.) and of all aboue Negropont also, as farre as the Strait of Constantinople.
            Thirdly, of the Isles of Candie, Scarpanto, Rhodes, and a part of Cyprus, and of all the small Islands along the coast of Asia, from Candie to Syria.
            
            Fourthly, not only of al the West part of Asia the lesse, (now called Anatolia, and corruptly Natolia) lying toward the Aegaean sea, as being verie thicke planted with Greeke Colonies:Sen

And yet although within these limits onely, Greeke was generally spoken, on the Maritime coast of Asia, yet beyond them, on both the shoares Eastward, were many Greeke Cities (though not without Barbarous Cities among them.) And specially I find the North coast of Asia, euen as farre as Trebizond, to haue bin exceedingly well stored with them. But, it may be further obserued likewise out of histories, that not onely al the maritime part of Anatolia could vnderstand and speake the Greeke tongue, but most of the inland people also, both by reason of the great traffique, which those rich Countries had for the most part with Grecians, and for that on all sides,

the East onely excepted, they were inuironed with them. Yet neuerthelesse, it is worthy obseruing, that albeit the Greeke tongue preuailed so farre in the Regions of Anatolia, as to be in a manner generall, yet for all that, it neuer became vulgar, nor extinguished the vulgar languages of those Coūtries. For it is not onely particularly obserued of the Galatians, by Hierome,

written in a manner onely in Greeke. Another, the exceeding great trade and traffique of Grecians, in which, aboue all nations, except perhaps the old Phenicians (to whom yet they seeme not to haue beene inferior) they imployed themselues. A third, beyond all these, because those great Princes, among whom al that Alexander the Great had conquered, was diuided, were Grecians, which for manie reasons, could not but exceedingly spreade the Greeke tongue, in all those parts where they were Gouernors: among whom, euen one alone, Seleucus by name, is registred by Appian, to haue founded in the East parts vnder his gouernement,Appian.

And yet was there a fourth cause, that in the after time greatly furthered this inlargement of the Greeke tongue, namely the imployment of Grecians in the gouerment of the prouinces, after the translation of the Imperiall seate to Constantinople. For these causes I say, together with the mixture of Greeke Colonies, dispersed in many places (in which fruitfulnesse of Colonies, the Grecians far passed the Romanes) the Greeke tongue spred very farre, especially towards the East. In so much, that all the Orient (which yet must be vnderstoode with limitation, namely the Orientall part of the Romane Empire, or to speake in the phrase of those times, the dioces of the Orient, which contained Syria, Palestine, Cilicia, and part of Mesopotaneia and of Arabia) is said by Hierome,

            Of the Decaying of the ancient Greeke tongue, and of the present vulgar Greeke. CHAP. 2.
            
               BVt at this day, the Greeke tongue is very much decayed, not onely as touching the largenesse, and vulgarnesse of it, but also in the purenesse and elegancy of the language. For as touching the former, First, in Italie, Fraunce, and other places to the West, the naturall languages of the countries haue vsurped vpon it. Secondly, in the skirts of Greece it selfe, namely in Epirus, and that part of Macedon, that lieth towards the Adriatique
               
sea, the Sclauonique tongue hath extinguished it. Thirdly, in Anatolia, the Turkish tongue hath for a great part suppressed it. And Lastly, in the more Eastward, and South parts, as in that part of Cilicia, that is beyond the riuer Piramus, in Siria, Palestine, Aegypt and Libia, the Arabian tongue hath abolished it: Abolished it I say, namely, as touching any vulgar vse, for, as touching Ecclesiasticall vse, many Christians of those parts still retaine it in their Leiturgies. So that, the parts in which the Greeke tongue is spoken at this day, are (in few words) but these. First Greece it selfe (excepting Epirus, and the West part of Macedon.) Secondly, the Isles of the Aegaean sea. Thirdly, Candie, & the Isles Eastward of Candie, along the coast of Asia to Cyprus (although in Cyprus, diuers other languages are spoken, beside the Greeke) and likewise the Isles Westward of Candia, along the Coastes of Greece, and Epirus, to Corfu. And Lastly, a good part of Anatolia.
            
            But as I said, the Greeke tongue, is not onely thus restrained, in comparison of the ancient extention that it had, but it is also much degenerated and impaired, as touching the purenesse of speech, being ouergrowne with barbarousnesse: But yet not without some rellish of the ancient elegancie. Neither is it altogether so much declined from the antient Greeke,

L. 3. & 5. as the Italian is departed from the Latine, as Bellonius hath also obserued, and by conferring of diuers Epistles of the present language, which you may finde in Crusius his Turcograecia, with the ancient tongue, may be put out of question,

which corruption yet, certainely hath not befallen that language, through any inundation of barbarous people, as is supposed to haue altered the Latine tongue, for although I know Greece to haue beene ouerrunne, & wasted, by the Gothes, yet I finde not in histories, any remembrance of their habitation, or long continuance in Greece, & of their coalition into one people with the Grecians, without which, I conceaue not, how the tongue could be greatly altered by them. And yet certaine it is, that long before the Turkes came among them, their language was growne to the corruption wherein now it is, for that, in the writings of Cedrenus, Nicetas, and some other late Greekes, (although long before the Turkes inuasion) there is found, notwithstanding they were learned men, a strong rellish of this barbarousnesse: Insomuch that the learned Grecians themselues,Ge

Yet it cannot be denied (and

to Constantinople, began to creepe into their language, as we may obserue in diuers Greeke writers of good antiquitie, some Italian words also, and Slauonian, and Arabique, and Turkish, and of other nations, are gotten into their language, by reason of the great traffique and commerce, which those people exercise with the Grecians. For which cause, as Bellonius hath obserued,Bello
                     •
                  . Obseruat. L. 1. C 3. it is more altered in the maritime parts, and such other places of foraigne concourse, then in the inner region. But yet, the greatest part of the corruption of that language, hath beene bred at home, and proceeded from no other cause, then their owne negligence, or affectation. As First, (for example) by mutilation of some words, pronouncing and writing

                &c.Vide Crus. Turcograec. pag. 44.224.242.391 398.399. &c. Secondly, by compaction of seuerall words into one, as 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                for 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                for 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                &c. Thirdly, by confusion of sounde, as making no difference in the pronouncing of three vowels, namely 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , and two dipthongues 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                and 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , all which fiue they pronounce by one letter i, as 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , they pronounce icos, icon, stithi, lipi. Fourthly, by translation of accents, from the syllables to which in ancient pronoūcing they belonged, to others. And all those foure kindes of corruption, are very common in their language: for which reasons, and for some others, which may bee obserued in Crusius, Burrana,
               Burran. in Coron. pretiosa. &c. the Greeke tongue, is become much altered (euen in the proper and natiue words of the language) from what anciently it was. Yet neuerthelesse it is recorded by some, that haue

taken diligent obseruation of that tongue,Gerlach. apud C

            Of the ancient largenesse of the Roman tongue in the time of the Roman Empire. CHAP. III.
            
               THe ordinary bounds of the Romane Empire were, on the East part Euphrates, and sometimes Tigris: On the North the Riuers of Rhene & of Danubius, and the Euxine sea: On the West the Ocean: On the South the Cataracts of Nilus, in the vtmost border of Aegypt, and in Afrique the mountaine Atlas. Which, beginning in the West, on the shoare of the Ocean, ouer against the Canarie Ilands, runneth Eastward almost to Aegypt, being in few places distant from the Mediterrane sea, more then 200 miles. These I say, were the ordinary bounds of that Empire in the Continent: for, although the Romanes passed these bounds sometimes, specially toward the East and North, yet they kept little of what they wan, but within those bounds mentioned, the Empire was firmely established. But heere, in our great Isle of Britaine, the Pictes wall was the limit of it, passing by Newcastle, and Carleil, from Tinmouth on the East sea, to Solway frith on the West, being Spartian. in Hadriano & in Seuero. first begunne by the Emperour Adrian, and after finished or rather repaired, by Septimius Seuerus.
            
            To this greatnesse of Dominion, Rome at last arriued from her small beginnings. And small her

beginnings were indeed, considering the huge dominion to which she attained. For first, the Circuit of the Cittie wall, at the first building of it, by Romulus in Mount Palatine, could not be fully one mile: for the Hill it selfe, as is obserued by Andrea Fuluio,
               And▪ Fulu. l. 2. Antiq. Rom. Ca. 3. a Citizen and Antiquarie of Rome, hath no more in circuite: And, that Romulus bounded the Pomerium of the Citie (which extended somewhat beyond the wall) with the foot of that hill in compasse Gellius hath left registred.Gell. L. 13. C. 14. Strab. L. 1. Secondly the Territorie and liberties of Rome, as Strabo hath remembred, extended at the first, where it stretched farthest scarse six miles from the Citie. And thirdly, the first Inhabitants of Rome, as I finde recorded in Dionysius of Halicarnassus,
               Dionys Hal. l. 2. Antiq. Romanar. were not in number aboue 3300, at the most. Yet, with Time, and fortunate successe,Vopisc. in Aureliano, 
               Rome so increased, that in Aurelianus his time, the circuit of the Citie wall, was 50. miles, as Vopiscus hath recorded: And the Dominion, grew to the largenesse aboue mentioned, containing about 3000 miles in length, and about 1200 in breadth: and lastly the number of free Cittizens, euen in the time of Marius, that is long before forraine Citties and Countries, beganne to be receiued into participation of that freedome, was found to be 463000. as Eusebius hath remembred:Euseb. in Chronico. ad Olymp. 174. Of free Cittizens I say, (for they onely came into Cense) but if I should adde, their wiues, and Children, and seruants, that is, generally all the Inhabitants, Lipsius de Magni

                  . Romana. l. 3. c. 3. a learned man hath esteemed them, and not without great likelihood of truth, to haue beene no lesse, then 3. or 4. millions.
            
               Beyond these bounds therefore of the Romane Empire, (to speake to the point in hand) the Roman tongue could not be in any common vse, as neither, to speake of our kings dominions, in Ireland, Scotland, nor Northumberland, as being no subiects of the Romane Empire. And that within these bounds, it stretched farre and wide, (in such maner as I will afterward declare) two Principall causes there were. One was, the multitude of colonies, which partly to represse rebellion in the subdued Prouinces, partly to resist forrain inuasions, partly to reward the ancient soldiers, partly to abate the redundance of the City, & relieue the poorer sort, were sent foorth to inhabite in all the Prouinces of the Empire: Another, was the donation of Roman freedome, or Communication of the right and benefit of Romane Citizens, to very many of the Prouinciall, both Cities, and Regions. For first, all Italie obtained that freedome in the time of Sylla and Marius,
               Appian. l. 1. Ciuil longe ante med. at the compounding of the Italian war, as Appian hath recorded: All Italie I say, as then it was called, and bounded, with the Riuers of Rubicon and Arnus, that is, the narrower part of Italie, lying betwixt the Adriatique and the Tyrrhene seas. Secondly Iulius Caesar in like sort infranchized the rest of Italie, that is the broder part, named then Gallia Cisalpina, as is remembred by Dion.
               Dion. l. 41. But not long after, the forraine Prouinces also, began to be infranchized, Fraunce being indued with the libertie of Roman Citizens by Galba, as I find in Tacitus;

            These two as I haue said, were the principall causes of inlarging that language: yet other there were also, of great importance, to further it. For first, concerning Ambassages, suites, appeals, or whatsoeuer other businesse of the Prouincials, or forraines, nothing was allowed to be handled, or spoken in the Senate at Rome, but in the Latine tongue. Secondly, the Lawes whereby the prouinces were gouerned, were all written in that language, as being in all of them, excepting onely municipall Cities, the ordinarie Roman law. Thirdly, the Digest. l. 42 Tit. de re iudicata. Leg. Decret. Praetors of the Prouinces, were not allowed to deliuer their Iudgements saue in that language: and we read in Dion Cassius, of a principall man of Greece, that by Claudius was put from the order of Iudges,Dion. l. 57. Val. Maxim. l. 2 c. 2. for being ignorant of the Latine tongue: and to the same effect in Valerius Maximus, that the Romane Magistrates would not giue audience to the Grecians, (lesse therefore I take it to the Barbarous nations) saue in the Latine tongue. Fourthly the generall schooles, erected in sundry Cities of the Prouinces, wherof we finde mention in Tacitus,

               Hierome, and others (in which the Roman tongue was the ordinary and allowed speech, as is vsuall in vniuersities till this day) was no small furtherance to that language. And, to conclude that the Romans had generally (at least in the after times,

when Rome was become a Monarchy, and in the flourish of the Empire) great care to inlarge their tongue, together with their dominion, is by Augustine in his bookes de Ciuitate Dei,

                for a fauour, and at their suite, that they might publiquely vse the Romane tongue, not fully 140 yeares before the beginning of the Emperours: And yet was Cuma but about 100 miles distant from Rome, and at that time the Romanes had conquered all Italie, Sicilie, Sardinia, and a great part of Spaine.
            
            But yet in all the Prouinces of the Empire, the Romane tongue found not alike acceptance, and successe, but most inlarged and spread it selfe toward the North, and West, and South bounds, for first, that in al the regions of Pannonia it was known Velleius is mine Author:Vellei. lib. 2.

               ▪ And it seemeth the sermons of Cyprian, and Augustine, yet extant, (of Augustine it is manifest) that they preached to the people in latin. But in the East parts of the Empire, as in Greece, and Asia, and so likewise in Afrique, from the greater Syrtis Eastward, I cannot in my reading finde that the Roman tongue euer grew into any common vse. And the reason of it seemes to be, for that in those parts of the Empire it became most frequent, where the most, and greatest Roman Colonies,

were planted. And therefore ouer all Italy, it became in a maner vulgar, wherin I haue obserued in Histories, and in registers of ancient inscriptions, to haue beene planted by the Romanes at seuerall times aboue 150 Colonies: as in Afrique also nere 60, (namely 57) in Spaine 29. in Fraunce, as it stretched to Rhene 26, and so in Illyricum, and other North parts of the Empire, betweene the Adriatique sea, and Danubius verie manie. And yet I doubt not, but in all these parts, more there were, then any historie or ancient inscription that now remaines hath remembred.
            And contrariewise in those Countries, where fewest Colonies were planted, the Latine tongue grew nothing so common: as for example heere in Britaine, there were but foure: those were Eboracum

                and to be briefe, Syria, onely excepted, which had about 20 Romane Colonies, but most of them late planted, especially by Septimius Seuerus, and his sonne Bassianus, to strengthen that side of the Empire against the Parthians (and yet I find not that in Syria, the Romane tongue, euer obtained any vulgar vse) the rest, had but verie few, in proportion to the largenesse of those regions.
            Of which little estimation, and vse of the Roman tongue, in the East parts, beside the want of Colonies forementioned, and to omit their loue to their owne languages, which they held to be more ciuill then the Roman, another great cause was the Greek, which they had in farre greater account, both, for learning sake (insomuch that Cicero confesseth, Graeca (saith he) leguntur in omnibus fere gentibus,

many others, so that of all the writers that liued in Asia, or in Afrique, beyond the greater Syrtis, I thinke wee haue not one Author in the Latine tongue: and yet more euidently, may it appeare by another instance, that I finde in the third generall Counsell held at Ephesus,

            First therefore, it is certainely obserued, that there are at this day, foureteene mother tongues in Europe (beside the Latine) which remaine, not onely not abolished, but little or nothing altered, or impaired by the Romanes. And those are the 1 Irish, spoken in Ireland, and a good part of Scotland: the 2 Brittish, in Wales, Cornewaile, and Brittaine of Fraunce: the 3 Cantabrian neere the Ocean,Scaligan Diatrib de ling Europ

Fris. Oriental. although to straungers they speake Dutch, yet among themselues they vse a peculiar language of their owne: the 8 Slauonish, in Polonia, Bohemia, Moscouia, Russia, and many other regions, (wherof I will after intreate in due place) although with notable difference of dialect, as also the Brittish, and Dutch, in the countries mentioned haue: the old 9 Illyrian, in the Isle of Veggia, on the East side of Istria in the day of Liburnia: the 10 Greeke, in Greece, and the Islands about it, and part of Macedon, and of Thrace: the old 11 Epirotique

vtterly differing from the Hungarian language: And lastly, the 14 Tarturian, of the Precopenses, betweene the Riuers of Tanais and Borysthenes, neere Maeotis and the Euxine sea, for, of the English, Italian, Spanish, and French, as being deriuations, or rather degenerations, the first of the Dutch, and the other three of the Latine, seeing I now speake onely of originall or mother languages, I must bee silent: And of all these foureteene it is certaine, except the Arabique, which is known to haue entred since, and perhaps the Hungarian, about which there is difference among Antiquaries, that they were in Europe in time of the Romane Empire, and sixe or seuen of them, within the Limites of the Empire.
            And indeede, how hard a matter it is, vtterly to abolish a vulgar language, in a populous country, where the Conquerers are in number farre inferiour to the natiue inhabitants, whatsoeuer art bee practized to bring it about, may well appeare by the vaine attempt of our Norman Conquerour: who although he compelled the English, to teach their young children in the Schooles nothing but French, and set downe all the Lawes of the Land in French, and inforced all pleadings at the Law to be performed in that language (which custome continued till King Edward the third his daies, who disanulled it) purposing thereby to haue conquered the language together with the land, and to haue made all French: yet, the number of English farre exceeding the Normans, all was but labour lost, and obtained no further effect, then the mingling

of a few French words with the English. And euen such also was the successe of the Franks among the Gaules, of the Gothes among the Italians and Spanyards, and may be obserued, to be short in all such conquests, where the Conquerors (being yet in number farre inferiour) mingle themselues with the natiue inhabitants. So that, in those Coū
               tries onely the mutation of languages hath ensued vpon conquests, where either the ancient inhabitants haue beene destroyed or driuen forth, as wee see in our Country to haue followed of the Saxons victories, against the Brittains, or else at least in such sort diminished, that in number they remained inferior, or but little superior to the Conquerors, whose reputation and authority might preuaile more then a small excesse of multitude. But (that I digresse no further) because certaine Countries are specially alleaged, in which the Romaine tongue is supposed most to haue preuailed, I will restraine my discourse to them alone.
            And First, that both the Punique and Gallique tongues, remained in the time of Alexander Seuerus the Emperour (about 230 yeares after our Sauiours birth) appeareth by Vlpian, who liued at that time, and was with the Emperour of principall reputation, teaching, that Digest. l. 32. lege. Fidei commissa. 
               Fidei commissa might be left, not onely in Latine, or Greeke, but in the Punique or Gallique, or any other vulgar language. Till that time therefore, it seemeth euident, that the Romane tongue had not swallowed vp these vulgar languages, and it selfe become vulgar in stead of them. But to insist a little in either

seuerally. First, touching the Punique, Aurelius, Victor hath recorded of Septimius Seuerus,

               Leptis a Roman Colonie) that the Emperour blushed at it. Secondly long after that, Hierome hath recorded of his time, that the Africans had somewhat altered their lanuage, from the Phaenicians: the language therefore then remained, for else how could he pronounce of the present difference? Thirdly, Augustine (somewhat yonger then Hierom, though liuing at the same time) writeth, not onely, that August. de C

Apost another place, mentioning a knowne Punique prouerb, he would speake it (he said) in the Latine, because all his auditors (for Hippo where he preached was a Roman Colonie) vnderstood not the Punique tongue: And some Id. Expos. in Chrat. epist ad Roman. other passages could I alleage out of Augustine, for the direct confirmation of this point, if these were not euident and effectuall enough. Lastly, Leo Africanus,
               Leo 1. Africa, Lt. descript. Africae. cap. de Ling. Africanis. a man of late time, and good reputation, affirmeth that there remaine yet in Barbarie, very many, descended of the old inhabitants, that speake the African tongue, whereby it is apparent, that it was neuer extinguished by the Romanes.
            
            
               Secondly, touching the ancient Gallique tongue, that it also remained, and was not abolished by the Romane in the time of Strabo, who flourished vnder Tiberius Caesars gouernment, it appeareth in the fourth booke of his Geographie,

               Strabo hath recorded, that the Romane tongue was spoken in Spaine, yet he speaketh not indefinitely, but addeth a limitation, namely, about Baetis. And that in that

            And as for these reasons it may well seeme that the Roman tongue became not the vulgar language in any of these parts of the Empire, which yet are specially instanced, for the large vulgarity of it So haue I other reasons to perswade mee, that it was not in those parts, nor in any other forraine Countries subiect to the Empire, either generally or perfectly spoken. Not generally (I say) because it is hard to conceaue, that any whole Countries, specially because so large as the mentioned are,

should generally speake two languages, their owne natiue and the Romane. Secondly, there was not anie law at all of the Romanes, to inforce the subdued nations, either to vse vulgarly the Roman tongue, or not to vse their owne natiue languages (and very extreame and vnreasonable, had such Lords bene, as should compell men by lawes, both to do, and to speak, only what pleased them.) Neither doe I see any other necessitie, or any prouocation, to bring them to it, except for some speciall sorts of men, as Merchants, and Cittizens, for their better traffique and trade, Lawyers for the knowledge and practise of the Roman Lawes, which carried force throughout the Empire (except priuiledged places) scholers for learning, souldiers, for their better conuersing with the Romane Legions, and with the Latines, Trauailers, Gentlemen, Officers, or such other, as might haue occasion of affaires and dealing with the Romans. But it soundeth altogether vnlike a truth, that the poore scattered people, abroade in the Country, dwelling either in solitarie places, or in the small townes, and villages, either generally spake it, or could possibly attaine vnto it. An example wherof, for the better euidence, may at this day be noted; in those parts of Greece, which are subiect to the dominions of the Turks and Venetians: for as Bellonius hath obserued, the people that dwell in the principall townes,Bellon.

            Of the beginnig of the Italian, French and Spanish languages. CHAP. V.
            
               THe common opinion, which supposeth that these Nations in the flourish of the Romane Empire, spake vulgarly and rightly the Latine tongue, is, that the mixture of the Northerne barbarous nations among the ancient Inhabitants, was the cause of changing the Latine tongue, into the languages which now they speak, the languages becomming mingled, as the nations themselues were. Who, while they were inforced to attemper and frame their speech, one to the vnderstanding of another, for else they could not mutually expresse their mindes (which is the end for which nature hath giuen speech to men) they degenerated both, and so came to this medly wherein now we finde them.
            Which opinion if it were true, the Italian tongue must of necessitie haue it beginning about the 480 yeare of our Sauiour: Because, at that time, the Barbarous nations began first to inhabite Italie, vnder Odoacer, for although they had entred and wasted Italie long before, as first, the Gothes vnder Alaricus, about the yeare 414: Then the Hunnes together with the Gothes, and the Herula, and the Gepidi, and other Northerne people

vnder Attila, about An. 450, Then, the Wandales vnder Gensericus, crossing the sea out of Afrique about An. 456. (to omit some other inuations of those barbarous nations, because they prospered not) yet none of these, setled themselues to stay and inhabite Italie, till the Heruli as I sayd vnder Odoacer, about An. 480 on a little before, entred and possessed it neere hand 20 yeares, He being (proclaymed by the Romans themselues) King of Italie, about 16 yeares, and his people becomming inhabiters of the Country. But, they also, within 20 yeares after their entrance, were in a maner rooted out of Italie, by Theodoricus King of Gothes, who allotted them onely a part of Piemont aboue Turin to inhabite: for Theodoricus being by Zeno then Emperour, inuested with the title of King of Italie, and hauing ouercome Odoacer, somewhat afore the yeare 500, ruled peaceably a long time, as King of Italie, and certaine others of the Gothes nation succeeded after him in the same gouernement, the Gothes in the meane space, growing into one with the Italians, for the space neere hand of 60. yeares togither. And although after that, the dominion of Italie, was by Narses againe recouered to the Empire, in the time of Iustinian, and many of the Gothes expelled Italie, yet farre more of them remained, Italie in that long time, being growen well with their seed and posteritie. The Heruli therefore, with their associats were the first, and the Gothes the second, of the barbarous nations, that inhabited Italie. The third and the last, were the Langbards, who comming into Italie about the yeare 570, and

long time obtaining the dominion, and possession, in a maner of all Italie, namely about 200 yeares, and during the succession of 20 Kings or more, were neuer expelled forth of Italie, although at last their dominion was sore broken by Pipin King of Fraunce, and after, more defaced, by his sonne Charles the great, who first restrained and confined it, to that part, which to this day, of them retayneth the name of Lombardie, and shortly after vtterly extinguished it, carrying away their last King captiue into Fraunce. Now although diuers Blond in Ital. Illustrata in Marchia Triuisana. antiquaries of Italie there be, which referre the beginning of the Italian tongue, and the change of the Latine into it, to these third inhabitants of Italie the Langbards,Tinto della Nobilta. diuerona. l. 2. ca. 2. & alij. by reason of their long and perfect coalition into one with the Italian people: yet certainly, the Italian tongue was more ancient then so, for besides that there remains yet to be seen (as mē 
               Lips. de Pronuntiat Ling. lat. cap. 3. & Merul. par. 2. Cosmogr. l. 4. c. 18. worthie of credit report) in the K. of Fraunce his Librarie at Paris, an Instrument written in the Italian tongue, in the time of Iustinian the first, which was before the comming of the Langbards into Italie: another euidence more vulgar, to this effect, is to be found in Paulus Diaconus his miscellane history:Paul Diacon. hist. Miscel. l. 17. longe ante med. where we read, that in the Emperour Mauritius his time, about the yeare 590, when the Langbards had indeed entred, and wasted Gallia Cisalpina, but had not inuaded the Roman dition in Italie, that by the acclamation of the word Torna, Torna, (plaine Italian) which a Roman souldier spake to one of his fellowes afore, whose beast had ouerturned his burthen) the whole armie (marching in the darke)

began to crie out, torna, torna, and so fell to flying away.
            But the French tongue, if that afore mentioned were the cause of it, began a little before, in the time of Valentinian the 3, when in a maner, all the West part of the Empire fell away, (and among the rest, our Country of England, being first forsaken of the Romans themselues, by reason of grieuous warres at their owne doores, and not long after, conquered and possessed by the Saxons, whose posteritie for the most part we are) namely, about the yeare 450: Fraunce being then subdued, and peaceably possessed, by the Franks and Burgundions nations of Germanie: the Burgundions occupying the Eastward and outward parts of it, toward the riuer of Rhene, and the Franks all the inner region. For although Fraunce before that had beene inuaded by the Wandali, Sueui, and Alani, and after by the Gothes, who hauing obtained Aquitayn for their seate and habitation, by the grant of the Emperor Honorius, expelled the former into Spaine about An. 410: yet notwithstanding, till the Conquest made by the Franks and Burgundions, it was not generally, nor for any long time mingled with strangers, which after that Conquest beganne to spread ouer Fraunce, and to become natiue Inhabitants of the Country.
            But of all, the Spanish tongue for this cause, must necessarilie be most ancient: for the Wandali & Alani, being expelled Fraunce, about the yeare 410, began then to inuade and to inhabite Spaine which they held & possessed many yeares, till the Gothes
               
being expelled by the Franks and Burgundians, out of France into Spaine, expelled them out of Spaine into Afrique (the Barbarous nations thus like nailes driuing out one another) and not onely them, but with them all the remnants of the Roman garrisons, and gouernment, and so becomming the entier Lords and quiet possessours of all the Country, from whom also the Kings of Spaine that now are, be descended. Notwithstanding, euen they also, within lesse then 300 yeares after, were driuen by the Saracens of Afrique into the northerne and mountainous parts of Spaine, namely Asturia, Biscay, and Guipuscoa, till after a long course of time, by little and little they recouered it, out of their hands againe, which was at last fully accomplished by Ferdinand not past 120 yeares ago, there hauing passed in the meane time, from the Mores first entrance of Spaine at Gibraltar, till their laft possession in Granada, about 770 yeares.
            Whereby you may see also, when the Romane tongue began to degenerate in Afrique, (if that also, as is supposed spake vulgarly the Latine tongue and if the mixture of barbarous people were cause of the decay, & corruption of it) namely, about the yeare 430, for about that time, the Wandali and Alani, partly wearied with the Gottish warre in Spaine, and partly inuited by the Gouernour Bonifacius, entred Afrique, vnder the leading of Gensericus, a part whereof for a time, they held quietly, for the Emperour Valentinianus guift: But shortly after, in the same Emperours time, when all the West Prouinces in a maner fell vtterly away

from the Empire, they also tooke Carthage; and all the Pronince about it, from the Romanes. And although the dominion of Afrique was regained by Bellisarius to the Empire almost 100 yeares after, in Iustinians time, yet in the time of the Emperour Leontius, (almost 700 yeares after our Sauiours birth) it was lost againe, being anew conquered, and possessed by the Sarracens of Arabia (and to this day remaineth in their hands) bringing together with their victories, the language also, and religion, (Mahumetanisme) into all that coast of Afrique, euen from Aegypt to the Strait of Gibraltar, aboue 2000 miles in length.
            About which time also, namely during the gouernment of Valentinian the 3. Bulgaria, Seruia, Boscina, Hungarie, Austria, Stiria, Carinthia, Bauaria and Sueuia (that is, all the North-border of the Empire, along the riuer Danubius) and some part of Thrace, was spoiled and possessed by the Hunnes, who yet principally planted themselues in the Lower Pannonia, whence it obtained the name of Hungarie.
            
            Out of which discourse you may obserue these two points. First, what the Countries were, in which those wandring and warring nations after many transmigrations from place to place, fixed at last their finall residence and habitation. Namely the Hunnes in Pannonia, the Wandales in Afrique, the East Gothes and Langbards in Italie the West Gothes in Aquitaine and Spaine, which being both originally but one Nation, gained these names of East and West Gothes, from the position of these Countries which they conquered and inhabited,

the other barbarous nations of obscurer names, being partly consumed with the warre, and partly passing into the more famous appellations. And Secondly, you may obserue, that the maine dissolution of the Empire, especially in Europe and Afrique, fell in the time of Valentinian the third about the yeare 450. being caused by the barbarous nations of the North (as after did the like dissolution of the same Empire in Asia, by the Arabians in the time of Heraclius about the yeare 640) and together with the ruine of the Empire in the West by the inundation of the foresaid barbarous Natitions, the Latine tongue in all the Countries where it was vulgarly spoken (if it were rightly spoken any where in the West) became corrupted.
            Wherefore if the Spanish, French and Italian tongues, proceeded from this cause, as a great number of learned men, suppose they did, you see what the antiquity of them is; But to deliuer plainly my opinion, hauing searched as farre as I could, into the originals of those languages, and hauing pondered what in my reading, and in my reason I found touching them, I am of another minde (as some learned men also are) namely, that all those tongues are more auncient, and haue not sprung from the corruption of the Latine tongue, by the inundation and mixture of barbarous people in these prouinces, but from the first vnperfect impression and receauing of it, in those forraine Countries. Which vnperfectnesse notwithstāding of the Roman tongue in those parts, although it had, as I take it beginning from this euill framing of forraine

tongues, to the right pronouncing of the Latine, yet I withall easily beleeue, and acknowledge, that it was greatly increased, by the mixture and coalition of the barbarous Nations. So that me thinkes, I haue obserued three degrees of corruption in the Roman tongue, by the degenerating whereof, these languages are supposed to haue receaued their beginning. The first of them, was in Rome it selfe, where, towards the latter end of the Common wealth, and after, in the time of the Empire, the infinite multitude of seruants (which exceedingly exceeded the number of free borne Citizens) together with the vnspeakeable confluence of straungers, from all prouinces, did much impaire the purenesse of their language, and as Isidore hath obserued brought manie barbarismes and solaecismes into it. Insomuch, that Tertullian in his time,Isidor. Origin. l. 9. c. 1. Tertul. in Apologet. adu. Gentes cap. 6. when as yet none of the barbarous nations had by inuasion touched Italie (for he liued vnder Septimius Seuerus gouernment) chargeth the Romanes to haue renounced the language of their fathers. The Second steppe, was the vnperfect impression (that I touched before) made of the Romane tongue abroad in the forraine prouinces among straungers, whose tongues could not perfectly frame to speake it aright. And certainely, if the Italians themselues, as is remembred by Cicero failed of the right and perfect Romane pronounciation,Cicer. l. 3 de Oratore. I see not how the tongues of strange Nations, such as the Gaules and Spanyards were, should exactly vtter it. And the Third, was that mixture of manie barbarous people (to which others

attribute the beginning of the languages in question) which made the Latine, that was before vnperfect, yet more corrupt then they found it, both for words and for pronouncing: So that, I rather thinke the barbarous people to haue beene a cause of increasing the corruption, and of further alteration and departure of those languages from the Romane, then of beginning them. And me thinkes I haue very good reasons so to bee perswaded beeside all the arguments abou

                mentioned, which I produced, both for the remaining of the vulgar languages and for the vnperfect speaking of the Romane tongue in the prouinces.

                   multi. learned men, the Germane tongue, which hath but small affinitie or agreement, with either the Italian, French or Spanish tongues. Secondly, because among all the auncient writers (and they are many) which haue written of the miserable changes, made in these West parts of the world, by those infinite swarmes of barbarous people, I finde not one, that mentioneth the change of any of these languages to haue beene caused by them: which me thinkes some auncient writers among so many learned, as those times, and those very Countries, abounded withall, and whose writings yet remaine, would certainely haue recorded. But though wee finde mention in soundrie auncient writers, of changing these languages into the Romane (whom yet I vnderstand of that vnperfect change before touched) yet nothing is found of any rechanging of those

languages from the Romane, into the state wherein now they are. But it is become a question onely of some late searchers of Antiquitie, but of such, as determine in this point, without either sound reason or good countenance of Antiquitie.
         
         
            Obiections touching the extent of the Latine tongue and the beginning of the mentioned Languages with their solutions. CHAP. VI.
            
               THese reasons perhaps (ioyned with the other aboue alleaged whereby I endeauoured to prooue that the latine tongue perfectly spoken, was neuer the vulgar language of the Romane prouinces) may perswade you as they haue done mee, that the barbarous nations of the north, were not the first corrupters of the latine tongue, in the prouinces subiect to Rome, nor the beginners of the Italian, French and Spanish tongues: yet some difficulties I finde (I confesse) in writers touching these points, which when I haue resolued my opinion will appeare the more credible.
            One is out of Plutarch in his Platonique questions,Plutarch. in quest. platonic. quaest. 9. affirming that in his time all men in a manner spake the latin tongue.
            Another before touched that Strabo recordeth

the Romane tongue to haue bene spoken in Spaine and France,
               Strab. l. 3. & 4. Apul in Floridis. and Apuleius in Africke, which also may appeare by sundry places in Augustine, whose sermons seeme (as Cyprians also) to haue bin made to the people in that language.
            A third, how it falleth if these vulgar tongues of adulterate latin be so ancient, that nothing is found written in any of them of any great antiquity?
            A fourth, how in Rome and Latium, where the Latine tongue was out of question, natiue, the latin could so degenerate, as at this day is found in the Italian tongue, except by some forraine corruption?
            To the first of these I answere, either that as Diuines are wont to interpret many generall propositions, Plutarch is to be vnderstood de generibus singulorum, not de singulis generum: So that the latine tongue was spoken almost in euery nation, but not of euery one in any forraine nation: Or else, that they spake the latine indeed, but yet vnperfectly and corruptly, as their tongues would frame to vtter it.
            To the second I answere: first, that Strabo speaketh not generally of France or Spaine, but with limitation to certaine parts of both, the Prouince of Narbon in France, and the tract about Boetis in Spaine. Secondly, that although they speake it, yet it followeth not, that they speake it perfectly and aright, (except perhaps in the Colonies) so that I wil not deny but it might be spoken abroad in the Prouinces, yet I say it was spoken corruptly, according as the peoples tongues would fashion to it,

namely in such sort, that although the matter and body of the words, were for the most part latine, yet the forme and sound of them varied from the right pronouncing: which speech notwithstanding was named Latin, partly for the reason now touched, and partly, because they learned it from the Romanes or Latines, as the Spaniards call their language Romance till this day, which yet we know to differ much from the right Romane tongue:Nithard. d

               Carthage, wherof Cyprian was Archbishop, were Romane Colonies, consisting for the most part of the progenie of Romanes, for which sort of Citties, there was speciall reason. Although neither in the Colonies themselues (as it seemeth) the Romane tong was altogether vncorrupt, both for that which I alleadged before out of Spartianus of Seuerus his sister dwelling at Leptis, and for that which I remembred out of Augustine for Hippo, where they spake Enar

               Dolus, for Os and Florehit and dolor, (& yet were both Leptis & Hippo Romane Colonies): And yet it appeareth further by Augustine, that in their translations of the Scriptures, and in the Psalms sung in their Churches, they had these

corruptions, where yet (as it is like) their most corrupt and vulgar latine had not place.
            To the third I answere, that two reasons of it may be assigned: One, that learned men would rather write, in the learned and grammaticall, then in the vulgar and prouinciall latine. Another, that the workes of vnlearned men would hardly continue till our times, seeing euen of the learned anciēt writings, but few of infinite, haue remained. Furthermore it is obserued of the Germane tongue, by Tschudas and of the French by Genebrard,

            To the fourth I say, that there is no language, which of ordinary course is not subiect to change, although there were no forraine occasion at all: which the very fancies of men, weary of old words (as of old things) is able enough to worke, which may be wel proued by obseruations and instances of former changes, in this very tongue (the latine) whereof I now dispute.Quint

In which time notwithstanding, they receiued very few strangers into their Cittie, which mixture might cause such alteration, and the difference of time was but about 350. yeares. And yet to adde one instance more, of a shorter reuolution of time, and a cleerer euidence of the change, that the Roman tongue was subiect to, and that, when no forraine cause thereof can bee alleadged: There remaineth at this day (as it is certainly Vid.

But (to let forrain toungs passe) of the great alteration that time is wont to worke in languages, our owne tongue may afford vs examples euident enough: wherein since the times neere after, and about the Conquest, the change hath beene so great, as I my selfe haue seen some euidences made in the time of King Henrie the first, whereof I was able to vnderstand but few words. To which purpose also, a certaine remembrance is to bee found in Holinsheds Chronicle, in the end of the Conquerours raigne, in a Charter giuen by him to the Citie of London.
         
         
            
            Of the ancient Languages of Italie, Spaine Fraunce and Afrique. CHAP. VII.
            
               BVt if the discourse of these points of Antiquitie, in handling whereof I haue declared, that while the Roman Empire flourished, it neuer abolished the vulgar languages, in Fraunce, or Spaine or Afrique, howsoeuer in Italie. If that discourse I say, mooue in you perhaps a desire, to know what the ancient vulgar languages of these parts were: I will also in that point, out of my reading and search into Antiquitie, giue you the best satisfaction that I can.
            And first for Italie: Certaine it is, that many were the ancient tongues in the seuerall Prouinces of it, tongues I say, not dialects, for they were many more. In Apulia, the Mesapian tongue: In Tuscanie and Vmbria, the Hetruscan, both of them vtterly perished:Inscript. ver. pag. 143.144.145.146. Yet in the booke of ancient Inscriptions, set forth by Gruter, and Scaliger, there be some few monuments registred of these languages, but not vnderstood now of any man. In Calabria both the higher and lower, and farre along the maritime coast of the Tyrrhene sea, the Greeke. In Latium (now Campagna di Roma) The Latine. In Lombardie, and

               Liguria, the old tongue of Fraunce whatsoeuer it was. Of which last three, the two former are vtterly ceased to be vulgar: and the third, no where to be found in Italie, but to be sought for in some other Countrey, And although, beside these fiue, we find mention, in ancient writings of the Sabine, the Oscan, the Tusculan, and some other tongues in Italie, yet were they no other then differing dialects of some of the former languages, as by good obseruations, out of Varro, Festus, Seruius, Paul. Diaconus, and others, might be easily prooued.
            Secondly, of France what the ancient tong was, hath bin much disputed, and yet remaineth somewhat vncertain; Some thinking it to haue been the Germane others the Greeke, and some the Walsh tong. But,

Strab. l. 4. in princip. if the meaning of these resoluers bee, that one language, whatsoeuer it were, was vulgar in all Fraunce, they are very farre wide, Caesar and Strabo hauing both recorded, that there were diuerse languages spoken in the diuers parts. But, to omit the speech of Aquitaine, which Strabo writeth to haue had much affinitie with the Spanish: And, of that part, (in Caesar called Belgia) that at the riuer of Rhene confined with Germanie, which for that neighbourhood, might partake much of the German tongue: To omit those I say, the maine question is, about the language of the Celtae, which as inhabiting the middle part of Fraunce, were least of all infected with any forraine mixture. And certainly, that it was not the Greeke, appeareth out of Caesar,
               Caes. l. 5. de Bello Gallic. long post. med. writing to Q. Cicero, then besieged by the Gaules) in Greeke, lest the Gaules should intercept

his letters: And secondly, no lesse euidently by Varro,

The Greeke therfore, was not the ancient natiue language of the Gaules; Neither was it the Germane: for else it had beene but an odde relation and reason of Caesars,
               Caes. l de Bello Gallico. Tacit l de Mor. Germanor. prope finem. Sueton. in Caligula c. 47. that Ariouistus a German Prince, had liued so long in Gallia, that hee spake the Gallique tongue: And that of Tacitus, that the Gallique tongue proued the Gothines to be no Germanes: and that of Suetonius, that Caligula compelled many of the Gaules to learn the Germane tongue.Hottom. in Fran. cogall. c. 2. But Hottoman (of all that I haue read) speaking most distinctly, touching the originall and composition of the French tongue, diuideth it as now it is spoken, equally into two parts, of which he supposeth the one (and I thinke it is rather the greater part) to haue originall from the Latine tongue: and the other halfe, to be made vp,Perion. l de Cognat. Ling. Gal. & Graecae Postell. l. de 12. Ling. by the German and Greeke, and Brittish or Walsh words, each almost in equall measure. Of the deduction of the French words from the Greeke, you may read Perionius, Postell, and others: Of those from the Germane, Tschudus, Goropius, Isacius &c. Of the Walsh Lhuid,

               Camden &c. Which last indeed for good reason, seemeth to haue beene the natiue language of the ancient Celtae, rather then either the Greeke or Dutch tongues: for of the Greeke words found in that language, the neighbourhood of the

Strab. l. 4. and their Colonies, inhabiting the maritime coast of Prouince, together with the ready acceptance of that language in Fraunce, (mentioned by Strabo) may bee the cause: As likewise of the Germane words, the Franks and Burgundions conquest, and possession of Fraunce, may bee assigned for a good reason: But of the Brittish words none at all can be iustly giuen, saue, that they are the remnants of the ancient language. Secondly, it seemeth to be so by Tacitus,
               Tacit. in Iulio Agricola. writing, that the speech of the Gaules, little differed from that of the Brittaines. And thirdly, by Caesar,
               Caes l 6. de Bel. Gallico. recording, that it was the custome of the Gaules that were studious of the Druides discipline, often to passe ouer into Brittaine to bee there instructed: wherefore seeing there was no vse of bookes among them, as is in the same place affirmed by Caesar, it is apparent that they spake the same language.
            Thirdly, the Spanish tongue as now it is, consisteth of the old Spanish, Latine, Gottish, and Arabique (as there is goood reason it should, Spaine hauing beene so long, in the possessions of the Romanes, Gothes, and Mores) of which, the latine is the greatest part, (next it the Arabique) and therefore they themselues call their language Romance. And certainely I haue seene an epistle written by a Spaniard, whereof euery word was both good Latine & good Spanish, & an example of the like is to be seene in Merula.
               Merul. Cosmogr. part. 2. l. 2. c. 8. But the language of Valentia and Catalonia, and part of Portugall, is much tempered with the French also. Now the ancient and most generall language of Spaine, spoken ouer the Country

before the Romanes conquest, seemeth to mee out of question, to haue beene, the Cantabrian tong, that namely which yet they speak in Biscay, Guipuscoa, Nauarre, and Asturia, that is to say, in the northerne and mountainous parts of Spaine, neare the Ocean, with which the Vasconian tongue also in Aquitaine, neere the Pyrene hilles, hath as there is good reason (for out of those parts of Spaine the inhabitants of Gascoigne came) much affinitie and agreement. And my reason for this opinion is, that in that part of Spaine, the people haue euer continued without mixture of any forraine nation as being neuer subdued by the Carthaginians, nor by the Mores, no, nor by the Romans, (for all their long warring in Spaine) before Augustus Caesars time, and for the hillinesse, and barenesse, and vnpleasantnesse of the Countrey, hauing nothing in it, to inuite strangers to dwell among them. For which cause, the most ancient Nations and languages are for the most part preserued in such Countryes: as by Thucydides is specially obserued,Thucyd. l. 1. paul. a princip. of the Attiques, and Arcadians, in Greece, dwelling in barren soiles: Of which nations the first, for their Antiquitie, vaunted of themselues that they were 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , and the second, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , as if they had beene bred immediately of the Earth, or borne before the Moone. Another example whereof wee may see in Spaine it selfe, for in the steepy mountaines of Granata, named Alpuxarras, the progeny of the Mores yet retaine the Arabique tongue (for the Spaniards call it Arauiga) which all the other remnants of the Mores in the plainer region had vtterly

forgotten, and receiued the Castilian (till their late expulsion out of Spaine) for their vulgar language. The like whereof, is also to be seene in the old Epirotique speech and nation, which yet continueth in the mountainous part of Epirus, being (for the tongue) vtterly extinguished in all the Country beside. And (to let forraine instances goe) in the Brittaines or Welsh-men in the hillie part of our owne Country. What the reason thereof may be, I will not stand now curiously to enquire: whether that being inured to labour, to watching, to sundry distemperatures of the aire, and much other hardnesse (for otherwise their liuing will not be gotten of such barren ground) they prooue vpon occcasion good and able souldiers? Or, that the craggie rockes and hilles (like fortresses of natures owne erecting) are easily defended from forraine inuaders? Or that their vnpleasant and fruitlesse? soile, hath nothing to inuite strangers to desire it? Or, that wanting richesse, they want also the ordinary companions of richesse, that is proud and audacious hearts, to prouoke with their iniuries other nations to be reuenged on them, either by the conquest or desolation of their Countries? But whatsoeuer the cause may be, certainely in effect so it is, that the most ancient Nations and Languages, are for the most part to be found in such vnpleasant and fruitlesse regions: Insomuch that the Biscaynes who gaue me occasion of this digression, vaunt of themselues among the Spanyards, that they are the right Hidalgos, (that is gentlemen) as some also report of the Welsh-men heere in Brittaine
               
to say of themselues, which yet I that am their neighbour, (to confesse a truth) neuer heard them say.
            Now lastly touching the Punique tongue, as I am not of Galateus his opinion,Galat. de 
                     〈…〉

Galeott. de doctr. promiscua. cap. 6. & alij multi. manie other learned men are: namely, that it was the Arabique, that is to say the same language, that is vulgar in Afrique at this day. For it is well knowen to the skilfull in histories, that the Puniques were of another off-spring (not of Arabian race) and that it is not yet a thousand yeares, since that tongue was by the Arabians together with their victories brought into Afrique. And as certaine also it is, that the remnants of the Africans progenie, as Leo Afric. l. 1. Descrip. Afr. cap. de Ling. Africae. Flo. in Epitom Liu l. 51. Strab. l. 17. 
               Leo Africanus hath recorded, haue a different language from the Arabique. But the Punique tongue seemeth to me out of question, to haue beene the Chananitish or old Hebrew language, though I doubt not somwhat altered from the original pronuntiation, as is wont in tract of time, to befall Colonies, planted among strangers farre from home. For first, Carthage it selfe, the Queene of the Cities of Afrique (and well might she be termed so, that contained in circuit 24 miles, as Florus in his abridgement of Liuie hath recorded, and by the vtter wall 360 furlongs (that is 45 miles) as it is in Strabo: And held out in emulation with Rome as is noted by Plinie, 120 yeare, and to conclude (before the second Punique warre) had in subiection all the coast of the mediterrane sea,Plin. l. 15. c. 18. from the bottome of the greater

But in many olde coynes that I haue seen, I haue noted the Palme tree as the speciall cognisance of Phoenicia, (as I haue also the Oliue branch and Conies to be of Spain: the Horse of Mauritania: the Elephant, or the spoile of the Elephāt of Afrique: the Camell, of Arabia: the Crocodile, or the bird Ibis, of Aegypt: and diuers other specialties for other countries:) And namely I haue seene, sundrie olde coynes of the Emperour Vespatian, of seuerall deuises and imagerie, stamped for a memoriall of his conquest of Iudaea, and taking of Ierusalem (for the inscription is in euery of them, Iudaea capta) and in each of them I specially obserued a woman sitting in a sad and mournefull fashion, with her back to a Palme tree: wherein, I make no doubt, but the desolate woman signifieth Iudaea, and the Palme Phoenicia, euen as Phoenicia is immediately toward the north, at the backe of Iudaea.

Seeing therefore out of this part of the land of Canaan (for in this part Tyrus was) the Carthaginians, and other colonies of the Phaenicians in Afrique came, it is out of all doubt, that they were of the Chananites progenie:August expos:

               Austine himselfe doth interprete them, Canaanites.
            
            Certaine therefore it is that the natiue Punique langauge was not the Chanaanitish tongue: but that I added for explication this clause, (or the olde Hebrew, meaning by the olde Hebrew that which was vulgarly spoken among the Iewes before the captiuity) you will perhaps suspect my credite, and bee offended, for I am not ignorant, how superstitiously Diuines for the most part are affected toward the Hebrew tongue: yet when I had set downe the Africans language to haue beene the Canaanitish tongue, I thought good to adde for plainesse sake (or the old Hebrew) because J take them indeede to be the very same language, and that Abraham and his posterity, brought it not out of Chaldaea, but learned it in the land of Chanaan.

And certainely touching the difference that was betweene the Hebrew and the Punique, I make no doubt, but the great distance from their primitiue habitation, and their conuersation with strangers among whom they were planted, and together with both, the length of time, which is wont to bring alteration to all the languages in the world, were the causes of it.

            But yet is not the Slauonique tongue (to answere your question) for all this large extent, the vulgar language of the Turkish Empire. For of the Turks dominion onely Epirus, the west part of Macedon, Bosina, Seruia, Bulgaria, Rascia, and part of Thrace, & that hee hath in Dalmatia and Croacia, (beside the Mengrelli in Asia) speake vulgarly the Slauonian tongue. But no where for the more precise limitation, neither in Asia nor in Europe, is that language spoken more southward, then the north Parallel of 40. degrees: some part of Epirus onely excepted: I meane it is not spoken as the vulgar language of any nation more southward. For else, being acceptable and vsuall, as it is, in the Great Turkes Serrail at Constantinople, and familiar with most of the Turkish souldiers, by reason of their garrisons and other great imployment in those parts toward the confines of Christian Princes, all which parts as

before I said (Hungarie and Walachia excepted) speake that language: for these reasons I say, it is spoken by diuerse particular men, in many places of the Turkish dominion, and the Ianizares and officers for the most part can speake it, and many others also of the better sort, but yet the generall and vulgar language of his dominion (excepting those places afore mentioned) it is not.
            But in Anatolia, although the old languages still remaine, being for the most part corrupt Greeke, as also in Armenia, they haue their peculiar language, yet is the Turkish tongue very frequent and preuaileth in them hoth: which being originally none other then the Tartarian tongue, as Michouius,

                  ica. and others haue obserued, yet partaketh much, both of the Armenian and Persian, by reason of the Turkes long continuance in both those regions, before they setled the seate of their Dominion, and themselues among the Grecians, for which cause it is not without mixture of Greeke also, but chiefely and aboue all other of the Arabique, both by reason of their religion written in that language, and their training vp in schooles vnto it, as their learned tongue. And yet although the Turkish be well vnderstood both in Natolia and Armenia, yet hath it neither extinguished the vulgar languages of those parts neither obtained to it selfe (for ought I can by my reading finde) any peculiar prouince at all, wherein it is become the sole natiue and vulgar language, but is only a common scattered tongue, which appeareth to be so much the more euidently true, because the very Citties that haue beene

successiuely the seates of the Ottaman Sultans; namely Iconium (now Cogna) in Lycaonia, then Prusa in Bithynia; thirdly, Adrianople in Thrace; and lastly, Constantinople, are yet knowne to retaine their old natiue language, the Greeke tongue: Although the Turkish tongue also bee common in them all, as it is likewise in all other Greeke Citties both of Greece and Asia.
            
            But in the East part of Cilicia beyond the riuer Pyramus, as in all Syria also, and Mesopotamia and Palestina, and Arabia and Aegypt, and thence Westward in all that long tract of Afrique, that extendeth from Aegypt to the Strait of Gibralter, I say, in all that lieth betwixt the Mountaine Atlas, and the mediterrane sea (now termed Barbarie) excepting Marocco, and here and there some scattered remnants of the old Africans in the Inland parts, the Aribique tongue is become the vulgar language, although somewhat corrupted and varied in dialect, as among so many seuerall nations it is vnpossible but it should bee. And although I bee farre from Postell. in praefat. Grammat. Arabic. Ludouic. Reg. l. 8. de Vicissitud. Rer. ad finem. their opinion, which write (too ouerlashingly) that the Arabian tongue is in vse in two third partes of the inhabited world, or in more, yet I finde that it extendeth verie farre, and specially where the religion of Mahumed is professed. For which cause (ouer and besides the partes aboue mentioned, in which it is (as I said) become the natiue language) in all the Northerne part of the Turkish Empire also, I meane that part that lieth on the North side of the Mediterrane sea, as likewise among the Mahumetane Tartars, it

is thought not the vulgar tongue, yet familiar with verie many, both because all their religion is written in that language, and for that Bellon. Obseruard. 3. c. 12 euery boy that goeth to schoole, is taught it, as in our schooles they are taught Latin and Greeke: Insomuch, that all the Turkes write their owne language in Arabique characters.

                thought to haue had beginning, in the time of the Captiuitie of the Iewes in Babilon, while they were mingled among the Chaldeans. In which long reuolution of seuenty yeares, the vulgar sort of the Iewes, forgot their owne language, and began to speake the Caldee: But yet, pronouncing it a misse, and framing it somewhat to their owne Country fashion, in notation of poincts, affixes, Coniugarions, and some other properties of their antient speech, it became a mixt language of Hebrew and Chaldee: a great part Chaldee for the substance of the words, but more Hebrew for the fashion, and so degenerating much from both: The old and right Hebrew,
               
remaining after that time, onely among the learned men, and being taught in schooles, as among vs the learned tongues are accustomed to be. And yet, after the time of our Sauiour, this language began much more to alter, and to depart further, both from the Chaldee and Hebrew, as receauing much mixture of Greeke, some also of Romane and Arabique words, as in the Talmud (named of Ierusalem) gathered by R. Iochanan, about 300 yeares after Christ, is apparent being farre fuller of them, then those parts of the Chaldee paraphrase on the holy Scriptures, which were made by R. Ionathan, a little before Christ, and by R. Aquila, whom they call Onkelos, not long after.
            But yet certaine it is, both for the great difference of the words themselues, which are in the Syriaque tongue for the most part Chaldee, and for the diuersitie of those adherents of words, which they call praefixa, and suffixa, as also, for the differing sound of some vowels, and sundrie other considerations: Certaine it is I say, that the vnlearned Iewes, whose vulgar speech the Syriaque then was, could not vnderstād their

                & 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , that their lectures of Moses and the Prophets, vsed in their synagogues in the Hebrew tongue. And that seemeth to haue beene the originall reason, both of the publique speeches and declarations of learned men to the people, vsual in their synagogues on the Sabboaths, after the readings of the Law and of the Prophets, whereof in the Act. 13.15. new Testament we finde some mention, and also, of the translations of Ionathan, and Onkelos, and others, made into

their vulgar language, for that the difference betwixt the Hebrew and the Chaldee was so great, that the tongue of the one nation could not be vnderstood by the other. First, the tongues themselues, which yet remaine with vs, may bee euident demonstrations, of which wee see that one may bee skilfull in the Hebrew, and yet not vnderstand the Chaldee, and therefore neither could they, whose speech the Chaldee then was (although much degenerated) vnderstand the Hebrew. Secondly, wee finde, that whē 
               Nehem. ca 8 v. 7.8.9. 
               Ezra at the returne from the Captiuitie, read the booke of the law before the people, others were faine to interprete that which was read vnto them. And Thirdly, the answer made to Rabshakeh, by the officers of K. Hezekiah, may put it out of question, willing him Reg. l. 2. ca. 18. v. 26. to speake vnto them in the Chaldee tongue, that the common people of Ierusalem (in whose hearing it was) might not vnderstand what was spoken. But yet it might be, that as at this day the Iewes vse to doe, so also in Christs time of conuersing on the Earth, they might also reade the Chaldee Targ

changed, from what in the times afore and about our Sauiours incarnation it had beene) but the Pentateuch also: at least, if that bee true, which Sixtus Senensis hath recorded,Sixt. Senens. Biblioth. Sanct. l. 4. indiction. Syr

But toward the North, Lappia, Scricfinia, Biarmia, Corelia, and the North part of Finmarke (all which together passe commonly vnder the name of Lapland, and make a region about 900 miles in circuit) are inhabited by Idolaters: and toward the East, all the Region betwixt Tanais and Borysthenes, along Maeotis and the Euxine sea (the true natiue Country of the ancient Gothes) being more then twise as large as the former, and withall much better peopled, is inhabited by the Tartars called Crimaei or Precopitae, who are all Mahumetans, excepting onely a small remainder of Christians, in some parts of Taurica.
            
            But, in all the Turks dominion that he hath in Europe, inclosed after a peninsular figure, betweene Danubius and the Sea, and containing in circuit about 2300 miles (for Moldauia, Walachia and Transiluania, I rekon not for parts of his dominiō) namely, from aboue Buda, on Danubius side, and from Ragusa, on the sea side Eastward, to the vtmost bounds of Europe, as also in the Iles of the Aegaean sea, Christians are mingled with Mahumetans. All which dominion yet of the Turks in Europe, though so much in circuit as I said, is neuerthelesse (measured by squares) no greater then Spaine, the continent of it, being no way answearable to the circumference: both, because it runneth far out in sharpe angles, toward the West and South, namely in Hungarie and Moraea, and is beside, in Greece in many places, extraordinarily indented with the sea. And

in this dominion of the Turks in Europe, such is notwithstanding the mixture of Mahumetans with Christians, that the Christians Boter. Relat. pa. 2. l. 4. nel Relation. del gran. Turco.

To which, if I should adde, those few places in Afrique, afore mentioned, near the Strait of Gibraltar, which the KK. of Portugall and Castile, haue conquered from the Mores, with the other few dispersed fortresses, which the Portugalles hold in other places on the coast of Afrique (altogether euen betwixt Spaine and India are but 11 or 12) I know not where to finde, euen among all the natiue Inhabitants of Aphrique, any Christians more. For, as for the large region of Nubia, which had from the Apostles time, (as is

thought) professed the Christian faith, it hath againe aboue 100 yeares since, forsaken it, and embraced in steade of it, partly Mahumetanisme, and partly Idolatrie, and that by the most miserable occasion that might befall, namely famine of the word of God through lacke of Ministers: for as Albarez hath recorded,Aluarez. Hist. Aethiopic. ca. 137. at his being in the K. of Habassia his Court, there were Embassadours out of Nubia, to intreat him for a supply of Ministers, to instruct their nation, and repaire Christianity gone to ruine among them: but were reiected.
            And yet are the Christians of Aegypt, namely those of the natiue Inhabitants, but very few in respect of that infinitenesse of people, wherwith Aegypt doth, and euer did abound, as being esteemed, not to passe Boter.

of Suachem. And toward the south, although the bounds of that kingdom, be not perfectly known, yet that it approacheth nothing neere the circle of Capricorne, as hath bin supposed, is most manifest, because the great kingdomes of Moenhemage, and Benomotapa, and some others, are situate betwixt Habassia and that circle. But, as neere as I am able to coniecture, hauing made the best search that I can, in the itineraries and relations, that are extant of those parts, the south limit of that Empire, passeth not the south parallel of six or seuen degrees at the most, where it confineth with Moenhemage. So that to make a respectiue estimate of the largenesse of that dominion, by comparing it with our knowne regions of Europe, It seemeth equall to Germany and France, and Spaine, and Italie laid together: Equall I say in dimension of ground, but nothing neere equall in habitation or multitude of people, which the distemperature of that climate, and the drye barrennes of the ground, in many regions of it, wil not allow. For which cause the torride parts of Afrique, are by Piso in Strabo resembled to a Libbards skinne,Strab. l. 2. the distance of whose spots, represent the dispersednesse of habitations or townes in Afrique. But if I should absolutely set downe the circuit of that whole dominion, I esteeme the limitation of Pigafetta,

            Such then as I haue declared, is the condition of

Christians in the continent of Afrique: but the Inhabitants of the Isles along the west coast of Africk, as namely Madera; the Canaries, the Isles of Cabo verde, and of S. Thomas, and some other of lesse importance, are by the Portugals and Castilians instruction, become Christian: but on the East side of Afrique, excepting onlyPaul. Venet. l. 3. c. 38.

            Euen such is the state of Christians in the firme land, and the adiacent Isles of Afrique. And it is not much better in Asia, for excepting first the Empire of Russia, (and yet of it, a great part is Idolatrous, namely the region betweene the riuers of Pechora and Ob, and some part of Permia) secondly, the regions of Circassia, and Mengrelia, lying along Moe

Thirdly, the prouince of Georgia, and fourthly the mountaine Libanus in Syria, (and yet the last of these is of the Turkes dominion) excepting these few I say, there is not any region in all Asia, where Christians liue seueral, without mixture, either of Mahumetans, or of Pagās, for although Vitriacus a man well experienced in some parts of the orient,Iacob. a Vitriaco. Histor. Orient. c. 77. (as being Bishop of Acon and the Popes Legate in the East, at what time Palestina and Syria were in the hands of Christians) hath left registred, that the Christians of the Easterlie parts of Asia, exceeded in multitude the Christians of the Greek and Latine Churches: yet in his time (for he writ almost 400. yeares agoe) Christianity began to decline, and since his time, it hath proceeded infinitely to decay, in all those parts of Asia:

first, by the inundation of the idolatrous Tartars, who subdued all those regions, and after by the intertaining of Mahumetanisme in many of them. The time was indeed, (and but about 400. yeares agoe) when the King of Tenduc, whom the histories of those times name Presbyter Iohannes, a Christian, but a Nestorian Prince, ruled farre and wide, in the Northeast part of Asia: as hauing vnder his dominion, beside Tenduc, (which was his owne natiue and peculiar kingdome) all the neighbouring prouinces, which were at that time for a great part, Christian: but after that his Empire was brought to ruine, and he subdued by Chingis a rebell of his owne dominion (and the first founder of the Tartarian Empire) which happened about the yeare 1190. the state of Christian Religion became in short time strangely altered in those parts,Paul Venet. l.

places excepted before mentioned. I can finde no certaine relation, neither in Paul Venetus, nor anie other, of any Christians of the natiue inhabitants, in all the East of Asia, but Idolatrie keepeth still her ould possession, and ouerspreadethall.
            But yet indeede, in the more Southerly partes of Asia (especially in those where Christianity was first planted, and had taken deepest roote) as Natolia, Syria, Palestine, Chaldaea, Assyria, Mesopotamia, Armenia, Media, Persia, the North part of Arabia, and the South of India, Christians are not onely to be found, but in certaine of those regions, as in Natolia, Armenia, Syria, Mesopotamia, somewhat thicke mingled with Mahum

But yet, is not this mixture of Christians with them of other religions, in any part of Asia, after the proportiō of their mixture in Europe (where I obserued the Christians to make the preuailing number) but they are farre inferiour, to the multitude of the Mahumetans, and of the Idolaters, among whom they are mingled, and yet touching their number, decrease euerie day, in all the parts aforesaid, India onely excepted. Where since the Portugales held Goa (which they haue erected into an Archbishopricke) and intertained Malabar, and some other parts of India, what with commerce, and what with amitie, the number of Christians is greatly multiplied, in sundrie places of that region, but yet not so, as to

compare in any sort, with the Mahumetans, and much lesse with the Idolaters among whom they liue.
            Thus it is with Christians in the firme Land of Asia: but in the Islands about Asia, Christianitie is as yet but a tender plant: for although it hath made some entrance into the Isles called Philippinas, namely into 30 of them, for so manie onely of 11000 termed by that name, are subiect to the King of Spaine.

Onely in Iaponia Christianity hath obtained (notwithstanding many hinderances and oppositions) more prosperous successe. Insomuch that many yeares since, there were recorded to haue beene by estimation, about Plat. de Bono Stat Religiosi. l. 2. c. 30. 200000 Christians in Iaponia.
            
            Lastly, in America, there be foure large regions, and those of the most fruitefull and populous part of it, possessed and gouerned by the Spaniards, that is, Nu

In which, as also in the Islands, specially in the greater Islands of Hispaniola, Cuba, Iamaica, and Puerto rico, the Christian

religion is so largely spred, that Amand. Ziriean Chron. circ. An. 1519. one hath presumed, to equall in a manner, the Christians of America, to those of the Latine Church in Europe: And Surius. in Chron. ad. An Christ. 1558. another, hath left recorded, that within a few yeares after the entrance of the Gospell among them, there were no lesse then seuen Millions, or as others reported fourteene Millions, that in the sacrament of baptisme had giuen their names to Christ. But especially in the kingdome of Mexico (or Nueua Espanna) Christian Religion obtained that plentifull and prosperous successe, that we finde recorded of sundrie of the Preachers, employed about the conuersion of that people, that they baptised ech one of them,Vid. epist. Petri Gaudens. in Comment. Sedulij ad vitam. S. Francisci. pa. 229. et Epist. Martin. 2 Valentia. Ibid. pag. 232. et Epist.

But yet, what maner of Christians manie of those proselytes were, I am loth to remember, or report (and it may be by this time, they are better affected and instructed then they were) for certainely, Ouiedo, and Benzo, men that had long liued, and were well experienced in those parts, haue left recorded, the first of Ouied Hiftor.

and profession, they made in their baptisme: Onely, they kept in minde, the name they receaued then, which very name also, they forgot soone after. But all the rest of America except the regions afore mentioned, which compared to the parts possessed by the Castilians and Portugales (to make estimation by the Mappes that wee haue of those regions, for the North and West coasts of America, are not yet perfectly discouered) may be as sixe to one, is possessed by Idolaters.
         
         
            Of the parts of the World possessed by Mahumetans. CHAP. XI.
            
               HAuing declared the amplitude of Christianitie, I will proceede to shew the state of other religions in the world, & with all, what parts of it, the professours of those religions doe seuerally inhabite; and lastly, what proportion they may haue each to other, and all of them to Christians. To indeuour therefore your satisfaction in this behalfe. There are foure sorts or sects of Religion, obserued in the sundrie regions of the World. Namely, Idolatrie, Mahumetanisme, Iudaisme, and Christianity. Of Christians I haue alreadie spoken: now therefore will I relate for your better

contentment, of the other three; and first of Mahumetans.
            
            
               Mahumetans then possesse in Europe, as I said before (hauing in that part but small mixture of Christians) all the region betwixt Tanais and Boristhenes (Don and Nieper they are now called) being about a twentith part of Europe: beside Mathi

                  a Michou. de Sarmat. l. 2. c. 3. some villages in Lituania about Wilna, where the vse of their religion is by the King of Poland permitted them, for in Greece, Macedon, Thrace, Bulgaria, Rascia, Seruia, Bosina, Epirus, the greatest part of Hungaria, and some part of Dalmatia (which may bee together about one foureteenth part of Europe) although the gouernment be wholy the Turkes, yet Mahumetans scarcely passe one third part of the Inhabitants.
            But in Afrique Mahumetanisme is spred exceeding farre, for, first to consider the maritime coast: It possesseth all the shoare of the Atlantique Ocean, from Cape Blanco to the Strait of Gibralter, being about 1100 miles. Secondly, on the shoare of the mediterrane, all from that Strait to Aegypt, about 2400 miles, excepting onely on the one coast, and on the other, some seuen townes, in the possession of the Spaniards. Thirdly, on the East side of Afrique all the coast of the Bay of Arabia, euen from Suez to C. Gardafu., about 1600 miles, excepting onely one port (Ercoco) being of the dominion of the King of Habassia. And thence (doubling that Cape) Southward, all the shore of the Aethiopique sea, as farre as Mozambique (that is ouer against the middest of Madagascar) about 1800 miles. And in all the coasts of Afrique hitherto mentioned, being

altogether about 7000 miles (that is, by some excesse more then halfe the circumference of Afrique) the professors of Mahumeds religion, haue both possession and dominion, together with the Paul. Venet. l. 3. c. 39. Linschot. l. 
                     •
                  . c. 3. maritime parts, of the great Isle of Madagascar, and many other Islands along the coast of Afrique. And yet, euen beyond Mozambique also, as farre as to the Cape das Corrientes (it is vnder the circle of Capricorne) although they haue there no rule, yet they are found mingled with Idolaters. But yet neuerthelesse, obserued it is, that along the East shoare of Afrique, namely from Suachem to Mozambique (being towards 3000 miles of the mentioned coast) Mahumetans possesse onely the Margent of the land, or the sea shoare, and haue gotten but little footing in the inland parts, except in the kingdomes of Dangali and Adel, confining together, the first within and the second without the straite of Babel Mandel, which yet are but small prouinces. And this also (to extenuate their number) is also true, that from the kingdome of Adel, and Cape Guardafu, to Mozambique, there is found among the Mahumetans, some mixture of Idolaters, although the dominion bee onely in the Mahumetans hands.
            But yet on the North and West parts of Afrique, it is farre otherwise, and farre worse: Mahumetanisme hauing ouerspread all the maine land of Afrique, betweene the Mediterraine sea and the great riuer Neger: and along the course of Nilus, as farre as the Isle of Meroe, which lieth also about the same parallel with the riuer Niger, and is possessed by Mahumetans. And yet,

So that all Barbarie and Biled elgerid, and Libya deserta, and the region of Negroes, are become of that religion. Excepting first some maritime parts toward the Atlantique sea, namely from C. Blanco southward, which are inhabited by Gentils. Secondly, the kingdome of Borno, and some part of Nubia: And thirdly, certaine scattered multitudes of the old African progenie, that still retaine their ancient gentilisme, and are found in diuers places heere and there in the mountaines & wilder parts of Barbary, of Biled-elgerid, and of Libya. These I say, beeing excepted, all Afrique beside, frō the mediterrane sea, som what more southward then the riuer Niger, is ouerspread with Mahumetans: which (adding these before mentioned, along the east coast of Aethiopia) may by estimation, take vp foure nine parts of Afrique.
            And yet in Asia, Mahumetanism is farther spred, beeing imbraced and maintained chiefly, by foure mighty nations, namely, the Arabians, Persians, Turkes, and Tartars. Arabia was indeed the nest, that bred and fostered that vncleane bird, and had it bene the cage also, for euer to enclose it, it had bin but too much space and liberty, for Arabia is in circuit aboue 4000. miles, and except a small mixture of Christians in Eltor, a port towne toward the inmost angle of the bay of Arabia, and Petra, (Krac now it is called) a midland towne, and two Monasteries about the Hill of Sinai, all is possessed with Mahumetans. But from Arabia that poison

hath in such sort dispersed it selfe through the veynes of Asia, that neere the one halfe, is at this day corrupted by it. For although it hath not hetherto attained to the north coast of Asia, which is partly inhabited by Christians, namely, from the riuer of Dwyna to Pechora, and partly by idolaters from Pechora to the East Ocean: nor yet to the east coast, which from the most northerly part of Tartary, to the most southerly part of India, Boter.

               ke sort generally obtaine: yet neuerthelesse, it is as I saide, namely, that a very great part of Asia, is infected with that pestilence. For first, all the southerly coast of Asia, from the Bay of Arabia to the riuer Indus, is possessed by Mahumetans: and if wee proceed further along that shore, euen beyond the riuer of Indus also, the great kingdomes of Cambaia, and Bengala, for a great part of them, and about one fourth part of the inhabitants of Malabar, are obserued to be Mahumetans. And secondly, to consider the inland parts: all from the westerly bounds of Asia, namely the riuer Tanais, with the Euxine, Aegaean, and Mediterane seas, as farre Eastward, as the mountaine Imaus, (which is more then halfe the length of Asia) is possessed by them: Except, first the Guaguin.

               Kirgessi neere Imaus, who are Idolaters: and secondly, the mixture of Christians among them, who yet haue very small proportion (for their multitude) to Mahumetans, in any prouince, of all the mentioned vast circuit, for howsoeuer Burchardus about 320. yeares agoe, hath left

recorded of those parts of Asia, that there were to be found in them 30. Christians for one Mahumetan. Descr. ter. sanct. pa. 2. c. 2. §. 9. yet certainely, that in these present times the excesse of multitude is growne great on the Mahumetans side in respect of Christians, the experience of many putteth out of question. And, if wee shall proceed yet farther eastward, in the inland parts of Asia, and passe in our speculation, beyond the mountaine Imaus, euen there also sundry prouinces are obserued, as Paul. Venet. l. 1. c. 41.42.43. 
               Peim, Cotam, Lop, where Mahumetans are the maine and sole inhabitants, and many more, as Id. l. 1. ca. 38.40.47.62.63.64. &c. 
               Cassar, Carcham, Chinchintilus, Tanguth, Ergimul, Cerguth, Tenduc, &c. where they are mingled among idolaters, which may for a great part, counteruaile those regions of Asia, which Christians and Idolaters take vp on this side that mountaine. So that, in my estimation, hauing about these points cōferred history with Geography in the most circumspect & considerate manner that I was able, about nine parts of 20. of Asia, are possessed by Mahumetans.
            Thus then is Mahumetanisme spread ouer the one halfe almost of the firme land of Asia. And yet moreouer in the Ilands also that are about Asia, that religion hath found large intertainment. For not onely a good part of the small Nicol. de cō

            Of the great spreading & inlargement of which religion, if the causes were demanded of mee, I should make answere, that beside the iustice of almighty God, punishing by that violent and wicked sect, the sinnes of Christians (for we see that by the conquests of the Arabians, and Turks, it hath cheefly seased on those regions, where Christianity in ancient time most flourished, both in Afrique and Asia, and partly in Europe) one cause J say, of the large spreading of their Religion, is the large spreading of their victories. For it hath euer beene the condition of the conquered, to follow for the most part the religion of the conquerors. A secōd, their peremptory restraint, (euen on the paine of death) of all disputation touching their religion, and calling any point of it into question. A third, their suppression of the studie of Philosophy, by the light whereof, the grosnesse and vanity of many parts of their religion might bee discouered, which is inhibited to bee taught in their vniuersities, and so hath beene, about these 400. yeares, whereas till then, it greatly flourished among thē, in Cordoua, in Fess, in Maroccho, in Bagded, and other cities. And yet, as Bellonius and Bellon. Obser. l. 3. c. 30. Georgeuitz. l. 2. de Ritib. Turcar. cap. de Scholis. others write, the Turkes fall now againe, to those studies afresh. A fourth cause may well bee assigned, the sensuall liberty allowed by it, namely, to haue many wiues, and the like promise of sensual pleasures, to succeed after this life (to the Religious obseruers of it,) in

Paradise, wherewith men for the greatest part, as being of things wherewith their sense is affected, & whereof they haue had certaine experience, are more allured and perswaded, then with promises of spiritual delights, presented only to their hopes, and for which present and sensible pleasures must in the meane time be forsaken.
         
         
            Of the sundrie regions of the world inhabited by Idolaters. CHAP. XII.
            
               NOW touching Idolaters, they possesse in Europe, a region as I before obserued, about 900. miles in circuit, (although the ordinary Geographical charts represent it, (but falslie) more then twise so large) containing Lappia, Corelia, Biarmia, Scricfinia, and the north part of Finmarch. All which together, may by estimation make about one sixtieth part of Europe, or a little more, more I meane in magnitude rather then in multitude, for it is indeed a little greater then so. Beside which prouinces, there are also to bee found in diuers places of Beem. de Morib. gent. l. 3. c. 7. Boter. Relat. p.

            But in Afrique their multitude is very great, for from C. Blanco on the coast of Libya, the most westerly

point of all Afrique (being about the north latitude of twenty degrees) euen al the coast of Afrique southward, to the cape of Buena Esperanza: And thence turning by the backe of Afrique as farre as the cape of Mozambique, beeing (ouer against the middest of Madagascar) in the south latitude of fifteene degrees: all this coast I say, beeing not much lesse, then halfe the circumference of Afrique, is inhabited by Idolaters. Onely, on the East side, from Mozambique to Cape de Corrientes (which is the south latitude of 24 degrees) they are mingled with Mahumetans: And on the west side, in the kingdome of Congo, and the north part of Angola, with Christians: But yet in both these places of their mixture, idolaters are the greater multitude.
            But now, if wee consider the inland Region of Afrique, all betweene the riuer Nilus, and the West sea of Aethiopia, from about the north parallel of tenne degrees, to the south parallel of 6. or 7. degrees, but from that parallel of 6. or 7. degrees, euen all Aethiopia southward, on both the sides of Nilus, from the east sea of Aethiopia, to the West, euen to the most southerly point of all Afrique, the cape of Buona Speranza, is possessed by idolaters: excepting onely some part of Congo and Angola afore mentioned, toward the west sea, inhabited by Christians, and the vtmost shore of the East sea, frō 
               Mozambique northward, which is replenished with Mahumetans: And yet, beside all the regions before mentioned, euen all the kingdome of Leo African. l. 7. ca. de Borno Regno.

                   Afror. ancient Africans, dispersed in sundry tracts of Barbary, of Biled-elgerid, and of Libya Deserta, which still continue in their ancient paganisme. So that (ouer and beside these last) very neere abouth halfe Afrique, is possessed by idolaters.
            And yet in Asia idolaters abound more then in Afrique, euen as Asia is larger then Afrique for the continent, and for the people, beter inhabited, for of Asia also, very neere about the one halfe, or rather a little more is possessed by idolaters. For first if wee consider the maritime parts, all from the riuer of Pechora, Eastward to the Ocean, and then turning downeward, to the most southerly point of India, (and of all Asia) the cape of Cincapura, and from that point returning westward, by the south coast, to the outlets of the riuer Indus, al that maritime tract I say, is entirely possessed by idolaters. Sauing onely, that in the neerer part of India, betweene Indus and Ganges, there is among them some mixture both of Mahumetans and Christians: and in the further part, the city and territory of Malacca, is held by Portugalls, and some part of the sea coast of the kingdome of Siam, by Moores. So that by this account, a good deale more then halfe the circumference of Asia, is possessed by Idolaters. And, although in the inland parts their proportion bee somewhat lesse, then in the Maritime, yet if we consider well, the whole dimension of Asia, we shall find by good estimation, as before I said, that the one halfe, or rather a little more, is replenished with Idolaters: for the better declaring

of which point, you may vnderstand, that as Strabo and Ptolomie, haue obserued, of the mountaine Taurus,Strab. l. 2. Ptolē in Tab.

               Imaus that beginning on the shoare of the north Ocean, it runneth along through the middest of Asia to the south, keeping still about the same meridian, namely about the longitude of 30. degrees, and crossing (at right angles in a manner) the mountaine Taurus deuideth the east part of Asia from the west. Imaus therfore in this sort diuiding Asia into two parts, not much vnequall, diuideth also in a manner, between the idolaters & Mahumetans of Asia, for although the hether part of Asia, west of Imaus, and possessed of Mahumetans, take vp more in the longitude of the earth, namely east and west: yet the further part east of Imaus, spreadeth more in latitude, north and south, which may make some recompence toward that excesse. But, if withall we subtract those parts of the hether Asia, that are couered with the Persian, and Caspian seas, beside large parts of the Euxine & Mediterrane, the further Asia (I thinke) will fully equall it. Now, although many Mahumetans bee also found on the other side of Imaus toward the northeast of Asia, both seuerall in sundry prouinces, and otherwise mingled with idolaters or Christians, or with both, as before was partly

obserued: Yet many more whole regions of Idolaters, (to counteruaile those Mahumetans) are found on this side Imaus, both, toward the South, in the Kingdomes of the nearer India, and toward the North, betwixt Imaus and the riuer Pechora, all which coast of Asia is inhabited by Idolaters, And lastly, in the middest betwixt both, the Kirgessi, and some other of their neighbour Nations. And not onely in the firme land of Asia, is idolatry thus spred: but in those many thousand Ilands that lie dispersed in the vast Ocean, on the East and Southeast parts of Asia: 
               Paul. Ven. l. 3. c 8. Id, l. 3. cap. 42. which ouer against China, are recorded vpon the report of Mariners, long practised in those seas, to be 7448, and, about Paul. Ven. l. 3. c 8. Id, l. 3. cap. 42. 
               India, to be 127000: And which might for their largenesse, if they were all layed together, make a Continent as large as three foure parts of Europe. In those Islands I say, Idolatrie ouerspreaddeth all, excepting onely those few, which I before obserued, to be possessed by the Spanyards, and by the Arabians.
            
            Finally, of all other parts of the Earth yet discouered, Idolatry spreadeth farthest in America, which being but little lesse, then the Easterne continent, (that we terme the old world) is at least six parts of seuen, inhabited with heathenish and idolatrous people. For, except the regions aboue mentioned, possessed namely by the Portugalles and Castilians, (and yet the inner, and wilder tracts euen of those, remaine still for a great part, in their ancient paganisme) and many notwithstanding their baptisme,Th

the Bay of California, of whō as yet, histories make so little report, that of their number I can make no estimate: And lastly 2, or 3 fortresses, held by the Spanyards, on the coast of Florida, with the English colonies in Virginia, and the French in Canada, these I say being excepted, all the rest of America, being as I sayd about six seuenth parts remaineth in their olde Idolatry.
            And thus haue I declared the three principall sects as touching Religion, that are at this present found in the seuerall parts of the world, with their particular regions. But beside these, obserued there are, two or three irregular Nations, being, for their religion mingled as it were, of some of the former sects. As first, in Asia, the Cardi, inhabiting in the Mountainous Country aboue Mozal, betweene Armenia, and Mesopotamia. Secondly the Drusi, dwelling in Syria, about the skirts of Libanus, the religion of both which Nations, (such as it is) partaketh somewhat, both of Mahumetanisme and Christianitie. And thirdly, the Morduites in Europe, possessing the middle confines betwixt the Precopite Tartars, and the Muscouites, that are in a manner as touching their religion, mingled of all three sects: for they are both baptised like Christians, and circumcised like Mahumetans, and withall worship Idols.
         
         
            
            Of the Iewes dispersed in seuerall parts of the World. CHAP. XIII.
            
               NOw, will I intreat a little, of the Professours of the fourth sort and sect of religion, that is founde in the world, namely of Iudaisme, for, although the Iewes haue not for their mansion, any peculiar Country, but are dispersed abroad among forrayne Nations, for their ancient Idolatries, and their later vnthankfulnesse, in reiecting their Sauiour the sonne of God: So that euen in Ierusalem, there be not to bee found at this time, an hundred housholds of Iewes:

            The first Country of Christendome, whence the Iewes were expelled, with out hope of returne, was our Country of England, whence they were banished, Anno 1290 by King Edward the first. Not long after they were likewise banished France An. 1307. by Philippus Pulcher: Onely of all the

Countryes of France, in the Iurisdiction of Auignon (the Popes state) some are remaining. Out of Spaine, An. 1492, by Ferdinand, and shortly after out of Portugall, An, 1497 by Emanuel. Out of the Kingdome of Naples and Sicilie, An. 1539. by Charles the 5. In other regions of Europe they are found, and in some of them in great numbers, as in Germanie, Bohem, Polonia, Lituania, Russia, and part of Italie, specially Venice and Rome. In Greece also a great multitude, wherein two Citties (beside all them of other places) Constantinople and Thessalonica are esteemed to be about 160000 Iewes. As also they are to be found by plentifull numbers, in many parts of the Turks dominion, both in Asia, and Afrique. And for Asia, specially in Aleppo, in Tripoli, in Damascus, in Rhodes, and almost in euery City of great trade and traffique in the Turk

                  sh Empire: As likewise in diuers parts of the Persian gouernment, in Arabia also, & lastly in India, (namely about Cranganor) and in some other more remote regions. And, to come to Afrique, they are not only foundin the Cities of Alexandria, and Cair in Aegypt, but, as in many other regions & places of Afrique, so principally, in the Cities of Fess, and Tremisen: and specially, in the Hilles of Sensaua, and Demen in the Kingdome of Maroccho many of which last, are by Leo Africanus, specially noted to be of that Sect,
               Leo African. l. 2. c. 36. &c. which the Iewes name For of the Iewes, as touching their religion, there bee in these times three fects. The first which is the greatest of them, is named

                   who beside the holy scriptures, imbrace the Talmud also for Authenticall, and for that cause, they are also termed 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . The second are called 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   which receiue onely the scriptures. And the Third 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   that is, the Samaritans (at this day but very few) which, of all the holy Scriptures, admit onely the Pentateuch or bookes of Moses.
                
               Karraim, and by the other Iewes of Afrique, are reputed no better

then heretiques.
            But yet, beside these, and such like dispersions of the Iewish Nation, that may be elsewhere in the world, there is a phantasie of many learned men, not vnwoorthy some diligent consideration, that the Tartars of Scythia, who about the yeare 1200, or a little before, became first knowen abroad in the world by that name, and hold at this day a great part of Asia, in subiection; That those Tartars I say, are of the

               Israelites progeny: Namely of the ten Tribes, which by Salmanazar, and some of his predecessours, were carried captiue into Assyria. Which although it be as I said no other then a vain and cappriccious phantasie, yet, hath it, not onely found acceptance and entertainement, with sundrie learned and vnderstanding men: but reason and authority are produced, or pretended to establish it for a truth. For first, It is alleaged that the word Tatari, or Totari, (for so indeed they are rightly called, as 
                  Leunclau. in Pandect. Hist. Turcic.

                learned men obserue, and not Tartari) signifieth in the Syriaque and Hebrew tongues, a Residue or Remainder such as these Tartars are supposed to bee of the Ten Tribes. Secondly, because, (as the Patrons of

this phantasie say) they haue alwaies embraced (the ancient character of Iudaisme) Circumcision. And thirdly,2 Esdras 13. v. 41.42.43.44.45. the authority of supposed Esdras, (the very spring I take it, whence hath flowed this streame of opinion) is alleaged. Namely, that the Tenne Tribes tooke this course to themselues, that they would leaue the multitude of the heathen, and goe foorth into a farther Country, where neuer mankinde dwelt. That they might there keepe their statutes, which they neuer kept in their owne land. And that they entred in at the narrow passages of the Riuer Euphrates. The most high shewing them signes, and staying the Springs of the floud, till they were passed ouer. And, that their Iourney was great, euen of a yeare and a halfe, and the region is called Arsareth.
            
            But, to the first of these arguments, I may answere, that the Tartars obtained that name, neither from Hebrew nor Syriaque originall, and appellation, but, from the riuer Tartar, saith Leunclauius,
               Leunclau. in Pand. histor. Turcic. §. 3. and Boem. de Morib gent. l. 2. c. 10. Haitti. lib. de Tartaris. cap. 16. others. Or else from the Region, as sayth Haitho, where the principall of them anciently dwelled. Secondly, that the name 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                or 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                in the Hebrew, or Syriaque signification, importing a residue or remainder, can but full ill (as it seemes) be applied to the Tartars in relation of the Israelites, whom they exceedingly surpasse in multitude, as ouerspreading halfe the vast continent of Asia, or thereabout. For all the Nations of Asia, from the great riuers of Wolgha and Oby, Eastward, and from the Caspian sea, the riuer Oxus, the Countryes of India and China, northward, are contained vnder the Appellation of Tartars: and yet without these

bounds many Tartars there are, both toward the West, and South. And what if the innumerable people of so many Nations, as are knowen to inhabite and ouerspread the huge continent of America, be also of the same of-spring? Certainely, if I bee not greatly deceiued, they are no other. For first that their originall must bee deriued from Asia is apparent, because, (as he that readeth the relations and histories of those Countryes of America may easily obserue) they haue no rellish nor resemblance at all, of the Arts, or learning, or ciuility of Europe: And their colour restifieth, they are not of the Africans progenie (there being not found in all that large Continent, any blacke men, except a few about the Riuer of S. Martha, in a small Countrey called Quarequa, which by force and violence of some tempest, are supposed to haue beene transported thether, from the parts of Guinie or Aethiopia.) Therfore it seemeth, that they had their originall from Asia. Which yet, will appeare more credible, if it be obserued, which by the Spanyards discoueries is well knowen to be true, namely, that the West side of America respecting Asia, is exceeding much better peopled then the opposite or East side, that respecteth toward Europe. And, as for these reasons it is very likely, that America receiued her first inhabitants, from the East border of Asia: So is it altogether vnlike, that is receiued them from any other part of all that border, saue from Tartarie. Because, in America there is not to be discerned, any token or indication at all, of the arts or industry of China, or India, or Cataia, or any

other ciuill region, along all that border of Asia: But in their grosse ignorance of letters, and of arts, in their Idolatrie, and the specialties of it, in their inciuilitie, and many barbarous properties, they resemble the olde and rude Tartars, aboue all the nations of the Earth. Which opinion of mine, touching the Americans descending from the Tartars, rather then from any other nation in that border of Asia, after the neere vicinitie of Asia to America, this reason aboue all other, may best establish and perswade: Because it is certaine, that that Northeast part of Asia possessed by the Tartars, is if not continent with the West side of America, which yet remaineth somewhat doubtfull: yet certainely, and without all doubt, it is the least disioyned by sea, of all that coast of Asia, for that those parts of Asia and America, are continent one with the other, or at most, disioyned but by some narrow channell of the Ocean, the rauenous and harmefull beasts, wherewith America is stored, as Beares, Lions, Tigers, Wolues, Foxes, &c. (which men as is likely, would neuer to their owne harme transporte out of the one continent to the other) may import. For from Noahs Arke, which rested after the deluge, in Asia, all those beasts must of necessitie fetch their beginning, seeing they could not proceede by the course of nature, as the vnperfect sort of liuing creatures doe, of Putrefaction: or if they might haue Putrefaction for their parentage, or receaue their originall (by any other new sort of generation) of the earth without special procreation of their owne kinde, then I see no nececessitie,

why they should by Gods speciall appointment, be so carefully preserued in Noahs Arke (as they were) in time of the deluge. Wherefore, seeing it is certaine, that those rauenous beasts of America, are the progenie of those of the same kinde in Asia, and that men, as is likely, conueighed them not (to their owne preiudice) from the one continent to the other, it carrieth a great likelihood and appearance of truth, that if they ioine not together, yet are they neer neighbours, & but little disioyned each from other, for euen to this day, in the Isles of Cuba, Iamaica, Hispaniola, Burichena, and all the rest, which are so farre remoued from the firme land, that these beasts cannot swimme from it to them, the Spanyards record,Ioseph Acosta De N

                  tur. Nou Orb. l. 1. c. 21. that none of these are found. Wherefore it seemeth (to digresse no farther) that the natiō of the Tartarians, spreading so exceeding farre, as it doth, cannot certainely be the posteritie of those captiue Israelites.
            
            Neither (to answer the second obiection) doth their circumcision in any sort inforce it: for, neither was circumcision, among the Tartars ancienter then Mahumetanisme, but was receaued among them together with it, as Michouius hath remembred,Michou. de Sa

Neither if it should be graunted,

that circumcision had beene auncienter among them then Mahumetanisme, were that an argument of anie importance, to prooue them to bee of the Israelites progenie. Because it is certainely knowen, tha

Touching some of which, although it may be probablie coniectured, that they receaued it (in som sort) from the Israelites: if not as their progenie (which yet in some sense may be said of the inhabitants of the desert, being the posteritie of Ismael the son of Abraham: and likewise of the Edomites, being the seed of Esau the sonne of Isaac) yet at least, by imitation of Abrahams familie, to whom also in blood they were allied, as the Ammonites & Moabites, the posteritie of Lot, Abrahams brothers son, and who had liued long in his familiarity and family. Although I say of these nations it may bee coniectured, that their ceremonie of circumcision was taken vp, by imitation of the

               Israelites: yet that the same rite, or custome was also deriued originally, from them to the whole nation of the Arabians (which was exceeding great) or to the Aegyptians, or other neighbouring prouinces, I know not why anie should conceaue, or if they doe, yet appeareth it to bee otherwise, because they circumcised not in the eight day, which is the inuiolable custome of the Israelites:Ambros. l. 2. de Abraham. Patriarcha. c. 12. but the Aegyptians in the foureteenth yeare, as is recorded by Ambrose, & the Arabians in the thirteenth (and some of them both sexes, as Sard. de Riti. gent. l. 1. c. 10. learned men haue recorded.

               Turkes also at this day, who receaued the rite of circumcision from the Arabians, are knowne to circumcise in the eight or twelfth, or fifteenth yeare or sooner, or later, as opportunitie may serue. Of these nations I say, how circumcision should proceede from the Israelites to them, I cannot conceaue: no more then I can of the great nation of the

            And although these instances, vtterly dissolue the force of this reason, touching the Tartarians circumcision (though it were admitted to haue beene anciently in vse among them, as being vsuall

with many other nations, of whom no suspition at all can be conceaued, to be of the Israelites progenie) yet this may furthermore declare them, not to be of that race, because namely, nothing else was to be found among them, that might sauour of Israel. For First, they were meere Idolaters, and without knowledge of the true God, as is recorded by Marcus Paulus,

Fourthly, they haue no records, nor regard of their auncestors and linage, from whom, or by whom, they are descended, whereof Israelites were euer curious. Fifthly, they haue no affinitie of language at all, with either the Hebrew or Chaldee tongues, neither had any vse of those letters, nor of any other, till together with Mahumetan religion, the Arabique characters came in vse among some of them. Neither (in a word) doe I finde any thing at all, wherein the Tartarians sauored of Israelites, for touching their abstinence from swines flesh, which we finde recorded of them, neither is it generall among them, but peculiar to those that are Mahumetans: Nor if it were so, were that any good argument, because wee know that the auncient

               Aegyptians, and Arabians did, and almost all Mahumetans at this day doe the same, which yet are well knowne to be in no sort descended of the Israelites.
            Now touching the authority of forged Esdr. 2.13. 
               Esdras, which hath stirred vp as it seemeth this vapourous fantasie, in the braines of new fangled antiquaries: neither doth that which hee writeth of the ten tribes, agree at all with the Tartars: nor, if it did, could yet the circumstances of that history agree with the truth. It agreeth not with the Tartars I say, for whereas they are noted in that reuelation, to bee Vers. 39. a peaceable people, and that they 
               Vers. 41. 
               left the multitude of the heathen, that they might keepe their statutes, which they neuer kept in their owne land: neither of both those properties, hath any conuenience or agreement at all with the Tartarians. For how are they a peaceable people, that with their wars haue troubled and ouerturned almost all Asia, and sundry countries of Europe, and hold a great part of the former in subiection to this day? Or how kept they the statutes of the Israelites, that were meere idolaters, and vtterly ignorant of all Iewish lawes and ceremonies? And touching the history it selfe of the Israelites departure out of Assyria, as it is set downe in that Apocryphall Esdras (howsoeuer it might otherwise agree with the Tartars) there is no wise or considerate man, I think, that can bring his vnderstanding to giue credit to it. For first it contradicteth the vndoubted canonicall histories of the Chronicles,1. Chro. 5.26. 2. Kin. 17.23. and of the Kings, in both which

it is recorded of them, that they were carried away into Ashur, & disposed in seuerall parts of the Empire, namely If 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                  Gauzania in Media, then all confined together, and bounded the north side of the Assyrian Empire, which stretched northward, but to that Isthme betweene the Euxine & the Caspian seas: So that, the Israelites were by that meanes, seated farthest off from their owne countrey, and placed in the parts of the Empire most wast and desolate of inhabitāts, as the confines of warring nations vsually are. But if Calach be Calacine, and Chabor the hil Chaboras, (being part of Taurus, and seuering Assyria, from Armenia, and Media) and Hara the other hilly parts in the north side of Assyria, as seemeth more agreeable to the obseruations of Beniamin Tudelensis, for about those parts, he found in his trauail, the greatest multitudes of the Israelites, then in the places aleaged, I would vnderstand by Ashur, not the Empire or dominion, but the peculiar kingdome of Assyria. 
               Calach, and Chabor, and Hara, and Gozan, vnto this day, which limitation of time (vnto this day) must at least of necessitie import, the time wherein that history (of their remaining in Ashur) recorded in the books of the Kings, & of the Chronicles was writtē. Of which later, either Esdras himselfe was the Author, as in the iudgmēt R. Dau. Kimchi & R. Shelomo ex sententia seniorū apud Sixt. Senens. Biblioth. Sanctae lib. 1. of learned men he is reputed, & therfore could not

(as it seemeth) be the Author of that apocryphall history:Abulens. in praef. Paralipō. in Quaestiō. 5. or, at least, if Esdras were not the Author, yet, that the Author (whosoeuer he was) liued and writ that history of the Chronicles, after the return of the Iewes from the captiuity, or in the end of it, (that is in Esdras time,) is euident by the end of the booke: where Cyrus his benignity, for restoring of the Iewes, & his proclamation for their returne to Ierusalem is recorded, and that in the very same words, wherein Esdras in the beginning of his own booke hath registred them. At that time therfore, it is euident, that the Israelites were not departed out of the dominions of Ashur. No nor long after that in Iosephus his time:Ioseph. Antiq. l. 11. c. who hath recorded that euen then the tenne Tribes remained beyond Euphrates, and were there growne into innumerable multitudes: neither yet many hundred yeares after Iosephus was dead: for R. Beniamin a Iew, that liued but about 440. yeares agoe, and trauailed diligently those parts of the world, and many other to visite his dispersed countrimen, hath in his Itinerary left obserued, not only, that he found exceeding far greater multitudes of the Israelites,Beniamin in Itiner. pag. 57.58.59.70.71.74 75.76.77.78.80.81.86. to be then remaining in those prouinces of the ancient dominion of Ashur, then he found in other places, possessing Pag. 75. & 87 large regions, and Pag. 76. &c. many cities, so that in the cities of some one Region Pag cad. 300000. Iewes were by him numbred, obseruing specially, that in the parts of Media, many thousand Israelites of the progeny of them that Salmanaser ledde into

captiuity, were then remaining, but withall, he setteth downe particularly and precisely, the very places of those regions, where certaine of the Tribes were seated, & there grown into great multitudes: As namely, in Pag. 77. one place, the Tribes of Ruben, Gad, and Manasse: And in Pag. 87. an other, the 4. Tribes of Dan, Asher, Zebulon, and Naphtali.
            
            But yet if there were neither authority of holy Scripture, nor experience to refell this fable, & the fancies that haue sprung of it: yet ordinary reason, at least of men that are not ignorant of Geography and are meanly skilled in the affaires of the world, may easily discerne the futility of it. For first, what neede was there of such a miracle,2. Esdr. 13. as to And the most high thē shewed them signes, & stayed the springs of the floud (Euphrates) till they were pas

                  ecs. 44. stay the course of Euphrates, for the Israelites passage from Assyria, or Media toward Tartary, the riuer lying far to the west, both of the one region and of the other, & no way crossing or impeaching their iourney, which lay northward betweene that riuer and the Caspian Sea? Or, how might those poore captiue Israelites, disarmed as they were, and dispersed in sundry Prouinces of the Assyrian Empire, and being vnder the ouersight and gouernment of Assyrian presidents, be able to leaue the places, where by the Kings commandement they were to inhabite? Or,They tooke this counsel to themselues that they would leaue the multitude of the Heathen. v. 41. if the Israelites were able by force to depart, and free themselues from the dominion of the king of Ashur, yet were they so wise also, as to forsake the places where they were peaceably setled, and venture their small remainders vpon perils and vncertainties, namely, to finde out a place where neuer mankind dwelt? Or, if their stomacke

serued them so well, and their wit so ill, as in such manner to forsake Assyria,And goe forth into a country where neuer mankind dwelt. v. 41. yet were they also able to make themselues way (euen a way as hee saith, of 18. moneths passage) through the fierce and mighty nations of Scythia, whom neither the conquerours of the Israelites, the Assyrians I meane, nor the Persians (and I might adde also the Grecians and the Romans) were neuer able to subdue, but were in the after times subdued by them? for that the parts of Scythia should bee without Inhabitants (& in Scythia it must bee where they would find that country where neuer mankind dwelt, or else it is not in Tartary) is scarse credible, as wherof we read in histories,Iustin. hist. l. 2. in princip. to haue cōtended with Aegypt for antiquity of habitation, & to haue preuailed, and for the aboundance of people, to bee termed Hominum Officina. Insomuch that the greatest occasion of swarming abroad of those nations of Scythia, and of their ouerwhelming of Asia & Europe, with their infinite multitudes and colonies, is in histories recorded, to be lacke of room for habitation in their owne countries.
            And lastly, to make an end of this tedious discourse, with the ende of their imagined tedious iourney: what ancient Geographer or Historian is there, (set our Esdras aside) that euer remembred of such a Region as Arsareth, where they are saide to haue seated themselues. True it is indeed that I find the city of Arsaratha,
               Beros. lib. 3. Ptolem. Geog. l. 5. c. 13. et in Tab. 3. Asiae. mentioned both in Berosus fragments, and in Ptolomie placed neer the issue of the riuer Araxes into the Caspian sea: and, it was perhaps one of the Israelitish colonies, planted in

the confines of the empire of Assyria: for it may well bee that Arsaratha, is but 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , or 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , that is the City, or the hill of the remainder: or perhaps 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                (the last letter of the first word cut of in the Greeke pronunciation for sounds sake) the Land of the remainder: but the tale of eighteene months iourney, wil no more agree with this citie, then the region of Arsareth doth, with Geography or Historie.
            So that me thinks this forged story of the Israelites voyage and habitation, in such remote regions where neuer mankind dwelt, sauoureth of the same phantastical and Talmudical spirit, that Esd. 6.42. an other tale of the same author doth, touching the collection of all the waters, into a seuenth part of the earth, the other sixe beeing left vncouered: or Cap. eod. vers. 50. a third, of (the Elephant and the Whale) Behemoth and Leuiathan: namely, that God appointed the sea to one of them, and the land to the other, because they were so great that the Sea could not hold them both: for else belike, if the Sea had bene large enough, we might haue gone a fishing for Elephants. For how is the sea gathered into a seauenth part of the earth, whose expansion is not only by the most skilfull Philosophers esteemed, but found by experiēce of nauigations hitherto made, to ouerspred as neerly as may be discerned, about halfe the compasse of the Earth? Or, being of that bredth, and withall of the depth, that it is knowne to be how should it not bee spatious enough, to receiue Elephants and Whales together? The dimensions of the Elephant, euen of the greatest sort

of Indian Elephants, (and the earth breedeth none so large as those of India) are,Aelian de Animalib. l. 12. c. 8. saith Aelianus, nine cubits of heigth (the length in that beast is equall to the height) and fiue of bredth, the greatest that haue bene seene in Europe, being Vid. Gilliū in Descript: 6, Elephant, c. 6. et Gorop l. 2. Origin. Antuerptan. obserued to be far lesse. The dimension of the Whale indeed is far greater (fiue times saith Aelian. l. 16. ca. 12. Rondelet. de Piscib. l. 16. c. 11. Arriā. de Reb. Indicis longe ante finem. 
               Aelianus then the largest sort of Elephants) But yet his ordinary dimensiō is, but 36. cubits long, and 8. cubits high, as Rondeletius hath obserued. But admit notwithstanding some of them to bee 50. cubits, of which length, Nearchus in Arrianus is saide to haue measured one in the East Ocean: nay, to be 600. foot long, and 360. foote thicke, as Ap. Plin. l. 32. c. 1. 
               Iuba in Plinie related to bee found in the Bay of Arabia, (where yet, as it is well knowne by the foundings of nauigators, that sea is not by a good deale 360. foote deepe) Or, let them be more yet,Plin. l 9. c. 3. euen foure Acres long, (that is 960. foote) as Plinie hath related of some in the sea of India. For, although the two last reports bee in truth no better then fancies and fables,Basil. in Hexaemer. Homil. 7 which the impudence of some, hath made the ignorance of others, to beleeue, yet I will exclude none, but onely Basil, as intolerably hyperbolical, affirming namely that whales are equal to the greatest mountaines, & their backs whē they shew aboue the water, like to Islands. But admitting all the rest I say, what proportion haue those dimensions of the Whale & the Elephant, to the huge bredth & depth of the Oceā?
            For if I may without offence intersert a short Philosophicall speculaton: the depth of the Sea (to speake nothing of the bredth, which euery common

mappe doth represent) is determined by Fabianus in Plinie,
               Fabian. apud Plin. l. 2. c. 102 Cleomed. Meteot. l. 1. c. 10. and by Cleomedes, to be 15 furlongs, that is, one mile and seuen eight parts: Or else, equall to the height of the greatest mountaines, to whose height, and the deepenesse of the Sea, the Geometricians (as Plutarch hath recorded) anciently assigned equall dimensions.Plutarch in Vita Aemilij Pauli. Or yet rather (if you will any thing respect my opinion) it is a great deale more.Scalig. de Subtilitate. Exercit. 38. For, as for the shallow speculation of Scaliger, and And. Baccius de Thermis. l. 1. c. 4. & Alij.others, of the shallownesse of the Sea, determining the height of Hilles, farre to surpasse the deepenesse of the sea: And that in very few places, it attaineth 100 passes of depth, is indeed true in the narrow Channels and Straits of the Sea: But in the free and large Ocean, it is by the experience of Nauigators knowen to bee as false as the Gospell is true. Indeed touching the height of mountaines, I finde it pronounced by the great Mathematician Eratosthenes in Theon,
               Theon. in Comment. Magnae Construction. Ptolom. l. 1. that the highest sort of them, passe not in perpendicular erectnesse 10 furlongs (that is one mile and one fourth part) of which height also, it is obserued in Plinie,
               Plin. l. 2. c. 63. Plutarch. loc. supra citato. that Dicaearchus by Dioptricall Instruments, found the Hill Pelius in Thessalie to bee, and in Plutarch, that Xenagoras (another Mathematician) obserued the height of Olympus, in the same Region, sauing, that in this later, there is an addition of 20 passes, for the whole number of passes, is 1270. Neither do I find any greater perpendicular height attributed to Mountaines, by any ancient writer, Cleomedes excepted:Cleomed. l. 1. Meteor. c. 10. who assigneth to the height of Hils, as he doth also to the depth of the Sea, 15 furlongs.

(For Alhazen I omit, because he onely restraineth the height of hilles,Alhazen. de Crepuscul. propos. 1. as namely, not to exceed 8 miles, without determining what their height should be) But yet, all these, are to bee vnderstood, I take it, with relation to the Mountaines in and about Greece, with which themselues were acquainted, which may in no sort compare with the huge Mountaines of vast Continents, such as are the Alpes in Europe, Atlas in Afrique, Caucasus in India, the Andes in Peru, and such other.
            But, whatsoeuer the height of Hilles may bee aboue the common superficies of the Earth, it seemeth to me after good consideration, that the depth of the Sea, is a great deale more. For declaration of which point, I require to be supposed, first, that the Earth at the first forming of it, was in the superficies, regular, and sphericall: which the Holy Scripture directs vs to beleeue, because the water couered and compassed all the face of the Earth: And secondly, that the face of the Land is in largenesse and expansion, at least equall to that of the sea: And thirdly, that the vneuennesse and irregularity, which is now seene in the superficies of the Earth was caused (as is noted in Damascen) either,Damascen. l. 1. de fide Orthodoxa c. 10. by taking of some parts out of the vpper face of the Earth in sundry places, to make it more hollow, and laying them in other places, to make it more conue
                  •
               e▪ Or else (which in effect is equiualent to that) by raysing vp some, and depressing others to make roome and receite for the sea: that mutation being wrought by the power of that word,Genes. 1.9. 
               Let the waters be gathered into one place, that the

dry land may appeare. For, as for the fancy of Aquinas, Dionysius,
               Aquin. in Sum pa. 1. q. 69. a. 1. Dionys. Carth Catharin. & Alij in Comment. cap. 1. Genes. 
               Catharinus and some other Diuines namely, that that gathering of waters and discouerie of the Earth, was made, not by any mutation in the Earth, but by a violent accumulation of the waters, or heaping them vp on high, it is too vnreasonable. Because it is vtterly against the nature of water, being a flexible and ponderous body, so to consist, and stay it selfe, and not fall to the lower parts about it, where in nature there is nothing at all to hinder it. Or, if it be hindered and restrayned supernaturally, by the hand and bridle of the almighty, lest it should ouerwhelme and drowne the Land, it must follow thereof, that God in the very institution of nature, imposed a perpetuall violence vpon nature: And this withall, that at the Deluge, there had beene no necessitie at all, to break vp the springs of the deepe, and to open the Cataracts of Heauen, and powre downe water continually, so many dayes and nights together vpon the Earth, seeing, the only withdrawing of that hand, or letting goe of that bridle, which restrayned the water, would presently haue ouerwhelmed all.
            But, to come to the Point. It seemeth vpon the former suppositions (of which, the holy scripture establisheth the first, Experience of Trauailers, and Nauigators the second, and Reason the third) that in making estimation of the depth of the Sea, wee are not to reckon and consider onely, the height of the Hilles, aboue the common superficies of the Earth, vnto which the extraordinary depthes

or whirlpooles, that are found in the Sea, doe properly answere (descending beneath the ordinary bottome of the Sea, as the Hilles ascend aboue the ordinary face of the Land) but, the aduantage or height of all the dry Land aboue the superficies of the Sea. Because the whole Masse of the Earth, that now appeareth aboue the waters, being taken as it were out of the place, which the waters now possesse, must bee equall to the place out of which it was taken, and consequently it seemeth, that the height or eleuation of the one, should answere the depth or descending of the other. And therefore as I sayd, in estimating the deepenesse of the Sea, wee are not to consider onely the erection of the Hilles, aboue the ordinary land, but the aduantage of all the dry land aboue the sea. Which later, I meane the height of the ordinary maine Land, (euen excluding the hilles) is in my opinion more in large Continents aboue the Sea, then that of the Hilles, is aboue the Land. For first, that the plaine and common face of the drie Land, is not leuell, or equally distant from the Center, but hath great decliuity and descent toward the Sea, and accliuitie or rising toward the Midland parts, although it appeare not so to the common view of the Eye, is to reason notwithstanding manifest. Because as it is found in that part of the Earth, which the Sea couereth that it descendeth lower, and lower toward the middest of the sea, (for the Sea which touching the vpper face of it, is knowen to beleuell by nature, and euenly distant from the Center, is withall obserued to waxe deeper and deeper, the

farther one sayleth from the shore toward the Maine) Euen so, in that part which is vncouered, the coursings and streamings of Riuers on all sides from the midland parts toward the Sea, By which rule of the proceeding of Riuers by the decliuity of the earth and euer sliding from the higher ground to the lower, till they come to the Sea, is euident to bee discerned, that in Continents, those Regions are the higher Land frō which Riuers streame, & those the lower ground, to which they proceed, and consequently, that of all, those are the highest which receiuing no forrain Riuers, to which they giue passage through them, do send forth the longest Riuers on all sides to the regions round about thē. By which obseruation is to be discerned, that Heluetia and Rhetia, sending forth the longest Riuers of Europe, which on all sides descend from them and their confines, Danubius toward the East, Rhene North, Rhodanus West, beside Ticinus, Addua, and others, that fall into Padus South, are the highest land of Europe: As the Region of Pamer, and Kirgessi, with some other neere the crossing of the great mountaines Taurus and Imaus aboue India, whēce are directed, the greatest and longest Riuers of Asia, Indus and Ganges toward the South, Oxus and Iaxartus toward the West, Oechardes North, Cantan East, is proued by the same reason, to be the heighest part of Afrique & Asia, and in my opinion of all the Earth. And as the region also about the springs of Nilus, from which beside Nilus, that runneth towards the North, are sent forth, the riuer of Magnice, towards the South, of Zaire West, of Coauo & Zuama East, being (Niger excepted) the greatest riuers of Afrique, is by the same reason, proued to be, the heighest part of that continent. whose propertie wee know is to slide from the higher to the lower, euidently declare so much.
            And although I am not able precisely to determine, what the ordinary decliuity of the earth may be, yet, if that be conuenient in the workes of nature, which is required in the workes of Art, that imitateth Nature, it will bee found true that before I sayd: Namely, that in great Continents, through which Riuers haue long Courses, some of 1000, or 2000 miles, the height of the ordinary Midland, aboue the face of the Sea, is more, then of the Hilles aboue the common face of the Earth, for Plinie in the deriuation of water,

            And, although I know well enough, that water being (as it is) heauy and flexible, will slide away at any inequalitie, and therefore am altogether perswaded, that this rule of Vitruuius touching conueiance of waters, is not to be taken as a rule of necessitie, to be obserued in the deriuing of them, as if water could not runne without that aduantage, (for in that respect the Conueiers of waters of these times, contēt themselues euen with one inch

in 600 foote, as Philander also on Vitruuius,
               Philand in Vitruu. l. 8. c. 7. hath obserued) but is rather to bee vnderstood as a rule of commodity, namely with relation to the expedition and holesomenesse of the water so conueied, lest resting too long in the pipes it should contract from them some vnholesome qualitie, or else through the slacknesse of motion, or long closenesse, or banishment from the aire, it might gather some aptnesse and disposition to putrefie. Although I say, such excesse of aduantage as in the artificiall conueance of waters the forenamed authors require, be not of necessitie exacted, in the naturall deriuation of thē: yet neuerthelesse certaine it is, that the descent of riuers, being as it is continuall, and the course of some of them verie long, and in many places swift, and here, and there headlong & furious, the difference of height or aduantage, can not but be great, betwixt the springs of riuers and their outlets, betwixt their first rising out of the earth, and their falling into the sea.
            
               Vnto which decliuitie of the land, seeing the deepenesse of the sea doth in proportion answer (as I before declared) & not onely to the height of hils. It remaineth that we esteeme and determine that deepenesse to be a great deale more, then it hath beene hetherto by Philosophers commonly reputed. And although the deepenesse of the Sardinian sea (which indeede Aristotle acknowledgeth for the deepest part of the mediterrane) bee specially recorded by Posidonius in Strabo,
               Arist. Meteor l. 2. c. 1. Strabo. l. 1. longe post medium. to haue beene found but 1000 fadomes (
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ) which is but a mile and one fift part: yet what may the depth in that narrow sea bee, compared to the hollow deepenesse of the vast Ocean? Or rather (to turne this Instance to our aduantage) if in so narrow a sea as the mediterraine is (whose bredth attayneth not where it is largest, 600 miles) the depth bee so great, what may wee esteeme the deepenesse of the huge Ocean to be, that is in many places aboue fiue times as broade? especially, seeing that the broader that seas are, if they be withall entire, and free from Islands, they are answerablie obserued to be the deeper.
            But whether haue I beene carried by these Elephants and Whales? to what heights and depths, of Mountaines, and Seas? I pray you pardon mee, for I see I haue digressed, that is, transgressed, now I returne into the way againe.

               NOw, if out of the former long discourse, I should collect a short somme, and estimate the proportion with respect to the whole earth, that each one of the forementioned religions, haue to the other. It being first supposed, which vpon exact consideration and calcalation, will bee found to swarue very little from the truth, that the proportions of Europe, Afrique, Asia, and America, are as 1.3.4 & 7. And that the professors of the forementioned religions, possesse the seuerall portions and proportions, of each of them, which is before set downe: It will be found I say vpon these suppositions (which the best Gographie, and histories doe perswade mee to bee true) that Christians possesse, neere about a fixt part of the knowne inhabited earth: Mahumetans, a fift part (not as Pos

                  ue. some haue exceedingly ouerlashed, halfe the world or more) and Idolaters, two thirds, or but little lesse. So that, if we diuide the knowne regions of the world, into 30 equall parts. The Christians part is as fiue, the Mahumetans as sixe, and the Idolaters as nineteene, for the poore dispersed and distressed Christians, which are found in Asia and Afrique, mingled among

               Mahumetans, and Idolaters, I receaue not into this account, both because they are but thinne dispersed, in respect of the multitudes of Mahumetans and Idolaters in those regions among whom they liue (being withall vnder their dominion) and because also, many Mahumetans, are found mingled among Christians in Europe, to recompence and counteruaile a great part of that number.
            Such therefore may be the generall proportion of Christians to Mahumetans and Idolaters, in the continents of the earth hetherto discouered, namely, in this our neighbour continent of the East comprehending Europe, Afrique, and Asia, and in that other continent of the West, called America, and in the Islands belonging to them both. But if the South or Antarctique continent, be so large, as I am verily perswaded it is (euen no lesse, then that of the East before mentioned, which containeth Europe, Afrique and Asia together) then will the Idolaters be found to surpasse all the other religions, in exceeding great proportion, for that the Inhabitants of that South continent, are Idolaters, there is no question at all ( as I take it) to bee made, both because in the parts hitherto known, as namely in the region of Varro. l. 6. de Ling. Latina. 
               Beach, ouer against Iaua, they were found to be so: And also, because they are knowne to be no other then Idolaters, that inhabite all those parts of the other continents, that neighbour most towards them, from whom it is likely, they should haue receaued the change of their religion, if any were: for first, in Asia, both

               India, and the Islands of the Indian sea, whereof some lie close on the South continent. Secondly, in Afrique, the regions about the Cape of Buona Speranza. And Thirdly, in America, the Countries that border on Magaglians Straite, which are the neerest neighbours to the foresaid continent of the South, are knowne to bee all ouerspred with Idolaters.
            Now that the South continent is no lesse then I before esteemed it, namely, then that of Asia, Afrique and Europe altogether, although I might be probablie induced to beleeue so, because it is well knowne, both (touching latitude) to approach in some parts neere the equator, and (touching longitude) to runne along in a continuall circuite about the earth, fronting both the other continents: Yet haue I also another reason of more certaine importance, to perswade me: Namely, because it is well knowne, that the land to the North side of the line, in the other continents (the old and new world) yet altogether is at least foure times as large as that part of them which lieth to the South. Now, forasmuch as it is certaine,For touching the first of these suppositions. It is the propertie of water, euer to fall that way, where it findeth decliuitie. Wherefore, if the water, in the vpper face of it, were higher in one place then in another, it would necessarily fall, from the heigher position to the lower, because it is heauie and flexible, & hath nothing in the open and free Sea, to let or hinder it. And consequently, would neuer rest setled and stable, till the face of it were leuelled, in an euen distance from the cēter. first by Archimedes his rule,Archimed. de Insidentib. Aquae l. 1.

                  . l. 3. c. 12 & Alij. as Grammarians say:And touching the second if the earth were vnequallie poysed on opposite sides of the center, then must it follow, that the least and lighter masse of the earth should presse downe as forciblie, as the greater and weightier, because it attaineth the center as well as it. But if it be graunted, which reason doth inforce, that the weightier part of the earth, should presse downeward, with greater force, and with more right challenge the center, then the lighter part: it must follow, that the lighter masse or side of the earth, must yeelde and giue place to the weightier, so farre, till the center of that whole masse of the earth take possession of the center of the world (for till then, one side will be still heauier then the other) and so the opposite halfes of the earth, in respect of heauinesse, be brought on all sides, about the center, vnto a perfect equilibration. And secondly, by the Philosophers knowne rule, that the earth is equally poised on both sides of her owne center.And the third may be established, by manifest demonstration. Because, a clod of earth, suffered to fall from any point of the aire, wheresoeuer, on the face of the sea (the same doth water, falling on euen & plaine land) when all is calme, and the aire not troubled with windes, nor the sea with waues, will descend by a perpendicular line, on the face of the water. In such sort I say, that the line by which it falleth maketh exactly equall and right angles on all sides, with the face of the water whereon it falleth. Therefore it is manifest, that the earth so falling, tēdeth directly to the center of the water Because no straight line insisteth perpendicularly, on the face or circumference of any special body (as the water is) except only those that proceede directly to the center of the sphaire: But certaine it is, that the earth is withal directly carried toward it own center, therefore there is but one common center of the water and of the earth. And thirdly, that the center of the earth & of the water are all one (both of thē being indeede no other thē the center of the world) which though some phantastical heads haue called into question yet no sound philosopher euer doubted of: It followeth thereupon, that the earth should in answerable measure and proportion, lift it selfe and appeare aboue the face of the sea, on the south side of the line, as it doth on the north.

And consequently, that what is wanting in the South parts of the two foresaid continents towards the counteruailing of the North parts (which is about three fiue parts of both the other continents laied together) must of necessitie be supplied in the continents of the South. And yet I omit all the land, that may be about the Arctique Pole, beyond the Scythian or Sarmatian sea, which must be also counterpoysed in that Antarchtique continent, for nothing comes within the compasse of my vnderstanding, to bee hereto replied, except any would perhaps imagine, that either the sea

on the South side of the equator, is verie shallow, or that the land of that cōtinēt, may be much higher aboue the face of the sea, thē the land of the other two (& so equal in masse, though lesse in circuit) or that the earth on the south side of the Equator, should be of a more ponderous disposition, thē on the North, in which cases, some cōpensation of weightines, may be made for the want of extention. But of these three, the experience of sailers euidently refelleth the first, who in equall distance from the land, obserue an equall deepenesse of the sea, in both South and North latitude. And neither is there any experience, nor good reason that can be alleadged to establish either of the later: which, but that I haue alreadie too much offended by digressions, I could prooue I doubt not against all exception. But this for a conclusion to this discourse, I dare pronounce touching that South cōtinent, that it wil certainely be foūd (in the after times, when it shall be better discouered) much larger then any globe or map hitherto extant, hath represented it.
            Such therfore (as I haue declared) is the general state of Christianity at this present in the world, & the proportion of it to other religions. But because you require yet further to be specially informed of the diuers sorts and sects of Christians that are abroad in the world, and withall of their diuers regions and religions, at least of those principall characters

of their religion, wherin they specially differ each from other, I will here set downe my second period, touching the generall differences of religions, and of the seuerall parts of the world where they are maintained: and will now proceed to that particular consideration touching the sects of Christianity, and indeuour to giue you the best satisfaction that my poore reading, and obseruation may inable me to performe.

            The Grecians acknowledge obedience to the Patriarch of Constantinople, vnder whose Iurisdiction are in Asia,Bellon.

            Of which great extendment of the Greeke Patriarchs iurisdiction, if you demand the reason: I haue obserued sundry occasions, from whence it hath proceeded. For first, his originall or Primitiue authority assigned, or rather confirmed to him, (as Bishop of the Jmperiall citie) by the coū

And fourthly, by the Turks conquests made vpon the Westerne countries, subiect before to the Bishop of Rome: all which, while partly, the former Bishops and Pastors fled, to auoid the Turks oppression (like the hireling that forsaketh the flocke, when he seeth the wolfe comming) and partly, while the Patriarch of Constantinople, to supply that default, was faine to prouide them of new ministers, they haue beene by little and little brought & trained to the Greeke religion.
            Now as touching the proper characters of their religion, I must, for the better designing and remembring of them, set before me some instance or patterne, to compare it, and other sects of Religion withall: And that is most fit to be the Romane Church, both because their differences with that Church specially, are in writers most obserued.

So that, by that meanes my discourse may be the shorter, and yet no lesse perspicuous to you, that know the opinions of the Romane Church so well. The principall characters then of the Grecians religion, (for none but the principall you require, and to mention euery slender difference of ceremonies, would be but tedious, and fruitlesse, (and is beside without my compasse) are these that follow.

               Hieron. in lib. de Nominib. Hebraicis. Plin. l. 5. c. 19. which name it seemeth to haue obtained, either because it was built on a Rocke, for so Burchardus that viewed the place hath obserued) which

                in the Phoenician toung signifies: or else as Hierome deriues it, of the straitnesse and scarcenes of roome, as being seated in a smal Iland (but 19. miles in circuit as Plinie noteth) a small Territory for such a City: or perhaps, because it was the strongest fortres (for that also 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                importeth) of all those Regions, as being founded on a rocke, enuironed with the sea, (for it was before Q Curt. l. 4. 
               Alexanders time Plin. loc. citabo. 700. paces distant from the firme land) mightily strengthened by fortifications of Art, populous as beeing the Metropolis of Phoenicia, and exceeding rich as sometime the Cittie of greatest traffique in the World.
            Of this city then, both the region and inhabitants of Suria obtained their names: but Melchitae
               
as I saide they were termed, meerely in respect of their religion, wherein namely they altogether followed the examples and decrees of the Emperours. For whereas after the Councell of Chalcedon, infinite perplexity and trouble began to arise in the East parts, principally about the opinion of Eutyches and Dioscorus, of one only nature in Christ, which that councel had condemned, but notwithstanding found many that maintained it, and reiected the Councell, in those Easterne countries: And thereupon the Emperour Leo began to exact, (as diuers other of his Successours afterward did) the suffrages and subscriptions of the Easterne Bishops, for the better establishment of the Councel.Niceph. Callist Histor. Ecclesiast. l. 18. c. 52. Then began they that embraced and approued the authority of that Councell, because they followed the Emperours decrees, made in behalfe of it, to be termed by their aduersaries, Melchitae, of Melchi, saith Nicephorus, (rather 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ) which in the speech of Syria signifieth a King: (as one would say of the Kings Religion) whereas they that opposed themselues to the Councell, were distracted into no lesse then twelue seueral sects, and not long after into many more, as the same Lib. 18. c. 45. 
               Nicephorus hath recorded.
            Now although the Syrians or Melchites, are for their religion meerely of the Grecians opinions. As:

            Of the Nestorians. CHAP. XIX.
            
               THe Nestorians, who haue purchased that name, by their ancient imitation, and maintaining of Nestorius his heresie, inhabite (though euery where mingled with Mahumetans, or with Pagans) a great part of the Orient, for besides the cuntries of Babilon, and Assyria, and Mesopotamia, and Parthia, and Media, wherein verie manie of them are found, that sect is spred and scattered farre and wide in the East, both Northerly to Cataya, and Southerly to India. So that in Marcus Paulus his historie of the East regions, and in Guil. de Rubr. It

            The reason of which large spreading and preuailing of that sect so farre in the orient, if you enquire I finde to that purpose, recorded by Paulus Diaconus of Cosrhoes the King of Persia,

                  us, by whom he had beene sore afflicted with a grieuous warre, inforced all the Christians of the Persian Empire to Nestorianisme permitting no catholiques to remaine in all his dominions. By whose preaching, the Christian religion being farre there inlarged and propagated into the East (as it seemes both because those of the Persian dominion, were more Eastwardly then other Christians, and because it is certaine, that all of them till this day acknowledge obedience to the Nestorian Patriarch in Mesopotamia, which Country was then part of the Persian dominion:) It is no wonder if sowing their owne tares and Christes wheate together, they propagated with the gospell also there owne heresie. Shortly after which time, the Sarracens of Arabia (Mahumetans) conquering Persia, and bringing their religion, together with their victories into all that large dominion, there remained but little outward meanes and slender hope of their repaire and reformation from any sound part of the Church, (from which they were more now then afore diuided)

except what affliction and time, and the grace of God might worke and repaire in them.
            Now touching their ecclesiasticall gouernment: The patriarch of the Nestorians, to whom all those of the East parts, acknowledge obedience (a number of whose suffragan Bishops and Metropolitans,Sand de Visibil.

                  Muzal, the patriarchall seate of the Nestorians, is either a remainder of the ancient Niniue, as Vitriacus, and Tyrius (who therefore in his historie calleth the Inhabitants of that Citie, Niniuites) haue recorded: Or at least, built neere the Ruines of it: Namely, ouer against it, on the other side of the riuer Tigris, as by Beniamin, who diligently viewed the place, is obserued, for Niniue (which hee noteth to bee dissolued into scattered villages, and castles) stoode on the East bancke of Tigris, on Assyria side: whereas Muzal is seated on the West banke on Mesopotamia side, being yet both ioyned together, by a Bridge made ouer Tigris.

               Beniamin. in Itinerar. in Medio. or new Babilon, my obseruations in Geographie and historie, will not suffer mee to approoue.

Plin. l. 6. c. 26. a great deale more, distant from Babilon, whereas Bagdet is built close by the ruines of it.

Plin. l. 6. c. 26. more North then that of Babilon whereas Bagdet is more South. Thirdly, because in Dion, and others, Seleucia is named for a Citie of Mesopotamia, which Bagded is not, but in the prouince of

               Babilon, as being beneath the confluence of Tigris and Euphrates.

                   &relations of these times be true, there is a distraction of that sect: which began about 60 yeares agoe, in the time of Pope Iulius the third: the Nestorians in the North part of Mesopotamia (about the Citie of Caramit) submitting themselues to another Patriarch of the Popes erecting (that reuolting from the Bishop of Muzal, taking also on him, the title of the Patriarch of Muzal, which the Pope bestowed on him) hauing first rendred and professed obedience to the Sea of Rome, in which obedience it is said, that those Nestorians about Caramit doe still continue.

               For Mozal as I said afore, is either Seleucia, or succeeded into the dignity of it. And Seleucia is recorded to haue beene inhabited by the cittizens of Babilon, whereof it was a Colony: And such a Colony, as in short time it Th. a Ies. de conu. gent. l. 7. part. 1. c. 4. exhausted Babilon it selfe, of all the Inhabitans, passing, by reason of the more cōmodious situation, to dwell at Seleucia. So that Seleucia beeing inhabited by the Babilonians, and so becomming in stead of Babilon, the principall citty of the Prouinces of Babilonia, and Assyria, the citty Plin. loco proxim. citato obtained the name of Babilon of her inhabitants, (as well as Seleucia of her founder) as Plinie hath recorded: And the Patriarch of it, the title of the Patriarch of Babilon.

As also, because the Indians are known to haue bin Nestorians, to which heresie the Armenians were most opposite, as beeing in a manner Iacobites. But as it seemeth, that Patriarch is saide to haue beene of Armenia, for the nearenesse of Mozal to the confines of Armenia.

That their new Testament which in their Churches they formerly read, (and still doe) in the Syriaque toung, was by the Nestorians in sundry places, which are now altered by the Romans, corrupted to the aduantage of that heresie, wherin yet, I thinke the reporter is deceaued: because the same corruptions obiected to them, (wherof some are no corruptions at all, but agree rightly with the originall text, and much better then doth the vulgar Latine, by comparing whereof he examines them, and censures them for corruptions) the same I say, are found in the Syriaque edition that wee

But yet notwithstanding, I am indeede certainly perswaded, that the Syriaque translation of the new Testament (whosoeuer was the Authour of it) is nothing neere of that Antiquity,The Imperfections of the Syriaque edition, consist partly in sundry defects: namely 1. of all the Reuelation: 2. of the Epistle of S. Iude: 3. of the second epistle of S. Peter: 4. of the secōd and third Epistles of S. Iohn: 5. of the history of the Woman taken in adultery, in the eight chapter of S. Iohns Gospel, containing the first eleuen verses: and 6. of the 7. verse of the fifth Chapter of the first Epistle of S. Iohn. Of which, the two last wants are no lesse foūd in sundry auncient Greeke copies, as Erasmus, Beza, Iunius & others haue obserued: And partly; beside these defects, in some (very few) faulty translations. which the Syrians (as Bellarmine and others report of them) pretend it to bee,Bellar. de Verbo Dei. l. 2. c. 4. namely to haue bene the work of S. Marke. First, because S. Mark died in the 8. yeare of Nero,

S. Paul to the Galathians, Ephesians, Philippians, Collossians, to Philemon, and the second to Timothy. Secondly, because that Syriaque translation is not to bee found once mentioned, in any of all those ancient and learned writers, that liued in those east parts, and diligently sought out and obserued the seuerall editions and translations of the holy scripture. And thirdly, because the dialect discouereth it to be of a farre later age, then that of the Apostles: which they will soone finde to be so, (to omit some other euidences) that shall compare the Syriaque words recorded in the new Testament by the Euangelists, (which all are noted by Hierome and by others) with the Syriaque booke: as for example,Hieron. l. de Nominib.

And to be short, there is not almost any Syriaque worde recorded in the new Testament, which varieth not from that ancient pronouncing that was vsuall in the Apostles time, either in consonants, or vowels, or both: which could not bee the alteration of any short course of time.

            These are the Properties (that I finde registred) of the Iacobites religion, namely of them, that are properly so called, and still retaine the auncient opinions of Iacobus Syrus. But it seemeth, that their principall errour, and which occasioned their first schisme and separation from the Church, Namely the heresie of Eutiches, touching one nature in Christ, is for the most part, long since abolished, for as Vitriacus hath long agoe recorded,Vitriac. Histor Orient. c. 76. they denied to him (then the Popes legate in those parts, and demaunding the question) that they beleeued one onely nature in Christ: And being further asked, why then making the crosse, they signed themselues onely with one finger, their answer was, that they did it in acknowledgement of one diuine Nature, as also they did it in three seuerall places, in acknowledgement of three persons in that one nature. And beside of late time, Leonard another legate of Pope Gregories the 13 in those parts, hath recorded of the Patriarchs profession made to himselfe, that although they held indeede but one personated nature to bee in Christ, resulting of the

vnion of two natures not personated, yet they acknowledged those two natures to bee vnited in his person, without any mixtion or confusion, and that they themselues differed not in vnderstanding, but onely in termes from the Latine Church.

Maintaining the opinion of one nature in Christ:Thom. a Iesu de Conu. gent. l. 7. par. 1. c. 5. yet in such sort, that although in the generall position touching one nature in our Sauiour, they follow Eutyches, yet in the speciall declaration, at this day they differ very much from him. For they acknowledge him to be truely, and perfectly both God and man:3. Thom. a. Ies. loc. citato. Botor. loc. cit. And, that the Diuine and humane natures, are become in him one Nature, not by any confusion or commixtion of them, as Eutyches taught: but onely by coadunation. Wherin,

although they catholiquely confesse, that there is no mutation of properties in either nature, being united in Christ, from what the diuine and human natures seuerally obtaine in seuerall Persons: Yet, being not well able (as it seemes) to distinguish betweene the nature and the Person, they dare not say there be in Christ two Natures, for feare they should slip into Nestorius heresie of two Persons. Which heresie of one onely Nature in our Sauiour, beginning with Eutyches, although after dispersing it selfe into many branches, hath euer since the time of the Counsell of Chalcedon, by which Eutychianisme was condemned and for it, the Patriarch of Alexandria

               , brought to light by Pappus &c. wherin (in the behalfe of that heresie) the decrees of the Councell of Chalcedon were condemned. In which counsell, although we reade of the greatest Confluence of Bishops, that euer mette about the Establishment of any point in Christian religion (and yet beside the 630 Bishops present in that Councell, there are extant in the Ad sin Concil. Chalcedon. Tom. 2. Concil. Binij, Booke of Councels,

the suffrages of about 30 prouinciall Synodes, that by their Epistles to the Emperour Leo, confirmed it, together with all the Bishops of the West, by whom it was likewise receiued) yet notwithstanding all this, that heresie so preuailed in the East parts, and specially in Aegypt, wherof we now entreat, that from that time to this it was neuer cleared of it. But as there was neuer heresie that so grieuously wounded the Church of God, as that of Eutyches, (except perhaps Arrianisme) so was no part of the Church so deepely and deadly wounded by it, as that of Aegypt. So that, euen at this day, although the wound be in some sort healed, yet the wemme or scarre still remaineth. For it is not many yeares, since by certaine lesuits, Agents for the Bishop of Rome, some conferences were had with the Patriarch of Alexandria and his Synode,Boter. Relat. pa. 3. l. 3. c. de Christiani de Egitto. wherein, although they confessed (if true relation be made of that conference) that Christ is true God and true Man: yet did they purposely refraine from mentioning two natures in Christ, lest they should by little and little slippe into the heresie of two persons.

                  5 For although Aluarez in his storie of Aethiopia haue related (as he doth also some other matters touching the ancienter condition of the Church, too grossely and boldly) that the Christians of Nubia, till their defection from Christianity, were of the Popes dependance and Iurisdiction, and receiued their Bishops by his consecration, (and say nothing of the Patriarch of Alexandria) yet certainely, that they were not so, is manifest, for besides that Saligniacus (himselfe the Popes protonotary, and whose trauaile had taught him some knowledge of the East parts, directly denieth the Nubians professing of obedience to the Bishop of Rome, obseruing, that they were gouerned by a Prelate of their owne, whom they termed the Priest of the law. Itiner. Tom. 8. c. 2. Beside that direct testimonie of his I say, there be other Euidences. First, because there cannot be produced any Instance, out of any Ecclesiasticall history, either ancient or moderne (as I am certainely perswaded) to that effect. Secondly, because the fathers of the Nicene

Thirdly, because the Patriarchship of Alexandria, lyeth directly betweene Nubia and Rome, as being immediately at the backe of Aegypt. Fourthly, because the Nubians were in religion Iacobites, as a Roman Cardinal Vitriacus Brocardus, and others haue recorded,Vitriac. histor.

hath left recorded, although they haue a Patriarch of their owne, whom they call in their own language Abuna, (our Father) and he chosen by the Habassine monks of S. Antonies order, remaining in Ierusalem, yet are they limited to choose one of the Iurisdiction of Alexandria, and a You may obserue, which I in my reading haue done, that all the Patriarchs and other Bishops of the East, are monkes of the Orders either of S. Basil, or S. Anthony, for the Patriarchs of Constantinople, of Antiochia & of Armenia, are monks of S. Basils order: the Patriarchs of Alexandria, of Aethiopia, of the Iacobites, and of the Maronites, are of S. Anthonies, And the Patriarch of the Nestorians either of both. monke of S.

            Of the Armenians. CHAP. XXIIII.
            
               THe Armenians, for traffique to which they are exceedingly addicted, are to bee found in multitudes, in most cities of great trade specially in those of the Turkish Empire, obtaining more fauour and priuiledge among the Turkes and other Mahumetans,

Insomuch that no nation seemeth more giuen to Marchandize, nor is for that cause more dispersed abroade, then the Armenians, except the Iewes. But yet the natiue regions of the Armenians, and where they are stil foūd in the greatest multitude, & their religion is most supported, are Armenia the greater (named since the Turkes first possession of it Turcomania) beyond Euphrates, and Armenia the lesse on this side Euphrates, and Cilicia, now termed Carmania.
            
            Now the Armenians touching their Ecclesiasticall gouernement, were aunciently of the Iurisdiction of the Patriarch of Constantinople, as being Notitia pro

And euer since that departure, they acknowledge obedience, without any further or higher dependence, to two Patriarchs of their owne: whom they terme Catholiques.

               Such at this present is the state of the Armenian Church, and the iurisdiction of their Patriarchs. But it should seeme, by that I finde recorded, by Otho Phrisingensis,

In which small circuit, that such a multitude of Bishop
                  •
                should bee found, is vtterly vncredible, especially because we finde registers extant, both of the Bishops of the two Armeniaes, in the Tom. 1. Iuris Oriental l. 2.

               Guilielmus Tyrius: and all of them put together, exceede not the number of thirtie. And although I finde that Nouel. 31. cap. 1. 
               Iustinian diuided the two Armeniaes into foure prouinces (which yet to haue beene after reduced 'againe into two, the Nouell of Leo euen now mentioned assureth vs) yet were not for that cause, the number of Bishops encreased anie whit the more.

               1. They are charged with the opinion of one nature in Christ:Niceph. hist. Ecclesiastic l. 18. c. 53. yet not as Eutyches imagined it one, namely, by a permixtion and confusion of the diuine and humane natures, but yet by such a coniunction and coalition of them, that they both together, make but one compounded nature in our Sauiour, as the body and soule, but one compound nature in man. But neuerthelesse, it seemeth by the confession of the Armenians, which wee haue extant touching the Trinitie, sent by the mandate of the Catholique of Armenia,

                     Iacobus a Vitriaco, and Guilielmus Tyrius, the one Bishop of Acon, and the other of Tyre, haue recorded: yet shortly after, when those parts were by Saladin, the King of Aegypt and Syria, recouered from the Christians, those Maronites relapsed, and forsooke againe the Roman communion, till the late times of Pope Gregorie the XIII. and Clement the VIII. with whom they againe renewed it.
               
            
            And, this heresie of the Monothelites, springing out of that bitter roote of the Iacobites, touching one onely nature in Christ, was the last of that lōg and wicked traine of heresies, which vpon the contempt of the councell of Chalcedon, exceedingly wasted and ruined the East Church, for after that the detestation of Nestorius heresie, touching two Persons in our Sauiour, (condemned in the third generall Councel) had so immoderately distempered the phantasies of Eutiches in Constantinople, & of the Patriarch of Alexandria, Dioscorus with other their adherents, that they thought not themselues safe enough from the heresie of two persons, till they were fallen into the other and opposite extremity of one nature in Christ, the Diuine and humane natures in Christ (in their conceits) by permixtion and confusion of substances, & of properties growing into one, vpon their adunation: and withall, that the humane nature of Christ, was not consubstantiall to ours, but of another kind, &

condition, which phantasies the fourth generall councell condemned. After I say this heresie of Eutiches and Dioscorus, had growne to that head in Aegypt & Syria, that like a violent & furious streame, whose course would not bee stayed, it bare downe before it all oppositions, and among the rest, that great & reuerend councell of Chalcedon, that had condemned it, and was contemned by it, it gaue occasion for an infinite traine of heresies to follow at the breach, which it had made.
            For first (to omit infinite extrauagant branches,

                that sprang from it, and infinitely deformed the Church, renting with many schismes the vnity, & with as many heresies wounding the faith of it) It drew after it, the heresie of the passiblenesse of the deitie, because the deity of Christ, was become (in their conceits) the same nature with the humanity, that was passible. Secondly, (the absurdity of that being discerned) it occasioned an other extremely opposite, namely of the Impassibility of the humanity of our Sauiour, (but on the same ground) because namely, it was become one nature with the deitie, which now we know to bee vnpassible. Thirdly, when the fondnesse of both were discouered, It bred a new deuise, touching one nature in our Sauiour (as the wit of Heretiques will better serue them, to deuise a thousand shifts to delude the truth, then their pride will suffer them once to yeelde and acknowledge it) It bred I say a new deuise, namely, to be one, not by permixtion or confusion of substances, as Eutyches first taught, but onely by composition, the deitie and humanitie,

by coalition becomming one nature in Christ, as the bodie and soule grow into one nature in Man. And fourthly, when this phantasie began also somewhat to abate, and relent in manie: yet still a fraction as it were or rather a consequent of it was retained (for indeede it implieth by necessarie consequence the vnitie of nature) namely that there was but one will, and one action of both natures in the person of our Sauiour. And God knowes what a traine and succession of heresies might haue followed these, if that Lord, whom they had infinitely wronged by their wanton and wandring conceats of him, had not, to stop the course and streame of their wickednesse and follie, brought on them, the Sarracens of Arabia, for euen while the Church, specially that of the Easterne parts, was in great perplexitie and trauaile, with the heresie of the Monethelites (which I last mentioned) the Mahumetans of Arabia, like a mightie inundation brake forth, and ouerwhelmed all, and them first, that first, and most had wronged the Sonne of God, by fostering the forenamed heresies, and the infinite brood that sprung of them, I meane Aegypt and Syria, and to this day, both they, and the neighbouring nations that had beene infected by them, remaine in thraldome. But yet as in the diseases and distempers of our bodies, contraries are vsually healed by contraries, so seemeth it to haue fallen out in the distempers of these mens religions, for as worldly prosperitie and wantonnesse of wit (ordinarie companions) wherewith these nations in those times abounded, bred in them their ordinarie children, namely,

prosperitie of the world, pride, and wantonnesse of wit, errour, which couple in matter of faith and religion, is wont to produce no better issue then heresie. So on the other side hauing now at length, their harts humbled, and their wits taimed by that pouertie and affliction, wherein the tyrannie and oppression of the Arabians and Turkes hath long holden them, it seemeth the Lord hath taken pi

For certainely, that they and other Christians of the East, haue (at least in these later times) disclaimed and abandoned, those hereticall phantasies touching our Sauiour, wherein by their misleaders they had beene aunciently plunged (and which many Christians of these West parts, still charge them with all) doth manifestly appear, First of Biblioth.

            Of the seuerall Languages wherein the Liturgies of Christians in seuerall parts of the World are celebrated. CHAP. XXVI.
            
               ANd thus haue I related, the seuerall sects of Christians, that are abroad in the world, with the places of their habitations, and the special characters (that are recorded) of their religions. One point notwithstanding of their difference, haue I left purposely as yet vntouched, both for the amplenesse of the matter, and because I conceaue you would haue it declared seuerally. Namely, touching the different languages, in which all these seuerall sorts of Christians, celebrate their Liturgies or diuine seruice.
            But first, to speake a word or two, of the publique seruice of the Iewes, and of the Mahumetans, in their Synagogues, and Meskeds (seeing I intreated before of those religions.) The Iewes where they obtaine libertie for their Synagogues, celebrate theirs, in the auncient Hebrew tongue,Michou. l. 2. de Sarmatia. c. 1. Crus. Turcog. l. 7. pa. 487. &c as Michouius, with manie others, hath related, and as in manifest, by their owne editions of their publique praiers, printed both at Venice, and in Polonia, in that language.
            But the Mahumetans haue theirs in the Arabique tongue (the natiue language of their prophet) as

Indeede I finde it recorded in Durandus (but vpon what warrant and authoritie I cannot finde) that til the time of Hadrian the Emperour (that is about 120 yeares after Christ) their Liturgies were all celebrated in the Hebrew tongue: And that then, the Orientall Church began, first to celebrate them in Greeke. Indeede mee thinkes it is possible, that the Christians of the Gentiles might in honour of the Apostles, retaine the Apostles Liturgies, in the verie tongue wherein by the Apostles themselues, they had beene first ordained, for it is not to be doubted, but Vide Baronium.

gentile & forraine nations. It is not to be doubted I say, but the Apostles, while they remained in Iurie, ordained liturgies in the Iewish tongue, for the vse of those Iewes, whom they had conuerted to Christianitie: which liturgies by the Christian disciples of the Iewish nation, dispersed in manie prouinces of the gentiles, might together with Christian religion, be carried abroad, and gladly entertained among the gentiles. This is possible I say, but if it be also true (as I haue not obserued any thing in antiquitie that may certainly impeach the truth of it) yet that which is spoken by Durandus of those Liturgies in the Hebrew tongue, must be vnderstood (I doubt not) of the Hebrew then vulgar and vsuall, that is to say the Syriaque tongue: Not onely, because in that language, we finde them in these times, celebrated by the Christians of the East: but also because I can conceaue no reason, either, why the Liturgies should bee ordained by the Apostles in that language which the Iewes thēselues (the learned excepted) vnderstood not, if it were done for the Iewes: or else why the Gentiles, should translate them (or vse them so translated) out of the Hebrew into the Syriaque, seeing both were to them alike, vulgarly vnknowne, and not vnderstood. But howsoeuer it was in that most auncient and primitiue state of the Church, in and immediately following the Apostles times, the difference certainely among Christians in these present times, in that behalfe is verie great, some of them celebrating their liturgies in their owne natiue and vulgar, and some other in learned and forraine tongues.
            
               The Christians then (to speake first of the first sort) that celebrate them in their owne vulgar languages, are the Armenians, Habassines, Moscouttes with Russians, Sclauonians, and Protestants.

                that they also exercise their publique diuine seruice in their owne language: which to haue beene allowed them by the

Pope, at the suit of Cyrill their Bishop, or as Auentin. l 4. Annal. others say, of Methodius (but the difference is of no importance, for they both liued in the same time, and were companions in preaching the Gospell to barbarous nations) Aeneas Siluius and others haue recorded.

                And, in particular of the Liburnians, (the more Westerly part of the Slauouians) it is affirmed by Auentine: and of the Dalmatians, (the more Easterly part of them) by Angelus Roccha, that they celebrate their liturgies in their owne language: Which, Roccha saith the Dalmatians are most certainely perswaded to haue beene of Hieromes deuising. But yet in determining the Antiquity of that custome, Roccha that referreth it to Pope Paul the second is greatly mistaken: Because wee finde it to haue beene much more anciently granted them by Pope Iohn the eighth that they might both reade the Scriptures, and celebrate masse, in their owne tongue, as appeareth by the same

And euen Roccha himselfe (forgetting himselfe) confesseth it in another place, to haue beene obtayned of the Pope by Cyrill, who was about 600 yeares ancienter then Paul the second. And certainely (now I am speaking of Popes) of no other Iudgement touching diuine seruice in vulgar tongues, seemeth Pope Innocent the third to haue beene (and perhaps it was also the decree of the Councell of Lateran) charging that in citties,Concil Lateran. c 9. & in Decret. l. 1. Tit. 31. ca. 14 where there as concourse of diuerse nations, that differed in languages, and ceremonies, diuine seruice and the sacraments, should be celebrated according to that difference.
            
               But to speake a little in particular of the vulgar translation of the holy Scripture vsed among the Dalmatians: It is not onely affirmed by sundry writers to be the worke of Hierome, but Hierome himselfe in his Epistle to Sophronius, seemeth to Hosius de Sacro Vernacul. legendo. Postell▪ de lingua Illyrica. Eraim. De clarat 37. ad censur. theolog.

Which Cyrill (if you question what hee was) was neither he of Alexandria, nor he of Ierusalem, as Mutius Pansa hath vainely imagined, but another, farre later then either of them, whom in the Slauonique tong they call Chiurill, one that liued about the yeare 860. namely, he that in the time of the Emperour Michael the third, and Pope Nicholas the first together with Methodius, first brought the Mengrelians, Circassians and Gazarans, and after that Martyrolog.

A copie of which translation is remembred by Bonauentura Vulcanius, to be yet remaining in some Librarie of Germany: And it may be, that the Gothique translation of the foure Euangelists, mentioned by Gruter in the booke of ancient Inscriptions, to be of a thousand yeares antiquity and remaining in the Abbey of Werdin, might be part

of that translation of Vulphilas: But yet that besides these translations into vulgar languages, hitherto mentioned of Vulphilas, Chrysostome, and Hierome, the holie scriptures were likewise aunciently translated into the languages of many nations, is affirmed by Hierome: And in particular (although the translators names be not recorded) into the Aegyptian,

bookes of the later Rabbines, are written. And in this second sort of Chaldee, is the holy scripture by the East Christians translated, and their Liturgies at this day celebrated.

first ordained, the long answers of the people to the priest, in their praiers which wee finde in it, may be demonstrations. But touching the old testament, which they haue also (as Arias writes he hath heard from their owne relations,Arias. Montan. in Admonit. praefix. Biblijs Reg. de Versione Syriaca. Postel. i

            And so doe Sixtly, and lastly (to make an end of this reckoning) the poore Christians of the Isle of Zocotora (an Island after Barros his dimension of 60 miles in length and 27 in bredth) without the bay of Arabia,
               Barros. de Asia. Decad. 2. l. 1. cap. 3. for although I finde it questioned touching the religion, whether they bee Iacobites or Nestorians; Iuan Barros affirming the first (and it

may seem so for their nerenesse to the dominions of Habassia) and Ananias proouing the latter because they are vncircumcised,Anan. Fab. ic. del. Mondo. Trat. 3. p. 292. which Iacobites are not, and professe obedience to the Patriarch of Mozal, who is knowne to be Patriarch of the Nestorians: yet in this they both agree, that their diuine seruice (such as it is) is performed in the Chaldee tongue.Boter. Relat. par. 3. l. 3. de Christiani di Socotena. And although Botero relate it to be done in the Hebrew, yet hee meaneth (out of doubt) not the auncient and pure Hebrew, but the latter or degenerate language of the Hebrew, that is to say the Syriaque. As the other also that affirme the publique and solemne deuotions either of these Zocotorini, or anie other Christians in all the East, or South parts of the world, to be red in the Chaldee, require also the like interpretation: Namely to be vnderstoode, not of the right, and Babilonian, but of the Iewish and corrupted Chaldee.
            
            But now to speake of those Christians, that celebrate their Liturgies in the Greeke tongue: I obserue them to be these.
