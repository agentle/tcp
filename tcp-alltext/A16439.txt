            ¶The Prologue.
            
               IT was of Apryll the ſeuen
tene day,
            In that freſhe tyme when
the Roſe ſo gay.
            Hys Flower begynneth to
ſpred and ſpryng
            And al other herbes & trees take liking
            The Byrdes do ſynge ſo mery ſonge,
            In the floriſhing wodes, thē ſelues amōg
            For the ſwetenes of yt time ſo cōfortable
            In the which al thinges be delectable,
            I ſaye for me, whyche the ſayde daye
            In my bed al alone as I laye,
            I thought in my ſlepe that I dyd ſee
            A gooly Medowe, not farre from me,
            wherein of goodly ladies a great cōpanye
            Me thought in my dreame there ſhuld be.
            The fyrſte of al was Ladye Prudence
            Whyche is ſo ful of greate Scyence,
            And then Foly, which doth not her reſēble
            After that Temperaunce I dyd eſpye,
            wyth dyſtemperaunce, that her went by,
            Alſo I dyd behold Amours
            Whyche was clothed in foure colours,
            Then dyd I ſee Enuy that cruel maiſtres
            
               
Whyche wente nexte vnto Gladnes,
            Then folowed Heauynes full of Robery
            Making great argumēt with Mellācolly,
            Then noble Peace apered wt great ſolace
            which boldly chaſed Ire out of that place
            Then Chaſtytye me thought was in ſight
            Which againſt Lecherie ſtifly dyd fyght,
            Then Strength apered, & alſo Pacience
            Which betwene them had ſome difference
            Then dyd I ſee Suertye and alſo Feare,
            In greate dyfference, as they were,
            Then the Eunemye ful of Defame,
            After them Glotonye and Abſtynence
            Amongeſt whom was no dyfference,
            I ſawe then Conſtance that noble dame
            with Inconſtāce that is worthy of blame
            Then noble Courage with Vainglorye,
            Then dyd I ſee, I haue it in memorye,
            Alſo ther was Iuſtyce and Iniuſtyce,
            Thē ſelues beholding with great malice,
            And I did ſe Loyaltie and Falſhed,
            With lyeng and trueth in the laſt ſtede.
            ¶All that great companie I dyd ſe,
            In that ſame medowe as ſemyd me,
            Euerye one of them after ther nature
            Therfore I drewe me nere at auenture,
            For the better to vnderſtand their reaſon
            And vnder a buſhe, in that ſeaſon,
            preuelie me hyd, all thynges to marke,
            
               
whiche incontynent was in my hearte,
            Imprynted, and with that I did wake
            And pen and Inke then I did take,
            The ſayd vycyon trewly to wryte.
            And in ordre euery thyng to indyte,
            which in this booke ye may rede
            And it receiue if ye take hede,
            The ground therof is founde in Scyence,
            Therfore I pray you of pacyence
            And myne ignoraunce herein pardon,
            For I commyt al to iuſt correctyon
            Nowe no more in Ryme I wyll vſe
            Take thys wyth the faultes, & me excuſe.
            At the be gynnyng, and fyrſt of all
            Shalbe treated of prudēce the principall.
            Thus endeth the Prologue.

oughte to god to theyr good and
happy ende. And becauſe that the
ſprites, or ſoules of reaſonable creatures
be create by god, to his owne
ſemblaunce and lykenes, it is neceſſarye,
that he be adorned wyth
vertues, by the whyche they maye
come to the ende, for the whyche
they were made and create. Prudence
is mother and leader of al other
vertues, without the whyche
none of the other Vertues can be
well gouerned. And it is verye neſeſſarye
and conuenient, to the ſpyrytes
of reaſonable creatures to
haue Prudence, and be adorned of
the ſame. For Salamon ſaythe

hath to do, the good from the euyl,
& the truth from the falſehed. The
thirde is prouydence or prouyſion,
that is to ſay, for the time to come,
of that thinge that a man hath to

¶Ariſtotyle ſaythe that counſayle,Ariſtotyle.

from one thynge to another, dylygence,
is for to haue care and regarde

hath to doe. And theſe two Vertues
that is to ſay Dylygence and

And prouydynge for the time

the intente that it doe not burgen

and ſprynge.
            ¶Dauyd ſaythe that the begynnyngeDauid.
of Wyſdome is to feare and
dreade God.
            ¶Salamon ſayth that Wyſdome
is better and more worth,Salamon. then the
ryches of the worlde, for no ryches
maie be compared to ſaygenes and
Wyſdome.
            ¶Tulle ſaythe that the wyſe manTulle.
oughte neuer to ſaye I wolde not
haue thought it that ſuche a thing
ſhoulde haue chaunced ſo, for the
wyſe man dothe not doubte, but
hath alwaies a ſure truſt, and doth
prouyde for daungers to come.
            ¶Sydrac ſayth that good wynesSidrac.

foote in my graue, yet wolde I be

glad to learne Wyſdome.
            ¶Tulle ſaythe that he whiche is
wyſe,Tulle. can neuer lacke nor haue greate
nede, nor ſhall not ſuffre in any
maner. And ſaithe moreouer that
he is wyſe that knoweth him ſelfe.
            ¶Ariſtotyle ſaythe,Ariſtotyle. that the wyſe
man goeth alwayes armed in hys
thought & remēbraunce againſte euery
man. And ſaith alſo, yt he is a
fole that thinketh that fortune and
chaūce doth giue ether good or euil
but that wyſdome giue it.
            ¶Bracco ſaythe that the key of
Seuerytie is the thoughte.Bracco And
therfore the olde mynde and thoughte
cauſeth oft tymes to erre.
            ¶Alexandre ſayth,Alexandre. a yt man ought
to haue in his minde and remembraunce
in the nyghte, that thinge
that he muſte do in the daye.
            ¶Salamon ſayth,Salamon. do all thinges
by counſaile, and thou ſhalt not repente

thee therof.
            ¶Pythagoras ſayth that there is
no counſayle ſo good and faithfull,Pithagoras.
as is the counſaile whych is giuen
in the Sea, whyles a manne is in
daunger and perylll.
            ¶Socrates ſayth that a man gouerned
by the counſayle of yonge
folkes,Socrates. hath for the moſte part, euil
chaunce and fortune. And ſaith alſo
that there be iii. thinges contrary

haſtines, Ire, and couetouſnes.
            ¶Iuuenall ſaith,Iuuenall. do not ſhewe thy
mind and wil, but to him of whom
thou wilte aſke counſayle, for generallye
euery man doth counſayle yt
thing which he ſeith doth pleaſe.
            ¶Senec ſaythe,Senec when thou wylte
go to demaunde counſayle of anye
man, ſee fyrſte howe he dothe gouerne
hym ſelfe.
            ¶Plato ſaithe,Plato. that ſcyence without

regard and ſolycytude of experyence
is lytie worthe, of whom it
was demaunded howe and wherby
a wyſe man myght be knowen.
And he aunſwered that the wit of
man ſheweth it whē he hath great
& dyuers trybulacyons, and dothe
ouerpaſſe them mekely and in good
pacience. The good Maryner knoweth
hym ſelfe in fortūes, for euery
Maryner in a meeke and peaſable
tyme can ſaile & gouerne the ſhyp.
            ¶Alſo Plato ſaythe that the wyſePlato.
man doth know hym ſelfe when he
is not angry nor moued for no maner
of iniuryes done vnto hym, nor
when he dothe not gloryfye hym
ſelfe, to here and vnderſtande hym
lauded and prayſed, moreouer he
ſaythe that there be three thynges,
that maketh a man to bewiſe.
            ¶The Fyrſte is to reade manye
good Bookes. The Second, to go

into diuers Countreys, to heare
muche of the dedes of other men.
            ¶Iuuenall ſaythe,Iuuenall. thou haſte gotten
great dygnytie, if Prudence be
in thee, for he is verye happie that
can know the ende of cauſes.
            ¶Boecius ſayth,Boecius. that it is not ſuffyciente
to knowe the thynges as
a man dothe ſee them before hym,
but Prudence is that whych doth
meaſure the ende of all thynges, it
was demaunded of a wyſe man,
howe a man ſhoulde behaue hym
ſelfe, and what he ſhould doe, that
he ſhoulde not haue neede of anye
man. And he aunſwered that if a
man be ryche, let hym lyue meaſurablye,
and temperatelye. And if
he be pore, let him labour diligentlye.
And ſo he ſhall lyue withoute
daunger, for dyligence is the mother
of Rycheſſe. And ſaythe that
he oughte not to be called Ryche,

whych gathereth muche Rycheſſe
and gooddes togither, but he whiche
doth ſpende them with reaſon.
And ſaythe alſo that there is no
greatter Treaſoure in the worlde
then wyt and diſcrecyon.
            ¶Socrates ſaythe that Scyence
is gotten by dilygence of man,Socrates. but
Prudence and Wyſdome, is the
gyfte of God, and amongeſt all other
gyftes the moſte excellente.
            ¶Hermes ſaithe alſo that there is
no greater treaſure in this world,Hermes.
then wyt and diſcrecyon, nor greater
pouertye then ignoraunce, nor
better friendes then to haue good
cuſtome and maners. And ſaythe
alſo that when a man is olde, euerye
manne can dyſprayſe hys Vertues,
and note and marke hys Vyces.
And ſaythe moreouer that he
that wyll flye dyſhonour & ſhame
let hym flye and anoyde the occaſyons.Note.
               
Alſo he ſayth that the wyſe
man oughte not to remembre that
thing that he hath loſt, but ought
to thynke and remembre howe too
keepe ſurelye that thynge that he
hathe. There camme once a wyſe
man, (a kynſman of hys) and prayed
hym that it woulde pleaſe hym
to lende hym a certayne ſumme of
money: the which (wyſe man) aunſwered,
truelye my friende I ſhall
not be ſo euyll contente wyth thee,
if I doe not lende thee, as I ſhall
be if I lende thee, for afterward I
woulde recouer it of thee, and paraduenter
I can not.
            ¶Plato ſayth that Prudence and
wyſdome,Plato. dothe decorate and adorne
the rycheſſe of man. And ſaith
alſo that the Prudente and Wyſe
man, dothe not feare deathe, for
Prudence gouerneth hys vnderſtandynge,
hys tonge is the voyce

of trueth, hys hearte is good wyll,
pytie and mercye be hys armures.
And alſo to ſeeke the wyſe men, is
Wyſdome and Prudence, his power
and auctoryte is Iuſtyce, hys
reygne is meaſure, hys laude and
prayſe is peace, hys workes be ſaluacyon,
hys chyualrye or Knyghtehead
is the counſayle of wyſe men,
hys apparell is pacyence, hys treaſoure
is dyſcyplyne or doctrine, the
cōpany of good perſons is his loue.
And al his deſire is to flie from ſin,
and to ſerue God, and to haue hys
Faythe and truſte in him, for withoute
that, no man can pleaſe God.
As ſaythe Saynte Paule.
            Sine fine impoſſile eſt placere Deo.

of Prudence.
¶The thyrde Chapter.
            
               
OF the Vertue of Prudence,Example.
it is redde in the Hyſtories
of Rome, that on acertaine
daye the Emperoure of Rome dyd
ryde by a woode.Philoſopher And there dyd
fynde a Phyloſopher: the whyche
Phyloſopher the Emperoure cauſed
to be called, but no maner of
aunſwere he wold make. Then the
Emperoure him ſelfe did call him,
and yet for all that, nothynge wold
he aunſwere.Example. And themperoure ſeinge
that the wolde gyue no maner
of aunſwere, came to hym, and aſked
hym what he did. And the philoſopher
aunſwered, I learne wyſdome,
I praye thee (ſayde themperoure,
that thou wylte teache mee
ſome thynge therof. And then the
Phyloſopher did take pen, ink, and
paper, and wrote a litle Rolle conteyning
this ſentence.Sentē
                  ce. When thou
ſhalt enterpriſe to do any thinge: conſyder

and thynk in thy mind the ende,
that maye come of it.
            The Emperoure tooke thys wrytynge
and retourned againe to
hys palayſe at Rome. And cauſed
the ſayde wrytyng to be ſet vppon
the doore of hys preuye chambre.
So it chaūced afterward that
on a daye: certayne of the Barons
and Knyghtes of his Courte tooke
theyr counſayle togyther amongeſt
them,Example. that they wolde kyll the ſaid
Emperoure, (for a certaine occaſyon,
the whyche ſhoulde be to longe
to rehearſe.) And they were at a

                  〈◊〉
                wyth the Barber of the ſaid
Emperoure, and promyſed hym a
certaine ſūme of money, that when
he ſhoulde ſhaue the ſayde Emperour,
that he ſholde cut his throte.
And the ſaide Barons and Knightes,
promyſed alſo to conueye the
ſayde Emperour out of the Palice,.
And within ſhort ſpace after that

the ſayd Barber came to ſhaue the
Emperoure, and to doe that thing
that he had promyſed, (that is to
ſaye, to kyll hym. And dyd beholde
the wrytyng,Example. which was ſet aboue
the doore of the Preuye Chambre,
in the whyche was conteyned.
            When thou ſhalt enterpryſe to doe any
thynge:Sentē
                  ce. conſyore well in thy mynd
the ende that maye come of it.
            Whearewyth he me ruaylouſlye aſtoyned,
and began to waxe pale
in the vyſage.Example. And dyd tremble for
feare: the Emperoure ſeinge thys
meruayled greatlye what: ſhoulde
be the cauſe therof. And commaunded
his ſayd Barber to ſhewe him
the cauſe of hys feare. The ſaide
Barber was ſo troubled and abaſſhed
in hys mynde, that he coulde
geue no maner of aunſwere. Then
the Emperoure conſyderyng that
he cold not haue ſuch a great feare

without ſome maner of cauſe, dyd
examyne hym. And promyſed hym
that if he wolde tell the trueth, he
ſhulde haue no harme, but ſhulde
haue pardon, what cauſe ſoeuer if
were. And then the ſayde Barber

contrarye to the
Vertue of Prudence.
As Plato
ſaythe,Plato. of the
whyche Folye,
there is dyuers
and manye ſortes
and maners. There is Folie accuſtomed,
as thoſe perſons whiche
be Foles from theyr natyuitie and
byrthe. And other there be whyche
be lūatike or frantike for a certaine
ſpace. And yet there is another maner

of Folye whyche is leſſe then
the other aforeſaid, as of thoſe perſons
whiche haue loſte theyre wyt,The deuicion, of folie
And thys Folye maye be deuyded
in foure maners. The fyrſte is of
thoſe perſons which do not regard
not thinke buſelye vpon thoſe matters
that they haue to do, but do al
thinges at auenture withoute any
maner of conſyderacyon and reaſon.
The Seconde maner of Folie
is of them that doe not conſydre
norre gard the ende that mai come
of the matter, that they haue enterpryſed,
but do al thyngs ſodeinly,
as it commeth in theyre mynde
and wyll. The thyrd maner of Folye,
is to be to haſtye to doe that
thyng that a man hath to do. The
fourthe maner of Folie, is to be neclygent
and ſlothfull in that thinge
that a man hathe to doe, & to haue
no thoughte nor care for the ſame

but rather necligently to let it pas.
And can not find the maner to begin
any thing, And if another man
begin, yet can not be folowe, And if
a man doe purſue and folowe, yet
can not he find the maner to make
and ende, knowe ye that neclygence
is mother & nouriſhe of pouertye,
And ſo the man whiche is neclygent
may be reputed for a foole.
            ¶Salamon ſayth,Salamon. meddle not but
as lytle as thou may with a foole,
for he will not regard thy wordes,
except they be after his pleaſure.
            ¶Senec ſaith that a foole may be

heareth but vnderſtādeth not.
And ſayth that the fole lightly byleueth
the good yt a man ſpeketh of

the euyll ſpoken of another man.
And ſay the alſo that the wyſe man
doth folow ye domages & harmes,

And goeth not about to fynd them

And if a man geue him anie thinge
he wyll neuer thanke him for it if a
man tell him any ſecrete matter, he
will ſhowe it incontinente to another,
if he ſpeake he wyll be hard &
wyll haiſe audyence aboue all men.
            And if other men ſpeake he wyl,

is full of Ire, Melancholly and angrye

wythoute Reaſon, if a man
pray him to pardon and forgeue anie

hym ſelfe, to trueth in any maner
of thyng that doth pleaſe him,
he wyll prayſe it greatlye, but if it
be contrarye to hys pleaſure & will,

he will diſprayſe it. But the wyſe
man is of a contrarie oppinion, for
he hathe counteraunce in Iuſtyce,
Humylytie & pardon: he can ſpeake
well, and alſo hold his peace when

without any reproch he doth none
otherwyſe to anye man, but as he
wolde were done vnto him.
            If he be rich he wil neuer be ye prouder
therfore. If he be pore yet therfore
wil not he leaue and forſake to

And faith nothing but that

And thys loue dyſcendeth
by three occaſyons, whych moueth
the perſone to the ſame. The fyrſte
is for ſome goodneſſe that the perſon

hath or truſteth to haue of him
that he loueth. The Second is for
the good wyll and mynde that the
perſon hath vnto hys fryend in deſyryng
& wyſſhyng him good. The
Thyrde. is that he woulde be allwayes
as one wyth hys fryende, &
partaker wyth hym in al thynges,
for loue that he oweth vnto him.
And theſe three maners of loue be
verye good and vertuous.
            ¶Saynte Thomas ſaythe,Saint Thomas, that
thou maye keepe thy fryende three
maner of waye. The fyrſt is to loue
hym wyth all thy hearte, and that
he may knowe it. The ſecond is to
do all thynge to thy power, whych
thou knoweſt doth pleaſe him. And
the thyrde is to beware that thou
do no thynge that ſhall diſpleaſe
hym. And ſaythe alſo that by other
three meanes, thou maye kepe him
thy friende, that is to ſaye, to laude

and prayſe hym in his abſence: and
to helpe him at hys nede.
            ¶Salamon ſaythe,Salamon. that there is
nothyng to be compared to a faith

            ¶Aryſtotyle ſaythe,Ariſtotyle, that the more
dygnytie and honoure, or rycheſſe,
that a man hath, the more nede he
hathe of fryendes, for one good
thynge can not be alone, and with
out another.
            ¶And Salomon ſaythe,Salamon, there be
three thynges that be verye pleaſant
& acceptable bothe to god and
man that is to ſay, concorde & amitie
of bretherē, loue of neighbours.
and the loue of the man and his
wyfe, when they loue the on the other:

& ſaith that it is a ſoueraigne
goodneſſe & gyfte of God to haue a
good wife, he that chaūſeth to find
a good wife, he findeth great good
& welth. And he that forſaketh and
chaſeth from hym a good wyfe, he
chaſeth from him his welth & profyte.
And ſaith alſo yt a good wyfe
doth honoure the howſe & riches: &
an euil wife is diſtruction of al together
& the diſhonour of her huſbād.

good reaſons, wherfore a man
ought to honoure the women: and
accordynge to hys ſayenge, a man
ſhall not fynde one good woman
amongeſt a Thouſande. But I
beleue that he ſpeaketh thys, as
a man angrye and moued for one
woman whyche dyd deceyue hym.

For it is redde in the olde Teſtamente,
that the ſame Woman dyd
ſo muche to Salamon,Salamon. that for the
great loue that he had vnto her, ſhe
cauſed hym to forſake God, and to
worſhyppe Idolles. And ſhe dyd
leade hym ſo muche after her wyll,
that ſhe cauſed hym to be clothed,
and to weare Womans apparell,
ſhe cauſed hym to ſpynne, and
dyd ordre and leade hym after her
owne wyl, as if he had ben a chyld.
And theſe thynges whyth the woman
dyd vnto hym, he ſpeaketh euyl
of al other, ſayenge yt amongeſt
a thouſande women, a man ſhall
not fynde one good. And that the
iniquitie of the man is better, then

I haue ſayd afore, he ſpeaketh ther

commeth euyl. Yet it ſemeth to him
that loueth ſuch a thing, that ther

it is ſo that euery loue commeth by
ſome delectacion corporall or intellectuall.
The loue corporall cōmeth

The intellectuall loue cōmeth by ye

And the delecracion intelectuall is
much greater, then the corporall,
ſo that all the delyte of the loue of

that ſhe was verye well contente.Example.
And that incontynente ſhe
wolde fynde a pledge, wherof the
kyng meruailed greatly, for he had
thought, that there had ben neuer

ſende for a yonge man, which was
of an honeſt ſtocke, the whiche had
loued her perfytlye a longe tyme, &

whereof he was full hf Heauyneſſe,

And therupon he came to the Abbey

where this Nunne was. And
there dyd take her by Force and
Vyolence, intendynge to leade her
home wyth hym vnto hys Place.
And when this Nūne dyd ſe that
ſhe coulde not obtayne mercye and
grace of hym. And that there was
no remedye nor no help, and reſiſtenge
to be had, ſhe demaunded of

had ſuch fauoure and loue vnto her
more then to other? For there is
(ſayde ſhe,) manye better and fayrer

thys Noble man aunſwered her
ſayeng, I am ſo enamoured of you,
that it ſemeth me, that there is neuer
a Woman in thys world, that
hath ſo fayre Eyes as ye haue. And
that is the cauſe, that I haue ſuch
Loue vnto you. Wherfore purpoſe
youre ſelfe to come wyth me. And
then ſhe ſeinge, that there was no

remedye but that ſhe ſhoulde goo
wyth hym, ſhe deſyred hym that it
wolde pleaſe hym to lette her go in
to her Chambre to fetch certayne
ſtuffe that ſhe had there.Example, And that
ſhe wolde come to hym agayne incontynente,
thys noble man ſayde
go youre wayes and tarye not, for
here I wyl tarye for you. And then
ſhe wente into her Chambre and
wyth a knyfe dyd take bothe her
eyes oute of her heade. And thys
done, ſhe came out of her Chambre
all bloudye, and dyd preſente her
ſelfe as well as ſhe could afore this
Lorde, as ſhe had promyſed hym.
And when thys Lorde dyd ſee her
thus dyffygured, and that the eyes
were oute of her heade. He departed
from her, as a man out of hys

cōtinue ſtil in the Abbey, and was
better contente that ſhe had loſte

whyche Fortune dothe geue vs,
for it is great Folye to ſtriue againſte
it.
            ¶Salomon ſaythe,Salomen, that it is better
to be pacyent, then to be ſtrong,
for he that is Pacyente, gouerneth

hym ſelfe by greate wyſdome, as
Iob dyd, whyche had greate Pacyence
in all hys aduerſytyes. And
ſaythe that the ſtrongeſt man that

ſecrete hys pouertye.
            ¶Senec ſaythe,Senec that there is two
maner of Pacyence in this worlde,
the one is to ſuffre and endure Pacyentlye
the aduerſytyes and trybulacyons
that a man hath. The
other is, to refrayne, & to abſtayne
from hys deſyres and wyll. And

And what Feare is

Fearefull. And for
what cauſe.
¶The .xxviii. Chapter.
            
               
               FEare and Dread be
Vyces, contrarye to
Strength and Valliauntnes.
And they
be three maners, after
the ſayeng of Ptholome.Ptholome, The
Fyrſte is to be fearful in hys corage
wythoute anye occaſyon, but onely
by Imagynacion. And thys is properlye
called Feare. The Seconde
is to Feare and Dreade a thynge
more then nede is. And that is a
greate vilenes and ſhame. And the
Thyrde is, not to be able by Reaſon
of Febleneſſe of Corage, to ſuffre
aduerſytyes. And thys is called
Febleneſſe, whan the manne is vile
of hearte, which is to great a vyce.
Thys manne whyche is ſo vyle of
hearte, and ſo Fearefull, maye be

compared to the Hare, whyche is
the moſte Fearefull Beaſte of all other,
for the Hare hath the condicyon,
that when ſhe is layde in the
wode at her eaſe, if ſhe do but heare
the leaues of the trees ſhake, ſhe
dothe ronne awaye for Feare, manye
ther be that doe reſemble the
Hare in this maner, which hath ſo
vile and feble hearte, that for a lytle
or nothynge they be abaſſhed &
afrayde.
            ¶Salomon ſaythe that the one of
the cauſes whych cauſeth the man
to be feareful,Salomon, is the knowledg that
he hathe to be reproued of his euyll
workes.
            ¶Tulle ſaithe,Tulle, wilt thou be wythout
feare, do wel, and ſpeake but lytle.
And ſaithe that it is a more cruel
thing to feare death, then to die.
And that the remedy of a feble and
vyle hearte, is not to feare Death.
            
               
¶Cato ſaythe,Cato, doe not feare the
laſte ende of the Lyfe, for he that
dothe not regarde, but dyſpraiſeth
the ende of the lyfe, he feareth not
deathe.
            ¶Pythagoras ſaythe that deathe
can not be boughte,Pithagoras, nor no manne
oughte to feare it, but ſuch as haue
done muche iniquytye, and feareth
to be dampned for theyr Vyces after
theyr deathe. And ſaythe that
the doubte and feare of deathe, is
verye well manyfeſte, for by it is
made tranſmutacyon of the tranſytorye
and fynall worlde, to the euerlaſtynge
and perpetuall world.
Alſo of the worlde of Folye and vanytye,
to the world of Wiſdome
Truethe, and of Reaſon, of the
world of payne and loboure, to the
world of conſolacyon and of felycytie.
And ſaythe, that it is greate
meruayle of thoſe whych feare and

doubte death. And do alwaies contrarye
to theyr ſaluacyon. And ſaith,
that he whych lyueth well and
vertuouſlye in thys worlde, ought
to truſte to make his ende well.
            And ſaithe alſo that death is good
bothe to good and euyll men. To
the good men, to the intente that
they maye haue the rewarde of
theyr goodneſſe. And to the euyll,
that they maye commytte no more
ſynne, nor doe no more euxll to the
people, And ſaythe that it is better
dye, then lyue wyth ſhame. And
therfore he ſayd vnto a man which
dyd flye from the Battayle. Thou
doeſt euyll to flye from honorable
deathe, for to liue wyth rebuke and
ſhame.
            ¶Socrates ſayth,Socrates, that he dyd ſee
hys wyfe weepe, when he was taken
oute of Pryſon to be led to his
death. And he ſayd vnto her, wher

fore doeſte thou weepe myne owne
wyfe. And ſhe aunſwered, haue not
I a good cauſe to weepe, when I
ſee you ledde to deathe with great
wronge, and wythoute cauſe. And
then he aunſwered that the man
ought not to feare deathe, for there
is no maner of payne or bitterneſſe
in it, but the feare that a man hath
therof. A wyſe man beinge ſycke in
his bedde, cauſed hys Sonne to
come afore hym, that hee myghte
talke wyth hym of Deathe. And
ſayde vnto hym, my Sonne haue
abſtynence wyth thee, and refraine

worlde, and the dyuers chaunces
therof that euery day doth ronne &
happen in abſtraynge from thoſe
thynges which God hath prohibited,
thou ſhalte deſyre none other
thynge but death, Sone ſpeke allwayes
of God, and he ſhall put in

thy mouth good wordes. Sonne
doe not put thy loue in thys world,
for it is tranſytorye, and deceyueth
all thoſe whyche do put theyr truſt
in it. Sonne ſuffiſe thy ſelfe, and be
content with that thyng that god
hath geuen thee, And do not coueit
the goodes of other men. Sonne
vſe temperaūce in thy lyuyng. And
be conuerſaunte with wyſe folkes,
And ſo thou ſhalte gette wyſdome,
be meke humble, and be no mocker,
diſpraiſe no man, and do not ſpeake
to much, for I haue repent me more
for my large and to much ſpeaking,
then I haue for holdyng my peace,
or for lytle ſpeaking. Sonne I pray
the beware the cock do not wake erlier
in ye morning then thou, doubt
& feare god, & beware of vainglory,
if thou haue any ſcience, & do not beſtowe
it in good vſes, it ſhall do the
more domage & hurte then profyte.

Beware that thou ſpeake no vaine

prowde for anye maner of Ryches,
And doe not dyſpayre for any maner
of aduerſities that may chaūce

            ¶Socrates ſaythe that deathe
flyeth alwayes from hym,Socrates, whyche
doe not feare it. And is alwayes
nere to hym, whyche dothe feare
and doubte it. And ſaythe in another
place, that thyng whych thou

for Deathe hathe no mercye of the

            ¶Hermes ſayth,Hermes, that deathe is as
the ſtroake of an Arrowe, And the
lyfe of a man is in lyke caſe as the

ſtroke, whych tarieth a good ſpace
or it come. Againſt the feare to die,
ſyxe thynges doe aſſure vs. The
fyrſte is the death of the bodye, by
the whyche euerye man is ryghte
ſure to paſſe. The ſeconde is that
deathe maketh ende in all thinges
of thys worlde. The Thyrde is,
the neceſſytye to dye. The fourthe
is, that we ſee other dye afore vs.
The fyfthe is, that God hym ſelfe
dyd dye. The ſyxte is, euerlaſtinge

And there is

is of Folye, as he whyche goeth to
fyghte agaynſte hys Enemyes naked
wythout harneſſe, or he which
feareth not to ſleepe by venymous

to giue comforte, and reſyſte euyll

Againſte thys Vertue of

aunſwerethe, it is a naturall

There is nothynge that greueth,

Suertye aunſwereth, to delyuer

ſaythe, Death is not more greuous

Deathe is common as well

But I wyll that thou knowe, that

it ſhall not take me in olde age.

thou ſhalt not be buryed. Suertye
aunſwereth, I doe not care, for it
ſhalbe very ſmall domage vnto me,
when the perſon is dead, he careth
not what becommeth of the body,
whether it be brente or eaten with
wylde Beaſtes. I wyll that thou
knowe that the Sepulture or Buryeng,
was not founde to the vſage

there is no man poore, but ſuch as

            ¶Lucan ſayth,Lucan that feare of euyll

he is verye ſtronge that can ſuffre
fearefull and doubtfull things. For

tymes more feare in the minde and

that whereof he hathe feare
ſhall neuer come.
            Feare ſaythe, thou ſhalbe exyled &

that thou be a fryende to

if thou dyd leſe him. For in leſinge

thy fryend, thou ſhal purchaſe and
get manye enemyes. And thou oughte

haue, is to knowe howe to make of

to keepe thine owne, for it is better
to reſyſte and wythſtand theyr wil

not ſhowe hym thy ſecrete, for then
thou ſhould teache hym thy diſtruccyon.
            ¶Pythagoras ſaythe,Pythagoras, that if thou

it is no Vyce, to haue the wyl to be

The ſecond maner of Vaynglorye
is when a man doth vaunt,
boſte, and prayſe hym ſelfe for anye
maner of thynge, for it is a thynge
not ſemelye nor conuenyente for a
man to prayſe hym ſelfe. The third
maner of Vaynglorye is for a man

to ſhewe hym ſelfe Rycher, then he
is. And to ſhewe hymſelfe more vertuous
then he is, for it is Ipocryſe.
The vyce of Vaynglorye, maye be
compared to the Peycocke, whiche
is ſo full of Vaynglorye, that al his

meruayle greatly that ye haue ſtopped
your noſe for this fayre womā.
And dyd paſſe by the ſtynkyng caryon
that we dyd fynde, as ye dyd

¶The .xl. Chapter.
            
               OF Iuſtice it is red in the life
of Holye fathers,Example. that there
was an Hermyte whyche
long time had ſerued God and had
done greate penaunce for hys ſynnes,
to whom god ſent afterwarde
great ſickeneſſe. And bycauſe that
he could not recouer hys healthe a
gayn he began to complaine of god
and to murmure in hym ſelfe. So
it chaunced on a day, that the Aungell
of god appered vnto hym, in
lykeneſſe of a yonge man, and ſayd
vnto hym, come wyth me, for God
will that I doe ſhowe thee of hys
ſecrete Iuſtyce. And dyd leade him
into the Towne, to a Marchauntes
houſe, whyche had in a Coffre
a greate numbre of Florences.
            
               
And the Aungell in the ſyghte of
the Hermyte did take the ſame Florence,
and did beare them into the

founde in ſleepe, And the Aungell
dyd leue the ſayde Florence at hys
Chambre dore, to the intente that
when he ſhould open the dore, that
he ſhoulde fynde them. And thys
doone, he ledde hym to the houſe
of another Marchaunte that had
a chylde, the whyche chylde, the
Aungell dyd kyll, in the preſence of
the ſayde Heremite. And the, Heremyte
ſeinge all theſe thynges, thoughte
that the Aungell had ben a
Deuyll. And wolde fayne haue departed
from hym.Example. The Aungell ſeinge
that he woulde departe from
hym, ſayde voto hym, tarye yet a litle,
for I wyll ſhowe thee the reaſon,
wherfore I haue doone theſe
thinges in thy preſence, knowe firſt

wherfore that I haue take the Florence
from the burges, it is becauſe
that he had ſolde his Herytage,
for the ſayde Florences, and was
purpoſed to gyue them to certaine
Murtherers, whyche had promyſed
hym to kyll a man for hys ſake,
the whyche had dyſpleaſed hym aforetymes.Example
And the man which he
wolde haue cauſed to be kylled, is
a man of noble byrth, wherof ſhuld
haue come greate inconuenyence,
And therfore to reſyſt the euyl that
might haue cōe therof, & alſo to let
hym of hys euyll, and myſcheuous
wyll and purpoſe, I haue taken
the ſayde Florence from hym. And
when he ſhal ſee hym ſelfe pore & to
haue loſte hys Herytage and gooddes,
he wyll gyue hym ſelfe to the
ſeruice of god, and where he ſhulde
haue ben dampned, nowe he ſhalbe
ſaued. The Reaſon wherfore I

haue borne the Florence, to the
Chambre doore of the other man,
is becauſe that he was a Ryche
Marchaunte whyche came from
beyonde the Sea, and had beſtowed
in marchaundyce all the gooddes
that he had, and putte it in a
Shyppe, the whyche Shyppe did
peryſhe vpon the Sea, then he did
remembre one daye howe that he
had loſte all hys gooddes, and had
nothynge to lyue vppon, began to
fall in dyſpayre, and was purpoſed
to hange hym ſelfe. And therfore to
the intente that he ſhoulde not deſtroye,
bothe the bodye and the
ſoule. I dyd beare hym the foreſaid
Florences. The Reaſon whereof I
haue kylled the Chylde, is becauſe
that afore that the father had him
he was a very good man, and gaue
much Almous, and did many good

dedes, for the loue of god, and ſence
that he had the Chylde, he cared
for none other thynge, but onelye
to get Rycheſſe, were it by ryghte
or wronge. And therfore I haue
kylled the Chylde, to the intente
that the Father maye retourne to
hys purpoſe, doe not meruayle nor
grudge therfore, for the ſyckeneſſe
that thou haſte, for if it hadde not
bene, thou ſhoulde ofte tymes haue
thy mynde and Courage in Vanytyes
wherby thou ſhoulde greatlye
haue dyſpleaſed God. And be
thou ſure, that god doth nothyng,
but by Reaſon, but the perſones
haue not knowledge therof, for
God hathe not promyſed it them,
but of two euylles,Example he dothe allwayes
take the leſſe. Ann this ſaid
the Aungell dyd departe from the
Heremyte.
            
               
And from thenceforthe, the ſayde
Heremyte, dyd neuer murmure againſte
God, for anye maner ſyckeneſſe
or aduerſyty that he did ſend
him, but rather dyd thanke God.
And alwaies dyd reioyce hym ſelfe
in his ſicknes and aduerſyties conſyderynge

¶The .xlvi. Chapter.

Auſtyne ſaythe,S. Auſtine. is to
vſe Verytye or Trueth,
wythoute anye
ſhadowe or coloure of

of Truethe, maye be compared to
lytle yong Perdryches, for the Perdryche
is of ſuche nature. The one
wyll robbe the egges of the other.
And ſitte vpon them, as they were
her owne egges, but as ſone as the

lyfle Perdryches be brought forth.
And that they here theyr owne propre
mother crye and ſing, they leue
and forſake the olde Perdrych whiche
broughte them forthe of egges,
and go to their owne very mother.
And ſo it is of the vertue of trueth,
for the man dothe couer it ſo longe
as the contrari is not knowen and
perceyued, but at the ende truethe
doth alwayes abyde and contynue

            ¶Ariſtotile ſaith,Aryſtotyle, trueth doth help

that he wold ſend them to be ſolde
by the ſayd new religyous man, for
he thoughte that he had the practyſe
therof. And that afterward he
wolde die other, that ſhulde be yonger,
this knight did take the charg
of them, albeit parthe againſt hys
will. And did not deny it, by reaſon
of obedience, he beinge in the market,

wyth one of the lay brethren of
the ſayd Abbey, whych led the ſaid
Aſſes, when it was demaunded of

think you that if they were
good, that our father Abbot wold
ſell them. The other demaunded of
hym, wherfore theyr tayles were ſo
pylled, he aunſwered, they be very
olde, and doe fall many tymes in
the myre. And when a man wyl lift
them vp, he muſte take them by the
tayles, and that is the cauſe that
they haue theyre tayles ſoo pylled
wherfore they coulde not ſell theyr
Aſſes, but broughte them home agayne.
The Abbot dyd demaunde
of the laye brother, howe it chaunced
that they had not ſold theyr Aſſes.Example
And he ſhowed hym the cauſe.
Then the Abbot cauſed thys relygyous

for that whiche

then a man may beare, it is not Liberlytye,

It is redde in the Summe of Vyces,
that Prodygalytye is to ſpend

And therfore in the Lawe, the

whyche is to gyue, then dothe Coueytouſneſſe,
which is to hold. The
ſecond is, yt the prodigall perſon is
more profytable to other, then the
Coueytous Perſon is. The thyrde

reaſon is, that the Prodygal perſon
dothe ſooner amende and forſake

any Lorde or Captaine ſent by the
Romaines to conquere anye countrey.
And if he retourned to Rome
with victorie, the Romaines made
him. iii. honours. &. iii. diſhonours.
The firſte honour was, that al the
people of the Cytie, ſhoulde go to
mete hym and receyue hym.
            The ſeconde was, that he was ſet
vpon a Charet drawen wyth foure
whyte horſes. And all the people about
him, bringing him into Rome
wyth Candles and Torches brennynge.
            The third was that al the princes
that he had conquered, did come after
him, behind the Charet.
            
               
The fyrſte dyſhonoure was, that
there was ſytte wyth hym in the
Charet, the moſte vyle and wretched

in all the Cytye, whyche was done
to gyue example to other, to come

The thirde is Ingratytude, as not
