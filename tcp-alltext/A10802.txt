            Wherein sundry Propositions are laid downe, plainely discouering the wickednesse of that damnable Art, with diuerse other speciall points annexed, not impertinent to the same, such as ought diligently of euery Christian to be considered.
            
               With a true Narration of the Witchcrafts which Mary Smith, wife of Henry Smith Glouer, did practise: Other contract vocally made between the Deuill and her, in solemne termes, by whose meanes she hurt sundry persons whom she enuied: Which is confirmed by her owne confession, and also from the publique Records of the Examination of diuerse vpon their oathes: And Lastly, of her death and execution, for the same; which was on the twelfth day of Ianuarie last past.

               Right Worshipfull:
            
            
               IN these last dayes, and perillous times, among the rest of those dreadfull euills, which are fore-told should abound in them, a close & disguised 2. Timoth. 3. 5. contempt of religion may be iustly accounted as chiefe, which causeth and bringeth vpon men all disastrous effects, when although it be shadowed with a beautifull Maske of holines, faire tongued: yet false-harted, Titus 1. 16. 
               professing they know God, but in works deny him. And among these there be two especiall sorts; the one, who entertaining a stubborne, and curious rash boldnes, striue by the iudgemēt of reason, to search ouer-deeply into the knowledge of those things which are farre aboue the reach of any humane capacitie. And so making shipwracke in this deep and vnsoundable Sea, ouerwhelme themselues in the gulfe thereof. The other kind is more sottish, dull, and of a slow wit,

and therefore ouer-credulous, beleeuing eueri

                thing, especially when they be carried by the violent tempest of their desires, and other vngouerned affections; and among these the diuell vsually spreadeth his netts, as assured of a prey, wayting closely if hee can espie any, who either grow discontented and desperate, through want and pouerty, or be exasperated with a wrathfull and vnruly passion of reuenge, or transported by vnsatiable loue to obtaine some thing they desire; and these hee taking aduantage, assaulteth with golden and glorious promises, to performe vnto them the wishes of their owne hearts; the drift whereof is (hee being as at the first incased in a subtile Serpents skinne) onely to enthrall and invassall them slaues to himselfe. The first of these mentioned, are slie and masked Atheists, who ouer-shadow their secret impiety, loose and dissolute behauiour with some outward conformitie and shew of religion, snatching (as they thinke) a sufficient warrantize thereof from those disorders they obserue among men, and therfore passe vncensured, hauing a ciuill, but dissembled carriage. The second be Sorcerers, Wisards, Witches, and the rest of that ranke and kindred: no small multitude swarming now in the world, yet supposed of many, rather worthy pitty then punishment, as deluded by fantasies, and mis-led, not effecting those harmes wherewith they bee charged, or themselues acknowledge. But considering they be ioyned and linked together with Satan in a league (the common and professed enemy

of mankinde) and by his helpe performe many subtile mischieuous actions, and hurtfull designes, it is strange that from so great a smoake arising, they neither descrie nor feare some fire. And therefore, in respect of these, I haue at your appointment and request (for whom I am most willing to bestow my best labours and euer shall be) penned this small Treatise, occasioned by the detection of a late witch among you, whose irreligious care, and vnwearied industry, is not to be defrauded of deserued commendation, and by mature deliberation, and discreete search, found out her irreligious and impious demeanour, and also discouered sundry her vnnaturall and inhumane mischiefes done to others, whereof being conuicted, she was accordingly sentenced, and did vndergoe the penalty iustly appointed, and due by Law vnto malefactors of that kinde. After all which, you kindled with a holy zeale of the aduauncement of Gods glorie, and giuing satisfaction to euery one howsoeuer affected, intermitted no meanes, vsing therein the labour of your carefull Ministers (willingly offering themselues in this holy seruice) whereby she might be broght (as one conuerted in the last houre) to the sight & acknowledgement of her heinous sins in generall, & particularly of that of witchcraft, confessing the same, & by true repentance, and embracing of the tender mercies of God in Christ Iesus saue her soule (who refuseth no true and vnfained conuert at any time.) And hee gratiously blessing these religious endeuor, of yours, vouchsafed

to second the same with a happy and wished for euent, which (as I hope) shall appeare manifestly in the following Treatise vnto all those who are not fondly, & without cause, too much wedded to their owne conceits: And thus, desiring GOD most humbly to confirme and strengthen you in his truth, which euer you have loued, and is your due praise, and shall be at the last an honour vnto you: I rest

            To the Reader.
            
               CHristian Reader, I haue vpon occasion penned this short discourse, and that of such a subiect wherewith not being well acquainted, am enforced to craue some direction from those, whose names you shall finde remembred in the same: (that I be not vnthankefull vnto those from whom I receiue instruction) and haue in former time, and latter dayes, taken paines in searching out, both the speculatiue, and practique parts of this damnable Art of Witchcraft, a dangerous and seducing inuention of Sathan, who from the Arcenals, and Magisins store-houses of his ancient and mischieuous furniture, hath not spared to affoord all helpe, and the best Engines for the subuerting of soules, pliable to his allurements: and to this end, beside a plaine narration of fact in this case committed and confessed, (least the Treatise should be too bare and naked) I haue added thereunto a few Propositions, agreeing to such a subiect matter, manifesting some speciall poynts not altogether importinent in my opinion, nor vnworthy of due consideration: I know mine owne wants, and do as willingly acknowledge them: One more experienced, and of greater leasure, and better health, had beene fitter for the opening and discouering of so deepe a mystery, and hidden secret of Iniquity, as this is; and haply hereafter may be willing to take that taske in hand: yet herein thou shalt find

in this relation we do speake, hath of her owne accord, and voluntarily acknowledged after conference had withme, and sundry learned and reuerend Diuines, who both prayed for her conuersion, carefully instructed her in the way to saluation, and hopefully rescued her from the Diuell, (to whom she was deuoted, and by him seduced) and regained her to God from whom she was departed by Apostac

            And of these in the day of execution (which she in no wise would condiscend vnto should be deferred, though offered repriuall vpon hope that more might haue beene acknowledged) being very distemperate, neuerthelesse some accompanied her to the place, and were both eye and care-witnesses of her behauiour there, seeing and hearing how she did then particularly confesse her confederacy with the Diuell, cursing, banning, and enuy towards her neighbours, and hurts done to them, expressing euery one by name, so many as be in the following discourse, nominated, and how she craued mercy of God, and pardon for her offences, with other more specialties afterward expressed.

Yet by the way, and their good leaue, who take vpon them this Apology, all who are conuented vpon these vnlawfull action, are not strucken in yeares; but some euen in the flower of their youth be nuzled vp in the same, and convicted to be practisers thereof; neither be they ouerflowed with a blacke melancholique humor, dazeling the phantasie, but

haue their vnderstandings cleere, and wits as quicke as other: Neither yet be they all women, though for the most part that sexe be inclinable thereunto: (as shall afterward be shewed, and the causes thereof) but men also on whose behalfe no exception can be laid, why any should demurre either of their offence or punishment for the same.

Secondly, he determineth vtterly to destroy all such, and giueth his people the Israelites an example thereof in the Canaanites, whom their Land spewed out. Thirdly, for that he requireth all who belong vnto him, to be pure, vndefiled and holy,

not stained with impieties, for they are bound vnto him by couenant in obedience. Fourthly, such were the Heathen, strangers from God, blinded in their dark vnderstanding, without sauing knowledge, with whom the Israelites, a chosen and peculiar nation, enioying his lawes and statutes, must haue no familiarity. Further, the woman of Endor acknowledgeth herselfe to be one of the rank. 1. Sam. 28. 9. And Iesabel, mother of Iehoram, is in plaine tearmes stiled a Witch. 2.

Insomuch that it was rise in common speech, when any would reproach another, to doe the same in this forme; Thou art a Samaritan, and hast a Diuell (a familiar spirit) which the malicious Iewes, not abiding his heauenly and gracious doctrine, obiected to Christ Iesus our blessed Sauiour, Ioh. 8. 48. The holy Apostle reprouing the Galatbians for their sudden Apostasie and back-sliding from the Gospell so powerfully preached vnto them and with so great euidence of the spirit, as though Christ had bin crucified before their eyes, doth it in no other termes then these, Who hath bewitched you? Gal. 3. 1. And afterward, Cap. 5. 20. marshalleth Witch-craft among the workes of the flesh: In both which places the names are taken from the seducements and illusions of Inchanters, who astonish the mindes, and deceiue the senses of men, and all that by vertue of a contract passed betweene them and the Diuell. Other like proofes

may be added to these alledged, Leuit. 20. 6. Micalo 5. 12. Nahum 3. 4. Now then when God affirmeth there be such, whose words are truth, shall man dare once to open his mouth, and contradict the most righteous?

Cor. 6. 14. For righteousnesse hath no fellowship with vnrighteousnesse, neither is there communion of light with darknesse, nor concord with Christ and Belial, nor the beleeuer can haue part with an Infidell.

the World, cloathed in the cloud of our flesh, which he assumed then, suffered many to be really possessed of Diuels, to bee lunatique, deafe, dumbe, blinde, &c. whom he might deliuer from these torments, and so make apparant his glory, and shew by these his miracles wrought, that hee was the promised Messias, Esay 35. 5. 6.

Cor. 5. 5. And in this sort he speaketh of two other deceiuers and blasphemers, Hymenaeus and Alexander, I haue deliuered

               The last poynt propounded, was, That witches haue power granted to vex Gods owne children aswell as others, and preuaile ouer them; and that we doe enquire (so farre as we may, and is iustifiable) of the causes thereof, which may be these.

To be quiet and patient in prosperity, when we may enioy benefites at our owne pleasure, is a matter easily to be performed: But to endure the fire of Tribulation, that is the proofe of a stedfast Christian, and in losses and sickenesse procured by such to bee silent, and submit our selues, this is the note of a faithfull man, & to choose rather obeying the law of God, to beare the infirmity of the body, then to ouer-flow in riches, and enioying health and strength offend the Lord.
               Second, this maketh a difference betweene the wicked and the godly: for thus the holy Apostle speaketh of the righteous, that by many afflictions they must enter into the kingdome of heauen, Act. 14. 22. And all that will liue godly in Christ Iesus suffer tribulations, 2. Timoth. 3. 12. for whom the Lord loueth, he doth chasten, Prouer. 3. 12.

But wee reade contrary of the wicked, they become olde, yea, are mighty in power, their seede is established in their sight with them, and their of-spring before their eyes, their houses are safe from feare, neyther is the rod of God vpon them, &c. they spend their dayes in wealth, and in a moment go downe into the graue, Iob 21. 7. 8. 9. &c.

As the Lady of Rome, who was importune, and vehemently instant vpon her husband, to know what was debated of that day at the Councell Table. And when he could not be at rest, answered, The Priests had seene a Larke flying in the aire with a golden Helmet on his head, and holding a speare in his foot. Scarce she had this, but presently she told it to one of her maids: she to another of her fellowes, so that report was spread through the whole Citie, and went for currant vntill it receiued a checke: But all are not of this mould.
               Thirdly, their complection is softer, and from hence more easily receiue the impressions offered by the Diuell; as when they be instructed and gouerned

by good Angels, they proue exceeding religious, and extraordinarily deuout: so consenting to the suggestions of euill spirits, become notoriously wicked, so that there is no mischiefe aboue that of a woman, Eccles. 25. 13. &c.

               Fifthly, this sex, when it conceiueth wrath or hatred against any, is vnplacable, possessed with vnsatiable desire of reuenge, and transported with appetite to right (as they thinke) the wrongs offered vnto them: and when their power herein answereth not their will, and are meditating with themselues how to effect their mischieuous proiects and designes, the Diuell Exemplum apud Binfeldium reperies de consessionibus maleficorum, pag. 32 taketh the occasion, who knoweth in what manner to content exulcerated mindes, windeth himselfe into their hearts, offereth to teach them the meanes by which they may bring to passe that rancor which was nourished in their breasts, and offereth his helpe and furtherance herein.
               Sixthly, they are of a slippery tongue, and full of words: and therefore if they know any such wicked practises, are not able to hold them, but commnnicate the same with their husbands, children, consorts, and inward acquaintance; who not consideratly weighing what the issue and end thereof may be, entertaine the same, and so the poyson is dispersed.

                  ¶ Her wicked practise against Iohn Orkton.
                  THe first who tasted of the gall of her bitternes was Iohn Orkton a Sailer, and a man of strong constitution of body, who about some fiue yeares sithence, returning out of Holland in the Netherland, or low Countries beyond the Seas, happened, for some misdemeanors committed by him to strike the sonne of this Mary Smith (but in such sort as could not in reason bee offensiuely taken) who hearing his complaint, came foorth into the streete, cursing and banning him therefore, as oftentimès shee did, dwelling in the next adioyning house, and wished in a most earnest and bitter manner, that his fingers might rotte off; wherevpon presently hee grew weake, distempered in stomacke, and could digest no meate, nor other nourishment receiued, and this discrasie or feeblenesse continued for the space of three quarters of a yeare; which time expired, the fore-mentioned griefe fel downe from the stomacke into his hands and feete, so that his fingers did corrupt, and were cut off; as also his toes putrisied & consumed in a very strange and admirable manner. Neuerthelesse, notwithstanding these calamities, so long as hee was able, went still to Sea, in the goods and shippes of sundry Merchants (for it

was his onely meanes of liuing) but neuer could make any prosperous voyage (as then other men did) eyther beneficiall to the Owners, or profitable to him selfe. Whereupon, not willing to bee hindrance to others, and procure no good for his owne maintenance by his labours, left that trade of life, and kept home, where his former griefe encreasing, sought to obtaine help and remedie by Chirurgery, and for this end went to Yarmouth, hoping to be cured by one there, who was accompted very skilfull: but no medicines applyed by the Rules of Arte and Experience, wrought any expected or hoped for effect: for both his hands and feete, which seemed in some measure euery euening to be healing, in the morning were found to haue gone backeward, and growne far worse then before: So that the Chirurgian perceiuing his labour to bee wholly frustrate, gaue ouer the cure, and the diseased patient still continueth in a most distressed and miserable estate, vnto the which hee was brought by the hellish practises of this malitious woman, who long before openly in the streetes, (whenas yet the neighbours knew of no such thing) reioycing at the calamity, said, Orkton now lyeth a rotting. And no maruell though she could tell that which herselfe had done, and her good maister would not suffer to be concealed, but that the testimony of her owne tongue should remayne as a record towardes her further detection and condemnation, who sought meanes of her voluntary accord to be reconciled with the wofull distressed

party, but this was nothing else but to plaister ouer and disguise her former inhumane and barbarous actions, for no reliefe at all followed thereof: for oftentimes, as hath beene prooued, the Propositiō 3. diuells and witches his instruments doe cause such diseases, which neyther the one, nor the other can remoue againe. And this is not any vaporous imagination, but a most vndoubted trueth. For now this poore man continueth still in a lamentable estate, griefe, and paines encreasing, without hope of helpe, except God in the abundance of his tender mercies vouchsafe to grant comfort and deliuerance.
               
               
                  ¶ Her wicked practise against Elizabeth Hancocke.
                  THe second person distressed, by this witch, was Elizabeth Hancocke, then widdow, now wife of Iames Scot: the maner, occasion, and proceeding of whose dealing against her was thus. She comming out of the towne from the shoppe of one Simon Browne a Silkeman, vnto whom she had carried home some worke, which was by him put out vnto her; Henry Smith, as shee passed by his doore, tooke her by the hand, and smilingly said, that his ducke (meaning his wife, this woman of whom we now speake) tolde him that shee had stolne her henne; which wordes shee then passed

ouer, as onely spoken in merriment, and denying the same: in the meane time, as they were interchanging these words, shee came herselfe, and directly charged her with the henne, and wished that the bones thereof might sticke in her throat, when she should eate the same: which speech also she made no great reckoning of, supposing them to be but words of course, and might bee vttered in jeast. Neuerthelesse, afterward better considering of the same, conceiued much griefe, to bee counted one of so euill quality and disposition, and espying that hen for which she was accused, to sit vpon the hatch of her shoppe doore, went to her, and mooued with the indignity of that slaunder, and vniust imputation, told her in some passion and angry manner, that it was a dishonest part thus to blemish the good name of her neighbors with so vntrue aspersions: whereupon, breaking foorth in some violence, she wished the pox to light vpon her, and named her prowde

                        inny, prowde flurts, and shaking the hand, bade her go in, for she should repent it; and the same night, within three or foure houres after these curses and imprecations vttered, she was taken and pinched at the heart, and felt a sodaine weaknesse in all the parts of her body; yet her appetite to meate nothing diminished, and so continued for the space of three weekes; in which time, when she was any thing well, would come to the doore, and leane vpon the stall, whom this Marie Smith seeing, did euerbanne, adding the former curse, the poxe light vpon you, can you yet come to the doore?

and at the end of these three weekes, beeing but very weake, came soorth as shee vsed to doe, to take the ayre, this mischieuous woman most bitterly cursed her againe, whereupon she went into the house, fell into such a torturing fit, and nipping at the heart, that she fainted, hardly recouerable for the space of halfe an houre, and so grieuously racked and tormented through all parts of her body, as if the very flesh had beene torne from the bones, by the violent paine whereof she could not refraine, but tore the haire from off her head, and became as one distraught, bereaued of sence, and vnderstanding: And the same night the bed whereon she lay, was so tossed, and lifted vp and downe, both in her owne feeling, and in the sight of others then present beholders of her extreamities, by the space of one houre or more, that she was therewith exceedingly terrified, & did thinke oftentimes in her sleepe, that she did see this Marie Smith standing before her. And this sit continued sixteene houres, during which passion Edward Drake her father came to the Towne, touched with griefe for this torture of his daughter (as parents hearts are relenting and tender, and naturall compassion is soone stirred vp in them) tooke her vrine, went to one for his aduice (whose fact herein is no way instifiable, and argued but a small measure of religion, and the knowledge of God in him) who first tolde vnto him the cause of his comming, that is, to seeke help for his daughter, and then added, that she was so farre spent, that if hee had stayed but one day longer, the woman

who had wrongd her, would haue spent her heart, and so become vnrecouerable, and thereupon shewed him her face in a Glasse; and further, opened the beginning cause of falling out, which was for a hen, which before this, Drake neyther knew nor heard of, and then gaue his counsell for remedy, which was the matter sought for & desired, & that was in this order. To make a cake with flower from the Bakers, & to mix the same instead of other liquor, with her own water, and bake it on the harth, wherof the one halfe was to be applyed and laid to the region of the heart, the other halfe to the back directly opposit; & further, gaue a box of ointment like triacle, which must be spread vpon that cake, and a powder to be cast vpon the same, and certaine words written in a paper, to be layd on likewise with the other, adding this caueat, that if his daughter did not amend within six houres after the taking of these receits, then there was no health or recouery to be looked for: & further, wished silence to be kept herein, for the womā who had done this, would know any thing.
                  And being thus furnishing with instructions, and returning home, as hee alighted from his horse to enter into that house where his daughter lay (being the next vnto Mary Smiths) shee then stood leaning ouer her shop window, whom hee knew to be that person, which was shewed vnto him, and she cursed him passing by, and told his daughter that her Father had beene with a Wisard. And the next day following after they had put in practise the directions giuen, she affirmed

to diuers of the neighbours, that Drake the afflicted womans father, had beene to aske counsell, and made a Witch Cake, but shee would learne how they came to haue that knowledge: yet for the present she found helpe, and was freed from the languishing and other conflicts wherewith she was assaulted by the space of sixe weekes.
                  After this, being married vnto Iames Scot, a great Cat which kept with this Witch (of whose infernall both purposes and practises wee now speake) frequented their house; and vpon doing some scathe, her husband moued therwith, thrust it twice through with his sword: which notwithstanding those wounds receiued, ran away: then he stroke it with all his force vpon the head with a great pike staffe, yet could not kill her; but shee leapt after this vpward almost a yard from the boords of that chamber where she now was, and crept downe: which hee perceiuing, willed his lad (a boy of foureteene yeares) to dragge her to the muck-hill, but was not able; and therefore put her into a sacke, and being in the same, still moued and stirred. Whereupon they put her out againe, and cast her vnder a paire of staires, purposing in the morning, to get more helpe, and carry her away; but then could not be found, though all the doores that night were locked, and neuer heard what afterward became thereof.
                  Not long after, this Witch came-forth with a Birchin broome, and threatned to lay it vpon the head of Elizabeth Scot, and defiled her cloathes therewith, as she swept the street before her shop

doore, and that in the sight of her husband, who not digesting this indignity offered vnto his wife, threatned that if she had any such fits, as she endured being a Widow before marriage, hee would hang her. At this she clapped her hands, and said hee killed her Cat. And within two or three dayes after this enterchange of words betweene them, his wife was perplexed with the like paine and griefe at her heart, as formerly she had beene; and that for two dayes and a night: wherefore her husband went to this wrathfull and malicious person, assuring that if his wife did not amend, hee would accuse her to the Magistrate, and cause the Witches can by no meanes bee so easily brought to to recall the mischiefe they haue done, as by threats and stripes.

downe and abated. And the next night being Sunday immediatly following, a Cat came vnto her, sate vpon her breast, with which she was grieuously tormented, and so oppressed, that she could not without great difficulty draw her breath, and at the same instant did perfectly see the said Mary in the chamber where she lay, who (as she conceiued) set that Cat vpon her, and immediatl after fell sicke, languished, and grew exceeding leane; and so continued for the space of halfe a yeare together, during the whole continuance in her maisters seruice; vntill departing from him, she dwelt with one Mistres Garoway, and then began to bee amended in her health, and recouer of her former pining sicknesse: for this Witch had said, that so long as she dwelt neere her, she should not be well, but grow from euill to worse.
                  Thus euery light trifle (for what can bee lesse then sweeping of a little dust awry?) can minister matter to set on fire a wrathfull indignation, and inflame it vnto desired reuenge, the Diuell being willing to apprehend and take hold vpon such an occasiō, that so he might do some pleasing office his bond-slaue, whom she adored in submisse maner, vpon her knees, with strange gestures, vttering many murmuring, broken, and imperfect speeches, as this Cicely did both heare and see, there being no other partition between the chamber wherein shee performed these rites, and the house of her maister with whom she then dwelt, but only a thin feeling of boord, through a cranny or rift whereof she looked, listned attentiuely

                  Her wicked practise against Edmund Newton.
                  THe fourth on dammaged by this Hagge, was one Edmund Newton: the discontentment did arise from this ground; Because hee had bought seuerall bargaines of Holland cheese, and sold them againe, by which she thought her benef

At euery seuerall time of buying Cheese he was grieuously afflicted, being thrice, and at the last, either she or a spirit in her likenesse did appeare vnto him, and whisked about his face (as he lay in bed) a wet cloath of very loathsome sauour; after which hee did see one cloathed in russet with a little bush beard, who told him hee was sent to looke vpon his sore legge, and would heale it; but rising to shew the same, perceiuing hee had clouen feet, refused that offer, who then (these being no vaine conceits, or phantasies, but well aduised and diligently considered

sent her Impes, a Toad, and Crabs crawling about the house, which was a shoppe planchered with boords, where his seruants (hee being a Shooemaker) did worke: one of which tooke that toad, put it into the fire, where it made a groaning noyse for one quarter of an houre before it was consumed; during which time Mary Smith who sent it, did endure, (as was reported) torturing paines, testifying the felt griefe by her out-cryes then made.
                  The sicknesse which he first sustained, was in manner of a madnesse or phrensie, yet with some interposed release of extremity: so that for thirteene or foureteene weekes together hee would be of perfect memory, other times distracted and depriued of all sence. Also the ioynts and parts of his body were benummed, besides other pains and greifes from which hee is not yet freed, but continueth in great weakenesse, disabled to performe any labour, whereby hee may get sufficient and competent maintenance. And by the councel of some, sending for this woman by whom hee was wronged, that he might scratch her (for this hath gone as currant, and may plead prescription for warrant a foule sinne among Christians to thinke one Witch-craft can driue out another) his nailes turned like feathers, hauing no strength to lay his hands vpon her.
                  And it is not improbable but that she had dealt no better with others then these aboue mentioned. For Mr 
                     Thomas Yonges of London, Fishmonger, reported vnto me, that after the demand of

a debt due vnto Mr 
                     Iohn Mason, Silkeman of the same Citie, whose Widow hee married, from Henry Smith Glouer her husband, some execrations and curses being wished vnto him, within three or foure dayes (being then gone to Yarmouth in Norfolke vpon necessary businesse) there fell sicke, and was tortured with exceeding and massacring griefes, which by no meanes (hauing vsed the aduise of sundry learned and experienced Physitians in Norwich) could in any part be mitigated, and so extraordinarily vexed thirteene moneths, was constrained to go on Crutches, not being able to feed himselfe, and amended not before this mischieuous woman was committed to prison (accused for other wickednesses of the like kinde) at which time (so neere as he could coniecture) he then receiued some release of his former paines, though at the present when hee made this relation, which was at Candlemas last past, had not perfectly recouered his wonted strength: for his left hand remained lame, and without vse.
                  But thus much by the way onely, omitting how before this accident a great Water-dogge ranne ouer his bed, the doore of the chamber where he lay being shut, no such one knowne (for carefull enquiry was made) either to haue been in that house where hee lodged, or in the whole Towne at any time.
                  I doe not insist vpon this, because shee did not nominate him or any other vnto vs, but onely those foure already expressed: and for the wrongs

done to them, she craued mercy at Gods hands, as for all other her sins, and in particular for that of Witch-craft, renounced the Diuell, embraced the mercies of God purchased by the obedience of Iesus Christ, and professed that her hope was onely by his suffering and passion to bee saued. And all these, that is to say, her former grieuous offences committed against God, and his people, her d

And made there also profession of her faith, and hope of a better life hereafter; and the meanes whereby she trusted to obtaine the same, as before, hath beene specified. And being asked, if she would be contented to haue a Psalme sung, answered willingly that she desired the same, and appointed it herselfe, The Lamentation of a Sinner, whose beginning is, Lord turne not away thy face, &c. And after the ending thereof thus finished her life: So that in the iudgement of charity we are to conceiue the best, and thinke shee resteth in peace, notwithstanding her heynous transgressions formerly committed: for there is no maladay incurable to the Almighty Physitian, Esay 1. 18.

and grosse abuses, both of God, and Men his creatures, I will giue you a taste of one or two, whereby you may iudge of the rest, for they came all out of one shoppe, and are fashioned in one forge, and haue the same workman or Artificer.

Another tied a scroule to a sicke man, full of strange Characters, with which were intermingled a few names of Diuels, as Lucifer, Sathan, Belzebub, Oriens, Behal, Mammon, Beuflar, Narthin, Oleasar, &c. and other of this sort; but what manner of blessing this was, and how likely to be medicinable, a Christian truely instructed in Gods word knoweth; and the Lord who is the father of mercies, and God of all comfort, preserue vs from such blasphemies, which are the Diuels Sacrifices.

These vanities doe separate and with draw vs from God, though they may seeme to haue something in them to allure and delight vs; yet let no Christian entertaine them, whose hope ought to be setled in God alone. And if thou be in distresse, or afflicted with sicknesse of body, and feele no present release or comfort, what then? here is the tryall of thy patience, haue not recourse to superstitious and vnlawfull helpers, although they promise thee present remedy; and when they fore-tell thee of things which doe truely according to the prediction so fall out, beleeue them not, follow the example of Christ, who rebuked the Diuell, though he called him (as he was indeed) the Son of God. For vnder the vaile of truth he shadoweth falshood; euen as if one should sweeten with honey or sugar the brimme of the Cup wherein he bringeth poyson: But some will say, they call vpon the name of the Lord of Sabbaoth. Well, but this title they giue not to God, but to the Diuell: therefore betake thou thy selfe to God alone, craue health at his hand, and follow the Apostles direction; If any bee sicke among you, let him call for the Elders of the Church, and let him pray, Iames 5. 14.

The cause of this so sharpe a doome, is their compacting with the Diuell, openly or secretly, whereby they couenant to vse his helpe, in fulfilling their desires, and by this meanes make themselues guilty of horrible impiety: for in this they renounce the Lord, who hath created them; make no account of his fauour and protection, cut themselues off from the couenant made with him in baptisme, from the communion of Saints, the true fellowship and seruice of God; and on the contrary yeeld themselues by this confederacy, to Sathan, as their God (and therefore nothing more frequent and vsuall in their mouthes, then my God will do this and that for me) him they continually feare and honour. And thus do at the last become professed enemies both to God and Man. You may adde to this forther

               Secondly, the ciuill lawes in this case are most strict, decreeing them to bee burned, and their goods confiscate, though they were persons of quality, and honourable, seated in dignity, and place of authority: and there is a seuere constitution made by Charles the fift in late dayes against them, that though they shall not haue done, or be conuinced to haue hurt any, yet because they attempted a thing vnlawfull, and abhominable vnto God, are extraordinarily to be punished. And concerning this particular, S. Augustin discourseth excellently, worthy to be read, de cin. dei. l. 8. c. 19.
               
                  
Thirdly, God willeth those should bee put to death, who by Diabolicall and vnlawfull Arts, do endeuour to helpe or harme others, whether in act they performe the same, or purpose with intention, conceiuing and thinking they can do it, with ranke Witches must needes be marshalled; and therefore iustly subiect to deserued punishment.

But I thinke no mans fore-head is so brasen, that will stand Proctor, and plead guiltlesse for these sort of people, who deuote themselues wholly to the Diuell, though neuer so closely, and with great and cautelous secresie: and no doubt God therefore was reuenged of the Templars, and their detestable wickednesse practised in darknesse and obscurity, who all

               Fifthly, they doe solicite others to be of their profession (which is one clause of that contract made betweene them and the Diuell) and consecrate their children vnto him: and against this, there is an especiall caution put in Deteronomy 13. 6. 9. 10.
               Sixtly, they deserue death as inhumane and barbarous tyrants, for lingringly, vt sentiant se mor

sowe discord betweene husband and wife, sollicite maydens, yea enforce both them, and married women to vncleane, and vnlawfull lusts, and heerein implore the helpe of the diuell, to accomplish their malicious designes, which transgression is capitall.
               Seuenthly, the exercise of this act or vanity is punishable by death, although it be practised but onely in sport and ieast, which may appeare thus, because God hath seriously forbidden (and vnder no lesse forfeiture then of life it self) to aske counsell of a Soothsayer or Coniurer; if this then be a crime of such nature, in those, who it may bee heerein thought not to doe euill, there is no reason to induce any to thinke that hee will spare the wilfull, and purposed authors thereof, and Magitians, who worke onely iuggling trickes, and illusions, and fore-tell some future things, as yet vnknowne vntill they doe so fall out, are not freed from the sentence condemnatorie; much more then those who willingly, and vpon premeditated malice, murther or impaire the life and good estate of other, deserue to stand paralell with them.

and inter league with the diuell.
               Eightly, the Iudge or ciuil Magistrate is bound by vertue of that office, and superioritie he sustaineth in the common-wealth, to purge and free that place, in, and ouer which he hath command, of all malefactors, which if he doe neglect, then is a double offender, against the Law both of Iustice and Charity; for hee is obliged by duety to foresee (so much as in him lyeth) that the publike state should be secured, which it concerneth to haue offenders punished, otherwise hee maketh himselfe partner with them in their outrages and offences, and standeth answerable for those dammages sustained by the whole bodie of the people in generall, or vndergone by any particular of the same, for sparing of the wicked Pythagor
