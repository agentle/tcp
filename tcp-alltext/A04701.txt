               WHen Chryst was comē into the region of theMatth. viij. Gadarēs, and had casten the legyon of deuillis out of the naked wylde man, and at these deuillis desyer permitted them to go into the herde of h

               gges, at whose entresse, the swyne tumbled al hedlongs into the meare and were drowned. The Gadarēs hea ringe of this miracle, comē forthe and beholdinge Chryst, were greatly afrayd of him: & desyered Chryst to go out of their region. Which Gadarēs all be it they did vngodly and greatly agenst theyr owne saluacion, to desyer him to auoide frō out of their region whiche cam to caste out their deuillis, to heale and to saue thē, yet shewed they them selues more ientle and humane vnto Chryst thē these princes magistrats and comon peple, to whō the wor de of god the gospell of their saluacion nowe mercifully offred them, yet cruelly and violently thei thrust it from thē with fagots fyer and swerde, blaspheminge it with a legion of deuilysshe horrible newe names. But yet, as the Gadarens were beter content to haue had still emonge thē this mischeuose mad man possessed of so many deuilis then Christ to haue dwelled

And why? Chryst hathe drowned their swyne, say they. And if he shulde tary lōge emonge vs he wold drowne vs to, say they. Siche an answere made some polytyke gredy Gergesens of late possessed verely of legions of deuyls dryuinge thē yet hedlongs into the meare of almaner of mischeif, murther, lechery, dronkenes, glotony pryde ambicion enuye &c. refrayned with no shame no reuerence, with no feare nor lawe nether of god nor man, lyke mad wylde men cryinge out in their pulpits and comon tauerus. That yf this newe lerninge and Lutherane gospell (for so call they gods holy worde) shulde come in frely to be preched, oh what an innouaciō, commocions & mutaciōs wold it make in this realme▪ What sediciōs, tumults and hurle burlis shuld we haue a none in this now so peaceable a regiō? Beter it were therfor eche of vs all were still possessed and laden with

legions of deuyls, fetered still in all idolatry and false religion, then that Iesus Chryst withe his worde shulde here tary any longer.
            Hereof may ye se what a preposter feare and sinister iugement there is nowe in this worlde. Men to be more afrayd of Chryst & his gospell of saluacion to dwel with them, then of a legion of deuyls redy to rende them in peses. Be you (oh papystes) sewerer (thynke ye) vnder the deuyl then vnder Chryst: Do ye promyse your selues to be more quyet in Satans seruyce thē in Christs peaceable religiō? What harme (I pray you) hath our lorde Iesus Chryst & his gospell done to you, so that yf ye walke in his wais and receyue his gospell, ye shulde feare any suche perels of batail sedicions and tumults to fall vpon you? He hath drowned our swyne (say you) he is not the autor of euill say I. He came to drowne and to mortifye your swynisshe filthynes & bestly affectis and to blesse you and yours with encrease. He is the autor of peace and not of sedicion batail and tumult. Your selues thrustinge him and his worde awaye from you so truelly persecuting him in his preachers and professours be the very autors & cause of all batail sedicions trouble morin of your beastis derthe famyn and pestelēce.

And forbecause you feare so sore these euils to fall vpon you for receiuinge and retayninge Chryst with his gospell, therfore be ye sewer, all these heuey heapes of calamities and yet greter & grenoser plages shorteli to be powered forth vpō you.
            But here obiecteth the vnfaythfull cruell Gadarens sayinge. We se it dayly that where this newe lerninge is preached, there foloweth myche trouble, inquietnes tumult sondri sectes diuerse opinions. Truth it is. For neuer was the sead of gods worde sow
                  •
               e & begane to aryse, Satan beinge a sleape. And therfore trede downe this blessed sead with your filthy feet, suffocate it, burne it, thrust it from you with swerde and fyer, and nourisshe still emonge you rather a legion of deuilis cōpellinge men to recant and renye the truthe openly & oft preched, orels burne them. Compell them to sayt. This is a realme of rightwijsenes where in is ministred all inste execucion and uo perse cucion. For where the heade and gouerner professeth Chryst there can be no persecucion. Nether is Chryst (tell it thē) per secuted but emonge the Iewes and gentiles. Unto this I answer. That the gospel preched is the worde of the crosse, Paul to witnes. i. Cor. i. And the true preachers therof, Chrystsendeth as lombes emonge

wolues, Matth. x. Wherfor where as ye haue chased awaye & suppressed the worde of the crosse there can be no persecuciō therof, & where as be no lōbes sent emonge wolues, there cā not the wolues deuou re any lombes. And thus breifly by your owne factis and recantacion wordes, you haue properly proued your selues nether to haue the gospell nor any true prechers sent amonge you purely and frely to preache it, which as it is the most euident token of gods heuey wrath to take awaye his worde and preachers from you, so is it the present token of his fauor to sende vs thē. Also where so euer is Christ our head, there are his members. And what the worlde and Satan did to our head and father of the houshold, the same do theiMat▪
                yet still to his members and faithfull seruants. If the highe preistes and bisshops Caiphas and Annas with the pharisais persecuted our heade Chryst so shall their successours persecute his members, for persecucion is as comon to the body as to the heade. And therfore sayd Paul, Col. i▪ I nowe reioyse in myne afflicciōs for your sakis. For I supple that at yet remayneth and shall euer endure in the affliccions of Chryst in my fleshe for his bodye whiche is the chirche. Here is it playn, Chryst in his members to suffer persecucions vnto

the worldes ende vntill his aduersaries be slayne with the breath of his mouthe, wherfore take awaye persecucion out of Englond, and so take ye awaye the worde of the crosse euen the gospell, the chirche of Christ & all true preachers. Which all gone, there must the persewers & thrusters out of Chryst and his worde be possessed with legions of deuyls. For neuer was there any chirche so litle, so hole and perfit, but it had an aduersarye to persecute it. Chryst was euer to many mo a stomblinge stone and a signe to be ageneLuke. ij. sayd, then to be beleued & to ryse at hym. Then beginneth Satan to rustle when a strouger armed inuadeth his realme. Orels what shuld he do but lydowun & laugh or sleape to se his realme in tranquilyte and in a paceable possessiō? Caiphas Annas the bishops, scribes & pharisais were holy religiouse gostely fathers (but no lordes) till Chryst begane to preache and reueled hym self very god and man, and the beleuers in him onely to besaued. The Iewes were the peple of god agreinge in theyr religion, waitinge for Messias, kepinge theyr ceremonyes rites &c. quiet

            I meruell of what lerninge and religion these bisshops be, that graunte the gospell to be in Englond, and not to be persecuted. The scripture techeth playnely, Matth. xvi. that emonge men, there was, and shall be euer, diuerse and sondre opinions of Christe and his religion and the worde of god euer to be agene sayd & persecuted as longe as this worlde standeth. Who resisted Moses bringinge gods message and gospell into Egipt but the preistes of Egipte? In Israel, Helias prechynge gods worde, had he not the preistes of Baal his aduersaries and per sewers? The false prophetes resisted Ieremye▪ The Pharisais persecuted Chryst. And not only the false Apostles but also the hole worlde persecuted the trwe Apostles. Of this lecte, sayd they to Paule we knowe it to be ageyn sayd and persecuted euery where. After the ApostlesAct. xxviij. tyme the worde of god was not onely resy
                  •
               ted withe the persecucion of tyrants, but also with the wicked doctrynes of heretiques. In the popis kingdome, vntill Erasmus, Ioha Hasse & Wycleue, Martyn Luther, & other men begane to wryte,

there semed to be a good quiete concorde of the chrysten religion, as longe as men beleued in the pope to be head of Chrysts chirche, receyued his false doctryne, rytes cere, tradicions, pardons, satisfacciōs, merits, prayd for the dead and to sayuts, and for the souls in purgatory, pelgrimaged, worshipped stockes and stones, and his misse as a sacrifice for the syunes of the quike and dead. Whiche was euē the same that Chryst sayd in his gospell. As longe as the strong armed kepeth his fore courte and castel gates, all thinges are in peace and salf gard that he hathe. For where Satan hath the rule and dominion ouer the comon doctryne and techers there taketh he diligent heed lest any or many externe dissensions or tumults aryse, nether stereth he vp there many herespes, no not in the Turkes nor Iewes chirches in these dayes, because he hath them sewer at his pleasure beinge lorde head and kinge openly ouer their religiō. And euē so, in the popis kingedom hathe he kept & pet dothe he kepe his fore castle gates, that those thinges whiche he yet possedith myght continewe in peace. Unto this Satans peaceable possession haue our bisshops brought, orels entend they to bringe ageyue their chirche of Englōd lo, so that nowe, thanked be their father

Satan, all is in peace without persecuciō (say they) turned into iuste execucion after theyr owne crafty construccion and execrable exposicion.
            But when the stronger armed cometh vpon hym, then rustleth Satan his har

               es, then stereth he vp tumults, then bloweth he forth bataill, sedicions, conspirisons, insurreccions, rebellions, amōge his bishops & preists that yet by these means were it possible, he might kepe stil his kingdome and be not thrust out of his castle. So that there is no certayner argument and more euident token of the gospell to be vtterly oppressed, & of Satan to raigne in peace, as to se the publike concorde of, and in the religion. And there is no tokē so certayn manifest and euident of the worde of god arysing and cominge forth into syght, as when ye se a comon publike discorde in, and of the religion. For and yf euer men shuld haue loked and trusted for any open and generall concorde of, & in the religion in the worlde, at the reuelynge and open prechinge of the gospell, it shuld haue ben at that tyme when our lorde Iesus Chryst him selfe reueled and preached it emonge the Iewes. He is the sone of god by whom al things were created, no aposte, nor prophete to be compa

forth with great honour and created the prince of all Egipt. Iob loste all his good but double was restored him. Dauid was caste out into exile of Saul, but yet was he called home agen and exalted into the regall maiestye. Daniel was cast in to the lyons, and a non made the prince of the Persians. And as ye se, that if our god in this worlde promoueth his, out of affliccion and persecucion into glorye honor and felicite, miche more translateth he his derely beloued chosen out of these miserable and heuey present persecucions into that heuenly perpetuall ioye and felicite in the other worlde. And the lenger it is differred the more sweter it is when we haue it, our lorde god yet counfortinge vs with his assewered promises sayinge. I shall delyuer mi people frō all their tribulaciōs. Soner shall heuē and erth passe awaye then mi wordis to passe vnfulfilled, hills and mountayns shal be shakē down but my mercy shal not go fro me, & the couenāt of mi peace shall not be moued saith the lorde god moste mercifull. Loke vpon Christe the sone of god whiche aftir he was deiected vnto the dethe of the crosse, was he not exalted into the moste hyghe honor & glory, & had geuen him a name aboue al names so that in the name of Iesu euery since boweth

downe bothe in heuen erthe & in hell? and what is done in the head shall not the same be done in the mēbers? Wherfore the more affliccion and persecucion the worde of the crosse bringeth to vs, the more felicite and greter ioye abideth vs in heuen. But the worldly peace, idle ease, welthey pleasure and this present transitory felicyte which the vngodly imagin to procure them selues here by persecutinge and thrustinge awaye the gospell, shal be turned here into their owne trouble bataill (as ye now this daye see it) and at laste into the horrible destruccions and mutacions of their realmes, and aftir this (if they repent not) into ther own perpetual infelicite, perdicion and dampnacion. And if our lordely prowed bishops wolde consider and measure the state of the christen chirche by the actes of the Apostles, they shuld see in howe greuouse persecucion it was, when the moste nowmber of disciplesAct. vi. encreased. Agen if they wolde read the storyes ether of the holy or haithen, they shulde see that when the chyrche was in moste welthe and ease, the prelats in idlenes aspiringe for riches and honor, then entred into it, the most pestelēt poyson and destruccion of all godly doctrine, then encreased all ydolatry heresyes supersticion, and mens deuilyssh tradicions

as ye may see in constantyne the emperours dayes, and in gregoryes the grete his tyme, howe Chrystes religion then began to dekaye.

floke. The worlde loueth his owne. And because we be not the worldis, butIoā. xv. chosen out of it, therfore dothe the worlde hate vs. Let vs not forgete these wordes of owr sauiour Chryst. The seruant is not beter then his master. If they haue persecuted me they shal persecute you also. Wherfore and if there be no persecucion at any tyme in Englond, so is there nether Chryste nor any of his members.

That if we suffer with Chryst for his names glorye: sewer and certayn be we that god loueth vs ād hath chosen vs to be his sonnes ād ayers of theij.

That Chryste is geuen vs not onely for an example vs to suffere with him but also an helper a defender and preseruer in all our affliccions and troubles, ād will not at any tyme forsake vs, nor leaue vs a lone in our bataill and perell. But who so toucheth vs, he toucheth the apple of his eye, and he that dothe vs iniurye dothe iniury to Chryst, as he said to Paul. Saul, Saul, why persecutest me▪ He persecutedAct. ix. the crystians whom Christe estemeth and calleth as him selfe, and reputeth the same persecucion done to his own persone which is done to vs.
               Let euery faithfull here consider with him self, howe great a faithfull helper we haue of Chryste whyles for his sake we suffer persecucion. For if we belene in Chryst and suffer for his sake, we are verely crystiās and the sonnes of god. And if god be our father, Chryst our lorde, our head ād our brother, no doute, god beholdeth vs tenderinge vs as diligently as any father may loue his owne derely beloued sonne, as the Psalme witnesseth. Owr helpe to be of the lorde whiche hath made heuen and erthe. He shall not once suffere our feet to slyde.

restored gloriously vnto our soulis. Netheri. cor. xv may they slaye our soulis: for thei be immortall. Thei can not take our bodyesMat. x. nor soulis out of the hādis of god. Whiche if we be kept in the hādis of god as in the bosome of our most louing father, & if we abyde in Cryst & Chryste in vs; sewerly we shall lyue for euer. Chryst thus affirminge.Ioan. x. My shepe he are my voice, I knowe them, thei folow me, and I geue them euerlastynge lyfe. Nether shall they be lost: nor noman shall pluk them out of my handis.
               Wherfore let the wiked haithen & vnbeleuers be afraid, tormēted, and be with out hope at the syght of dethe which knowe not god in Chryst, whiche when they knowe not Chryst to be their very rightwysenes, their lyfe & their onely sauiour nor beleue not in him, thei must nedis abide & perisshe in their sinnes, in deathe and in eternall dampnacion. But we ought not to feare nor to be heauye and tormented in mynde, as do thei which haue no hope, for we se a beter lyfe aftir this abydinge vs. Whiche the ignorant vnbeleuers in Chryste know not. And albeit here for a tyme we passe forthe laid agaynst many perells, molested and whetted with diuerse and many greuouse afflicciōs, yet at last, all the laboriouse myseries of this

lyfe passed ouer, the glorye of the sonnes of god shall be shewed and declared vpon vs, euen as we here vpon erthe haue ben in hope salfe and blessed. Nowe we wepe and be heuye, but the daye of our gladnes is not farre of in the whiche our Lorde God shall wype awaye the teares from the chekis of vs that beleue in him, and shall happely change our heuynes into an infinite perpetuall ioye: then to singe this triumphe. Death is swallowed vp into victorye. Oh deth where is thy stinge? Oh hell where is thy victorye? Oh syn where is now thy myght? Thākes be to our God and father which hath geuen vs the victory, by our Lorde Iesus Chryste. i. Corin. xv.
               If the feare of dampnacion and perpetuallConsolaciō ageynst the fere of dāpnacion. death shulde vexe vs, then let vs remember our selues to haue ben baptyzed into Chryst, ingraffed into his death, owr synnes buryed in his woundes, and rysen with him into glorye and lyfe. And so is there no condempnacion,Ro. viij. as saynt Paul sayth, vnto them whiche are thus by faith ingraffed into Iesu cryste, which walke not after the flesshe but aftir the spyrite. In this our swete and plentuouse vynestok, yf we as lyuely faithfull braunches abyd by constant faithe, our sinnes are neuer more imputed

vnto vs. By this faithe we be made the sonnes of god and the ayers of eternall lyfe, euen the felowe ayers with Christe. If we haue Chryst in vs, (by faith we fele him presēt in our hertes) so feare we no condempnacion. For Chryst is our lyfe and our sauinge helthe eternall, dwellinge in vs, ageynst whom nether hell nor death nor synne can preuaile. Let vs thefore abyde by constant faith in our sauiour Chryst walkinge in him roted ād framed vpon him, perseueringe in faithe cō
                  stantly cleauinge to him, committing our selues hole vnto his goodnes & mercye, and let vs with hert mouth and lyfe testifye and declare our faith obedience and thankfulnes vnto him for his inestimable ryches of his gospell now geuen vs.
               What can I more saye? We haue our celestiall father, our father (I say) of an infinite clemencie goodnes and mercye, which can no lesse forget vs then any erthely father his owne derely beloued sone or any mother hir owne tendre frutes of hir owne bodye soukinge at hir brests. And were it in case that the mother perchaunce might forgete hir yonge lytle infant, yet shall our mercifull father neuer forgete vs, Isay. xlix.
               We haue a redemer and a delyuerer, euen the moste myghtiest Lorde Christe

Iesu to whom is geuen all powr in heuen and erthe. Whiche raigneth our all, he loueth vs, he hath taken vs to be his brethern, we are his members, he hathe deserued for vs all goodnes and all felicite. He hath geuen vs the glorye whiche hisIoan. xviij. father gaue him that we shulde be all one in Chryst and in the father, as the father and sonne be one, out of the whiche vnite all the treasures of the diuine goodnes, of rightwysenes, lyfe, consolacion and helthe be geuen vnto vs. Thorowe owr faith in Christe and for Chrystis sake we are one that is to saye, of one consent mynde and felowship with the father and the sonne and the holy goste, so that as the sone cannot be diuidid from the father, nor the holy gost from them bothe, nomore may we beinge the faithfull in Chryste, be separated from Cryste. For Christe wolde that where so euer him selfe were, there shuld we be with him, whiche thinge aftir ourIoan. xvij. departure is as certaynly trwe as is him self the verite which so said it, prayd for it and obtayned it for vs of his father.
               Furthermore. If our faith be yet to weake to apprehende fermely these infinite so riche benefits, thē let vs flye vnto the promises of god, which as they be right many, so are they the most trwest & certayne, whiche ought to be depely printed

That if our rightwysenes and saluacionThanswer. shuld stande vpon our owne good workes and worthynes, then sewerly had we lost in euery minute all these riche benefits of god, then might we be vncertay ne of all these promyses, and of any remission of our synnes and lyfe eternall, if lyfe and remission were promised vs vpō siche a cōdicion, that is, if we fulfill gods preceptis and so by owr good dedis merit our saluaciō, so were we without all hope of saluaciō. For we are euery hower synners and all our beste works are imperfect, yea thei be (as Isaye saith) corrupt & sinfull, if they shulde be expended & tryed in the rigour of gods lawe and exammed at his straight iugement. If the hope of our saluacion shulde stande vpon the merits & worthines of owr workis, we must

nedis despeyre neuer to haue peace in our consciences, when there is no man so holy and perfit of lyuinge whiche may verely glorye him self at altymes so to haue had fulfilled the lawe as it ought to be fulfilled. But prayse be vnto god our moste mercifull father whiche hath so intyrely loued vs for Christes sake, that he hath taken our saluacion out of owr owne feble handis ād hathe set it vpon a sewerer and more certayne foundacion, that is to weit euen vpon his mere grace and mercye promysed in Christe, our faithe reachinge it vnto Chrystes blode wasshinge away al our sinnes. If we beleue this promise so be we iustified, absolued & saued. Nothinge els requireth he of vs concerninge our remission and saluacion, then thus to beleue in Chryste euen him selfe by his death to haue obtayned vs remission an lyfe eternall. Wherfore when siche temptacions assawte vs, then let vs crye for faithe to beleue these promyses in Cryste. And suffer not our selues to be thruste from them. Of the whiche thusRo. iiij. saith Paul. For owr faith, is the heretage geuen vs, that frely of grace and fauour, ferme fast and sewer shulde the promise stande vnto all the sead, not to it that is of the lawe onely, but vnto them that are of the faith of Abraham.
               
                  This is our consolaciō, this is our hope onely. Who so reacheth this promyse with his faith he shal neuer despeper. For certain it is, the some of our helthe to stād vpon fayth in Iesu Chryste vpon this growndsole is the dore of our saluacion turned and returned. Let vs therfore apprehende with our faith this diuine promise whiche we nother may nor can deser ue, and we haue all these celestiall benefitis, euen remission of our sinnes, the holy goste and eternall lyfe. All these hath god promised vs in Christe and for Chrystis sake. In this promise consisteth all our cō

Beleue god to be trwe of his promise, and caste not awaye the gospell of his sone preched vnto the, but receyue it thankfully with all thy herte, enbrace it with bothe thyne armes, ād dout it not, this gospell to be as well thyne, as Pauls and Steuens, & as mightely to saue the, as it saued them.

And beware lest thou thinkest thy workis to be meritis of right wysenes and helthe before God. For this opinion and persuasion is an vngodly blasphemie ageynst Chryste.

The workis & merits of Christe onely geue vs frely our saluacion & not ours, nor yet the workes of any creature els.

                   yet afrayd it is the truth that we set forthe.

This mater wolde he to consiste in and vpon faith that who so beleue in Chryst shulde haue forgeuenes of his synnes and lyfeeternal not for his owne, but for Christes merits. This glorie of our fathers diuine mercye ought to be preched and setforthe before all men, that thorowe Christe they might come vnto the father, which hath sette Christ at his right hande and made him Lorde of the aungels, of men, and of all creatures celestiall and terrestriall, and to be iuge ouer the lyuinge and dead and to raigne in the glory of the father with all the faithfull and chosen in Chryst. This is the constant & immutable will of god. This is his eternall sentence, God will

therfore defende & fight for his own cause, nother may any man resiste him. Christ will raigne and put all his enimies vnder his feet. And who shall let it: He is of an infinite almighty powr, and will sone defende his cause euē ageynst all the power of the spirituall antichristis, and let them take all the seculare swerdes and the deuill to, to helpe them.

and will be spred into all the worlde accordinge to gods ordinance which no enforcements no counsels of men, nor powr may let it, nor tarye it, although these papists wolde breake their beastly bellis therfore.
               At Auspurgh and at Batisbone, their drift was to haue vtterly extinguysshed the gospell, and what successe had their wyked enforcements? Uerely in bothe the same cities & in all the countrye aboute, their owne fylthey fasshons and cruell conuersacion so promoued it, and stablisshed it that they shal neuer be able to quē
                  che it. For euery man sawe howe fonde & weake were their reasons and foundacions, thei espyed their cruell false and subtyle dryftis to depresse gods wordis. All men sawe their abhominable shameles lyues, thei perceyued howe gretely thei were afrayd to let their faithe and doctryne come into light. Many wyse and noble men there were whiche merueled greately to se these men so fyercely and so furiously to take on with the gospellers reuilinge and spittinge out their venome at them as at the moste pestelent heretiques and so callinge them, prechinge and affirminge so boldely the popes cause and his doctryne to be the trwe iuste and godly religion. And when thei shulde bothe come

to the tryoll treatinge and disputinge of the causes, then were thei asshamed to bring forth their popisshe doctryne or to wryte their religion openly, whiche they so gloriously and so stoughtly had bosted before to be the very trwe catholike faithe and doctryne of god ād of their holy mother the chirche vnable to be resisted or once spotted. Euen here begane many good men and euen the laye peple to doute & mistrust their doctrine so highly craked of, and bosted before, euen here perceyued the people there doctryne and religion to be starke naught, vncertayne ād false, for that whē a rekening therof was asked them, thei feringe the lyght, sought blody shiftes and leet their owne religion lye still lurkinge in derke dennes. Then sayd the nobles and comon people, who shall beleue theire doctryne, sithe the defenders therof dare not let it be sene in wrytinge, but seke howe to defende it withe violence and murther? Sewrly (said thei) this their cause can not be iuste and good as they boste ād crake it. Trwly the verite flieth not from the light but dare be sene tryed and iuged of all men. And euen thus said many whiche came out of al cooltes, as out of Spayne, Italye, Portugale and out of the nether Germanye and oute of the other partes of Europe

to these counsels, whiche before were thought to stande of the papystes syde. Whiche when thei had sene ād herd owr doctryne and red it, euery where mightely confirmed with the testimonies of the holy scriptures clerely and iustely alledged, and also approued withe the hole consent of the olde holy doctours of the chirche immediately after the Apostles, seinge the chrysten men constātly offeringe vp this owr faithe religion and doctrine before all the worlde, and that their ad uersaries coulde not by no scriptures truly taken, conuince and ouerthroe owr doctryne, but were bothe asshamed, confownded and afrayd: they repented them selues that euer they had other mayntayned it, or beleued it so longe. Then all these nacions returned home, applyed them selues to readinge and hearinge the scriptures and sought out lerned and faithfull preachers, so that sence that tyme, they haue in many countryes caste awaye the Pope with his Autichrysten relygion and by Gods grace are they called vnto the very gospell. And nowe is it openly knowne with what, and howe blody counsels, with whom they conspyred, whom they encensed to murther the holy innocent chyrches of Cryste and violently with swerde and

fyer to oppresse the gospell of Chryst, so that all the worlde seeth all their hope and shote ancore of their helthe not to stande in the arme of god, but their hole confidence to consist in the multitude of papistes in worldly powr and policye in a flesshely arme, and in lordis ād princes whom they so perswaded withe all maner kyndes of flaterye, obsequye, carnall pleasurs and reasons and withe the moste shamefull lyes encensinge them that their owne patrones and pylars, if they were not bewitched & blinde, might perceyue them openly to go about to stablisshe and defende the very tyranni of Antichryste. If their doctryne were godly and right wherfore shulde they hyde it? what nede they ageynst vs swerde and fyer?

Nethelesse yet with no kinde of tormēts (were thei neuer so cruell sharpe ād terrible) nether with their insaciable blod thirstinge, coulde the persecutours put away and quenche the chrysten faith. But the cruellier thei persecuted the faith in Chryst, the wyder it spred, the deper it roted, and the higher it grewe and encreased, ād the more and mightier was the nowmber of the crystianes. This was verely a meruelouse thinge. But it was god whiche assisted defended ād animated his chirche, the lorde faught for them mightely, Deuter. xx.

The worlde euer contendeth to pluke the crystians frō the trwe worship vnto idolatrye ād to papistrye now with fayer promises and then with greuouse threates and bitter terrible deathes. But the chosen of god shall euer stande constantly and the sewerer in Chryst vnable to be ouercomen, whose crysten constancye so angreth the vngodly that their fierre furye rageth into wodenes madnes ād murther. Whose fyerce madnes when it rageth moste tyrannously, yet can it not slaye the sowle but onely our mortall bodies, wherfore the very crystians do laughe at their threates and torments. For we be perswaded certainly in our faithe, Chryste to haue ouercomen dethe for vs, so that death is no death to vs but a ioyfull ende of synne and a glad passage to perpetuall lyfe. We are sewer that our bodyes shall ryse ageyne gloriouse and immortall, vnto the whiche gloriouse immortalyte

And albeit our flesshe be infirme and weake, yet a godly mynde in his inwarde man desyereth with Paul to be dissolued out of this miserable sinfull worlde and to be with Chryste. For Christe hath so promised me to be where so euer him silf is, and hath obtayned it me bi his prayer of his father. What now can all the antichristē vngodly do ageynste vs? verely nothing at all vnto our hurte, thei can not take faithe and Chryste from our hertis, they may with violence kut out our tongues, but from our hertis may they not take our faithe our profession and praise of crystis glorye. And yet what so euer they do, it is by the sufferance of god for our saluacion and into their owne dampnacion. They may take awaye our corporall & transitory goodis,

whiche we set not miche vp, seinge for thē god geueth vs goodis eternall and celestiall. They kyll our bodyes, but thei sende our soules into the handis of our heuē

Let vs not therfore nowe (crysten brethern, be to sewer idle and sloughisshe in owr giftis receyued, but praye incessantly god to encrease in vs faithe in Cryste. Let vs abyde in the faithe of his gospell cleuinge vnto it ernestly. And so be we with out perell in all salfgard and sewertye. Faith glueth vs and Chryste togither neuer to be diuelled. And if we haue Cryste, so can there no thinge hurte vs nether synne nor deathe, nor hell, nor yet Satan, nor all his ministers in the worlde.
            
            
               The fifte consolacion is. The rewarde and ende of the faithfull in Chryste is lyfe euerlastinge.
               FYftly let vs be conforted and confirmed in our hertis whiles yet we lyue in our persecucion. For that there abydeth vs the moste inestimable & most ioyfull felicite promised vs of god, if we constantly contine we and perseuer vnder this our crosse vnto the ende, for a transitory light payne we be sewer of an euerlastinge ferme ioye. What paynes, what trauels and perels do the marchant man take bothe by sea and Londe to gather

and get him but transitorye and sone lost goodes? And shall we ether with feare be deiected, or for a lytle paynes taking be repelled, from that inestimable ioy ād felicite which as no man can take it from vs, so shall we enioye them euerlastinge. Owr tresure for whiche we trauell and are sewer to obtayur it, no mortall eye ha ue sene it, no care may heare it, nor hert may comprehende it, whiche treasure god hathe prepared for vs that loue him.

Sewerly all the affliccions, heuynesses and persecucions here, are very light and litle to vs, if we well ponder owr felicite and blessed ioyouse state shortely to come. The Lorde mought illumyn the eyes of owr vnderstandynge that we might lerne what is the hope of our vocacion, and what be the ryches of the glorye of the heretage of the faithfull. So be it.

When I therfore remember so effec tuouse and so mighty a medicyne, there can no sinfull sykenes make me afraide. And therfore he erred & sinned greuously whiche said. Greater is my iniquitie then godis mercye maye forgeue it. But that man, as he was non of crystis members, so did not crystis meritis and his satisfac cion pertaine vnto him.

Wherby the apostle shewth in how great feare were the Israelits, the sea lyinge before their eyes and their mortall enimies the Egipcians beinge at their heelis. It was a fearefull syght to see them in this distresse passinge downe into the botome

So that by this baptisme euen the face of our perpetuall repentance, we be taught and warned of our Crysten profession that is to take the crosse of Cryst vpon vs and to folowe him by paciently sufferinge, into his perpetuall glorye.
