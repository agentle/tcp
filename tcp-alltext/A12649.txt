SHORT
RVLE OF
GOOD LIFE.
            To direct the deuout Christian
in a regular and
orderly course.
            Newly set forth according to
the Authors direction,
before his death.
            Set me downe (O Lord) a
law in thy way. 
                  Ps. 118.
            
            I said (O Lord) that it is my
portion and al my riches,
to keepe thy law.

            THE
PREFACE TO
the Reader.
            WHen that
great seruāt
of God, S.
Benet, had
in most seruent
and deuout prayers, 
                  •
               eelded
vp his soule vnto God:
two of his religious followers
(as reporteth S. Gregorie) being
ignorant altogether of his
death, although in places far
distant, had the like vision.
They saw out of their godly

Fathers cel
                  •
               e, directly towards
the East▪ a most beautifull
way, adorned with gorgeous
Tapestry, and shining
with a multitude of innumerable
lampes, to proceed euen
vnto heauen. At the toppe
wherof there standing, a notable
person in a venerable
habite, and demaunding of
them whose way it was which
they behelde, they answered
they knew not. But he incontinently
said vnto them these
w
                  •
               rdes. Haec est via qua dilectu
                     •
                  
Domino coelum Benedictus
ascendit. This is
the way, by the which Gods
wel-beloued seruaunt Benedict,
went vp to heauen,
meaning thereby (as S. Bernard
noteth) the holie Rule
of a religious life, instituted

and practised by the same
Saint, by which not hee alone
was passed, as by a most readie
and pleasant way to heauen,
but whosoeuer of his followers
would trauell by the same,
should with like securitie, arriue
to the end of a most happie
iourney.
            The Author of this little
Booke (gentle Reader) I nothing
doubt, but is verie well
knowne vnto thee, as also for
his learning, pietie, zeale, charitie,
fortitude, & other rare
and singular qualities, but

                  •
               speciallie for his pretious
death, he is renowned in the
world abroad: neither needeth
there any extraordinarie vision,
but the sound and certaine
Doctrine of the Catholike
Church, is sufficient to

perswade, that he is a most
glorious Saint in heauen: hee
being such an one as hath confessed
a good confession before
many w
                  •
               tnesses, and made (as
Saint Iohn saith) his garments
white with the blood of
the immacula
                  •
               e Lambe. But
because thou shouldest not
be ignorant, of the way by
which this valiant Champion
of Christ, arriued vnto so
happie a Countrey, he himselfe
hath left behinde him for
thy benefite, and euen amongst
the least of his fruitfull labours,
for the good of soules,
had designed to publish vnto
the world, the description of
this most gainefull voyage to
heauen; be-decked with the
most pre
                  •
               ious ornaments of all
Christian vertues, and with

the most pleasant and comfortable
brightnesse of notable
rules of spirituall life: euery
one of which, may be as it
were a Lanterne vnto thy
feete, and a continuall Light
vnto thy steppes.
            This therefore doe I nowe
(deuout Reader) present vnto
thy sight, affirming vnto thee,
that which thou thy selfe
wilt not denie, as being both
true and manifest: that, Haec
est via qua dilectus Domino
N. caelum intrauit, This is
the way by which the wel-beloued
seruant of God N.
went vp into heauen.
            For in what estate soeuer
he liued in this worlde, hee
ranne the way of Christian
perfection, in an ordinarie
course of a secular life, 
                  〈◊〉
               
               
from his very infancie he was
a spectacle to all that knewe
him in the state of Religion,
the which he imbraced from
his childehood; he was a rare
example of religious perfection
and discipline: and finally
in his manie seueral and most
cruell conflicts with the enemies
of Christ, he sheweth
how stronge and vnconquered
the loue of God is, whose
burning heate neuer so manie
waters or gustes of moste
mayne floudes, may either
quench or smother: and whose
power the most power-able
thing of all, which is Death,
can not ouercome.
            Thou therefore (my deare
brother) heholding, according
to the ex
                  •
               ortation of this victorious
triumpher, see thou

imitate his faith. Fashion thy
life and manners according to
these deuoute rules, which are
a most perfect mirour of his
godlie life: & in so doing, thou
mayest hapilie attaine thy self
to the like crowne of glorie.
            For though Martirdome be a
most speciall gifte of God, and
he freelie bestoweth it where
hee liketh, neyther is it an ordinarie
rewarde due vnto neuer
so great merites of neuer
so holie personages, and it is to
his excellent power a moste
easie thinge, subitò honestare
pauperem, euen from the
middest of a sinnefull life, to
exalt vnto Martirdome: yet
is there a certaine disposition
in those which are chosen to
so high a dignitie ordinarilie
required of God, which is

first to haue killed their passions,
before they be killed by
persecutors; first to haue
beene exercised in a spirituall
conflict of mortification, before
they be tried in the fornace
of Christian confession;
first to haue become the towne,
butchers, before they be deliuered
to the hangmans shambles.
Otherwise (as our Sauiour
saieth) Qui amat animam
suam perdet eam: Who so
loueth his life or soule disordinately
shall loose it, and neuer
be able to stand in that combatte,
wherein not flesh and
bloud, not pride, ambition, and
vaine glory, not malice and
rancour; but a mortified

                  •
               inde, and a resigned heart
into Gods handes, obtaineth
the victory.
            
               Which disposition and
ready preparation for this so
happy a crowne, was most
perfectly found in this our
Authour: whereupon iusued,
that he might truely 
                  •
               ay
with holy. I. B. Elegit suspendium
anima mea, &
mortem ossa mea. Desperaui
nequaquam, vltra iam viuam.
My soule bath made
choice of hanging, and my
bones of death. I am become
desperate, I will now liue no
longer: because long before he
had hanged vp his soule by
perfect estranging of it from
earthly affections, and keeping
it fixed and ioyned to God;
thence did it pooceed, that his
earthly bo
                  •
               es, abhorred not
that death which was to be
suffered for Christ. And because

he had wi
                  •
               hdrawne
his hopes from the base desires
of this life, therefore did 
                  •
               e
contemne this life for the loue
of this heauenlie life, and he
thought he had liued long
enough, when he might die to
liue for euer.
            Enioy therefore these rules
deuout Reader, and ioyfullie
treade the pathes of this most
pleasant way to heauen: and
if by the compendious commoditie
thereof thou shalt see
thy iorney toward thy euerlasting
countrie to be forwarded;
giue glorie vnto God, and
vnto this his faithfull seruaunt;
and assiste with thy
deuoute prayers those which
haue beene meanes to prepare
it for thee.
            Yet doe I aduise thee of two

especiall thin
                  •
               es: first, that
whereas in these Rules thoushalt
sometimes reade, that
thou must doe this or that;
thou must not vnderstand
that worde (must) as though
thou wert bound to the performance
of any thinge there
expressed, but onely that those
actions doe belong vnto the
exercise of perfection without
anie further bond, then either
the lawe of God, or holie
church do impose.
            Secondlie, that before thou
begin to practise these Rules,
containing in them great perfection,
thou acquaint thy
selfe with an other Booke
entituled The Exercise of a
Christian life, or such otherlike,
lest thou attempt to
builde a great house with

slender foundation: and
climing to the toppe of a
high ladder; without passing
by the middle steppes, at
vnawares thou receiue a
fall. Vale.
         
      
      
         
            
            A SHORT
RVLE OF
GOD LIFE.
            
               THE FIRST CHAPTER
of the foundations of a
Good life.
               
                  The first foundation.
                  
                     THE first foundation
of a good
life is, often and
seriously to consider
for what
end and purpose I was created,
and what Gods designement
was, when he made
mee of nothing, and that
not to haue a being only, as
a stone, nor withall a bare

kinde of life or growing, as
a plant or tree, nor moreouer
a power of sence or
feeling only as a bru
                        •
                     t beast,
but a creature to his owne
likenes, indued with reason
vnderstanding and freewil.
Also why he now preserueth
me in this health, state and
calling. Finally why he redemed
me with his owne
bloud, bestowed so infinite
benefites vppon me, and
still continueth his mercy
towards me.
                  
                     The end of man.
                     The end of my being thus
made, redeemed, preserued,
and so much benefited by
God, is this and no other:
that I should in this life serue
him, with my whole body,
soule and substance, and

with what else soeuer is mi
                        
                           •
                        e,
and in the next life enioy

                           •
                        im for euer in heauen.
                  
                  
                     Rules that follow of this
foundation.
                     
                        
                           •
                         Was made of nothing by
God, and receiued body
and soule from him, and
therfore am I only his, not
mine owne, neither can I
so binde or giue my selfe to

                           ••
                        y creature, but that I ought

                           •
                        ore to serue, loue and obey
God, then any creature in
this world.
                     Secondly I committe a

                           •••
                        de of theft, and do God
g
                           •
                        eat wrong, so often as I

                           ••
                        ploy any part of my body

                           〈◊〉
                         soule, to any other ende
thē to his seruice, for which
only I was created.
                     
                        
Thirdly, for this do I liue,
and for no other ende, but
for this, doe all creatures
serue me, and when I turne
the least thing whereof God
hath giuen me the vse or
possessing▪ to any other ende
then the seruice of God,
doe God wrong, and abuse
his creatures.
                  
               
               
                  The second foundation.
                  Seeing I was made to
serue God in this life, and
to enioye him in the next,
the seruice of God, and the
saluation of mine owne soule,
is the most weighty and
important busines, and the
most necessary matter wherin
I must employ my bodie,
minde, time, and labour: and
all other affaires are so farre
foorth to be esteemed of me

waighty or light, as they
more or lesse tend to the furtherance
of this principall &
most earnest busines. For
what auaileth it a man to
gaine the whole world, and
loose his owne soule?
                  
                     Rules that follow of this
foundation.
                     FIrst what diligence, labour,
or cost, I would
emploie in any other temporall
matter of credit▪
liuing, or life, all that I am
bound to employ in the seruice
of God, and the saluation
of my soule: and so
much more, as the weight or
worth of my soule, passeth al
other things.
                     Secondly I ought to think
the seruice of God, and saluation

of my soule my principall
busines in this world,
and to make it my ordinary
study and chiefe occupation,
and day and night to keepe
my minde so fixed vpon it,
that in euery actiō I stil haue
it before mine eies, as the
onely marke I shoote at.
                  
               
               
                  the third foundation.
                  I Cannot serue God in
this world, nor go about to
enioye him in the next, but
that Gods enemies and
mine, will repine and seeke-to
hinder me: which enemies
are three: the Worlde,
the Flesh, and the Deuill.
Wherefore I must resolue
my selfe, and sett it downe
as a thing vndouted, that my
whole life must be a continuall
combate with these

aduersaries: whom I must
assuredly perswade my selfe
to lie hourely in waite for
me, to seeke their aduantage.
And that their malice is so
vnplacable, and their hatred
against me so rooted in
thē, that I must neuer looke
to haue one hower secure
from their assaultes: but that
they will 
                        •
                     rom time to time,
so long as there is breath in
my body, still labour to
make me forsake and offend
God, alure me to their seruice,
and drawe me to my
damnation.
                  
                     Rules following of this
foundation.
                     I Must prepare my body
and mind to all patience,
and thinke it no newes to

be tempted, but a point annexed
necessarily to my
profession, and therfore neuer
must I be wearied with
the difficultie, considering
the malice and wickednesse
of mine aduersaries, and my
professed enmitie with thē.
                     Secondly I must alway
stand vpon my guarde, and
be very watchfull in euery
action, seeing that whatsoeuer
I doe, they wil seeke
to peruert it, and make it
offensiue to God, euen my
very best indeuours.
                     Thirdly I must neuer
looke to befree from some
trouble or other, but
knowing my life to be a
perpetuall warfare, I must
rather comefort my s
                           •
                        lfe
with hope of a glorious

crowne for my victories,
then of any long or assured
peace with mine enemies.
                  
               
               
                  The fourth foundation.
                  The thing which these
enemies endeuour for to
drawe me vnto, is, sinne and
offence of God: which is so
odious, hatefull, and abhominable,
that God doth
more detest and dislike it,
then he did the cruell vsage,
the woundes, the tormentes,
and the death it
selfe, that for vs he suffered
of the Iewes, and it
maketh our soules more
vgly, then the plague▪ leprosy,
or any other moste filthy
disease doth the body.
                  
                     Rules following this
foundation.
                     SO carefull as I woulde

bee not to wounde, torment,
or murther Christ,
so carefull must I bee, not
to commit any mortall sinne
against him, yea and much
more, seeing that he hate
                           •
                        h
sinne more then death, hauing
voluntarily suffered
the one, and yet neuer committed
the other.
                     Secondly when I am tēpted
with any sinne, let me
examine my selfe, whether
I would buy the fulfilling
of mine appetite, with
being a leaper or full of the
plague, or with death presently
to ensue after it: if
not, then much lesse ought
I to buy it with the leprosie,
losse, and death of my soule,
which is of far more worth
then my body.
                  
               
               
                  
                  The fift foundation.
                  Being Gods creature
made to serue him in this
life: my body, soule, and
goods, and all things any
way appertaining vnto
me, are but lent, or onely
let me for this end, and I
am only as bailiffe, tenaunt
or officer, to demaine or
goue
                        •
                     ne these thinges to
his best seruice: and therfore
when the time of my
stewardship is expired, I
shall be summoned by
Death to appeare before
my Land-lorde, who with
most rigorous iustice will
demaunde account of euery
thing and creature of his,
that hath beene to my vse,
yea of all that I haue receiued,
promised, omitted,

committed, lost and robbed:
and as I can then discharge
this account, so shall I be
either crowned in eternall
ioy, or condemned to perpetuall
damnation.
                  
                     Rules following of this
foundation.
                     FIrst, I must vse all thinges
in this life as an other
bodies goods, for which I
must be accountable to the
vtter-most farthing.
                     Secondly, the more I haue,
the greater and harder wil be
mine account of the good
vse thereof, and therefore
the more wary
                           •
                        ought I to
be, in disposing of it.
                     Thirdly, let mee often cō
                        sider
what bodily, ghostly,
and internall giftes of God I

haue receiued, what in baptisme
and at other times I
haue promised: how profitable
and necessary good
workes I haue omitted:
how many grieuous and heinous
sinnes I haue committed:
how often I haue lost
the grace of God, & my right
to heauen: finally how much
honour, and how many soules
I haue robbed from God:
and these things being well
perused, let mee seeke to
make that recompence and
satisfaction for them, which
I would wish to haue made
when death shall summon
me before my heauenly
iudge, to giue vp a most strict
account of them.
                     The fruit of these foundations
consisteth in often cō
                        sidering

them, as most necessary
pointes, and as it
were the verie first principles
of good life, vpon the
vnderstanding and practising
whereof, depēdeth my progresse
in vertue: and therfore
I must very often r
                           •
                        ade them
and examine my selfe, whether
my minde and actions
be answerable vnto them.
                  
               
            
            
               Howe we ought to be affected
towards God.
               THE SECOND
Chapter.
               
                  First of the consideration of
Gods presence.
                  THese foundations beeing
laide, it behoueth
mee further to descende to

the notice of my duety to
God, my neighbour, and my
selfe.
                  And first concerning my
due
                        •
                     ie vnto God, a very fitte
meane I can vse to please
him is, to beare alwaie in
minde his presence. For sure
it is that as God, hee is euery
where in substance, power
and presence, and in him I
liue, moue, and I am, as the
scripture saith, because he
worketh with me in all my
deedes, thoughts and wordes:
In so much that as the
beame of the sun, the heat of
the fire, or wettnes of the
water, so depend I of God:
and should he withdrawe
himselfe from mee but one
moment, I should forthwith
turne into nothing, and

therfore it is a very forcible
meanes for my good, to doe
all things as if I did see God
visibly woorking and cooperating
with me in euery action,
as in truth he doth, and
knowinge that what woordes,
thoughtes, or deedes
soeuer passe me, and what
part of my body or minde
soeuer I vse, Gods concourse
and helpe therunto, is more
then mine owne, I must be
a fraid to vse them in any
such thing wherein I might
offend him: but rather seeke
to doe all things so that they
be worthy of his presence,
helpe, and assistance in them.
And if I can get a custome or
habitte to remember still the
presence and assistance of
God (as by vse easely I may)

I shall with due regrd, reuerence,
and consideration,
abstaine from such behauiour,
as I thinke may any
waie bee offensiue vnto him
I shall also get a great facility
in turning my minde and
heart to him, and in talking
often with him by short and
sweet praiers, which are the
fewell of deuotion.
                  Other affectō is that we ought
to haue vnto God
                  Secondly I must endeuour
to kindle in my selfe, these
affections towardes God.
               
               
                  The First Affection.
                  FIrst, of a sincere and tender
loue of him, as the
fountaine of all beautie and
fellicity, of which loue I
may gesse by these signes.
                  
                     
By often thinking, and an
earnest desire of God.
                  By sorrow of his absence,
and contentment, in consideration
of his presence.
                  By my diligence in performing
without delay or tediousnesse,
that which pleaseth
best my Sauiour, and by
finding such cōfort in doing
it, that it grieues me when
for thinges of lesse goodnes,
I am enforced to deferre it.
                  By withdrawing all disordred
loue from all creatures,
and especially my selfe, and
by louing nothing but in
God, and for God.
                  By seeking to encrease
this loue by consideration of
Gods goodnesse, & his dailie
benefites.
                  By taking delight in Gods

seruice, or thinges tending
therunto, not because I finde
contentment in it, but because
it is to Gods glory, to
the which I would haue all
thinges addressed.
                  By taking tribulations, or
troubles of body or mind
patiently, yea and with ioie,
knowing that they come by
Gods permission, and thinking
them as fauours which
he affordeth to his dearest
friends.
               
               
                  The Second Affection.
                  THe second affection is,
a reuerent and dutifull
feare of God, which I may
gather by these signes.
                  If when I remember the
presence and Maiestie of

God, I frame both my body
and minde to reuerence and
honour him, with all humilitie
and decencie: fearing
least by any vnseemely and
light behauiour, I should
seeme to be contemptuous,
and carelesse of my duty towards
him.
                  If I finde great feare to doe
any thing that may offend
God, not onely mortally,
but euen venially, & be withall
verie watchfull to auoid
the least offence, least my
fra
                        •
                     lty which is great, should
drawe me to it, and so to further
inconuenience.
                  If I feare to bee banished
from him, or forsakē for my
sinnes, and endeuour what
I may to preserue his loue
and mercy towards me.
               
               
                  
                  The Third Affection.
                  THe third affection is,
Zeale of Gods honour,
and desire that hee should be
duely serued and obeyed of
all his creatures, of which I
may iudge by these signes.
                  First, if I finde a griefe in
my selfe and am hartily sory,
when I see or heare of other
folkes faults, or thinke of
mine owne, considering
how by them, a base and
wretched creature, dishonoured
and dispised his creator,
in steed of him, seruing
his professed enemies, the
flesh, the world, & the diuel.
                  The second signe is an
earnest desire to helpe my
neighbour, or mine owne
soule out of sinne, by praying

for this effect, and refusing
no conuenient labour to
accomplish the same, so that
my Lord God bee no more,
or at the least, lesse offended
then before.
               
               
                  The Fourth Affection.
                  THe fourth affection is,
to endeuour as neere as
I can, to take occasion of
euery thing that I heare, see,
or think of, to praise God.
As if the things were good,
then to praise God that he
gaue grace to doe them: And
if the thinge
                        •
                      were euill, to
thanke God that either he
preserued me or other, from
them, or at the least hath not
suffered me to continue still
in thē, or to bee in his wrath
condem
                        •
                     ed for them.
                  
                     
Also I must consider, and
with my inward eye see God
in euerie creature, how he
worketh in all things to my
benefitte, and weigh how in
all c
                        •
                     eatures, both within
and without me, he sheweth
his p
                        •
                     esence, by keeping
them in their beeing and
course of nature: for without
him they would presently
turne to nothing: and
I must assure my selfe, that in
all this, hee hath as well a
regard to my good, as to
others. And therefore all
creatures must be as it were
bookes to me to reade therin,
the lou
                        •
                      presence, prouidence,
and fatherly care that
God hath ouer me.
               
               
                  
                  The Fift Affection.
                  THe fift affection is, to
consider, that I being a
Christian, and onely my faith
and all mine actions proper
thereunto, ought not onely
to be different from the erroneous
opinions, sects, and
actions of infidels, but euen
mine ordinarie actions, of
eating, drinking, playing,
working, and such like,
ought to haue a marke and
badge of christianitie, and
some difference from the
like thinges done by heathens.
And this marke which
maketh christian and good
workes, is a right and sincere
intention, which in
euery principall action I
ought to procure, so that it

bee done to the honour,
g
                        •
                     orie, and seruice of God,
and agreeable to the rule of
christian dutye, with that
measure, temperance, and
circumstance, which faith
and reason requireth: perswading
my selfe, that as wel
in these actions done in this
sorte, as in others that carry
more shew of piety, God
may be serued & honoured.
And therfore it should be a
great negligence and carelesnes
in me, for want of
directing mine intention
(which by vse is easely gotten)
to lose so many great
merites, as in these ordinary
actions I might daily and
howerly gaine.
               
               
                  The Sixt Affection.
                  THe sixt Affection is, a

Perfect resignation of
my selfe into Gods hands,
with a full desire that he
should vse me as it were
most to his glorie, whether
it were to my temporall
comfort or no. And to bee
as ready to serue him in misery,
need, and affliction, as
in prosperity and pleasure:
thinking it my cheifest delighte,
to be vsed as God
wil, and to haue his pleasure
and prouidence fully accomplished
in me, which is
the end for which I was
created, and for the which I
doe now liue.
                  To attaine this resignation,
it is a very fitte way to
debate and discourse with
my selfe, what thing there is
could happen vnto me,

though neuer so much against
my liking, which if it
should fall out, would trouble
me, or make me loose
that indifferency which I
ought to haue, in most willingly
yeeldinge my selfe to
whatsoeuer God shall laye
vppon me: And if I finde any
thinge which I thinke I
should not well digest, nor
accept with due patience, let
me endeuour to ouercome
my selfe in it, and by praie
                        •
                     
and meditation▪ seeke to
winne the difficulty therof,
that there may be nothing
which I would not willingly
accept at Gods handes, how
contrary soeuer it were to
mine inclination. To which
these considerations may
helpe me.
                  
                     First the ende I ayme at, is
Gods glorie in this world,
and his reward in the next,
and therfore knowing that
nothing, but my voluntarie
sinne can barre me from this
ende, what neede I much
care by what meanes God
will haue me to attaine it?
for the meanes can last but a
litle, and the end endureth
for euer, and is so much the
more comfortable, in that it
hath beene atchiued with
more discomfortable, toiles.
                  Secondly God loueth mee
more then I loue my selfe,
and is so wise, that he best
seeth what is fittest for me,
all present & future circumstances
considered: he is so
mighty that what his wisdome
and loue shall conclude

for my good, his power can
put in execution: and therfore
let me rather yeeld my
selfe wholy to his prouidence,
then mine owne desires.
                  Thirdly whatsoeuer moueth
me to feare or dislike
any thing, which I could not
frame my minde to beare,
God seeth it as wel and farre
better then I, yea and all
other secret and vnkowen
hazardes that are annexed to
that thing: if therefore he
knowing all these thinges,
will neuerthelesse let it happen
to me, I must assure my
selfe, that it proceedeth of
loue, and is for my greater
good, and that he hauing
laid a heauy burden vpon
weake forces, will by his
grace supply all my feares,

wants and frailties.
               
               
                  The Seuenth Affection.
                  THe seuenth affection
is, gratitude and thankfulnes,
which I ought to finde
in my selfe towards God,
and feeling an earnest desire
to doe any thing that might
counteruaile, or in parte
aunswere the excessiue loue
that God, hath and howerly
doth shew vnto me, and to
let no litle good that I receiue
thoughe neuer so ordinarie,
passe without thankes
to him, who euen in the least
things is contented to serue
me▪ and finally to make God
my repose, and his remembrance
my comfort, and to
loath al earthly things as base
and vnpleasant, in comparison

of him.
               
            
            
               Of my duety to my Superiours.
               THE THIRD
Chapter.
               NExt my duty to God, it
behoueth me to consider
my due
                     •
                  ie to my Superiours,
whom I must accoūt
as his Vicegerents, & substitutes
in the thinges wherein
I am subiecte vnto them.
               And first to speake of
those which are my superiours
in temporall thinges,
in all pointes belonging to
their charge, I am to yeeld
them temporall duty, contenting
my selfe with their
appointment, so farre as
with iustice and equity they
can command, and by Gods
lawes I shall be bound to

yeeld vnto them.
               And for my spirituall superiours,
whom I am to account
as guides of my soule,
a farre better part then the
body. First I must procure
that my choice be of vertuous,
graue, and mortified
mē, who hauing their owne
passions well subdued, may
the better teach me how to
bridle mine. And because it
is the chiefe helpe and most
profitable, if my choise bee
good, and very dangerous if
it be euill, I must make my
choise with greate aduise
and deliberation, vsing the
counsaile of some other persons
of good and grounded
iudgement in such things.
               When I haue a man of
discretion and good gouernement,

and experienced in
directinge of soules, I must
behaue my selfe towardes
him in this sort.
               First, I must procure to
loue him as a parent or father,
by which name such
men in the Church of God
are called, endeuouring to
cary my selfe towards him,
as dutifully (not onely in
spirituall things, but also in
those temporall wherin, I
might iustly feare any sinne)
as a well nurtured childe behaueth
him selfe toward his
naturall father: and seeking
to make him take an affection
and desire to direct me
with great ioy, diligence and
care, to all spirituall good.
               Secondlie, I must reuerence
and honour him as the

Vincegerent of God, & consider
Christ in his person,
and do my duety to him, as
if in him I did see Christ, taking
heede of any such familiarity
or surlinesse, as may
and vsually doth breed contempt,
and alwaies carrying
my selfe with due respecte
to his function and office,
and hauing mine eye more
bent vpon that, then either
his person, calling or other
temporall or spirituall qualities.
Thirdly, I must auoid
such things as maie cause in
me any vniust discontentmentes
or dislike toward
                     •
                  s
him: and therfore interprete
his doings and sayinges in
the best sort, not giuing rash
iudgement of them, but rather
seekinge to excuse his

faultes, if he haue any: and
in my daily prayers to commend
him to God, and pray
that God may graunt him
grace, iudgemēt & discretiō,
and the assistance of his spirit
that thereby he may direct
me, as is most for Gods glorie,
and my soules health.
               Fourthly, to obey him in
al things wherin I see not any
expresse sinne, taking his
wordes when hee counsaileth,
commandeth, or forbiddeth
me any thing, as the
words of Christ; agreable to
the saying of our Sauiour: He
that heareth you, heareth me,
and he that dispiseth you dispiseth
me. Wherfore if he reprehend
me I must take it patiently
with desire of amēdmēt,
& what he ēioineth me,

willingly must I performe▪
though it be against mine
owne will, sense, or liking.
               To conclude, my obedience
towardes him, or rather
towardes Christs person in
him, for whom in all things
I obey, ought to be done
with these conditions. Speedely
without delay. Voluntarily
without constraint.
Simply without questions
or excuses. Contētedly without
murmuring or grudging.
Stoutly without despaire or
impatience. Constantly with
perseuerance to the end.
Humbly without pride.
               I ought also to perswade
my self, that God of his great
goodnes, by him will direct
me in such thinges as appertaine
to his direction, and

will put such things in his
minde, as shall bee most for
my benefite and good, and
therefore must I resolue to
laie my soule in his handes,
and to frame my iudgement
to his in all thinges, that hee
shall thinke fitte for me to
doe or omit, where I see no
danger of sinne, perswading
my selfe, that though the
man be imperfect, yet God
whose Vicegerent & instrument
he is, neither will, not
can deceiue me.
            
            
               Of my duety towardes my
neighbour.
               THE FOVRTH
Chapter.
               AFter knowledge of my
duety towards God &
my Superiours, I must consider

my duety towardes my
neighbour, and the manner,
how to behaue my selfe in
his company & conuersatiō.
               First I must procure to remember,
that my externall
behauiour, my gate, my gesture,
my countenance, and
my outward actions, be
donne with grauitie, modestie,
and all decencie: that I
be not light, vaine, or too
lauish in mirth, not too austere,
or too much inclined
to sadnesse, but with temperate
modestie rather composed
to mirth, than melancholy.
Which external composition
is necessary both for
edi
                     •
                  ying our neighbour, who
being vnable to iudge or enter
into our thoughts, iudgeth
of euery one according

to that where of his sense is
witnesse. And next in respect
of God, who being euery
where present, requireth in
vs behauiour worthy of his
sight and company: & lastly,
in respect of our owne soule,
this care of externall decencie
being an approued meanes
to auoyde infinite veniall
sinnes, and much more all
mortall.
               Of externall composition
there be three chiefe points.
               First the care of our countenance,
ga
                     •
                  e, and gesture.
Secondly of our voice and
speech. Thirdly of our apparell
and other adherents.
               In countenance, I must
auoide an vnst
                     •
                  ied kind of
variety and often change,
keeping, as neere as I mai
                     •
                  ,

one setled tenor therof, rather
bent to smiling thē heauinesse,
and free from 
                     •
                  rowning▪
and such like vnseemlie
distemper Neither ought
I to al
                     •
                  er my coun
                     •
                  enāce, but
when reasonable and iust
cause mooueth me to shew
either mirth, sorrow, dislike,
or compassion, or some other
modest or temperat affectiō.
               My gate ought to bee graue,
neither too swift nor too
slow, but with a meane and
sober pace: my gesture must
be decent, free from affectation,
or singularity, and from
all shew of inward disquietnes
or vnordred passion,
which though I cānot choose
but sometime feele, yet it

                     〈◊〉
                   good as much as I may to
conceale it, because outward

signes do feede the inward
distemper, and bewray to others
my imperfections to
my discredite, and their
                     •
                  
euel example.
               My voice neither ought
to be verie loude, nor my
laughter so vehement as to
be heard a farre off, but both
seemlie and modest, for excesse
in the voice, and immoderate
lowdne
                     •
                  , are alwaies
certaine signes of passion, &
therefore ought to be vsed
but vpon some extraordinarie
necessity.
               My speech ought not to
be so much, as to make me
be noted for talkatiue, yea it
is good to be rather sparing
in wordes, and readier to
heare, then to speake. But
whē occasiō forceth to much

talke, I must speake deliberately
without rashenesse or leuity,
auoiding ouer-many
iests, especially bitter taunts
and sharpe words. I must also
take heed of affected speach
and impertinent ceremonies,
and vse such affability and
conuenient complements, as
common ciuility and vsuall
curtesie requireth.
               Mine apparel must be free
from lightnesse, or more
gawdines thē fitteth my age,
calling, or company. It must
be decent, and comely, not
too open, nor with vnusuall
or newe fashioned dresses,
that other graue persons of
my quality and calling,
(that are well thought of)
do not vse: It must be handsome
and cleane, and as

much as may bee without
singularity, that therein
the staiednes and seemely
estate of my soule, may bee
perceiued.
               Alwaies when I am to goe
to any company, either of
my dwelling place, or strangers,
I ought to forecast their
disposition, and what talke
or action is likely to be tendered
vnto me by their presence.
If I feare detracting
speeches, let mee arme my
selfe not to seeme to approue
them, yea rather to mislike
them, and to turne the talke
to some other matter, and
so in all other kind of vnlawfull
talke.
               Finallie let this for conuersation
be my chiefe rule,
alwaies to foresee and prouide

                  
                     〈1 page duplicate〉
                  
                  
                  
                     〈1 page duplicate〉
                  
                  
my selfe against the occasions,
that by euerie company
are likely to be offered
me, and in the beginning to
talke either for dispatch of
necessarie businesse, if there
be any, or for maintaining
mutual loue and charity, if it
be mery, or ordinary talke.
               This fore-sight of occasions,
and faults likely to be
committed, is the principall
remedy against all sinne, and
therfore especially to be noted
and vsed.
               To conclude, the vertues
necessary in conuersation, are
modesty, decency, affability,
meeknes, ciuility, & curtesy,
shew of compassiō to others
miseries, and of ioy at their
welfare, and of readinesse to
pleasure all, and vnwillinges

to displease any; and the wāt
of any of these, where occasion
requireth, make
                     •
                  h conuersation

               The vices chiefly to be auoided
are, pride disdainefulnes,

                     •
                  , or, lightnes, too
much 
                     •
                  amiliarity, churlishnes,
and offensiue speeches.
            
            
               Of my duety towardes my
selfe.
               THE FIFTH
Chapter.
               THe last point is to consider
my duty towards
my selfe, & the care I ought
to haue of mine owne particular.
               First I must procure that
which before is mentioned,
in all my actions to haue the

badge of christianity: that is
a pure and sincere affection
and intention, not seeking
in any thinge my owne delight,
pleasure, and contentment,
more then may stand
with the honour & glory of
God, remembring that I am
to serue him and not my
selfe, more then is necessary
to inable me for his better
seruice, I being his more then
mine owne.
               Secondly I must procure to
foresee in euery action, at the
lest in al the principal, to fore
arme my selfe against those
occasions of sinne which shal
be offered in them: & where
it lieth not in my power to
auoide the occasion of any
greate sinne, the more danger
there is, and the greater

the sinne is that I am in daunger
of, so much the more preparation
must I vse to resist
it, and the more earnestly
aske for Gods grace.
               Thirdly I must haue care
of my sences, as the meanes
and entrance of temptatiōs.
To which it is a principall
helpe, not to bee easely
drawen with euery noise or
phansy to mooue my head
or eyes, excepte there be
good cause: nor to be suddaine
in motion, or going
hither and thither, without
deliberation. I must also remember
well, that the eie is
neuer satisfied with seeing,
nor the eares with hearing
nouelties, and therfore must
I needs bridle the vnmeasurable
appetite of both these

senses, by breaking of mine
owne desires in that behalfe.
               Fourthly because confusion,
and an vnsetled kind of
life, is the cause of many
sinnes, and an enemy to all
vertue, I must set downe
with my selfe some certaine
order in spendinge my time,
alotting to euery hower in
the day, some certaine thing
to bee done in the same, so
neere as possibly I may, or at
the least to haue sometimes
in the morning, euening, &
afternoone, certainely deuoted
to some good ex
                     •
                  rcise,
which I must (though
not by vow) after a sort
binde my selfe vnto, when
things of greater weight do
not call me from them. Also
to keepe due times of rising,

meales, and going to
bed, and all other ordinary times:
the obseruation wherof
is most necessary for a regular
& vertuous order of lif.
               Fithly it is a moste necessary
rule of good life, not
onely to keepe order in my
temporall and spirituall actions,
but also to perseuer and
continue in one order, hauing
once set it downe with
sound aduise. For the nature
of man being apt to change,
we are giuen still to nouelties,
seeking newe waies to
perfection, and confirming
or habituating our selues in
none: wherefore (except necessity,
charity, or greater
spirituall good doe require) I
must not flit from one exercise
to another, from one

ghostly father to another,
from on forme of behauiour
to another, but first plante a
good plat-forme with mature
aduise, and then resolue
and fully determine to continue
in the same.
               Sixtlie I must not cumber
my mind with many spiritual
or externall exercises at once,
nor labour my selfe to much
at the first, for my force being
distracted to many offices, is
the lesse able to performe
any of them, and is easily ouer-labored
without profit:
wherfor I must not thinke
to get all vertues at once, or
cut off all imperfections together,
but hauing a generall
resolution to gette vertue,
and leaue all vice, begin with
some one, endeuouring to

endeuouring to breake my
self of some one fault, which
I am most inclined vnto, and
procuring to get the cōtrarie
vertue: for the care of auoiding
one offence, will make
me take heed of all the rest.
               Seuēthly mās nature beeing
so corrupted, that without
continuall violence & force,
it cannot attaine to vertu, or
leaue vice, wherunto it is
much inclined, I must assure
myself that care & watchfulnes
is euer necessary: and because
I am apte to fall, I must
often renue my good purposes,
which for that it is a materiall
point, it will be good
to sette downe with my selfe
these rules.
               First to appoint and set
downe with my selfe, that

euery morning one of my
first thoughts shal bee of the
good purposes I haue made,
which must not be many,
but some one or two particuler
and principall points that
I see most necessary for me,
and to set downe also in the
morning, at what times in
the day I will remember the
same, as at seruice, at dinner,
at euensong, or such like times,
for the care to remember
them at some certaine times,
wil make me stilmindful
of them, and so readier
to performe them.
               Secondly to examine my
selfe twice in a day, whether
I haue broken them since the
morning or no: and if I haue,
then to be so
                     •
                  e for it, and
begin againe to fortify my

selfe better against the next
occasion.
               Thirdly because I can neuer
goe on in vertu without
falling, I must euery morning,
or at least euery holiday,
thinke with my selfe
that hitherto I haue done nothing,
and that, by Gods
grace, that day I will beginne
a freshe, as though it were
the first day that euer I began
to do any good thing.
               Fourthly to celebrate the
daie of my conuersion euery
yeare as a solemne day, and
as the day of my birth, wherin
I was brought forth and
dedicated to God, and therin,
and in some other principal
fea
                     ••
                  es in the yeare, to
to calle to minde the first feruour,
deuotion, and zeale,

that God did then giue mee,
and this I ought to doe very
often a
                     •
                   other times also.
               Eightly, I must not make
smale account of little sinnes,
not bee careles in committing
thē, but alwaies carry
that minde, that I would not
offende God willingly, euen
in the least veniall sinnes for
any thing: and I must neuer
thinke any thing little, wherwith
so high a maiesty is offended.
For one that careth
not to committ little sinnes,
giueth the diuell a great aduantage,
to drawe him into
greater.
               Ninthly, as I must take heed
of pampering my body too
much, & ought to take some
ordinarie corporall punishmēt,
as of fasting, discipline,

haire-cloth, or the like: fo on
the other side, I must haue
care of my health, & so temper
all my spirituall exercises
and bodily afflictions with
discretion, that I maie continue
in them stil, & not make
my selfe vnable to perseuer
long, by the vndiscreet greedines
of a short time, and to
vse discretion▪ these obseruations
will auaile.
               First, before God to thinke
whether dooing this or that,
I may be able to continue my
vndertaken course in his seruice,
my body, force, health,
and other cares, comber
                     •
                  , or
businesses considered.
               Secondly, to aske counsaile
of spiritual men, long practised
in spirituall affaires.
               Thirdly, to reade spirituall

bookes, intreating of that
which I designe to doe.
               Fourthly, to pray that God
with his light and grace,
would lighten my hart, to
knowe and performe that
which is fittest for me, and
most to his glory.
            
            
               An order how to spende
euery day.
               THE SIXTE
Chapter.
               IN time of health howers
of going to bed and rising,
may be either nine and
fiue, or tenne and sixe, or according
to the strength or
weaknes of euery mans body,
so they be certaine.
               After I am vp for a good
prety space, it is good not to
talke, but at the least for

halfe a quarter of an houre
to busy my mind in praier &
meditation, and then to talke
if need be: because my busines
with God being greater
than with any man, it is fitt
that hee should first be talked
with of matters concerning
my soule, and thē others
of worldly things,
               I must procure to goe neatlie
and handsome in my attire,
agreablie to my calling▪
and to auoide all kind of indecency
which breedeth dislike
and contempt, & dooth
rather offend, than please
God: when I am ready I must
goe to my praiers appointed.
And before I set my selfe to
pray, I must call to minde
what I promised to doe for
anie at that time, or what

other necessary busines I
haue thē to dispatch, & I must
keepe touch i
                     •
                   my wordes
in the least thinges, & cut off
occasions of being interrupted
as nere as I may. In praier
I must obserue these thinges.
               In the first beginning, I am
to consider the presence of
God and of his Saints.
               Secondly, for the better
procuring of attētion, to take
my good Angell, or some other
Saint, as it were, to say
with me.
               Thirdly, I must thinke a
few, well saide, better then
many hastiely shufled ouer.
It is good sometime to omitt
some vocall praiers, and to
spend the time in meditation
of some part of Christes
passion, or of his life, or of

mine owne sinnes, as the
booke of meditation giueth
notice.
               After praier, on woorking
daies, I must go presently about
some woork or exercise
that may be of some profitte,
and of all other things, take
heede of idlenes the mother
of all vices.
               Towardes eleuen (if company
& other more weighty
causes will permit) I may say
my beades, and call to mind
how I haue spent the morning,
asking God grace to
spend the afternoone better.
               Dinner times, on flesh
daies, may be eleuen: on fasting
daies, towards twelue
of the clocke: When I am
called to dinner, I must
thinke for what ende I am

to eate, that is to helpe nature,
and not to content
mine owne appetite.
               I must learne my little
children (if I haue any) to
say some short grace, or at
the least, I must say grace to
my selfe: and when I am set,
before I lay hande to my
trencher, I many pause a
while, and in my mind desire
God to giue me temperance,
and mind
                     •
                  ulnes of his
presence.
               At meales I must neither
bee too curious or doubtful
of what I eate, neither too
precise in the quantitie finenes,
or coursnes of the meate,
but of that which God hath
sent, take a cōpetent meale,
measurable to my neede, &
not hurtfull to my health.
               
                  
After dinner I must thāke
God for his gifts, remembring
that he hath fed me
for this end, that I shoulde
be more able to serue him,
and doe my duety▪ and when
I retire to my chamber, it is
good to say some short prayer
of thankesgiuing, desiring
God to make mee
thankfull for all his benefits.
               I must remember that many
haue wanted that which
I haue had, and woulde haue
beene glad of my leauings:
and therfore I ought to haue
care and regard of the poore,
procuring somethinge for
them, & some times goeing
my selfe to see them serued,
considering Christ in their
persons.
               If I haue straungers I may

keep them company, & talke
friendly & merily with them
as occasion shall serue, directing
my behauiour agreable
to my former rules of conuersation,
and hauing this intention
in my talke, that amity
and loue may bee maintained,
and all breach & vnkindnes
auoided.
               I must, if time and place
will permit me, be alwaies
doing some profitable thinge,
to auoide slouth, directing
mine intention in all
my exercises to this end, that
I may auoide idlenes, and
temptations, and bestowe
my time in good sort to
Gods glorie.
               After dinner, I must call to
mind, whether I haue any
promise to performe, or any

other busines to do that is
not ordinary: that I neither
forget the thinge, nor time
appointed for it.
               About three of the clocke
in winter, and fou
                     •
                  e in sommer,
I may go to Euensong,
and vse the same order of my
morning ptaier. It is good
for me sometimes to goe about
the roomes of the house,
and to see that they be
kept cleane, and handsome,
thinking that God is delighted
in cleanenesse, both bodily
and ghostly, & detesteth
sluttishnesse, as a thinge
which he permitteth as a punishment
of sinne, and one
of the scourges of hell.
               A little before supper, it
will be good to read some
parte of some good booke,

procuring to take some benefitte
by it▪ and continuing
in one book vntil I haue read
it ouer, and then begin some
new: and if I haue any booke
that I would oftē read, I may
take some time from my
worke, or the holy daies▪ to
reade a part thereof: but the
time before supper, it is good
to spend in continuing that
which I haue begun, and
when one is ended, to begin
an other: When company
hindereth me from doing
these things at their due times,
I need not be much
troubled for omitting the
rest, so that my praiers be
saied: but in such occu
                     ••
                  ants
in steed of that I should haue
done▪ I must seeke to make
my conuersatiō meritorious,

by hauing a good intention,
and often renuing of the same,
and by watchfulnes to
auoid all offence of God, leauing
him in one exercise, to
serue him in an other, as he
apointeth occasiōs to fal out.
               Supper time maie be sixe,
& drinking times on fasting
daies, seauen of the clocke.
When I am called to supper
I must remember what my
intention ought to be, and to
take the same course that is
prescr
                     ••••
                  d for dinner.
               After supper, I may talke
as occasion shall serue, or
walk for my health, or read
some pleasant, yet profitable
booke, as Catholik histories,
or such like.
               Towards the howre of
going to bed, I mu
                     ••
                  e examne

my selfe, first whether my
promises, or appointments
concerninge extraordinary
things and busines, be performed:
if I haue forgotten
any necessary thing, I must
take order to remember it,
that I forget it not the second
time.
               This done, I must examine
my conscience touching the
thoughtes, wordes, & deedes
of that day, & especially concerning
the purposes that I
haue made in the morninge,
and how I haue obserued
these rules, and what faultes
I haue committed of any
moment.
               After I haue examined my
conscience, and saied my
prayers, it is good to abstaine
from talke that nighte

(vnlesse some iuste occasion
require the contrary) that
my mind may bee free from
idle thoughtes, when I goe
to sleepe.
               When I lie downe to rest,
my intention must not bee
so much for sloth, and contentment
of the body, a
                     •
                   for
necessity of keepinge my
health, & that I may rise fitter
to serue God.
               Also when I lie downe, I
may imagin to lie by the pilar,
crosse, maunger, or some
such place, where Christ
was present, that when I
wake in the morning he may
bee the first that shall come
into my mind.
               Before I sleepe, I must say
some short thinge to commende
my selfe to God, my

good Angell, and some other
Saints, and purpose by their
helpe when the time of rising
cometh, not to suffer
my selfe to be ouercome
with floth, but as though
Christ called me, spedily to
rise. I must also then sett
downe where vpon I will
thinke as soone as I awake,
that God may haue the first
fruits of my thoughts, for
which the diuell layeth greate
wayte.
               
                  On holy daies.
                  I Must rise one howre, or
halfe an houre, sooner
then on other daies: And if
it be a day of receiuing, my
first thought must bee to
thinke what a happy bāquet
I am to goe vnto, desiring

God to giue me due preparation.
I must seeke to say my
prayers that day both more,
and with greater deuotion,
and especially after the communion.
                  In steed of my work, I must
bestowe those daies in reading
good bookes, hearing
sermons, and such like godly
exercises, not lightly running
ouer thē, thinking it enough
to haue read or heard good
things, but pawsing vpō such
thinges as moue my affectiō,
and p
                        •
                     inting them wel in my
mind and memory.
                  Because I am like to be
troubled with cōpany more
those daies thē others. I must
endeuour to recompence in
this sort. First by often lifting
vp my hart to God in talke.

Secondly, by striuing against
occasions of euill speech, and
by not yeldinge to speake of
other folkes faultes. Thirdly,
in seekinge when occasiō
serueth to helpe those I talke
with by mine example or
wordes, And finally to make
my talke agreeable to the rules
of conuersation.
                  On principall Feastes, it is
conuenient to prepare my
selfe before hand for them, &
to liue a day or two before,
as it were in expectation of
them, desiring the presence
and solemnity of that day,
wherein God doth most aboundantly
bestowe his graces:
that hauing heretofore
bene slacke in his seruice,
I may that day beginne of
newe, to take hart and courage,

to amend my life by
the helpe and prayers of that
Saint, or by the meritte and
benefitte of that action of
Christ, the holy day shall, be.
               
               
                  For Confession and Receiuinge.
                  EVery sonday; and high
feast, and all the festiual
daies of Christ, our Lady,
the Apostles, and such other
principall holy daies, I must
prepare my selfe the day before
to receiue.
                  On Saterdaie at night, or
on the eue if occasion serue, I
must go to confession, and
withall diligence, the neerer
the time commeth of receauing,
the more wary must I
be of my behauiour▪ I must

go to confession twice in a
weeke, Wednesday and Saterday
at night, when there
commeth not a great holy
day, or some other day:
                  When I want meanes to
goe to confession, I must notwithstanding
at my vsuall times
prepare my selfe, and to
almighty God make euen in
wordes the same confession,
that I would to my ghostly
father: for though it bee not
a Sactament without absolution
of a true Pre
                        •
                     st, yet is it a
godly thing, & good to keep
me in vre, and my conscience
in awe▪
                  
                  Euery yeare twice, once
about Christmas, if I may,
vpon Newyeers day, or Epiphany,
and another time about
S. Mary Magdalens day.

I must make a generall confession
of the halfe yeare last
past: & so from time to time,
taking those two times especiallie
to renewe my selfe,
& to remember Gods goodnesse
towardes me, and to
beginne with newe feruor
more earnestly to serue him,
as my duety and his benefits
require. I must also compare
one time with an other, and
see whether I goe forward or
backwards in Gods seruice,
and endeuour euery halfe
yeare, to gaine some ground
of my selfe, and to amend
some one imperfection.
                  When I make my generall
confession, if I haue one
certaine ghostly father, I must
yeild vp an account of my
conscience concerning th
                        •
                     se

points following. First how
I find my selfe affected in
Gods ser
                        ••
                     ce, and whether I
finde a con
                        •
                     entment and delight
therein, or rather a tediousnes
and dulnes.
                  Secondlie, what praiers I
vse to saie, and howe much
time I spende therein, and
what taste, or trouble I feele
in the same.
                  Thirdly, what temptations
and passions I am most troubled
withal, & what meanes
I doe vse to resist them.
                  Fourthlie, what imperfections
I am most prone vnto,
what vertu I cheifly labour
to attaine, and which I haue
most facility to practise.
                  Fiftly, what mortification
I doe vse to break mine own
will, and what other cha
                        ••
                     isement

to mortify my body.
                  Sixtly, what desire I finde
in my self, to amend my former
faultes, and to begin a
better course.
                  Seauenthly, how I find my
selfe for my resignation of
mind to Gods will, and for
suffering and losse, punishment,
sicknes, or disgrace
that he should lay vpon me.
                  Lastly, how my health is
aggreable to my exercises,
and whether I find not my
body or mind ouercharged
with too much praier, penance,
or such other actions
of deuotion. These thinges
are conuenient to be vttered,
that the pastour knowing
the estate, disease, force,
or weakenes of his sheepe,
may be the abler discreetly

                  Euery weeeke.
                  IN the beginning of the
weeke, I must fore

                     see
what holy daies there are in
the same, that I may the better
prepare my selfe for thē.
Also in the beginning of the
weeke, I must thinke whether
I haue any extraordinary
business, temporall or spirituall
to doe, that hauing a
foresight of it, I may remember
it and prouide the better
for it. When I reade my rules,
I may omitte the reading
of other bookes, vnlesse leisure
serue me to doe both.
                  I must twice a weeke at the
least, go see into the offices
of the house, and suruey the
houshold booke: but if I haue

the gouernemēt of it wholy

                  I must

               Of Rules in sickenesse.
               THE SEAVENTH
Chapter.
               IF my sicknesse be great,
I neede not vse any vocall
praiers at all, more then
in the morning to commend
my selfe to God with a 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                  
and Aue, and Creede: or if I
cannot well say so much,
now and then I must call
vpon God with short praiers,
as Lord Iesus saue me:
Lorde strengthen me: Lord
grant me patience, and such
like.
               In sicknesse when I can
beare it, it will be good sometimes,
to haue a part of
some good booke read vnto
me, but yet not much, for
feare▪ of hurting my health.
               
                  As in health I ought to be
obedient to my superiours &
by diligent obseruation of
my rules, to shew my duety
towardes God: so in my
sickenes I must be contented
to be ruled by the phisitions,
and such as haue ca
                     •
                  e
of me in thinges belonging
to my bodily health, & must
perswade my selfe, that in
that time, one chiefe rule I
haue to obserue, is to be patient
and tractable, which in
such case counteruaileth the
merite of all my vsuall exercises.
I must also assure my
selfe, that I doe God good
seruice, when I doe any necessarie
thing, and take any
conuenient recreation, that
may further my health.
               I must take heede of being

testy or froward, which
sicknes for the most part doth
cause, thinking that how
much paine soeuer I suffer,
Christ suffered far more for
my sake, and farre more had
I suffered long since in Hell,
if God had dealte with me as
I diserued.
               So soone as I fall sicke, I
must procure that I be confessed,
and if my sicknes continue
long I must keepe my
custome of receiuing, at the
lest euery eight daies, though
I must not think that I am
then bound to so much preparation
or praier, as when
my body was in good health.
               If I see my disease dangerous,
and haue cause to feare
deathe, I must procure to
haue some good body with

me too put me oftē in mind
of God, of the Passion of
Christ, and seeke to haue
my viaticum▪
                   and other Sacraments,
and preparations
of Gods Church. It is good
also to haue my will ready
before I fall to any extremity,
and a certaine order sette
downe, for all temporall
matters, that I be not cumbred
with then when it
standeth me most vpon to
looke to my sou

               Of the care of Seruants.
               THE EIGHT
Chapter.
               I Must see that they lie not
out in the nights, but that
I knowe what becometh of
them: I must not keepe such
as are great swearers, or giuen

to any great or notorious
vice, vnles there be
great likelyhood, & certaine
hope of their amendment. I
must procure by what meane
conueniētly I may, that they
may haue necessary instructiō
in matters apertaining to
the saluation of their soules.
               I must take special heed of
any secret meetings, messages,
or more then ordinary
liking, betwixt the men and
the women of my family. I
must see that the men haue
no haunte of womē to their
chambers, least lewdnesse
bee cloaked vnder some other
pretence.
               I must haue great regard,
that my chiefest officiers and
mē of most account be trusty
persons, of good life and example,

because the rest will
follow as they shal lead thē.
               I must seeke as much as
may be, that my seruants be
not idle, nor suffered to vse
any great gaming, sor by the
one they shal fall into lewed
life, by the other into swearing,
vnthri
                     •
                  tines, robbing
and such vices.
               I must see that they haue
their wages at due times,
least for want they fall into
bad courses. When they doe
not th
                     •
                  ir dueties, I must rebuke
them, agreablie to the
quality of their fault, and not
winke at great matters, lest
they wax carelesse, and bould
to do the like again yet must
my rebukes be 
                     •
                  ēpered with
grauity and mildnes.
            
            
               
               Of the care of my children.
               THE NINTH
Chapter.
               I Must thinke that my children,
so longe as they are
vnder age and in my power
or custody, ought to be kept
as my selfe; I hauinge in this
time to answere for them. I
must take heed they come
not amongest such seruantes
as are like to teach them to
sweare, or any other vice, and
I must giue speciall warning
that none doe it.
               I must set honest & sound
persons to gouerne thē, that
may also teach them vertue
and goodnes, yet not trusting
too much to my seruants care
but that I my self haue a speciall
eie ouer them, and take

an account what they doe.
               I must vse them to deu
                     •
                  
                  tion
by little and little, not
cloying them with too much
at once, but rather seeking
to make them take a delight
in it▪ I must teach them their,
Pater noste
                        •
                     . Aue, and Creed,
and other good praiers, and
make them perfecte in the
tenne Commaundementes,
and those of the church, and
the points of faith, especially
those that heretikes denie.
               I mu
                     •
                  t keepe them alwaies
occupied in some profitable
thing, allotting them according
to their age, more or
lesse time to play: I must often
speak to them of the Passion
of Christ, and of the liues
of Saintes.
               I muste on the one side

breake them from their wils,
and punishe them as they deserue,
yet remembring also
that they are young, and not
keeping them in too much
subiection, which may breed
in them base and seruile
mindes, and make their loue
lesse towardes me: and I neuer
ought to beate any childe
in mine anger.
               I must procure that they
bee taught such exercises
and qualities, as are fit for
those of their degree, and
yet haue a chiefe care, that
good and honest persons be
about them.
               I must not vse them to
vaine dresses and costlie appa
                     •
                  ell,
but rather often shew
them the vanity thereof: yet
must they not bee kept too

straite in that or any other
thing, that they are afterwarde
to haue, lest they being
too much bard from it,
make them too eager of it,
when they come to enioy it
at their owne will.
               I must vse them to giue
almes, to make much of the
poore, and to vse reuerence
to aged persons, and spirituall
men, and praise often
the true religion and vertu
of their parentes, and auncestours
in their hearing, that
it may moue them to imitate
their good workes. I must
tell them often of the Abbies,
and the vertue of the
olde Monkes and Friers, and
other Priestes, and religious
men and women, and of the
truth and honesty of the old

time, & the iniquity of ours.
I must vse them to read good
bookes, that are fittest for
their capacity, and see them
kept from vaine bookes of
loue, heresy, and such like
               I must harten them often
as they grow in yeares to suffer
aduersity, and to digest
grief, especially in Gods cause
& a good quarel, telling them
the examples of others, and
how good a thing patience
and constancie is.
               When they are fit to goe
to schoole, I must procure
that they haue discreete and
calme teachers, and such as
are not cholericke, hasty, or
curst, lest they take dislike
and tediousnes in learning &
they must be rather wonne
vnto it by praise and emulation

of others, then by beating
and stripes▪ I must see
that they be taught such ciuility,
curtesy, & complementes,
as their degree
                     •
                  , and the
time requireth: & frame them
as much as may be, to be gē
                  tle,
humble, & affable euē to
the meanest, rebuking them
for angrie and sharp wordes,
or disdainful behauiour, euen
to their inferiours.
               I must be times as age will
permitte them, inure them
in confession, and often vse
of the Sacramētes, the onely
remedy for their vnstaied and
greene wittes. I muste not
let the boies and girles be
much together, especially
out of sight, after eighte and
nine yeares age, least they fal
to vnhappines. Likewise my

daughters, must not be much
amongest the men, nor my
sonnes amōgest the women.
               When they come to such
age as they must of force bee
in many companies, I must
procure some sounde and
honest persons to bee for the
most part with them, to informe
me of their courses. I
must make them in any wise
to beware of lewd conuersation,
which is the ouerthrowe
of youth, and therfore
cause this pointe to bee
beaten into them by good &
zealous men.
               I must neuer assure or marry
them, vntill they bee of sufficient
age to make their
choice, and frame their likeinge:
neither force them to
any match least they curse me

all their liues after, as it often
happeneth.
            
            
               Of Temptation.
               THE TENTH
Chapter.
               FIrst I must learne to
know when I am tempted,
for if I can find my tempta
                     •
                  ion▪
I may reckon it halfe
ouercome. For if I haue feare
of God, or care of my soule,
I cannot but arme my selfe
earnestly to resist, knowing
that temptation proceedeth
from an enemy, to whome
I haue resolued by Gods grace
neuer to consent, what
misery or trouble soeuer I
endure,
               
                  How to know temptations and
good motions.
                  IT is alwaies a spirituall

desolation originall and proceeding
from the diuell, whē
it darkeneth and disqu
                        •
                     eteth
the mind, awaketh and stirreth
vppe our passions, when
it draweth to externall and
earthlie solaces, leauing in
the mind a tediousnes and
vnwillingnes to praier and
other workes of deuotion.
                  Also when it diminisheth
our affiance and trust in God,
and d
                        •
                     iueth to a kinde of dispaire
of Gods mercy, or perseuering
in his seruice, making
it seeme an irkesome &
impossible thing, & mouing
vs to forsake it: and when I
finde my self troubled in this
sort, I must assure my selfe
without all doubt, that I am
tempted by the d
                        •
                     uell, and
therefore arme my selfe to

resist him, by doing that
which those temptati
                        ••
                      disswade
me from.
                  On the other side, comforte
that is caused by Gods
spiritt, is knowen by these
signes: it incenseth the mind
by a quiet & calme motion,
to the loue of God, without
any inclination to any creatures
loue, more then for Gods
only glory, and it breedeth a
kind of inward light and
brightnes, wherby for the
time the mind seeth after a
most effectuall sort, the necessity,
profit, and true comfort
that is in Gods seruice,
and conceiueth a contempt
and dislike of worldly delightes,
& tasteth that which
is the greatest felicity in this
life, that is so assured and perfect

contentmēt in beeing in
God
                        •
                      grace, and seeking to
please him, that it then iudgeth
no contentement in the
world like or cōparable vnto
it, as in truth there is none.
                  Also true spirituall comforte
bringeth a deligh
                        •
                     e and
desire to thinke of the benefittes
of God, the io
                        •
                     es of
Heauen, the comfort of meditation
& talking with God.
Finally it confirmeth our
faith, quickneth our hope,
and increaseth charity, and
leaueth the mind with a
sweet taste of ioy, quiet and
free from all cumbers.
                  Somtimes the diuel transformeth
him self into an Angell
of light, and at the first
when he knoweth our good
desires and purposes, he seemeth

to sooth vs in them, &
to set vs forward towardes
the performance thereof, but
in the end he draweth vs to
his biasse, and by corrupting
our intention, or by peruerting
the maner, time, or other
circumstance of the due executions,
maketh the whole
action worthles and faulty,
though other wise vertuous
in it selfe.
                  There must be great heed
taken in the beginning, middle,
and ende of our thoughtes:
for when either at the
last it tendeth to apparent
sinne, or withdraweth from
the greater good▪ or tendeth
to courses of lesse merit, or
more daunger then wee are
in, or if it disquiet the minde,
or be
                        •
                     eaue it of the

won
                        •
                     ed calme and loue of
vertue, it is a signe that the
diuel was the beginner of it,
whose property is to hinder
good & withdraw vs to euil.
                  When in any suggestion I
find the serpent by his sting,
that is the diuell, by the wicked
ende he mooueth me
vnto, it is good to vntwist &
reuerse his motion, and to
looke backwarde euen vnto
the beginning, and to marke
what plausible coulour he
first pretented, that the next
time I may the better espie
his cunning, subtill dealing,
and driftes.
               
               
                  Howe to behaue our
                        •
                      selues in
time of Temptations.
                  IN the time of my desolation
and disquiet of mind,
I must not enter into any deliberation,

or goe about to
alter any thing concerninge
the state of my soule, or purposed
course of life, but perseuete
in my former resolutions,
made in time of my
good & quiet estate, wherin
I was free from passion, and
better able to iudge of thinges
conuenient to my good:
yet may I and ought I resolue
vpon such helpes, as are fi
                        •
                     t
to resist and repell my d
                        •
                     scontented
thoughtes (so they be
not preiudicial to my former
purposes) as praier, penance,
confession and such like
remedies.
                  In temptations and troubles
of mind, I must remembre
that afore time I haue
had the like, and they haue
in fine passed, leauinge me

very glad and ioyfull when I
resisted them, and sorrowfull
when I yeeld too much vnto
them, and therfore I muste
thinke that these also will
passe after a while, & I shall
feele the like ioy in hauing
resisted and ouercome them
And in the meane time I
must with patience endure
the cumber and trouble of
them, assuring my selfe, that
God therwith is highly pleased▪
and the ennemy most effectuallie
subdued.
                  Neither the multitude,
con
                        •
                     inuance, nor badnesse
of any thought must breed
any scruple or disquiet in me.
For not to haue them, is not
in my power, but onely not
to consent vnto them: and
so long as with deliberation

I haue not consented, nor
willingly, or with delight
staied in them, I haue not, sinned
any more then if I had
onely had them in a dreame.
                  If before I had euill
thoughtes, I had a resolu
                        •
                     e
mind neuer to yeeld to any
mortall sinne: and afterward
when I remember my selfe,
and marke that I was in a
bad thought, I still finde the
same resolution, it is a signe
that in the time of my distraction
and bad imagination,
I did not willingly consent
or offend in them: neither
is it like but my mind
being so well affected, I
should haue easilie remembred
directlie and without
doubt, if I had yeelded farther
then I ought.
                  
                     Desolations are permitted
of God for three causes.
                  First, for a punishement of
our sinnes, remisnes, & coldnes
in Gods seruice.
                  Secondly, to trie whether
we be true seruants of God,
or onely hierlinges, that are
willing to labour no longer
then they receiue the hire &
stipend of present comfort
and delight.
                  Thirdly to assure vs that it
passeth the reach and compasse
of our ability, either to
attaine or to maintaine in vs
the feruour of deuotion, the
intensiue loue of God, the aboundance
of godlie teares,
and other spirituall graces &
comfortes, which wee must
acknowledge to proceede of
Gods gratuity & meere liberality,

not of our owne force
or desert.
                  It is good while I feele the
sweetnes of Gods visitation
and presence, to fortifie my
selfe against the desolations
that will ensue, and remembring
those that are past, to
thinke that all troubles, will
as well passe, as comfortes,
and that our whole life, is but
a continuall succession and
mixture of sorrow and ioy,
the one alwaies ouertaking
the other, & neither of them
continuing long toge
                        •
                     her:
And therfore I must settle
my mind in a kinde of indifferency
vnto them both, as it
shal please God to send them.
                  First, to know it a thing
that cōmeth from my mortall
enemy, and tendeth to

my eternall destruction.
                  To looke for temptations
before hād, and not to think
them nouelties, but necessary
sequels of our enimity and
hostility with the diuell,
with whom we must neuer
be friends.
                  To resist them stoutly at
the first, and to crush the serpent
in the head, for nothing
maketh the Diuel to become
so furious and violent, or to
redouble his suggestions, as
to perceaue the soule dismaide
with his temptations,
or not expecting by the confidence
in Gods helpe and
mercy, an assured victory.
                  To beare patiētly the multitude
& continuance of thē,
assuring my self that they wil
haue an end ere long.
                  
                     
To think on the ioy I shall
haue for 
                        •

                  Not to striue with vncleane
temptations, but to turne
my minde to thinke of other
matters, and to change the

waie to put me out of those
phantasies.
                  To resist vices, by practising
and doing acts of the cōtrary
vertues.
                  To arme my selfe, before

which are opposite to
such vices as I am most inclined

vnto. For in those doth
the Diuell alway seeke his
aduantage to ouerthrow: me.
                  In grieuous affaults to open
them to my ghostlie father,
& going to confession,
therby to obtaine by meanes
of the Sacrament, more ability
to resist.

to call for helpe of our Blessed
Lady, my good Angell &
the assistance and praiers of
other Saintes: especially to
humble my selfe in the sight
of God acknowledging mine
owne weaknesse and wholy
relying vpon his helpe, and
earnestly in woord and hart
calling for his assistaunce, and
firmly trusting in his mercy,

as he forsake me not) to suffer

               Consideratiōs to settle the mind
in the course of vertue.
               THE XI. CHAPTER.
               
                  The first consideration, how
weighty a thing the busines
of mans soule is.
                  WHosoeuer being desirous
to take dew care of his
soule, cōmencing a spirituall
course, first must cōsider, that
he hath takē such a busines in
hand that for the importāce,
necessity, and profit therof it
surmounteth all other traffickes,
trades and affaires of the
worlde, yea and to which

                     
                        〈1 page duplicate〉
                     
                     
                     
                        〈1 page duplicate〉
                     
                     
only all other busines ough
                        •
                     
to be addressed: for therein
our manage is about the saluation
of our soule, our chief
iewell and treasure: of which
if in the short passage of
our brittle and vncertaine
life, we take not that due
care that we ought, for a
whole eternity after, we
shall euermore repent and be
sory for it, and yet neuer haue
the like opportunity againe
to help it.
                  Secondly, the better to
conceiue the moment and
weight of this busines, let
vs consider what men vse to
doe for their bodily health.
For we see they make so
principall a reckning of it,
that they spare no cost nor
toile, nor leaue any thing

vnattempted that may auaile
them to attaine it. They suffer
them selues to be launced,
wounded, pined, burnt
with red hoat irons, besides
diuers other extreame to
                        •
                     
                     ments,
onely for this end.
How much greater miseries
ought we to endure? How
much greater paine and diligence
ought we to imploy
for this health of our soule?
which is to suruiue when the
body is dead, rotten, and deuoured
with wormes: and to
suruiue in such sort, that it
must be perpetually tormented
in hell with intollerable
torments, or enioy endles
felicity in heauen. And therfore
of howe much greater
worth and weight wee thinke
the soule, and the eternall

saluation or damnation
therof, then the momentary
health or sickenes of our
body, so much greater accoūt
and esteeme ought we to
make of the busines of our
soule, then of any other
worldly or bodily affaire
whatsoeuer.
                  For what auaileth it a
man (saith Christ) to gaine
the whole worlde and make
wracke of his owne soule? If
therefore we keepe diue
                        •
                     se
men for diuers offices about
our body, and many thousands
to liue by seruing and
prouiding things for euery
part therof: If we spend so
much time in feeding, refreshing,
and reposing of the
same If the greatest portion
of our reuenewes, (be they

neuer so large) be consumed,
in the meates, pompe,
sportes and pleasures thereof:
How much more ought we
to seeke as many helpes, seruices,
and purueiers for our
soule, for who
                        •
                     e only sake
our body was giuen, and of
whose good the welfare of
the body only proceedeth?
                  Thirdly, the necessity and
poise of this care of our
soule, may be gathered of
this, that all other matters
are in
                        •
                     rea
                        •
                     ed with men, or
some other creatures: but this
busines of our soule is with
God him selfe, who by how
much he 
                        •
                     s nobler and worthier
than any of his creatures,
so much more is the
weight of this matter, that
can not be dealt with any

without him, and so much
more diligence ought there
to be imployed therein, especially
in this time, wherein
God is still ready to farther
our endeuours in this behalfe,
where as when time is expired,
condemne he may for
our negligence, or reward
vs for our carefulnes, but
not helpe vs any more to
alter the estate of our soule,
be it neuer so badde, or miserable.
                  Fourthly, we may gather
how material and important
this matter is, by the life of
Christ and his Saintes, who
withdrawing thē selues from
all other worldly affaires,
thought it worke enough to
attend to this businesse of
their soule; and whosoeuer

are now solemnized and honoured
in Gods Church, they
are honored only in this that
they haue with a glorious
Conclusion, happily and constantly
accomplished this busines
to Gods glory, and
their owne saluation. And
who so considers the intollerable
torments of Martyres,
the extreame austerity, sharpe
life, and penance of Confessours,
the painefull agonies,
and conflicts of Virgins,
the rough stormes and troubles
of all Gods Saintes, and
doth remember withall that
they vndertook them for no
other respect, but onely for
the better bringing this businesse
of their soule to an
end, it wil soone apeare how
weighty a thinge, and how

pretious the saluation of the
soule is, which they did think
not too deere bought with
all the miseries, sorrowes,
and paines, that this worlde
coulde afford. Let vs also consider
that what soeuer moued
thē to such care and earnestnes
in this behalfe, hath
no lesse place doubtlesse in vs
than in thē, seeing that our
soule is as deere bought, as
much worth, created to as
great glory as theirs: the danger
of our saluation rather
more than any way lesse than
theirs. God hath as much
right in vs as in them, and we
as many titles of bond and
duetie to serue him as they.
Finally we are assaulted by
the same ennemies, enuironned
with the like hazzardes,

and subiect to as many, yea
more occasions of sinne, and
allurements to damnation
than they. Who therefore
see
                        •
                     h not that we ar in euery
respect to account the care of
our soules as important and
necessary to vs, as euer it hath
beene to any: Wherefore, let
not the wise man glorie in his
wisedome, nor the strong man
in his might, nor the rich man
in his riches, saith God by his
Prophet Hiere 9. But let him
that glorieth, glorie in this,
that he knoweth me, for I am
the only Lord that worketh
mercy, iudgement, and iustice
vpon the earth, & these thinges
please me, saith our Lord:
as who woulde say, it is folie
and vanitie to glory and reioyce
in any other thinge,

then in the knowledge and
seruice of God, and procuring
mercie and milde iudgement
for our soule.
               
               
                  How wee ought to arme our
mindes against temptations
that happen when we seek?
earnestly to serue God.
                  The second consideration.
                  FIrst, seing this businesse
of our soule is of so great
moment, hee that earnestly
goeth about the same, must
offer him selfe vp vnto God,
and bee most ready to endure
constantly all the daungers,
cumbers, and difficulties
that shall happen, and
resolue neuer (by Gods grace)
to be dismayed and beaten

backe from his purpose,
by any trouble or encounter
what soeuer, knowing
that glorious and honourable
enterprises, can neuer be
atchiued without many contradictions.
Wherefore let
him perswade him selfe, that
when he hath setled his minde
seriously to follow this
businesse, hell it selfe, and
all the ennemies of God and
mans soule will conspire against
him: the flesh to allure
him to the dilightes of
the senses, & to recall him to
the vomite of his abandoned
pleasures: the world to
intise him with pomps and
vanities, with ministring occasions
of sinne, and prouoking
by euill examples:
yea, if that will not serue, by

terrifying him with persecutions,
extortions, obloquies,
slaunders, and torments, and
with all kind of disgrace. Finally,
the deuill (a professed
enemy of all those that take
care of their soules) will seek
to entrappe him with a thousande
traines, passions, and
subtile temptations, leauing
nothing that hee thinketh
may remooue a man from
these endeuours tending to
his saluation.
                  Secondly, the case standing
thus, let that saying of Scripture
come to our mind, My
sonne, comming to the 
                           ••
                        ruice
of God, stand in iustice and
feare, and prepare thy sou
                           •
                        e,
vnto temptation. Wherefore
he that entereth into the way
of life, must remember that

he is not come to a play, pastime,
or pleasure, but to a
continuall rough battell and
fight, against most vnplacable
and spightfull enemies;
and let him resolue him self,
neuer in this worlde to look
for quiet and peace, no not
so much as for any truce for
a time, but arme him self for
a perpetual combate, and rather
think of a multitude of
happie victories (which by
Gods grace he may obtaine)
then of any repose or quietnesse
from the rage & assaultes
of his ennemies. Let him
see and peruse the paterne of
his capitains course, who frō
his birth to his death, was in
a restlesse battell, persecuted
in his swadling clowtes by
Herod, annoied the rest of his

infancy by banishment, wā
                     dring
and neede In the flower
of his age slaundered, hated,
pursued, whipped crucified,
and most barbarously
misused: In the same sort
were all his Apostles, and all
his principall souldiers handled:
for whom he loueth he
chastiseth, and prooueth like
golde in the fornace. And
therefore no man must think
it a new thing to be tempted
and troubled, when hee once
runneth a vertuous course,
contrarie to the liking of his
enemies. For the disciple is
not aboue his master, nor the
seruant aboue his Lorde,
who as we see had the same
intreaty.
                  Thirdly, lest we should
be agast and discouraged at

the expectation and feare of
so many discomfortes; and
the incessant malice of so
spitefull ennemies, let vs remember
the wordes of Elizeus:
that more stand with
vs, then against vs. Against
the corruption of nature we
haue grace. Against the diuel
wee haue God, who will neuer
suffer vs to be tempted
aboue our force: Against the
power of hell we haue the
prayers of Saintes: Against
the miseries of the body, the
spiritual comfort of the minde,
which God allotteth in
such measure as our necessitie
requireth: and if there
were nothing else, this were
enough to make troubles
welcome in this case, for that
therby we purchase an inestimable

glory for a short and
passing combate, the comfort
wherof nether eie hath seen,
nor eare heard, nor heart conceiued.
And on the other side
by the same, wee auoid other
intolerable and externall torments
of Hel, the least wherof,
passeth all those that can
be suffered in this worlde.
And therfore is our chaunge
most happy, that by the paine
of a short life, auoide the misery
of an eternall death, and
deserue the vnspeakable happines
of the life euerlasting.
For this cause saith Saint Iames;
Thinke you it all ioy (my
brethren,) when you shall fal
into diuers tēptatiōs, knowing
that the triall of your faith
worketh patience, and patience
hath a perfect worke, that

you may bee perfect & intire,
failing in nothing.
                  
               
               
                  Of the watchfulnesse and attention
required in the
care of our soule.
                  The third Consideration.
                  SEing this weighty affaire
of our soules health is
hemmed in, and besette with
so many and manifest perilles
and troubles, it standeth vs
vpō most watch
                        •
                     ully to take
he
                        •
                     d to euery thought, word,
and d
                        •
                     ede tha
                        •
                      passeth, lest
through the number, & subtility
of our enemies traines,
we be often intrapped: for it
is hard to touch pitch, & not
to be defiled, to liue in flesh
a spirituall life▪ to conuerse in
the worlde, without worldl
                        •
                     e
aff
                        •
                     ctions. Wherefore as

a Legate that is to deliuer his
embassage befor a great presence
of Peers and Nobles,
hath not only regarde to his
matter, but also to his words,
voyce & actions, that all be
sutable to the weight of his
message: So we hauing to
worke this exploite of our
soule befor the eyes of those
that lay waite to take vs in
any trippe, ought to bee very
warye, euen in our least
thoughts & deedes, for feare
that we offend the presence
of God, and giue occasion of
triumphe and vic
                        •
                     ory to our
deadly foes. And for this
saieth the scripture, keepe thy
selfe very watchfully.
                  
                  Secondly, to attaine this
diligent and attentiue care
to all our actions, let vs consider

what men vse to doe,
that carry great treasure by
places haunted by theeues,
how warily they see to their
way, how often they looke
about them, how many times
they prepare thēselues,
some times to fight, and otherwhiles
to runne away:
Likwise how warily he walketh,
and how carefull he is
neuer to stumble nor fall,
that carieth in each hande a
thinne glasse of liquor verie
pretious, through stony and
rough places: And when
wee haue marked these mēs
carefulnes in these inferiour
matters, let vs remēber, that
much more respect is necessary
in vs, whose treasure
is more pretious then any
worldlie iewelles, & yet doe

we carry it in earthen and
fraile vessels, in the middest
of so many theeues, as there
are passions, and disordered
appetites in vs, as there are
Diuels in waire for vs, and as
there are stumbling stones, &
occasions of sinne sette round
about vs. To procure this attention,
the most effectuall
helpes are these.
                  First, to thinke how carefull
we should be to doe all
thinges wel, if this presēt day
were the last that euer we
should liue in this worlde (as
peraduenture it may be) and
that at the end thereof, we
were to bee conuented before
a most seuere and 
                        •
                     igourous
iudge, who according
to the deserts of that daies
actions, should passe the sentence

of life or death vpō vs.
                  Secondly, to remēber that
God is in his owne substance,
power, and true presence, in
euery place, and seeth both
our outward and inward actions,
more then we our selues,
and therfore let vs seeke
in euery thing so to behaue
our selues, that we feare
not to haue God a witnesse
and behoulder of all that
wee doe, thinke, or say, and
let vs aske him grace to doe
nothing vnworthy his sight.
                  Thirdly, we must consider
the carlesnes of our life past,
remembring how often we
haue fought against God,
with his owne weapons, and
abused the force that he hath
afforded, in euery part of our
body and mind, & therefore

as S. Paul Warneth, as we haue
exhibited our mēbers to serue
vncleanes and iniquity, to iniquitie:
So now let vs exhibite
our members to serue iustice
vnto sanctification.
                  
                  Fourthly, to procure this
attention, it is good oftentimes
in the day when we are
about our ordinarie actions,
to vse some shorte praiers or
some one verse of a Psalme,
or any other shorte petition
of Gods grace, aide, and assistance:
for these short prayers,
are fewell of deuotion,
causes of attention, foode of
the soule, preparations against
temptations, and assured
helpes to attaine anie
vertues: therefore it is good
to vse them in lieu of sighes,
& in the beginning of euerie

chiefe action, directing therin

                  Of the necessity of perseuerāce
in continuing watchfull
ouer our selues.
                  The last consideration.
                  FIrst seeing the sūme and
complemēt of al ver

                     ue
consisteth in the cōtinuance
and progresse in it: perseuerance
of all other things, is
most necessary in this busines:
to the better a
                        •
                     taining
wherof, these considerations
may preuaile.
                  First, to consider by whose
instinct and motion I beganne
to take speciall care
of my soule, and I shall find
that being a thing contrary

to the inclination of flesh &
bloud, and aboue the reach
of nature, to resolue vpon so
painfull and wary a course,
in hope of a reward and ioy
that faith doth promise, that
I say God onely, and no other
was the author and mouer
of my heart vnto it, and
therfore vnlesse I meane directly
to resist God, and run
a contrary course to that
which he prescribeth, I must
resolue my selfe to perseuer
to the end in that which I
haue happely begunne.
                  Secondly, the ende of this
enterprise was to serue God,
to bewaile my former sinns,
and to worke by Gods helpe
the sal
                        •
                     a
                        •
                     ion of mine owne
soule: and when I resolued
vpon these meanes, I was in

a state free from passion, and
as w
                        •
                     ll able to choose thinge

                        •
                      I could
be any other time, & wholy
bent to do that thing which
was for my greatest good.
Wherfore seing I can neuer
ayme at a better end, nor be
in better plighte to make a
sounder ch
                        •••
                     e, my surest
way is to perseuer stil
                        •
                      in my
resolution to the end, neuer
altering my designemēt, vnlesse
it be 
                        •
                     o a better, and further
my course.
                  Thirdly, I must cōside
                        •
                      who
he is, that that would make
me forsake it: For if God moued
me vn
                        •
                     o it, doubtles it

                        •
                     ll would remoue
me from it: for God cannot
be c
                        •
                     ntrary to him selfe, neither
vseth he to alter our

mindes but only from euil to
good, or frō good to better:
therefore vnles I meane to
yeeld wittingly vnto the Diuel,
and to follow mine enemies
counsaile vnto mine
owne perdition, I must perseuer
vnto the end: For with
what pretext soeuer the Diuel
seeketh to couer his motion,
sure it is, that his drifte
is, to drawe me from God
and goodnesse, and to damne
my soule for how can he intend
any thing to my good,
that beareth me such a cancred
malice, that hee careth
not to encrease his owne
paine, so that he may worke
me any spiritual, yea or corporal
harme?
                  Fourthly▪ I must print that
saying of Christ in my mind,
He that perseuereth vnto the

end shalbe saued. For not he
that beginneth, nor he that
continueth for a moneth, or
a yeare, or a shorte time, but
onely he that perseuereth to
the very end of his life, shall
be saued W
                        •
                     erfore the same
cause that mooued me to beginne,
ought also to mooue
me to continue, that the merit
and crowne of my good
resolution be not cut off by
any want of perseuerance.
Let not the cries of mine enemies
moue me: let me
with S. Paul say, the world
is crucified to me, and I to the
world: and with Dauid, it is
good for me to cleaue vnto
God. Finally let me imitat the
exāple of Christ that perseuered
ō the cross vnto death
for my sake, though oftē called

vpon to come downe.
                  Fiftly, I must consider that
in what state soeuer of grace
or merit of damnation, I
begin the next life, I must &
shall vndoubtedly perseuere
in it, according to the word
of Salomon; whersoeuer the
tree faleth, there shall it be towards
south or north, that is,
towards heauen or hell: for
both the paine of this continueth
for euer, and the ioy
of the other after it is once
begunne (for it may bee deferred
for a time by the paines
of purgatory,) is also
euerlasting.
                  If therefore I will perseuer
in heauen, let me perseuer in
the way that leadeth vnto it,
and neuer forsake the painefulnes
of it till, the iourneis

end. The passions of this life
are not condigne or compatable
to the fu

                     e glory: and
it is extreame folly for auoiding
a short and transitory

                  The sinners perseuer still
in wickednes, and seruice of
the Diu
                        •
                     ll. The wordlinges
perseuer in pursuing vanities
& following the world, yea
and that with most seruile
toile and base drudgery, and
not without many bodily,
and ghostly harmes, how
much more ought a true seruant
of God perseuer in his
seruice, and not seeme by
forsaking him in the way, to

condemne him for a worse
master then the world or the
Diuel, whom many thousandes
serue to the end, to their
owne damnation.
                  Let me remember that the
first Angell, for want of perseuerance
became a Diuell.
Adam for want of the same,
was thrust out of paradise,
and Iudas of an Apostle, became
a prey of hell Finally,
there be many thousands in
hell fire burning▪ that began
very good courses, and for a
time went forward in the
same, and yet in the end for
want of perseuerance were
damned for euer.
               
               
                  What good a soule looseth by
mortall sinne.
                  1. The grace of the holy
Ghost.
                  2. The friendship and familiaritie

with God.
                  3. Al moral vertues infused,
and of Gods spirit.
                  4. The inheritance of the
kingdome of heauen.
                  5. The portion of Gods
children, and patronage of
his fatherly prouidēce which
he hath ouer the iust.
                  6. The peace & quietnes of a
good, and cleare conscience.
                  7. Many comfortes and visitations
of the holy Ghost.
                  8. The fruite and merit of
our former life, during the
state of sinne.
                  9. The merit and satisfaction
of our present actions,
albeit in the mean time they
dispose to Gods grace, and satisfie
the precepts of God,
and the Church.
                  10. A great portion of the

communion of Saintes, and
of the participation of the
good workes and praiers of
the whole Church. And finally
of the fruit, and part
of the merite of Christs
passion.
               
               
                  What misery the soul gaineth
by mortall sinne.
                  1. Condemnation to eternall
paine.
                  2. To be quite cancelled
out of the booke of life.
                  3. To become of the child
of God, the thrall of the Diuell.
                  4. To be chaunged from
the Temple of the holie
ghost, into a denne of theeue
                        ••

                  How a soule is prepared to iustification
by degrees.

how our conuersation may

                  FIrst (after a special deuotion
towardes our B.

Lady, whom aboue all pure
creatures we ought continually
to affect and reuerence)
we must procure to
haue a kind of reuerent familiarity
with our good Angel,

of our persons, a counsellor
in doubts, a comforter in
troubles, a patron in our needes,
and an assured friend in

                  We must therefore loue
him as our friend, honour
him as our superiour, thanke

                     erminac place,
where I meane to conceyue
the Saintes presence.
                  Secondly, to choose some
ce
                        •
                     taine & determinat 
                        •
                     aint,
and when I haue once de
                        •
                     oted
the place to one Saint,

not to chaunge, but still to
keepe the same, for easier
habituating my memorie.
                  Thirdly, in those roomes
wherein I am most conuersant,
I may place two, three,
or mo
                        •
                     e, as the roome will
minister cōnueniency to frame
their places for the better
conceiuing and remembring
of them.
                  Fourthly, I must place such
Saints in the roome as are
fittest to be patterns & exā
                     ples
vnto me in that action,
for which that roome principally
se
                        •
                     ueth; As in the dining
chāber or pa
                        •
                     lour, saints
of spare and regular diet, of
sober and vertuous conuersa
                     
                        •
                     ion.
In the b
                        •
                     d chamber,
Saints giuen to short sleepe
and watchfulnesse. In the

Chappell, Sainte
                        •
                      giuen to
much prayer and deuotion,
and so in other roomes.
                  Fiftly, I may in steede of
Saintes, place some misterie
of Christs life or passion: as
the last supper in the dining
chamber: and such like.
                  Sixtly, not only in the
house, but also in the wallkes,
gardens, and orchards
about the house may I doe
the same: and so make my
walkes as it were short pilgrimages,
to visit such Saints
as are patrones of the place I
goe vnto.
                  Seuēthly, it is not good to
place Saints in al the roomes
in one day, but first to consider
well in euery roome
the fittest place for that purpose,
and then to begin one

day with one or two, & the
the next day with two more,
that they may bee the easher
im
                        •
                     rinted in my memory.
                  Eightly, it is good in some
roomes to place austere,
mournefull and rigorous
Saints, conceiuing them in
attire sutable to their auste
                     
                        •
                     itie
and dolefull profession
while they were aliue, that
when I find my selfe too lauish
in mirth, or too much
inclined to pleasure, the cō
                     pany
& presence of that austere
example, may temper
my disposition
                  And likewise in steede of
these Saintes I may place some
lamentable history of the
olde or new Testament, or
some representatiō of death,
hell, or iudgement. Likewise

in other roomes, to place
some glorious faire, & comfortable
Saintes, histories, or
figures, with all sutable to
ioy, that may serue me in
time of my heauines to alay
my sorrowes: and the like in
feare, hope, presumption,
despaire, and such other passions,
but especially in those
which I finde my selfe most
inclined vnto.
                  Ninthly, I must take heede
that I make not this exercise
a toile, but rather a spirituall
recreation, and therfore
I must not be too eager
to doe all things on a suddaine,
but get the habit and
custome of it by litle & litle,
for so wil it proue an exercise
of wonderful profit, easines,
and contentment.
               
               
                  
                  An other exercise to take occasion
of Gods creatures, to
serue and remember God,
and to attaine vertue.
                  FIrst, concerning persons
I may allote to euery
man & woman of the house
where I liue a Saint, so that
euery one of the company
shall with his presence bring
me in memory of his Saint,
and whatsoeuer I doe with
any of them, I shall alwaies
carry a respect to his Saint,
and be affraid to offend.
                  Secondly, euery one shall
represent vnto me some vertue
or some vice: so that whē
I see them, I may in one remember
and practise humility;
in an other patience,
modesty, obedience and such
like: or on the other side, remember

and take heed of
swearing, anger and such like
faultes, and be sory that euer
I offended in them.
                  Thirdly, I may take occasion
of other creatures to remember
Gods mercies, as by
mon
                        •
                     , the selling of Christ:
by meate, his last supper: by
wa
                        •
                     er, the water of his eies

Disciples feete: by drinking,
his e
                        •
                     sell and gall: by wood,
his Crosse and thornes: by
stone, his graue: and so in
all other pointes of Christs
life and passion, and in all other
thinges, the consideration
wherof may mooue me
to goodnesse: as by fire to remēber
hel, by ashes death, by
light that discouereth things
that darcknes did hide, the

finall iudgement and day of
generall descouery, and by
the beauty of the elements,
& by the pleasure & comfort
of other creature, heauen.
                  This exercise must not be
ordinary vnles it be the first
point, but now & then vsed
to recollect the mind after
long distraction.

I am wounded, reuiue me

in all my needs.

miserie.

loathsome substance. I am in
the world, a sacke of corruption,
I shal bee in my graue,
a prey of vermine. When I
was nothing, I was without
hope to be saued, or feare to
be damned: I am now in a
doubtfull hope of the one,
and in manifest daunger of
the other I shal be ether happy
by the successe of my hope,
or most miserable by the
effect of my daunger. I was
so that I coulde not then bee
damned; I am now so, that
I can scarce be saued. What I
haue beene I know, to wit, a
wretched sinner: what I am,
I cānot say, being vncertaine
of Gods grace. What I shall

be I am ignorāt, being doutfull

point of duety to their parents,

the violence of heresie hath
so crossed the course, both of
vertue and nature, that their

                  •
               erued. I am not of
so vnnaturall a kinde, of so
wilde education, or so vnchristian
a spirite, as not to

remember the roote out of
which I branched, or to forget
my secondary maker, and
author of my being: It is
not the carelesnesse of a cold
affection, nor the want of a
due and reuerēt respect, that
hath made me such a stranger
to my natiue home, and so
slacke in defraying the debt
of a thankefull minde, but
onely the iniquity of our
dayes, that maketh my presence
perillous, and the discharge
of my duety an occasion
of daunger. I was loath
to enforce an vnwelcome
courtesie vppon any, or by
seeming officious, to become
offensiue, deeming it better,
to let time digest the feare,
that my returne into the
realme had bred in my kindred,

than abruptly to intrude
my selfe, to purchase their
anger, whose good will I so
highly esteemed. I neuer
doubted, but that the beleefe,
which to all my friendes
by descent and pedigree,
is in maner hereditary, framed
in them a right perswasion
of my present callinge,
not suffering them to measure
their censures of me,
by the vgly termes and odious
Epithe
                  •
               es, where with
heresy hath sought to discredite
my function, but rather
by the reuerence of so worthy
a Sacrament, and the sacred
doom of al former ages.
Yet because I might very easilie
perceiue by apparant
coniectures, that many were
more willinge to heare of
me, then from me, and readier

to praise, than to vse my
indeuours, I haue hitherto
bridled my desire to see thē,

                  •
                care and ialousie of
their safetie, and banishing
my selfe from the sent of my
cradle in my owne coūtrey,
I haue liued like a forreiner,
finding among strangers,
that, which in my nee
                  •
               est
bloud I presumed not to
seeke. But nowe, considering
that delay may haue
qualified feare, and knowing
my person onely to import
danger to others, and my
perswasion to none but to
my selfe: I thought it highe
time to vtter my sincere and
duetifull minde, and to open
a vent to my zealous affection,
which I haue so long
smothered and suppressed in
silence. For not onely the

originall law of nature written
in all childrens harts, and
deriued from the bowelles
and breasts of their mothers,
is a continual soliciter, vrging
me in your behalfe, but the
soueraigne decree enacted by
the Father of heauen, ratified
by his Sonne, and daily repeated
by instinct of the holy
Ghost, bindeth euery childe
in the due of Christianity, to
tender the estate & welfare
of his parents, & is a motiue,
that alloweth no excuse, but
of necessitie presseth to performance
of duety. Nature
by grace is not abolished, but
perfited, not murdred, but
manured neither are her impressions
quite rased, or annulled,
but suted to the colours
of faith & vertue. And

Surely for my owne part, although

not to claime any priuiledge
surmoūting the rate

al touch of presumptiō in
aduising my elders, seeing
that it hath the warrant of
Scripture, the testimony of
exāples, & sufficient grounds
both in grace & nature. Ther
is diuersity in the degrees of
our carnal consanguinitie, &
the preeminēce appertaineth
to you, as superiour ouer
your childes body. Yet if you

consider our alliaunce in the
chiefe portion, I meane our
soule, which discerneth man
from inferiour creatures, we
are of equal proximity to our
heauēly father, both descended
of the same parent, and
no other distance in our degrees,
but that you are the
elder brother. In this sense
dooth the Scripture say; Call
not any Father vpō earth, for
one is your father which is in
heauen. Seeing therefore
that your superiority is founded
vpon flesh and bloud,
which are in a manner but
the barke & rhine of a man,
and our equality vppon the
soule, which is mans maine
substaunce, thinke it I pray
you, no dishonour to your
person, if with all humilitie

I offer my aduise vnto you.
One man can not be perfect

yet little experimented

actions. I haue studied and
practised these many yeeres
spiritual phisick, acquainting
my selfe with the beating &
temper of euery pulse, and
traueling in the scrutiny of
the maladies and medicines
incident vnto soules. If therfore
I profer you the fruits of
my long studies, and make
you a present of my profession,

I hope you will constre
it rather as a duetifull part,

He may be a father to
the soule, that is a sonne to
the body, and requite the
benefit of his temporall life,
by reuiuing his parent from
a spirituall death. And to this
effect said Christ these words:
My mother, and brethren are
they, that doe the wil of my
father which is in heauen:
Vpon which place S. Iohn
Climacus, shewing to what
kindred a Christian ought
chiefly to rely▪ draweth this
discou
                  •
               se. Let him be thy father,
that both can, and will,
lay his labour to disburden
thee of thy packe of sinnes.
Let holy compūction be thy
mother, to depure thee from

thy ordure and filth. Let him
be thy brother, that will be
both thy partner and compeditor
to passe and perfite thy
race towardes heauen. Take
the memory of death for thy
perpetual phere, and vnseparable
spouse. Let thy childrē
bee bitter sighs of a sorrowfull
heart, and possesse
thy body as thy bondman.
Fasten thy friendshippe with
the Angelicall powers, with
which if thou closest in familiar
affiaunce, they will be
patrones vnto thee in thy finall
passage.
            This (saieth he) is the generation
and kindred of those
that seeke God. Such a father
as this Saint speaketh
of, may you haue of your
owne sonn, to enter you farther
in the fore recited affinity

Of which happily it was
a significāt presage, aboding
the future euent, that euen
from my infancy you were
wont in merriment, to call
me father. R. which is the
customary stile now allotted
to my present estate.
            Now therfore to ioine issue,
and to come to the principal
drift of my discourse, most
humbly and earnestly I am
to beseech you, that both in
respect of the honour of
God, your duety to his
church, the comfort of your
children, and the redresse of
your owne soule, you would
seriously cōsider the tearmes
you stand in, and weigh your
selfe in a Christian ballance,
taking for your counterpose
the iudgements of GOD.

Take heede in time, that the
woord Thecel, writtē of old
against Baltazar, & interpreted
by Daniel. (Dan. 5.) be
not verified in you, whose
expositiō was. You haue been
poised in the scale, & found of
too light weight. Remember
that you are in the waining,
and the date of your pilgrimage
is wel neer expired, &
now it behooueth you to
look towards your countrey.
Your force languisheth, your
senses impaire, and your bodie
droupeth, and on euerie
side the ruinous cottage of
your faint and feeble flesh,
threatneth fal. And hauing so
many herbingers of death to
premonish your end, how cā
you but prepare forso dreadful
a strāger? The young may
die quickely, but the old can

not liue long. The yoūg mās
life by casualty may be abri
                  •
               
               ged,
but the old mans by no
phisicke can be long adiourned:
& therfore if g
                  •
               een yeares
sometimes must think of
the graue, the thoughtes of
sere age should continually
dwel in the same. The prerogatiue
of infancie, is innocē
               cy▪
of childhood, reuerence,
of manhood, maturitie, & of
age, wisdom. And seeing that
the cheife properties of wisdome
are, to be mindfull of
things passed, careful of thinges
present, & prouident of
thinges to come, vse now
the priuiledg of natures talēt
to the benefitte of your soule,
and procure hereafter to
be wise in well doing, and
wa
                  •
               chsull in foresight of future

harmes. To serue the
world you are now vnable,
and though you were able,
you haue litle cause to be
willing, seeing that it neuer
gaue you but an vnhappy
welcom, a hurtful entertainment,
& now doth abandon
you with an vnfortunat farwel▪
You haue long sowed in
a field of flint, which could
bring you nothing forth, but
a crop of cares, and affliction
of spirit: rewarding your labours
with remorse, and affording
for your gaine, eternall
domages. It is now more
then a seasonable time, to
alter the course of so vnthriuing
a husbandry, and to enter
into the filde of Gods
Church, in which, sowing
the seeds of repētant sorow,
& watering them with the

teares of humble contrition,
you may reape a more beneficiall
haruest, and gather the
fruites of euerlasting comforte.
Remember I pray you,
that your spring is spent,
and your summer ouerpast:
you are now ariued to the
fall of the leafe, yea and winter
colours haue alreadie stained
your hoarie head. Be
not carelesse (saieth S. Austen)
though our louing Lord
bear long with offenders, for
the longer he staieth, not finding
amendement, the sorer
wil he scourge when hee comes
to iudgement; and his
patiēce in so long expecting,
is onely to lend vs respite to
repent, not any way to enlarge
vs leisure to sinne. He
that is tossed with variety of
stormes, and cannot come to

his desired port, maketh not
much way, but is much turmoiled;
so hee that hath passed
many yeeres, and purchased
litle profite, hath had a
long beeing, but a short life,
for life is more to bee measured
by merites, than by nūber
of daies, seeing 
                  〈◊〉
                most
men by many daies, doe but
procure many deathes, and
others in a short space attaine
the life of infinit ages.
What is the body without

& what the soule without

If God bee the way, the
life, and the trueth, he that
goeth without him, strayeth,
hee that liueth without him
dieth, and hee that is not
taught by him, erreth. Well
saieth saint Austen, that God

is our true and chiefest life,
from whom the reuolting is
falling, to whome the returning
is rising, in whom the
staying is sure standing. God
is he, from whom to depart,
is to die, to whom to repaire
is to reuiue, in whom to
dwel is to liue. Be not you
therefore of those, that beginne
not to l

True it is, that a theefe may
be saued vpon the crosse, and
mercy found at the laste gaspe.
But well saieth S. Augustine,
that though it be
possible, yet is it scarce credible,
that his death should
find fauour, whose whole
life hath earned wrath: and
that his repentance should
be accepted, that more for
feare of heil, and loue of him

selfe, then for loue of God
or lothsomnes of sinn, crieth
for mercy. Wherefore good
Sir, make no longer delaies,
but being so neere the breaking
vp of your mortal house,
take time before extremitie,
to satisfie Gods Iustice.
Though you suffered the
bud to the blasted, and the
flower to fade: though you
permitted the fruit to perish,
and the leaues to drie vp: yea
though you let the boughes
wither, and the body of your
tree growe to decaie, yet
alas keepe life in the roote,
for feare least the whole become
fuell for hell fire. For
surely where soeuer the tree
falleth, there shall it be, whether
it be to south or north,
heauen or hell: and such sap
as it bringeth, such fruite

shal it euer beare. Death hath
already filed from you, the
better part of your naturall
fores, and hath left you now
to the lees and remissailes of
your wearish & dying daies:
the remainder whereof, as it
cannot be long, so doth it
warne you speedilie to ransome
your former losses. For
what is age but the calendes
of death? & what importeth
your present weaknes, but an
earnest of your aproaching
dissolution? You are now impathed
in your finall voiage,
and not far of from the stint
and period of your course: &
therfore be not dispurueied
of such appartenances as are
behoofull in so perplexed &
perillous a iorney. Death in
it selfe is very fearefull, but
much more terrible in regard

of the iudgement that it sō
               moneth
vs vnto. If you were
laied on your departing bed,
burdened with the heauy
loade of your former trespasses,
& goared with the sting
and pricke of a frestred conscience:
If you felt the cramp
of death wresting your hart
stringes, and ready to make
the rufull diuorce betwene
body & soule: If you lay panting
for breath, and suiming
in a colde and fatall sweate,
wearied with strugling against
your deadly panges: O
how much would you giue
for an hower of repentance?
at what rate would you valew
a daies, contrition? Then
worldes would be worthles
in respecte of a litle respitte.
A shorte truce would seeme
more pretious, then the treasures

of Empires, nothing
would be so much esteemed
as a trice of time, which now
by monthes & yeeres, is lauishly
mispent. O how deeply
would it wound your hart,
when lookinge backe into
your life, you considered

                  〈◊〉
                faults committed, and

                  〈◊〉
                confessed, manie good
workes omitted, and not
recouered, your seruice to
God promised, and not performed?
How inconsolable
were your case, 
                  •
               our frends
being fled, your senses frighted,
your thoughts amazed,
your memory decaied, your
whole minde agast, and no
part able to performe that it
should, but onely your guilty
conscience pestred with sinne,
that would continually
vpbraid you with most bitter

accusations. What would
you thinke when stripped
out of you: mortall weede,
and turned both out of the
seruice and hows roome of
this world. you were forced
to enter into vncouth and
strange pathes, and with vnknowen
and vgly compan
                  •
               ,
to be conuented before a
most seuere iudge, carying in
your owne conscience your
inditement written, and a
perfit register of all your misdeeds?
When you should see
him prepared 
                  〈◊〉
                the sē
               tence
vpon you, against whō
you had transgressed, and the
same to be your vmpier,
whom by so many offences
you had made your enimie?
When not onely the diuels,
but euen the Angels should

pleade against you, and your
selfe, maugre your will, be
your sharpest appeacher.
What would you do in these
dreadful exigents, when you
saw that gastly dungeon and
huge gulfe of hell, breaking
out with most fearfull flames?
When you saw the weping
& gnashing ofteeth the
rage of those hellish mōsters,
the horrour of the place, the
rigour of the paine, the terrour
of the company, & the
eternity of all these punishments?
W

               uld you thē think
them wise, that would delay
in so weighty matters, and
idly play away the time allotted

calamities? Would
you then account it secure, to
nurse in your bosom so many

               rpēts as sinnes, or to foster

in your soule so manie malicious
accuser, as mortall
faults? Would you not then
thinke one life too litle, to
doe penance for so many iniquities,
euery one wherof
were enough to cast you into
those euerlasting vnspeakeable
torments? Why then do
you not at the least deuote
that small remnant and surplusage
of these your latter
daies, procuring to make an
attonement with God, and
to free your conscience from
such corruption, as by your
schisme and fall hath crept
into it. Those verie eyes that

or what could you finde in a

For they ar now worne

slumber out the day, & enter

into the lapse of endlesse perdition.
Let such harken to▪ S.
Cipriās lesson Let (saieth he)
the grieuousnesse of our sore,
be the measure of our sorrowe.
Let a deepe wounde,

Let no mans contrition, bee

thou that our Lord can be so
soone appeased, whom with
perfidious words thou hast
denied, whom lesse then thy
patrimony thou hast esteemed,
whose temple with sacrilegious
corruption thou
hast defiled? Thinkest thou
easely to recouer his fauour,
whome thou hast auouched
not to be thy Master? We
must rather most instātly intreat,
we must passe the day
in mourning, the night in
watching and weeping, our
whole time in painfull lamē
               ting.
We must fall prostrate
vpon the groūd hūbling our
selues in sack-cloth & ashes.
And hauing lost the garment
of Christ, we should be vnvnwilling

               iand of
the Deuell, wee should now
desire to fast from all earthly
food. We should ply good
workes, to purge our offences:
wee should be liberall
in almes, to auoid the death
of our soules, that Christ may
receiue, that the persecutour
would haue spoiled: neither

kept or fansied, with which
a man hath bene ensnared
and vanquished. Not euery
short sigh will bee a sufficient
satisfaction, nor euery
knocke a warrant to get in.
Many cry Lord Lord, and are
not accepted. The foolish
Virgin knocked, and were
not admitted. Iudas had some
sorow, and yet died desperate.

Forslowe not, saieth
the holy Ghost, to be conuerted
vnto God. and linger not
off from day to day; for sodainly
will his wrath come,
and in the time of reueng he
wil destroy thee. Let no man
seiourne long in sinfull securitie,
nor post ouer his repentance
till feare, enforce him
vnto it: Lette vs frame our
premises, as wee would find
our conclusion, & endeuour
to liue, as we are desirous to
die. Shall we offer the maine
crop to the Diuel, & set God
to gleane the reproofe of his
haruest? Shall wee gorge the
D
                  •
               uil with our fairest fruits,
and turne God to feede on
the filthy scraps of his leauings?
How great a foly were
it, when a man pineth away
in a perillous lāguor, to prouide

gorgeous apparell, to
bespeak sūptuous furniture,
& take order for the rearing
of stately buildings, & neuer
thinking of his owne recouery,
to let the discase take
roote within him? Were it
not the lik vanity, for a Prince
to dote so farre vppon his
subiect, as neglecting his own
regaltie, to busie him selfe
wholy in aduancing his seruant?
Thus saith S. Chrisostome
do they that whē their
soule hath surfeited with all
kind of sinne, & is drenched
in the depth of infinit diseases,
without any regard therof,
labour their wits in setting
forth her garment, and
in pampering the body with
all possible delights And
wheras the soule should haue
the soueraignitie, and the

body follow the sway of her
direction, seruile senses, and
lawlesse appetites doe rule
her as superiours, and she is
made a vassall in her owne
dominions. What is there,

other things the most worthy
to be best, thou art content
should be nought, & ly
cankering and rusting in all
kind of euelles. O vnspeakable
blindnes! Can we prefer
our shoes before our soule,

refusing to weare an euell
shoe, and not careing to cary
an vgly and deformed soule?
Alas let vs not set so litle by
that, which God prised so
much. Let vs not rate our selues
at so base a peniworth,
being in truth of so peerles
dignity. If the soule be such,
that not all the gold & treasure
of the world, nor any
thing of lesse worth the the
blood and life of almighty
God, was able to buy it. If
not all the deinties that wit
can deuise, or heauen and

owne pretious body, was by

of this, no nor milliōs of new
worldes, if so many more
were created▪ but onely the
illimitable goodnesse, and

maiestie of God can satisfie
the desire, and fill the compass
and capacity of it, who
but of lame iudgment, or
peruerse will, yea who but
of an incredulous mind and
pittiles spirit, could set more

sicke, but we allow him a
Phisician; our horse diseased,
but wee send for a leach; nor
our garment torne, but we
will haue one to mēd it? And
cā wee so much maligne our
soule as to let it die for want
of cure, & seeing it mangled
with so many vices, neuer

wonted integrity? Is our seruant
neerer, our beast more
pretious, and our coate deerer
than our owne soule? If
any should call vs Epicures,
Atheists, rebels vnto God, or
murderers of soules, wee
would take it for an intollerable
reproach, and think it a
most disgraceful and opprobrious
calumniation. But to
liue like Epicures, to sinn like
Atheists, to struggle against
Gods callinges, and like violent
rebels to scorne his commandements:

daily and damnable woundes,

infortu
                  •
               ate soules, this wee

rather wee register it in the

                  •
               aunt of our chiefest praises.
O yee so
                  •
               nes of men, how

long wil you carrie this heauie
hart, aliking vanity, and
seeking lies? howe long will
children loue the follies of
insancie, and sinners 
                  •
               unne
carelesse and wilfull to their
ruine? Will you keepe you
                  •
               
chicken from the kite, your
lambe from the wolfe, your
fawne from the hound. Dare
you not suffer a spider in
your bosome, or a toade to
come neare you, and can you
nestle in your soule so many
vipers as vices, & permit it to
be so long chewed and wearied
with the poisoned iawes
and tuskes of the Diuel?
And is our soule so vaine a
substance, as to bee had in so
litle esteem? Had Christ made
ship wrack of his wisdom, or
was he in a rage of passion,

when he became a wandering
pilgrime, exiling him
selfe from the comfortes of
his God-head, and passing
three & thirty yeeres in paine
& penu
                  •
               y for the behoof
of our soules? Was he surprized
with a rauing fit, when
in the tragedy of his passion
so bloodily inflicted, and so
patiently accepted, hee made
his body as a cloud, to resolue
into showers of innocent
bloud, and suffered the deerest
veines of his hart to be
launced, to giue full issue to
the price of our soules redemption?
Or if Christ did
not erre, nor deeme amisse,
when it pleased him to redeeme
vs with so excessiue
a ransome, then what should
wee iudge of our monstrous
abuse, that sell our soules to

the Diuel for euery vaine delight,
and rather aduenture
the hazard thereof, then of a
seelie pittance of worldly
pelse? O that a creature of so
incomparable a price, should
be in the demaine of so vnnaturall
keepers? and that
which is in it self so gracious
and amiable, that the Angels
and Saints delight to behold
it (as S. Chrisostom saieth)
should by sinne be fashioned
into so lothsom & disguised
shapes, as to become a horrour
to heauen, and a sutely
pheere for the fowlest fends?
Alas, if the care of our owne
harmes moue vs no more,
but that we can stil be so barbarous
to the better portion
of our selues, lett vs at the
least feare to iniurie an

other party, very careful and
ieallous ouer it: who wil neuer
endure so deepe an impeachment
of his interest to
passe vnreuenged. We must
remember, that our soule is
not onely a part of vs, but also
the temple, the paradise,
& spouse of almightie God,
by him in baptisme garnisht,
stored & ēdowed with most
gratious ornamēts. And how
thinke you he can brook, to
see his temple prophaned, &
turned into a den of Diuels?
his paradise displanted, & altered
into a wildernesse of
serpentes? his spouse defloured,
and become an adulteresse
to his vtter ennemies?
Durst we offer such vsage to
our Princes, yea or to our Farmers
daughter? woulde not
fe
                  •
               re of the lawe, & popular

shame, disturne vs frō it? And

               bated
iustice of his angry
sword, terrifie vs frō offering
the like to his owne spouse?
Doe we think God, either so
impotent that he cannot, so
base and sottish that hee will
not, or so weake witted that
he knoweth not howe to
wreak himself vppon so contēptuous
& daring offenders?
Will he so neglect and loose
his honor▪ which of al things
hee claimeth as his chief peculiar?
Will he that for the
soules sake keepeth a reckoning
of our very hairs, which
are but the excrementes of
her earthly weede, see himself
so much wronged in the
principall, & passe it without

remonstrance of his iust indignation?
O deere sir, remē
               ber
that the scripture termeth
it a thing full of horrour
to fal into the hands of
God, who is able to crush the
prowd spirites of the obstinate,
& to make his enemies
the footestole of his feet.
Wrastle no longer against
the cries of your owne conscience,
and the forcible inspiratiōs
that God dooth send
you. Embrace his mercy before
the time of rigour, and
returne to his Church, iest
