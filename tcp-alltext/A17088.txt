            ¶ANE ADMONITION TO
THE TREW LORDIS.
M. G. B.
            
               IT may seme to your Lordschippis,
that I melling with heigh
materis of gouerning of common
welthis do pas mine estait,
being of sa meane qualitie, and
forgettis my dewtie, geuing counsall to the
wisest of this Realme. Not the les seyng the
miserie so greit apperyng, and the calamitie
sa neir approching, I thoght it les fault, to incur
the crime of surmounting my priuate estate,
then the blame of neglecting the publik
danger. Thairfoir I chesid rather to vnderly
the opinion of presumptioun in speiking, thē
of treson in silence, and specially of sic thingis
as euin seme presently to redound to the perpetuall
schame of your Lordschippes, distructioun
of this royall estaite, and ruyne of the
hole cōmoun welth of Scotland. On this consideratioun,
I haue takin in hand at this time
to aduertise your honours of sic thingis as I
thoght to appertene, baith to your Lordschippis
in speciall, & in generall to the hole communitie
of this Realme, in punitioun of traytouris,
pacificatioun of troublis amāgis your
selfis, and continuatioun of peace with our
nighbouris. Of the quhilk I haue takin the

trauell to write: and do remit the Iudgement
to your discretioun, hopyng at leist, that althogh
my wit and forsight shall not satisfie
you, yit my gude will shall not displeis you, of
quhilk aduertisement the summe is this.
            ¶First to consider how godly the actioun
is quhilk you haue in hand, to wit, the defence
of your King an Innocent pupill, the
stablishyng of Religioun, punitioun of thiefis
and traitouris, and mantenance of peace and
quietnes amongis your selfis and with forrane
Natiounis.
            Item remēber how you haue vindicat this
Realme, from the thraldome of strāgeris, out
of domestik tyrannie, and out of a publik dishonour
in the sight of all forrane natiounis,
we beyng altogider estemid a pepill murtherars
of Kingis and impacient of Lawis and ingrait,
in respect of the murther of the late
King Hēry, within the wallis of the principall
Towne, the greatest of the Nobilitie beyng
present with the Quene for the tyme and by
your power one pairt of the cheif Traitouris
tried from amōgis the trew subiectis, quhairby
strāgeris wer cōstranid afterwart as mekle
to prayse your iustice, as of befoir thay wrāgfully
condempnid your iniustice.
            Item remēber how far in doing the same ye
haue obliged your selfis befoir the hole warld

to continew in the same vertew of Iustice, and
quhat blame ye shall incur, if ye be inconstāt.
For all mē can belief na vtherwise, if the tyme
followyng be not conforme to the tyme past,
that nouther honour nor commoun welth
stirrid you vp then, but rather sum particulair
tendyng to your priuait commoditie.
            Also remember how many gentill and honest
meanis you haue soght, in tymes past to
caus the King be acknawledgid, and the contrarie
put at rest, and how vnprofitabill hath
ben your honestie in treityng, your vailyeant
curage in werr, your mercyfulnes in victorie,
your clemencie in punischyng, and facilitie in
reconsiliatioun.
            Quhilk thyngis witnessis sufficiently, that
ye estemit na man enemie that wald lyue in
peace, vnder the Kingis authority, that ye wer
neuer desyrous of blude, geir, nor honour of
sic as wald not, rather in makyng of troubill
and seditioun, declair tham selfis enemeis to
God and the Kingis Maiestie, than liue in cō
               cord
and amity with thair nightbouris vnder
the correctioun of Iustice.
            And sen ye can nouther bow thair obstinate
hight with paciēce, nor mease thair stubburne
hartis with gentilnes, nor satisfie their inordinate
desyris, vtherwise then with the Kingis
blude and youris, the destructioun of Religioun,

banisching of Iustice, & free permission
of crueltie, and misordour, your wisdomes
may easely considder quhat kind of medicine
is not only mete but alsw a necessair, for mending
of sic a Maladie.
            And to the effect that ye may the better cō
               sider
this necessitie of medicine, remember
quhat kind of pepill thay are, that professis
thame selfis in deid, and disemblis in worde,
to be enemeis to God, to Iustice, and to you,
becaus ye maintene the Kingis actioun.
            Sum of tham ar conseilaris of the Kyng
his fatheris slauchter, sum conueyaris of him
to the schambles, that slew his Grandschir,
banisched his father, and not satisfyid to haue
slayne him self, murtherit the Kingis regent,
and now seikes his awin blude, that they may
fullfill thayr cruelie and auarice being kingis,
quhilk thay begonne to exercise the tyme of
thair gouerning.
            Vthers ar, that being alliat, nor neir of kyn
to the Hamiltounis, thinkis to be participant
of all thair prosperitie and succes.
            Vthers being giltie of kyng Henryis death,
in the first parliament halden in the kyngis
regne that now is, could well accord, that the
Quene should haue bene put to deith also.
And seing thay could not obtene that point,
the next schift of thayr impietie was to put

downe the King, that he should not rest to reuenge
his Fatheris deith, quhilk they thocht
could not be mair easely done, then by bringing
home the Quene with sic a husband, that
other for auld haitred, or for new couatice,
wald desire the first degre of succession to be
of his awin blude.
            Sum vthers ar practised in casting of Courtis
and reuoluing of estatis, by raising of ciuile
werr, and ar becum richer than euer thay hopid,
and becaus thay haue found the practise
sa gude in time past, now thay seik all wayis to
continew it, & hauing ones gustid how gude
fisching it is in drumly waters, they can by na
maner leaue the craft.
            Vthers of that faction ar, sum papistes, sum
feined protestantis, that hes na God bot geir,
& desiris agane the papistrie, not for luif thay
beir to it (for thay ar scorners of all religioun)
but hoiping to haue promotioun of idle belleis
to benefices, and lamentis the present estait,
quhair (as thay say) Ministeris gettis all,
and leifis nathing to gude fellowis, & to this
intent thay wald set vp the Quenis authoritie
say thay.
            Sum thair be also that vnder colour of seiking
the Quenis authoritie, thinkis to eschaip
the punischement of auld faultis, and haue licence
in tyme to cum to oppres thair nichbouris,

that be febiller then they.
            Now haue I to schew you by coniecture,
quhat frute is to be hopid of an assembly of
sic men, as for the maist pairt are of insatiabill
gredynes, intollerabill arrogancie, without
faith in promeis, measure in couatice, pietie
to the inferiour, obedience to the superiour,
in peace desirous of troubill, in werr thirstie
of blude, nuryshers of theft, raisers of Rebellion,
counsallours of Traitouris, inuenters of
tresoun, with hand redie to murther, mynde
to deceiue, hart voyde of truth and full of fellonie,
toung trampid in dissait, and word tending
to fals practise without verity, by quhilk
properteis and many vthers thairunto ioynid
as is knawin to all men, ye that vnderstandis
their begynnyng, progres and hole
lyfe, may easilie remember, to quhome thys
generall speikyng-appertenis in speciall, and
it is not vnknawin to sic as knawis the personis,
how they ar mellid with godles persons
Papistes, harlot Protestantis, commoun brybouris,
holie in worde, Hypocrites in hart,
proude contempners or Machiauill mockers
of all Religioun and vertew, bludie boucheris
and opin oppressouris, fortifieris of the ifis, &
manteneris of traitouris.
            It is also necessarie to your Lordschippis
to vnderstand thair pretence, that if it be a

thing quhilk may stand with the tranquilitie
of the commoun welth, your Lordschippis
may in sum pairt, rather condiscend to their
inordinate lust, thē put the hole estate in ieopardie
of battell.
            First, it is not honour, riches, nor authoritie
that thay desire, for thay haue had, and als
haue presentlie, and may haue in tyme to cum
sic pairt of all thay thingis, as a priuait man
may haue in this Realme, not being chargeabill
to the countrie, or not suspectit to ane
king, as vnassurit of his awin estait.
            It is not the delyuerance of the Quene that
thay seik, as thair doyngis contrair to thair
worde testifeis manifestlie, for if thay wald
haue hir deliuerit, thay wald haue procurit
by all meanis possibill, the Quene of Inglādis
fauour & support, in quhais power the hole
recouerance stode onlie, & not offendid hir sa
heichly as thay haue done, and daylie dois in
participatioun of the conspyrit tresoun, to
put hir maiestie not onlie our of hir stait, but
out of this lyfe present, nor in receityng and
mantening of hir Rebellis cōtrair to promeis
and solempne contract of pacificatioun betuix
this two Realmes, nouther yet haue hoū
               dit
furth, proude and vncircumspect young
men, to hery, burne, and slay, and take presoneris
in hir Realme, and vse all misordour &

crueltie, not onlie vsed in weir, but detestabill
to all barbar and vile Tartaris, in slaying of
presoneris and contrair to all humanitie and
iustice, keip na promeis to miserabill catiues
receiued once to thair mercy, and all this was
done by commandiment of sic as sayis thay
seik the Quenis deliuerance, and reprochit
to thame by the doaris of the mischiefis, saying
that thay enterit tham in danger, and supportit
tham not in mister, so mekle as to cum
to Lawder and luik from thame, in quhilk deserting
of thair Collegis, thay schew crueltie
ioyned with falsheid, and maist heich tresoun
agaynst the Quene, pretendyng in worde hir
delyuerance, and stoppyng in warke hir recouerance,
the quhilk as euerie man may cleirlie
se thay soght, as he that soght his wife drowned
in the Riuer agaynst the streime.
            It is not the Quenis authoritie that thay
wald set vp in hir absence, for if that wer thair
intentioun, quhome can thay place in it mair
friendly to hir then hir onlie Sone, or quhat
Gouernour may they put to hym les suspect,
thā sic men as haue na pretēce of successiō to
the Crowne, or any hoip of proffeit to cum
to tham after his deith, or they that euer haue
bene trew seruandis to Kingis before hym,
should thay not be preferrit to his paternall
enemeis, yea, and slayeris of hys Father, and

sollicitaris of strangeris to seik hys Innocent
blude?
            Quhat thē shall we think that these mē seikis
vnder pretence of the Quenis authoritie, seing
thay can not bring hame the Quene to
set vp hir, nor will not suffer the king lawfully
inaugurate and confirmed by decreit of
Parliament, to bruik it, with sa many of his
Tutoris chosin by his mother, as ar not to be
suspectit to will him harme, I traist it is not
vneasie to perceiue by thair hole progres now
presently and in tyme by past, that thay desire
na other thing but the deith of the King and
Quene of Scotland, to set vp the Hamiltounis
in authority, to the quhilk thay haue aspirit
by craftie meanis these fyftie yeiris ago.
And seing thair purpois succedit not by craftie
and secreit meanis, now thay follow the
same trayde conioyning to falsheyde, opin
wickitnes.
            ¶And that ye may see quhat meanis thay
haue vsid thir fyftie yeires by past, to set vp by
craft this authoritie, quhilk now thay seik by
violence, force and tresoun. I will call to your
memorie sum of thair practisis, quhilk many
of you may remember asweill as I.
            First after the deith of King Iames the Fourt
Iohn Duke of Albany chosin by the Nobilitie
to gouerne in the Kingis les age, The Hamiltounis

thinkyng that he had bene als wickid
as thay, and should to his awin aduancemēt
put downe the King beyng of tender age
for the tyme and by the deceis of his brother
left alone, and that thay wald easilie get thair
hand beyond the Duke, being an stranger and
without successioun of hys body, held tham
quyet for a season, thinkyng that vther mens
actioun should be thair promotion, but seyng
that the Duke as Prince baith wyse and verteous,
to bryng him selfe out of sic suspitioun,
put four Lordis estimid of the maist trew and
verteous in Scotlād in that tyme to attend on
the Kingis grace, to wit; the Erle Merchell, the
Lordis Erskyn, Ruthuen, and Borthicke, The
Hamiltounis beyng out of hope of the Kingis
puttyng downe by the Duke of Albany, & out
of credeit to do him any harme by tham selfis,
maid one conspyracie with certane Lordis,
to put the sayd Duke out of authoritie, and
take it on tham selfis, that all thynges put in
thair power they might vse the King and the
Realme at thair awin plesure. To that effect
thay tooke the Castell of Glasgow, and there
maid an assembly of thair factioun, the quhilk
was dissoluit by the hastie cummyng of the
Duke of Albany with an armie, for feir of the
quhilk the Erle of Arrane cheif of that cumpany,
ded to his wifis brother the Lord Hume

being then out of Court.
            The second conspiracie was after the Dukis
last departing (the foresayd Lordis separate
from attending on the king) deuysit by Schir
Iames Hammiltoun bastard sonne to the sayd
Erle of Arrane, quha conspirit the Kinges
deith then being in his hous in the Abbay of
Halyruidhous, quhilk couspiracie ester many
yeiris reueillit, the sayd Schir Iames sufferit
deith for it. This conspiracie not being execute,
Schir Iames perseuerid in hys euill intentioun,
& by secreit meanis in Court soght
alwais that the king should not mary that for
lack of his succession, the Hamiltounis might
cum to thair intentis. For the king was yong,
lusty, and redy to auenture his persoun to all
hasardis, baith by sea and land, in down putting
of theifis, and vpsetting of Iustice. The
Hamiltounis luiked on quhen seiknes, throw
excesse of trauell, or sum vther rakles auēture
shold cut him of without children, and destitute
of this hope, first he stopped the kingis
metyng with his vncle the king of Ingland,
quha at that time hauing but one daughter,
was willing to haif maryid with the kyng of
Scotland, and maid him kyng of the hole Ile
after him, & to haue enterid him at that present
time in possessiō of the Duchy of Yorke,
but the sayd Schir Iames euer hauing eye to

his awin scope, hinderid this purpois by sum
of the Kingis familiaris, that he had practised
with by giftis, and specially by the Bischop of
Sanctandros Iames Betoun, vncle to the Erle
of Aranis mother, and greit vncle to Schir
Iames wyfe, and raysed sic suspitioun betuix
the twa Kingis, that brought baith the realmes
in greit besines.
            This purpois as sayd is put abak, the King
seing that his Ambassadouris furtherit not at
his plesure, deliuerid him self in persoun to ga
by sey in France, and Schir Iames Hamiltoun
perseuering in his former intētion went with
him to hinder his mariage, by all menis that
he might, and to that effect, the King sleiping
in the Schip, without any necessitie of winde
and wedder, Schir Iames caused the marineris
to turne saill of the West coist of Ingland bacwart
and land in Galloway, quhair the Kyng
was varray miscontent with Schir Iames and
Maister Dauid Panter, principall causeris of
his returnyng, as diuers that was in the Schip
yit liuyng can report. And fra that time furth,
the King hauing tried out his pretence, and
persaiuing his vnfaithfull dealyng euer disfauoured
him, and to his greit displesure fauourid
opinlie the Erle of Lennox & his freindis
in his absēce, the quhilk Erle pretēded a right
and tytill to the hole Erldome of Arrane, the

present Erle for that time being knawin to be
bastard, as also it was in mens recent memorie
how Schir Iames Hamiltoun had cruellie
slayne the Erle of Lennox at Linlythgow, euin
to the great displesure of the Erle of Arrane
father to Schir Iames, and vncle to the Erle of
Lennox, commyng by the Kingis commandiment
to Linlythgow. Sa the King as sayd is,
vnderstandyng the priuate practike of Schir
Iames, in keipyng him vnmaryid, haistit hym
the mair eirnestlie to mary, to the effect, that
hys successioun might put the Hamiltounis
out of hope of thair intent, and hym out of
danger by the Hamiltounis. And albeit that
Schir Iames to make him self clene of that suspitioun,
soght many diueris wayis to the distructioun
of the Erle of Arrane hys brother,
yit he could neuer cōqueis the Kingis fauour,
vntill finallie he was executid for tresoun, and
tooke ane miserabill end conforme to his vngodly
lyfe.
            The King at last decessit, & leuing a doughter
of sex dayis auld, the Hamiltounis thoght
all to be thairis. For then the Erle of Arranea
young man of small wit & great inconstancie,
was set vp by sum of the Nobilitie, & sum familiar
seruandis of the kingis lately deceissit,
for thay thought him mair tollerabill thē the
Cardinall Beton, quha by ane fals instrument

had takin the supreme authoritie to him selfe.
            The Erle of Arrane namid Gouernour, by a
priuait factioun, and fauourid by sa many as
professit the trew Religioun of Christ, becaus
he was beleift then to be of the same, howbeit
he was gentil of nature, yit his freindis for the
maist pairt, wer gredie baith of geir and blud,
and geuin to iniustice quhair gayne followid.
Thair was in his time nothyng ellis, but werr,
oppression, and brybing of his callid brother
the Bischop of Sanctandrois, sa that all the Estatis
wer werie of him, and dischargid hym
of hys office, and charged with it an woman
strangear.
            In the begynnyng of hys gouernement the
Quene and hir mother wer keipit by hym, rather
lyke presoneris then Princessis, but yit
that incommoditie was caus of preseruyng of
the Quenis lyfe, he beleifing to mary hir on
his sone. But after the Erle of Lennox had delyuerid
tham out of his handis, and the Nobilitie
had refusid to mary hir on his sone, howbeit
he left his ferme freindis, & come to the
Quene, abiurid his Religion in the gray freieis
of Striuiling, yit he could neuer cum agane
to his pretendid clymmyng to the Crowne,
quhilk he had lang soght, partly by fauour of
sic of the Nobilitie as wer alliat with him, and
partlie by distructioun of the ancient housis

that might haif put impediment to his vnreasonabill
ambitiō. For hauing banished the
Erle of Lennox, he thoght the Erle of Angous
to be the principall that might resist him, and
hauing enterid in waird Schir George Dowglas,
to be yit mair assurid, he send for the said
Erle of Angous in freindly maner, & put him
in prisoun without any iust occasioun, and
wold haue beheadid them baith, if the arriuing
of the Inglis army had not stayit his purpois,
by the quhilk, and feir of the murmour
of the pepill, he was constranit to deliuer thā.
And seing he durst not at sic a time put tham
downe by tyrannie, he offerit tham to the
sword of the enemy to be slaine by tham. And
to the effect that thay and thayr freindes, hauing
put aback the Inglis horsmen, & receiuing
an vther charge, might be the mair easely
slaine, thay standing in battell and fighting
for him, he in the battell behind fled to 
                  〈◊〉
               
tham, and sa these Nobill men sa far as lay in
him was slayne, and preseruid by the prouidence
of God.
            The young Quene quhilk being in hir motheris
keiping, he might not put downe, nor
mary at his plesure, he consentid to offer hir
to the stormes of the sea, and danger of enemeis,
and sold hir as a slaue in France, for the
Duchy of Chastellarault, the quhilk he bruikis

in Name onlie, as the Crowne of Scotland
in fantasie, & receauit sic price for hir as tresoun,
periurie, and the sellyng of fre persounis
should be recompensit with. But yit the couatise
of the Crowne that he had sold cessid not
heir, for befoir hir returning hame out of
France, at the troubillis quhilk began anent
the repressing of the Frenchemen and tyrannie
agains the Religioun, how many meanis
soght the Hamiltounis to haue depryuit hir
of all right, and translatit the Crowne to
tham selfis, is knawin baith to Scotland and
Ingland.
            ¶Also after the Quenis arriuyng in Scotland,
sche seikyng a querrell agaynst the sayd
Duike and sum vther Lordis, vnder pretence
that thay had conspyrit agaynst hir, for the
Religionis caus, the Duikis freindis left hym
all, becaus that the rest of the Lordis wald not
consent to destroy the Quene, or derogat hir
authoritie by any maner of way. A litill befoir
the quhilke tyme, the occasioun of the Dukis
conspyracie, with the Erle Bothwell to slay
the Erle of Murray in Falkland, was na vther,
but becaus the sayd Erle of Murray lyuyng,
thay could nouther do the said Quene harme
in hir persoun, nor diminische hir authoritie,
nor constrane hir to mary at thair pleasure, &
to hir vtter displeasure.
            
               
After that the Quene had maryit with him,
quhom thay estemid thayr auld enemie, and
was with child, the gude Byschop of Sanctondrois
first callid Cuningham, estemit Cowane,
& at last Abbot Hamiltoun, not onlie conspyrit
with the Erle Bothwell, but come with the
Quene to Glasgow, & conuoyit the Kyng to
the place of hys murther, the Bischop beyng
ludged, as he was seildom or neuer of befoir,
quhair he myght persaif the plesure of that
crueltie with all his sensis, and helpe the murtheraris,
if mister had bene, and send four of
his familiar seruandis to the execution of the
murther, watchyng all the night, & thinkyng
lang to haue the ioye of the cummyng of the
Crowne a degre neirer to the hous of Hamiltoun,
& sa greit hoip mellit with ambition inflamit
his hart for the Kingis deceis, that with
in schort tyme he beleuid firmelie hys callid
brother to be Kyng, & he (the said Bischop) to
be to him as curatour during the hole time of
his non wit, quhilke had bene a langer teirme
than Witsonday or Martymes, for he thoght
vndoubtidlie, that the Erle Bothwell should
distroy the yong Prince, & not suffer him prosper
to reuenge hys fatheris deith, and precede
the Erlis children in successioun of the
crowne, and the young Prince onis cut of, the
Bischop maid his reknyng, that the Quene &

the Erle Bothwel hated already for the slaughter
of the king hir husband, and mair for the
innocent, wer easie to be destroyit with consent
of all estatis, and the crime easie to the
Bischop to be prouid, quha knew all the secretis
of the hole disseigne▪ or if they wauld slay
the Erle Bothwell, and spair the Quene, thay
were in hope she should marry Iohn Hamiltoun
the Dukis sonne, quhome with merrie
luikes and gentill countenance (as sche could
weill do) sche had entred into the pastyme of
the Glaikis, and causit the rest of the Hamiltounis
to fond for fainnes. But after that the
Erle Bothwell had refusit battell at Carbarry
hill, and the Quene befoir the comming of
the Hamiltounis, come to the Lordis, the
Hamiltounis as that time disapointit, fosterit
theyr vaine hope with a merie dreme, that the
Quene should be punischit after hyr demeritis,
and were a tyme in dowbill ioy, that one
that beying rid of the Quene sche should not
beir ma children to debarre tham from the
Crowne: and the vther, that thay might haue
ane easie way to calumniat the Regent for distroying
of the Quene. But seyng hyr kepte,
thay blamit openly the Regent, quha kepte
hyr in stoir in dispite of tham (as thay sayd) to
be a stud to cast ma foillis, to hinder tham of
the succession of the Crowne, yit for all that,

thare wald none of tham cum to Parliamēt to
further thair desire with ane anerely vote, but
lay back to keip them selfis at libertie, to repro
if all that should be done in that conuentioun,
and to fenze fauour towardis the
Quene quhome thay hatit, sa as if by consent
of the Lordis or vtherwise sche were deliuerit,
thay myght helpe hyr to put downe the
Lordis, that would not put hir downe in fauour
of tham.
            This thair intentioun was opinly schawit,
quhen the Quene beyng kept in Lochleuin,
by commaundement of the hole Parliament,
was deliuerit by conspiracie of sum priuate
men, especially of the Hamiltounis, for thay
assemblit all thayr forces to put downe the
young King and Lordis obediente to hym.
Quhilk euill wyll thay schew towardis the
Lordis at the Langside, bringing wyth thame
great stoir of cordis, to murther and hang
thame, if thay had bene taken prisoneris and
the victorye fallen to the Hamiltounis, and
the same euill will towardis the King in keipyng
the water of Forthe, that he should not
eschaip thayr cruell handis, beyng assuerit if
he come in the Quene of Inglandis power,
that sche of hir accustomate clemencie and
kindnes of blude, wald not abandoun him to
thayr vnmercifull crueltie experimentit alredy

in his father. And seyng that the prouidence
of God had cloisit the dore to all thair
wickitnes at that tymes, thay haue neuer ceissit
since to seike enemeis to hys Grace in all
strange Natiounis, and perceiuyng that thay
had faire wordis of all vtheris, except of the
Quenis Maiesties of Inglād, quha vnderstode
thair fals and tressonabill dealyng, thay turnit
thair hatred agaynst hir, and enterid in conspyracie
with sum tratouris of Ingland, that
wer als euill mindit towardis the Quenis Maiestie
thair souerane, as the Hamiltounis wer
to the Kingis hienes of Scotland. This is nouther
dremid in wardrop, nor hard throw a
boir, but a trew narratiue, of quhilke the memorie
is ludged in menis hartis, baith Scottis
and strangeris and the veritie knawin. By the
quhilke ye may vnderstand the Hamiltounis
pretence this fiftie yeiris and mair.
            After sa many wayis soght by thame to distroy
the right successioun, and place tham in
the Kynglie rowme, seyng all thair practisis
could not auaill, and thair forces wer not sufficient,
thay soght to augment thair factioun,
adioynyng to thame all, that wer participant
of the Kyngis slaughter, and had aspyrit to
slay the Quene of Ingland. And to the effect
thay myght cum to thair wickit purpois,
thay in a maner displayit a baner, to assemble

togither all kynd of wickid mē, as Papistes, renegat
Protestantis, theifis, traitouris, murtheraris,
and opin oppressouris. As for thair adherentis
in Scotland I neid not to expreme
thair namis, nor the qualiteis of the conspyratouris
of Ingland, for thay ar weill enough
knowin to your Lordschippis. Yit one I can
not ouerpas, beyng the chief conspyratour
chosin by thame to be Kyng of Scotland and
Ingland, I meane the Duike of Norfolke, in
quhilke act ye may see how the thrist of your
blude blindit thame agaynst thair awin vtilitie.
First thay chose the principall enemie of
the Religioun of Christ in this ile, accompanyit
with vther filthie Idolateris, to change
the stait of the Kirk in baith Realmes by cuttyng
of the twa Princes, seyng that thair authoritie
stāding, the conspiratouris could not
cum to thair intēt. Next thay respect it in that
proude tyranne, the vertewis that were commoun
to him and tham, as arrogancie, crueltie,
dissimulatioun and tresoun, for euin as
thay had this lang tyme in Scotland, sought
the deith of thair righteous Prince, sa he in
Ingland followyng the traide of his antecessouris,
diueris tymes attemptyng tresoun,
wald haue put downe the Quene of Ingland.
Heir alswa appeiris the Hamiltounis crueltie
agaynst the Nobilitie of thair awin Natioun,

in seikyng thair professit and perpetuall enemie
of Scotland (as his bage beiris witnes)
quha should haue spilt the rest of the noble
blud of Scotland in peace, that his antecessouris
could not spill in werr, by quhilk electioun,
beyng assurit that na Scottis hart can
loue thame, sa can thay loue nane of you, against
quhome, thay haue vsit sa many tresonabill
actis. Thay do schaw also how crueltie
& auarice haue blindit tham that thay cā not
se in bringyng a tyranne to haue power ouer
thame, seyng thay pretending neyrest clame
to the crowne, should be neirest the danger.
And vit for all this could these men be weill
contentit, if by any meanes they could attene
to thair intent, by spoyle & rubberie, as thay
did quhen as they wer placid in supreme authoritie,
or by making of you slaues as thay
did in selling of thayr Quene, begin that practise
quhairin howbeit the inhumanitie was
great, yit was it not in supreme degree of
cruelteis, but it is na moderat, tollerable, nor
accustomate thing that thay seike: It is the
blud first of our innocēt king, euin sic as hath
bene preseruit by wild beastis, nixt the blude
of all his trew seruandis and trew subiectis indifferentlie.
For quhat defence can be in Nobilitie,
or quhat suirtie againis tham that half
murtherit a Kyng, and seikis strangeris to

murther ane vther Kyng, quhome shall thay
spair for vertue & innocencie, that latelie
executit, and yit defendis the murther of the
Regent, or quha will be ouerseene for law, degree
or base estait, in respect of thay that conductit
out of Tiuidaill to slay Maister Iohnne
Wod, for na vther caus, but for being a gude
seruand to the Crowne, and to the Regent his
Maister, and had espyit out sum of thair practisis.
            ¶If this thirst of blud of these Lochlechis,
might be imputit to haistie hounger or any
sodane motion, quhilk causis men sum times
to forget thair dewtie, there might yit be sum
hope, that sic a passioun ouerpast, thay wald
with time remember thame selfis, and after
power amend faultis past, or at leist abstene in
time to cum. But thare is na sic humanitie in
thayr nature, nor na sic pietie in thayr hartis,
for not contentit with a Kingis blude, thay
gaip for his Sonnis murther, nor satisfyit to
haue slayne the Regent, they keipit the murtherar
in the Duikes house in Arrane. Maist
like thinking, as if they honourit not the
doar, thay should nat be knawin as counsallouris
of the deid, and wald tyne the glorie of
that nobill acte. And besides all this thay are
not onelie contentit to mantene Scottis tratouris,
but alswa receifis Inglis tratouris, and

settis vp a sanctuarie of tresoun, a refuge of
Idolatrie, a receptacle of theifis and murtheraris.
            And howbeit the bullerant blud of a Kyng
and a Regent about thair hartis, qu hair of the
lust in thair appetite geuis tham litil rest, daylie
and hourelie making new prouocation, yit
the small space of rest, quhilk thay haue beside
the executioun of thair crueltie, thay spend in
deuysing of generall vnquyetnes, throw the
hole countrie, for not content of it, that thay
tham selfis may steale, brybe, and reif, thay set
out ratches on euery side, to gnaw the pepillis
bonis, after that thay haue consumit the
flesche, & houndis out, one of thame, the Clā
               gregour,
ane vther the Grantie and Clauchattan,
ane vther Balcleuch and Fairnyherst, ane
vther the Iohnstounis and Armestrangis, and
sic as wald be haldin the haliest amāgis tham,
schew playnlie the affectioun thay had to banishe
peace and steir vp troublis, quhen thay
bendit all thair fyue wittis, to stop the Regent
to go first North, and syne South, to puneis
theift and oppressioun, and quhen they saw
that thair counsall was not authorisit, in geuyng
impunitie to all misdordour, thay spend
it in puttyng downe of hym that wald haue
put all in gude ordour.
            Thair is a kynd of these theifis euin odious

to mair gentill theifis, quhilk callyng thame
selfis great Gentilmen spoyllis trauellaris,
cadgearis, and chapmen by the way, and ransounis
pure men aboute Ediburgh for xx.
schillyng the heid, quhilke vice can not procede
of vengeance of enemeis, but rather of
loue and plesure in wickitnes. This kynde of
men dois not onlie dishonour to Nobilitie in
steillyng, and to theifis in purspyking, but also
to the hale Natioun of Scotland, geuyng opinioun
to strangeris, that sum of the Scottis be
of sa law courage, that men amangis tham aspiryng,
to the hiest estait of a Kingdome, haue
crouchit thame selfis in the mayst lawe order
of knaifis.
            ¶Now my Lordis ye may consider, how
thay that slayis sa cruellie Kyngis and thayr
Lieutennentis, will be mercyfull to you, and
quhen thay sall haue put you downe, that
craifis reuenge of the Kyngis blude, ye may
vnderstand how few dare craif Iustice of your
slaughter. Ye may se how cruell thay will be
in oppressiō of the poore, hauyng cut of you,
quhilke beyng of mayst Nobill and potent
housis of this Realme, sufferis throw your
sleuthfulnes euery pairt of thys countrie,
to be maid worse than Laddisdaill, or Annarderdaill,
and not onlie sufferis the purspykaris
of Cliddisdaill, to exercise theift and reif

as a crafte, but nurisis and authorisis amangis
you, the chief counsellaris of all misordour,
as ane Edder in your bosum. Of all thys ye
may lay the wyte on na vther but vpoun your
selfis, that haue sufficient power to represse
theyr insolencie, and proudnes, hauing in
your hand the same wande that ye haue chaistifit
tham with of befoir, for ye haue your
protectour the same God this yeir, that was
the yeires bypast, vnchangeabill in hys eternall
counsellis, constant in promeis, potent
in punising, and liberall in rewairdyng, ye
haue your trew freindis and seruandis that
wer with you of befoir, ye ar deliuerit of dissimulate
brethren, that had thair bodyis with
you, and thair hartis with your enemeis, that
subscribit with you, and tuik remissioun of
your aduersareis, that stuide with you in battell,
luiking for occasioun to betray you, had
not God bene your protectour. Ye haue a
great number of new freindis alienate from
tham, for thair manifest iniquity in deid, wickidnes
in word, and tresoun in hart, ye haue
of the saime enemeis that ye had then sa many,
as hes thayr hartis hardennit, and thayr
myndis bent against God, and lawfull ingraitis,
ye haue the same action, that ye had then,
accumulat with recent murther and tresoun,
to prouoke the ire of the eternall, agaynst

tham, How far God hath blindid tham. blind
men may se, that hauing sa euill ane actioun,
and sa many enemeis at hame, yit be houndyng
out of small traytouris of thayr wickid
conspiracie, men execrabill to thayr awin parentis,
quhome amangis vthers thay haue diuers
times spoylit, by hounding out I say of
sic persounis, to burne, murther, reif, and
steill. Thay prouoke the Quenis Maiestie of
Ingland, to seik vengeance of thayr oppressioun
agaynst hir Realme and subiectis, quhilk
vengeance Iustice and honour craifis of hir sa
instantly, that sche can not ceis but pursew
thame, thayr resettaris and mantenaris, vntil
sche gyif sic exempill to vthers, that althought
thay will not respect vertue, yit for feir of punitioun
thay sall be content to liue in peace
with nightbouris, quhairin hir heighnes hath
alredy renuit the memorie of hir experimentit
liberalitie, and tender loue to this Natioun,
seikyng on hyr propir charges and trauell
of hir subiectis, the punitioun of sic, as
we on our charges should haue punished, I
mene not onely of our tratouris, but also ressettaris
of hyr Maiesteis tratouris, and in doing
of this se
                  •
               kis pacificatioun amangis tham
that violatid peace with hir without prouocatioun,
seuering the punischment of sic as
ar giltie in offending, from the subiectis that

hes not violatid the peace. And as sche kepis
peace and Iustice amangis hir awin subiectis
in Ingland, sa vnrequyrit sche offerid
support to the same end in Scotland, and not
onelie geuis remedie to our present calamiteis,
but cuttis the roote of troublis to cum,
and preuenis the wickid counsall of sic, as
prouokis Inglismen, and solistis Frenchmen
to cum in this Realme, to the ende, that these
twa Natiounis enterit in barres, the ane agains
the vther, thay may saciat thayr cruell
hartis of blude, thair obstinate will of vengeance,
thair bottomles couatise of spoyle and
theift.
            Thairfoir seyng God haue sa blindit your
enemeis wittis, my Lordis be in gude hope
that he sall alswa cast the spreit of fear and disperatioun
in thair indurat hartis, and prosper
your gude actioun, to the quhilk he confortis
you with his redy helpe, exhortis you by hys
worde, and constrainis you by the dewtie of
your estait, and necessitie of preseruyng of
your lyfis and honouris. For promeis beyng
neglectit, sayth violatid, subscriptioun set at
noght, thair is na meane way left but outher
to do or suffer, and seing that baith ar miserabill
amangis sic, as should be freindis, yit better
it is to slay iustlie than to be slayne wrangfullie.
For the executioun of Iustice in punischyng

the wickid is approuid by God & mā,
and sleuthfulnes in defence of Iustice can not
be excusid of tresoun. And besydes that God
schawis him sa mercyfull and liberall to you,
in sending you freindis by procuiring of your
enemeis, also the persounis maist recommendit
of God crai
                  •
               is the same, for saikles blude,
oppressioun of the pure, and of the fatherles,
cryis continually to the heuin for auengeance,
quhilke God committis to your handis
as his Lieutennentis and speciall officiaris in
that pairt, and euin as he rewardis fayth and
diligence in obedience of his eternall will, sa
he will not neglect to punische sleuthfulnes in
iust executioun of his commandementis.
            ¶Thairfoir my Lordis, as ye wald that God
should remember on you and your posteritie,
quhen thay sall call on him in thair necessitie,
remember on your Kyng our Souerane, and
on my Lord Regentis pupillis, committit to
you in tutorie by the reasoun of your office
and estait, anent persounis that are not in age
nor power to helpe tham selfis and are recommendit
speciallie to all Christianis by God in
hys holy Scripture, and defend sic innocent
creaturis, as may nouther do nor speike for
thame selfis, from the crueltie of vnmercyfull
wolfis: neglect not the occasioun, nor refuse
not the helpe send to you by God, but recognose

thankefully hys fauour towardis you,
that causis your enemeis to procure your
helpe, neglect not the offer of frendis. In cais
if ye let slyp thys occasioun, ye sall craif it in
vane in your necessitie. Thinke it na les prouidence
of your heuinly father, then if he had
send you ane legioun of Angellis in your defence,
and remember that he schew him selfe
neuer mair freindfull and succurable, to na
pepill than he hath done to you, and
traist well if ye will perseueir, in obedience
and recognoscence of his
grace he will multiplie his benefites
to you and your posteritie,
and sall neuer
leif you, vntill ye forget
him first.
            ¶FINIS.
