                  COnsyderȳge in my mynde how that dyuers persones in the begynnynge of the newe yere gyue many gyftes & tokēs / I wolde fayne haue cōfyrmyd my selfe vnto thē / yf my pouerte wold haue suffered me. My wyl was good my abylyte was lytyl or nothȳge / yet be cause I sawe dyuers poore folkes geue small thynges of lytyll valour / & receyued agayne therfore good thȳges of moche valoure / I thought with the poore woman of the gospell to be stowe a myte or twayne / mar. xij. vpon some thynge for your pleasure / trustynge to be rewardyd agayne wt ye woman that made a lytyll lofe of a handefull of mele & a lytyll quantyte of oyle and gaue it vnto the holy prophete Helyas.iij. regū. xvij. And this I be leue wtout doubte / yt he in whose name I do it fore / wyl not se it loste / thoughe it were but a cup of colde water. And as to spirituall persones & my souerayns / math̄. x. me thought it best to gyue some goodly pyctures & ymages of our sauyour Iesu of our blyssed lady or of some other holy sayntes. And as I was sekynge about for dyuers pyctures / there came to my mynde for to gete an ymage of loue.
            
            
               ¶Of naturall loue. Capitulum primum.
               
                  BUt by cause I wyst not well where to fynde it / I wente vnto dame Nature & she shewed me many goodly ymages which she sayd came from her parētes

& forefaders / wherfore she loued thē very moche. Neuerthelesse I lyked them not bycause theyr colours faded / & dayly dyde dekaye. They were also comyn to fooles to wyse men to crysten men to hethen men to beestes to fowles & serpentes & lytyll profyte come of them. These ymages be often tymes payntyd vndyscretely & dysceyuably / & doeth moche harme in the chyrche of god.j. And there be many of theym. One that is made amonges kynrede & parentes / whiche yf the holy ghost put not to his hande it is of no valoure but somtyme very noysom / for it maketh men blynde & peruerteth ye ryght ordre of Iustyce / & settyth fooles before wyse men / it takyth awaye ryght Iugemēt contrary to saynt Paulys doctryne & example / for he sayde. Neminem nouimus scdm carnem.ij. cor̄. v. I knowe no man after kynred or carnall affecciō / j. reg. ij. it caused Hely to be reprouyd of god whan our lorde sayd vnto hym / why hast yu made more of thy chyldren than of me / wherfore as it foloweth in ye byble he dyed an euyl deth & his chyldren also / it causeth yt Iesu can not be founde / example or fygure we haue in ye gospel of Luke whan chryst was sought amonge his kynsfolkes:Luc. ij. he coude not be founde / therfore sayth saynt Barnarde. Lorde I can not fynde the but in the crosse.ij. An other ymage of naturall loue / is made bytwene the soule & the body.Ro. viij. The soule loue so the body that it bydeth woo to be departyd therfro / but whan it is ordered after ye holy ghost so yt the soule vse the body vnder the lawe of god / for to do penaunce to encrease merytys to profytte other to chose rather to want all erthely pleasure

and to dye than to cōmytte ony synne / than is it a paȳted ymage / but yf we loue this lyfe for to Ioy here & to dilyte in this worlde for to abyde longe in lustes & pleasures & for ye mainteynȳge of thē care not for ye displeasure of god / than it is a deuylysshe ymage portrayed by ye deuyll / whiche is very peryllous & moche myschefe come by it / as it appereth in the epystell of saynt Paule vnto Thimothe as shall be rehersed after.ij. tīo. iij. And as saynt Augustyn sayth by it is bylded ye cyte of ye deuyl.iij. The thyrde ymage of natural loue is made by twene the fyue wyttes & theyr obiectes / as bytwene the syght & beautefull thynges of pleasant coloures / bytwene the herynge of swete voyce or sounde of hermony / bytwene ye tastynge & sauour in delyciouse metes & drynkes / by twene smellynge & swete odoures / bytwene the felynge or touchynge & all thynges yt be pleasaunt to it.iiij. And an other ymage of naturall loue is made bytwene man & his wyfe.v. The fyfth bytwene contrary men.vj. The syxte bytwene frendes & them that be brought vp togyder frome theyr youth / & all these but yf ye holy ghost worke in them it is easy to consyder what yll come of thē. The Romayns in olde tyme praised moche an ymage that they had / which (as I rede) was portrayed lyke a yonge man standyng bareheed & in his foreheed was wryten. Estas et Hyems. That is wynter & somer / he had on a shorte thynne cote / in whose hemme they wrote. Mors et Uita. Deth & lyfe / his syde was open that his herte myght be seen / his arme was bowed poyntynge with his fynger to his hert / where was wrytē by it. Longe

et prope. farre & nere / he was peynted lyke a yonge mā sygnyfyenge yt true loue & frendeshyppe is alway fresshe & newe neuer fadynge ne faylynge / he was bareheed for to shewe him selfe vnto all mē & yt he was not a ferde to shewe hym selfe a frende at all tymes / his rude & thynne vesture shewed yt a very frende wyl not refuse to suffre harde thynges & extreme pouerte for loue of his frende / there was wryten. Uita et mors. for he yt loueth truely loueth his frende all his lyfe vnto deth and after. Estas et hyems. That is true frendeshyppe endureth as wel in aduersyte as in ꝓsperite / his herte was open for he wolde hyde nothynge frome his louer / he shewed his herte with his fynger shewynge that his dedes doeth accorde to his herte and his herte to his wordes. There was wryten. Longe et prope. For trewe loue in no tyme can be done awaye ne mynysshed by no distance of place. This semeth a good ymage and a precyous / very necessary to this lyfe / whom Plato Arystotle Cato & many other prayse aboue all thynges that be in nature.
                     Eccli. vj. And ye wise man Eccliasticꝰ sayth there is no cōparison to a faythfull frēde. I coude fynde no faute therin saue it loked alwaye downewarde vpon erthely thynges / & cruelly vpon theyr enymyes / yf it had loked vpwarde hauynge respecte vnto god & to heuenly thynges / I had thought to haue bought it / but saynt Paule for ye cause dispysed it sayenge to theym that paynted this ymage though they knewe god they dyd not honour hȳ / Ro. j. loue hym ne thāke hym as they ought for to haue do / but gaue them selfe to vanytees and soo fell to

blyndenes of mynde thynkynge them selfe wyse / and were but fooles & fell to Idolatrye & to many grete inconuenyences.Luc. vj. Our sauyour also refused this ymage & suche other / both for this cause and for yt it loketh so cruelly vpon theyr enymys saynge / yf ye loue onely them yt loueth you for yt cause: what rewarde loke ye for to haue / treuly ye shall haue none of me / for ye haue receyued youre rewarde all redy and this caused me to seke farther.
            
            
               ¶The ymage of worldly loue. Capi. ij.
               
                  THe worlde than callede me & shewed me an ymage that frome farre appered very goodly / all burned wt gold & syluer with many other ryche thȳges set out wt fresshe & oryent colours / & offerd it to me for lytyll valour whiche caused me to drawe nerer to it. And in ye border therof were portrayd / foules beestes / flyes / serpentes / wormes / & floures of dyuers kyndes / so meruaylouse & so like vnto nature as it had be ye selfe liuȳge thynges. The foules appered so rauysshȳge / ye beestes so cruelly deuourȳ
                  ge / ye flyes so defylynge erbes & floures & takynge awaye theyr sauoure / the serpentes so styngynge the wormes so gnawynge & freatynge that I am sure ye sholde a fered to put therto your hande / & specyally one lytyl worme frayed me moche / whiche I can beleue none other but it was a very lyuynge thynge called the worme of conscience. And as I stode chepynge of this ymage with a byble in my hande / I cast myn eye vpon my boke in the

fyrst epistle of saȳt Iohn̄ where was wrytē. Nolite diligere mūdū ne
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   ea q̄ ī mūdo sūt.j. Ioh̄. ij. By not this ymage the loue of this world for yf ye do and loke moche vpon it / it shall bewytche you & make you blynde. And yf ye set your loue vpon the worlde (sayth saynt Iohn̄) ye charyte of god our sauyour crist yt is the very ymage of loue con not be in you. The prophete Dauyd shewed me yt these rauysshynge foules / beestes / & serpentes were lyuynge men / bywytched & transfourmed by reasō of this false ymage / & shewed ye cause why saynge. Homo cū in honore esset. &c. Man lorde of al creatures hauynge in hym selfe ye ymage of god (wherof he ought to drawe out the very ymage of loue) to his hyghe honour / knewe not his degre & hye state ye god hath made hȳ to / but set his mȳde more vpō these vayne outwarde ymages thrugh ye whiche he is cōpared & trāsformed vnto beestes moost vnresonable & is made lyke vnto thē. O false ymage I am sure thy colours be full dysceyuable / thus saint Iohan bad me loke surely vpon it / for ye mater yt it was made of was very brytell venymous & noughte. Therfore I toke it in my hāde & loked warely vpon it / & so I perceyued that saint Iohn̄ sayd treuth where he sayth.j. Ioh̄. ij. Omne qd est in mū
                  do aut est concupiscencia. &c. All yt is in this world other it is the concupiscence of the flesshe or elles ye concupiscence of the worlde or elles proude maner of lyuynge. I remembred also that ye mooste fayre apples be not alwaye best nor longest endurynge. And saint Paule sayth.j. cor̄. vij. Preterit figura huiꝰ mū
                  di. The pycture of this worlde passeth fast awaye

In tyme of trybulacyon it melteh awaye / as snowe before ye sonne. Est amicꝰ scdm tēpꝰ & nō ꝑmanet ī tꝑe tribulatōis.
                     Eccli. vj There is a frend for a tyme & do not endure in tyme of tribulaciō it was holowe and empty / as it had be blowen ful of wynde / & so lyght that it wolde be moued with euery wynde / so bretle that it wolde haue broken with the leest fal / it cleued vnto mens handes & defyled them as pytche and sououred very yll / it hath some waye so madde a countenaunce that it wyll make some fools to Ioye & laughe so moche that they laughe them selfe to dethe. Therfore sayth the wyse man. Bisū reputaui errorē.
                     Eccli. ij. &c. I repute this laughter for a grete errour & dysceyte / sayenge vnto them ye Ioye in the ymage of this loue / why wyll ye be dysceyued for a thynge of nought. Quasi per risum stultꝰ operatur scelus.ꝓuer. x. Thruhe thy laughter this folysshe ymage worketh moche myschefe / for they that laughe at it may be sure theyr laughter shall be myxed with moche payne and the last endynge of theyr Ioye / ꝓue. xiiij shall be ouerlayed with sorowe & lamentacyō. This ymage taketh awaye the memory of man & maketh hym to forgete god and all that longeth to hym / it is so confedered wt ye deuyll that it can not do no seruyce vnto god / for cryst sayth.Luc. vj. Nemo potest doubz dn̄is seruire. No man maye serue two contrary maysters. This is the ymage yt couetouse men vse as theyr god puttynge all theyr truste & affeccion in it / and yet it is as trayterous to them as Iudas was to cryst / & sayd to the deuyll as Iudas sayd to them that toke Iesu.mat. xxvj Quē cum

Thus perceyuynge these & many mo yll propertyes / I sayd with the prophete Naū.naū. iij. Omnes qui viderit te resiliet a te. Euery wyse man that loketh vpon the / wyl be a frayd & lepe swyftly frome the / therfore I

               The ymage of carnall loue. Ca. iij.
               
                  THan I sawe the flesshe stande nere by / callynge yonge persones in to her shoppe by flaterynge wordes / sayenge. Come vnto me goodly yonge gentyll mē / I haue goodly pyctures & ymages for you / ye shal haue one of me for your loue it shall coste you nought. And thus she brought for the a meruelous pycture me thought passynge nature / whose foreheed hyghe sette vp glystered as glasse / ye yelowe here trussed in sylke with a fyne bonet a perle fylette & a frontlet brawdred with sylke & golde set with stones and a goodly broche of golde / the eyes rollynge in the heed / ye countenaunce solen & chaūgeable / the skyn whyte as lyly / with some lyuely rodenes / the necke and brestes bare the apparell all dysguysed of the new facyon with a longe trayne / where appered out ye tayle of a styngynge serpente / but I meruayled moost in ye countenaunce and gesture of it / for stondynge in some place it wolde appere to a mā with

a smylynge and flaterynge countenaunce with ye armes redy to halsynge / in some place it appered as it had wepte & wt ye handes as yf it had called one to her / & in an other place it shewed a lowryng & a dysdaynynge countenaūce pretendynge grete dyspleasure. Thus lyke a foole I loked so longe vpon this ymage / that I was almoost dysceyued but thanked be our lorde I had warnynge be tymes. A certayne wyse man gaue me good counsell and bade me in no wyse I sholde beholde it lest I sholde perysshe and be lost by the false workynge of it.Eccli. xix Dropter spem mulieris multi perierunt. Through the beaute of this ymage many a thousande haue perysshed / and than I consydered ye he sayd treuth in all degres / remembrynge strōge Sampson / holy Dauyd / wise Salomon / & many other how they were disceyued.p̄. c. xviij. Therfore Dauyd axed helpe of our lorde to torne awaye his eyes frō the vanytees of this ymage for they were so allectyfe and pleasaunt to the outwarde syght / that he coude not refrayne hym selfe therfro. Than Salomon coude saye yt outwarde beaute was a vayne and a dysceyuable grace. Therfore sayth he in his prouerbes beholde not this disceyuable ymage for perauenture thou lokest not well aboute / ꝓu. xxxj. yf thou beholdest onely the outwarde countenaunce thou arte dysceyued. Eauꝰ em̄ distilans labia meritricis.ꝓuer, v. &c. For this harlottes lyppes be as swete as a hony combe and the throte of her shyninge more clerer than oyle / but ye last ende of it is very bytter and styngeth more venymously than the tayle of a serpente / he shewed me also that I perceyued not

I was so blyndyd with lokynge vpon the ymage onely / and a lytell frome her was there deth & hell mouth gapynge to receyue her and all that were with her.ꝓuer. v. Pedes eiusdescendūt in mortem et ad inferos gressus eius penetrant. Therfore he bad me flee farre of and come not nere ye gates of that house where this ymage is / for though it be offered frely / yet at ye last it put bothe soule fame and goodes in grete Ieoperdy.Ro. viij. And saint Paule sayth yf ye lyue after flesshly pleasure delytynge in this ymage ye shal dye ghostly a very yll deth therfore sayth he it is not onely good not for to touch it / but it is necessary to fle farre from it and from all that longeth therto / it hathe a foule sanoure to them ye hath good tastynge / it gendereth pockes & leprousy bothe in body and soule / and is so infectyfe that many be dayly in grete Ieoperdy to perisshe therby / yf they haue no helpe and socoure onely of god.
            
            
               The ymage of artyfycers: be not the very ymages of loue / nor but lytyl conducynge to pyete and charyte. Capi. iiij.
               
                  THan leauynge these peryllous ymages I wēte to ye artyfycers yt make meruaylous goodly ymages in diuers maters as ī metall / stone / tymbre / and cloth dyuers wayes / but the very ymage of loue was not there. Neuertheles there was many goodly ymages whiche I though sholde stere a man to deuocyon and to the loue of god. And bycause it was harde to fynde ye very treu ymage / I set my mȳde to by one of these

and as I was chosynge out of ye goodlyest / there came to me a holy deuoute doctour rebukynge me gretely / Iero. de fet̄
                   & sayd why doest thou cast away thy monye vpon these corruptyble and vayne thynges / thy goodes were not gyuen to the for that entente thou arte moche to blame / seyst not thou ye goodly lyuynge ymage of god moost pyetefull fade & decaye euery daye in grete multytude / & yet yt wylte bestowe thy mony vpon these / yf thou hauynge worldly substaunce seyste thy broder haue nede / j. Ioh̄. iij & thou sparest frome hym the treasure of mercy and pyete in thy herte how is the charite of god in the / why syr sayd I may not I spēde myn owne good as I wyl / so that I spende it not in synne: & poore people were in extreme necessyte / I sholde synne deedly yf I sholde se them be loste hauynge more than is necessary for me / but I knowe none suche and there be many that wyll & be more able than I to helpe thē / nor I am not bounden to seke where suche be that be in extreme necessyte.nota bn̄. Thus we fel in to a longe dysputaciō & at ye last he concluded thus / yt not onely extreme necessyte doeth bynde vs to gyue almes but also whan we haue more superfluꝰ / yt is whan we haue more than is necessary to our state / and he ledged for hym the gospel of cryst.Luc. xj. Uerūtamen quod superest date elemosinā. Gyue almes of that that is superfluꝰ / it is to be thought that there shall be no lytyll company / of ye lyfte hande of cryst where he shal gyue sentence of dampnacyon vpon them / rehersynge the lacke of almes doynge / as pryncypall cause in maner? where the sentence is gyuen / he brought in saynt

                  scde / and saynt Ambrose dysputynge ayenst suche persones that sayth thus / I breke not ne take awaye none other mens goodes but kepe that is myn owne / ayenst whome sayth saynt Ambrose O folysshe man what is thyne / distī. xlvij what broughtest thou in to this worlde / is god vniuste for that he wyl gyue more to one than to another / or is he vnryghtwyse for bycause thou doest habounde / and an other man do lacke / it is rather for to shewe the experience of his gentylnes that thou sholdest haue the greter meryte for ye well bestowynge of thy goodes vnto the poore. And for yt the poore myght be as well rewarded for his pacience / and thus he dyde conclude. It is the brede and sustenaunce for the hungry that thou reteynest with the / it is the clothynge of naked men u thou sparrest vp in thy presses / it is ye redempcyon and relyfe of them yt be in thraldom and pryson / ye mony that thou hydest in the grounde (as wel it is synne not to gyue vnto the nedy whan thou hast superfluꝰ)hec ābro. distī. xlvij as it is to take awaye wrongfully frome them that haue ony thynge / therfore be ware how thou spendest thy goodes / why syr sayd I maye not I spende my goodes none other wayes but in almes. Ryches saythe he / is not to be loued for it selfe / but for an other thynge / that is for ye necessyte of this present lyfe. That / that is not necessary nother to the necessary sustenaunce of the body / nor to the honeste and reasonable mayntaynynge of the degree and state of a persone? can not well be ordred but to an

yll ende / excepte it be bestowed vpon poore people / or to the necessytees of crystes chyrche / as to the maynteynynge and defendynge of the fayth / to ye magnyfyenge of godes honour and to thencreace of vertue & good lyfe / & this yu thynkest doth make thy purpose / but yet it is not so / for as it is sayd in the lawe these ymages be ye bokes of lay people symple and vnlerned that be vnperfyte in ghostly lyfe / & yf they excyte peoples myndes to deuocyon as well that maye be by suche as be of lytyll pryce as by thē as be of grete pryce & curiously wrought whiche me thynketh brynge in to the mynde vanyte or euagacyon / rather than deuocyon or contemplacyon / and perauenture some effeccyon or spyce of proprite amonges relygyouse / therfore se thy conuersaciō be holy & meke / and thy doctryne holsome / & let that be the thynge that shall stere people to deuocyon. Thus almoost confounded I sayd to hym / be ware syr what ye saye: your opynyon condempne the doynge of many good men ye be nowe a dayes / whiche honoure the temples of god with many goodly ymages of grete coste of syluer and of golde set with perle and stone grete plenty of coopes and vestementes of tyssewe and cloth of golde & meruelous riches in plate as crosses / cādelstyckes / sensers / chalyces wt many other thynges whiche be gretely to the honour of god. A. ha sayth he.nota bū. I se it is but vayne to preche and teche men to lerne and take example of saynt Ambrose / saynt Augustyn / Gregory / Exuperij / Nycholas / Martyn holy bisshoppes / and suche other in whose tyme were but lytyll of suche thynges / 

they wold haue all thynges yt longed to ye chyrche / and specyally to the sacramentes / honest pure and clene / but not costly nor curyouse / than were treen chalyces & golden preestes / now be golden chalyces & treen preestes or rather erthen preestes / thā were relygyous cladde with heere and sacke / and now they do dysdayne or grudge to were wullen / than were monasteryes hostryes for poore men / & now they be palacyes for lordes and states / than they were apparelled wt mekenes pouerte chastite & charyte / Ioh̄. x. now with sylkes cloth of golde pompe and vanyte / yet yf there were no poore people / I myght yet some what holde with all / but cryste sayth we shall euer haue poore men amonge vs. And also saynt Paule sayth. Templuz dei sāctū est qd estis vos. The tēple of god is a holy thynge yt is none other but your selfe. The temple of stone is not holy but by reason of the lyuynge temple / therfore that is more holy and nedeth more to be maynteyned and anourned / sholde we than go lay vp or spende our ryches in the stony temple / and suffre the quycke of the temple to perysshe other bodely or ghostly. ¶We fynde not that cryste commaūded to haue so costly paramentes in his chyrche / but he commaūdeth many tymes to norysshe his poore people / and now men leue the commaū
                  dementes of god for theyr owne tradycens and ceremones / as ye scrybes and pharyseys dyde / why dyde cryst and other holy fathers of relygyon prohybyte dyuersyte and curyosyte of pyctures / and assygne how many vestementes and coopes with other paramentes they sholde haue to ye Aulters.

But some laye agaynst me / Moyses that made ye tabernacle of god / with grete sumptuousnes of syluer and golde and precyous stones / and Salamon lykewyse the temple / but yt make not with them / but rather more aynst thē / for all suche thȳ
                  ges were but figures & shadowes as saint Paule sayth vnto vs vnder crystes lawe / j. cor̄. x. that is the very spyrytuall and perfyte lawe / therfore we shold leue the shadowe and folowe the treuth auoydynge that is Imperfyte / & take that that is perfyte.

I wente to a place of relygyon and toke a ghostly father / shewynge hym myne entente that I came fore to clarifye my syght that I myght at the leest ones se this ymage.

all that is yll & false / and a Ioyouse vnto treuth and goodnes / it is very stronge for it may bere all trobles & aduersyte / it beleueth all treuth though it be a boue reason / it hath good hope in all thing yt god promiseth / it is stedfast & perceuerant berȳge pacyently all maner of displeasures without grudgynge tyll better maye be / it neuer fayleth ne fade / but the more longer that it endureth the more oryent & goodly is ye colours and ye more strength and vertue it is of and the more pleasaunt it is to beholde / it is so goodly that no creature can praise it at the full nor haue the ful knowlege of it in this lyfe to dyscryue it as it is / Grego. it worketh maruelous thynges and grete / wyghty / and substancyall in effecte yf it be ye very ymage / yf it be not the treu ymage it hathe but small effecte or none / it hathe this maruelous effecte yt what so euer is wrought or done where that is present it is suffycyent and good thoughe some tyme it appereth yll to some persons / j. cor̄. xiij. & contrary wyse all thynge that is done where that is not present thoughe it semeth neuer so good yet it is but of lytyll valour or nought / it vneth & make many men all one and cōfeder them so fast togyder that nothynge can sundre them / Colo. iij. it couereth the syn̄e of penytentes & redemeth theyr forfertes & transgressyons / j. pet. iiij. who so euer haue this ymage vpon hym shall not nede to fere ony parell nor no Iugement may go agaynst hȳ ne nothyng can hurte him / j.

A glasse shewe not the ymage so moche as it is / no more we can consyder his loue so moche as it is / a glasse can represent nothynge: but yf somwhat be present vnto it. So in man can be no charyte but yf god be present vnto his soule / for. Deꝰ charitas est et q• manet ī charitate ī deo manet.j. Ioh̄. iiij &c.

Saynt Iohan sayth / Ioh̄. ij. he that loueth his neyghboure / he dwelleth in lyght / and in hym is no sklaunder ne occasyon of yll / he that hateth his neyghboure is in derkenes / and torneth his glasse frome ye lyght walkyng he wote not where / somtyme in ye myre of other mens synnes / by suspectynge Iudgynge or talkynge of theyr defautes / somtime amonges the serpentes of sclaunder / detraccyon / and enuy / somtyme amonges the thornes breres and wylde beestes of couetous malyce & Ire / somtyme stummelynge amonges swyne in the foule sleweth and stynkyng gore of gloteny and beestly lustes of the body / with many other parillous wayes wanderynge with grete Ieoperdy into deth of the soule for lacke of lyght / whiche is not in defaute of the lyght of grace ne for the charyte of god is not present / bycause the glasse is turned fro the lyght and thā it is so infecte and defyled in derkenes / that it is vnapte to receyue the lyght of grace & the ymage of charite agayn as I sayd before / for it is harde to remoue the foule deedly ymage of sinne / and onely possyble vnto hym that is auctour of lyfe & maker of this glasse. Yf we wyll turne it agayne redressynge our loue towardes hym & towardes our neyghboures / thā shal we receyue this ymage of lyfe agayne. And saye with saynt Iohan.

selfe / for yf we can not loue them that we se euery daye with our bodely eye / how shall we loue god that we can not se.j. Ioh̄. iiij Therfore I may saye ye charite is a lyuynge ymage and the spyryte of lyfe that gyueth onely lyfe vnto the body / and as the body hath .v. wyttes & worketh all his workes by them so ye soule hath .v. ghostly wyttes wherby it worketh all thynge that is merytoryous & pleasynge vnto god.
            
            
               ¶This lyuynge ymage hath .v. wyttes and the operacyons of them. capi. viij.
               
                  OF these .v. wyttes saynt Barnarde speketh in a sarmon shewynge that there is .v. maner of loues. The fyrst is a reuerent and a kyndly loue of parentes and kynsfolkes. The seconde is the Iocounde and pleasaunt loue of our neyghboures and they that dwell together. The thyrde is ryghtwyse loue yt we ought to haue vnto euery reasonable person. The fourthe is vyolent loue of our enymyes. The .v. is holy and deuoute loue of god aboue all. These .v. loues may well be compared vnto .v. bodely wyttes. The loue of kynred accordeth well vnto ye sens of touchyng / for this sens perteyneth moost and onely vnto the flesshe and so that loue is shewed to none but that be nere togyther / touchynge carnall consanguynyte. And as the sens of touchinge is in the flesshe and in euery parte of the body / so this loue is in euery thynge that hath lyfe as well ye Iewes and pagans loue

theyr kynne as crysten men / beestes also & erpētes loue theyr kynne and ofsprynge. The seconde loue of neyghboures agreeth properly vnto the sens of tastynge bycause of ye grete swetnes and pleasure that is therin / & bycause it is moost nedefull vnto mannes lyfe for I can not se by reason how a man shold lyue wel other bodely or ghostly ī this world but yf he loue those persones yt he lyueth amonges & he agayne be loued of them. The generall loue wherby of ryght we muste loue euery man / may be lykened vnto the smellynge in that / that this sens perceyueth thynges somwhat farther of / thā doeth the sens of tastyng / and it hath in it selfe not so grete pleasure and delectacyō / but yet it is very pleasaūt and necessary / so this loue extendeth not onely to our neyghboures but to theym yt be somwhat farther of / that is to aungelles and all mankynde. The heerynge perceyueth thynges moche farther of than doeth the other inferyor senses / so a monges men in this worlde / there be none farther a sunder than he that loueth one that loueth hym not agayne but hatteh hym / for in other senses there is all waye some delectacyon and some nerenes in workynge vnto ye flesshe / but the heerȳ
                  ge in maner goeth out frome the flesshe / as for hauynge ony delectacyon in the flesshe / and therfore it maye well be assembled vnto the vyolent loue yt is onely caused by the obedience of goddes cōmaū
                  dement / Luc. vj. that byd vs loue our enymyes whiche obedyence appereth euedently / to pertayn vnto the sens of heeryng / where the grete occasyon & cause of other loues that I haue spoken of / are taken of

the flesshe yt is of nature and kynde. But the syght aboue all other chalenge to it selfe the symylytude of the deuyne and holy loue of god in that / that is moost excellent of a synguler nature more clere & spyrytual than all other senses / & discerneth thynges moost farre of / and knowe the dyfferences of many thynges / for though ye smellynge & heerynge do perceyue thynges somwhat farre of / yet it is more by drawynge to of ye ayer that cometh from ye obiecte / or thynge that smelleth or soundeth wel or yll. But the syght do not so but rather it semeth to go forth & procede to thynges very farre of / so it is in these maner of louinge. In maner we drawe to vs our neyghboures / whome we loue as our lyfe hauynge profyte & pleasure of thē / we drawe to vs also our enymyes whome we loue for this cause that they myght be as we be / that is to say our frendes. But yf we loue god as it is worthy we sholde do / with all our strength / wt all our soule & mynde / we go frome our selfe vnto hym / we hye vs fast and moost swiftely (as the eye to the moost delectable obiecte) we caste all our loue vnto hym that is onspekably moost hye goodnes aboue vs and all creatures / hauynge no respecte vnto our owne profyte or pleasure no more than the eye can reflecte the syght to se it selfe / but to take it for the moost hye perfeccyon and pleasure onely to beholde and loue hym in whome we maye moost perfytely and pleasaūtly beholde our selfe and all creatures. This is perfyte ynoughe and pleasure largely suffysynge / what nede we to loke for other syth there is none but this witnes / cryst himselfe

in the gospel of Iohn̄.Ioh̄. xvij Hec est vita eterna vt cognoscant te solum deum. &c. This is the very cause and begynnynge of lyfe euerlastynge / to knowe & loue the very god onely and hym that thou haste sent Iesu cryst thy sone / one god with the. And as by the syght is goten moost konnynge and knowlege / so by this loue is goten moost perfite kōnynge and sure knowlege of all thynge good & necessary to be knowen / and as ye se in the bodely senses the syght excelleth all other / the heeryng excedeth the other thre / and so one is better in dygnyte and more noble than an other. After ye ordre and dysposycion of the organs and membres that they be in / so in lyke maner ye loue of god is moost hye / mooste excellent of all loues / & of moost meryte. The loue of our enymye nexte vnto that in rewarde / ye Iust loue of euery persone the more it be extended and shewed the more meritoryous it is / the loue of our neyghboures and company / kyn and frendes / be very necessary / as those senses whiche yf they fayled / the lyfe ghostly sholde fayle / and all the other senses of loue sholde dekaye. If a mā lacke tastynge and felynge / how can he heere / se / or yet lyue.j. Ioh̄. iiij If he can not loue his kynne / his neygboures or company that he is amonge. How can he loue god or his enymye or lyue in the state of grace / it can not be. Therfore these two loues be very necessary & excepte they be groūded in a better respecte thau of nature they be but lytell merytoryous / and yet lacke of them or hatered contrary to them be more dem

                  ytoryous than ye contrary of the two other loues nexte aboue / that is the loue of strayngers

and enymyes. And bycause that these two ye loue of neyghtboures company & kynrede may redely & vnwarely be disordred (as we se by experyence) it is harde to ordre dyscretely the tastynge of mete and drynke and appetytes of the flesshe. Therfore it is necessare for to loke discretely that they be not inordynate / carnall ne for profyte nor ambycyon / lest they dymynysh or dystroye the other senses of loue causynge moche synne and percyalyte.gen̄. xij. Abraham by the commaundement of our lorde forsoke his good / his kyn / and his coūtre / for that he shold not be dysceyued by this loue / and so dydde many other holy fathers / as we haue examples & doctryne of our sauyour cryste (as ye knowe in dyuers places of scypture) Dauyd also stered by the holy ghost sayd. Obliuiscere populum tuū et domum patris tui.p̄. xliiij. Forgete thy carnall loue thy countree folkes and thy fathers housholde / and the kynge of all kynges shall cast loue vnto the beaute of thy soule. Therfore it is necessary to loue dyscretely / so that I loue euery creature in god & for god after ye goodnes of it / not for the profyte and pleasure / for so the catte loueth the mouse / and not to loue more that thynge that is lesse to be loued and lesse that is more to be loued / for charyte is not accepcyon of persones / but it loueth in worde & dede euery persone after theyr vertue and goodnes.j.

                  THus haue I shewed you yt this is a lyuynge ymage by reason of the ghostly sēses that it hath for as ye soule yf it departe from the body / all the sēses fayle and dekay / so yf charyte departe fro the soule / all these senses of loue must nedes dekaye and perysshe and than ye soule is deed. This is the ymage yt all ghostly persones delyte in and haue pleasure to beholde. This is ye lyuynge ymage portrayed lyke a quene and is the very quene of all vertues / to whome all crystē people ought to entende & loke vpon. This is the quene that stondeth alway on the ryght hande of god as ye prophete Dauyd sayth.p̄. lxxxiiij In vestitu de aurato circūdata varietate.

Put dylygence to obedyence & nothynge can be more plesaunt / let mekenes be Ioyned to chastyte and nothynge is more splendent / Ioyne pacyence with pouerte and nothyng can be more delectable. Connynge coupled with lowlynes what is more shynynge / set mercy and Iustice togyther and nothynge can do better / benygnyte set with magnyfycence sadnes or grauyte doeth merueylously wel / & discrecyon myxed amonge all these maketh all the apparell goodly sure and profytable. And aboue all this is ye gylte vesture that I spake of goodly wysdome / whiche is not in getynge riches pleasures and honoures / but in dispysyng them & all other erthly thynges. It is in compunccyon of herte and contrycyon for synnes in exercyse of charytable workes / & in medytacyon and contemplacion of ghostly & heuenly thynges. In study of holy scrypture and the lawe of god and worker after the same. The hemme is perseueraunt loue as saynt Paule sayth.j. tīo. j. Finis p̄cepti charitas est de corde puro & constencia bona & fide non ficta.

The whyte kerchef vpon ye heed was sure hope made by the workes of clennes and dedes of pyte / whyted with dewe of grace from aboue. Lo here is the apparell of this ymage of loue.

of the eeres / but after the very ryght and after ye thought and the entent of man. Therfore yf a mā take hede and is ware what he do in the syght of man / moche more let hym be ware what he do in ye syght of god. The body is cladde in a relygeous vesture it is well / but what auayleth that yf the mynde bere a seculer habyte after ye worlde. They kepe scylence without forth moche more take hede yt ye mynde inwarde be at rest from vayne thoughtes not clateringe with worldely ymagynacions. In the materyall temple we kneele and go lowe to the grounde / what profyte is that yf in the inwarde temple of our soule we stōde sturdely ryght vp aeynst god or our superyoures by dysobeynge theyr commaūdementes / some fast and abstayne frome many thinges that do not defyle man as of them selfe / but shall they not rather absteyn them frome suspeccyon / detraccyon / and frome all ylle sayenge of other / whiche polluteth and defyleth bothe other persones conscyence and theyr owne / many do adourne and make gaye the materyall chyrche and hath grete reuerence to it / but what is yt where the temple of there soule / esech. viij as Ezechiell sayd is ful of serpentes / Idolles & abomynacyons of egepte that is yll & vnclene thoughtes worthy to be suspended / we syng & pray god wt our tonge / let vs se that we do so also with our hert & mynde / we speke fayre and deuoutly with our mouth / let vs meane aswel in our soules / or els it is not well. The body is kepte in wtin a lytyll cell / let not than the mynde be wanderynge all aboute the worlde. It is very well done oftentymes to accuse our self the ymage.

before a preest of our sȳnes / it is treuth yf it be also afore god / whan do we vtterly accuse our selfe before god / whan we vtterly hate our sȳnes and forsake them with inwarde contrycyon for the treu loue and feere of god / for an inwarde woūde must haue an inwarde medsyn / yf ye heere the worde of god which is moost necessary for the soule / heere it inwardely lest it be sayd.math̄. xiij Audientes nō audiunt.

Therfore rere vp an aulter in your temples that is your selfe that be the lyuynge temples of god. There set vp lyghtes gete you lernynge bothe by doctryne and grace wherby ye maye worke teche & shewe examples of lihtg / make there your oblacyons of a meke and a contryte herte / there sence our lorde with brennynge cooles of loue and swete ensence of deuocyon / there kneele mekely with reuerent inclinacyons / there make prostracyons wt lowly feere and compuccyons / there fyxe vp your ymages of loue / there vse your medytacyons and contemplacions / there beholde these two ymages that I spake of before. That one is a gret ymage increate & incomprehensyble that is god hymsefe. Deꝰ charitas est.j. Ioh̄. iiij The other is our lytyll ymage our lytyll loue / created and caused by te ymage of god / as a lytyl ymage in a glasse but yet it is very precyouse and good by meanes wherof the soule hath lyfe and ye ghostly sēces that I spake of. And thoughe it be very lytyll and nothynge in comparyson to ye other ymage that is infynyte and without comparison excedynge all thynges create / yet he wyll haue it vnto ye lykenes of his loue sayeng.Ioh̄. xv.

               ¶To knowe whan it is ye treu ymage. Ca. xj.
               
                  ALbert sayth yt a delycate soule and gentyl in maner abhorreth to loue god by reason of profyte or reward / but as god gaue hȳ selfe frely vnto mānes soule lokynge for no rewarde but wyllynge frely to make mā parteyner of his blysse / so a perfyte louynge soule sholde gyue hymselfe feruently & frely to god in loue wtall his streyngth & power / sekynge no profyte nother traunsitory nor euerlastynge / but onely set all his affeccyō and loue vpon god for his hyghe maieste and goodnes power wysdome holynes perfeccyō & blysse that he is of by kynde / he that loueth god onely bycause he is good and profytable vnto him & bycause of that pryncypally that he sholde make hym perteyner of his Ioye and blysse / he maye be conuynced that he hath but naturall loue and vnperfyte charyte. A very profe of charyte cryst putteth hym selfe in ye gospell of Iohn̄ sayenge.Ioh̄. xiiij Qui habet mādata mea & seruet ea: ille est qi diligit me. He that hathe treu knowlege of my commaundementes and obserue and kepe them / he it is that loueth me / wherupon sayth saȳt Austyn as sayth ye foresayd doctour / he loueth god that kepeth his commaundementes (not therfore that he is compelled for feere of grete payne or for couetousnes of Ioye) but bycause the thynge that is cōmaunded is moost good and honest. The loue of our neyghboure must be lyke maner without ony regarde

of profyte or rewarde / yf it be treu charite lyke vnto his that cōmaundeth vs to loue our neyghbour as he loueth vs.
                     Ioh. xv. There be two euydent sygnes of loue to god in vs / one is whā we Ioye and gladly prayse god in all thynges that pleaseth him what so euer they be / whan so euer / of whome so euer / & where so euer they be do. An other sygne is whan a man is sory in god for all thynges ye be dyspleasaūt vnto hym what so euer they be whan so euer of whome or where so euer they be done. An other rule of charyte / our swete sauyour Iesus putteh in the gospell.mat. xxij. Diliges dn̄m deum tuum ex toto corde tuo / ex tota aīa tua / & extota mente tua. &c. Thou shalte loue god with all thy reason wt all thy wyll with all thy mynde & memory.ex toto corde. with all thy reason without ony errour subduynge ye wyt and vnderstandynge vnto ye meke seruyce of cryst applyenge our study towardes hȳ inforcynge with hole desyre to ye knowlege and syght of hym.ex tota anima. with all our wyll obedyently that is whan the feere of no traunsitory yll dryueth vs frome his obedyēce ne loue of ony thȳge traūsytory drawith vs frome seruyce.ex tota mente. wt all thy mynde & memore forgetynge & settynge of our mynde frome all thynge that dyspleaseth god and letteth his loue / as be Iniuryes done vnto vs / whiche whan they be called to remembraunce be as yren lefte in a wounde whiche letteth the helynge of the wounde. And some men saye that we must forgete our owne synnes after due confessyon made / yf we wyll gete perfyte loue we must subdewe our reason and vnderstondyng vnder ye obedyence of god after his wyll & mynde foure maner wayes. Fyrst in all thynge that pertayneth

to ye fayth / we must obey god and byleue hym / wherof Hyllarius sayth. Soli deo de se credēdū est qi se solus nouit. &c. We must byleue onely god of tho thynges that longe to hym selfe / for he onely knoweth hym selfe. The seconde waye is to perceyue Iuge or consyder yll of our selfe and wel of all other. The thyrde is to preferre the mynde and sentence of our superyours before our owne mynde / and that moost specyally is to be done in relygyon. The fourth way is to consydre our selfe our actes and all that longeth to vs / and to torne awaye our eyes frome the consyderacyon of other folkes actes and maners / wherupon sayth saynt Barnarde kepe diligently thy selfe / and that thou mayst so do.nota bn̄. Tourne away thyne eyes from other men. The rule of charyte towardes our neyghbour is.mat. xxij. mar. xij. Diliges proximū sicut te ipsum. Thou shalt loue thy neyghbour as thy selfe that is after saynt Austyn / thy frende as thy selfe / thy enymye as thy frende / and as euery man loueth that that is good to hymselfe in body and soule goodes and honoure / and exchewe or hate his owne hurte and domage in ony of these foure. So we ought to loue & be gladde of all that is good ony of these wayes in our neyghboure bothe frende and fo / and to hate & be sory of theyr hurte and domage. Notwithstondynge there is an ordre in charyte wherof the spouse of cryst speketh in canticis. Ordinauit in me charitatem.cant. ij. nota bn̄. Our lorde hath sette in me charite in an ordre whiche saynt Austyn declareth this. Primo diligendū est quod supra nos est. &c. Fyrst we must loue god aboue all / nex our owne soules

than our neyghboure yt is aungell and man / than our owne bodyes & ye bodyes of our neyghboures and as for wordly goodes he speketh not of them / for they sholde not be loued / but vsed as a bytter medycyne. Some men declare that we sholde loue our neyghboure as our selfe. In deo ad deum. ꝓpter deo. In god vnto god for god. In god that is for yt he is a specyall creature of god. Unto god that is for he is made to his ymage / wherfore our entente in louynge sholde haue respecte vnto god. For god yt is for that he shold come to blysse & helpe vs to the same. Therfore to honoure god without ende in tyme of prosperyte we can not well knowe treu charyte / nor it is not well proued by loue of frēdes onely. ¶To loue other onely bycause they loue vs it belongeth to nature and it is without reward / but to loue them that loue not vs / it cometh of grace / and to drawe our enymyes vnto loue by shewynge pleasures gyftes and benefytes / it longeth to perfeccyon & hath a hye rewarde. I thȳke there is no thynge yt maketh vs so lyke vnto cryst (whiche is the very ymage of loue) as do / to loue our enymyes and to be well contente with them yt saye yll of vs and put vnto vs grete dyspleasures & payne.
                     math. v. For this I am sure we sholde gete more grace and glory of theyr persecucyon than of theyr fauoure / yf we coude ordre vs with good manner and vse it well for the loue of god. Thus dyde enymyes & tyrauntes profyte moche more vnto holy marters towardes euerlastynge Ioye and glory than dyde all theyr frendes. The very tokens of loue to our neyghboures be whan we are sory for

theyr hurte payne and aduersyte as well of our enymyes / as of our frendes / and be as gladde with all our herte of theyr profyte helthe & prosperyte / whiche be two denty byrdes & are harde to fynde. But contrary the very tokens of hatred / malyce / and enuy / or whan it greueth a man to thynke of his neyghbours / or to speke vnto hym / whan it is paynful for to heere good of hym / and whan he is gladde to let or hynder / that thynge that sholde be to his profyte / pleasure or honeste / & dylygent to promote his dysprofyte and dyshoneste / demynyshynge his good fame / & peruertynge his good werkes. Crisostome sayth that whan malice hath ones goten entresse in to mannes herte / all thyng that be spoken herde or done / be so taken & vnderstonde / that they encrease all waye ye more malyce and longer enuyte. If there be sayd ony thynge of the enymye that is good / it is not beleued or elles it shall be peruerted. If ony yll be sayd / that onely is beleued forthwith confyrmed and multyplyed. Thus dyd not cryste vnto Iudas.

If I sholde

portraye it lyke the deuyll / it is worse than he / for by it ye deuyll fel frome heuen horrybly dyfformed and dayly his malyce doeth encrease thrughe the same. If I sholde make it lyke Nero / yet is enuy moche worse / for Nero brent but a parte of Rome / but this enuy hath set all the worlde vpon a fyre yt can not well be quenched.

Charyte thynketh that thynge to be swete vnto all men that sauoureth well vnto her selfe / yt
                  
thynge to please them that she loueth / it thynketh that thyng that she knoweth to be manyfest vnto all. And thus it discouereth it selfe where it is / for it wyll not abyde onely withinforth in ye wyll / but it must go withoutforth by shewyng of good workes in outwarde conuersacion. O charyte I haue praysed ye as ferre as I can / and yet I caste in my mynde yf there maye be sayd ony more excellente prayse vnto thy laude. I can not saye whether it be more to call the god: or to saye that thou dyddest ouercome god that / that is more yf ony be more / that gladly and boldely wolde I saye of the / thus prayseth Hugo myn ymage. Take it therfore and set it fast vpon the aulter of your herte / alwaye lokynge vpon it / consyder the goodnes of it / remembre the vertue & power of it / se the many folde merueylouse effectes. It caused god to make man / it drewe hym from heuen to erth for to redeme hym agayne frome seruitude of the deuyll / it Ioyned ye moost hye and pure nature to the moost lowe and vyle nature wherin it wrought merueylouse thȳ
                  ges / in resynge deed men / helynge lypers / and all maner dyseases. And at the last it wounded cryst full bytterly / and slewe hym full pyteously / for to quyckē our soules full mercyfully / and resyd hym agayne full gloryously / vs for to Iustefy / it lyfte hym vp agayn to heuen ful Ioyously / there mankynde to gloryfye / it drewe vp steuē vyctoryously / and crowned hym eternally. It conuerted sodenly saynt Paule and fixed hym so fast vnto Iesu / Ro. viij. that nother trybulacyon ne anguysh persecucyon hunger pouerte to go naked sworde ne other parelles / 

coude not dysseuer hym frome the loue of cryst / ye and it made Paule so stronge that he sayd more of hymselfe and his folowers. I trust sayth he that nother dethe ne lyfe / nor none of all the aungelles in heuen nor in hell / ne nothynge good nor yll that is present or for to come / no strong violence nor hye power ne depe wytte / nor ony other creature / can seperate vs frome ye charyte of god / that is in our lorde Iesu cryste / and after them this loue made innumerable people to loue & cast away al wordly thynges / and to ronne after cryst not sparyng nor ferynge / fyre / sworde / payne / ne no maner of tormētes / but gladly toke them with grete desyre / it was but a smalle thynge to thē for to forsake theyr frendes for the loue of Ihesu. And thus not onely in stronge men / but also in women and chyldren weyke and frayle / and in yonge tender vyrgyns yt were made by loue more stronge than all tyraūtes that fered nother kynge nor Emperour / and ouercame them both in wysdome and in strength / for to suffre more paynes than theyr tormentoures coude put them to / and vtterly confounded them. O good charyte O dere charyte / yf I vnworthy defyled wretche haue presumed to prayse the and to shewe thyn ymage thus rudely / where so many holy and noble men haue praised and commended the / but yet nothynge as yu arte worthy / as they wytnes themselfe. I cry the mercy and them also besechynge the to come in to my soule for to kyndle it in loue / to lyghten it with grace / to dilate myne hert / to stretche out my desyre / to open ye bosome of my mynde / to enlarge & stablysshe thy dwellynge

place in my soule. ¶That it maye receyue ye good lorde. Father / sone / and holy ghost / moost hye charyte in to my reason wyll and memory / for a contynuall dweller in me. And lykewyse in you good ladyes perpetually. AMEN
            
            ¶Thus Endeth this lytyll treatyse / called the ymage of Loue.
