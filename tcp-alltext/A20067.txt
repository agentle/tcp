            TO THE VERIE
worthy Gentleman,
Syr Thomas Glouer,
Knight.
            
               SIr, the loue I owe your name
(for some fauours by mee receiued
from that noble-minded
Gentleman (your kinseman)
wh
                  •
                is now imploied
vpon an honourable voiage
into Turky) makes my labours presume they
shal not be vnwelcome to you. If you please
to read me ouer, you shall finde much morrall
matter in words merily 
                  •
               et down: and a
serious subiect inclosde in applications that
(to some, whose salt of iudgement is
taken off) may appeare but triuiall and
ridiculous. The streame of custome (which
flows through al kingdoms amongst schollers
in this fashion) beares mee forward and

vp in this boldnes: It being as common to
seeke patrons to bookes, as Godfathers to
children. Yet the fashion of some patrons
(especially those that doate more vpon mony,
who is a common harlot; then on the
Muses who are pure maides, but poore ones)
is to receiue bookes with cold hands & hot
liuers: they giue nothing, and yet haue red
cheekes for anger, when any thing is giuen
to them. I take you (Sir) to bee none of that
race: the world bestowes vpon you a more
worthy Caracter. If the Art of my Pen can
(by any better labour) heighten yo
                  •
               r name
and memory, you shall find my loue.
            
               Most readie to be all, yours,
Tho: Dekker.
            
         
         
            
            To the Reader.
            
               AN Epistle to the Reader, is but the
same propertie, that a linck is to a man
walking home late: he hopes by that,
and good words (tho he be examined)
to passe without danger, yet when he
comes to the gates, if hee meete with a
porter that is an Asse, or with a constable,
that loues to lay about him with
his staffe of authoritie, more then he needes, then let the
partie, that stumbles into these prouinces or puddels of
ignorance, bee sure either to bee strucke downe with barbarisme
(which cutteth worse then a browne bill) or to be
committed and haue the seuerest censure laide vpon him;
let him bee neuer so well and so ciuilly bound vp in faire
behauiour: though hee be a man euen printed in the best
complements of courtesie; tho he giue neuer so many and
so sweet languages, yea and haue all the light of vnderstanding
to lead him home; yet those Spirits of the night,
will hale him away, and cast him into darkenesse. In the
selfe-same scuruey manner doe the world handle poore
bookes: when a Reader is intreated to bee curteous, hee
growes v
                  •
               ciuil: if you sue to his worship, and giue him the
stile of Candido Lector
                     •
                  ; then hee's proud, and cries mew: If
you write merily, he cals you Bu

               on; seriously, he swears
such stuffe cannot be yours. But the best is, that as in Spaine

               I hold my selfe one: and therfore (Reader) doe I once more
stand at the marke of Criticisme (and of thy bolt) to bee
shot at, I haue Armour enough about mee, that warrants
me
                  •
                not to bee fearefull, and yet so well tempered

               CHAP. I.
               To enlarge Golde, theres a petition writ,
               The Diuell knowes not how to answer it:
               Hee chafes to come in print: In which mad Straine,

                  IN one of those mornings of the
yere, wherin the Earth breathes
out richer pe
                     •
                  fumes then those
that prepare the wayes of Princes:
by the wholesomnesse of
whose Sent, the distempered
windes (purging their able bodies)
ran too and fro, whistling for ioye through
the leaues of trees; whilst the Nightingale sate on
the branches complaining against lust; the Sparrow
cherping on the tops of houses, proude that
lust (which he loues) was maintained there: whilst
sheepe lay nibling in the valleys, to teach men hu
                     •
                  mility;
and goates climbing vp to the tops of barren

mountaines, browzed there vpon weedes and
barkes of trees, to shew the misery of Ambition:
Iust at that time when Lambes were wanton as
yong wiues, but not lasciuious▪ when shepherds
had care to feede their flockes, but not to fliec
                     •
                  
them: when the Larke had with his musicke calld
vp the Sun, and the Sun with his light, started vp
the husband man: then, euen 
                     •
                  hen, when it was
a morning to tempt Ioue to leap from heauen, & to

                  s leaue their
softe beds, to haue greene gownes geuen them in
the fields. Behold on a sudden the caues where
the most vnruly and boisterous windes lay imprisoned,
were violently burst open: they being got
loose; the waters roard with feare of that insurrection,
the element shot out thunder in disdayne of
their threatning: the sturdiest oakes were thē glad
to bow & stand quiuering; onely the haw-thorne
& the bryer for their humblenes were out of danger:
So dreadfull a furie lead forth this tempest,
that had not the Rainebowt beene a watermarke to
the world, Men would haue looked for a second
Deluge: for showre came downe so 
                     •
                  ast, as if all
clowdes had bin distild into water, & would haue
hid their curled heads in the Sea, whilst the waues
(in corne to see themselues so beaten downe)
boylde vp to such height, as if they meant that all
men should swarm in heauen, and shippes to sayle
in the Skie. To make these terrors more heauie,
the Sun pulld in his head, and durst not be seene,
darknes then in 
                     •
                  riumph, spred her pitchie wings,

and lay vpon all the earth: the blacknes of Night
was doubled vpon high Noone: Beasts (beeing
not wont to beholde such sightes,) bellowed and
were mad: women ran out of their wits, children
into their mothers bosomes: Men were amazed▪
and held vp their hands to heauen, yet were verilie
perswaded that heauen was consumde to nothing,
because they could not see it: but to put
them out of that error, Ioue threwe downe his forked
dartes of lightning so thickly, that 
                     •
                  imple fellowes
swore there could bee no more fire left in
heauen: So that the world shewd as if it had bin
halfe drowning, and halfe burning: the waters
striuing to haue victory ouer the flames▪ and they
sweating as fast to drink dri
                     •
                   the waters. To conclude,
this Tragedie was so long a playing, & was
so dismall, the Scoene was so turbulent and was so
affrighting: This battaile of Elements, bred such
another Chaos, that (not to bee ashamde to borrow
the wordes of so rare an English Spirit,)

                     Did not GOD say
                     Another Fiat, It had n'ere been day.
                  
               
               The storme beeing at rest, what buying vp of
Almanacks was there to see if the weather-casters
had playd the Doctors to a haire, & told this terrible
disease of Nature right or no: but there could
be found no such matter: the celestiall bodies for
any thing St

                  chers knew, were in very good
health: the 12. Signes were not beaten downe
from any of the houses in heauen: the Sun lookt
with as cherry cheekes as euer he did: the Moone
                  
with as plump a face: It could not be found by all
the figures which their Prognostications cast vp
their accounts by, that any such heauy reckoning
was due to the wickednes of the world: whervpon
all men stood staring one in anothers face, not
knowing how to turne this hard matter into good
English. At length, the gun-powder was smelt
out, and the trayne discouered. It was knowne
for certain, that (tho there was no pla
                     •
                  e lost) there
was coniuring abroad, and therefore that was the
dambd diuell in the vault that digd vp all this mischiefe.
But wherabouts think you, was this Coniuring?
Mary it goes for currant all ouer Powles
church-yard (and I hope there comes no lies) that
this Coniuring was about a Knight. It was not (let
me tell you) a Knight of worship, or a Knight that
goes by water, or rides by land to Westminster: but
it was a Westminster-hall knight, a swearing knight,
or (not to allow him that honor, for hee is no true
knight that cannot 
                     •
                  weare) this was a knight forsworne,

                     •
                   with a letter to the Diuell, but
no answere could euer be heard off: so that some
mad fellowes layd their heads together, & swore
to fetch him from Hell with a vengeance, and for
that cause kept they thi
                     •
                   
                  Coniuring.
               
               The occasion of sending the letter grew thus:
the temple of the Muses (for want of looking to)
falling to decay, & many (that seemd to hate Bar
                     
                        •
                     arisme
and Ignor ance) beeing desirous to set workmen

about it, and to repaire it, but hauing other
buildings of their owne in hand, vtterly gaue it ouer.
A Common Councell was therfore call'd of all
those that liu'de by their witts, and such as were of
the liuery of Learning, amongst whom, it was found
necessarie, (sithence those that had mony enough
were loath to part from it,) that to ease the priuate
puise, a generall subsidy as it were, should be leuyed
through all the Worlde, for the raizing of such a
competent Summe as might maintaine the saide
Almes-house of the Nine Systers, in good fashion,
and keepe it from falling. The collectors of this
money, labourde till they swet
                     •
                  e, but the Haruest
would not come in, nothing could bee gathered.
Gentlemen swore by their bloud, & by the tombs
of their ancestors, they would not lay out a peny:
they had nothing to doe (they said) with the Muses,
they were meere strangers to them, and why
should they be assessed to paye any thing towards
the reliefe of such lazy companions? there was no
wit in it. A number of Noble men were of the
same opinion. As for Lawyers, they knew there
was no Statute in anie Kings time, could compell
them to disburse; & besides they were euery day
purchasing thēselues, so that it were folly to looke
for any mony from them. Soldiers swore by their
Armes (which were most lamentablie out at elbowes)
that they would be glad of mony to bu

                  prouant:

                  r
and suffered them almost to starue in her streetes
yet some of them went vpon lame wodden legs,

because their Country might goe sound and vpright
vpon their own: they (pore wretches) wanted
Action, and yet had a number of Actions against
them, yea & were ebbed so lowe, that Captens
gaue ouer their charges, & were lead by Serieants,
no siluer therefore could be coynde out of
them. Schollers could haue found in their hearts
to haue made mony of their bookes, gownes, corner
caps, & bedding, to haue payde their share towards
this worke of Charitie, but men held all that
was theirs (howe good soeuer,) in such vile contēpt,
that not euen those who vpon a good pawne
will lend money to the Diuell, (I meane Brokers)
would to them part with any coyne, vpon any Interest,
so much did they hate the poore wenches
and their followers.
               This matter beeing openly complainde vpon,
at the Parliament of the Gods, It was there presently
enacted, that Apollo (out of whose brayne
Wisemen come into the world) shuld with all speed
descend, and preuent this mischiefe: least Sacred
Knowledge, hauing her Intellectuall soule banished
from the earth, hauing no house to dwel in there,
the earth should (as of necessity it would) turne into
the first Chaos, and Men into Gyants, to fight againe
with the Gods. Mercury likewise, for the
same purpose, was forthwith sent from the whole
Synode, as Embassadour to Plutus (who is mon

                  ld
vse, that Gold might be suffred to haue a little more

liberty: And that schollers for want of his sweete
and royall company, might not be driuen to walk
in thred-bare cloakes, to the dishonor of Learning;
nor goe all their life time with a lanthorne & candle
to find the Philosophers stone (out of which they
are able if they could hit it, to strike such sparks of
gold, that all the world should be the wa

                     •
                  t beggers themselues. For you must vnderstand,
that tho the Muses are held of no reckoning
here vpon earth, but are set below the Salt, when
Asses sit at the vpper ende of the table, yet are they
borne of a heauenlie race, and are most welcome
guests euen to the banquets of the Gods.
               The diuine Singer (Apollo) according to the Decree
of the Coelestiall vpper House, is now aliue come
vpon earth: the fountaines of Science flowe (by his
influence) & swell to the brim: Baye trees to make
garlandes for Learning, are newe set, and alreadie
are greene, the Muses haue fresh cullours in their
cheekes; their Temple is promised to be made
more faire: there is good hope that Ignorance shall
no longer weare Sattin. But for all this, Mercury
with all his Coniuring, cannot raise vp the yellowe

                  e him by the lockes. Which mockery the
world taking note of, a mad Greeke that had drunk
of the Holy water, and was full of the Diuine Furie,
taking a deep bowle of the Helliconian liquor in his

hands, did in a brauery write a Supplication in the
behalfe of Gold for his enlargement, vowing that
hee would spend all his bloud into yncke, and his
braines to cotton, but he would haue an answere,
and not according to the manner of Suiters, bee
borne off with delayes.
               The petition being ingrossed, he thought none
could run faster to hell, nor be sooner let in there,
then either a Pander, a Broker, or a knight of the Post,
had made choise therfore of the last because of his
name, & sent it by him, who belike hauing much
to doe with the Diuell, could not of a long time
be heard of, and for that cause was all that Coniuring,
which I spoke of before.
               Wherevpon (entring into consideration, what
shifts and shapes men run into, what basenes they
put on, through what dangers they venture, hold
much of their fames, their conscience, their liues,
yea of their houses, they will laye out to purchase
that piece of Heauenly earth (Golde,) the strange
Magick of it draue me straight into a strange admiration.
I perceiu'de it to be a witch-craft beyond
mans power to contend with: a Torrent
whose winding creekes were not with safety to be
searcht out: a poyson that had a thousand contrarie
workings on a thousand bodies: for it turnes
those that keepe it prisoner in chests, into Slaues,
and Idolaters, they make it their god and worship
it; and yet euen those that become such Slaues
vnto it, doth it make soueraine commanders ouer
a world of people: some for the loue of it would

pluck downe heauen, others to ouertake it, runne
quick to hell. But (alas) if a good head hammer

               Assist mee therefore, thou Genius of that ventrous,
but iealous Musicion of Thrace (Euridices

which sin none but Cuckoldes should be guiltie)

fees he was to pay for her, were Iigs and countrey
daunces: he paid them: the forfeits, if he put on
yellow stockings, & look't back vpon her, was her
euerlasting lying there, without bayle or Mayneprize:
the louing Coxcomb could not choose but
looke backe, and so lost her, (perhaps hee did it,
because he would be rid of her.) The Morall of
which is, that if a man leaue his owne busines, and
haue an eye to his wiues dooings, sheele giue him
the slip, though she runne to the Diuell for her labour.
Such a iourney (sweet Orpheus) am I to vndertake,

               Hells Post through London rydes: by a mad crewe,
               Hees calld into a Tauerne: In which view
               They drinke and raile: each of them by the Post
               Sends a strange message to his Fathers Ghost.
               
                  THe Post therefore, hauing put vp
his packet, blowes his horne, &
gallops all the way like a Citizen,
so soone as euer hee's on horseback,
downe to Billingsgate, for
he meant when the Tide seru'de
to angle for Soules, and some other
fresh fish in that goodly fish-pond the Thames,
as he passed ouer it, in Grauesend-barge: that was
the water-coach he would ride in, there he knewe
he should meet with some voluntaries that would
venture along with him: In this passage through
the Citty, what a number of Lord Mayors, Aldermens,
and rich Commoners sonnes & heires kept
hollowing out at Tauernwindows to our knight,
and wafted him to their Gascoigne shores, with
their hats only (for they had molten away all their
feathers) to haue him strike fayle, and come vp to
them: he vaild, and did so: their phantastick salutations
being complemented, with much intreatie
(because hee stood vppon thornes) hee was aduaunc'd
(in regard of his Knighthood) to the vpper
end of the b

                  ord: you must take out your writing

tables, and note by the way, that euery roome
of the house was a Cage full of such wilde fowle,
Et crimine ab vno disce omnes, cut vp one, cut vp all,
they were birdes all of a beake, not a Woodcocks
difference among twenty douzen of them; euery
man had before him a bale of dice, by his side a
brace of Punks, & in his fist a nest of bowls. It was
spring-tide sure, for all were full to the brimmes,
with French beeing turn'd into English, (for they
swum vp and downe the Riuer of Burdeux) signified
thus much, that dycing, drinking, and drabbing,
(like the three seditious Iewes in Ierusalem,)
were the ciuil plagues that very vnciuily destroied
the Sonnes (but not the sinnes) of the Cittie.
               The bloud of the grape comming vp into their
cheeks, it was hard to iudge, whether they blushed
to see themselues in such a pickle, or lookt red with
anger, one at another: but the troth is, their faces
would take any dye but a blush 
                     •
                  colour, and they
were not made of the right mettle of courage to
be angry, but their wits (like wheeles in Brunswick
clocks) being all wound vp, so farre as they could
stretch, were all going, but not one going truely.
               For some curst their byrth, some their bringing
vp, some rayled vpon their owne Nation, others
vpon Strangers. At the last, one of these Acolasti,
playing at doublets with his pue-fellowe, (which
they might well doe, being almost driuen to their
shyrtes,) and hearing vpon what Theame the rest
sung Ex tempore, out-draws his ponyard, and stabbing
the tables, as if he meant to haue murder'd

the thirty men, swore he could find in his heart to
goe presently (hauing drunk vpsy Dutch,) & pisse
euen vppon the Curmudgion his Fathers graue:
for, sayes hee, no man has more vndone me, than
hee that has done most for me, ile stand too't, it's
better to be the sonne of a Cobler, then of a common
councell man: if a Coblers sonne and heyre
run out at heeles, the whoreson patch may mend
himselfe; but wee, whose friendes leaue vs well,
are like howre-glasses turn'de vp, though wee be
neuer so full, wee neuer leaue running, till wee
haue emptied our selues, to make vp the mouthes
of slaues, that for gayne are content to lye vnder
vs, like Spaniels, fawning, and receiue what falls
from our superfluity. Who 
                     •
                  reedes this disease,
in our bones? Whores? No, alack let's doe them
right,Wise mothers make foolish children. t'is not their fault, but our mothers, our cockering
mothers, who for their labour make vs to
be calld Cockneys, or to hit it home indeed, those
golden Asses our Fathers.
               It is the olde Man, it is Adam, that layes a
curse vppon his Posteritie: As for my Dad, t'is
well knowne, hee had hippes reeling at Sea, (the
vnlading of which giues me my loade nowe, and
makes me stagger on land,) hee had ploughes to
teare vp dere yeres out of the guts of the earth i'th
countrey, and Yeomens sonnes, North countreymen,
fellowes (that might haue beene Yeomen of
the Guard for feeding) great boyes with beards,
whom he tooke to be Prentizes, (mary neuer any
of them had the grace to be free,) and those lads

like Sarieants) tore out mens throates for him to
got money in the Citie: hee was richer then Midas,
but more wretched then an Alchumist: so couetous
that in gardning time, because hee would
not be at the cost of a loade of Earth, hee par'de
not his nailes for seuen yeeres together, to the intent
the durte that hee filch't vnder them, should
serue for that purpose: So that they hung ouer his
Fingers, like so many shooing-hornes: doe but imagine
how farre euer any man ventred into hell
for money, and my Father went a foote farder by
the standard, and why did he this, thinke you? he
was so sparing, that hee would not spend so much
time as went to the making vp of another childe,
so that all was for mee, he cozen'd young Gentlemen
of their Land, onely for mee, had acres morgag'd

or at an out-rop, with the crye, of No man better?
would neuer haue yeelded 50. li. and this hee did
only for mee, he built a Pharos, or rather a Blockhouse
beyond the gallows at Wapping, to which
the blacke fleete of Cole-carriers that came from
Newcastle, strooke faile, were brought a bed, and
discharg'de their great bellies there, like whores
in hugger-mugger, at the common price, with
twelue pence in a chauldern ouer & aboue, thereby
to make the common wealth blowe her nayles
till they ak'de for colde, vnlesse she gaue money to

he car'de not what dogges bark't at him, so long as
they bit not me: his hous-keeping was worse then
an Irish Kernes, a Rat could not cōmit a Rape vpon
the paring of a moldy cheese, but he died for't, only
for mysake, the leane lade Hungarian would not
lay out a penny pot of sack for himselfe, though he
had eaten stincking fresh herring able to poyson a
dog, onely for me, because his son & heire should
drink egges and muskadine, when he lay rotting.
               To conclude, hee made no conscience, to run
quick to the Diuel of an errand, so I had sent him.
Might not my father haue beene begg'd (thinke
you) better thē a number of scuruy things that are

vnder a threepeny Planet, and then they'le neuer
be worth a groat, though they were left Landlords
of the Indies. I confesse, when all my golden veines
were shrunk vp, & the bottome of my Patrimony
came within 200. pound of vnraueling, I could for
all that haue bin dub'd: But when I saw how mine
vncle plaid at chesse, I had no stomack to be knighted.
Why, sayes the Post? Mary quoth he, because
when I prepar'd to fight a battaile on the Chesse-board,
a Knight was alwaies better then a Pawne:
but the Vsurer mine vncle made it playne, that a

               At this the whole Chorus, summos mouere Cachinnos,
laught till they grind agen, and call'd for a fresh
gallon, all of them falling on their knees, & drawing
out siluer & guilt rapiers, the onely monumēts
that were left of hundreds & thousands in Pecunijs
numeratis. swore they would drinke vp these in
deepe Healthes, to their howling Fathers, so they
might be sure the pledging should choake them,
because they brought them into the Inne of the
World, but left them not enough to pay their ryotous
reckonings, at their going out.
               The knight was glad he should carry such welcome
newes with him, as these, to the clouen-footed
Synagogue, & tickled with immoderate ioye,
to see the world runne vpon such rotten wheeles.

Whervpō pleading the necessity of his departure,
he began first to run ouer his Alphabet of Congees, &

               But they knowing to what cape he was bound,
būg vpon him, like so many beggers on an Almoner,
importing, and coniuring him, by the loue he
did owe to Knight-hood, and Armes, and by his
oath, to take vp doun-cast Ladies, whom they had
there in their companyes, and whom they were

these, men must eyther (like Aesculapius) be made
immortall for meere pittie sake, and be sent vp to
Iupiter, or else the Land of Black-amoores must bee
made bigger: for the Great Lord of Tartarie wil
shortlie haue no roome for all his Retayners,

which would be a great dishonour to him, considering
hee's now the onely hous-keeper.
               By this time, Charon looking before him (as
Watermen vse to doe) that's to say, behinde him,
spied he was hard at shoare: wherevppon seeing
hee had such dooings (that if it held still) hee must
needs take a seruant, (and so make a paire of oares
for Pluto) he offered great wages to the Knight passant,
to be his iourney-man: but hee being onely
for the Diuells land seruice, told him he could not
giue ouer his seruice, but assuring him, hee would
enforme his Mr: (the King of Erebus,) of all that
was spoken, hee payde the boate hyre fitting his
Knighthood, leapt ashore, and so parted.
               The wayes are so plaine, and our trauellers on
foote so famyliar with them, that hee came sooner
to the Court gate pf Auernus, then his fellowe (the
Wherry-man) could fasten his hooke on the other
side of Acheron: the Porrer (though he knew him
well enough, and fawn'd vppon him,) would not
let him passe,The Porter of Hell. rill hee had his due: for euery officer
there is as greedy of his Fees, as they are here. You
mistake, if you imagine that Plutoes Potter is like

Lordes gates (hauing bellyes bumbasted with ale
in Lambs-wool) and with Sacks: and checks strutting
out (like two footeballes,) beeing blowen vp

as those Key-turners are, but lookes as little more

comes for enterance to the gate, and to licke

he leaps at their throates; sure hee's a mad dog, for

and whil'st hee was deuouring of that, hee passed
through the gates. No sooner was he entred, but
he met with thousands of miserable soules, pyneond
and dragd in chaines to the Barre, where they
were to receiue their tryall, with bitter lamentations
bewayling (all the way as they went) and with
lowd ex

                  crations cursing the bodies with whom
they sometimes frolickly kept cōpany, for leading

them to those impieties, for which they must now
(euen to their vtter vndoing) deerly answer: it was
quarter Sessions in Hel, & though the Post-master
had bin at many of their arraignments, and knew
the horrour of the Executions, yet the very sight of
the prisoners struck him now into an astonishable
amazement.
               On not withstanding he goes with intent to deliuer
the Supplication, but so busy was Bohomoth
(the prince of the Diuels) and such a prease was
within the Court, and about the Barre, that by nò
thrusting o
                     •
                   shouldring, could hee get accesse; the
best time for him must be, to watch his rising at the
adiourning of the Sessions, and therefore hee
skrewes himselfe by all the insinuating Art he can,
into the thickest of the crowd, and within reach of
the Clarke of the Peaces voyce, tò heare all their
inditements.
               The Iudges are set,Sessions in Hell. (being three in number) seuere

with stripes to make them confesse, for eyther

they are the Beadels of Hell that whippe soules in
Lucifers Bride-well, or else his Executioners to
put them to worse torments: The Inditements are
of seuerall qualities, according to the seuerall offences;
Some are arraigned for ambition in the Court;The seuerall inditements.
Some for corruption in the church; Some
for crueltie in the campe; Some for hollow-hartednes
in the Citie; Some for eating men aliue in
the Countrey, euery particular soule has a particular
sinne, at his heeles to condemne him, so that
to pleade not guiltie, were iolly: to beg for mercy,
madnesse: for if any should doe the one, hee can
put himselfe vpon none but the diuel and his Angels:
and they (to make quick worke) giue him his
Pasport. If do the other, the hāds of ten kings vnder
their great Seales will not be taken for his pardon.
For though Conscience comes to this court,
poore in attire, diseased in his flesh, wretched in
his face, heauy in his gate, and hoarse in his voice,
yet carries hee such stings within him, to torture
himselfe, if he speake not truth, that euery word is
a Iudges sentence, & when he has spoken, the accursed
is suffred neither to plead for himselfe, nor
to see any Lawier, to argue for him.

could tel the first heap of gold, birdlime is the sweat
of the Oake tree, the dung of the Blackbird falling
on that tree, turnes into that slimie snare, and in
that snare, is the bird her selfe taken. So fares it me,
mony is but the excrement of the earth, in which
couetous wretches (like swine) rooting continually,
eate thorowe the earth so long, till at length
they eate themselues into hell. I see therefore, that
as Harts, being the most cowardly and hartlesse
creatures, haue also the largest hornes. So we that
are drudges to heapes of drosse, haue base & leane
consciences, but the largest damnation. There appeared

betweene the Gods) hauing bin
of a message from Ceres, to her
daughter Proserpine, (the Queen
of lower Affrica,
                  Lucian in Dialog. finding Charon idle in his boat, because
(as if it had bene out of Terme time) no Fares
was stirring, fel to cast vp old reckonings, between
himselfe, & the weatherbeaten Sculler, for certain
tryfling money, layd out about Charons businesse.
So that the Knight slipping in like a Constable to
part a Fray, was requested to be as Arbitator.
               The first Item that stood in his Bill, was,
For nayles to mend your Wherrie, when twoo

               Those Butter-boxes (sayes Charon) owe me a peny
vpon the foote of that account: For I could distill
out of them but onely three poore drops of siluer
for the voyage, & all my losse at Sea. Whats next?
               Item, laid out for pitch to trim your boat about
the middle of the last plague, because she might go

light & vare, and do her labour cleanly, xj. pence.
               I am ouer-reckoned that odde penny, (quoth
Charon, and Ile neuer yeeld to pay it, but vi & armis,
that's to say, by lawe. I disburst it (by my Caducens

               Item laid out for Iuniper to persume the boate,
when certain Frenchmē
                   were to go by water: j. ob.
I, a pox on them, who got by that? on.
               Item lent to a company of Countrey-players, being
nine in number, one sharer, & the rest Iourneymen,
that with strowling were brought to deaths door,
xiij. d. ob. vpon their stocke of apparell, to pay for

but their ragges serued to make me Swabbers, because
they neuer fetcht it againe, so that belike hee
proued a god Lord and master to them, and they
made new Pergementiri. Tickle the next Minkin.
               Item, when a Cobler of Poetrie, called a Playe patcher,
was condemned with his Catte to be duckt
three times in the cucking-stoole of Pyriphlegeton,
(beeing one of the scalding Riuers,) till they both

dropt again, because he scolded against his betters,
and those whom hee liued vppon, laid out at that

two and fiftie holes in your sailes, and to a Botcher
for halfe a dayes worke about it: vij. pence.
               That botcher I preferd to be Lucifers Tailer, because
he workes with a hot needle and burnt
threede, and that seuen pence he gaue me for my
good will, why should not I take bribes as well as
others, I will clip that money, and melt it. Not for
my Bill (sayes the Herald of the gods) for it went
out of my purse, the Tayler may pay it▪ backe againe,
it is but stealing so much the more, or cutting
out 5. quarters to a garment, nay, Mercurie,
you shall filch for vs both, for all the gods know
you are a notable Pick-pocket, as the knight of the
Post here can take his oath, but what is your Summa
totalis, (quoth Charon) Summa totalis, answeres
the other comes to three shillings and a pennie.
The Scullèr told him, hee was now out of Cash,
it was a hard time, he doubts there is some secrete
Bridge made ouer to Hell, and that they steale

               But howsoeuer the market goes, beare with me,
(quoth Charon) till there come another plague, or

till you heare of such another battaile as was at
Newport, or till the Dunkirks catch a Hoy of Hollanders,
and tumble them ouer-boord, or til there
be more ciuill Wars in France, or if Pa

wipe off this olde score, but hope to make mee a

                  y: and vnderstanding, because hee could not

knight gone.
               Scarce was hee out of kenne, but on the other
side of the Riuer stoode a companie crying out
lustily,William Eps his death. A Boat, hey, a Boat, hey, and who should
they be but a gallant troope of English spirits (all
mangled) looking like so many old Romans, that
for ouercomming death in their manly resolutions,
were sent away out of the field, crowned with
the military honour of Armes. The foremost of
them was a personage of so composed a presence,
that Nature and Fortune had done him wrong, if

                     •
                  hey had not made him a souldier. In his countenance,
there was a kinde of indignation, fighting
with a kind of exalted ioy, which by his very gesture
were apparantly descipherable, for he was iocond,
that his soule went out of him in so glorious
a triūph; but disdainfully angry, that she wrought

her enargement through no more daungers: yet
were there bleeding witnesses inow on his breast,
which testified, he did not yeelde till he was conquered,
and was not conqu
                     •
                  red, till there was left
nothing of a man in him to be ouercome. For besides

                     •
                  hose Mortui & Muti testes, which spake most
for him, when he himselfe was past speaking,
(thogh their mouthes were stopped with scarres)
he made shift to lay downe an ouer-plus of life,
(when the debt was discharged at one mortall
payment before) onely to shew in what abiect
account he held deathes tyranny. Charon glowring
vpon him, demanded who he was, but hee
skorning to be his owne Chronicle, and not suffering
any of the rest to execute the office, they al
leaped into the Ferry. Amongst whome, one that
sate out of his hearing, but within the reach of the
Waterman, (to shorten the way) discoursed all,
thus:
               
                  England (quoth hee) gaue him breath, Kent
education, he was neuer 
                     •
                  uer-maistered, but by
his own affections: against whom, whensoeuer he
got the victorie, there was a whole man in him: he
was of the sword, and knewe better how to ende
quarrels, then to beginne them; yet was more apt
to begin, then other (better bearded) were to answer,
with which (some that were euer bound to
the peace) vpbraided him as a blemish. His country
barring him (for want of action) of that which
he was borne to inherit, (same) he went in quest
of it into the Low Countries, where (by his deare

earnings) hee bequeathed that to those of his
name, with nothing, but his name seemed to depriue
him of in England. Ost-end beeing besieged,
hee lost one of his eyes, whilst hee looked
ouer the walles, which first storme did rather
driue him on to more dangerous aduentures,
though to the hazard euen of a shipwracke, (then
like a fearefull Merchant) to runne his fortunes
and reputation on ground, for the boysterous
threatnings of euery idle billow. So this his resolution
set vpon his rest, to leaue all the remainer of
his body to that Countrey, which had take from
him one of the best iewells of his life, since it had a
peece of him, he would not so dishonor the place,
as to carry away the rest broken. Into the field
therefore comes he, the sates putting both his eies
into one, (of purpose) because he should looke vpon
none but his enemies: where, a battaile being
to be sought, the desert aduanced him to aduance
the Colours; by which dignitie, he became one of
the fairest markes, which was then to be shot at:
and where a great part of that daies glory was to
be wonne; for the Regent that followed his Ensigne,
(by being hardly set to) giuing ground, and
the enemies ambition, thirsting after his Colours,
threw at all, in hope to winne them. But the destinies
(who fought on their side) mistooke themselues,
and in steede of striking the Colours out
of his hand, smote him: in so much, that hee was
twice shot, & twice runne through the body, yet
wold not surrender his hold for al those breaches,

but stripping the prize for which they stroue, off
from the staffe that helde it vp, and wrapping his
dying bodie in it, drewe out his weapon, with
which before his Collours could bee called his
winding sheete, he threwe himselfe into the thickest
of danger: where after he had slaine a horseman,
and two other; most valiantlie, hee came
off (halfe dead, halfe aliue,) brauely deliuering vp
his spirit in the ar
                     •
                  es of none but his friendes and
fellow souldiers.
               So that (as if Fortune had beene iealous of her
owne wauering,) death (at her intreatie) tooke
him away, in the noone-tide of a happinesse; lest
anie blacke euenings ouercasting should spoyle it
with alteration. He was married to the honour
of a fielde in the morning, and died in the Armes
of it the same day, before it was spoyled of the
mayden-head: so that it went away chaste and
vnblemishable. To conclude, (Father Sculler)
because I see wee are vppon landing, heere is as
much as I can speake in his praise: he dyed Auncient
in the very middest of his youth.
               
                  Charon hum'de and and cryde well: and hauing
rid his boat of them, dyrected
them to those happie places,
which were alotted out
to none but
Martialists.
