Christ descended, or ascended thither: and what hee should do there: are questions no lesse doubtful then necessary: doutfull,Queston doutfull. for that the Doctors are variable: necessarye to be knowne, for auoiding of fables, and pernicious heresies.
            These matters were disputed in Cambridge at the commencement, in the yeare of Christ. 1552. Doctor Perne then Uicechauncelor, began thus against the defendent. All the Scriptures, all the Doctors, and generall Councels are contrary to your assertion. Not so, saith the defendent: for the Scriptures are all with me

Young his Argument more at large, repeating the 24. verse of the 2. of the Actes, after the old Latine translation, on this sorte: Whom God hath raised, loosing the sorrowes of hell. The defendant denied y• Translation, and recited the Greeke wordes, & translated them truly, according to the mind of Peter, on this manner: Whome God hath raised, loosing the sorrowes of death To that sir Iohn Cheeke aunswered thus: he did not loose the sorrowes of Death, but the sorrowes of Hel.It was God that losed the sorowes of death and not Christ▪
                Not so, saith the defendaunt: for it is in Greeke, Death, & not Hel. Then called Sir Iohn Cheeke for a Greeke Testament, and founde it euen so as the defendaunt had aduouched. Then said sir Iohn Cheeke, the Disputation is at an ende, vnlesse you will graunt for disputation sake, y• 
               Infernus is taken in this place for the Graue: otherwise I haue no scope to reason: contente saith the defendant: for Sheol signifieth ye graue. Because saith Sir Iohn Cheeke, that you reason after the order of Socrates, I will reason

with you Socraticallye, and thus hee began. Are there any sorrowes in the graue? the defendant aunswered, that there were sorrowes in y• Graue by Prosopopoia: & so reasoneth Paule saying y• euery creature desireth his renouatiō: thus he writeth. For the earnest expectation of the creature abideth, looking when the sonnes ofRom. 8. 19. 
                        〈◊〉
                      21. 22. God shall appeare: because the creature is subiect to vanity, not willing, but for him which hath subdued the same in hope: for the creature it selfe shall be made free frō the bōdage of corruptiō into the glorious liberty of the sonnes of God. For we knowe y• euery creature groneth with vs also▪ and trauaileth in paiue with vs, euen vnto this time. The time was spent by this kind of reasoning, and such like, vntill that Doctor Perne gaue sentence, determining that Christes bodye laye in the graue▪ but his soule wente into hell. This his conclusion (as his opinion was then) is vtterly subuerted by this booke.

               That is my meaninge, notwithstanding paradise by a Metaphor ys taken for prosperitie and pleasant places. To the which Tirus, and Assiria, and the lande of Israell are compared Ezech 27. 28. 31. 36. Ioel. 2. Gen. 13. By the lyke metaphor in the newe Testament it is taken for felicitie, forparadise is he auen. the bosome of Abraham, and the kingdome of heauen. Luk. 23. 2 Cor 12.

Wherefore certayne of the gre kes, as Chrisostome, Theodoret, & Epiphanius accuse such dreamers, and specially they reproue Origene with certaine Heriticks, who either expounded paradise allegorically or anagogically. The Iewes are more monstrous and phantasticall, who saye that god prepared paradise before the creation to receue the iust as thei departed: which is not so, but it may be a figure of heauenly felicitie, which was prepared to that effecte before the foundation of the worlde, Ephesi. 1.

sonne Ioseph, who were both ful of faith and good workes: then muste needs the Fathers before Christ descende into hell, and came not oute till Christ fetched them out.
            
            
               Carlil.
               Why doe you saye that Iacob went to Hell, when as al our English Bibles, say that he wente into his graue? Is the graue hell? Resteth not the bodye there withoutSheol, the graue. life, without senses, withoute payne or tormentes? There is paine intollerable in hell without release, tormentes without intermission, and damnation withoute ende. The text sayth not after your translation that the soule of Iacob descended into Hell, but it saythe that Iacob went into Sheol, meaning his body without life and senses.
            
            
               Smith.
               I meane that Iacobs soule went to hell.
            
            
               Carlil.
               But the text saith, that itGen. 4

                  Iacob. Are there any graye heades

in hell? Are you not ashamed so to Dreame, so to affirme, and so to write? When wee saye that Iacob, or any other man is dead, we meane not that his soule is dead, whiche can not dye, for it is immortall. A deade man is called a man, but a soule is neuer called a man after that it is departed, but a soule. Wherefore by your owne fantasie it was the bodye of Iacob that went to hell. Iacob sayde that they would bring his gray heares to the graue: hee doeth not call his gray heares his soule, neither are there any graye heares in heauen nor yet in hell: for they consume in the graue. It is oure Englishe phrase that when wee are offended with our vnthriftie children, wee say that they will bring our graye heares to the graue with sorrowe.

               I followe S. Hieromes translation, which hath in Infernum, into hell. I knowe that all your Englishe Bibles putte the graue

for hell. Shall we giue more credit to your Englishe translations, then to S. Hierome, then to all the Greke and Latin Doctors, which haue hel and not the graue, in their writings and expositions?

Thus muche the councel kept at Vienna in France a littel way from Lyons in the yeare of Christ 1309. Lib. 5. Clement. Tit. 3. S. Hierome
                   did not translate the Bible out of the Greke, but out of the Hebrue, and therby did correct the Greke and Latin translations, and the same councel geueth Augustine, who willeth all men to consider the propertye of euery tounge, and especially the Hebrue, and Greke. August. lib. 1. de sermone Domini in mont. in lib. retract. 1. cap. 7. ad Volusian. epist. 1. contra
                     
                     Faust. Manich. lib. 11. de doctrina christiana. lib. 1. ca. 5. li. 2. cap. 15. Now seeing that the propertie of euerie thinge, the truth of the Text, the righte sense of the Scripture is to bee had out of the Hebrue toung and phrase, we must runne to it, as to the fountayne.
            
            
               Smith.
               I vnderstand not Hebrue, no more did S. Augustine, nor Chrisostome, but in obscure places they asked the Iewes what was the propertie of this worde or that, and of this phrase or that phrase.
            
            
               Carlil.
               
                  Sheol in this place is the Graue, as it is in the 44. Chap. vers. 31. where the Sonnes of Iacob said, they should bring the gray heade of their father to the Graue. In all these places Sheol, is takenSheol. Gen. 37. 35. Gen. 44. 31. gen. 42. 38, for the graue. This Sheol S. Hierome translateth Infernum, which is a place belowe where the bodies are buried, meaning therby a graue So wryte also Photius, and Theodoret.

                  mon, which two maisters rewarded their seruantes in the two forsaid places, whereby I gather that there were but two places, one of Ioye, the other of Payne. Two maysters, the one good, the other euyll, two kinde of people, the one faythfull, the other vnfaythfull.
               And, as for a thyrde place, a thirde mayster, and a thirde people, the Scripture proueth none, neither doe I beleeue that there is anye. And I nothing doubte but if oure Romishe Catholikes should be enforced gratis, euen as charity doth binde, to doe their workes of redemption, and to receiue nothing for their paines for releeuing the pore soules, they would right shortly be perswaded and contented to let the

place goe after the profite and lucre, which now enforceth them so feruently to defend the same with sworde and fyre. But as Chryst mentioneth but two maysters and two places after this life, one for the elect and an other for the reprobate: so S. Augustine vtterly denyethAugustine. the third place.

                  You saye that Christ fetched out

onely the obedyent, and faithfull,Christ fetched out of hell nether the obedient nor disobedient. these were disobedyent, & vnfaithfull, ergo by your owne iudgement he went not thether for their cause, if not for their cause, then may youAugust.

How coulde he preach or fetch out Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob, with the rest, when as they were long after the floud, and these before the floud: They were Godly men, the other desperate: they were not in hell, the othere were there without redemtion. Peter saith that it was the spirite of Christ ye preached to the obstinate, and that in the time of Noac, before hée toke mans nature vpon him.
                  The papistes say that it was soule of CHRIST.
                  Howe coulde his Soule preachē before it was? Before hée was man? before hée was created, and ioyned to the body.
                  That whiche was not in the tyme of NOAC coulde not

                  Is it credible that Christ did onely preache in hell to them that were desperate in the dayes of NOAC, and not to others aswell? were there none desperate but they of NOACS dayes? was not Cain before them desperate? and Esau after the floud?

                  Wherefore this Spirite of Christ preached not in hell.

You say that CHRIST delyueredEuodius. Epist. 99. August. them that were in the state of Saluation, either such faithefull Fathers, as were in Limbus Patrum: or suche as were neither so good, as to bée in Limbus, nor so despreate as to be in hell, but to be as Newters, and in a meane, and therefore in purgatory.
                  But Peter saythe that this Spirite of CHRIST perached to the Obstynate and Desperate Gyantes, and that in the dayes of NOAC.
                  
                  If hée had preached in Hell, should not hee as well haue Preached to CAIN, and suche other as were before the floude, as to ESAV, and IVDAS, and suche like, whiche were after the floude.
                  If hée Preached to the Faithfull, as you saye, why dothe hée name the vnfaithfull.
                  Wherefore PETERS meanynge ys easelye to bée perceiued

of the wise, well knowen of the learned, and fully awnswered to them that will not cal white black,Euodius Epist. 99. and blacke white. If we should say, saith Augustine, that they that are in hell can beleue in Christ, what absurdities should folowe contrary to our faith? And howe coulde they haue bene deliuered out of hell, if they had not beleued in him? is there any deliuery, any saluation, any redemtion without him. This place of Peter, saith Augustine, doth not pertaine to hell, but to those dayes rather of Noac: the forme whereof he applieth to these dayes. Thus much Augustine, with a manifest explanatiō of this place, after the same order and maners that I do.
                  The Spirite of Christe preached where there was amendemente of Lyfe, and there where the floud ouerflowed, where the arke was made, were 120. Yeares of repentance was giuen, where eight

persones were saued, where Noe preached, but none of these were in hell, ergo this place is not vnderstand of Christ beinge in hell.

dye not, then it folowethe ye hée rose from the bodyes that were dead, and not from them that liued. If his Soule went to hell, whether went it before the body was buried or after. If before, why saithe the Crede that it went after. But if it went at all, it must nedes go immediatly so sone, as it departed out of the body which was vpon the crosse and at three of the clocke, at after noone, for the body was buried two or thrée houres after about six of the clocke or a litell before.
                  Where was the Soule all that while? if it had gone to hell▪ why did not the Crede place it before his buryall? for euery mans Soule is placed either in heauen, or hell before the body be buried.

                  This kind of spech is oftentimes in scripture, to saye that the soule and lyfe is gone out of the bodye, when as it is but sickened, greued and vexed, as Psa. 107. ver. 5. They were so hongry and thirstie, that their lyfe and soule failed them, notwithstanding they were not deade. So Knataph is vsed psal. 61. verse 3.
                  
                  A certaine magistrate came to Christ, and sayd that his daughter was dead: But Christ said that she was not dead but slept. Mat. 9. 9. 18. 24. 25. 24.
                  
                  There was one that brought his Sonne, who had a dumbe spirit to

Christ, which when Christ had expulsed, the chylde was as good as dead. In somuch, that many sayde that he was dead. Mar. 9. 17. 26.
                  
                  There is a manifest place, Act. 20. ver. 7. 10 where a yongman one Eutichus fell out of a window, and they toke him vp dead. Notwithstanding Paul saith that the lyfe was in him.

               as we in them do reade.
            
            
               In th'holy ghost I do beleue,
               who doth our hartes inflame.
               And causeth vs to worship God
               and call on Christes name.
            
            
               
               I do beleue there is a church,
               a spouse most chaste & pure,
               A faithfull & elected flocke
               which euer shall endure.
            
            
               I do beleue God will forgiue
               my sinnes & life mispent,
               And of as many as their faultes
               vnfainedly repente.
            
            
               I do beleue God will restore
               and raise out of the grounde,
               All mē that are consumde with death
               with a loude voice and sounde.
            
            
               I do beleue after this life
               to fi
                     •…
                  e an other out,
               Better then this ten thousand folde,
               of this I haue no doute.
