            DEMOCRITVS IVNIOR to the Reader.
            
               GEntle Reader, I presume thou wilt be very inquisitiue to knowe what personate Actor this is, that so insolently intrudes vpon this common Theater, to the worlds view, arrogating another mans name, whence hee is, why he doth it, and what hee hath to say? Although, as 
                  Seneca in ludo in mortem Claudii Caesaris.
                hee said, Primum sinoluero, non Respondebo, quis coacturus est? I am free borne, and may chuse whether I will tell, who can compell me? And could here readily reply with that Aegyptian in 
                  Lib. de curiositate.
                
               Plutarch, when a curious fellowe would needs knowe what he had in his basket, quum vides velatam, quid inquiris in rem obsconditam, it was therefore couered because he should not knowe what was in it. Seeke not after that which is hid, if the contents please thee, 
                  Modo haec tibi vsui sint quemuis authorem fingito. Wecker.
                
               and bee for thy vse, suppose the man in the Moone, or whom thou wilt to bee the Author; I would not willingly be knowne. Yet in some sort to giue thee satisfaction, which is more then I need, I will giue a reason, both of this vsurped Name, Title, and Subiect. And first of the name of Democritus, least any man by reason of it should be deceaued, expecting a Pasquill, a Satyre, or some ridiculous Treatise (as I my selfe should haue done) or some prodigious Tenent, or paradox of the earths motion, of infinite worlds in infinito vacuo, ex fortuita Atomorum collisione, in an infinite wast, so caused by an accidentall collision of motes in the Sunne, all which Democritus held, Epicurus and their master Leucippus of old maintained, and are lately

reuiued by Copernicus, Brunus, and some others. Besides it hath been alwaies an ordinary custome, as

                teach others how to preuent and auoid it: which good intent of his Hippocrates highly commended, and Democritus Iunior is therefore bold to imitate, and because he left it vnperfect, to prosecute and finish in this Treatise.

Howsoeuer it is a kind of policy in these dayes, to prefixe a phantasticall title to a booke which is to be sold, for as larkes come downe to a day-net, many vaine Readers will tarry & stand gasing like silly passengers, at an Anticke picture in a painters shoppe that will not looke at a iudicious piece.

Be it therefore as it is, well or ill, I haue assaid. Pro captu lectoris habent sua fata libelli, let the world iudge, and so it will, and when all is done: laudamur ab his culpamur ab illis. 'Tis the common fate of all writers, and I must endure it.
            One or two things yet I would haue amended if I could, That is, first to haue reuised the copie, and amended the stile which now floues ex tempore, as it was first written: but my leasure would not permit, Feci nec quod potui nec quod volui. For the rest it went against my Genius, to prostitute my muse in English, my intent was to haue it exposed this more cótract in Latin, but I could not get it printed. Any scurrile pamphlet is welcome to our mercenary Printers in English, but in Latin they will not meddle with it, which is one of the reasons that

and Soule, and such a one as hath as much need of a Spirituall as a corporall cure, I could not find a fitter taske to busie my selfe about, a more apposite Theame, so necessary, so commodious, and generally concerning all sorts of men, that should so equally participate of both, and require a whole Physitian. A Diuine in this compound mixt malady can do little alone, a Physitian in some kinds of Melancholy much lesse, both make an absolute cure. s

I had Iupiter in my sixt house, &c. In the Theoricke of Physicke I haue taken some paines, not with an intent to practise, but to satisfie my selfe, which was a cause likewise of the first vndertaking of this Subiecte.
            If these reasons doe not satisfie thee good Reader, as Alexander Munisicus that bountifull Prelate, sometimes Bishop of Lincolne, when he had built sixe Castles, ad inuidiam operis eluendam saith Mr. In Newarke in Nottinggamshire. Cum duo edificasset castella ad tollendam structionis inuidiam & expiandam maculam duo instistituit caenobia & collegis religiosu impleuit.

If this my Discourse be too medicinall, or sauour too much of humanity, I promise thee that I will hereafter make thee amends in some Diuine Treatise. But this I hope shall suffice when you haue more fully considered of the Reasons following, which were my chiefe Motiues. The generalitie of the Disease, the necessitie of the cure, & the cōmoditie or common good, that will arise to all men by the knowledge of it, as shall at large appeare in the ensuing Preface. And I doubt not but that in the end you will say with me, that to Anatomise this humour aright, through all the members of this our Microcosinus, is as great a taske, as to find out the Quadrature of a Circle, or all the Creekes and sounds of the North-East or North-West passage,

               Gregorie Tholosanus defines it, a dissolution or perturbation of the bodily league, which health combines: and who is not sicke or ill disposed, in whom doth not passion, anger, enuy, discontent, feare and sorrow raigne? who labours not of this disease; giue me but a little leaue, and you shall see by what testimonies, confessions, arguments I will euince it, that most men are mad: that they had as much need to goe a Pilgrimage to the Anticyrae, (as in

            That men are so misaffected, Melancholy, mad, heare the testimony of Solomon, Ecces. 2.1 2. And I turned to behold wisedome, madnesse and folly, &c. And vers. 23. All his dayes are sorrow, and his trauell griefe, and his heart taketh no rest in the night. So that take Melancholy in what sence you will, properly or improperly, in disposition or habite, for pleasure or for paine, dotage, discontent, feare, sorrow, madnesse, for part or for all, truely or metaphorically, 'tis all one. The hearts of the sonnes of men are euill, and madnesse is in their hearts while they liue, Eccles. 9.3. Wisemen themselues are no better, Eccles. 1.18. in the multitue of wisedome is much griefe, and he that increaseth wisedome, increaseth sorrow, cap. 2.17. he hated life it selfe, nothing pleased him, he hated his labour, all as 
                  Eccles. 1. 14. he concludes, is sorrow, griefe, vanitie, vexation of spirit. And though hee were the wisest man in the

world, sanctuarium sapientiae, and had wisedome in abundance, he will not vindicate himselfe, or iustifie his owne actions, Surely I am more foolish then any man, and haue not the vnderstanding of a man in me, Prou. 30.2. Bee they Solomons words, or the words of Agur, the sonne of Iakeh, they are Canonicall, Dauid a man after Gods own heart, confesseth as much of himselfe, Psal. 73.21. & 22. so foolish was I and ignorant, I was euen as a beast before thee, and condemnes all for fooles, Psal. 93. & 32.9. and 49.20. he compares them to beasts, horses and mules in which there is no vnderstanding.

               Theodoret in his Tract De cur. grec. affec. doth manifestly euince as much of Socrates, held wisest of the rest, that of all others he was most sottish, a very madman in his actions and opinions. If you desire to heare more of Apollonius that great wiseman, sometime paralelled by Iulian the Apostate to Christ, I referre you to that learned Tract of Eusebius against Hierocles, and for them all to Lucians Piscator, Icaromenippus, Neciomantia their actions, opinions ingeneral were so prodigious, absurd, ridiculous, which they broched and maintained, as he said. Nescio an Anticyram ratio illis destinet omnem. I thinke all the Anticyrae will not restore them to their wits,

            Yea, but will you inferre, that is true of Heathens, if they be conferred with Christians, 1. Cor. 3.19. the wisedome of this world is foolishnesse with God, earthly and diuelish as Iames calls it, 3.15. they were vaine in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was full of darkenesse. Ro. 1.21. & 22. ver. when they professed themselues wise became fooles. In some sence, Christiani Crassiani, Christians are Crassians, and if compared to that wisedome no better then fooles.

               ous meditation of mens actions fell a weeping, and with continuall teares bewailed their miseries, madnesse, and folly. Democritus on the other side fel a laughing, their whole life to him seem'd so ridiculous, and hee was so far caried with this Ironicall passion, that the cittizens of Abdera tooke him to be mad, and sent therefore Embassadours to Hippocrates the Physitian, that hee would exercise his skill vpon him. But the story is set down at large by Hippocrates himselfe, in his Epistle to Damogetus, which because it is not impertinent to this Discourse, I will insert verbatim almost, as it is deliuered by Hippocrates himselfe, with all the circumstances belonging vnto it,
            When Hippocrates was now come to Abdera, the people of the citty came all flocking about him, some weeping, some entreating of him, that he would doe his best. After some little repast, he went to see Democritus, all the people following him, whom he found (as before) in his garden in the suburbs all alone, 
                  Subramosae platano sedentem. Solum, discalceatum, super lapidem, valde pallidum ac macilentum promissâ barbâ, librum super genibus habentem.
                
               sitting vpon a stone vnder a plane tree, without hose or shooes, with a booke on his knees, cutting vp seueral beasts and busie at his study. The people stood gazing round about to see the congresse, Hippocrates after a little pause, saluted him by his name, whom he resaluted, ashamed almost that he could not call him likewise by his name, or that hee had forgot it. Hippocrates demanded of him what he was doing? He told him that he was

               busie in cutting vp seuerall beasts, to finde out the causes of madnesse, and melancholy. Hippocrates commended his worke, admiring his happinesse and leasure. And why, quoth Democritus, haue not you that leasure? Because, replied Hippocrates, domesticall affaires hinder me necessary to be done, for our childrē, expences, diseases, frailties and mortalities which happen, wife, children, seruants, and

such businesse which depriue vs of our time. At this speech Democritus profusely laughed (his friends and the people standing by weeping in the meane time and lamenting his madnesse) Hippocrates asking the reason why he laughed: he told him at the vanities and fopperies of the time. To see men so empty of all vertuous actions, to hunt so farre after gold, hauing no end of ambition, to take such infinite paines for a little glory, and to be fauored of men, to make such deepe mines into the earth for gold, & many times to find nothing, with losse of their liues and fortunes. Some to loue dogges, others horses, some to desire to be obeyed in many prouinces 
                  Austin lib. 1. in Genes. Iumenti & seruitui obsequium rigide postulas, et tu nullum praestas alijs nec ipsi deo.
                and yet themselues will knowe no obedience. 
                  Vxores dutunt mox foras eijciunt.
                Some to loue their wiues dearely at first, and after a while to forsake and hate them, begetting children, with much care and cost for their education, yet when they growe to mans estate, 
                  Pueros amant mox fastidiunt
                to despise them, neglect and leaue them naked to the worlds mercy. 
                  Quid hoc ab insania deest.
                Doe not these behauiours expresse their intolerable folly? When men liue in peace they couet warre, detesting quietnesse, 
                  Reges elegunt, deponunt.
                deposing kings and aduancing others in their stead, murdering some men to beget children of their wiues. How many strange humours are in men? When they are poore and needy they seeke riches, and when they haue them they doe not inioy them, but hide them vnder ground, or else wastfully spend them. O wise Hippocrates, I laugh at such things being done, but much more when no good comes of them, and when they are done to so ill purpose. There is no truth or iustice found amongst them, for they daily plead one against another, 
                  Contra parentes, fratres ciues perpetuo rixantur, & inimicitias agunt.
                the sonne against the father and the mother, brother against brother, kindred and friends of the same quality, and all this for riches, whereof after death they cannot be possessors. And yet notwithstanding they will defame & kill one another, commit all vnlawfull actions, contemning God and men, friends and country. They make great account of many senselesse things, esteeming them as a great part of their treasure, statues, pictures, and such like moueables, deare bought, and so cunningly wrought, as nothing but speech

wanteth in them, 
                  Idola inanita amant animata odio habent sic pontificij.
                and yet they hate liuing persons speaking to them. Others affect difficult things, if they dwell on firme land, they will remoue to an Iland, and thence to land againe, being no way constant in their desires. 
                  Credo equidem viuos ducent è marmore vultus
                They commend courage and strength in warres, and let themselues be conquered by lust and auarice, they are, in briefe, as disordered in their minds, as Thersites was in his body. And now mee thinkes O most worthy Hippocrates, you should not reprehend my laughing, perceauing so many fooleries in men: 
                  Suam stultitiam perspicit nemo sed alter alterum dexidet.
                for no man will mocke his owne folly, but that which hee seeth in another, and so they iustly mocke one another. The drunckard calls him a glutton, whom he knowes to be sober, many men loue the Sea, others husbandry, briefly they cannot agree in their owne trades and professions, much lesse in their liues & actions.
            When Hippocrates heard these words, so readily vttered without premeditation to declare the worlds vanity, full of ridiculous contrariety, hee made answer that necessity compelled men to many such actions, and diuerse wills ensuing from diuine permission, that we might not be idle, being nothing is so odious to them as sloth and negligence. Besides men cannot foresee future euents, in this vncertainty of humane affaires, they would not so marry, if they could foresee the causes of their dislike and separation, or parents if they knew the houre of their childs death, so tenderly prouide for them: or an husbandman sowe, if he thought there would be no increase; or a marchant aduenture to sea, if hee foresawe shipwracke; or be a magistrate, if presently to bee deposed. Alas, worthy Democritus, euery man hopes the best, and to that end he doth it, and therefore no such cause of laughter.
            
               Democritus hearing this excuse, laughed againe alowd, perceauing he did not well vnderstand what he had said concerning perturbations and tranquillity of the minde. Insomuch, that if men would gouerne their actions by discretion & prouidence, they would not declare themselues fooles, as now they doe, and he should haue no such cause of laughter,

but, quoth he, they swel in this life as if they were immortall, for want of vnderstanding. It were enough to make thē wise, if they would but consider the e mutability of this world, and how it wheeles about, nothing firme and sure, he that is now aboue, to morrow is beneath, he that sate on this side to day, to morrow is hurled on the other: and not considering these things they fall into many inconueniences and troubles, coueting thinges of no profit, and thirsting after them, tumbling headlong into many calamities. So that if men would attempt no more then what they can beare, they should lead contented liues, & learning to know themselues would limit their ambition,

I need not much labour to prooue this which I say otherwise then thus, or make any solemne protestation, of sweare, I thinke you will beleeue me without an oath, say at a word, are they fooles? I referre it to you (though you be likewise fooles your selues.) Il'e stand

to your censure, what thinke you?
            But for as much as I vndertooke at first, that Kingdomes, Prouinces, Families, were Melancholy as well as men, I will examine them in particular, and that which I haue hitherto dilated ar randome, and in more generall termes, I will now particularly insist in, and proue with more speciall and euident Arguments, Testimonies, Illustrations, & that in briefe. 
                  Hor. lib. 2. Sat. 2. 
               Nunc accipe quare desipiant omnes aequè ac tu. My first Argument is borrowed from Solomon, an arrowe drawne out of his Sententious quiner, Prou. 3.7. Be not wise in thine owne eyes, and 26.12. Seest thou a man wife in his owne conceite; more hope is of a foole then of him. 
               
                  Superbam stultitiam Pliny calles it. 7. epist. 21. quod semel dixi fixum ratū que sit.
                
               Isay pronounceth a woe against such men, cap. 5.21. That are wise in their owne eyes, and prudent in their owne sight. For hence we may gather that it is a great offence, and men are much deceiued that thinke too well to themselues, and an especiall Argument to conuince them to folly. Many men saith 
                  multi sapientes proculdubio fuissent, si se iam non putassent ad sapientiae summum peruenisse.
                
               Seneca, had beene without question wise, had they not had an opinion before hand, that they had attained to perfection of knowledge already, before they had gone halfeway. They had too good a conceit of themselues, and that marred all; of their Worth, Art, Learning, Iudgement, Eloquence, their good parts, all their Geese are Swannes, and that manifestly prooues them to be no better then fooles. In former times they had but seuen wise men, and now you can scarce finde so many fooles, nostra vti
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   regio saith 
                  Tam praesentibus plena est numinibus vt facilius possis deum quam hominem inuenire.
                
               Petronius, Our time is so full of deified spirits, diuine soules, that you may sooner find a God then a man amongst vs, we thinke so well of our selues, and that is an ample testimony of much folly.
            My second Argument is grounded vpon the like place of Scripture, which though before mentioned in effect, now againe for some reasons is to be repeated. Fooles saith Dauid by reason of their transgressions, &c. Psal. 107.17. Hence Museulus inferres all trangressours must needs be fooles. So we read Rom. 2. Tribulation and anguish is on the solue of euery man that doth euill, but all doe euill. And Isay 65.14.

               shall crie for sorrow of heart, and vexation of mind. 'Tis ratified by the common consent of all Philosophers. Dishonesty saith Cardan is nothing else but folly and madnesse,

                to the same end. If none honest, none wise, all fooles. And well may they be so accounted, for who will say that he is a wiseman (saith Musculus) that preferres m

                  mentary pleasures to eternitie, that spends his masters goods in his absence, forthwith to be condemned for it? Who will say that a sicke man is wise, that eates and drinkes to ouerthrow the temperance of his body? can you account him wise or discreet, that would willingly haue his health, and yet wil do nothing that should procure or continue it? 
                  per quam ridiculū est homines ex animi sententia viuere & quae Diis ingrata sunt exequi, & tamen a solis Diis velle saluos fieri, quum propriae salutis curam abiecerint. Theodoret ca. 6. de prouid. lib. de curat. grec. affec.

                  Lib. de sap. vbi timor adest sapientia adesse nequit.
                
               Lactantius stiffely mainetaines, wisedome cannot dwell. Seneca and the rest of the Stoikes are of opinion that where is any the least perturbation, wisedome cannot bee found. What more ridiculous as

               Lactantius vrgeth, then to heare how Xerxes whipped the Hellespont, threatned the mountaine Athos, and the like. To speake ad rem, who is

free from passion? Ecclus. 21.12. Where is bitternesse, there is no vnderstanding. Prou. 12.16. an angry man is a foole. 
               Mortalis nemo est quem non attingit dolor, morbusue, as 3. Tusc. Ininria in sapientim non cadit.
                
               Tully determines out of an old Poeme, no mortall man can auoide sorrow and sickenesse, and sorrow is an vnseparable companion of Melancholy. 
                  In hom. 6. in 2. epist. ad Cor. cap. 3. hominem te agnoscere nequeo cum tanquam asinus recal

               Chrysostome pleades farther yet, that they are more then madde, very beasts stupified and voide of common sence: For how saith he shall I know thee to be a man, when thou kickest like an asse, neyghest like an Horse after women, rauest in lust like a Bull, rauenst like a Beare, stingest like a Scorpion, rakest like a Wolfe. as suttle as a Foxe, as impudent as a Dogge; shall I say thou art man that hast all the Symptomes of a beast? how shall I know thee to be a man by thy shape? that affrights memore, when I see a beast in likenesse of a man.
            
            
               Beroaldus will haue drunkards; and such as more then ordinarily delight in drinke to be madde. The first pot quencheth thirst, the second makes them merry, the third for pleasure, quarta ad insaniam, the fourth makes them madde. If this position be true, what a Catalogue of madmen shall we haue? what shall they be that drinks foure times foure? Nonne supra omnem furorem, supra omnem insaniam reddent insatissimos? I am of his opinion, they are more then mad. worse then mad.

                  Epist. Demageto.
                
               Abderites condemned Democritus for a madman, because he was sometimes sad, and sometimes againe profusely merry. Hâc patriâ saith Hippocrates, ob risum furere & insanire dicunt, his countrey men hold him mad, 
                  Declamat.
                because he laughes, 
                  Amicis nostris Rhodi dicito, ne nimium rideant aut nimium tristes sunt
                and therefore hee desires him to aduise all his friends at Rhodes that they doe not laugh ouer much, or be ouer sad; Had those Abderites beene conuersant with vs, and had but seene what

As in humane bodies saith hee, there be diuers alterations proceeding from humours, so there be many diseases in a Common-wealth, which doe as diuersly happen from seuerall distempers, as you may easily perceiue by their seuerall Symptomes. For where, you shall see the people ciuill, obedient to God and Princes, iudicious, peaceable and quiet, rich, fortunate,

                and florish, to liue in peace, in vnitie and concord, a country well tilled, many faire built and populous Citties, vbi incolae nitent, as old 
                  Lib. de reru.
                
               Cato said, the people are neat, polite and terse, that Country is free from Melancholy: As it was in Italie in the time of Augustus, now in China, now in many other florishing Kingdomes of Europe. But whereas you shall see pouertie, barbarisme, beggery, plagues, warres, rebellions, seditions, mutinies, contentions, Idlenesse, Riot, Epicurisme, the land lie vntilled, waste, full of bogges, fennes, desarts, &c. Citties decayed, villages depopulated, and the people squalid, vglye, vnciuel, that kingdome, that countrye must needes bee discontent

and Melancholie, hath a sicke body and had neede to be reformed. Now that cannot well be effected, till the causes of these maladies be first remoued, which commonly proceede from their owne default, or some accidentall inconuenience: as to be site in a bad clime, too farre North, sterill, barren place, as the deserts of Lybia, desarts of Arabia, places voide of waters, as those of Lop and Belgian in Asia, or in a bad aire, as at Alexandreta, Bantan, Pisa, &c. or in danger of the Seas continuall inundations, as in many places of the Low-Countries, and else where, or neere some bad neighbours, as Hungarians to Turkes, Polonians to Tartars, or almost any bordering Countries, they liue in feare still, and by reason of hostile incursions are often times left desolate. So are Citties by reason

                of warres, fires, plagues, invndations, wild beasts, decay of trades, barred hauens, the Seas violence, as Antwerpe may witnesse of late, Syracuse of old, Brundusium in Italy, Douer with vs,
                  Interdum à feris vt olim Mauritana &c
                and many that at this day suspect the Seas furie and rage, and labour against it as the Venetians to their inestimable charge. But the most frequent maladies are such as proceed from themselues; as first when Religion and Gods Seruice is neglected, they doe not feare God, obey their Prince, where Atheisme, Epicurisme, Sacriledge, Simonie, &c. and all such impieties are freely committed, that Country cannot prosper. When Abraham came to Geraris, and saw a bad land, he said sure the feare of God was not in that place.

That the state was like a sicke body which had lately taken Phisicke, whose humours are not yet well setled and weakened so much by purging, that nothing was left but Melancholy.

But now many skinnes of Parchment will scarce serue turne, he that buyes and selles a house, must haue a house full of writings, there be so many circumstances, so many words, such Tautologicall repetitions of all particulars (to auoid cauillation they say) but we find by our wofull experience, that to subtle wits it is a cause of much more contention and variance, and scarce any Conueiance so accurately penned by one, which another will not find a crack in, or cauell at, if any one word be misplaced, any little error, all is disanulled. That which is law to day is none tomorrow, that which is found in one mans opinion, is most faulty to another; that in conclusion, heare is nothing amongst vs but contention & confusion, new stirs euery day. mistakes, errors, cauills, and at this present, as I haue heard in some one court I know not how many 1000 causes: no person free, no title almost good, with such bitternesse in following, so many flights, procrastrinations, delayes, forgery, such cost, violēce & malice, I know not by whose fault, Lawyers, Clients, laws, both or all: but as Paul reprehended the 1.

because their policy hath beene otherwise, and we are not so thrifty, circumspect, industrious; idlenesse is the malus Genius of our nation. For as

Many kingdomes are fertile, but thin of inhabitants, as that Dutchy of Pedemont in Italy, which Leander Albertus so much magnifies, for Corne, Wine, Fruits, &c. yet nothing neere so populous as those which are more barren.

               England saith he,(London only excepted) hath neuer a populous citty, & yet a fruitfull country. The lowe Countries haue three citties at least for one of ours, and those farre more populous and rich, and what is the cause but their industry and excellency in all manner of trades? Their commerce which is maintained by a multitude of tradesmen, so many excellent Chanels made by art, & opportune hauens, to which they build their citties: All which we haue in like measure, or at least may haue. But their chiefest lodestone, which drawes all manner of commerce and marchandize, which maintaines their present estate, is not fertility of soyle, but industry that enricheth them, the gold mines of Peru, or Noua Hispania may not compare with them. They haue neither gold nor siluer of their owne, wine nor oyle, or scarce any corne growing in those vnited Prouinces, little or no wood, Tinne, Lead, Iron, Silke, Wooll, or any stuffe almost, or any mettle: & yet Hungary, Transiluania, that bragge of their Mines, fertile England cannot compare with them. I dare boldly say that neither France nor Italy, Velence in Spaine, or that pleasant Andalusia with their excellent fruits, wine and oyle, two haruests, no nor any part of Europe is so florishing, so rich, so populous, so full of good ships, of well built citties, so abounding with all things necessary for the vse of man. 'Tis our Indies an Epitome of China, and all by reason of their industry and commerce. Industry is a lodestone to drawe all good things, that alone makes countries florish, citties populous, 
                  Populi multitudo diligenti cultura saecundat solum. Boterus lib. 8. cap. 3. & will enforce by reason of much manure, which necessarily follows a barren soyle to bee fertile, and good. Tell mee Polititian

why is that fruitfull Palaestina, noble Greece, Aegypt, Asia Minor so much decayed, and falne from that they were? The ground is the same, but the gouernment is altered, the people are growne slothful, idle, their good husbandry and industry is decayed. May a man beleeue that which Aristotle in his Politicks, Puusanias, Stephanus relates of old Greece? where are those 400 citties of Aegypt, those 100 citties in Creet? are they now come to two? What saith Pliny of old Italy? Bosius and Machiauell, both proue them now nothing neere so populous, and full of citties as of old. Many will not beleeue but that our Iland of great Brittaine is now more populous then euer it was: but let them read Beda, Leland, and others, and it most florished in the Saxon Heptarchy, and in the Conquerers time was farre better inhabited, then at this present. See that Domesday booke, and shewe mee now those thousands of parishes, which are now decayed, citties ruined, villages depopulated, &c. The lesser the Territory is, commonly the richer it is, Paruus sed benè cultus ager. As those Imperiall citties and free States of Germany may witnesse, Suitsers, Rheti, Wallownes, Tuscany, Pedemont, Mantua, Venice in Italy, Raguse, &c. That Prince therefore, as 
                  Polit. lib. 3. c. 8 
               Boterus aduiseth, that will haue a rich country, and faire citties, let him get good trades, priuiledges, and painefull inhabitants, artificers, and suffer no rude matter vnwrought, as Tinne, Iron, wooll, Lead, &c. To bee transported out of his country. For dying of cloaths, and dressing, &c. A thing in part seriously attempted amongst vs, but not effected. And because industry of men, and multitude of trades so much auailes to the ornament and enriching of a kingdome, Selym the first Turkish Emperour, procured a thousand of good artificers to bee brought from Tauris to Constantinople. The Polanders indented with Henry Duke of Aniou their new chosen King, to bring with him an hundred families of artificers into Poland. Edward the third, our most renowned king, to his eternall memory, brought cloathing first into this Iland, transposing some families of Artificers from Gaunt hither. How many goodly citties could I reckon

vp, that liue wholy by trade, where thousands of inhabitants liue singular well by their fingers ends; as Florence in Italy, by making cloath of gold; great Millan by silke and all curious works; many citties in Spaine, many in France, Germany haue none other maintenance, especially those within the Land. Noremberge in Germany sited in a most barren soyle, yet a noble imperiall citty, by the sole industry of Artificers; and so is Basil, Spire, Cambray, Francfurt, &c. It is almost incredible to relate what

What Carolus Magnus, the Chinese, the Spaniards, Duke of Saxony, and many other states haue decreed in this case, read Arniseus cap. 19. Boterus lib. 8. cap. 2. Osorius de rebus gest. Eman. lib. 11. When a country is ouerstored with people, as a pasture is oft ouerlaid with cattle, they had wont in former times to disburden themselues by sending out Colonies, or by wars, as those old

               Romanes, or by imploying them at home about some, publike buildings, as bridges, rode waies, for which those Romans were famous in this Iland: As Augustus Caesar did in Rome, the Spaniards in their Indian Mines: See Lipsius Admiranda.
                Aqueducts, bridges, those stupend workes of Trainn, Claudius, those Appian and Flaminian waies may witnesse, and rather then they should be idle, as those

Massinissa made many inward parts of Barbary and Numidia in Africke, before his time inculte and horrid, fruitfull and battable by this meanes. Great industry is generally vsed all ouer those Easterne coū

In France a great benefit is raised by salt, &c. Whether these things might not be as happily attempted with vs, and with like successe it may be controuerted. Silkwormes, Vines, Firtrees, &c. Cardan exhorts Edward the 6. to plant Oliues, and is fully perswaded they would prosper in this Iland. With vs nauigable riuers are most part neglected, our riuers are not great I confesse, by reason of the narrownesse of the Iland, yet they runne smoothly and euen, and might as well be repaired many of them (I meane Wie, Trent, Ouse, Thamisis at Oxford (the defect of which we feele in the meane time) as the riuer of Lee from Ware to London.

We contemne this benefit of carriage by waters, & are therefore compelled in the inner parts of this Iland, because carriage is so deare, to eat vp our commodities, our selues, and liue like so many Boares in a stye, for want of vent and vtterance. We haue many excellent hauens, royall hauens, Falmouth, Porchmouth, Milford, &c. which haue few ships in them, little or no trafficke or trade, which haue scarse a Village on them, able to beare great citties, sed viderint politici. I could here iustly taxe many other neglects, abuses, errours, defects amongst vs & in other countries, depopulatiōs riot, drunkennesse, &c. and many such, quae nunc in aurem susurrare non libet, but I must take heed, ne quid grauius dicam that I doe not ouershoot my selfe.

We haue good lawes, I deny not, to rectifie such enormities, and so in all other countries, but it seemes to small purpose many times. Wee had need of some generall visiter in our age, that should reforme what is amisse: another Attila Tamberlin, Hercules to striue with Achelous, Augeaestabulum purgare, to subdue tyrants, as

                he did Diomedes and Busiris: to expell theeues as he did Cacus and Lacinius; to vendicate poore captiues, as hee did Hesione: to passe the torrid zone, and the desarts of Lybia, and purge the world of monsters and Centaures. Or another Theban Crates to reforme our manners, to compose quarrells, end controuersies, as in his time he did, & was therefore adored for a God in Athens.

He might reduce those wandring Tartars into order that infest China on the one side, Muscouy, Poland on the other; and tame those vagabond Arabians that robbe and spoile all those Easterne countries, that they should neuer vse more Carauans or Ianisaries to conduct them.

            From Commonwealths and citties, I will descend to families, which haue as many coarsiues & molestations, as frequent discontents as the rest. Great affinity there is betwixt a Politicall and Oeconomicall body, as they haue both likely the same period, as 
                  Lib. 4. de rep. cap 2. 
               Bodin holds, offiue or six hundred yeares so many times they haue the same meanes of their vexation and ouerthrowes, as namely riot, a common ruine of both, riot in building, riot in profuse spending, riot in apparell, &c. be it what kinde soeuer, it produceth the same effects. 
                  Camden in Cheshiere.
                A Chorographer of ours speaking obiter of ancient families, why they are so frequent in the North, continue so long, and are so soone extinguished in the South, and so few; giues no other reason but this, luxus omniae dissipauit, riot hath consumed all. Fine cloaths and curious buildings came into this Island, as he notes in his annalls, not so many yeares since, non sine dispendio hospitalitatis, to the decay of hospitality. Howbeit many times that word is mistaken, and vnder the name of Bounty and Hospitality; is shrowded Riot, & prodigality, and that which is commendable in it selfe well vsed, is now become by his abuse the bane and vtter ruine of many a noble family. For many a man liues like the rich glutton, consuming himselfe and his substance by continuall feasting & inuitations, like

                It is a wonder, what Paulus Iouius relates of our northerne countries, what an infinite deale of meat we consume on our tables; that I may truely say tis not bounty, not hospitality, as it is often abused, but riot in excesse and prodigality, it brings in debt, want and beggery, hereditary diseases, consumes their fortunes, and ouerthrowes the good temperature of their bodies. To this I might here well adde their inordinate expence in building, those phantasticall houses, turrets, walks, parkes, &c. gaming, excesse of pleasure, & that prodigious riot in apparell, by which meanes they are compelled to giue vp house, and creep into holes.

A good honest painefull man many times hath a shrew to his wife, a sickly, dishonest, a slothfull, foolish, carelesse woman to his wife, a prowd peeuish flurt, a liquorish prodigall Queane, and by that meanes all goes to ruine: or if they differ in nature, he is thrifty, she spends all, he wise, she sottish & soft, what agreement can there be, what friendship?

Often times too, to aggrauate the rest concurre many other inconueniences, vnthankfull friends, bad neighbours, negligent seruants, casualties, taxes, mulcts, losse of stocke, enmities, emulations, losses, suretiship, sicknesse, death of friends, and that which is the gulfe of all, improuidence, ill husbandry, disorder and confusion, by which meanes they are drenched on a sudden in their estates, and at vnawares precipitated insensibly, into an inextricable labyrinth of ca

            I haue done with families, and will now briefly run ouer some few sorts and conditions of men. The most secure, happy, Iouiall and merry in the worlds esteeme, are Princes and great men, free from melancholy, but for their cares, miseries suspitions, Iealosies and discontents. I referre you to Xenophous Tyrannus, where king Hieron discourseth at large with Simonides the Poet, of this subiect. Of all others they are most troubled with perpetuall feares, anxieties, insomuch, that as he said in 
                  Lib. 7. cap. 6. 
               Valerius, if thou knewest with what cares and miseries this robe were stuffed, thou wouldest not stoope to take it vp. Or put case they be secure and free frō feares and discontents, yet they are void

At this present I haue no more to say, His sanā mentē Democritus, I can but wish my selfe, and them a good Physitian, and all of vs a better mind.

Being then as it is a disease so grieuous, so common, I know not how to do a more generall seruice, and spend my time better, then to prescribe meanes how to preuent and cure so vniuersall a malady, and Epidemicall disease, that so often, so much crucifies the body and mind.

               Vacuna, and set turning an apple with a pot of ale and a toste by their Vacunall fires, I writt this and published this. The time, place, persons, and all circumstances apologize for me, & why may I not then be idle with others? speake my mind freely, If you denie me this liberty, vpon these presumptions I will take it: I say againe, I will take it.
            No, I recant, I will not, I confesse my fault and acknowledge a great offence, I haue ouershot my selfe, I haue spoken foolishly, rashly, vnaduisedly, absurdly, I haue anatomized mine owne folly. And now me thinkes vpon a sudden I am awaked as it were out of a dreame, I haue had a rauing fit, and ranged vp and downe, in and out, I haue insulted ouer most kind of men, abused some, and offended others, wronged my selfe, and now being recouered, and perceiuing mine error, crie with

Hierom. Cardane ne quid mali de me suspiceris. I beseech him in his words, that he would not mistake me, or thinke amisse. And if hereafter in Anatomising this sirlie humour, my hand slip, and as an vnskilfuil prentise, I launce too deepe, and cut through skinne and all at vnawares; or make it smart, or cut awry,

                pardon a rude hand, an vnskilfull knife, 'tis a most difficult thing to keepe an euen hand, a perpetuall tenor, and not sometimes to lash out; difficile est Satyram non scribere, there be so many obiects to diuert, inward perturbations to molest, and the very best may sometimes erre, aliquando bonus dormitat Homerus; it is impossible not in so much to ouershoot: opere in longo fas est obrepere somnum. But what needes all this? I hope there will no such cause of offence be giuen; if there be, I presume of thy good fauour and gratious acceptance, and out of an assured hope and confidence thereof, I will begin.

                        The fathers haue eaten sower grapes, & the childrens teeth are set on edge. They cause our griefe many times, and put vpon vs haereditary diseases, ineuitable infirmities: They torment vs, and wee are as ready to iniure our posteritie.—

                        Paule foretold, is still like to bee worst. We are thus bad by nature, bad by kinde, but farr worse by art, every man the greatest enemy vnto himselfe. We study many times to vndoe our selues, abusing those good gifts which God hath bestowed vpon vs, Health, Wealth, Strength, Wit, Learning, Art, Memory, to our owne destruction, Ezech. 18.31.

                        Iudas Machabeus killed Apollonius friends with his owne weapons, we arme our selues to our owne ouerthrowes, and vse Reason, Art, Iudgment, all that should helpe vs, as so many instruments to vndoe vs. As S. Austin confesseth of himselfe in his humble Confessions, promptnesse of Wit, Memory, Eloquence, they were Gods good gifts, but he did not vse them to his glory. If you will particularly know how, and by what meanes, consult Physitians, and they will tell you, that it is in offending in some of those six non-naturall things, of which I shall after Part 1. Sec. 2 Memb. 2. dilate more large; they are the causes of our infirmities, our surseting & drunkennes, our immoderate insatiable lust, & prodigious riot. Plures crapula, quam gladius, it is a true saying, the borde consumes more then the sword. Our intemperance it is, that pulls so many severall incurable diseases vpon our heads, that hastens 
                           Nequitia est que te non sinet esse senem.
                         olde age, perverts our temperature, and brings vpon vs sudden death. And last of all, that wuich crucifies vs most, is our owne folly, want of government, our facilitie and pronenesse in yeelding to our several lust, and giving way to euery passion and perturbation of the minde, by

which meanes we metamorphize our selues, and degenerate into beasts. As that

                        Pliny reckons vp 300. from the Crowne of the Head, to the sole of the Foote: elswhere he saith, morborum infinita multitudo, their number is infinite. Howsoeuer it was

in those olde times, it bootes not; in our dayes I am sure the number is much augmented: for besides many Epidemicall diseases vnheard of, and altogether vnknowne to Galen and Hippocrates, as Scorbutum, Small pox, Plica, Sweating Sicknesse, Morbus Gallicus &c. we haue many proper, and peculiar almost to euery part. No man amongst vs so sound, of so good a constitution, that hath not some impediment of Body or Minde. No man free from some Disease or other.

For those of the Body, a briefe Catalogue of which Fuschius hath made, Institut. lib. 3. sec. 1. cap. 11. I refer you to those voluminous Tomes of Galen, Areteus, Rhasis, Avicenna, Alexander, Paulus, Aetius, Gordonius, Guianerius: And those exact Neotericks, Savanarola, Capiuaccius, Donatus Altomarus, Hercules de Saxonia, Mercurialis, Victorius Faventinus, Wecker, Piso, &c. that haue methodically, and elaborately written of them all.

                     SVBSEC. 3. Division of the Diseases of the Head.
                     THese Diseases of the Minde, forasmuch as they haue their chiefe seat, and Organs in the Head, are commonly repeated amongst the diseases of the Head, which are divers, and vary much according to their site. For in the Head, as there be divers parts, so there be divers grievances, which according to that division of

As Lonicerus hath done de Apoplexiâ, and many others, of many such particular diseases. Not that I finde fault with others which haue written of this subiect before, as Iason Pratensis, Laurentius, Montaltus, T: Bright, &c. they haue done well in their severall kindes and methods, yet that which one omits, another may happily see; that which one contracts, another may enlarge.

It differs from Melancholy and Madnesse, because their Dotage is without an ague: this continuall, with waking, or Memory decayed &c. Melancholy is most part silent; this clamorous, and many such like differences are assigned by Phisitians.

                        Areteus, Alexander Trallianus, Guianerius, Savanarola, Hernius, and Galen himselfe writes promiscuously of them both, by reason of their affinity, but most of our Neotericks doe handle them a-part, whom I will follow in this Treatise. Madnesse is therfore defined to be a vehement Dotage, or rauing without a feuer, farre more violent then Melancholy, full of anger, and clamor, horrible lookes, actions, gestures; and troubles the Patient with farre greater vehemency both of Body and Minde, without all feare and sorrow, with such impetuous force, and boldnesse, that sometimes three or foure men cannot hold them. Differing onely in this from Frensie, that it is without a Feuer, and their Memory is most part better.

                     BEfore I proceede to define the Disease of Melancholy what it is, or to discourse farther of it, I hold it not impertinent to make a briefe Digression of the Anatomy of the Body, and Faculties of the Soule, for the better vnderstanding of that which is to follow; because many hard wordes will often occurre, as Myrache, Hypocondries, Haemrods &c. Imagination, Reason, Humors, Spirits, Vitall, Naturall, Animall, Nerues, Veines, Arteries, which of the Vulgar will not be so easily perceiued, what they are, how sited, and to what end they serue. And besides, it may peradventure giue occasion to some men, to examine more accurately, and search farther into this most excellent Subiect, that haue time and leasure enough, and are sufficiently informed in all other worldly businesses; as to make a good bargain, buy, and sell, to keepe and make choyse of a good Hauke, Hound, Horse &c.

but for such matters as concerne the knowledge of themselues, they are wholly ignorant & carelesse, they know not what this Body and Soule are, how combined, of what parts and Faculties they consist, or how a man differs from a dog. And what can be more ignominous and filthy (as 
                           De Anima, Turpe enim est homini ignorare sui corporis vt ita dicam aedificium, praesertim cum ad valetudinem & mores, haec cognitio plurimum conducat.

                     SVBSEC. 2. Division of the Body. Humors, Spirits.
                     OF the parts of the Body, there be many Divisions: The most approued is that of 
                           Anat. l.1. c. 18. 
                        Laurentius, out of Hippocrates: That is, into parts Contained, or Containing. Contained; are either Humors, 
                        Humors. or Spirits.
                     
                     A Humor is a liquid or fluent part of the Body, comprehended in it, for the preservation of it, and it is either innate and borne with vs, or adventitious and acquisite. The Radicall or innate, is dayly supplied by nourishment, which some call Cambium, and make those secundary Humors of Ros and Gluters to maintaine it: or acquisite, to maintaine those

foure first primary Humors, comming and proceeding from the first Concoction in the Liuer, by which meanes Chilus is excluded. Some divide them into profitable and excrementitious Humors, Pituita and Blood profitable; the other two excrementitious. But

                        Crato out of Hippocrates will haue all foure to be juyce, and not excrements, without which no living Creature can be sustained: which foure, though they be comprehended all in the Masse of the Blood, yet they haue their severall affections, for which they are distinguished from one another, and from those adventitious peccant, or

                        diseased humors, as Melancton cals them.
                     
                        Blood, is a hote, sweete, temperate, red humor, Blood. prepared in the Miseriacke veines, and made of the most temperate parts of the Chilus in the liuer, whose office is to norrish the whole Body, to giue it strength and colour, being dispersed by the veines, through every part of it. And from it Spirits are first begotten in the Heart, which afterwards by the Arteries, are communicated to the others parts
                     
                        Pituita, or Fleame, is a cold and moist humor, Fleame. begotten of the colder part of the Chilus, (or white juyce comming of the meate digested in the Stomacke) in the Liver, his office is to nourish, and moisten the Members of the Body, which as the tongue, are mooved, that they be not over-drye.
                     
                        Choler, is hote and dry, bitter, Choler. begotten of the hotter parts of the Chilus, and gathered to the Gall: it helpes the naturall heate, and sences, and serues to the expelling of excrements.
                     
                        Melancholy, cold and dry, thicke, blacke, sowre, Melancholy begotten of the more faeculent part of nourishment, and purged from the Spleene, is a bridle to the other two hote Humors, Blood, and Choler, preseruing them in the Blood, and nourishing the Bones: These foure Humors haue some Analogy with the foure Elements, and to the foure Ages in Man.
                     To these Humors, you may adde Serum, 
                        
                           Serum, Sweats, Teares. which is the matter of Vrine, and those excrementitious Humors, of the third Concoction, Sweat, and Teares.
                     
                        Spirit, is a most subtile vapor, Spirits. which is expressed from the

                        Blood, and the Instrument of the Soule, to performe all his Actions, a common tye or medium, betwixt the Body and the Soule, as some will haue it, or as 
                           Spiritalis anima.
                         
                        Paracelsus, a fourth Soul of it selfe. Melancthon holds the Fountaine of these Spirits to be the Heart, begotten there, and afterward convayed to the Braine, they take an other nature to them. Of these Spirits there be three kindes, according to the three principall parts, Braine, Heart, Liver; Naturall, Vitall, Animall. The Naturall are begotten in the Liuer, and thence dispersed through the Veines, to performe those naturall actions. The Vitall Spirits are made in the Heart of the Naturall, which by the Arteries, are transported to all the other parts: if these Spirits cease, the Life ceaseth, as in a Syncope or Swouning. The Animall Spirits are formed of the Vitall, brought vp to the Braine, and diffused by the Nerues, to the other Members, giue sence and motion to them all.
                  
                  
                     SVBSEC. 3. Simular Parts.
                     COntaining Parts by reason of their more solid substance, Simular parts. are either Homogeniall, or Hetrogeniall, Simular, or Dissimular: so Aristotle divides them, lib. 1. cap. 1. de hist. Animal. Laurentius cap. 20. lib. 1. Simular or Homogeniall, are such, as if they be divided, are still divided into parts of the same nature, as water into water. Of these, some bee Spermaticall, some Fleshy, or Carnall. 
                           Laurentius cap. 20. lib. 1. Anat.
                         
                        Spermaticall are such as are immediatly begotten of the Seed, which are Bones, Grisles, Ligaments, Membranes, Nerues, Arteries, Veines, Skinnes, Fibers, or Strings, Fat.
                     
                     The Bones are dry and hard, Bones. begotten of the thickest of the Seede, to strengthen and sustaine the other parts: some say there be 304, some 307, or 313 in a Mans body. They haue no nerues in them, and are therefore without sence.
                     A Gristle, is a substance softer then Bones, and harder then

the rest, flexible, and serues to maintaine the parts of motion.
                     
                        Ligaments, are they that tye the Bones together, and other parts to the Bones, with their subseruing tendons: Membranes office is to couer the rest.
                     
                        Nerues or sinewes, are Membranes without, Nerues. and full of Marrow within, they proceede from the Braine, and carry the Animall Spirits for sence and motion. Of these some be harder, some softer; the softer serue the sences, and there be seuen paire of them. The first be the Opticke Nerues, by which wee see; the second moue the Eyes; the third paire serue for the Tongue for taste; the fourth paire for taste in the Palate; the fift serue the Eares; the sixt paire is most ample, and runnes almost ouer all the Bowels; the seuenth paire mooue the Tongue. The harder Sinewes serue for the motion of the Inner parts, proceeding from the Marrow in the Backe, of whom there be thirty Combinations, seuen of the Necke, twelue of the Brest, &c.
                     Arteries, are long & hollow, Arteries. with a double skin to convay the vitall spirits, to discerne which the better, they say that Vesalius the Anatomist was wont to cut vp men aliue. In these they obserue the beating of the Pulse. They arise in the left side of the heart, and are principally two, from which the rest are deriued, Aorta and Venosa. Aorta is the root of all the other, which serue the whole body; the other goes to the lungs, to fetch aire to refrigerate the Heart.
                     
                        Veines, are hollow and round like pipes, Veines. arising from the Liuer, carrying blood and naturall spirits, they feed all the parts. Of these there be two chiefe, Vena porta, and Vena Caua, from which the rest are corrivated. That Vena porta is a Veine, comming from the concaue of the liuer, and receauing all those meseriacall veines, by whom he takes the Chilus from their stomacke and guts, and conveies it to the Liuer. The other convaies blood from the liuer to nourish all the other dispersed members. The branches of that Vena porta, are the Meseriacall and Haemorroïdes. The branches of the Caua, are inward, or outward. Inward seminall or emulgent. Outward in the head, armes, feet, &c. and haue severall names.
                     
                        
                        Fibrae or strings, white and solide dispersed through the whole member, Fibrae, Fat, Flesh. and are right, oblique, transuerse, all which haue their severall vses. Fat, is a simular part moist without blood, composed of the most thicke and vnctuous matter of the blood. The

                        Laurentius is most famous, into Noble or Ignoble parts. Of the noble there bee three principall parts to which all the rest belong, and whom they serue, Braine, Hart, Liuer. According to whose site, three Regions, or a threefold division is made of the whole Body. As first of the Head in which the Animal Orgaines are contained, and Braine it selfe, which by his Nerues giues sense and motion to the rest, and is as it were a privy Counsellor, and Chancellour to the Heart. The second Region is the Chest, or middle Belly, in which the Heart as king keepes his court, and by his Arteries

communicates life to the whole body. The third Region is the lower Belly in which the liuer resides, as a legat à latere, with the rest of those naturall Organes, seruing for concoction, nourishment, expelling of excrements. This lower Region is distinguished from the vpper by the Midriffe, or Diaphragma, and is subdiuided againe by D. Crooke out of Gallen and others. some into three concauiti

From which is denominated Hypocondriacall Melancholy. The second of the Navell and Flancks, diuided from the first by the Rimme. The last of the watercourse, which is againe subdivided into three other parts. The Arabians make two parts of this Region, Epigastrium, and Hypogastrium. Vpper or lower. E

                           Vos vero veluti in templum ac sacrarium quoddam vos duci putetis, &c Suauis & vtilis cognitio. The lower Region Naturall Organs.

                        but the singular art and workmanship, & counsell of this our great Creator. And tis a pleasant and profitable speculation, if it be considered aright. The parts of this Region which present themselues to your consideration and view, are such as serue to nutrition or generation. Those of Nutrition serue to the first or second concoction. As the oesophagus or Gullet which brings meat and drinke into the Stomacke. The Ventricle or stomacke, which is seated in the midst of that part of the belly beneath the Midriffe, the kitchin as it were of the first concoction, and which turnes our meat into Chilus: It hath two mouthes, one aboue, another beneath. The vpper is sometimes taken for the stomacke it selfe; the lower or neather dore (as Wecker cals it) is named Pylorus. This stomacke is sustained by a large Kell or Ka
                           •
                        ll, called Omentum. Which some will haue the same which Paeritoneum, or rimme of the

belly. From the Stomacke to the very Fundament, are produced the Guts or Intestina, which serue a little to alter and distribute the Chilus, and conuay away the excrements. They are divided into small and great, by reason of their site and substance, slender or thicker. The slender is Duodenum or whole gutte, which is next to the stomacke, some twelue inches long, saith 
                           Lib. 1. cap. 12. Sect. 5.

                           iunum or empty gutt continuate to the other, which hath many Meseriacke Veines annexed to it, which take part of the Chilus to the liuer from it. Ilion the third, which consists of many crinckles, which serues with the rest to receaue, keepe, and distribute the Chilus from the Stomacke. The thicke guts are three, the Blind gut, Colon, and Right gut. The Blinde is a thicke and short gut, hauing one mouth in which the Ilion and Colon meet: It receaues the excrements, and convayes them to the Colon. This Colon hath many windings, that the excrements passe not away to fast. The Right gut is straight, and convayes the excraments to the Fundament, whose lower part is bound vp with certaine Musckles, called Sphincteres, that the excrements may be the better contained, vntill such time a man be willing to goe to the stoole. In the midst of these guts is situated the Mysenterium or Midriffe, composed of many Veines, Arteries, and much fat, seruing chiefly to sustaine the guts. All these parts serue the first concoction. To the second, which is busied either in refining the good nourishment, or expelling the bad, is chiefly belonging the Liuer, like in colour to congealed blood, the shop of blood, situate in the right Hypocondry, in figure like to an halfe moone, Generosum membrum, Melancton stiles it; a generous part, it serues to turne the Chilus to blood, for the nourishment of the body. The excrements of it are either Cholericke or Watery, Which the other subordinate parts convay. The Gaule placed in the concaue of the Liuer, extracts Choler to it, the Spleene. Melancholy, which is situate on the left side overagainst the Liuer, a spungy matter, which drawes this blacke choler to it by a secret vertue, and seeds vpon it, convaying the rest to the bottome of the stomacke, to

stirre vp appetite, or else to the guts as an excrement. That watery matter the two Kidnies expurgate, by those emulgent veines, and Vreteres: The emulgent drawe this superfluous moisture from the blood, the two Vreteres convay it to the Bladder; which by reason of his site in the lower belly, is apt to receaue it, hauing two parts, necke and bottome: the bottome holds the water, the necke is constringed with a muscle, which as a porter keepes the water from running out against our will.
                     Members of generation are common to both sexes, or peculiar to one; which because they are impertinent to my purpose, I doe voluntarily omit.
                     Next in order is the middle Region, 
                        Middle Region. or chest which comprehends the vitall faculties and parts: which as I haue said is seperated from the lower belly, by the Diaphragma or Midriffe, which is a skinne consisting of many nerues, membranes, and amongst other vses it hath, it is the instrument of laughing. There is also a certaine thinne membrane full of Sinewes, which covereth the whole chest within, and is called Pleura, the seat of the disease called Pleurisie, when it is inflamed; some adde a third skinne, which is called Mediastinus, which divides the chest into two parts, right and left. Of this Region the principall part is the Heart, which is the seat and fountaine of life, of heat, of spirits, of pulse and respiration, the Sonne of our body, the king and sole commander of it: The seat and organe of all passions and affections, Primum viuens vltimum moriens, it liues first and dies; last in all creatures. Of a paramidicall forme, and not much vnlike to a Pineapple, a part worthy of 
                           Haec res est praecipuè digna admiratione, quod tantâ affectuum varietate cietur cor, quod omnes restristes & laetae statim corda feriunt & mouent
                         admiration, that can yeeld such variety of affections, by whose motion he is dilated or contracted, to stirre and command the humours in the body. As in sorrow, melancholy; in anger, choler; in ioy to send the blood outwardly, in sorrowe to call it in; moouing the humours as Horses doe a Chariot. This Heart though it bee one sole member, yet it may bee divided into two creekes; Right and Left. The Right is like the Moone increasing, bigger

then the other part, and receaues blood from Vena Caua, distributing some of it to the Lunges to nourish them, the rest to the left side to ingender spirits. The left creeke hath the forme of a Cone, and is the seat of life: which as a torch doth oyle, drawes blood vnto it, begetting of it spirits and fire; and as fire is in a torch, so are spirits in the blood, & by that great Artery called Aorta, he sends vitall spirits all ouer the body, and takes ayre from the Lungs, by that Artery which is called Venosa; So that both creekes haue their vessels, the right two Veines, the left two Arteries, besides those two common aufractuous eares which serue them both, the one to hold blood, the other aire, for seuerall vses. The Lunges is a thinne spungy part like an Oxe huffe, saith 
                           Phisiol. l. 1. c. 8.

                         one tearmes it) the instrument of voice, as an Orator to a King annexed to the Heart, to expresse his thoughts by voice. That it is the instrument of voice, it is manifest, in that no creature can speake, or vtter any voice that wanteth these lights. It is besides the instrument of respiration, or breathing: and his chiefe office is to coole the Heart, by sending aire vnto it, by the Venosall Artery, which veine comes to the lungs by that aspera arteria, which consists of many grisles, membranes, nerues, taking in aire at the nose and mouth, and by it likewise exhales the fumes of the Heart.
                     
                     In the vpper Region seruing the animall faculties, vpper Region the chiefe Organ is the Braine, which is a soft marrowish and white substance, ingendred of the purest part of seed and spirits, included by many skinnes, and seated within the skull or braine-pan, and it is the most nobled Organe vnder Heaven, the dwelling house and seat of the soule, the habitation of wisdome, memory, iudgement, Reason, and in which man is most like vnto God, and therefore nature hath couered it with a skull of hard bone, and two skinnes or membranes, whereof the one is called dura mater or meninx, the other pia mater. The dura mater is next to the skull, aboue the other, and includes and protects the braine. When this is tataken

away the pia mater is to be seene, a thinne membrane, the next and immediate couer of the braine, and not couering only but entring into it. The Braine it selfe is divided into two parts, the fore and hinderpart; the fore-part is much bigger then the other, which is called the little braine in respect of it. This forepart hath many concavities, distinguished by certaine ventricles, which are the Receptacles of the Spirits, brought thither by the Arteries from the Heart, and are there refined to a more heauenly nature, to performe the actions of the Soule. Of these ventricles there be three, Right, Left, and Middle. The Right and Left answere to their site, & beget animall spirits; if these be any way hurt, sense & motion ceaseth. These ventricles moreouer, are held to be the seat of the common sense. The Middle ventricle, is a common concurse and cauity of both; and hath two passages, the one to receaue Pituita, the other extends it selfe to the fourth creeke, in this they place Imagination, and Cogitation, and so the three ventricles of the forepart of the Braine are vsed. The fourth Creeke behinde the head is common to the Cerebell or little braine, and marrowe of the back-bone, the least and most sollid of all the rest, which receaues the animal spirite from the other ventricles, and convaies them to the marrowe in the backe, and is the place where they say the memory is seated.

How these three principall faculties are distinguished and connected, Humano ingenio inaccessum videtur; is beyond humane capacity, as

As a Triangle in a Quadrangle.
                     
                        Vegetall, the first of the three distinct faculties, is defined to be a substantiall Act of an Organicall body, by which it is nourished, augmented, and begets another like vnto it selfe. In which definition three seuerall operations are specified, the first is 
                           Nutritio est alimenti transmutatio viro naturalis, Scal exerc. 101. Sec. 17. Attraction. Nutrition, whose obiect is nourishment, meat, drink, and the like, his Organ the Liuer in sensible creatures, in Plants the root or sap. His office is, to turne the nutrimēt into the substance of the body nourished, which he performes by naturall heat. This nutritiue operation hath foure other subordinate functions, or powers belongiug to it, Attraction, Retention, Digestion, Expulsion. 
                        See more of Attraction in Scal. exerc. 343. 
                        Attraction is a ministring

facultie, which as a Lodestone doth Iron, drawes meat into the stomacke, or as a lampe drawes oyle, and this attractiue power is very necessary in Plants, which sucke vp moisture by the root, as another mouth into the sap, or another stomacke. Retention keeps it being attracted into the stomack, Retention. vntill such time it be concocted, for if it should passe away straight, the body could not be nourished. Digestion, 
                        Digestion. is performed by naturall heat, as the heat of a torch consumes oyle, wax, tallowe: so doth it alter and digest the nutritiue matter. Indigestion is opposite vnto it, for want of naturall heat. Of this Digestion there be three differences, Maturation, 
                        Maturation. 
                        Elixation, Assation. Maturation, is especially obserued in the fruits of trees: which are then said to be ripe, when the feeds are fit to be sowne againe. Cruditie is opposed to it, to which gluttons, Epicures, and idle persons are most subiect, which vse no exercise to stirre vp naturall heat, or choake it, as to much wood puts out a fire. Elixation, 
                        Elixation. is the boyling of meat in the stomacke, by the said naturall heat, as meat is boyled in a pot to which corruption or putrefaction is opposite. Besides these three severall operations of Digestion,

                        Expulsion is a power of Nutrition, by which he expells all superfluous excrements, and reliques of meat and drinke by the gutts, bladder, pores; as by purging, vomiting, spitting, sweating, vrine, haires, nailes, &c.
                     As this Nutritiue faculty serues to nourish the Body, Augmentatis. so doth the Augmenting faculty (the second operation or power of the Vegetall faculty) to the increasing of it in quantity, according to all Dimensions, long, broad, thicke, & to make it growe, til it come to his due proportion and perfect shape: which hath his period of augmentation, as of consumption & that mo

                        Life and death concomitants of the Vegetall faculties. Necessary concomitants or affections of this Vegetall facultie is life, and his privation death. To the preseruation of life the naturall heat is most requisite, though siccitie and humidity, and those first qualities be not excluded. This heat is likewise in Plants, as appeares by their increasing, fructifying &c. though not so easily perceaued; In all bodies it must haue radicall

For as this naturall heat and moisture decay, so doth our life it selfe, and if not prevented before by some violent accident, or interrupted through our owne default, is in the end dryed vp by old age, and extinguished by death for want of matter, as a lampe for want of oyle to mainetaine it.
                  
                  
                     SVBSECT. 6. Of the sensible Soule.
                     NExt in order is the Sensible Facultie, which is as farr beyond the other in dignitie, as a Beast is preferred to a Plant, hauing those Vegetall powers included in it. It is defined an Act of an organicall Body, by which it liues, hath sense, appetite, Iudgement, breath, and motion. His obiect ingenerall is a sensible or passible qualitie, because the sense is affected by it. The generall Organ is the Braine, from whom principally the sensible operations be deriued. This Sensible Soule is divided

into two parts, Apprehending, or Moouing. By the Apprehensiue power wee perceaue the Species of Sensible things present or absent, and retaine them as waxe doth the print of a Seale. By the Mouing, the Body is outwardly caried from one place to another: or inwardly moued by Spirits and Pulse. The Apprehensiue faculty is subdiuided into two parts, Inward, or Outward. Outward as the fiue senses. Of Touching, Hearing, Seeing, Smelling, Tasting; to which you may adde Scaligers sixt sense of Titillation, if you please. Inward are three; Common sense, Phantasie, Memory. Those fiue outward Senses, haue their obiect in outward things only, and such as are present, as the eye sees no colour except it be at hand, the Eare sound. Three of these Senses are of commodity, Hearing, Sight, Smell: Two of necessity, Touch, and Tast, without which wee cannot liue. Besides the Sensitiue power is Actiue, or Passiue, Actiue, as in sight, the eye sees the colour; Passiue as it is hurt by his obiect, as the eye by the Sunne-beames. According to that Axiome, Visibile forte destruit sensum. Or if the obiect be not pleasing, as a bad sound to the eare, a stinking smell to the nose, &c. Sight. Of these fiue Senses, Sight is held to bee most pretious, and the best, and that by reason of his obiect, it sees all the body at once, by it wee learne, & discerne all things, a sense most excellent for vse. To the Sight three things are required, the Obiect, the Organ, & the Medium. The Obiect in generall is Visible, or that which is to be seen, as colours & all shining bodies. The Medium is the illumination of the aire, which comes from 
                           Lumen est actus persp

                        mon sense. Betwixt the Organ and Obiect a true distance is required, that it be not too neere, or too farre of. Many excellent questions appertaine to this sense, discussed by Philosophers, as whether this sight bee caused Intra mittendo, vel extra mittendo, &c. By receauing in the visible Species, or sending of them out, which

                        Hearing, 
                        Hearing. a most excellent outward sense, by which wee learne and get knowledge. His obiect is sound or that which is heard; the Medium the aire, the Organ the eare. To the sound which is a collision of the aire, three things are required; a body to strike, as the hand of a Musitian, the body stroken, which must be solide and able to resist; as a bell, lute-string, not wooll or spunge: the Medium, the aire, which is Inward or Outward; The Outward being stroke or collided by a solide body, still strikes the next ayre, vntill it come to that inward naturall ayre, which as an exquisite Organ is contained in a little skinne formed like a drumme head, and strucke vpon by certaine smal instruments like drum-stickes, conuayes the sound by a paire of Nerues, appropriated to that vse, to the common sense, as to a iudge of sounds. There is great variety and much delight in them, for the knowledge of which consult with Boëthius, and other Musitians.
                     
                        Smelling. 
                        Smelling, is an outward sense which apprehends by the Nostrills drawing in aire. And of all the rest it is the weakest sense in men. The Organ is the Nose, or two little hollow peeces of flesh a little aboue it: the Medium the ayre to men, as water to fish: the Obiect, Smell, arising from a mixt Body resolued, which whether it be a quality, fume, or vapor, or exhalation, I will not now dispute, or of their differences, and how they are caused. This sense is an Organ of health, as Sight & Hearing, saith 
                           Lib. 19. cap. 2. 
                        Agellius, are of discipline, and that by avoiding bad smells, as by choosing good, which doe as much alter & affect the body many times, as Diet it selfe.
                     
                        Tast. 
                        Tast, a necessary sense, which perceaues all sauors by the Tongue and pallet, and that by meanes of a thinne spittle, or watery iuyce. His Organ is the Tongue with his tasting nerues, the Medium a watery iuyce, the Obiect, Tast, or sauor, which is a quality in the iuyce, arising from the mixture of the things

tasted. Some make eight Species or kindes of sauors, bitter, sweet, sharpe, salt, &c. all which sick men (as in an ague) cannot discerne, by reason of their Organs misaffected.
                     
                        Touch, the last of the senses and most ignoble, Touching. yet of as great necessity as the other, and of as great pleasure. This sense is exquisite in men, and by his nerues dispersed all ouer the Body, perceaues any tactile quality. His Organ the Nerues: his Obiect is those first qualities, hot, dry, moist, cold, and those that followe them, hard, soft, thicke, thinne, &c. Many delightsome questions are moued by Philosophers about these fiue senses; their Organs, Obiects, Mediums, which for breuity sake I omit.
                  
                  
                     SVBSEC. 7. Of the Inward Senses.
                     
                        INner Senses are three in number, so called because they are within the braine-panne, as Common Sense, Phantasie, 
                        Common Sense. 
                        Memory. Their obiects are not only things present, but they perceaue the sensible Species of things to Come, Past, Absent, such as were before in the sense. This common sense is the Iudge or Moderator of the rest, by whom we discerne all differences of obiects; for by mine eye I doe not knowe that I see, or by mine eare that I heare, but by my common sense, who iudgeth of Sounds, Colours: they are but the Organs to bring the Species to be censured, so that all their obiects are his, and all their offices his: The forepart of the braine is his Organ or seat.
                     
                        Phantasie, or Imagination, which some call Aestimatiue, 
                        Phantasie. or Cogitatiue, confirmed, saith 
                           Phis. l. 5. c. 8. 
                        Fernelius, by frequent meditation, is an inner sense, which doth more fully examine the Species perceaued by common sense, of things present or absent, and keepes them longer, recalling them to minde againe, or making new of his owne. In time of sleepe this faculty is free, & many times conceaues strange, stupend, absurd shapes

as in sicke men we commonly obserue. His Organ is the middle cell of the Braine, his Obiects all the Species communicated to him by the Common sense, by comparison of which hee faines infinite other vnto himselfe. In Melancholy men this faculty is most powerfull and strong, and often hurt, producing many monstrous and prodigious things, especially if it be stirred vp by some terrible obiect, presented to it from cō
                        mon sense, or memory. In Poets and Painters Imagination forcibly workes, as appeares by their seuerall fictions, Antickes, Images: As Ovids house of sleepe, Psyches pallace in Apuleius, &c. In men it is subiect and gouerned by Reason, or at least should be, but in Brutes it hath no superior, & is Ratio Brutorum, all the reason they haue.
                     
                        Memory.
                        Memory layes vp all the Species which the Senses haue brought in, and records them as a good Register, that they may be forth-comming when they are called for by Phantasie and Reason. His object is the same with Phantasie, his Seat and Organ the backe part of the braine.
                     The affections of these Senses, are Sleepe and Waking, common to all sensible creatures. Sleepe is a rest or binding of all the outward senses, and of the common sense, for the preseruation of body and soule, 
                        Affections of the Senses, Sleep, & Waking. 
                        as 
                        
                           Exercit. 280. Scaliger defines it. For when the common sense resteth, the outward senses rest also. The Phantasie alone is free, and his commander Reason, as appeares by those Imaginary dreames, which are of diverse kindes, Naturall, Diuine, Daemoniacall, &c. Which vary according to humours, Diet, Actions, Obiects, &c. of which Artimedorus & Cardan haue written great volumes. This ligation of senses proceeds from an inhibition of Spirits, the way being stopped by which they should come, which stopping is caused of vapors arising out of the stomacke, which fill the Nerues, by which the spirits should be convayed. When these vapors are spent the passage is open, and the spirits performe their accustomed duties, so that Waking is the action and motion of the senses, which the spirits dispersed ouer all parts, cause.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     SVBSECT. 8. Of the Moouing Faculty.
                     THis Moouing Facultie, is the other power of the Sensatiue soule, which causeth all those Inward, and Outward animal motions in the body. It is divided into two faculties, the power of Appetite, and of Moouing from place to place. 
                        Appetite. This of Appetite is threefold, as some will haue it, Naturall, as it signifies any such inclination, as of a stone to fall downward, and such actions as Retention, Expulsion, which depend not of sense, but are Vegetall, as the Appetite of meate, & drinke, hunger, and thirst. Sensitiue is common to Men and Brutes. Voluntary the third or intellectiue which commaunds the other two in men, and is a curbe vnto them, or at least should be: but for the most part is captiuated & overruled by them, and men are led like beasts by sense, giuing raines to their cō
                        cupiscence, and severall lusts. For by this appetite the Soule is led or inclined, to followe that good which the senses shall approue, or avoid that which they hold evill, his Obiect being good or evill, the one he embraceth, the other hee reiecteth. According to that Aphorisme, Omnia appetunt bonum, all things seeke their owne good, or at least seeming good. This power is inseperable from sense, for where sense is, there is likewise pleasure and paine. His Organ is the same with the Common sense, and is diuided into two powers, or inclinations, Concupiscible or Irascible: or as 
                           T.W. Iesuite, in his passions of the minde. one translates it, Coueting, or Anger-inuading, Impugning. Concupiscible couets alwaies pleasant and delightsome things, and abhorres that which is distastfull, harsh, or vnpleasant. Irascible, 
                        
                           Velcurio.
                         
                        quasi aversans per iram & odium, as avoiding it with anger and indignation. All affections and perturbations arise out of these two fountaines, which although the Stoicks make light of; we hold naturall, and not to be resisted. The good affections are caused by some obiect of the same nature, and if present

they procure ioy, which dilates the Heart, and preserues the body: If absent, they cause Hope, Loue, Desire, Cōcupiscēce. The Bad are Simple, or mixt: Simple for some bad obiect present, as sorrowe which contracts the Heart, macerates the Soule, subuerts the good estate of the body, hindering all the operations of it, causing Melancholy, and many times death it selfe: or future as Feare. Out of these two arise those mixt affections, and passions of anger, which is a desire of revenge, Hatred which is inveterate anger, Zeale which is offended with him which hurts that he loues, and 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         a compound affection of Ioy and Hate, when wee reioyce at other mens mischiefe, and are grieued at their prosperitie, Pride, Selfe-loue, Emulation, Envy, Shame, &c. of which elsewhere.
                     
                        Moouing from place to place, is a faculty necessarily following the other. For in vaine were it otherwise to desire and to abhorre, if we had not likewise power to prosecute or eschewe, by moouing the body from place to place: by this faculty therefore wee locally mooue the whole body, or any part of it, and goe from one place to another. To the better performance of which three things are requisite. That which moues, by what it moues, that which is moued. That which moues is either the efficient cause or end. The ende is the obiect, which is desired or eschewed; as a Dog to catch a Hare, &c. The efficient cause in man in Reason, or his subordinate Phantasie, which apprehends this good or bad obiect, in Brutes Imagination alone which moues the Appetite, the Appetite this facultie, which by an admirable league of nature, and by mediation of the spirits, commands the Organe by which it moues: and that consists of Nerues, Muscles, cordes, dispersed through the whole body, and contracted & relaxed as the Spirits will, which moue the Muscles, or 
                           Nerui à spiritu mouentur, spiritus ab animâ, Melācthon.
                         Nerues in the midst of them, and drawe the cord, and so per consequens the ioint to the place intended. That which is moued is the body, or some member apt to moue. The motion of the body is diverse, as going, running, leaping, dancing, sitting, & such like, referred to the predicament of Situs. Worms

creepe, Birds flye, Fishes swimme: and so of parts, the chiefe of which is Respiration or breathing, which is thus performed, the outward ayre is drawne in by the vocall Artery, and sent by mediation of the Midriffe to the Lungs, which dilating themselues as a paire of bellowes, reciprocally fetch it in and send it out to the heart to coole it: and from thence now being hot convay it againe, still taking in fresh. Such a like motion is that of the Pulse, of which because many haue written whole bookes, I will say nothing.

Plato in his Phaedon, for ought I can perceiue, differs not much from this opinion, that it was from God at first, and knew all, but being inclosed in the Body, it forgets, & learnes anew, which he cals Reminiscentiam, or recalling, and that it was put into the Body at first for a punishment, and thence it goes into a beasts, & after

the immortality of it, which Pomponatius of Padua decided out of Aristotle, not long since. Plinius Auunculus cap. 7. lib. 2. & lib. 7. cap. 55. Lucretius lib. 1. Averroes. Others grant the immortality of it, but they make many fabulous fictions in the meane time of it, after the departure from the Body. Like Plato's Elisian Fields, and that Turkie Paradise, the Soules of good men they deisied; the bad saith 
                           Bonorum Lares, malorum verò larvas & Le mure

This Reasonable Soule, which Austin calles a Spirituall substance, mouing it selfe, is defined by Philosophers to be the first substantiall Act of a Naturall, Humane, Organicall Body, by which a man liues, perceiues, and vnderstands, freely doing all things, and with election. Out of which Definition we may gather, that this Rationall Soule includes the powers, and performes the duties of the two other, which are contained in it, and all three Faculties make one Soule, which is inorganicall of it selfe, although it be in all parts, & incorporeall, vsing their Organs, and working by them. It is divided into two chiefe parts, differing in office onely, not in Essence. The Vnderstanding, which is the Rationall power apprehending: the Will, which is the Rationall power mouing, to which two, all the other Rationall powers are subiect and reduced.
                  
                  
                     SVBSEC. 10. Of the Vnderstanding.
                     
                        VNderstanding, is a power of the Soule, 
                        
                           Melancton.
                         
                        by which we perceiue, know, remember, and Iudge aswell Singulars as Vniversals, hauing certaine Innate notices or beginnings of arts, a reflecting action, by which it iudgeth of his owne doings, and examines

them. Out of this Definition besides his chiefe office, which is to apprehend, iudge all which he performes, without the helpe of any Instruments or Organs, three differences appeare betwixt a man and a beast. As first, the sence onely comprehends Singularities, the Vnderstanding vniversalities. Secondly, the sence hath no innate notions, thirdly Bruts can not reflect vpon themselues. Bees indeed make neate and curious workes, and many other Creatures besides, but when they haue done, they cannot iudge of them. His obiect is God, Ens; all nature, and whatsoeuer is to bee vnderstood: which successiuely it apprehends. The obiect first mouing the Vnderstanding, is some sensible thing, after by discoursing the Minde findes out the corporeall substance, and from thence the spirituall. His actions, some say, are Apprehension, Composition, Division, Discoursing, Reasoning, Memory, which some include in Invention, and Iudgment. The common Divisions are of the Vnderstanding, Agent, and Patient. Speculatiue, and Practicke. In Habite, or in Act. Simple, or Compound. The Agent is that which is called the Wit of Man, acumen or subtilty, sharpnesse of invention, when he doth invent of himselfe without a Teacher, or learnes anew, which abstracts those intelligible Species from the Phantasie, and transferres them to the passiue Vnderstanding, 
                           Nihil in intellectu, quod non priùs fuerat in sensu.
                         
                        because there is nothing in the Vnderstanding, which was not first in the sence: that which the Imagination hath taken from Sence, this Agent iudgeth of, whether it be true or false; and being so iudged, he committes it to the Passible to bee kept. The Agent is a Doctor or Teacher, the Passiue a Scholler; and his office is to keepe, and farther iudge of such things as are committed to his charge: as a bare and rased table at first, capable of all formes & notions. Now these Notions are two-fold, Actions or Habits: Actions, by which we take Notions of, and perceiue things; Habits, which are durable lights and notions, which wee may vse when we will. 
                           Velc.
                         Some reckon vp eight kindes of them, Sence, Experience, Intelligence, Faith, Suspition, Errour, Opinion, Science, to which are added Art, Prudency,

Wisdome: as also The pure part of the Conscience. 
                        Synterisis, Dictamen rationis, Conscience; so that in all there be 14 Species of the Vnderstanding, of which some are innate, as the three last mentioned, the other are got by doctrine, learning, Vse. Plato will haue all to bee innate, Aristotle reckons vp but fiue intellectuall Habits; two speculatiue, as that Intelligence of the Principles, and Science of conclusions: Two practicke, as Prudency, whose end is to practise, Art to fabricate, Wisdome to comprehend the vse and experiments of all notions, and habits whatsoeuer. Which Division of Aristotle, if it be considered aright, is all one with the precedent; for three being innate, and fiue acquisite; the rest are improper, imperfect, and in a more strict examination excluded. Of all these I should more amply dilate, but my subiect will not permit. Three of them I will only point at, as more necessary to my following Discourse.
                     
                        Syntherisis, or the purer part of the Conscience, is an innate Habit, and doth signifie a conseruation of the knowledge of the Law of God and Nature, to know good or euill. And as our Divines hold, it is rather in the Vnderstanding, then in the Will. This makes the maior proposition, in a practicke Syllogisme. The Dictamen rationis, is that which doth admonish vs to doe Good, or Euill, and is the minor in the Syllogisme. The Conscience is that which approues Good or Euill, justifying or condemning our Actions, and is the Conclusion of the Syllogisme: as in that familiar example of Regulus the Romane, taken prisoner by the Carthaginians, and suffered to goe to Rome, on that condition he should returne againe, or pay so much for his ransome. The Syntherisis proposeth the question, his word, oath, promise is to be religiously kept, although to his Enemy, and that by the Law of Nature. 
                           Quod tibi fieri non vis, alteri ne feceris.
                         
                        Doe not that to another, which thou wouldst not haue done to thy selfe, Dictamen applies it to him, and dictates this or the like: Regulus thou wouldst not another man should falsifie his oath, or breake promise with thee. Conscience concludes, therefore Regulus, thou doest well to performe thy promise, and oughtest keepe thine oath. More of this in Religious Melancholy.

If good, it approues it, if euill, it abhorres it; so that his obiect is good, or evill. Aristotle cals this our Rationall Appetite; for as in the Sensatiue, we are carried to good or bad by our Appetite, ruled and directed by Sence: so in this we are carried by Reason. Besides, the Sensatiue Appetite hath a particular obiect, good or bad, this an vniversall immateriall, that respects onely things delectable and pleasant, this Honest. Againe, they differ in liberty. The Sensuall appetite seeing an obiect, if it bee a convenient good, cannot but desire it; if euill, avoide it: but this is free in his Essence,

                        our whole Will is averse from God, & his Law, not in naturall things onely, as to eate and drinke, lust, to which we are led headlong by our temperature, and inordinate Appetite,

we cannot resist, our cōcupiscence is originally bad, our Hart euill, the seate of our affections, captivates and enforceth our will: So that in voluntary things wee are averse from God

and goodnesse, bad by nature, 
                           Vel propter ignorantiam, quod bonis studiis non fit instructa mens vt debuit, aut divinis praeceptis exculta.
                         ignorance, worse by Art, Discipline, Custome, we get many bad Habits, and suffer them to domineere and tyrannize ouer vs, and the Deuill is still ready, and at hand, with his bad suggestions to tempt our depraued will to some ill-disposed action, to praecipitate vs to destruction: except our Will be not swayed and counterpoised againe, with some divine Praecepts, and good motions of the Spirit; which many times restraine and hinder vs, and checke vs when we are in the full careire of our dissolute courses. So Dauid corrected himselfe, when he had Saul at a vantage. Revenge and Malice were as two violent oppugners on the one side, but Honesty, Religion, Feare of God, with-held him on the other.
                     The Actions of the Will are Velle, and Nolle, will and nill: which two wordes comprehend all, and they are, Good or Bad, accordingly as they are directed: and some of them freely performed by himselfe, although the Stoicks absolutely deny it, and will haue all things inevitably done by Destiny, imposing a fatal necessity vpon vs, which wee may not resist; yet wee say that our will is free in respect of vs, and things contingent, howsoeuer in respect of Gods determinate counsell, they are inevitable and necessary. Some other actions of the Will are performed by his inferiour powers, which obey him as the Sensatiue and Mouing Appetite, as to open our eyes, to goe hether and thether, not to touch a Booke, to speake faire or foule, but this Appetite is many times rebellious in vs. It was, as I said, once well agreeing with reason in vs, and there was an excellent consent and harmony betwixt them, but that is now dissolued, they often jarre, Reason is over-borne by Passion.
                        Fertur equis auriga, nec audit currus habenas. as so many wilde horses runne away with a chariot, and will not be curbed, we know many times what is good, but will not doe it, as she said,

lust counsels one things, reason an other, there is a new reluctancy in me. We cannot resist, but as Phaedra confessed to her nurse, 
                           Seneca Hippol.
                         
                        quae loqueris, vera sunt, sed furor suggerit sequi peiora. she said well and true, and she did acknowledge it, but headstrong passion and fury, made her to doe that which was opposite. So Dauid knew the filthinesse of his fact, what a loathsome, foule, crying sinne Adultery was, yet not withstanding he would commit murder, & take away another mans Wife, enforced against Reason, Religion, to follow his Appetite.
                     Those Naturall and Vegetall powers, are not commanded by Will at all; for who can adde one cubit to his stature? These other may, but are not, and thence come all those headstrong Passions, and violent perturbations of the Minde; And many times vitious Habits, customes, ferall Diseases, because we giue so much way to our Appetite, and follow our inclination, like so many beasts. The principall Habits are two in number, Vertue, and Vice, whose peculiar Definitions, Descriptions, Differences, and kindes are handled at large in the Ethicks, and are indeed the Subiect of Morall Philosophie.

                        rather shewing what it is not, then what it is: as omitting the specificall difference, the phantasie and Brain: but I descend to particulars. The summum genus is Dotage, or Anguish of the Mind, saith Areteus, of a principal part, Hercules de Saxoniâ addes, to distinguish it from Cramp and Palsie, and such diseases as belong to the outward sence and motions (depraved) to distinguish it from Folly and Madnesse (which Montaltus makes angor animi to separate) in which, those functions are not depraved, but rather abolished, (without an ague) is added by all to sever it from

                        Phrensie, and that Melancholy, which is a pestilent Feaver. (Feare and Sorrow) make it differ from Madnesse (without a cause) is lastly inserted to specifie it from all other ordinary passions of Feare and Sorrow. We properly call that Dotage, as 
                           Cap. 4 de Mel.
                         
                        Laurentius interprets it, when some one principall faculty of the minde, as Imagination, or Reason is corrupted, as all Melancholy persons haue. It is without a Feaver, because the humor is most part colde and dry, contrary to putrefaction. Feare and Sorrow are the true Characters, and inseparable companions of Melancholy, as hereafter shall be declared.
                  
                  
                     SVBSECT. 2. Of the part affected. Affection. Parties affected.
                     SOme difference I finde amongst Writers, about the principall part affected in this disease, whether it be the Brain or Heart, or some other Member. Most are of opinion, that it is the Braine, for being a kinde of Dotage, it cannot otherwise be, but that the Braine must be affected, as a Simular part be it by 
                           Per conscensū, sive per Essentiā.
                         
                        consent or Essence, not in his Ventricles or any obstructions in them, for then it would be an Apoplexie, or Epilepsie, as 
                           Cap. 4. de Mel.
                         
                        Laurentius well obserues; but in a colde, dry distemperature of it in his substance, which is corrupt, and become too colde, or too dry, or els too hote, as in mad-men, and such as are inclined to it: & this 
                           Sec. 7. de mor. vulgar. lib. 6.

                           Specel de Melancholiâ.
                         
                        Hildisheim, and fiue others there cited, are of the contrary part, because Feare and Sorrow, which are passions, are seated in the Heart: but this obiection is sufficiently answered by 
                           Cap. 3. de Mel. pars affecta cerebrum, sive per conscensum, siue per cerebrum contingat, & procerum auctoritate & ratione stabilitur.

a fellow feeling by the Law of Nature: but forasmuch as this malady is caused by precedent Imagination, and the Appetite, to whom Spirits obey, are subiect to those principall parts, the Braine must needs be primarily misaffected, as the seate of Reason, and then the Heart, as the seate of Affection.

                        Capiuaccius, and Mercurialis haue copiously discussed this question, and both conclude the subiect is the Inner Braine, and from thence it is communicated to the Heart, and other inferiour parts, which sympathize and are much troubled, especially when it comes by consent, and is caused by reason of the Stomacke, or myrache, as the Arabians tearme it, or whole Body, Liver, or

                        Affection, whether it be Imagination or Reason alone, or both. Hercules de Saxoniâ proues out of Galen, Aetius, and Altomarus, that the sole fault is in 
                           Facultas Imaginandi, non cogitandi, nec memorandi laesa hic.
                         
                        Imagination. Bruel is of the same mind: Montaltus in his his second Chapter of Melancholy, confutes this Tenet of theirs, and illustrates the contrary, by 
                           •
                        any examples, as of him, that thought he was a shell-fish, of a Nunne, of a desperate Monke, that would not be perswaded, but that he was damned. Reason was in fault aswell as Imagination, which did not correct this Error; they make away themselues often-times, 
                           Lib. Med. cap. 19. part. 2.7. rac. 15. cap. 2. and suppose many absurd and ridiculous things. Why doth not Reason detect the Fallacy, settle and perswade if shee bee free? 
                           Lib. 3. Fen. 1. Tract. 4. cap. 18. 
                        Avicenna therefore holdes both corrupt, to whom most Arabians subscribe. The same is maintained by 
                           Lib. 3. cap. 5. 
                        Areteus, Gordonius, Guianerius &c. To end the controversie, no man doubts of Imagination, but that it is hurt and mis-affected heere; for the other I determine with

Leonart. Iacchinus com. in 9. Rasis. cap. 15. Cap. 16. in 9. Rasis.
                         
                        What this humor is, or whence it proceeds, how it is ingendred in the Body, neither Galen, nor any old Writer hath sufficiently discussed, as Iacchinus thinkes: the Neotericks cannot agree. Montanus in his consultations, holdes Melancholy to be materiall or immateriall: and so doth Arculanus: the materiall is one of the foure humors before mentioned, and naturall or adventitious, acquisite, redundant, vnnaturall, artificiall. Paracelsus wholly reiects and derides this division of foure humors and complexions, but our Galenists ingenerally approue of it, subscribing to this of Montanus.
                     
                     This naturall Melancholy is either Simple, or Mix't, offending in Quantity or Quality, varying according to his place, where it setleth, as Braine, Splene, Meseriacke veines, Hear, Wombe, and Stomack: or varying according to mixture of those naturall humors amongst themselues, or foure vnnaturall adust humors, as they are diversly tempered and mingled, If naturall Melancholy abound in the Body, which is colde & dry, so that it be more 
                        
                           Secundùm magis aut minùs si in corpore fucrit ad intemperiem plusquam corpus salubritér ferre poterit: indè corpus morbosum efficitur.
                         
                        then the Body is well able to beare, it must needs be distempered saith Faventinus, and diseased: and so of the other, if it be depraved, whether it arise from that other Melancholy, or Choler adust, or from Blood, produceth the like effects, and is as Montaltus contends, if it come by adustion of humors, most part hote and dry. Some difference I finde, whether this Melancholy matter may be ingendred of all foure humors, about the color and temper of it. Galen
                        
holdes it may be ingendred of three alone, excluding Fleame or Pituitae, whose true assertion,

This diversity of Melancholy matter, produceth diversity of effects. If it be within the

If it trouble the minde, as it is diversly mix't, it produceth severall kindes of Madnesse and Dotage, of which in their place.

                     VVHen the matter is divers and confused, how should it otherwise be, but that the Species should be divers and confused? Many new and old Writers haue written confusedly of it, confounding Melancholy and Madnesse, as

                           Cap 6. lib. 1. 
                        Aurelianus, Paulus Aegineta: others acknowledge a multitude of kindes, and leaue them indefinite, as 2 Ser. 2. cap. 9 Morbus hic est omnifarius.

                        If naturall melancholy be adust, it maketh one kinde, if blood, another; if choler, a third, differing from the first, and so many severall opinions there are about the kindes, as there bee men themselues. Savanorola Rub. 11. Tract. 6. cap. 1. de aegritud. Cap. will haue the kinds to be infinite, one from the myrache, called myrachialis of the Arabians; another stomachalis, from the stomack, another from the liuer, heart, wombe, haemrods: 
                        
                           Quaedam incipiens, quaedam consummata.
                         
                        one beginning, another consummate. Melancthon seconds him,

                        as the humor is diversly adust and mixt, so are the Species diuerse: but what these men speake of species, I thinke ought to be vnderstood of symptomes, and so doth 
                           Cap. 16. in 9. Rasis.
                         
                        Arculanus interpret himselfe: Infinite species and symptomes: and in that sense, as Io. Gorrheus acknowledgeth in his medicinall definitiōs, the species are infinite, but they may be reduced to three kindes, by reason of their seat, Head, Body, and Hypocondries. This threefold division is approoved by Hippocrates in his booke of Melancholy (if it be his, which some suspect) by Galen lib. 3. de loc. affectis cap. 6. by Alexander lib. 1. cap. 16. Rases lib. 1. Continent. Tract. 9. lib. 1. cap. 16. Avicenna,
                        
and most of our new Writers. Th. Erastus makes two kinds; one perpetual, which is Head melancholy, the other interrupt, which comes and goes by fits, which he subdivides into the other two kindes, so that all comes to the same passe. Some againe makes foure or fiue kindes, adding 
                           Laurentius cap. 4. de Melan.
                         
                        Loue melancholy to the first, and Lycanthropia. The most receiued division is into three kindes. The first proceeds from the sole fault of the Braine, and is called Head melancholy: the second sympathetically proceedes from the whole Body, when the whole temperature is Melancholy: The third ariseth from the Bowels, Liuer, Splene, or Membrane, called Mesenterium, named Hypochondriacall, or windy melancholy, which 
                           Cap. 13. 
                        Laurentius subdivides into three parts, from those three Members, Hepaticke, Splenaticke, M
                              •
                           sariacke. Loue melancholy, which Avicenna calles Ilishi, and Lycanthropia, which he calles Cucubuthe, are commonly included in Head Melancholy: but of this last, which Gerardus de Solo calles Amoreos, and most Knight melancholy, with that of Religious melancholy, and all the other kindes, of Loue melancholy, I will speake of a-part by themselues, in my third Partition. The three precedent species are the subiect of my discourse, which I wil anatomize, and treat of, through all their causes, symptomes, cures, together, and a-part, that euery man that is in any measure affected with this malady, may know how to examine it in himselfe, and apply remedies vnto it.
                     It is a hard matter I confesse to distinguish these three species, one from the other, to expresse their seuerall causes, symptomes, cures, being that they are so often confounded amongst themselues, hauing such affinity, that they can scarce be discerned, by the most acuratest Phisitians themselues; and so often intermixt with other diseases, that the best experienced haue beene plunged. Montanus consil. 26. had a patient that had this disease of Melancholy, & Caninus Appetitus both together. And consil. 23. with Vertigo.

                        Paulus Regolius a great

Doctor in his time consulted in this case, was so confounded with a confusion of Symptomes; that he knewe not to what kinde of Melancholy to referre it.

                        Trincauellius, Fallopius, and Francanzanus, three famous Doctors in Italy, all three conferred with about one party at the same time, gaue three different opinions. And in another place Trincauellius being demanded what he thought of a melancholy young man, to whom he was sent for, ingeniously confessed hee was indeed melancholy, but he knewe not to what kinde to reduce it. In his 17. consultation, there is the like disagreement about a melancholy Monke. Sometimes they cannot well discerne this Disease from others. In Reinerus Solenanders counsels, Sect. 3. consil. 5. He and D. Brande, both agreed that the patients disease was Hypochondriacal melancholy, D. Matholdus said it was Astma and nothing else. 
                           Guarion. cons. med. 2. 
                        Solenander and Guarionius, lately sent for to the melancholy Duke of Cleue with others, could not define what Species it was, or agree amongst themselues. The Species are so confounded as in Caesar Claudinus his 44. consultation for a Polonian Count. In his iudgement 
                           Laborauit per essentiam & à toto corpore.
                         
                        he labored of head melancholy, and that which proceeds from the whole temperature both at once. I could giue instance of some that haue had all three kindes, semèl & simùl, & some successiuely. In such variety of Symptomes, causes: How difficult a thing is it to treat of severall kinds apart; to make any certainty amongst so many casualties, distractions, when seldome two men shall be like affected per omnia? T'is hard I confesse, yet neverthelesse I will adventure through the midst of these perplexities, and led by the clewe or thred of the best writers, extricate my selfe out of a labyrinth of doubts and errors, and so proceed to the causes.

                        Fernelius puts a kinde of necessity in the knowledge of the causes, and without which it is impossible to cure, or to preuent any manner of disease. Empericks may ease, and sometimes helpe, but not throughly root out, sublata causâ tollitur effectus, as the saying is, if the cause be remoued the effect is likewise vanquished. It is a most difficult thing I confesse, to bee able to discerne these causes whence they are, and in such

                        Generall causes, are either supernaturall or naturall. Supernaturall are from God and his Angels, or by Gods permission frō the Divell and his ministers. That God himselfe is a cause for the punishment of sinne, and satisfaction of his Iustice, many examples and testimonies of holy Scriptures make evident vnto vs. Psal. 107.17. Foolish men are plagued for their offence, and by reason of their wickednesse. Gehezi was stroken with Leprosie, 2. Reg. 5.27. Dauid plagued for numbring his people. 1. Par. 21. Sodom and Gomorah swallowed vp. And this Disease is peculiarly specified. Psal. 107.12. He brought down

their heart through heauinesse. Deut. 28.28. He stroke them with madnesse, blindnesse, and astonishment of heart.

                     HOw farre the power of Divels doth extend, and whether they can cause this or any other Disease, is a serious question and worthy to be considered, for the better vnderstanding of which, I will make a briefe digression of the nature of Diuells. And although the question bee very obscure, according to

the Peripateticks, and Aristotle himselfe, as Pomponatius stifly maintaines, and Scaliger in some sort grants. Epicures and Atheists are of the same mind in generall, because they neuer saw them. Plato, Plotinus, Porphyrius, Iamblicus, Proclus, insisting in the steps of Trismegistus and Socrates, make no doubt of it: Nor Stoicks but that there are such spirits, though much erring from the truth. Concerning the first beginning of them, the

                         corporeall, and haue aeriall bodies, that they are mortall, liue and dye, that they are nourished and haue excrements, that they feele paine if they be hurt (which Cardan confirmes) or stroken: and if their bodies be cut, with admirable celeritie they come together againe. Austin in Gen. lib. 3. de lib. arbit. holds as much, Mutata casu corpora in deteriorem qualitatem aeris spissioris. That in their fall their bodies were changed into a more aeriall & grosse substance. That they can assume all manner of shapes at their pleasures, appeare in what likenesse they will themselues, that they are most swift in motion, and can passe many miles in an instant, and so likewise

Strozzius Cicogna hath many examples. lib. 3. omnif. mag. cap. 4. & 5. which he there confutes.

That which Plotinus of his, that he had likewise Deum pro Daemonio, and that which Porphiry concludes of them all in generall, if they be neglected in their sacrifice they are angry, and send many plagues amongst vs; but if pleased then they doe much good, is as vaine as the rest, and confuted by Austin lib. 9. cap. 8. de Civit. Dei. Eusebius lib. 4. praeparat. Evangel. cap. 6. and others. Yet thus much I finde, that our Schoolemen and

                         other Diuines make nine kinds of bad Divels, as Dionysius hath done of Angels. In the first ranke are those false Gods of the Gentiles, which were adored heretofore in severall Idols, and gaue Oracles at Delphos and elsewhere, whose prince is Belzebub. The second ranck is of Liers, and Aequivocaters, as Apollo Pythius, and the like. The third are those vessels of anger, inventers of all mischiefe, 
                           Vasa irae. c. 13 as that Theutus in Plato. Esa calls them vessels of fury; their prince is Beliall. The fourth are malitious revenging Diuels, and ther prince is Asmodeus. The fift kind are coseners, such as belong to magitians & witches, their prince is Satan. The sixt are those aëriall Diuells that

The seauenth is a distroyer, captain of the furies, causing warres, tumults, combustions, vproares, mentioned in the Apocalips, and called Abaddon. The eight is that accusing or calumniating Diuell, whom the Greeks call Diabolus, that driues vs to dispaire. The ninth are those tempters in seueral kindes, and their prince is Mammon. Psellus makes six kinds, but none aboue the Moone: but Gazeus cited by

                        Marcilius Ficinus seemes to second this opinion out of Plato, or from himselfe I know not, as every Spheare is higher, so hath it more excellent inhabitants: which belike is that Galileus à Galileo, & Kepler aimes at in his nuncio Syderio, when he will haue

For if that bee true that some of our Mathematitians say: that if a stone should fall from that starry heauen, or eight Spheare, and should passe euery houre an hundreth miles, it would bee 65. yeares or more before it would come to ground, by reason of the great distance of heauen from earth, which containes, as some say 170 Millions 803 miles, besides those other heauens, whether they bee Christalline or watery which Maginus ads, which peradventure holde as much more, how many such spirits may it containe? And yet for all this

They are confined vntill the day of iudgement, to this sublunary world, and can worke no farther then the foure Elements, and as God permits them. Wherefore of these sublunary Diuels, Psellus makes six kindes, fiery, aeriall, terrestriall, watery, and subterranean Diuels, besides those Fairies, Satyres, Nymphs, &c.
                     Fiery Diuels are such as commonly worke by blasing starres, fire-drakes, & counterfeit Sunnes and Moones, which never appeare, saith Cardan, but they signifie some mischiefe or other to come vnto men: Our stories are full of such apparitions. Some thinke they keep their residence in that Hecla, mountaine in Island, Aetna in Sicily. Lypera, Vesnuius, &c. These Divels were worshipped heretofore by that superstitious 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        , and the like.
                     Aeriall Divels are such as keepe quarter most part in the

                        Ionianus Pontanus. And nothing so familiar if (we may beleeue those relations of Saxo Grammat. Olaus Magnus, Damianus A-Goes) as for Witches & Sorcerers, in Lapland,

These kinds of Diuels are much delighted in Sacrifice, saith Porphyrius, and held all the world in awe, & had seueral names, Idols, Sacrifices in Rome, Greece,

Egypt, and at this day tyrannise over and deceaue those Ethnicks and Indians, being adored and worshipped for

                         relate, an aeriall Divell bound to him for 20 and eight yeares. As Agrypa's dog had a diuell tied to his coller, some thinke, and Paracelsus (or else Erastus belies him) had one confined to his sword pummell: others weare them in rings &c. Iannes and Iambres did many things of old by their helpe, Simon Magus, Cinops, and Tritemius of late, that shewed Maximilian the Emperour his wife after she was dead, & verrucam collo eius, saith

                     Water diuels, are those Naiades or water Nymphes, which haue beene heretofore conversant about Waters and Riuers. The water, as Paracelsus thinks, is their Chaos, wherein they liue, some call them Feries, and say that Habundia is their Queene, these cause inundations, many times shipwracks, & deceaue men seuerall waies, as Succubae or otherwise.

And Faelix Malleolus in his booke de crudelitate demonum, affirmes as much, that these Trolli, or Telchiues, are very common in Norway, and

                     Subterranean Diuells, are as common as the rest and doe as much harme. Olaus Magnus lib. 6. cap. 19. makes six kinds of them, Some bigger some lesse. These, saith

                         afrighted out of their wits, carried away quite sometimes, and severally molested by his meanes. Plotinus the Platonist, lib. 14. adversus Gnost. laughes them to scorne, that hold the Divell can cause any such diseases. Many thinke he can worke vpon the body, but not vpon the minde. But experience pronounceth otherwise, that hee can worke both vpon body and minde. Tertullian is of this opinion, cap. 22.

                        begins first with the phantasie, and moues that so strongly that no reason is able to resist. Now the Phantasie he moues by mediation of humors: Although many Physitians are of opinion

that the Divell can alter the minde, and produce this disease of himselfe. Quibusdam medicorum visum, saith 
                           Lib. 3. Fen. 1. Tract. 4. cap. 18.

                        that this disease proceeds especially from the divell, & from him alone. And Arculanus cap. 6. in 9. Rhasis, Aelianus Montaltus in his 9. cap. confirmes as much, that the diuell can cause this disease; by reason many times that the parties affected prophecie, speake strange languages, but non sine interuentu humoris, not without the humour as he interprets himselfe, no more doth Avicenna, si contingat à daemonio, sufficit nobis vt convertat complectionem ad choleram nigram, & sit causa eius propinqua cholera nigra, the immediat cause is choler adust: and there vpon belike this humour of melancholy, is called Balneum Diaboli, the Diuels Bath: the Divell spying his opportunity of such humours, driues them many times to dispaire, fury, rage, &c. mingling himselfe amongst those humours.

And in another place. These vncleane spirits setled in our bodies, and now mixt with our melancholy humours, doe triumph as it were, and sport themselues, as in another heauen. Thus he argues, and that they goe in and out of our bodies, as Bees doe in a hiue, and so prouoke vs and tempt vs as they perceaue our temperature inclined of it selfe, and most apt to bee deluded.

Rational. cap. 86. num. 8. relates that he saw a wench possessed in Bononia with two Divells, by eating an vnhallowed Pomegranet, as shee did afterwards confesse, when she was cured by exorcismes. And therfore our Papists doe signe themselues so often with the signe of the Crosse, ne daemon ingredi ausit, and exorcise all manner of meats, as being vncleane or accursed otherwise, as Bellarmine defends. Many such stories I finde amongst Pontificiall writers, to proue their assertions, let them free their owne credits: some few I will recite in this kinde out of most approoued Phisitians. Cornelius Gemma lib. 2. de nat. mirac. cap. 4. relates of a young maid, called Katherine Gualter a Coupers daughter, Ao 1571. that had such strange passions and conuulsions, that three men could not sometimes hold her, shee purged a liue Eele, which he saw a foot and a halfe long, and touched himselfe, but the Eele afterward vanished, shee vomited after some 24l of black stuffe of all colours, twice a day for foureteene dayes: and after that shee vomited great balls of haire, peeces of wood, pigeons dung, parchment, Goose dung, coles; and after them 2 pound of pure blood, & then againe coles, and stones, of which some had inscriptions, bigger thē a walnut, some of them peeces of glasse, brasse, &c. Besides strange paroxismes of laughing, weeping, and extasies, &c. Et hoc inquit cum horrore vidi, this I saw with horror. They could doe no good on her by physicke, but left her to the Clergy. Marcellus Donatus lib. 2. cap. 1. de med. mirab. hath such another story of a country fellow, that had foure knifes in his belly, Instar serrae dentatos indented like a sawe, every one a spanne long, and a wreath of haire like a globe, with much baggage of like sort, wonderfull to behold. How it

should come into his guts, he concludes, Certè non alio quam daemonis astutiâ & dolo. Langius epist. med. lib. 1. epist. 38. hath many relations to this effect, and so hath Christophorus à Vega.

                        He that shall haue Saturne or Mars, the one culminating, the other in the 4. house, when he shall be borne, shall be melancholy, of which he shall be cured in time, if Mercury behold them.

Ingenerally they conclude all, that if Saturnes mount be full of many small lines and intersections,

                        Cardan subtil. lib. 18. will be subiect to madnesse & melancholy: for if the spirits of the braine be fusled, or mis-affected by such meanes, at such a time, their children will be fusled in the braine: they will be dul, heavy, discontented all their liues. Some are of opinion, and maintaine that Paradoxe or Probleme, that wise men beget commonly fooles, and which

                        Erasmus maintaines in his Moriâ, fooles beget wise men. Cardan subt. lib. 12. glues this cause, quoniam spiritus sapientum ob studium resolvuntur, & in cerebrum feruntur à corde: because their naturall spirits are resolued by study, and turned into animall, drawne from the heart, and those other parts to the braine.

                        Lemnius subscribes to that of Cardan, and assignes this reason quod persoluant debitum languidè, & oscitantèr, vndè faetus a parentum generositate desciscit: they pay their

debt, as Paul cals it, to their wiues but sparingly and remissely, doe their businesse, by which meanes their children are weakelings, and many times idiots and fooles.
                     Some other causes are giuen, which properly pertaine to, and proceede from the mother: If shee be ouer-dull, heavy, angry, peevish, discontented, and Melancholy, not onely at the time of conception, but euen all the while she carries the childe in her wombe, saith Fernelius path. lib. 1. cap. 11. her sonne will be so likewise affected, and worse.

So many seuerall wayes are we plagued and punished for our fathers defaults: In so much, that as Fernelius truly saith,

                        Hector Boëthius, if any were visited with the falling sicknesse, or madnesse, goute, leprosie, or any such dangerous disease, which was likely to be propagated from the father to the sonne, he was instantly gelded: a woman kept from all company of men, and if by chance hauing some such disease, shee were found to bee with childe, shee with her brood were buried aliue: and this was done for the common good, lest the whole nation should be injured or corrupted. A severe doome you will say, and not to be vsed amongst Christians, yet more to be looked into then it is. For now by our too much facility in this kinde, in giuing way to all to marry that will, our too much liberty & indulgence in tolerating all sorts, there is a vast confusion of hereditary diseases, no family secure, no man almost free from some grievous infirmity or other, when no choice is had, but still the eldest must marry, as so many stallions of the Race, or if rich, be they fooles or disardes, lame or maimed, vnable, intemperate, dissolute, exhauste through riot, as he said,

                     ACcording to my proposed method, hauing opened hitherto these secundary causes, which are inbred with

vs, I must now proceede to the outward and adventitious, which happen vnto vs after we are borne. And those are either Euident, Remote, or inward Antecedent, and the nearest: Cont
                           •
                        nent causes some call them. These outward, remote, praecedent causes are subdivided againe, into necessary and not necessary.
                              Fecit omnia delicta quae fieri possunt circa res sex non-naturales, & eae fuerunt causae extrinsecae, ex quibus postea ortae sunt obstructiones.
                            Necessary (because we cannot avoide them, but they wil alter vs, as they are vsed, or abused) are those six non-naturall things, so much spoken of amongst Physitians) and which are principall causes of this disease. For almost in every consultation, where as they shall come to speake of the causes, the fault is found, and this most part objected to the patient, peccavit circa res sex non naturales: he hath still offended in one of those sixe. Montanus consil. 22. consulted about a Melancholy Iewe, giues that sentence, so did Frisemelica in the same place: and in his 244. counsell, censuring a melancholy souldier, he giues that cause of his malady, that he offended in all those sixe non-naturall things, which were the outward causes, from which came those inward obstructions: & so in the rest.
                     These six non-naturall things, are Diet, Retention, and Evacuation, which are more materiall then the other, because they make new matter, or els are conversant in keeping or expelling of it. The other foure are Aire, Exercise, Sleeping & Waking, and perturbations of the Minde, which onely alter the matter. The first of these is Diet, which consist's in meate and drinke, and causeth Melancholy, as it offends in Substance or Accidents, that is, quantity, quality, or the like. And well it may be called a materiall cause, since that as

                        Fernelius hath it: It hath such a power in begetting of diseases, and yeeldes the matter and sustenance of them, for neither aire, nor perturbations, nor any of those other evident causes take place, or worke this effect, except the constitution of body, and preparation of humors doe concurre. That a man may say, This Diet is the Mother of Diseases, let the father be what he will, and from this alone Melancholy, and many other maladies arise. Many Physitians I confesse, haue written copious volumes of

How they alter and change the matter, spirits first, and after humors, by which we are preserued, and the constitution of our body, Fernelius and others will shew you: I hasten to the thing it selfe. And first of such Diet as offends in substance.
                     
                        Beefe, a strong & hearty meat, (cold in the first degree,Beefe. dry in the second Galen lib. 3. cap, 1. de alim. sac.) is condemned by him, and all succeeding Authors, to breed grosse melancholy blood: Good for such as are sound, and of a strong constitution, for labouring men, if ordered aright, corned, yong, of an oxe, (for all gelded meats in every species are held best) or if old, 
                           Frietagius.
                        such as haue bin tyred out with labour, are preferred. Aubanus and Sabellicus commend Portingall Beefe to be the most savory, best, & easiest of digestion; we commend ours: but all is rejectèd, and vnsit for such as lead a resty life, or any wayes inclined to melancholy, or dry of complexion: Tales Galen thinkes, de facili melancholicis aegritudinibus capiuntur.
                     
                     
                        Porke, of all meats is most nutritiue in his own nature,Porke. but altogether vnfit for such as liue at ease, or are any wayes vnsound of body or mind: Too moist, full of humors, and therfore noxia delicatis saith Sanavorola, ex earum vsu vt dubitetur, an febris quartana generetur: naught for queasie stomacks,

                           Omni loco & omni tempore medici detastantur anguillas praesertim circa solstitium. Damnantur tum sanis tum aegris.
                         
                        Eeles cap. 33. he abhorres in all places, at all times, all Physitians detest them, especially about the solstice. Gomesius lib. 1. cap. 22. de sale doth immoderately extol all Sea-fish, which others as much vilifie, & aboue the rest dried, sowced, indurate fish, as Ling, Fumados Red-herrings, Sprats, Stockfish, Halberdine, poore Iohn, all shelfish.
                           Cap. 6. in his Tract of Melancholy. 
                        Tim. Bright excepts Lobstar and Crab. Messarius commendes Salmon, which Bruerinus contradicts lib. 22. cap. 17. Magninus reiects Conger, Sturgeon, Turbit, Maquarell, Scate. Carp, is a fish of which I knowe not well what to determine: Franciscus Bonsuetus accounts it a muddy fish, Hippolitus Salvianus in his booke de Piscium naturâ & praparatione, which was printed at Rome in fol. 1554. in most elegant pictures, esteemes Carp no better then a slimy watery meat. P. Iouius on the other side disallowing tench, approues of it. So doth Dubrauius in his bookes of Fishponds. Freitagius 
                        
                           Optimè nutrit omnium Iudicio inter prime notae pisces gustu praestanti.
                         extols it for an excellent wholsome meat, and puts it amongst the Fishes of the best rancke: and so doe most of our country Gentlemen, that store their ponds almost with no other Fish. But this controuersie is easily decided in my iudgement by Bruerinus lib. 22. cap. 13. The difference ariseth from the difference and site and nature of pooles,
                           Non est dubium quin pro vivariorum situ, ac naturâ magnas alimentorum sortiantur differentias, alibi suauiores alibi lutulentiores.
                         sometimes muddy, sometimes sweet, they are in tast as the place is from whence they be taken. In like manner almost we may conclude of other fresh-fish. But see more in Bellonius, Oribasius, lib. 7. cap. 22. Isaack. lib. 1. especially Hoppolitus Salvianus, instar omnium solus, &c. Howsoeuer they may be wholsome and approued, much vse of them is not good; P. Forestus in his Medicinall obseruations, 
                           Obseruat. 16. lib. 10. relates that Carthusian Friers, whose liuing is most part Fish, are more subiect to Melancholy then any other order, and that hee found by experience, being sometimes their Phisitian ordinary at Delft in Holland. He exemplifies it with an instance of one Buscodnese a Carthusian of a ruddy colour, and well likeing, that by solitary liuing and fish eating became so misaffected.
                     
                        
Amongst hearbes to be eaten, I finde Gourds, Cowcumbers, Coleworts, Millions disallowed,Hearbs. but especially Cabbage. It causeth troublesome dreames, and sendes vp blacke vapors to the braine. Galen. loc. affect. lib. 3. cap. 6. of all hearbs condemnes Cabbage. And Isaack. lib. 2. cap. 1. animae gravitatem facit, it brings heauinesse to the soule. Some are of opinion, that all rawe hearbs and sallets breed Melancholy blood, except Buglosse and Lettice, Crato consil. 21. lib. 2. speakes against all hearbes and worts, except Borrage, Buglosse, Fennel, Parsly, Dill, Bawm; Succory.

                        Cardan makes that a cause of their continuall sicknesse at Fessa in Africke, because they liue so much on fruits, eating them thrice a day. Laurentius approues of many fruits in his tract of Melancholy, which others disallow, and amongst the rest Apples, which many likewise commend, as Sweetings, Pairemaines, Pippins, as good against melancholy. But to him that is any way inclined to, or touched with this malady,

                        Nicholas Piso in his Practicks forbids all fruits, as windie, or to be sparingly eaten at least, and not raw. Amongst other fruits 
                           Lib. 11. cap. 3. Pulse. 
                        Bruerinus forth of Galen, excepts Grapes and Figges, but I finde them likewise reiected. All Pulse are naught, Beanes, Pease, Fitches, &c. They fill the braine, saith Isaack with grosse fumes, breed blacke thicke blood, and cause troublesome dreames. And therefore that which Pythagoras said to his Schollers of old, may bee for ever applyed to melancholy men▪ 
                        à fabis abstinete, Eat no Pease nor Beans: yet to such as will needs eat them, I would giue counsell to prepare them according to those rules that Arnoldus, Villanouanus, Frietagius prescribe, for eating and dressing Fruits, Hearbs, Roots, Pulse, &c.
                     Spices cause hot and head melancholy,Spices. and are for that cause forbidden by our Phisitions, to such men as are inclined

to this malady, as Pepper, Ginger, Cinnamon. Cloues, Mace, Dates, &c. Hony and Sugar. Bright cap 6. excepts hony. Some except Hony, to those that are cold it may be more tolerable, but

                        Dulcia se in bilě vertunt, they are obstructiue. Crato therefore forbids all spice in a consultation of his, for a melancholy Schoolemaster, Omnia aromatica, & quicquid sanguinem adurit: so doth Fernelius consil. 45. Guianerius tract. 15. cap. 2. Mercurialis cons. 189. To these I may adde all sharpe and sower things, or luscious and ouer sweet, or Fat, as Oyle, Vineger, Veriuice, Mustard, Salt. As sweet things are obstructiue, so these are corrosiue. Gomesius in his bookes de Sale lib. 1. cap. 21. highly commends Salt; so doth Codronchus in his Tract de sale Absynthij. Lemn. lib. 3. cap. 9. de occult. nat. mir. yet common experience findes Salt and salt meats to be great causes of this disease. And for that cause belike those Egyptian Priests abstained from salt, euen so much as in their bread, vt sine perturbatione anima esset, saith my Author, that their soules might be free from perturbations.
                     Bread that is made of baser grain; as Pease, Beanes, Oates,Bread. Ric, or 
                           Ne comedas crustam choleram quia gignit adustam. Schol. Sal.
                         ouer hard baked, and crusty blacke, is much spoke against, as causing melancholy iuyce and winde. Ioh. Maior in his first booke of his history of Scotland, contends much for the wholsomnesse of oaten bread; It was obiected to him the liuing at Paris in France, that his countrimen fed on Oates & base graine, as a disgrace, but hee doth ingeniously confesse that Scotland, Wales, and a third part of England, did most part vse that kinde of bread, but that it was as wholsome as any graine, and yeelded as good nourishment. And yet Wecker out of Galen calls it horse meat, & fitter for iuments then for men to feed on. But read Galen himselfe lib. 1. de cibis boni & mal. succi. more largely, discoursing of Corne & Bread.
                     All black Wines, ouer hot compound strong thick drinks,Wine, Beers. as Muscadine, Malmesie, Allegant, Rumny, Browne bastard, Metheglen, and the like, of which they haue 30 severall kinds in Muscovy, all such made drinkes are hurtfull in this case, to such as are hot, or of a sanguine cholericke complection, or

young, or inclined to head melancholy. For many times the drinking of wine alone causeth it.
                           Vinum turbidum.
                         
                        Arculanus cap. 16 in 9. Rhasis puts in wine for a great cause, especially if it be immoderately vsed. Guianerius Tract. 15. cap. 2. tells a story of two Dutch-men, to whom hee gaue entertainement in his house, that in 
                              Ex vini potentis bibitione duo Alemani in vno mense Melancholici facti sunt.
                            one months space were both melancholy by drinking of Wine, one did naught but sing, the other sighe. Galen l. de causis morb. cap. 3. Mathiolus on Dioscorides, and aboue all other Andreas Bachius lib. 3. c. 18.19.20. haue reckoned vp those inconveniences that come by wine. Yet notwithstanding all this to such as are cold, or sluggish melancholy, a cup of wine is good physick, and so doth Mercurialis grant, consil. 25. in such cases, if the temperature be cold, as to most melancholy men it is, wine is much commended, if it be moderately vsed. Cider and Perry are both cold and windy drinks,Cider, Perry. & for that cause to be neglected, and so are all those hot spiced strong drinks.

Pliny lib. 31. cap. 3. is of the same Tenet. And P. Crescentius agricult. lib. 1. & lib. 4. cap. 11. &c. 45. such waters are naught, not to be vsed, and by the testimony of

This which they say stands to good reasō, for as geographers relate of the water of Astracan, it breeds wormes in such as drinke it. I. Aubanus Bohemius referres that

Hieronimus Mercurialis in his chapter of Melācholy, cites this for an especiall cause of this malady, and of

                        many monkes, and widdowes grievously troubled with melancholy and that from this sole cause. Aelianus Montaltus. cap. 27. de melanchol. confirmes as much out of Galen: so doth Wierus, and Christopherus a Vega de art. med. lib. 3. cap. 14. relate many such examples of men,

                        tels a story of an ancient Gentleman in Alsatia, that married a young wife and was not able to pay his debts in that kinde, for a long time together by reason of his severall infirmities, but she by reason of this inhibition of Venus fell into a horrible fury, and desired every one that came to see her, by words, lookes, and gesture to haue to doe with her, &c. Bernardus Paternus a Physitian, saith hee knewe a good honest godly Priest, that because he would neither marry, nor make vse of the Stews fell into grievous melancholy fits. Hildesheim spicel. 2. hath such another instance of an Italian melancholy Priest in a consultation had Ao 1580.

Any other Evacuation stopped, will cause it, as well as these aboue-named, be it bile, 
                           Ex cauterio & vlcere exsiccato.
                         vlcer, issue &c. Hercules de Saxoniâ lib. 1. cap. 16. and Gordonius verifies this out of their experience. They saw one wounded in the head, who as long as the sore was open, lucida habuit mentis intervalla, was wel, but when it was stopped, redijt melancholia, his melancholy fit seased on him againe.
                     Artificiall Evacuations are much like in effect, as hotehouses, bathes, blood-letting, purging, vnseasonably, and immoderatly vsed. 
                           Gord. cap. 10. lib. 1. discommends colde bathes as noxious.
                         Bathes 
                           Siccum reddūt corpus.
                         dry too much, if vsed in excesse, be they naturall, or artificiall, and offend extremae hote, or cold; one dries, the other refrigerates in extreames. Montanus consil. 237. saith, they overheate the Liuer. Ioh. Struthius Stigmat. artis lib. 4. cap. 9. contends, 
                           Si quis longius moretur in ijs, aut nimis frequenter, aut importunè vtatur humores putrefacit.
                         
                        that if one stay longer then ordinary at the Bathe, or goe in too oft, or at vnseasonable times, he putrifies the humors in his body. To this purpose writes Magninus lib. 3. cap. 5. Guianerius Tract. 15. cap. 21. vtterly disallowes all hote Bathes in melancholy adust. 
                           Ego anno superiore quendam guttosum vidi adustum, qui vt liberaretur de guttâ, ad balnea accessit, & de guttâ liberatus, maniacus factus est.
                         
                        I saw, saith he, a man that laboured of the goute, who to be freed of his malady, came to the Bathe, and was instantly cured of his gout, but got another which was worse, and that was Madnesse. But this iudgment varies as the humour doth, in hote, or colde. Baths may be good for one melancholy man, bad for another: that which may cure it in one party, may cause it in another.
                     
                        Phlebotomy.
                        Phlebotomy many times neglected, may doe much harme to the body, when there is a manifest redundance of bad humors and melancholy blood; and when these humors heate and boyle, if this be not vsed in time, the parties affected so inflamed, are in great danger to be mad: but if it be vnadvisedly, importunely, immoderately vsed, it doth as much harme by refrigerating the body, dulling the spirits, and consuming them: as Ioh. Curio in his 10. chap. well reprehends, it doth more harme then good, such kind of letting blood, On Schola Salernitana.
                         
                        and the humors rage much more then they did before, 
                        
                           Calefactio & ebullitio per venae incisionem magis saepè incitatur & augetur maiore impetu humores per corpus discurrunt.
                         
                        and is so farre from avoiding melancholy, that it increaseth it, and weakeneth the sight.

                        Leonartus Iacchinus speakes out of his owne experience, 
                           Multo nigrior spectatur sanguis post dies quosdam, quam fuit ab initio.
                         
                        the blood is much blacker to many men after their letting of blood, then it was at first. And for this cause belike, Salust. Salvinianus lib. 2. cap. 1. will admit or heare of no blood-letting at all in this Disease, except it bee manifest it proceede from blood, he was as it appeares by his owne words in that place, master of an hospitall of madmen, 
                           Non laudo eos qui in desipientiá, docent secandam esse venam frontis, quia spiritus debilitatur indè, & ego longâ experientiá observaui in proprio Xenecdochio quod desipientes ex phlebotomiâ magis laeduntur, & magis desipiunt, & melancholici saepè fiunt inde peiores.
                         
                        and found by long experience, that this kinde of evacuation either in head, or arme, or any other part, did more harme then good,
                     
                     Purging vpward and downeward, in abundance of bad humors omitted, may be for the worst, so likewise as in the precedent, if it be ouermuch, or too frequent, or violent, it 
                           Vires debilitat.
                         weakeneth their strength, saith Fuschius lib. 2. sec. 2. cap. 17. or if they be strong, or able to endure Physick, yet it brings it to an ill habit, they make their bodies no better then an Apothecaries shop, and this, and such like infirmities must needs follow.
                  
                  
                     SVBSEC. 5. Bad Aire a cause of Melancholy.
                     AIre is a cause of great moment, in producing this or any other Disease, being that it is still taken into our bodies by respiration, and our more inner parts. 
                           Impurus aer spiritus deijcit, infecto corde gignit morbos.
                         
                        If it be impure and foggy, it deiects the spirits, and causeth diseases by infection of the heart, as Paulus hath it lib. 1. cap. 49. Avicenna lib. 1. Gal. de san. tuendâ. Mercurialis, Montaltus &c.

                         hote & dry, or too cold and dry, thick, fuligenous, cloudy, blustering, or a tempestuous Aire. Bodine in his 5. booke de repub. cap. 1. and 5. cap. of his method of history, proues that hote countries are most troubled with melancholy, and that there are therefore in Spaine, and Africke, and Asia minor, great numbers of mad men, in so much that they are compelled in all Cities of note, to build peculiar Hospitals for them. Leo Afer

                        lib. 3. de Fessa vrbe: and Zuinger confirmes as much: and Gordonius will haue every man take notice of it. Note this, saith he, that in hote Countries, it is farre more familiar then in cold. 
                        
                           Lib. Med. parte 2. cap. 19. Intellige quod in calidis regionibus frequenter accidit mania, in frigidis autem tardè.
                         Although this be not alwayes true: for as 
                           Lib. 2. 
                        Acosta truly saith, vnder the Aequator it selfe, is a most temperate habitation, and wholesome Aire, a Paradise of pleasure: the leaues euer greene, cooling showres. But such as are intemperately hote, as 
                           Hodopericum. cap 7. 
                        Iohannes à Meggen, found in Cyprus, others of Malta, and the Holy land, where at some seasons of the yeare, is nothing but sand, their rivers dried vp, and the Aire scorching hote, and Earth: in so much, that many Pilgrims going barefoot for Devotions sake, from Ioppa to Ierusalem vpon the hot sands, often run mad. 
                           Pantheo seu pract. Med. l-b. 1 cap. 16. Venetae mulieres quae diu sub sole vivunt, aliquando melancholicae evadunt.
                         
                        Hercules de Saxoniá a Professor in Venice, giues this cause, why so many Venetian woemen are melancholy, quod diù sub sole degant, they tarry too long in the Sun. Montaenus consil. 21. amongst other causes, assignes this, why that Iew his patient was mad, quod tam multum exposuit se calori & frigori, he exposed himselfe so much to heat & cold. And for that reason in Venice, there is little stirring in those brick-paved streets in Sommer about noone, they are most part then a-sleep: As they are likewise in the great Mogors Countries, and all over the East Indies. At Aden in Arabia, as 
                           Navig. lib. 2. cap. 4. commercia nocte, horí secundâ ob nimios qui saeviunt interdiu aestus exercent.
                         
                        Lodovicus Vertomannus relates in his travels; they keep their markets in the night, to avoide extremity of heat: & in Ormus, like cattle in a Pasture, people of all sorts lye vp to the chinne in water all day long. At Burgos in Porting all, Messina in Sicily, all ouer Spain & Italy, their streets are most narrow, to avoid the Sun beames. The Turkes weare great Tulipantes,

                        ad fugandos solis radios, to refract the Sun beams, & much inconvenience, that hote Aire of Bantam in Iaua yeelds to our men, that sojourne there for traffick, where it is so hote, 
                           Morbo Gallico laborantes exponunt ad solem, vt morbos exsiccent.
                         
                        that those that are sicke of the pox, lye commonly bleaching in the Sun, to dry vp their sores. The hardiest men are offended with this heat, & stiffest clownes cannot resist it, as Constantine affirmes agricult. lib. 2. cap. 45. Those that are naturally borne there, cannot

                         endure it, much lesse weakelings & strangers. Amatus Lusitanus, cent. 1. curat, 45. records of a yong maide, that was one Vincent a curriers Daughter, some 30 yeares of age, that would wash her haire in the heat of the Day, in Iuly, & so let it dry in the Sun 
                           Quum ad solis radios in leone longam moram traheret, vt capillos flavos redderet, in maniam incidit.
                         
                        to make it yellow, but by that meanes tarrying too long in the heat, she inflamed her head, and made herselfe mad.
                     
                     Cold Aire in the other extreme, is almost as bad as hote, and so doth Montaltus esteeme of it cap. 11. if it be dry withall. In those Northerne Countries the people are therefore generally dull, heavy, and many witches, which (as I haue before quoted) Saxo Grammaticus, Olaus, Baptista Porta ascribe to melancholy, But these colder Climes are more subiect to naturall melancholy, not this artificiall, cold and dry: For which cause, my countriman

                        Mercurius Britannicus belike, puts melancholy men to inhabite iust vnder the Pole. the worst of the three is a

                         thick, cloudy, misty, foggy, aire, or such as comes from sennes, moorish grounds, lakes, muckels, draughts, sinkes, where any filthy carcasses or carrion lies, or from whence any stinking fulsome smell comes; Galen, Avicenna, Mercurialis, new & old, hold that such aire is vnholesome, and ingenders melancholy, plagues, and what not? Commonly called Scandarone in Asia minor. 
                        Alexandreta, an hauen towne in the Mediterranean Sea, is much condemned for a bad aire. Littuania, Ditmarshe, Pomptina paludes in Italy, the territories about Pisa, Ferrara, &c. Rumny marsh with vs, the Hundreds in Essex, the Fennes in Lincolneshire. Cardan de rerum varietate lib. 17. cap. 96. findes fault with the site of most of those rich and populous cities in the Low countries, as Bruges, Gant, Amsterdam, Leyden,

Vtrect &c. the aire is bad; and so Stockholne in Sueden, Regium in Italy: our Salesburry and Linne. They may be commodious for navigation; this new kind of fortification, and many other good & necessary vses, but are they so wholesome? Old Rome hath descended from the hils to the valley, and t'is the site of most of our new cities, & held best to build in plaines, to take the oportunity of rivers. Leander Albertus pleads hard for the aire and site of Venice, though the black moorish sands appeare at every low water; the Sea, Fire, and Smoake, as he thinks, qualifyes the aire: and 
                           Atlas Geographicus memoriâ valent Pisani quod crassiore fruantur acre.
                         some think, that a thick foggy aire helpes the Memory, as them of Pisa in Italy; and our Camden out of Plato, commends the site of Cambridge, because it is so neare the Fennes. But let the site of such places be as it may, how can they be excused that haue a delicious seat, a pleasant aire, & al that nature can affoord, & yet through their owne nastinesse & sluttishnesse, & immund sordid maner of life, suffer their aire to putrifie, & themselues to be choaked vp. Many citties in Turkie do malè audire in this kind: Constantinople it selfe, where commonly carrion lies in the street. Some find the same fault in Spaine, euen in Madrit the Kings seat, a most excellent aire, & pleasant site, but the inhabitants are slouens, & the streets vncleanely kept.
                     A troublesome tempestuous Aire is as bad, as impure, rough & foule weather, impetuous windes, cloudy darke dayes, as it is commonly with vs, coelum visu foedum,

                     NOthing so good, but it may be abused: nothing better then Exercise, if oportunely vsed for the preservation of the body: nothing so bad, if it bee vnseasonable or overmuch. Fernelius out of Galen, Path. lib. 1. cap. 16. saith,

Which being so inraged, diuersly affect, and trouble the body and minde: so doth it if it be vnseasonably vsed, vpon a full stomacke, or when the body is full of crudities, which Fuchsius so much inveighs against, lib. 2. instit. sec. 2. cap. 4. giving that for a cause, why boyes in Germany are so often scabbed, because they vse exercise presently after meates.

                         Exclaimes against all such Exercise after meate, as being the greatest enemy to concoction that may be, and cause of corruption of humors, which produce this & many other diseases. Not without good reason then, doth Salust Salvianus lib. 2. cap. 1, and Leonartus Iacchinus in 9. Rhasis, Mercurialis, Arculanus, and many other, set downe 
                           Immodicum exercitium.
                         immoderate exercise, as a most forcible cause of melancholy.
                     Opposite to Exercise is Idlenesse, or want of Exercise, the bane of body and mind, the chiefe author of all mischiefe, ore of the seauen deadly sinnes, & a sole cause of this & many other

maladies, the Divels cushion, as 
                           Hom. 31. in 1. Cor. 6. nam quum mens hominis quiescere non possit, sed continuò circa varias cogitationes discurrat, nisi honesto aliquo negotio occupetur, ad Melancholiam sponte delabitur.
                         
                        Gualter cals it, his pillow, & chiefe reposall. For the mind can neuer rest, but still meditates on some thing or other, except it be occupied about some honest businesse, of his owne accord it rusheth into melancholy.

                        As too much & violent exercise offends on the one side, so doth an idle life on the other (saith Crato) it fils the body full of fleam, grosse humors, & all maner of obstructions, rhumes, catarres &c. Rhasis cont. lib. 1. tract. 9. accompts of it as the greatest cause of Melancholy:

                                 que
                               magis generat Melancholiam, est otiositas.
                         
                        I haue often seene (saith he) that Idlenesse begets this humor more then any thing els. Montaltus cap. 1. seconds him, 
                           Reponitur otium ab aliis causa, & hoc à nobis observatum eos huic malo magis obnoxios qui planè otiosi sunt, quam eos qui aliquo munere versantur exequendo.
                         out of his experience, that those that are idle, are farre more subiect to melancholy, then such as are conversant or emploied about any office or businesse. 
                        
                           De tranquill. animae: sunt quos ipsum otium in animi coniicit aegritudinem.
                         
                        Plutarch reckons vp Idlenes for a sole cause of the sicknes of the Soule: There are those (saith he) troubled in mind, that haue no other cause but this. Homer. Iliad. 1. brings in Achilles eating of his owne heart in his Idlenes, because he might not fight. Mercurialis consil, 86. for a melancholy yong man vrgeth 
                           Nihil est quod aequè Melancholiam alat ac augeat, ac otium & abstinentia à corporis & animi exercitationibus.
                         this as a chiefe cause, why was he Melancholy? because idle. Nothing begets it sooner, encreaseth & continueth it ofter then Idlenesse. A Disease familiar to all Idle persons, an inseparable companion to such as liue at ease, a life out of action, & haue no calling or ordinary employment to busie themselues about. Especially if they haue bin formerly brought vp to businesse, & vpon a sudden come to lead a sedentary life, it crucifies their Soules, & seaseth on them in an instant: And is such a torture, that as wise Seneca well saith, malo mihi malè quam mollitèr esse: I had rather be sick thē idle. This Idlenesse is either of body or mind. That of body is nothing but intermitting Exercise, which if we may beleeue 
                           Path. lib. 1. ca. 17. exercitationis intermissio inertem calorem languidos spiritus & ignavos, & ad omnes actiones segniores reddit cruditates, obstructiones, & excrementorum prouentus facit.
                         
                        Fernelius, causeth crudities, obstructions, excrement all humors,

                        quencheth the naturall heate, dulls the spirits, and makes them vnapt to doe any thing whatsoeuer.

                     As ferne growes in vntill'd grounds, & all maner of weeds, so doe grosse humors in an Idle body, Ignavum corrumpunt otia corpus. A horse in a stable that never travailes, an hawke in a mew that neuer flies, are both subiect to Diseases, which left vnto themselues are most free from any such incumbrances. An idle dog will be maungye, & how shall an idle person thinke to escape? Idlenesse of the minde is much worse then this of the body. 
                           Seneca.
                         
                        Aerugo animi, rubigo ingenij: the rust of the Soule, 
                           Moerorem animi, & maciem Plutarch calls it. a plague, a hell it selfe, maximum animi nocumentum, Galen cals it. 
                           Sicut in stagno generantur vermes, sic & otioso malae cogitationes. Seneca.
                         
                        As in a standing poole, wormes and filthy creepers increase; so doe evill & corrupt thoughts in an idle person. In a commonwealth where there is no publike enemy, there is likely ciuill warres, & they rage vpon themselues: and this body of ours when it is idle, and knowes not how to bestow it selfe, macerates & vexeth it selfe with cares & griefes, & false-feares, suspitions, it tortures and preyes vpon his owne bowels, and is neuer at rest. This much I dare boldly say, that he or she that is Idle, be they of what condition they will, neuer so rich, well allied, fortunate, happy, let them haue all things in abundance, all felicity that heart can wish and desire, all contentment, and so long as he or they are idle, they shall neuer be pleased. Well they may build castles in the aire for a time, and sooth vp themselues with phantasticall humors, but in the end they will proue as bitter as gall, they shal be still discontent, suspitious, 
                           Prov. 18. Pigrum deijciet timor. Heautontimorumenos.
                         fearefull, jelous, sad, fretting, and vexing of themselues: so long as they be idle, it is vnpossible to please them. Otio qui nescit vti, plus habet negotij, quam qui negotium in negotio: as that 
                           Lib. 19. cap. 10 
                        Agellius could obserue. He that knowes not how to spend his time, hath more businesse, care & griefe, anguish of minde, then he that is most busie in the middest of all his businesse: Otiosus animus nescit quid volet: An idle person (as he followes it) knows not when he is well, or what he would haue, or whether

he would goe, quum illuc ventum est, illinc lubet, he is tired out with every thing, displeased with all, aweary of his life: nec benè domi, nec militiae, neither at home, nor abroad, errat, & praeter vitam vivitur, he wanders, and liues besides himselfe.
                     Cosen German to Idlenesse, and a concomitating cause, which goes hand in hand with it, is 
                           Piso, Montaltus, Mercurialis. &c.
                         
                        nimia solitudo, too much solitarinesse, by the testimony of all Physitians, Cause and Symptome both: but as it is heere put for a cause, it is either coact, enforced, or els voluntary. Enforced Solitarinesse is commonly seene in students, Monkes, Friers, Anchorites, that by their order and course of life, must abandon all company, and society of other men, and betake themselues to a private life; Such as liue in prison, or in some desert place, and cannot haue company, as many of our countrey Gentlemen doe in solitary houses, they must either be alone without company, or liue beyond their meanes, and entertaine al commers, as so many hostes, or els converse with their seruants and hindes, such as are vnequall, inferior to them, and of a contrary disposition; or els as some doe, to avoide solitarinesse, spend their time in alehouses, & addict themselues to some vnlawfull disports, or dissolute courses. Some againe are cast vpon this rocke of solitarinesse for want of meanes, or out of a strong apprehension of some infirmity, disgrace, or through bashfulnesse, rudenesse, simplicity, they cannot apply themselues to others companie. This inforced solitarinesse takes place, and produceth this effect soonest in such as haue spent their time Iovially peradventure in all honest, recreations, in all good company, & are vpon a sudden confined, & restrained of their liberty, and barred from their ordinary associates: solitarinesse is very irkesome to such, most tedious, and a sudden cause of great inconvenience.
                     Voluntary solitarinesse is that which is familiar with Melancholy, and gently brings on as a Siren, a shooing-horne, or some Sphinx to this irrevocable gulfe, 
                           Aquibus malum, velut à primariâ causâ occasionem nact
                                 •
                              
                              est.
                         a primary cause Piso cals it, most pleasant it is at first to such as are Melancholy

giuen, to walke alone in some solitary groue, betwixt wood and water, by some brooke side, and to meditate vpon some delightsome and pleasant subiect, which shall affect him most, amabilis insania, and mentis gratissimus error. A most incomparable delight to build castels in the aire, to goe smiling to themselues, acting an infinite variety of parts, which they suppose, and strongly imagine they act, or that they see done. Blandae quidem ab initio, saith Lemnius, to conceiue and meditate of such pleasant things somtimes, 
                           Iucunda rerum praesentium, praeteritarum, & futurarum meditatio.
                         
                        present, past, or to come, as Rhasis speakes. So delightsome these toyes are at first, they could spend whole dayes and nights without sleep, euen whole yeares in such contemplations, and phantasticall meditations, which are like so many dreames, and will hardly be drawne from them, winding and vnwinding themselues as so many clocks, and still pleasing their humors, vntill at the last the Sceane turnes vpon a sudden, and they being now habitated to such meditations and solitary places, can indure no company, can thinke of nothing but harsh and distastefull subiects: Feare, sorow, suspition, substructicus pudor, discontent, cares, and wearinesse of life, surprise them on a sudden, and they can thinke of nothing els: continually suspecting, no sooner are their eyes open, but this infernall plague of melancholy seaseth on them, and terrifies their soules, representing some dismall obiect to their mindes, which now by no meanes, no labour, no perswasions they can avoide, haeret laters lethalis arundo, they cannot be rid of it, 
                           Facilis descensus Averni: Sed revocare gradum, superas

                               evadere ad auras Hic labor, hoc opus est. Virg. they cannot resist. I may not deny but that there is some profitable Meditation, Contemplation, and kinde of Solitarinesse to be embraced, which the Fathers so highly commend, 
                           Hieronymus dixit oppida & vrbes videri sibi tetros carceres, solitudo Paradisus, solum scorpionibus infectum, saccho amictus, humi cubans, aquâ & herbis victitans, Romanis praetulit delitijs.
                         
                        Hierome, Chrysostome, Cyprian, Austin, in whole Tracts, which Petrarch, Erasmus, Stella, and others so much magnify in their bookes, a Paradise, a Heauen on earth, if it be vsed aright, good for the body and the Soule: As many of those old Monkes vsed it, to diuine contemplations, as Similus a courtier in Adrians time, Dioclesian the Emperour retired themselues &c. Or the bettering of their knowledge, as

                        Democritus, Cleanthes, and all those excellent Philosophers haue euer done, to sequester themselues from the tumultuous world, or as Plinies villa Lauretana, Tullies Tusculane, Iovius study, that they might better vacare studijs & Deo, serue God, and follow their studies. These men are neither solitary, nor idle, as the Poët made answere to the husbandman in Aesop, that obiected Idlenesse to him: he was neuer so idle, as in his company: or that Scipio Africanus in 
                           Offic. 3. 
                        Tully, nunquam minus solus, quam quum solus; nunquam minus otiosus, quam quum esset otiosus: neuer lesse solitary then when he was alone, never more busy then when he seemed to bee most idle. But it is farre otherwise with these men, they are diuels alone, as the saying is, homo solus aut Deus, aut daemon: a man alone is either a Saint, or a divell, and 
                           Eccles. 4. 
                        vae soli in this sense, woe be to him that is alone. These men degenerat from men, and from sociable creatures, become beasts, monsters, inhumane, vgly to behold, Misanthropi: they do euen lothe themselues, & hate the company of men, as so many Timons, Nebuchadnessars: by too much indulging to these pleasing humors, and through their owne default. So that which Mercurialis consil. 11. sometimes expostulated with his Melancholy patient, may be iustly applyed to every solitary & idle person in particular. 
                           Naturae de te videtur conqueri posse, quod cum ab eâ temperatissimum corpus adeptus sis, tam praeclaerum á Deo ac vtile donum non contempsisti modò, verum corrupisti, faedasti, prodidisti, optimam temperaeturam otio, crapula & aliis vitae erroribus &c.
                         
                        Natura de te videtur conqueri posse &c. Nature may iustly complaine of thee, that whereas shee gaue thee a good holesome temperature, a sound body, and God hath giuen thee so divine and excellent a soule, so many good parts, and profitable gifts, thou hast not onely contemned and reiected them, but hast corrupted them, polluted them, ouerthrowne thy temperature, and perverted those gifts with riot, idlenesse, solitarinesse, and many other wayes, thou art a traitor to God and Nature, an enemy to thy selfe and to the world. Perditio tua ex te: thou thy selfe art the efficient cause of thine own misery, by not resisting such vaine cogitations, but giuing way vnto them.

                     WHat I haue formerly said of Exercise, I may now repeat of Sleepe. Nothing better then moderate Sleep, nothing worse then it, if it be in extreames, or vnseasonably vsed. It is a receiued opinion, that a Melancholy man cannot sleep over-much, Somnus supra modum prodest, it is an onely Antidote, and nothing offends them more, or causeth this malady sooner, then Waking: yet in some cases Sleepe may doe more harme then good, in that slegmatick, swinish, and sluggish Melancholy, that Melancthon speakes of, that thinks of waters, sighing most part &c.

To our imagination commeth by the outward sense or memory, some obiect to be knowne (residing in the former part of the Braine) which he misconceauing or amplifying, presently communicates to the Heart, the Seat of all affections. The purer spirits forthwith flock from the braine to the Heart, by certaine secret channels, and signify what good or bad obiect was presented, 
                           Beeles. 13. 26. The Heart alters the countenance to good or evill, and distractiō of the minde causeth distēperature of the Body. which immediatly bends it selfe to prosecute, or avoid it; and withall draweth with it other humors to helpe it: so in pleasure concurre great store of purer spirits, in sadnes much melancholy blood, in ire, choller. If the Imagination be very apprehensiue, intent, and violent, it sends great store of spirits to or from the Heart, and makes a deeper impression, and greater tumult, as the humours in the body bee likewise prepared, and the temperature it selfe ill or well disposed, the passions are longer and stronger. So that the first steppe and fountaine of all our grieuances in this kinde, is

                     VVHat Imagination is, I haue sufficiently declared in my Digression of the Anatomy of the Soule. I will only now point at the wonderfull effects and power of it; which as it is eminent in al, so most especially it rageth in melancholy persons in keeping the species of obiects so long, mistaking, amplifying them by continuall and strong

Metalog. lib. 4. cap. 10. meditation, vntill at the length it produceth reall effects, and causeth this and many other maladies. And although this Phantasie of ours be a subordinate faculty to reason, and should

be ruled by it, yet in many men, through inward or outward distemperatures, defect of organs, which are vnapt or hindred, or otherwise contaminated, it is likewise vnapt, hindred and hurt. This we see verified in sleepers, which by reason of abundance of humors and concurse of vapours troubling the Phantasie, imagine many times absurd and prodigious things, and in such as are troubled with Incubus, or witch ridden, as we call it, if they lie on their backs, they suppose an old woman rides them, and fits so hard vpon them, that they are almost stifled for want of breath; when there is nothing but a concourse of bad humours, which trouble the Phantasie. This is likewise evident in such as walke in the night in their sleep, and doe strange feats: 
                           Scalig. exercit.
                         these vapours moue the Phantasie, the Phantasie the Appetite, which mouing the animall spirits, causeth the body to walke vp and downe, as if they were awake. Fracastorius lib. 3. de intellect. referres all Extasies to this force of Imagination, such as lye whole daies together in a Traunce; as that Priest whom

                        Avicenna speakes of one that could cast himselfe into a palsie when hee list, and some can imitate the tunes of Birds and Beasts, that they can hardly be discerned. Dagobertus and Sr

                        Agrippa supposeth to haue happened by force of Imagination: that some are turned to Wolues, from Men to Women, and Women againe to Men (which is constantly beleeued) to the same Imagination; or from Men to Asses, Dogges, or any other shapes.

                           Agrippa lib. 1. cap. 64. that melancholy men, and sicke men conceaue so many phantasticall visions, apparitions to themselues, and haue so many absurd suppositions, as that they are Kings, Lords, Cocks, Beares, Apes, Owles, that they are heavy, light, transparent, great and little, sencelesse and dead (as shall bee shewed more at large in our 
                           Sect. 3. memb. 1. subsect. 3. Sections of Symptomes) can be imputed to naught else but to a corrupt and false Imagination. It works not in sicke and melancholy men only, but even most forcibly sometimes in such as are found, it makes them suddainely sicke, and 
                           Malleus malefic. fol. 77. corpus mutari potest in diversas aegritudines ex forti apprehensione.
                         alters their temperature in an instant. And sometimes a strong apprehension, as

Men if they see but another man tremble, giddy, or sicke of some fearefull disease, their apprehension and feare is so strong in this kinde, that they will haue the same disease. Or if by some Southsayer, wise-man, fortuneteller, or Physition, they be told they shall haue such a disease they will so seriously apprehend it, that they will instantly labour of it. A thing familiar in China, saith Riccius the Iesuite, 
                           Expedit in Sinas l. 1. c. 9. tantum porro multi praedictoribus hisce tribuunt, vt ipse metus fidem faciat, nam si praedictum ijs fuerit ta

                        If it be told them they shall be sicke on such a day, when that day comes they will surely be sicke, and will be so terribly afflicted, that sometimes they dye vpon it. D. Cotta in his discouery

of ignorant practitioners of Physicke cap. 8. hath two strange stories to this purpose, what fancy is able to doe: The one of a Parsons wife in Northamptonshiere, Ao 1607. that comming to a Physition, and told by him that she was troubled with the Sciatica, as he coniectured (a disease shee was free from) the same night after her returne, vpon his words fell into a grieuous fit of the Sciatica. And such another example he hath of another goodwife, that was so troubled with the cramp, after the same maner she came by it, because her Physition did but name it. Sometimes death it selfe is caused by force of phantasie. I haue heard of one that comming by chance in company of him, that was thought to be sicke of the Plague (which was not so) fell downe suddainely dead. Another was sick of the Plague with conceit. One seeing another let blood, falls downe in a sowne. Another, saith 
                           Subtil. 18. 
                        Cardan out of Aristotle, fell downe dead (which is familiar to women at any gastly sight) seeing but a man hanged. A Iew in France, saith 
                           Lib. 3. de animá cap. de me-
                         
                        Lodovicus Vives, came by chance over a dangerous passage, or plancke, that lay over a Brooke in the darke, without harme, the next day seeing what danger hee was in, fell downe dead. Many will not beleeue such stories to be true, but laugh commonly at them, when they heare of them; but let these men consider with themselues, as 
                           Lib de Peste.
                         
                        Peter Byarus illustrates it, if they were set to walke vp on a plancke on high, they would be giddy, vpon which they dare secure walk vpon the ground. Many, saith Agrippa, 
                        
                           Lib. 1. cap. 63. Ex alto despicientes aliqui prae timore contremiscunt, caligant, infirmātur sic singultus, febres, morbi comitiales quando

                                 que
                               recedunt.
                         
                        strong hearted men otherwise, tremble at such sights, dazell and are sicke if they looke but downe from an high place, and what moues them but conceit? As some are so molested by Phantasie, so some again by Fancy alone, & a good conceit, are as easily recouered. We see commonly the Tooth-ache, Gout, Falling-sicknesse, biting of a mad Dog, and many such maladies, cured by Spells, Words, Characters, and Charmes, and many greene wounds magnetically cured, which Goclenius in a booke of late hath defended. All the world knowes there is no vertue in such Charmes, but a strong conceit and opinion alone, as 
                           Lib de Incantatione. Imaginatio subitum humorum & spirituum motum infert, vnde vario affectu rapitur sanguis, ac vna morbificas causas partibus affectis eripit.
                         
                        Pomponatius
                        
holds, which forceth a motion of the humors, spirits, and blood, which takes away the cause of the malady from the parts affected. The like we say of all our magicall effects, superstitious cures, and such as are done by Mountebanks & Wisards. An Empiricke many times, and a silly Chirurgeon, doth more strange cures then a rationall Physition. Nymannus giues a reason, because the patient puts his cōfidence in him, 
                           Aegri persuasio & fiducia, omni arti & cō

So diversly doth this phantasie of ours affect, turne & winde, so imperiously command our bodies, which as another Proteus or a Camelion can take all shapes; and is of such force, as Ficinus addes, that it can worke vpon others as well as our selues. How can otherwise bleare eyes in one man cause the like affection in another? Why doth one mans

                         One mans pissing provoke a second many times to doe the like? Why doth scraping of trenchers offend a third, or hacking of files, &c. Why doth a carcasse bleed when the murtherer is brought before it, some weekes after the murther hath beene done? Why doe Witches and old women fascinate and bewitch children, but as Wierus, Paracelsus, Cardan, Mizaldus, Valleriola, and many Philosophers thinke, the forcible Imagination of the one party, moues and alters the spirits of the other.

I haue thus farre digressed because this Imagination is the medium deferens of passions, by whose meanes they worke and produce many times prodigious effects; and as the phantasie

is more or lesse intended or remitted, and their humors disposed, so doe perturbations moue more or lesse, and take deeper impressions.

                        Vives to good and bad. If good it is present, and then we absolutely ioy and loue, or to come, and then we desire, and hope for it. If evill we absolutly hate it; if present it is Sorrow, if to come, Feare. These 4. passions

Some few discreet men there are, that can gouerne themselues, and curb in these inordinate affections, by religion, Philosophy, & such divine precepts, of meeknesse, patience, and the like: but most part for want of gouernment, out of indiscreation, ignorance, they suffer themselues wholy to be led by sense, & are so far from repressing rebellious inclinations, that they giue all encouragement vnto them, leauing the raines, and vsing all provocations to further them: bad by nature, worse by art, discipline,

                        That subiects himselfe to feare, desire, griefe, ambition, shame, is not happy, but altogether miserable, tortured with continuall labour, care, and misery. And it is as forcible a batterer as any of the rest:

                        Many men contemne the tumults of the world, and care not for glory, and yet they are afraid of infamy, repulse, disgrace, (Tul. offic, lib. 1.) they can severely contemne pleasure, beare griefe indifferently, but they are quite battered and broken with reproach & obloquy. And are so deiected many times for some publike iniury, disgrace, as a boxe on the eare by their inferiour, to be ouercome of their aduersary, foiled in the field, to be out in a speech, or some fowle fact, &c that they dare not come abroad all their liues after, but melancholize in corners, and keepe in holes.

His whole life is Sorrow, and euery word he speakes a Satyre, nothing fattes him but other mens ruines. For to speake in a word, Envy is nothing els but Tristitia de bonis alienis, sorrow for other mens good, be it present, past, or to come: & gaudium de adversis, &

                        I haue read, saith Marcus Aurelius, Greeke, Hebrew, Chaldie authors, I haue consulted with many wise men, for a remedy for envy, I could finde none, but to renounce all happinesse, and to be a wretch and miserable for euer. T'is the beginning of Hell in this life, and a passion not to be excused.

Divine and humane examples are very familiar, you may run and read them, as that of Saul and David, Cain and Abel, angebat illum non proprium peccatum, sed fratris prosperitas, saith Theodoret, it was his brothers good fortune gauled him.

Hatred stirres vp contention, Prov. 10.12. and they breake out at last into immortall enmity, virulency, and more then Vatinian hate and rage, to persecute one another, their friends and followers, and all their posterity, with bitter taunts, and hostile warres, scurrile invectiues, libels, calumnies, fire and sword, and the like, and will not be reconciled.

This hatred, malice, faction, and desire of revenge, invented first all those racks and wheeles, strappadoes, brasen bulles, severall engins, prisons, Inquisitions, seuere lawes to macerate and torment one another. How happy might we be, and end our time with blessed dayes, and sweet content, if we could containe our selues, and as we ought to do, put vp iniuries, learne humility, meeknesse, patience, forget and forgiue, as in

                        Paul would haue vs, then of our selues: be of like affection one towards another, and not avenge our selues, but haue peace with all men. But being that we are so peevish and perverse, so factious and seditious, so malicious, envious: we doe invicem angariare, maule and vexe one another, and torture, and disquiet our selues, precipitate our selues into that gulfe of woes and cares, and aggravate our misery, and melancholy, and heape vpon vs hell and eternall damnation.

                        Arateus sets it downe for an especiall cause, and so doth Senecae ep. 18. lib. 1. of this malady. 
                           Reg. sanit. parte 2 cap 8. in apertam insaniam mox ducitur iratios.
                         
                        Magninus giues the reason, ex frequenti irá supra modum calefiunt, it ouer-heates their bodies, and if it be ouer-frequent, it breakes out into manifest madnesse, saith Ambrose. T'is a knowne saying, furor fit laesâ saepiùs patientia, the most patient spirit that is, if he be often provoked, will be incensed to madnesse, it will make a divell of a Saint. And therefore Basil belike in his Homily de Irâe, cals it tenebras rationis, morbum animae, & daemonem pessimi

                        Lucian in Abdicato To. 1, will haue this passion to worke this effect of madnesse, especially in old men and women, anger and calumny (saith he) trouble them at first, and after a while breake out into open madnesse: many things cause fury in women, especially if they loue or hate ouermuch, or envy, or be much grieued,

or angry, these things by little and little lead them on to this malady. From a disposition, to an habit, for there is no difference betwixt a mad man, and an angry man, in the time of his fit: Anger, as Lactantius describes it lib. de Irâ Dei ad Donatum, cap. 5. is 
                           Saeva animi tempestas tantos excitans fluctus, ut statim ardescant oculi, os tremat, lingua titubet, dentes concrepan

                        saeua animi tempestas &c. making his eyes sparke fire, and stare, his teeth gnash in his head, his toung stutter, his face pale, or red, and what more filthy imitation can be in a mad man. They are voide of reason, inexorable, blinde, and like 
                           ora tument irâ, servescunt sagui ne venae, lumina Gorgonio saevius angue micant. Ovid.
                         beasts and monsters for the time, say and doe they know not what, curse, sweare, raile, fight, and what not? what can a mad man doe more? as he said in the comedy, 
                           Terence.
                         
                        Iracundiâ non sum apud me. If these fits be immoderate, or continue long, or frequēt, without doubt they prouoke madnes. Montanus consil. 21. had a melancholy Iew to his patient, he ascribes this for a principall cause, Irascebatur leuibus de causis, he was easily moued to anger. Aiax had no other cause of his madnesse; and Charles the 6. that Lunaticke French King, fell into this misery, out of the extremity of this passion, and desire of revenge and malice, 
                           Infensus Britannie Duci, & in vltionem versus, nec cibum cepit, nec quietem , ad Calendas Iulias 1392. comites occidit &c.
                         incensed against the Duke of Britaine, he could neither eate, drinke, nor sleepe for some dayes together, and in the end about the Calends of Iuly 1392. he ranne mad vpon his horse back, drawing his sword, and striking all came neare him promiscuously, and so continued all his life. Aemil. lib. 10. gall. hist. Aegesippus de excid. vrbis Hieros. lib. 1. cap. 37. hath such a story of Herod, that out of an angry fit, became mad, and

In hote cholerick bodies, nothing so soone causeth madnesse, as this passion of Anger, besides many other diseases, as Pelesius obserues cap. 21. lib. 1. de hum. affect. causis.

                     DIscontents, cares, crosses, miseries, or whatsoeuer it is, that shall cause any molestation of spirits, griefe, anguish and perplexity, may well be reduced to this head, (preposterously placed heere in some mens Iudgments they may seeme) yet in that Aristotle in his 
                           Lib. 2. Invidia est dolor & ambitio est dolor &c.
                         
                        Rhetoricke defines these cares, as he doth envy, emulation &c. still by griefe, I thinke I may well ranke them in this Irascible row; being that they are as the rest, both causes and symptomes of this Disease; & cause the like inconveniences, and are still accompanied with anguish and griefe. Dementes curae, insomnes curae, damnosae cura, tristes, mordaces, carnifices &c. biting, eating, gnawing, cruell, bitter, sicke, sad, vnquiet, pale, tetricke, miserable, intolerable cares, as the

                         Poets call them, worldly cares, and are as many in number as the Sea sands.

                        Galen, Fernelius, Faelix, Platter, Valescus de Taranta &c. reckon afflictions, miseries, and all these contentions and vexations of the minde, as principall causes, in that they take away sleepe, hinder concoction, drye vp the body, and consume the substance of it. They are not so many in number, but their causes be as diverse, and not one of a thousand free from them, or that can vindicate himselfe, whom that Ate dea, Homers goddesse Ate, hath not involued into this discontented ranke, or plagued with some

misery or other. A generall cause, a continuate cause, an inseparable accident to all men, is discontent, care, misery; were there no other particular affliction (which who is free from?) to molest a man in this life, the very cogitation of that

                         common misery, were enough to macerate him, and make him aweary of his life: to thinke that he can neuer be secure, but still in danger, sorrow, griefe, and persecution. For to begin at the first houre of his birth, as

                        whining at the very first, he is swadled and bound vp like a prisoner, and cannot helpe himselfe, and so he continues to his liues end. No estate, age, sexe, can secure himselfe from this common misery. A man that is borne of a woman, is of short continuance, and full of trouble, Iob 14.1. & vers. 22. and while his flesh is vpon him, he shall be sorrowfull, and while his soule is in him, it shall mourne.

                     THese Concupiscible and Irascible Appetites, are as the two twists of a rope, mutually mixt one with the other, and both involving and twining about the Hart: both good, as Austin holds lib. 14. cap. 9. de civit. Dei: 
                        
                           Bonae si rectam rationem sequuntur, malae si exorbitant.
                         
                        if they be moderate, both pernitious if they be exorbitant. And this concupiscible Appetite, howsoeuer it may seeme to carry with it a shew of pleasure and delight, and our concupiscences most part affect vs with content, & a pleasing obiect, yet if they be in extreames, they rack and wring vs on the other side.

I knowe there be some men that are of opinion that couetous men are happy, and worldly wise, onely wise, and that there is more pleasure in getting of wealth then in spending, and that there is no pleasure in the world like vnto it. What is it trowe you that makes a poore man labour all his life time, carry such great burdens, fare so hardly, macerate himselfe, and endure so much misery, vndergoe such base offices with so great patience, to rise vp early and ly downe late, if there were not an extraordinary delight in getting and keeping of this mony?

What makes them goe into the bowels of the earth, an hundreth fadome deepe, endangering their dearest liues, enduring damps & filthy smels, when they haue enough already if they could be content, and no such cause to labour, but an extraordinary delight they take in riches?

meane time such a man that shall molest their game, more seuerely then him that is otherwise a common hacker, or a notorious theafe. But great men are some waies to be excused, the meaner sort haue no evasiō why they should not be counted madde. Podgius the Florentine tells a merry story to this purpose, condemning the folly and impertinent busines of such kinde of men. A Physition of Millan, saith he, that cured mad men had a pit of water in his house, in which he kept his patients some vp to the knees, some to the girdle, some to the chinne, pro modo in saniae, as they were more or lesse affected. One of them by chance that was well recouered, stood in the doore, and seeing a gallant ride by with an Hauke on his fist, wel mounted, and his Spaniels after him, would needs know of him to what vse all this preparation serued; hee made answere to kill certaine fowle: the patient demanded againe what his fowle might be worth which he killed in a yeare, he replied 3 or 4 Crownes; & when he vrged him farther, what his Dogs, Horse and Haukes stood him in, hee told him 100 Crownes: with that the patient bad him be gone as he loued his life and welfare, for if our master come and find thee here, he will put thee in the pit amongst mad-men vp to the chin: Taxing the madnesse and folly of such vaine men that spend themselues in such idle sports, neglecting their businesse and necessary affaires.

But if hee had good sport, and had beene well pleased on the other side, incredibili munificentiâ, with vnspeakable bounty he would reward all

Another kinde of mad men there is opposite to these that are insensibly madde, and knowe not of it, such as contemne all praise and glory, and thinke themselues most free; when as indeed they are most mad: calcant sed alio fastu: a company of Cynicks, such as are Monkes, Hermites, Anachorites, that contemne the world, contemne themselues, contemne all titles, honors, offices: & yet in that contempt, are more proud then any man liuing whatsoever. They are proud of humility proud in that they are not proud, saepe homo de vanae gloriae contemptu, vaniùs gloriatur, as Austin hath it, confess. lib. 10. cap. 38. as Diogenes, intus gloriantur, they bragge inwardly, & feed themselues fat with a selfe conceit of sanctity, which is no better then Hypocrisie: they goe in sheeps russet many great men, that might maintaine themselues in cloath of gold and seeme to be deiected, humble by their ordinary gesture and apparell, much mortified in their outward carriage, whē as inwardly they are swolne full of pride, arrogancy, & selfeconceipt. And therefore Seneca adviseth his frend Lucilius,

                        leaue them that plague, which in time will consume all their vigour, and martiall spirits. The

                        Turkes abdicated Cornutus the next heire from the Empire, because hee was so much giuen to his booke, and t'is the common Tenet of the world, that learning dulls and diminisheth the spirits, and so per consiquens produceth Melancholy.
                     Two main reasons may be given of it, why studēts should be more subiect to this malady then others. The one is they liue a sedentary, solitary life, sibi & musis, free from bodily exercise, and those ordinary disports which other men vse: & many times if discontent and Idlenesse concurre with it, they are precipitated into this gulfe on a sudden: but the commō cause is ouermuch study, too much learning, as Acts 26.24. 
                        Fesius told Paul, hath made thee madde; t'is that other extreame which effects it. So did Trincavellius lib. 1. consil. 12. & 13. finde by his experience in two of his patients, a yong Baron, and another, that contracted this malady by too vehement study. So Forestus obseruat. lib. 10. observ. 13. in a yong divine in Lovain, that was mad, & said 
                           Nimijs studijs melancholicus evasit, dicens se Bibliam in capite habere.
                         
                        he had a Bible in his head. Marcilius Ficinus de sanit. tuendâ. lib. 1. cap. 1.3.4. & lib, 2. cap, 16. giues many reasons,
                           Cur Melancholiâ assiduâ, crebris

                               deliramentis vexentur corum animi, vt desipere cogantur.
                         
                        why students dote more often then others: The first is their negligence: 
                           Solers quilibet artisex instrumenta sua diligentissimè curat, pencillos pictor, malleos iucundes
                                 
                                    
                                 
                                 que
                               faber ferrarius, miles equos, arma
                                 •
                              venator auceps, aues & canes, Cytheram cytharedus &c. soli musarum myste tam negligentes sunt, vt instrumentum illud quo mundum vniversum metiri solent, spiritum scilicet penitus negligere videantur.
                         
                        other workemen looke to their tooles, a Painter will wash his pencils, a Smith will looke to his hammer, anvil, forge: an husbandman will mend his plow-irons, and grinde his hatchet if it be dull, a faukoner or huntsman will haue an especiall care of his haukes, hounds, horses, dogges &c.

a musitian will string and vnstring his lute &c. onely Schollers neglect that instrument, their braine and spirits I meane, which they dayly vse, and by which they range ouer all the world, which by much study is consumed. Vide saith Luciā, ne funiculum nimis intendendo, aliquando abrumpas: thou twist not the rope so hard, till at length it

                         breake. Ficinus in his 4. c. giues some other reasons, Saturne and Mercury the Patrons of Learning, are both dry Planets: and 
                           Ephaenter.
                         
                        Origanus giues that same cause, why Mercurialists are so poore, & most part beggers because their praesident Mercury had no better fortune himselfe, he can helpe them to knowledge, but not to money. The second is contemplation, 
                           Contemplatio cerebrum exsiccat, & extinguit calorem naturalē vnde cerebrum frigidum & siccum evadit quod est melancbolicum. Accedit ad hoc, quod natura in contemplatione cerebro prorsus cordi
                                 
                                    
                                 
                                 que
                               intenta, stomachum, hepar
                                 
                                    
                                 
                                 que
                               destituit, vnde ex alimentis male coctis, sanguis crassus & niger efficitur, dum nimio otio membrorum superflui vapores non exhalant.
                         
                        which dries the braine, and extinguisheth naturall heat; for whilst the spirits are intent to meditation about in the head, the stomacke and litter are left destitute, and thence comes black blood, & crudities, for want of concoction, & for want of exercise, the superfluous vapors cannot exhale &c. The same reasons are repeated by Gomesius lib. 4. cap. 1. de sale.
                        
                           Cerebrum exsiccatur, corpora sensim gracilescunt.

                         crudities, opilations, vertigo, windes, crampes, consumptions, and all such diseases as come by ouer-much sitting; they are commonly leane, dry, ill coloured, spend their fortunes, loose their wits, and many times their liues, and all through immoderate paines, and extraordinary studies. If you will not beleeue the truth of this, looke vpon great Tostatus, and Thomas Aquinas workes, & tell me whether those men tooke paines? peruse Austin, Ierome &c. and many thousands besides.

                                 que

Heare Tully pro Archia poeta. whilst other loytered, & tooke their pleasures, he was continually at his booke: and so they doe that will be Schollers, and that to the hazard I say, of their health, fortunes, wits, and liues. How much did Aristotle and Ptolomy spend? how many crownes per annum, to perfect Arts, the one about his history of creatures, the other about his Almagest? how many poore Schollers haue lost their wits, or become dizardes, neglecting all worldly affaires, and their owne health, wealth, esse, and bené esse to gaine knowledge? for which after all their paines, in the worlds esteeme they are accompted ridiculous, and silly fooles, Idiots, Asses and (as oft they are) reiected, contemned, and derided, doting, mad.

how to manage their domesticke or publike affaires. Paglarensis was amased, and said his farmer had surely cosened him, when he heard him tell that his sow had eleuen pigs, & his Asse but one foule.

But our patrons of learning are so farre now-a-dayes, from respecting the Muses, and giuing that honour to Schollers, and reward which they deserue, and are allowed by these indulgent priviledges of many noble Princes, that after all their paines taken in the Vniversities, coste & charge, expences, irksome houres, laborious taskes, and wearisome dayes,, dangers, hazards, barred interim from all pleasures, which other men haue, mewed vp like haukes all their liues, if they chance to wade through them, they shall in the end be reiected and contemned, and which is their greatest misery, driuen to their shifts, exposed to want, pouerty and beggery.

take paines; they are either seduced by bad companions, vel in puellam impingunt, vel in poculum, and so spend their times to their friends griefe, and their own vndoings.

It may be, their temperature will not endure it, but in striving to be excellent, to know all, they loose health, wealth, wit, life and all.

And this was the common practice of Poland, as Cromerus obserued not long since, in the first book of his History, their Vniversities were generally base, not a Philosopher, a Mathematitian, an Antiquary &c. to be found of any note amongst them, because they had no set reward or stipend, but every man betook himselfe to Divinity, hoc solum in votis habens opimum sacerdotium, a good Personage was their aime. Euen so is it with vs, to get an office in some Bishops court, to practise in some good Towne, or a Benefice is the marke we shoot at, as being only advantageous,

the high-way to preferment.
                     Although many times, for ought I can see, these men faile as often as the rest in their proiects, and are as vsually frustrated of their hopes. For let him be a Doctor of the Law, an excellent Civilian of good worth, where shall he practise and expatiate? their fields are so scant, and the Civill Law with vs so contracted with prohibitions, so few causes, by reason of those all-devouring municipall Lawes, quibus nihil illiteratius, saith

Now for Physitians, there are in every Village so many Mountibanks, Empiricks, Quacsalvers, Paracelsians as they call themselues, Wisards, Alcumists, poore Vicars, cast Apothecaries and Physitians men, Barbers, and Goodwiues that professe great skill, that I know not how they shal maintaine themselues, or who shall be their Patients. Besides, there are so many of both sorts, and some of them such Harpies, and so covetous, so clamorous, and so impudent; as

If you will not beleue me heare a brief of it, as it was not many yeares since, publikely preached at Pauls crosse, Io. Howson 4o Novembris 1597. the sermon was printed by Arnold Hartfield. by a graue Minister then, and now reverend Bishop of this land. We that are bred vp in Learning, and destinated by our Parents to this end, we suffer our childhood in the Grammer schoole, which Austin cals magnam tyrannidem, & grave malum, and compares it to the torments of martyrdome, when we come to the Vniversity, if we liue of the Colledge allowance, as Phalaris obiected to the Leontines,

If by this price of the expence of our time, our bodies and spirits, our substance and patrimonies, we cannot purchase those small rewards, which are ours by Law, and the right of inheritance, a poore Personage, or a Vicarage of 50 per annum, but we must pay to the Patron for the lease of a life (a spent and outworne life) either in annuall pension, or aboue the rate of a copy hold, and that with the hazard and losse of our soules, by Simony and periury, and the forfeiture of all our spirituall preferments, in esse and posse, both present and to come, what father after a while will be so improvident, to bring vp his son to his great charge, to this necessary beggery? What Christian will be so irreligious, to bring vp his son in that course of life, which by all probability and necessity, cogit ad turpia, enforcing to sin, will entangle him in simony and periury! when as the Poet saith, Invitatus ad haec aliquis de ponte negabit: a beggars brat taken from the bridge where he sits a-begging, if he knew the inconvenience, had cause

to refuse it. This being thus, haue not we fished faire all this while, that are initiated divines, to finde no better fruits of our labours,

I say againe, Frange leves calamos, & scinde Thalia libellos; let's turne souldiers, teare our books, or turne them into gunnes and pikes, leaue all, and betake our selues to any other course of life, then to continue longer in this misery.
                     
                        Yea but me thinkes I heare some man except at this which I haue said, that though this be true which is said of the estate of Schollers, & especially of divines, that it is miserable and distressed at this time, and that the Church suffers shipwrack of her goods, & that they haue iust cause to complain; there is a fault, but whence ptoceeds it? if the cause were iustly examined, it would be retorted vpon our selues, if wee were cited at that Tribunall of Truth, we should be found guilty, and not able to excuse it. That there is a fault amongst vs, I confesse, and were there not a buyer, there would not be a seller, but to him that will consider better of it, it will more then manifestly appeare,

                         that the fountaine of these miseries proceeds from these griping Patrons. In accusing them, I doe not altogether excuse vs, both are faulty, they and we: yet in my iudgment, theirs is the greater fault, more apparant causes, and more to be condemned. For my part, if it be not with me as I would, or as it should, I doe ascribe the cause as Cardan did in the like case, meo infortunio potiùs quam illorum sceleri, to I had no money, I wanted impudence, I could not scamble, temporise, dissemble: non pranderet olus &c.

For the rest t'is on both sides, facinus detestandum, to buy and sell liuings, to detaine from the Church that which Gods and mens Lawes haue bestowed on it, but in them most, and that from the covetousnesse and ignorance of such as are interrested in this businesse, I name covetousnesse in the first place, as the root of all these mischiefes, which Achan-like compels them to commit sacriledge, and to make Simoniacal compacts, & what not to their owne ends,

But when they contemne Learning, & think themselues sufficiently qualified, if they can write & read, or scamble at a piece of Evidence, or haue so much Latin as that Emperor had,He that cannot dissemble, cannot liue.

If the Patron be precise, so must his Chaplaine be, or if he be Papisticall, he must be so too, or else bee turned out. And these are those Clearkes which serue the turne, and whom they commonly entertaine, and present to Church liuings, whilst in the meane time wee that are Vniversity men, like so many hide-bound Calues in a pasture, tarry out our time, & wither away as a flower vngathered in a garden, and never vsed: or as so many candles illuminate our selues alone, obscuring one anothers light, and are not discerned here at all, the least of which translated to some darke roome, or to some country benefice, where it might shine apart, would giue a faire light, and be seene over all. whilst we lye waiting here as they did at the poole of Siloa, till the Angell stirred the water, expecting a good houre, they step betweene and beguile vs of our preferment. I haue not yet said. If after long expectation and much and earnest fuit of our selues and friends, we obtaine a small benefice at last: our misery begins a fresh, we light vpon a crackt title, or stand in feare of some precedent Lapse, or some litigious people, that will not pay their dues without much repining, or compelled by long suit; all they thinke well gotten that is had from the Church, and by such vncivill, harsh dealings, they make their poore Minister a weary of his place, if not of his life: and put case they bee quiet honest men, make the best of it, as often it falls out, hee

must turne rusticke, and dayly converse with a company of Idiots and Clownes.

Many of these Accidentall causes, which I shall intreat of here, might haue well beene reduced to the former, because they cannot be avoided, but fatally happen to vs though accidentally, and at vnawares, at some time or other: the rest are contingent and inevitable, and more properly inserted in this rancke of causes.

Giraldus Cambrensis Itinerar. Cambriae. lib. 1. cap. 2. confirmes this by a notable example which happened in his time. A sow pigge by chance sucked a Brach, and when she was growne,

Cato for that reason would make his servants children sucke vpon his wiues breast, because by that meanes they would loue him and his the better, and in al likelyhood agree with them. A more evident example that the minds are altered by milke, cannot be giuen then that of Dion which

And that of Tiberius who was a common drunkard, because his Nurse was such a one. Et si delira fuerit (

For bodily sicknesse there is no doubt to be made. Titus, Vespatianus son was therefore sickly because his Nurse was so, Lampridius. And if we may beleeue Physitions, many times children catch the pox from a good Nurse. Botaldus c. 61. de lue vener.

                         for these causes Phauorinus, and Marcus Aurelius would not haue a child put to nurse at al, but every mother to bring vp her own, of what condition soever she be. Which some women most curiously obserue, & amongst the rest,

But she was too iealous, if it be so, as many times it is, they must be put forth, I would then advise such mothers as

Aurelius plead how they can against it, I had rather accept of her then the mother her selfe. For why may not the mother be a whore, a peevish drunken flurt, a waspish cholerick slut, a crased peece, a foole (as many mothers are) as soone as the Nurse? There is more choice of Nurses then Mothers; and therefore except the mother bee most vertuous, staid, & a woman of excellent good parts, & of a sound cōplection, I would haue all children in such cases committed to strangers. And t'is the only way; as by marriages they are engrafted to other families to alter the breed, or if any thing bee amisse

in the mother as Lodovicus Mercatus contends, Tom. 2 lib. de morb. haered. to prevent diseases and future maladies, to correct and qualifie the childs ill disposed temperature, which he had from his parents. This is an excellent remedy, if good choice be made of such a Nurse.

                        Iason Pratensis, puts this of Education for a principall cause, bad parents, step-mothers, Tutors, Masters, Teachers, too rigorous and too severe, or too remisse or indulgent on the other side, are often fountaines and furtherers of this disease. Parents and such as haue the tuition and oversight of children, offend many times in that they are too sterne, alway threatning, chiding, brawling, whipping, or striking; by meanes of which their poore children are so disheartned & cowed that they never after haue any courage, or a merry houre in their liues, or take pleasure in any thing. There is a great moderation to be had in such things, as matters of so great moment, to the making or marring of a child. Some fright their children with beggars, bugbeares, and hobgoblins if they cry, or be otherwise vnruly, but they are much too blame in it, many times saith Lavater de spectris, part. 1. cap. 5. ex metu in morbos graves incidunt, & noctu dormientes clamant, for feare they fall into many diseases, and cry out in their sleep, and are much the worse for it all their liues: these things ought not at all, or to be sparingly done, and vpon iust occasion. Tyrannicall, impatient, harebraine Schoolemasters, are in this kind as bad as hangmen and executioners, they make many children endure a martyrdome all the while they are at Schoole, with bad diet, if they boord in their houses, and too

much severity and ill vsage, they quite pervert their temperature of body and mind: still chiding, railing, frowning, lashing, tasking, keeping, that they are fracti animis moped many times, and aweary of their liues, and thinke no slavery in the world (as once I did my selfe) like to that of a grammer Scholler. S. Austin in his first booke of his confess. and 4. c. calls this schooling meticulosam necessitatem, And elsewhere a martyrdome, and confesseth of himselfe, how cruelly he was tortured in mind for learning Greeke, nulla verba noveram, & saevis terroribus & paenis, vt nossem instabatur mihi vehementer, I knew nothing and with cruel terrors and punishments I was dayly compeld.

And for these causes Plutarch in his booke de lib. educ. and Hierom epist. lib. 2 epist. 17. to Laeta de institut. filiae, giues a most especiall charge to al parents, and many good cautions about the bringing vp of children, that they be not committed to vndiscreet, passionate, bedlā tutors, light, giddy headed, or covetous persons, and spare for no cost, that they may bee well nurtured and taught, it being a matter of so great consequence.

In Sacai another city, the same earthquake was so terrible vnto them, that many were bereft of their sences; & others by that horrible spectacle so much amased, that they knew not what they did.

Princes and Potentates, that are otherwise happy, and haue all at command, are grievously vexed with these pasquilling libels, and Satyrs: the Caesars themselues in Rome, were commonly taunted. Adrian the sixt Pope,

The Prophet David replies, Psal. 123.4. that his soule was full of the mocking of the wealthy, and of the despitefulnesse of the proud, and Psal. 55.4. for the voice of the wicked &c. and their hate, his heart trembled within him, and the terrors of death came vpon him.

                        Apuleius once aday, or els they shal be melancholy themselues, they care not how they grinde and misuse others, so they may exhilerate themselues. Leo Decimus that scoffing Pope, as Iovius hath registred in the 4. book of his life, took an extraordinary delight in humoring of silly fellowes, and to put gulleries vpon them, 
                           Laudando & mira ijs persuadendo.
                         
                        by commending some, perswading others to this or that; he made ex stolidis stultissimos, & maximè ridiculos, ex stultis insanos: he made soft fellowes starke noddies, and such as were foolish, quite mad before he left them. One memorable example he recites there of Tarascomus of Parma a Musitian, that was so humoured by Leo Decimus, and Bibiena his second in that busines, that he thought himself to be a man of most excellent skill, (who was indeed a ninny) they a 
                        made him set foolish songs, and invent new ridiculous precepts, which they did highly commend, as to tye his arme that plaid on the lute, to make him strike a sweeter stroke, 
                           Et vanâ instatus opinione, incredibilia ac ridenda quaedam Musices praecepta commentaretur &c.
                         
                        and to pull downe the Arras hangings, because the voice would be clearer, by reason of the reverberation of the wall. In like manner they persuaded one Baraballius of Caieta, that he was as good a Poët as Petrarch, and would haue him to be made a Laureat Poët, 
                           Vt voces nudis parietibus illisae suavius ac acutius resilirent.
                         & invite all his friends to his installment, and had so possessed the poore man with a conceipt of his excellent poëtry, that when some of his more discreet friends told him of his folly, he was very angry with them, and told them, 
                           Immortalitati & gloriae suae prorsus invidentes.
                         
                        they envied his honour and prosperity. It was strange, saith Iovius, to see an old man of 60 yeares, a venerable and graue old man, so gulled.

But what cannot such scoffers do, especially if they find a soft creature on whom they may worke: nay to say truth, who is so wise, or so discreet, that may not be humoured in this kind, especially if some excellent wits shall set vpon him; he that maddes others, if he were so humoured, would be as mad himselfe, as much grieued and tormented. For all is in these things as they are taken, if he be a silly soule, and do not perceiue it, it is wel, he may hapily make others sport, & be no whit trobled himself; but if he be apprehensiue of his folly, & take it to hart, thē it torments him worse thē any lash: a bitter jest, a slander, a calumny pierceth deeper then any losse, danger, bodily pain, or iniury whatsoeuer. Especially if it shall proceed from a virulent tongue, it cuts, saith Dauid, like a two edged sword. And they smote with their tongues, Ier. 18.18. and that so hard, that they leaue an incurable wound behind them. Many men are vndone by this means, moped, and so deiected, that they are neuer to be recovered; and of all other men living, those which are actually melancholy, or inclined to it, are most sensible (as being suspitious, cholerick, and apt to mistake) and impatient of an iniury in that kind, they aggravate it, and so meditate continually of it, that it is a perpetuall corsiue, not to be recovered, till time weare it out. And although they peradventure that so scoffe, doe it alone in mirth and merriment, and hold it, optimum alienâ frui insanià, an excellent thing to inioy another mans madnes; yet they must know, that it is a mortall sin, as 2.2. 
                              d ae quaest. 75. Irrisio mortale peccatum.

                        David denounceth, they that vse it, shall never dwell in Gods Tabernacle. Such scurrile iests, flouts, and Sarcasmes, therefore ought not at all to be vsed; especially to such as are in misery, or any way distressed: for to such arumnarum incrementa sunt, as

For that cause, al those that otherwise approue of jests in some cases, will by no means admit them in their companies, that are any way inclined to this malady, non iocandum

Though they haue all things convenient, sumptuous houses to their vse, faire walkes and gardens, delicious boures, galleries, good fare & diet, and all things correspondent: yet they are not content, because they are confined, & may not come and goe at their

And what misery doe they endure that liue vnder those hard task-masters, in gold-mines, tin-mines, lead-mines, stone-quarries, cole-pits, like so many mouldewarpes vnder ground, condemned to the gallies, to perpetual drudgery, hunger, thirst, and stripes, without all hope of deliuery? How are these womē in Turkie affected, that most part of the yeare come not abroad, and those Italian and Spanish dames that are mewed vp like hawkes, & locked vp by their jelous husbands? how tedious is it to them that liue in stoues and caues halfe a yeare together; as in Island, Muscovy, or vnder the If there be any inhabitants Pole it selfe, where they haue six moneths perpetuall night. Nay, what misery and discontent doe they endure, that are in prison, they want all those six non-naturall things at once, good aire, good diet, exercise, company, sleep, rest, ease, &c. that are bound in chaines all day long, suffer hunger, and as

They lye nastily amongst todes and frogs in a darke dungeon, in their own dung, in pain of body, in pain of soule: as Ioseph did.

They liue solitary alone, sequestred from all company, but heart-eating melancholy, and for want of meat, must prey vpon themselues. Well might

Montanus consil. 232. make mention of a country woman, that parting with her friends and natiue place, became grieuously melancholy for many yeares; and Trallianus of another so caused for the absence of her husband. If parting of friends alone can worke such violent effects, what shall death doe, when they must eternally be separated, never here to meet again? This is so grievous a tormēt for the time, that it takes away all appetite, desire of life, and extinguisheth all delights, it causeth deep sighes and groanes, teares, exclamations, howling, roaring, and many bitter pangs, and by frequent meditation extends so far sometimes,

Praetextatus a robed Gentleman in Plutarch would not sit downe at a feast because he might not sit highest, but went his waies all in a chase. We see the common quarrellings that are ordinary amongst vs for taking of the wall, precedency and the like, which though they be toyes in themselues, and things of no moment, yet they cause much hartburning amongst vs. Nothing perceth deeper then a contempt or disgrace,

Of the same nature is oppression, Eccles. 7.7. surely oppression makes a man mad. Banishment a great misery as Tyrteus describes it, in an Epigram of his.

                     SVBSEC. 1. Continent, inward, antecedent, next causes, and how the body workes on the minde.
                     AS a purly hunter, I haue hitherto beaten about the circuit of the forrest of this Microcosme, & haue followed only those outward adventitious causes; I will now breake into the inner roomes, and rip vp the antecedent immediate causes which are there to be found. For as the distraction of the mind, amongst other outward causes and perturbations, alters the temperature of the Body, so the distraction & distemperature of the Body, will cause a distemperature of the Soule, and t'is hard to decide which of these two doe more harme to the other. Plato, Cyprian, and some others, as I haue formerly said, lay the greatest fault on the Soule, excusing the Body, others again accusing the Body, excuse the Soule, as a principall Agent. Their reasons are, because 
                           Mores sequū
                              tur temperaturā corporis.
                         
                        the manners doe follow the Temperature of the Body, as Galen proues in his book of that subiect, Prosper Calenius de Atrâ bile, Iason Pratensis cap. de Maniâ, Lemnius lib. 4. cap. 16. and many others. And that which Gualter hath commented hom. 10. in epist. Iohannis is most true, concupiscence and originall sinne, inclinations, and bad humors are 
                           Scintillae latent in corpore.
                         radicall in every one of vs, and cause these perturbations, affections, and severall distempers, offering many times violence vnto the Soule. Euery man is tempted by his own concupiscence, Iames 1.14. and the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weake, and rebelleth against the spirit, as our 
                           Gal. 5. 
                        Apostle teacheth vs: that me thinks the Soule hath the better plea against the body, which so forcibly inclines vs, that we cannot resist, Nec nos obniti contra, nec tendere tantū Sufficimus. How the Body being materiall, worketh vpon the immateriall Soule, by mediation of humors & spirits, which participate of both, ill disposed organs, Cornelius Agrippa

                         Heart, humors, spirits: as they are purer, or impurer, so is the Mind, and equally suffers, as a lute out of rune, if one string, or one organ be distempered, all the rest miscary, corpus onustum externis vitijs, animum quo

We see this in old men, children, Europeans, Asians, hote and cold Climes; Sanguine are merry, Melancholy sad, Phlegmatick dull, by reason of abundance of such humors, and they cannot resist such passions as are infflicted by them.

Only this I will adde, that such melancholy as shall be caused by such infirmities, deserues to be pittied of all men, and to be respected with a more tender compassion, according to Laurentius, as comming from a more inevitable cause.

                        Monavius in an epistle of his to Crato in Scoltzius, is of opinion, that Hypocondriacall

Melancholy may proceed from a cold Liuer, the question is there discussed. Most agree that a hote Liuer is in fault,

                        The Stomacke, and Meseriacke veines doe often concurre, by reason of their obstructions, and thence their heat cannot be avoided, & many times the matter is so adust, and inflamed in these parts, that it degenerates into Hypocondriacall melancholy.

                        Montaltus cap. 10. de causis melan. will haue the efficient cause of melancholy to be hote and dry, not a cold & dry distemperature, as some hold, from the heate of the Braine, rosting the blood, and immoderate heate of the liuer and bowels, and inflammation of the Pylorus. And so much the rather, because that as Galen holds all spices inflame the blood, solitarinesse, waking, agues, study, meditation, all which heate; and therefore he concludes that this distemperature causing melancholy, is not colde and dry, but hote and dry. But of this I haue sufficiently treated

in the matter of Melancholy, and hold that this may be true in non-naturall Melancholy, which produceth madnes, but not in that naturall, which is more cold, and being immoderate, produceth a more gentle dotage.

                     SVBSEC. 3. Causes of head Melancholy.
                     AFter a tedious discourse of the generall causes of Melancholy, I am now returned at last to treat in briefe of the three particular Species, and such causes as properly appertain vnto them. And although these causes promiscuously concurre to each and every particular kind, and commonly produce their effects in that part which is most weake, ill disposed, and least able to resist, and so cause all three species; yet many of them are proper to some one kind, and seldome found in the rest. As for example, Head melancholy is commonly caused by a cold or hote distemperature of the Brain, Laurentius cap. 5. de melan. Salust. Salvianus before mentioned lib. 2. cap. 1. de re med. will haue it proceed from cold: but that I take of naturall melancholy, and such as are fooles & dote; for as Galen writes lib. 4. de puls. 8. and Avicenna, 
                        
                           A fatuitate inseparabilis cerebri frigiditas.
                         
                        a cold and moist Braine is an vnseparable companion of folly. But this adventitious melancholy which is here meant, is caused of an hote and dry distemperature, as 
                           Ab interno calore assatur.
                         
                        Damascen the Arabian, lib. 3. cap. 22. thinkes, and most writers. Altomarus and Piso call it 
                           Intemperies innata exurens, slavam bilem ac sanguinem in melancholiam convertens.
                         
                        an innate burning vntemperatnesse, turning blood and choler into melancholy. Both these opinions may stand good, as Bruel maintaines, and Capivaccius, si cerebrum sit calidius, 
                        
                           Si cerebrum sit calidius, fiet spiritus animalis calidior, & delirium maniacum si frigidior fier fatuitas.
                         
                        if the Braine be hote, the animall spirits will be hote, and thence comes madnesse: if cold, folly. Dauid Crusius Theatro morb. Hermet. lib. 2. cap. 6. de atrâ bile, grants melancholy to be a disease of an inflamed Brain, but cold, notwithstāding of it selfe: calida per accidens, frigida per se, hote by accident

onely. I am of Capivaccius mind for my part. Now this humor according to Salvianus, is sometime in the substance of the Braine, sometimes contained in the Membranes and tunicles that couer the Braine, sometimes in the passages of the Ventricles of the Braine, or veines of those Ventricles. It followes many times 
                           Melancholia capitis accedit post phrenesim aut longam moram sub sole, aut percussionem in capite. cap. 23. lib. 1.

                     SVBSECT. 4. Causes of Hypocondriacall or windy Melancholy.
                     IN repeating of these causes, I must crambě bis coctam opponere, say that againe which I haue formerly said, in applying them to their proper Species: of Hypocondriacall or flatuous

melancholy, which the Arabians call Myrachiall, & is in my iudgement the most grievous and frequent, though Bruel and Laurentius make it least dangerous, & not so hard to be knowne. His causes are inwarde or outwarde. Inward from diverse parts or organes, as midriffe, spleene, stomacke, liver, pylorus, wombe, diaphragma, meseriacke veines, stopping of Issues, &c. Montaltus, cap. 15. forth of Galen recites 
                           Exuritur sanguis & venae obstruuntur quibus obstructis prohibetur transitus Chyliad iecur, corrumpitur & in rugitus & flatus vertitur.
                         
                        heate and obstruction of those meseriack veines, as an immediate cause, by which meanes the passage of the Chylus to the liver is detained, stopped or corrupted, and turned into rumbling and winde. Montanus consil. 233. hath an evident demonstration Trincavellius, lib. 1. cap. 12. and Plater obseruat, lib. 1. for a Doctor of the Law visited with this infirmity, from the said obstruction and heate of these Meseriacke veines, and bowels: quoniam inter ventriculū & iecur venae effervescūt. The veines are inflamed about the liver and stomacke. Sometimes those other parts are togither misaffected, and concurre to the production of this malady. A hote liver and colde stomacke or colde belly: looke for instances in Hollerius, Victor Trincavelius, consil. 35. lib. 3. Hildesheim Spicel. 2. fol. 132. Solenander consil. 9. pro cive Lugdunensi, Montanus consil. 229. for the earle of Monfort in Germany. 1549. & Frisimelica in the 233. consultation of the said Montanus. I. Caesar Claudinus giues instance of a cold stomacke and overhote liver, almost in every consultation, consult. 89. for a certaine Count, and consult. 106. for a Polonian Baron, by reason of heate the blood is inflamed, and grosse vapors sent to the Hart and braine. Mercurialis subscribes to them, consil. 86.

                        the stomacke being misaffected, &c. which he cals king of the belly, because if hee be distempered, all the rest suffer with him, as being deprived of their nutriment, or fed with bad nourishment, by meanes of which, come crudities, obstructions, winde, rumbling, griping, &c. Hercules de Saxoniâ besides heate, will haue the weakenesse of the liver & his obstruction a cause, facultatem debilem iecinoris, which he 
                           Cap. 12. cals the minerall of melancholy. Laurentius assignes this reason, because the liver overhote

drawes the meate vndigested out of the stomacke, and burneth the humors. Montanus col. 244. proues that sometimes a colde liver may be a cause. Laurentius, cap. 12. and Trincavelius, lib. 12. consil. and Gualter Bruel seemes to lay the greatest fault vpon the Spleene, that doth not his duty in purging the liver as he ought, being to great or to little, in drawing too much blood sometimes to it, and not expelling it, as P. Cnemiandrus in a 
                           Hildesheim.
                         consultation of his noted, tumorem lienis he names it, and the fountaine of melancholy. Diocles supposed the ground of this kinde of melancholy, to proceede from the inflamation of the pylorus, which is the nether mouth of the Ventricle. Others assigne the Mesenterium or midriffe distempered by heate, the wombe misaffected, stopping of of hemrods, with many others. All which Laurentius, cap. 12. reduceth to three, Mesentery, liver and Spleene, from whence he denominates Hepaticke, Spleniticke, and Meseriacke Melancholy.
                     Outward causes, are bad diet, care, griefes, discontents, & in a word al those 6. non-natural things, as Montanus found by his experience, consil. 244. Solenander consil, 9. for a citizen of Lyons in France giues his reader to vnderstande, that hee knew this mischiefe procured by a medicine of Cantharides, which an vnskilfull Physition gaue vnto his patient to drinke ad venerem excitandam. But most commonly feare, griefe, and some sudden commotion, or perturbation of the minde beginnes it, in such bodies especially as are ill disposed. Melancthon. tract. 14. cap. 2. de animâ, wil haue it as common to men, as the mother to women, vpon some grievous trouble dislike, or discontent, Montanus consil. 22. pro delirante Iudaeo confirmes it,

                         grievous symptomes of minde brought him to it. Randoletius relates of himselfe, that being one day very intent to write out a Physitions notes, molested by an odde occasion, he fell into an hypocondriacall fit, to avoide which he dranke the decoction of wormewood, & was freed.

                        Melancthon, (being the disease is so troublesome and frequent) holdes it a most necessary and profitable study, for every man to

                     AS before, the cause of this kind of melancholy is inward or outward. Inward,

                        when the liver is apt to ingender such an humor, or the Spleene weake by nature and not able to discharge his office. A melancholy temperature, retention of haemrods, monthly issues, bleeding at nose, long diseases, agues, and all those sixe non-naturall things. But especially 
                           Melancholiam quae sit à redundantia humoris in toto corpore victus imprimis generat qui cum humorem parit.
                         bad diet as Piso thinks, as pulse, salt meate, shell-fish, cheese blacke wine &c. Mercurialis out of Averroes and Avicenna condemnes all hearbs. Galen. lib. 3. de loc. affec. cap. 7. especially cabbage. So likewise feare, sorrow, discontents, &c: but of these before.
                     You haue had at last the generall and particular causes of melancholy: now go & bragge of thy present happines whosoever thou art, bragge of thy temperature, and of thy good parts, insult, triumph, and boast? thou seest in what a brittle state thou art, how soone thou mai'st be deiected, how many severall waies, by bad diet, bad aire, a small losse, a little sorrow, or discontent, an ague, &c: how many sudden accidents may procure thy ruine, what a small tenure of happynes thou hast in this life, how weake & silly a creature thou art. Humble thy selfe therefore vnder the mighty hand of God. 1. Pet. 5.6. know thyselfe, acknowledge thy present misery, & make right vse of it, qui stat videat ne cadat. Thou dost now florish & hast bona animi, corporis, & fortunae, goods of body, mind, and fortune, nescis quid serus secum vesper ferat, thou knowest notwhat stormes & tempests the late evening may bring with it. Be not secure, be sober and watch,

                     Symptomes are either

                         Vniversall or particular, saith Gordonius, lib. med. cap. 19, part. 2. to persons, to species, some signes are secret, some manifest, some in the Body, some in the minde, & diversly vary, according to the inward or outward causes, Capivaccius. or from starres according to Iovianus Pontanus, de reb. coelest. lib. 10. cap. 13. and celestiall influences or are from the humors diversly mixt, Ficinus, lib. 1. cap. 4. de san. tuēdà: as it is hote, cold, naturall, vnnaturall, intended or remitted, so will Aetius haue melancholica deliria multiformia, diversity of melancholy signes. Laurentius ascribes thē to their several temperatures, delightes, natures, inclinations, continuance of time, as they are simple or mixt with other Diseases, as the causes are divers, so must the signes be & almost infinite, Altomarus, cap. 7. art. med. And as wine producet diverse effects, or that herbe Tortocolla in 
                           Lib. 1. de risu Fol. 17. Ad eius esum alij sudant alij vomūt, flent, bibunt, saltant, alij rident, tremunt, dormiunt, &c.
                         
                        Laurentius, which makes some laugh, some weepe, some sleepe, some dance, some sing, some howle, some drinke, &c. So doth this our melancholy humour, worke severall signes in severall parties.
                     But to confine them, these generall symptomes may bee reduced to those of the Body or of the Minde. Those vsuall signes appearing in the Bodies of such as are melancholy bee these, cold and dry, or they are hote and drye, as the humour is more or lesse adust. And from 
                           T. Bright c. 20 these first qualities arise many other second, as that of

If they see one possessed, bewitch't, or an Epileptick Paroxisme, a man shaking with the palsy, or giddy-headed, reeling, or standing in a dangerous place &c. for many dayes after it runs in their mindes, they are afraid they shal be so too, they are in the like danger, as Perkins cap. 12. sec. 2. well obserues in his Cases of conscience. And many times by Imagination they produce it. They cannot endure to see any terrible object, as a Monster, a man executed, a carcase, or heare the diuell named, or any Tragicall relation, but they quake for feare, hecates somniare sibi videntur, Lucian. they dreame of hobgoblins, and cannot get it out of their mindes a long time after: they applie all they see, heare, read, to themselues; as

But this and all precedent symptomes are more or lesse apparant, as the humor is intēded or remitted, hardly perceaued in some or not at all, most manifest in others. Besides these, to speake in a word, there is nothing so vaine, absurd, ridiculous, extravagant, impossible, incredible, so monstrous a Chymera, so prodigious and strange,

                     SOme men haue peculiar Symptomes, according to their temperament and Crisis, which they haue from the Stars

and those celestiall influences, variety of wits and dispositions, as Anthony Zara contends, Anat. ingen. sect. 1. memb. 11.12.13.14. plurimum irritant influentiae caelestes, vnde cientur animi aegritudines & morbi corporum.

Ptolomeus in his centiloquy, or Hermes, or whosoever else the author of that Tract, attributes all these symptomes which are in melancholy men to celestiall influences: which opinion Mercurialis de affect. lib, 1. cap. 10. reiects; but as I say,

                        Iovianus Pontanus, and others stiffely defend. That some are solitary, dull; heavy, churlish, some againe blith, buxome, light, and merry, they ascribe wholy to the starres. As if Saturne be predominate in his nativity, and cause Melancholy in his temperature, then 
                           J. de Indagine Goclenius.
                         he shall bee very austere, sullen, churlish, blacke of colour, profound in his cogitations, full of cares, miseries, and discontents, sad & fearefull alwaies silent, solitary, still delighting in husbandry, in Woods, Orchards, Gardens, Rivers, Ponds, Pooles, darke walkes and close: Cogitationes sunt velle aedificare, velle arbores plantare, agros colere, &c. Catch Birds, Fishes, &c. and still contriuing and meditating of such matters. If Iupiter domineirs, they are more ambitious, still meditating of kingdomes, magistracies, offices, honors, or that they are Princes, Potentates, and how they would carry themselues, &c. If Mars they are all for warres, braue combats, Monomachies, testy, cholericke, harebraine, rash, furious, and violent in their actions. They wil faine themselues Victors, Commanders, are passionate & satyricall in their speeches, great braggers, ruddy of colour. If the Sunne they will bee Lords, Emperours, in conceipt at least, and Monarchs, giue Offices, Honours, &c. If Venus, they are still courting of their mistresses and most apt to loue, amorously giuen, they seeme to heare musicke, plaies, see fine pictures, dancers, merriments, and the like. Ever in

loue, and dote on all they see. Mercurialists are solitary, much in contemplation, subtile, Poets, Philosophers, & musing most part about such matters. If the Moone haue a hand they are all for perigrinatiōs, sea voiages, much affected with travels, to discourse, read, meditate of such things; wandering in their thoughts, divers, much delighted in waters, to fish, fowle. &c.
                     But the most immediate Symptomes proceed from the Temperature it selfe, and the Organicall parts, as Head, Liver, Spleene, Mes

                     If it be naturall Melancholy, as T. Bright. cap. 16. hath largely described, either of the Spleene, or of the veines falty by excesse of quantity, or thicknesse of substance, it is a cold and dry humour, as Montanus affirmes consil. 26. and the parties are sad, timorous, and fearefull. Prosper Calenus in his booke de atrâ bile will haue them to be more stupid then ordinary, cold, heavy, dull, solitary, sluggish, Simultam atram bilem & frigidam habent. Hercules de Saxonia cap. 16. lib. 7.

                        will haue these that are naturally melancholy, to be of a leaden colour or blacke, and so will Guianerius cap. 3. tract. 15. and such as thinke themselues dead many times if it be in excesse. These Symptomes vary according to the mixture of the other humours not adust, or the mixture of those foure humours adust, which is vnnaturall Melancholy. For as Trallianus hath written cap. 16. lib. 7. 
                        
                           Non vna melancholiae causae est nec vnus humor vitij parens sed plures & alius aliter mutatus vnde non omnes eadē sentiunt symptomata.
                         
                        There is not one cause of this melancholy, nor one humour which begets it, but divers diversly intermixt, from whence proceeds this variety of Symptomes.
                        
And those varying againe as they are hot or cold. 
                           Humor frigidus delirij causa, humor calidus furoris.
                         
                        Cold melancholy (saith Benedic. Vittorius Faventinus pract. mag.) is a cause of dotage, and more mild symptomes, if hot or more adust, of more violent passions, and furies. Fracastorius lib. 2. de Intellect, will haue vs to consider well of it,

rest, and haue their eyes still fixed on the ground. Such a patient had Hercules de Saxonia, a widdowe in Venice, that was fat and very sleepy still, and Christophorus à Vega another affected in the same sort. If it be inveterate or violent the symptomes are more evident, they plainely dote and are ridiculous to others, in all their gestures, actions, speeches.

They are much inclined to laughter, witty and merry, conceipted in discourse, pleasant, if they bee not farre gone, much giuen to musicke, dancing, and to bee in womens company.

                        Aristotle, liuing at Abidos a towne of Asia minor, that would sit after the same fashion as if he had beene vpon a stage, and sometimes act himselfe, sometimes clap his hands, and laugh as if hee had beene well pleased with the sight. Wolfius relates of a country fellowe called Brunsellius, subiect to this humour,

Such a one was old Sophocles, and Democritus himselfe had hilare delirium, much in this vaine. Laurentius cap. 3. de melan. thinkes this kind of melancholy,
                           Insania laeta.
                         which is a little adust with some mixture of blood to be that

which Aristotle meant, when he said melancholy men of all others are most witty, which causeth many times a divine ravishment, and a kind of Enthusiasmus, which stirreth them vp to be excellent Philosophers, Poets, Prophets, &c.

In their fits you shall heare them speake all maner of languages, Hebrew, Greeke & Latin, that neuer were taught or knew them before. Apponensis in com. in 1. Prob. sec. 30. speakes of a mad woman that spake excellent good Latin; and Rhasis knew another, that could prophecy in her fit, and foretell things truly to come.

                        Guianerius had a patient could make Latin verses when the Moone was combust, otherwise illiterate. Avicenna and some of his adherents will haue these symptomes, when they happen, to proceed from the diuell, and that they are rather daemoniaci, possessed, then mad or melancholy, or both together, as Iason Pratensis thinks; Immiscent se mali genij &c. but most ascribe it to the humour, which opinion Montaltus cap. 21. stiffly maintaines, confuting Avicenna and the rest, referring it wholly to the quality and disposition of the humour & subiect. Cardan de rerum var. lib. 8. cap. 10. holds these men of all other fitte to be Assacinats, bold, hardy, fierce and adventerous, to vndertake any thing by reason of this choler adust.

                        This humor saith he, prepares them to endure death it selfe, and all maner of torments with invincible courage, and t'is a wonder to see with what alacrity they will vndergoe such tortures, vt supra naturam res videatur: he ascribes this generosity, fury, or rather stupidity, to this adustion of choller and

melancholy: but I take these rather to be mad or desperat, thē properly melancholy: for commonly this humor so adust & hote, degenerates into madnesse.
                     If it come from melancholy it selfe adust, those men, saith Avicenna,
                              Tales plus caeteris timent, & continuè tristantur, valde suspitiosi, solitudinem diligunt corruptissimas babent imaginationes, &c.

humors, the symptomes are likewise mixt. One thinkes himselfe a giant, another a dwarfe; one is heavy as lead, another is light as a fether. Marcellus Donatus lib. 2. cap. 41. makes mention out of Seneca, of one Seneccio a rich man,

wise and discreet, and would talke sensibly, saue only in this. A gentleman in Limosingen, saith Anthony Verdeur, was perswaded he had but one leg, affrighted by a wilde boare, that by chance strooke him on the leg: he could not be perswaded his leg was sound (in all other things well) vntill two Franciscans by chance comming that way, fully remoued him from that conceipt.

If an ambitious man become melancholy, he forthwith thinks he is a King, an Emperour, a Monarch, & walkes alone, pleasing himself with a vain hope of some future preferments, or present as he supposeth, and withall acts a Lords part, and takes it vpon him, some statesman or magnifico, and makes congies, giues intertainment, lookes big, &c.

                         A Schollers mind is busied about his studies, he applaudes himselfe for that he hath done, or hopes to doe, one while fearing to be out in his next exercise, another while contemning all censures, envies one, emulates another, or els with indefatigable paines and meditation, consumes himselfe. So of the rest, all which vary according to the more remisse, and violent impression of the obiect, or as the humor it selfe is intended or remitted. For some are so gently melancholy, that in all their carriage, and to the outward apprehension of others, it can hardly, be discerned, and yet to them an intolerable burden, and not to be indured.

Some dote in one thing, and are most childish, ridiculous, and to be wondred at in that, and yet for all other matters, most discreet & wise. To some it is in disposition, to another in habit; and as they of heat and cold, we may say of this humor, one is melancholicus ad octo, a second two degrees lesse, a third halfe way.

A third is moved vpon all such troublesome obiects, crosse fortune, disaster and violent passions, otherwise free, once troubled in three or foure yeares. A fourth, if things be to his mind, or be in action, is most jocund, and of a good complexion: if idle, caried away wholly with pleasant dreames and phantasies, but if once crossed & displeased, his countenance is altered on a sudden, and his heart, heavy, irksome thoughts crucifie his soule, & in an instant he is aweary of his life. A fift complaines in his youth, a sixt in his middle age, the last in his old age.

                        Rhasis the Arabian makes three degrees of them. The first is, falsa cogitatio, false conceipts, and idle thoughts; the second is, falso cogitata loqui, to talke to themselues, and vtter their minds & conceipts of their hearts by their words;

                        but when he begins to act it likewise, and to put his fopperies in execution, he is then in the extent of melancholy, or madnes it selfe. This progresse of Melancholy you shall easily obserue in them that haue bin so affected, they go smiling to themselues at first, at length they laugh out; at first solitary, at last they can indure no company: or if they doe, they are now dizards, past sence and shame, quite moped, they care not what they say or doe, their whole actions, words, gestures, are furious or ridiculous. At first his mind is troubled, he doth not attend what is said, if you tell him a tale, he cries at last, what said you? but in the end he mutters to himselfe, as old women doe many times, or old men when

they sit alone, vpon a sudden they whoop and hollow, or run away, and sweare they see or heare players,

of all such ordinary signes, which occurre amongst writers, not that they are all to be found in one man, for that were to paint a Monster, a Chimera, not a man, but some in one, some in another, and that successiuely, or at severall times.
                     Which I haue bin the more curious to expresse and report; not to vpbraid any miserable mā, or by way of derision, I rather pity thē, but the better to discerne thē, to apply remedies vnto them, & to shew that the best & soundest of vs all is in danger, how much we ought to feare our own fickle estates, and remember our miseries and vanities, examine & humiliate our selues, & seek to God, & call to him for mercy, that needs not seeke for any rods to scourge our soules, since we carry them in our bowels, & that our soules are in a miserable captivity, if the light of grace & heauenly truth, doth not shine continually vpon vs: & by our discretion to moderate our selues, to be more circumspect and wary in the midst of these dangers.

                        IF no symptomes appeare about the Stomacke, nor the blood be misaffected, and feare and sorrow continue, it is to be thought the Braine it selfe is troubled, by reason of a melancholy iuyce bred in it, or other wayes conveyed into it, and that euill iuyce is from the distemperature of the part, or left after some inflammation. Thus far Piso. But this is not alwayes true: for blood & hypocondries both are often affected, euen in head melancholy. The common signes if it be by essence in the head, are ruddinesse of face, high sanguine complexion, most part rubore saturato,

                        If it proceed from drinesse of the Brain, then their heads will be light, vertiginous, and they most apt to wake, and to continue whole moneths together without sleep. Few excrements in their eyes & nostrils, and often bauld by reason of excesse of drinesse. Montaltus cap. 17. If it proceed from moisture, dulnes, drowsines, headache followes; and as Salust. Salvianus cap. 1. lib. 2. out of his own experience found, Epilepticall, with a multitude of humors in the head. They are very bashfull, if ruddy, and apt to blush, and to be red vpon all occasions, praesertim si metus accesserit. But the chiefest symptome to discerne this species, as I haue said, is this, that there be no notable signes in the Stomack, or elswhere, digna as 
                           Si nulla digna laesio ventriculo, quoniam in hâc melancholiâ capitis exigua nonnunquā ventriculi pathemata coeunt, duo enim haec membra sibi invicem affectionem transmitt unt.
                         
                        Montaltus termes them, or of greater note, because oftentimes the passions of the stomack concurre with them. Wind is common to all three species, and is not excluded, only that of the Hypocondries is

The symptomes of the mind are superfluous, and continuall cogitations:

Trallianus relates a story of a woman that imagined she had swallowed an Eele or a serpent; & Faelix Platerus observat. lib. 1. hath a most memorable example of a country man of his, that in the Spring-time by chance falling into a pit where frogs & frogs-spawn was, & a little of that water swallowed, began to suspect that he had likewise swallowed frog-spawn, and with that conceipt and feare, his phantasy wrought so far, that he verily thought he had yong liue frogs in his bellie, qui vivebant ex alimento suo, that liued by his nourishment, & was so certainly perswaded of it, that for many yeares together, he could not be rectified in his conceipt. He studied Physick seuen yeares together to cure himself, and travelled into Italy, France, and Germany, to conferre with the best Physitians about it, & Ao 1609, asked his counsell amongst the rest, he told him it was wind, his conceipt &c. but mordicus contradicere & ore & scriptis probare nitebatur: no saying would serue, it was no wind, but reall frogs: and doe you not heare them croake?

                     SVBSECT. 1. Immediate cause of these precedent Symptomes.
                     TO giue some satisfaction to melancholy men, that are troubled with these symptomes, a better means in my Iudgment cannot be taken, then to shew them the true causes whence they proceed, not from diuels, as they suppose, or that they are bewitched, or forsaken of God, heare or see &c. as many of them think, but from naturall & inward causes, that so knowing them, they may better avoid the effects, or at least indure them with more patience. The most grievous and common symptomes are Feare & Sorrow, & that without a cause, to the wisest and discreetest men in this malady not to be avoided. The reason why they are so, Aetius discusseth at large, Tetrab. 2.2. his first probleme out of Galen lib. 2 de causis, sympt. 1. For Galen imputeth all to the cold that is black, and thinks that the spirits being darkned, and the substance as the Brain cloudy and darke, all the obiects thereof

appeare terrible, and the 
                           Vapores crassi & nigri à ventriculo in cerebrum exhalant. Ber. Platerus.
                         mind it selfe by those darke, obscure, grosse fumes ascending from black humors, is in continuall darknes, feare & sorrow, and divers terrible monstrous fictions in a thousand shapes & apparitions, and violent passions, by which the Brain and phantasy are troubled and eclipsed.
                           Calidi hilares, frigidi indispositi ad laetitiam, & ideo solitarij, taciturni, non ob tenebras internas vt medici volunt sed ob frigus. multi melancholici nocte ambulant intrepidi.
                         
                        Fracastorius lib. 2. de Intellect. will haue cold to be the cause of Feare and Sorrow, for such as are cold, are ill disposed to mirth, dull and heavy, by nature solitary, silent, and not for any inward darknes, as Physitians thinke; for many melancholy men dare boldly be and continue, and walke in the darke, and delight in it: solum frigidi timidi, if they be hote they are merry, and the more hote, the more furious, and void of feare, as we see in madmen: but this reason holds not, for then no melancholy proceeding from choler adust, should feare. Averroes scoffes at Galen for his reasons, and brings fine arguments to refell them, which are copiously censured and confuted by Aelianus Montaltus cap. 5. & 6. Altomarus cap. 7. de mel. Guianerius tract. 15. cap. 1. Bright cap. 17. Laurentius cap. 5. Valesius med. contr. lib. 5. cont. 1.

                        Distemperature they conclude, makes blacke iuyce, blacknesse obscures the spirits, the spirits obscured, cause feare and sorrow. Laurentius cap. 13. thinks these black fumes offend especially the Diaphragma or Midriffe, and so perconsequens the mind, which is obscured as 
                           Vt nubeculae Solem offuscat. Constantinus lib. de Melan.
                         a cloud by the Sun. To this opinion of Galen, almost all the Greekes and Arabians subscribe, and Latines new & old, internae tenebrae offuscant animum, vt externae nocent pueris, as children are affrighted in the darke, so are melancholy men at all times, 
                           Altomarus cap. 7. causam timoris circumfert ater humor passionis materia, & atri spiritus perpetuā animae domicilio offundunt noctem.
                         as hauing the inward cause with them, & still carrying it about. Which black vapors whether they proceed from the black blood about the heart, as T.W. Ies. thinks in his Treatise of the passions of the mind, or stomack, splene, midriffe, or all the misaffected parts together, it boots not, they keep the mind in a perpetuall dungeon, and oppresse it with continuall feares, anxieties, sorrowes &c. It is an ordinary thing for such as are sound, to laugh at this dejected pusillanimity, and those other symptomes of melancholy, to

make themselues merry with thē, & to wonder at such, as toyes & trifles, which may be resisted and withstood, if they will themselues: but let him that so wonders, consider with himself, that if a man should tell him of a sudden, that some of his especiall friends were dead, could he choose but grieue, or set him vpon a steep rock, where he should be in danger to be precipitated, could he be secure? his hart would trēble for feare, & his head would be giddy. P. Byarus Tract. de pest. giues instance, as I haue said, 
                           Pone exemplū quod quis potest ambulare super trabem quae est in via, sed sisit super aquam profundam loco pontis non ambulabit super eam, eo quod imaginetur in animo & timet vehementer, formae cadendi impressâ, cui obediunt membra omnia, & facultates reliquae.
                         
                        and put case (saith he) in one that walkes vpon a planke, if it lye on the ground, he can safely doe it, but if the same planke be laid ouer some deepe water, insteed of a bridge, he is vehemently moued, and t'is nothing but his imagination, forma cadendi impressa, to which his other members and faculties obey. Yea, but you infer that such men haue a iust cause to feare, a true obiect of feare, so haue melancholy men an inward cause, a perpetuall fume & darknes, causing feare, grief, suspition, which they carry with thē, an obiect which cannot be remoued, remoue heat of the Liuer, a cold stomack, weak splene, remoue those adust humors & vapors arising from them, black blood from the heart, take away the cause, & then bid them not grieue, nor feare, or be heavy, dull, lumpish, otherwise counsell can doe little good; you may as well bid him that is sick of an ague, not to be adry, or him that is wounded, not to feele paine.
                     Suspition followes Feare & Sorrow at heeles, arising out of the same fountaine, so thinks

                        Fracastorius, that feare is the cause of suspition and still they suspect some trechery, or some secret machination to be framed against them, still they distrust. Restlinesse proceeds from the same spring, variety of fumes makes them like and dislike. Solitarinesse, avoiding of light, that they are weary of their liues, hate the world, arise from the same causes, because their spirits and humours are opposite to light, feare makes them avoid company, and absent themselues, least they should be misused, hissed at, or overshoot themselues, which still they suspect. They are prone to venery by reason of winde. Angry, waspish, and fretting

still, out of abundance of choler, which causeth fearefull dreames, and violent perturbations to them, both sleeping & waking. That they suppose they haue no heads, flye, sinke, they are pots, glasses, &c. is wind in their heads. 
                           Illud inquisitione dignum cur tam falsa recipiant, haberè se cornua esse mortuos nasatos esse aves, &c.
                         
                        Fracastorius accounts it a thing worthy of inquisition, why they should entertain such false conceits, as that they haue hornes, great noses, that they are Birds, Beasts, &c. And why they should thinke themselues Kings, Lords, Cardinals. For the first 1. Dispositio corporis. 2. Occasio Imaginationis.
                         
                        Fracastorius giues two reasons: One is the disposition of the body; the other the occasion of the phantasie; as if their eyes be purblind, their eares sing, &c. To the second Laurentius answeres, the Imagination inwardly or outwardly moued, represents to the vnderstanding, not intisements only to favour the passion or dislike, but a very intensiue pleasure followes the passion, or displeasure, and the will and reason are captivated by delighting in it.
                     Why Students and Lovers are so often Melancholy and mad, the Philosophers of
                           In prob lib. de coelo. vehemens & assidua cogitatio rei erga quam afficitur spiritus in cerebrum evocat.
                         
                        Conimbra giues this reason, because by a vehement and continuall meditation of that, wherewith they are affected, they fetch vp the spirits into the braine, & with the heat brought with them, they incend the braine beyond measure, and the cells of the inner senses, dissoluing their temperature, which being dissolved they cannot performe their offices as they ought.
                     
                     Why melancholy men are witty, which Aristotle hath long since maintained in his Problems; and that 
                           Melancholici Ingeniosi omnes sūmi viri in artibus & disciplinis siue circum imperatoriam aut reipub. disciplinam omnes ferè melancholici, Aristoteles.
                         all learned men, famous Philosophers, and Law-giuers, ad vnum ferè omnes Melancholici, haue still beene melancholy; is a Probleme much controverted. Iason Pratensis will haue it vnderstood of naturall Melancholy, which opinion Melancthon inclines to in his bookes de Animâ, and Marsilius Ficinus de san. tuen. lib. 1. cap. 5. but not simple, for that makes men stupid, heavy, dull, being cold and dry, fearefull, fooles, and solitary, but mixt with the other humors, fleame onely excepted: and they not adust, 
                           Adeo miscentur vt sit duplū sanguinis ad reliqua duo.
                         but so mixt as that blood be halfe, with little or no adustion, that they bee neither too hot

nor too cold. Aponensis cited by Melancthon, thinks it proceeds from melancholy adust, excluding all naturall melancholy as too cold. Laurentius condemnes his Tenent, because adustion of humours makes men mad, as Lime burnes when water is cast on it. It must bee mixt with blood, and somewhat adust, and so that old Aphorisme of Aristotle may bee verified, Nullum magnum ingenium sine mixtura dementiae. no excellent wit without a mixture of madnesse. Fracastorius shall decide the controversie, 
                           Lib. 2. de Intellectione. pingui sunt Minerva phlegmatici; sanguinei amabiles, grati, hilares, at non ingeniosi, cholerici celeres motu & ob id contemplationis impatientes. Melancholici solum excellentes &c.
                         
                        Phlegmaticke are dull: Sanguine louely, pleasant, acceptable and merry, but not witty: Cholericke are too swift in motion and furious, impatient of contemplation, deceitfull wits; Melancholy men haue the most excellent wits, but not all, this humour may be hot or cold, thicke or thinne, if too hot they are furious and mad, if too cold, dull, stupid, timorous and sad, if temperate, excellent, rather inclining to that extreame of heat then cold. And this sentence of his wil agree with that of Heraclitus, a dry light makes a wise mind, temperate heat and drynesse are the chiefe causes of a good wit; therefore saith Aelian, an Elephant is the wisest of all brute beasts, because his braine is driest, & ob atrae bilis copiam, this reason Cardan approues subtil. lib. 12. and Io. Baptista Silvaticus, a Physition of Millan, in his first controversie, hath copiously handled this question: Rulandus in his Problems, and others.
                     Weeping, Sighing, Laughing, Itching, Trembling, Sweating, Blushing, hearing and seeing strange noyses, visions, winde, cruditie, are motions of the body, depending vpon those precedent motions of the mind; Neither are teares, affections, but actions, as Scaliger holds, 
                           Trepidantum vox tremula quia cor queritur.

from a dry temperature. The cause of much wakeing is a dry braine, continuall meditation, discontent, feares, and cares, that suffer not the mind to be at rest. Incontinency is from winde and an hot liver, Montanus consil. 26.

They that are bold, arrogant, & carelesse seldome or never blush, but such as are fearefull. Anthonius Lodovicus, in his booke de pudore, will haue this subtile blood to arise in the face, not so much for the reverence of our betters in presence,

Qui multum iciunant aut noctes ducunt insomnes, they that much fast, or want sleep, as melancholy and sicke men commonly doe, they see visions or such as are very timorous by nature, or mad and distracted. As they that drinke wine thinke all runnes round, when it is in their owne braine; so is it with these men, the falt and cause is inward, as Galen affirmes,

Marcellus Donatus, lib. 2. cap. 1. brings in a story out of Aristotle, of one Antepheron which likely saw wheresoever he was, his own Image in the ayre, as in a glasse. Vitello lib. 10. perspect. hath such another instance of a familiar acquaintance of his, that after the want of three or foure nights sleepe, as he was riding by a rivers side, saw another riding with him, and vsing all such gestures as he did, but when more light appeared, it vanished. Eremites & Anachorites haue many such absurd visions, revelations by reason of much fasting, and bad diet, many are deceaued by legerdemain, as Scot hath well shewed in his book of the discovery of witchcraft, and Cardan. subtil. 18. by suffites, perfumes and suffumigations, perspectiue glasses, and such naturall causes, as you may perceaue in Baptista Porta, Albertus and others, Glow-wormes, Fiere-drakes, Meteors, rotten wood, &c. But most part it is within the braine, although

I may not deny, but that oftentimes the divell deludes them, and takes his opportunity to suggest and represent such vaine obiects to sicke melancholy men, and such as are ill affected.
                     The hearing is as frequently deluded as the sight, from the same causes almost, as hee that heares Bells, will make them sound what he list.

Some are deceaued by Echoes, some by roaring of waters, or concaues and reverberation of ayre in the ground & hollow places or wals.

the humour it selfe, is Balneum Diaboli, the Divels bath and as Agrippa proues, doth entice him, to seize vpon them.

                        If that evacuation of haemrods, or varices which they call the water betweene the skinne, shall happen to a melancholy man, his misery is ended. Hippocrates Aphor. 6.11. Galen. lib. 6. de morbis vulgar. com. 8. confirmes the same, and to this Aphorisme of Hippocrates all the Arabians, new and old Latines subscribe; Montaltus. cap. 25. Her. de Sax. Mercurialis, Vittorius Faventinus, &c Skenkius lib. 1. observat. med. cap. de Maniâ. illustrats this Aphorisme, with an example of one Daniel Federer a Coppersmith, that was long melancholy, and in the end madde about the 27 yeare of his age, these varices or water began to arise in his thighes, and he was freed from his madnesse. Marius the Roman was so cured some say, though with great paine. Skenkius hath some other instances of women that haue beene cured by flowing of their months, which before were stopped. That the opening of the haemrods will doe as much for men, all Physitians iointly signifie, so they bee voluntary some say, and not by compulsion. All melancholy men are better after a quartane

                        Iobertus saith, scarce any man hath that Ague twice: But whether it free him from this malady, t'is a question. for many Physitians ascribe all long Agues for especiall causes, and a quartane Ague amongst the

rest.

                        Rhasis cont. lib. 1. tract. 9. When melancholy gets out at the superficies of the skinne, or settles breaking out in scabbs, leprosie, morphew, or is purged by stooles, or by the Vrine, and that the spleene is inlarged, and those varices appeare, the disease is dissolued. Guianerius cap. 5. tract. 15. addes Dropsy, Iandise, Disentery, Leprosy, as good signes, to these Scabbes, Morphewes, and breaking out, and proues it out of the 6. of Hippocrates Aphorismes.

                        Queene of diseases, and inexorable, may we say of melancholy. And yet Paracelsus will haue all diseases whatsoeuer curable, and laughs at all them which thinke otherwise, as T. Erastus par. 3. obiects to him. Although in another place, hereditary diseases he accounts incurable, and by no art to bee remoued.

there is some hope likely, but these vnhappy men are borne to misery, past all hope of recovery, incurably sick, and the longer they liue, the worse they are, death alone must ease them.
                     Another doubt is made by some Philosophers, whether it be lawfull for a man in such extremity of paine and griefe, to make away himselfe, and how such men that so doe, are to be censured. The Platonists approue of it, that it is lawfull in such cases, and vpon a necessity, Plotinus lib. de beatitud. cap. 7. and Socrates himself defends it, in Plato's Phaedon, if any man labour of an incurable disease, he may dispatch himselfe if it be to his good.

                     Vpon this good hope I will proceed, vsing the same method in the Cure, which I haue formerly vsed in the rehearsing of the causes; first Generall, and then Particular, & those according to their severall species. Of these Cures some bee Lawfull, some againe Vnlawfull, which though frequent, familiar, and often vsed, yet iustly censured, and to bee controverted. As first, whether by these diabolicall meanes, which

are commonly practised by the Divell & his Ministers, Sorcerers, Witches, Magicians, &c. by Spells, cabalisticall words, Charmes, Characters, Images, Amulets, Ligatures, Philtures, Incantations, &c. This Disease and the like may be cured? and if they may, whether it be lawfull to make vse of them, or for our good to seeke after such meanes in any case? The first whether they can doe any such cures, is questioned amongst many writers, some affirming, some denying. Valesius cont. med. lib. 5. cap. 6.

Nothing so familiar as to heare of such cures, Sorcerers are too common, Cunning men, Wisards, & whitewitches, as they call them, in every village, that if they bee sought vnto, wil helpe almost all infirmities of body & mind, that to doubt of it any longer,

Leo Suavius in his Comment vpon Paracelsus, seemes to make it an art, which ought to be approued. Pistorius and others stiffly maintaine the vse of charmes, words, characters, &c. Ars vera est, sed pauci artifices reperiuntur, The art is true but there be but a few that haue skill in it. Marcellus Donatus lib. 2 de hist. iur. cap. 1. proues out of Iosephus eight booke of antiquities, that 
                           Refert Solomonem mentis morbos curasse, & daemones abegisse ipsos carminibus , quod & coram Vespasiano fecit Eliaser
                         
                        Solomon so cured all the diseases of the mind by spells, charmes, and droue away Divells, and that Eliaser did as much before Vespasian. Langius in his med. epist. holds Iuppiter Menecrates, that did so many stupend cures in his time, to haue vsed this art, and that he was no other then a Magician. Many famous cures are dayly done in this kinde, this Divell is an expert Physitian, as Godelman calls him, lib. 1. cap. 18. and God permits many times these Witches and Magicians to produce such effects, as Lavater, cap. 3. lib. 8. part. 3. cap. 1. Polid. Virg. lib. 1. de prodigijs, Delrio & others admit. Such cures may be done, and as Paracels. Tom. 4. de morb amen. stiffly maintaines,
                           Spirituales morbi spiritualiter curari debent.
                         
                        they cannot otherwise be cured but by spells, seales, and spirituall physicke.

                        It matters not, saith Paracelsus, whether it be God or the Divell, Angels or vncleane spirits cure him, so that he be

eased. He calls a

                        a strong imagination, and they shall finde the effects, let Divines say to the contrary what they will. He proues and earnestly contends that many diseases cannot otherwise be cured, Incantione orti, incantione curari debent. If they be caused by incantation, 
                           Idem Plinius contendit quosdā esse morbos qui incantationibus solum curentur.
                         they must be cured by incantation. Constantius lib. 4. approues of such remedies, Bartolus the lawyer. Peter Aerodius rerum Iudic. lib. 3. tit. 7. Salicetus, Godefridus, with others of that sect, allow of them; modò sint ad sanitatem quae à magis fiunt secùs non. So they be for the parties health and good or not at all.

Rom. 8.19. Evill is not to be done that good may come of it. Much better it were for such patients as are so troubled, to endure a little misery in this life, then to hazard their soules health for ever, and as Delrio counselleth,

Some take vpō them to expell Divells by naturall remedies, and magical exorcismes, which they seeme to approue out of the practise of the primitive Church, as that aboue cited of Iosephus, Eliaser; Iraenius, Tertullian, Austin. Eusebius makes mention of such, and Magicke it selfe hath beene publikely professed in some Vniversities, as of old in Salamanca: but condemned Anno 1318 by the Chancellour and Vniversity of 
                           P. Lumbard.

Our Pontificiall writers retaine many of these adiurations, & formes of Exorcismes still in their Church, besides those in Baptisme vsed, they exorcise meats, and such as are possessed as they hold, in Christs name. Read Hieron. Mengus cap. 3. Thyreus part. 3. cap. 58. what exorcismes they prescribe, besides those ordinary meanes of

                  BEing so clearely evinced as it is, that all vnlawfull cures are to be refused, it remaines to treat of such as are to be admitted, & those are commonly those which God hath appointed,The Lord hath created medicines of the earth, and he that is wise will not abhorre them. Eccles. 38.4. by vertue of stones, hearbs, plants, mettles, &c, and such like which are prepared and applied to our vse, by art & industry of Physitians, who are the dispensers of such treasures for our good, and to bee s 
                     honoured for necessities sake, Gods immediate ministers, to whom in our infirmities wee are to seeke for helpe. Yet not so that wee rely too much, or wholy vpon them, A Iove principium, wee must first beginne with prayer, and then vse Physicke, not one without the other,My son faile not in thy sicknesse but pray vnto the Lord and hee will make thee whole, Eccles. 38.9. Hue omne principium

To pray alone and reiect ordinary meanes, is to doe like him in Aesope, that when his cart was stalled, lay flat on his backe and cryed aloud helpe Hercules, but that was to little purpose, except as his friend advised him, rotis tute ipse annitaris, hee whipt his horses withall, and put his shoulder to the wheel. God works by means, as Christ cured the blind man with clay and spittle. Orandum est vt sit mens sana in corpore sano. As we must pray for health of body and mind, so we must vse our vtmost indeavours to preserue and continue it. Some kinde of Divells are not cast out but by fasting and prayer, and both necessarily required, not one without the other. For all the physicke wee can vse, art, excellent industry, is to no purpose without calling vpō God Nil iuvat immensos Cratero promittere montes. It is in vaine to seeke for helpe, runne, ride, except God blesse vs.

                     tells them that it is not to be expected, except with a true faith they call vpon God, & teach their patients to doe the like. The councell of Lateran Canone 22. decreed they should doe so, the Fathers of the Church haue still advised as much, whatsoever thou takest in hand, saith 
                        Lemnius è Gregor exhor ad vitam opt instit. cap. 48. quicquid meditaris aggredi aut perficere deum in consilium adhibeto.
                      
                     Gregory, let God be of thy counsell, and consult with him. That healeth those that are broken in heart (Ps. 147.3.) and bindeth vp their sores. Otherwise as the Prophet Ieremy cap. 46.11. denounced to Aegypt, in vaine shalt thou vse many medicins, for thou shalt haue no health. It is the same counsell which 
                        Commentar lib. 7 ob infelicem pugnam contristatus in aegritudinem incidit ita vt à medicis curari non poterat.
                      
                     Cominaeus that politick historiographer giues to all Christian princes, vpon occasion of that vnhappy overthrowe of Charles Duke of Burgundy, by meanes of which he was extreamely melancholy, and sick to death: In so much that neither physick, nor perswasion could doe him any good, percauing his preposterous errour belike, adviseth all great men in such cases,

                     to pray first to God, and

with all submission and penitency to confesse their sinnes, and thē to vse physicke. The very same fault it was which the Prophet reprehends in Asa king of Iuda that hee relied more on physicke then on God, and by all meanes would haue him to amend. And is a fit caution to be obserued of all other sorts of men. The Prophet David was so observant of this precept, that in all his misery and vexation of mind, hee put this rule first in practise. Psal. 77.3. When I am in heavinesse I will thinke on God. Psal. 86.4. Comfort the soule of thy servant, for vnto thee I lift vp my soule. & ver. 7. In the day of trouble will I call vpon thee for thou hearest me. Ps. 54.1. Saue me O God by thy name &c. Psal. 87. Psal. 20. And t'is the common practise of all good men. Ps. 107.13. when their heart was humbled with heavinesse, they cryed to the Lord in their trouble, and hee delivered them from their distresse. And they haue found good successe in so doing, as David confesseth, Psal. 30.11. Thou hast turned my ioy into mourning, thou hast loosed my sacke, and girded me with gladnesse. And therefore hee adviseth all others to doe the like, Psal. 31.24. All yee that trust in the Lord, be strong and he shall establish your heart. It is reported by

                     Minutius that worthy Consull of Rome in an Oration he made to his souldiers, was much offended with them, and taxed their ignorance that in their misery, called more on him then vpon God. A generall fault it is all over the world, and Manutius his speech concernes vs all, we rely more on Physicke, and seeke more to Physitians then to God himselfe. And as much falty are they that prescribe, as they that aske, respecting more their gaine, and trust to their ordinary receipts and medicines many times, then to him that made them. I would wish all patients in this

behalfe, in the midst of their melancholy to remember that of Siracides, Ecc. 1.12. & 12. The feare of the Lord is glory & gladnesse and reioycing.

Barradius the Iesuite boldly giues it out, that Christs Countenance, & the Virgin Maries, would cure Melancholy if one had looked stedfastly on them. And P. Morales the Spaniard in his booke de pulch. Ies. & Mar. confirms the same out of Carthusianus, and I know not whom, that it

was a common proverb in those dayes, for such as were trobled in mind, to say, Eamus ad videndum filium Mariae, as they doe now goe to St Anthonies in Padua, or to S• Hilaries at Poicters in France.

                     OF those divers gifts which our Apostle Paul saith, God hath bestowed on man, this of Physick is not the least,

as most necessary, and especially conducing to the common good of mankind. Next therefore to God in all our extremities (for of the most high commeth healing, Ecclus 38.2.) We must seek to, and rely vpon the Physitian,Ecclus 38. In the sight of great men he shall be in admiration. who is manus Dei saith Hierophilus, and to whom he hath giuen knowledge, that he might be glorified in his wondrous works. With such doth he heale men, & taketh away their paines, Ecclus 38.6.7. when thou hast need of him, let him not goe from thee. The houre may come that their enterprises may haue go

It is not therefore to be doubted, but if we seek a Physitian as we ought, we may be eased of our infirmities, and to such a one as is sufficient, and worthily so called; for there be many mountebanks, quacksaluers, Empericks, in every street almost, and in every village, that take vpon them this name, & make this noble & profitable Art to be euill spoken of, and contemned, by reason of such base and illiterate artificers: but such a one I speake of, as is approued, learned, skilfull, honest, &c. of whose duty Wecker Antid. cap. 2. & Syntax. med. Crato. Iulius Alexandrinus lib. de med. Hernius prax. med. l. 3. cap. 1. &c. treat at large. For this particular disease, he that shall take vpon him to cure it,

                        Paracelsus will haue to be a Magician, a Chimist, a Philosopher, an Astrologer. Thurnesserus, Severinus the Dane, and some other of his followers require as much: many of them cannot be cured but by Magicke: and

                        Paracelsus is so stiffe for his Chimicall medicines, that in his cures he will admit almost of no other Physick, deriding in the mean time Hippocrates, Galen, and all their followers: but Magick and all such remedies, I haue already censured, and shall speak of Chimistrie

                        Hellebor will helpe, but not alway, not giuen by euery Physitian &c. but these men are too peremptory, and selfe-conceited as I think. But what doe I doe, interposing in that which is beyond my reach? a blind man cannot iudge of colors, nor I of these things. Only this much I would require, Honesty in every Physitian, that he be not ouer carelesse or covetous, Harpy like to make a prey of his patient, as an hungry Surgeon often doth prolong & wierdraw his cure so long as there is any hope of pay, Non missura cutem, nisi plena cruoris hirudo.

                        A wise Physitian will not giue Physick but vpon necessity, and first try medicinall diet, before he proceed to medicinall cure. And in another place laughs those men to scorne that think, longis syrupis expugnare daemones, & animi phantasmata, they can purge the diuell by Physick. Another caution is, that they proceed vpon good grounds, if so be there be need of Physick, & not mistake the disease;

Montanus consil. 30. inveighs against such perturbations, that purge to the halfes, and tire Nature, and molest the body to no purpose. T'is a crabbed humor to purge; and as Laurentius cals this disease, the reproch of Physitians, and for

that cause more carefully to be respected. Though the Patient be averse, saith Laurentius, desire help, and refuse it again, though he neglect his own health, it behoues a good Physitian, not to leaue him helplesse. But most part they offend in that other extreame, they prescribe too much Physick, and tire out their bodies with continuall potions to no purpose. Aetius Tetrabib. 2. ser. 2. cap. 90. will haue them by all meanes therefore

Many things are necessarily to be obserued and continued on the Patients behalfe, first that he be not too niggardly miserable of his purse, or think it too much he bestowes vpon himself, to saue charges, endanger his health.

                           De animá Barbarâ tamen immanitate, & deplorandâ inscitiâ contemnunt praecepta sanitatis, mortem & morbos vltro accersunt.
                         or through their ignorance in not taking notice of their disease and danger of it, contempte, supine negligence, extenuation, wretchednes & peeuishnesse, they vndoe themselues, & often out of a preiudice, a lothing, a distaste of Physick, they had rather dye or doe worse, then take any of it. Barbarous immanity Melancton termes it, and folly, to be deplored, so to contemne the precepts of health, good remedies, and voluntarily to pull death, and many maladies vpon their own heads. Though many againe are in that other extreame too profuse, suspitious and jelous of their health, too apt to take Physick vpon euery small occasion, to aggravatè euery small passion, imperfection, impediment; if their finger doe but ake, run, ride, send for a Physitian, as many Gentlewomen frequently doe; and when he comes,

                               medicis sunt molesti, vt alia aliis adiungant.
                         they make it worse then it is, by amplifying that which is not. 
                           Consil. 173. è Scolizio. Melancholicorū boc ferè proprium est, vt graviora dicant esse symptomata, quid revera sunt.
                         
                        Hier. Capivaccius sets it downe as a common fault of all melancholy persons, to say their symptomes are greater then they are, to be lye themselues. And which Mercurialis notes consil. 53. to be more troublesome to their Physitians, then other ordinary Patients, that they may haue change of Physicke.
                     
                     A third thing to be required in a Patient, is confidence to be of good cheare, and haue good hope that his Physitian can help him. 
                           Oportet infirmo imprimere salutem, vtcum
                                 
                                    
                                 
                                 que
                               promittere etsi ipse desperet. Nullum medicamentum efficax nisi medicus etiam fuerit, fortis Imaginationis.
                         
                        Damascen the Arabian requires likewise in the Physitian himself that he be confident he can cure him, otherwise his Physick will not be effectuall, and promise him withall, that he will certainly help him, make him beleeue so

at least. 
                           De promise. doct. cap. 15. quoniam sanitatis forma anima medici continet.
                         
                        Galeottus giues the reason, because the forme of health, is contained in the Physitians mind; and as Galen holds, 
                           Spes & confidentia plus valent quam medicina.
                        
                        confidence and hope doe more good then Physicke. And he cures most, in whom most are confident. Paracelsus assignes it for an only cause, why Hipocrates was so fortunate in his cures, not for any extraordinary skill hee had, but 
                           Faelicior in mediciná ob fidem Ethnicorū.
                         
                        because the common people had a most strong conceipt of his worth. To this of confidence, we may adde perseverance, and obedience, constancy, not to change his Physitian, or dislike him vpon every toy, for he that so doth, saith 
                           Aphoris. 89. aeger qui plurimos consulit medicos, plerum

                        Ianus Damascen, or consults with many, falls into many errors, or that vseth many medicines. It was a chiefe caveat of 
                           Nihil ita sanitatem impedit, ac remediorum crebra mutatio, nec venit vulnus ad cicatricē in quo diversa medicamenta tentantur.
                         
                        Seneca to his friend Lucilius, that she should not alter his Physitian, or prescribed Physick, Nothing hinders health more, a wound can never be cured that hath severall plasters. Crato consil. 186. taxeth all melancholy persons of this fault, 
                           Melancholicorum proprium quum exeorum arbitrio non fit subita mutatío in meliùs, àlterare medicos qui quidvis &c.
                         
                        T'is proper to them if things fall not out to their minde, & that they haue not present ease, to seeke another & another, twenty one after another, & they still promise all to cure them, try a thousand remedies, & by this meanes they encrease their malady, and make it most dangerous and difficill to be cured. They try many saith Montanus, and profit by none: and for that cause consil. 24. he inioynes his patient before he take them in hand, 
                           Imprimis hoc statuere oportet requiri perseverantiam & tolerantiam. Exi

                        perseuerance and sufferance, for in such a small time no great matter can be effected, and vpon that condition he will administer Physicke, otherwise all his endeauour and counsell would be to small purpose. And in his 31. counsell for a noble matron, he tels her, 
                           Si curari vult;opus est pertinari perseverantiâ, fideli obedientiâ & patientiâ singulari si tardet aut desperet, nullum habebit effectum.
                         
                        if she will be cured, she must be of a most abiding patience, faithfull obedience, and singular perseverance, if she remit or despaire she can expect or hope for no good successe. Consil. 230.

                         for an Italian Abbat he makes it one of the greatest reasons why this disease is so incurable,
                           Aegritudine amittunt patientuam, & indè morbi incurebiles.
                         
                        because the parties are so restlesse, and impatient, & will therefore haue him that intend to be eased, to take Physicke
                        
                        
                           Non ad mensē aut annum, sed oportet toto vitae curriculo curationi operam dare.
                        
                        not for a moneth, a yeare, but to apply himselfe to their prescriptions, all the dayes of his life. Last of all it is required that the patient be not too bold to practise vpon himselfe without an approued Physitians consent, or to try conclusions, if he read a Receipt in a Book, for so many grossely mistake, and doe themselues more harme then good. Many things saith 
                           Prasat. deuar. med. In libellis quae vulgò versantur apud literatos incautiores multae legunt, à quibus decipiuntur eximia illis, sed portentosum hauriunt venenum.
                         
                        Penottus, are written in our Bookes, which seeme to the Reader to be excellent remedies, but they that make vse of them are often deceiued, and take for Physicke, poyson. I remember in Valleriolas observations, a story of one Iohn Baptist a Neapolitan, that finding by chance a pamphlet in Italian, written in praise of Hellebor, would needs adventure on himselfe, and took ʒ j for ℈ j and had not he bin sent for, the poore fellow had poysoned himselfe. From whence he concludes out of Damascenus 2. & 3. Aphor.

                        that without exquisite knowledge, to worke out of bookes, is a most dangerous thing, and how vnsavory a thing it is to beleeue Writers, and take vpon trust, as this Patient perceiued by his own perill. I could recite such another example of mine owne knowledge, of a friend of mine, that finding a Receipt in Brassiuola, would needs take Hellebor in substance, and try it on himselfe, but had not some of his friends come to visit him by chance, he had by his indiscretion hazarded himselfe, many such I haue obserued. These are those ordinary Cautions, which I would think fit to be noted, and he that shall keepe them, as 
                           Consil. 23. hee omnia si quo ordine decet egerit vel curabitur, velcertè minus afficietur.

                     SVBSEC. 3. Physicke.
                     PHysicke it selfe in the last place is to be considered, for the Lord hath created medicines of the earth, and he that is wise will not abhorre them, Ecclus 38.4. and ver. 8. of such doth the Apothecary make a confection &c. Of these medicines there be diuers and infinite kindes, plants, mettals, animals,

&c. and those of seuerall natures, some good for one, hurtfull to another: some noxious in themselues, corrected by art, very wholesome and good, simples, mixt &c. and therefore left to be managed by discreet and skilfull Physitians, and applyed to mans vse. To this purpose they haue invented method, and severall rules of art, to put these remedies in order, for their particular ends. Physick, as Hipocrates defines it, is nought els but 
                           Fuchsius cap. 2. lib. 1. 
                        addition & substraction, & as it is required in all other diseases, so in this of melancholy it ought to be most accurate, it being as 
                           In pract. med. haec affectio nostris temporibus frequentissima, ergo maximè pertinet ad nos huius curationē intelligere.
                         
                        Mercurialis acknowledgeth, so common an affection in these our times, and therefore fit to be vnderstood. Severall prescripts and methods I find in severall men, some take vpon them to cure all diseases with one medicine, severally applyed, as that Panacea, Aurum potabile, so much controverted in these dayes, herba solis &c. Paracelsus reduceth all diseases to 4 principall heads, to whom Severinus, Ravelascus, Leo Sauius, and others adhere and imitate. And those are Leprosy, Gout, Dropsy, Falling-sicknesse. To which they reduce the rest, as to Leprosy vlcers, itches, surfures, scabbes &c. To Goute, stone, cholick, toothache, headache &c. To Dropsy, Agues, Iaundies, Cacexia &c. To the Falling-sicknesse belong Palsy, Vertigo, Crampes, Convulsions, Incubus, Apoplexy, Mother, Melancholy &c. 
                           Si aliquis horum morborum summus sanatur, sanantur omnes inferiores.
                         
                        If any of these foure principall be cured, (saith Ravelascus) all the inferiour be cured, and the same remedies commonly serue: but this is too generall, and by some contradicted: for this peculiar disease of Melancholy, of which I am now to speake, I find severall cures, severall methods, and prescripts. They that intend the practick cure of Melancholy, saith Duretus in his notes to Hollerius, set down nine peculiar scopes or ends Savanorola prescribes 7 especiall Canons. Aelianus Montaltus cap. 26, Faventinus in his Empiricks, Hercules de Saxonia &c, haue their severall iniunctions and rules, all tending to one end. The ordinary is threefold, which I meane to follow.

The same iniunction I find verbatim in I. Caesar Claudinus, Respon. 34. Scoltzij consil. 183. Tralliauus cap. 16. lib. 1. and

                        Laelius à Fonte Aegubinus often brag that they haue done more cures in this kind by rectification of Diet, then all other Physick. So that in a word I may say

to most melancholy men, as the Fox said to the Wesell, that could not get out of the garner, macra cauum repetes, quem macra subisti, the six nonnaturall things caused it, and they must cure it. Which howsoeuer I doe heare treat of, as proper to the Meridian of melancholy, yet neverthelesse that which is here said, will generally serue 
                           Modo non multum elongetur.
                         most other diseases, and ease them likewise, if it be obserued.
                     Of these six non-naturall things, the first is Diet properly so called, which consists in meat and drink, in which we must consider Substance, Quantity, Quality, and that, opposite to the precedent.

                         All sharp & sowre sauces must be avoided, and spices, or at least seldome vsed: and so saffron sometimes in broth may be tolerated, but these things may be more freely vsed, as the temperature of the party is hot or cold, or as he shall find offence or inconvenience by them.

And therefore

                        Crato adviseth his patient to eat but twice a-day, and that at his set meales, by no meanes to eat without an appetite, or vpon a full stomack, and to put seuen houres difference betwixt dinner and supper, which rule if we did obserue in our Colledges, it would be much better for our healths. But custome that tyrant so prevailes, that contrary to all good order and rules of Physick we scarce admit of fiue. If after 7 houres tarrying he shall haue no stomack, let him differre his meale, or eat very little at his ordinary time of repast.

I haue read many treatises to this purpose, I knowe not how it may concerne some few sick men, but for my part generally for all, I should subscribe to that custome of the Romanes, to make a sparing dinner, and a liberall supper. All their preparation and inuitation was stil at supper, no mention of dinner. Many reasons I could giue, but when all is said pro and con.

                        Cardans rule is best, to keepe that we are accustomed vnto, though it bee naught, and to follow our disposition and appetite in some things is not amisse, to eat sometimes of a dish which is hurtfull, if we haue an extraordinary likeing to it. Alexander Severus loued Hares and Apples aboue all other meats, as Lampridius relates in his life; one Pope porke, another Peacocke, &c.

These few rules of diet he that shall keep shall surely find great ease and speedy remedy by it. It is a wonder to relate that prodigious temperance of some Hermites, Anachorites, and Fathers of the Church, hee that shall but read their liues written by Hierom, Athanasius, &c. how abstemious heathens haue beene in this kind, those Curios and Fabricios, the old Philosophers, as Pliny recordes lib. 11, Xenophon lib. 1. de vit.

Emperours and Kings, Nicephorus Eccles. hist. lib. 18. cap. 8. of Mauritius, Lodovicus pius, &c. cannot but admire them, this haue they done voluntarily, and in health; what shall these private men doe that are visited with sicknesse, and necessarily

It is a hard thing to obserue a strict diet, & qui medicè vivit, miserè viuit, as the saying is, yet he that loues himselfe, will easily endure this little misery, to avoid a greater inconvenience, è malis minimū, better do this then doe worse.

Piso calls it Beneficium ventris, the benefit, help, or pleasure of the belly, for it dothmuch ease it. Laurentius cap. 8.

                     Galen crakes how many severall cures he hath performed in this kind by vse of bathes alone, and Ruffus pills, moistning them which are otherwise drye. Rhasis makes it a principall cure. Tota cura sit in humectando, to bath and afterwards annoint with oyle. Iason Pratensis, Laurentius, cap. 8. and Montanus set downe many peculiar formes of artificiall bathes. Crato consil. 17. lib. 2. commends Mallowes, Camomile, Violets, Burrage to be boyled in it, & sometimes faire water alone, and in his following counsell, Balneum aquae dulcis solum saepissime profuisse compertum habemus.

                      Capones grease, especially the backe bone, and then lotions of the head, embrocations &c. These kinde of bathes haue beene in former times much frequented, and diversly varied, and are still in generall vse in those Easterne countries. The Romanes had their publike Bathes, very sumptuous and stupend, as those of Antoninus and Dioclesian. Plin. lib. 36. saith there were an infinite number of them in Rome, and mightily frequented, some bathed seauen times a day, as Commodus the Emperour is reported to haue done. Vsually twice a day, and they were after annointed with most costly ointments wee haue many ruines of such Bathes found in this Iland, amongst those parietines and rubbish of old Roman townes. Lips. de mag. Vrb. Rom. lib. 3. cap. 8. Rosin. Scot of Antwerpe, and other Antiquaries tell strange stories of their Bathes. Gillius lib. 4. cap. vlt. Topogr. Constant. reckons vp 155 publike.

                     Busbequius in his Epistles is very copious in describing the manner of them, how their women goe covered with a maid following with a box of oyntment to rub them. The ritcher sort haue private Bathes in their houses, the poorer goe to the common, and are generally so curious in this behalfe, that they will not eat or drinke vntill they haue bathed, before and after meales some,

Leo Afer, lib. 3. makes mention of 100 severall Bathes at Fez in Africk, most sumptuous, and such as haue great revenewes belonging to them. Buxdorf. cap. 14. Synogog. Iud. speakes of many ceremonies amongst the Iewes in this kinde, they are very superstitious in their Bathes, especially women.
                  Naturall Bathes are praised by some, discommended by others, but it is in a diverse respect.

                     that the Liuer be outwardly anointed with some coolers, that it be not ouerheated. But these bathes must be warily frequented by melancholy persons, and such as are very cold of themselues, for as Gabelius concludes of al Dutch Bathes, and especially of those of Baden, they are good for all cold diseases,

infirmities proceeding of choler, inflammations of the spleene and liuer. Our English Bathes as they are hote, must needs incurre the same censure. But D Turner of old, and D Iones haue written at large of them. As for sweating, vrine, bloodletting by haemrods, or otherwise, I shall elswhere more oportunely speake of them,
                  Immoderate Venus in excesse, a cause, or in defect, so moderatly vsed to some parties an only helpe, a present remedy. Peter Forestus cals it, aptissimum remedium, a most apposite remedy, 
                     
                        Soluit Venus rationis vim impeditam, ingentes iras remutit, &c.
                      
                     remitting anger, and reason, that was otherwise bound. Avicenna Fen. 3.20. Oribasius med. collect. lib. 6. cap. 37. contend out of Ruffus and others,
                        Multi comitiales, melancholici, insani, huisus vsu solo sanati.
                      
                     that many madmen, melancholy, and laboring of the falling sicknesse, haue bin cured by this alone. Montaltus cap. 27. de melan. will haue it driue away sorrow and all illusions of the braine, to purge the heart and braine from all ill smokes and vapors that offend them,
                        Si omittatur coitus, contristat & plurimum gravat corpus & animum.
                      
                     and if it be omitted as Valescus supposeth, it makes the mind sad, the body dull and heauy. Marcellus Donatus lib. 2. med. hist. cap. 1. tels a story to confirme this out of Alexander Benedictus, of a maide that was mad, ob menses inhibitos, cum in officinam meritoriam incidisset, à quindecim viris eâdem nocte compressa, mensium largo profluvio, quod pluribus annis ante constiterat, non sine magno pudore mane menti restituta decessit. But this must be warily vnderstood; for as Arnoldus obiects lib. 1. breviar. 18. cap. quid coitus ad melancholicum succum? what affinity haue these two? 
                        Nisi certo constet nimium semen aut sanguinem causam esse, aut amor precesserit , aut &c.
                      
                     except it be manifest that superabundance of seed, or fulnesse of blood be a cause, or that loue, or an extraordinary desire of Venus haue gone before. Montaltus cap. 27. will not allow of moderate Venus to such as haue the gout, palsy, Epilepsy, Melancholy, except they be very lusty, and full of blood.

                     Marsilius Cagnatus put Venus one of the fiue mortal enemies of a student: it consumes the spirits, and weakeneth the braine. Haliabbas the Arabian 5. Theor. cap. 36. and Iason Pratensis make it the fountaine

of most diseases,
                        Frigidis & ficcis corporibus inimicissima.
                      
                     but most pernitious to them which are cold and dry, a melancholy man must not meddle with it, but in some cases. Plutarch in his book de san tuendâ, accompts of it as one of the three principall signes and preseruers of health, temperance in this kind,
                        Vesci intra sacietatem, impigrum esse ad laborem, vitale semen conservare.
                      
                     To rise with an appetite, to be ready to worke, & abstaine from Venery, tria saluberrima, are three most healthful things. We see their opposites how pernitious they are to mankind, as to all other creatures they bring death, & many ferall diseases. Immodicis brevis est aetas & rara senectus. Aristotle giues instance in sparrows, 
                        Nequitiae est quae te non sinit esse senem.

It is much controverted betwixt Tycho Brahe and Christopher Rotman the Lansgraue of Hassias Mathematitian in their Astronomicall Epistles, whether it be the same Diaphanum cleerenesse, matter, of the Ayre and Heavens, or two distinct Essences. Christopher Rotman, Iohn Pena, Iordanus Brunus, with many other late Mathematitians, contend that it is the same and one matter throughout, sauing that the higher it is the purer it is, and more subtill.

                     Tycho will haue too distinct matters of heauen and ayre, but to say truth, with some small qualification, they haue one and the selfe same opinion, about the Essence and matter of Heavens, that it is not hard and impenetrable, as Peripateticks hold, transparent, of a quinta essentia, but that it is penetrable and soft as the ayre it selfe is, and that the Planets moue in it as Birds in the ayre, fishes in the sea. This they proue by the motion of Comets, and otherwise, which are not generated, as Aristotle holds in the ayeriall region of hot and dry exhalations, and so consumed, but as Anaxagoras and Democritus held of old of a celestiall matter, and as

Not (as they hold) hard, impenetrable, subtill, transparent, &c. or making musicke, as Phythagoras maintained.

But who shall dwell in these vast Bodies, Earths, Worlds,

These and such like prodigious Paradoxes, inferences must needs follow, if it once be granted, which Rotman, Kepler, Gilbert, Diggeus, Galely, and others maintaine of the Earths motion, that it is a Planet, and shines as the Moone doth, which containes in it

Which Plutarch and Pythagoras formerly taught: and manifestly discerne hils and dales, & such like concavities, if we may subscribe to, and belieue Galelies observations. But to avoid these Paradoxes of the Earths motion, our later Mathematitians haue rolled all the stones that may be stirred, and to salue all apparances & obiections, haue invented new hypotheses, and fabricated new systemes of the World, out of their own Dedalian heads. Fracastorius will haue the Earth stand still as before, and to avoid that grosse supposition of Eccentricks and Epicicles de hath coyned 72 Homocentrickes, to solue all apparances. Nicholas Ramerus will haue the Earth the Center of the World, but moueable, & the eighth Spheare immoueahle, the fiue vpper Planets to moue about the Sun, the Sun and Moone about the Earth. Of which Orbes Tycho Brahe puts the Earth the Centre immoueable, the Stars moueable; the rest with Ramerus, the Planets without Orbes to wander in the Aire, and keep time and distance, true motion according to that vertue which God hath giuen them.

                     Helisaeus Roeslin censureth them both, with Coperinicus and Ptolemaeus as vnsufficient: one offends against naturall Philosophy, another against Opticke principles, a third against Mathematicall, as not answering to Astronomicall observations, one puts a great space

betwixt Saturnes Orbe, and the eighth Spheare, another too narrow. In his own hypothesis he puts the Earth as before, the vniversall Centre, the Sun Center to the fiue vpper Planets, to the eighth Spheare he ascribes diurnal motion, & Eccentricks and Epicycles to the seuen Planets, which hath bin formerly exploded, and so dum vitant stulti vitia in contraria currunt, as a tinker stops one hole, and makes two, he corrects them, & doth worse himself; reformes some, & marres all.

                        Lib. 1. cap. 2.

                     modity then health. The best soile commonly yeelds the worst Aire, a dry sandy plat is fittest to build vpon, & such as is rather hilly then plain, as being most cōmodious for hawking, hunting, wood, waters, and all maner of pleasures. Perigort in France is barren, yet by reason of the excellency of the Aire, and such pleasure that it affords, much inhabited by the Nobility; as Noremberge in Germany, Toledo in Spaine. Our Countriman Tusser will tell vs so much, that the fieldone is for profit, the woodland for pleasure & health, the one commonly a deep clay, the other a dry sand: provision may be had elswhere, and our townes are generally bigger in the woodland then the fieldone, more frequent and populous, & Gentlemen more delight to dwel in such places.

                     Wullerton in Nottingamshire, is much to be commended (though the tract be sandy barren

The best building for health according to him is

                     and in an excellent prospect. P. Crescentius in his 1. lib. de Agric. cap. 5. is very copious in this subiect, how a house should be wholsomly sited, in a good coast, good Aire, wind &c. Varro de re rust. lib. 1. cap. 12.

                     Cato saith, & his dwelling next to Hell it selfe saith Columellae, he commends the middle of an hill vpon a descent. Baptista Porta Villae lib. 1. cap. 22. censures Varro, Cato, Columella, and those ancient Rusticks, approuing many things, disallowing some, and will by al means haue the front of an house stand to the South, which how it may be good in Italy I know not, in our Northerne Countries I am sure it is best. Stephanus a Frenchman praedio rustic. lib. 1. cap. 4. subscribes to this, approuing especially the Descent of an hill South or South-East, with trees to the North, so that it be well watered, a condition in all sites, which must not be omitted, as Herbastein inculcates lib. 1.

of our citty, towne, village, yet by artificiall means it may be helped. In hote countries therfore they make the streets of their cities very narrow, all ouer Spaine, Africke, Greece, and many cities of France, in Languedocke especially, & Provence, those Southerne parts: Montpelier the habitation and Vniversity of Physitians is so built, with high houses, narrow streets, to keep out these scaulding beames, which Tacitus commends lib. 15. Annal. as most agreeing to their health,

In our Northerne countries we are opposite, we commend straight, broad, faire streets, as most befitting and agreeing to our Clime.

The best site for a chamber windowes in my Iudgment are North, East, South, & which is the worst, West. Levinus Lemnius lib. 3. cap. 3. de occult. nat. mir. attributes so much to Aire, and rectifying of wind and windowes, that he holds it alone sufficient to make a man sick or well, to alter body and mind. A cleare Aire cheares vp the spirits, exhilerates the mind, a thicke, blacke, misty, tempestuous contracts, ouerthrowes. Great heed is therefore to be taken at what times we walke, how we place our windowes, lights & houses, how we let in or exclude this ambient Aire. The Aegyptians to avoid immoderat heat, make their windowes on the top of the house like chimnies, with two tunnels to draw

a through Aire. In Spaine they commonly make great opposite windowes without glasse, still shutting those which are next to the Sun: many excellent means are invented to correct Nature by Art. If none of these wayes help, the best way is to make an artificiall Aire, which howsoeuer, is profitable & good, and that is still to be made hot and moist, & to be seasoned with sweet perfumes,

Montaltus idem cap. 26. olfactus verum suduium Laurentius c. 8. and as light as may be, to haue roses and violets, and sweet smelling flowres still in their windowes, posies in their hands. Laurentius commends water lillies, a vessell of warme water still to evaporate in the roome, which wil make a more delightsome perfume, if there be added Orange flowres, pils, citrons, Rosemary, cloues, bayes, Rose-water, Rose vineger, Belzoin, Ladanum, Styrax, and such like gummes, which make a pleasant and acceptable perfume.

And although our ordinary aire be good by nature or art, yet it is not amisse as I haue said, still to change it, no better Physick for a melancholy man then change of aire, and variety of places, to travel abroad, and see fashions.

                  Of these labors, exercises and recreations which are likewise included, some properly belong to the Body, some to the mind, some more easy, some hard, some with delight, some without, some within doores, some naturall, some are artificiall. Amongst bodily exercise Galen commends ludum parvae pilae, to play at ball, be it with the hand or racket, in tennise courts or otherwise, it exerciseth each part of the Body, and doth much good, so that they sweat not too much.

                     Fowling is more troublesome, but all out as delightsome to some sorts of men, be it with guns, lime, nets, gins, strings, pitfals, pipes, calls, stawking-horses, setting dogges &c. or otherwise, some much delight to take Larkes with day-nets, small birds with chaffe-nets, plouers, partridge, Herons, snite &c. Henry the third, King of Castile, as Mariana the Iesuite reports of him lib. 3. cap. 7. was much affected

                     with catching of quailes, and many Gentlemen take singular pleasure at morning and euening to goe abroad with their Quailpipes, and will take any paines to satisfie their delight in that kind. Tycho Brahe that great Astronomer, in the Chorography of his Isle of Huena, and castle of Vraniburge, puts downe his nets, and the manner of his catching of small birds, as an ornament, and a recreation, wherein he himselfe was sometimes imployed.
                  
                     Fishing is a kind of hunting by water, be it by nets, weeles, boates, Angling, or otherwise, and yeelds all out as much pleasure to some men, as dogs, hawkes.
                        Non minorem voluptatem animo capiunt quam qui feras insectantur aut missis canibus comprehendunt, quum retia trahentes squamosas pecudes in ripas adducunt.
                      
                     When they draw their Fish vpon the banke, saith Nic. Henselius Silesiographiae cap. 3, speaking of that extraordinary delight his countrymen took in Fishing, and in making of pooles. Iames Dubravius that Moravian in his book de pisc. telleth, how travelling by the highwayes side in Silesia, he found a Nobleman 
                        More piscatorum cruribus ocreatus.
                     
                     booted vp to the groines, and wading himself, pulling the nets, and laboring as much as any fisherman of them all: and when some be like obiected to him the basenesse of his office, he excused himself, 
                        Si principis venatio leporis non sit inhonesta, nescio quomodo piscatio cyprianorum videri debeat pudenda.
                     
                     that if other men might hunt hares, why should not he hunt carpes? Many Gentlemen in like sort with vs, will wade vp to the armeholes vpon such occasions, & voluntarily vndertake that to satisfie their pleasure, which a poore man for a good stipend would scarce be hired to vndergoe. Plutarch in his book de soler animal. speakes against all Fishing, 
                        Omninò turpis piscatio nullo studio digna illiberalis credita est, quod nullum habet ingenium, nullam perspicaciam.
                      
                     as a filthy, base, illiberall imployment, as hauing neither wit nor perspicacy

in it not worth the labor. But he that shall but consider the variety of baites, and pretty devices which our Anglers haue invented, peculiar lines, false flyes, severall sleights &c. will say, that it deserues as much commendation, requires as much study, and perspicacy as the rest, and much to be preferred before many of them. Because hawking and hunting are very laborious, much riding, and many dangers accompany them, but this is still and quiet: & if so be the Angler catch no fish, yet he hath a wholesome walke to the brooke side, pleasant shade, by the sweet siluer streams, he hath fresh aire, & sweet smels of fine fresh meddow flowres, he heares the melodious harmony of birds, he sees the swannes, herons, duckes, waterhens, cootes &c. and many other fowle with their brood, which he thinketh better then the noyse of hounds, or blast of hornes, and all the sport that they can make.
                  Many other sports and recreations there be, much in vse, as Ringing, bowling, shooting, which Askam commends in a iust volume, and hath in former times bin inioyned by Statute, as a defensiue exercise, and an

Keelpins, tronkes, coits, pitching barres, hurling, wrestling, wasters, foot-ball, quintans &c. and many such, which are the common recreations of country folkes. Riding of great horses, running at ring, tilts and turnaments, horse-races, wilde-goose chases, which are the disports of greater men, and good in themselues, though many Gentlemen by that meanes, gallop quite out of their fortunes.

by a riuer side, to disport in some pleasant plaine, or runne vp a steepe hill, or sit in a shady seat, must needs bee a delectable recreation. S. Bernard in his description of his Monastery, is almost rauished with the pleasures of it. A sicke

The same confessions I finde in Herbastein, Portae, Camerarius, and many others that haue written of that subiect.

All seasons almost, and al places haue their seuerall pastimes, some in Somer, some in Winter, some abroad, some within, some of the body, some of the mind, & seuerall men haue their seuerall recreations, exercises.

                     Severus vsed Partridges and Quailes, and to keepe Birds in Cages, with which he was much pleased, when at any time he had leasure from publike cares, and businesse. He had, saith Lampridius tame Phesants, Ducks, Partridges, Peacocks, & some 20000 Ringdoues and Pigeons. Busbequins the Emperours Oratour, when he lay in Constantinople, and could not stirre much abroad, kept, to recreat his mind, and busie himselfe to see them fed, almost all manner of strange Birds and Beasts; This was something though not to exercise his body, yet to busie his mind. Conradus Gesner at Zuricke in Suitzerland kept so likewise for his pleasure a great company of wilde beasts, and as he saith himselfe, tooke great delight to see thē eat their meat. Turkie Gentlewomen that are perpetuall prisoners, still mewed vp according to the custome of the place, haue little else besides their houshold businesse, or to play with their childrē to driue away time, but to dally with their Cats, which they haue in delitijs, as many of our Ladies and Gentlewomen vse Monkies, and little Dogs. The ordinary recreations which we haue in Winter, & in most solitary times busie our minds with, are Cardes, Tables, and Dice, Shouelboard, Chesse-play, the Philosophers game, small truncks, musicke, masks, singing, dancing, vlegames, catches, purposes,

                     Chess-play is a good exercise of the mind, for some kind of men, and fit for such melancholy, as Rhasis holds, as are Idle, and haue extrauagant impertinent thoughts, or are troubled with cares, nothing better to distract their minde, and alter their meditations: but if it proceed from overmuch study, in such case it may doe more harme then good, it is a game too troublesome for some mens braines, too full of anxiety, all out as bad as study, and besides it is a testy, cholericke game, and very offensiue to him that looseth the Mate.

                     William the Conquerer in his younger yeares playing at Chesse with the Prince of France. (Dauphine was not annexed to the Crowne of France in those dayes) loosing a Mate knocked the Chess-board about his pate, which was a cause afterward of much enmity betwixt them. For some such reason it is belike, that Patritius in his 3. booke Tit. 12. de reg. institut. forbids his Prince to play at Chesse, hauking & hunting, riding &c. he will allow of, and this to other men, but by no meanes to him. In Muscouy where they liue in Stoues & hot-houses all winter long, and come seldome or little abroad, it is again very necessary, & therefore in those parts, saith •

A sport fit for idle Gentlemen, and Souldiers in Garrison, and Courtiers that haue naught but loue matters to busie themselues about, but not altogether so convenient for such as are students. The like I may say of Cl. Bruxers Phylosophy game, D Fulks metromachia, Ouranomachia, and the rest of those curious games.
                  
                     Dancing, Singing, Masking, Mumming, Stage-playes, howsoeuer they be heauily censured by some seuere Catoes, yet if opportunely and soberly vsed, may iustly be approued. Melius est fodere quam saltare, saith Austin, but what is that if they delight in it?

I knowe these sports haue many oppugners, whole volumes writ against them, and some againe because they are now cold and wayward, past themselues, cauell at all such youthfull sports in others, as he did in the Comedy, they thinke them Illicò nasci senes, &c. Some out of preposterous zeale obiect many times triuiall arguments, and because of some abuse will quite take away the good vse, as if they should forbid wine because it makes men drunke, but in my iudgement they are too sterne; there is a time for all things, for my part I subscribe to the Kings Declaration, and was ever of that minde, those May-games, Wakes, & Whitson ales, &c.

                     to bee toyled out like an horse, t'is more then slauish infelicity, and the life of most of our hired seruants, and tradesmen elsewhere (excepting his Vtopians) but halfe the day allotted for worke, and halfe for honest recreations, or what soeuer imployment they shall thinke fit themselues. If one halfe day in a weeke were allotted to our ordinary Servants, for their merry meetings by their hard masters, or in a yeare some feasts, like those Roman Saturnals, I thinke they would labour harder all the rest of the yeare, and both parties would better bee pleased; but this needs not you will say, for some of them doe naught but loiter all the weeke long.
                  This which I ayme at, is for such as are Fracti animis, troubled in mind, to ease them, overtoyled on the one part to refresh; over idle on the other, to keepe themselues busied. And to this purpose as any labour or imployment will serue to the one, any honest recreation will conduce to the other; of which, as there be divers sorts & peculiar to seuerall callings, ages, sexes, conditions, so there be proper for severall seasons and those of seuerall natures, to fit that variety of humours which is amongst men, that if one will not, another may take place, some in Somer, some in Winter, some gentle, some more violent; some for the minde alone, some for body and mind; some without, some within doores; new, old, &c. as the season serueth, and as men are inclined. It is reported of Philip. Bonus that good Duke of Burgundy, by Lodov. Vives in epist. and Pont. Heuter in his history, that the said Duke at the marriage of Eleonora sister to the king of Portugall at Bruges in Flaunders, which was solemnised in the deepe of Winter; when as by reason of vnseasonable weather he could neither hauke nor hunt, and was now tired with cards, dice, &c. and such other domesticall sports, or to see Ladies dance with

some of his Courtiers, he would in the Euening walke disguised all about the Towne. It so fortuned as he was walking late one night he found a country fellow dead drunke, snorting on a Bulke, he caused his followers to bring him to his pallace, and there stripping him of his old clothes, and tyring him after the Court fashion, when he waken
                        •
                     d, he and they were all ready to attend vpon his Excellency, and perswaded him he was some great Duke. The poore fellow was serued in state all day long, after supper he saw them dance, heard musicke, and all the rest of those Court-like pleasures, but late at night when he was well tipled and againe fast asleepe, they put on his old robes, and so conuayed him to the place where they first found him. And the fellow had not made them so good sport the day before, as he did now whē he returned to himselfe, all the iest was to see how he
                        Quid interest, saith Lodov. Vives, betwivt this one dayes dreame and all our life. looked vpon it. In conclusion, after some little admiration the fellow told his friends he had seene a vision, and constantly beleeued it, and would not otherwise be perswaded, and so the iest ended.H. Stephan. praefat. Herado.i 
                     Antiochus Epiphanes would often disguise himselfe, and steale from his Court, & goe into Marchants, Goldsmiths, and other tradesmens shoppes, and sit and talke with them, and sometimes ride and walke alone, and fall aboord with any Tinker, Clowne, Seruingman, Carrier, or whomsoeuer he met first. Sometimes he would ex insperato, giue a poore fellow mony to see how he would looke, or on set purpose loose his purse as he went, to watch who found it, & withall how he would be affected, and with such obiects hee was much delighted. Many such tricks are ordinarily put in practise by great men, to exhilerate themselues and others, all which are harmelesse iests, and haue their good vses.
                  But amongst all those Exercises, or recreations of the mind within doores, there is none so generall, so aptly to be applyed to all sorts of men, so fit and proper to expell Idlenesse and Melancholy, as that of Studye. To read, walke and see Mappes, Pictures, Statues, old Coynes of severall sorts in a fayre Gallery, arteficiall workes, perspectiue glasses, old reliques,

Roman antiquities, variety of colors. A good picture is muta poësis, and though, as3. De Anima.
                      
                     Vives saith, artificialia delectant, sed mox fastidimus, artificiall toyes please but for a time yet who is he that will not be moued to see those well furnished Galleries of those Roman Cardinals, so wel stored with all moderne Pictures, old statues and antiquities? Or in some Princes or great Noblemens houses, to see such variety of tyres, faces, so many, so rare, and such exquisite peeces of mē, birds, beasts, &c. to see those excellent landskips, and Dutch-works, curious cuts of Sadlier of Prage, Albertus Durer, Vrintes, &c. such pleasant pieces of perspectiue, Indian Pictures made of fethers, China works; frames, motions, exotick toyes, &c. Who is he that is now wholy ouercome with idlenesse, or otherwise inuolued in a Labyrinth of worldly cares, troubles, and discontents, that will not bee much lightned in his mind by reading of some inticing story, Poeme, or some pleasant bewitching discourse, which will drawe his attentiō along with it. To some kind of men it is an extraordinary delight to study, to looke vpon a Geographicall mappe, and to behold, as it were, all the remote Provinces, Townes, Citties of the world, and never to goe forth of the limits of his study, to measure by a Scale and Compasse, their extent, distance, examine their site, &c. What greater pleasure cā there be then to view those elaborate Maps of Ortelius,

To see all Birds, Beasts, and Fishes of the Sea, Spiders, Gnats, Serpents, Flies, &c. and all creatures set out by the same art, and truely expressed in liuely colours with a true description of their natures, vertues, qualities &c. as hath been accuratly performed by Aelian, Gesner, Vlysses Aldrouandus, Bellonius, Hippolitus Salvianus, &c. What more pleasing studies can there be then the Mathematickes, Theorick or Practick part. Talis est Mathematum pulchritudo, saith 
                        Lib. de cupid. divitiarum.
                      
                     Plutarch, vt his indignum sit divitiarum phaleras istas & bullas & puellaria spectacula comparari, such is the excellency of those studies, that al those ornaments and bubbles of wealth are not worthy to be compared to them, crede mihi (
                        Leon. Diggs prefat. ad perpet. prognost.
                      saith one) extingui dulce erit Mathematicarum artium studio, I could euen liue and dye with those studies,

                      and take more pleasure, true content of mind in them, then thou dost in all thy wealth, how rich soeuer thou art. The like pleasure there is in all other studies, to such as are truely addicted to them, as well may witnesse those many laborious houres, dayes, and nights, spent in the voluminous Treatises written by them; the like content.

                     Iulius Scaliger was so much affected with Poetry, that hee brake out into a patheticall protestation, that he had rather be the author of such twelue verses in Lucan, then Emperour of Germany. Seneca prefers Zeno & Chrysippus two doting Stoicks (he was so much enamored on their workes) before any Prince or generall of an army, such content there is in study.

                     K. Iames 1605, when he came to visit our Vniuersity of Oxford, & amongst other aedifices, now came to see that famous Library renued by Sr 
                     Thomas Bodley, in imitation of Alexander, at his departure brake out into that noble speech, If I were not a King I

would be a Vniuersity man.
                        Si vnquam mihi in fatis sit vt captivus ducar si mihi daretur optio hoc cuperem carcere concludi his catenis illigari cum hisce captivis concatenatis aetatem agere.
                      
                     And if it were so that I must be a prisoner, if I might haue my wish, I would desire to haue no other prison then that Library, and to bee chained together with my fellow writers. So sweet is the delight of study, the more learning they haue (as he that hath a dropsie, the more hee drinks the thirstier he is) the more they couet to learne, & the last day is prioris discipulus, harsh at first, radices amarae, but fractus dulces, according to that of Isocrates, the more they are inamored with the Muses. Hensius the keeper of the Library at Leiden in Holland, was mewed vp in it all the yeare long, and that which to their thinking should haue bred a lothing, caused in him a greater liking. 
                        Epist. Primiero plerum
                              
                                 
                              
                              que
                            in Bibliothecam me confero in quâ simulac pedem posui foribus pessulum obdo, ambitionem autem amorem libidinem &c. excludo quorum parens estignavia, imperitiae nutrix & in ipso aeternitatis gremio inter tot illustres animas sedē mihi sumo, tam ingenti quidem animo, vt subinde magnatum me miseriaet, qui faelicitatem hanc ignorant.
                      
                     I no sooner, saith he, come into the Library, but I bolt the doore to me, excluding lust, ambition, avarice, and all such vices, whose nurse is idlenesse the mother of ignorance, and melancholy her selfe, and in the very lap of aeternity, amongst so many divine soules I take my seat, with so lofty a spirit and sweet content, that I pitty all our great ones, and richmen that knowe not this happinesse. Whosoeuer he is therefore that is ouerrunne with solitarinesse, or carried away with pleasing melancholy and vaine conceits, and for want of imployment knowes not how to spend his time, or crucified with worldly care, I can prescribe him no better a remedy then this of study, to compose himselfe to the learning of some art or science. Provided alwaies that his malady proceed not from overmuch study, for in such cases hee addes fuell to the fire, and nothing can bee more pernitious; let him take heed he doe not outstretch his wits, and make a Skeleton of himselfe; or such Inamoratoes as read nothing but play-bookes, Idle Poems, Iests, Amadis de Gaul, the Knight of the Sun, the seauen Champians, Palmerin de Oliua, Huon of Burdeaux, &c. Such many times proue in the ende as mad as Don Quixot. Study is only prescribed those that are otherwise idle, troubled in mind, and carried headlong with vaine thoughts and Imaginations, to distract their cogitations (although variety of study, or some serious subiect would doe the former no harme) and diuert their continuall

meditations another way. Nothing in this case better then study, semper aliquid memoritèr ediscant, saith Piso, let them learne something without booke, or read some booke. Read the Scripture which Hiperius lib. 1. de quotid. script. lev. fol. 77. holds auailable of it selfe,
                        Animus elevatur inde à curis multâ quiete & tranquilitate fruens.
                      
                     the minde is erected thereby from all worldly cares, and hath much quiet and tranquillity. Paule bids pray cōtinually, quod cibus corpori lectio animae facit, saith Seneca, as meat is to the Body, such is reading to the Soule. 
                        Otium sine literis mors est, et vivi hominis sepultura. Seneca.
                     
                     To be at leasure with out bookes is a another Hell, and to be buried aliue.

                     Cardan calls a Library the physicke of the soule, 
                        Fortem reddunt animum & constantem & pium colloquium non permittit animum absurdá cogitatione torqueri.
                     
                     Divine authors fortifie the minde, make men bold & constant, and (as Hyperius addes) godly conference will not permitte the minde to be tortured with absurd cogitations. Rhasis inioynes continuall conference to such melancholy men, and would haue some body still talke seriously, or dispute with them, & sometimes
                        Altercationibꝰ vtantur quae non permittunt animum submergi profundis cogitationibus de quibus otiose cogitat & tristatur in ijs.
                      
                     to cauell and wrangle (so that it breake not out to a violent perturbation) for such alteration is like stirring of a dead fire to make it burne a fresh, it whets a dull spirit, and will not suffer the minde to be drowned in such profound cogitations which melancholy men are commonly troubled with.

What shall Austin, Cyprian, Gregory, Bernards divine meditations afford vs? Nay, what shall the Scripture it selfe? which is like an Appothecaries shop, wherein are remedies for all infirmities of body and mind, purgatiues, alteratiues,

coroboratiues, lenitiues, &c. Every disease of the Soule, saith
                        In Ps. 36. omnis morbus animi in Scripturis habet medicinā tantum opus est vt qui sit aeger non recuset potionem, quam Deus temperavit.

                     continually to read the Scripture, and to meditate on that which he hath read: for as mastication is to meat, so is meditation on that which we read. I would for these causes with him that is melancholy, to vse both humane and diuine authors, voluntary to impose some taske vpon himselfe, to diuert his melancholy thoughts. To study the art of memory, Cosmus Rosselius, Pet. Rauennas, Scenkelius detectus, &c. that will aske a great deale of attention, or let him demonstrate a proposition in Euclide in his 5. last bookes, extract a square root, or study Algebra, Napiers Logarithmes, or calculate spaericall Triangles, cast a Natiuity, or goe read Suisset the Calculators workes, Scaliger de Emendatione temperum, till he vnderstand it, read Scotus or Suarez. Metaphysicks, or schoole Diuinity, Occam, Entisberus, Durand, &c.

If such voluntary tasks, pleasure and delight, or crabbednesse of such studies will not yet diuert their idle thoughts, and alienate their imaginations, they must be compelled, saith Christopherus à Vega, cogi debent, lib. 3. cap. 14. Vpon some mulct, if they performe it not, ex officio incumbat, or losse of credit or disgrace, such as are our publike Vniuersitie exercises; for as he that plaies for nothing will not heed his game no more will voluntary imployment so throughly affect a student, except he be very intent of himself, & take an extraordinary delight in the study about which he is conuersant; it must be of that nature his businesse, which volens nolens he must necessarily vndergoe, & without great losse

An excellent inuention to keepe them from Idlenesse, that are by nature melancholy and past all affaires, to say so many Paternosters, Avemaries, Creedes, if it were not prophane and superstitious. In a word, Body and minde must be both exercised, not one but both, and that in mediocrity; otherwise it will cause a great inconvenience. If the Body be ouertired, it tyres the mind. The minde oppresseth the Body; as with Students oftentimes it falleth out, who as

                     two or three houres after supper, when as the meat is now setled at the bottome of the stomacke, and t'is good to lye on the right side first, because that at that site the liver doth rest vnder the stomacke, not molesting any way but heating him as a fire doth a kettle, that is put to it. After the first sleepe t'is not amisse to lye on the left side, that the meat may the better descend: and sometimes againe on the belly, but neuer on the backe. Seauen or eight houres is a competent time for a melancholy man to sleep, as Crato thinks; but as many doe, to ly in bed and not sleepe, a day or halfe a day together, and giue way to pleasing conceits and vaine imaginations, is many waies pernitious. To procure this sweet moistning sleepe, is first to take away the occasions (if it be possible) that hinder it, and then to take such inward or outward remedies, which may cause it. Heat and drynesse must first be remooued,

                     Ranzovius would haue them, if it be in warme weather, to rise and walke three or foure turnes, till they be cold, about the chamber, and then goe to bed againe.
                  Against fearefull and troublesome dreames, Incubus and such inconveniences, wherewith Melancholy men are molested, the best remedy is to eat a light supper, & of such meats as are easy of digestion, no hare, venison, beese &c. not to lye on his back, not to meditate or think in the day time of any terrible obiects, or especially talke of them before he goes to bed. For as he said in Lucian after such conference, Hecates somniare mihi videor, I can think of nothing but hobgoblins: and as Tully notes,

                        Feare and Sorrow are especially to be avoided, and the mind to be mitigated with mirth, constancy, good hope, all vaine terrors, bad obiects are to be remoued, and all such persons in whose companies they be not well pleased. Gualter Bruel-Fernelius consil. 43. Mercurialis consil. 6. Piso, Iacchinus cap. 15. in 9. Rhasis, Capivaeccius, Hildisheim &c. all inculcate this as an especiall meanes of their cure, that their

                        The Bodies mischiefs as Plato proues, proceed from the Sòule: and if the minde be not first satisfied, the Body can neuer be cured. Crato in that often cited Counsell of his for a Nobleman his patient, when he had sufficiently informed him in diet, aire, exercise, Venus, sleep, concludes with these as matters of greatest moment, quod reliquum est animae accidentia corrigantur, from which alone proceedes Melancholy, they are the fountaine, the subiect, the hinges wheron it turnes, & must necessarily be reformed.

Many are fully cured when they haue seene or heard &c. inioy their desires, or be satisfied in their mindes; and Galen the common master of them all, from whose fountaine they fetch water, brags lib. 1. de san. tuend. that he for his part hath cured many of this infirmity, solum animis ad rectū institutis, by right setling of their mindes.

But he may choose whether he will giue way too farre vnto it, he may in some sort correct himselfe. A Philosopher was bitten with a mad dog, and as the nature of that disease is to abhorre all waters, and liquid things, and to thinke still they see the picture of a dog before them: He went for all this reluctante se to the Bathe, and seeing there as he thought in the water, the picture of a dog, with reason ouercame this conceipt, quid cani cum balneo? what should a dog doe in a bathe, a meeee conceipt. Thou thinkest thou hearest and seest divels, black men &c. t'is not so, t'is thy corrupt phantasy, settle thy Imagination thou art well. Thou thinkest thou hast a great nose, thou art sick, every man laughes thee to scorne, perswade thy selfe t'is no such matter, this is feare onely and vain suspition. Thou art discontent, thou art sad and heavy, but why, vpon what ground? consider of it, thou art ielous, timorous, suspitious, for what cause? examine it throughly, thou shalt finde none at all, or such as is to be contemned, such as thou thy selfe wilt deride, and condemne in thy selfe, when it is past. Rule thy selfe then with reason, satisfie thy selfe, accustome thy selfe, weane thy selfe from those fond conceipts, vaine feares, strong Imaginations, restlesse thoughts. Thou maist doe it, Est in vobis assuescere, as Plutarch saith, we may frame our selues as we will.

Voluntarily thou wilt not doe this or that which thou oughtest to doe, or refraine &c. but when thou art lashed like a dull Iade, thou wilt reforme it, feare of a whip will make thee doe or not doe. Doe that voluntary then which thou canst doe, and must doe by compulsion: thou maist refraine if thou wilt, and master thine affections.

If the heart will not lay aside those vitious motions, and the phantasy those fond Imaginations, we haue another forme of gouernment, to enforce & restrain our outward members, that they be not led by our passions. If appetite will not obey, let the Mouing faculty ouerrule her, let her resist, and compell her to doe otherwise. As in an ague, the Appetite could drinke, sore eyes that itch would be rubbed; but Reason saith no, and therefore the Mouing faculty will not doe it. Our Phantasy would intrude a thousand feares, suspitions, Chimeras vpon vs, but we haue reason to resist, yet we let our Reason be ouerborne by our appetite.

                        Imagination enforceth spirits, which by an admirable league of Nature, compell the nerues to obey, and they our seueral lims; we giue way to our passions. And as to him that is sicke of an ague, all things are distastefull and vnpleasant, non ex cibi vitio saith Plutarch, not in the meat, but in our taste, so many things are offensiue to vs, not of themselues, but out of our corrupt Iudgment, ielousy, suspition, and the like, we pull these mischiefes vpon our own heads.
                     If then our Iudgment be so depraued, our reason ouer-ruled, Will precipitated, that we cannot seeke our own good, or moderate our selues, as in this Disease commonly it is, our best way for ease is to impart our misery to some friend, not to

If they see a man idle, that by reason of his meanes otherwise, will be take himself to no course of life, they ought seriously to admonish him, he makes a noose to intangle himself, his want of imploiment will be his vndoing. If he haue sustained any great losse, suffered a repulse, disgrace &c. if it be possible relieue him. If

he desire ought, let him be satisfied, and if it may conveniently be, giue him his hearts content. If that may not be hoped or expected, yet ease him with comfort, chearefull speeches, faire promises, and good words, perswade him, advise him. Many saith

As Imagination, feare, griefe, cause such passions, so conceipts alone, rectified by good hope, counsell &c. are able again to help: and t'is incredible how much they can doe in such a case, as

Porphyrius the Philosopher in Plotinus life, written by him, relates of himselfe, that being in a discontented humor through vnsufferable anguish of mind he was going to make a way himselfe, but meeting by chance his master Plotinus, who perceiuing by his distracted lookes all was not well, vrged him to confesse all vnto him; which when he had heard, he vsed such comfortable speeches to him, that he redeemed him è faucibus Erebi, pacified his vnquiet mind, in so much, that he was easily reconciled to himselfe, and much abashed

to thinke afterwards that he should euer entertaine so vile a motion. By all meanes therefore, all maner of faire promises, good words, gentle perswasions are to be vsed, not to be to rigorous at first,

Another thought his nose so big, that he should dash it against the wals if he stirred; his Physitian took a great peece of flesh, and holding it in his hand, pinched him by the nose, and made him beleeue that flesh was cut from it. Forestus observat. lib. 1. had a melancholy patient, who thought he was dead,

Scaliger exercit. 302. giues a reason of these effects,

And what young man is not? As it is acceptable to most, so especially to a melancholy man. Provided alwaies, his disease proceed not originally from it, that he be not some light inamorato, some idle phantasticke, who capers in conceit all day long, and thinks of nothing else, but

how to make Gigges, Sonnets, Madrigals in commendation of his Mistresse. In such cases Musicke is most pernitious, as a spurre to a free horse, it will make him runne himselfe blind or breake his wind, it will make such melancholy persons mad, and the sound of those Gigges & Horne-pipes, will not be remoued out of their eares a weeke after. Many men are melancholy by hearing musicke, but it is a pleasant melancholy that it causeth, and therefore to such as are discontent, in woe, feare, sorrow, or deiected, it is a most present remedy, it expells cares, alters their grieued minds, and easeth in an instant.

                     MIrth and merry company may not bee separated from Musicke, both concurring and necessarily required in this businesse. Mirth saith

                            Gomesius praefat. lib. 3. de sael. gen. is a great magnifier of honest mirth, by which (saith he) we cure many passions of the mind in our selues, & in our friends, which

                        Mesue procure mirth to such men, in such things as are heard, seene, tasted, or smelled or any way perceaued, and let them haue all entisements & faire promises, the sight of excellent beauties, tiars, ornaměts, delightsome passages, to distract their minds from feare and sorrow, and such things on which they are so fixed and intent.

                            Let them vse Hunting, sports, playes, iests, merry company, as Rhasis prescribes, which will not let the minde to be molested, a cup of good drinke now and then, heare musicke and such companions, with whom they are especially delighted, or such sports.

                        Merry tales, or toyes, singing, dancing, and whatsoeuer else may procure mirth: and by no means
                           Praecipue valet ad expellendam melancholiam stare in cantibus, ludis & sonis & habitare cum familiaribus & praecipue cum puellis iocundis.
                        , saith Guianerius, suffer them to be alone. Benedictus Victorius Faventinus in his Empericks, accounts it an especiall remedy against Melancholy, to heare and see singing, dancing, maskers, mummers, to converse with such merry fellowes, and faire maides. Not to bee an auditor only, or a spectator, but sometimes an Actor himselfe. Dulce est desipere in loco, to play the foole now & then is not amisse, there is a time for all things. Socrates himselfe would be mery sometimes, and sing, and dance, and take his liquór too, or else Theodoret belies him, and old Cato and the rest. Xenophon in his Sympos. brings in Socrates as a principall actor, no man merrier then himselfe, and sometimes he would ride a cockhorse with his children, though

                        sometimes play the most egregious foole in his carriage, and was so much giuen to iesters, players, and childish sports to make himselfe merry, that he that should but consider his gravity on the one part, his folly and lightnesse on the other, would surely say that there were two distinct persons in him. And me thinks he did well in it, though

                     SVBSECT. 1. A Consolatary Digression, containing the Remedies of all maner of Discontents.
                     BEcause in the praecedent Section, I haue made mention of good counsell, comfortable speeches, perswation, how necessarily they are required to the cure of a discontented or troubled mind, how present a remedy they yeeld, and many times a sole sufficient cure of themselues; I haue thought fit in this following Section a little to Digresse, (if at least it bee to digresse in this subiect) and to collect and gleane a few remedies, and comfortable speeches out of our best Orators, Philosophers, Diuines, and Fathers of the Church, tending to this purpose. I confesse many haue copiously written of this subiect, Plato, Seneca, Plutarch, Xenophon, Epictetus, Theophrastus, Xenocrates, Crantor, Lucian, Boëthius, and so of late, Sadoletus, Cardan, Budeus, Stella, Petrarch, Erasmus,
                        
                           Lib. de lib. propriis Hos libros scio multos spernere, nam faelices his se non indigere putant, infaelices ad solatium miseriae non sufficere. Et tamen faelicibus moderationem, dum inconstantiam humanae faelicitatis docent praestant, infaelices si omnia rectè aestimare velint faelices reddere possunt.
                         besides Austin, Cyprian, Bernard. &c. And I shall but actum agere, yet because these Tracts are not so obuious and common, I will Epitomise and briefly insert some of their diuine precepts, reducing their voluminous and vast Treatises to my small scale, for it were otherwise impossible to bring so great vessels into so small a creeke. And although (as Cardan said of his booke de consil:) I knowe before hand, this Tract of mine many will contemne and reiect: they that are fortunate, happy, and in flourishing estate, haue no need of such consolotary speeches; they that are miserable and vnhappy, thinke them vnsufficient to ease their grieued minds, & comfort their misery. Yet I will goe on, for this must needs doe some good to such as are happy, to bring them to a moderation, and make them reflect on and knowe themselues, by seeing the vnconstancy of humane felicity, others misery: and to such as are distressed,

if they will but attend and consider of it, it cannot chuse but giue some content and comfort. 
                           Nullum medicamentum omnes sanare potest, sunt affectus animi qui prorsus sunt insanabiles, non tamen artis opus sperni debet, aut medicine, aut Philosophiae.
                         
                        T'is true no medicine can cure all diseases, some affections of the mind are altogether incurable, yet these helps of art, Physicke and Phylosophy must not be contemned. Arrianus and Plotinus are stiffe in the contrary opinion, that such precepts can doe little good, but sure I thinke they cannot chuse but doe some, and vpon that hope I will aduenture.
                           Hor.
                         
                        Non mens hie sermo, sed quem precepit. Not my speech this, but of Seneca, Plutarch, Epictetus, Austin, Bernard, Christ and his Apostles. If I make nothing, as

                        Montagne said in like case, I wil marre nothing, t'is not my doctrine but my study, & I hope I shall doe no body wrong to speak what I thinke, & shall not be blamed in imparting my mind. If it be not for thy ease, it may for mine owne, so Tully, Cardan, and Boethius writ de consol. as well to helpe themselues as others, be it as it will, I will assay.
                     Discontents and grieuances are either generall or particular: generall are warres, Plagues, dearths, fires, inundations, vnseasonable weather, Epidemicall diseases which afflict whole kingdomes, territories, citties: or peculiar to priuate men,

but not their good gifts, fortunes, benefits, which they haue, to ruminate on their aduersity, but not once to think on their prosperity, not what they haue, but what they want, to look still on them that goe before them, but not on those infinite numbers that come after them.

Deformities and imperfections of our bodies, as lamenesse, crookednesse, deafenesse, blindnesse, be they innate or accidentall torture many men: yet this may comfort them, that those imperfections of the body doe not a whit blemish the soule, or hinder the operations of it, but rather help and much increase it. Thou art lame of Body, deformed to the eye, yet this hinders not but that thou maist be a good, a wife, vpright honest man.

                  Basenesse of birth is a great disparagement to some men, especially if they be wealthy, beare office, and come to promotion in a commonwealth, then as 
                        Boethius lib. 2 pros. 4. huic sensus exuperat sed est pudori degener sanguis.
                      hee obserues, if their birth be not answerable to their calling, and to their fellows, they are much abashed and ashamed of them selues. Some scorne their own father and mother, deny brothers & sisters, and the rest of their kindred and friends, and will not suffer them to come neere them, when they are in their pompe, accounting it a scandall to their greatnesse, to haue such beggerly beginnings. Simon in Lucian hauing now got a little wealth, changed his name from Simon to Simonides, because there were so many beggers of his kinne, and set the house on fire where he was borne, because no body should point at it. Others buy titles and cotes of Armes, and by all meanes skrew themselues into ancient families, falsifying pedegrees, vsurping Scutchions, and all because they would not seeme to be base. The reason is, for that this Gentility is so much admired by a company of outsides, and so much honour attributed vnto it,

                      as amongst Frenchmen and Venetians the Gentry scorne the Commonalty, and will not suffer them to match with them, they depresse them, and make them as so many Asses to carry burdens. In our ordinary talke and fallings out, the most opprobrious and most scurrile name we can fasten vpon a man, or first giue, is to call him base rogue, beggarly rascall, and the like. Whereas in my iudgement this ought of all other grieuances to trouble men least, of all vanities & fopperies, to brag of gentility is the greatest; for what is it they crake so much of, and challenge such superiority, as if

they were demy-Gods? Birth? it is, non ens: a meere flash, a ceremony, a toy, a thing of naught. Consider the beginning, present estate, progresse, ending, and then tell mee what it is?

If it so fall out (as often it doth) that such pesants are preferred by reason of their

wealth, chance, error, &c. or otherwise, yet as the cat in the fable, when she was turned to a faire maid, would play with mice; a curre will be a curre, a clowne a clowne, he will likely sauor of the stock whence he came, and that innate rusticity can hardly be shaken off. And though by their education such men may be better qualified, and more refined; yet there be many symptomes by which they may likely be descried, an affected phantasticall carriage, a tayler-like sprucenes, a peculiar garbe in all their proceedings, a beggars brat will bee commonly more scornefull, imperious, insulting, insolent then another man of his ranke.

he forgets what he was, domineeres &c. and many such other symptomes he hath, by which you may know him from a true Gentleman. Many errors and obliquities are on both sides, noble, ignoble: yet still in all callings as some degenerate, some are well-deseruing, and most worthy of their honors. And as Busbequius said of Solyman the magnificent, he was tanto dignus imperio, worthy of that great Empire, many meanly descended are most worthy of their honor, and well deserue it, And many of our Nobility, (which one said of Hephaestion, Ptolomaeus, Antigonus &c. and the rest of Alexanders followers, they were all worthy to be Monarches and Generals of Armies) deserue to be Princes. Many Noblemen are an ornament to their order, many poore mens sons are singularly well endowed, and most eminent, and well-deseruing for their worth, wisdome, learning, vertue, valour, integrity, excellent members, and pillars of a common-wealth. And therefore to conclude that which first I intended, to be base by birth, meanly borne, is no such disparagement.

                     As often as you shall see a man abounding in wealth, and naught withall, I beseech you call him not happy, but esteeme him vnfortunate, because he hath many occasions offered to liue iniustly: on the other side, a poore man is not miserable, if he be good, but therefore happy, that those euil occasions are taken from him. Wherein now consists his happines, or what priviledges hath he more then other men? or rather what miseries, what cares and discontents hath he not more then other men?

                      A country man may travell from kingdome to kingdome, Province to Province, citty to citty, and glut his eyes with delightfull obiects, hauke and hunt, & vse all ordinary disports, without any notice taken, all which a Prince or a great man cannot doe. A poore man takes more delight in an ordinary meales meat, which he hath but now and then, then they doe with all their exotick dainties and continuall Viandes, quippe voluptatem comendat rarior vsus, t'is the rarity that makes a thing acceptable and pleasant: which made Epicurus sometimes voluntarily fast.

                      dishes, of fish, flesh, or whatsoeuer els, are therefore cloved, Nectar it selfe growes, loathsome to them, they are weary of all their fine palaces, they are to them but as so many prisous. A poore man drinkes in a wooden dish, and eates his meat in wooden spoones, wooden platters, earthen Vessels, and such homely stuffe: the other in gold, siluer, and pretious stones, but with what successe? in auro bibitur venenum, feare of poyson in the one, security in the other. And such is the whole tenor of their liues, and that which is the consummation and vpshot of all, death it selfe. The rich man

liues like Diues Iovially heere on Earth, make the best of it; and boastes himselfe in the multitude of his riches Psal. 49.6. & 11. he thinks his house called after his own name, shal continue for euer, but he perisheth like a beast, ver. 20. his way vtters his folly, ver. 13. malé parta, malé dilabuntur, like sheep they lye in the graue 14.

                      he dies like a hog, goes to hell with a guilty conscience, and many a poore mans curse: his memory stinkes like the snuffe of a candle when it is put out, scurrile libels, and infamous obloquies accompany him. When as poore Lazarus is Dei sacrarium, the Temple of God, liues and dies in true devotion, hath no more attendants but his own innocency, the heauen a tomb, desires to be dissolued, buried in his mothers lap, and hath a company of God shall deliuer his soule from the power of the graue, Psal. 49.15. Angels ready to convay his soule into Abrahams bosome, he leaues an euerlasting and a sweet memory behind him. Crassus and Sylla are indeed still recorded, but not so much for their wealth, as for their victories: Croesus for his end, Solomon for his wisdome.
                  But consider all those other vnknowne, concealed happinesses which a poore man hath (I call them vnknowne, because they be not acknowledged in the worlds esteeme, or so taken.) O fortunatos nimium bona si sua nôrint: but happy they are in the mean time if they would take notice of it, or make vse, or apply it to themselues. A poore man wise is better then a foolish King.

Prov. 11.5. and he that reioyceth at affliction, shall not he vnpunished. And for the rest, the poorer thou art, the happier thou art, ditior est & non melior, saith

It was no Epicurean speech of an Epicure, he that is not satisfied with a little, will neuer haue enough.

                     He that liues according to Nature, can not be poore, & he that exceedes, can neuer haue enough, totus non sufficit orbis, the whole world cannot giue him content. A small thing that the righteous hath, is better then the riches of the vngodly Psal. 37.16. & better is a poore morsell with quietnes, then abundance with strife, Prov. Be content then, enioy thy selfe: for what wantest thou to expostulate the matter?

or what hast thou not better then a rich man?

All things then being rightly examined and duly considered as they ought, there is no such cause of so generall discontent, 'tis not in the thing it selfe but in our mind, as wee moderate our passions and esteeme of things.

                  MEMB. 4. Against Servitude, losse of liberty, Imprisonment, Banishment.
                  SEruitude, losse of liberty, Imprisonment, are no such miseries as they are held to be: we are all slaues and seruants the best of vs all: as we doe reuerence our masters, so doe our masters their superiors; Gentlemen serue Nobles, & Nobles are subordinate to Kings, Omne sub regno graviore regnum, Princes themselues are Gods seruants, reges in ipsos imperium est Iovis. They are subiect to their owne lawes, and as the Kings of China, endure more then slauish imprisonment, to maintaine their state and greatnesse, they neuer come abroad. Louers are slaues to their mistris, rich men to their mony,

Courtiers to lust and ambition, and all slaues to our affections, who is free? Why then dost thou repine? Satis est potens, Hierom saith, qui servire non cogitur. Thou carriest no burdens, thou art no prisoner, no drudge, and thousands want that liberty, those pleasures which thou hast. Thou art not sicke, & what wouldst thou haue? but nitimur in vetitum, we must all eat of the forbidden fruit. Were wee enioyned to goe to such and such places, we would not willingly goe: but being barred of our liberty, this alone torments our wā
                     dering soule that we may not goe. A cittezen of ours, saith 
                        Consol. lib. 5. 
                     Cardan, was 60 yeares of age, and had never beene forth of the walls of the citty of Millan, the Prince hearing of it cō
                     manded him not to stirre out, being now forbidden that which all his life he had neglected, he earnestly desired, & being denied, dolore confectus mortem obijt, he died for griefe.
                  What I haue said of seruitude, I say againe of imprisonment. We are all prisoners. What is our 
                        O Generose, quid est vita nisi carcer animi.
                      life but a prison? We are all imprisoned in an Iland. The world it selfe to some men is a prison, our narrow seas as so many ditches, & when they haue cōpassed the Globe of the earth, they would same goe see what's done in the Moone. In

                     Aden in Arabia they are imprisoned all day long with that other extreame of heat, and keep their markets in the night. What is a ship but a prison? And so many citties are but as so many hiues of Bees? But that which thou abhorrest many seeke. Women keepe in all winter, and most part of summer to preserue their bewties, some for loue of study: Demosthenes shaued his beard because he would cut off all occasion of going abroad: how many Monks and Friers, Anachorites, abandon all the world? Monachus in vrbe piscis in arido. Art' in prison? make right vse of it, and mortifie thy selfe; 
                        Vbi verior contemplatio quam in solitudine, vbi studium solidius quam in quiete?
                      
                     Where may a man contemplate better then in solitarinesse, or study more then in quietnesse. Many worthy men haue been imprisoned all their liues, and it hath been occasion of great honor

and glory to them, much publike good by their excellent meditation. Boethius neuer writ so elegantly as in prison, Paule so deuoutly, for most of his Epistles were dictated in his bands. Ioseph, saith 
                        In Ps. 76. non ita laudatur Ioseph cum srumenta distribueret ac quum carcerem habitaret.
                      
                     Austin, got more credit in prison, then when he distributed corne, and was Lord of Pharaoh's house. It brings many a lewd fellow home, many wandring rogues it settles, that would otherwise haue been so many ranging Tygers, and haue ruinated themselues and others.
                  Banishment is no grieuance at all, Omne solum forti patria &c. & patria est vbicun

                        Boethius.
                      
                     Incolentibus patria, 'tis their country that are borne in it, and they would thinke themselues banished to goe to the place which thou leauest, and from which thou art so loth to part. T'is a childish humour to be discontent at that which others seeke, to preferre, as base Islanders and Norvegians doe their owne ragged Island, before Italy or Greece, the Gardens of the world, 'tis want of iudgement. All places are distant from heaven alike, and the Sunne shines happily as warme in one citty as in another, and to a wiseman there is no difference of climes: friends are euery where to him that behaues himselfe well, and a Prophet is not esteemed in his owne country. Alexander, Caesar, Traian, Adrian, were as so many land leapers, now in the East, now in the West, little at home, and Polus Venetus, Lod. Vertomannus, Pinzonus, Cadamistus, Columlumbus, Americus Vesputius, &c. Vascus Gama, Drake, Candish, Schouten, got al their honour by voluntary expeditions. But you say such mens trauell is voluntary, wee are compelled, and as malefactors must depart: the pleasure of peregrination, variety of obiects will make amends for it, and so many nobles Tully, Aristides, Themistocles, Theseus, Codrus, &c. as haue been banished, will giue sufficient credit vnto it.

O let me die, some good man or other make an ende of mee. How did Achilles take on for Patroclus death? a black cloud of sorrowes ouershadowed him, saith Homer. Iacob rent his clothes, and put sack-cloth about his Ioynes, and sorrowed for his sonne a long season, and would not be comforted, but would needs goe downe into the graue vnto his sonne. Gen. 37.34. Many yeares after, the remembrance of such friends, of such accidents is most grievous vnto vs, to see or heare of it, though it concerne not our selues but others. Scaliger saith of himselfe, that he neuer read Socrates death, in Platoes Phaedon, but he wept: 
                        Confess. lib. 1. 
                     Austin shed teares when he read the destruction of Troy. But howsoeuer this passion of sorrow bee violent and bitter, and seaseth familiarly on wise, valiant, discreet men, yet it may be withstood, it may be diuerted. For what is there in this life, that it should be so deare vnto vs? Or that we should so much deplore the departure of a friend? The greatest pleasures are common society, to enioy one anothers presence, feasting, hauking, hunting, woods, hills, musicke, dancing, &c. all this is but vanity and losse of time, as I haue sufficiently declared. As Alcumists spend that little which they haue to get gold and neuer find it, we lose & neglect aeternity, for a little momentary pleasure which we cannot enioy, nor shall neuer attaine to in this life. Wee abhorre death, paine and griefe, all, and yet we wil doe nothing of that

which should vindicate vs from it, but rather voluntarily thrust our selues vpon it.

'Tis both waies troublesome to me to rise and goe to bed, to eat and provide my meat, cares and contentions attend me all day long, feares and suspitions all my life, I am discontented, and why should I so much desire to liue? But an happy death will make an end of all my woes and miseries, why should not I then say with old Simeon, since I am so well affected, Lord now let thy servant depart in peace, or with Paul, I desire to be dissolved & to be with Christ.

As Socrates told Cato it concernes me not, what is done with me when I am dead. Facilis iactura sepulchri.

                     Returning out of Asia, when I sayled from Aegina toward Magera, I began (saith Servius Sulpitius in a consolatory Epistle of his to Tully) to view the country round about. Aegina was behind me, Megera before, Pyraeus on the right hand, Corinth on the left, what flourishing townes heretofore, now prostrat and overwhelmed before mine eyes. I beganne to thinke with my

selfe. Alas why are we mē so much disquieted with the departure of a friend, whose life is much shorter?

                     Wilt thou haue him crased & sickly still, or to be freed from his miseries? thou hast more need reioyce that he is gone. Another he complaines of a most sweet wife, such a wife as no mortall man euer had so good a wife: I reply to him in Senecae's words, if such a woman at least ever was to be had,
                        Vxorem bonā aut inuenisti, aut sic fecisti, si inueneris, aliam habere te posse ex hoc intelligamus: si feceris benè speres, salvus est artifex.
                      
                     He did either so finde her or make her, if he found her, he may as happily finde another; if hee made her, as Critobulus in Xenophon did by his, he may as good cheap informe another, he need not despaire, so long as the same master is to be had. But was she good? had shee beene so tried peraduenture as that Ephesian widdow in Petronius, by some swaggering souldier, she would not haue held out. Many a man would be willingly rid of his: before thou wast bound, now thou art free,
                        Stulti est compedes licet aureos amore.
                      
                     & 'tis but a folly to loue thy fetters, though they be of gold. Come into a third place you shall haue an aged father sighing for a sonne, or a forlorne sonne for his deceased father. But why? Prior exijt, prior intravit, he came first and he must goe first. What wouldst thou haue the laws of nature altered, and him to liue alwaies? Iul. Caesar, Augustus, Alcibiades, Galen, Aristotle, lost their fathers young▪ and why on the other side shouldst thou so heavily take the death of thy little sonne, was he not mortall? He was a fine childe indeed, but who can tell whether he would haue been an honest man? He might haue proued a theefe, a rogue, a spendthrift,

a disobedient child, vexed and galled thee more then all the world beside, he might haue wrangled with thee and disagreed, or with his brothers, as Eteocles, & Polynices, and broke thy heart; he is now gone to eternity as another Ganymede in the flowre of his

If hee was naught thou maist be glad he is gone, if good be glad thou hadst such a sonne. Or art thou sure he was good? It may be he was an hypocrite as many are, and howsoeuer he spake thee faire; it may be he prayed amongst the rest that Icaromenippus heard at Iupiters whispering place in Lucian, for his fathers death. Or put case he was good, suppose the best, may not thy dead sonne expostulate with thee, as hee did in the same

                     Lucian. Why dost thou lament my death, or call me miserable, that am much more happier then thy selfe, what misfortune is befalne mee? Is it because I am not bald, crooked, old, rotten, as thou art? What, haue I lost some of your good cheere, gay cloaths, singing, dancing, kissing, merry meetings, &c. is that it? Is it not much better not to hunger at all then to eat, not to thirst then to drink to satisfie thirst, not to be a cold then to put on cloaths to driue away cold? You had more need reioyce that I am freed from diseases, agues, cares, anxieties, liuor, loue, covetousnesse, hatred, enuy, malice, that I feare no more theeues, tyrants, enemies as you doe. What good doe your teares, to what end? Weepe no more then 'tis to no purpose? And as Tully aduiseth vs in the like case, Non quos amisimus, sed quantum lugere par sit cogitemus. Thinke what we doe, not whom we haue lost. So David did 2. Sam. 12.22. While the child was yet aliue, I fasted and wept, but being now dead why should I fast? can I bring him againe, I shall goe to him, but he cannot returne to me. The Thracians weept stil when a child was borne, and feasted & made mirth when any man was buried,

                      passions and Affections, there is no better remedy, then as Marriners when they goe to Sea, prouide all things necessary to resist a tempest; to furnish our selues with Philosophicall and diuine precepts: to ballance our hearts with loue, charity, meeknesse, patience, and counterpoise those irregular motions of enuy, liuor, spleene hatred, with those opposite vertues, as wee bend a crooked staffe another way. To oppose bounty to couetousnes, fortitude to pusillanimity, meeknes to anger, humility to pride, to examine our selues for what cause we are so much disquieted, on what ground, what occasion is it, a iust or a fained cause, and then either to pacifie our selues by reason, or to divert

by some other obiect or contrary passion: or as they that play at wasters, exercise themselues by a few cudgells how to avoid an enimies blowes: arme our selues against all such violent incursions, which may invade our minds. Many times we repine and mutter without cause, wee giue way to passions, we may resist and will not. Socrates was bad by nature, enuious, as he confessed himselfe, lasciuious, but as hee was Socrates, he did correct and amend himselfe. Thou art malitious, enuious, couetous, no doubt and lascivious, yet as thou art a Christian correct and moderate thy selfe.

But he was much to blame for it, to a wise staid man all this is nothing, we cannot all be honoured and rich, all Caesars, if wee can be content, our present state is good, and in some mens opinion to be preferred. Let them goe on, get wealth, offices, titles, honours, and preferments, and what they will themselues, by fraud, imposture, simony, and indirect meanes, as many doe, by bribery, flattery, and parasiticall insinuation, by impudence, and time-seruing, let them goe before, crosse me on every side,

                     Envy, trouble, anxiety, as much labour to maintaine their place with credit, as to get it at first.

                     gets he by it? to haue all his life laid open, his reproaches seen, not one of a thousand but he hath done more worthy of dispraise

and animadversion, then worthy of commendation, no better meanes to helpe this then to be private. Let them runne, ride, striue as so many fishes for a crumme, scrape, clime, catch, and snatch, cosen, and collogue, temporise and fleire, take all amongst them,

                  I May not yet conclude, or hope to remoue passions, or quiet the mind, till such time as I haue likewise remoued some other of their more eminent and ordinary causes, which produce such grieuous tortures and discontents, to remoue all I cannot hope, to point alone at some few of the chiefest, is all I ayme at.
                  
                     Repulse. 
                     Repulse and Disgrace are two maine causes of discontent,

but to an vnderstanding man not so hardly to be taken, Caesar himselfe hath beene denyed,

                      and when two stand equall in fortune, birth, and all other qualities alike, one of necessity must lose. Why should'st thou take it so grieuously? It hath beene a familiar thing for thee thy selfe to deny others. If every man might haue what he would, we should all be deified, Emperours, Kings, Princes, if whatsoeuer vain hope suggests vnsatiable appetite affects, our preposterous iudgement thinks fit, should be granted, we should haue another Chaos in an instant, a meere confusion.

It is an ordinary thing in these times to see a base, impudent asse, illiterate, vnworthy, vnsufficient to bee preferred before his betters, because hee can put himselfe forward, because he looks bigge, hath a faire outside, can temporise, collogue, insinuate, or hath good store of mony, wheras a more discreet, modest, & better deseruing man shall haue a repulse. Erasmus, Lipsius, Budaeus, Cardan, died poore, Gesner was a silly old man, baculo innixus, amōgst all those huffing Cardinals and swelling Bishopps that flourished in his time and rid on foot-cloaths. It is not learning, worth, wisdome that preferres men, but as the wise man said,

                     Iniuries are very offensiue, and so much the more in that they thinke veterem ferendo inuitant novam, by taking one they provoke another: but it is an erroneous opinion: for if that were true, there would bee no end of abusing one another, lis litem generat; 'tis much better with patience to beare or quietly to put it vp.

Many men spend themselues, their goods, friends, fortunes, vpon small quarrels, and sometimes at other mens procurements, with much vexation of spirit and anguish of minde, that with good aduise, or mediation of friends might haue beene happily composed, or if patience had taken place. Patience in such cases is a most soueraigne remedy, put it vp, conceal, or dissemble it, to

nos tale quid fecimus, quum in honore essemus, he wisely put it vp, and laid the fault where it was, in his owne pride and scorne, which in his prosperity he had formerly shewed others.By many indignities we come to dignities.

                     This is thanke worthy saith our Apostle, if a man for conscience towards God,
                     1 Pet. 2. 
                     endure griefe, and suffer wrong vndeserued: for what praise is it, if when ye be buffeted for your faults, you take it patiently? but if when you doe well, ye suffer wrong, & take it patiently, there is thankes with God, for hereunto verily were ye called. Qui mala non fert, ipse sibi testis est per impatientiam quod bonus non est, he that cannot beare iniuries, witnesseth against himself that he is no good man, as Gregory holds. 
                        Siquidem maelorum propriū est inserre damna, & honorum pedissequa est iniuria.
                      
                     T'is the nature of all wicked men to doe iniuries, as it is the property of all honest men patiently to beare them. Iniury is their foot-boy, and as a lacky, followes them wheresoeuer they goe. And if there were no other respect then of Christianity, religion and the like, to induce men to be long-suffering and patient, yet me thinks the nature of iniury it selfe, is sufficient to keep them quiet, the tumults, vproares, miseries, discontents, anguish, dangers that attend vpon it, the commō experience might stay them.

                      The more they contend, the more they are involved in a Labyrinth of woes, t'is an hydras head, the more they striue, the more they may; and as Praxiteles did by his glasse, when he saw a scurvy face in it, brake it in pieces: but for that one, he saw many more as bad in a moment: for one iniury done, they provoke another cum foenore, and twenty enemies for one. Noli irritare crabrones, oppose not thy selfe to a multitude;

Socrates was brought vpon the Stage by Aristophanes, and misused to his face, but he laughed as if it concerned him not, and as Aelian relates of him, whatsoeuer good or bad accident or fortune befell him, going in, or comming out, Socrates still kept the same countenance.

Vatinius was wont to scoffe at his own deformed feet, to prevent his enemies obloquies and sarcasmes in that kind, or els by prevention, as Cotys King of Thrace, that brake a company of fine glasses presented to him, with his own hands, lest he should be ouermuch moued when they were broken by chance.

Or that Epitome of the Law & the Prophets, which our Saviour inculcated, loue God aboue all, thy neighbour as thy selfe.

                     EVery man saith Seneca, thinkes his own burthen the heaviest, and a melancholy man aboue all others complains most, Wearines of life, abhorring all company & light; feare, sorrow, suspition, bashfulnes, and those other dread Symptomes of body and mind, must needs aggravate this misery: yet conferred to other maladies, they are not so haynous as they be taken. For first this disease is either in habit or disposition, curable or incurable. If new and in disposition, t'is commonly pleasant, and it may be helped. If inveterate, or an habite, yet they haue lucida intervalla, sometimes well, and somtimes ill. And amongst a many of inconveniences, some comforts are annexed to it. As first it is not catching, and as Erasmus cōforted himself, whē he was grievously sick of the stone, though it was most troublesome, and an intolerable pain to him, yet it was no whit offensiue to others, not lothsome to the spectators, gastly, fulsome, terrible, as plagues, Apoplexies, leprosies, wounds, sores, tetters, pestilent agues are, which either admit of no company, or terrify or offend those that are present. In this malady that which is, is wholly to themselues: and those symptomes not so dreadfull, if they be compared to the opposite extreames. They are most part bashfull, suspitious, solitary &c therefore no such ambtious, impudent intruders, as some are, no smell-feasts, praters, pā
                     ders, parasites, bawdes, drunkards, whoremasters, necessity compels them to be honest. They are freed in this from many other infirmities, solitarines makes them more apt to contemplate, suspition wary, which is a necessary humor in these times

                     Nam pol qui maximè cavet, is saepè cautor captus est, he that takes most heed, is often circumvented and overtaken. Feare and sorrow, bashfulnes keeps them temperate & sober, and frees them from many dissolute acts, which iollity and

boldnes thrust men vpon. They are no sicarij, theeues assassinates. As they are soone deiected, so they are as soone, by soft words and good perswasion ereared. If they dote in one thing they are wise and well vnderstanding in most other. If it be inveterate, they are insensati, most part doting, or quite mad, insensible of any wrongs, ridiculous to others, but most happy and secure to themselues. And Dotage is a state which many much magnifie and commend: simplicity, folly, as he said, 
                        Petronius Catal.
                      
                     hic furor ô superi, sit mihi perpetuus. Some think fooles and disards liue the merriest liues, they are not macerated with cares, tormented with feares, anxieties as other wise men are: and in some

They are no dissemblers, liers, hypocrites, for fools and madmen tell commonly truth. In a word as they are distressed, so are they pittied, which some hold better then to be envyed, better to be sad then merry, better to be miserable then happy: of two extreames it is the best.

                     AFter a long and tedious Discourse of these six non-naturall things, and their severall rectifications, all which are comprehended in Diet, I am come now at last to Pharmaceutice, or that kind of Physick which cures by medicines, which Apothecaries most part make or mingle, or sel in their shops. Many cavill at this kind of Physick, and hold it vnnecessary, vnprofitable to this or any other disease, because those countries which vse it least, liue longest, and are best in health, as

Saxo Grammaticus, Bohemus, say the like of them that liue in Norway, Lapland, Finmarke, Biarmia, Corelia, and all ouer Scandia, & those Northerne countryes, they are most healthfull, and very long liued, in which places there is no vse at all of Physick, the name of it is not once heard. Dithmarus Bleskenius in his accurate description of Island 1607, makes mention amongst other matters, of the inhabitants manner of liuing,

I find the same relation by Lerius, and some other Writers of the Indians in America. Paulus Iovius in his description of Brittaine, and Levinus Lemnius obserue as much of this our Island, that there was of old no vse almost of Physick amōgst vs, and but little at this day, except it be for a few nice citizens, surfetting courtiers,

The country people vse kitchin Physick, and common experience tels vs, that they liue freest from all manner of infirmities, that make least vse of Physick. Many are ouerthrowne by preposterous vse of it, and thereby get their bane, that might otherwise haue escaped, some think Physitians kill as many as they saue, and who can tell

                        Euery disease is either curable or incurable, a man recouers of it, or is killed by it, both wayes Physicke is to be reiected. If it be deadly, it cannot be cured, if it may be helped, it requires no Physitian, Nature will expell it of her selfe. Plato made it a great signe of an intemperate & corrupt cō
                        monwealth, where Lawyers and Physitians did abound, and the Romanes distasted them so much, that they were often banished out of their city. It is no art at all, as some hold, the beginning, practice, and progresse of it, all is naught, full of imposture, incertainty, and doth generally more harme then good. The Diuell himselfe was the first inventor of it, Inventum

est medicina meum, said Apollo, and what was Apollo but the Diuell. The Greeks first made an art of it, and they were all deluded by Apollos sonnes, priests, oracles. If we may beleeue Varro, Pliny, Columella, most of their best medicines were deriued from his oracles. Aesculapius his son had his temples erected to his Deity, and did many famous cures, but as Lactantius holds, he was a Magitian, a meere impostor, and as his successors, Phaon, Podalirius, Melampius, Menecrates (another god) by charmes, spels, and ministery of bad spirits, did most of their cures. The first that euer wrote in Physick to any purpose, was Hippocrates, and his Disciple and commentator Galen, whom Scaliger cals Fimbriam Hippocratis, but as 
                           Praefat. de contrad. med.
                         
                        Cardan censures them both, immethodicall & obscure, as all those old ones are, their precepts confused, their medicines absolete, and now most part reiected. Those cures which they did, Paracelsus holds, were rather done out of their patients confidence,

The Arabians receiued it from the Greekes, and so the Latines adding new precepts and medicines of their own, but so imperfect still either through ignorance of Professors, Impostors, Mountebanks, Empiricks, disagreeing of Sectaries, envy, couetousnes and the like, they doe much harme amongst vs. They are so different in their consultations, prescriptions, mistaking many times the parties constitution, disease and causes of it, they giue quite contrary Physick,

                        one saith this, another that, out of singularity or opposition, as he said of Adrian, multitudo medicorum principem interfecit, a multitude of Physitians hath killed the Emperour. Besides there is much imposture and malice amongst them, all arts saith

If he prescribed hote medicines,

they would prescribe cold, miscentes pro calidis frigida, pro frigidis humida, pro purgantibus astringentia, binders for purgatiues, omnia perturbabant. If the party miscarried, Curtium damnabant, then Curtius killed him, that disagreed from thē: If he recouered, then

                         they cured him themselues. Much emulation, imposture, malice there is amongst them: or if they be honest and meane wel, yet a knaue Apothecary that administers the Physick, and makes the medicine, may doe infinite harme, by their old absolete doses, adulterine drugs, bad mixtures, quid pro quo &c. see Fuchsius lib. 1. sec. 1. cap. 8. Cordus Dispensatory, and Brassiuolas examen simpl. &c. But it is their ignorance that doth most harme, their art is wholly coniecturall, vncertaine, imperfect, and got by killing of men, many diseases they cannot cure at all, as Apoplexy, Epilepsy, Stone strangury, Gowt, Tollere nodosam nescit medicina Podagram, quartan agues, a common ague somtimes stumbles them all, they cannot so much as ease, they know not how to iudge of it. If by pulses, that doctrine some hold is wholly suspitious, and I dare boldly say with

And for vrine, that is meretrix medicorum, the most deceiptfull thing of all, as Forestus and some other Physitians, haue proued at large. The most rationall of them, and most skilfull are so often deceiued, that as

                        Tholosanus inferres, I had rather beleeue & commit my selfe to a meere Empirick, then to a meere Doctor, and I cannot sufficiently commend that custome of the Babylonians, that haue no professed Physitians, but bring all their Patients to the market to be cured. Which Herodotus relates of the Aegyptians, Strabo, Sardus, and Aubanus Bohemus of many other natiōs: but I wil vrge these cavilling arguments no farther, left some Physitian should mistake me, and deny me Physick when I am sick: for my part, I am well perswaded of Physick. I can distinguish the abuse from the vse, in this and many other Arts and Sciences. I honor the name, and magnify the calling, as I am inioyned to honor the Physitian for necessities sake. The knowledge of the Physitian lifteth

vp his head, and in the sight of great men he shall be admired. The Lord hath created medicines of the earth, and he that is wise will not abhorre them, Eccles. 58.1. Only this I wil adde, that this kind of Physick is very moderatly and advisedly to be vsed vpon good occasion, when the former of Diet wil not take place. And t'is no other which I say, then that which Arnoldus prescribes in his 8 Aphoris.

                        A discreet & godly Physitian doth first endeavour to expell a disease by medicinall diet, then by pure medicine, and in his ninthe,

                        he that may be cured by Diet, must not meddle with Physick: and in his 11 Aphoris. A modest and wise Physitian will neuer hasten to vse medicines but vpon vrgent necessity, & that sparingly too: because as he addes in his 13 Aphoris.

Opium in Turkie doth scarce offend, with vs in a small quantity if stupifies, cicuta or hemblock is a strōg poison in Greece, but with vs it hath no such violent effects, so that I conclude with

Voschius, (who as he much inveyes against those Exotick medicines, so he promiseth by our European, a full cure, and absolute of all diseases à capite ad calcem.) nostrae regionis herbae nostris corporibus magis corducunt, our own simples agree best with vs. It was a thing that Fernelius much laboured in his French practice, to reduce all his cures to our proper and domestick Physick. So did Martin Rulandus in Germany, and T.B. with vs, as appeareth by a

Treatise of his divulged in our tongue 1615, to proue the sufficiency of our English medicines, to the cure of all manner of diseases. If our drugs be not altogether of such force, or so apposite, it may be, if like industry were vsed, those far-fetched drugs would prosper as well with vs, as in those countreyes whence now we haue them, as well as Cherries, Artichokes, Tobacco, and many such. There haue bin many worthy Physitians, which haue tried excellent conclusions in this kind, and many diligent, painfull Apothecaries, as Gesner, Gerard, &c but amōgst the rest those famous publike Gardēs of Padua in Italy, Noremberge in Germany, Leiden in Holland, Montpelier in France, (and ours in Oxford now in fieri, at the cost and charges of the right Honorable the Lord Dauers) are much to be cōmended, wherein all Exotick Plants almost are to be seene, and a liberall allowance yearely made for their better maintenance, that young students may be the better informed in the knowledge of them: which as

                        almost all Iewels and pretious stones, haue excellent vertues to pacifie the affections of the mind, for which cause rich men so much couet to haue them:

                     Most men say as much of Gold, and some other Minerals as these haue done of pretious stones. Erastus still maintaines the opposite part. Disputat in Paracelsum cap. 4. fol. 196. hee confesseth of Gold, 
                           Aurum laetitiam generat, non in corde, sed in arcâ avarorum.

But these are both in extreames, the middle sort approue of Mineralls, though not in so high a degree.

                        PLiny lib. 24. cap. 1. bitterly taxeth all compound medicines. Mens knavery, imposture, and captious wits haue invented these shops, in which every mans life is set to sale: and by and by came in those compositions and inexplicable mixtures, farre fetcht out of India and Arabia, a medicine for a botch must be had as farre as the red Sea, &c.

A few simples well prepared and vnderstood, are far better then such a heap of non-sense confused compoūds. Many times as Agrippa taxeth, there is by this meanes,

danger from the medicine then from the disease, when they put together they knowe not what, or leaue it to an illiterate Apothecary to be made, they cause death & horror for health. Those old Physitions had no such mixtures; a simple potion of Hellebor, in Hippocrates time was the ordinary purge, and at this day, saith

                        Mat. Riccius in that flourishing commonwealth of China, Their Physitions giue precepts quite opposite to ours, not vnhappy in their Physicke: they vse altogether roots, hearbs, and simples in their medicines, and all their physicke in a manner is comprehended in an herball, no science, no schoole, no art, no degrees, but like a trade, every man in private is instructed of his master: Let the best of our rationall Physitions demonstrat, & giue a sufficient reason of those intricate mixtures, why iust so many simples in Methredate, or Treacle, why such or such quantity, may they not be reduced to halfe, to a quarter? Frustra fit per plura (as the saying is) quod fieri potest per pauciora. 300 simples sometimes in a Iulip, potion or a little pill, to what end or purpose? I knowe what

                        Alkindus, Capivaccius, Montagna, and Simon Eitouer, the best of them all, and most rationall haue said in this kind; but nether he nor they nor any one of them, giues his Reader in my iudgement, that satisfaction which he ought, why such, so many simples. Rog. Bacon hath taxed some errors in his tract de graduationibus, explaned some things but not cleared. Mercurialis in his booke de composit, medicin. giues instance in Hamech, and Philonium Romanum, which Hamech an Arabian, and Philonius a Roman long since composed, but crassè as the rest. If they bee so exact, as by him it seemes they were, and those mixtures so perfect, why doth Fernelius alter the one, and why is the other absolete? 
                           Subtil. cap. de scientijs.
                         
                        Cardan taxeth Galen for presuming out of his ambition to correct Theriacum Andronachi, & we as iustly may taxe all the rest. Galens medicines are now exploded and reiected, and what Nicholas Meripsa, Mesve, Celsus, Scribanius, Actuarius, &c. writ of old, are now most part contemned. Mellichius, Cordus, Wecker, Quercetan, Rhenodeus, the Venetian. Florentine states haue

their seuerall receipts, and Magistralls: They of Noremberge haue theirs, and Augustana Pharmacopea, peculiar medicines to the Meridian of their citty: London hers, every Citty, Towne, almost euery priuate man hath his owne mixtures, compositions, receits, magistralls, precepts, as if hee scorned antiquity, and all others in respect of himselfe, but euery man must correct and alter to shew his skill, euery opinatiue fellow must maintaine his owne paradox, be it what it wil. Delirant reges plectuntur Achivi: they dote, and in the meane time the poore patients pay for their new experiments, and the Commonalty rue it.
                     Thus others obiect, thus I may conceaue out of the weaknesse of my apprehension, but to say truth there is no such fault, no such ambition, no nouelty, or ostentation as some suppose, but as

                         one answers, this of cōpound medicines, is a most noble and profitable invention, found out, brought into physicke, with great iudgement; wisdome, counsell and discretion. Mixt diseases must haue mixt remedies, and such simples are commonly mixt, as haue reference to the part affected, some to qualify, the rest to comfort, some one part, some another, Cardan and Brassiuola both hold that Nullum simplex medicamentum sine noxà, no simple medicine without hurt or offence, and although Hippocrates, Erasistratus, Diocles of olde, in the infancy of this art, were content with ordinary simples, yet now, saith 
                           Cap. 25. Tetrabib. 4. ser. 2. necessitas nunc cogit aliquando nova quaerere remedia, & ex simplicibus composita facere tum ad saporem, odo rem, palati gratiam, ad correctionem simplitium, tum ad futuros vsus conseruationem, &c
                         
                        Aetius, necessity compelleth to seeke for new remedies, and to make compounds of simples, as well to correct their harmes, if cold, dry, hot, thicke, thinne, insipid, noysome to smell, to make them sauory to the palat, pleasant to tast & take, and to preserue them for continuance by admixtion of sugar, hony, to make them last months, and yeares for severall vses. In such cases compound medicines may be approued, and Arnoldus in his 18 Aphorisme doth allow of it. 
                           Cum simplicia non possunt necessitas cogit ad composita.
                         
                        If simple cannot, necessity compells vs to vse compounds, and for receipts and magistralls, dies diem docet, one day teacheth another, & they are as so many words or phrases, quae nunc sunt in honore vocabula si volet vsus. Ebbe and flowe with the season, and as

                        Compound medicines are inwardly taken, or outwardly applyed. Inwardly taken be either liquid or solid, liquid, are fluid or consisting. Fluid as Wines and Syrupes. The wines ordinarily vsed to this disease, are Wormewood wine, Tamarisk, & Buglossatum, wine made of Borage and Buglosse. The composition of which is specified in Arnoldus Villanonanus, of Borage, Bawme, Buglosse, Cinnamon, &c. And highly commended for his vertues.

Melancholicos humores per vrinam educit & cerebrum à crassis aerumnosis melancholiae sumis purgat quibus addo dementes & furiosos vinculis retixendos plurimum iuvat & ad rationis vsū ducit.

                        It driues away Leaprosie, Scabbes, cleeres the blood, recreats the spirits, exhilerates the minde, purgeth the braines of those anxious blacke melancholy fumes, and cleanseth the whole body of that blacke humour by vrine. To which I adde, saith Villanonanus, that it will bring madde men and such raging Bedlams as are tied in chaines to the vse of their reason againe. My conscience beares me witnesse that I do not lye, I saw a graue matron helped by this meanes, shee was so cholericke and so furious sometimes, that she was almost mad, & beside her selfe, she said and did she knewe not what, scolded, beate her maids, and was now ready to be bound, till shee dranke of this Borage wine, and by this excellent remedy was cured, which a poore forriner, a sillye beggar taught her by chance, that came to craue an almes from dore to dore. The iuyce of Borage if it be clarified and drunke in wine will doe as much, the rootes sliced & steeped, &c. saith Ant.

                        for such as are solitary, dull, heavy, or sad without a cause, or bee troubled with trembling of heart. Other excellent compound waters for melancholy he cites in the same place, 
                           Modo non inflammetur Melancholia aut calidiore temperamento sint.
                         
                        if their melancholy be not inflamed, or their temperature over hot. Euonymus hath a protious Aquavitae to this purpose, for such as are cold. But he and most commend Aurum potabile, and euery writer prescribes clarified whay with Borage, Buglosse, Endiue, Succory &c. of Goats milke especially, some indefinitely at all times, some 30 dayes together in the spring, euery morning fasting a good draught. Syrupes are very good and often vsed to digest this humor in the heart, spleene, liuer, &c. As syrupe of Borage, de pomis of King Sabor absolete, of Thyme and Epithyme, Hops, Scolopendria, Fumitory, Maidenhaire, Bizantine, &c.

                         Comedian, told Simo and Ballio two doting fellowes, that they had need to be purged with this plant. Lilius Geraldus saith, that Hercules after all his mad pranckes vpon his wife and children, was perfectly cured by a purge of Hellebor, which an Anticyrian administred vnto him.

Of head Melancholy first, In which, as in all other good cures we must begin with Diet, as a matter of most moment, able oftentimes of it selfe to worke this effect. I haue read saith Laurentius cap. 8. de Malanch. That in old diseases which haue gotten the vpper hand or an habite, the maner of liuing is to more purpose, then whatsoeuer can be drawne out of the most pretious boxes of the Apothecaries. This Diet as I haue said, is not onely in choice of meat & drinke, but of all those other non-naturall things. Aire to be cleare and moist most part. Diet moisting, of good iuyce, easie of digestion, and not windie, drinke cleare, and well brewed, not to strong nor to small. Make a melancholy man fat, as

                        PHlebotomy is promiscuously vsed before and after Physicke, commonly before, and vpon occasion is often reiterated, if there be any need at least of it. For Galen and many others make a doubt of bleeding at all in this kind of head melancholy. If the malady saith Piso cap. 23. & Altomarus cap. 7. Fuchsius cap. 33.

                        shall proceed primarily from

the misaffected braine, the patient in such case shall not need at all to be let blood, except the blood otherwise abound, the veines be full, inflamed blood, and party ready to run mad. Laurentius cap. 9. approues of it out of the authoritie of the Arabians, but as Mesue, Rhases, Alexander, 
                        
                           Competit ijs phlebotemia frontis.
                         
                        especially in the head, to open the veines of the fore-head, nose and eares, they set cupping glasses on their shoulders, hauing first scarrified the place, they apply horseleaches on the head, and in all melancholy diseases, whether essentiall or accidentall they cause the haemrods to be opened, hauing the eleuenth Aphorisme of the 6 booke of Hippocrates, for their ground and warrant, which saith, that in melancholy and madmen, the varicous tumor haemorroides appearing doth heale the same.

Trallianus allowes of this, 
                           Si quibus consuctae suae suppressae sunt menses &c. talo secare oportet aut vena frontis si sanguis peccet cerebro.
                         
                        if their haue been any suppression or stopping of blood at nose, or haemords, or women's months, then to open a veine in the head or about the ancles. Yet he doth hardly approue of this course, if melancholy be fited in the head alone, or in any other dotage, 
                           Nisi ortum ducat à sanguine, ne morbus inde augeatur phlebotomia refrigerat & exiccat, nisi corpus sit valde sanguineum rubicundum.

                     SVBSECT. 3. Preparatiues and purgers.
                     AFter blood-letting we must proceede to other medicines, first prepare, and then purge, Augeae stabulum purgare, make the body cleane before we can hope to doe any good. Gualter Bruel would haue a practitioner beginne first with a Clyster of his, which he prescribes before blood-letting, the common sort as Mercurialis, Montaltus cap. 30. &c. first proceed from lenitiues to preparatiues, and so to purges. Lenitiues are well known, electuarium lenitiuum, Diaphenicum, Diacatholicon, &c. preparatiues are vsually syrups of Borage, Buglosse, Apples, Fumitory, Thyme and Epithyme, with double as much of the same decoction or distilled water, or of the waters of Buglosse, Bawme, Hoppes, En

                        we must begin with the gentlest first. Some forbid all hot medicines as Alexander and Saluianus &c. Ne insaniores inde siant, Hot medicines increase the disease

                           Guianerius Tract 15. cap. 6. obserues, mouere & non educere in omnibus malum est. To stirre vp the humour (as one purge commonly doth) and not to prosecute, doth more harme then good. They must continue in a course of Phisicke, yet not so that they tire and oppresse nature, da

Of the same minde is Seneca the Philosopher in his booke de tranquil. animae lib. 1. cap. 15. nonnunquam vt in alijs morbis ad ebrietatem vs

It is good sometimes to be drunke, it helps sorrow depresseth cares, and so concludes his tract with a cup of wine: Habes Serene charissime qua ad tranquilitatem animae pertinent. But these are Epicureall tenents, tending to loosenesse of life, luxury and Atheisme, maintained alone by some Heathens, dissolute Arabians, prophane Christians, and are exploded by Rabby Moses Tract. 4. Guliel. Placentius lib. 1. cap. 8. Valescus de Taranta, and most accuratly by Io. Silvaticus, a late writer and Physitian of Millan, med. cont. cap. 14. where you shall finde this tenent copiously confuted.
                     Howsoeuer you say, if this bee true, that wine and strong drinke haue such vertue to expell feare and sorrow, & to exhilerate the minde, euer hereafter lets drinke and be merry.

                        Agellius, let vs maintaine the vigor of our soule with a moderate cup of wine, & drink to refresh our minds, if there be any cold sorrow in it, or torpid bashfulnesse lets wash it all away. Let's driue downe care with a cup of Ale: & so say I,
                           Theocritus edil. 13. vino dari letitiam & dolorem.
                         for all this may be done, so that it be modestly, soberly, opportunely vsed: Otherwise, as 
                           Lib. 14.5. nihil pernitiosies viribus, si modus absit, venenum.
                         
                        Pliny telleth vs. If singular moderation be not had, nothing so pernitious, tis poyson it selfe. Let not good fellowes triumph therefore (saith Mathiolus) that I haue so much commended wine, if it be immoderatly taken, insteed of making glad, it confounds both body and soule, it makes a giddy head, a sorrowfull heart. And 'twas well said of that Poet of old. Wine causeth mirth and griefe, 
                        
                           Renodeus.
                         nothing so good for some, so bad for others, especially as 
                           Mercurialis consil. 25. Vinū frigida optimum, & pessimum ferinâ melancholiâ.
                         one obseues, qui à causà calida malè habent, that are hot or inflamed. And so of spices, they alone, as I haue shewed cause head melancholy themselues, they must not vse wine as an

                     I may say the very same of the Decoction of China roots, Sassafras, Sarsaparilia, Guaiacū. China, saith Manardus makes a good colour in the face, takes away melancholy and all infirmities proceeding from cold, and so Salsaperilla prouokes sweat mightely. Guaiacum dries, Claudinus consult. 89. & 46. Montanus, Capivaccius consult. 188. Scoltzij, make frequent and good vse of Guaiacum, & China,

                        which if it be eaten for 24 houres following takes away all sense of griefe, and makes them incline to laughter & mirth: and another called Bauge, like in effect to Opium

After a purge 3 or 4 gr. of Bezoar stone, and 3 gr. of Amber Greece, drunke or taken in Borage or Bugloffe water, in which gold hot hath beene quenched, will doe much good, and the purge shall diminish lesse (the heart so refreshed) of the strength and substance of the body.

Garcius ab Horto brags, how many desperate cures he hath done vpon melancholy men by this alone, when all Physitians had forsaken them. But Alchermes many except against, in some cases it may helpe if it be good and of the best, such as that of Montpelier in France, which

                        Todocus Sincerus Itinerario Galliae so much magnifies, and would haue no traueller to omit to see it made. But it is not so generall a medicine as the other. Fernelius consil. 49. suspects Alchermes by reason of his heat, 
                           Nihil morbum hunc aeque exasperat, ac alimentorum, vel calidorum vsus. Alchermes ideo suspectus, & quod semel moneam, caute adhibenda calida médicamenta.

                        Piso commends a Rammes lunges applied hot to the forepart of the head, or a young lamb diuided in the backe, exenterated &c. all acknowledge the chiefe cure to consist in moistning throughout. Some, saith Laurentius, vse powders and caps to the braine; but forasmuch as such

aromaticall things are hote and dry, they must bee sparingly vsed.
                     Vnto the Heart we may doe well to apply bagges, Epithemes, oyntments, of which Laurentius c. 9. de melan. giues examples. Bruel prescribes an Epitheme for the heart of Buglosse, Borage, water-lilly, Violet waters, sweet wine, Bawm leaues, Nutmegs, cloues, &c.

                     Waking by reason of their continuall cares, feares, sorrowes, dry braines, is a symptome that much crucifies, melancholy men, and must therefore be speedely helped, and sleep by all meanes procured, which sometimes is a sufficient remedy of it selfe without any other physick. Skenkius in his obseruations hath an example of a woman that was so cured. The meanes to procure it, are inward or outward. Inwardly taken, are simples or compounds, simples, as Poppy, 
                           Solo somno curata est citra medici auxiliū. fol. 154.

                     Median or middle veine to be opened, and so much blood to be taken away as the patient may well spare, and the cut that is made must be wide enough.

                     because the malice of melancholy is much corrected by the goodnesse of the blood. If the parties strength will not admitt much euacuation in this kind at once, it must be assayed againe and againe, if it may not conueniently be taken from the arme, it must be taken from the knees and ancles: especially to such men or women whose haemrodes or moneths haue beene stopped.

                        Codronchus in his book De sale absin, magnifies the salt of Wormewood aboue all other remedies,

Flatus hic sal efficaciter dissipat vrinam mouet humores crassos abstergit, stomachum egregié confortat cruditatem nauseam appetentam mirum in modum renouat, &c.
                         
                        which workes better and speedier then any other simple whatsoeuer, and much to be preferred before all those fulsome decoctions and infusions, which much offend by reason of their quantity, this alone in a small measure taken expells winde, and that most forcibly, mooues vrine, clenseth the stomacke of all grosse humours, crudities, helpes appetite &c. Arnoldus hath a Wormewood wine which he would haue vsed, which euery Pharmacopaea speakes of.

If it long continue, vomits may be vsed after meate, or otherwise gently procured with warme water, oximell &c. now and then.

Being to speake of this admirable affection of loue (saith Valleriola.) there lies open a vast and philosophicall field to my discourse, by which many louers become mad: let me leaue my more serious meditations, & wander in these philosophicall feildes, & looke into these pleasant groues of the muses,

But I need no such Apologies, I need not as Socrates in Plato did cover his face when he spake of loue: it is no such lasciuious, obsceane or wanton discourse, but chast and honest, and most part serious and euen of religion it selfe.

                        I speake it onely to taxe and deterre others from it, not to teach it, but to apply remedies vnto it. Condemne me not good Reader then, or censure me hardly, if some part of this Treatise to thy thinking be too light, but

consider better of it, pardon what is amisse, speak well at least and if thou likest it, wish me good successe. Extremum hunc Arethusa mihi concede laborem. I beginne.
                  
                  
                     SVBSEC. 2. Loues beginning, Obiect, Definition, Division.
                     
                        LOues limits are ample and great, & a spacious walke it hath beset with thornes, and for that cause, which

                        Scaliger reprehends in Cardan, not lightly to be passed ouer. Least I incur the same censure, I will examine all the kinds of loue, his nature, beginning, differences, obiects, how it is honest or dishonest, a vertue or vice, a naturall passion or a disease, his power and effects, how farre it extends: of which although something hath beene said in the first Partition, in those Sections of Perturbations (

                        for loue and hatred are the first and most common passions, from which all the rest arise, and are attendant, as Picolomineus holds) I will now more copiously dilate through all his parts and severall branches, that so it may better appeare what Loue is, and how it varies with the obiects, how in defect, or (which is most ordinary and common) immoderate and in excesse, it causeth Melancholy.
                     Loue vniuersally taken, is defined to be a Desire, as a word of more ample signification: and though Leon: Hebreus the most copious writer of this subiect, in his third Dialogue makes no difference, yet in his first Dialogue, hee distinguisheth them againe, and defines loue by Desire.

                        It is worth the labour, saith Plotinus, to consider wel of Loue, whether it be a God or a Divell, or passion of the mind, or partly God, partly Divell, partly passion. He concludes loue to

participate of all three to arise from Desire, of that which is beautifull and faire, and defines it to be an action of the minde, desiring that which is good.

                        Plato calls it the great Divell, for his vehemency and souerainty ouer all other passions, & defines it an Appetite,
                           Boni pulchri

                               fruendi desiderium
                         
                        by which we desire some good to be present. Ficinus in his Comment addes the word Faire to this Definition, Loue is a desire of inioying that which is good & faire. Austin dilates this common Definition, and will haue loue to be a Delectation of the heart, 
                           Godefridus, lib. 1. cap. 2 Amor est delectatio cordis alicuius ad aliquid propter aliquod desiderium in apperendo & gaudium perfruendo per desiderium currens, requiescens per gaudiū.
                         
                        for something which we seeke to winne or ioy to haue, coveting by desire, resting in ioy. 
                        
                           Non est amor desiderium aut appetitus vt ab omnibus bactenus traditum. Nam potimur cum amatá re non manet appetitus. Est igitur affectus quo cum re amatá aut vnimur, aut vnionem perpetuamus.
                         
                        Scaliger exerc. 301. taxeth all these former Definitions, and will not haue Loue to be defined by Desire or Appetite, for when we inioy the thing we desire, there remaines no more Appetite, as he defines it, Loue is an affection by which we are either vnited to the thing we loue, or perpetuate our vnion, which agrees in part with Leon Hebreus.
                     
                     Now this loue varies as his obiect varies, which is alwayes Good, Amiable, Faire, Gratious and Pleasant. 
                        
                           Omnia appetunt bonum.
                         
                        All things desire that which is good, as we are taught in the Ethicks, or at least that which to them seemes, to be good, from this goodnesse comes beauty, from beauty grace, and comlinesse, which result as so many rayes from their good parts, which makes vs to loue it, and so to couet it: for were it not pleasing and gracious in our eyes, we should not seeke it. 
                           Nemo amore capitur

                        No man loues (saith Aristotle 9. mor. cap. 5.) but hee that was first delighted with comlinesse and beautie. As this faire obiect varies, so doth our loue, for as Proclus holdes, Omne pulchrum amabile, euery faire thing is amiable, and what we loue is faire and gratious in our eyes. or at least we doe so apprehend, and esteeme of it still. 
                           Amabile obiectum amoris & scopus cuius adeptio est finis cuius gratiâ amamus. Animus enim aspirat vt eo fruatur, & formam boni habet & praecipuè videtur & placet, Picolomineus, grad. 7. cap. 2. & grad. 8. cap. 35. 
                        Amiablenesse is the obiect of loue, the scope and end is to obtaine it, for whose sake we loue, and which our mind couets to enioy. And it seemes to vs especially faire and good, for good, faire, and vnity, cannot

be separated. Beautie shines Plato saith, and by reason of it's spendor and shining causeth admiration, and the fairer the obiect is, the more eagerly it is sought. For as the same Plato defines it, 
                           Forma est vitalis fulgor ex ipso bono manans per ideas s
                                 •
                              mina, rationes umbras effusus, animos excitans vt per honum in vnum redigantur.
                         
                        Beautie is a liuely shining or glittering brightnesse, resulting from effused good By Ideas, seeds, reasons, shadowes, stirring vp our minds, that by this good they may be vnited and made one. Others will haue beauty to be the perfection of the whole composition, 
                        
                           Pulchritudo est perfectio cō

                        caused out of the congruous symmetry, measure, order and manner of parts, and that comelinesse which proceeds from this beautie is called grace, and from thence all faire things are gratious. And grace and beauty are so wonderfully annexed, 
                           Gratia & pulchritudo ita suauiter animos demulcent ita vehementer alliciunt & adeo mirabiliter connectuntur vt invnum confundant & distingui non possint, & sunt tanquā radii & splendores divin

                               solis in rebus variis vario modo fulgentes.
                         
                        so sweetly and gently winne our soules, and strongly allure, that they confound our iudgement and cannot be distinguished. Beauty and Grace are like those beames and shinings that come from the glorious and diuine Sun, which are diuerse, as they come from the diuerse obiects and please and affect our seuerall sences. 
                           Species pulchritudinis hauriuntur oculis auribus aut concipiuntur interná mente.
                         
                        As the species of beauty are taken at our eyes, eares, or conceiued in our inner Soule as Plato disputes at large in his Dialogue de Pulchro, Phaedro, Hyppias, and after many sophisticall errors confuted, concludes that Beautie is a grace in all things, delighting the eyes, eares, and Soule it selfe; and as as Valesius inferres hence, whatsoeuer pleaseth our eares, eyes, and Soule must needs be beautifull and faire, and delightsome to vs. 
                           Nihil hinc magis animos concil
                                 •

                        And nothing can more please our eares then Musicke, or pacifie our minds, faire houses, pictures, Orchards, Gardens, Fields, a faire Hawke, a faire horse is most acceptable vnto vs: whatsoeuer pleaseth our eyes and eares, we call beautifull and faire, 
                           In reliquis sensibus voluptas in his pulchritudo & gratia.
                         
                        Pleasure belongeth to the rest of the sences, but Grace and Beautie to these two alone. As the obiects varie and are diuerse, so they diuersly affect our eyes, eares, and Soule it selfe. which giues occasion to some, to make so many seuerall kindes of Loue as their bee obiects: One Beauty

ariseth from God, another frō his creatures, their is a beauty of the Body, a beauty of the soule, a Beauty from vertue, forma martyrum as Austin cals it, quam videmus oculis animi, which we see with the eies of our soul, which Beauty as Tully saith, if we coulde discerne with these corporall eies, admirabiles sui amores excitaret, would cause admirable affections, and rauish our Soules. This other Beautie which ariseth from those extreame parts, and those graces which proceed from gestures, speeches and seuerall motions and proportions of creatures, men and women, (especially from women, which made those old Poets put the three Graces still in Venus company, as attending on her, and holding vp her traine) are infinite almost, and varie their names with their obiects, as loue of mony, couetousnesse, loue of Beauty, Lust,
                           Conuinio Platonis.
                         Immoderate desire of any pleasure, concupiscence, friendship, loue, good will, &c. and is either vertue or vice, honest, dishonest, in excesse, defect, as shall be shewed in his place: Heroicall Loue: Religious Loue, &c. which may be reduced to a twofold Diuision, according to the principall parts which are affected, the Braine and Liuer. Amor & amicitia which Scaliger exercitat. 301. Valesius and Melancthon warrant out of Plato, 
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        . Out of that speech of Pausanias belike, that makes two Veneres and two loues. 
                           Duae veneres duo amores quarum vna antiquior & sine matre caelo nata quam caelestem venerem nuncupamus, altera vero Iunior à Ioue & Dione prognata quam vnigarem venerem vocamus.
                         
                        One Venus is ancient without a mother, and descended from heauen, whom we call caelestiall; The yonger, begotten of Iupiter and Dione, whom commonly we call Venus. Ficinus in his Coment vpon this place cap. 8. following Plato, calles these two loues, two diuells, 
                           Altera ad superna crigit altera deprimit ad inferna.
                         or good or bad angells according to vs, which are still houering about our Soules, 
                           Alter excitat hominem ad divinam pulchritudinem lustrandam cuius causa philosophiae studia & iustitiae, &c.
                         
                        The one rears vs to heauen, the other depresseth vs to hell; the one good which stirres vs vp to the contemplatiō of that divine beauty for whose sake we performe Iustice, and all godly offices, study Phylosophy, &c. the other base in respect and bad, and yet to be respected, for indeed both are good in their owne natures: procreation of children is as necessary as that finding out of truth, but therefore called bad, because it is abused, and which drawes our soules

from the speculation of that other, to viler obiects. So far Ficinus. St Austin lib. 15. de civ: Dei & sup. Psal. 64. hath deliuered as much in effect.
                           Omnis creatura cum bona sit & bene amari potest & male.
                         
                        Every creature is good, and may bee loued well or ill. And 
                           Duas ciuitates duo faciunt amores Ierusalem facit amor Dei, Babilonem amor saeculi, vnusquis
                                 
                                    
                                 
                                 que
                               se quid amet interroget & inveniet vnde sit civis.
                         
                        Two citties make two loues, Ierusalem & Babylon, the loue of God the one, the loue of the world the other, of these two citties we are all cittizens, as by examination of our selues we may soone finde, and of which. The one loue is the root of all mischiefe, the other of all good. And in his 15. cap. lib. de mor. Ecclesiae, he will haue those foure cardinall vertues to be naught else but loue rightly composed, in his 15 booke de civitat. Dei cap. 22. he calls Vertue the order of Loue, whom Thomas following 1. part. 2. quaest. 55. art. 1. and quaest. 56.3 quaest. 62. art. 2. confirmes as much, and amplifies in many words. 
                           Alter mari ortus ferox varius fluctuans inanis Iuvenum mare referens, &c. Alter aurea catena caelo demissa bonum furorem mentibus e mittens, &c.
                         
                        Lucian to the same purpose hath a division of his owne, One loue was borne in the Sea, which is as various and raging in young mens breasts as the Sea it selfe, & causeth burning lust: the other is that golden chaine which was let downe from heauen, and with a diuine Fury rauisheth our Soules, made to the image of God, and stirres vs vp to comprehend that innate and incorruptible beauty, to which we were once created. Beroaldus hath expressed all this in an Epigram of his,

                           Dogmata divini memorant si vera Platonis,
                           Sunt geminae veneres, & geminatus amor,
                           Coelustis Venus est nullo generata parente,
                           Quae casto sanctos nectit amore viros.
                           Altera sed Venus est totum vulgata per orbem,
                           Quae diuum mentes alligat at
                                 
                                    
                                 
                                 que
                               hominum,
                           Improba, seductrix, petulans, &c.
                        
                        
                           If diuine Platoes Tenents they be true,
                           Two Veneres two loues there be
                           The one from heauen, vnbegotten still,
                           Which knitts our soules in vnitie,
                           The other famous ouer all the world,
                           Binding the hearts of God and men,
                           Dishonest wanton and seducing she,
                           Rules whom she will, both where and when.
                        
                     
                     
                        
This two-fold diuision of Loue, Origen likewise followes in his Comment on the Canticles, one from God, the other from the diuell as he holds (vnderstanding it in the worser sence) which many others repeate and imitate. Both which (to omit all subdiuisions) in excesse or defect, as they are abused or degenerate cause melancholy in a particular kind, as shall be shewed in his place. Austin in another place makes a three-fold Diuision of this Loue, which we may vse well or ill. 
                           Triasunt que amari à nobis benè vel male possunt Deus proximus mundus. Deus supra nos iuxta nos proximus infra nos mundus. Tria Deus, duo proximus, vnū mundus babet, &c.
                         
                        God our neighbour, and the world: God aboue vs, our neighbour next vs, the world beneath vs. In the course of our desires God hath three things, the world one, our neighbour two. Our desire to God is either from God, with God, or to God, and ordinarily so runnes. From God when it receiues from him, whence and for which it should loue him: with God when it contradicts his will in nothing: to God, when it seekes to repose and rest it selfe in him. Our Loue to our neighbour, may proceede from him, and runne with him, not to him: from him, as when we reioyce of his good safety, and well doing: with him, when we desire to haue him a fellow
                              •
                            and companion of our iourny in the way of the Lord: not in him, because there is no aide or hope or confidence in man. From the world our loue: comes, when wee come to admire the creator in his workes, and glorifie God in his creatures. With the world it should run, if according to the immutability of all temporalties, it should be deiected in aduersitie, or ouer eleuated in prosperitie: To the world if it would settle it selfe in his vaine delights and studies. Many such partitions of loue I could repeate and subdiuisions, but least (which Scaliger obiects to Cardan Exercitat. 501.) 
                           Ne confundam vesanos & faedos amores beatos, scelerum cum puro divino & vero, &c.
                         
                        I confound filthy burning lust with pure and diuine Loue, I wil follow that accurate Diuision of Leon. Hebreus dial. 2. Betwixt Sophia and Philo, where he speakes of Naturall, Sensible, and Rationall loue, and handleth each a part. Naturall loue or hatred, is that Sympathy or Antipathy which is to be seene in animate and inanimate creatures, in the foure Elements, Mettalls, Stones, Plants, Herbes, and is especially obserued in vegetalls: as betwixt the Vine and Elme a great

Sympathie, betwixt the Vine and Cabbage, betwixt the Vine and Oliue, 
                           Aliciat.
                         
                        Virgo fugit Bromium, betwixt the Vine and Bayes, a great Antipathie, the Vine loues not the Bay, 
                           Porta. vitis laurum nōamat nec eius odorem si prope crescat enecat. lappa lenti ad versatur.
                         
                        nor his smell, and will kill him, if he grow neere him; the Burre and the Lintle cannot endure one another; the Oliue and the Myrtle embrace one another, in roots & branches if they grow neere. Read more of this in Picolomineus grad. 7. cap. 1.

Baptist a porta de mag. lib. 1. cap. de plant. odio & Element. sym. Fracastorius de sym. & Antip. of the loue and hatred of Planets, consult with euery Astrologer: Leon Hebreus giues many reasons, and moraliseth them withall.
                     Sensible Loue, is that of brute beasts, of which the same Leon Hebreus dial. 2. assignes these causes. First for the pleasure they take in the act of generation, male and female loue one another. Secondly, for the preseruation of the species, and desire of young broode. Thirdly, for that mutuall agreement as being of the same kind. Fourthly, for custome, vse, and familiaritie, as if a dogge be brought vp with a Lyon and a Beare, contrarie to their natures, they will loue each other. Hawkes, dogges, horses loue their masters and keepers, many stories I could relate in this kind, but see Gillius de hist. Anim. lib. 3. cap. 14. those two epistles of Lipsius of dogges & horses, Agellius &c. Fiftly. for bringing vp, as if a bitch bring vp a kid, a hen ducklings, an hedgesparrow a cuckowe &c.
                     The third kinde is Amor cognitionis, as Leon calls it, Ratitionall loue and is proper to men, on which I must insist. This appeares in God, Angels, Men. God is loue it selfe, the fountaine of loue, the disciple of loue as Plato stiles him, the seruant of peace, the God of loue and peace, haue peace withall men, and God is with you.

                        an affection of both powers, Appetite & Reason. The rationall resides in the Braine, the other in the Liuer,

(as before hath bin said out of Plato and others) the Heart is diuersly affected of both, and caried a thousand wayes by consent. The Sensatiue most part ouerrules Reason, the soule is caried hudwinked, & the vnderstanding captiue like a beast.

Now this loue of men is diuerse, and varies as the obiect varies, by which they are entised, as vertue, wisedome, eloquence, profit, wealth, money, fame, or honour, comelinesse of person, &c. Leon Hebreus in his first Dialogue reduceth them all to these three, Vtile, Iucundum, Honestum, Profitable, Pleasant, Honest: of which he discourseth at large, and whatsoeuer is beautifull and faire, is referred to them, or any way to be desired. 
                           Ad vtile sanitas refertur vtilium est ambitio, cupids, desiderium, potius quae amor, excessus auaritia.
                         
                        To profitable, is ascribed Health, Wealth, Honour, &c. Which is rather ambition, Desire, Couetousnesse then Loue. Friends, children, loue of women, and all delightfull and pleasant things are referred to the second. The loue of honest things consists in vertue and wisedome, and is preferred before that which is profitable and pleasant.

                     Amongst all these faire entising obiects which procure Loue, and bewitch the Soule of man, there is none so mouing, so forcible as profite, and that which carieth with it a shew of commoditie. Health indeede is a precious thing, and to recouer and preserue which we will vndergoe any misery, drinke bitter Potions, freely giue our goods: restore a man to his health, his purse lies open to thee, bountifull he is, and thankfull and beholding to thee, but giue him wealth and honour, giue him gold, or what shall be for his aduantage and preferment, and thou shalt command his affections,

oblige him eternally to thee, heart and hand, life and all is at thy seruice, thou art his deare and louing friend, good and gracious Lord and master, Mecaenas, he is thy slaue and thy vassall, most affectioned and bounden in all duety, tell him good tidings in this kind, there spoke an angell, a blessed honour that brings in gaine, he is thy creature, and thou his creator; he hugges thee and admires thee: he is thine for euer. No Lodestone so attractiue as that of profite, none so faire an obiect as that of gold,

Gold of all other is a most delitious obiect, a sweet light, a goodly luster it hath, gratius aurum quam solem intuemur saith Austin, and we had rather see it then the Sunne. Sweete and pleasant in getting, keeping, it seasons all our labours, intolerable paines we take for it, base imployments, bitter flouts and taunts, long iourneyes, heauy burdens, all are made light and easie by this hope of gaine, At mihi plaudo simul ac nūmos contēplor in arcâ.

Christ was gracious with God and men, Luk. 2.52. there is still some peculiar grace as of good discourse, eloquence, wit, honesty, which is the primouent, & a most forcible loadstone to draw the favours & goodwils of mens eies, eares, & affections vnto them. When Iesus spake they were all astonied at his answers (Luk. 2.47.) and wondred at his gracious words which proceeded from his mouth. An orator steales away the harts of men, & as another Orpheus; quo vult, vnde vult, he puls thē to him by speach alone, a sweet voice causeth admiration, and he that can vtter himselfe in good words, in our ordinary phrase we call him a proper man, a divine spirit. For which cause belike those old Poets made Mercurie the gentleman vsher to the Graces, and captaine of eloquence, & those Charites to be Iupiters and Eurymones daughters, descended from aboue. Though they be otherwise deformed, crooked, vgly to behold, these good parts of the minde denominate them faire.

And those men which haue no other obiect of their loue, then greatnes, wealth, authoritie &c, are rather feared then beloued; and howsoeuer borne with for a time, yet for their tyranny and oppression, griping, coueteousnesse, currish hardnesse, folly, intemperance, impudence and such like vices they are ingenerally odious,

                  BEsides this loue that proceedes from Profite, Pleasure, Honesty, as one good turne askes another in equitie, or that proceedes from the law of nature, or from discipline and Philosophy; there is yet another loue compound of all these three, which is Charitie, commanded by God, which no man can well performe, but he that is a Christian, and a true regenerate man. That is,

                     The loue of brethren is great, and like an arch of stones, where if one be displaced, all comes downe, no loue so forcible and strong, honest, to the combination of which nature, fortune, vertue happily concurre, yet this loue comes short of it. Dulce & decorum pro patria mori,

Countrey containes. The Decij did se devouere Horatij, Curtij, Regulus, Codrus, sacrifice themselues for their Countries peace and good.

For if once we be truely linct' and touched with this Charity, we shall loue God aboue all, our neighbour as our selfe, as we are inioyned, Mark. 12.31. Mat. 19.19. and performe all those dueties and exercise those operations of a good Christian.

If a man would but consider, when he is in the midst and full career of such prodigious and vncharitable actions, how displeasing they are in Gods sight, how noxious to himselfe, as Solomon told Ioab. 1. Kings 2. the Lord shall bring this blood vpon their heads. Prov. 1.27. sudden desolation and destruction shall come like a whirlewind vpon them: affliction, anguish, the reward of his hand shall be giuen him. Isa, 3.11. &c. they shall fall into the pit

they haue digged for others, and when they are scraping, tyrannising, getting, wallowing in their wealth, This night, O foole, I will take away thy soule, what a seuere account they must make, and how

He that lendeth to the poore giues to God, and how it shall be restored to them again how by their patience and long suffering they shall heape coales on their enimies heads. Rom. 12. and hee that followeth after righteousnesse and mercy shall finde righteousnesse and glory. Surely they would checke themselues, curb in their vnnaturall inordinate affections, agree amongst themselues, abstaine from doing evill, amend there liues and learne to do good. Behold how comely and good a thing it is for brethren to liue together in

                     Miseri quid luctatiunculis hisce volumus, ecce mors supra caput est, & supremum illud tribunal, vbi & dicta & facta nostra examinanda sunt. Sapiamus. Why do we contend and vex one another, behold death is ouer our heads, and we must shortly giue account of all our vncharitable words and actions, thinke vpon it, and bee wise.

The part affected in men is the liuer, and therefore called Heroicall, because commonly Gallants & Noble

Constantine de Agric. l.10. cap. 4. giues an instance out of Florentius his Georgickes, of a Palme tree that lou'd most feruently,

Ammianus Marcelimus lib. 24. reports that they marry one another, and fall in loue if they grow in sight, and when the winde brings the smell to them, they are maruellously affected.

                           Quam vero ipsa desideret, affectu ramorú significat & ad illum respicit amanter, &c.
                         
                        which are enamored they can perceaue by the bending of their boughs, and inclination of their bodies. If any man thinke this which I say to be a tale let him read that story of two Palme trees in Italy, the male growing at Brundusium, the female at Otranto (related by Iouianus Pontanus in an excellent Poem, sometimes Tutor to Alphonsus Iunior King of Naples, his Secretary of State, and a great Philosopher) which were barren, and so continued a long time, til they came to see one another by growing vp higher, though many Stadiums asunder. Pierius in his Hierogliphiks, and Melchior Guilandinus memb. 3. tract. de papyro, cites this story of Pontanus for a truth. See more in Salmuth comment in Pancirol. de

Common experience and our sense will informe vs, how violent bruit beasts are carried away with this passion, horses aboue the rest. — furor est insignis equarum.

                        Cupid in Lucian bids Venus his mother be a good cheere, for he was now familiar with Lions, and often times did get on their backes, and hold them by the mane, and ride them about like horses, & they fawne vpon him with their tayles. Bulls, Beares, and Bores are so furious in this kinde that they kill one another: but especially Cocks,
                           Leones prae amore furunt. Plin. l.8. cap. 16. Arist. l.6. hist. animal. cap. 17. of his booke of Hunting. Lions and Harts, Which are so fierce that you may heare them fight halfe a mile off, saith Turberuile, & many times kill one another, or compell them to abandon the Rutte, that they may remaine masters in their places; and when one hath driuen his corrivall away, he raiseth his nose vp into the aire, and lookes aloft as though he gaue thanks to nature, which gaue him such great delight. How Birds are affected in this kinde, appeares out of that of Aristotle, that will haue them to sing ob futuram Venerem for ioy or in hope of their venery which is to come. Fishes pine away for loue and wax leane, if

                        Gomesius authority may be taken so loue tyranniseth in dumb creatures. Yet this is naturall for one beast to dote vpon another of the same kind, but what strange fury is that, when a Beast shall dote vpon a man? Saxo Grammaticus lib. 10. Dan. hist. hath a story of a Beare that loued a woman,

and kept her in his denne a long time, and begot a sonne of her, out of whose loynes proceeded many Northerne Kings: this is the originall belike of that common tale of Valentine and Vrson. Aelian, Pliny, Peter Gillius are full of such relations. A Peacock in Leucadia lou'd a maid, and when she died, the Peacock pined. 
                           Plin. 1 b. 10. cap 5 quum

                        A Dolphin lou'd a boy called Hernias, and when he died, the Fish came a land and so perished. The like ads Gellius lib. 10. cap. 22. out of Appion Aegypt. lib. 15. a Dolphin at Puteoli loued a child, and would come often to him, and let him get on his backe and carry him about, 
                           Postquam puer morbo abiit, & ipse Delphinus periit.
                         
                        and when by sicknesse the child was taken away, the Dolphin died.

                         Euery booke is full (saith Busbequius the Emperors Orator with the Grand Senior not long since, epist. 3. legat. Turc.) & yeelds such instances, to beleeue which, I was always afraid, least I should be thought to giue credit to fables, vntill I saw a lynx which I had from Assyria, so affected towards one of my men, that it cannot be denied but that he was in loue with him. When my man was present, the beast would vse many notable entisements and pleasant motions, and when he was going, hold him backe, and looke after him when hee was gone, very sad in his absence, but most iocund when he returned: and when my man went from me, the beast expressed his loue with continual sicknes, and after he had pined away for some fewe dayes, died. Such another story he hath of a Crane of Maiorca that loued a Spaniard, that would walke any way with him, & in his absence would seeke about for him, and make a noise that hee might heare her, and knocke at his doore, 
                           Desiderium sum testatus post iuediam aliqunt dierum interiit.
                         
                        and when he tooke his last farwell, famished her selfe. Such pretty pranks can Loue play with Birds, Fishes, Beasts: and if all bee true that is credibly reported, with the Spirits and Diuells themselues: who are as much inamored, and dote (if I may vse that word) as any other creature whatsoeuer. For if those stones bee true that are written of Incubus and Succubus, of Nymphes, lasciuious Faunes and Satyres, and those heathen Gods which were Divells, or those familiar meetings in our daies and company of Witches and Diuells, there is some probability for it. I knew

that Biarmannus, Wierus lib. 3. cap. 19. & 24. & some others stoutly deny it, that the Diuell hath no carnall copulation with women, that the Diuell takes no pleasure in such facts, meere phantasies all such relations of Incubi, Succubi, lies and tales. But Austin. lib. 15. de ciuit. Dei. doth acknowledge it. Erastus de Lamijs, Iacobus Sprenger, and his colleagues, &c. Zanchius cap. 16. lib. 4. de oper. Dei. Dandinus in Arist. de animâ lib. 2.

Hector Boethius in his Scottish history hath three or foure such examples, which Cardan confirmes out of him lib. 16. cap. 43. of such as haue had familiar company many yeares with them, and that in the habit of men & women. Philostratus in his 4th book de vitâ Apollonij, hath one memorable in this kind, which I may not omit: Of one Menippus Lycius a young man of 25 yeares of age, that going betwixt Cenchreas and Corinth met such a phantasine in the habit of a faire Gentlewoman, which taking him by the hand carried him home to her house in the suburbs of Corinth, and told him she was a Phaenitian by birth, and if hee would tarry with her,

The young man a Philosopher otherwise staied and discreet, and able to moderate his passious, though not this of loue, stayed with her a while with great content, and at last married her, to whose wedding amongst other guests came Apollonius, who by some probable coniectures found her out to be a Serpent, a Lamia, and that all her furniture, was but as Tantalus gold described by Homer, no substance but meere illusions.

                        many thousands tooke notice of this fact, for it was done in the middle

of Greece. Sabine in his comment on the 10th of Ovids Metamorphosis, at the tale of Orpheus, telleth vs of a Gentleman of Bavaria, that for many months together bewailed the losse of his deare wife, at length the Diuell in her habit came and comforted him, and told him because he was so importunate for her, that she would come and liue with him againe, on that condition he would be new married, and neuer sweare and blaspheame as he vsed formerly to doe, for if hee did she would be gone: 
                           Rem curans domesticam vt ante peperit aliquot liberos semper tamen tristis & pallida.
                         
                        He vowed it, and married, and liued with her, she brought him children, and gouerned his house, but was still pale and sad, & so continued, till one day falling out with him, he fell a swearing. shee vanished therevpon, and was neuer after seene.

                        This I haue heard, saith Sabine, from persons of good credit, which told me that the Duke of Bauaria told it for a certainty to the Duke of Saxony. One more I relate out of Florilegus, an honest historian of our nation, because he telleth it so confidently, as a thing in those dayes talked of all ouer Europe. A young Gentleman of Rome the same day that he was married, after dinner with the Bride and his friends went a walking into the fields, and towards Euening to the Tennis court to recreate himselfe, whilst he plaied, he put his ring vpō the finger of Venus statua, which was thereby made in brasse, after he had sufficiently plaied, & now made an ende of his sport, he came to fetch his ring, but Venus had bowed her finger in, and he could not get it off. Whereupon loath to make his company tarry at the present, there left it, intending to fetch it the next day, or at some more conuenient time, and went thence to supper, and so to bedde. In the night when he should come to performe those nuptiall rites, Venus steppes betweene him and his wife (vnseene, vnfelt of her) and told him that she was his wife, and that he had betrothed himselfe vnto her by that ringe, which he put vpon her finger, she troubled him for some following nights. He not knowing how to helpe himselfe, made his moue to one Palumbus, a learned Magician in those dayes, who gaue him a letter, & bade him at such a time of the night, in such a crosse

way at the townes end, where old Saturne would passe by with his associates, in precession, as commonly he did, deliuer the letter with his owne hands to Saturne himselfe: the young man of a bold spirit accordingly did it, and when the old feind had read it, he called Venus to him, which

                     I come at last to that Heroicall Loue, which is proper to men and women, and is a frequent cause of melancholy, and deserues much rather to be called burning lust, then by such an honourable title. There is an honest loue I confesse which is naturall, and no man liuing can auoid it. 
                           Aeneas Siluius. Iuvenal. qui nunquam visae flagrauit amore puellae.
                         
                        Et qui vim non sensit amoris, aut lapis est aut bellua. He is not a man but a blocke, a very stone that hath not felt the power of it, dote we either young or old as 
                           Chaucer.
                         he said, and none are excepted but Minerua and the Muses, for Cupid in 
                           Tom. 1. dial. deorum Lucianus. amore non ardent musae.
                         
                        Lucian complaines to his mother Venus, that amongst all the rest his arrowes could not pierce them. But this is a common passion, an honest, for men to loue in the way of marriage. You know marriage is honourable, a blessed calling, appointed by God himselfe in Paradise, it breedes true peace, tranquillity content and happinesse, when they liue without iarring, scolding, louingly as they should doe.

As Seneca liued with his Paulina, Abraham and Sara, Orpheus & Euridice, Arria & Poetus, Artemisia & Mausolus, & Rubenius Celer, that would needs haue it ingrauen on his tombe, that he had liued with Ennea his wife, 43. yeeres, 8. moneths, and neuer fell out: there is no happinesse like vnto it, no loue so great as this of man and wife, no such comfort.

And in their old age when they make much of one another, and say as he did to his wife in the Poet.

                           Deare wife lets liue in loue and die together,
                           As hitherto we haue in all good will,
                           Let no day change, or alter our affections,
                           But lets be young to one another still.
                        
                     
                     'Tis an happy state this indeed, but this loue of ours is immoderate, inordinate, and not to be comprehended in any bounds. It will not containe it selfe within the vnion of marriage, or applie it selfe to one obiect, but it is a wandring extrauagant, a domineering, a boundlesse, an irrefregable passion: sometimes this burning lust rageth after marriage, and then it is properly called Ielousie, sometimes before, and then it causeth this Heroicall melancholy, it extends sometimes to corriualls, sometimes it produceth rapes, incests, murders, &c. & is confined within no termes, of yeares, sexe or whatsoeuer else. Some furiously rage before they come to discretion or age.

                     What breache of vowes, and othes, furie, dotage, madnesse might I reckon vp. Yet this is more tollerable in youth, and such as are yet in their hote blood; but for an old foole to dote, and an old leacher, what more odious, what more absurd? and yet what so common? How many decrepit, hoarie, harsh, writhen, burstenbellied and crooked, toothlesse, bald, bleare-eyed, impotent, rotten old men shall you see flickering still in euery place. One gets him a young wife, another a Curtisan, and when he can scarce lift his legge ouer a sil, and hath one foote already in Charons boat, when he hath the trembling in his ioynts, the goute in his feete, a perpetuall rhume in his head, and all his moysture dried vp and gone, and cannot spit from him; a very child againe that cannot dresse himselfe, or cut his owne meat, yet he will be dreaming of, and honinge after wenches, what can be more vnseemely?

And desires as Sauanorola addes with all intention and egernesse of mind, to compasse or inioy her,

                        as melancholy hunters trouble themselues about their sports, couetous their gold and goods, so is he tormented still about his mistris. Arnoldus Villanouanus in his booke of Heroicall loue, defines it,

For continuall cogitation is not the genus, but a symptome of loue, wee continually thinke of that which we hate and abhor, as well as that which we loue, and many things we couet and desire, without all hope of attaining. Carolus a Lorme in his questions, makes a doubt, An Amor sit morbus, whether this Heroicall loue be a disease:

                        Arnoldus will haue it improperly

                     The place it selfe makes much wherein we liue, the clime and aire, and discipline if they concurre. In our Misnia saith Galen neere to Pergamus, thou shalt scarce finde an adulterer, but many at Rome, by reason of the delights of the place. All hote and Southerne Countries are prone to lust, and farre more incontinent, then those that liue in the North, as Bodine discourseth at large Method. hist. cap. 5.

                           Curtius lib. 5 Great Alexander married Roxane, a poore mans child only for her person, and 'twas well done of Alexander, and heroically

done, I admire him for it: Orlando was mad for Angelica, & who doth not condole his mishap. Thisbe died for Piramus, Dido for Aeneas, who doth not weepe, as 
                           Confess.
                         
                        Austin did in commiseration of her estate; shee died for him, mee thinkes (as he said) I could weepe for her.
                     
                     But this is not the matter in hand, what prerogatiue this Beauty hath, of what power and soueraignty she is, and how farre such persons that so much admire her, and dote vpon her, are to be iustified no man doubts: the question is how & by what meanes this Beauty produceth this effect? By sight: the Eye betraies the soule, and is both Actiue and Passiue in this businesse; it wounds and is wounded, and is an especiall cause and instrument, both in the subiect and in the obiect. It conuayes these beauteous rayes, as I haue said, vnto the heart. Vt vidi vt perij.

                        Theseus at the first sight of Helen was so besotted, that hee esteemed himselfe the happiest man in the world if he might enioy her. When Venus came first to heauen,

her comlinesse was such, that (as my author saith)

                        all the Gods came and saluted her, and each of them went to Iuppiter, and desired he might haue her to be his wife. When faire Antilogus came in presence, as a candle in the darke his beauty shined, and all mens cies (as

                        This comelinesse or beauty ariseth from the due proportion of the whole, or from each severall part. For an exact delineation of which, I referre you to Poets, Historiographers, and those amorous writers, To Lucians Imagines, and Charidemus, Xenophons description of Panthea, Petronius Catalectes, Heliodorus Cariclia, Tatius Leucippe, Longus Sophistas Daphnis and Cloe, Balthasar Castilio, lib. 14. de aulico, Laurentius cap. 10. Aeneas Siluius his Lucretia, and euery Poet almost, which haue most accurately described a perfect beauty, an absolute feature, and that through euery part, both in men and women. Each part must concurre to the perfection of it, for as Seneca saith, Epist. 33. lib. 4. Non est formosa mulier cuius crus laudatur & brachium, sed illa, cuius simul vniuersa facies admirationem singulis partibus dedit. Shee is no faire woman, whose arme, thigh, &c. are commended, except the face and all the other parts bee

correspondent, and the face especially giues a lustre to the rest. The Face is it which commonly denominates faire or fowle, arx forma facies, the Face is Beauties Tower, and though the other parts be deformed, yet a good face carries it, (facies non vxor amatur) that alone is most part respected, principally valued, & of it selfe alone able to captiuate.

What a tyranny, saith he, what a penetration of bodies is this, thou drawest me with violence, and swallowest me vp, as Charybdis doth Saylers, with thy rockie eies, he that falls into this gulfe of Loue can neuer get out. The strongest beames of beauty are still darted from thy eies, and as men catch dotrells, by putting out a legge or an arme, by those mutuall glances of the eyes they first inveagle one another. Of all eies, by the way, black are the most amiable, entising, and the fairest.

The manner of the fascination, as Ficinus comm. 10. cap. con. Plat. declares it, is thus. Mortall men are then especially bewitched, when as by often gazing one on the other, they direct sight to sight, and ioyne eye to eye, and so drinke and sucke in loue betweene them, for the beginning of this disease is the Eye. And therefore he that hath a cleere eye, though he be otherwise deformed, by often looking vpon him will make one mad, and ty

                        Philostratus speakes, of so pernitious a sight, hee poisoned all hee looked steddily on: and that other argument menstruae

faeminae, out of Aristotles Problems, that contaminats a looking glasse with beholding it.

                        so the beames come from the agents heart, and by the eyes infect the spirits about the patients and inwardly wound, and so the spirits infect the blood. So she complained in Apuleius, Thou art the cause of my griefe, thy eyes peircing through mine eyes to my inner parts, haue set my bowels on fire, and therefore pitty me that am now ready to dy for thy sake. Ficinus illustrates this with a familiar example of that Marhusian Phaedrus and Lycias.
                        
                           Lycias in Phaedri vultum inhiat Phaedrus in oculos Lysiae scintillas suorum defigit oculorum cum
                                 
                                    
                                 
                                 que
                               scintillis, &c. Sequitur Phaedrus Lyciam quia cor suum petit spiritum, Phaedrum Lycias quia spiritus propriam sedem postulat. Verum Lycias. &c.
                         
                        Lycias hee stares on Phaedrus face, and Phaedrus againe fastens the balls of his eyes vpon Lycias, and with those sparkling rayes sends out his spirits.

                        The beames of Phaedrus eyes are easily mingled with the beames of Lycias, and spirits are ioyned to spirits. This vapour begot in Phaedrus heart, enters into Lycias bowels, & that which is a greater wonder, Phaedrus blood is in Lycias heart, & thence come those ordinary loue speeches, my sweet heart Phaedrus, and mine own selfe, my deare bowels. And Phaedrus again to Lycias, O my light, my ioy, my soule, my life. Phaedrus followes Lycias, because his heart would haue his spirits, and Lycias followes Phaedrus, because he loues the seat of his spirits, both follow, but Lycias the more earnest of the two. The riuer hath more need of the fountaine, then the fountaine of the riuer, as iron is drawne to that which is touched with a loadstone, but drawes not it againe, so Lycias drawes Phaedrus. But how comes it to passe then, that a blinde man loues that neuer saw? 'Tis true indeed of naturall and chast loue, but not of this heroicall passion, or rather brutish burning lust, on which we treat, we speake of wandring, wanton, adulterous eyes, which as

                         shall be annexed vnto it, and other circumstances, opportunities of time, and place shall concurre, which of themselues alone were all sufficient, each one in particular to produce this effect. It is a question much controuerted by some wise men, An forma debeat plus arti an naturae, whether naturall or arteficiall obiects be more powerfull, but not decided: for my part I am of opinion, that though beauty of it selfe be a great motiue, and giue an excellent lustre in sordibus and in beggery, as a Iewell on a dunghill, it will shine and cast his rayes, it cannot be suppressed as Heliodorus faines of his Cariclia, though she were in beggers weeds: yet as it is vsed, arteficiall is of much more force. Iohn Lerius the Burgundian cap. 8. hist. nauigat. in Brasil. is altogether on my side. For whereas (saith he) at our comming thether, wee found both men and women starke naked as they were born,

without any couering, so much as of their priuities, & could not be perswaded by our French men that liued a yeare with them to weare any.

I could euince the truth of this by many other arguments, but I appeale (saith he) to my companions at that present, which were all of the same minde. His country man Montagne in his Essayes, is of the same opinion, and so are many others. Out of whose assertions thus much in breese we may conclude that Beauty is more beholding to art then to nature, & stronger prouocations proceed from outward ornaments, then such as nature hath prouided. It is true that those faire sparkling eyes, white neck, corall lippes, turgent pappes, Rose-coloured cheekes, &c. of themselues are potent entisers, but when a comely arteficiall, well composed look, gesture, an affected carriage shall be added, it must needs be farre more forcible then it was, when those curious needleworkes, variety of colours, Iewels, pendants, launes, faire and fine linnen, embroderies, calamistrations, oyntments, &c. shall bee added, they will make the veriest doudy otherwise a Goddesse, when nature shall be farthered by art. For it is not the eye of it selfe that entiseth to lust, but an adulterous eye, as Peter tearmes it 2.2.14. a wanton, a roling lasciuious eye, A wandring eye, which I say taxeth, 3.16. Christ himselfe, and the Virgin Mary had a beautifull eye, as amiable an eye as any persons, saith

                        Saluianus obserues, the eyes are the windowes of our sonles, by which as so many channels, all dishonest concupiscences get into our hearts. They reueale our thoughts, and as they say, frons animi Index, but the eye of the countenance. I may say the same of smiling, gate, nakednesse of parts, gestures, &c. To laugh is the proper passion of a man; an ordinary thing to smile, but those counterfeit composed, affected, artificiall and reciprocall, and counter smiles, are the dumbe shewes and prognosticks of greater matters,

                     But when you haue all done, veniunt à veste sagittae, the greatest prouocations of lust are from our apparell.

                        Philo Indaeus reprehends them for, and vse such gestures, apish, ridiculous, vndecent attires, vse those perfumes, oyntments in publike: come to heare Sermons so frequent, is it for deuotion? or rather as s 
                        Basil telles them, to meet their sweet-hearts, and see fashions, for as he saith commonly they come so prouided to that place, with such gestures and tires, as if they should goe to a dauncing-schoole, or to a stage-play, or baudie house sitter then a Church. They make those holy Temples consecrated to Gods martyrs, and religious vses, the shoppes of impudence, dennes of whores and theeues, and little better then brothel houses. When we shall see these things dayly done, their husbands banckrupts, if not cuckolds, their wiues light huswiues, daughters dishonest, and here of such dissolute actes, as daily we doe, how should we thinke otherwise, what is their end, but to deceiue and inueagle young men?

As tow doth fire, such entising obiects produce their effects, how can it be otherwise? When Venus stood befoe Anchises as

The women transformed themselues to Bacchus shapes, the men children to Satyrs and Pans, but Anthonie himselfe was quite besotted with Cleopatras sweet speeches, Philters, beautie, pleasing tires, for when she sailed along the riuer Cydnus, with such incredible pompe in a guilded shippe, her selfe dressed like Venus, her maides like the Graces, her Pages like so many Cupids, Anthonie was amased and

It is reported of Cornelia that vertuous Romane Lady, great Scipios daughter, Titus Sempronius wife, and the mothor of the Gracchi, that being by chaunce in company with a Campanian, a strange gentlewoman, (some light huswife belike, that was dressed like a may lady, and as most of our gentlewomen are,

                        was more sollicitous of her head-tires, then of her health, that spent her time betwixt a combe and a glasse, and had rather be faire then honest (as he said) and her common-wealth turned topsie turuie, then her tyres marred.) And shee did nought but bragge of her fine robes, and Iewels, and prouoked her to shew hers. Cornelia kept her in talke till her children came from schoole, and these said she are my iewells, and so deluded and put off a proud, vaine, phantasticall idle huswife. How much better were it for our matrons to doe as she did, to goe ciuelly and decently,

                        Furius did not so triumph ouer Gaules, Papyrius of the Samnites, Scipio of Numantia, as shee did by her temperance; pullà semper veste, &c. they should insult and domineere ouer lust, folly, vaine-glory, and such inordinate, furious and vnruly passions.
                     But I am ouertedious I confesse, and whilst I stand gaping after fine clothes, there is another great allurement (in

the worlds eyes at least) which had like to haue stole out of sight: and that is money, veniunt à dote sagittae. Many men if they doe but heare of a great portion', are more mad then if they had all the beautious ornaments, and all those good parts arte and nature can afford, they care not for honesty, bringing vp, birth, beautie, person, but for money. If she be rich, then she is faire, then she burnes like fire, they loue her dearely, like pigge and pie, and are ready to hang themselues if they may not haue her. Nothing so familiar in these dayes, as for a yong man to marry an old wife as they say for a piece of good, and though she be an old crone, and haue neuer a tooth in her head, neither good conditions, nor good face, a naturall foole, but onely rich, she shall haue twentie yong gallants to be her suiters in an instant. As she said, non me sed mea ambiunt, 'tis not for her sake, but for money, and an excellent match it were (as hee added) if she were away. So on the otherside, many a young maid will cast away her selfe vpon an old doting disarde, that hath some twentie diseases, one eye, one legge, neuer a nose, no haire on his head, nor wit in his braines, nor honesty, if he haue 
                           Vxorem ducat Danaen, &c.
                         money she will haue him before all her other suiters.

                        De moribus vltima fiet quaestio, for his conditions she will enquire after them another time, or when all is done, the match made, and euery body gone home. This is not amongst your dustwormes alone, poore snakes that will prostitute their soules for money, but with this baite you may catch your most potent, puissant, and illustrious Princes.

                        Iagello the great Duke of Lituania, 1386. was mightily enamored on Hedinga, in so much that he was turned Christian, and was baptized himselfe by the name of Vladislaus, and al his subiects for her sake, but why was it? she was daughter and heire of Polande, and his desire was to haue both kingdomes incorporated into one. Charles the great was an earnest suiter to Iraene the Empresse, but saith 
                           Tom. 3. annal.
                         
                        Zonoras P ob regnum, to annexe the Empîre of the

East to that of the West. But what is the euent of all such matches, that are so made for money, goods, or by deceipt, or for burning lust, quos foeda libido cōiunxit, what followes? they are almost mad at first, but 'tis but a flash, as chaffe and straw soone fired and burne vehemently for a while, but are out in a moment, are all such matches so made by those allurements of burning lust, where there is no respect of honesty, parentage, vertue, religion, education, and the like, they are extinguished in an instant, & in stead of loue comes hate, for ioy repentance, and desperation it selfe. Franciscus Barbarus in his first booke de re vxoria cap. 5. hath a story of one Phillip of Padua that fell in loue with a common whore, and was now ready to runne mad for her; his father hauing no more sonnes, let him inioy her, 
                           Libido statim deferbuit fastidium caepit & quod in eâ tantopore adamauit aspernatur, & ab aegritudiue liberatus in angorem incidit.
                         
                        but after a few dayes, the young man began to lothe her, and could not so much as endure the sight of her, and from one madnesse fell into another. Such euent commonly haue all such louers, and he that so marries, and for such respects, let him looke for no better successe, then Menalaus had with Helen, Vulcan with Venus, Theseus with. Phaedra, Minos with Pasyphae, and Claudius with Messallinae, shame, sorrow, miserie, melancholie, discontent.

                     ALl these allurements hitherto are afarre off, and at a distance, I will come neerer to those other degrees of Loue, which are conference, kissing, dalliance, discourse, singing, dancing, amorous tales, obiects, presents, &c. which as so many Syrens steale away the hearts of men and women.

                        It is no sufficient triall of a maids affectiō by her eyes alone, but you must say something that shall be more auaileable and vse some other forcible engines. And therefore take her by the hand, wring her fingers hard, and sigh withall, and if she take this in good part, and seeme not to be much auerse, then call her mistris, and take her about the necke and kisse her, &c. But this cannot be done, except they first get opportunitie of liuing or comming together, ingresse, egresse and regresse; letters and commendations may doe much, outward gestures, actions, but when they come to liue together in an house, loue is kindled on a sudden. Many a Seruingman by reason of this opportunitie and importunitie inueigles his masters daughters, many a gallant dotes vpon a Doudie, many Ladies dote vpon their men, as the Queene in Ariosto did vpon the dwarfe, many matches are made in hast, which had they bin free, or come in company of others, or seene that variety which other places afford, would neuer haue looked one vpon another. Or had not that opportunity of discourse & familiaritie been offered, they would haue loathed those and contemned; whō for want of better choice & other obiects, they are fatally driuen on, and by reason of their hote blood, idle life, full diet, &c. are forced to dote vpon what comes next. And many times those which at the first sight cannot fancie or affect each other, but are harsh and ready to disagree and disgrace, offended with each others carriages, and in whom they finde many faults, by this liuing together in a house, conference, kissing, colling, and such like allurements begin at last to dote insensibly one vpon another.
                     It was the greatest motiue that Potiphars wife had to dote vpon Ioseph, and 
                           Tatius lib. 1. 
                        Clitiphon vpon Leucippe his vncles daughter, because the plague being at Bizance, it was his fortune for a time to soiourne with her, to sit next her, as he telleth the tale himselfe in Tatius lib. 2. (which though it be but a fiction, is grounded vpon good obseruation, and doth

well expresse the passions of louers) he had oportunitie to take her by the hand, and handle her pappes, 
                           In mammarum attractu non aspernanda inest iucunditas, & attrectatus &c.
                         which made him mad. Ismenius the orator makes the like confession in Eumathius lib. 1. That when he came first to Sosthenes house, & sate at table with Cratistines, his friend, Ismenea Sosthenes daughter, waiting on them with her armes bare (which moued him much) was still ready to giue attendance on him, to fill him drinke, and her eyes were neuer offhim, but still smiling on him, and when they were risen, and shee had gotten a little oportunitie, 
                           Manus ad cubitum nuda, coram astans fortius intuita. Tenuem de pectore spiritum ducens digitum meum pressit, & bibe

                               pedom pressit, mutuae compressiones corporum, laebiorum commixtiones, pedum cōnexiones, &c. & bibit eodem loco, &c.
                         
                        she came and dranke to him, and withall trodde vpon his toes, and would come and goe, and when she could not speake for the company, she would wringe his hand, and blush when she met him: and by this meanes first she ouercame him, bibens amorē hauriebam simul , she would kisse the cup and drinke to him, and smile, and drinke where he dranke, on that side of the cup, by which mutuall compressions, kissings, wringing of hands, treading of feete, &c. Ipsam mihi videbar sorbillare virginem, I was drunke in loue vpon a sudden.
                     This opportunitie of time and place, with their circumstances are so forcible motiues, that it is vnpossible almost for two young folkes equall in yeeres to liue together, and not be in loue, especially in great houses, Princes courts, where they are idle, in summo gradu, fare well, liue at ease, and cannot tell otherwise how to spend their time.

If there be seuen seruants in an ordinarie house, you shall haue three couple in some good liking at least, and amongst idle persons how shall it be otherwise? Night alone that one opportunitie is enough to set all a fire, and they are so cunning in great houses, that they make their best aduantage of it; Many a gentlewoman, that is guiltie to her selfe of her imperfections, paintings, impostures, will not willingly be seene in the day time, but as

                         in a Mercers shoppe, a very obsuscate and obscure sight. And good reason she hath for it. Nocte latent mendae, and many an amorous gull is fetched ouer by that meanes. Gomesius lib. 3. de sale cap. 22. giues instance in a Florentine gentleman, that was so deceiued with a wife, she was so radiantly set out with rings and Iewels, lawnes and laces, gold and gaudy deuises, that the young man tooke her to be a goddesse, (For he neuer saw her but by torchlight) but after the wedding solemnities, when as he viewed her the next morning without her tires, and in a cleere day, she was so deformed, such a beastly creature in his eyes, that he could not endure to looke vpon her. Such matches are frequently made in Italie, where they haue no other opportunitie to wooe but when they goe to Church, or as

In those hotter countries these are ordinarie practises at this day, but in our Northerne parts amongst Germanes, Danes, Brittaines, the continent of Scandia and the rest, we assume more libertie in such cases, we allowe them as Bohemus saith, to kisse comming and going, & modo absit lasciuia, in cauponam ducere, to talke merrily, sport and play, sing and dance, so that it be modestly done, and go to the alehouse and tauerne together.

                           Nutibus mutis inducens in errorem mentem puellae.

                           Tale verbum ait amoris ictus stimulo,
                           Preces audi & amoris miserere mei, &c.
                           Sic fatus recusantis persuasit mentem puellae.
                        
                        
                           With becks and nods he first beganne,
                           To try the wenches minde,
                           With becks and nods and smiles againe,
                           An answere he did finde.
                           And in the darke he tooke her by the hand,
                           And wrong it hard, and sighed grieuously,
                           And kissed her too, and wo'd her as he might,
                           With pitty me sweet heart, or else I dye,
                           And with such words and gestures as there past,
                           He wonne his Mistris fauour at the last.
                        
                     
                     The same proceeding is elegantly described by Apollonius in his Argonauticks, betwixt Iason & Medaea, by Eumathius in his ten books of the loues of Ismenius and Ismene, Achilles Tatius betwixt his Clitiphon & Leucippe; & in that famous tale of Petronius of a Souldier and a Gentlewoman of Ephesus,
                        
that was so famous all ouer Asia for her chastity, & that mourned for her husband, the Souldier woed her with such Rhetoricke as Louers vse to doe,—placitone etiam pugnabis amori, &c. at last, frangi pertinaciam passa est, he got her good will, not only to satisfie his lust, 
                           Corpus plaecuit mariti sui tolli ex arca at

These are tales you will say, but they haue most significant Morals, and doe well expresse those ordinary proceedings of doting Louers.
                     Many such allurements there are, Nods, Iests, Winkings, Smiles, Wrastlings, Tokens, Fauours, Symbols, Letters, &c. For which cause belike, Godfridus lib. 2. de amor. would not haue women learne to write) many such prouocations when they come in presence, they will and will not.

It is reported of Decius and Valerianus, those two notorious persecutors of the Church, that when they could inforce a young Christian by no meanes (as

                        Barclye in Glocestershire, there was in times past a famous Nunnery (saith Gualter Mapes, an old Historiographer of ours, that liued 400 yeares since) Of which there was a Noble and a faire Lady abbesse: Godwin that subtill Earle of Kent travelling that way. (seeking not her but hers) leaues a Nephew of his, a proper yonge Gallāt, (as if he had been sicke) with her, til he came back againe and giues the young man charge so long to counterfeit, till he had deflowred the Abbesse, and as many besides of the Nunnes as he could: and leaues him with all rings, iewels, girdles, and such toyes to giue them still, when they came to visit him. The young man willing to vndergoe such a businesse, plaid his part so well, that in short space he got vp most of their bellies, and when hee had done, told his Lord how he had sped.

                        His Lord makes instantly to the Court, tells the King how such a Nunnery was become a bawdy house, procures a visitation, gets them to bee turned out, and begges their lands to his owne vse. This story I doe therefore repeat, that you may see of what force such entisements are, if they be opportunely vsed, and how hard it is euen for the most auerse and sanctified soules to resist such allurements. Iohn Maior in the life of Iohn the Monke, that liuing

in the dayes of Theodosius, commēds the Ermite to haue beene a man of singular continency, and of a most austere life, but one night by chance the Diuel came to his Cell in the habit of a young market wench, that had lost her way, & desired for Gods sake some lodging with him:

Whether this be a true story, or a tale, I will not much contend, it serues to illustrate this which I haue said.
                     Yet were it so, that these of which I haue hitherto spoken, and such like entising baites be not sufficient, there be many others which will of themselues incende this passion of burning lust, amongst which, Dancing is none of the least, and because it is an engine of such force, I may not omit it. Incitamentum libidinis, Petrarch calls it, the spurre of lust.

The spectators did all admire the young mans carriage, and Ariadne her selfe was so much affected with the sight, that shee could scarce sit. After a while Dionysius beholding Ariadne, and incensed with Loue, bowing to her knees, embraced her first, and kissed her with a grace, she embraced him againe, and kissed with like affection, as the dance required: but they that stood by & saw this, did much applaud and commend them both for it. And when Dionysius rose vp, he raised her vp with him, and many pretty gestures, & embraces, and kisses, & loue complements passed betweene them; which when they saw, faire Bacchus and beautifull Ariadne so sweetly and so vnfainedly kissing each other, so really, they swore they loued indeed, and were so enflamed with the obiect, and beganne to rouse vp themselues, as if they would haue flone. At the last when they saw them still, and so willingly embracing, and now ready to goe to the Bride-chamber, they were so rauish

oppugner? Not without a good cause therefore so many graue men speake against it, Vse not the company of a woman, saith Siracides, 8. 4. that is a singer or a dancer, neither heare least thou be taken in her craftinesse. Nemo saltat sobrius, Tully holdes, he is not a sober man that danceth, and for that reason belike Domitian forbad the Roman Senators to dance, and for that fact remoued some of them from the Senate. But these you will say are lasciuious dances, & 'tis the abuse that causeth such inconuenience, And I doe not well therefore to condemne, or speake against it. You misinterpret, I doe not condemne it; I hold it not withstanding an honest disport, a lawfull recreation, if it be modestly and soberly vsed. I am of Plutarchs minde, 
                           Quae honestā voluptatem respicit, aut corporis exercitium contemni non debet.
                         
                        that which respects pleasure alone, honest recreation, or bodily exercise ought not to bee reiected and contemned. Salust discommends singing and dancing in Sempronia, not that she did sing or dance, but that shee did it in excesse, 'tis the abuse of it. Many will not allow men and women to dance together,

Let them take their pleasures, and as he said of old, young men & maids, flourishing in their age, faire and louely to behold, well attired, and of comely carriage danced a Greek Galliard, and as their dance required, kept their time, now turning, now tracing, now a part, now altogether, &c. and it was a pleasant sight.

                        The very sight of naked parts, causeth enormous & exceeding concupiscences, and stirres vp both men and women to burning lust▪
                         There is a meane in all things, this is my censure in breese. Dancing is a most pleasant recreation of body and minde, if conueniently vsed, a furious motiue to burning lust, if abused. But I proceed.
                     If these allurements doe not take place, the more effectually to moue others, and satisfie their lust, they will sweare and lye, promise, protest, forge, counterfeit, bribe, flatter, and dissemble of all sides. Many men to fetch ouer a younge woman, widdowes, or whom they loue, will not sticke to giue out, as he did in Petronius, that he was master of a ship, and kept so many seruants, and to personate their part the better, take vpon them to bee Gentlemen of good houses, well descended and allied, and hire apparell at brokers, some Scauingers or prick-louse Taylers to attend vpon them for the time, sweare they haue great possessions,

How many Proserpinas with those catchpoles doth Pluto take? These are the sleepy rods with which their soules touched descend to hell; this the glew or lime with which the wings of the minde once touched cannot fly away, the Diuels ministers to allure, entice, &c. Many young men and maids without all question are inueagled by these Eumenides, and their associats. But these are triviall & well known: your most sly, dangerous & cunning Bawds are your knauish Phisitians, Empyrickes, Masse-priests, Monkes, Iesuits, and Friers: Though it be against Hippocrates oath, some of them will giue a dramme, and promise to restore maidenheads, and doe it without danger, make an abort if need be, keepe downe their pappes, hinder conception, procure lust, make them able with Satyrions, and now and then step in themselues. No Monastery so close, or house so priuate, or prison so kept, but these honest men are admitted to censure & aske questions, to feele their pulse beat at their bed side, and all vnder pretence of giuing Physicke. Now as for Monks, Confessors, and Friers, as he said.

his loue, but when Olympia the Queene saw the wench, of an excellent beauty, well brought vp and qualified these, quoth she, were the Philters which inueagled King Philip.

Marcus the Heretick is accused by Irinaeus to haue inueagled a young maid by this meanes; and some writers speake hardly of the Lady Catharine Cobham, that by the same art she circumuented Humfrey Duke of Gloucester to be her husband.

                        loue makes an vnequall pulse, &c. 
                        
                           In nobilis cuiusdam vxore quum sabolfacerem adulteri amore fuisse correptam, & quam maritus, &c.
                         hee giues an instance in a Gentlewoman a patient of his, whom by this meanes he found to be much inamored, and with whom: hee named many persons, but at the last when he named him whom he suspected, 
                           Caepit illico pulsus variari & ferri celerius & sic inveni.
                         
                        her pulse began to varie and to beat swifter, and so by often feeling her pulse, he perceiued what the matter was. Apollonius Argonaut lib. 4. Poetically setting downe the meeting of Iason and Medaea, makes them both to blush at one anothers sight, and at the first they were not able to speake: which very signe

                        Eumathius makes an argument of Ismenes affection, that when she met her sweet-heart by chance, she changed her countenance. And 'tis a common thing amongst louers, as

                        Arnulphus that merry conceited Bishop, hath well expressed in a Epigram of his.

                     But the best coniectures are taken from such symptomes as appeare when they are both present; all their speeches, actions, lasciuious gestures will bewray them, they cannot containe themselues; but that they will be still kissing.

                         Culling, dallying, feeling their pappes, biting lippes, embracing, treading on their toes, and scarce honestly sometimes: diuing into their bosomes, as the old man in the

                         Comedie well obserued of his sonne, Non ego te videbam manum huic puellae in sinum inserere? Did not I see thee put thy hand into her bosome? goe to. Iuno in Lucian deorum dial. 3. Tom. 3. complaines to Iupiter of Ixion

                        he looked so attentiuely on her, and sometimes would sighe and weepe in her companie, and when I dranke by chance and gaue Ganymede the cuppe, he would desire to drinke still in that very cuppe that I dranke off, & in the same place where I dranke, & would kisse the cup, and then looke steddily on me. If it be so they cannot come so neere to dally, or haue not that opportunity, familiaritie, or acquaintance to conferre and talke together; yet if they come in presence, their eye will bewray them: vbi amor ibi oculus, as the common saying is.

                     They cannot looke of whom they loue, they will be still gazing and staring, glancing at her, as Apollo on Leucothoe, or if she go by, looke after her as long as they can see her. Lucian in his Imagin., & Tatius, of Clitiphon say as much, Ille oculos de Leucippe,
                           Lib. 4. 
                        nunquam deijciebat & many louers confesse when they came in their mistresse presence, they could not hold off their eies. There is a pleasant story to this purpose in Nauigat. Vertom. l. 3. c. 5. The Sultan of Sanas wife in Arabia, because Vertomannus was faire & white could not looke off him from sunne-rising to sunne-setting, she could not desist, she made him one day come into her chamber, & geminae horae spatio intuebatur, non a me vnquam aciem oculorum auertebat, me obseruans veluti Cupidinem quendam, for two houres space she still gazed on him. If so be they cannot see them, they will still be walking and waiting about their mistris

doores, taking all opportunity to see them, as in Longus Sophista, Daphnis and Cloe two louers,
                           Lib 3. were still houering at one anothers gates, he sought all occasions to be in her company, to hunt and catch birds in the frost about her house in winter, that she might see him and he her. 'Tis all his felicity to be with her, to talke with her, he is neuer well but in her company, and will walke

                        seuen or eight times a day through the street where she dwels, and make sleeuelesse errands to see her: none so merry if hee may happily enioy her company, he is in heauen for the time, and if he may not, deiected in an instant, solitary, silent, weeping, lamenting, sighing, complaining still, &c.
                     But the symptomes of the mind in louers are almost infifinite, and so diuerse, that no arte can comprehend them, though they be merry sometimes, and rapt beyond themselues for ioy, yet most part loue is a plague, a torture, a hell. The Spanish Inquisition is not comparable to it, a torment and

                         From it saith Austin arise biting cares, perturbations, passions, sorrowes, feares, suspitions, discontents, contentions, discordes, warrs, trecheries, emnities, flatterie, cosening, riotte, lust, impudence, cruelty, knauery &c. these be the companions of louers, and their ordinarie symptomes, as the poets repeate them.

Most part a louers life is full of anxietie, feare and griefe, complaints & sighes, suspitious cares & discontents, except at such times that he hath lucida interualla, pleasant gales, or sudden alterations, as if his mistris smile vpon him, giue him a good looke, or kisse, or that some comfortable message be brought him, his seruice is accepted &c. then there is no happinesse in the world comparable to this.

                        For all day long he had some obiect or other to distract his sences, but in the night all ranne vpon her. All night long he lay awake, and could thinke of nothing else but her, he could not get her out of his mind, towards morning sleepe tooke a little pittie on him, he slumbred awhile, but all his dreames were of her. The same complaint Eurialus makes to his Lucretia, day and night I thinke of thee, I wish for thee, I talke of thee, call on thee, looke for thee, hope for thee, delight my selfe in thee, day and night I loue thee.

And to this end and purpose, if there be any hope of obtaining his sute, to prosequute his cause, he will spend himselfe, goods, fortunes for her, and though he loose and alienate all his freinds, be cast of, and disinherited, vtterly vndone by it, yet for her sweet sake, to inioy her he will hazard all he hath, goods, lands, and life it selfe.

Tis a common humor this a generall passion of all louers to be so affected. and which Aemilia told Aretine a courtier in Castilios discourse, 
                           Lib. 2. certè vix credam, & bona fide fateare Aretine, te non amasse, adeo vehementer, si enim verè amasses nihil prius aut potius optasses, quam amatae mulieri placere. Ea enim amoris lex est idem velle & nolle.
                         
                        surely Arctine, if thou wearst not so indeed, thou didst not loue, ingeniously confesse it, for if thou haddest been throughly inamored, thou wouldst haue desired nothing more then to please thy Mistris. For that is the law of loue, to wil and nil the same.

Sampson, David, Salomon, Hercules, Socrates &c. are iustly taxed of indiscretion in this point, the middle sort are betwixt hawke and buzard, and although they doe perceiue and acknowledge their own dotage, weakenesse, furie, yet they cannot withstand it; as well may witnesse those expostulations, and confessions of Dido in Virgil, Phaedra in Seneca, Myrrha in Ouid, Meta. 10.

                        Money (saith Zenophon) is a very acceptable and welcome guest, yet I had rather giue it my deare Clinia, then take it of others, I had rather serue him, then commaud others, I had rather be his drudge, then take my ease vndergoe any danger for his sake, then liue in securitie.

                     And yet for all this, amongst so many irksome and troublesome Symptomes, inconueniences, and passions, which are vsually incident to such persons, there be some good qualities in Louers which this affection causeth. As it makes wisemen fooles, so many times it makes fooles become wise,

                        It makes base fellowes generous, cowards, corragious, as Cardan notes out of Plutarch, couetous, liberall and munificent; clownes, civill; cruell, gentle; and wicked prophane persons, to become religious; slouens, neat; churles, mercifull; and dumbe dogges, eloquent. No passion causeth greater alterations, or more vehement of ioy or discontent. Plutarch Sympos. lib. 1. quaest. 5.

                        Plato is of opinion that the loue of Venus made Mars so valorous, a yong man will be much abashed to commit any foule offence, that shall come to the hearing or sight of his mistris. And if it were

                        possible to haue a citty or an army consist of Louers, such as loue, or are beloued, they would be extraordinary valiant and wise in their gouernement, modesty would detaine them from doing amisse, and aemulation incite them to doe that which is good and honest, and a few of them would overcome a great company of others. There is no man so pusillanimous so very a dastard, whom Loue would not incense and make a diuine temper and an heroicall spirit.

                        I doubt not but if a man had such an army of Louers, (as Castilio thinks) he might soone conquer all the world, except by chance he met with such another army of Louers, to oppose it.

                         For so perchance they might fight as that fatall dogge and fatal hare in the heauens, course one another round, and neuer

make an end. Castilio thinks Ferdinand king of Spaine had neuer conquered Granado, had not Queene Isabell and her Ladies beene present at the seige.

                        It cannot bee expressed what courage the Spanish Knights tooke, when the Ladies were present, a few Spaniards ouercame a multitude of Moores. They will vndergoe any danger whatsoeuer, as Sr

                        Tristram, Caesar or Alexander shall not be more resolute, or goe beyoud them. And not courage only doth loue adde, but as I said, wisdome and all manner of ciuility and good behauiour. Bocace hath a pleasant tale to this purpose, which hee borrowed from the Greekes, and which Beroaldus hath turned into Latine, Bebelius into verse, of Cymon and Iphiginia. This Cymon was a foole, a proper man of person, and the Gouernour of Cyprus sonne, but a very asse, insomuch that his father being ashamed of him, sent him to a farme house he had in the country to be brought vp. Where by chance, as his manner was, walking alone, he espied a gallant young Gentlewoman, named Iphiginia, a Burgomasters daughter of Cyprus with her maid by a brooke side in a little thicket, fast a sleep in her smocke, where she had newly bathed her selfe: When 
                        
                           Hanc vbi conspicatus est Cymon baculo innixus immobilis stelit & mirabundus, &c.
                         
                        Cymon saw her he stood leaning on his staffe gaping on her, immoueable and in a maze; at last fell to farre in loue with the glorious obiect, that he beganne to rouze himselfe vp, and to bethinke him what he was, and would needs follow her to the citty, and for her sake beganne to be ciuill, to learne to sing and dance, to play of Instruments, & got all those Gentlemen like qualities and complements in a short space, which his friendes were most glad of. In breefe, he became from an Idiot and a Clowne, to be one of the most compleat Gentlman in Cyprus and did many valorous exploits, and all for the loue of Mistris Iphiginia. In a word, I may say thus much of them all, let them be neuer so clownish, rude and horrid, Gobrians and

sluts, if once they be in loue, they will be most neat & spruce and beginne to trick vp, and to haue a good opinion of themselues. A shippe is not so long a rigging, as a young Gentlewoman a trimming vp her selfe, against her sweet-heart comes. A painters shop, a flowry meddowe, no so gratious an aspect as a young maid, a Nouitsa, or Venetian Bride, that lookes for an husband, or a yong man that is her suiter (composed lookes, composed gate, cloaths, gestures, actions, all composed) all the graces, elegances in the world are in her face: their best robes, Iewels, Laces, Spangles, must come on,

                        If once he be besotted on a wench, he must lye awake a nights, renounce his booke, sigh and lament, and now and then weepe for his hard hap, and marke aboue all things what Hats, Bands, Dublets, Breeches are in fashion, how to cut his Beard, and weare his loue-locke, to turne vp his Munshato's, and curle his head, prune his Pickitivant, or if he weare it broad that the East side be corespondent to the West: he must be in league with an excellent Tayler, Barber, haue neat shooe-ties, points, garters, speake in print, walke in print, eat and drinke all in print, and that which is all in all, hee must be mad in print.
                     
                     Amongst all other good qualities an amorous fellowe must haue, he must learne to sing and dance, play vpon some Instrument or other, as without all doubt hee will, if hee be truely touched with this loadstone of loue. For as

'Tis their chiefest study to sing, and dance, and without question, so many gentlemen and gentlewomen would not be so well qualified in this kinde, if loue did not incite them.

                        Who, saith Castilio, would learne to play, or giue his minde to musicke, or learne to dance, or make so many rimes, Loue-songs, as most doe, but for womens sake, but that they hope by that meanes to purchase their good wills, and winne their fauours. Constantine agricult. lib. 11 cap. 18. Makes Cupid himselfe to bee a great dancer, by the same token as he was capering amongst the Gods,

                         made a many of young wenches

still a dancing, to signifie belike that Cupid was much affected with it. Praxitiles in all his Pictures of Loue, made Cupid still smiling, and looking vpon dancers. And many times this Loue will make old men dance, and maske and mumme, for Comus and Hymen loue Maskes, and all such merriments aboue measure, and will allow men to put on womens apparell in some cases, and to dance men of all sorts. Paulus Iouius taxeth Augustine Niphus the Philosopher,

                        For that being and old man and a publike Professor, a father of many children, he was so mad for the loue of a young maid (that which many of his friends were ashamed to see) an olde gouty fellowe dance after Fidlers. Many laughed him to scorne for it, but this omnipotent loue would haue it so, and who can withstand it. If once we be in loue, yong or old, though our teeth shake in our heads, there is no remedy we must dance. Plutarch Sympos. 1. quaest. 5. doth in some sort excuse it, & telleth vs moreouer in what sence, Musicam docet amor, licet priùs fuerit rudis, how Loue makes them that had no skill before, learne to sing and dance, he concludes 'tis only that power and prerogatiue Loue hath ouer vs. 
                           De taciturno loquacem facit & de verecundo officiosum reddit de negligente industrium de socorde impigrū.
                         
                        Loue, as hee holds will make a silent man speake, a modest man most officious, dull, quick▪ slowe, nimble; and that which is most to be admired, an hardbase vntractable Churle, as fire doth Iron in a smithes Forge, facile, gentle, and easie to be intreated; for which cause many compare Loue to wine, which makes men Iouial and merry, sing and dance,
                     But aboue all the other Symptomes of Louers, this is not lightly to be ouerpassed, that likely of what condition soeuer if once they be in loue, they turne to their ability, Rimers, Ballet-makers, and Poets. For as Plutarch saith, 
                           Ipsi enim volunt suarum amasiarum pulchritudinis praecones ac testes esse, eas laudibus & cantilenis & versibus exornare, vt auro statuas vt memorentur & ab omnibus admirentur.
                         
                        They will be witnesses and trumpettors of their Paramours good parts, bedecking them with verses and commendatory songs, as wee doe statues with gold, that they may bee remembred and admired of all. Old men will dote in this kinde sometimes as well as the best.

Loue and Bacchus are so violent Gods, and so furiously rage in our minds, that they make vs forget all honesty, shame and common ciuility. For such men commonly as are throughly possessed with this humour, are insensati; beside themselues, and as I haue prooued, no better then beasts, Irrationall, stupid, head-strong, void of feare of God or men, they frequently forsware themselues, steale, commit incests, rapes, adulteries, murders, depolutate

Townes, Citties, Countries, to satisfie their lust.

And as this method of

Musick, merriment, singing, dancing, doth augment the passion in some Louers, as

                     If there be any need of physicke, that the humors bee altered, or any new matter aggregated, they must bee cured as melancholy men. Carolus à Lorme amongst other questions, discussed for his degree at Montpelier in France, hath this, an Amantes & amentes ijsdem remedijs curentur? Whether Louers and madmen be cured by the same remedies, he affirmes it, for loue extended is meere madnesse. Such physicke then as is prescribed, is either inward or outward, as hath been formerly handled, in the precedent Partition in the Cure of Melancholy.

                     The sight of drinke makes one drie, and the sight of meate increaseth appetite. Especially if he haue beene formerly inamored, the sight of his mistresse strikes him into a new fit, and makes him raue many dayes after.

                        It is a good happinesse to be free from this passion of loue, and great discretion it argues in such a man that can so containe himselfe, but when thou art once in loue to moderate thy selfe (as he saith) is a singular point of wisedome.
                     
                     But for as much as few men are free, or that can containe themselues and moderate their passions, curbe their sences, as not to see them, not to looke lasciuiouslly, not to conferre with them, such is the furie of this head strong passion, and their weakenesse; we must vse some speedy meanes to correct, and preuent that and al other inconueniences, that come by conference and the like.

those precedent remedies, it will hardly be remoued: but these commonly are of force. Foelix Plater obser. lib. 1. had a baker to his patient almost mad for the loue of his maide, and desperate; by remouing her from him, he was in a short space cured. Peter Godefridus, in the last chapter of his third booke, hath a story of Saint Ambrose, of a young man that meeting his old loue after long abscence, on whom he had extreamely doted, would scarce take notice of her, she wondred at it that he should so lightly esteem her, called him againe and told him who she was, Ego sum inquit. At ego non sum ego. But he replied he was not the same man, loathing his folly, and ashamed of that which he formerly had done. Petrarch hath such another tale of a young gallant that loued a wench with one eye, and for that cause by his parents was sent to trauell into farre countries, 
                           cum post aliquot annos iam reuersus ille obuiam sactus esset quam vehementer amarat, rogat quo casu illa oculum amisissit, non inquit amisi oculum sed tu oculos inuenisti.
                         
                        after some yeeres he returned, and meeting the maid for whose sake he was sent abroad, asked her how and by what chance she lost her eye, no said she I haue lost none, but you haue found yours: Signifying therby that all louers were blind, as Fabius saith, Amantes de formâ iudicare non possunt, louers cannot iudge of beautie, nor scarce of any thing else, as they will easily confesse after they returne vnto themselues, by some discontinuance or better aduice, and wonder at their owne folly, madnesse, stupidity, blindnes, condemne themselues that euer they should be so besotted and misled, and be heartily glad that they haue so happily escaped.
                     If so be that, (which is seldome) that change of place will not effect his alteration, then other remedies are to bee annexed, faire and foule meanes as to perswade, promise, threaten, terrifie, or to diuert by some contrary passion, rumour, tales, newes, or some wittie inuention, to alter his affection,

Which those seuen Persian Princes did to Assuerus, that they might requite the desire of Queene Vasth with the loue of others. Pausanias in Eliacis saith, that therefore one Cupid was painted to contend with another, and to take the garland from him, because one loue driues out another.

Let him see the euent and successe of others, Sampson, Hercules, Holofernes, &c. those infinite mischiefes attend it. If she be honest, she is either maide, widdow, or another mans wife: if another mans wife, 'tis abominable in the sight of God, and men, adultery, and expresly forbidden in Gods commaundement, a mortall sin, able to endanger his soule, & if he be such a one as feares God, or haue any religion, he will eschew it, and abhorre the lothsomenesse of his owne fact. If a maide, to abuse or marry her: if to abuse, 'tis fornication, a foule fact, and almost equall to adultery it selfe. If to marry, let him seriously consider what he takes in hand, looke befoe he leape, and examine first the partie and condition of his estate and hers,

But put case she bee equall in yeeres, birth, fortunes, and other qualities correspondent, and he doth desire to be coupled in marriage, which is an honourable estate, but for what respects? her beautie belike, and comlinesse of person, that is commonly the maine obiect, she is a most absolute forme in his eye at least, but doe other men affirme as much? or is it an errour in thy iudgement? It may be to thee thy selfe vpon a more serious examination, or after a little abscence, she is not so faire as she seemes. Quadam videntur & non sunt.

They take a pride to pranke vp themselues, to make young men enamored and dote on them, and to runne mad for their sakes. As Atalanta they must be ouerrunne, or wone. Many young men are as obstinate, and as curious in their choice, as irrefragable and peeuish on the other side, Narcissus like,

They should not be too seuere in that kinde, especially if there bee no such vrgent occasion, or grieuous impediment. Pouerty and base parentage may be sufficiently recompensed by many other good qualities, modesty, vertue, religion, and good bringing vp.

                     But they need no such exhortation, they are commonly too forward. If there be an escape, and all be not as it should, as Diogenes strooke the father when his sonne swore, because he taught him no better; if a maid or young man miscarry, I think their parents often times, Gardians, Ouerseers, Gouernours, are in as much fault, and ought as seuerely to bee punished as the child, in prouiding for them no sooner.
                     Another let or hinderance is strict and seuere discipline, lawes and rigorous customes that forbidde men to marry at some set times, and in some places. As Prentises, Seruants, Collegiats, states of liues in coppy holds, or in some base inferiour offices,

They may indeed, I deny not, marry if they will, and haue free choice; but in the meane time their case is desperate, Lupum auribus tenent, they hold a woolfe by the eares, they must either burne or starue. 'Tis Cornutum sophisma, hard to resolue, if they marry they forfeit their estates, they are vndone and starue themselues

                        No not in that seuere family of Stoicks, that will not submit his graue beard, and supercilious lookes to the clipping of a wife, or disagree from his fellowes in this point. Since then this of marriage, is the last and best refuge, and cure of Heroicall loue, all doubts are cleered, and all impediments remoued; I say againe what remaines then, but according to both their desires, they bee happily ioyned, since it cannot otherwise bee helped. If all parties be pleased, 'tis a match.

                        VAicscus de Taranta cap. de Melanchol. Aelian Montaltus, Faelix Platerus, Guianerius, put Iealousie for a cause of Melancholy, others for a Symptome; because melancholy persons amongst other passions and perturbations of the mind, are most obnoxious to it. But me thinkes for the latitude it hath, and that prerogatiue aboue other ordinary Symptomes, it ought to be treated of as a Species a part, being of so great and eminent note, so furious a passion, and almost of as great extent as Loue it selfe, as In his Oration of Ielosie put out by Fran. Sanseuino
                         
                        Benedetto Varchi holds, No loue without a mixture of Iealousie. For these causes I will dilate it, & treate of it by it selfe, as a bastard branch or kinde of Loue-melancholy, and of like note; which as Heroicall loue goeth commonly before marriage, this vsually followes, and tortures and crucifies in like sort, and deserues thereforé to be rectified alike, and requires as much care and industry in setting out the seuerall causes of it, prognosticks, and cures. Which I haue more willingly done; that he that is or hath beene Iealous, may see his error as in a glasse, he that is not may learne hence to detest it, auoid it himselfe, and dispossesse others that are any way affected with it.

With a godly Iealousie to present them a pure Virgin to Christ, and he was afraid still least as the Serpent beguiled Eua through his subtelty, so their mindes should be corrupt from the simplicity that is in Christ.

Fidem suam liberet, for my part I doe beleeue it may be true, for Swannes haue euer beene branded with that Epithite of iealousie.

Bodine cap. 5. method. hist. ascribes a great cause to the country or clime, and discourseth largely there of this subiect, saying that southerne men are more hot lascivious & iealous, then such as liue in the north, they can hardly containe themselues in those hotter climes, but are most subiect to prodigious lusts.

He telleth moreouer, how that when he was Embassader in England he heard Mendoza the spanish Legat finding falt with it, as a filthy custome for men and women to sit promiscuously in Churches together, but Dr. Dale the master of the Requests told him againe, that it was indeede a filthy custome in Spaine, where they could not containe themselues from lasciuious thoughts in their holy places, but not with vs. We are farre from any such strange conceits, and will permit our wiues and daughters to goe to the Tauerne with a friend, as Aubanus saith, modo absit lasciuia, and suspect nothing to kisse comming & going, which as Erasmus writes in one of his Epistles, they cannot endure. Some make a question whether this head-strong passion, rage more in women then men, as Montaigne lib. 3. But sure it is more outragious in women, as all other Melancholy is, by reason of the weakenesse of their sexe. Scaliger Poet li. ca. 13. concludes against women,

                     Comparisons are odious, I neither paralel them with others, nor debate them any more: men and women are both badde and too subiect to this pernitious infirmitie. It is most part a symptome and cause of melancholy, as Plater and Valescus teach vs: melancholy men are apt to be iealous, and iealous, apt to be melancholy.

                     If idlenesse concurre with melancholy, such persons are most apt to be iealous, and 'tis

                        Neuisanus note. An idle woman is presumed to be lasciuious and often iealous. And 'tis not vnlikely for they haue no other businesse to trouble their heads with.
                     More particular causes be these which follow. Impotentencie first, when a man is not able of himselfe, to performe those dewes which he ought vnto his wife, and he perceiues her to be more crauing, clamorous, vnsatiable and prone to lust then is fit, he begins presently to suspect that wherein he is defectiue, she will satisfie her selfe, she will be pleased by some other meanes. This cause is most euident in old men,

that are cold and drie by nature, and married succi plenis, to young wanton wiues, with old doting Ianiuere in Chaucer they beginne to mistrust all is not well. And how should it otherwise be? Old age is a disease of it selfe, lothsome, fulsome, full of suspition & feare, when it is at best, vnable, vnfit for such matters.

                        All women are slippery, vnfaithfull to their husbands most part, as Aeneas Siluius epist, 83. seconds him, but to old men most treacherous of all: they had rather mortem amplexarier le with a corse then with such a man. On the other side most men saith Hieronymus are suspitious of their wiues, 
                           Vix aliqua non impudica, & quam non suspectum meritò quis habeat.

                        Apuleius of an old, bald, bedridden knaue she had to her husband. Poore woman as I am, what shall doe? I haue an old grimme sire to my husband as bald as a gourde, as little and as vnable as a child, he keepes all the doores barred and locked vpon me, woe is me, what shall I doe? He was iealous, and she made him cuckold for keeping her vp: suspition without a cause, hard vsage is able of it selfe to make a woman flie out, that was otherwise honest. Nam quando mulieres cognoscunt maritum hoc aduertere licentius peccant, as

                         The first night, hauing liberally taken his liquor (as in that countrey they doe) my fine scholler was so fusled, that he no sooner was laid in bed, but he fell fast asleepe, and neuer waked till morning, and then much abashed, he made an excuse, I know not what, out of Hippocrates Cous, &c. and for that time it went currant, but when as afterward he did not play the man as he should doe, she fell in league with a good fellow, and whilest he sate vp late at his study about his Critisismes, mending some hard places in Festus or Pollux, and came cold to bed, and would tell her stil what he had done, she did not much regard what he said, &c.

                     A third eminent cause of iealousie may be this, when hee that is deformed hirsute and ragged, and very vertuously giuen, will marry some very faire niec piece, or some light huswife, he begins to misdoubt (as well he may) she doth not affect him.

rich man honest, a proper woman not proud or vnchast. Can she be faire and honest too? He that marries a wife that is snout faire, alone, let him looke, saith Barbarus,

And 'tis impossible almost in such cases thy wife should containe, or the goodman not be iealous, for when he is so farre defectiue himselfe, ill proportioned, vnpleasing in those parts which women most effect, and shee most absolutly faire on the other side. If she be not very vertuously giuen, how can she loue him, and although she be not faire, yet if he admire her and thinke her so, in his conceit she is absolute, he holds it vnpossible for any man living not to dote as he doth, to looke on her and not lust, not to couet, and if he be in company with her, not to lay siege to her stonestly: or else out of a deepe apprehension of his infirmities, deformities, and other mens good parts, he suspects she cannot affect him, or be not so kind and louing as shee should, shee certainely loues some other man better then himselfe.

Though her husband be proper and tall, and faire and louely to behold, and able to giue contentment to any one woman; yet she will taste of the forbidden fruit, Iuuenalls Iberina to an haire, she is as well pleased with one eye as one man.

Both, to say truth, are often faulty, Men and Women, and giue iust occasions in this humour of discontent, and aggrauate & yeeld matter of suspition, but most part the chiefe causes proceeds from other aduentitious accidents, and circumstances, though the parties be free and both well giuen themselues. The vndiscreet carriage of some lasciuious gallant, (& è contrae of some light woman,) by his often frequenting of an house, and bold vnseemly gestures, may make a breach, and by his ouer familiarity, if he be inclined to yellownesse, colour him quite out. If he be poore, basely borne, saith Benedetto Varchi, and otherwise vnhandsome, hee suspects him the lesse, but if a proper man, well descended, commendable for his good parts, he taketh on the more, & watcheth his doings. Now when those other circumstances of time and place, opportunity and importunity shall concurre, what will they not effect?

                           Faire opportunity can winne the coyest she that is,
                           So wisely he takes time as hee'l be sure he will not misse,
                           Then he that rules her gamesome vain, & tempers toyes with art
                           Brings loue that swimmeth in her eyes, to diue into her heart.
                        
As at Playes, Maskes, great feasts and banquets, one singles out his wife to dance, another courts her in his presence, a third tempts her, &c. and then, as † he saith,

                           She may un while in chastity abide,
                           That is assaid on euery side.

For besides that Feare and Sorrowe, which is common to all melancholy, anxiety of mind, restles thoughts palenesse, leanenesse, meagernesse, neglect of businesse and the like, these men are farther yet misaffected, and in an higher straine.

Hee will sometimes sigh, weepe, sob for anger, sweare and bely, slander any man, curse, threaten, brawle, raue; and sometimes againe flatter and speake faire, aske forgiuenesse, and then againe impatient as hee is, raue, and lay about him like a madde man, accusing and suspecting not strangers only, but Brothers and Sisters, Father and Mother, nearest and dearest friends. Hee thinks with those Italians,

If the necessity of his businesse bee such that hee must goe from home, he doth either locke her vp, or commit her with a deale of iniunctions and protestations, to some trusty friends him and her he sets and bribes to ouersee; and yet all this will not serue, though his businesse be very vrgent, hee will when he is halfe way come backe againe in post hast, rise frō supper, or at midnight and be gone, and sometimes leaue his businesse vndone. Though there be no danger at all, no cause of suspition, she liue in such a place, in such a company where Messalina her selfe could not bee dishonest if she would, yet he suspects her as much as if she were in a bawdy howse, or some Princes Court, or in a common Inne where all commers might haue free accesse. no perswasion, no protestation can diuert this passion, nothing can ease him, or giue him satisfaction. It is most strange to report what outragious acts by men and women haue beene committed in this kinde; by women especially, that will runne after their husbands into all places, all companies, as

Gomesius in his third booke of the life and deeds of Francis Ximenius sometimes Archbishoppe of Toledo, hath a strange story of that incredible Iealosie of Ioane Queene of Spaine, wife to King Philip, and mother of Ferdinande and Charles the 5. Emperours; when her husband Philip either for that he was tyred with his wiues iealosie, or had some great businesse went into the Lowe countries; shee was so impatient and melancholy vpon his departure, that she would scarse eat her meat or conuerse with any man, and though shee were with child and the season of the yeare very bad, the winde against her, In all hast shee would to sea after him. Neither Isabella her Queene mother, or the Archbishop, or any other friend could

perswade her to the contrary, but shee would after him. When she was now come into the Low-countries, & kindly entertained by her husband, she could not containe her selfe,

It is an ordinary thing for women in such cases, to scrat the faces, slit the noses of such as they suspect. Or if it be so they dare not or cannot execute any such tyrannicall iniustice, they wil raile and reuile them, beare them deadly hate and malice, as 
                           Annal. lib. 12. Principis mulieris zelotypae est in alias mulieres quas su spectas habet, odium inseparabile.
                         
                        Tacitus obserues, The hatred of a iealous woman is inseparable against such as she suspects. So did Agrippina by Lollia, and Calphurnia in the dayes of Claudius. But women are sufficiently curbed in such cases, the rage of men is more eminent, and more frequently put in practise. See but with what rigor those iealous husbands tyrannise ouer their poore wiues, In Greece, Spaine, Italy, Turkey, Africke, Asia, and generally ouer all those hot countries, they locke them vp still and will suffer no body to come at them, or their wiues to come abroad, and if they be great persons they haue Eunuchs to keepe them, as the Grand Senior amongst the Turkes, the Sophies of Persia, those Tartarian Mogors, and Kings of China.

                           No liquors force prevailes or any plaister,
                           No skill of starres, no depth of Magicke art,
                           Deuised by that great clerke Zoroaster,
                           A wound that so infects the soule and heart,
                           As all our sense and reason it doth master,
                           A wound whose pange and torment is so durable,
                           As it may rightly called be incurable.
                         Yet what I haue formerly said of other Melancholy, I may say againe, it may bee cured or mittigated at least by some contrary passion, good counsell and perswasion, if it be with stood in the beginning, maturely resisted, and as those ancient holds, 
                              Veteres maturè suadent vngues amoris esse radendos priusquam producant se nimis.
                            the nayles of it be pared before they growe too long. No better meanes to resist or expell it then by auoiding idlenesse, to be still seriously busied about some matters of importance,

to driue out those vaine, faire, foolish phantasies, & irksome suspitions out of his head, and then to be perswaded by his iudicious friends, to giue eare to their good counsell and aduice, and wisely to consider with himselfe, how much he discredits himselfe, his friends, grieues himselfe and others, what an argument of weaknesse it is, how absurd a thing in it selfe, how ridiculous, how brutish a passion, how sottish, how odious, how harebraine, mad and furious: If he will but heare them speake no doubt he may be cured.

                        Ioane Queen of Spaine, of whom I haue formerly spoken, vnder pretense of change of ayre, was sent to Complutum, or Alcada de las Heneras, where Ximenius the Archbishop of Toledo then liued that by his good counsell (as for the present shee was) shee might be eased. 
                           Vrit enim praecordia aegritudo animi compressa, & in angustias adducta mentem subvertit, nec alio medicamine facilius erigitur, quā cordati hominis sermone.
                         
                        For a disease of the soule if concealed tortures and ouerturnes it, and by no physicke can sooner bee remooued then by a discreet mans comfortable speeches. I will not here insert any consolotary sentences to this purpose, or forestall any mans inuention, but leaue it euery man to dilate and amplifie as he shall thinke fit himselfe: let him aduise with Siracides cap. 9.1. and read that comfortable and pithy speech to this purpose of Ximenius in the author himselfe, as it is recorded by Gomesius, or with Chaloner lib. 9. de repub. Anglòr: or Caelia in her Epistles &c. Only this I will adde, that if it be considered aright, this which causeth this iealous passion, be it iust or vniust, whether without cause true or false, it ought not so haynously to be taken; 'tis no such reall or capitall matter, that it should make so deepe a wound. 'Tis a blowe that hurts not, an insensible smart, grownded many times vpon false suspition alone, and so fostered by a sinister conceipt. If she be not dishonest he troubles and macerates himselfe without a cause, or put case which is the worst, he be a Cuckold, it cannot be helped, the more he stirres in it, the more hee aggrauates his owne miseries. How much better in such a case to dissemble or contemne it, why should that be feared which cannot be redressed, multae tandem deposuerunt (saith 3. De anima.

when they see there is no remedy, haue beene pacified, and shall men be more iealous then women? 'Tis some comfort in such a case to haue companions, Solamen miseris socios habuisse doloris. Who can say he is free? Who can assure himselfe he is not one de praeterito, or secure himself de futuro? If it were his case alone it were hard, but being as it is a common calamity, 'tis not so grieuously to be taken. In some countries they make nothing of it, ne nobilis quidem, saith

In some places and some persons you may as soone enioyne them to carry water in a Ciffe, as to keepe themselues honest. What shall a man doe now in such a case? What remedy is to be had, how shall he be eased? By suing a diuorce, that is hard to be effected, si non caste tamen cautè, they carry the matter so cunningly, that though it be as common as Simony, and as cleere, as manifest as the nose on a mans face, yet it cannot be euidently proued. Much better put it vp, the more he stirres in it, the more hee shall diuulge and publish his owne shame; make a vertue of necessity, and conceale it, there is no remedy but patience.

Whereas charity, or a well disposed mind would interpret all vnto the best. S. Francis by chance seeing a Frier familiarly kissing another mans wife, was so far from misconceauing it, that hee presently kneeled downe and thanked God there was so much charity left: but they on the other side will ascribe nothing to naturall causes, indulge nothing to familiarity, mutuall society, friendship, but out of a sinister suspition, presently lock them close, watch them thinking by that meanes to preuent all such inconuenience, that's the way to helpe it, whereas by that meanes they doe aggravate the mischiefe. 'Tis but in vaine to watch that which will away.

The best course then is to let them haue their owne wills, giue them free liberty, without any keeping. If she be honest as Penelope, Lucretia, she will so continue her honour, good name, credit, the vowe shee made vnto her husband: loue, vertue, religion, zeale, are better keepers then all those locks, Eunuchs, prisons, she will not be moued.

Such are the properties and conditions of good women, and if she be well giuen, she will so carry her selfe; if otherwise she be naught, vse all the meanes thou canst, she will be naught. She hath so many lies, excuses, trickes, Panders, Bawds, shifts to deceaue, 'tis to no purpose to keepe her vp, or to reclaime her by hard vsage. Faire meanes peraduenture may doe somewhat,

Iocundo in Ariosto found his wife in bed with a knaue, both asleepe, went his waies and would not so much as wake them, much lesse reproue

                         An honest fellow finding in like sort his wife had plaid false at tables, and born a man too many, drew his dagger, and swore if he had not beene his very friend hee would haue kill'd him. Another hearing one had done that for him, which no man desires to be done by a deputy, followed in a rage with his sword drawne, and hauing ouertaken him, laid adultery to his chardge, the offender hotly persued, confessed it was true, with whose honest confession hee was satisfied, and so left him, swearing that if he had denied, he would not haue put it vp. How much better is it to doe thus, then to macerate himselfe, impatiently to raue and rage: how much better to contemne in such cases, or to take no notice of it, Melius sic errare quam zelotypia curis, saith Erasmus, se conficere, better be a witall & put it vp, then to trouble himselfe to no purpose. And though he doe not omnibus dormire, yet to winke at it as many doe, if it bee for his commodity, or some great man his Land-lord, Patrone, benefactor, or so to let it passe. Howsoeuer the best way is to contemne it, which

                     OF such remedies as conduce to the cure of this maladie, I haue sufficiētly treated, there be some good remedies remaining, by way of preuention, precautions or admonitions, which if right practised may doe much good. Plato in his common-wealth, to preuent this mischiefe belike would haue all things common, wiues and children, all common, and which Caesar in his Commentaries obserued of old Brittaines that first inhabited this land, they had ten or twelue wiues alotted to such a family, or promiscuously to be vsed by so many men; not one to one as with vs, or foure fiue or sixe to one, as in Turkie.

stripped himselfe naked before the Bishop of Assise and others: and Friar Leonarde for the same cause, went through Viterbium in Italie starke belly naked. Our Pseudocatholickes, to helpe these inconueniences which proceed from iealousie, and keepe themselues & their wiues honest, make seuere lawes against adultery, present death, and withall fornication a veniall sinne, as a sincke to conuey that furious and swift streame of concupiscence, they appoint and permit stewes, the more to secure their wiues in all populous citties, for they hold them as necessary as Churches, and howsoeuer vnlawfull, yet to auoid a greater mischiefe to be tollerated in pollicy, as vsury for the hardnesse of mens hearts, and for this ende they haue whole Colledges of Curtesans in all their townes and citties. For they hold it vnpossible for idle persons, young, rich and lusty, so many seruants, Monkes, Friers, to liue honest, too tyrannicall a burden to compell them to be chaste, and most vnsit to suffer poore men younger brothers, souldiers, all to marry; as those diseased persons, votaries, priests, seruants. Therefore as well to helpe and ease the one as the other, they tollerate and winke at these kind of brothel-houses and stewes. Many probable arguments they haue to prooue the lawfulnesse, the necessitie, and a tolleration of them, as of vsury, and without question in pollicie they are not to be contradicted; but altogether in religion. Others prescribe philters, spells, charmes, to keepe men and women honest.

a perpetuall cause of suspition, and be distastefull to each other.

Whether he may delight himselfe as those Priapeian Popes, which in their decrepit age lie commonly betweene two young wenches euery night, contactu formosarum & contrectatione num adhuc gaudeat, & as many doting Syres still do to their owne shame, their childrens vndoing, and their families confusion: he abhorres it tanquam ab agresti & furioso domino fugiendum it must be auoided as a mad bedlame master, and not to be obeyed.

                            they that are coupled together not to get children, but to satisfie them lust, are not husbands but fornicators, with whom St. Austin consents: matrimony without hope of children, non matrimonium sed concubium dici debet, is not a wedding but a iumbling or coupling together.

                     Howsoeuer, I would aduise thee thus much, be she faire or foule, to choose a wife out of a good kindred, parentage, well brought vp, in a good place. He that marries a wife out of a suspected Inne or Alehouse, buies a horse in Smithfield, and hires a seruant in Paules, shall likely haue a Iade to his horse, a knaue for his man, an arrant honest woman to his wife.

                         After marriage I can giue no better admonitions then to vse their wiues well, to maintaine them to their meanes, and let

them haue liberty with discretion, as time and place requires: many women turne queanes by compulsion, as

                        Neuisanus obserues, because their husbands are so hard, and keepe them so short in diet and apparell, paupertas cogit eas meretricari: pouerty and hunger, want of meanes, makes them dishonest, or bad vsage; their churlish behauiour makes them flie out, or bad example, they doe it to crie quittance. In the other extreame some are too liberall, as the Prouerbe is, Turdus malum sibi cacat, they make a rod for their owne tayles, whilst they giue their wiues too much liberty to gad abroad and bountifull allowance, they are accessary to their owne miseries, their wiues as

He setts out his sonne and his Church, in that Epithalamium or misticall song of Solomon, to enamour vs the more, comparing his head, to fine gold, his lockes curled and blacke as a rauen, Cant. 4.5. cap. his eyes like doues, on riuers of waters washed with milke, his lippes as lillies, dropping downe pure iuyce, his hands as ringes of gold set with crysolite: and his Church to a vineyard a garden enclosed, a fountaine of liuing waters, an orchard of Pomegranets, with sweet sents of saffron, spike, calamus and cynamon, and all the trees of incense, as the chiefe spices, the fairest amongst women, no spot in her,

That by these figures, that glasse, these spirituall eyes of contemplation, we might perceiue some resemblance of his beautie, the loue betwixt his Church and him. And so in the 45.

Likning it to a citty of pure gold, like vnto cleare glasse, shining and garnished with all manner of precious stones, hauing no neede of Sunne or Moone, for the lambe is the light of it, the glory of God doth illuminate it: to giue vs to vnderstand the infinite glory, beautie and happinesse of it. Nor that it is not fairer, then these creatures to which it is compared, but that this vision of his, this lustre of his diuine Maiestie cannot otherwise be expressed to our apprehensions, no tongue can tell it, no heart conceius it, as Paul saith. Moses himselfe, Exod. 33.18. When he desired to see God in his glory, was answered that he might not endure it, no man could see his face and liue. Sensibile forte destruit sensum.

                        Austin calles it, the quintescence of beautie this, which farre excells the beautie of heauens, Sunne and Moone, Starres, Angells, gold and siluer, woods and faire fields, and whatsoeuer is pleasant to behold. All those other beauties faile, varrie, are subiect to corruption, to lothing, 
                           Immortalis haec visio immortalis amor, indefessus amor & visio.
                         
                        But this is an immortall vision, a diuine beautie, an immortall loue, an indefatigable loue and beautie, with sight of which we shall neuer be tired, nor wearied, but still the more we see him the more wee shall couet him.

                        For as one saith, where this visiō is, there is absolute beautie, and where is that beautie, from the same fountaine comes all pleasure and happinesse, neither can beauty, pleasure, happinesse, be separated from his vision or sight, or his vision from beautie, pleasure, happinesse. In this life wee haue but a glimse of this beautie and happinesse, we shall hereafter as Iohn saith see him as he is, thine eyes as Isai. promiseth, 33.17. Shall behold the King in his glory, then shall we be perfectly

inamoured, and haue a full fruition of it, and desire and behold and loue him alone, as the most amiable and fairest obiect, our summum bonum or chiefest good.

truely enamored, but we come short in both, wee neither loue God, nor our neighbour as we should. Our loue in spirituall things is two

Vulgus amicitias vtilitate probat. The chiefe thing we respect is our commodity, and what we doe is for feare of worldly punishment, for vaine-glory, praise of men, or for fashions sake, and such by-respects, not for Gods sake. We neither knowe God aright, nor seeke or loue or worship him as we should. And for these defects, we inuolue our selues into a multitude of errors, we swarue from this true loue and worship of God, which is a cause vnto vs of vnspeakable miseries, running into both extreames, wee become fooles, madmen, without sence, as now in the next place I will shew you.

For methods sake I will reduce them to a twofold diuision, according to those two extreames of Excesse and Defect. Not that there is any excesse of diuine worship or loue of God, that cannot be, we cannot loue God too much, or doe our duties as wee ought, as Papists hold, or haue any perfection in this life, much lesse supererogate, when we haue all done, we are vnprofitable servants.

It adds courage, boldnesse, & begets generous spirits, although tyrants rage, and persecute, and that bloody Lictor or Seriant be ready to martyr them, aut lita aut morere (as in those persecutions of the Primitiue Church, it was put in practise, as you may read in Eusebius and others) though enimies be now ready to inuade, and all in an vproare.

Sometimes by dreames, visions (as God to Moses by familiar conference) the Diuell in seuerall shapes talkes with them, in the Indies 'tis common, and in China, apparitions, inspirations, oracles, apparitions by terrifying them with false prodigies;

The primum mobile therefore, and first moouer of all superstition is the Diuell, that great enimy of mankinde, the principall agent; who in a thousand seuerall shapes, after seuerall fashions, with seuerall engines, illusions, and by seuerall names hath deceaued the inhabitants of the earth, in seuerall places, and countries, still reioycing at their falls. All the world ouer almost before Christs time hee freely domineered, and held the soules of men in most slauish subiection, saith

But it is no maruell, when as we see al out as great effects, amongst Christians themselues: how are those Anabaptists, Arrians, and Papists aboue the rest miserably besotted.

                        Heliogabalus put out the vestall fire at Rome, expelled the virgines, and banished all other Religions all ouer the world, and would be the sole God himselfe. Our Turkes, China kings, great Chams, and Mogors, doe little lesse, assuming diuine and bumbast titles to themselues, the meaner sort are too credulous, and led with blind zeale, blind obedience to prosecute and maintaine whatsoeuer their sottish leaders shall propose, what they in pride or singularitie, reuenge, spleene or for gaine, shall rashly maintaine and broch, their disciples make a matter of conscience, of hell and damnation if they doe it not, and will rather forsake wiues, children, house, and home, lands, goods, fortunes, life it selfe, then omit or abiure the

least title of it, and to aduance the common cause, vndergoe any miseries, turne traytors, assassinates, with full assurance and hope of reward in that other world, that they shall surely merite by it, winne heauen, be canonised for Saints. Now when they are throughly possessed with blind zeale, and nusled with superstition, he hath many other baites to inueagle & infatuate them farther yet, to make them quite mortified and mad, and that vnder colour of perfection, to merite by pennance, going wolward, whipping, almes, fastings &c. ex opere operato, ex condigno, for themselues and others, to macerate and consume themselues, specie virtutis & vmbrâ, those Euangelicall councels, as our pseudocatholickes call them, of Canonicall obedience, wilfull pouerty,

Amongst the rest fasting, contemplation, solitarinesse, are as it were certaine Rammes, by which he doth batter and worke vpon the strongest constitutions: Nonnulli saith Peter Forestus, ob longas inedias, stadia & meditationes caelestes, derebus sacris & religione semper agitant, by fasting ouermuch, and diuine meditations, are ouercome. Not that fasting is a thing of it selfe to bee discommended, for it is an excellent meanes to keepe the body in subiection, 
                           Mater sanitatis, clauis caelorum: ala animae quae leues penuas producat vt in sublime ferat, currus spiritus sancti, vexillum fidei, porta paradisi, vita angelorum, &c.

The Fathers are very much in commendation of it, and as Caluin notes sometimes immoderate, The mother of health, key of heauen, spirituall winge to ereare vs, the chariot of the holy Ghost, banner of Faith, &c. And 'tis true they say of it, if it be moderately and seasonably vsed, as Moses, Elias, Daniel, Christ, and his

                        Erasmus well taxeth. Caelum non sufficere putant suis meritis, heauen is to small a reward

for it. They make choice of times and meats, and buy and sell their merits, and attribute more vnto it then to the ten Commandements, and count it a greater sinne to eate meate in lent, then to kill a man. And as one saith, Plus respiciunt assum piscem, quam Christum crucifixum, plus salmonem quam Solomonem quibus in ore Christus, Epicurus in corde, when some counterfeit, and some attribute more to such workes of theirs then to Christs death and passion, the diuell sets in a foote, and strangely deludes them, and by that meanes makes them to ouerthrow the temperature of their bodies, and hazard their soules. Neuer any strange illusion of deuils amongst Hermits, Anachorites, neuer any visions, phantasmes, apparitions, Enthusiasmes, Prophets, any reuelations, but immoderate fasting, bad diet, sickenesse, melancholy, solitarinesse, or some such things were the precedent causes, the forerunners or concomitantes of them: The best opportunitie and sole occasion the diuell takes to delude them. Marsilius Caguatus lib. 1. cont. cap. 7. hath many stories to this purpose, of such as after long fasting haue bin seduced by diuels, and 
                           Lib. 8 cap. 10 de rerum varietate. admiratione digna sunt quae per ieiunium hoc modo cōtingunt, somnia, superstitio, contemptus tormentorum, mortis desideriū solitado futurorum diuinatio, obstinata opinio, insania, leiuniū, naturaliter praeparat ad hac omnia.
                         
                        tis a miraculous thing to relate (as Cardan writes) what strange accidents proceede from fasting, dreames, superstition, contempt of torments, desire of death, prophesies, paradoxes, madnesse; fasting naturally prepares men to these things. Monkes, Anachorites and the like, after much emptinesse become melancholy, vertiginous, they thinke they heare strange noyses, conferre with Hobgoblines, diuells, riuell vp their bodies, & dum hostem insequimur, saith Gregory, ciuem quem diligimus trucidamus, they become bare Skeletons, skinne and bones. Carnibus abstinentes proprias carnes deuorant, vt nil praeter cutem & ossa fit reliquum. Hilarion, as

                        Hierom reports in his life, was so bare with fasting, that the skinne did scarce sticke to the bones, for want of vapors he could not sleep, & for want of sleep became idle headed, and heard euery night infants crie, oxen lowe, wolues howle, lions roare (as he thought) clattering of harneis, strange voices, and illusions of diuells. Such symptomes are common

to those that fast long, are solitarie, giuen to contemplation, ouermuch solitarinesse & meditation. Not that these things (as I said of fasting) are to be discommended of themselues, but very behouefull in some cases and good: sobriety and contemplation ioyne our soules to God, as that heathen

But as it is abused, a meere dotage, madnesse, a cause and symptome of Religious melancholy. If you shall at any time see (saith Guatinerius) a religious person ouer superstitious, too solitary, or much giuen to fasting, that man will certainely be melancholy, thou maist boldly say it, he will be so. P. Forestus hath almost the same words,

So did the diuell of old with Apollos Priests, Amphiaraus and his fellowes, those Aegyptians, still enioyne long fasting before he would giue any oracles, and Strabo Georg. lib. 14. describes Charons denne, in the way betwixt Tralles and Nissum, whether the Priests led sicke and fanatike men. but nothing performed without

Which the Iesuits right well perceiuing, of what force this fasting and solitarie meditation is, to alter mens minds when they would make a man mad, and rauish him, and make him goe beyond himselfe, to vndertake some great businesse of

moment, to kill a king or the like, 
                           John Everardus Britano Romanus lib. edit. 1611. describes all the manner of it. they bring him into a melancholy dark chamber, where he shall see no light for many dayes together, no companie, little meate, gastly pictures of diuels all about him, and leaue him to lie as he will himselfe, on the bare flower in this chamber of meditation as they call it, on his backe, side, belly, till by this strange vsage they make him quite mad & beside himselfe. And then after some 10 dayes, as they find him animated & resolued, they make vse of him. The diuell hath many such factors, many such engines, which what effect they produce, you shal heare in these following Symptomes.

                         As Merlin when he sate by the lakes side with Vortiger, and had seene the white and red dragon fight, before he began to interprete or to speake, in sletum prorupit, fell a weeping, and then proceeded to declare to the King, what it ment: I should first pitty and bewaile this misery of humane kind, with some passionate preface, and then to my taske. For it is that great torture, that infernall plague of mortall men, and able of it selfe alone to stand in opposition to all other plagues, miseries & calamities whatsoeuer, and farre more cruell, more pestiferous, more grieuous in it selfe, more generall, more violent, of a greater Extent. Other feares and sorrowes, grieuances of body and mind, are troublesome for the time, but this is for euer, eternall damnation, hell it selfe: A plague, a fire, an inundation hurt one Prouince alone, and the losse may be recouered, but this superstition inuolues all the world almost, and can neuer be remedied.

                        superstitione imbutus animus nunquam quietus esse potest, no peace, no quietnesse. True Religion and Superstition are quite opposite, longè diuersa carnificina & pietas, as Lactantius describes, the one is an

ereares, the other deiects, the one is an easie yoke, the other an vntolerable burden, an absolute tyrannie, the one a sure anchor, an hauen, the other a tempestuous Ocean, the one makes, the other marres, the one is wisedome, the other folly, madnesse, indiscretion, the one vnfained, the other a counterfeit, the one a diligent obseruer, the other an ape; one leades to heauen, the other to hell. But these differences will more euidently appeare by their particular Symptomes. What Religion is, and of what parts it doth consist, &c. euery Catechisme will tell you, what Symptomes it hath, and and what effects it produceth, but for this superstition no tongue can tell, no penne can expresse, they are so many, so diuers, so vncertaine, inconstant, and so different from themselues. Tot mundo superstitiones, quot coelo stellae, one saith, there be as many superstitions in the world, as ther be starres in heauen, or diuells themselues that are the first founders of them: With such ridiculous absurd Symptomes and signes, so many seuerall rites, ceremonies, torments and vexations accompanying, as may well expresse & beseem the diuell to be the author and maintainer of them. I will onely point at some few of them, ex vngue leonem, guesse at the rest, and those of the chiefe kindes of superstition, which beside vs Christians, now domineir and crucifie the world, Gentiles, Mahometanes, Iewes. &c.
                     Of these Symptomes some be generall, some particular to each priuate sect: generall to all, are an extraordinary loue and affection they beare and shew to such as are of their owne sect, and more then Vatinian hate ro such as are opposite in religion as they call it, or disagree from them in their superstitious rites, blind zeale, which is as much a symptome as a cause, vaine feares, blinde obedience, needlesse workes, incredibilities, impossibilities, monstrous rites and ceremonies, wilfulnesse, blindnesse, obstinacy &c. For the first which is loue and hate, as

                        Montanus saith, nulla firmior amicitia quam quae contrahitur hinc, nulla discordia maior, quam quae à religione fit, no greater concord no greater discord, then

that which proceeds from Religion, we are all brethren in Christ. seruants of one lord, members of one body, and therfore are or should be at the least dearely beloued, inseparately allied in the greatest band of loue and familiarity, vnited partakers not onely of same crosse, but coadiutors, comforters, helpers, at all times vpon all occasion; As they did in the Primatiue Church, Acts the 5. sold their patrimonies, and laid them at the Apostles feet, and many such memorable examples of mutuall loue, we haue had vnder the ten generall persecutions, many since. Examples on the other side of discord none like, as our Sauiour saith, he came therefore into the world to set father against sonne,
                           Lactanius.
                         &c. In imitation of whom the diuell belike (nam superstitio irrepsit verae religionis imitatrix, superstition is still religions ape, as in all other things, so in this) doth so combine and glew together his superstitious followers in loue and affection, that they will liue and die together: and what an innate hatred hath he still inspired to any other superstition opposite? How those old Romans were affected, those ten persecutions may be a witnesse, and that cruell executioner in Eusebius, aut lita aut morere, sacrifice or die. No greater hate, more continuate, bitter faction, warres, persecution in all ages, then for matters of religion, no such ferall opposition, father against sonne, mother against daughter, husband and wife, Citty against Citty, Kingdome against Kingdome: as of old at Tentira and Combos.

So that Papists cannot bragge of their vowes, pouertie, obedience, orders, merits, martyrdomes, fastings, almes, good workes, pilgrimages, much and more then all this, I shall shew you, is & hath bin done by these superstitious Gentiles, Pagans, Idolaters: their blind zeale and superstition in all kinds is much at one, and is it hard to say which is the greatest, which is the grossest. In a word, this is common to all superstition, there is nothing so absurd, so ridiculous, impossible, incredilble which they will not belieue, and willingly performe as much as in them lies. I know that in true Religion it selfe many misteries are so apprehended

alone by faith, as that Trinity, Resurrection of the body at the last day, &c. many miracles not to be controuerted, or disputed of. But he that shall but read the As true as Homers Iliads, Ouids Metamorphosis, Aesops Fables.

Iewes, Gentiles, & Mahometans are extra caulem, out of the fold, and need no such attendance, they make no resistance, but Christians haue that shield of faith, sword of the spirit to resist, and must haue a great deale of battery before they can be ouercome. That the Diuell is most busie amongst vs, that are of the true Church, appeares by those seuerall oppositions, heresies, schismes, which in all ages hee hath raised to subuert it, and in that of Rome especially, wherein Antichrist himselfe now fits, and playes his

This mystery of iniquity beganne to worke euen in the Apostles time, many Antichrists and Hereticks were abroad, many sprung vp since, many now present, and will be to the worlds end, to dementate mens mindes, to seduce and captiuate their soules. Their symptomes I knowe not how better to expresse then in that twofold diuision of

such as lead, and such as are lead. Such as lead are Hereticks, schismaticks, false prophets, impostors, and their ministers: they haue some common symptomes, some peculiar. Common, as madnesse, folly, pride, insolency, arrogancy, singularity, peeuishnesse, obstinacy, impudence, scorne and contempt; of all other sects; nullius addicti iurare in verba magistri, they will approue of naught, but what they first inuent themselues, no interpretation good but what their spirit dictates, none shall be in secundis, no not in tertijs, they are only wise, only learned, in the truth, all damn'd but they, caedem scripturarum faciunt ad materiam suam, saith Tertullian, they make a slaughter of Scriptures, and turne it as a nose of wax to their owne ends. So irrefragable in the meane time, that what they haue once said, they must and will maintain, in whole Tomes duplications, triplications, neuer yeeld to death, so selfe conceited, say what you can, As

Peculiar symptomes are prodigious paradoxes, new doctrines, vaine phantasmes, which are as many and as diuerse as they themselues.

They are certainely far gone with melancholy, if not quite mad, and haue more need of physick then many a man that keeps his bed, more need of Hellebor, then those that are in Bedlam.

What else can superstition, heresie produce, but warres, tumults, vproares, torture of soules, & despaire, a desolate land, as Ieremy treateth, cap. 7.34. when they commit Idolatry and walke after their own waies: how should it be otherwise with them? What can they expect but blasting, famine, dearth, and all the plagues of Aegypt, as Amos denounceth, cap. 4. ver. 9.10. to be led into captiuity? If our hopes be frustrate, we sowe much and bring in little, eate and haue not enough, drinke and are not filled, cloath and be not warme, &c. Haggei, 1.6 we looke for much and it comes to litle. And why? his house was wast, they came to their owne houses, ver. 9. therefore the heauen staid his dewe, the earth his fruit. because we are superstitious, irreligious, wee doe not serue God as we ought, all these plagues and miseries come vpon vs, what can we looke for else, but mutuall warres, slaughters, fearefull ends in this life, and in the life to come eternall damnation. What is it that hath caused so many ferall battles to be fought, so much Christian blood shed, but superstition?

But it hath euer beene the custome of al heretickes, Idolaters, when they are plagued for their sinnes, and Gods iust iudgement come vpon them, not to acknowledge any fault in themselues, but still impute it vnto others. In Cyprians time it was much controuerted betwixt him and Demetrius an Idolater. Who should bee the cause of those present calamities.

But Cyprian retorts all vpon him againe, as appeares by his tract against him. 'Tis true the world is miserably tormented and shaken, with warres, dearth, famine, fire, inundations, plagues, and many ferall diseases rage amongst vs, sednon vt tu quereris ista accidunt quod dij vestri à nobis non colantur, sed quod à vobis non colatur Deus, à quibus nec quaeritur, nec timetur, not as thou complainest that wee doe not worship your Gods, but because you are Idolaters and doe not serue the true God, nether seeke him nor feare him as you ought.

Hee was serued in siluer Plate and had goodly houshold stuffe: a little after another religious man reprehended him in like sort, and from thence hee was serued in earthen vessels. Last of all a decree came forth because Turkes might not drinke wine themselues, that nether Iewe nor Christian then liuing in Constantinople might drinke any wine at all. In like sort amongst Papists, fasting at first was generally proposed as a good thing, after from such meats at such times, and then last of all so rigorously proposed to binde the conscience vpon paine of damnation, First friday, saith Erasmus, and then saturday, & nunc periclitatur dies Mercurij, & wendesday now is in danger of a fast.

                         As in fasting, so in all other superstitious edicts, we crucify one another without a cause, barring our selues of many good and lawfull things, honest disports, pleasures and recreations, and whilst wee make a cōscience of euery toy, we tyrannise ouer our brothers souls, loose the right vse of many good things,

                     TO purge the world of Idolatry and superstition, will require some monster taming Hercules, or a diuine Aesculapius, or Christ himselfe to come in his owne person. They are all generally so refractory, selfe-conceited, obstinate, so firmely addicted to that Religion, in which they haue beene bred and brought vp, that no perswasion, no terror, no persecution can diuert them. The consideration of which hath induced many Common-wealths, to fuffer them to inioy their consciences as they will themselues, A toleration of Iewes is in most Prouinces of Europe, In Asia they haue their Synagogues, Spaniards permit Moores to liue amongst them, the Mogullians Gentiles, the Turkes all Religions. In Europe, Poland, and Amsterdam, are the common Sanctuaries. Some are of opinion, that no man ought to be compelled for conscience sake, but let him be of what Religion he wil, he may be saued, Iew, Turke, Anabaptist, &c. If he be an honest man, liue soberly and ciuilly in his profession, and serue his owne god, with that feare and reuerence as he ought. Plinius Secund. as appeares by his Epistle to Traian, would not haue the Christians so persecuted, and in some time of the raigne of Maximinus, as we find it regestred in Eusebius lib. 9. cap. 9. there was a decree made to this purpose, 
                           Sed habeant pro arbitrio suo quo ritu velit, deum coli.
                         
                        Nullus cogatur inuitus ad hunc vel i llum deorū cultum &c. The like edict came forth in the raignes of Arcadius and Honorius.

Some againe will approue of this for Iewes, Gentiles, Infidels, that are ought of the fold, they can be content to giue them all respect and fauour, but by no meanes to such as are within the precincts of our owne Church, and called Christians, to no Heretickes, Shismatickes, or the like. Let the Spanish Inquisition that fourth furie speake for some of them, the ciuill warres and Massakers in France, our Marian times.

                           Magallianus the Iesuite will not admit of conference with an hereticke, but seueritie and rigor to be vsed, and Theodosius is commended in Nicephorus lib. 12. ca. 15.

Bernard epist. 190. will haue club law, fire and sword for Heretickes compell them, stoppe their mouthes not with disputations, or refute them with reasons, but with fists, & this is their ordinary practise. Another company are as milde on the other side, 
                           Igne & fusie potius agendum cum hereticis quam cum disputationibus os alia logiscus &c
                         to auoide all heartburning; and contentious warres and vprores, they would haue a generall toleration in euery kingdome, no mulct at all, no man for Religion or Conscience to be put to death. Martin Bellius and his companions maintained this opinion not long since in France, whose error is confuted by Beza in a iust Volume. The medium is best, and that which Paul prescribes Gal. 6.1. If any man fall by occasion, to restore such a one with the spirit of meekenesse, by all faire meanes, gentle admonitions, but if that will not take place, Post vnam & alteram admonitionē haereticū de vita, he must be excommunicate as Paul did by Hyminaeus, deliuer him ouer to Satan. Immedicabile vulniu ense recidendum est. As Hippocrates said in Physicke, I may well say in Diuinity, Qua ferro non curantur ignis curat. For the vulgar, restraine them by lawes, mulcts, burne their bookes, forbid their conuenticles, for when the

cause is taken away, 'the effect will soone cease. Now for Prophets, dreamers & such rude silly fellowes that through fasting too much, meditation, precisenesse, or by Melancholy it selfe are distempered, the best meanes to induce them Ad sanam mentem, is to alter their course of life, and with conference, threats, promises, perswasions to intermixe Physicke. Hercules de Saxoniâ had such a Prophet committed to his charge in Venice, that thought he was Elias, and would fast as he did, he dressed a fellow in Angels attire, that said hee came from heauen that brought him diuine food, and by that meanes he staied his fast, and administred his Physicke, and by the mediation of this forged Angel he was cured.

                     IN that other extreame, or defect of this loue of God knowledge, faith, feare, hope &c. are all manner of Atheists, Epicures, Infidells, that are secure in a reprobate sence and feare not God at all, and such as are too distrustfull and timorous, as desperate persons are.

                         That grand sinne of Atheisme as Melancthon calles it, monstrosam melancholiam,
                        
monstrous melancholie, or venenatam melancholiam, poysoned melancholy. A company of Cyclopes or Giants, that warre with the gods, as the Poet fained, that scoffe at all Religion, at God himselfe, denie him and all his attributes, his wisedome, power, prouidence, his mercy and iudgement.

                     That there is either heauen or hell, or any such peace or happinesse, things to come, credat Iudaeus Apella, for their parts they esteeme them as so many Poets tales. They feare neither God nor Diuell. But with that Cyclops in Euripides..
                     
                     
                        Haud vlla numina expauescunt caelitum,

                        Ventri offerunt, deos ignorant caeteros.
                     
                     
                        They feare no God but one,
                        They sacrifice to none;
                        But Belly, and him adore,
                        For gods They know no more.
                     
                     
                        Their God is their belly, as Paul saith, Sancta mater saturitas, and all their endeauours are to satisfie their lust and appetite, how to please their Genius, and to be merry for the present, Ede, bibe, lude, post mortem nulla voluptas; 
                           Wisd. 2.2. 
                        Our life is short and tedious, and in the death of a man there is no recouery, neither was any man known that hath returned from the graue, for we are borne at all aduenture, and we shall be hereafter as though we had neuer beene, for the breath is as smoake in our nostrils, &c. and the spirit vanisheth as the soft aire.

For the rest of heauen and hell, let children and superstitious fooles beleeue it, for their parts, they are so farre from trembling at the dreadfull

day of Iudgement, that they wish with Nero, Me viuo, fiat, let it come in their times, so secure, so desperate, so immoderate in lust and pleasure, so prone to reuenge, that as Paterculus said of some Catiffes in his time in Rome, Quod nequiter ausi, fortitèr executi, it shall not be so wickedly attempted, as desperately performed, what ere they take in hand: were it not for Gods restraining grace, feare and shame, disgrace and temporall punishment, and their owne infamy, they would Lycaon like exenterate, or as so many Caniballs eate vp, or Cadmus souldiers consume one another. These are commonly professed Atheists, that neuer vse the name of God but to sweare by it, that expresse nought else but Epicurisme in their carriage, that loue, feare, obey,

                        when he brought him a booke, and told him all the mysteries of saluation, heauen and hell were contained in it, he looked vpon it, and said, he saw no such matter, and asked withall how he knew it: they will but scoffe at it. Let them take heauen, paradise and that future happinesse that will, bonum est esse hic, It is good being heere: there is no talking to such men, no hope of their conuersion, they are in a reprobate sence, meere carnalists, worldly minded men, that howsoeuer they may be applauded in this world by some few parasites, and held for worldly wise men,

In spirituall things God must demonstrate all to sence, or leaue a pawne with them, or else seeke some other creditor. They will acknowledge Nature, but not God, but as

                     God is all in all, God is euery where, in euery place. And yet this Seneca that could confute and blame them, is all out as much to be blamed & confuted himselfe, as mad himselfe, for he holds fatum Stoicum, that ineuitable necessitie in the other extreame, as those Chaldean Astrologers of old did, against whom the Prophet Ieremie so often thunders, and those heathen Mathematicions, Nigidius Figulus, Magicians, and Priscilianists, whom Saint Austin so eagerly confutes, those Arabian questionaries, nouem Iudices, Albumasar, Dorotheus, &c. and our Countrimen Estuidus, that take vpon them to define out of those great coniunctions of starres, the periods of kingdomes, of religions, of all future accidents, wars, plagues, schismes, heresies, and what not, all from starres, and such things saith Maginus, Quae sibi & intelligentijs suis reseruauit deus,

But who can examine all those kinds of Hypocrites, or diue into their hearts? If wee may guesse at the tree by the fruit, neuer so many as in these dayes, shew me a plaine dealing true honest man? & pudor & probitas & timor omnis abest. He that shall but looke into their liues, and see such enormous vices, men so immoderate in lust, vnspeakeable in malice, furious in their rage, flattering and dissembling, (all for their owne ends) will surely thinke they are not truely religious, but of an obdurate heart, most part in a reprobate sence, as in this age. But let them carry it as they will for the present, dissemble as they can, a time will come when they shall be called to

account, their melancholy is at hand, and Hell it selfe is ready to receiue them.

                     THere be many kinds of desperation, whereof some bee holy, some vnholy, as

Recessus à re desiderata propter impossibilitatem existimatam, a restraint from the thing desired, for some impossibility supposed. Because they cannot obtaine what they would, they become desperate, and many times either yeeld to the passion by death it selfe, or else attempt impossibilities, not to be performed by men. In some cases this desperate humour is not much to be discommended, as in warres it is a cause many times of extraordinary valour; it makes them improue their worth beyond it selfe, and of a forlorne impotent company become conquerers in a moment. Vna salus victis nullam sperare salutem. In such cases when they see no remedy, but that they must either kill or be killed, they take courage and oftentimes, praeter spem, beyond all hope vindicate themselues William the Conqueror when he first landed in England, sent backe his shippes, that his souldiers might haue no hope of retyring backe.

I told him he was Melancholy, but he laughed me to scorne, and replied, that he saw Diuels, talked with them in good earnest, and would spitte in my face, and aske me if I did not smell brimstone, and at last he was by him cured. Such another story I find in Plater, obserat. lib. 1. a poore fellow had done some soule offence, and for fourteene dayes would eate no meat, in the end became Desperat, the Diuines about him could not ease him,

                        Bernard well aduiseth, We should not meddle with the one without the other, nor speake of iudgement without mercy, the one alone brings Desperation, the other securitie. But these men are wholy for iudgement, of a rigid disposition themselues, that can speake of nothing but hell, fire and damnation, as they did, Luke 11.46. lade men with burdens grieuous to be borne, which they themselues touch not with a finger. 'Tis familiar with our Papists to terrifie mens soules with Purgatorie tales, visions, apparitions, to daunt euen the most generous spirits, to require Charitie, as Brentius odserues, of others, bounty meekenesse, loue, patience, when they themselues breath nought but lust, enuie couetousnes. They teach others to fast, giue almes, doe pennance, & crucifie their mind with superstitious

obseruations, bread and water, haire clothes, whippes and the like, when they themselues haue all the dainties the world can afford, lie on Downe beds, with a curtisan in their armes. hen quantum patimur pro Christo as

Our indiscreet pastors many of them come not farre behinde, whilest in their ordinary sermons they still aggrauate sinne, thunder out Gods Iudgments without respect, raile at & pronounce them damn'd, for giuing so much to sports and recreations, making every small fault and a thing indifferent an irremissible offence they so wound mens consciences, that they are allmost at their wits ends.

                     The last and the greatest cause of this malady, is our own conscience, a guilty conscience for some fowle offence formerly committed. A good conscience is a continuall feast, but a gauled cōscience is a great torment as can possibly happē, another hell.

And that Diuel that then told thee that it was a light sinne or no sinne at all, now aggrauates on the other side, and telleth thee that it is a most irremissible offence, as hee did Cain and Iudas, to bring them to despaire. Tragicall examples in this kind are too familiar & common, Adrian, Galba, Nero, Otho, Vitellius, Caracalla, were in such horror of conscience for their offences committed, murders, rapes, extorsions, iniuries, that they were weary of their liues, and could get no body to kill them. It is strange to read what

Guicciardine, a man most vnapt to beleeue lies, relates how that Ferdinande his fathers ghost, who before had died for griefe, came and told him that hee could not resist the French King, he thought euery man cried France, France, the reason of it, saith Comineus, was because he was a vile tyrant, a murderer, an oppressor of his subiects,

he bought vp all commodities, and solde them at his owne price, sold Abbies to Iewes, and Falconers, both Ferdinande his father, and he himselfe neuer made conscience of any committed sinne, and to conclude, saith he, it was vnpossible to do worse then they did. Why was Pausaenias that Spartan Tyrant, Nero, Otho, Galba, so persecuted with spirits in euery house they came, but for their murders which they had committed?

They are generally weary of their liues, a trembling heart they haue, a sorrowfull mind, and haue no rest. Deut. 28.65.66. In the morning they wish for euening, and for morning in the euening, for the sight of their eyes which they see and feare of hearts. And so for the most part it is with them all, they thinke they heare and see visions conferre with Diuels, that they are tormented, and in hel fire already damned quite, and not be reuoked. Some thing talks within thē, they spit fire & brimstone, they cannot but blaspheame, they cannot repent, or thinke a good thought, so far carried, vt cogantur ad impia cogitandum etiam contra voluntatem, saith

Sometimes the Diuell, as they say, stands without and talkes with them, sometimes he is within them, as they thinke, & there speaks and talkes as to such that are possessed; As Apollidorus in Plutarch, thought his heart spake within him. There is a most memorable example of

               The Conclusion of the Author to the Reader.
            THe last Section shall be mine, to cut the strings of Democritus visor, to vnmaske and shew him as he is.

               Democritus began as a Prologue in this Trage-comedie, but why doth the Author end, and act the Epilogue in his owne name? I intended at first to haue concealed my selfe, but secundae cogitationes &c. for some reasons I haue altered mine intent, and am willing to subscribe.

                I haue done mine indeuor. Besides, I dwel not in these humane studies, or Physicke, they are no part of my profession, non hic sulcos ducimus, non hoc puluere de sudamus, I am but a stranger, a smatterer in them, here and there I pull a flower. And I doe easily grant, if a rigid censurer should criticize on this which I haue writ, he should not find three faults as Scaliger in Terence, but 300. euen as many as hee hath done in Cardans subtilties, or Borocius on Sacro-Boscus. If ought be amisse, I require a friendly admonition, no bitter inuectiue, otherwise as in ordinary controuersies, funem contentionis nectamus. sed cui bono? we may contend, and likely misuse one another, but to what purpose? we are both schollers, say,

            As for the end and vse of this precedent Discourse, 
                  Prefat. Democ.
                I referre you to that which hath beene formerly said. In the

meane time, if any man shall say, Medice cura teipsum, or as Wisdom. 17.8. it was obiected to those wisards, They that promised to driue away feare and trouble from the sicke person, were sicke for feare, and worthy to be laughed at. I replie with

               Sulpitius; Medici qui in alienis morbis profitentur se tenere medicinae scientiam ipsi se curare non possunt, they that cure others, cannot well prescribe Physicke to themselues.
            It now remaines, that I make a thankefull remembrance of such friends, to whom I haue beene beholden for their approbation, or troubled in perusing seuerall parts, or all of this Treatise. For I did impart it to some of our worthiest Physitians, whose approbations I had for matters of Physicke, and to some Diuines, and others of better note in our Vniuersity, as wel as to my more priuate Collegiate friends: whose censures when I had passed, and that with good encouragement to proceed, I was the bolder to hasten it. permissu superiorum, to the Presse. I will name no man, or prefixe as the custome is any Encomiasticke verses, which I thanke my friends haue beene offered, least if either whole or part should be misliked, I should preiudice their iudgment, I ackowledge my selfe much beholding and bound to them: If ought be amisse, I take it wholy to my selfe, and say againe. 
                  
                     Me me adsum qui feci, in me conuertite linguas
                     O Momi, meus hic error, nihil iste probauit,
                     Nec voluit.—
                  
                But I am ouertroublesome, I will conclude, if first I may request a fauourable censure of such faults as are omitted in the Presse. The Copie (as I haue said) was once written and in hast, I could not alwaye be there my selfe; or had I beene still present, Non omnem molitor quae fluit vnda videt. The Miller sees not all the water goes by his Mill. Besides many letters mistaken, misplaced, added, omitted as i for y, or a for e, or o, false points, &c. which are in some copies onely, not throughout: (To point at each particular of which were to picke out the seedes of a foule bushell of corne) some of the chiefest, as thou shalt find them corrected, I desire thee

to take notice of. My translations are sometimes rather Paraphrases, and that onely taken which was to my purpose; quotations are often inserted in the Text, which make the Style more ha

               sh, or in the Margine as it hapned. Greeke Authors, Plato, Plutarch, Athenaeus, &c. I haue cited out of their interpretors, because the Originall was not so ready &c. I haue indeede mingled Sacra prophanis, but I hope not prophaned; and in repetition of Authors names, not according to Chronologie, rancked them per accidens; sometimes Neoterickes, before Ancients, as my memory suggested.
            These are the things which I thought good to mention in this Epilogue, the consideration of which I leaue to thy favorable censure, and withall submissiunesse, as I ought, my selfe and these my labours to a friendly Reader.
