            THE HISTORIE OF
Sir Clyomon Knight of the
golden Sheeld, ſon to the King of Denmark:
And Clamydes the white Knight, ſonne to

               As to the wearie wādring wights, whom waltring waues 
                     〈◊〉
                  ,
               No greater ioy of ioyes may be, then when from out the Ocean
               They may behold the Altitude of Billowes to abate,
               For to obſerue the Longitude of Seas in former rate.
               And hauing then the latitude of Sea-roome for to paſſe,
               Their ioy is greater through the griefe, then erſt before it was.
               So likewiſe I Clamydes, Prince of Swania Noble ſoyle,
               Bringing my Barke to Denmarke here, to bide the bitter broyle:
               And beating blowes of Billowes high, while raging ſtormes did laſt,
               My griefes was greater then might be, but tempeſts ouerpaſt,
               Such gentle calmes enſued hath, as makes my ioyes more
               Through terror of the former feare, then erſt it was before.
               So that I ſit in ſafetie, as Sea-man vnder ſhrowdes,
               When he perceiues the ſtormes be paſt, through vanquiſhing of Clowdes.
               For why, the doubtfull care that draue me off, in daunger to preuaile,
               Is daſht through bearing leſſer braine, and keeping vnder ſaile:
               So that I haue through trauell long, at laſt poſſeſt the place
               Whereas my Barke in harbour ſafe, doth pleaſures great embrace:
               And hath ſuch licenſe limited, as heart can ſeeme to aske,
               To go and come, of cuſtome free, or any other taske.
               
               I meane by Iuliana ſhe, that blaze of bewties breeding,
               And for her noble gifts of grace, all other dames exceeding:
               Shee hath from bondage ſet me free, and freed, yet ſtill bound
               To her, aboue all other Dames that liues vpon the ground:
               For had not ſhe bene mercifull, my ſhip had ruſht on Rocks,
               And ſo decayed amids the ſtormes, through force of clubbiſh knocks:
               But when ſhe ſaw the daunger great, where ſubiect I did ſtand,
               In bringing of my ſilly Barke, full fraught from out my land,
               She like a meeke and modeſt Dame, what ſhould I elſe ſay more?
               Did me permit with full conſent, to land vpon her ſhore:
               Vpon true promiſe that I would, here faithfull ſtill remaine,
               And that performe which ſhe had vowed, for thoſe that ſhould obtaine
               Her princely perſon to poſſeſſe, which thing to know I ſtay,
               And then aduenturouſly for her, to paſſe vpon my way.
               Loe where ſhe comes, ah peereles Dame, my Iuliana deare.
               Enter Iuliana with a white Sheeld.
            
            
               Iuliana.
               My Clamydes, of troth Sir Prince, to make you ſtay thus here,
               I profer too much iniurie, thats doubtleſſe on my part,
               But let it no occaſion giue, to breede within your hart
               Miſtruſt that I ſhould forge or faine, with you my Loue in ought.
            
            
               Clamy.
               No Lady, touching you, in me doth lodge no ſuch a thought,
               But thankes for your great curteſie that would ſo friendly heere
               In mids of miſerie receiue, a forraine ſtraunger meere:
               But Lady ſay, what is your will, that it I may perſtand?
            
            
               Iulia.
               Sir Prince, vpon a vow, who ſpowſeth me, muſt needſly take in hand
               The flying Serpent for to ſley, which in the Forreſt is,
               That of ſtrange maruels beareth name, which Serpent doth not mis
               By dayly vſe from euery coaſt, that is adyacent there,
               To fetch a Virgin maide or wife, or elſe ſome Lady faire,
               To feed his hungrie panch withall, if caſe he can them take,
               His nature loe it onely is, of women ſpoyle to make:
               Which thing no doubt, did daunt me much, and made me vow indeed,
               Who ſhould eſpouſe me for his wife, ſhould bring to me his head:
               Whereto my father willingly, did giue his like conſent,
               Lo Sir Clamydes, now you know what is my whole intent:
               And if you will as I haue ſaid, for me this trauell take,
               That I am yours, with heart and mind, your full account do make.
            
            
               
               Cla.
               Ah Lady, if caſe theſe trauels ſhould ſurmount, the trauels whereby came
               Vnto the worthies of the world, ſuch noble brute and fame,
               Yea though the dangers ſhould ſurpaſſe ſtout Hercules his toyle,
               Who fearing nought the dogged feend, ſterne Serbarus did foyle.
               Take here my hand, if life and limbe the liuing Gods do lend,
               To purchaſe thee, the deareſt drop of bloud my heart ſhall ſpend.
               And therefore Lady lincke with me, thy loyall heart for aye,
               For I am thine til fates vntwine, of vital life the ſtay:
               Proteſting here if Gods aſſiſt, the Serpent for to kil.
            
            
               Iuli.
               Then ſhalt thou of all women win, the hea

                  t and great good wil,
               And me poſſeſſe for ſpowſed wife, who in election am
               To haue the Crowne of Denmarke here, as heire vnto the ſame.
               For why, no children hath my fire beſides mee, but one other,
               And he indeed is heire before, for that he is my brother.
               And Clyomon ſo hight his name, but where he doth remaine,
               Vnto my Parents is vnknowne, for once he did obtaine
               Their good wills for to go abroad, a while to ſpend his daies,
               In purchaſing through actiue deeds, both honour, laud and praiſe,
               Whereby he might deſerue to haue the order of a Knight,
               But this omitting vnto thee, Clamydes here I plight
               My faith and troth, if what is ſaid by me thou doſt performe.
            
            
               Clamy.
               If not, be ſure O Lady with my life, I neuer will returne.
            
            
               Iuli.
               Then as thou ſeemeſt in thine attire, a Virgins Knight to be,
               Take thou this Sheeld likewiſe of white, and beare thy name by me,
               The white Knight of the Siluer Sheeld, to eleuate thy praiſe.
            
            
               Clamy.
               O Lady as your pleaſure is, I ſhall at all aſſayes
               Endeuour my good will to win, if Mars do ſend me might,
               Such honour as your grace with ioy, ſhall welcome home your Knight.
            
            
               Iuli.
               Then farewell my deare Clamydes, the gods direct thy way,
               And graunt that with the Serpents head, behold thy face I may.
               Exit.
            
            
               Clamy.
               You ſhall not need to doubt thereof, O faithfull Dame ſo true,
               And humbly kiſſing here thy hand, I bid thy Grace adue.

               The flying Serpent ſoone ſhall feele, how boldly I dare vaunt me,
               And if that Hydras head ſhe had, yet dread ſhould neuer daunt me.
               If murdering Minataure, a man might count this ougly beaſt,
               Yet for to win a Lady ſuch, I do account it leaſt
               Of trauels toyle to take in hand, and therefore farewell care,

               His royall grace to ſee, homeward to retire,
               Now is my purpoſe altered by brute of late report.

               Clamy.
               Ah happy day my deadly foe ſubmitted hath to death,
               Lo heere the hand, lo heere the ſword that ſtopt the vitall breath:
               Lo heere the head that ſhall poſſeſſe my Iulianas deare,
               The Knight of the golden Sheeld his force, what neede I now to feare:
               Since I by force ſubdued haue this Serpent fierce of might,
               Who vanquiſht hath as I haue heard, full many a worthie Knight.
               Which for to winne my Ladyes loue, their liues haue venterd heere,
               Beſides that cowardly Bryan which the faithleſſe ſhield doth beare:
               A number keepes as I haue heard, as captiues in his hold,
               Whome he hath by inchantment got, and not through courage bold.
               Shall ſuch defamed daſtards, dard by Knights, thus beare their name?
               Shall ſuch as are without all faith, liue to impaire our fame?
               Shall valiant harts by cowardly charme, be kept in captiues thrall?
               Shall Knights liue ſubiect to a wretch which hath no hart at all?
               Nay firſt Clamydes claime to thee fell Atrapos his ſtroke,
               Ere thou doeſt ſee ſuch worthy Knights to beare the heauie yoke,
               Of cowardly Bryan without faith, his charmes let daunt not thee,
               And for his force thou needſt not feare, the Gods thy ſhield will be.
               Well, to meete the Knight of the golden Shield, yet ten daies ſpace I haue,
               And to ſet free theſe worthy Knights, but reſt a while I craue.
               Heere in this place neere to this fort, for that I weary am
               With trauell, ſince from killing of the Serpent late I came:
               Heere let him ſit downe and reſt himſelfe.
               Lo heere a while I mind to reſt, and Bryan then ſubdue,
               And then to Alexanders court, to keepe my promiſe true.
            
            
               Enter Bryan ſance foy, and Shift.
            
               Bryan.
               Come Knowledge, for here he lyes layd weary on the ground:
            
            
               Shift.
               Nay, ile not come in his ſight, if you would giue me a thouſand pound.
               For he is the terribleſt Knight of any you haue heard ſpoke,
               Heele beate a hundreth ſuch as you and I am downe at one ſtroke.
            
            
               Bryan.
               Tuſh, feare thou naught at al, I haue charmed him, and he is faſt aſleepe,
               Lying neere vnto the Caſtle here which I do keepe.
               And ten dayes in this ſleepe I haue charm'd him to remaine,
               
               Before nature ſhall ouercome it, that he might wake againe.
               In the meane ſeaſon, lo behold the Serpents head ile take away,
               His ſhield and his apparell, this done, then will I conuay
               His body into priſon, with other his companions to lye,
               Whoſe ſtrengths, ah knowledge, I durſt neuer attempt to try.
            
            
               Shift.
               Ah handle him ſoftly, or elſe you wil cauſe him to awake:
            
            
               Bryan.
               Tuſh, tuſh, not if all the noyſe in the world I were able to make,
               Till ten dayes be expired, the charme will not leaue him,
               And then I am ſure he will maruell who did thus deceiue him:
               So now he is ſtripped, ſtay thou here for a ſeaſon,
               And ile go fetch two of my ſeruants to cary him into priſon.
               Exit.
            
            
               Shift.
               Well do ſo maiſter Bryan, and for your comming ile ſtay,
               Gogs bloud what a villaine am I my maiſter to betray.
               Nay ſure ile awake him if it be poſſible ere they carry him to iayle:
               Maiſter, what maiſter, awake man, what maiſter, ah it will not preuaile.
               Am not I worthie to be hangd, was euer ſeene ſuch a deceitfull knaue?
               What villany was in me, when vnto Bryan vnderſtanding I gaue
               Of my maiſters being in this forreſt, but much I muſe indeed
               What he meanes to do with my maiſters apparell, his ſhield and the head?
               Well, ſeeing it is through my villany, my maiſter is at this drift,
               Yet when he is in priſon, Shift ſhall not be voide of a ſhift
               To get him away, but if it euer come to his eare
               That I was the occaſion of it, heele hang me thats cleare.
               Well heere comes Bryan, ile cloke with him if I may,
               To haue the keeping of my maiſter in priſon night and day.
            
            
               Enter Bryan ſance foy, two ſeruants.
            
            
               Bryan.
               Come ſirs take vp this body, and cary it into the appointed place,
               And there let it lye, for as yet he ſhall ſleepe ten dayes ſpace.
            
            
               Shift.
               How ſay you maiſter Bryan, ſhall I of him haue the gard?
            
            
               Bryan.
               By my troth policie, thy good will to reward
               In hope of thy iuſt ſeruice, content I agree
               Cary him out.
               For to reſigne the keeping of this ſame Knight vnto thee.
               But giue me thy hand that thou wilt deceiue me neuer:
            
            
               Shift.
               Heres my hand, charme, inchant, make a ſpider catcher of me, if I
be falſe to you euer.
            
            
               
               Bryan.
               Well then come follow after me, and the gard of him thou ſha

               Exit.
            
            
               Shift.
               A thouſand thanks I giue you, this is all the promotion I craue:
               Ah ſirrah, little knowes Bryan, that Clamydes my maiſter is,
               But to ſet him free from priſon I entend not to mis:
               Yet ſtill in my mind, I can do no other but muſe,
               What practiſe with my maiſters apparell and ſhell he will vſe:
               Well, ſeeing I haue played the craftie knaue with the one, ile play it with
the other:
               Subtill Shift for aduantage, will deceiue his owne brother.
               Exit.
            
            Here let them make a noyſe as though they were Marriners.
And after Clyomon Knight of G. S.

               So you ſay.

               Well, will it pleaſe you forth to trace,
               That when we haue of fragrant fields, the dulcet fumes obtained,
               We may vnto the Sea ſide go, whereas is to be gained,
               More ſtraunger ſights among Neptunes waues, in ſeeing Ships to ſaile,
               Which paſſe here by my fathers ſhore, with merrie weſterne gaile.

               We ſhall your highneſſe leade the way to fields erſt ſpoke before.

               What greater griefe can grow to gripe, the heart of greeued wight,
               Then thus to ſee fell Fortune ſhe, to hold his ſtate in ſpight.
               Ah cruell chance, ah luckleſſe lot, to me poore wretch aſſign'd,
               Was euer ſeene ſuch contraries, by fraudulent Goddeſſe blind.
               To any one ſaue onely I, imparted for to be,
               To animate the mind of any man, did euer Fortune ſhe
               Showe forth her ſelfe ſo cruell bent, as thus to keepe me backe,
               From pointed place by weather driuen, my ſorrowes more to ſacke,
               Ah fatall hap, herein alas, what furder ſhall I ſay?
               Since I am forced for to breake, mine oath and pointed day.
               Before King Alexanders grace, Clamydes will be there:
               And I through Fortunes cruell ſpight, oppreſt with ſickneſſe here:
               For now within two dayes it is that we ſhould meete togither,
               Woe worth the wind and raging ſtormes, alas that brought me hither.
               Now will Clamides me accuſe, a faithleſſe knight to be,
               And eke report, that cowardlineſſe did dant the heart of me.
               The worthy praiſe that I haue wonne, through fame ſhall be defaced,
               The name of the Knight of the Golden Sheeld, alas ſhall be defaced:
               Before that noble Prince of might, whereas Clamydes he
               
               Will ſhowe himſelfe in Combat wiſe, for to exclaime on me,
               For breaking of my poynted day, and Clyomon to thy greefe,
               Now art thou in a countrey ſtrange, cleane voyd of all releefe:
               Oppreſt with ſickneſſe through the rage of ſtormie blaſts and cold,
               Ah death come with thy direfull Mace, for longer to vnfold
               My ſorrowes here it booteth not yet Clyomon do ſtay,
               The Ladies loe, comes towards thee, that walkt the other way.
            
            Enter Neronis, two Lords, two Ladies.
            
               Nero.
               Come faire dames, ſith that we haue in fragrant fields obtained,
               Of dulcet flowers the pleaſant ſmell, and that theſe knights diſdained
               Not to beare vs company, our walke more large to make,
               Here by the ſea of ſurging waues, our home returne weele make.
               My Lords therefore do keepe your way.
            
            
               1. Lo.
               As it pleaſe your grace, we ſhall obey,
               But behold Madame, what wofull wight, here in our way before,
               As ſeemeth very ſicke to me, doth lie vpon the ſhore.
            
            
               Nero.
               My Lords, lets know the cauſe of greefe, whereof he is oppreſſed:
               That if he be a knight, it may by ſome meanes be redreſſed.
               Faire ſir well met, why lie you here▪ what is your cauſe of griefe?
            
            
               Clyo.
               O Lady, ſickneſſe by the Sea, hath me oppreſt in briefe.
            
            
               Nero.
               Of truth my Lords, his countenance bewrayes him for to bee,
               In health, of valiant heart and mind, and eke of hye degree.
            
            
               2. Lo.
               It doth no leſſe then ſo import, O Princes as you ſay.
            
            
               Nero.
               Of whence are you? or whats your name? you wander forth this
way.
            
            
               Clyo.
               Of ſmall valure O Lady faire, alas my name it is,
               And for not telling of the ſame, hath brought me vnto this.
            
            
               Nero.
               Why, for what cauſe ſir Knight, ſhuld you not expreſſe your name?
            
            
               Clyo.
               Becauſe O Lady I haue vowed, contrary to the ſame.
               But where I trauell Lady faire, in Citie, Towne or field,
               I am called, and do beare by name, the knight of the Golden Shield.
            
            
               Ne.
               Are you that knight of the Goldē ſheeld, of whom ſuch fame doth go?
            
            
               Clyo.
               I am that ſelfe ſame knight faire dame, as here my Sheeld doth ſho.
            
            
               Nero.
               Ah worthy then of helpe indeed, my Lords aſſiſt I pray,
               And to my lodging in the court, ſee that you him conuey,
               
               For certainly within my minde, his ſtate is much deplored,
               But do diſpaire in nought ſir knight, for you ſhall be reſtored,
               If Phiſicke may your greefe redreſſe, for I Neronis loe,
               Daughter to Patranius king, for that which fame doth ſhoe,
               Vpon your acts, will be your friend, as after you ſhall proue.
            
            
               1. Lo.
               In doing ſo, you ſhall haue need of mightie loue aboue.
            
            
               Clyo.
               O Princes, if I euer be to health reſtord againe,

               But you muſe I am ſure wherefore theſe weapons I bring,

               Becauſe I played the ſhifting knaue, to ſaue my ſelfe from harme,
               And by my procurement, my maiſter was brought in this charme.
               The ten dayes are exſpir'd, and this morning he ſhall awake,
               And now like a craftie knaue, to the priſon my way will I take,
               With theſe ſame weapons, as though I would fight to ſet him free,
               Which will giue occaſion that he ſhall miſtruſt, there was no deceit in mee.
               And hauing the charge of him, here vnder Bryan ſance foy,
               
               Ile open the priſon doores, and make as though I did imploy
               To do it by force, through good will, and onely for his ſake,
               Then ſhall Clamydes being at liberty, the weapons of me take,
               And ſet vpon Bryan and all his men▪ now that they are a ſleepe,
               And ſo be reuenged, for that he did him keepe
               By charme in this order, ſo ſhall they both deceiued be,
               And yet vpon neither part miſtruſt towards me.
               Well, neere to the priſon ile draw, to ſee if he be awake,

               Mine is the heart which vades away, as doth the flower or graſſe.
               In wanting ſap to moyſt the roote, is ioyes that made me glad,
               And plants being troden vnder foote, is pleaſures that was had.

               Why ſo I do, how can I tell, Neronis force no crueltie
               Thou feeſt thy knight endued is, with all good gifts of courteſie:
               And doth Neronis loue indeed, to whom loue doth ſhe yeeld,
               Euen to that noble brute of fame, the knight of the golden Sheeld.
               Ah wofull Dame, thou knoweſt not thou, of what degree he is,
               Of noble bloud his geſters ſhowe, I am aſſured of this.
               Why belike he is ſome runnagate that will not ſhow his name,
               Ah why ſhould I this allegate, he is of noble fame.
               Why doſt thou not expreſſe thy loue, to him Neronis then?
               Becauſe ſhamefaſtneſſe and womanhood, bids vs not ſeeke to men.
               Ah carefull Dame loe thus I ſtand, as twere one in a trance,
               And lacketh boldneſſe for to ſpeake, which ſhould my words aduance.
               The knight of the Golden Sheeld it is, to whom a thrall I am,
               Whom I to health reſtored haue, ſince that to court he cam.
               And now he is preſt to paſſe againe, vpon his wearie way,
               Vnto the Court of Alexander, yet hath he broke his day,
               As he to me the whole expreſt, ah ſight that doth me greeue,
               Loe where he comes to paſſe away, of me to take his leaue.
            
            
            
               Enter Clyomon.
            
               Clyo.
               Who hath more cauſe to praiſe the Gods, then I whoſe ſtate deplored?
               Through phiſicke and Neronis helpe, to health am now reſtored:
               Whoſe feruent thrall I am become, yet vrgent cauſes dooth
               Conſtraine me for to keepe it cloſe, and not to put in proofe
               What I might do to winne her loue, as firſt my oath and vow,
               In keeping of my name vnknowne, which ſhe will not allow,
               If I ſhould ſeeme to breake my minde, being a Princes borne,
               To yeeld her loue to one vnknowne, I know ſheele thinke it ſcorne?
               Beſides here longer in this Court, alas I may not ſtay,
               Although that with Clamydes he, I haue not kept my day:
               Leaſt this he ſhould ſuppoſe in me, for cowardlineſſe of hart,
               To ſeeke him out elſewhere, I will from out this Land depart.
               Yet though vnto Neronis ſhe, I may not ſhew my mind,
               A faithfull heart when I am gone, with her I leaue behind.
               Whoſe bountiouſneſſe I here haue felt, but ſince I may not ſtay,
               I will to take my leaue of her, before I paſſe away.
               Loe where ſhe walkes, O Princeſſe well met, why are you here ſo ſad?
            
            
               Ne.
               Good cauſe I haue, ſince pleaſures paſſe, the which ſhuld make me glad.
            
            
               Clyo.
               What you ſhould meane, O Princeſſe deare, hereby I do not know.
            
            
               Nero.
               Then liſten to my talke a while, Sir Knight and I will ſhow.
               If caſe you will reaunſwere me, my queſtion to obſolue,
               The which propound within my mind, doth oftentimes renolue.
            
            
               Clyo.
               
                  I will O Princes anſwere you as aptly as I may.
            
            
               Nero.
               Well then Sir Knight, apply your cares, and liſten what I ſay:
               A ſhip that ſtormes had toſſed long, amidſt the mounting waues,
               Where harbour none was to be had, fell Fortune ſo depraues:
               Through ill ſucceſſe that ſhip of hope, that Ancors hold doth faile,
               Yet at the laſt ſhees driuen to land, with broken Maſt and ſaile:
               And through the force of furious wind, and Billowes bounſing blowes,
               She is a ſimple ſhipwracke made, in euery point God knowes.
               Now this ſame ſhip by chance being found, the finders take ſuch paine,
               That fit to ſaile vpon the Seas, they rig her vp againe.
               And where ſhe was through ſtorms ſore ſhakt, they make her whole & ſoūd
               Now anſwere me directly here, vpon this my propound.
               
               If this ſame ſhip thus rent and torne, being brought in former rate,
               Should not ſupply the finders true to profit his eſtate
               In what ſhe might.
            
            
               Clyo.
               Herein a right,
               
                  I will O Princeſſe as I may, directly anſwere you.
               This ſhip thus found, I put the caſe it hath an owner now,
               Which owner ſhall ſufficiently content the finders charge:
               And haue againe to ſerue his vſe, his ſhip, his boate or barge.
               The ſhip then cannot ſerue the turne of finders, this is plaine,
               If caſe the owner do content, or pay him for his paine:
               But otherwiſe if none lay claime, nor ſeeme that ſhip to ſtay,
               Then is it requiſit it ſhould, the finders paines repay:
               For ſuch endeuour as it is to ſerue for his behoofe.
            
            
               Nero.
               What owner truly that it hath, I haue no certaine proofe.
            
            
               Clyo.
               Then can I not define thereof, but thus I wiſh it were,
               That you would me accept to be, that ſhip O Lady faire:
               And you the finder, then it ſhould be needleſſe for to mooue,
               If I the ſhip, of dutie ought to ſerue at your behooue.
            
            
               Nero.
               Thou art the ſhip O worthy Knight, ſo ſhiuered found by mee.
            
            
               Clyo.
               And owner haue I none deare dame, I yeeld me whole to thee:
               For as this ſhip I muſt confeſſe, that was a ſhipwrack made,
               Thou haſt reſtored me vnto health, whom ſickneſſe cauſd to vade,
               For which I yeeld O Princeſſe deare, at pleaſure thine to be,
               If your grace, O noble Dame, will ſo accept of me.
            
            
               Nero.
               If caſe I will, what haue you ſhowne?
            
            
               Clyo.
               Becauſe I am to you vnknowne.
            
            
               Nero.
               Your fame importeth what you be.
            
            
               Clyo.
               You may your pleaſure ſay of me.
            
            
               Nero.
               What I haue ſaid due proofe do ſhowe.
            
            
               Clyo.
               Well Lady deate, to thee I owe
               More ſeruice then of dutie I am able to profeſſe,
               For that thou didſt preſerue my life amidſt my deepe diſtreſſe:
               But at this time I may not ſtay, O Lady here with thee,
               Thou knoweſt the cauſe, but this I vow within three ſcore dayes to bee,
               If deſtinie reſtraine me not, at Court with thee againe,
               Proteſting whileſt that life doth laſt, thine faithfull to remaine.
            
            
               
               Nero.
               And is there then no remedie, but needs you will depart?
            
            
               Clyo.
               No Princeſſe for a certaintie, but here I leaue my hart,
               In gage with thee till my returne, which as I ſaid ſhall be:
            
            
               Nero.
               Well, ſith no perſwaſion may preuaile, this Iewell take of me,
               And keepe it alwayes formy ſake.

               Of it a deare account ile make, yet let vs part deare Dame with ioy,
               And to do the ſame I will my ſelfe imploy.

               As for to haue the loue of her whom thou didſt ſooner judge.
               Would haue denied thy loyaltie, and gainſt thy good will grudge,

               The mind who with affection is, to one onely thing affected,
               The which may not till dint of death, from them be ſure reiected:
               You know my Lords through fame, what force of loue hath taken place,
               Within my breaſt as touching now Neronis noble grace,
               Daughter to Patranius King, who doth the Scepter ſway:
               And in the Ile of Marſhes eke, beare rule now at this day.

                   he anſwered me with nay:
               But ſhall I not prouide by force to fetch her thence away?
               
               Yes, yes, my Lords, and therefore let your aydes be preſt with mine,
               For I will ſure Neronis haue, or elſe my dayes ile pine.
               For King Patranius and his power, I hold of ſmall account,
               To winne his daughter to my ſpouſe, amids his men ile mount.
            
            
               1 Lord.
               Moſt worthy Prince, this raſh attempt, I hold not for the beſt,
               For ſure Patranius power is great, and not to be ſuppreſt.
               For why, the ile enuirond is, with ſea on euery ſide,
               And landing place lo is there none, whereas you may haue tide
               To ſet your men from ſhip to ſhore, but by one onely way,
               And in that place a gariſon great, he keepeth at this day.
               So that if you ſhould bring your power, your trauell werein vaine,
               That is not certainly the way, Neronis for to gaine.
               But this your grace may do indeed, and ſo I count it beſt,
               To be in all points with a Ship, moſt like a Merchant preſt:

               And certainly as you haue ſayd, my Lord it is the way,
               Wherefore ô King, do proſecute the ſame without delay.

Clamyde, had deliuered.
            
               Clyomon.
               Sir Knight, of truth this fortune was moſt luckely aſſignd,
               That we ſhould meete in trauell thus, for thereby to my mind
               You haue a caſtle of comfort brought, in that you haue me told,

               No certis ſir he kept not day, the cauſe I haue expreſſed,
               Through that inchanter Bryans charmes, he came full ſore diſtreſſed:
               Yet fortune fauored ſo his ſtate, that through his help all wee

               And at our parting willed vs, if any with you met,
               
               We ſhould informe you with the truth what was his onely let.

               Well, know you where he abideth now, ſir Knight I craue

               Is skaled from their neſtling place, and pleaſures paſſage find.
               For that as well as Clyomon, Clamydes broke his day,

               A due, ſince ſalue of ſolace ſweete, hath ſorrowes all ſuppreſt.
               For that Clamydes cannot brag, nor me accuſe in ought,
               Vnto the gods of deſtenies, that thus our fates hath brought
               In equall ballance to be wayed, due praiſes ſhall I ſend,
               That thus to way each cauſe aright, their eyes to earth did bend.
               Well, to keepe my day with Lady now, I mind not to be ſlack,
               Wherefore vnto Patranius court, ile dreſſe my iourney back.

               Which of ſtrange Marſhes beareth name, vnto the nobleſt ſtate.

                  Muſtantius brother to the King, from her the Crowne would take,
               But till ſhe be deliuered, the Lords did order make,

            Enter Shift very braue.
            
               Shift.
               Ieſu what a gazing do you make at me, to ſee me in a gowne?
               Do you not know after trauell, men being in Court or in Towne,
               And ſpecially ſuch as is of any reputation, they muſt vſe this guiſe,
               Which ſignifieth a foole to be ſage, graue, and of counſell wiſe.
               But where are we thinke you now, that Shift is ſo braue?
               Not running to ſeeke the knight of the golden ſheeld, an other office I haue:
               For comming here to the court, of ſtrange Marſhes ſo named,
               Where King Alexander in his owne perſon lies, that Prince mightily famed
               Betweene Mustantius brother to the late king deceaſed
               And the Queene, through King Alexander, a ſtrife was appeaſed:
               But how or which way I thinke you do not know,
               Well then giue eare to my tale, and the truth I wil ſhow:
               The old King being dead, through ſorrow for Neronis,
               
               Whom we do heare, Louer to the Knight of the Golden Sheeld is.
               The Queene being with child, the ſcepter asked to ſway,
               But Muſtantius the Kings brother, he did it denay.
               Whereof great contention grew, amongſt the Nobles on either ſide,
               But being by them agreed the iudgement to abide
               Of King Alexander the great, who then was comming hither,
               At his arriuall to the Court, they all were cald togither.
               The matter being heard, this ſentence was giuen,
               
               That either partie ſhould haue a Champion to combat them betweene:
               That which Champion were ouercome, the other ſhould ſway,
               And to be ſoughten after that time, the ſixteene day.
               Now my maiſter Clamydes comming hither, for Muſtantius wil he bee,
               But vpon the Queenes ſide, to venter none can we ſee:
               And yet ſhe maketh proclamation through euery land:
               To giue great gift; to any that will take the combat in hand.
               Well within ten daies is the time, and king Alexander hee
               Staieth till the day appointed, the triall to ſee:
               And if none came at the day for the Queene to fight,
               Then without trauel to my maiſter, Muſtantius hath his right.
               But to ſee all things in a readines, againſt thappointed day:
               Like a ſhifting knaue for aduantage, to Court Ile take my way.
               Exit.

               Through newes I heare, as I abroad in weary trauell went,
               How that the Queene her mother hath her proclamations ſent
               Through euery land, to get a Knight to combat on her ſide,
               Againſt Mustantius, Duke and Lord, to haue a matter tride:
               And now the day is very nigh, as I do vnderſtand,
               In hope to meete my Lady there I will into that land:
               And for her mother vndertake the combat for to trye,
               Yea though the other Hector were, I would him not denye
               What ſoeuer he be, but ere I go, a golden Sheeld ile haue,
               Although vnknowne, I will come in, as doth my Knighthood craue:
               But couered will I keepe my Sheeld, becauſe ile not be knowne,
               If caſe my Lady be in place, till I haue proweſſe ſhowne.
               Well, to haue my Sheeld in readineſſe, I will no time delay,
               And then to combat for the Queene, I ſtraight will take my way.

               Of all the gripes of griſlie griefes, Neronis hath her fill.

               My wretched corps with thouſand woes, more then I may ſupport,
               So that I am to be compard vnto the ſcaled fort,

               They forced are through battering blowes, the ſame for to releaſe.
               So likewiſe I ſo long as hope, my comfort did remaine,
               The griefly greefes that me aſſaild, I did repulſe againe:
               But now that hope begins to faile, and greefes anew do riſe,

               To keepe the ſame, the Forte I meane, it is the wearie corſe,

               So likewiſe I as Buzzard bold, while chearefull day is ſeene,
               Am forſt with Owle to hide my ſelfe, amongſt the Iuie greene:

               Till Vesper I behold aloft, in skies begin to ſpread:
               And then as Owle that flies abroad when other fowles do reſt,
               I creepe out of my drowſie denne, when summous hath ſuppreſt
               The head of euerie valiant heart, loe thus I ſhrowd the day,
               And trauell as the Owle by night vpon my wiſhed way:
               The which hath made more tedious my iourney, by halfe part,
               But blame not Bryan, blame alas, his cowardly catiffes hart:
               Which dares not ſhowe it ſelfe by day, for feare of worthy wights,
               For none can trauell openly, to eſcape the venturous Knights,
               Vnleſſe he haue a noble mind, and eke a valiant hart,
               The which I will not brag vpon, I aſſure you for my part:
               For if the courage were in me, the which in other is,
               I doubtles had inioyed the wight whom I do loue ere this.
               Well, I haue not long to trauell now, to Denmarke I draw nie,
               Bearing knight Clamydes name, yet Bryan ſance foy am I.

               Yet can I not vſurpe his heart, ſtill Bryans heart I beare:
               Well, I force not that, he is ſafe inough, and Bryan as I am,

               That the combat muſt paſſe for Muſtantius and the Queene?
               But to fight vpon her ſide as yet no Champion is ſeene.
               And Duke Muſtantius he ſmiles in his ſleeue, becauſe he doth ſee
               That neither for loue nor rewards, any one her Champion will be.
               Ant were not but that my maiſter the other Champion is,
               To fight for the Queene my ſelfe, I ſurely would not mis.
               Alas good Lady, ſhe and her child is like to loſe all the land,
               Becauſe none will come in, in her defence for to ſtand.

               To rule till ſhe was deliuered, and haue the Princes roome:
               Now ſhall Duke Muſtantius be ſure the Scepter to ſway,
               If that none do come in to fight in her cauſe this day.
               And King Alexander all this while hath he ſtayed the triall to ſee,

               This knight a ſtraunger comes to court, and at that preſent day,
               In cowardly wiſe he comes by ſtealth, and takes from me away
               The honour that I ſhould haue had, for which my father he,
               Did of his bleſſing giue in charge, O noble king to me,

               If that before thy Grace O King, my force in fight could frame,
               To vanquiſh him, now hauing met thus happily togither,
               Though they are greed, our combat reſt, decreed ere we came hither.

               O father, the ſending of that worthy knight my woful hart doth rue,

               As I haue heard ſubdued hath full many a worthy knight.
               And this laſt night O father paſt, my mind was troubled ſore,
               Me thought in dreame I ſaw a Knight not knowne to me before,
               
               Which did preſent to me the head of that ſame monſter ſlaine,

               My ſimple skill will not ſuffice the truth thereof to ſpecifie.
               But ſore I feare to contraries, the exſpect thereof will hap,

               Expreſſe ſhe neuer gaue ſo much, but more ſhe tooke away.
               And that which I haue loſt by her, and her accurſed ire,
               From trauell will I neuer ceaſe, vntill I may aſpire
               Vnto the view thereof oh King, wherein is all my ioy.

               I like well your determined mind, but how ſay you ſir knight?
            
            
               Bryan.
               Nay by his ounds ile gage my gowne he dares not fight:
               By gogs bloud I ſhall be ſlaine now, if the Combat I denie,
               And not for the eares of my head with him I dare trie.
            
            
               King.
               Sir knight why do you not reanſwere make in triall of your name?
            
            
               Bry.
               I will O King, if caſe he dare in combat trie the ſame.
            
            
               King.
               Well then go to prepare yourſelues, each one his weapons take:
            
            
               Iulia.
               Good father let it not be ſo, reſtraine them for my ſake.
               I may not here behold my Knight in daunger for to be,
               With ſuch a one who doth vſurpe his name to purchaſe me:
               I ſpeake not this for that I feare his force or ſtrength in fight,
               But that I will not haue him deale with ſuch a deſperate wight.
            
            
               King.
               Nay ſure, there is no better way then that which is decreed,
               And therefore for to end their ſtrife the combat ſhall proceed:
               Sir knights prepare your ſelues, the truth thereof to trie.
            
            
               Clamy.
               
                  I readie am, no cowarly heart ſhall cauſe me to denie.
            
            
               Bry.
               Nay ile neuer ſtand the triall of it, my heart to fight doth faint:
               Therefore ile take me to my legs, ſeeing my honour I muſt attaint.
            
            
               King.
               Why whither runs Clamydes? Sir knight ſeeme to ſtay him:
            
            
               Clyo.
               Nay it is Clamydes O King that doth fray him.
            
            
               Clamy.
               Nay come ſir come, for the combat we will trie:
            
            
               Bry.
               Ah no my heart is done, to be Clamydes I denie.
            
            
               King.
               Why how now Clamydes, how chance you do the combat here thus
ſhunne?
            
            
               Bry.
               Oh King grant pardon vnto me, the thing I haue begunne
               
                  I muſt denie, for I am not Clamides, this is plaine:
               
               Though greatly to my ſhame, I muſt my words reuoke againe:
               I am no other then the knight, whome they Sance Foy call,
               This is Clamydes, the feare of whom, my danted mind doth pall.
            
            
               Iulian.
               Is this Clamydes? ah worthy Knight, then do forgiue thy deefe,
               And welcome eke ten thouſand times vnto thy Lady heere.
            
            
               Clamy.
               Ah my Iuliana bright, whats paſt I do forgiue,
               For well I ſee thou conſtant art, and whilſt that I do liue,
               For this, my firmed faith in thee for euer ile repoſe.
            
            
               Iulian.
               O father now I do deny that wretch, and do amongſt my foes
               Recount him for this treaſon wrought.
            
            
               King.
               Well Knowledge, take him vnto thee, and for the ſmall regard
               The which he had to valiant Knights, this ſhalbe his reward,
               S

                  th he by charmes, his crueltie in cowardly manner wrought,
               On Knights, who as Clamydes did, the crowne of honour fought,
               And trayterouſly did them betray, in priſon for to keepe,
               The fruits of ſuch like crueltie, himſelfe by vs ſhall reape:
               By due deſert therefore I charge to priſon him conuay,
               There for to lye perpetually vnto his dying day.
            
            
               Bryan.
               Oh King be mercifull, and ſhew ſome fauour in this caſe:
            
            
               King.
               Nay, neuer thinke that at my hands thou ſhalt finde any grace.
            
            
               Clamydes,
               ah moſt welcome thou, our daughter to enioy,
               The heauens be praiſd that this hath wrought, to foile all future noy.
            
            
               Clamydes.
               
                  I thanke your Grace, that you thus ſo well eſteeme of me.
               Enter Knowledge.
               What is all things finiſhed, and euery man eaſed?
               Is the pageant packed vp, and all parties pleaſed?
               Hath each Lord his Lady, and each Lady her loue?
            
            
               Clyomon.
               Why Knowledge, what meanſt thou thoſe motions to moue?
            
            
               Knowledge.
               You were beſt ſtay a while, and then you ſhall know,
               For the Queene her ſelfe comes, the motion to ſhow.
               You ſent me if you remember, to ſeeke out your page,
               But I cannot find him, I went whiſling & calling through the court in ſuch a rage:
               At the laſt very ſcacely in at a chamber I did pry,
               Where the Queene with other Ladyes very buſy I did ſpy:
               Decking vp a ſtrange Lady very gallant and gay,
               To bring her here in preſence, as in court I heard ſay.
            
            
               Clyomon.
               A ſtrange Lady Knowledge of whence is ſhe canſt thou tell me?
            
            
               Knowledge.
               Not I ant ſhall pleaſe you, but anon you ſhall ſee.
               
               For lo where the Lady with your mother doth come:
            
            
               Clyomon.
               Then ſtraightway my duty to her grace ſhalbe done.
               The mighty Gods preſerue your ſtate, O Queene, and mother deare,
               Hoping your bleſſing I haue had, though abſent many a yeare.
               Enter Queene.
               My Clyomon, thy ſight my ſon doth make thy aged mother glad,
               Whoſe abſence long and many a yeare, hath made thy penſiue parents ſad.
               And more to let thee know my ſonne, that I do loue and tender thee,
               I haue here for thy welcome home, a preſent which ile giue to thee.
               This Lady though ſhe be vnknowne, refuſe her not, for ſure her ſtate
               Deſerues a Princes ſonne to wed, and therefore take her for thy more.
            
            
               Clyomon.
               O noble Queene and mother deere, I thanke you for your great good will,
               But I am otherwiſe beſtowd, and ſure I muſt my oath fulfill.
               And ſo I mind if gods to fore on ſuch decree I meane to pauſe,
               For ſure I muſt of force deny, my noble father knowes the cauſe.
            
            
               King.
               Indeed my Queene this much he told, he lou'd a Lady ſince he went,
               Who hath his hart and euer ſhall, and none but her to loue he'is bent.
            
            
               Clyomon.
               So did I ſay, and ſo I wil, no beawties blaze, no gliſtering wight,
               Can cauſe me to forget her loue, to whom my faith I firſt did plight.
            
            
               Nerones.
               Why are you ſo ſtraight lac't ſir Knight, to caſt a Lady off ſo coy?
               Turne once againe and looke on me, perhaps my ſight may bring you ioy.
            
            
               Clyo.
               Bring ioy to me? alas which way? no Ladies looks cā make me glad:
            
            
               Nero.
               Then were my recōpence but ſmall, to quit my paine for you I had.
               Wherefore ſir knight do wey my words, ſet not ſo light the loue I ſhow,
               But when you haue bethought your ſelfe, you wil recant and turne I know.
            
            
               Queene.
               My Clyomon refuſe her not, ſhe is and muſt thy Lady be:
            
            
               Clyo.
               If otherwiſe my mind be bent, I truſt your grace will pardon me.
            
            
               Nero.
               Wel then I ſee tis time to ſpeake, ſir knight let me one queſtiō craue,
               
                  Say on your mind. Where is that Lady now become, to whom your plighted
faith you gaue?
            
            
               Clyo.
               Nay if I could abſolue that doubt, then were my mind at eaſe:
            
            
               Nero.
               Were you not brought to health by her, whē you came ſick once of y• ſeas?
            
            
               Cly.
               Yea ſure I muſt cōfeſſe a truth, ſhe did reſtore my health to me,
               For which good deed I reſt her owne, in hope one day her face to ſee.
            
            
               Nero.
               But did you not promiſe her to returne, to ſee her at a certaine day,
               And ere you came that to performe, the Norway King ſtole her away?
               And ſo your Lady there you loſt:
            
            
               Clyomon.
               All this I graunt, but to his coſt.
               For ſtealing her againſt her will, this hand of mine bereft his life.
            
            
               
               Ne.

               I ſent him hither ere I came, becauſe the King and Queene ſhould know,
