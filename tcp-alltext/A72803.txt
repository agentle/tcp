               Nor one Groat at command:
               Which way then ſhall I ſtand

               Still to ſcore with mine Hoſt,
               for a pipe of Tobacco.
            
            
               Vpon a proper Nagge
               daintely paced;
               To London firſt I came,
               all with Gold laced:
               Then with my Puncke each day,
               Road I to ſee a Play;
               There went my Gold away,
               taking Tobacco.
            
            
               Twenty good Sheepe I brought,
               left by my Mother:
               Cawes and Lambs, Cowes & Calues,
               one with the other:
               With which I payd a ſhot,
               For a Pipe and a Pot:
               All theſe were brauely got,
               and ſpent in Tobacco.
            
            
               No companion was I then
               for clowniſh Carters:
               I wore imbrodred Hoſe,
               with golden Garters:
               My Siluer-hatched Sword,
               Made me ſweare like a Lord,
               Come Rogue, (at euery word)

               The Second part of the merry Progreſſe to London.
               To the ſame tune.
               
                  
               
               
                  THen tracing the gallant Streets
                  of London Citty,
                  A Damſell mee kindly greets,
                  courtious and witty:
                  Shee like a ſinging Larke,
                  Ledd mee into the darke,
                  Where I ſoone payd a Marke
                  for a Pipe of Tobacco.
               
               
                  To Smithfield then gallantly
                  tooke I my iorny,
                  Where I left ſoone behind
                  part of my Mony:
                  There I found out a Puncke,
                  With whom I was ſo drunke,
                  That my Purſe bottome ſhrunke
                  away with Tobacco.
               
               
                  
                     Pickthatch and Clarken-well,
                  
                  made me ſo merry,
                  Vntill my Purſe at laſt;
                  began to grow weary:
                  Yellow-ſtarcht bonny Kate,
                  
                  with her fine nimble pate,
                  Cooſond mee of my plate,
                  with a pipe of Tobacco.
               
               
                  Then for Good-fellowſhip,
                  to Garden-ally,
                  
                  I hied mee to ſearch for
                  Daughters of folly:
                  There I found roaring Boyes,
                  with their faire Female ioyes:
                  And the Diuell making toyes
                  to take Tobacco.
               
               
                  After, to Shores-ditch then,
                  ſtood I beholding:
                  Where I found ſinners ſtore,
                  of the Diuels moulding:
                  I ſpeake for no ſlaunder,
                  The Puncke and her Pander,
                  Like a Gooſe and her Gander,
                  tooke whiffes of Tobacco.
               
               
                  To Saint Katharus paſt I

                  not without trouble:
                  Where my Purſe laſhed out,
                  drinking Beere double:
                  A Teſter for each Toaſt
                  payd I there to my Hoſt▪
                  
                  And the Sauce to my coſt,
                  was a Crowne for to Tobacco.
               
               
                  To Ratcliffe and Wapping then.
                  went I for Shipping;
                  Where as a Laſſe louingly
                  gaue mee a whipping:
                  There was a bonny Wench,
                  Stroke a Naile would not clench,
                  That taught me fiuely French,
                  taking Tobacco.
               
               
                  Then ſtraight to Weſtminſter
                  
                  made I aduenter,
                  To finde Good fellowes (who)
                  will'd mee to enter,
                  Where I felt ſuch a ſmoake,
                  As might the Diuell choake,
                  There went away my Cloake,
                  with the ſmoake of Tobacco.
               
               
                  Bacward to Barbican
                  
                  quickly I haſted:
                  There met I honeſt Iohn,
