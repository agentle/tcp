            The Author to the wellaffected Reader, wisheth Grace, mercie, and peace from God the father, and from the Lord Iesus Christ.
            
            
               COurteous Reader, before thou enter vpon this Discourse, either to read or to censure, I haue to admonish thee of two things. First, for the manner of writing, thou maist easily see it, to bee fitted for the Pulpit. And indeed, so it was, that hauing diuerse yeeres since deliuered some few out of this text, to mine Auditory: I did lately (vpon warning giuen) take it once againe in hand, and alter, change, correct, and enlarge it, till I brought it to this quantitie in which it is▪ so preparing it for a more noble Audience. Then finding it be ouerlong to be rehearsed at once, I was constrained againe to Epitomize it. Here therefore hast thou (and that is the second thing whereof I aduertise thee) at large the whole body of that Discourse, whose

Epitome was rehearsed in publique. So that if any thing, seemed to them that heard mee eyther obscure, or too slightly passed ouer in the deliuery, here may they helpe themselues to vnderstand my meaning. For the matter I shall not neede to tell thee, that it is needfull in respect of the times, wherein the words of our Sauiour are seene fulfilled, For because iniquitie doth abound, the loue of many waxeth cold. And how many are there daily, who either fall backe to Popery, and Aegyptianpalpable superstition, or else turne open rebels by Atheisme? And well may we thinke that when the Sonne of man commeth, he will scarce finde faith vpon earth. Who is there, therefore, except that vnprofitable seruant that hid his Talent in a Napkin, but will be willing to set to his helping hand, if not to stay all, yet to preserue some from Apostasie? Hence commeth it, that now lately there haue beene more Sermons and Tractates publisht concerning this sinne of Apostasie, within these few yeeres, than were in many ages heretofore. So that now it might seeme as superfluous for an after-commer, to deale in this subiect, as to take in hand new Arguments for Popery: All which haue bin so often vrged by Schoole-men, alledged by Catholikes, re-assumed by Popish Priests, painted ouer by Iesuits, that a man might sooner hope for holesome meate to be made of Cole-worts, twise or thrise sodden, than to find a new, and not here-to fore answered Argument. So here: Yet since the gifts of men are diuers (albeit they proceed from the same spirit) what hindreth

but that still men may bee doing, and doe well, since the end of their Action, is the glory of God?
            Concerning this present Tractate, what it hath, not to be found in the former, thou thy selfe (good Reader) vpon tryall wilt easily perceiue. In reading of which, if thou be such a one who knowest me not, It is well, goe on and try the spirits: If such who doest know mee, yet doe me the curtesie, to withdraw thy selfe from considering my meane-nesse, and looke onely vpon the cause. Consider the waight of Reason, which I haue alledged. For if thou shouldest either like the worse of this, in respect of mee, or esteeme better of another, in respect of his person, not regarding what force of Argument we doe either of vs alledge: thou maist easily erre, as who indeed doest pinne the truth of God vpon the sleeue of man.
            To conclude then, if thou be judicious, reade, censure, and correct, I giue thee free libertie For I will not my selfe, be tyed to this that I haue deliuered, if I see better reason to evince it, than is brought to confirme it. But if thou be one, who either doest, or justly maist suspect thy iudgement, reade, but leaue censuring to others. Howsoeuer it bee, whosoeuer thou art, conceiue thus of mee, that my desire was to haue deliuered the Truth, and nothing but the Truth. So wilt thou, I hope, commend me and my labours to the blessing of God in thy prayers: And cause mee to rest
            
               Thine in the Lord: the Lords vnworthy seruant in the Ministery. T. B.
            
         
         
            
            
            To the deuoute Readers, which desire to keepe Faith and a good Conscience to the end, Grace, and Peace, and strength, against Temptations by IESVS CHRIST.
            
               
                  MARVAILE not (deere Christians and courteous Readers) that so many learned diuines and holy minded men, bestow so much paines, and spend so long time, in so sad and vnpleasant a subiect as this is; searching and desirous to define what the impardonable sinne against the holy Ghost should be: For euen as the best and most approued Phisitians doe more busie themselues in studying those maladies, which are most incurable, rather then those, for which euery emperick hath a medecine in readinesse, and cach one amongst them proueth himselfe in his skill, if hee haue sound out eyther some especiall Antidote to preuent, or some singular remedy (if not perfectly to cure, yet) to ease and aswage the tormenting paines of such desperat disseases as aflict men most, as well with the feare of imminent death, as with the sence of present dolours: Euen so, for as much as all heede is to be giuen, and all diligence carefully vsed, that no man (if it be possible) dash vpon this Rocke, nor fall into so deuouring a deepe; many students in diuinitie, enflamed with zeale, care, and loue vnto mens saluation, refuse no paines, nor think any labour grieuous, by night or day, if they may be so happie,

as to giue warning betimes, and so preuent any mans relapse, or falling away: And for as much as many true hearted Christians, vpon a tendernesse of Conscience, through Satans illusions, are often troubled with a feare of hauing offended in this kinde: And others againe, in a continuall securitie, forsaking their first loue, reuolt and fall off, by little and little, from the practise of sincere Piety, taking the high way to Epicurisme, and denyall of their profession, and so come neere and into great daunger of finall relapse at lest, if not of an hatred also, and despight of that holy truth which they once professed: therefore good men willing to comfort the one, with solid euidence of Gods word, and to reclaime and saue the other from the perill of so irrecouerable a fall, doe labour in this sad subiect, that by an exact deciphering of that mortall sinne, both might finde fit instruction, whilest the one may see how farre they are from it, and the other perceiue how daungerously they hasten towards it.
            Now as men are diuersly affected, some with feare, and some with presumption (as I haue shewed) so likewise we may finde very great, (yea too much) variety of opinion amongst writers concerning this sinne, some supposing it to be so rarely and seldome admitted, as scarce three examples or foure can be produced since the beginning of the World, others make it so frequent and vsuall, as almost all that finally fall from their Faith and holy profession, are supposed, by them, to sinne in this kinde.
            Againe, some are of opinion, that only God can discerne, who they be, that sinke and are drowned in this gulfe; as if he had not reuealed any certainty concerning this matter, and thereupon shunne and reiect all meditation vpon this point, and Argument, as vaine and vncertaine. I am not worthy neyther will I take vpon me to censure great and learned men, but let it be seriously considered, how much and how often mention is made in Gods word, of this fearefull fall and direfull plight, that men are brought into thereby, and we may easily guesse that the Lord would not haue vs vtterly ignorant of it: And let vs weigh and obserue the fruit, and great benefit

which Gods people, by a sober and wise meditation hereof may reape, and it may be iudged, that their labour is commendable, who warily and with iudgement, write and preach to that purpose For, as Mariners cannot easily shunne the gulfe nor rock, except they know (or at lest can guesse) whereabouts the daunger is; No more is it likely that a Christian professor should liue absolutely without the perill or feare of this, so fearefull a sinne, in some probable sort, vnlesse he be warned thereof by such as doe study the point of purpose.
            It is more then manifest, that the danger of such a relapse is very great, and that our vigilancy and care of auoiding it ought to be no lesse, and lastly considering the drowsie securitie of this age, the present decay of zeale, the vtter neglect of the meanes to quicken it, that no argument is of more necessary and profitable vse to be preached or published, then this at this time, wherein many hanging, as it were, in suspence and expectation, are ready, whatsoeuer shall ensue, with Demas to embrace the present world, and so politickly, in the meane while, doe carry themselues, that which way soeuer they shall hereafter thinke good to incline, yet they shall not be deemed Apostataes: But let them for all that (as it were vpon this publique warning) examine themselues, whether their hearts and Consciences bee not plainely and euidently euinced of the truth of the Gospell, against Atheisme, Papisme, Turcisme, Iudaisme, or whatsoeuer Gentilisme, or other sect, and if so, then consider, whether the reuolt from the knowne truth, will not prooue as haynous a fault in Gods sight, for all their couert carriage, as heauy a clogge to their Consciences, as deepe a downefall from Grace, and as wilfull a losse of the tast of the power of the world to come, as if they had professed it in the forwardest manner, or rather let them feare lest, whilst they (in worldly wisedome) vsing cautelous circumspection to prouide for a change, doe not palpably bewray, that they receiue not the loue of the truth, together with the knowledge thereof, and so declare plainly, that they are of the number of those, vpon whom God, in his iust iudgement, will send strong delusion to beleeue lies. The Scribes and Pharisees

neuer vndertooke the profession of Christ, as of the promised Messias; yet because they were euidently conuinced by his word and workes, that he it was, that was to come, Christ spareth not to call their wilfull reluctation and opposition against him, blasphemie against the Spirit; And I could wish, that such wary walkers in neutralitie, would vouchsafe to peruse this short treatise, which tendeth to admonish them at least, that they outstand not the time of Grace, but rather feare, least being forsaken, and lest in a Reprobate sence (when they would) they shall not bee able to embrace and apply to themselues, what they once knew and had learned and so fall to despight both God and good men. This let all men know and take notice of that no time nor age since the dayes of the Apostles, hath beene more likely to bring forth plentie of peccants in this kinde, then this we liue in. First, knowledge did neuer so abound, not onlie amongst the learned, but euen amongst the lay-vulgar, by the cleere light and plentifull preaching of the Gospell▪ Secondly, this knowledge hath begotten an vniuersall profession and forme of outward Godlines, wherby men giue consent to the Truth, preached and manifested vnto them. Thirdly, this generall consent hath bred a forwardnesse in many, shewing in probabilitie their hearts affected with that which they professe, and to haue attained a taste of the heauenly gift, as the Apostle speaketh: From such a degree and measure of knowledge and Grace, if any should fall as (if greater heede be not taken) it may be feared s
                  •
               me will, especially, if that should come to passe, which those Politicians before spoken of doe prepare for, and want of zeale in others doth deserue. How deepe should they sinke into this Dungeon, and how neere might we iudge them vnto this sinne? Cast your eyes back a little, and looke vnto the Histories of former times, and for want of other bookes concerning more ancient ages of the primitiue Church, take notice only of the defection after King Edwards daies: How many seeming forward professors, during the liberty of the Gospell (in a moment almost) not only forsooke their sinceritie, but also became violent persecutors of that themselues professed, whose desperate

ends in that their wilfull Apostasie, without any remorse at all pronouncing damnation vpon themselues, with horrible blasphemies, and he
                  •
               lish despight against God, declare manifestly, that their fall was scarefull, and their sinne vnpa
                  •
               donable. Now, although we haue none other cause (blessed bee God) giuen to vs, to feare or suspect any such defection or change, but only our owne sinnes, deseruing such a plague, yet are not their labours vaine and to no purpose, which giue warning before, that men looke to their standing, and take heede that they fall not. Sathan is subtle, and mens hearts are deceiptfull out of measure, and some without any such cause giuen, may be taken with a sudden spirituall Apoplexie, and fall headlong at once, not only into the loue and practise of sensualitie, but also into the hatred of that grace of God, which teacheth them to deny all vngodlinesse, and worldly lusts, and to liue Godly, righteously and soberly in this present world.
            And some others, though they fall not at once, like a man that flingeth himselfe downe headlong from the top of a Rocke or steeple, may be so carelesse of their estate, as by insensible back sliding, through the deceiptfulnesse of sinne, they may depart away from the liuing God, and being once gone, fall into Saul his case the sonne of Cis, who quite berest of the spirit of Grace, had an euill spirit sent to terment him.

            And to the end that all true holy-minded Christians may better keepe watch and ward against Satans sleights and subtleties, this one secret is worthy obseruing: To take great heede continually by all meanes, to nourish and increase the

peace of Conscience, and ioy in the holy Ghost. For as these are the last and principall graces men attaine vnto by the preaching of the Gospell, so are they the first, which such as fall away doe commonly loose, whereupon the blessed Apostle, with very great reason encouraging the Philippians against imminent troubles assureth them, that the peace of God which passeth all vnderstanding

               eing, wherefore in a word, this is it I would say, that our aduersary the Deuill will especially labour, and vse his whole cunning, to bereaue men eyther, of these, very Graces themselues, or of the sence of them, which is easily done by drawing them into wilfull sinnes, which defile the Conscience, and disturbe the peace therof. Vpon the losse of the reward (as labourers and souldiers doe more negligently applie themselues when they are doubtfull of their pay▪ so) men grow lesse carefull of holy duties, and doe not so much delight in them; why? But euen because, by the defiling of their Consciences, they doe not finde their wonted comfort in such exercises: So the meanes of renewing their Repentance dis-vsed, or lesse frequented, by neglect of the meanes the heart growes into hardnesse, sinne into custome, and disquietnesse of Conscience into a

The effect whereof, and iust punishment can be none other but finall despayre in the man, and horrible blasphemies against God and his Christ, with a despighting of

his spirit of Grace, and so at last euerlasting torments in hell fire. Behold then both the ladder (as I may say) whereby menascend, and the rope, whereby they fall or descend into this Dungeon; men climbe, and attaine to some taste and smack of the powers of the world to come, which I call peace of Conscience, and ioy in the holy Ghost, by these steppes. First, their mind and vnderstanding, by the preaching of the word, is enlightened with the knowledge of the Mysterie of Christ. Secondly, the will and reason consenteth. Thirdly, the heart imbraceth and applieth vnto a measure of Faith, and of Repentance. Fourthly, the affections beginne to frame into obedience. Fiftly, the life and conuersation is fashioned to the outward forme of Godlinesse. Sixtly, the Conscience is at peace and the inward man ioyeth: Now the manner of relapse, or descent, is downe the same way. Ioy and peace of Conscience are lost through some wilfull sinne. Secondly, the life and conuersation growes worse and worse. Thirdly, the affections are altered from delight in holinesse, and loosed from obedience. Fourthly, Faith fayleth, and Repentance giuen euer. Fiftly, the benefit by Christ, despised. Sixtly, a great decay of knowledg followeth, through the contempt of the meanes, and so the man is giuen vp vnto a Reprobate sense, whereby God and goodnesse and all their worshippers despighted and persecuted: As euery one therefore loueth his soule, and longeth for saluation in Christ, and delighteth in the assurance thereof; so let him beware and take heed of defiling and disquieting his cosc

two (whom he dares trust, and thinketh able, by his or their counsell and godlinesse, to helpe) into what temptation hee is fallen, that he may not beare the brunt of the assault alone: And whatsoeuer befaileth, let him not flie to carnall delights, or worldly myrth and vanitie for remedy, which brings a forgetfulnesse of this guiltinesse, and so a secure benummednesse of Conscience, to his vtter vndoeing, rather then a true cure and helpe for his dangerous disease, vse only those meanes which may recouer true peace of Conscience with God, and the battaile is sought, and the field wonne: For very often times, as by euil Chyrurgerie, acurable wound groweth to a gangren, euen so the wound of Conscience, which might haue beene to the increase of Grace, and better certaintie of saluation, by forsaking the true and right cure, becommeth desperat carnae

and recouered. Seuenthly, If any place of Scripture or position of Gods word, doth minister more consolation or comfort, or on the other side, more affright or terrifie then another, there is still place for the working vpon the Conscience, by the word, which is quite taken away in the case of the sin against the holy Ghost. Lastly, if all, or most of the speeches of the party affected, concerning God, and Christ, and his Church, be not blasphemous, or if the offender could not wish them blasphemies (it may be a fearefull and a damnable case) but it is not fully this desperat and impardonable sinne: But let no man trust in himselfe, or in his owne strength of recouering, to giue way willingly, no not vnto the least sinne, for Satan (as is said) is subtle, and we are weake and foolish, and God is not bound to attend vs, but we him.

Augustine, who albeit he excused Pope Boniface, propounding to him difficult questions, and requiring short answers, in regard both the questionist and the respondent were Bishops, and therefore troubled with waightie affaires; yet he confesseth that Nebridius did justly reprehend the preposterous doing of the other. Why? Because both of them had time enough,

the one to discusse at large, the other to heare at leasure.
               And as it is much commended by S. Augustine, So least there should be any that vppon the hearing of the Text, judging whereto the discourse will tend, would require an affected breuitie and concisenes; I doe here professe to follow the practise of Nebridius. Especially, since both time and leasure sufficient is alloted for you to heare, for me to speake. Leasure in respect of the day,

               For the matter of this Epistle it is various. But the thing that he chiefly aymeth at is Puritie in life, Charitie in affection.
               In this fift Chapter, hee setteth downe the force and efficacie of Faith, the seuerall fruits and effects which it produceth: a speciall one whereof is Assurance to bee heard in our prayers, verse 14. The which Assurance teacheth vs, that whatsoeuer wee aske, the same shall be, nay, is alreadie graunted; Wee know that we haue the petitions, that we haue desired of him, prouided alwaies that it be according to his will. Whereupon the ApostleVer. 16. builds an exhortation, that, if any one doe see his brother going astray, sinning a sin which is not vnto death, he should pray for him, and the Lord would giue li

                  e for them that sinne not vnto death. By which wordes hauing intimated a difference of sinnes, and thereby giuen just occasion of a doubt, of a question, he annexeth the solution, the answere of it in this Text, shewing plainely, that there is a sinne vnto death, for which hee will not haue prayers to be made, There is a sinne vnto death, I say not that thou shouldest pray for it.
               
               For the cleering of which words (which I must needs doe before I can come to the matter) I note, first, the Terme that is vsed, secondly, The number that is insinuated. A word or two of either.
               The Terme is not Mortall, but sinne vnto death. The Schoole men and their followers the Iesuits haue a distinction of sinne into V

                     e quod est praeter, Mortale quod est contralegem. Veniall and Mortall. Some sinnes say they are sua natura in their owne nature, veniall, others are mortall. But one that hath but halfe an eye may see the reason of this distinction: For, you must know that when Purgatorie was found out, lest

that it should haue beene lost againe, and so the Popes Kitchin haue wanted fire, fuell, and other vtensilles, it was conuenient, nay, in a manner necessary, that some sins should be accounted veniall, that so, though a man should die in them without repentance, yet there might be some hope to helpe him: But not daring to make all sinnes veniall, lest they might seeme to haue reversed the judgement of God, they left some to be mortall. Little considered they that Death is the wages of all sinne, Rom. 6. 23. 
                  Paul speaketh indefinitely; and Moses more distinctly, Deut. 27. 26. 
                  Cursed is he that confirmeth not all the words of this Law to doe them. And how can it be otherwise, since that, All sinne is a rebellion against God & transgression of the Law of God? Excellent to this purpose is the saying of an Ancient, n Wee must not vse deceitfull

               Neither is the distinction so absurd, but the application of it is farre more grosse; For while they reckon vp these mortall and deadly sinnes, hence haue they excluded the breach of the first Table, hence also the

The sinne against the holy Ghost, which is a sinne with a witnesse, a lump of sinne, Ilias malorum. a masse of mischiefe. It is the perfection of sinne, (if the word perfection may bee so ill placed.) It is the Nil vltra, the vp shot of all sinnes, So that there is none here, I suppose, who is not very sensible of the difficulties, I now sustaine, Non est res levis, no small matter, whereof I am to speake; you to heare.

This wisedome of the Mariner is worth imitation. Loc

               First, enquire what this sinne is which is against the1 Holy Ghost.
               Secondly, why it is so mortall.2
               
               Of both these with as much briefenesse and plaines as such a matter will giue leaue.
               For the first, I take it for granted that all men doe easily vnderstand that this Sinne (which nowe wee seeke) is no sinne of Infirmity; nor of Ignorance: but it must needes bee a sinne of a Presumptuous minde, a sinne with an high hand: so that onely among them will wee looke. There is a sinne against knowledge, When the seruant knoweth his masters will, and doth it not. Well may our sinne comprehend this vnder it, but all sinne against knowledge is not this sinne. There is a sinne against conscience, when notwithstanding the conscience like Gods solliciter Surdo verbert coedit. secretly checketh them yet on they goe still, this is worse then the former, but yet neither can it bee that which we seeke, vnlesse wee would enwrap Dauid in it. There is a sinne of Presumption Perk. Case cons. lib. 1. cap. 2. §. 3. proceeding from pride, and arrogancie, wilfulnesse and haughtines of heart: which both wilfully and contemptuously causeth a man to sinne against God. wilfully, as presuming vpon Gods mercy and his owne future repentance, Contemptuously, as despising and con temning the Law of God. These are great, grosse, and grieuous, especially if the particular sinne be either Idolatrie which is the forsaking of God, or witch-craft, which is a ioyning Couenant with Satan. In these, to sinne against knowledge, against the checke of conscience, presumptuously, wilfully, and contemptuously, is a sinne that may make the earth to tremble, and the heauens

to sweat with amazednes, that earth should thus transgresse against heauen, man against God. Yea it may on a suddaine set a man into a stound, and driue his thoughts to a perplexitie to consider what further degree of sinne there can bee founde or thought of, into which the Sonne of Adam may slip or plunge himselfe.
               But let vs wade a little deeper, Origen (as Bellar. lib. 2. De Poenit. cap. 16. 
                  Bellarmine alledgeth) thought that euery sinne committed against the Law of God after Baptisme, was the sinne against the Holy Ghost, not farre from this were the Novatians, But Athanasius doth well refute this opinion: first because our Sauiour doth accuse the Pharisees of this sinne, who yet neuer were Christians nor baptized, whereas the opinion of Origen doth suppose a prcedencie of baptisme in those who may fall into this Apostasie. Secondly, Because then it woulde followe that all sinnes committed by Christians shoulde bee sinnes of this nature, as beeing committed after the Sacrament of Baptisme: which to hold, what were it else, but to barre vp the gates of heauen against all Christians what soeuer, for who is there that sinneth not, and sinneth not grieuously at one time or other? Truth it is that Christians falling into sinne, doe sinne against the grace of God receiued, But wee seeke out one speciall sinne which in a principall maner and for some speciall consideration is called the Sinne against the Holy Ghost. such is not each sinne committed after Baptisme.
               
                  Augustine, standeth for finall Impoenitencie (viz.) when men die without repentance. Certainely I cannot but much commende the censure that Bellarmine passeth vpon this opinion, Haec vera est sententia, quatenus docet finalem Impoenitentiam esse aliquod peccatum in spiritum sanctum: sed non lefendi potest si velit hoc esse proprium peccatum. Lib. 2 de Poeni. cap. 16 
                  This is true (sayth hee) so farre forth as it teacheth that finall impoenitencie is some speciall sinne against the holy Ghost, but it cannot bee defended, if hee woulde haue this impoenitencie to bee that peculiar and proper sinne which wee feeke for. But I more commende his Reasons, First, Because finall Impoenitencie, is not blasphemy, but onely a certaine circumstance in euery

sinne, whereas our sinne is a blaspheming sinne as heereafter shall appeare, in which respect it is called blasphemie against the Spirit. Secondly, This finall Impoenitency is not committed till death, for which cause it is called finall, (viz.) which continueth to and in the ende (I suppose) to distinguish it from the other Impoenitencie (a species of sinne of malice) which according to their doctrine may bee forgiuen in this life; but the sinne against the Holy Ghost is committed in this life, the which hee confirmeth, first by the practise of our Sauiour who taxed the Pharises at that time living and like enough to liue longer, Secondly by the text of Paul to the Hebrues 6. Necessarily to bee vnderstoode of men liuing, vnlesse wee woulde make Paul speake thus, It is impossible that the dead should be renewed by repentance: which how vnbeseeming so great an Apostle it were, iudge yee. Lastly by this text of Iohn, the which indeede speaketh of a man seeing his brother sinning, and not of one knowing or hearing that hee hath sinned: whereupon he concludeth that our sinne is not finall Impoenitencie, which not before death, and hardly then, can bee seene and discerned.
               A third opinion holdeth the sinne against the Holy Ghost, to be any sinne of malice: This is the common opinion receiued from the Schoolemen, and by the Papistes much magnified, Let vs (if you please) fetch it from the originall.

And distinguisheth them according to the contempt of those things which should keepe men from sinning. First, then in respect of sinne it selfe, God keepes men from sinning, one while by consideration of the filthinesse; another while by consideration of the vnprofitablenesse of sinne, These two are reiected, The one by Impaenitencie which respecteth notImpoenitentia. the filthinesse, the other by Obstinacie, which will not consider the vnprofitablenesse. Secondly, in respectObstinatio. of Gods gifts he withdraweth men from sinne, sometimes by the knowledge of the Truth, and sometimes by the loue of the brother-hood, and Communi

And these two also are withstood, yea, and contemned, the one by Presumption, which repelleth all feare, the other by Desperation,
                  Praesumptio. which reiecteth all hope of Mercie. These thenDesperatio. (sayth hee) for still I am reading a Lecture of Schoole-Diuinitie) are the sixe kindes of this sinne against the holy Ghost, viz. Impaenitencie, Obstinacie, Impugnation of the Truth, Enuying, Praesumption, and Desperation.
               
               
                  Didaeus Stella (whose commendation is that hee was counted, Eximius verbi Divini concionator cum Privilegio. In Praefat. 
                  An excellent, and priviledged Preacher of Gods Word) may helpe vs also somewhat in this our disquisition. Something more contract hee is then Aquinas. Take him thus, Stella in Lucam. cap. 12. Some (sayth he) call this sinne (the sinne against the holy Ghost:) The deni ill of Christ, some Finall Iaepenitencie: some Any sinne after Baptisme:
                  
some a voluntary Obduration: some a Desperation of Gods mercie, proceeding not from ignorance or passion, but from Malice, Others call it any deadly sinne committed wilfully and maliciously: the which they devide againe into sixe particulars, Praesumption, &c.
               
               Wee will walke no further in these pathes, least wee fall into a Maze or Labyrinth, Carmine ab vno disce omnes, The rest are like these, and these farre wide, Nihil istorum satis veritatem assequitur. ibid. None of these (sayth Stella) come neere enough to the Truth, which may appeare by these Arguments.
               1. Argument. Christ manifestly (sayth Stella, for first we will fight with his weapons) distinguisheth betwixt the sinne against the sonne, & the sinne against the Spirit, saying. Luke 12. 10. 
                  He that shall speake a word against the sonne of man it shall be forgiuen him, but to him that shall blaspheme the holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiuen him. 
                  Et tamen peccatum in filium potest ex malitia contingere. ibid. And yet the sinne against the Sonne may proceede of malice, a man may be obstinate in it, yea, and impaenitent also to the end, perseuering in his sinne, witnesse Arrius the troubler of the world, whence it followeth that all sinne of Malice is not this sinne. And here must I needs intreat you to take notice how Bellarmine doth passe ouer this opinion, Haec sententia vera est, sed non satisfacit quaestiom. lib. 2. de Pamt. cap. 16. This sentence (sayth he) is true, but it satisfieth not the question, And why? Because albeit this sin be sinne of Malice, yet all sinne of Malice is not this sinne: The which he further confirmeth, because the sinne against the holy Ghost is Blasphemie, and so a speciall sinne, But sinne of Malice is not any one speciall sinne, neither is it alwayes blasphemie, but onely a generall kinde of sinne, the particulars whereof are sixe in number. Thus farre Bellarmine.

For if we should let loose the raines of our censorious judgement to condemne all presumptuous, all enuious, all obstinate, all impenitent persons, may wee not iustly feare that caueat of

Christ,Mat. 7. 1. 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , Iudge not that ye be not iudged? Far more modest, more charitable is the iudgement of Musculus;
                  Fieri potest vt qui hodie non recte presumat aut desperet, &c. crasista corrigat: Quodsi talis ad sinem vs

It may be that he who to day doth too much either presume, or despaire of Gods mercie, that is obstinate, that is impaenitent, or enuious, may correct these affections to morrow, and so be renewed by repentance, Quod si talis ad finem perseveret, But if he continue so to the end, well may he sinne to death, but yet he committeth not the sin against the holy Ghost.
               3. Argument. The sinne against the holy Ghost cannot be augmented by Circumstances: For, (as I said) it is the greatest, the Nil vltra of all sins. But all these may be exaggerated by the seuerall circumstances of Time, Place, Person, &c.
               4. Argument. That which Bellarmine sayth of Impenitencie, is true also of the most of these, viz.
                  Circumstantia quaedam, quae in omni peccato reperiri potest. Bell. loco citato. They are certaine Circumstances in all sinnes. They are certaine Symptomes of this sinne, but not the sinne it selfe. Or to speake more fauourably, they are some of them parts of it, some adiuncts, some necessary companions: but the sinne it selfe is some further matter.
               This in generall, now let vs single them out one by one, and bring them into the field, and so passe the Pikes of our Examination: Or, (if you will) let them come forth by couples, that so we may the sooner haue them dispatched:
               The first couple is, Impenitencie and Obstinacie. Impenitencie isImp

                  The setled purpose of a man wilfully determining neuer to repent. Wherein first I maruaile what great much more, what specificall difference can be made betwixt Impenitencie in this sense, and Obstinacie? For what is Obstinacie, butObstinatio est,

                     , quod peccato inhareat. Aquinabid. a resolute purpose and intention to continue in sinne? And what difference betwixt a Resolution to continue in sinne, and a Resolution not to repent? Especially, since there is no other way to leaue sinne, but by repentance? Nor to repent but by leauing sinne? When Iacob sent his sonnes into Aegypt

to buy Corne, his Motiue is,z 
                  That we may liue and not

                  They declare their sinne and hide it not: Compare these; what difference, Liue, and not dye; Declare, and not hide, Continue in sinne, and not repent of it?
               
               Secondly, Further, if we well consider of it, we shall easily see that this Propositum non revertendi, Purpose to continue still in sinne without repentance, is such a disposition as cannot sinke into the heart of a man, and therbe setled, vnlesse the Iudicial act of God do proceed against a man for former sinne. It sauoureth too much of Arminius poyson, to hold that a man may thus settle and dispose his owne heart, that hee would resist the worke of Gods spirit, and fully resolue with himselfe neuer to repent.
               Thirdly, Once more heare what Stella sayth concerning Impenitencie (which among all the sixe is that which most pleaseth the Rhemists, and which they doe most easily grant to be the sinne against the holy Ghost) Non est verisimile, tot p

                  It is not likely that all who dye in finall Impenitencie doe sinne against the holy Ghost.
               
               The next couple are, Impugnation of the knowne truth, and Envying of Gods graces bestowed vpon the brother-hood. These two come somewhat neere, especially, if wee remember their Genus, which is Peccatum ex malitia, Sinne grounded vpon malice. These are parts of that sinne wee seeke for, and (Ergo) I passe them over.
               Now for the last couple, viz. Desperation and Presumption. These cannot be that sinne which we seeke for. As for Desperation, how many poore soules haue there beene heretofore, who through the sense of GODS wrath and anger against sinne, whereof their guiltie conscience did accuse them, haue for a time, cast off all hope of pardon, fallen into despaire, as ifPsal. 77. 9. 10 
                  God had forgotten to be gracious, and had shut vp his louing kindnesse in displeasure; concluding plainely with Dauid, This is my death: and yet afterward, remembring the yeeres of the

               But what neede I Scripture, or experience, or the consent of Orthodoxall Writers, to proue this point, if our Adversaries will stand to their words, Thus then I set mine Argument.
               The sinne against the holy Ghost, is a sinne vnto death and irremissible, this is in confesso amongst all, and shall God willing be further confirmed when I come to the second maine point. In the meane space, I assume, Praesumption is not to death, but remissible, wherefore I conclude, that Presumption is not the sinne against the holy Ghost, and consequently neitheir can Desperation bee, becauseContraria sunt sub eodem genere posita. contraries are alwayes to be referred to the same head. The assumption I prooue out of the words of their owne Authors, He that shall vpon hope of a Iubilee to come, willingly and purposely fall into a sinne reserued may notwithstanding be absolved. Neither will their common Euasion serue the turne, to say, It is but one Doctors opinion, and therefore they are not bound to receiue it.

               Thus is it plaine (I hope) and euident, that hitherto we haue not found out that sinne which wee seeke for. The schoole-men, and their followers, though learned, wise, graue, judicious; yet haue in this point fayled, come short, and are not to be maintained.

I describe to be, A generall Apostasie, and revolt of a man wilfully fallen from the truth knowne, even to a malicious, persecuting, and blaspheming of the same.
               
               In the which before I come to particulars, I note in generall; that it is a sinne not so much against the person of the spirit, as against the worke of the spirit. For which we haue a cloud of witnesses. A whole day would not suffice to take their Examination: Let Beza speake for the rest. Hoc peccatum dicitur in spiritum sanctum committi, non quatenu

                  It is called the sinne against the holy Ghost, not as the spirit is a person in the sacred and euer blessed Trinitie (for neither is the dignity of the spirit greater then of the father, or the sonne, they being Athanasius in Symbolo. in glory coequall, in maiestie coeternall, which would follow, were the sinne against the person: Nor is it possible to offend any one person of this Tri-vnitie, but the iniurie doth redound to them all) but in respect of his proper and peculiar worke in vs. The which here is not so much the act of Faith and Repentance, cast off by Obstinacie and Impenitencie, nor of Hope and Feare, reiected by Desperation & Presumption, as of the illumination of the minde and vnderstanding, and the convincing of the Conscience and affections. This is that worke of the spirit, which this sinne opposeth, and opposing is sealed vp to be

                  Bucanus seemeth to contradict this. Hinc colligo. Hence (sayth he) I gather, that the sinne against the spirit, is not any transgression of the morall Law,

                  neither vniuersall nor particular, whether proceeding from ignorance, or infirmitie, or malice against the Law of God. This difference is not so great, but an easie reconciliation will suffice. For either Beza meanes no more then this, that it is directly and immediately against God, as the breaches of the first Table, not mediately as the breaches of the second. Or else he enlargeth the bounds of the Law, including vnder it the knowledge of the Mediatour, which Bucan 
                  In his common place of the Law, hee speaketh not one word of the knowledge of a Mediator, but handleth it meerely as an exposition of the law of nature, giuen to Adam before

               And certainely, I fully beleeue that this sinne against the holy Ghost doth necessarily suppose the knowledge

of the Mediatour, for it seemeth impossible, See this hand led afterward. that the creature should vnrecoverably fall from the Creatour, vntill he haue reiected also the helpe of the Mediatour offered to him. So that by Truth in my definition, I vnderstand not with the Novatians any naturall, morall, or civill, truth wherof certain knowledge is obtained, no, nor any supernatural truth in Scripture reuealed: but the supernaturall Truth of the Gospell, that euerlasting Word of Truth, to witnesse which Iohn 18. 37. Christ came into the world. In which respect Christ calls himselfe the Iohn 14. 16. 
                  Truth, viz. Quia ipse est materia & argumentum totius Evangelij. Zanch. de operi. Dei. lib. 4.

                   the Antithesis betwixt the contempt of the Law, and the contempt of the Gospell, handled in Heb. 10. 28.
               This Truth must be knowne to the partie, he must be enlightened, hee must haue a competent measure of knowledge, before he falleth into this sinne. For confirmation of this (to omit that of Paul Heb. 10. 26. 
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , after wee haue receiued the knowledge of the truth) let vs consider how he enlargeth this point, Heb. 6. 4 what phrases the Apostle vseth to set

forth the measure of grace to which they had attained. Marke his wordes,

               There are two diuerse applications of this place if they may bee called Diuerse, which all tende to the same ende. For some doe apply each phrase to signifie some particular thing. Thus Hemingius and Iunius.

                     Heming. in Heb. 6. 4. 
                  Praecedunt peccatum in spiritum sanctum, (sayth hee) there goes before this our sinne fiue things, first An illumination. Secondly, A tast of the heauenly gift. Thirdly, A participation of the holy Ghost. Fourthly, A tast of the good ward of God. Fiftly, A tast of the powers of the world to come. These hee thus explaineth. This Illumination is the knowledge of Christ and his benefits. The taste of the heauenly gift, is the participation of these benefits by faith. The communion of the Spirit is the Testimony of the Spirit in the hearts of the faithfull concerning the truth of God. The good worde of which they tasted, is the instrumentall cause of the former, for by the word comes knowledge, by knowledge faith, the holy Ghost being powred into our heartes. The powers of the worlde to come, is that blessed Immortalitie which the faithfull and beleeuers doe tast of through the holy Ghost, who doth renew their hearts. Thus farre Hemingius, very well and to good purpose; if withall you note the Emphasis, and and force of the word, Gustaverunt, haue tasted, hee sayth not Bucan. le

For it is one thing to beleeue truely, and plenarily as did Lidia, whose heart the Lord opened, another thing to haue onely a tast. Piscator, handleth these fiue phrases thus: They containe (saith he) first, The benefits of God bestowed, which are two, viz illumination, and a tast of Gods

fauour: Secondly, The causes of them, viz. The word and the Spirit.

The first head of Catechisme was Repentance from dead workes, to which answereth the 
                     Annot: Thus they doe agree in the number albeit they disagree in the application of the number. Piscator maketh but foure. first phrase, were once enlightned, (idest) were called from darknesse (yea death) to light (yea life) by the renouncing of themselues and their dead workes. The second, was faith towardes God, to which answereth the second phrase, Haue tasted of the heauenly gift, which gift is faith, receiued from God. The third ground was the Doctrine of Baptismes, not Baptisme onely, but Baptismes as well the inward of the Spirit (whereby we are made the members of Christ, the sonnes of God, and inheritors of the kingdome of heauen) as the outward of the Minister by which wee are receiued into the Church, and acknowledged members thereof. To this answereth the third phrase, were made partakers of the holy Ghost (id est) receiued the Spirit, a most constant witnesse of their adoption and redemption. The fourth head was the Doctrine of the Imposition of hands, a ceremony vsed at that time to admit and consecrate by a publicke consent, those who vpon tryall were found sufficient, either to the common profession of Christianity in the comunion of the Sacrament; or to some speciall office or function in the ministry. To which answereth the fourth phrase, Haue tasted of the good word of God, which is the nourishment of those who doe liue by the Spirit, and who by the Imposition of hands were called to the offices of a Christian life.
               The last ground of the catechisme was the Doctrine
                  
                  of the resurrection 
                  
                     Iunius joyneth these two in one, whereas Beza joyneth Baptismes and impositiō together, and disjoineth these two last. Piscator, dissereth from both: for hee joyneth Baptismes and Imposition together as did Beza: and Resurrection and aeternall iudge ment, as did Inmus. Vter horum melius Iudicet Lector.
                   
                  and aeternall iudgement; to which answereth the last phrase, Haue tasted of the powers of the world to come, (id est) That hope of life, and immortalitie, which is layd vp for them in the heauen. Hitherto Iunius laudably indeede, if there be, tantum certitudinis, quantum subtilitatis, so much certainety as subtilty in this his application.
               And this is the former.
               The second kinde of Application is of them who do apply all these fiue phrases to signifie one selfe same thing. Thus Caluin the Coriphaeus of our Diuines Calv. Coment. in heb.. 6.
                   
                  Notandum est, saayth hee, wee must heere marke with what Elogies the Apostle doth set forth, the

                  knowledge of the Gospell: For hee calleth it, first, Illumination, intimating that men doe grope in darkenes till Christ the day-starre doe arise in their hearts. Secondly, The tast of the heauenly gift, teaching that the benefits of Christ doe transcend the heauens, and yet by faith are tasted. Thirdly, The Participation of the Spirit, because hee it is that distributeth to each one as he listeth. Fourthly, The tast of the good word of God, signifying that in the Gospel the will of God is so manifested to vs, as that it doth most sweetely delight vs. Fiftly, The tast of the powers of the world to come, insinuating, that by faith wee are admitted into the heauenly kingdome, beholding thorow faith that blessed immortalitie which is layd vpp for vs in the heauen. Thus Caluin.
               
               To the same effect, Zanchius, who thus explaineth himselfe,

               To stay no longer in this discourse (for I feare you thinke me tedious alreadie) whether wee vnderstand this place of seuerall graces with Hermingius and Piscator, or apply it to the points of the Catechisme with Iunius, or make it an Endiadis with Bullinger, or referre it to the Gospell with Zanchius, or to the knowledge of the Gospell with Calvin, Here I obserue two thinges for our purpose, first, That the Terminus a quo, from whence is the Truth of the Gospell not of the Law,Saul in Beza. Bucan & vrsins chateth. Arrius in Beza Annot. on Heb. 10. Spira in Polan. Partit. lib. 2 Iudas in Fulke Bucan, & Vrsin. yea he is so censured by S. Ambrose▪ Comment. on Luk. 22. Cassa erat proditoris paenitentia, qui peccavit in spiritum sanctum. secondly, That this truth must bee knowne. I might also adde Professed, but that would too much streighten, and restraine the search of it. For Diuines doe obserue two sorts of men, subiect to this our sinne. Some haue both knowne the truth, and also made profession of the fame, as These examples of this sin, I find in writers. Iulian, and the Pharis
                           •
                        es confessed of all. 
                  Saul, Iudas, Alexander the Copper-smith, Arrius, Francis Spira, and Iulian the Apostata; All these made profession of the Gospell before they fell away. And by name Iulianus was well grounded in the Christian Religion, knew the truth of the Gospell, was baptised, yea, and publiquely did make profession of it, and yet through the perswasions, inticements, and allurements of those wicked Philosophers, Libanius, Iamblicus,
                  
and others, he fell away and became a most cruell persecutor. This is one sort: Another there is, which haue certaine knowledge of the truth, but yet haue not giuen their names to professe it, but doe hate, persecute, and blaspheme it, calling it erroneous, haereticall, and diabolicall; Such were the Pharisees, against whom our Sauiour Christ disputeth, Mat. 12. Who albeit they did know this to bee truth which Christ taught, knew that he was the Messiah, that his miracles were wrought by the finger of God, yet of an obstinate, enuious, and malitious minde resisted, contradicted, and blasphemed. Such were some of Stephens accusers, they knew the truth of that he taught, yea, and were convicted in their consciences, so that they could not resist the spirit by which he spake. But the most manifest example is in Satan and his Angels. For though he know the truth, that is, That Christ is God, the Sauiour of the world, that all felicitie is to be hoped from him alone: yet still he doth resist slander, and blaspheme the truth▪ and hauing maliciously rejected it himselfe, doth labour by all meanes, to bring men into the same state of condemnation. Hence come all heresies which doe oppose the Truth: Hence come Atheisme and Epicurisme, whereby all care of Religion is cast off. Yea, which is most of all to be wondered at, albeit he knoweth that his wickednesse falleth still vpon his owne pate, yet he doth still resist because he will resist. To wind vp this point, All they who fall into this sinne first of all doe attaine to a certaine and assured knowledge of the truth, though all doe not professe it. Yea, and which is more, it is no swimming motion, but a full perswasion, Therefore Beza translateth that 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . Heb. 10. 26. Receiuing and acknowledging. so that the Conscience thereby is convicted and constrained secretly to confesse it so to be as the Pharisees, whiles they are in the Synedrion can say, What 
                  Ioh. 11. 47. 
                  shall wee doe? for this man doth many miracles. And afterwards, Act. 4. 16. 
                  A manifest miracle is wrought by these men, and we cannot deny it. Hence it is that Paul was excusable, in that he did it through ignorance,

as many now also doe, persecute the Truth, which if they were perswaded that it was the Truth would embrace it with all readinesse.
               I would faine now passe from the Whence to the Whether, were it not that I feare least some of Arminius brood should hereupon buzze into your eares, that this Illumination, this knowledge is sauing knowledge. And the Grace, sauing Grace; and that there is at all no difference betwixt them, but onely Perseverance, and thereby would hope to confirme their poysonous, and vncomfortable Doctrine of Recidivation, and falling from saving Grace once received. And yet I will, for why should I feare this? Certes I neede not, if you will be pleased to remember and often to meditate on those three disparisons betwixt Temporizers, and true beleeuers, which the late Reuerend Synod of Dort hath observed out of our Sauiours parable, viz. 
                     Synod: Dort. cap. 5. In the rejection of erorrs, sect. 7. first, That Temporisers receiue the seede in a stonie, but true beleevers in a good ground, id est, in an honest and good heart. Secondly, They want roote, These are rooted, and grounded, haue a fast roote. Thirdly, Those are fruitlesse, these bring forth fruit with patience, constancie, and Perseverance. So that though the mind be enlightened, yet the conscience is not purified; though the braine swim with motions, yet the heart wanteth vpright affections: though the vnderstanding bee enformed, yet the will is not reformed; much lesse the whole man trans-formed into the image of Iesus Christ. This if you will remember, you shall not neede to feare the enticing words of mans wisedome, which cunning seducers vse to beguile vnstable soules. And thus I passe from the Terminus a quo, to the Terminus adquem, from the Whenoe to the Whether: that as we haue seene where they stood before their fall, so now wee may see their practise since their praecipitation.
               The Terminus ad quem, the Whether hath in it two speciallTerminus ad quem. words (for as for bluspheming it is a species of Persecuting) and it is no moment whether of them wee set

first, whether Malitious or Persecution, for it is a Malicious persecuting, and a Persecuting malice. Yet since the effect declares the cause, and this persecuting is the effect of that cause, let vs if you will first speake of this and afterwards come to the other.

                  Paul sayth of Alexander,

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , He greatly resisted our words, the doctrine that Paul preached. Neither doe they stay here, but they oppose3. Maiestie of God. 3. The Maiestie of God himselfe. Indeede their hand is too short, but they supply it with aboundance of malice and hatred, yea, and their tongues shall walke at libertie, against the God of heauen. And like as the Rev. 12. 17. 
                  Great redd Dragon when he could no longer remaine in heauen, nor devoure the woman, then he went and made warre with the remnant of her seede; So these men when the person of Christ himselfe is exalted aboue the heavens, is so high that they cannot reach him, then doe they turne the sea of their Malice against his members, and in them they persecute him.
               Particularly there are two sorts of men which being relapsed into this sinne, doe bring forth two speciall

kinds of persecution. Men of authoritie doe draw forth the sword of Iniustice, and crueltie. Like the 4. Gellius. lib. 11. cap. 18. 
                  Athenian Draco, they write lawes with the bloud of Christians, and make Statutes that no man may buy or sell, saue such who renounce their Religion. Thus Saul hunts Dauid like a Partridge in the Mountaines, sucketh the bloud of the Priests like a Lyon in the wildernesse

Abraham is merry, Sarah reioyceth, the whole familie semblably affected, onely he in his brothers person, mocketh God, slighteth his promise, derideth Father Abrahams faith. Thus hee that was borne after the flesh persecuted him that was borne after the spirit; and heavyer was his tongue, then could haue beene his hand.

               Neither is this peculiar to men of learning, though in them most perspicuous: others also can raile and revile the Truth.

               Wee haue perused the effect in our Whether, nowMalitious. turne your eyes, and see the cause. The cause is Malice. Yea this Malice is the Essentiall forme of it Forma dat esse & distinguere. which giueth life to it, and distinguisheth it from other persecution. For all Persecution of the truth is not so seuerely to be censured. Many are carryed with a blinde zeale to defend Superstition which they conceit to bee the truth. Heeretofore in those Queene Maries dayes. bloody times of Antichrists domineering raigne ouer vs, though many especially of the learned sort, cannot bee excused from violating, yea, and resisting the checke of their owne consciences in persecuting the Gospell: yet the common people, and many other were ledd with a blind zeale to defend Popish received Errours, and thereupon to oppose whatsoeuer was contrary to it. The same is to be said of diverse among Stephens auditors, they did not all (questionlesse) resist the spirit, though diverse of them did, but were carried with a blind zeale for the defence

of the Temple, and the Law of Moses.
               
               This their Malice is set forth in Scripture by diverse phrases, Heb. 6. 4. first,

It was (therefore) the feare of death that maketh him forget his Master, his fellowes, his profession, yea himselfe, and his owne knowledge. Such is not our sinne: Wee finde Malice, and Malice in the highest degree, which vpon a bent Resolution and settled purpose, doth affect that kinde of behauiour. It is a witting, a willing, a wilfull Malice, much like to that of Satan,

Earthly power, and worldly pompe, which least they might not be violent enough of their owne accord, are spurred and pricked on by two most passionate Waggoners, Feare and Envie. For partly through feare to loose that that they haue, and partly through envie of anothers glory, are men ledd forth violently into the vntilled and accursed fielde of spitefull Malice. This is the disposition of our Apostata'es. In whom, if time and place doe serue their turne, you may obserue yet further two other fruits of their Malice, viz first, a forsaking of the Communion of Saints. Secondly, A siding and ioyning fellowship with the Adversaries.
               
               The first is perpetuall; for how should they ioyne societie with those whom they hate mortally, and wish extinguished? The other not so perpetuall, but where it is to be found doth most easily and apparantly detect this sinne. Saul could not side with the adversaries but Iulian could: Iudas did attempt, but Alexander did effect it, and therefore the sinne of these is more easie to be discerned then of the other. Hitherto of the termes, Where they were, Where they are, Whence they fell, Whether they are fallen. A word or two of their Motion and so an end of the first generall part at the first propounded.
               The Motion doth comprehend three words, whichMotion. doe shew the Genus of this sinne, viz. Apostasie, and the differences of this Apostasie from others, in that it is

                  Generall and Voluntary.
               
               The word Apostasie signifieth Recidivation, Relapsing,

               This Apostasie is not any particular Relapse from some particular points in Religion. Herein were the Novatians blame-worthy, who applyed that Text of Heb. 6. against such who sinned after Baptisme.

bad beginnings, and men are to take heede of them: but this is a Generall relapse and Apostasie, which may bee manifested. 1. By the vse of the word in Scripture phrase. For it is appropriated to signifie a generall and vniuersall falling away. So Paul vseth the same word to signifie the manner of departing from sinne, which ought to be in Christians, viz. a generall and vniversall;

                  prorsus lapsi, if they fall a way, id est, altogether, totally. For reason willeth that the fall bee as generall as the grace receiued. Excellent to this purpose is the saying of Calvin, commenting vpon the place, Nodus totius disputationis, &c. The knott of the whole question, and disputation betwixt vs and the Nouatians dependeth on the right vnderstanding of that word Prolabantur, If they fall away, whereupon hee distinguisheth betwixt a perticular and an vniuersall fall. Particular into some particular sinne, as Murder, Adultery, and the like. But the Apostle speaketh not of these, Sed not

                      peccator. Calv. ibid. but of an vniuersall defection and falling away from the Gospell. Where the sinner doth not in some one thing offend God, but doth altogether cast away grace received. Thus Calvin. The which he further confirmeth by the Calv. Instit. lib. 3. c. 7. § 22. 
                  Antithesis, and opposition betwixt the grace of God bestowed vpon him, and this his fall. So that if the grace be generall as wee heard before, so also must be the falling away.
               The summe of all this is, It is not a particular lapsing, sliding, falling, but a generall and vniuersall falling away. Not the Eclipsing, or clouding of the sunne, but the full setting, yea, such a setting as admitteth no rising, aeternall night. Like Noahs invndation overflowing all the face of the earth: overwhelming the partie delinquent within an Ocean of filthines and polution. The children of God doe fall, but these fall away: Dauid may grieue the spirit of God, but Saul did quite quench

it. In a word, it is not Deliquium animi, a fayling, or swooning, but seperatio animae, a separation, a plaine death, a totall, generall, and vniuersall Apostasie.
               Two wayes is this Apostasie said to bee vniuersall, first, Simply, when men doe cast off all Religion, renounce the truth wholly, altogether contemning both it, and all that belongeth to it, to their might, opposing, hating, blaspheming, and persecuting all that professe, and fauour it. Of this kind were those in the Primitiue Church, who revolted to Paganisme, and Gentilisme, as did Iuliaa the Emperour: and as many doe questionlesse, who liue among the barbarous Turkes, and leauing their former profession, doe turne Turkes, and embrace their abhominations: and some that abide in the bosome of the Church, who fall away to plaine Atheisme.
               Secondly, Consequently when men doe fall away and renounce some maine fundamentall poynt of the Gospell; the which being violently opposed, doth indeed by consequence strike at all the rest. Such was the Apostacie of

while the man apprehendeth that to be evill which is not, and so desireth to shunne it, and when consent is yeelded, the will doth willingly will that which it willeth.

               From all this I gather, first, That affected ignorance is so farre from excusing a fault, that it doth rather aggravate the offence. Secondly, That neither feare, nor violence can altogether excuse men from blame in willing evill, because the willingnesse of the will cannot be compelled, though indeed it may be much perswaded.

It is free from violence, from feare, from ignorance, which are the causes that doe in any respect cause involuntary actions. Yet this doth not hinder, but that there may bee some incitation, some inclination, and stirring of the will by some externall Obiect.
               As the Scribes and Phaerisees were ambitious and loved the prayse of men; this inclined their will. Iudas was covetous, a theefe, and the hope of gaine stirred his will. Yea this their concupiscence and desire did make their

                     m. ibid. not onely is the will mooved by the desire of good, and the chiefe end; but also it is often necessary that the first act of the will be stirred vp by some externall Obiect. Neither can any man say that the Apostasie of Iudas, the falling away of Demas, and the like, was not properly to bee termed wilfull, because there was some outward respect to mooue them: vnlesse also he will deny that Adam

                  ell voluntarily, in whom there was an externall Obiect, and a forcible perswader to stirre vp the act of his will.
               Last of all, in Saul, Iudas, Iulian, and the like, their action must needs be simply voluntary, in that they had time of Deliberation. For the Apprehension of good doth not worke so effectually vpon the will as doth the Apprehension of euill. And therefore those passions which doe apprehend good, doe not take away Election and Deliberation, but doe allow men sufficient time to thinke of all inconveniences, and giue them libertie to resolue whether they will doe so or no. Whereas those passions which doe apprehend euill, doe not so easily suffer a man to consult, and therfore if these cause not involuntary actions, much lesse doe the former.
               Whereby you see the difference betwixt the fact of Iudas, and the fall of Peter. Iudas hath time to call his witts together, to consult with Reason, to deliberate with himselfe what hee will doe, to summe vp all inconveniences that may ensue, and thereupon proceedeth vpon full purpose and resolute intention. Whereas Peter hath no such respite, on the sudden hee must answere, and had no time to forethinke himselfe; For the feare of danger had so possessed him, that no place was

left for Deliberation. Hitherto concerning the first maine part of my Discourse, shewing what this sinne against the holy Ghost is. Now let mee lead you a-long to the second, viz. Why it is so mortall. Let not your patience fayle mee to the end.

                  FOr confirmation of this second point, though much might be said, yet it shall now be my care rather to select that which is most for the purpose, then to collect and heape together a multitude of matter, of which perhaps some might say, and say truly, Totum hoc est

                  Assumption. Such is this our sinne, irremissible, and without all hope of pardon, and therefore mortall.

Certainely his observation is good and worthie to be remembred, not onely of a Writer, but also of an Oratour, of an Auditor. Of an Oratour, least he abuse his Auditory. Of an Auditor least his censure seeme rather to proceed from the rashnesse of a Caviller, then from the judgement of an vnderstanding hearer.
               
                  Wherefore as in the handling of the former Part, raised all my matter from the definition praefixed, and reduced the words of the definition to certaine heads, that so still I might reade my Title, and you might see what I was in doing: So, here in this second Part, that both you and I may still finde our selues, this shall bee the Title, that wee must often reade, viz. The assumption of the former Sillogisme. For I hope that in prooving this our sinne to be irremissible, I shall draw each one to conclude with me, That it is mortall. The irremissibilitie stands then to bee confirmed by the rule of Faith, which is Scripture, by the guide of action which is reason.

Or if the Apostle meane that this sinne of Apostasie doth exclude from a second Baptisme: wherein shall it differ from other sinnes, vnlesse other sinnes may allow a man a second Baptisme vpon his Repentance which were ridiculous?

                  All mortall sinnes whether great or small (he should haue excepted this our sinne) are remissible before death, but after death are irremissible and remaine for euer. Secondly, or Irremissible, Ex parte contemptus, because it contemneth the mercy of God, and reiecteth that by which man might obtaine pardon. Thirdly, Or else because it deserueth to haue no pardon, as being a sinne of certaine and wilfull malice, for which cause it can haue none: Whereas sinnes of infirmity and ignorance may seeme to deserue some hope of pardon. Thus Aquinas very well, if we bee fauorable in his censure, he hath another reason▪ why it is called Irremissible, but indeed that h

doe define it. Now who seeth not, that if this bee Impaenitency, and Impaenitency the sinne against the holy Ghost, and the sinne against the holy Ghost, a sinne vnto death; what a strong and inexpugnable ground here is for Popish Paenance? The same is there here for Commutation of Paenance, for if this sinne be remissible, but not de sacile, easily, then must there come a good round portion to the Priest for a gentle Commutation. Some such reason as this, I guesse moued the holy Fathers of shrift, to magnifie this exposition that Aquinas giueth of Irremissible, or else this: As one well obserueth in their handling of Mat. 12. they follow S. Augustine walking alone, rather then Hillary, Ierome, Chrysostome and other, for what reason he knoweth not, vnlesse it be for that, here, Augustine went farthest from the words and sence of the Scripture: So I may say here, I see not why this should please them better than the other, vnlesse it be for that it goeth farthest from the words and sence of the holy Scripture.
               But to let these passe, come we to those Reasons which more Orthodoxall writers will afford vs, the which for my memories sake I will reduce to three heads. Some are drawne from the Obiect. Some from the Nature. Some from the Punishment of this sinne. The Obiect against which this sinne doth bend it selfe, is externally, the Gospell: Internally, the spirit of Grace, that worketh by the Gospell.
               First then it being a sinne against the Gospell it mustGospell. needes be Irremissible: For, what is the Gospell but the word of Grace, the ministration of Life, declaring vnto man (in himselfe lost) a way by which he may returne to his former estate of Grace and Glory. Now so long as there is not the knowledg of the Mediator, and of this meanes of recouery, the words of the Lord haue place. q 
                  Shall they fall, and not arise? Shall they

                      4 
                  turne away, and not turne againe? But when once the meanes of recouery by the Gospell is neglected, contemned,

and despised, then is there no place for remission: So long as there is not the knowledge of the Mediator, it seemeth impossible that the creature should Irrecouerably fall from the Creator.
               And herein certainly is there one maine difference, betwixt the fall of Adam, and the fall of the Angels. Adam fell by misperswasion, being deceiued by the lying suggestion of the spirit of error: D•. Field of the Church li. 1. cap. 3. But the Angels being intellectuall spirits, dwelling in heauenly places, in the presence of God, and light of his countenance, could not sinne by error or misperswasion, but of purposed malice, which is the sinne against the holy Ghost, and is Irremissible. Adam falling from the knowledg of the Law, fell recouerably: They falling from the knowledge of the Gospell, fell Irrecouerably: For vnderstanding of this. I praesuppose, that God did signifie to the Angels these points at once. First, that their Righteousnesse consisted in their Obedience. Secondly, that the acceptance of their obedience should bee through Christ. Christ, I say, who in fulnesse of time was to be incarnate, and to take, not the nature of Angels, but of man, and by the personall vnion of the two natures in his one person, lift vp the humanitie aboue the nature of Angels, and so remayning one indiuiduall person, to be the head of the Church. Thirdly, that from this person should be expected, all good whatsoeuer, so that what good soeuer the creature was to receiue, they were to receiue it from God only, in the name of this mediator, this being the summe of the Gospell, no doubt, was deliuered to them▪ and so in a manner the whole will and councell of God, both of Law and Gospell, and that by a shorter and neerer way than man is capable of; they hauing Field ibidem. the fulnesse of intellectuall light▪ so that when they take view of any thing, they see all that pertaineth to it, whereas man findeth but one thing after another.

                   doctrine of the Gospell being manifested to them, the deuills reiected

it, partly puffed vp with pride, in respect of the excellency of their owne nature, scorning to be accepted in any but themselues; partly enuying so great glory to the nature of man, disdayning to bee subiect to Christ, as man, and to stand obliged to him for all benefits; altogether refused to be obedient to this ordinance of God, and so refused as that they chose rather to leaue their first estate, and their heauenly habitation, than to agree and subscribe, and submit themselues, to this aeternall and immutable decree of God. And which is yet more plaine to manifest their sinne, to be the sinne against the holy Ghost: They fell, hauing receiued the knowledg of the whole worke of the three persons, for, and vnto the Angels. First, of God the Father, creating and giuing a Law, and taking exception against their disobedience. Secondly, of God the Sonne, in whom only stood reconciliation and acceptance, through his obedience, more worth and honorable to God the Father, than that of all the creatures, both Angels and men. Thirdly, of God the holy Ghost, by whose power and grace only, is possibility for any creature, man or Angell, to stand or recouer. This in modesty may we beleeue to haue beene the fall of Angels, whose sinne is Irremissible as is this our sinne in man, because it is an Apostasie from the Gospell.
               Secondly, as against the Gospell, so against the Spirit,Spirit. which worketh grace by the Gospell. The Schoolemen said not nothing, inascribing Power to the Father, Knowledge to the Sonne, and Grace to the holy Ghost. Against the Father men sinne of infirmitie, against the Sonne of Ignorance, and these two are remissible. But against the holy Ghost men sinne of malice, and this is irremissible. But I would rather haue said thus: That in regard these men sinne against the spirit (id est, the proper effect and worke of the spirit in them) their sinne must needs be irremissible, because there is not another person in the Trinitie, whereby they might receiue

grace, and arise to Repentance: For God the Father bestowed Innocencie and righteousnesse vpon the creature at the first, by which he might liue. This being lost, God the sonne came to repaire it, and to restore vs to our former estate, and he indeed paid the price of our redemption. But man being in the state of nature could haue no benefit by it. Then came the holy Ghost and regenerated and quickened man, and taught him what Christ had done for him, what is the vertue of his death and passion, yea, the spirit also applieth the bloud of Christ, and by it washeth and purifieth the heart of man, and so sanctifieth both body and soule. Hitherto you see how still as man profiteth not by the former grace, there is yet another person in the Trinitie who by a second worke can make the first effectuall. But now, when it is come to this, that the worke of the spirit is resistell, and impugned, so that these three persons haue giuen him over▪ there is none other meanes for him to recover. For to whom should hee goe when these forsake him? Where may he finde a Physitian, if these conclude his wound is incurable?
               Where are you all you grand Imposters of the world? You strict defenders of the Intercession of Saints and Angels? Now come forth and helpe. Here, here is place for the Indulgences of your Popes, the merits of your Saints, the intercession of your Angels. Here is a man forsaken of God, out of all hope of heauen, can you now cure him? If there be any Deity in your Saints, any Divinitie in your Angels, any hope, any helpe, any merit, any mercy, any vertue, any power, now let them shew it; Let them recouer this forlorne man out of the gulfe of hell, restore him to his former estate of grace: reforme his will, cure his affections, renew his minde, create a right spirit within him, in a word vendicate him from everlasting perdition, and destruction. Oh! miserable comforters are you all: here, where there is need of helpe you doe forsake, there, where there is no

Had we not seene, we had had no sinne, but now that wee see, our sinne remaineth: It had bin better not to haue knowne the way of righteousnesse, then after knowledge to turne from the holy Commandement. Better

saith Peter, id est, lesse punishable by farre. Affected ignorance is very lyable to the curse of God, but witting reiection of knowledge once receiued is abhominable. If we sinne 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   after the knowledge and acknowledging of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sinne.
               As they are destitute of pardon, because wittinglyWilfully. they sinne, so also because wilfully. The will of man (the other principall facultie in mans soule) was endued with freedome, that so it might freely worke: and following the direction and guidance of the vnderstanding might apply it selfe to embrace and choose the good, and to eschew and refuse the evill. The strength of this indeed was overthrowne by Adams fall, but it being much renewed by Christ, serveth to the same end still. Wherefore when men doe wilfully and of set purpose, turne aside and sinne, not of infirmitie, but of peevishnesse, who can helpe them? If the Patient bee willing to be cured, the Phisitian may by his skill doe much: But if he be froward, perverse, wilfull, obstinate, and will not be healed, there may be balme in Gilead, and Physitians there, but yet the wound will not bee recouered.

               It is worth the noting, that in the Law there was no Sanctuary for wilfull murtherers. Neither in the Gosspell is there any pardon for wilfull Apostataes. It is the word of the Lord, and it will be found true, Le. 26. 23. 24.

                      deale frowardly. You haue seene a stubborne sonne, and a severe father, (as it were) striving for the victory. The father scourgeth him for his fault, the sonne

he striveth, strugleth, roareth, sobbeth, snubbeth, and ready he is to burst for anger. The father then groweth angry, and to him againe, and layeth on sorer & fiercer yet will not the varlet yeeld; stubborne still, stomackfull, fretting, vexing, no father, no mother, no blessing, no submission: What should the father now doe? Must he now let him carry it away? Certainely it is not the best: No, he is resolved either to breake this his stomacke, or teare away this rebellious flesh, discover the sinnewes, let him bloud; now he is growne resolute, and there is no mercy with him, no compassion, his mother may not intreate, nor his friends begge his pardon: No, since he hath begun to walke stubbornely against his father, his father will walke stubbornely against him. And deseruedly. So is it here: This perverse, peevish, stubborne, obstinate wilfullnesse maketh the sinne to be Irremissible.
               Neither is there a fault onely in the will but also in theMaliciously. actions, which addeth more fuell to the fire prepared for the punishment of this sinne. The propensitie & pronenesse in mans nature to moue forward toward his end, God placed in the will, and this his will hee furnished with divers affections, as the

This hatred therefore is an affection in it selfe like to the planet Mercury, neither good nor bad, but according to the Obiect: There is an hatred good and just, viz. which is bent against evill, and this is the right vse of the affection. There is an hatred wicked, and vniust, viz. when men hate that which is good: and this continueth not long but it bringeth forth malice. The which is bad enough where

(least of all) euill; so the more excellent that the good is which it opposeth, the more exorbitant is it and abhominable. When as therefore the affection that should keepe vs from evill, is perverted to keep vs from good: When this peruerted affection is directed, nay, vomited forth against God, his Church, his truth, his seruants, those that professe the name of Iesus: how wicked, how pestilent is this alienation? What hope of pardon can there be to such a one? Or which way might one deuise to care him? Though the disease be dangerous, yet if the Patient be willing to be healed, haue an affectionate loue to his Physitian, there may bee some hope: But when hee groweth to be peevish, loatheth his foode, quarrels with his friends, hateth his Physitian, resisteth his Physicke, who can helpe it if he goe to his graue, & that speedily? So here, when man growes to this passe that he crucifieth againe the sonne of God, trampleth vnder-foote the bloud of the new Testament, doth despight to the spirit of grace, and thus professeth himselfe an open enemy, and adversary: What can remaine, but a fearefull looking for of judgement, and violent fire, which shall devoure the adversaries?
               Lastly, this sinne commeth to be irremissible, in thatTotally. it is a totall and vniuersall Apostasie. 
                  Dan. 4. 15▪
                   
                  Nebuchadnezzars tree might yet flourish againe: for the roote was left in the earth. Act. 20. 10. 
                  Eutichus fell from the third loft, yet there was hope: for his life was in him. Luke 10. 30. The Travailer was sore wounded, yet recovered, how so? They left him but halfe dead. So though Dauid fall by adultery, Salomon by Idolatry, Peter by denyall, yet there is hope of recouery: the roote remaineth, the life is not quite gone, his seede remaineth in them. But Iud. ver. 12. 
                  Iudes trees are past recouery: why so? They were twise dead and plucked vp by the rootes. Daniels 
                  Dan. 6. 24. accusers were incurable. For why? the Lyons brake all their bones or euer they came at the ground of the den. 2. Sam. 2. 23. 
                  Asahells wound was past all Chirurgery, for Abner smote him vnder the

fift ribbe, namely, whereas the liuely parts lye. So when the fall is totall, that vtterly decayeth the life and brings in death, what hope can there be of Remedie?
               Some there are, which make a nice distinction betwixt Totall and Finall recidivation: and I deny not, but the termes are different: but experience teacheth, and the Scripture confirmeth, that in substance they are not much different. For where there is a Totall, there is also a finall losse of grace. Witnesse the euill Angels who hauing once totally lost their grace, haue lost it for euer. Witnesse Adam, who hauing once lost Originall righteousnesse totally, lost it also finally: God indeede doth sanctifie particular persons, but not the Humane nature in generall any more. And the reasons drawne from the nature of this sinne, proue it to be Irremissible and consequently mortall.
               You haue heard the nature of the sinne which proueth it to be irrecouerable. Now turne your eyes and behold the punishment of it, likewise confirming the irremissibilitie of it. Not the plenary penalty of it, but the praeparatiue; not that which hereafter is to be expected, but some of that which in this life is executed and inflicted: So much of it I meane as conducteth to this end, to proue it to be Irremissible.
               Wherein first cōmeth to be considered, that God depriuethDepriued of the Churches prayers. them of the Churches prayers. He will not haue such prayed for, and therefore their sin must needs be Irremissible. Frame the Argument thus. They who sinning may not be partakers of the Churches prayers, are without all hope of pardon. Such are our Apostataes (ergo). The proposition is manifest. For to what cause should they be denyed the Churches prayers, which are many times a meanes to worke repentance in men, and to procure pardon for them, but onely because God doth not entend to haue any mercy on them? Why isIer. 7. 16. & 11. 14. & cap. 14. 11. 
                  Ieremy forbidden to pray for the people, but because the Lord had an entention not to heare him,

but to consume them vtterly? The Prayer of a
                  Iam. 5. 16. 
                  faithfull man auaileth much if it be feruent; witnesse Moses praying for the people, and Eliah against them: And therefore the Lord in this point dealeth as a King vseth to doe, that knoweth his owne mercifull nature, hauing determined to cut of such a rebell, doth withall forbid the prayers of all such▪ who might intercede for him, least perhaps their importunacy might mooue him to mercie.
               The Assumption also is as cleare, for notwithstanding the false Interpretation of the Iesuits, yet it hath beene prooued before that these words of S. Iohn, I say not that thou shouldest pray for it, are a direct prohibition, interdicting and forbidding any prayers to be made for him that sinneth vnto death. So also we reade that the Lord did1 Sam. 16. 1. reproue Samuell for mourning for Saul, whom the Lord had reiected, intimating that we ought not to shew our selues more pitifull than God, nor to mourne for them whom the Lord hath reiected. Neither doe I reade any prayer, either by Samuell or Dauid, after that time, conceiued for Saul. Lastly, our Sauiour in his prayer doth except Iudas the sonne of perdition.
               Neyther is this all: But as they may not pray for such,Imprecation. so also do they pray agaiust them: Thus haue holy men of God heretofore, being stirred with zeale, for Gods glory, deuowed and accursed the wicked and malicious enemies of the Church. Thus Dauid many times: Let vs obserue his vehemency,Psal. 69. 22▪ 29.

The Ecclesiasticall Histories doe record, that diuers in the primitiue Church, did pray against Iulian the Apostata, applying the Psalmes of Dauid against him and his Idolatry, and after his fall, the Church of Antioch made feasts of ioy, reioycing greatly ouer him, and mocking and deluding his followers and adhaerents:

               Neyther are we to suppose that these are left to vs only, as matterr of History, monuments of Antiquity: But certainely for matter of imitation, alwaies prouided that we warily and carefully, haue respect vnto those things which are to be obserued in Imprecation. Now that we may be true imitators of Dauid, and so lawfully apply the Psalmes of Imprecation, we must saithCaluin cōment in Psal. 
                  Caluin induere personam Christi, Put on the person of Christ, id est. deale in his cause: For, so shall we finde, that, still when Dauid commeth to Imprecation, he was, First, not carried away with an immoderate carnall affection. Secondly, nor handled his owne cause. Thirdly, nor was inflamed with inconsiderate and rash zeale. So iust we doe.
               In the practise of Anathematizing, and Imprecation,What is to be obserued in Imprecation. there must be obserued: First, The person accursing, that he be a man of knowledge, wisedome, and discretion; that so he may wisely vnderstand the condition of the person to be accursed, the spirit that moueth him, the end which he propoundeth to himselfe, and the time when he is to doe or not to doe it. Secondly, The person
                  
                  accursed, that he be such an one of whom (besids that he is a publique, and no priuate enemy) there is no hope of amendment, intractable, incorrigible, yea a professed enemy to God, & all goodnes. Thirdly, The spirit by which he is led. Not of a priuate passion; not led away with carnall affection, but with a single eye, not hating the person, but iudging and misliking the wicked practises of such, by whom God is dishonored: In a word it must be the spirit of Prudence, to distinguish betwixt the curable and the incurable: Of Uprightnesse, to sequester and separate his affections from his owne priuate cause: Of Moderation, to compose the minde to patience meekenesse and toleration. Fourthly, The end which one propoundeth to himselfe, which must not bee the desire of reuenge; but the zeale for Gods glory, which hee seeth to bee trodden downe vnder foote. Fiftly, the time, viz. After For I meane the curse which is vsed to cut off, not to cure. Sometime the Church doth smite with the curse, but yet that the Spirit may be saued in the day of the Lord. Sometime it

Adde to this that the houre of death, is no fit nor seasonable houre to vse Impraecation, though the cause be iust. Christ vpon the Crosse, prayed for his enemies, and Stephen for his persecutors, neyther of them at that time vsed Imprecation.
               To shut vp this point, since now the gift of discerning spirits, which was in the Apostolicall Church, is gone, and men haue their zeale mingled with much choller, stomacke, anger and hatred, therefore it is good: First, to vse only a generall forme of Imprecation contayned in the Scripture, against all incurable enemies, and so leaue the application of it to God, whose hand will find out all those who hate him; and not as the custome of theMentioned by Calum in his Commone in Psal. 109▪ 6.

the Sonne. Secondly, In our mentall application still to pray with a condition, if they be incurable, and these are the Lawes of Imprecation.
               As God depriueth them of the Churches prayers, andObduration. stirreth vp the zeale of his seruants to pray against them: So doth he also giue them vp to hardnesse of heart, in iudgement, hardening their hearts against all meanes of recouery; so that they had rather bee in that estate in which they are, then to come out of it by such meanes: confirming in them that opinion which once was in Naaman.

This is alledged as one mayne cause of that incurable wound, which Satan and his Angels receiued in their fall, viz. The wrath and iudgement of God, who hath thus appointed that they, who doe sinne against the holy Ghost, id est, willingly, doe fall from, and doe oppose the doctrine of the Gospell, should be giuen vp to a Reprobate minde, and barred from all Repentance: So that the peruersenesse of the Deuills will, proceedeth not simply from the Immobility of their Nature; but from the wrath of God, and his iust iudgement, who for that their sinne▪ hath so forsaken them, that, whereas of themselues, they are neuer able to repent, now they neuer shall returne to God, nor euer change their will.
               The same is the case of these men, they hardned their hearts before, and would not heare; now God dothHow God doth harden their hearts. harden their hearts, as he did Pharaohs, that they may not be moued from their opinion: partly by Satan whom he commandeth to tempt, yea to rule in them,

yea, to possesse them with the spirit of madnesse: God neyther strengthening against him, nor any whit weakning the power of Satan; and hence at the length proceedeth that setled purpose in man, neuer to Repent, but obstinately to continue in his malicious persecuting and blaspheming, into which, certainely I beleeue, man could not slip, before this iudiciall act of God hath proceeded thus against him.
               The last, and mayne reason, for the IrremissiblenesseImpanitency. of this sinne, is their wilfull impaenitency which speedily followeth vpon their hardnesse of heart: They cannot, they will not Repent, and this is the chiefe reason. For the Scripture saith not that it is Impossible that they should be forgiuen, for there is mercy store in God, and merit sufficient in Christ to purchase pardon for it, vpon Repentance, but It is impossible that they should be renewed by Repentance, and why impossible? First, they are punished with finall blindnesse, and hardnesse of heart. Secondly, they will not, they refuse it. Thirdly, Repentance is wrought by the Spirit. Fourthly, grounded on the death of Christ, which they cast off: So that it is impossible that euer they should Repent, and, consequently, impossible that they should be forgiuen, but remaine guilty of an

                           •
                        , so readeth the vulgar Latine, in Mar. 3. 29. aeternall sinne, and therefore also must looke for an aeternall punishment.
               If any should obiect the example of Esau, who seemed exceeding paenitent, and shed many teares: Or of Iudas, who as the Text sayth, When he saw what was done repented himselfe. The answere is ready, first, In generall, For that was no true conuersion or repentance, but it was an argument of that anxiety and trouble of mind, which now in their extremitie did presse vpon them, causing them indeed to looke at that which in their securitie they had neglected. Neither indeed did they implore and desire it, but howle and cry for the losse of it, or for the feare of the future punishment. Secondly,

In particular: Esau sought not repentance with teares, he found no place for that: but he sought So readeth the Geneuab Translation, therby helping the vnderstanding of the place: for should the Relatiue 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      it, be referred to Repentance, it vvould seeme harsh, that a man should seeke for Repentance, and that with tears, & yet not obtaine it. Vnles by Repentance in this place, we vnderstād vvith Beza, not the act of Esau sorrowing for his sin, but the act of Isaac, who would not repent him of what he had done, nor alter the blessing giuen to Lu
                           ••
                        . Whether of both these wee take, it skilleth not much: it is certaine that by Repentance is not meant any sorrow of mind in Esau.
                   
                  it, id est, the blessing, a matter of no moment with yelling & howling, to seeke for the blessing without true repentance: Sorry for the losse, not for the cause of the losse: But had he bestowed those teares, those cryings in seeking a place for repentance and sorrow for his sinne, then might he perhaps haue found that that he sought for and desired.
               
                  Iudas also indeed repented, as sayth the Text, id est, did something that a Repenting man would doe, he brought againe his ill gotten goods: but his behauiour, and the event shewed that this was no true repentance. For why did he not ioyne himselfe to the Apostles? Why did he not labour to be reconciled to the Church? Why did he Aug. de Serm. Dom. in Monte. sooner runne of desperation to the rope, and hang himselfe, then of humility to aske pardon? These are no tokens of Repentance, but of an Impaenitent and desperate minde.
               Truth it is indeede, that he confessed his fault, and cleered the Innocency of Christ, and thereby indeed did aggravate his owne sinne: and herein I perswade my selfe he shewed greater signes of Repentance than euer since did any such Apostata: But giue mee leaue to put this Quaere, Whether, there were not some speciall occasion which wrung these words from Iudas? This we know, that as the Lord Iesus was innocent in very deed, so it was fitting that his innocencie should be sufficiently testified. Whence it came that nothing could be proued against him, the witnesses were detected, the accusers agreed not: Pilate perceiued that for enuie the high Priests had deliuered him vp to him, and therefore proclaimed him innocent: Pilates wife also being admonished in a Dreame, did giue the like testimony of him. So that now Iudas onely remained of all them who had an hand in betraying Christ, and on whom a suspition might rest, that hee

knew more by Christ than any of the other, in that hee was his Disciple, and daily conuersant with him, and so might be thought to haue sufficient cause to doe that which hee did: Wherefore to the end that nothing might bee wanting: I take it, as Iudas like Balaam to blesse the people, so he to witnesse this poynt of innocency, rather enforced by the over-ruling prouidence of God, than voluntarily mooved.
               And this seemeth to mee to haue beene the occasion of that fact of Iudas: which seemeth to perswade vs of his Popish repentance, in contrition, confession, and satisfaction. Thus haue you heard the reasons for the second maine point deliuered, which proue it (and I hope sufficiently) both, that it is & euer shal be irremissible; as being a sinne against the Gospell, and against the spirit; being a witting, wilfull, malicious, totall Apostasie: punished, and that iustly, with deprivation of the Churches prayers, with Imprecations, Hardnesse of heart and finall Impaenitencie.

him cast off God the fathers mercy, God the sonnes merit, to trample vnder-foote the Sonne of God, to count the bloud of the new Testament an vnholy thing to set himselfe in hatred against God and all goodnesse? Oh that man should ever in this life come to that estate, that the Church may not pray for him but against him, that he should bee so cauterized, and giuen vp to hardnesse of heart, as to haue no sence nor feeling of his estate, no desire to come out of it. Oh in the name of God, let euery man try and examine himselfe, that so he may find the estate of his owne soule, how neere hee is to this sinne, or how farre off from it. Learne wisedome also to discerne of others, both to admonish those who walke this broad way to destruction, and to take heede of those who haue now already plunged themselues into the same, and to quiet our consciences in the feare of this sinne.
               
                  Quaest. How may it be discerned who are in this sinne, and who not? What markes of it may yet further be assigned?

It shall be lawfull sometime to determine, whether he that falleth, fall desperately, or whether there be any place for recouery: Sed quia rarissime accidit, &c. But in as much as it happeneth very seldome, and God commending the incomprehensible riches of his grace, by his owne example, Luke 6. 36. 
                  biddeth vs to be mercifull▪
                   we ought not rashly to pronounce sentence of condemnation against any one, rather charitie wisheth vs to hope well. To this effect also Beza, 
                  Beza in Annotat. in Ioh. 5. 
                  Quum hoc peccatum magis intus lateat, &c. Since that this sinne doth lye hid within the hearts, rather then appeare outwardly, nothing is so much and so warily to be looked into as to take heede that we rashly fall not to judgement in this case. Heretofore when the gift of discerning spirits was in the Church, this was more easie to be discerned by some speciall Revelation, and yet even then very

seldome, very sparingly. Wherefore now (sayth he) we ought to be much more considerate, condemning the vices, but wisely handling the persons. Marlorate 
                  Sunt igitur tales divino judicio relinqnendi. ibid. will haue such to be altogether left to the judgement of God.
               But here then another Obiection is mooved: viz. How may we then fulfill the Apostles iniunction, in denying them our prayers? If such may not in this life plainely be discerned, then may we still pray for them, and so striue against God, and breake his direct commandement. To this Thomas Naog. Citatus a Morlorato, loco praedicto. some answere, that if we include such a one in our prayers, and so make our prayers, Non debito ordine, not in a due manner, though our charitie may excuse our prayer, that it shall not be sinfull, yet we shall suffer this losse, that we shall neuer be heard for them. As Christ on the crosse prayed for his murtherers, but hee was heard onely for such, who did repent, the rest sinned vnto death.
               But this answere (me thinketh) doth not so fully satisfie the doubt, nor answere this text of S. Iohn, which biddeth vs not to pray for such at all. Neither can I simply allow of that exception, which Si non ores gemas tamen; for

                  Bernard addeth to this Text, If thou maist not pray for him, yet maist thou sigh for him: Happily thy sighes may haue accesse, whether thou darest not send thy prayers. For to what end should any mourne for such a one, vnlesse our sighes, and mourning might either procure him release from his punishment, and so nullifie the iustice of God; or obtaine remission for his sinne, and so falsifie Gods word. For which cause Samuell is greatly reprehended. And I pray what is the sighing and groaning of the heart, but the prayers of the spirit; so that in this it is no great difference whether thou pray with the spirit inwardly, or with an audible voice outwardly, for both wayes prayer is performed. Wherefore farre better is that which Calvin answereth. Si tamen quorundam desperata malitia &

                  If (sayth he) the desperate malice, and wickednesse of any doth so plainely appeare, as if God did with
                  
                  his finger point forth such a one, wee must not striue with the iustice of God, as if wee would bee more mercifull then hee. Which is also confirmed by Beza, vsing almost the same words: Si quem tamen dominus tanquā digito demōstret ad mortem peccare, quid nobis faciendum sit aperte docet. Apostolus. Annot. Bez in 1. Ioh. 5. 
                  But if the Lord shall (as it were) with his finger point forth such an offendor, then this place of Iohn teacheth vs what to doe in such a case, viz. we must not pray for him.
               
               So then the whole answere. I suppose may be thus declared. 1. For matter of Imprecation, we are to obserue all the cautions that were before mentioned, and not suffer our selues to be drawne to that in particular. Neither doe I hold it fitting, even in the vrging of these common Anathema's, mentioned in Scripture, to haue any priuate intention. 2. For praetermitting such in our prayers, this precept might most happily bee obserued, when the gift of discerning spirits was in the Church. 3. Though we cannot obsolutely determine and conclude, that such a one hath sinned thus desperately, yet may we haue sufficient ground for a strong coniecture, which may suffice to cause vs to passe ouer such in our particular prayers, and to leaue them to God. Neither are we to be blamed (though wee should erre in this poynt) since that our end is good, and his sinne deserueth such a punishment, and wee can haue no Faith to pray for him.
               Still the first question, How these may bee discerned doth rest vnsatisfied. To which I answere, that absolutely to determine of such a one is very difficult, neither is there any sufficient marke, but the event, viz. Finall impaenitency: But the grounds of suspition are such as these.
               First, Prophanenesse, which kicketh and spurneth againstThe ground
                        •
                      of strong coniecture. all the workes of the Spirit, all duties of holinesse, no grace, no thanksgiuing, no humiliation, not a good word, but this mans dislike is seene, yea, such a dislike as manifesteth an heart full fraught with malice, choaking and damming vp all passages of Grace, thus plainely doth he professe his cankered heart, and spitefull malice

against the spirit of Grace.
               Secondly, when a man reioyceth not in any one truth reuealed in the Scripture, concerning the saluation of man, but rather doth question it, doubt of it; yea, to his power, doth impugne and resist it.
               Thirdly, enuying the grace and happinesse in which another standeth: It was a bad signe in Kaen, who enuied his brother, because the Lord accepted the Sacrifice of Abel rather than his: But it was a worse signe in Saul, who knowing that Dauid was the man in whom the kingdome should be established, did fret and grudge, murmur and repine against it, labouring by all meanes, to ouerthrow the decree of God. So when men come to that passe, that, hauing receiued in themselues, the seale of Gods curse euerlasting vpon their soules, they cannot endure to heare that any should fare better then they doe, but rather wish that all might with them be damned, it is a shrewde signe of an Apostata.
               Fourthly, Blasphemy against God, whom hee hateth and accuseth as an vniust Iudge, in that the Lord hath giuen him vp to the power and dominion of Sathan.
               Fiftly, want of good affections, when hee neyther loueth good, nor desireth it, but rather continueth in a violent hatred and malice against God, the which also breaketh forth against those who labour his good, his conuersion, his saluation; whom he cannot abide, but hateth and detesteth.
               These are vehement causes of suspition, when a man bewrayeth his malice against the Spirit of Grace, when he impugneth each poynt of the Gospell, when hee professeth an enuying of Grace, and Gods fauour towards any, when he spareth not to blaspheme the God of heauen, when he is altogether destitute of all good affections, it is ten to one this mans case is desperate, and I may iustly leaue such an one to the iudgement of God;

and as to imprecatiō I dare not proceede, because I may fayle in the vnderstanding of his cause: Yet since I cannot haue faith, nor warrant to be heard, I dare not by name recommend his cause, absolutely, in my prayers and supplications.
               On the contrary side, we may more easily obseruePersons in whom this sin is not. in whom this our sinne is not. First, being a generall Apostasie, it is not in those who hold fast the foundation, and reioyce in the knowledge of the truth: Much lesse in those, who labour against corruption; least of all, in those who hold on a constant course in holy exercises. These may be in great offences, but of this they are not guilty.
               Secondly, being a oalicious opposition and persecution of the truth: It is not in those who hunger and thirst after Righteousnesse, not in those who loue any of the good meanes of Saluation: Much lesse in those who doe loue the brethren for the truths sake.
               Thirdly, being voluntary, it is not in them who are afrayde of it; not in those, who albeit, their hearts perhaps are hardened, yet this disposition of their heart doth not please them: Wherefore let this be the comfort of all poore soules, who are vehemently troubled with this feare, lest they haue thus fallen; They may be ouercome by many weakenesses, but yet into this sinne they are not fallen. Yea, hearken to this, all you that are weary and heauie laden, so long as you stand in feare of falling into it, be assured for your comfort, you are far from it: Wherefore let not the Deuill (busie though he be) perswade you, that so you haue offended, for it is but an See Downam his Christian Warfare, part. 1 lib. 3. c.
                   illusion, yea, a stratagem of Satan whereby hee laboureth to make shipwrack of your soules.
               Now to stop our Censure: This is not the sinne of such, who neuer attayned to the knowledg of the Truth; neyther Turkes nor Infidels, neyther Atheists nor Epicures, neyther Pharaoh nor Rabshekah, neyther Herod nor Pylate did or could euer fall into it: A curse

indeede and an heauy one, hath gone out against them, and all like to them; bondslaues are they of Satan, and strangers from the Common wealth of Israell; Aliens from the couenant of Grace, but yet an heauier curse is for those who haue sinned this sinne, and far more miserable is their estate.
               Secondly, Not of all that fall being constrayned through feare in the time of persecution. Thirdly, No not of all that doe persecute the Truth, vnlesse they be found to carry a malicious minde, against, not only man, but God.
               The next vse is for exhortation, to take heede ofVse. 2. falling into this; there is no recouery, it is like the lawes of hell, if once man be slipt downe thither, there is 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   a great gulfe to hinder all passages of returne. Wherefore it is the wisedome of a Christian to to take heede how he traceth in these steps, for the paths thereof are the paths of death.
               
                  Quest. What are the steps and degrees of this descension, by which a man doth decline till hee come to this finall Apostasie?
               
                  Resp. In the answering of this we are to distinguish, for there are two kindes of this Apostasie, or falling away; not much vnlike to the two kindes of Epilepsy, or falling sicknesse, which the Physitians haue obserued: The one, is seated eyther in the brayne, or the heart, and this taketh suddenly, and so suddenly, that wheresoeuer it taketh them it casteth them into the fire, or into the water, bereauing them of all meanes to help themselues: The other beginneth in the externall parts, as in the Armes or Legs, and here by frication it may be stayed, at least wise, some time gayned, that the parties may prouide for their owne security. Euen such is our Apostasy, there is a praecipitation, when a man doth suddenly fall headlong into this sinne, and of this there can be giuen, no signes nor degrees. Of this kinde was the sin of the Angels, who suddenly fell into

this Apostasie, in which they are. There is also a certayne Pedetentim, and leasurely declining, so that from one step to another doth a man descend till he come to the gates of death.
               Neyther is this distinction so newly deuised, but that it hath beene disputed in the Schooles. Aquinas 
                  Aquin. 22. 4. 14. Art. 4. among other questions of this subiect, moueth this. Whether a man may (primo) at the first, fall into this, and sinne against the holy Ghost? He is a Schooleman and his answere is not to seeke; his answere is this. That two wayes may a man sin against the holy Ghost. First, Ex inclinatione habitus. by inclination of habit, & this, he saith, is not incident at the first, for an habit must be acquired & gotten by many, and frequent actions. Secondly, Ex abiectione per contemptum corum per quae homo retra

                     . by a wilfull reiecting of that, by which he might bee kept from sinne; and of this he saith that, howsoeuer it doth most an end praesuppose former sinnes (viz. that men walke in the councēll of the vngodly, and stand in the way of sinners, before they sit downe in the seate of the Scornefull) yet he affirmeth, that it is possible, that at the first a man may thus sinne; and that (saith he) for one or all of these causes. First, for the freedome of his will. Secondly, for many praeceding dispositions. Thirdly, for some great motiue. Fourthly, for the weakenesse of affection to that that is good: Whereupon he inferreth that this hardly or neuer befalleth those who haue attayned to any good perfection, according to the saying of Non arbitr

                     . lib. 3. 
                  Origen, in briefe his answere is this, that against the holy Ghost by finall Impaenitency, man cannot sinne at the first, but to this he commeth, by a long series, and order of precedent sinnes; but by contempt and reiecting of those What these meanes are, is declared pag. 6 meanes of Grace which should keepe men from falling, as also by blaspheming the Spirit of Grace, he may. Wherefore, since we haue reiected his final Impenitency (wherin notwithstanding to the purpose of the minde, though not to the extent of the act, he alloweth a praesentany lapse) not alowing it to be a

species of this sinne, and only doe allow the other two branches, viz. a malicious and contemptuous abnegation of the truth, and reiection of the Sacrifice of Christ (the only effectuall meanes to withdraw vs from sinne) together with the blaspheming of the Spirit of Grace. The conclusion is manifest, that speedily, swiftly, with headlong hast, a man may sinne against the holy Ghost, and fall into a finall Apostasie.
               But herein, I take it, was Aquinas short: A good vvit vnsanctified, is a good pray for the Deuill, saith Green-hā.
                   For men of skill and knowledge. are most incident to it, as who for the most part, are more puffed vp (according to that of the Apostle,c 
                  Knowledg puffeth vp) which is an affection easily throwing man into this sinne; the which
                     c 1 Cor. 8. 1. may further seeme to be confirmed by Aquinas himselfe, who otherwhere, asking the question, whether the first Angell among the lapsed were the first among all, answereth, that it well might be so; for In omni peceato duo sunt, Pronitas & Motivum. Primū est plus in Creatura ignobiliori; sed secundū est plus in nobiliori. Aquin. part. 1. q: 63. Art. 7. saith he, In euery sin, there are two things to be considered, viz. The procliuity, or pronenesse, and the Motiue. The first is more effectuall in a baser creature, the second in a nobler: So then since the motiue, doth more effectually worke vpon any, whose state is nobler, it followeth, that rather are the skilfull, learned, and men of perfection, subiect to this praecipitation, then meaner men. Adde to this, that by how much their vnderstanding is the better informed, so much more free is their will, of a sudden to deliberate what is to be done.
               And if it be safe to instance in particulars, this praecipitation is specially performed by abnegation, and abiuration of the knowne and professed Truth: For, though all abnegation of the truth be not this sinne, nor doth bring it forth; yet, when a man doth deny and forsweare the Truth, that Truth, which heretofore hee hath prosessed, then many times the Lord doth in iustice, giue such an one ouer to hardnesse of heart, and a Reprobate sense: So that hauing fallen from the professing of the Truth, he doth also loose all loue and liking

of it, and neuer aspireth to any loue of the same againe, and who knoweth not, that, howsoeuer the Lord had mercy vpon Peter, yet hee was in the ready way vpon that his abiuration?
               Now for the other kinde of Apostasie, which by steps declineth and from one degree falleth to another giue me leaue to put here a Quare, whether it may not bee thus described?
               First, he looseth his holinesse, and sanctity of life,Degrees of falling. to which he had attayned, viz. Externall: which 2 Pet. 2. 20. 
                  Peter calleth the escaping of the filthinesse of the World, This is the last steppe to which he commeth; and that hee commeth to this, the zeale 2 Kin. 10. 16. of Iehu, the Mar. 6. 20. reuerence of Herod, the Repentance of Ion. 3. 5. 6. Nineueh, the 1 Sam. 28. 3. reformation of Saule, the goodnesse 2 Chro. 24. 2. of king Ioash, doe plainely shew; here he beginneth to fall, loosing this, the which is done by deceitefulnesse of sin, which ouertaketh and beguileth him with profit or pleasure, or by some other meanes.
               Then doth God in Iustice giue him ouer to Sathan to be hardned in heart, that so the meanes of saluation cannot worke vpon him, Sathan hauing this power giuen him, worketh effectually, prompting and insinuating into his heart (as hee did into the heart of Pharaoh) diuers Reasons, why hee should not heare the word, nor feare the threatnings: nor regard the iudgements, tush (saith he) what, haue not the best had their falls? Did not Peter deny his Master? Abraham lie? Dauid commit adultery? And Lot incest? The Righteous, doth he not fall seauen times a day, and yet riseth againe? Was not the repentance of the theef effectuall to his saluation? Knowest thou not that at what time soeuer a sinner doth repent him of his sinne, hee shall surely liue? Thus doth he lull the man asleepe, yea, hee sends him like Ionah to the bottome of the shippe to sleepe, ouerwhelmeth him with security.
               Secondly, Hereupon he becommeth peruerse, and froward,

and backward to goodnesse, growing into a dislike, an hatred against it. Nay, taketh occasion (like Pharaoh vpon the speech of Moses to afflict the Israelites, so he) by the Ministers admonition and reproofe to be more perverse and froward: And Sicut ignis quanto amplius ligna susceperit in majorem flā
                     mam erigitur: sic anima mala quanto magis veritatem audierit, eo amplius in malitiam excitatur. Chrysost. in Math. 22. as the fire by the heaping of wood encreaseth the flame: So this mind encreaseth in wickednesse, by how much the more it heareth the word of truth. Thus Iudas covetous by nature, being reproued by Christ, proceedeth further to betray his Master. If he cannot finger the box of ointment to make money of that, he will sell his Master, and make money of him. Thus hee proceedeth in mischiefe.
               Vpon this God taketh away the joy that he had before: For before this he ioyed in his knowledge, Mat. 13. 20. 
                  receiued the word with ioy. Knowing and beleeuing that happinesse in heauen is the reward of holines on earth. This God taketh away from him, he being vnworthie of it in respect of his vnholy and wicked life: For his conscience telleth him, that hee hath neither part nor portion in it.
               Thirdly, Then doth he willingly cast away the faith which he had, viz. a Temporary one, as appeareth Mat. 13. 21. which includeth an historicall knowledge, with a confused application. This hee doth willingly cast away, neither doth he hold and professe any fundamentall point of the Gospell, because the Scripture hath reuealed it: For when he cannot find the truth of it himselfe, viz. That the precious promises doe bring such ioy and comfort as he heareth deliuered, presently he calleth into question whether there be such or not, yea, and concludeth with the prophane 
                     
                        
                           •
                        eo the tenth. See Balc.
                   Pope, that the Gospell is but Fabula Christs, the tale of Christ. And thereupon counteth the bloud of the new Testament an vnholy thing, meerely deriding and mocking those, who ascribe so much vnto it: and for himselfe is an vtter enemy to the same.
               
                  Hereupon doth God iustly confound his knowledge, darkning his cogitation, blinding his mind, and his vnderstanding, that seeing he would not vse that knowledge that he had, he shall loose much of it, or at least be confounded in it: And indeed how can it bee but that euen his knowledge should much decay, since neyther God blesseth it, nor he vseth meanes to keepe it?
               Fourthly, He doth now voluntarily fall away euen from that ciuill honesty which the light of nature doth teach men: willingly wallowing in all manner of wickednesse and pollution with greedinesse: not without spite and malice, seeking hereby (if it were possible) to be reuenged of God, who hath reiected him, still by his vitious and abhominable life, prouoking him to anger, thus despiting the spirit of grace.
               Whereupon the Lord doth presse his conscience with feare and terror, affecting it with the sensible feeling of Gods heauy wrath vpon his soule: yea, euen setting him forth as a vessell prepared for destruction: causing his soule and conscience to witnesse so much against him, and at certaine times making him to feele most horrible terrors and convulsions.
               Fiftly, Then growes he to impenitency, to fretting, to murmuring and reluctation against God, maliciously opposing himselfe against his Maiesty: yea, hating him whom he can conceiue none otherwise then a righteous judge to condemne him. Hence it commeth, saith
                     o 
                     Calv. cōment. in Heb. 10. 27.

                     mant. malapertly they frett against God: They try indeed all meanes to remoue the sense of Gods anger, but in vaine. For Nam simulas breves illis inducias Deus concessit, mox ad tribunal suum retractos, tormentis, qua maxime fugiunt, eos exagitat, Calv. ibid. 
                  so soone as they haue a little truce, a little ease, presently he troubleth them againe with torments, haling their guiltie consciences before the tribunall seate of his angry iustice. Now at the last doth this man perceiue how fearefull a thing it is to fall into the hands of the liuing God: yet hauing reiected the meanes of grace, cast off Christ, and contemned the sacrifice of his bloud, he hath no power to returne,

but onely breaketh forth into blasphemous, and reuiling speeches against the Almightie.
               Then at the last doth God set the brand of destruction vpon him, taking from him all hope of pardon, and so leauing him to Sathan to be brought home by finall Impaenitencie, and desperation, to finall destruction.
               Thus we see from the beginning to the ending, thereCorrellar. is (as it were) a certaine Reluctation and striuing of the creature against the Creator, seeking still to goe beyond God, and from one point to another, to despite and malice him and his iust proceedings.
               Here I note; That as the praecipitation is performedNote. by the abjuration of the fundamentall points of the Truth, So this other may beginne with other smaller matters, See afterward pag. 57. especially, fornication and prophanenesse, mentioned by Heb▪ 12. 16. 
                  Paul, and so by little and little creepe vpon a man, till it haue possessed him with a totall repugnancie and resisting. And that this description of the declination of an Apostata (which yet I willingly submit to the censure of the iudicious learned) may not seeme altogether to be rather a figment, and a thing deuised, as probable and possible, than indeed any where to be found, or any where exemplified; giue mee leaue I pray to examine the fall of King Saul, in the which me thinketh, I doe cleerely see, both those fiue acts of man falling, and resisting the worke of grace; and also those fiue acts of God, punishing man for his fall.
               1. Saul looseth his holinesse of life. In the beginning of his raigne he had reformed abuses; But now he beginneth to fall away, when by his foolish pitty hee spareth Agag, and the best of the Cattell, contrary to the flat commandement of God.
               Then God giueth him vp to the euill spirit, who worketh vpon him, indeed strangely, but effectually, driving him into many strange and vncot

                  tts, certainly hardning his heart, against all goodnesse.
               2. Now groweth he to be peruerse and froward, yea,

falls into a dislike of all those that were good: persecuteth Dauid causelesse, even Dauid the man whom hee perceiued God had chosen to be the heire of the kingdome: yea, the more that Ionathan doth excuse Dauid, and plead for his innocencie, the more is he enraged.
               God taketh away his ioy, for beside the vexation of the euill spirit, how is he fretted at the safetie of Dauid, he is in continuall feare of him; For, an euill minde, (sayth Mens prava semper in laboribus est quia aut molitur mala, quae inferat, aut metuit ne sibi ab alijs inferantur; et quicquid contra proximos cogitat, hoc contr

What joy therefore can Saul haue, when as Dauid still preuaileth, all Sauls plots will doe no good; Michol saueth him, the Lord defendeth him, Ionathan convayeth him away, excuseth him, the Priests commend him. Thus is he in continuall trouble and trauell; how doth he lay traps for him? yea, in the end neglecting all other businesses of the kingdome, he is wholly bent vpon this, to persecute Dauid, and to kill him.
               3. After his fall we can find not any one act of faith in him, and therefore may well allow him to haue reiected it.
               We see also his knowledge confounded: proofe hereof we haue in his behauiour at those two times that David had him at the advantage, what man (were he not distracted and quite bereft of common reason) would haue proceeded? but he is so blinded by the Deuill, that he cannot see a kindnesse done to him. Thus also according to his grosse ignorance stoth he bid the Witch of Endor, bring him vp Samuell, not considering the state of the Saints after this life, how that Sathan hath no power ouer them at all.

               The punishment of this hath euident confirmation, For how bitterly & sorely did the Lord presse his conscience, especially, when 1 Sam. 28. 5. he saw the host of the Philistims, and at such time as the Lord denyed to answere him eyther by Urim, or by Prophets: as also when Satan in the person of Samuell did reckon vp his faults, and prophecie his destruction. But especially when he was ready to die, cap. 31.

                  Quaest. Yea, but how may it appeare that Saul did renounce Christ, and his Mediation: which was set

downe as the proper Object of this sinne?
               
                  Resp: Indeed this is a materiall poynt, for except we find him fayling in this, we shall doe him wrong. We must therefore obserue that the knowledge of the Messiah was then contained in types and shadowes: and he then that did renounce and oppugne the certaine and vndoubted type of Christ, did also oppose Christ himselfe. Euen as he that receiueth the Sacrament vnworthily, is guiltie of the body and bloud of the Lord Iesus.
                     • When Dauid was exalted to the kingdome, no doubt but the Lord did intend to represent to the Church a liuely Image of Christ, that was to come: And not onely for them to expect the promised seed in that linage, but also to repose all their hope of externall deliuerances in the kingdome of Dauid. For which cause the Psalmist, Psal. 2. Exhorting the Church to the feare of God, and submission to the Lords ordinances, addeth, Kisse the Sonne, &c. As if he had said thus: As you looke for saluation spirituall in Christ, so expect temporall from this familie, which God hath adopted to the kingdome. For the Psalme is literally to be applyed to Dauid, and mistically to Christ. Moreouer, God did make the promise of an euerlasting kingdome to Dauid, that so the faithful might with greater confidence rest vpō Gods promise. Answerable was the practise of the Church. For it is obseruable that through the whole booke of Psalmes, the Church did pray for and expect deliuerance from God in the name of Christ, who was represented to them, in the person of the King, descended from the house of Dauid. Hence it is also that in the Captiuitie, the kingdome being in appearance ouerthrowne, and all things subuerted, Ieremy lamenting the estate of the Church, particularly complaineth, that the kingdome which was the hope of the faithfull was ouerthrowne, Lam. 4 20. The breath of our nostrills, the Anointed of the Lord, was taken in their pits: of whom we said, vnder his shadow wee shall liue among the Heathen: i. e. The King of the posteritie of Dauid was taken away, vnder whose protection and defence, they did hope for safetie. Not in respect of the externall signe, (though many did looke no further) but in the same as a type of the euerlasting kingdome of the Messiah. Last of all, note this, that when the ten Tribes, did rouolt from the house of Dauid, and chose Ieroboam King, they are dealt withall, (Hos. 1.) as with an adulterous woman: The matter is this: God had set vp his King, vpon the holy hill of Zion, that is, establisht the kingdome in the house of Dauid. And had by this meanes, tyed the house of Israell to that family, from the which they might not depart, without manifest reiecting the Ordinance of God. By all which it is manifest that Daud was a type of Christ, and his kingdome a type of Christes kingdome, and the Rejectors and persecutors of him, the persecutors of Christ. Now it is euident, that a 
                  Dauid was a type of Christ, and his kingdome a type of the kingdome of Christ. And the outward saluatio which the people did receiue from

                  Dauid was a type of the spirituall saluation performed by the Messiah. Yea, all the hope of deliuerance, was to be expected, according to the Lords ordinance, from that family. Yea (which is more) the faithfull also did know so much, Lam. 4. 20. Moreouer, it is worth the noting, that after the anoynting of Dauid, Saul of himselfe did obtaine no notable victory: but eyther Dauid was the principall, as in the battell with Goliah: or the sole Agent, as when he was Sauls Captaine: Yea, once in the time of his troubles he saued Keilah, and chased the Philistims. For else Saul fought no battell till the last, which he lost: Indeed it is mentioned that1. Sam. 23. 28 
                  Saul went against the Philistims, at what time he was vpon the poynt to take Dauid, but there is no mention made of Sauls preuailing against them. Further it may seeme that by a common fame and speech of the people, Dauid was accounted the King, from whom the Philistims had heard it, and thereupon reported to Achish,
                  1. Sam. 21. 11. 
                  is not this Dauid the King of the Land? And certainely it is not vnlikely but that the best men did depend vpon him as their King, and therefore when Keilah is in danger, they come to him, not to Saul. Neither was this vnknowne to Saul, who, by his1. Sam. 24. 21 owne confession knew that Dauid should be King, and that the kingdome of Israell should be established in his hand, yea, he prophecieth of his preuailing, and prosperous affaires, and therefore exacteth an oath of Dauid, that he would not destroy his seed after him, nor abolish his name out of his fathers house.
               So that all this being laid together, it is manifest, I hope, that Saul cannot wash his hands of this crime, nor proue himselfe innocent in this fact: but must suffer himselfe to bee ranked with Iudas, Iulian, and other wretched Apostata's.
               The blessed Apostle St. Iames speaking of them, whoTransition. to the naked and destitute of dayly foode, doe sayIam. 2. 16. 
                  Depart in peace, and worme your selues, and fill your bellies, and

yet giue them not those things that are needefull to the body, censureth the coldnesse of their charity, thus, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , What heleth it, what doth it profit? And not vndeseruedly; for what end is there of Gods counsell, if there be no ability of performance? This censure of the Apostle might perhaps bee applied to this mine admonition, to take heede of Apostasie; as if I did exhort men to warme themselues, and fill their bellies; and yet giue them not those things that are needefull to the body, id est, to practise those things which may preserue men from this Recidiuation, and yet prescribe no meanes, set downe no preseruatiues. Wherfore to satisfie the hungry and thirsty soule, in some measure, euen in this point; I now come to the preseruatiues, which, being practised, are effectuall, to preuent this consumption, this disease incurable, For, how soeuer this sinne be of that deadly nature, that like to some violent poyson, it being once receiued, there is no remedy, no helpe against death: Yet there is a Mithridatum, an Antidote, a Preseruatiue; which, if it carefully be obserued and practised, will preserue (as that the body, so this the soule) from being infected with this deadly venome. The ingredients, that serue for this Mithridatum, are many, and to be gathered out of diuerse gardens: But I will content my selfe, only, with the Garden of the sacred Scripture, which is sufficient and contayneth in it many seuerall graue exhortations, like salutiferous hearbs, purposely intended by the holy Ghost, for this confection.
               First, Remember Lots wife, 
                  Luk. 17. 32. the words of our Sauiour to his Apostles, exhorting to perseuerance, the only vertue contrary this our vice, vsing thereto the example of a woman, who hauing, as it were, put her hand to the Plough looked back, and so became vnfit for the kingdome of God, hauing escaped from the filthinesse of Sodom, and now trauelling towards Zoar, a place of safety, looked back, and became a pillar of Salt; and her

example hung vpon records, for a perpetuall warning to all shrinkers throughout all generations (Lots wife) is memorable. First, in her sinne, shee looked back, no doubt (saith Ex verbis Christi colligiinus prauo aliqu
                        •
                      desiderio fuisse

                     tillatam. Calu. Comment. in Gen. 19. 26. 
                  Caluin) being tickled with some euill desire and affection, she did not leaue Sodome willingly. Secondly, In her strange and wonderfull transformation, presently, suddenly was she turned into a pillar of Salt. In respect of both these, remember Lots wife. A great sinne, Recidiuation, Apostasie; A great punishment, present vengeance. Remember the sinne to shun it, Remember the punishment to feare it: Our Sauiour setteth forth the punishment of such as looke back, viz.
                  Luk. 9. 62. 
                  They are vnfit for the kingdome of God. St. Paul something more roundly,Heb. 10. 31. 
                  It is a fearefull thing to fall into the hands of the liuing God. For that ground, which hauing drunke in the rayne that falleth vpon it, beareth nothing but Bryars and Thornes, is reiected, and is nigh vnto cursing, whose end is to be burned. Heb. 6. 8.
               Secondly, Grieue not the holy spirit of God, &c.
                  Eph. 4. 30. as did the Psay 63. 10. Psal. 95. 10. Israelites in the Wildernesse, fourtie yeeres, least the Lord sweare against you also in his wrath, that you shall not enter into his rest. First, The spirit of God is the seale of our Redemption, therefore grieue him not, neyther by neglecting assurance when thou mayst haue it: (To day if ye will heare, harden not your hearts, to day, while it is called to day, heare his voice) nor in wilfull doubting of that assurance recorded in the word. This spirit, which is the seale of our Redemption, is the spirit of God, therefore grieue him not; Of God our Creator, whose glory we are to set forth; Of God our Redeemer, who hath enlarged our feete out of the snares of Satan; Of God the Iudge and auenger of all those who shall vexe his spirit. Thirdly, The spirit of God, is an holy spirit; Holy in his essence; Holy in his operation, therefore grieue him not, neyther by neglecting the duties of holinesse, in hearing the word: For what knowest thou O man, whether euer thou shalt heare it more? And perhaps

thou mightst at that time haue hard that, that might haue done thee good for euer. Not by resisting, or at lest, not listening to the good motions wch the spirit doth put into thine heart, much lesse by wilfull falling into any sin! O take great heede of this, for what knowest thou (wretched man) whether euer thou shalt come out of the same againe? Thou hast not Repentance in thine owne hand; yea, what knowest thou whether this bee not the first steppe that thou steppest on to finall Apostalie.
               Thirdly, Holding faith and a good Conscience, In which1 Tim. 1. 19. words the Apostle doth exhort Timothy to stand manfully against all lets and impediments, and being called to the ministery, to fight a good fight, id est, to bee vigilant and diligent in his office; vigilant, to watch against all enemies; diligent, to expell them: And not without cause doth he thus stirre vp Timothy, for the office of the ministery is a kinde of warfare, in which Sathan, Hereticks, Schismaticks, lewde-liuers, and false brethren doe in hostile manner oppose the Church of God; Against all which, the Ministers, who are the AncientAntesignani & duces, Calu. bearers and Captaines, must oppose themselues. Now that he may the better make resistance, and performe the office of his Ministery with ioy, the Apostle sheweth with what armour it is fit that he should bee furnished, viz. Faith, and a good Conscience. Faith, that is to say, wholsome doctrine, which, cap. 3. 9. he calleth the mistery of Faith, the mistery of godlinesse, that is, the doctrine of the Gospell, which must bee kept in a pure Conscience. And certainely those two are wonderfull requisite in a Minister; Faith, and a good Conscience, nor are they of lesse consequence for euery Christian. I can compare them to nothing so well, as to a precious pearle, and a rich carquenet, both must bee regarded. Faith, the doctrine of the Gospell, the forme of wholsome words; a rich pearle, an incomparable treasure, better than thousands of gold and siluer, wherfore how

much ought we to feare lest it should bee taken from vs? For what is this wholsome doctrine, but like the starre that led the wisemen to Christ, which when they lost, into what by paths were they driuen, and how much trouble ere they found it againe? So here keepe the patterne of wholsome words, and it will guide you in the right way, suffering you to decline neyther to the right hand nor to the left, neyther to suspition nor to prophanenesse, neyther to Schismes and Heresies, nor to Atheisme and Epicurisme. This is the precious pearle. The rich Carquenet is a good Conscience, a pure Conscience; in this must we keepe Faith, else it will bee lost. For whence commeth it that so many continually doe reiect the truth, and fall into wicked sects and damnable heresies, but because they were not carefull to keepe the sound doctrine in a pure Conscience? and therefore God iustly punished their hypocriticall dealing with this iudgement, sending them strong delusions, that they should beleeue lies, who delighted not in the Truth▪ Two fearefull examples doth Paul here alleadge, of two men who casting away the Carquenet, lost also the Pearle; putting away a good Conscience, as concerning Faith, made shipwrack, id est, were quite depriued of it: For (saith Beza) they who keep not a good Conscience doe also by little and little, loose the gift of vnderstanding. Wherefore loe here another excellent meanes to preuent Apostasie, Hold Faith, depart not from it, for whatsoeuer is not of Faith is sinne; keepe a good Conscience vnspotted vndefiled, transgresse not against that, keepe the forme of godlinesse and deny not the power thereof: As we professe to know God, so in workes deny him not; for what is the end of the Commandement, but loue out of a pure heart, and of a good Conscience, and of Faith vnfayned?
               But amongst all the parts of holy Scripture, there is not any one booke, so well furnished with variety of exhortation, tending to stirre men vp to perseuerance,

and to take off reuolting, as the Epistle to the Hebrews, wherein the Author doth hoc agere, in a manner ayme at nothing else, wherefore whatsoeuer prescripts of Phisick I haue else to giue, shall thence be deducted.
                     
                        •
                      Heb. 12. 16.
               
               Fourthly, Let there be no fornicatour, nor Prophane person, &c. The words of Paul, prescribing a caueat to take heede of this our sinne, id est, 
                  Ne

                   neyther in the second table nor in the first, giue way to any grosse sinne, and namely not to these, whereby the Spirit might bee grieued, and by which, that Communion of Saints, that ought to be in the Church, might be violated. Three reasons, I suppose, may be giuen, why Paul instanceth rather in Fornication, for the second Table, than any other sinne. First, Our bodies are the Temples of the holy Ghost, and fornication is a sinne against a mans owne body, by this then, should the habitation of the holy Ghost be defiled, his Temple prophaned, yea, and himselfe driuen forth by our vncleanenesse, and pollution. Secondly, Fornication is a sinne of a pleasing nature, to voluptuous persons, and they who place happinesse in pleasure, doe most easily yeelde to this sin, and hauing once yeelded, it is so clammy, that, like pitch or birdlime, it sticketh and cleaueth to them; and so cleaueth, that it rather brings them to renounce the Gospell, and the doctrine of it, then to giue ouer this filthinesse and vncleanenesse. Thirdly, Fornication found in any member of the Church, is such a sinne, as may not be tolerated in the congregation without manifest danger of infection, so that in necessity the Congregation must proceede to excommunication 
                     1 Cor. 5. in tot
                        •
                     . as Paul prescribeth, by which the party delinquent, is deliuered vp to Sathan, who is ready presently to possesse him with 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . Heb. 12, 15. a roote of bitternesse, against God, his truth, and the professors of it, for these causes I take it, doth hee instance in Fornication, and the like might bee said for prophanenesse: The summe is this; Harbour no sinne wilfully, and by name not this, for it

is a poyson to the Soule, and infection to a Christian profession.
               Fiftly, Keepe the profession of our hope without wauering. 
                  Heb. 10. 23. Another excellent Antidote prescribed by our Apostle, as we haue hope in heauen, and haue beene called to the hope of the Gospell, and thereupon haue professed the same before men, so must wee hold it fast without wauering, not doubting of it, or calling it into question, after that we haue beene perswaded of it: For he that hauing once beleeued the truth of the Gospell, and professed his beleefe, doth afterwards begin to question it, and dispute against it, doth iustly deserue to be giuen vp to a Reprobate sense, that as hee would not hold fast when he had time and opportunity, so now he should for euer loose the hope of happinesse manifested in the Gospell.
               Siztly, Prouoke one another to loue and good workes, 
                  Heb. 10. 24. & Heb. 3. 13. exhorting one another, id est, in season, out of season, publiquely in the Church, priuately from house to house, in all places, at all times be ready to stirre vp one another to constancy and perseuerance, aedifying one another in that most holy Faith. And Ne quis in incredulitatē aut deiectionem incidat, hoc remediū ostendit, vt scilicet fideles exhortentur se mutuo. Marlorat. certainly not without cause doth St. Paul praescribe this as a meanes to preuent Apostasie, for good it must needes bee, both for thee that exhortest, and for him that is exhorted. For him, whilst thou stirrest him vp to walke in the path of godlinesse, for thee whilest thou art carefull to mend thine owne wayes, for him, since thou pullest the more out of his eye; for thee, since thou must also pull out the beame out of thine owne eye: And since this exhortation must bee mutuall, therefore also men must Heb. 13. 22. suffer the word of exhortation patiently, not kicking against the prick, nor spurning with the heele against him that seeketh to reforme them.
               Seuenthly, Forsake not the

                  assembling of our selues together, or as the Geneuah readeth, the fellowship that wee haue among our selues. A third preseruatiue set downe

by Paul in the Heb. 10. 25. same place concerning this our sin, exhorting to obserue the holy assemblies, and neyther of our owne accord forsake them, nor suffer our selues prophanely to be led away from them: The which he exemplifieth, as the manner of some is, to deterre Ad deterrendum pios ne forte quod in alijs damnū est, id sibi patiantur. accidere. Iun, Parall and scare the godly, lest they should suffer that to happen to themselues, which is a dammage and detriment to others. Many in the Church doe (and indeed iustlie) condemne those, who for their offences, are to be separated from the Congregation; whereas in the meane space, they themselues doe more loosely, and at their lust and pleasure, neglect, forsake, yea, and contemne the Church assemblies: They which are frequent in the Communion of Saints, haue a good meanes to keep them from Apostasie; but if they forsake the same, then are they subiect to errors, Schisines and damnable Heresies. It is obserued, that Euah was seduced by the Serpent, when she was out of the company of her husband; and certainely it is manifest, that hence arose the whole generation of Vipers, the brood of Haereticks, which haue beene in all ages, viz. when men, puffed vp with pride of their owne gifts, haue scorned and contemned the fellowshippe of the Church, and so haue runne into singularitie, and thence to Haeresie, and damnable Apostasies. One preseruatiue more, and so I conclude.
               Eightly, Take heed least there be in any of you an euill heart, and vnfaithfull,

                  or an euill heart of infidelitie, wherin to the end that men might take heede of Apostatizing from God, he exhorteth them to see to their heart. Many doe make a faire and glorious profession of the Truth, whereas in the meane space in heart they affect it not, nay, dislike it; Therefore, sayth he, Take heede, and be very circumspect, least any of you carry an heart incredulous, and rebellious against the doctrine of the Gospell, for it must needs be that such a one shall in the end returne to his former vices, and taking port with

Sathan, fall from the liuing God. A good Caueat for hypocrites, who desire not sinceritie, but onely make a faire outward shew, to please the world, They loue the prayse of men more then the prayse of God; Certainly these men are all of them subiect to this sinne, and may as well come to it as Iudas, Iulian, or any of the rest, 
                     Iulian to saue himselfe from the anger of Constantius, shaued himself prosessing a monastick life. Socrat. Hist. li. 3. cap. 1. who indeed to satisfie their own turne, to get applause of the world, to shunne perils and dangers are content with, yea, forward in the profession of Christianitie, when (God knowes) their hearts are not vpright with God, and therefore what maruaile if they goe out from vs and become Apostata's, since they neuer were of vs, id est, of the number of those who hauing sacrificed their hearts to the Lord, dedicate both body and soule to the profession of godlinesse. Moses to the people giueth this same charge, Deut. 4. 9. 
                  Take heed to thy selfe and keepe thy soule diligently, marke that, keepe it, and keepe it diligently. The which Salomon secondeth, a

                     • Prou. 4. 23. 
                  with all diligence. Tremellius readeth, supra omnem observantiam, aboue all manner of keeping, i. e. more diligently then thou wouldest keepe any treasure. And why? Salomons reason is good. For out of it, are the issues of life. All the actions, good or euill proceed from Mat. 12. 35. & 15. 19. the heart. It was prouided by the Law of the twelue c Tables, that all springs and fountaines should be kept
                     • Frontin. lib. 2. free from filthinesse and pollution, least these being corrupted, should fill the land with insection, so is it here. Pauls reason is more effectuall, viz. in departing from the liuing God, id est, least you depart from the liuing God, intimating, that as by faith wee doe come neere to God, and cleaue vnto him, so by our infidelitie we fall from him. So then to conclude, The heart is all in all, therefore heare we so often, My sonne giue me thy heart. Wherefore if any be desirous (as all ought) to shunne this sinne of Apostasie, let him here beginne, it is not the least good helpe, Keepe a good heart; Take heed there be not in any of you an euill heart of infidelitie and vnbeliefe,

for if there bee, it cannot bee, but you will in the end depart from the liuing God. I haue now done, And I suppose, that that censure which Lib. de Arte. Poet. 
                  Horace passeth vpon the tedious Poet, will also passe vpon mee, Tenet occidit

                      legendo. But if the Lacedaemontans thought themselues well excused when they sayd, The Thebani suis injurijs secerunt. vt breviloq

                  Thebans haue beene so tedious in their iniuries, that wee cannot vse our wonted breuitie of speech: I hope the multiplicitie of matter whereof I haue had to speake, will also in part hold me excused? The comfort therefore that Diogenes Synopensis, hauing almost tyred his Auditors in reading a long Oration, (spying at last the blancke paper) gaue them, doe I present to you. Bono animo estote, terram videmus. 
                  The hauen is in kenning, the land within sight. For I am now come to that which I haue still poynted after, viz. the end. Now therefore giue me leaue, like the newly arriued Marchant, to sit downe and count with my selfe what is the summe of all which in this ship I haue ventred. Now I find that the summa totalis commeth to this.
               First, You heard the explanation of the Text, by obseruing the terme vsed, and the number insinuated. Then did I propound the two maine parts of my Discourse, wherein, first, I sought out the sinne what it was, secondly, Searched it, to see why incurable? In the disquisition, hauing found it to bee the sinne against the holy Ghost, wee passed by those sixe kindes reckned by the Schoolemen, and prooved by Argument, both in generall against them all, and in particular against each, that no one of them is that sinne which we sought for. The which at the length was defined to be a generall Apostasie of a man fallen from the knowne Truth, euen to a malicious persecution, and blaspheming of the same; the which words I reduced to three heads, first, The whence, viz. from the knowne truth, The truth of the Gospell, not of the Law. Secondly, The whether, to a malicious persecuting and blaspheming. Thirdly, The motion, a voluntary and vniuersall Apostasie. In searching the deadlinesse of the

wound, I found it to be therefore called a sinne vnto death, because it is irremissible. The which was confirmed by Scripture, and reason. Reason drawne, first, From the Obiect, it being a sinne against the Gospell, and against the spirit. Secondly, From the nature of it, In that it doth wittingly, willingly, maliciously, totally oppugne and resist the meanes of pardon. Thirdly, From the punishment of it, it being depriued of the Churches prayers, and rewarded with Imprecation by men, Hardnesse of heart by God, and Impaenitency by it selfe. The Vse of all was, First, For examination and tryall, where were discouered certaine grounds of suspition, causing a man iustly to be suspected for an Apostata. Secondly, For admonition and exhortation, to take heede of it, where also were described the degrees by which man relapseth into this sinne, and also now lastly some Preseruatiues were prescribed to keepe men from Apostasie and Recidiuation. In all which discourse, might I bee so happie, as to haue neither troubled your patience with things impertinent, nor to haue praetermitted ought that was necessary; Salomon in all his royaltie could not finde more contentment then I in mine endeuours. But if I haue beene too prolixe, impute it to the matter, if too concise, impute it to the time: Howsoeuer, let God be glorified, that man may bee comforted. Now vnto him that is able to keepe vs that we fall not, and to present vs blamelesse before the presence of his glory with ioy: that is, to God onely wise our Sauiour, bee glory, and maiestie, and dominion, and power, both now, and for ever.
            
            Amen.
