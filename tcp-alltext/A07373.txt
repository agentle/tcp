            TO THE BEST VVORthy Reader.
            
               
                  SYR:
            
             (as for any other Nobler titles they are but separable Accidents) if Vertue be not too partially ouerswayed

by Fortune, I haue heere cast into a small Volumne a large summe of Loue. Such a loue as is rather warranted by a dutifull obseruance then any shadow of Complement. I may once open my selfe when either Opinion is without eares, or Suggestion without eyes. Heere you may view and read Vertue personated in moderation:

heere you may know and proue Moderation to be the life of Vertue. Bee a president to your selfe what you should bee; as you are a president to others of what you are. It sufficeth me that I maske in the true simplenesse of a loyall honesty, and there shall no time steale from my remembrance, wherein I will fayle to witnesse the payment of a due

debt of thankfulnesse to one principally great in beeing Nobly stiled in his owne worthinesse.
         
      
      
         
            
            
            
            
               THE Golden Meane.
            
               MEN, as they are all the sons of their Mothers, are all the subiects of misery; borne to liue few dayes in many dangers whose glory (if they were Monarches of their owne desires) may be well

compared to their shadowes in the Sunne; For, as the bodies shadow is at Morning before vs, at Noone beside vs, and at Night behinde vs; so is earthly glory, at Morning or in the prime before vs, in a goodly lustre; at Noone or in the full, besides vs, in a violent heat; at Night or in the wane, behinde vs, in a neglected pitty. The difference is amongst some, that at Noone, or in the Meridian of their greatnes, in stead of hauing their glory beside them, they are beside their glory. But such vndoubtedly,

are rather strangers to the bloud of Vertue, then any way indued with the spirit of perfect Noblenes. But so vnsetled are the grounds of frailties courses, as here is yet not the totall sum of being miserable. If men could as well frame their mindes to their change of fortunes, as their change of misfortunes doth corrupt their mindes, greatnesse would as truely welcome calamitie, as the base doe reioyce in being great. Heereunto not the outward actions of the body, but the inward remper

of the minde must be framed, since the first are but hand-maides to the latter. Euen as one lying in the bed of visitation & death, doth not therefore die because hee is sicke, but because he liues (for the depriuation of life is death, not sicknesse) so the minde of man diuided by the consumption and disease of humor, being touched with affliction, is not therefore miserable because it suffers misery, but because it hath once tasted (and bin lifted vp to) happinesse.
            
               The Golden Meane, so

aunciently commended, is onely there perfectly obserued, where true Wisedome and true Nobilitie are the speciall ornaments of a prepared minde: In which, if those two meet, is figuratiuely included an allusion to the Sea: which, though clouds raine downe into it waters from aboue, and waters send flouds here beneath, yet doth it retayne all, either without Iosse of saltnesse, or any shew of ouerflowing: The minde of a Wise and Noble man is such, that what or how many gusts and tides of

aduersity assault him, they may at all times rather arme, then at any time oppresse him, since his resolution cannot ouerflow with the rudenesse of passion; for that his excellent and refyned temperature will euer retaine the salt of iudgement and moderation; the one prouing a Wise, the other a Noble man.
            In sorrowes or aduersities nothing is so fearefull as feare it selfe; which pashion of weakenesse is so below the heart of vertue, that a minde trained vp in the exercises of honour,

cannot as much as let fall one looke to behold it. If it be inquired what it is, or to what vsefull ende, either of ease or pollicy, it may be imployed? in the first will be found little lesse then a desperate basenesse; in the latter nothing more then an vngrounded desperatenesse. A man in the float of prosperitie to feare that he may fall, argues both the distrust of his owne merite, or the danger of his disposition. A man in the ebbe of his plenty, to feare a worse mischiefe then that of being poore

or despised, argues both his vnworthinesse in procuring, & his impatiencie in bearing his fortune.
            Feare with hope, is the readie witnesse of basenesse: Feare without hope, the proclaimer of folly. And if there can be any miserie superlatiue, or if it were possible that there could be an extreame in measure, it is in the feare of those twaine; yet doubtlesse the heauiest of the two torments is to feare without hope. Either of which, to a minde Noble & vertuous, are so much a stranger, as there

cannot be found an interpretor, who to an honourable resolution can inforce either the construction or vnderstanding thereof For it is as meerely impossible for a great and excellent spirit to conceiue thoughts tending to basenesse, as for the base to apprehend the singular designes belonging to the Noble minded. Soone then it is to be obserued; that the distinction betweene a worthy and a seruile person, must be rather sound out in the qualitie of their mindes, then the command of authority

and complement. In which it is also further to be obserued, that in the composition of their mindes, there is as great and exquisite choise to be made, aswel how as wherein the excellency of such a composition must bee remarked. The seruile weakenes of such, whose education, nature, experience, and wisedome cannot claime any prioritie in desert, is so great, as it onely shewes that it distasteth not calamitie, so long as it is full fed with the happinesse of plenty and ease. In the worthy

and desertful it is nothing s
                  •…
               : for they truely considering the custome and necessitie (as they are men) of feeling change of states, doe euer arme their resolution before it come for calamitie, as when it comes, in it, against calamitie; wherein if the great and vertuous accidentally (not to speake of diuine prouidence) fall, they therein chiefly shewe the vertue of their greatnes, and the greatnes of their vertue, in that they know they then feele no more then at all times they were ordained to beare. Such

referre all accidents of infelicitie, to the incidence of their frailtie; measuring that being Men, they are but the miseries of men that befall them. It was (not to be tedious in examples) a wonderfull noblenesse and constancy in 
                  
                     •…
                  socacius, a chiefe man of Antioch, who standing at the Barre of iudgement, was spoken too by Posaeus the Soueraigne, who said; Seest thou not Isocacius in what plight thou art? ISOCACIVS answered him, I see it (qd. he) and maruell not; for since I am my selfe humane, I am come into an
               
               humane miserie.
            
            Rare and wonderfullwas the courage and temperance of this vnimited Nobleman: and surely, where the minde is conformable to remember it is carryed in a body of Flesh, Discretion is the plotter, and moderation the actor of a notable worke. This worke, as it is to be continued with singular fortitude, so must there a foundation be layde of an especiall wisedome; for he who will climbe to the full height of deserued glory, must ascend by the degrees of

deseruing fore-cast: which fore-cast, is euen the ground-worke or basis of perfect Vertue in extremitie. It behoueth then a Noble and wiseman so to order the frame of his minde, that in what Sunshine of greatnessoeuer he be, he may euer expect a storme to onercloude his eminence. And this is to be done by iudicially examining, what the greatest temporal blessings a pproued by the vulgar opinion, in their owne properties are, and how subiect to monthly, daily, hourely alteration: As what

riches are they (as wealth is vnderstood) whom pouertie and famine may not suddenly follow? what honour is that (as pollitique dignitie is vnderstood) whose power, whose largenesse, whose dependences may not be followed by blemish, by enuy, or by extreame contempt? what Kingdome is that (as commaund and worldly gouernement is vnderstood) to which may not ruine be ordained, depopulation, and mischiefe?
            Prosperitie and aduersitie are not by long times often sundred; for sometimes

is scant an houres difference betweene a Ihrone and a Cottage: whereby all men may know that the condition of euery man is changeable; and the wise may know that whatsocuer may happen to another, may happen to himselfe.
            
            In auncient Records Pompey for wealth, Seianus for honour, Ptolomy for Kingdomes, are memorable: yet was Pompey for all his wealth poore, & begd. Seianus for all his honour disgraced and executed: Ptolomy for all his Kingdoms forgotten & extinguisht. If we would inquire

into our owne moderne Chronicles; we may read of VVoolsey the Cardinall, abounding in riches and abounding in miserie: ROBERT, Earle of ESSEX, propt vp in honours, and cast downe by enuie. Many of the Henries, Kings of much power and small fortune: other our Histories mention, who might as fitly be heere induced, but that those beeing freshest in memorie, and all within the compasse of one age, will sooner stirre vp our hearts, and worke an impressiō in our beliefes, then

others who are with vs of lesse credite, because of more antiquitie.
            Another effectuall consideration to the building of this excellent worke of a resolued and prepared minde, is euen in the foundation to be thought on. For if there be no certaintie in VVealth, in Honour, in Soueraignty (in the fruition of whom, chiefely, if not onely, resteth the Paradice of an earthly Heauen) much lesse assurance may be dream't of in any inferiour pleasures: for which a wiseman (who is the true Nobleman) ought

thus to resolue, that he is not lord of his owne mind who is vndaunted, as long as his fortunes are ministers to his will: but when he is cast downe, or rather cast away in his hopes, vndone in his expectation, set below his owne heart, vnfriended, and the subiect of vncomforting pittie: Hee then who now witnesseth by his moderation in those sadnesses, the courage of his Noblenesse, by the Noblenesse of his VVisedome, is both perfectly wise in being so couragious, and as perfectly couragious in beeing so

noble. It was well said of one, that A calme Sea and a faire VVinde proues not a Sailers skill. A sure Pilot is proued in a doubtfull storme, and a wise noble minde is truely tried in the storme of aduersitie, not in the calme of felicitie. Fortune enuies nothing more then a setled and well gouerned resolution; and such a Marriner deserues remembrance to posteritie, who in Shipwracke dies, imbracing the Maste, rather then hee who faintly for feare of drowning leapes into the Sea.
            
               
Lastly, if neither the respect of the instabilitie of humane endowments, neither the regard of honor, being prone to fall, nor the vnstaidnesse of Kingdomes (the Scepter beeing the highest flight of Ambition) cannot imprint in the minde an abandoning of itselfe, by reputing earthly delights and acquisitions to be in their owne nature, as in their owne nature they are, passable and vncertaine; yet may the surenesse of paying a debt (which cannot be excused) to death, be a mayne and singular motiue to a

noble and wise man, for sufferance of all changes of conditions and estates, with the sweetely-vnited blessings, Iudgement and content. He that remembers that hee liues a life, cannot but forethinke that hee must dye a death: If hee looke into what life it selfe is, hee shall finde (by experience of the past, and proofe of the present age) that it is none other but a iourney to death. If a man examine the scope of his owne desires, they will fall out to be a desiring to hasten to his graue Death and the graue (two tortures

to the memory of worldly foolish men) are the onely principa

                  •…
                of Empyre. So what else doe they but couet by growing elder in dayes, to flye to the full race of their liuing, which is death? Of this a 
                  〈◊〉
                Noble-man should-not; and a true wise man cannot feare. It was an answer (worthy the fpeker,)

of the Philosopher, who hearing of his Sonnes death said: When I had begotten him I well knew hee should dye: and who would be so ignorant as not to confesse that whosoeuer is brought out of the wombe is destined also to the sepulchre of the earth? To a man prepared by the light of the minds vertue, this is euer seeming necessarie, as well willingly to restore that when it is required of him, though it were by death, as to enioy that which is giuen him if it were his life, since one being borne into the one,

cannot escape the other. The Minde should euer keepe measure, what of necessitie it must suffer let it not feare: what is doubtfull that it may suffer, let it alwayes looke for: So shall it not be afflicted before afflictions doe come; nor vnprouided when they are come.
            All men, yea all things, must be freed by an end, though the end bee not a like to all, neither in manner or time; some forgoe their liues in the middle of their time, some in the dawning of their life, some liue till they are euen weary

of liuing, some dying naturally, some violently, others enforcedly, many (in respect of men) casually, but all at some time dying. In this kinde then it is questionable, whether it bee more foolish not to know, or more shamefull not to imbrace nature: Hee that liues well needeth not to feare the vglines of death appearing in any forme, or in any disguise; if he first resolue, that whensoeuer or howsoeuer hee comes, yet it is but death, and it must come.
            Some one that is to

trauaile of necessitie vpon the hazard of his life, vnto Constantinople by land, being vnexperienc't in the dangers, and the many miseries of his ioumey, for his better instructions, seekes comfort in the councel of another, who hath bought knowledge of the way with the price of many weary and distressed paces, and being come, learnes this for an app

               ued certainty, that first the iourney it selfe is long and tedious, the way troublesome and vneuen, the change of ayres infectious and vnhealthy, the desarts

wast and vncomfortable, directions chargeable and vncertaine, here theeues prepared to spoyle, there beasts set all on rauine, surety no where, danger on all hands, and what is the worst of these aduentures; if hee obtaine the scope of his desires, and arriue euen to the furthest of his iourney, yet shall he there finde a Turke that is Emperour, cruell in nature, boundlesse in command, faithlesse of truth, treacherous and full of the bloud of Christians: what comfort resteth to bee hoped for from this afflicted trauailler,

or what should he doe? To goe is the hazard of life, to stay the certainty of death: now the Noblenes of Wisedome must direct, & the Vertue of Noblenesse incourage his resolution, to resolue a steaddines of minde to countermaund the heauinesse of both fortunes: And it behoues such a man, so trauailing, to be prepared, aswell to beare danger when he mee
                  •…
               es with it, as to be instructed before, that there is danger to be met with. In like manner is euery man borne to greatnesse, so likewise borne to

iourney to death. To which ere he come, (death being the furthest home of all our trauailes) wee must know that wee are to passe through the miseries of mortallity, and particularly informe our selues that life it selfe (how short soeuer) in respect of it's frailty, is long and tedious, the manner of liuing troublesome and vneuen, the change of estates infectious to the minde, vnhealthy to the soule, the wildernesse of opinion and iudgement wasted by the cause, and comfortlesse in the effects of folly:

directions to reformation chargeable, if wee respect our ignorance, vncertaine if wee remember our wilfulnesse: Here on the one side are theeues, euen our affections to spoile vs of vertue; there on the other side Beasts, which are defects of reason, set on to deuoure vs; euen our manner of liuing is a baite to allure vs from the surety of life, and when wee are come to the deadly sickenesse that must finish our course, the worst of euill is, that hauing past all the quicksands and perils of life, wee haue within vs

death it selfe in our owne consciences to bring vs to death.
            Nothing is left therefore to a man borne to liue, but a stayed and a sure resolution to be armed to die. In which hee is to care, not where hee shall die, or in what manner, or in what estate, but that hee must die, and in what minde, and in what memorable vertues.
            Heere, the foundation to the erecting the Master-piece of the Golden Meane being layd now vpon these or some other considerations, not much

differing from these; a Noble wise man is then to know his owne worth, wherby calamity may not cast him so downe, as that hee cannot call to minde that hee hath beene once happy; as greatnes might not so lift him vp as that hee should be secure that he could neuer be vnhappie.
            It is much needfull that worthy personages hauing merit to commend their bloud, and birth to make goodly their merit, should in such sort be both knowers and directors of their own vertues,

as neither honorable estimation should so purchase the opinion of vanitie, to be blowne vp with the simplicitie of pride; neither a too low discent to the weakenesse of seruilitie, that they are become the miracles of pittie. He that knowes himselfe, not that he is so much a great man as a good man; knowes likewise it is a labour of as rare desert to preserue Goodnesse, as to finde it; as on the other part, the meerely ambitious rather studie to finde greatnesse, then being found and enioyed to preserue it. Such

principles ingenerall, being by a discerning iudgement cont
                  •…
               iued, the contriuer cannot be far from the parts that leade to this Golden Meane.
            
            It is many times seene that those who leade their liues according to the measure of their will and power, doe not measure their will and power according to the frailtie of their liues; yet certainely they lead an euill life who are still beginning to liue, for that life is euer vnperfect which hath learned but the first onely rule to goodnesse: certaine other,

then chiefly begin to liue when they are certaine to end the race of so liuing by death; and some also there are, who end their liues before they can well be said to haue begunne to liue.
            Most men subiect to those vnhappinesses, like things floating on the water, doe not goe, but are carried; not the counsell of prouidence directs their steps to goe by the staffe of discretion, but they are wholly rather carried by the violent streame of opinion and conceit, precisely termed

Humour. To vnmaske the vizour that hides the deformitie of this customarie vilenesse, much guilt is to be laid on the change of the times, or indeed on the change of men in the times. For, whiles the World was yet in her infancie, neither was such plenty of temptation to inuite, neither was vanity so plentifull to tempt the happinesse of that age to the miseries of this: But as dayes grow more numberles in number, so men in those dayes waxed more irregular in manners: which irregularitie

of manners, increased by the deprauation of reason in men of all conditions; in fooles euer, in the wise often; for euen the wise do themselues, not seldom suffer an eclipse of reason.
            The difference that is, is for that such a defect proceeds rather out of the firmitie of Nature, then out of any subiection of the minde: for, where the minde is subiected to the grossenes of errour, there doth the man so for the time (so subiected) forsake the course of Wisedome, which like a fixed Starre should (how soeuer

the heauens moue) be vnmoueable, and vnmoued in the Center of his place; and such as so is, is truely said to be true Noblenesse, true Vertue, true Wisedome.
            
            Euen as one that is to frame a goodly building on a delightfull plot of ground, doth first prouidently forecast aswell of the hazards and hinderances that may come, as the charge which daily must come. Amongst which must principally be considered, the title of the right, and what claime may belayd thereto, and

what meanes may be vsed to remoue that claime. Then the necessitie of prouision, the casuall change of weather, the wearinesse of working; for all which, if interaccidents of extremity should happen remedies for the same must be thought on. So a man in his minde wisely resolued to the building of this excellent frame of the Golden Meane, on the plot of a prepared resolution, must endeuour to prouide cures against the fates of extremitie. A few of which extremities that doe many times assault the

temper of a Noble vertue, it shall not much differ from the purpose and present to point at.
            With men of Honour and Nobilitie, the chiefe misfortunes that can, or doe vsually, happen, are either Disfauour, Neglect, 
               Sixe Miseries that may befall a Noble man. forfeite of Estate, Banishment, Imprisonment, or Death. The remedies against all which, shall easily in perticular bee subserted.

               esse of body, it is not any defect in Nature, or naturall proportion, but in manners outwardly acted: For many times it is commonly seene, that where Nature hath fail'd in some parts of the outward man, shee hath oftentimes supplyed those wants with a pregnancy of minde.
            A president whereof is (not to borrow of auncient Histories,) euen in the CHRONICLES of our present memories, in the person of ROBERT, the late Earle of SALISBVRY,

                his inuention. And Scorates, that odde man of Athens, is said to haue said of himselfe, that education & Art in him, had changed the course of Natures vnfurnished workmanship.

                  〈◊〉
                is not heere intended, but of such as by their owne selfe-vnworthines in body in minde, & often in both,

doe loose the intrest, their Blood, Birth, and Noblenesse (being noble indeed by those both) hath in their Princes opinion.
            A remedy against self-unworthinesse; must be found out in a selfe-reformation; which being sincerely performed, the follyes of the past times belong not to the reformed.
            If one should call such a one (as hath bin knowne for a notorious robber.) Theefe, being certainely sorrowfull, penitent, and accomptable for all his errours in that kinde, doubtlesse it were much indiscretion

in the Agent to speake so to him, & more in the Patient to esteeme it as spoken of him, since wise and good men as they do not repute those things theirs which they haue not done, so must they neither acknowledge for theirs which they now presently doe not. Non vocamus

                  nostra quae non ipsi fecimus, at quae non ipsi facimus, as the right sence of the olde Verse contayneth.
            So then: Hath a great PEERE loft his Princes fauour, because he deserued to loose it? let not this deiect or caft him downe in

mind, since as by a change from good to worser hee forewent his Princes loue, or rather his Princes louehim; So yet by a change from bad to better, he still is worthy of a repossession of that loue, though hee repossesse it not: And what worth cannot be seen by the publique little eye of the great world, by reason of his being clouded from the Sunne of his life and glory, his Prince; let it bee so much the more seene by the priuate great eye of his own little world (euen himselfe and his owne comforts) and teach

him to know the difference betweene a great and a good man, the one preferring vertue onely for greatnesse, the other preferring greatnesse for the greatnes of vertue onely.
            Another cause, which Enuy the 3. cause of Disfauour. not seldome procureth disfauour from the Prince, is that old enimie to desert Enuy, who is so auncient a Courtier, and so tryed in the passages of all ages, that such a man as is in fauour with his Soueraigne, deseruing so to be, and imagining himselfe to bee without the compasse of Enuy, is too securely, &

in that security, too simply armed against his owne ruine.
            Heere now is a broad path, leading, or more truely teaching the ready course to the excellent meane of Temperance and Moderation. Euery man ought to reioyce and solace himselfe in his owne perfections: for it is as beast-like not to know his proper value at all, as it is diuellish to know it too much. Humble-Pride is a proud humilitie, and such as exercise it with innocence rather then curiositie, doe but shew the difference

betweene a nobly and generous, and a basely fantasticall Nature. Whereby then should a man be perswaded that he is an imbracer of vertue, more then in that hee is prosecuted by the restlesse venome of the enuious.
            Hath this secret mischiefe displaced any desertfull fauorite of the benefite of the fauour royall? assuredly hee hath little cause to distaste it any thing, or to be moued from the commendation of a resolued minde, that as hee shall by tempering his disgrace vvith sufferance,

increase the honor of his merit, so shall hee giue matter still of more enuie to the enuious, who are oftentimes as much afflicted with the patience, as they are with the prosperitie of the party enuied.
            It is better to be enuied then pittied: pitty proceeding out of a cold charitie towards the miserable: enuie out of a corruption of qualitie against the vertuous: If it be obiected that the losse of a Princes fauour, through the instigation of some enuious opposite, hath

most cause to afflict a noble minde, in that his enemie hath preuailed against him; the same reason may be answered with the same reason. That such an enemy cannot be said to preuaile, who fights with the weapons of a dishonourable treachery; and what greater triumph or conquest can a Wise or a Noble man wish to enioy, then to torment his aduersary with the perfections of his vertue? But in the meane time enuy ouerrules? True, and heere is an inducement to a steady moderation, in that it is

but enuy. But the Princes fauour is by this meanes lost? So is a Noble mans selfe-worthinesse by the same meanes found: and it is a greater blemish to the iudgement of a Prince so traduced, not to examine the particulars why he doth reiect a worthy subiect, then to the subiects worthinesse, without particular examinations from his Prince to be reiected. So, neither then should enuy remoue, but for that it is enuy, confirme and strengthen a noble resolution.
            
               
Sometimes the variablenesse 
               The Princes inconstancy, the last cause of Disfauour.
                
               of the Princes inclination, his addiction to change from royall Vertues to horrible Vices, is the reason of his disfavour with those who are of the best desert: Such and of such conditions were ill England, RICHARD the second, in Rome, NERO, in Sicile, DIONISIVS, and such are for the most part all Tyrants, who if they exercise not their 
                  〈◊〉
                ouer the liues, yet certainly exercise it ouer the harts of their faithfullest subiects. Such Princes are rather vvanton in their

fauours then iudicious, and the weakenesse of vertue is the cause of that depriuation of iudgement. How happy is that man who hath lost that grace (with a Prince of that condition) which he may rest confident he neuer surely had?
            And aboue many other motiues, this is most generall and most effectuall to rectifie a wise mans minde, for such a one as layes the foundations of his hopes on the moueable sandes of his Princes fauour, is like a foolish Marchant that aduentures

all his substance in a broken vessell: and hee that relyes on the vnhappinesses of such fauour, must of necessitie banish al Noble resolutions from his dissignes, for it is a headlong folly, and a wilfull detraction that such a one seekes, if he doe not aswell resolue to endeuour to preserue and continue his Princes grace, as to finde and enioy it.
            Now this is a direct, or indeede indirect running away from the maine worke of goodnesse: for to as many vices as the Nature & life of a wicked

man may be inclined, to

a poore man; rich in all plenty, except plenty of riches, to whom Alexander of MACEDON, profferring the Kingdome of Sidon to him, who was beefore but a Gardener, was by him refused, who replyed that hee would take no care to loose that which hee neuer cared to enioy. The Historie is worthy, & the answere full of obseruation, and will bee euer memorable.
            Of all other things, free spirits & wise men should least respect the losse of temporall wealth, which is no part of a man.
            
               
               Riches were fitly by the Philosophers called bona Fortunae, vncertaine endowments; to figure vnto vs, that as fortune is euer variable, so should her benefits bee reputed but vnconstant friends: in regard whereof they were excluded from the gifts as well of the body as of the minde, that is, neither Health, Beautic or vertues of any sort, did neede the ornament of those gifts of Fortune.
            A good man, if of his owne industrie and merit, hee hath purchased vnto himselfe wealth, hath little

reason to grieue at the losse of them, since he remaines still as perfect in the cunning of gayning as when he first began: but another of more aboundance, whose possessions come to him by inheritance, without any care of his owne, he hath no reason at all to distaste the seizure of his estate, since he doth forgo but that which hee neuer laboured for. Truly in respect of this it behoueth euery resolued minde to beare the courage of the wise man of GREECE, that said, he at all times carried all what was his with him

wheresoeuer he went.
            
               Wisedome, Temperance, Valour, Iustice, are the substance and hereditary possessions of a perfectly happy man, and these riches cannot bee forfaited, except by a decay of Vertue, they cannot be seized except the owner cast them off, they cannot suffer contempt so long as they bee nourished in a noble minde. Indeede riches are to a good man like a light silken Cloake vpon his backe, who is else prouided against the extreamitie of colde with warme furres: So hee that hath his owne

goodnesse and resolution to warme him in all winters of aduersitie, needes wealth but as a thinne silken Cloake vpon a furred Gowne, rather to shew the vanitie of his disposition, then any vsefull imployment to the sustenance of life.
            If nature be prouided for against hunger with meate; against frosts with apparell; against contempt with comelinesse, the desire of money or large Lordships, argues but the base filthinesse of an vnsatisfied couetousnesse.
            
               
There may be obiected, that ô my estate being forfeited, mine Heires are beggard, and the antiquitie of my ancestors house made the spectacle of ruine.
            This being admitted, it is soone answered, that the houses of most continuance, and personages of Noblest births account that antiquitie of best estimation which is deriued from the longest discent, in which they shall finde, that the first of their honors were gotten by him, who was in as low an ebbe of fulnesse, as hee is now

at the present: for all greatnes had a beginning, and the beginning of that greatnesse is desert. Am I Noble, let me know that this noblenesse is the least part of mine; for my fathers wonne it by their vertue, they had the glory, but I enioy the Titles. Haue I robd mine Heires of those Titles, Honours, or Possessions? let them striue to haue more honour in deseruing more, that their Successors may asmuch remember their vertues, as I haue remembred the vertues of my Ancestors. Questionlesse

howsoeuer the reputation of a continued Family in ancient Honours, be preferred aboue any men of latter greatnesse, of some whose worth hath raised his house to a noble stile, yet is it in the lawes of reason most reasonable; that hee should deserue more respect, that by his owne atchiuements hath purchased dignitie, then others that onely haue it by the priuiledge of bloud, since the one weares but the shaddowes of his Predecessors triumphes, the other the substance of his owne
            
               
Pouerty is no burthen to them as can susteine it, is no enemy to such as will imbrace it: He is only miserable that knowes not to be content with his Fortune, especially if his fall be procured by his owne errours. Then the surest, the Noblest, the only meanes to redeeme publike calamitie, is by a publike (and yet inward profession of sufferance; for in all persons and personages, reformation of folly is a worke of more praise then the working of folly is a cause of disgrace.
            What misery can it

then be to be eased of that care, which onely brings care in the possession. Of all mischiefes, the greatest mischiefe is to be a rich man, with a rich mans minde. There is no more reason why a meerely couetous man should loue Gold, but for that it is yellow or faire; Pastures, because they are greene; and so hath the enuious much more reason to Co
               
                  •…
               uer abundance of wealth, because other men should want it. A couetous miser, is rightly a malicious consumer, for in heaping for himselfe, he consumes

the maintenance of the needy: yet it is to be noted, that plenty is not alwayes to be dispraised, if the hauing of it doe no
                  •…
                procure a scarcitie. But what losse is so great in a worldly estate (considering how weake it is more then in opinion) which a wise man should not beare with moderation?
            It is a misery to want, but a greater misery to haue too much: but for a good man to hugge the loue of abundance, that he should imagine the losse of it, should make him miserable,

I must conclude this point that he hath neither goodnes nor resolution: if goodnesse, his content should be his best estate; if resolution, his want cannot be esteemed the worst pouertie, since extremity is a singular teacher to learne vs that we are men, and that there is both a diuine power and a prouidence aboue vs; the one consisting in being a God, the other in hauing a God-head.
            The difference between 
                  Of Banishment. a wise man, reformed by counsell and instruction, and an ignorant man, informed

in will and folly, is, that the wife will make good vse of all aduersity, when the ignorant thinks all aduersitie intollerable. This is proued in the greatnes of a Noble courage, when it is enforced to forsake (either vpon publike disgrace, or some priuate causes) the comforts of his friends and Countrie, which men of low hearts) doe account a misery of mischiefes, and reckon that banishment is a bad kinde of torture.
            It may not be denied but that such may be the vnworthinesse of the action

for which a man is banished, that his owne conscience will in all places be a tormentor to his memory, and then the wound which he beares with him can neuer by change of place or time be wholy cured. Such a one, another of this latter times, well compared to the wounded Doe in Virgill, 
               Lipsius. who (as the Poet sayes) fled ouer Hils and Mountaines to escape death, but all in vaine; for still in her sides the Bow-mans killing Arrowe sticks. So, those men who haue the arrow of some mischieuous
               
               art, piercing their afflicted hearts, although they be banished from the place where they haue committed villanie, yet they doe but goe from it, they cannot forget it. They flie the detraction of their sin, but cannot shunne it; or if they could shun the deed (as they cannot) what can that auaile when the doer is the man himselfe?
            In good men, who through diuers misfortunes are sequestred from their natiue Countries vpon wrongfull or sleight occasions it is nothing so: for to them if they rightly

(as beeing good they will) instruct themselues in the first rules of wisedome, all Countreyes are a home. A noble and free resolution is a stranger no where; in which respect men perfectly wise, are said to be perfectly valiant, since as true wisedome is perfect vallour, so is true vallour perfect moderation.
            Many men haue abandoned their Countries, & made themselues voluntary exiles vpon a desire and greedy hope of gaine, or better prosperitie: such haue beene the Romans,

               RAY, Duke of Norffolke, in the Reigne of RICHARD the second, being by the said King, by reason of the Kings youth and indiscretion; and in regard of some other differences between Mowbray and other Princes of the bloud, vpon an appeale of Treason, banished; was so far from being heerewith deiected, that adding practise to the noblenesse of his courage, hee vndertooke a glorious warre in the land

of Palestine, against the common enemie of God and Truth, the Turke, and willingly made his bloud a sacrifice to the redemption of his Fame. Happy man, that sought out death with victorie, before that death could make him vnhappy by finding him out with ouerthrow: Happy banishment, which hath beene the meanes of such a memory, and happy cause of banishment that was the first occasion to such meanes of being memorable.

of Richmond, being for his interest in the Crowne by that monster of men and Kings, RICHARD the third, found (by his euen carriage and vvell tempered moderation) such fauour and loue in the Courts and hearts of forraine Princes, as that being strengthened with their strengths, and encouraged by his owne right and vertue, he not onely returned to challenge but to recouer his owne, and to purge the Land of so intollerable mischiefe as the gouernement

of that cruell vsurper and bloudy King had made it sigh vnder. Happy banishment, in so glorifying that Prince: Happy Prince, in so disposing that banishment: for it is certainely true, that not any accident of misfortune (as the world accounts) but the minde of the patient in suffering, or not suffering, makes it a misery.
            If examples be of any force (as they must be) by the president of former times to instruct the present, then may Pompey for greatnesse, Affricanus for

Counsell, Hanyball for courage, and Ouid for wit, tell vs that banishment doth not alwayes happen to miserable men, except their owne impatiencie worke their owne calamitie.
            In short, a VVise and Noble man, by what hath beene said, may consider what might more haue beene said, to the building in this life this structure of the Golden Meane against the stormes and infelicitie of being a banished man, since a wise man resolued in all trials,

is neuer confined within the limits of place, but vpon all necessary occurrents doth repute himselfe euen in his birth to be the worlds Citizen.
            Heere yet followes Imprisonment; which often happening to men of great place and qualitie, is not thought the least kinde of miserie, which men of such mindes doe with their bodies restraint locke vp and imprison all the best faculties of their reason, forcing Reason to be a slaue to Fortune, and rewarding the excellent

dignitie of the soule, with the corruption of Iudgement and Nature.
            Such a man as is kept within the inforcement of restraint, must imitate that Daedalus whom the auncient Poets faine to haue wings, with which he fled from that inaccessible Castell where he was detained with his son Icarus a prisoner.
            The Morall cannot but giue matter of note and application: lcarus the son betokens or may betoken the incapacitie of mens bodies, and Daedalus the

quickenesse of minde: both which, being the one with the other imprisoned; the one, which is the body, personated in Icarus, for want of moderation falls into the attempt of escape: the other, which is the minde, pattern'd in Dedalus, conquers aduersitie by flying from it in bearing it:

                The GOLDEN MEANE super at ferendo; tryumphs on the rigour of imprisonment by the freedome of a noble minde.
            To a man arm'd in his extremities, often trials are

but as many often praises, and euery triall giues a seuerall crowne of commendation in bearing many troubles with one and the selfe-same resolution.
            If the vse of imprisonment be but onely a little made vse of, it will be found that there is no means vnder the ordinances of Heauen so auaileable for a man to consider the miserie of greatnesse, as the feeling the miserie (so mistermed) of imprisonment.
            
            Men, accompanied with

the imployment of worthy thoughts, are neuer lesse idle then when they are alone, neuer more seriously busied then when they are onely busied (and haue time so to be busied) with remembring that they are men: not that such a remembrance should cast them lower then the consideration of frailtie, but raise them higher then the acting of folly; not to depresse the motions perswading temperance, but to rectifie the perswasions mouing to vertue: Hee is stronger that conquers

his owne passions, then hee that after winning many Countries, becomes a passionate conquerour.
            The life of instruction is reading, and leisure the life of reading, and a retired restraint the life of leisure: which restraint is onely terrible in being called imprisonment. One that for a great some of money would pledge himselfe to liue in a chamber a ye

               Miserable men, and Miserable mankinde that will vndertake such an affliction for bettering of their temporall estates, which being imposed for the bettering of the estate of their reason and iudgment, they account insufferable. Basenesse of Nature that suffers that for greedinesse, which being had, is not certaine one houre to be possessed, and yet will in the same kinde forgoe that which being

once possest is neuer lost; O the furniture of the minde, vvhich being indeede the true lasting and onely best Riches! variety of bookes are sweet companions, and plenty of noble thoughts happy recreations: If I be a prisoner I will either talke with my Library, or sport with my thoughts, since one being learned, will proue sure instructers, the latter being Noble, vvorthy delights.

            It is certaine that such

as see their friends in bondage and in durance, who haue Noble mindes, see them, and see them not: they see them as men, but not as they are more then men.
            
               Imprisonment is an excellent preparation to goodnesse, since euer after, in all fortunes, a man that hath beene a prisoner may knovv by himselfe hovv subiect a humane estate is to the brittlenesse of alteration; and he that doth not much amend his errors by this kinde of triall, is neither destined to

be an attemptor of any notable vertue, or a desire of any vertuous note. It is a milde Tutor, to teach as vvell how to gouerne as how to serue; for he who can serue aduersitie with meekenesse, can guide prosperitie with discretion.
            Hee who is a prisoner, hath herein great cause to finde his friend, for such as are ingaged in a promise of loue, that loues not the person for his fortune, will shew likewise that they feare not his misfortune, because they loue his person. The saying

is old, and verified in this age of the VVorld, that a man may haue many friends and yet little friendship: but here a man shall soone be taught to distinguish the difference betvveene friendship and friends, although it is not to be vrged that therefore it is fit that euery one who vvould know truely his friends, should make himselfe, or bee made a prisoner; but that euery one beeing a prisoner should then haue fit time to know how hee is esteemed.
            
               Imprisonment is not of

such vertue in it selfe that men should seeke to be prisoners, thereby to be happy, but being by casualtie enforced vpon any, the vse thereof may be so happy, that hee who is imprisoned may not think himselfe miserable.
            Euen as hee who being followed by the memory of some euill act, though he haue his body at libertie, yet is still imprisoned in the guilt of his 
                  〈◊〉
                So hee that reformeth the crookednesse of his condition, by the imitation of goodness, though his body

be imprisoned, hath by the selfe-same reason the freedome of the minde.
            
               Imprisonment is a gentle sickenesse, not to kill, but to chasten the patient: and as men naturally proud may be humbled, but will neuer be humble, so men of a meeke condition may be launced for the recouery of health, but not wounded to the hastening of death: which a Wise and Noble man, well fore-casting, may arme himselfe against reputed miseries, and amongst them all, against

this one of imprisonment, that whensoeuer it should come to him, it should come to him rather to exercise then to ouerthrow him.
            Finally, amongst such Of Death. men, whose reason is ouerswayed by nature, Death is reckoned for a misery, and is to them a misery indeed, but to others guided by the refined light of Iudgement: it is esteemed (as it is) the onely remedie and securest ease against misery.
            
               Death to a wiseman cannot come vnlooked for,

nor to a good man vnwisht for: since the wise, knowing that they must die, know likewise that resolution is the best comfort to welcome death, and the good being confident of their owne innocencies, desire the change of a better life.
            He that will ouercome affliction by sufferance, beare calamitie with courage, weary out feare with hope, let him be resolute, that the worst of trials is death; and for that be armed whensoeuer it shall come, and be ready to

imbrace it.
            If a Noble or a Wise man after disfauour of his Prince, neglect of his Countrey, forfeiture of his Estate, banishment from his Friends, imprisonment of his Person, or any other esteemed extreames bee threatned, with the losse of his head, or execution in any manner, certainely hee hath great cause to reioyce; for he is not worthy to see any end of his sorrowes, who is not prepared to meet it with a merry heart.
            The end of all sorrowes

is Death, if the party to die be truely reconciled to his God and to his conscience.
            The old Poets did fitly faine Death to be the childe of the Night, and Sleepe to be the Sister of Death; wisely including, that as Night and Sleepe wrap vp all in stilnesse, so should Death more perfectly finish the course of euils, by burying them in a graue, neuer to arise.
            And no doubt, but heerein Death and Night haue much affinitie, that as the Night is fearefull,

because darke; but sweet, because giuing rest: So is Death in his shaddowe (which is the night of opinion) before it, comes full of horrour, but in substance (which is the quickening to a better life) when it comes, full of ioyes.
            It may be here obiected, that to die for some supposed offence by an enforced death, is scandalous, and therefore miserable.
            But it may be answered, that such an obiection betokens but the feare of

frailty. For if it be examined, we must consesse that the houre of death

former, knowing the minute in which they are to depart from the World, doe by the stroake of Iustice enioy that benefit which wise and good men doe in mercy sigh and hope for.
            
               Death is a happy Hauen, and men shipwrackt in the Sea of this earth cannot but couet it: It is a safe Inne, and men poasting in the iourneyes of wearinesse, cannot but seeke it: It is a path to blessednesse, and such as are good will finde it: It is a banquet of all goodnes,

and such as be blessed haue found it.

To conclude (for something hath beene said of this before) he which will wisely and nobly practise the obseruation of the Golden Meane, and shew the greatnesse of Vertue in extreames, must keepe truce with his passions, & prepare his courage with this resolution, that Misery is no Misery; for that is onely a misery which is lasting, and thought so: and reputed misery is not lasting, because death out vveares it; is not thought so because death vvill finish it: in the resoluing

on the one Wisedome will proue a Noble minde, in the other Noblenesse will patterne out a wiseman: for moderation in extreames make perfect both.
            In the view of vvhat hath beene said, vnder the titles of a wise and a Noble man, are comprehended all men, of all degrees and fortunes, whose Vertues doe make them wise; as their wisedome doth make them Noble. For vvisedome consisteth not onely in gray heads, but in a

steady prouidence hovv to doe, and Noblenesse consisteth not onely in an Honorable race; but in a prudent resolution what to doe. Wisedome informes the minde, and NOBLENESSE commends the actions; in somuch as euery one who can act wisely, and deliberate Nobly, squaring his resolution to resolue steaddinesse in both fortunes, may of merrit be inrolled amongst the memorable: and bee remembred by the desertfull to bee truely wise

because Noble: to bee perfectly Noble because wise.
            FINIS.
