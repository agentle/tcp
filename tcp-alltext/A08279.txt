               Right Honorable;
            
            
               I Am bolde
to present
vnto you,
and vnder
your Honourable

these vntimely and green

which I gained in (and
without 
                  〈◊〉
                of)
his Maiesties seruice,
wherein I haue been employed▪
fearing yet lest
my forwardnesse in attempting,
and especially
in publishing a matter so
farre aboue the course of
my ordinarie calling,
should deseruedly purchase
vnto my selfe condigne
reproofe. For that
it may be right well obiected,
That it had better
besitted mee to haue retained
my selfe within

                of, and to haue

(with more diligence)
imploied myself vnto, the
purport of my ordinarie
Commission. And so I
doe acknowledge, had I
beene negligent in performing
the last. And I
acknowledge it commendable,
and a sufficient discharge
for a man of whatsoeuer
profession, sincerely
to performe the same,
without thrusting his sickle
into another mans
haruest▪ But no man is
ignorant that there is a
two-fold calling in euerie
Christian; a corporal and
a spirituall: and they differ
in themselues as darknesse

& light: the effects
of the first are visible, of
the second hidden, as
touching the internal and
mentall working; the
outward actions cōmon
to both. But our Sauiour
faith, Man liueth not
by bread, that is, by corporall
meanes onely, but
by a kind of spirituall norishment.
For the life
that dependeth vpon the
creatures, is alike commō
to men and beasts: The
spirituall life onely proper
to the children of
God; who yet partake of
the corporall bread in no
other outward manner

then doe they that know
not God. Christ had meat
to eate that his Disciples
knew not of; so haue
Gods children a nourishment
that carnall men
know not of, and some other
labors and endeuors
wherof the world taketh
little or no knowledge.
The outward mysterie,
function, or calling, doth
neither discouer, nor can
they hinder this heauenly
food, be their calling
neuer so super-eminent:
neither pleasure, nor profite,
nor wearinesse of bodie,
can hinder or preuent
the holy meditations of

well affected spirit. Carnall
men feed onely vpon
the seeming good they enioy
in this life: Pleasure
and Profit; al their endeuours
tend to these, or to
one of them. They know
no better, and therefore
seek these as best & principall
                  •

               . And
what euery man affecteth
most is his summum
borum. But they onely
are happy, of what ranke
soeuer, who haue learned
to obserue, and do truely
follow the counsaile of
the Apostle, Not to repose

too much confidence in
worldly meanes: for, Bodily
exercise (which includeth
all carnall appetite) profiteth
little, but Godlinesse is
profitable to all things, hauing
the promise of this
life, and of that which is to
come. God
                     •
                  inesse consisteth
of spirituall exercise,
not altogether in outward
labour: though the
second bee sanctified by
the first; and without the
first there is no blessing

end I was bolde to borrow
some oportunities of
my other employments;
which I recompenced
with the more serious diligence,
when occasion
required my retire vnto
mine enioyned seruices.
And hauing thus rudely
heaped together stubble
and straw for the building
vp of mine owne meditatiōs,
touching the sweetnesse
& necessitie of praier,
for mine owne priuat

same to some of my learned

of the thing it affecteth.
When thou therefore lookest

weake Treatise, and findest
it to tend to a Motiue to

cast it by if thou bee truely
affected to that most diuine
exercise, but couet to

How wee ought to approach
before God in prayer: to
depend on God, not on carnall
meanes, though some
depend more on the last
then on the first.
               
                  Chap. IV.
The faithfull mans God is the
only liuing God, and in
him is his chiefe good: the
carnall men haue manie
gods: the ends of both.
               
                  Chap. V.
The world is inconstant: the
difference betweene diuine
and carnall wisdome,
betweene the seeming deuotion

to apprehend the mysterie of

to discourse thereof.

Naturall Fathers, cannot beget
children good or euill of
their owne wils. But they
that are begotten a new of
God, are only good and like
vnto God, before whom the
vnregenerate, howsoeuer
seeming holy, are hipocrites.
               
                  Chap. VIII.
Carnall wisedome hath not
cheife place of counsell, in
the regenerate man: hee
depends on God, and not on
the meanes in any enterprise.

It is a dangerous thing to pray

we cannot pray aright: and

The neglect of the communicating
with God in Prayer, is
the cause that many runne
headlong to their owne ruine,
seeking what they need
in a wrong course, not feeling
their owne spirituall
wants.

Euery faithfull Christian findeth
comfort in prayer, the
neglect whereof admits manie
euils.
               
                  Chap. XIIII.
The most happiest men in the
World are they that most
often communicate with
God in Prayer: and not
the most glorious worldly

remaineth for the godly.
               
                  Chap. XV.
True contentment not gotten by
nature but by grace, which
produceth prayer the only
meane to obtaine all good.

God being wisedome it selfe,

Three principall motiues to

The force of faith what it is,
and the effects of it: & how
dangerous a thing it is to
faint.
               
                  Chap. XIX.
Some among many preuaile by
their faithfull prayers for
the rest. And how God turneth
the prayers of his to
the best, though hee grant
not what they desire: And
how foolishly carnall men
reason against Gods prouidence.
               
                  
                  Chap. XX.
The naturall man misconceiueth
of true happinesse,
whereby hee runneth into
manie absurdities by the
suggestion of Sathan.
               
                  Chap. XXI.
Englands manie blessings and
deliueries, are not so duly
considered nor so thankfully
imbraced as they ought, being
too much ascribed to
humane and carnal meanes
which breedeth ingratitude
and securitie.
               
                  Chap. XXII.
The Church of Christ militant
and Sathans Church
malignant, seeke the ouerthrow
one of the other, but

that all Christians are to
pray for the defence of the
first: without which it is to

bee feared it may suffer violence.
               
                  Chap. XXIII.
The death of the late Prince
is not lightly to be forgotten.
Nor our generall praiers

and the pleasures of this
life.
               
                  Chap. XXVI.
If Gods word cannot awake vs,
he will send his rod to correct
vs, and nothing can appease
him, but our humiliation
and prayer, and not the
glorie of our vaine glorious
pride.
               
                  Chap. XXVII.
The bringing in of true religion
was of great difficultie, effected
by God, by his instruments.
Wee must bee warie
lest wee neglect it, and so
loose it againe.
               
                  Chap. XXVIII.
God loueth vs not more then
the Turkes and Pagans, if
wee liue like Turkes and
Pagans. Our manifold
Idoll-Gods. The Carnall
mans Sophistrie. The long

vse of the word hath made
vs much weary of the word.
Nothing can preuent danger
but repentāce & praier.
               
                  Chap. XXIX.
We ought to pray aswell for our
neighbors as for our selues:
the vse of prayer is twofold,
publique and priuate. Meditation
inkindleth prayer.
               
                  Chap. XXX.
How, when, and where priuate
prayers are to be made. An
erronious conceit of priuate
prayer. What sweetnesse
priuate prayer brings
to the soule.
               
                  Chap. XXXI.
The helpes and hinderances of
prayer: how Sathan striueth
to hinder prayer. For nothing
woundeth him as
faithfull prayer in the name
of Christ. Wee must bee

watchfull and strong to resist
him.
               
                  Chap. XXXII.
The presence of God himselfe
is promised in publike praier:
how he is present, which
the carnall man apprehendeth
not: the discontinuance
of prayer, publique or
priuat, dangerous.
               
                  Chap. XXXIII.
Priuat prayer in som respects
& at som times more comfortable
to a priuate man
then publique. The neglect
of publique praier in priuat
families condemned: for
where God is not, there Sathan
is serued.
               
                  Chap. XXXIIII.
The true vse of the Lords

Prayer, about which friuolous
questions haue risen. It
is the rule of all other prayers,
and euery petition ful of
high matter of instruction.
               
                  Chap. XXXV.
The summe of the lords prayer
briefly explained.
               
                  Chap. XXXVI.
Praier much increaseth diuine
knowledge, whereby men of
meane carnall learning
exceede many literate Doctors.
               
                  Chap. XXXVII.
Although no man by nature

knoweth how to pray, none is
to despaire: for the word
heard, and prayer vsed, teacheth
it, and increaseth the
knowledge of it.

               The neglect of prayer. Prayer
in an vnknowen language.
Praier without cordial deuotion
condemned with a
comparison between spiritual,
and bare verbal prayer.
               
                  OF all the neglects
of mens
spiritual duties
vnder the Sun.The neglect of true prayer, much to be condemned.
none is more to be condemmed
then the little regard

of, and the small delight
men haue in, diuine
prayer: And yet an excercise
of that comfort to the
conscience, and so profitable
to soule and body, as it
passeth in sweetnesse all other
exercises, pleasures
and delights of the minde,
as farre as Gold excelleth
durt, and the most valuable
pretious Iewel the dung of
the field. The Sunne excelleth
not in brightnesse the
blackest and darkest night,
as doth true, faithfull, and
cordial praier, truly performed,
exceed the best contentments,
that proceede
from earthly and carnal delights.
Faithfull prayer,
truly performed, is al things
to the faithfully-praying.
It is the sweetest and most

valuable Iewell that the
most godly heart can possesse.
It worketh assurance
to obtain euery good thing
and to preuent euery euill.
It giueth peace to the conscience,
and vndergoeth all
crosses with sweetest alacrity.
It is as a preuayling
watch-man, that doth not
onely discouer, but preuenteth,
or causeth a man patiently
to vndergoe all afflictions
incident to the faithfull
man. And yet an exercise
as farre vnknowen to
many, euen to such as pretend
to be very deuout, as
is one mans thought vnknowen
to another. Many
boast of their quotidian set
deuotions, as the Pharisie
did, and yet pray neither in
the spirit, nor with vnderstanding:

but of a kinde of
prepensed custome,1. Cor. 14. 15. Prayer in an vnknowne tongue, not onely not auayl-able but sinfull. Mat. 6. 7. vsing
onely the Lords Prayer, the
Beliefe, and the Salutation
of the blessed Virgin, and otherset
prayers, in an vnknowen
language, with so
many superfluous iterations
and needlesse repetitions,Needlesse humblenesse.
as the heart (busied
with retayning the number
of the prayers) seldome or
neuer apprehendeth what
the mouth vttereth; neither
truly vnderstand they what
they speake, praying in a
language they know not:
And so turne their deuotions
into sinne, being made
without vnderstanding, and
consequently, not of faith.
Moreouer they vse in their
prayers, a kind of humblenesse,
which God requireth

not, superstitiosly pretending,
the auoyding of presumption,
in going immediately
to God: and therefore
they came to God in
the name of strange mediatours;
namely to the blessed
Virgin, to Angels, and
to Saints departed, prying
them by their merits to intercede
for them to Christ
that he may pray to his father
for them. What a needlesse
circumstance is this?
Hath not Christ our Sauior
louingly willed vs to come
immediatly and freely to
him, who is the sole and
onely mediatour vnto God
our heauenly Father for all,
that faithfully and immediatly
come vnto him? There
is none, in and by whom we
can be saued, releiued or

defended, but in and by the
man Christ Iesus. He willeth
vs not to vse that kind
of humblenesse, which
should imply pride or any
breach of promise in himselfe:
as it followes if wee
think it too much presumption
to come immediatly to
him, but first to goe and
to pray vnto his blessed
Mother Angel or Saints, as
if he himself were of the cō
                  ceit
and humour of earthly
Princes. It is far from him:
his children may freely
come to him: he disdayneth
them not for their basenes,
and therefore desireth not
to bee sued vnto by more
glorious persons, whom
they pretend he loueth better.
But this doth argue
that we thinke, He will not

bee as good as his wrod
where he saies: Come vnto
me all yee that are heauy laden
and I will refresh you?
Which is to make God a
Iyer, and Christ to haue died
in vaine. Hee saith not
come to me by the meanes
of my blessed Mother, holy
Saints or Angels. And therfore
this is but a forged
humblenesse and a falselie
coyned meane to come to
Christ: but faith onely is the
meane to assure vs, that hee
is our onely Aduocate to
the father, to whom wee
come by Christ only and alone.
That praier, that men
make to God, in the name
of any besides Christ, is not
only no prayer, but a meere
derogation of the principal
part of his office, of being

our only Mediatour. Moreouer
to goe to any besides
Christ, argueth a doubt that
either he cannot, or wil not
be as good as his promise,
where he saith,Zeale without knowledge. 
                  Whatsoeuer
ye aske my father in my name
shall be giuen you. These
kinds of prayers are grounded
vpon a zeale without
knowledge, and consequently
without faith, and
so become sinne vnto them
that thus superstitiously
pray. And I can not but
confesse also, that the most
religious praiers that godliest
men haue made; nay,
the very praier, that Christ
himselfe hath taught vs, although
most hard in it selfe;
may become vnprofitable
vnto them by proceeding
from an vnbeleeuing, vnfeeling,
or vnreformed

heart, or proceeding onely
from the lippes, passing
from the mouth into the
Ayre, and vanishing with
the soud. Such prayers; as
they proceede from vnbeleeuing
hearts, are like vnto
Cayns offering; howsoeuer
foolishly accounted deuotion:
these are but the sacrifices
of fooles: who would
be seene to offer acceptable
incensce: and behold
hypocrisie! they would
seeme to glorifie God; and
behold blasphemy!
               There is a kinde of prayer
which God requireth
and accepteth:The prayer which God accepteth. and is onely
proper to the truly godlie.
And that is made somtimes
in words, sometimes
by sighes, and groanes;
which cannot be expressed

and sometimes in silence
without vttering any sound
yet all very auailable with
God, who seeing and serching
the heart knoweth what
we inwardly desire, and
seeth wherof we haue need.
And these secret and silent
prayers, proceeding from a
faithfull heart, are far more
effectuall, then the verball
praiers which the vnbeleeuer
may vse, with the like
words, as the godly do▪ and
to the same seeming ends.
And yet the same prayer is
not to them both the selfe
same praier: the one hauing
but the shadow, the other
the substance: the one praying
but with the lippes, the
heart estranged; the other
with the spirit, and vnderstanding.
Therefore is the

one of no force, and the other
truly effectuall. These
two kindes of prayers, may
be resembled vnto two pieces
of Ordnance: whereof
the one is charged with
powder onely; The other
with powder and a bullet;
Eyther of them takes fire a
like: and that which hath no
bullet, giues as great an outward,
and audible report,
as the other; But the first
batters not, as doth the second,
although they seeme
to ayme both at one mark.
So hee that hath not vnderstanding
and faith, may
haue the like fire of necessity,
to enkindle the powder
of desire, but can neuer perse
the cloudes, the throne of
grace, with the bullet of
liuely faith: though the

tongue thunder out as loud
and clamorous acclamations
as the other: yet the other
carries with it both
powder and bullet, both
voice of the tongue, and deuotion
of the heart, powerfully
to worke the intended
effect with God. And the
force of the other perisheth
with the sound.
            
            
               CHAP. II.
               It is vaine to vse many words
in Prayer without spirituall
feeling, and great arrogancy
to presse into the presence
of God without premeditation,
with a definition
of prayer.
               HE that duly, and with
true vnder-standing,
considereth the force and

effect of faithfull prayer,
and how vaine and vnprofitable
it is, to powre forth a
multitude of words, without
spirituall feeling of his
owne necessities; As the
causes mouing him to pray,
the matter wherefore hee
praieth, the parties to whom
and in whom hee prayeth,
and with what zeale and affection
he praieth without
                     •
                  
consideration of these hee
may feare to presse into
Gods presence, presuming
without premeditation, deliberation
& holy preparation,
to approch the maiesty
of God. Wee shame
to approch a King or great
personage, without recounting
before hand how to
behaue our selues, as touching
our gestures; and how

to place our speech to be
seene formall in all the circumstances
of our behauiour,
fearing least we should
be obserued vnciuill, rash,
or defectiue in our cariage.
How dare wee then thrust
our selues abruptly into the
presence of the King of kings
without diuine preparation
                     •
                  
Our words and gestures
must be agreeable to a holy
and sanctified affection; our
hearts must be humble, otherwise
wee cannot come
as petitioners, but rather as
insolent and proud vsurpers
although our words seeme
neuer so milde. For if the
heartfrom whence ought to
proceed our requests, be not
truely humbled, and rightly
qualified; God will neuer
haue respect vnto our prayers.

And therefore if wee
duly consider;The deffinition of prayer. That, Prayer
is an humble request made
vnto God, in Christ, with the
liuely and feeling affection of
the heart, faithfully beleeuing
to receiue what we religiously
desire: we cannot but blush
to come vnto God as the
Pharisie did, arrogating vnto
our selues such perfection
as if God were rather beholden
to vs for our fasting,
tything, almes, and prayer,
then that wee needed to
bow our hearts in humblenesse
before his maiesty crauing
pardō for our sin: when
we pray therefore, we must
leaue behind vs all presumption
and conceit of self-merit:
And in al humility aske,
beleeuing to receiue: otherwise
our praier wll become

vnprofitable in not obtayning,
and sinfull in not beleeuing.
And therefore the
Prophet Esay, forewarneth
vs to take heede that wee
come not neere vnto God
with our lippes, namely to
vse many and good words,
and yet our hearts, wherein
consisteth the force or frailty
of fai
                     •
                  h and prayer, be far
from him.
            
            
               CHAP. III.
               How we ought to approch before
God in praier, depending
on Gods promises,
and not on carnall means:
which howsoeuer the vnfaithful
respect not, yet are
the godly moued thereby.
               THat praier is not true
prayer, which is not

grounded vpon a liuely
faith, in the promises of God
in Christ. It is promised to
all beleeuers, that if they
aske, they shall receiue, yet
for the merits, & in the mediation
of Christ; in whom
if we beleeue not, wee may
seeme to send forth as many
sighes, and poure forth as
many verball prayers, and
appeare in our gestures outwardly
as deuout and zealous
as any man, and yet be
as farre from being heard,
and come as farre short of
obtayning what we desire,
as he that praieth not at all:
the very Publican will preuent
vs.
               If we had not the promise
of obtaining for our faithfully
asking; what would
become of Faith & Prayer?

If we rested as doubtfull, &
vncertain to receiue our requests
at the hands of God,
as many a poore begger is
that asketh almes of mortal
men, in his Name; should
we not passe by more houres
in a day, more dayes in a
weeke, nay, many weekes
in a yeare, & neuer remember
our duties of beleeuing
and praier? For it seemeth
(notwithstanding the promise)
by our generall slacknesse
in praier, that we hardly
beleeue Christ vpon his
promise, nor God vpon his
oath. For as long as the
carnall man hath worldly
meanes to supply his wants,How the carnal man commeth vnto God, and how, and when he prayeth.
or to free him from danger,
he will hardly seeke God by
praier for earthly things, because
hee feeles no present

neede of them; nor for spirituall,
because he is a stranger
vnto them. Many seeme
as miserable of offring praiers
to God, as they are of giuing
him of their goods in
his members. But as they
keepe their goods to the
time of necessitie: so their
praiers they wil spend none,
but vpon meere extremitie.
Pharoh neuerentreated Moses
to pray for him, as long
as he felt not some plague:
but when the extreme hand
of the powerfull God was
vpon him, then called he for
Moses to pray to God for
him. And yet that zeale continues
but as do his plagues:
the one ceasing, the other
are staied. Carnall men make
their praiers as the water
mooues the Mill-wheele;

when the water ceaseth, the
wheele staieth: so when
troubles faile, faith & praier
cease. Man by nature trusts
rather his owne present
worldly meanes, then Gods
promises; his owne wealth,
then Gods word: as he that
obserues the rules of carnall
reason, cannot but collect
how far the confidence men
repose in worldly meanes,The confidence of worldly men.
ouersway their trust in God,
namely, as farre as the earth
is distant from the heauens.
For according to the portiō
of euerie earthly blessing,
hath euerie carnall man trust
in his means;1. Sam. 17. 51.

                  Belteshatzer
in his vain-glorie,
and infinite others, trusting
in their own seuerall means,
long since gone to their places;
but haue not carried
hence with them this vaine
confidence frō mortal men.
For euery carnall man in his
owne nature, extendeth his
confidence onely so farre as
he hath visible and carnall
meanes. Quantum habet
nummi, tantum habet & fidei,
We trust so farre as we see
probable carnall meanes in
naturall reason, fit to be depended
vpon: which failing,
Faith faileth. The couetous
man is called an Idolater,
because he puts his trust in
his riches: so may euery man
be truely called, that trusteth
in carnall means, whether it

be riches, strength, friends,
or other the like. And the
reuerence that men naturally
yeelde vnto these meanes,
differeth not much from
that they doe vnto God:
onely what they pretend towards
God is opē, but what
they do towards their earthly
meanes is secret. They
seeme not visibly to kneele,
nor verbally to pray to the
meanes: but they in their
hearts preferre that they see
and enioy, aboue that they
haue but heard of; the promises
of the inuisible God.
And therefore rather then
they will diminish their
wealth, to doe good vnto
Gods people, as God hath
commanded, as touching
their abundance, they will
be bolde to straine a point of

Christian obedience, and rather
giue ouer their following
of Christ, and abandon
his presence with the Gergesites,
then to lend vnto God,
though they shall be assured
not only ten of the hundred,
but one hundred-fold more
then they disburse. And
therfore no maruell though
they neuer or seldome pray
vnto the inuisible God.
Their soules are not so deare
vnto them as their liues, and
their liues not so pretious as
their wealth: nay, liues and
soules are of smal value with
them, in comparison of their
worldly riches, and carnall
pleasures. Tell a rich worldling,
that he ought to make
his praiers vnto God: hee
will in his heart aske you, for
what hee should pray; hee

hath wealth at will, as the
rich man in the Gospell; he
hath health at his hearts desire;
his cattell prosper; his
corne, oile, & wine abound:
for what should hee pray?
It is a strange exercise you
would draw him vnto, that
concerneth not his worldly
profit, or carnal delight. The
like may be also said of euery
meere carnall man, bee hee
poore or rich, who rather
then hee will embrace the
promises, and faithfully depend
vpon the prouidence
of God, hee will aduenture
the most vnlawful and vniust
attempts, against the lawes
both of God & men: wheras,
if they could or would incline
their eares to hear, and
their hearts to vnderstand
the word of truth, they could

not but abandon all vniust
deuises: the rich would pray
vnto God for direction to
dispose of their wealth to
Gods glorie and their owne
soules health; and the poore
for supplie of all their corporall
necessities, and relie
vpon Gods promises and
prouidence, bending al their
powers to serue the liuing
God, in obedience and praier.The spirituall mā hath but one, the carnall many Gods.
The godly and faithfull
poore man, beeing p
                     •
                  nched
with penurie, visited with
sicknesse, in feare of enimies,
and in whatsoeuer danger,
flieth vnto one onely God
for all: but the carnall man
hath many Gods, the Monie
in his Chest, his Friends that
his Mammon hath got him,
his Corne in his Barnes, his
Cattle in the Fields, his Plate
                  
and Iewels, his Wit and Pollicy
are the Gods of worldly
men: in them they trust, and
by som, or one of them, they
hope to be relieued, or steeded
in whatsoeuer desperate
occasion; and therfore seeke
they not the helpe of the inuisible
God, by fruitlesse
Prayer, as they deeme it. But
the faithfull man in deede
knoweth these to be deceiuing
Gods, flattering Gods,
like vnto Ionahs Gourd,The carnall mans gods wither like Ionahs Gourd. that
seemed faire for a day, and
when it should most haue
sheltred him, it withered by
the worme at the roote. So
haue all these vain-glorious
Gods their wormes, that
worke at their roote, who
wither when they that trust
in them haue most neede of
their helpe: like the Manna
                  
that the Israelites gathered
ouer night, and kept till
morning, which withered
& stank when they thought
to eat it. Euen so do Friends
faile: Riches, Strength, and
Pollicie deceiue them that
trust to them, or in thē. And
it is to bee admired, that so
many men, not onely instructed
by the Word of God,
but also by so many experiences,
which they euery day
see, that all the glorie of the
world, and vanities thereof
are but deceiuing dreames,
and yet that they should suffer
themselues to be bewitched
with their flatteries &
inchantments; like the followers
of Vlysses, transformed
into beasts by the
charmes of Circes, who honour
that which is to bee

contemned, and contemne
God, who aboue all friends,
riches & whatsoeuer means,
is to bee loued, embraced,
beleeued, and praied vnto.
            
            
               CHAP. IV.
               The faithfull mans God is
the onely liuing God, and in
him is his chiefe good: the
carnall men haue manie
Gods: the ends of both.
               THE friends, the riches
and whatsoeuer good
the faithfull man hath or hopeth
for, is in heauen. The
Father, the Sonne, and the
Holy Ghost, one Al-sufficient
God, the Angels & heauenly
societie: these are, & will
be for euer his, and will neuer
faile nor forsake him.

He that created him he will
keepe him, he that redeemed
him he will iustifie him, hee
that sanctified him hee will
reach him to pray to the Father
in the Sonne: hee will
assist our spirits, who know
not how, or for what to
pray: he will help our infirmities,
& enkindle our godly
desires: he will make such a
sacred vnion between himselfe
and our spirits, as wee
shall become one with him,
and God the Father, and the
Sonne, being one with the
Holy Ghost, shall in the
consent of the sacred Trinitie
beget vs anew, giue vs
new hearts, new affections,
new loue, liuely faith, and
furnish vs with all the graces
of right regeneration; yea,
wee shall become like vnto

our elder brother, and euen
here in earth partake of heauenly
consolation. The Angels
shall administer vnto vs
all holy aide, and support vs
in all our waies & walkings,
according to the good pleasure
of GOD, who giueth
them charge ouer his children.
These are the goods
of the godly.Sweet is the operation of faith in God. Oh the sweet
operation of liuely faith, begotten
by the promise of
God in Christ, made in his
word! it begetteth Praier,
and Praier truely powred
forth, by lippes vndefiled, in
the affection of a right
qualified heart, vnto God
the Father in his Son, doth
truly assure vs of Gods presence,
and present reliefe in
all our necessities, more fully
and more truely then all the

false Gods, and vaine goods
of carnall men, and their
meanes.
               What worldly or carnall
aide had the three children in
the Furnace?God workes without humane meanes. What arme of
flesh deliuered Daniel from
the Lions? What earthly
helpe had that great God to
ouerthrow the Armie of Senacherib?
Many in like dangers
haue beene saued, relieued,
and deliuered without
humane aide. The examples
are infinite in Scriptures,
wherof the miracles done in
leading the children of Israel
out of Egypt through the
Wildernesse, their plantation
in and vpon the borders
of Canaan, and the life of Ioseph,
may serue to satisfie any
beleeuing man. For neither
were friends, nor wealth, nor

strength, nor pollicie, aiding
this great God in his works
of greatest wonder. Who
then will preferre these base
earthly deceiuing Gods, and
flattering goods, before the
good God of Israel? Or who
will trust any God but the
God of Hoasts? Haue any of
the Gods of the Nations deliuered
his land out of the
hands of the King of Ashur?
Where is the God of Hamath,
and of Arpad? Where is the
God of Sepharnaim, Hena, &
Iuah? Which of the Gods of
worldly & carnall men haue
deliuered their most humble
suppliants, out of any their
troubles, or rid them or preuented
any of their dangers?
It is a most execrable blasphemie
against the God of
heauen, to preferre worldly

goods, and carnall meanes
before the helpe, loue and
fauour of the God of Gods
and of goodnesse, as manie
do (testified by their works)
though they would seeme to
shew the contrarie. How
did wicked Rabshakeh raile
vpon the liuing God from
Senacherib his master? And
did not the Angell of the
Lord that night destroy one
hundred fourescore and fiue
thousand men of the Hoast
of Ashur? Here was the force
of flesh confounded, and
Senacherib himself was slain
by Adramelech and Sharazer
his owne sonnes, as hee
was worshipping Nisroche
his God in the Temple of the
Idoll. Who then, seeing the
successe of mans carnal confidence,
& Idolatrous zeale,

will not seeke the God of
heauen for succor in danger,
for reliefe in want, and for
comfort in all distresses?
what man of common sense
obserueth not manie precedent
examples, of the weaknes
and vncertaintie of carnall
meanes? And yet how
many are there to be found
in these times of common
carnall securitie, that do seek
their helpe at God, by humble
and faithfull Praier? doe
they not rather depend vpon
the broken Reede of their
owne felt outward meanes?
and therfore despise the seruice
of God, and contemne
his weake children. The
Glutton would not pitty Lazarus,
the false Iudges did
accuse Susanna, the rich will
striue to wrong the poore,

and wrest Iustice vniustly,
by the meanes of their corrupting
Mamon, seldome
or neuer considering, that
there is a God that careth for
the poore, who is able to raise
vp a Daniel to cleere Susannaes
innocencie, a Salomon
to decide the doubts, arising
by false pretences. There is
great difference betweene
the pretended happinesse of
the rich, and poore.Great difference betweene the happines of the godly poore, and w
                        •
                     cked rich. And so
much differ the felicitie of
the one and other; the one is
great and fearefull to the
poore, and hath his felicitie
in this life; the other is despised
of the rich, and hath
his miserie here: but the first
passeth from his mirth to
mourning, from his wealth
to want, from his glorie to
griefe, from a glorious life to

an eternall death. But the
second is taken frō his basenesse
to glorie, from miserie
to comfort, from griefe to
grace, and from a kinde of
worldly death to celestiall
and endlesse life. For it is not
permitted in diuine iustice,
that the children of GOD
should line heere in carnall
pompe, to withdraw them
from diuine obedience; nor
the wicked to partake heere
of inward & heauenly consolation,
setting their hearts
and affections vpon worldly
things. Wee cannot enioy
light and darknes together;
we cannot feede and fill our
hearts with the pleasures of
this life, and yet thinke wee
shall not taste of the bitternesse
of the second death.
To the end therfore that we

deceiue not our selues in our
iudgments touching the spirituall
and carnall men, wee
must beware that wee
ground not our opinions
vpon outward appearance
of mens estates,Not to iudg of men by their states, rich or poor. high or low;
for there are rich religious
men, and irreligious poore
men: but we must iudge all
men, and all things by the
word of God, the right rule
                     •
                  
and infallible, to discern and
distinguish the perfect from
the counte
                     •
                  feit. And therin
wee must lay aside naturall
reason & carnall vnderstanding,
which are enmitie to
God, and commonly iustifieth
what he condemneth, &
cōdemneth what he approueth.
Loue not the world saith
Saint Iohn, nor the things that
are of the world: for if any

man loue the world, the loue of
God is not in him. Yet saith
carnall reason, Loue the
world, and the things of the
world; for that thou mayest
doe, and loue God too. But
how hang these together?
For he that loueth God, loueth
righteousnes, holinesse,
meekenes, patience, obedience
and prayer: but he that
loueth the world, loueth the
contrarie, liuing in vnrighteousnesse,
disobedient to
God, ouercom with the desires
of the flesh, the
desires of the eies,
and the pride
of life.

                  SAlomon speaking of the
World, saith, that when
hee had well considered all
things that the world afforded,
hee could not but obserue
it very inconstant, and
mens mindes very variable,
and often distracted, staggering
whereunto to applie
themselues: wherein yet hee
found by experience, that al
men for the most part, embraced
that which they
should shunne, and shunned
that which they should embrace,
changing their counsels

as worldly occasions offered
mutabilitie in their affaires,
extolling, dispraysing,
louing, hating, hoping, fearing,
beleeuing, distrusting,
and finally following and
forsaking all things as they
were led by carnall vnderstanding,
wherein they worshipped
the creature in steed
of the creator; leauing the
seruice of God, and praying
vnto God; and inclining
themselues to those courses
wherunto their owne appetites
sway them, and the Diuell
inforceth them: wherby
it commeth to passe, that
some couetously pursue to
be rich among men, which
often with-holdeth them
from seruing God; as appeareth
by many of them, that
content them rather to violate

a good conscience, forgetting
not only pietie, but
meere humanitie, to accomplish
their desires; mingling
and confounding good entended,
with euill acted; estranging
themselues from
all religious affections and
inward holy desires; associating
themselues with such
as will applaude their vanities,
and reiect the society of
the good, of whom they
might learne to serue the liuing
God, by obedience &
prayer. How can you beleeue
(saith S. Iohn) seeing yee receiue
glory one of another, and
seek not after, nor pray for the
glory which commeth from
God alone? Almost euerie
man seeketh to outstrip another
in carnall, but not in
diuine wisedome. And therfore

can they not attribute
the praise of obtaining what
they seeme to enioy, to the
right cause: for they begin
at their owne apprehension
of what is good, and therevpon
build their weake wisdome;
whereas they should
beginne in the world to bee
fools to the world, that they
might be wise to God: as the
Apostle counselleth; that, If
any man seeme to be wise, let
him be a foole, that he may be
wise.
                  1. Cor. 4. 7. 8 For as Christ came not
to call the righteous (such as
reputed themselues pure) to
repentance,True and false wisedome. but sinners (such
as acknowledged their own
imperfectiōs): so surely God
giueth not wisedome to the
wise (namely, to such as
thinke the worldly wisdom
sufficient) but to such as

thinke themselues fooles
wanting the true knowledg
of diuine things. For, the wisdom
of the world is foolisbnesse
with God; and hee catcheth
these kinds of wisemen in their
owne craftinesse.
                  1. Cor. 3. 9. Iob 5. 13. Although
worldly pollicie may (as it
doth) circumuent the innocent,
yet cannot God be deceiued:
for such is his deep
and iust iudgement, & high
wisedome, that he knoweth
and iudgeth, he discerneth
and condemneth, or approueth,
farre aboue the reach of
mortall man. Man may deceiue
man, not onely by visible
actions of earthly and
worldly deuises, but euen in
spirituall exercises; for they
may seeme to beleeue, because
they so brag of themselues;
and to pray, because

they may be seene to kneele
at a piller to lift vp the eies,
to strike the breste, and to
moue the hand and lips, as
if they were verie deuout:
And yet may their hearts be
full of gall and bitternes, and
their affections be set (like
Demas) vpon the world and
worldly things, wherin God
is not deceiued.The hypocrite only deceiueth himselfe. But the hypocrite
that seemeth to bee,
and is not religious, godly,
faithfull, and truly zealous,
deceiueth himselfe, thinking
that God will content himself
with the chaffe, that hath
no corne, with the leaues
without fruit, and with the
show without the substance
of faith, obedience, and praier.
And therefore the rich
man, and the worldly wiseman,
as cousen germans may

not look for any applause at
the hands of God, as they vsurpe
it from men, but to receiue
according to the inward
disposition of their
hearts and soules. God respecteth
not the person of
the rich, nor wise according
to the world, nor reiecteth
he the person of the poore;
but according to the measure
of grace in eyther hee
approueth or reproueth thē;
yet in the more dangerous
estate is the rich man, as appeareth
by the wordes of
Christ himselfe, who obserued
how riches wrought
with men in the world, how
it choaketh the word of
God in them; working to
the lust of all forbidden
things, and against the desire
of all diuine wisedome,

which is the life of faith.
And faith being the life of
prayer is quenched thereby,
and consequently prayer,
which is the life of our
soules, waxeth cold and withereth.
Yet cannot this extend
to euety rich man; for
the Wiseman saith,What rich man deserueth commendation and admiration. that, That
rich man is blessed, which is
found without blemish, and
hath not gone after gold, nor
trusted in money and treasure:
adding, Who is he, and we will
commend him? for wonderfull
things hath he done among the
people, hauing beene tried and
found perfect: let him bee an
example of glorie, who might
offend and hath not offended,
or doe euill and hath not done
it. By which wordes he intimates
vnto vs, that rich
men haue many and more

motiues by their meanes to
offend, then the poorer sort
haue: and that it is a strange
thing to find a rich man so
qualified by diuine grace, as
he wil bestow his goods, and
performe the duetie that
God commands, to make
heauenly friends with their
earthly Mammon.
                  Wh
                        •
                      it is hard for a rich man to be saued. Therfore
our Sauiour pronounceth
such impossibilitie for a rich
man to enter into the Kingdome
of heauen, euen because
of his couetousnesse
and oppression, and because
of his securitie, and seldome
or neuer faithfully seruing
the liuing God; and againe
denounceth woes against
them, for that they haue
their consolation in this
world: not for that they oppresse
the poore, and get

their goods by vnlawfull
meanes; but because they
haue their cōsolation, namely
their carnall delights and
pleasures, and not their spirituall
ioy, and inward comfort
of the holy Ghost heere
in this life. Therefore behoueth
it rich men to beware,
they place not their hearts
consolation vpon these
worldly & fleeting vanities,
but according to diuine
counsaile; If riches encrease,
not to set their mindes vpon
them, but to vse them as they
vsed them not. For it is not
meerely riches that maketh
the vser, but the abuser of
them vnhappie. And therefore,
as there may be a poore
man proude and couetous,
euen in his small portion: so
may there be a rich mā poor

in his owne conceit, and so
bestowe and distribute his
goods, as not onely not a
woe, but a blessing shall be
pronounced vnto him, as to
the poor, beleeuing in God:
for our Sauiour, to encourage
all, as well poore as
rich rightly affected, and to
stirre them vp to obedience
and prayer, saith; Reioyce &
be glad, for I haue prouided
for 
                        •
                     ou a Kingdome.
               
            
            
               CHAP. VI.
               The force of liuely faith: and
how hard a thing it is truly
to apprehend the misterie
of Christ; and how easie
historically to discourse
thereof.
               THE promises of future
happinesse are able to

stirre vp the dullest heart, to
waite, and worke out his
saluatiō with fear & trembling,
with loue and obedience,
in faith & prayer; and
yet it seemeth, Not manie
wise, not many mighty, not
many rich beleeue this promise.
They seem rather to be
leue a bond, a statute, a pawn
or the promise of a rich mā,
then they wil giue credit vnto
God vpon his oath, who
yet neuer was found to promise
any thing but what he
performed, to the good of
euery one that (beleeuing)
asketh any thing fit for him
to receiue: he deceiueth no
man that trusteth his bare
word.The force of beleeuing God vpon his promise. 
                  Abraham might haue
cast many doubts, being in
a profane and Idolatrous
countrey, brought vp without

the written will of God,
being called thence by an
inuisible power, to repaire
into a remote country, vnknowne,
and the conditions
of the people strange vnto
him. But he contrarily cast
off all difficulties, and confidently
resolued, against his
owne naturall reason, and
will of all his friends and familiars,
and betooke him to
the iourney, and ceased not
till he came to Canaan. Who
would not haue consulted
with his kinsfolks & frends?
Who would not haue looked
for better assurance of
good successe, before hee
would haue aduentured to
forsake his countrey and
friends, and betake himselfe
to the hazard of such an attempt?
But he knew that he

that called him was iust, and
what hee had promised hee
was able to performe, and
would neither faile him nor
forsake him. Hee wauered
not as the most of vs do, touching
heauen and heauenly
things promised; how can
we affirm we beleeue it, and
yet giue our selues ouer to
the world? It is not indeed
euery mans case to know
the mysterie of Christ;
                  Euery man beleeueth not the mysterie of Christ. but in
a kinde of generall apprehension,
as hee is deliuered
in the outward word, according
to the Historie. But to
beleeue that he came in the
flesh without man, to containe
two natures vnder one
visible forme; that hee was
God equall with the father,
and man like vnto vs; that
he cancelled the hand-writing

that was against vs; that
in him we are reconciled again
to God the father; that
he sits at God's right hand a
mediator for vs, and that all
beleeuers shall ascend and
rest with him in glorie; that
our bodies that are corrupt,
shall either die and putrifie,
or be changed, and in fine,
be glorified in the heauens.
And to apply all this to our
owne selues through faith,
cannot but goe so farre beyond
the ordinarie capacities
of naturall men, as the
God of heauen is aboue the
God of the ayre. For as
Christ said vnto Peter, flesh
and bloud reueiled not vnto
him what Christ was: neither
can the natural man apprehend
this heauenly mysterie,
and therefore cannot

beleeue the promise of saluation
to the comfort of his
own soule, and consequently
cannot pray to God in
Christ. He can speake of, and
dispute, and beleeue the
whole Historie of Christ,
both how he was promised
and prophesied, how he was
crucified, and can relate euery
Article of Christian beleefe.
And so farre the diuels
know, beleeue, and tremble.
But this is the peculiar portion
of Gods children, truly
to depend vpon Christ, thorough
faith grounded vpon
knowledge; as beleeuing
that heauen is his portion, is
the gift of God in Christ;
who being the liuely image
of God the father, teacheth
vs to know God in the Trinitie,
and the Trinitie in vnitie:
                  
whom who so knoweth
not, and by knowing him
loueth him, and in louing
him obeyeth him, and in o
                     •
                  beying
him beleeueth him,
and in beleeuing him dooth
not pray vnto him. howsoeuer
they seeme to vpholde
their knowledge, defend
their obedience, and bragge
of their prayers, they are all
but counterfeit. For no truly
spirituall exercise can bee
performed, or diuine grace
obtained, but by a man spiritually
qualified and beloued
of God, and who loueth
God: for vnlesse we feele in
our selues the loue of God
towards vs, wee can neuer
loue God; for he loueth vs
first, and by the third person
of the Trinitie worketh loue
in vs towards him: and loue

being the band of obedience,
and obedience the
marke of our election, and
cōsequently the seale, which
hath the image of our Redeemer,Who is truly adopted in Christ to be the childe of God, and 
                        〈◊〉
                      not.
whereby our adoption
to bee the sonnes of
God is confirmed to euery
one that beleeueth. Not to
euery one that pretendeth
to loue, obey, and serue him;
but to him only whose heart
is right before the Lord,
who heareth the word, beleeueth
the spirit that wrote
it, and bringeth forth the
fruits of it, namely, to doe
what is therin commanded,
and to auoyde things forbidden
therein; he, euen he
is the vndoubted adopted
sonne of God, and whatsoeuer
he asketh the father by
the spirit in the sonne, hee

shall receiue it: for he hath
the promise of the blessings
of this life and the life to
come. Contrariwise, such
as neither yet haue, nor des
                     •
                  re
to haue thi
                     •
                   feeling, this
faith, and this dependance
on God, howsoeuer they
pretend that they are the
sonnes of God, for that they
can only talke, like, and performe
some outward duties
as the true sonnes of God
do, yet let them not deceiue
themselues, they are not yet
out of the lees of their originall,
neither haue they remission
of their actuall sins;
but the Bond is yet against
them depending vncancelled,
though they associate
the sonnes of God, and not
only in humane affairs conuerse,
but in diuine dueties

communicate with them, as
in hearing the word preached,
in the sacraments, and in
publique prayer. They are
yet but bastards, & no children;
they neuer truely tasted
of the milke of Christs
spouse, nor euer drew the
life of grace out of her
breasts: no more then did
Cham in the Arke with Noah,
Ismael in the house with
Abraham, Esau in the company
of Iacob, who inwardly
did not partake of their
fathers vertues, of obedience,
faith, and continual
praier vnto God,
the God of their
fathers.
            
            
               
               CHAP. VII.
               Naturall fathers cannot beget
children good or euill of
their owne wils; but they
that are begotten anew of
God, are only good and like
vnto God, before whom the
vnregenerate, howsoeuer
seeming holy, are hypocrits.
               EArthly fathers cōmonly
beget childrē of their
owne corporall likenes, but
the godliest father cannot
propagate in his children
the graces of the spirit, neyther
can profane fathers by
their sinnes make their children
sinners. For it is found
by experience, that good fathers
haue often wicked, and
wicked fathers godly children.
But the children of
God, begotten anew by the

holy Ghost, can neuer fall
from being like vnto him
that begat him. And therefore
doe they much dishonour
God, who in wordes
professe they are his sonnes,
and yet in their actions they
resemble the image of Sathan.
It were a great blemish
vnto a godly man to
be wrongfully supposed the
father of a wicked sonne;
much more is God dishonoured
by such as would
seeme to be, but are not of
his seed. For they that are
of God indeed, cannot but
in some measure resemble
him, in being righteous as
he is righteous: that is, By
casting off the olde man which
is corrupt,
                  Eph. 4. 22. 
                  through deceiueable
lust, and to put on the new
man, which after God is created

in righteousnes and true
holines. This casting off and
putting on, doeth teach vs
that there is in vs somthing
that befits vs not to retaine
if we will be the true sonnes
of God,What we ought to put on, and cast off. not by reputation
among men, but by imputation
in Christ. What is to be
cast off, and what to bee
put on, is plainly expressed
in the Apostles wordes before
mentioned, namely, to
cast off all deceiueable lusts,
(which includeth all things
forbidden) and to put on
righteousnesse, which implieth
a spirituall indowment
of al heauenly graces;
among which, none is of
that singular force, vertue,
and effect, as is zealous and
heartie prayer in faith vnfained,
which none can effectually

make but such as
haue put on this new man:
for the olde man knoweth
not how to pray, being clothed
with corruption, and
blinded with the mist of ignorance.
The new man only,
shaped in holinesse, knoweth
to whom, when, in
whom, for what, and how
to pray; all which circumstances
are duly to be considered
in prayer: and yet
neither of these dooth the
naturall, that is, the old man
truly apprehend; and consequently
the lip-labor that
he pretendeth to bestow in
prayer, is not onely not profitable,
but sinfull.
            
            
               
               CHAP. VIII.
               Carnall wisedome hath not
chiefe place of counsell in
the regenerate man: he dependeth
on God, and not on
the meanes in any enterprise.
               FRiends (we obserue) do
most vsually communicate
together, not by way of
dissimulation, but by sincere
affection: and one is ayded
and comforted of another,
according to the occasions
each propoundeth to other.
And shal we think that that
man that loueth God, will
estrange his occasions from
the counsaile of God? Will
hee deliberate of any matter
of importance, but will first
consult with the Oracle of

Gods mouth? And will hee
not impart his occasions by
powring them forth vnto
him in praier? assuring himselfe
that God againe will
answer him by his holy spirit,
and by him certifie his
spirit what he shall doe, and
what course hee shall take,
both for the atchieuing of
the good he desireth, & for
the auoyding the danger he
feareth. No carnall counsel
whatsoeuer, not warranted
by the word, shall be admitted
to that consultation
or resolution: he will abandon
all carnall respects, and
onely holde himselfe to diuine
direction: hee will not
vse humane wisedome,
                  Carnall wisedome a hand-maide to diuine prudence. but as
it were a hand-maide to diuine
prudence. It may serch
and find out such wants, and

corporall necessities, as are
fit in spiritual vnderstanding
to be supplied, but leaueth
the execution to diuine wisdome,
which produceth
faith, and faith prayer for the
obtayning thereof at the
hands of God. And as Abraham
left his seruants and
Asses behinde him when he
went to offer vp his sonne;
so doth this heauenly wisedome
leaue all carnall respects
behinde when it approcheth
towards God, to
offer the sacrifice of prayer
or praise. Contrariwise, it
is too manifest, that the most
carrie their carnall vanities
with them euē to the Altar;
making their petitions partly
in the flesh and partly in
the spirit, in part beleeuing
and in part doubting, halting

before God, and yet seeming
to walk vprightly before
men, who iustifie or cō
                  demne
the outward action,
not seeing the inward heart.
               To pray vnto God with
the lippes for any corporall
benefit,To pray to God, and to beleeue▪ in meanes is spirituall adulteri
                        •
                     . and yet to haue the
eye of the hart fixed in confidence
vpō naturall means,
is a kinde of spirituall adultery.
For, what man is hee
that hauing a wife, outwardly
affable, vsing wordes of
loue vnto him, and yet her
he
                     •
                  rt set vpon another man,
will not thinke her a faithles
and vnchaste wise? And is
God lesse iealous think we,
who craueth our hearts
when we shall worship him
in words and outward shew
of works, when our consciences
cannot but tell vs that

we aske that of God which
we inwardly beleeue more
probable and possible to be
obtained by meanes without
him? Is not this a falsifying
of our faith and dissembling
of our prayers? Is
not this a manifest breach
of the law that saies, we shal
haue no other Gods but
Iehouah; as also not to take
his name in vaine, as they do
that call vpon him with the
lips, their hearts farre from
him?
               The Iewes thinking to
make themselues strong by
the Egyptians and other carnall
meanes,Esa. 2. 21. A curse on them that leaue God to depend on other meanes. left their dependancie
on God; & therfore
did God denounce his
iudgements against them:
Cursed is the man that trusteth
in man, and maketh flesh
                  
(any kind of carnal meanes)
his arme,
                  Ier. 17. 5. 
                  and withdraweth
his heart from the Lord: hee
shall not see, when any good
commeth. How can he then
attribute praise or prayer
vnto God for whatsoeuer
successe, when he groundeth
his hope on earthly meanes,
and not on God? Nay,
though hee pray vnto God,
and yet dependeth more,
and puts more hope on secondarie
meanes? if he find
that come to passe that hee
desired, how can hee but
yeeld part of the praise vnto
the mediate cause, wherein
hee in part trusted? and so
derogate the praise due vnto
God, who is eyther all or no
part of the cause of that wished
successe. For although
God vse naturall instruments

to effect his will, not
onely in relieuing his children
when they pray vnto
him, but also in punishing
the wicked when they offend;
yet are these meanes
onely of, and by God, working,
not as man willeth, but
as God foreseeth fit for the
good of the one, & punishment
of the other. God vsed
clay to cleere the eies of
the blinde man: if the blinde
man had yeelded the thanks
to the clay as the cause of his
sight, though hee had likewise
giuen praise vnto God,
hee had robbed God of his
right. For to allow vnto
God a fellow-helper, were
to argue him of himselfe insufficient;
as som most fearfully
belch forth a most superstitious
praier, saying,

                  God and our Lady do this or
that, or preuent this or that;
whereby they eyther make
God no God, or a God not
absolute in power, nor without
a cooperator complete,
which cannot bee but most
horrible blasphemie. I hereby
yet inferre not that it is
vnlawfull to giue reuerence
vnto the means which God
vseth for our good, as Dauid
did to Ionathan; yet no further
but as to the instruments,
without which God
might haue effected his
worke, eyther by other
meanes, or without any
meanes, nay, against means,
as not tied to any secondary
meanes of necessitie. Hezekiah
being healed with a
cluster of figges, did not perswade
himself that nothing

else could haue done the
cure, but that whatsoeuer
God had made the mediate
cause, howsoeuer contrarie
to the opinion that man
might haue of the thing, it
would haue wrought the
same effect. For he is able by
weakest means to performe
the greatest worke; as it appeared
by the ouerthrow of
the wals of Iericho with the
sound of Rams hornes.
                  God works by meanes, without & against meanes. And
as he worketh by meanes,
so sometimes without
meanes, euen by his word,
as in healing the Cananitish
woman, and the Centurions
seruant: nay, such is his absolute
power as he worketh
as familiarly and easily against
meanes, as in bringing
water out of the hard &
drie Rocke, making the waters

to diuide as the red Sea
and Iordan, in making the
Sunne to stand still in G
                        •
                     beon,
and the Moon in the valley
of Aialon at the prayer
of Iosuah: and causing the
Sunne to goe backe in his
sphere contrarie to, and against
his naturall motion,
at the prayer of Hezekiah.
The holy Scriptures are full
of such sweete examples of
the absolute power of God,
who to effect them requires
necessarily no other human
meanes but faithfull praier
                     •
                  
not the praier which passeth
onely the lips, the affections
of the heart being extrauagant,
but that prayer which
proceedeth from the sanctified
soule,How the soule must be qualified in time of prayer. well and rightly
tuned in all her faculties;
the vnderstanding thinking

on nothing but on God, the
will onely louing him, the
memory coueting to retaine
nothing but him, the desire
aspiring to no other happinesse
but what he hath promised
vs in his word. In this
maner were our holy fathers
qualified, and in this sweete
consent of the affections
poured they forth the concordant
harmonious praiers
that wrought these former
most admirable supernaturall
effects, in altering the
naturall course of those creatures
which he himselfe set
in the firmament, neuer to
be moued to the end of the
world.
            
            
               
               CHAP. IX.
               It is a dangerous thing to
pray vnto God vnprepared;
but most safe & sweet vpon
diuine premeditation arising
of grace, not of nature.
               HOw can this but moue
a kind of feare in men
who presume to thrust
themselues into the presence
of God, vttering praiers
in wordes, their vnderstandings
being carried from
God through the vanities
of this life, their wills beeing
besorted with the loue of
carnall things, and their desires
thirsting after worldly
aduancements? Are these
mens prayers of force to
cast downe holdes? to alter

the natural course of things?
or can they obtaine any
thing at the handes of God
but reproofe? But men that
are wise in Christ, enlightned
with the diuine spirit,
feele motiues in themselues
of another kinde; not staying
below, their affections
set vpon the golden Calfe at
the foot of mount Sinai: but
they a
                     •
                  cend vp in their harts
to the holy mount of Grace,
and there conuerse they familiarly
with the true God,
leauing the flesh pots, the Onyons
and Gourds of Egypt,
and feede on the heauenly
Manna, Angels bread, the
bread of life: whereby they
becom so rapt vp from earth
and earthly things, as they
haue their conuersations alreadie
in the heauens, by

their heauenly communication
with God in their spirits.
Their prayers & sweet
conference with God for
the time ended; they then
returne to the performance
of their lawfull affaires, and
therein walke (as it were)
with God, liuing so sincerely
with, and among men, in
the feare and loue of God,
as if they were in the reall
presence of God.
               
                  Nature teacheth vs not to pray, but the spirit of God. To this degree of perfection
none can attaine by
his naturall vnderstanding
or will, but by the administration
of the spirit of God
only, who teaches vs how to
pray. God commaundeth
all men to pray, and yet giueth
not all men the gift of
true praier; and therefore euerie
man is bound to aske

of God power to aske: although
it may seem strange
to a carnall man to aske power
to performe the selfesame
thing that hee performeth
in asking. But it is to
be considered that there is a
verball and lip-kind of asking,
and there is a cordiall &
heartie praying; and he that
doeth it not from the heart,
may vtter it with the lippes,
and in words may seeme to
pray, and yet the heart remaine
estranged and full of
rancor and euill affections.
But such is the force of 
                     •
                  iuely
faith, that it cannot conceale
it selfe: for if it bee in
the heart it will shew it selfe
in the efficacie of prayer;
which praier onely hath the
promise to obtaine, beeing
made in the name of Christ

to God, & hath the promise
to be granted for his sake by
God. For in Christ are the
promises made vnto vs, both
of spirituall and corporall
blessings, and in him, and by
him sealed vnto vs and confirmed:
so as there is no
cause of doubting left vnto
the faithfully asking; alwayes
prouided, that he ask
not the thing, the graunting
whereof is not warranted in
the word of God, that hath
made vs a generall warrant
of granting whatsoeuer wee
aske; with restriction yet,
that it bee agreeable to his
wil, which also includeth all
things that he seeth best for
vs to receiue. For such is the
wisedome, prouidence, and
loue of God towards vs, that
like a father he will not giue

vnto his children a Scorpion
in stead of Fish: he will not
giue them hurtfull things instead
of helpfull. And therfore
it behoueth vs to inform
our selues by his word
what is consonant and what
dissonant to his will, that we
may auoide to aske forbidden
things, & with boldnes
aske things lawfull. In the
prayer which Christ taught
vs, we pray, Thy will be done:
wee must not therefore wilfully
attempt to aske, much
lesse to do any known thing
to the contrarie. But such is
our corruption, as howsoeuer
we seem willing that the
will of God should be done,
we yet retaine a kinde of inward
desire that God would
doe according to our wills:The will peruerts the mind.
for naturally the will of man

is neither rightly affected
towards his owne mind, nor
towards the will and word
of God. It is the rule of right
reason that the wil should be
directed by the minde; but
contrarily and preposterously
the will ouerswayes the
minde, and drawes it as by
cōstraint to many inordinat
desires: and therefore when
the minde begins to incline
it selfe to the sacred exercise
of prayer, the will as an vnequall
yoke-fellow peruerts
the minde, & distracts it into
many noysom lusts, & wandering
thoughts. This cannot
the most godly and most
faithfully zealous man but
find in his deuoutest praiers:
and therefore wee ought in
our prayers to restraine our
cogitations from earthly

things; and the more wee
feele them to range here and
there (as sensibly wee may)
so much the more earnest &
zealous we ought to be, and
so much the more watchfull
that they steale not away
our spiritual affectiōs, which
cause the minde to ascend euermore
vpward to the
Throne of his grace, who by
his holy spirit is readie to assist
our spirits, to suppresse
our erring thoughts, and to
rectifie our mindes according
to his
own will.
            
            
               
               CHAP. X.
               Whence all our transgressions
do proceede, and the reason
why we cannot pray aright,
& the means to reform it.
               OVr transgressions proceede
all from this,
that against the rule of diuine
reason, we preferre our
will and our desires before
the most holy will of the
Lord our God. How then
can we truly seek him whose
will our wills (as much as in
vs lieth) seeketh to resist?
The Apostle sheweth the
reason, saying, The naturall
man hath such a mind as cannot
vnderstand the things of
God, and such a will as is not
subiect to the law of God, nor
indeed can be. How then can

the minde conceiue how, or
for what to pray? And how
can the will frame the faculties
of vtterance and other
diuine affections? How can
it frame it selfe to pray vnto
God according to the right
rule prescribed vnto vs by
God? seeing that this exercise
is sacred, holy & spiritual,
& the mind & wil altogether
carnall & profane. And
therfore al the praiers which
natural men make in the habite
of the olde man, do not
onely not profit them, but
turn rather vnto a curse then
a blessing vnto them. What
man is hee then knowing
this, will lie stil in his natural
corruption and ignorance,
hauing the way laide out
before him, the meanes of
direction offered him, the

promise made vnto him, and
the reward assured him?
the way is Christ, the directiō
in that way is the word,
the promise is to receiue
what wee aske, and the reward
is life eternall: the way
is straight, the direction
plaine, the promise iust, the
reward great. In earthly
affaires there is a continuall
common emulation who
may grow greatest, wisest, &
most glorious, whose best
reward is but a vanishing
shadow. How foolish then
are wee to see and suffer all
men to outstrip vs in spirituall
things, and our selues to
lagger behinde, loth to goe
forward in diuine duties; as
trewantlike schollars with il
wil, and by compulsion prepare
them to the Schoole?

Hee then that may and will
not endeuour to attaine vnto
diuine knowledge by the
word, and thereupon, namely
vpon the promises of God
made therein, to builde a
liuely assurance of Gods neuer-fayling
goodnesse towards
him; and in that faith
will not seeke God in all his
occasions, by continuing
prayer; is neyther worthy to
haue the promises performed
vnto him, of the good
things of this life, nor of the
life to come. Let vs therefore
learn to deny our selues,
and endeuour to subdue our
owne wills, and wholly to
subiect them to the will of
God: so shall wee neuer vndertake,
consult, determine,
or conclude any action, vntil
wee haue enquired what the

will of God is therein, by
faithfull prayer.
            
            
               CHAP. XI.
               The neglect of the cnmmunicating
with God in prayer,
is the cause that many run
headlong to their owne ruine,
seeking what they need
in a wrong course, not feeling
their owne spirituall
wants.
               THe want of holy search
& desire to be enlightned
in the diuine duetie of
praier, and to bee directed
therein, is the cause that so
many men runne headlong
into their owne ruine, in
rashly enterprising that,
without cōmunicating with
God, which they in naturall

reason conceiue will prooue
to their high contentment;
as in making choise of religion,
the highest point of diuine
wisedome▪ in choosing
a wise, and the like. The Shechemites
without consulting
with God tooke vpon them
the seale of the couenant,
which was a true note, truly
taken of the true children of
God; but because they took
it to a carnall end, what reward
they had, appeareth
Gen. 34. So did Simon the
Magician couet spirituall
gifts, to vse them to carnall
ends: and the like doe they
that to obtaine corporall
maintenance, and to be free
from some calamitie, rashly
& without consulting with
God (by learning his word
and by prayer) thrust themselues

into the Romane Catholike,
or into any other
false Religion. Nay, to intrude
into the profession of
the true Religion, for the respects
abouesaid, and not in
a feeling of diuine loue to
the spirituall effects it worketh,
to Gods glory and their
owne comfort; is not onely
not to be truly religious, but
vnder the cloake of true religion
to be indeed a profane
Atheist. God commands vs
not to cōtract marriage but
vpon due deliberation and
consideration, & forbids to
contract with any of a false
Religion. Isack and Iacob
fearing and obeying the liuing
God, sought their
wiues, not by worldly ad
                     •
                  uice,
but therein to be directed
by God. And to that

end did Abrahams seruant
pray vnto the GOD of his
Master Abraham, that hee
might bee guided by some
diuine instinct how to chuse
a wife for his Masters sonne,
and all things succeeded vnto
him beyond naturall reason.
But Esau contrari
                     •
                  y,
without consulting with
God, or cōmunicating with
his parents▪ tooke him wiues
of the Gentiles, a profane &
irreligious people, such as
(for the Iewes to contract
matrimonie withall) was an
abhomination. Prayer or
consultatiō with God is the
best, but the last worke; of
chiefest, but of least regard
in this age in most capitall
causes, and of greatest consequence.
And therefore the
most of them succeed to the

perpetual trouble and griefe
of the parties. And that
which hath been said of the
former two, namely of the
choise of Religion and a
wife, may hold for, and in all
other matters belonging to
the life and gouernement of
man in this life, especially in
the election of some function
or calling in Church or
Common-weale; wherein
experience maketh manifest
that little or no conscience
is made to craue direction
from God: but according as
the profession or mysterie
seemeth likely to proue profitable
or discommodious, is
the desire made the more
hote or cold. But to consider
how it may stand with
Gods greatest glorie, & our
most comfort and spirituall

contentment, it is the last
matter thought vpon: they
beginne at the wrong end,
they first seek the world and
worldly things, and then as
leisure will serue, they will
seeke heauen & holy things,
where we should seeke heaue
                     •
                  
and the kingdom thereof
first, and then by diuine
promise, all things els shold
be administred vnto vs. But
the reason why som men are
so backward in seeking
God, to bee guided by him
in these high occasions, may
seeme to grow from a conceit,
that if they should vnfolde
their desires to God,
who seeth all their hidden
and polliticke equiuocations;
he would find that their
outward prayers to him, and
their inward hearts towards

him, would appeare so farre
vnlike, as he would haue no
respect vnto their offerings:
and therefore couet rather
to conceale their counsailes
from God, and climbe vp to
the obtaining of their high
purposes, by the scale of their
owne deuises, saying in their
hearts, How doth he know it?
Thou foole; if thy heart condemne
thee is not God greater
then thy heart,
                  1. Ioh. 3. 20. 
                  and knoweth al
things? But if thy heart con
                        •
                     demne
thee not, thou hast then
boldnesse towards God. If then
thou haue boldnesse, thou
mayest freely repaire to the
Throne of his grace; and as
he hath communicated vnto
vs all his counsaile, shall we
bee scrupulous to let him
know ours?Act. 20. 27. What is it that
the poorest and basest seeming

childe of God,We ought to vnfold our imperfections to God, yea, and to men vpon occasion. may
not freely speake vnto him?
Who of the ancient godly
fathers did not discouer
their own imperfectiō
                  
                     •
                  ? Peter
blushed not to acknowledge
the deniall of his Master
with bitter teares: Dauid
was not ashamed not
onely to confesse, but to inroll
the acknowledging of
his sins with his owne hand,
to the end that all his godly
posteritie might learne, not
to hide their faults from
God, but to make them
knowne to men. S. Paul likewise
thought it not any disparagement
to his credite
being an Apostle, that Hee
was a man solde vnder sinne,
that hee was buffeted of Sathan,
that hee did what hee
would not, and could not doe

what he would. None diuinely
enlightned by ta
                     ••
                  ing of
and beleeuing the good
word of God, that euer coueted
to conceale their imperfections
from God, knowing
& assuring themselues
that he is mercifull, and forgiueth
the sinnes of the truely
penitent. Against thee, against
thee onely (saith Dauid)
I haue sinned, and done euill
in thy sight. Hee was a
great King, chosen after
Gods owne heart; yet not
ashamed to acknowledge a
greater King, whom hee as
much feared to offend as the
most dutifull child the most
stern and seuere father, and
therefore was bold, with the
confession of his sinnes to
ioyne prayer for the remission
thereof, and obtained it.

I am but dust and ashes, saith
Abraham: I am not worthy
the least of Gods mercies,
saith Iacob: my fathers house
(saith Gideon) is the least of
all Israel: I am not worthie
(saith S. Paul) to bee called
an Apostle, yea, he confessed
himselfe the chiefest of all
sinners. These examples of
humilitie may be preuayling
motiues to moue vs to imitate
them, and to beware
how wee follow their contraries,
in pride, as Nabuchadnezzer,
                  The basest may be as proude as the most arrogant.
                  Senacherib,
Pharaoh, and such like imps
of insolencie; who althogh
they were Kings of greatest
greatnes, & we the meanest
of men, yet if wee imbrace
not humilitie wee may bee
found as hautie as the hautiest
of them. For they had

their pride but according to
the measure of their greatnesse,
and so may the meanest
exceed in pride beyond
the measure of his best
means. They thought themselues
not onely not inferiour,
but equall, nay aboue
God in power, and therefore
had none aboue them to obey,
and consequently, none
to whom they were bound
to pray. And whosoeuer exalteth
himselfe aboue that
which he is, be he the highest
or the basest among men,
hee equalizeth the proudest
of the former in their vnlimited
desires. For, as the
former rebellious Potentates
banded themselues against
God, in their impious
blasphemies; and as Nimrod
threatned to scale the

heauens by his haughtie Babel:
so no doubt but the
meanest proud man, that
ambitiously aduanceth his
heart aboue that which indeed
he is, and to attain vnto
heauen without obedience
and prayer vnto God;
hee is as high a rebell in his
heart as eyther Nabuchadnezzar,
Senacherib, or Pharaoh,
and his reward in the
wrath of God shall be as
great as was theirs
or Nimrods.

               Murtherous hearts, hautines,
and pride may lurke vnder
the habit of outward humblenesse.
               MAny such rancke and
rebellious spirits walk
in the habite of outward
humblenesse, as that Dominus
Dominantium, that calls
himselfe Seruus seruorum
Dei: hee that saith he is the
seruant of the seruants of God,
and yet Antichristianlike endeuours
to set vp and supplant
Princes. And his Votaries
of pouertie and voluntarie
beggerie; are not many
of them fit and inclinable to
any impious and most treasonable
actions? how haue
their handes (in shew lifted

vp towards heauen) bin imbrued
in the bloud of Princes
in the earth? If their couert
and concealed workes
of darknes were discouered,
if their infernall stratagems
were reuealed,Murtherers of Kings haue a shew of humblenesse and deuotion. and their desires
knowne to mortal men
as they are found out, and
seene by God; they could
not appeare but meere monsters,
such as was Balthazer,
the murtherer of the Prince
of Orange, the Frier, & that
miscreant Reualiack, that
foiled their fists in the bloud
of the two last Kings of
France: and yet had euery
of them his pretence of great
deuotion, in attempting and
perpetrating these capitall
villanies▪ They pray, they
receiue their sacrifice, and
haue promise of, & they beleeue

to bee registred and
canonized among the Saints
in heauen, and yet fellow-murtherers
with Iudas, with
whom they shall partake
their euerlasting reward,
without more serious sorrow,
and truer repentance
for their villanies, then any
of them seemed at their
deaths to professe. Are these
the instruments that are vsed
by the Pope, the pretended
Vicar of Christ, to support
his humble ambition, and
ambitious humblenes? Must
these be the Axes and Hammers
to cut and break down
Princes, and to confound
Kings and Kingdomes, not
concurring with his vsurped
Antichristian insolencie?
Where is then the effect of
their great penance, much

fasting, many praiers, and infinit
sectaries, and their deuotions?
Are these their
meritorious workes? Cannot
they defend their Antichristian
superstitions without
the murthering of Gods
owne annointed? without
treasons, rebellions, massacres,
& sheddings of bloud?
Who doth not then abhorre
their impieties? And who
obserueth the least of these
committed by any true
member of that Church,
which this malignāt Church
holdeth hereticall? And yet
all men see how it hath been
defended from all their diuellish
complotments, by no
other meanes but by faith in
God, and prayer to God.
Haue not their most hellish
attempts many pretences of

a holy beginning? A set cō
                  uocation
of preaching and
prayer, imposition of hands,
vowing of helpes, conioyning
of forces, and whatsoeuer
else may serue to the perpetration
of any bloudie action.
If these most impious
consorts enterprise not their
wicked acts, but in the shew
of calling mutually on God,
were it not a shame to professed
Christians to attempt
any matter lawfull, of greatest
moment, without touch
of any consideration of the
necessitie or vtilitie of faithfull
prayer? If the children
of darkenesse can point out
their more then heathenish
attempts by the outward
tokens and termes of deuotion
to their assured condemnation;
what will become

of cold Christians that
so little regard the holy duty
of prayer in all their actions,
to their soules saluation?

               Euery faithfull Christian findeth
comfort in praier: the
neglect whereof admits
many euils.
               WHo is that faithfull
Christian that hath
practised this holy exercise,
and hath not found comfort
to his conscience, and helpe
in his occasions? Whosoeuer
findeth the continuance

mind, let the cause arise from
spirituall or corporall occasions,
he may ass

it proceedeth, most ordinarily

at least, from his seldom
or neuer praying vnto God.
Griefe oftentimes procureth
teares, which seem somthing
to asswage the sorrow:
but it is (as it were) the
slacking of the band that
gripes the wound too hard:
but teares passing from the
heart through liuely prayer,
doe not onely ease the griefe
for a while, but heale it altogether;
and keep the wounded
parts sound, so long as
the plaster of true prayer
is applied, with faith thereunto.
The teares that wee
spend must bee spent before
God, who hath promised to
receiue them as they fal from
a liuely feeling heart, and to
put them in the bottle of his
remēbrance, reseruing them
as witnesses of our true repentance;

that the sinnes, in
sorrow whereof we shedde
them, may be washed away
by the bloud of Christ, and
not to rise vp in iudgement
against vs. And these teares
are of themselues as so many
petitions vnto God, who
hath bound himselfe by promise
to register them, as so
many preuayling requests;
wherby he giues oftentimes
what inwardly we desire, as
soone as the first teare falls
from a broken and contrite
heart.Psal. 32. 
                  Dauid affirmeth that
God pardoned his sinne as
soone as he had any motion
to craue it. God requireth
not our prayers because hee
hath neede of them, as a seruice
beneficiall or profitable
vnto him; but because wee
hauing neede of his graces

and blessings, and that hee
loueth vs in his beloued son
hee willeth vs to pray vnto
him for euery spirituall and
corporall blessing. And although
it be true, that hee
knoweth wherof we haue need,
yet in common reason, hee
that wanteth and disdaines
to aske, he is not worthy to
receiue that whereof he hath
neede.

               THe men that haue greatest

of the poorest and meanest
of the people, and such as
appeared to the world fools
and Idiots; and they that
seemed more wise, more
mightie & more noble, were
left out of the number of
them that were called. Yet
God preferred not the base
in the world before the noble,

to make them proud of
their calling, but that they
might be constrained, as it
were, to reioyce in the Lord,
by whose mercie they had
obtained in Christ wisedom
and all things necessarie to
saluation, before the more
glorious in the world, although
they were the most
base and abiect of all others:
and to moue them so much
the more readily & willingly
to serue God in thankefulnesse
and prayer, to testifie
their loue to him for his
mercies towards them. And
heauily it will befall them,
who hauing receiued so many
blessings at Gods hands,
are no whit the more moued
to loue him: and so many
threats for their vnbeleefe
and ingratitude, and yet not

moued to feare him. Will
they not bee drawne then
from their deceiuing vanities?
will they rather then
for lesse then an apple or a
messe of pottage, disclaime
their birth-rights, and loose
that Kingdome and Crown

of it all, it were not so horrible.
If a man missing of the
good promised, could avoid
the dangers threatned,
it would somthing mitigate
the despayring conscience,
and ease the troubled mind.

kinde of ease to the carnall
mind, that knoweth no other

heauen then the profits and
pleasures of this life nor feareth
other hell then the miserie,
penurie, and afflictions
of the same. But the case is
otherwise; they that misse
the kingdome of heauen by
not beleeuing the promise of
God, by not praying vnto
God for direction in the
course of their liues, may assure
themselues, thogh they
seeme not yet to beleeue it,
that there remaines for them
and attends them, the God
of darkenesse, and the Angels
of horror and torment.
And therefore they that are
wise in Christ, enlightned
with the sanctifying spirit of
God, obserue the difference
between sinne and sanctity,
betweene the carnall and the
spirituall, betweene the olde

and the new man, and finde
that the pleasing vanities of
this life, and the reioycing of
the worldly minded haue no
solid or sound assurance of
continuance, no not for a
day; and after commeth the
seueritie of iudgement. But
the spirituall man, vndergoing
with patience the bitter
miseries incident to a religious
and godly life; considereth
that the continuance of
it is but a spanne long: and
there attendeth him mercie
and consolation perpetuall.The true comfort of a Christian.
And therfore beareth he the
yoake without grudging,
spending his time, not in
wantonnesse and chambering,
not in vanities and carnal
pleasures; but in all temperance
and humblenesse of
minde: neuer so cheered,

neuer so full of consolation
and alacritie as when hee is
hearing God speake vnto
him by his word, as by preaching
or hearing of the
same; and finding himselfe
truely and aptly prepared,
and zealously exercised in
the most holy dutie of praier
and heauenly meditations,
wherein hee speaketh vnto
God. This is his comfort,
herein are his ioyes, and nothing
is so sweete vnto him
as heauenly continuall contemplation;
whereby hee
passeth by both the pleasures
and penurie of this life, as
things of that weakenesse to
moue loue to the one, or
feare of the other; as hee respects
them not, but placeth
all his affections on God,
with whom he knoweth that

his prayers doe at all times
so farre preuaile, as at what
time soeuer he asketh, hee receiueth;
whensoeuer hee seeketh
he findeth; and when soeuer
he knocketh he is admitted
into the presence of God. And
whatsoeuer misery befalleth
him in this life, hee feeleth it
not so vnsauorie to himselfe
as other men conceiue it,
that beholde and obserue it
in him. As our Sauiour told
his Disciples that hee had
meate to eate which they
knew not of; so hath euerie
sanctified & regenerate man
comfort that carnall men
know not of; which giueth
him such sweete feeling of
present happinesse, through
the assurance of his future
promised glorie, that he seemeth
through the abūdance

of his consolations, rapt as it
were alreadie out of this
earthly Tabernacle, into the
heauen of heauens, where he
hath his conuersation in the
spirit with-God, though hee
corporally remaine in this
inferiour world.

               True contentment, not gotten
by nature but by grace,
which produceth prayer, the
onely meane to obtaine all
good.
               SPiritual cōtentmēt none
can attaine vnto by his
owne naturall powers: and
therefore there is a spirituall
meane to be vsed for the obtayning
thereof, which the
Apostle reaches,Phil. 4. 6. saying; Let

your requests be shewed vnto
God in prayer.
                  Iam. 1. 5. And, Who so
lacketh wisedome, let him ask
of God, which giueth to al men
liberally, and reprocheth no
man, and it shall be giuen him.
This wisedome is not the
wisedome of the world, but
the knowledge how, when,
and what to ask, to conform
vs to the likenes of him that
hath begotten vs anew, who
hath left vs an example, that
wee should follow as deare
children. If then we be the
children of God,1. Pet. 2. 21. Eph. 5. 1. & Co-heirs
with him of that heauenly
Kingdom; shal we not with
him walke as becommeth
children of such a father?
Shal our head weepe and lament
for our sinnes? Shall be
suffer for our transgressions?
and shall wee laugh and reioyce

in the vanities of this
life, and yet think to partake
with Christ of his purchased
Kingdome? Hath he so farre
purchased for vs, as we need
neyther suffering nor patience,
faith nor prayer? Shall
we think our selues like that
vnspotted Lambe of God,
and yet defile our bodies &
soules by committing sinne
vpon sin? How can we then
come vnto our father which
is in heauen, where no profane
thing can haue any being?
If God heareth not sinners,
where shall the sinfull
mans prayers appeare? And
how can he haue his conuersation
in heauen, as S. Paul
had, or walke with God, as
Henoch did, whose soule and
spirituall part, which ought
to ascend by the wings of

faith towards heauē, is pressed
downe by a most vgly
and filthy dunghill the bodie,
clogged with the masse
of sinne? Cast off therefore
all carnall and vncleane affections,
purifie & clense your
hearts by liuely repentance,
that the sauing bloud of the
Lambe being sprinkled vpon
the dore posts of our beleeuing
hearts, the holy spirit
of God may enter, and
teach our spirits rightly to
crye Abba father. So shall
wee apprehend that sacred
renewing grace, that shall
breede this most sweet and
heauenly change, namely, to
make vs of the children of
wrath the children of loue,
of the children of disgrace
the childrē of glorie; which
change is not, nor can be

where faith faileth: which
faith is not obtained in respect
of our prayers, or any
desert of our selues, but only
and altogether of the free
fauor and good will of God
in Christ, in whō, for whom,
and by whom we haue promise
to obtaine the fulnesse
of spirituall contentment.

               God being wisedome it selfe,
knowes how to deal with vs
for our best aduantage and
his own glorie, which aboue
all things wee must respect
in all our prayers.
               GOd being wisedome it
selfe, knoweth better
then we what is fi
                     •
                  test for vs
to receiue, and for him to

giue; in both which his glorie
must goe with our desires,
as it will of necessitie
in his giuing. And if wee
seeke not his glory in all our
demands, we breake the order
prescribed, namely, to
doe all to the glorie of God:
much more then should our
prayers, which are the highest
seruice wee can doe vnto
God, tend to the honour of
his Maiestie, beyond the desire
of supply in our owne
necessities; and that is in
making our prayers vnto
him, to be confident that he
is iust, and will according to
his promise satisfie our iust
desires, so farre as may bee
most for our benefite. For
we cannot truly iudge what
is most expedient for vs: we
may aske for, and think that

best for vs, which God in his
wisedom knoweth most inconuenient;
and that to bee
hurtfull & euill for vs, which
hee seeth to be most for our
good. It is therefore agreeable
to the right rule of true
faith, to subiect our wills to
the wil of God, and to frame
all our petitions according
to the rule of his word, which
teacheth vs to aske corporal
things, with condition that
he be pleased therewith, and
spirituall & heauenly things
as the graces of the spirit,
with a full assurance to receiue.
And the more constant
and earnest we be, and
the more we presse God to
giue them,God is best pleased with f

                     ithfull & r
                        •
                     ligious importunitie. so much the
more it pleaseth him: as to
importune him to giue vs
power to mortifie our corrupt

affections to kill sinne,
both in our harts and members,
to begge the increase
of faith, obedience, loue towards
God and our neighbours,
peace in our selues
and with all men, patience in
suffering Gods corrections,
gentlenesse, meekenesse,
temperance. To aske these
absolutely and constantly, is
pleasing vnto God, is acceptable
vnto him: wherein yet
we are to beware that wee
aske not spirituall gifts to
carnal ends, as did Simon the
Magician; but to Gods glorie,
as Salomon asked wisedome.
For the holy Scriptures
teach vs, that God suffereth
many profane men to
vsurpe spiritual functions, as
preaching, prophecying, and
casting out Diuels, to whom

yet God w
                     ••
                  l say, Depart
from me, I know you not. The
like may be said of praying,
namely, of meere babling
with the tongue without the
consent of a feeling & faith
full heart. And in all these
to shew more outward sinceritie
then to haue inward
sanctity, is meere hypocrisie.

               Three principall motiues to
stirre vp men to pray, wherof
the chiefest is necessitie.
               THere bee three principall
motiues to stirre vp
Christians to prayer; first,
Gods commandement, Pray
continually, 1. Thess. 5. 17. secondly,
the promise, And ye
shall receiue, Matth. 7. 7. The

third and last motiue is our
owne necessities; and they
are infinite. Daniel prayed

                     •
                  o be preserued among the
Lyons; the three children
frō the fire; Hezekiah from
death; Ionah to bee deliuered
from the bowels of the
Whale: Susanna to be freed
from the vniust accusation
of the lasciuious and false
Iudges; Dauid to be deliuered
from the malice of Saul.
               
               
                  Necessitie hath so manie
branches,Necessitie hath many branches, and man hath no p
                        •
                     
                     wer to help himselfe in any. as men are subiect
to seuerall dangers, which
are infinit: and therefore a
motiue of great force; and
yet without Gods assistance
they can obtain no ease. For
the more a man strugleth to
free himselfe from any danger
by his owne power, hee
entangleth himselfe so much

the more, as the Flie in the
Spiders web, and the Bird in
the net: for of his owne naturall
inclination he hath no
more means to free himself,
be hee rich, befriended or
strong, then hath the beast
that perisheth. And therefore
God, to helpe his infirmitie,
hath louingly willed
him to come vnto him, with
a promise to helpe him:
which if God had not promised,
man could neuer haue
conceiued by his carnall vnderstanding,
that there had
beene any helpe in any inuisible
power. If God, with the
precept of praying continually,
had not made a couenant
to heare and graunt our
requests, wee should haue
held it a needlesse and an vnprofitable
worke to pray.

And did wee not beleeue
Gods promises to be Yea &
Amen, what necessitie could
moue vs to repair vnto him?
for without beleeuing the
promises we could haue no
hope to obtaine, and consequently
no desire to pray.
He then that obeyes not the
precept, to pray, breakes the
law of obedience: hee that
belieues not the promise can
not aske in faith; and consequently
the vnbeleeuer
obtains not, because
he asketh
amisse.

               The force of faith what it is,
and the effects of it; and
how dangerous a thing it is
to faint.
               SVch is the force and effect
of faith, as without it
nothing can be obtained at
the handes of God by prayer.
It is therefore necessary
for men to know what faith
is; which they may learn by
S. Pauls exhortation to the
Hebrewes, who declareth
that Faith is the ground of
things which are hoped for,
and the euidence of things
which are not seen. By which
definition it appeareth, that
the office of faith (if I may
so say) is to represent things
vnto our apprehensiō which

are not seene; & yet in confidence
to appeare as if they
alreadie were for such: and
so piercing are the beleeuers
eyes, as they behold the
things which they hope for
through the clouds & mists
of all difficulties. This did
most liuely appeare in the
faith of the Centurion, who
desired Christ to heale his
seruant; requiring nothing
of Christ towards the cure
but to speake the word only
and his seruant should bee
whole: and it came instantly
to passe as hee beleeued.
Such, and greater was the
faith of Abraham in leauing
his Countrey of Chaldae, to
come to Canaan at the cō
                  mandement
of God: as also
in offering his sonne, in whō
the promise was made. Many

examples are in holy
Scriptures, writtē by the holy
Ghost, and left vnto posterities,
to encourage Christians
so to depend on Gods
promises, as not to doubt of
good successe in most desperat
cases; but to rest so fully
assured that the euent shall
fall out to the best, as if hee
alreadie felt and enioyed the
same.
               Wonderfull things haue
beene done by the hands of
God,The wōderfull effects of faith, and how it fares with them that faint. through the firm faith
and faithfull prayer of his
children. As long as Moses
held vp his hands & prayed,
the Israelites for whom hee
prayed, preuailed: but when
he fainted, the Philistims, against
whom he prayed, had
the better. As long as Peter
beleeued stedfastly, he walked

steadily vpon the waters:
but when through a small
gale of winde he beganne to
wauer in his faith, to stagger
betweene confidence and
feare, he sunke. Wherein we
may note the force and frailtie
of the faith of the dearest
children of God, who beleue
constantly as long as all
things goe well with them:
but when a little tempest of
crosses and afflictions arise,
they beginne to faint. Iacob
although he had the immediat
promise, as at the mouth
of God himselfe after his
wrestling, that he shold preuaile
with men: when hee
heard that Esau was comming
to meete him with a
band of men, he was striken
with an extraordinary feare,
lest he should haue been vtterly

ouerthrown, his wiues
and children. They therfore
that stand, be they neuer so
confident in prosperitie,
ought to take heed they bee
not foiled in the time of aduersitie
through feare: for
the best are subiect to distrust
God when a little trouble
assaileth them. And yet
wee find by many examples
of godly men, that vpon deliberat
meditatiō they wade
through the most hard assaults
of whatsoeuer kinde:
for contrarie to their naturall
opinions of doubtfull
successe, faith workes a most
wished issue. The children
of Israel were in a most desperat
case, flying before furious
Pharoh and his vnresistable
Host, hauing on eyther
hand vnaccessible hills, and

before the man imp
                     •
                  ssable
Sea: so as if they looked before
them, there was no hope
in carnall reason to escape;
if behinde them, the sword
was at their backes; if on either
hand, they saw no euasion.
Yet beholde the force
and effect of faith, wherein
Moses the seruant of the
Lord encouraged them, saying,
Stand still feare not, but
behold the saluation of the
Lord this day. And so farre
preuailed hee with GOD
through faith and prayer, as
hee foresaw the destruction
of Pharoh and all his Host:
insomuch as he was bold to
affirme before it came to
passe, that this mighty Monarch,
and the multitude of
his armed men, his ho
                     •
                  ses &
chariots that they then law

and feared, they should see
all confounded before their
eyes; which came to passe.
The Lord (saith he) shall fight
for you, therefore holde ye your
peace, Exod. 14.
               Faithfull prayer is the
strongest meane by weakest
instruments,Prayer performeth greater things by weakest meanes, and incredulitie preuenteth most easie things. to performe
things of greatest difficulty.
The wals of Iherico a strong
Citie, were throwne downe
by no other sensible instruments
then the sound of
Trumpets made of Rammes
hornes, and the Citie and
people surprised with a smal
number of men. And there
is nothing more opposit to
the bringing of the greatest
and weightiest things to
passe then incredulity, which
commonly proceedeth from
natural reason; which many

times argueth impossibility
in possible, and possibility
in impossible things: As that
incredulous Samaritan gouernor,
who did so little beleeue
the Lords Prophet,
foretelling plentie vnto distressed
Samaria, saw with
his eyes the same thing com
to passe which hee thought
impossible; and for his vnbeleefes
sake was not onely
preuented of tasting of the
blessing, but was troden
to death by the
presse of the
people.

               Some among many preuaile
by their faithfull prayers
for the rest: and how God
turneth the prayers of his
to the best, though he grant
not what they desire: and
how foolishly carnall men
reason against Gods prouidence.
               IN causes publique, as in
the time of Warres, of Famine,
of Plague, or other
common calamitie; shal we
thinke that among a multitude
there are not some, yea
many that are faithful? howsoeuer
many also bee eyther
key-cold or luke-warme,
whō God respecteth not; yet
the faith & obedience of the
lesser number by their prayers

often appease God, and
(if I may so say) constraine
him to hold his handes from
punishing, and euen enforce
him to extend his hand to
relieue the whole for a part:
which we may obserue, if we

                  le
much with God. And
impietie it were to think the
contrarie. And as God blesseth,God blesseth and punisheth many for one.
so hee punisheth manie
for one: as the whole Host
of Israel for the trespasse of

                  Achan: yet we cannot but
confesse, that God in his wisdom
oftentimes concealeth
his purposes of shewing
mercie, or sending iudgements,
to make his dearest
children the more watchful,
and more earnest in prayer;
and in more and more hardening
vnbeleeuers hearts
to their deeper condemnation:God denieth what we aske, and giueth vs better in fleed.
and often delayeth the
granting of the requests of
his children, & giueth them
in stead some other thing
more fit, which they asked
not. He retayneth somtimes
things necessary in our opinions,
lest we shold presume
too much vpon his bountie
in giuing corporall things;
crossing our desires lest wee
should by the readie successe
build too much vpon our

vaine vnderstandings, as if
we knew rightly what were
good and what were ill, and
that we needed but to aske
and haue at the handes of
God, what we would:
               It is enough for the most
faithfull Christian to lay
downe his request before
God,It is enough for a Christian to referre the issue of his petitions
                        •
                      vnto God. to continue his oblation,
and to waite and attend
the leisure of God, and rest
content with his holy dispensation,
assuring himselfe
that not one thing only, but
all things whatsoeuer shall
worke to the best to them that
feare God.

               The faithfull man,The faithfull man exercised in prayer, findeth things succeed better then he expected. often
exercised in this diuine duty
of prayer, cannot but acknowledge
that things oftentimes
fall out better, and
succeed more to his comfort

and true consolatiō then he
required: not by chance (as
many most foolishly conceiue)
but by the meer mercie
and prouidence of God;
who as he granted vnto Salomon
more then hee asked,
so doeth hee euen in these
dayes to his obedient children.
And yet they cannot
truely obserue by any outward
or visible working
how it should so come to
passe: no deuice of their
own, nor instrument of their
owne procuring, working it
to their handes. God raised
Ionathan to loue Dauid, and
moued the Rauen to feed Eliah.

I do my selfe acknowledge
Gods vnsearchable
goodnesse and prouidence
to haue the chiefe place in
the working of infinit my

deliueries from many dangers,
and his relieuing me in
many and infinit wants. And
who so denieth that GOD
hath his working now, both
in mercie and in iustice, beyond
the naturall course or
operation of his creatures,
for the good of his children
and punishment of the wicked;
hath neither spirituall
vnderstanding nor true faith.
Such yet there are,The grosse opinion of some, who acknowledg no differēce between the godly and the wicked. whom I
haue heard to maintain that
they can obserue no difference
betweene the reputed
religious, and the supposed
Atheist: for they cannot see
but either of these haue their
fortunes alike: he that prayeth
hath no better, nor hee
that prayeth not the worse
share in this life; whereby
they raise an argument, that

all things succeed to all men
at all aduenture. Let a religious
man (willing to moue
a carnall man to serue God)
tell him what happy and wished
successe he hath had by
his prayers to God, & what
continuall comforts he findeth
thereby; how hee hath
beene deliuered from apparent
& iminent perils; how
he hath bin prouided for in
his greatest wants; how hee
hath escaped the things hee
feared, and how all things
worke to his good contentment:
will not the carnall
man say, Tush, this befalls all
men without respect of the ones
vertues or the others vices?
Will he not affirme that the
Cattell, Corne, and all earthly
blessings fall as well vpon
the Drunkard, Whoremonger,

Blasphemer, and whatsoeuer
irreligious, as vpon
the most zealously religious,
and deuout person? And do
they not hereby shew that
in their hearts they say, that
either there is no God, or
that he is a God that maketh
no difference betweene the
good and the euill, between
the religious & profane, betweene
the faithfull and the
infidell? Yet indeede it cannot
bee denied but God in
mercie keepeth vnder his
children whom he will saue,
exercising them with fatherly
crosses, and gentle corrections,
and in iustice permitteth
the Reprobate to haue
their portions in the fulnesse
of pleasures and delights of
this life. But who so obserueth
the ends of both, cannot

but see the carnall man
leaue this life with horror,
and his goods with griefe:
and the other in peace; who
expiring his last breath, recommends
his soule into the
hands of God, aspiring in a
liuely faith vnto the Kingdome
promised, with most
holy and heauenly alacritie.

               The naturall man misconceiueth
of true happinesse,
whereby hee runneth into
many absurdities by the
suggestion of Sathan.
               THe sottishnes of mans
nature, and mans misconceiuing
of good and euil
things, is such, as it thinketh
nothing heauenly but pleasure

and profit, nothing to
befal by a diuine prouidence
but by chance, and therfore
they that pray or pray not
are equally rich, strong, wittie,
healthfull, and alike happie.
Oh more then blind ignorance,
palpable Atheisme,
peruerting the harts of men,
supplanting Religion, and
quenching faith, condemning
prayer the prop of all
mens happines, which without
faith is yet of none effect.
               Infinit are the absurdities
whereinto such as know not
God plunge themselues:Men not fearing God run into many absurdities, by the suggestion of Sathan. for
being once ledde out of the
way, which is Christ, they
cannot but follow Sathan.
For there are but two principall
spirituall powers that
haue dominion ouer al men,

and they haue their seuerall
Kingdomes, opposit as light
and darkenesse, truth & falshood,
heauen and hell. And
as their Dominions are spirituall,
so leade they their subiects
spiritually; the one by
grace, to the performance of
all spirituall dueties in heauenly
obedience; the other
by all possible illusions, deceits,
and spirituall wickednesse
in this corporall life.
This latter gaineth more mē
by his plausible suggestions,
then Christ by his true and
infallible word: the reason
is, for that he first preuayled
to betray man, euen the father
of men, by whom and
in whom all men by nature
are subiect to the same falling
from God who made
him, to the diuell that seduced

him. And no maruell
thogh he lay baits to betray
vs now, hauing so long practised
his treacheries, & preuailed
so much, leading men
into a thousand by-wayes:
he careth not how menwalk
so they follow not Christ:
hee cannot beare with patience,
that men should beleeue
the promises of God in
Christ, nor his threats for disobedience,
and for not belieuing
the Gospel of Christ.
And therefore casteth hee a
mist before the eies of mens
vnderstandings, that they
may not apprehend Gods
mercies towards them that
doe well, nor his iudgments
towards them that doe euill.
But as GOD cast Adam
in a slumber when hee
tooke out his ribbe to make

a woman; so doth he couet
to lull men asleepe when he
purposeth to steale their
hearts from GOD to make
them reprobates. And as he
turneth himselfe into an Angell
of light; so hee turneth
all his plausible allurements
to the confusiō of them that
consent, by suggesting them
good: he deludeth men by
the counterfeit imitation of
Christ himselfe, as by fained
fastings, voluntarie penurie,
wilfull idlenesse, and causeth
men to reclude themselues
thereby to merit saluation;
leauing the world before the
time, and to become vnprofitable
members of Church
or Common-wealth: hee
preuenteth true, faithful and
cordiall prayer, by prayers
in a strange language, & vttered

without vnderstāding
or feeling: he maketh men
to misconceiue of all Gods
threats, and tokens of his indignation;
as when God
sendeth tokens of his anger
for sinne, eyther in or by the
ayre by supernaturall exhalations
and extraordinarie
apparitiōs, as of late he hath
done by fierie inflamations
and bloudie euaporations;
by the extraordinary rage of
the windes, causing the Seas
to surmount the bounds, making
fearful inundations vpon
the land, to the destruction
of men and multitudes of
beasts, and most lately to the
confusion of many ships and
men, cast away vpon diuers
coasts: when he sends these
vnusuall distemperatures of
seasons, scarcitie of food, famine,

plague, or war; when
he fireth the Towns and Cities
round about vs: this deceiuer
saith vnto the hearts
of carnall men, and suggesteth
vnto them that all these
things are natural, comming
of causes ordinarie; and idle
it is, and sauoring of a needlesse
feare, to thinke they are
forerunners of greater danger:
whereby hee holdeth
men in continuall security,
and a weening that al is wel,
and that God is not displeased
with our coldnesse in religion,
with our rebellions,
transgressions, and intollerable
sinnes: which is the cause
that men liue so carelesly &
so backwardly in seruing of
God, holding preaching vnprofitable
and prayer fruitlesse,
neuer giuing GOD

thankes for his mercies, nor
fearing his iudgements.

               Englands many blessings and
deliueries are not so duely
considered, nor so thankefully
embraced as they
ought, being too much ascribed
to humane & carnall
meanes, which breedes
ingratitude and securitie.
               IT cannot but seem strange
(I thinke) to all that haue
but common (but especially
to such as haue diuine) vnderstanding,
that England
hauing receiued at the hands
of God so many and most
wished blessings, both in
giuing vs good things, and

preuenting vs of euill; and
that farre beyond the apprehension
of the wisest worldly
man, should so generally
forget themselues, as if they
were so familiar and ordinarie
as were worthy of no admiration:
the reason is, as
before is said, wee cannot
perswade our selues they be
the wonderfull workes of
God.
               Queene Elizabeths many
and strange deliueries and
ours in her; the more then
admirable ouerthrow of the
Spanish inuincible-reputed
Nauie; the discouery of so
many plots and complotments
of treasons and conspiracies;
were they by
chance, or was God the Author
of them? Indeed some
haue endeuoured to ascribe

the praise to carnall meanes,
and to rob God of the honor
thereof, by attributing
the discoueries vnto humane
wisedome, and the ouerthrow
of the Spanish Nauie
to our owne arme, neyther
of them due to either; for it
was God that gaue the
means, and blessed them for
our safetie: and as working
instruments vnder God, they
are to be embraced. But to
say that if such a man had
not taken such a course, such
a plot had not beene discouered:
if such an accidēt had
not falne out, or such a stratagem
beene inuented, and
put in practise, the successe
had not beene so good; is to
attribute the power of doing
the miracles in Egypt to
Moses rod & not to God. Wo

to him that excludeth Gods
prouidence of the issue of
these things, as Esay saith,Esa. 31. 
                  Wo
vnto them that goe downe into
Egypt for helpe, and stay vpon
Horses, and trust in Chariots
because they are many, and in
Horse-men because they are
very strong; but they looke not
to the holy One of Israel, nor
seeke vnto the Lord who is wisest.

A man were better to holde
his peace when things are
done not to be redeemed, be
they done with or against
his will, then to applie this
doubtful word If. For it hath
onely force to condemne his

ignorance and to commend
Gods prouidence, in whose
dispensation are mercie and
iudgement; the first obtayned,
the second auoyded by
faithful praier. And the most
that can bee spoken of humane
wisedome and prouidence
in such cases of eminent
consequence, is, that
God vouchsafed vnto such a
man the reason to apprehēd
such or such dangers, and to
vse such and such meanes to
preuent them; as in Ioseph in
foreseeing the plentie, and
prouiding for the dearth:
but to say it came immediatly
from the naturall apprehension
of any mortall creature,
to worke the good or
to preuent the euill of a Nation,
Prouince, Citie, Familie,
or priuat man; were to

affirme that God is not vniuersally
omnipotent, & absolutely
prouident, and consequently
that to pray vnto
him were both needlesse &
fruitlesse, which were the
highest degree of impietie,
and is onely found in them
that know not God. And
therefore it behoueth Christians
to be truely watchful,
and duly conuersant in praier;
so shall nothing succeed
vnto them, but either to
their approued good or tolerable
euill, wherein he shal
be thankfull for the first, and
patient in the second; knowing
that nothing cometh
to passe by chance, or at aduenture,
but by God, who
worketh all in all. I am the
Lord, and there is none other;
I forme the light,
                  Esa. 45. 
                  and create

darkenesse; I make peace and
create euill, saith the Lord.Ingratitude will rise in iudgement against vs.
               
               Nothing therefore will
rise vp in iudgement against
vs in a higher degree then
ingratitude, receiuing so many
continuing blessings at
Gods handes, & yet to shew
not onely no thankfulnesse,
but in stead to become the
more rebellious, stubborne,
and stiffe-necked, adding sin
to sin, and heaping vp transgression
vpon transgression,
as it were with greedinesse;
neuer regarding the manifolde
dangers that doe palpably
houer ouer our heads,
but as men drunken with
new wine, we lie secure euerie
man in his particular sensualitie,
seldome or neuer repayring
vnto God in praier.
But let vs awake and consider

in what drowsinesse we
pass our peace, making it the
feast of our bewitching delights,
giuing God neither
thāks for good receiued, nor
stand
                     •
                  ng in fear of his iudgments
threatned. And let vs
ruminate a little vpon our
duties, and then can wee not
but finde that our neglect of
hearing God speaking to
vs, and our seldome & colde
speaking vnto him in thankfulnesse
and prayer, will tell
vs that wee are falne into a
fearefull and mortall Lethargie.
               Are the mercies of God
rightly considered,We forget Gods goodnesse in giuing vs worthiest King Iames
                   and duly
weighed in giuing vs our
good Iosiah, worthiest King
Iames, for establishing him
in the steed of our deceased
Deborah, & with and in him

the vse and continuance of
true religion, and that without
bloud? Doe not all the
Kingdomes of Europe admire
& stand amased at our
happinesse in our blessed Soueraigne?
And can his Maiesties

cōsidered? How

that so long lay couerd
with so many difficulties,
the arrow being drawn as it
were to the head before the
string was broken, ayming
not only to hit the Lords anointed,
and royall family, the
Nobles, Counsellors of state,
the Bishops and worthiest of
all parts of the land; but at
an instant, in a moment, the
vtter ruine, subuersion and

confusion of all estates, degrees,
qualities, and people
of all conditions: howsoeuer
suggested an infranchisement
to pretended Catholikes;
euen many of them
also had tasted the same cup
of extirpatiō with the more
loyally affected, and more
religiously disposed. The
plot was laide by the policie
of Sathan, practised by his
members, discouered by
God himselfe, who reueiled
the same vnto his annointed
without humane intimation
of the thing what, the place
where, the persons by whom
it was to be performed. This
for the present was wonderful
in euery mans eyes: men
for a time lifted vp their
hands as it were to God, tokening
thankefulnesse: but

it seemed to bee but like a
splending sunne, that shined
for a while with glorious acknowledgeing
that it was
the very hand of God: but
now eclipsed with the cloud
of forgetfulnesse: somtimes
it falls ouer the Pulpit into
the eares, but seldome into
the hearts, nor considered
according to the worth of so
worthy a deliuerance. Moses
erected stones in memoriall
of the Israelites deliuerie
from Pharoh, to shew to
posterities what God had
done for them, and to testifie
their thankfulnesse to God:
but it seemeth that we haue
turned our fleshly hearts into
stones, to testifie our ingratitude,
and to witnesse against
vs how little we feare
future dangers. For were

these former fauours of God
written in our hearts, could
our tongues cease so long
from praising God? should
we not be still mindfull of it,
& be stirred vp to mixe with
our thankefulnesse prayer;
that as hee hath vouchsafed
to discouer and preuent so
horrible treasons, so it might
please him to worke for vs
against all Antichristian future
complotments, &
Sathanicall stratagems?
            
            
               
               CHAP. XXII.
               The Church of Christ militāt,
and Sathans Church malignant,
seek the ouerthrow
one of the other, but by contrary
meanes: and that all
Christians are to pray for
the defence of the first,
without which it is to bee
feared it may suffer violence.
               AS long as God hath in
this kingdom a church
militant, it will not be auoyded,
but here will Satan haue
his Church malignant: and
these cannot but be so opposite
the one to the other,
as the one wisheth not the
other to stand. The first seeketh
the conuersion of the
second by gentle and Christian

endeuours, by perswading
according to the rule
of Christ, praying for them
in loue, lifting vp no hand, no
sword, no weapon of offence;
onely the sword of
iustice for Treasons, Treacheries,
and Conspiracies against
the King and Kingdom:
wherin if there should
bee no iustice inflicted, it
could not but embolden &
propagate more and more
insolencie and boldnesse to
execrable attempts; so
should the sword of the Magistrate
be censured a partie
of selfe-danger and confusion.
But the last seeketh the
confusion of the first by treasons,
treacheries, conspiracies,
massacres, bloud, nay
by killing of Kings, and by
whatsoeuer inhumane, vnnaturall

and hellish attempt.
Iudge ye therefore, iudge ye
that giue aime to either, yee
that gaze vpon the controuersie,
and are indifferent;
whether of these is likest
Christ and his Church; the
first that neuer foiled hand
in bloud vnder the pretence
of Religion; or that which
hath no other meanes to
support it, but the bloud of
Princes, and confusion of
people? Is there any so blear
eyed that distinguisheth not
the difference? let him pray
that God will open his eyes;
for flesh and bloud teacheth
it not.As the cause of the Church is generall, so should our prayers be generall.
               
               Now therfore as the cause
of the Church militant is generall,
and her danger vniuersall;
so are, or ought to
be the prayers of euery mē
                  ber

both in publique and
priuate generall, as well for
the whole as for part: these
prayers haue the promise of
defence, of protection, and
freedome, that whatsoeuer
succeedeth shall bee for the
best. By meanes of which
prayers, though the successe
suddenly at all times appeareth
not, God is moued to
haue a watchfull eye, and to
extend a protecting hand ouer
his people: and that was
it that defended Queene Elizabeth,
and that suffered
not King Iames to be surprised
by the conspiracie of
Gowrie, nor the treasonable
plot of powder to take effect:
for many saithfull harts
among infinite, are doubtlesse
daily lifted vp to God
for his protection. And although

they foresee not the
dangers, God preuenteth
them through the prayers of
his little flocke, made vnto
him in generall in the name
of his Christ. And impious it
were to affirme that these
dangers haue beene preuented,
and our deliueries
wrought by chaunce, without
Gods prouidence and
working.
               Where God then is not
continually solicited,wher praier is neglected, there cannot but follow punishment. as well
in priuate by his Saints, as in
publique by visible assemblies;
there cannot but follow
some correction, and
that vpon Gods owne peculiar
people, for the neglect
of calling vpon God; & his
iudgements vpon the contemners
of this holy duetie,
Prayer: and it is to be feared

that GOD hath beene enforced
to come down to see
whether the coldenesse of
prayer and the crie of our
sinnes bee according to the
vnpleasing sauour, which is
ascended from vs into his
presence, be so or not. Let vs
repent, let vs turn vnto God
and humble our selues in
sack cloth and ashes, in a true
and religious conuersion,
in faith & prayer
vnfained.
            
            
               
               CHAP. XXIII.
               The death of the late Prince
is not lightly to bee forgotten,
nor our general praiers
for his Maiestie and royall
issue to bee neglected publiquely
and in priuate: for
prayer auaileth much being
feruent.
               DOe wee lightly passe ouer,
or little consider
that God hath depriued vs
of the Anchor of our hope, a
corner stone of his spirituall
building in earth? the second
piller of his Church?
May we not think that God
foresaw him likely to proue
too good to goe in and out
before so vnthankfull a people?
Although hee preserue
vnto vs, and for vs, our most

worthy of Kings. Let vs not
thinke it is for our deserts,
but for his loues sake to his
Annointed and our Soueraigne,
for his mercies sake
vnto his Church. Therefore
let vs abandon sinne, let vs
retire our selues to him that
calleth vs, let vs lift vp our
voyces in praises and praier,
that The holy one of Israel
wil be pleased to blesse the K.
& the Kings son of his English
Israel, in whose prosperitie
he hath (as it were) included
our safetie. There are a multitude
of Sinners, let a multitude
of sighes bee speedily
sent forth before the decree
of his iudgements be sealed
against vs; let vs send forth
the Doue of true contrition
out of the Arke of our repenting
hearts: it may bring

vs the Oliue branch of reconciliation
and peace with
God.
               Prayer preuenteth perils:
and howsoeuer some misconceiue,
that there are but
few truely religious & faithfully
zealous; yet no doubt
God hath his seuen, yea seuentie
thousand that cease
not to solicite him, not only
in publique, but in their priuate
clossets; not for themselues
alone, but for the king,
kingdome, & people, whose
praiers haue promise to preuaile.
And therefore it cannot
be said that the prayers
of the faithfull are either
none, or few, or little, or not
auaileable, as some men
thinke, because (as they affirme)
they respectiuely precede
not euery vnknown or

vndiscouered danger. As if
God knew not whereof Nations,
Kingdomes, and people
haue neede, eyther of
things wanting to be supplied,
or things dangerous to
be preuented. If he be truly
called vpon in one danger,
he deliuereth from many▪ as
if in Famine a people bee relieued
by their faithfull praiers
vnto God, hee in regard
of their humiliation and repentance,
doth free them frō
the plague, which hee purposed
should haue followed
the Famine; and of Warres
that should haue followed
the Famine and Plague. As
he did with the people of Samaria,
whom he did not only
relieue with plentie after
their famine; but from their
enemies also. And this holdeth

not in generall multitudes
only, but with priuate
men fearing and faithfully
seruing GOD in constant
perseuerance.
            
            
               CHAP. XXIV.
               Deuotion lately hote is now
become more colde, which
may presage some consequent
danger: but the practise
of the word and prayer
preuaileth with God;
the neglect whereof maketh
men senselesse of sinne.
               IT is to be lamented to obserue
how the coldnes of
Christian deuotion encreaseth,
especially considering
how zeale flourished within
these few yeares, and how
fruitfully it wrought in the

hearts of many; insomuch
as there seemed a kinde of
religious emulation in yong
and old, who could be most
forward in hearing the word
preached in the Churches, in
reading the same, and praying
together, not only in the
Church, but also in their Families:
but now many are
slack in that Christian duty,
and some hold it a sufficient
seruice of God to visite the
Church once a weeke on the
Sabbath day, to heare the
word, to conioyne in concluding
the ordinary prayers,
saying Amen; and somtimes
to receiue the outward
signes of the Sacraments,
neglecting in the
meane time to meditate vppon
the word of God which
they haue heard, to confirm

the beleeuers faith. And faith
begetteth all other graces, &
especially prayer, which preuaileth
with God aboue all
other duties if it be feruent,
and is as it were the life of al
other vertues, the life & mouing
of the soule. The neglect
whereof may bee well
compared to the foolishnes
of a man voluntarily staruing
himselfe: for as the neglect
of moderate receiuing food
doeth by degrees macerate,
and in fine consume the bodie,
and it perisheth; so the
contempt of prayer workes
in the soule a loathing of the
word, whereon vnlesse the
soule doe feed, it cannot but
wax feeble in faith, the want
whereof is the absolute confusion
of the soule: which (as
the Fish cannot liue out of

the water, the Salamander
out of the fire, nor the Camelion
out of the ayre) cannot
liue out of it owne element
the word of God, by which
it was created; & the word
profits not without meditation
and praier, hearing, reading,
and often ruminating
the same. For as the seede
sown, though in a good soil,
if it haue not the former and
latter raine, it will not grow
to perfection: so the word
vnlesse it bee watered as it
were by continuall practise
and prayer, fructifieth not,
although the carnall man,
growing from ill to worse,
feeleth it not, nor findes how
he decayeth, but as one in a
consumption dieth spiritually.
The regenerate man by
the Word, the Sacraments,

and Prayer, perceiueth in
himselfe a daily increase of
liuely effects, working in his
heart more and more assurance
that all things shall
worke together for the best
in this life, and after this life
his endlesse glorie. Moreouer
the spirituall man apprehendeth
in himselfe the lest
motion of sinne: hee perceiueth
when the flesh or his
corrupt thoughts begin to
rebell in the least measure, &
then beginneth hee to encounter
them by abstinence
and prayer. But the carnall
man sold vnder sinne,The carnall man feeleth not sinne to be sinne. is of another
more obdurate temper;
hee feeleth nothing to
be sinne. But as a man may
make what corosiue or incision
he will in a dead member
without feeling or pain,

as in a gangrine, or the like;
so when the soule of a man
is dead in sinne, and his conscience
seared vp, nothing
can be felt to be sinne. Contrarily,
as the least pricke of
the point of a needle annoieth
the liuely flesh: so the
least prick of Sathans temptations
is felt and auoyded
by the regenerate man.
            
            
               CHAP. XXV.
               Beasts foreseeing, flye danger
more then reasonable men
besorted with securitie and
the pleasures of this life.
               THere is no creature in
the world so dul and insensible,
but can foresee, and
by natures instinct end
                     •
                  uor
to preuent and flie danger:

and yet a carnall man, endowed
with reason, oftentimes
runneth wilfully into
his owne ruine. As while
he with the foolish flie soareth
about the vaine pleasures
of this world, scorcheth
the wing
                     •
                   of diuine obedience,
and falleth into endlesse
destruction: He may be
compared to Esops Hart,
who while hee beheld his
beautifull head in the water,
forgetting the perrils
which follow securitie, is
suddenly surprised by death,
euen while hee is foolishly
admiring his owne vaine
pride and worldly delights,
in the glasse of vulgar admiration.
Such men therefore
that thus loose themselues
in the wood of worldly contentments,
seldome or neuer

finde the Temple to pray in
with profit, but for fashion,
and depart not iustified at all
but rather condemned.
               When theeues assaile,Man is enemie to himselfe, permitting the house of his soule to be robbed. or
enemies approch to beleager
a Citie, euery man betakes
him to his weapons;
and he that endeauours not
to preuent the danger, cannot
but be held an enemie.
How stands it then with vs
who haue permitted the
house of our soules to bee
robbed? Are wee not enemies
to our owne soules?
The pleasures of the world
& the lusts of the slesh haue
stolne away our hearts from
the liuing God: the vanities
of our minde the riches and
pleasures of the world, and
the pride of life, haue not only
besieged, but entred and

surprised our vnderstandings
& captiuated our wils:
they haue depriued vs of our
defensiue weapons, stript vs
of our spirituall ornaments:
they haue disarmed vs of the
sword of the Spirit, taken
from vs the shield of faith, the
buckler of patience, despoyled
vs of the brest-plate of
righteousnesse, and the helmet
of saluation haue they defrauded
vs of. Thus haue our
theeuish delights and our enemies
(sinnes of all sortes)
dealt with vs, and yet such is
our sottish & senselesse condition,
as being left naked
of all goodnes wee feele not
our owne euils; and therefore
few or none thus falne
couet to rise: all, or the most
are so ouer-mastered by the
old, as they couet not the

new man, that is shaped in
holinesse and righteousnes.
Who laboureth to become
wise in the Lord? But contrarily
it is com to passe, that
euery sort of sinners presume
to defend their vices.Men are become defenders of their grossest sinnes. A man
cannot bee a good fellow
(saith the Drunkard) and be
merrie (swinish) with his
friend, but hee is censured a
beast. A man cannot shape
his apparell (saith the Peacock
like proude man) and
fashion his garments in cost
and colours as other proper
men doe, but he is held to be
vaine and proud. A man cannot
shew his valorous spirit
(saith the swaggerer) in the
braue termes of a Souldier,
but he is termed a Blasphemer.
A man in the heate of
his wantonnesse (saith the

Whoremonger) cannot lie
with a woman but hee must
be branded with the mark of
a lasciuious person: a

                  d so
lying, stealing, swearing, forswearing,
bribery, extortion,

pretexts with wicked men.

metamorphosed,The strange metamorphosis of some men of this age, to be lamented. some into

qualities of the most vile and
abhorred creatures, and yet

will bee readie to raile vpon
and reuile him that shall reproue
them, and endeuor to
reforme them. They will affirme
that they are as sure of
saluation as the best of a
thousand; that according to

               Can the tongues of men
and Angels prophesie what
will becom of this obdurate
age?None can foretell what will become of this obdurate age. or can they with all
their spirituall eloquence &
diuine gifts, by deliuering
Gods mercies, or denouncing
his iudgments, reclaim
these bewitched men? Can
any crosse, vexation, misery,
or calamitie worke in them
contrition & returning vnto
God by repentance and
prayer? The God of this

world hath blinded them;
they see not their owne errours,
nor foresee their dangers,
nor feele their own miseries.
Neyther can the promises
of heauens glorie, nor
the threats of hells torments
asswage the heat of their rebellions
against God. Peace
and plentie, health and securitie,
shaddowes of true happinesse,
argue against these
men, that they say in their
hearts by their deedes, that
there is no cause of feare.
But when danger approcheth,
we will pray (say they)
and prouide meanes to preuent
the perill; why should
curious Preachers seeke to
torment vs before the time?
Who can denie, but all wicked
men say thus in their
hearts by the fruits of their

liues? denying God (as it
were) to be God, his promises
to bee true, or his
threats of any force; faith to
be but an idle conceit, and
prayer a fruitlesse labour.
            
            
               CHAP. XXVI.
               If Gods word cannot awake vs,
he will send his rod to correct
vs, and nothing can appease
him but our humiliation
and prayer, and not the
glorie of our vaine-glorious
pride.
               IT behooueth vs to bee
warie and watchfull in
prayer: and sith the Trumpet
of Gods word cannot awake
these deafe Snakes, the
rod of his iudgements cannot
bee farre off: for drunkennes

is intollerable, pride
abhominable, blasphemie
horrible.
               And God (it is to be feared)
hath entred a plaint against
vs,God hath a iudgement against vs for sinnes. and summoned vs
by his Ministers to answere;
and by default of our appearing
submissiuely before
him, & appealing vnto him,
hee hath determined to punish
our offences: albeit he
hath long forborne vs, according
to his nature of being
patient and long suffering.
But let vs know that he
is iust, and if wee agree not
with him quickly, hee being
our aduersarie too mightie
for vs, wee cannot but looke
for the Sergeant, who will
deliuer vs to the Iudge, the
Iudge to the Gaoler, and he
cast vs into prison, there to

remaine without baile or
maine-prise, neuer to be released.
               How shall we then make
league with this offended
God?God will not be appeased by any carnall meanes. Shall wee flatter him
as the Pharisie did? Shall we
bribe him as Sathan would
haue done? Shall we threaten
him as Senacherib presumed?
The first was reproued,
the second repulsed, the
third confounded. What can
then appease his displeasure?
Onely repentance. Not as
Pharoh seemed; but as the
Niniuites did. Dauid and
Peter are patternes of true
returning to God, and are
examples for offēding Christians
to follow.God wil not put his cause to be determined by man.
               
               God is not as man: hee
putteth not the controuersie
which hee hath against man

to be tried by man. Althogh
hee recommended the quarrell
which he had against the
rebellious Israelites to bee
considered, but not to be determined,
by man, he put the
case to man by way of agrauation
of their disobediēce,
but reserued both the iudgement
and punishment to
himselfe; affirming, that if
Moses & Elias, Abraham &
Iob should stand vp and pray
for such a rebellious people,
they should but saue themselues.
His wrath being enkindled,
yea but a litle, none
can abide or endure it: but
beeing highly incensed against
a people, or peculiar
person, it is most hard to appease
him. For he will be auenged
on him on whom he
will be auenged. There is no

attonement to bee made
with him but by serious and
true repentance, no pardoning
without faith & faithfull
prayer. People, Nations,
Tongues and Men offending
him, must soone repent
or perish. The glory of
Belteshasher, the fury of Pharoh,
the pride of Nehu

                     hadnezzer,
the vaine-glory of
Herod, the high mind of Haman,
the policie of Achitophel
preuailed not against
God: but the poore offending
Publican falling on his
face praying pardon, obtaytained
it. And this, and none
other way (submission and
prayer) appeaseth our offended
God. Kingdoms, Countries,
Cities, Parishes, Families,
and priuat men must by
true humiliation and faithful

prayer obtaine remission.

                  ised
by Sathan, the deformities
of men and women,
appease God?The deformities of mens and womens attires. The pride &
insolencie of these times so
farre exceede the pride and
insolency of old, as the greatest
of the sonnes of Anaek
exceeded the meanest Pigmey
in stature and strength.
Our men & women are becom
robbers of all Nations:
neuer Camelion changed his
colour as wee doe our sutes
& fashions of changing varieties.
It is a high dignity
to holde one fashion two
moneths, or to weare one
weede two dayes. Surely
howsoeuer they may please
the eie of their fauorites, and

delight their owne foolish
fantasies, God is not pleased
with their fashions or fansies.
They studie not the
word, the sauing truth; but
the word of euery new and
vpstart stuffe: and their praier
is seldome or not at all to
God, but to the monster-maker,
to fit their attire netely
& of a new or the newest
cut, that came last out of the
Diuels shop. Husbands must
dis-mannor and dis-money
themselues to make their
wiues to glitter in the
world. Esdras declareth
what the excesse of these
presageth, Many miseries &
calamities (saith he) remaine
for them that shall liue in the
latter time, because they shall
walke in great pride. 2. Esd. 8.
50. Doth not God by Esay
                  
threaten the people for the
arrogancie and pride of the
women? Because the daughters
of Sion (saith hee) are
haughtie and walk with stretched
out necks, and with wandering
eyes, walking and minsing
as they goe, and making
a tinckling with their feete;
therefore shall the Lord make
the heads of the daughters of
Sion balde. Looke into the
third of this prophecie, and
behold as in a glasse the end
of your pride: change your
glasse of wantonnesse, and
lay it by a while, and looke
into the word of God, which
shall better discouer your
beautie or deformitie by far
then your materiall glasses.
And if you finde your sures
to sute well with the word,
weare them; and where you

haue now an inch take an ell
of excesse, and still the more
happy shall ye be: but if you
find them contrary vnto the
word of God, cast them off
from you, Many execrations
hath God denoūced against
this sinne of sinnes,Pride more to be abhorred then the Diuell to be feared. this mother-sinne,
the original cause
of our fall, and the cause of
his fall that caused our fall:
and therfore more to be abhorred
(if I may so say) then
the Diuel himself; but more
to be feared, I dare speak, thē
the Diuell himselfe, for that
he may be resisted by faith.
But Pride entertained, with
it is couertly entertained
him that seekes to confound
as many as entertaine him:
Pride once possessing the
heart, and the heart embracing
this vnholy habite, looseth

all faculties that should
expresse loue or obedience
to God or men: for it is so
fraught with idle and vnholy
affections, as faith in God,
loue towards God, and praier
to God haue no place in
the vnderstanding, neyther
agree they with that will
that Pride possesseth. Light
and darkenesse, sinne and
sanctitie, humilitie and pride
of life neuer concurre in one
mind. Let then the sword of
ciuill iustice vnsheath to cut
downe this and other grosse
sinnes and common enormities.
What an infinite
masse of treasure is spent vpon
silkes, and vanishing ornaments?
and the most of it
within one yeare cast to the
dunghill: euery man exceedeth,
and yet the lawes inhibit

it. If the law of right religion
bare rule in our harts,
as we would be seen to professe
it with our lips, no law
of seueritie needed to curbe
our excesse. But it seemeth
the law of true loue to God
is not written in, or is blotted
out of our hearts, wee regard
the law of man so litle.
And yet the Iewes in their
best loue were not better beloued
of the Lord, then wee
haue been; to whom according
to the greatnesse of his
loue, he freely gaue his greatest
blessings, opening (as it
were) the doore of the Treasure-house
of his goodnesse to
vs, which hee shut against
many other Nations,As God hath loued vs, so must we loue him againe. & gaue
vs free libertie to take and
vse the most pretious Iewels
of his loue his Word and Sacraments.

And as hee gaue
vnto Salomon with his wisedome,
riches and honor: so
hee gaue vnto vs with Religion
peace and plentie: and
so deare and precious was
his word vnto vs for a time
                     •
                  
as men sought it with greater
perill then Dauids men
fetcht water for him with
the danger of their liues; and
many sealed their loue vnto
it with their dearest bloud:
which wo
                     •
                  d we still enioy as
touching the freedom of the
vse, but the fruits wee produce
do rather argue a carelesse
neglect then a constant
embracing thereof in verie
many. No maruell therefore
if wee disobey man in
breach of the ciuill institutions,
sith wee so little regard
the lawes of God. But shall

we recompence God for his
blessings so manifold with
such a high hand of vnthankfulnesse?
            
            
               CHAP. XXVII.
               The bringing in of true Religion
was of great difficultie,
effected by God by his
instruments; wee must beware
lest we neglect it, and
so loose it againe.
               THe rooting out of Idolatrie
in the time of K.
Henry the eight, was an attempt
of highest difficultie;
the state of the time then cō
                  sidered,
wherin few or none
durst open their mouthes against
the grossest errours of
the Synagogue of Rome:
but God stirred vp the King,

and gaue him courage, and
withall stroke the strongest
aduersaries with such a fear,
and enfeebled their powers
so, as they durst not lift vp
their tongues or handes against
that which God had
decreed to bring to paste for
our saluation. Hee opened
the bookes of his owne will
vnto vs, the olde and new
Testaments, which were before
shut vp vnder the locke
of an vnknowne language.
The word was freely preached
and read, the Sacraments
truly administred, and
the diuine seruice of God
truly solemnized, vntill God
againe, to trie whether it
were truely embraced or fainedly
professed, shut vp the
books again for a time,In the time of Q Marie. that
none could partake of the

truth, nor publish his allowance
thereof by word or
work but it cost him his life,
yet continued the light to
shine euen in darkenesse, albeit
it was still sought to be
quenched by the death of
many most worthy Martyrs,
whose deaths gaue life againe
to the light, and it resplended,
and faith & praier
beganne againe in strength,
to giue glorie to God that
had so wonderfully brought
a mat
                     •
                  er of that difficulty to
passe, euen by his owne power:
the diuell roared, the
enemies raged all in vaine;
God protected his people,
and ledde them by that gracious
Queene, and by his
godly Ministers,Q. Eliz. as by the
hands of Moses and Aaron,
and now by preuayling

                  Ioshuah, vnder whom, & by
whose wisedome, pietie, and
diuine vertues, if we resume,
retaine, and practise our first
loue, if we bring forth the effectuall
fruits of that true religion
we seeme to professe,
we shall yet liue and possesse
the word, maugre the Diuell
and his instruments. But if
we waxe cold in our profession,
if the Word become
loathsome and harsh vnto
vs, if we thinke the sacred sacraments
needlesse, and holy
prayer fruitlesse; then will
God assuredly depriue vs of
our glorie, hee will remoue
the Arke of the couenant as
from a gracelesse and most
vnworthy people, and place
it with a Nation that neuer
heard of it. And we that haue
beene so long and wonderfully

admired for our Religion,
more generally & more
freely and truely professed
then in any Kingdom of the
world, haue been more plentifully
blessed, and more powerfully
defended by God
against so many and strong
enemies, shall become a
by-word to al neibour-Nations.
            
            
               
               CHAP. XXVIII.
               God loueth vs no more then
the Turkes and Pagans, if
we liue like Turks and Pagans:
our manifold Idoll-gods:
the carnall mans sophistrie:
the long vse of the
word, hath made vs weary
of the word: nothing can
preuent danger but repentance
and prayer.
               WEe may not thinke
that God is more in
loue with vs then with the
Turk, nor respecteth vs more
then the Pagan, if we hauing
the Gospell, liue like the
Turke, and professing Religion
liue like the Pagan. It
is a sweete contentment to
bee in the protection of the
liuing God; but most feare

full to fall into his handes.
Wee haue beene long in the
first, let vs beware lest we fall
into the second: these differ
as much as doe mercie and
iudgement, life and death,
heauen and hell, Christ and
Mahomet: in the first we obey
in the second we rebell:
in the first we trust, in the second
we despaire: in the first
wee p
                     •
                  ay, in the second wee
blaspheme. Let vs consider
therefore how farre wee are
falne from the first, and how
farre we are from falling into
the second: and nothing
more discouereth the same
then to behold our conuersations
in the glasse of the
word, wherein euery man in
particular may see his owne;
and by obseruation the blemishes
of the general multitude;

and none that hath religious
eyes but may behold
a generall deformitie. Wee
ought to haue no other
Gods but one, but we make
vs as many as we haue worldly
dependancies, namely, reposing
our confidences on
any besides the liuing God
(as is said before) We shold
not take the holy name of
GOD into our polluted
mout
                     •
                  es in vaine; yet
what is more common then
the idle speaking of, and the
heedles praying vnto God?
Wee should loue our neighbours
as our selues, and performe
the rest of our dueties
required, and auoyde things
forbidden by the laws of the
two tables; but if we shal be
examined by the letter, and
iudged by our obedience,

we would seeke to hide vs
from the iudgement to com.
But none can fulfill the law,Carnall sophistrie.
and therfore not I: if any be
saued, then so shall I. This
is the carnall mans sophistry,
whereby he frameth to himselfe
syllogismes against his
owne saluation, prouing it
needlesse to heare the word
preached, nay dangerous.
Some will not sticke to say,
that they may heare too
much, & consequenly know
too much: for according to
their knowledge is their obedience
and practise required;
and therefore if they
know good and doe it not,
their condemnation is the
more iust: if they know little
they may sinne the more, &
yet are they the more excusable.
And though they seldome

or neuer pray, they
offend not so much as if
they pray and forgiue not
their brother whō they hate;
and therefore the lesse they
pray the lesse shall their hatred
of their brother be laid
to their charge. Here is the
doctrine of the Diuell, professed
by some kinde of people,
and held as sound religion
as they neede to build
their faith vpon; as by such
as refuse to partake of the
holy communion beecause
they are not in charitie. As
the diuel said to Heuah, Yea,
hath God said ye shall die if ye
eate of the tree of the knowledge
of good and euill? No,
no; ye shall not only not die, but
ye shall be like God himselfe:
so he perswadeth these kind
of men, Hath God commanded

you to search the Scriptures,
to seeke knowledge, to
beleeue the word, and to pray
& partake of the sacraments
No, no; beware: the more
ye know the more ye haue
to answere; ye need take no
such paines. Though some,
more curious thē they need,
make much ado, and spend
their time in hearing the
Word preached, in reading
the same, beleeuing in God,
and praying vnto him; they
haue much to answere, for,
He to whom much is giuen, of
him much shall bee required:
and therefore take heede ye
couet not to know much;
and yet ye shall prosper, fare
as well, and haue all things
at wil as wel as they that are
most religious. This doctrine
of the Diuell is pleasing

to the carnally minded,
and more follow the rules of
the power of darkenes, then
there follow Christ, the
guide vnto grace, and giuer
of all goodnes; which causeth
sinne so infinitely to abound,
and euery man to run
a race according to his own
hearts lust, seldome or neuer
reprehended or condignly
punished.Repentance the

                  fore
him on the knees of
relenting harts, and appease
him with the presents of
faith, obedience, and praier;
wee may else feare that God
will come vpon vs, as Dauid
intended vpon Nabal, and

take from vs that vnspeakeable
pearle, the vse of the Gospell
which hee hath so long
lent vs, and continued amongst
vs, notwithstanding
so many millions of impediments.
Let not our sinnes
increase as they seem to beginne.
All places are too
full of them, who little regard
the Gospell, such as despise
gouernement, whose
hearts are ouergorged with
sinne. We haue been so long
fed with this spirituall Manna,
that many seeme to bee
glutted therewith, whose
soules yet famish, and they
feele it not. Other Nations
haue beene denied to taste
of that whereof many of vs
are wearie. Will we needes
put out our Lampes now the
Bride-groome is so neere?

Will we needes cast wilfully
off our wedding-garments,
the Master of the feast being
readie to suruey his guests?
Are we willing to bee taken
from the blessed banquet of
saluation, and to be cast into
vtter darkenesse? Shall such
as passe by shake their heads
at vs,1. King. 9. 8. 9. seeing vs naked that
erst were so decked with the
knowledge of Christ, and
beautified with the sacred
ornaments of obedience and
loue? Shall we now beginne
to crucifie Christ anew?
God forbid.How wee ought to appease God. What remaineth
then? Onely let vs become
more warie & watchfull:
let vs not follow the
multitude to doe euill: let euery
man rather retire himselfe
into the secret closet of
his heart, and let him bewray

vnto God his owne sinnes,
and confesse them to bee
part of the cause that God is
angrie with his people: let
euery man pray as well in
priuat as in publike, beating
our breasts (wherin do lodg
our corrupted hearts) with
the fists of true repentance,
and new obedience: let vs
pray earnestly for pardon &
remission of our former
transgressions: let vs cast of
                     •
                  
the ragges of the old man,
and seek by humble and vnfained
submission and praier
to be clothed with the more
glorious garments of pietie,
and the rich and right robe
of innocencie: let vs redeem
our furniture of true Ch

faith, constaint in hope, frequent

ashamed to lay open, and
vnlap our sores before the
Physitian of our soules: let
vs take vnto vs the sword of
the spirit, and constantly encounter
Sathan and sinne,
who haue wounded vs euen
to the death: let vs repaire
vnto that heauenly Samaritan;

of mercie into our wounds,
and heale vs. Our disease of
sinning is common; let there
be a common consent in seeking
remedie, and let vs all
with one hart and one mind
humble our selues before
God,2. Chro. 20. 3 in fasting and prayer.
Thus must we seek the Physitiā,

who being thus sought
is euer readie at hand, and
expecteth no reward but our
new obedience: and to obserue
the diet he prescribeth,
namely, to sinne no more, with
a caueat, lest a worse thing
happen vnto vs. Wee must
not onely not doe euill, but
we must do good: we must
not only flie vice, but follow
vertue; which rules implie
al the duties that a Christian
man ought to performe towards
God and his neighbour,
among which prayer
being the cheefest, is cheefly
required; which if it bee
enkindled by the fire of
Gods spirit, produceth such
a spirituall zeale in our affections
as begetteth that loue
whence proceedeth our true
obedience to God, and the

               CHAP. XXIX.
               Wee ought to pray as well for
our neighbours as for our
selues. The vse of prayer
is two-fold, publique and
priuate. Meditation enkindleth
prayer.
               AS prayer to God, and
loue to our neighbour
go necessarily together, how
can a Christian man then
pray to God for himselfe, &
therein forget h

                  s brother
whom God commandeth
him to loue as himselfe?
wherein is included not only

his naturall brother, and
priuate friend; but all men
in general, but especially the
Church of Christ and the
members of the same. And
therefore it is to be considered
that the vse and exercise
of praier is two-fold, priuate
and publique. The priuate
prayerPriuate praier. is the exercise of a
faithfull man, sequestred frō
the societie of men, pouring
forth his faithfull 
                     •
                  upplications
vnto God in secret: and
that not of set custome, but
in affections sanctified vnto
the Lord onely; and that especially
in such times as
when he feeleth the spirit of
God, enkindling in him a
kind of inward and spirituall
desire thereunto, which to a
man exercised in this diuine
worke, is as sensibly felt and

perceiued as the beating of
his pulse. When hee feeleth
this heauenly fire begin to
waxe hote within him, let
him not delay to feed it with
its proper fuell,Meditation the bellowes to enkindle prayer. Meditation
and Prayer: for by experience
the godly man cannot
but find, that Meditation is
as the spiritual bellowes that
increaseth the feruencie of
prayer. Euen as one sparke
of fire beeing connexed to
the fuell capable or combustible,
with gentle blowing
makes a flame; so the least
portion of spirituall zeale,
beginning but to moue in
the heart of the beleeuer, being
by little & little cherished
by silent (but heauenly) eleuatiō
of the mind to God,
breedeth in the end such a
powerfull operation, as the

tongue that was before
dumbe, and could not moue
zealously to vtter; and the
heart that was before dull
& could not conceiue what
to speake, shall so sweetly
concurre, that without all
difficultie and harshnes such
a sweet sacrifice shall ascend
from the hart to the lips, and
from the heart and lippes to
the heauens, as the tongue it
selfe cannot expresse the
sweetnesse it bringeth vnto
the soule. For that spirit that
first kindled the desire administreth
the matter for the
heart to conceiue, and frameth
the wordes that the
lips doe vtter, in farre more
diuine manner then the wisest
carnall man could euer
deuise or speak: and it bringeth
with it more ioy & true

consolation then gold, or the
most precious earthly thing:
And more solide, and sound
peace to the conscience,
then the tongue of man is able
to vtter. It is the most
truely approoued remedy against
all the griefes, and
troubles of the minde: It
easeth the afflictions, crosses,
torments, and persecutions
of the bodie. And were it
possible, that this sacred gift
could be obtained by carnal
meanes: and the carnall man
knew the vertue & sweetnesse
of it, he would sel
all his earthly possessions
to buy it.

               How, when, and where priuate
prayers are to be made. An
erronious conceit of priuate
prayer. What sweetnesse
priuate prayer brings
to the soule.
               THE priuate prayer before
mentioned, is not
alwayes made in a Closset,
or Chamber: Although,
Christ willeth vs, when wee
pray, to enter into our chamber
and there to pray to him
in secret. The mening wherof
is, that wee should not
bee seene Pharisaically, to
make our priuate prayers in
a publike manner, as to bee
seen of men. The open fields
is as a priuate Closset to him

that sequestreth himselfe frō
the societie of men for that
holy purpose: as it is supposed
Isack did, when hee
met Rebecca his wife. Sometimes
this prayer is made, euen
in the middest of ill-disposed
companie, and in the
very act of most serious businesse:
though not ceremoniously;
as vpon the knee,
bare headed, striking the
breast, or lifting vp the
eyes or hands, which are externall
gestures, most meete
to be vsed in prayer. But places,
times▪ and persons, are
to be considered, for the outward
gesture: but the inward
heart and the sanctified affection,
without any outward
appearance of prayer, may
secretly send vp vnto God
inward sighes, and desires

which may preuaile with
God as did Anna, Moses,
                  Nehem. 2. 4.
& Nehemiah. Hee that made
the heart knoweth it, & how
it is prepared within, & looketh
not to the lippes, how
they moue, as Helie did to
Annaes;
                  Luc. 19. 2. but to the heart, as
Christ did to Zacheus. The
place where, and the time
when touching our priuate,
prayer, are not much materiall
so the occasion be rightly
considered.A preposterous kind of prayer. For in the time
of vnseasonable wet, to pray
for raine; in time of sufficiencie
to pray for increase
were absurde. But as the occasion
doth offer it selfe, in
whatsoeuer place, at whatsoeuer
time, in whatsoeuer
manner, diuine reuerence to
God considered, it is accepted
with God, Daniel praied

among the Lions in the den:
Ieremie in the dungeon: the
three children in the Ouen:
Dauid in the Wildernesse:
Gedion at his threshing: Elisha
at the plough. Wheresoeuer
we are, and whatsoeuer
we doe in our vocations, we
are in the presence of God &
may there & then send forth
our silent & preuailing praiers:
and Christ the mediator
will present them, as
sweet odors before our God
in Heauen. Ioseph, Paul, Peeter,
Silas, Iohn Baptist, found
the Lord in their prisons. It
is a fond conceipt of some
men, that thinke there is no
place fit, no not for priuate
prayer but the Temple, nor
God any where else to bee
found, or prayed vnto, but
in, and towards the East: as

if he were not aswell in the
west, & vpon al the points &
degrees of the Compasse: In
the Zenith ouer our heads,
and with the Antipodes directly
vnder vs: Before vs,
behind vs, on our right hand,
and on our left: In the Sea
with Peter: In the Whales
bellie with Ionah: In shipwrack
with Paul. And therefore
wee may conclude, that
there is no place, where God
is not. So we may pray euery
where. And if our prayer be
faithfull he heareth vs, walking,
working riding, sitting
yea, and in our familiar talking,
the minde may haue
her affections in Heauen, the
soule may cast forth certaine
inward holy desires, and yet
the bodie may bee occupied
in whatsoeuer lawful function.

But when wee are for
that purpose retired, and are
free both from bodily exercise,
and from the view of
men: wee must then conforme
our gestures in a m
                     •
                  r
                     •
                  
reuerend, and more humble
outward manner; as kneeling
vpon our knees, and lifting
vp our handes, and the
like, giuing our holy desires
best satisfaction in so sacred
an exercise. O happie is that
soule, that sends forth continuall
holy sighes and desires:
at all times and in all places:
which are as lowd cries vnto
the Lord, which God heareth,
vnderstandeth, and answereth;
and alloweth this
kinde of holy deuotion, as a
forsaking of earthly thinges
for a moment, to aspire vnto
Heauenly contemplation &

conuersation for euer. And
this cannot proceede, but
from a heart full of the loue
of heauenly thinges, of God
especially: who hath (as wee
may thereby truly feele) the
superior power in vs, & ouer
vs; and in his loue draweth
our affections from earthly
to heauenly cogitations, altogether
& alone, for our
saluation. And happy
is he that with Dauid
delighteth
therein.

               The helpes and hinderances of
prayer: how Sathan striueth
to hinder prayer: for nothing
woundeth him as
faithfull prayer in the name
of Christ. Wee must bee
watchfull and strong to resist
him.
               PRayer, both priuate and
publik, haue their helpes
and hinderances, their motiues,
and mortifications. To
stirre vp the heart thereunto
nothing more availeth, then
the often hearing and reading
of the word of God,
which begetteth faith, that
begetteth prayer; sundrie selected
Psalmes of Dau
                        •
                     d, &
diuers of the writings of S.

                  Paul, besides many other
Scriptures consideratly read
& duly meditated, are forceable
motiues to this diuine
dutie. The consideration of
our sinnes, and of the promises
of the forgiuing them in
Christ: The feeling of our
spirituall wants: The consideration
of Gods continuall
fauour, prouidence, and protection,
in releiuing, defending,
and helping others,
through faithfull prayer. Examples,
whereof are infinite
in the Scriptures, doe
much further this diuine and
heauenly exercise, by applying
our faith, and prayer to
God, in our like occasions.
               On the contrarie, prayer
is much hindred,Hindrances to praier. and our
zeale mortified, by the neglect
of practise: by seldome,

or carelesse hearing of the
Word of God, or reading
the Diuine Scriptures, or
some godly workes, of good
and religious men: Not to
beleeue, that God heareth or
respecteth our prayers: That
he is not able to giue what
we aske, or to doe what we
desire, if it bee for his owne
glorie and our good: To
thinke that which hee doth
is not for our best: To wauer
in our prayers, or to haue
our mindes carried away
with by-thoughts, that
are not answerable, & concurring
with that wee pray
for: To pray for fashion, and
without feeling of any necessitie
to pray: To presume,
that God will heare our prayers
for our owne sakes▪
without the merits and mediation

of Christ: To faint &
giue ouer our prayers, when
we cannot receiue, what we
would, when we would: To
pray openly▪ and to be seene
of men: To thinke that wee
are not boūd to pray for our
brethren: These and manie
other like hinderances of
prayer, are often thrust into
our hearts, by the policie of
Sathan, who commeth to
hinder all good and godly
actions.1. Thes. 2. 18 & 3. 5. Eph. 4. 27. But wee ought not
to giue place to his inticements,
nor yeild to his temptations.
The most faithfull
men, haue not only continuall
warre with flesh, and
bloud, namely with their
owne corrupt affections
to keepe them vnder:Eph. 6. 11. but
with Sathan himselfe, with
spiritual wickednesse. When

                  Iehoshua was doing the Office
of the High Priest,
                  Zech. 3. 1. standing
before the Angell making
his prayers vnto God,
The Deuil stood at his right
hand to hinder him. And
shall wee thinke that he will
be lesse readie to hinder and
resist vs in our Diuine excercises?Mat. 4.
He tempted Christ the
Lord, and will hee forbeare
his seruants? Hee desired to
winnow the verie Apostles
of Christ:
                  Luc. 22. 31. how much more
will hee seeke to distract vs,
in our deuotest prayers
which hee thinketh will bee
most auailable with God?Nothing more woū
                     deth Sathā then faithfull praier and therefore he coueteth to hinder it.
There is nothing vnder the
Sun, that giues him a more
deadly woūd, then our faithfull
prayers to God. And
therefore in his impious policie,
he endeuoureth to hinder

this heauenly exercise in
the deerest childrē of God
lest that the righteous soule
should so farre preuaile with
God, as to procure his fauor
and grace by prayer, and
consequently his ayde and
holy assistance to encounter
this most malicious aduersary.
It is written that the Lion
is afraid at the crowing of a
Cocke; but nothing maketh
Sathan so much afraide as
faithfull prayer to Christ,
whose very name is terrible
vnto him, hauing tried his
force and skill against him
in the Wlldernesse, vpon the
pinacle, but especially vpō
the Crosse, where Christ so
farre triumphed ouer him,
as that now, howsoeuer malignant
he seemeth to be towards
Gods children, he dareth

not to encounter them
face to face, that vse the
sword of the spirit and the
shield of faith against him.
Although through the abundance
of his malice to Christ
and his elect, he leaueth not
to tempt them, yet it is but
by starts and snatches, as hee
findeth them colde in their
spirituall exercises, as hee
found Dauid idle: or thorough
weakenesse, apt to be
drawne into some back-sliding,
as hee did Peter. But
what got hee by betraying
those innocents? It was not
long ere they renewed their
spirituall strength, and then
they gaue him such an ouerthrow,
as afterwards hee
could neuer preuaile against
the force of their faith. It
therefore behoueth euerie

Christian to be very watchfull,
that he admit none of
these suggestions of Sathan,
to take away, preuent, or resist
this sacred and diuine
dutie of faithfull prayer, and
to stand fast in the faith, to
quit them in all his encounters
like men. Put on the whole
armour of God,
                  1. Cor. 16. 13. 
                  that ye may be
able to stand against the assaults
of the diuell: for wee
wrestle not against slesh and
bloud (against weake men
that haue, as we haue, their
breath in their nostrils) but
against Principalities, against
powers, and against the Princes
of the darkenesse of this
world, against spirituall wickednesse,
which are in the high
places. These are the enemies
of our peace with God,
and therefore endeuor they

to steale away our hearts
from the liuing God: these
are they that seeke to resist
our prayers, to peruert our
hearts in prayer, to estrange
our affections from heauenly
things; and by no meanes
can we repell them, but with
spirituall weapons, as they
are spirituall enemies. And
therefore wee must vse the
counsell of the Apostle, that
is, to take vnto vs the armor
of God; not a part, but the
whole furniture: namely, an
vpright conscience, a godly
and holy life, knowledge of
the Gospel, faith vnfained,
and continuall prayer: not
for our selues onely, but for
the Church of Christ, and for
euery member of the same.
For the particular weapons
of this complete munition,

wherewith euery Christian
ought to be armed against
these spirituall enemies,
reade Eph. 6. 16. 17, 18.
            
            
               CHAP. XXXII.
               The presence of God himselfe
is promised in publike praier:
how he is present, which
the carnall man apprehendeth
not: the discontinuance
of prayer, publique or
priuat, dangerous.
               AS touching publique
prayer, our Sauiour giueth
vs such an encouragement
to moue vs thereunto,
both of his owne presence,
and of the assurance of obtaining
what we ask; as it is
more then wonderfull that
mē should shew themselues

so ba
                     •
                  kward, as not to desire
to meete Christ in such holy
Assemblies, as are graced
with his owne presence.
Where two or three are gathered
together in my name (saith
Christ) I will bee there in the
middest of them. And whatsoeuer
they shall aske with one
accord in my name, it shall be
granted vnto them. No man
is so impious as to bring in
question, whether this can
or will prooue true or not,
that Christ should come
downe and be in the society
of men. For we may assure
vs, that God the father, God
the sonne, and God the holy
Ghost being all one, the Father
is where the sonne is,
the holy Ghost where the father
and the sonne are. And
Christ promising to send the

Comforter the holy Ghost
after his departure, performed
it in clouen tongues: and
he is with vs, namely with
his Church to the end of the
world, and consequently, the
father and the sonne, the
Trinitie in Vnitie. I will pray
the Father (saith Christ) and
he shall giue you another comforter,
that he may abide with
you for euer, euen the spirit of
truth; so called, because hee
inspireth the truth into vs,
and teacheth vs to crie Abba
father, whether in priuate
or publike assemblies gath
                     •
                  
                  red
together in the name of
Christ. Hee then being the
spirit of Christ, and being all
one with Christ, being with
vs, and dwelling in vs; it can
not be denied but Christ is
with vs according to his

promise, namely with the
faithfull assembled in his
name, whō the world, namely
carnall men of the world,
know not. But yee (saith
Christ to the faithfull) know
hum, for he dwelleth in you: &
I will not leaue you comfortlesse,
but I will come to you. Againe
he saith,Ioh. 14. 
                  I am in my
father, and I in you, and you
in me. Seeing then that all
holy assemblies gathered together
to heare God speake
vnto them; and againe that
they together may speake
vnto God; are not left without
the glorious presence of
God himselfe: how are they
to be condemned that frame
vnto themselues, or rather

                     •
                  orge by the suggestion of
Sathan, cases as it were of
conscience, to abiure the

companie euen of Christ
himselfe?Sathan beleeu
                        •
                     th that hee would haue other men to doubt of. Sathan beleeueth
the word of God to be true,
and yet laboureth the contrarie
in men inclinable to
doubt, and causeth many to
misconceiue of the sense
which he himself knowes to
be otherwise then he would
haue them to beleeue. And
as he can make no vse of any
part of the word of God to
his owne: neyther would hee
that any should eyther heare
the word truely expounded,
or assemblies to concurre
rightly in prayer to their saluation.
And therefore whosoeuer
findeth in himself the
lest motion of doubting of
Gods performance of his
promises made vnto the
faithfully praying, or an vnaptnesse
and vnwillingnesse,

rather then a zealous inclination
to pray, either in priuat
to himselfe, in publique
with the Congregation, or
with his family priuately assembled,
may iustly feare
that Sathan hath woūd himselfe
into his affections, and
if he preuent him not speedily,
and resist him faithfully
by prayer, he will not leaue
vntill hee haue gotten command
of the whole house of
his soule, and will expulse all
godly cogitations, holy affections,
and sanctified desires,
and will suffer none to
be entertained but infidelity,
sinne, and fearefull apostacie.It is a dangerous thing to abandon the assemblies of Gods people
               
               Will not these daungers
mooue men to repaire vnto
the house of God with diligence
and zeale, there faithfully

to ioyne in prayer
with Gods children, and attentiuely
to heare the word
preached, which begetteth
faith, the fountaine whence
doe flow all holy and spirituall
exercises of the godly
soule? There is no other way
to seeke saluation but in and
by the word of God; nor any
other in and by whom
we can be saued, but in and
by Christ; who hauing so
louingly called vs, and by
promise of his own presence
intreated vs to communicat
in holy exercises, with him
and his elect, who wil or can
rest so carelesse of his owne
saluation, as wilfully or negligently
to estrange himself,
from this holy communication
with God himselfe in
prayer? publique or priuat.
               
                  
Publique prayers are so
called because they are pronounced
distinctly with an
audible voice,Publique prayer why so called. in the hearing
and to the vnderstanding of
a whole Congregation assembled.
And these praiers
commonly tend to publique
and common ends: as, for
the obtaining of some generall
good to the whole
Church, preuenting of some
generall dāger, or remouing
of some generall euill. And
this, although it be properly
meant of parochial Congregatiōs,
who assemble themselues
by course on the Sabbath
and other set dayes,
making their supplications
publiquely, for themselues
and others, according to generall
occasions after a common
manner; yet are houshold

assemblies said to pray
publiquely, wherein the Master
of the Family is to conuent
such as are vnder his
charge, and publikely together
with them to pray vnto
God, as well for the vniuersall
good of the Church,
whereof they are members,
& for the Common-weale,
wherin they liue as subiects;
as for themselues. And the
promise of Christs presence
holdeth true, as well in this
latter, wherein two or three
onely gather together in
his name; as where
infinit numbers
are assembled.

               Priuat prayer in som respects
& at som times more comfortable
to a priuate man
then publique. The neglect
of publique praier in priuat
families condemned: for
where God is not, there Sathan
is serued.
               THe same that hath been
formerly said of priuate
prayer, may bee affirmed of
publique; although the first
bee more ordinary then the
second not being limited to
times certain, but attendeth
all occasions, and yeeldeth
more comfort to the troubled
spirit of some priuate
man, that dareth to vnfolde
that vnto GOD in secret,
which hee would blush to

reueale vnto man, were hee
neuer so neere and deere vnto
him; much lesse would he
publish it in a publique assembly
willingly. And this
kind of prayer also is of that
condition, that where it is
enkindled, and cannot haue
free vtterance by the lips by
reason of company, but is
pent vp in the breast, it laboreth
with such spirituall violence
in the sanctified soule,
as it makes the very heart
within a man (as it were) to
ake and rent in sunder, thorough
the ardent eleuation
of the spirit vnto God. And
it is the surest trial of true religion.
In publique assemblies
sometimes hypocrisie
beareth a farre greater sway
then it can doe in the priuat
man, who knoweth that the

weight of spirituall ioy it
bringeth vnto, and leaues in
his soule through prayers,
inflamed by the holy spirit
of Christ, and powerfully vttered
priuatly vnto God in
Christ, whether in silence, in
sighes, or words, cannot be
expressed to the capacity of
a carnall man: and therefore
it may seem that priuat praiers
in priuat cases somtimes
work more effectually to the
comfort of the soule then
the publik. But in cases more
generall, when the more
faithfull soules conioyne in
effectuall prayer, so much
the more auaileable is their
prayer with God.
               Fathers of children and
Masters of families, who
content themselues onely
with a bare seru
                     •
                  ng of God

in shew once in the week on
the Sabbath day,Fathers & Masters of Families reproued for their neglect of prayer with their families. are to bee
reproued, who seem to hold
it a needlesse and superfluous
worke to trouble themselues
& their families morning
or euening in prayer,
and exhortation to the feare
of God, and dehorting them
from sin; which times they
haue assigned in their opinions
to more profitable vses,
both for themselues & their
seruants: forgetting, or not
vnderstanding, that in euery
Christian family eyther God
or Sathan is serued, Christ
or Belial obeyed, sanctity or
sinne embraced. For there is
no priuat person, but is or
holdeth of one of these; cō
                  sequently
no societie but
partaketh of the fruits arising
of good or euill. If then

either priuat man or publike
assembly, be it prouinciall,
parochiall or domesticall, do
forget this most high dutie
of seruing the liuing God: it
followeth of necessitie that
a contrary power hath there
the command; and nothing
more discouereth to which
any of the former lend their
obedience,Not to serue God but on the Sabbath day is wilfull ignorance and negligence. then the fruits
that eyther of them produceth:
if carnall effects, as louing
the world, the pleasures
of the flesh, and the vanities
of this life, it argueth that
priuat man, or that society to
be profane. If it were sufficient
to serue God on the
sabbath, what needed the Apostle
to aduise vs to pray cō
                     tinually
and the commandement
of Christ,1. Cor. 15. 34 
                  Watch and
pray,
                  Mat. 26. 41. 
                  that yee enter not into

temptation, to loue righteousnesse
and to slie sinne. How
doe they awake
                     •
                  or watch,
that slumber from Saboth
to Saboth? Are they not all
that time in darknesse, not vsing
the duties of the light?
Christ is the light in whome
whosoeuer liueth not, hee is
in darknesse. And hee that
hath but one day of light in
seuen, How great is his
darknesse? It is true, this day,
the Saboth was set apart by
God: that in it men should
imploy themselues, to serue
and to glorifie him. And in
that day they shuld not only
not doe but also not thinke
of anie Worldly affaires.
But are not some so far from
celebrating the name and
seruice of God that day,The Saboth prophaned more then other daies. as
they prophane it aboue all

other dayes? doe they not
turne the glorie of God into
wantonnes, to banquetting,
dicing, dauncing, drunkennesse,
gluttonie, and to what
sinne not? This commonly
is the day, that many appoint
for merrie companie,
to laugh, and to be jouiall, as
they call it, without meane
or modestie: And yet, this
day is sufficiently kept holy
as they thinke, if they spend
an houre in the fore part of
the day, and halfe an houre
in the after-noone, in the
Church: though all the rest
be consumed in most lasciuious
vanities, and carnall
occasions. How can this
discharge the duty of a Christian,
that hath no care to
serue God any other day in
the weeke? Doe we not credit

the premonition of the
Apostle Saint Peter, that the
end of all thinges is at hand?
                  1. Pet. 4. 8. We should especially serue God for that we liue in the last age of the world.
And how follow wee his
counsell, namely, to bee sober,
watching in prayer? To
whom speaketh the Apostle
this? to his Countrimen, the
Iewes only? no, euen to vs:
that are come, as it were, to
the Worlds period. And
therefore high time it is for
vs to looke vp, to watch, &
pray, to liue religiously, and
soberly, least that the Master
of this great family come
suddenly, and find vs buffeting
one another, blaspheming,
swaggering drunken,
faithlesse, insolent, couetous,
and few or none doing the
seruice of our Master. It wil
bee a dreadfull sight, to see
him come with his iron rod

in his hand to crush his enemies
in peeces. The salt of
the earth, hauing lost it saltnesse,
shall bee cast to the
dung-hill. The Tree that
brings not forth good fruit
is hewen downe and cast in
the fire. The Magistrates
saltnesse is profession of the
Gospell, and the execution
of Iustice. The saltnesse of
the Minister is the true preaching
of the word, and example
of godly life. The saltnesse
of Fathers is their sincere
conuersation before
their children, and the educating
them in the feare of
God, and holy life. The saltnesse
of Masters of Families,
is to liue honestly, religiously,
aud gouerning their
charge in the feare of God.
And vnder these four estates

of men, are all conditions
comprehended: subiects
vnder Kings; children vnder
fathers; and young men vnder
tutors and gouernours.
Euery of these, in their places
of superioritie and inferioritie,
haue their seuerall
duties; and all vnder one
God, whome they ought all
to obey; Superiours in rightly
commanding; and inferiors
in duly obeying. Neyther
of these duties can bee
rightly performed without
knowledg of the wil of God
by his word. This knowledge
is not perfect without
practise: This practise is imperfect
without faith: And
faith is known by the fruits;
the chiefe whereof is loue.
And this loue most shineth
and sheweth it selfe in doing

good to all, but especially to
them of the family of faith.
The greatest good, that can
bee done to the Church of
God, is Prayer. And therefore
Saint Paul willeth to
pray continually: not for our
selues onely, but, for Kinges
& al the members of Christs
mysticall bodie. Kings and
Magistrates ought to imitate
Dauid, to accompanie
the people to the house of the
Lord: Fathers, and Masters
ought to pray with and for
their Children and Families;
not on the Saboth day only,
but with all perseuerance.
Some refer the duty of praier
only to the Minister, and
thinke it a kinde of vsurpation
of the Ministers office, to
pray for or with any, but for
himselfe, contrarie to the

precept of Saint Paul; Who
willeth that all men make
prayers, in all places, heauing
vp pure handes, without strife
or enuying, vnto the Liuing
God. Where it appeares, that
vnder the word all Men,
Kings, Princes, Nobles, and
men of all degrees, faculties
and functions, are comprehended:
and because they
shall not thinke there is no
place but the materiall temple,
he commands that dutie
to bee performed in all places;
euen in euery particular
house: with caution, that it
bee done without strife and
enuying, & free from vaine
ostentation and desire of popular
glorie.

               The true vse of the Lords
Prayer, about which friuolous
questions haue risen. It
is the rule of all other prayers,
and euery petition ful of
high matter of instruction.
               THE most absolute praier,
and the most ordinarie,
which not only
the Primitiue, but the Moderne
Christian Churches &
their members haue in vse, is
the Prayer that Christ taught
his Disciples. But wee must
take heed wee doe not take
this Prayer into our mouths
vnreuerently, inconsideratly
and without faith or feeling,
and without due conceiuing,
and rightly vnderstanding

what euery Petition
concerneth and importeth,
as some doe. But wee must
especially in priuate or publike
Prayer vnto God, and
aboue all other, vse this most
heauenly Prayer, with a sincere
and truely sanctified
zeale.
               About the vse of this praier,Opinions about the vse of the Lords Prayer.
there hath beene of late
a friuolous & needlesse question
raised, by men of too
precise an opinion: who affirme
it not necessarie, to vse
this praier, in the bare words
as Christ set it down: A conceit,
without reason or religiō.
Others hold it verie sufficient
of it selfe, without
eyther any other Prayer, or
enlarging the same, according
to the measure of the
spirit that the man that praieth

hath. Which last opinion
although more tollerable
then the first,The Lords praier the rule of all other praiers I holde erronious.
For we know, that the
Apostles themselues, & the
Disciples of Christ after they
had learned this Prayer,
prayed often in other words,
albeit the Lords Prayer bee
the rule and the sum of all other
Prayers: And so (no
doubt) it is not only, not vnlawfull,
but an especiall fruit
and effect of faith, to pray
according to our occasions,
and to frame words, as the
Spirit of God shall giue vtterance,
who (although we
know not) teacheth vs how
to pray: but this must alwaies
be done according to the tenour
of the Lords Prayer.
And, therefore howsoeuer
weake and imperfect, our

Prayers may seem
                     •
                  e to bee
vnto our carnall part in respect
of the phrase: yet our
spirits being directed by
Gods Holy Spirit, powreth
forth Prayers, truely vnderstood
of him by whose spirit
wee are enabled to pray.
And GOD granteth our
requests, according as hee
seeth fit for vs.

Prayers, is farre more common,The Lords prayer is to be rightly vnderstood.
then commonly rightly
vnderstood. For euery
word therein implieth matter
of great importance: yet
passeth the lips oftentimes,
before it come at, much lesse
before it bee truely digested
in the heart; and therefore

                  ereth without fruit; as
plants without natural soile,

with the sound. Others
in like sort, like Parrots, patter
forth Pater noster, &c. &
know no more what the
words import thē the senselesse
Parrot. And yet they
thinke it a worke of great
deuotion to tumble out a set
number of such fruitlesse &
faithlesse prayers, not vnderstood;
as were the time spent
in cordiall and heartie prayers
indeed, could not be but
much profitable. Such are to
be pitied, and prayed for, if
they would but yeilde their
eares to heare, their hearts
to vnderstand, and indeuour
to practise.

               The summe of the lords prayer
briefly explained.
               HOW many doe duly
consider,What the Word Our importeth. the efficacie
of the word, Our? And yet it
carrieth in it, as it were, the
seale of our adoption in
Christ: for, if God bee our
Father, then are we his children
(but by adoption) If his
children, then are we to lo

                     ••
                  er. If we
obey him, we acknowledge
his Commaundements iust:
who hauing commanded vs
to loue our brethren, how
can we come vnto our Heauenly
father, but bee put in
mind by this word Our, that
our brethren haue also an interest,

in o
                     •
                  r Prayers; whom
if we forget, we cannot but
acknowledge that wee also
forget who is our Father. Againe,
how can children loue
their father, and not hate
what he loueth not? If wee
loue what hee misliketh, as
the workes of the flesh, the
vanities of the World, and
the pleasures which our Father
hath forbidden: how,
and with what face can wee
come & cal him Our Father
Or beg any thing with hope
to receiue it at his handes:
whom wee cannot but confesse
wee rather flatter, then
feare or loue? The wordes,
which art in heauen,
                  Which art in Heauen. intimate
vnto vs, that we call not vpon
any earthly Prince, or
mortall Monarch, but vpon
the inuisible and immortall

God whose dwelling is in
the Heauens: & at his hands
only we seeke whatsoeuer
we need, both heauenly and
earthly thinges. And as hee
our Father is in Heauen
whome wee loue: so should

                     •
                  ur minds, and cogitations,
m
                     •
                  unt vp aboue the earth,
vnto the heauens, where our
beloued sitteth in glorie.
And although we bee in bodie
in the earth & our soules
in an earthly Tabernacle: yet
should that our spiritual part
be euermore conuersant (as
it were) with him in the heauens,
as children of our heauenly
Father. For, hee that
findeth not here in himselfe
such spirituall motions, as
may assure him, that hee in
some measure partaketh of
a kind of felt heauenly blessednesse:

shall neuer hereafter
partake of our heauenly
Fathers glorie. And therefore
as we are bold, in Christ
our elder brother, to present
our selues before his Maiestie,
rendring vnto him his
owne, namely the lesson that
he himselfe taught vs: let vs
not come to him as Trewants,
nor able to yeeld a reason
vnto our selues, of euery
branch of the lesson hee
gaue vs to learne. But let vs
set it before the eyes of our
vnderstandings, eyther as a

                  sse to see our ignorance,
and deformities: or to make
it a law vnto our selues, to
shape all our prayers to him,
and our conuersations thereby,
to G
                     •
                  ds glorie and our
owne internall comfort.
               What a lesson doe these

words,Hallowed be thy name. 
                  Hallowed bee thy
name, teach vs? what occasion
may wee hereby take to
reproue our selues? for many
with the

                  lipp

                  s pronounce,
Hallowed be thy name; that
thinke or doe nothing lesse;
profaning the name of God
by their sinnes, which they
should seeke by all meanes
to glorifie, as by obedience
to his lawes, by louing him
for his own sake, by praying
vnto him, and beleeuing in
him. But contrarily, we disobey
his will, wee loue not
his word, we beleeue not his
promises, wee seeme to pray
vnto him with the lips, our
hearts farre from him. Also
wee pray that his Kingdome
may come:
                  Thy Kingdome come. namely that his
Word may worke; and take
effect in euery mans heart,

to the sauing of their soules.
And yet most of vs are as
farre from regarding it, as
wee rather contemne it and
resist it: seeming as it were
vnwilling, that the Spirit of
God should dwell and rule
in our heartes; as may appeare
by our common disobedience
vnto the Scepter
of his Kingdome, the Gospell
of Christ.
                  Thy will be done. Wee pray likewise;
Thy will be done. And
yet we do nothing lesse then
obey it.Giue vs our daily bread. We begge our daily
bread at the hands of God
And yet wee trust him not,
but rather our owne prouisions,
our wit and policies,
our friendes and carnall

in store, for many yeares, as
the rich man did, mentioned
in the Gospell: Arguing

thereby that wee thinke in
our hearts, that if our owne
care in getting were no surer
meane of prouision of
our daily necessaries, then
the promise and prouidence
of God; wee should want
manie thinges, and not obtaine
sufficient meanes to
maintaine our estate & leaue
vnto our children: merely
contrarie to the counsell of
Christ: who willeth vs: not
to be ouer-carefull for tomorrow.
Fo
                     •
                   it argueth in vs a
great defect of faith. And yet
these words are not so to be
expounded, as if we should
bee altogether carelesse of
future times, or for our children:
but that wee should
not bee too solicitous and
carefull, and thereby argue
an absolute distrust that

God either can, or will, giue
vs, with our true obedience,
all thinges necessary in this
life to enioy
                     •
                  ; and to our
faithfull children. If riches
increase, set not your hearts
vpon them. If pouertie oppresse
thee, cast thy care vpon
God: for hee careth for
thee.
               
               Wee pray that God will
forgiue vs our sinnes,
                  Forgiue vs our sinnes as we forgiue 
                  as wee
forgiue. And yet we seeke to
take aduantage of euery
small iniurie, done vnto vs
by our neighbour or brother:
and couet to reuenge
it, by the extremest violence
of force, or Law. Our hatred
sometimes growes so deadly,
as wee cease not to persecute
and prosecute our enemies
to death, euen by our
own death: and yet we pray

for equall measure at Gods
hands. And this petition
they shall bee sure to haue
granted aboue all other. For
as they craue to be forgiuen
as they forgiue; they shal be
sure as they forgiue not, neither
shall they bee forgiuen.
We desire also not to be ledde
into temptation.
                  Leade vs not into temptation. And yet som
leaue not to seek all occasiōs
to fal therinto: coueting idle,
euil, lewd & lasciuious cōpanies,
hearing & reading profane
& wanton bookes, singing
and hearing songs of ribaldrie
and filthinesse, delighting
in drunkennesse,
whoredome, pride, couetousnesse,
enuie, glutto
                     •
                  ie,
scurrilitie, and all kinde of
forbidden wickednesse. Is
this the holy vse that they
make of this most sacred

prayer? And yet doe they
thinke that it is deuotion of
such acceptation with God
as dischargeth Christian dutie
in prayer? Surely God
heareth these, but regardeth
them not but by way of condemnation.
And therfore let
all men learne to know God
aright in his word, & to beleeue
him faithfully in his
promises, and to pray vnto
him conti
                     •
                  ually according
to knowledge: so as this holy
praier began with a desire
that God might bee glorified:
so shall wee to his glorie
and our comfort conclude
the same.As many petitions as are in the Lords prayer, so many instructions w
                        •
                      haue by them to liue godly. And let vs know,
that as many petitions as are
in this most heauenly prayer,
so many holy & heauenly
aduertisements & instructions
they administer vnto

vs to liue heauenly: for our
Sauiour, by teaching vs how
to pray for so many seuerall
blessings, doth therein teach
vs also how to performe our
duties towards God and our
neighbours, the summe of
both the Tables; so as in
praying vnto God with a
faithfull and an vnderstanding
heart, we cannot but inform
our selues in the course
of a godly conuersation also
thereby.

company of Christians

is there that will not

that will not be stirred vp?
or so peruerse and peeuish
that will not be perswaded

tending to the obtayning
of our saluation in
Christ: nay, further it is
found by experience, that
faithfull & often vse of prayer
is a most effectuall meane
to increase diuine knowledge,
such knowledge as
some learned and great Doctors,
notwithstanding their
deepest Schoole-learning,
haue not attained vnto. For
there is not a little difference

betweene humane learning
and spirituall knowledge, &
so much difference between
carnall deuotion and holy
zeale: the first may be in a
reprobate, the secōd in none
but in the child of God. The
Scribes and Rabbies of the
Iewes were great Doctors:
yet they apprehended not
the mysterie of Christ as did
the Apostles, who receiued not
the spirit of the world, but the
spirit which is of God.
                  1. Cor. 2. 12. The spirit
which Gods children receiue
lifteth vp their spirits
vnto God, & teacheth them
heauenly things, that we may
know the things that are giuen
vs of God. So that it is not the
deepest carnall learning that
can search the secret things
of God; but God reuealeth
them vnto the poore and

humble, by his spirit which
searcheth the deepe things
of God. The naturall man
perceiueth not the things of
the spirit of God; for they are
foolishnesse vnto him; neither
can he know them because they
are spiritually discerned. Thē
is not the facultie of vnderstanding
spirituall things giuen
but by grace, not by humane
vnderstanding, bee it
neuer so deepe. Therefore
saith the Apostle, Not manie
wisemen after the flesh, nor
many mightie, nor many noble
are called: but God hath
chosen the foolish things of the
world to confound the wise,
                  The spirit of God teacheth al

                     •
                   he that
hath the spirit of God knoweth
how to performe all

spirituall dueties, among
which none taketh place aboue
faithfull prayer, which
is of that force as it obtaineth
all things, especially
knowledge of things tending
to the saluation of the
soule: the sweetnesse of true
prayer none knoweth, nor
can apprehend but he onely
that hath it; the carnall man
vnderstandeth it not beeing
told it. Some will say they
cannot pray,Som affirm they cannot pray with comfort. they finde no
aptnesse in themselues therunto:
onely they can say the
Lords praier; but to say they
doe it with
                     •
                   that feeling of
cōfort, that they haue heard
some men say they feel, they
cannot, and how to amend it
they know not▪ yet are they
content to be let alone, loth
to bee awaked out o
                     •
                   their

deadly slumber, and to die in
that most fearefull traunce.
It is a greeuous sickenesse
and a dangerous disease that
such men are in: it cannot
but argue that they haue no
true knowledge of God so
long as they liue in this obscure,
yet a kind of voluntary
darknesse. For it cannot be
that a man can heare the
word preached, Gods promises
pronounced, and his
threats denounced; but if
there bee any feeling in him,
hee cannot but apprehend
mercie, or feare iudgement:
if neither of these can prouoke
him to pray with feeling,
he is doubtlesse farre
gone in a deadly Lethargie,
and no carnall medicine can
cure him, nor mortall Physitian
heale him; he only must

doe it that cast out the seuen
Diuels out of Marie: hee
must cast out the diuellish
affections out of the man, &
make him wise vnto saluation.
But if he be like vnto the
deafe Adder, and stoppe his
eares wilfully, refusing the
relieuing charme: there is no
help or hope for such a man.
            
            
               CHAP. XXXVII.
               Although no man by nature
knoweth how to pray, none
is to despaire; for the word
heard, and prayer vsed teacheth
it, and increaseth the
knowledge of it.
               NO man by nature, I cō
                  fesse,
knoweth how to

                     •
                  ray as hee ought: it is the
spirit of God that helpeth

our infirmities, and maketh
request for vs, with sighes
which cannot be expressed.
And therefore let no man
despaire of beeing enabled.
There is a seed in all men, a
holy and diuine sparke: and
if a man wilfully quench it
not, this seed being watered
by hearing and reading of
the word, by faith and prayer,
may take roote, bud, and
bear fruit, howsoeuer weakly
in the beginning. As an
infant at the first quickening
in the womb of the mother,
which time brings to more
maturity and perfection, and
commeth into the world felt
and s
                     •
                  en: so this diuine seed
by degrees commeth to be
liuely in operation: and the
small sparke becommeth a
flame, and in fine, enkindleth

an admirable weight of zeal.
For to him that hath, to him
shall be more giuen, and by
continuance and practise he
shall finde himselfe a new
man, more and more euerie
day furnished with diuine
gifts. Nothing is perfected
the first day that hath growing
and increase. All spirituall
graces haue their beginnings
weake; and among al
the other fruits of the spirit
of God none is more excellent,
more sweet, more auailable
to saluation, then is
continuall faithfull prayer,The force of prayer increaseth by degrees.
which is not the first day in
perfection; but by little and
little it becomes more and
more feruent: and as it increaseth
so draweth it with
it a wonderful increase of the
knowledge of all things necessarie

to saluation. So that
I may conclude to the comfort
of all true Christians
                     •
                  
That he that can pray faithfully
hath all things both in
heauen and earth, lacking
nothing necessarie; for hee
hath God: and he that cannot,
nor will endeauour to
learne how to pray, hath nothing
yet that he ought to
haue.
               1. CHRON. 28. 9.
               The Lord searcheth all harts,
and vnderstandeth al the imaginations
of thoughts: If thou
seeke him hee will be found of

            A MORNING
PRAIER TO BEE
VSED IN PRIVATE
FAMILIES.
            O Lord who takest
euermore charge
of thy people, giuing
them euer in
due time what in thy wisedome
thou knowest necessary
for them: we acknowledg
thy great goodnesse toward
vs O Lord, in deliuering vs
this night from dangers, and
in giuing vs competent re
                  ••
               .
Thou hast of thine aboundant
mercie raised vs this
morning in safetie. Looke

not wee beseech thee vpon
our pollutions, the printes
whereof, through our corruptions,
we haue left behind
vs in our beds. Take from vs,
and from euery one of vs, we
beseech thee, the filthie garmens
of sin
                  •
               e, shame and
confusion, wherewith wee
were conceiued and borne,
and cloth vs with thy rightteousnesse
and saluation in
Iesus Christ. Blesse vs and
we shall be blessed, teach vs
wisedome to choose what is
good, and to auoid euil, and
all the occasions of sinning,
this day. Thou Lord hast
pleasure in righteousnesse.
And they are only bless
                  •
               d, in
whose hearts are thy wayes;
take away from vs stonie
hearts, and giue vs heartes
of flesh. Let our heartes

cleaue vnto thee, and neuer
be estranged from thee: for
Sathan malitiously goeth about
to draw vs from thee,
by his continuall practises
suggestions & temptations,
and raiseth his instruments
to intrap vs and snare vs. But
bee vnto vs O Lord a strong
defence. And howsoeuer
our Aduersarie indeuoureth
to blemish vs and to pollute
vs with his inchantments,
transforme vs wee beseech
thee into thy owne Image,
from glorie to glorie by thy
spirit. And as thou hast banished
the night and darkenesse,
and giuen vs corporall
light: So Lord giue vs the
light of truth. Thou giuest
sight to the blind, banish our
spirituall darknes; Thou makest
the Lame to goe, take

from vs all impediments,
which this day may offer
themselues to hinder our
found and holy walking before
thee in sincere conuersations.
Thou turnest a barraine
wildernes into a fruitfull
Land, and againe thou
makest a fruitful Lād barrain
for the wickednesse of them
that dwell therein. Make
fruitful our barraine heartes
in al goodnesse and spiritual
graces: sow the good seed
of liuely faith aud true obedience
in vs: and water it
by thy holy Spirit that wee
may bring forth the fruites
of a holy and sanct
                  •
               fied life,
Turne the Wildernes of our
profane conue
                  •
               sations, into
a Garden of godly vertues.
Thou hast raised vs from the
deadnesse of our corporall

sleepe: this morning breath
now into our dull & drowsie
soules thy sacred spirit, that
we may be so reuiued, and
spiritually cheered, that wee
may with holy and heauenly
ioy and comfort betake vs
to our corporall businesses:
giue vs strength of bodie, &
the vse of our limbes, & senses:
giue vs vnderstanding
hearts to performe our duties
diligently, faithfully, and
truly in our callings, And let
all thinges prosper vnto vs
this day, that wee shall take
in hand: for we acknowledg
that it is thy goodnesse, that
hath kept vs this night past
for which wee yeeld thee all
humble thankes, beseeching
thee to bee with vs this day:
guard & keep vs & whatsoeuer
thou hast giuen vs, for

wee recommend our selues,
our sou
                  •
               es, our bodies, and
goods, into thy holy protection
& keeping this day. And
remooue from vs Lord that
curse, that in seeing we shuld
not see, and in hearing wee
should not vnderstand: but
quicken vs according to thy
louing kindnesse that wee
may lōg for thy word: make
it sweet vnto vs, by a sanctified
desire to heare, and a
holy zeale to practise this
day and euer the testimonies
of thy mouth. AMEN. Our
Father, &c.
            
            Lord increase our faith.
         
         
            
            An Euening Prayer for
priuat Families.
            MOst gracious, merciful,
euerliuing, & most
louing Lord God; wee are
heere gathered together before
thee, to yeeld thee thāks
for thy goodnesse & mercies
this day past vouchsafed vnto
vs, weake and vnworthy
of so great a fauour at thy
hands, by reason of our manifold
sins & offences committed
against thee. For by
nature Lord we can doe nothing
but displease thee. By
the transgression of the first
man Adam wee haue all sinned:
now by the merits of
the second man Christ let vs
be made righteous: let the
perfection of his obedience

satisfie for the imperfection
of ours. Our disobedience
hath beene intollerable, our
rebellions horrible, and our
seruing of thee this day past
punishable. The thoughts of
our hearts haue been sinfull,
the wordes of our mouthes
deceitfull, the workes of our
hands hatefull. Such, and so
euill haue we euer been, that
what we should haue done,
we haue left vndon, what we
shold not haue don we haue
don it with eagernes & greedines:
and thus profanely
haue we passed this day, now
come to an end. O remēber
not Lord our offences, reward
vs not according to
our euil imaginations: mark
not what we haue spoken amisse,
nor punish vs according
to our workes this day.

Create in vs, wee beseech
thee, cleane hearts, renew
right spirits within vs; fill
our heads with fountains of
teares, that we may night &
day recount & bewaile our
sinnes in the bitternes of our
harts. Let this be the last day,
the last houre, the last momēt
of our wilfull offending thy
Maiestie; and let vs not carrie
thine indignation for
our sinnes to our beddes
                  •
               
but let vs instantly cast off
our corrupt affectiōs, and by
truly and vnfeinedly repe
                  •
               ting
obtaine remission in the
merits and mediation o
                  •
                
               Iesus
Christ the right
                     •
                  ous, who
is a propitiation for ou
                     •
                   sinnes.
Giue vs grace Lord to d
                  •
               aw
neere vnto thee: for thou
hast promised to preserue
the state of the righteous;

and all that forsake thee shal
be cōfounded. Be thou therfore
our strong rocke, wherunto
we may alwaies resort.
Haue mercie vpon vs, O L.
haue mercie vpon vs: giue
vs helpe in trouble; for 
                  •
               ain
is the helpe of man. Giue vs
a holy feare of thy great and
glorious Name: for great, O
Lord is thy goodnes, which
thou hast laide vp for them
that feare thee. Knit our
hearts vnto thee through
faith in loue, that we may be
of the number of them that
shall partake of thy glorie
with Christ, that where thou
art there we may bee to behold
thy glorie. Increase our
faith: open the eyes of our
dimme and dull vnderstanding▪
that wee may 
                  •
               ee the
wonderfull workes of thy

mercies towards vs, euen in
the darknesse of our corporall
liues: when our naturall
eyes shall bee shut vp with
the feeblenesse of our bodies
by sleepe, thou sleepest not
nor slumberest, but wa
                  •
               chest
ouer thine, and sufferest no
man to doe them violence,
thou preseruest them in thy
prouidence, thou defendest
them vnder the shadow of
thy wings, not onely in their
corporall employments and
bodily labours, but when
they are in their deepest forgetfulnesse
of their owne
dangers, and of weakest abilitie
to helpe themselues, in
the deadnesse of sleepe. Preserue
vs Lord, be watchfull
ouer vs, let thy holy Angels
attend about our beddes, let
them be thy ministers of our

safetie; let not our sleepe be
dangerous but comfortable
vnto vs; let not our delight
be set on that sluggish ease,
and slothfull wallowing in
our beds as breedeth diseases
and corrupt humors. But
as sleepe is the fruite of our
corrupt nature, which without
rest cannot continue: so
let vs vse it as matter of necessitie,
not of wantonnesse
& carnall contentment. Saue
vs from that curse of the
wicked, that we should wax
worse and worse: and that
though wee haue liued long
after the vanities of the flesh,
let vs not end in the same: &
though we haue not, as wee
ought, brought forth the
fruits of the spirit, let vs now
begin to liue in him, and our
spirits be ruled, directed, salted

and seasoned by thy holy
and sanctifying spirit: so
though our mortall bodies
sleepe, our sanctified spirits
may watch for the comming
of the bridegroome, that we
be not found like the foolish
V
                  •
               rgins, with emptie and
blind Lamps, but prepared
to meete the Lambe in the
cloudes with ioy, among the
rest of thy Saints. In the
meane time keep vs: we recommend
our selues, and all
that we haue into thy gracious
keeping, in that thy deerest
Sonne, our Sauior Christ
Iesus, to whom with thee &
thy holy Spirit, bee
praise eternally.
Amen. Our
Father,
&c.
            
            Lord increase our faith.
