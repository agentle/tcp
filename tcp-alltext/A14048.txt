               IT is not vnknowen unto your Princely Maieſtie that of late iaſked yow leue to hūt a certeyn romiſhe fox / withe in the boūdes of your dominiones / whiche had bene hyd more thē ſeuen yeares / among the Biſhopes of Englande / after that your hyghenes had commanded them to dryue hym clerely out of all places where as ye / haue any poure ot or dominacion. And now am i crediblely informed / that ye haue ſene the cours that i had at thys forſayde fox yowre fo / withe many of your nobles & learned men / whiche i ſuppoſe will not denyſ but that i haue founde oute the fox / withe my hoū
               des / in the ſelf places where as i rekened before my huntyng to fynde hym / that is in the chirche

a monge the biſſhoppes & preſtes whome ye cō
               manded ſtraytly to dryue hym awaye / But as ſoun as my houndes had founde out the fox and held hym at a bay / that he kould nether go back nor furthe / redy to be taken if any mā / wold haue layde handes upō hym / a certayn ſworn aduocate of thys beſte / a doctor of the popis doctrine / droue mi houndes from the beſte / and reſcued hym and ſaued hys lyfe bearyng me in hande that the beaſte was no fox / but on of your rede dear / euen as i prophecied before that the foxy generation wold call theyr father the fox when ſoeuer that he ſhuld cum in any ieperdy of takynge. Thys forſayd proctour of the beſte calleth hym / not alon your rede dere / but alſo good ordre / good polytike lawes / where withe good hathe en cloſed all youre ſubiectes vnder your autorite alone / the pale of the Engliſhe chirche / withe diuers ſuche other goodly names. How beit at lengthe / he grā
               tethe hym ſelf / that the beſte whiche i hunt is the romiſhe fox in dede / but that it was nether youre mynde nether any wyſe mannis mynde / to dryue out the hole fox / but that it was thought ſufficiēt if hys eares were only cut of harde by the rootes all rhe reſte of hys body and eſpecially hys gorgious and fayre tale / remanyng vntouched / And where as i diſprayſed the beſte withe diuers other / he as it becummeth an aduocate / prayſeth hym hyghly / ſayng that thoghe in one thyng he hathe don amis / that is where as he preferred hym ſelf aboue the lyon whiche is kynge of all beſtes / 

yit that in all other thynges he is good good good and commendable / & that if he were dryuen away with all hys ordinances / that all ſemelynes / all relygious & deuout behauore & all godlynes ſhuld bedryuen a wey alſo / what is thys ellis but to make agod of the fox? Thys forſayde patron of the fox was one of them whome i accuſed in my former courſe / for a couerer and a manteyner of the romiſhe fox & hys whelpes / But now (by what meanes it is cum to paſſ i can not tell) he is cummed from a defendent and a perſone accuſede to be an accuſer / an examiner & a iudge / ouer the mater whiche is in controuerſy betwene him & me. I lay vnto his charge that he is the mā
               tener of the fox / whiche i proue bothe withe ſcripture & natural reſon / & he beyng accuſed hym ſelf / examineth my witneſſes / and refuſeth them all together at hys pleaſure / & callethe me heretike & iudgely pronuncieth that i am an heretike / but with out any witnes or reſon at all. I beſech your learned hyghenes to conſydre whether thys mater be in differently handlede or no / that on man openly accuſed of a greate offence / ſhallbe bothe defendent examiner iudge & accuſer all ate one tyme. Is it any meruel if the thefe eſcape hā
               gynge whiche is ſuffered to be hys own examiner & iudge (If that lucifer the greate deuel might haue ſuche liberti / to do what he lyſt to accuſe whon he wolde / & then to be bothe hys own witnes & iudge / wo ſhuld cum to all goodmen & he ſhuld neuer be condemned hys ſelf whiche were

great pytie. Where fore i beſeche your hyghnes / as thys mater that is betwen us / is no ſmall mater / to appoynte ſum indifferent learned men / ſum of the Clergie / & other ſum of the laite / to examin frely with out ieperdy of theyr lyues / thys mater whiche is betwene uſe / and not to ſuffer my aduerſary bothe to be my accuſer and examiner / and his iudge and myne bothe together all at one tyme. Thys ones brought to paſſ and licence once granted agayn to hunt the rauenyng fox / which i dowt not but that ye will grant me for the loue that ye haue to the libertie of your louing ſubiectes / i truſt that we ſhall not nede here af ter to hunt the fox any more / hys ayders & manteyners and he ſhall be ſo manifeſtly and openly knowen / who and where they be. Thys that i go about ſhall not ouly miniſh the murder of the cruel fox / and purches ſpirituall liberti unto many agood man / but alſo ſhall turn to the great honor and good name of all the hole realme / whiche in many cuntrees is ſore ſflandered for to be au upholder of the beſte that we pretēded to banniſſ he away / They that ſit ot home and haue not bene in far cuntrees / cannot tell what reporte goethe abrode in other landes of our nacion / But they whiche ar and haue bene in ſtrange landes / ar comppelled ſumtymes to heare it that they wold not heare uery gladly / of our cuntre for holdyng of ſuche doctrine and ordinances as all the worlde knowethe to be of the biſſhop of romes makyng cand contrary to the holy worde of God.

Who grante yow helth of bothe body and ſoule / uictori ouer your enemies and grace to do in thys our mater of religion as ſhall be moſt to the / glori of God and the profit of the comun welthe / 
            Amen.
         
      
      
         
            
            THE RESCVER OF THE ROMISHE FOX AND hys whelpes, agaynſt the hunter & hys houndes.
            
               THe examination of a prowd praeſumptuous hunter / who under a crafty praetence of huntyng the romiſhe fox / breakethe the pale of the encloſed park / and with hys raſheand knauiſhe houndes entendethe to deſtroy the dere of the ſame.
            
               The Hunter
               All Good and indifferent men whiche haue ſene my huntynge can beare me recorde that the intent and purpoſe of it was to fynde out the romiſhe fox / and to proue that he was ſtill abydynge in Englonde / and that ye maſter gardinere with your companiones did manteyn and holde hym ſtill in the realme / contrari to the kyngis commandament / whiche appoynted yow to dryue hym clerly out of all places of hys dominion. And yow alſo yowr ſelfe in thys your examination grant that it is the biſſhop of romis doctrine that i write agaynſt but that it is not there for tobe caſt away / becawſe he hathe tawght & ordened it. There fore i hunt the fox in dede and not praetende to hunt hym as ye ſay. But how

chanceth thys / that yow / whome with youre other felows i haue in my huntyng accuſed of idolatri / of hereſi and mantenance of the fox / the kyngis enemi / that in the ſtede of an anſwerer / ye ar now becumed my examiner / and iudge / and your own iudge alſo? It is far agaynſt all reſon that ye whiche haue long bene my open enemi / and ar my aduerſarie in thys cauſe ſhal be now alowed to be an examiner and a iudge of me and mi accuſation / whether i accuſe you ſufficiently orno / ſeyng that hatrede blyndeth all examiners and iudges. It is as far wyde from all ryght that ye ſhal be allowed to be an examiner and a iudge vpon the accuſation made agaynſt your ſelf / ſeing that as Plato ſayethe / no man canbe an equal & indifferent iudge of hym ſelfe / for eueryman is blynde in that thyng whiche he louethe / Therfore it were more ſemyng that ye ſhuld leue of your examination / and anſwere to youre accuſation / Ye reſemble miche in maners your holy father pope iuly the ſecund / whiche after that he was dede and depoſed from hys popedom / (as it is writen of hym (commanded ſaynt peter ſo imperiouſly to lete hym in at heuen gates / as he had wont to cō
                  mande hys ſeruantes when he was alyue / euerdremyng of hys old ſtate as thoge he hadbene a lordely pope ſtill / ſo ye maſter gerdiner / the comune examiner of all them that ar accuſed for breakyng the traditiones ordened by your popiſhe fathers / whether the tranſgreſſion be don in your dioceſe or your brother bonors (whiche wold be

better but for yow) when it is at the laſt ones cū
                  mede to your courſe to he accuſed of hereſi and idolatri your oun ſelfe / ye dreame ſtill that ye ar an examiner / as ye had wont to be / as Iulius dre med ſtill thatt he was pope / If thys be not ſo it is lykely that of a ſet purpoſe ye will not ſeme to be accuſed of hereſi and idolatri and of the mantenance of the fox / leſte any other beſyde me ſhulde ariſe here after and accuſe yow of the forſayde crymes as i do / and then the accuſationes of ij ſhulde be allowed / or at the leſte ſhuld betaken for a comon reporte / and then it ſhuldbe harde for yow / withe all the hally watter that ye made thes ſeuen yeares / to purge poure ſelfe from the fame of a popiſhe heretike / as ye can not euen at thys houre withe all the learnyng and law that ye haue clere your ſelfe from the thyng it ſelf whiche makethe a popiſhe heretike / Therfore for feare ye ſhuld be accuſed here after of papiſtri hereſi and Idolatri and that my accuſation ſhuld nether be taken for a witnes nor an increaſe of the comon fame that ye be a popiſhe heretik / ye make your ſelf an examinet / diſſemblyng that ye ar accuſed / of the crymes aboue reherſed / Where as ye call me a proud preſumptuous hunter / he that knew bothe yow and me and ower lyuynges & ſaw youre mule / your iely ſtyropis your gentle men goyng before yow in theyr ueluet cotes / your daly apparel and myne your caſtyng of your noſe in the winde ly ke as a ſtorke doth in hyr neſt / wold ſay (or ellis i am deceyued)

that i had good occaſion to ſay / hypocrite or diſguiſed player pul firſte ſurthe the beame of thy own ey & then take own the mote of myne. Wherfore am i proude? my houndes haue no ueluet colars / my nettes ar not of ſilke / I can not geſſ whi that i ſhuld be called proude except it be for huntyng of the proude fox your father whiche makethe emperoures and kynges kyſ his fet / and yow whiche haue ſo many proude ueluet cotes goyng be fore yow euery day. What mean ye by your ſayng that i break the pale of the incloſed parke? What meane ye by the pale / and what is thys parke? So far as i can ſpye / ye mean by the parke / the Chirche of englonde / and by the pale / the unprofitable & letworde ceremonies whiche were ones thurſt in to the chirche by the Biſſhop of rome Telme for what intēt haue yow and your fathers made thys pale of youres / for the chirche of englonde / to hold in / or to hold out ſumthyng that ſhuld not cū in? If ye haue made your traditional / and ceremonial / pale to kepe the dere within it that they may not go furthe to get them ſelues ſum good meat abrode / whē as ye ether gyne them non but contagious meat / or lok up theyr good meat from them (as ye dyd of late when ye tooke the worde of God from / them and commanded them in payn of deathe to eat your ſtollen brede that is to kepe your traditiones) ye do the thyng your ſelfe whiche ye lay falſely un to my charge / that is ye kill ſum of the kyngis dere withe poy ſo ned meat and other ſum withe hungre.

If your pompons pale be made to holde out / ye haue welobteyned your purpoſe / for wiche your ceremonies and mannis inuentiones / whiche ye grant that the pope hathe made / ye hold out the worde of god whiche ſhuld only be the meat of all the deare of thys parke / and the true preachers of the ſame / for hally water muſt be coniured / and caſt about / then it muſt be expounded what it me anethe / legendes / ſequences ſecretes colates ante mes litanies and dirges for the dede muſt ether be ſayde or ſong / the cros muſt be crepto an kiſſed aſſhes and hally brede muſt be taken / palmes and candelles muſt be borne / thes ceremonies muſt haue theyr tyme to be don and expounded in whiche tyme / the word of god myght be red and expounded / but if ether of bothe muſt be left undon the worde of god muſt be left of / for the ceremonies ar rekened to be goddis ſeruice as the worde of god is not rekened / How many preachynges ar on Chriſten mes day nay it is to dere a day or to hye a feſte to preache on it / & the holy ceremonies may not be left of for the prechyng. I heard ones an indifferently well learned diuine ſay on a Chriſten meſſday / a ſhort ſermon wolddo well to day / as a long ſermon were not alowable / for hyndering of the ceremonyes whiche ye call god dis ſeruice / If a preacher cum from oxford or cambridge / frely to preache the worde of god to the peple / & require to be heard / the preſte uſeth to gyne thys anſiuere to the preacher / if he ſmell any thyng of the new learnyng / we muſt thys

day rede the ſix articles other wiſe called gardiners goſpel / and ſo the preacher goethe away / Therfore your traditional pale holdeth out in dede. If that ye ſay that your pale holde the out here tikes / the contrari is true / for loykyn of an werp that arche heretike / the ſpoylers / & the dauidianes with all other ſuche ſectes with all theyr folowers kepe all the ceremonies that ar kept in Englond and mo to / and alow them as decent rites / and yit for all that thys pale of your ceremonies cannot hold out / damnable and deteſtable hereſies and heretices out of thos parkes wher of they ar the pales / Thys pale of youris after my iudgement is not the pale of our engliſh chirche / or at leſte ſhuld not be / but it is the pale of the poe pis pyn fold / where in / ye and your felowes ſet all them agaynſt theyr willes / whiche haue agaynſt your myndes / taſtede of the corne of goddis vnmingled worde / your pale may be called the pale of the popis gardin / where of byſſhop ſteuē ye ar gardiner / and there in ye compell all men to worke & to eat of your popiſhe wedes in payne of deathe / The pale of all the rede dere of chriſtis hyrde / is the word of god / which wil holde all that argood / with in theyr boundes / if they will not kep them with in ther boundes the chefe keper wereth not a wodknyfe in vayn / To breake thys pale were playn felony / but to break your popiſhe pale and to ſet it all in a fyre in my mynde were a dede of charite no leſſ thē the dede of Ezechias / which brake the braſen ſerpent / for he that ſhuld

breke / your pale / ſhuld delyuer many a pore pryſoner pituouſly pyned with in youre popiſh pynfold. And where ye ſay that i intend to deſtroy the dere of the parke that is the kynges ſubiectes / it is not true for i intend only to hunt out the fox and to fynde out hys fautors and manteyners / If ye fele your ſelf in ieperdy of your lyfe by my huntyng / then ar yow ether the fox or on of hys manteyners / for theyr ar no other in ieperdy by my huntyng.
            
            
               The reſcuer
               Syth it hathe pleaſed allmyghty God / autor of unite to raduce thys realme to perfect accorde and agrement in the truthe / and by good polytike lawes / hathe under the ouly autorite of the kyngis maieſti encloſed / and as is were imparted / the derebeloued ſubiectes for theyr ſauegarde / with in the forche and ſtreynghe of the ſame / how mych is it to be lamented / to ſe arrogance in the eyes of the ſayde ſubiectes / as with breache and uiolacion of the ſayd lawes / to make a tumult and a clamor / under pretence of huntynge the fox that is

all redy dryuen out / therby to moue and troble the hartes of the good peple / and to corrupt ſuche other as be eaſy for theyr ſimplicite to be ſeduced.
            
            
               The hunter
               To thank allmyghty god for all hys benefittes whiche he hathe ſent uſ / and to knowledge that they cam from hym / when we haue the beneſittes / it is i grant well don / and thankefully / but if therſites the fowleſt of xv thowſande and mo / ſhuld thank God for hys beateous and well fauored face / ſhuld he not trifle? Euen ſo do ye to thank God for it that ye haue not / that is for accorde and agrement in the truthe / when as the thyrd parte of the realm diſſentethe from the other ij partes in the cauſe of religion / There ar x thowſande and mo honeſt men in englonde whiche in theyr conſciences diſſent from yow / & hate with all theyr hartes your falſ doctrine / whiche ye ſo erneſtly withe worde and writyng do defende / There ar biſſhoppes in inglond & many honorable men of the tē
                  peralti whiche diſſent from yow and all thē that uphold the popiſhe doctrine that ye defende / There is not a citi nor a great town in all englonde where in ar not many that diſſent from yow in doctrine & wold openly ſpeake agaynſt yow if they durſt / your ſeruātes of late wold haue the pope hede oſ te chirche / the biſſhop of cātorberies ſeruātes will haue the kynge ſupreme hede in hys oun realm / is not here / good agremēt? The moſte parte / 

of all the learned men both of oxforde and cambrydge whiche haue bene brougth up in the boſum of the holy ſcriptur / wold be delyuerde gladly of the unberable burdē of ſeruile cerimonies / where withe they ar bothe hyndered, from theyr ſtudy and the laymen ar hyndered from hearynge of the worde of god / The more then moſte parte of vnlearned mattenmūblynge ſacrifieers whiche can do nothyng ellis but / play in ceremonies and / caſt hallywater with all them haue takem any degre in the canon law / ſaue a uery few (truely i know non) wold haue the popis cere moties to continue ſtill and yit ye ſay that theyr is ſo good agrement in the truthe / The cok and the fox ar enemies on agaynſt an other / the fox lo uethe not the cok / be lyke becauſe he with hys crowyng / bewrayethe the fox when he wold on the night cum to worry hennes / Then when all the cokkes ar dede / or ellis put to ſylence / the fox rekeneth that he hathe good peace that he may worry hennes & chikkinges and do what ſo euer he lyſt / noman ſpeakyng on worde agaynſt hym Go ye ij footed foxes after that ye haüe kylled iij well crowyng cokkes at a caſt for crowyng only a gaynſt yowr doctrine / and haue pulled all the fethers of ij cokkes of kynde / and haue put them to ſylence / & haue brought the mater ſo to paſſ that nether cok nor hē nor chikking for feare of theyr ly ues dare ſpeake one worde agaynſt your deueliſh doctrine / and that no man may examin your doctrine whether it be argeyng with the worde of

god or no / ye reken that the yr is good agreament and peace of opiniones / in the realme / There is i grante great accorde and agrement among yowe traditionerres / and that non of yow diſſenteth from an other / in popiſtri / but how can ye agre to gether in the truthe whiche perſecute the truthe and forbid it to be red / leſte by redyng of it men myght ſpye out your noughty lyvyng & deueliſh doctrine? The ſcripture is as it were the lyght of the day the preachres ar as cokkes & wate chemē / theues & murderers hate bothe / therfore haue ye forbyddē the ſcripture / to be red openly in the chir che / & put preachres to ſilence or kill them that be wray your vngodlynes / What agrement is thys in the truthe? Where ye ſay that god hathe inclo ſed thekyngis derebeloued ſubiectes only under the autorite of hys maieſtie / by good polytike lawes / what meāe ye by thes lawes? meane ye god dis polytike lawes or man̄is polytike lawes? By thes polytike lawes ye cannot underſtande the law of moſes / nether the law of the goſpel / for ye mean of ſuche lawes as ye accuſe me here after to be a tranſgreſſor and a breaker of / in the huntyng of the fox / in thes wordes / with uiolatione of the ſayd lawes / to make a tumult under the pre tence of huntyng the fox / but in my huntyng of the fox i wrote only agaynſt thos ceremonies & traditiones whiche ye can̄ot deni but the biſſhop of rome hathe made / therfore ye mean by your politike lawes of whos tranſgreſſion ye accuſe me / nether the lawes of the new teſtament nor

the olde / but the ceremonies and traditiones / whiche the biſſhop of rome hathe ordened. If that i had writen in my huntyng agaynſt the lawes of moſes / or the goſpel / ye myght haue found out ſum excuſe for your ſelf / but now ſeyng that i wrote only agaynſt the popis ceremonies / i gather of yow thys / that ye ſay that god hathe incloſed & as it were inparked / the kyngis dere beloued ſubiect es / vnder the authorite of the kyngis maieſti alone / by the ceremonies & traditiōes which ye grāt that the pope hath ordened / for other polytike lawes can ye not meane of in thys place / I beleue that all the ſubiectes of all kynges and emperourers ar encloſed under theyr autoxite alon / bi the euerlaſtinge worde of good / and not by any corruptible polytike law of man / for as man is corruptible ſo is all that he makethe / then if the kyngis ſubiectes be encloſed ūder hys autorite by mā
                  nis polytike lawes / whē thes lawes is broken (as he that maked a law may breake the ſame agayn) the kynges ſubiectes ar no longer under hyſ auto rite / wherby ye gyue mē occaſion to gather of yow that yemeāe that the kyng is ſupreme guerner of all hys ſuciectes & all hys / ar under hys autorite alon / by the popis cerēonies & traditiones / Is not thys a ſuer grounde that ye byld the kynges ſupremeci upon? Hathe not the kyng autorite ēoghe of the ſcripture for to māteyn hysſupremeci with al but that he muſt be fayn to fet ſum of the popis ceremonies to help the ſcripture whiche were not able to do it alōe? What a craſty for is thys to ſay

that ceremonies encloſe the kynges ſubiectes under hys autorite alone / for that intent that the kyngis hyghnes ſeing that hys ſuprēicie were fortified with ceremonies / ſuld be the redier to fortifi thē agayne / Mark alſo ā other ſubtiltie of the fox / where as in my former hūtyng i made ſuche argumētes agaynſt the popis ceremōies & traditi ones as he could not ſolute / now becauſe he ſeyng that he cānot defēde the pope ūder the nāe of ceremonies & traditiōes / now calleth hym good polytike lawes where with the kyngis ſubiectes ar incloſed under hys autorite alō / & after thys meruelous trāſformatiō / he makethe the popis ceremonies the kyngis polytike lawes / Marck alſo how that he wold makethe pope the kyngis frēde whi lſi he makeththe popis ceremōies māteyners of the kyngis ſupremeci / for whē as the pop & hys doctrine ar al on / if the popis ceremonies māteyn the kyngis ſupremeci / the pope doth the ſame / Is not the kyngis hyghnes myche bound to maſter gardiner for purcheſſyng hym ſuch a frende? Now ſyr tell me / if ye cā / whiche of thes polytike lawes that i haue writen agaynſt haue encloſed the kyngis ſubiectes under hys autorite? If that there be no polytike lawes whiche i haue writen agaynſt that incloſeth the kyngis ſubiectes under hys autorite alon (as iam ſuere ye can ſhew non that i wrote agaynſt) then muſt ye be taken as ye haue bene many a day / for an impudent & an vnſhamefaced lyer Becauſe ye ſay that i breake good polytike lawes / &

therwithe make a tumult and a clamor / let me know i pray yow whiche good polytike lawes i haue broken and i ſhal knoledge my offence & take the poniſhement worthy for ſuche an offence / I wrote agaynſt a ſorte of popiſhe ceremonies / & vngodly tradiciones / but that i remembre i neuer in all my booke wrote agaynſt one polytike law / A polytike law is an ordinance deuiſed by wiſe men for the profit of a citie or a cuntre / or a comon welth / Suche ordinances did not i ones touch in my booke / let them be iudges which haue red the book / And that thys manis lying may be more manyfeſte i will ſhorthy per uſe and go thorow all the traditiones whiche i haue ether made mention of or ſpoken agaynſt in my boke / What polytike law is it to command all the peple of a realme / to knele before a pece of molten or caſten ſyluer to crepe to it / and to kiſſ it / and to ſyng Crucem tuam adoramus Domine, lorde we worſhip thy croſſ? What polyci is it to go ſo erneſtly about to dryue the deuel out of acorn or ij of ſalt whiche noman eatethe / and to coniure the deuel out of the hally water fat where noman ſaylethe and to ſuffer hym to be ſtill / in the great heapes of ſalt wher with mennis meat / is ſeaſoned / and to let hym tary ſtill vn coniured in the great ryuers / and brode ſe / and in the alefattes?

of the Apoſtelles and of the reſt of Chriſtis chirche? or was the Emperour the ſpirituall hede of Chriſtes chirche in thos dayes? if ye ſay nay / no more is any man in earth now hede of Chriſtis myſticall body whiche is the chirche Paul alſo to the Epheſianes in the v. chapter ſayethe / the huſband is hede ouer hys wyfe as Chriſte is hede of the chirche but a good huſband will haue no mo hedes of hys wyfe / but hymſelf alone / ſo nomore will Chriſte haue any mo hedes of hys myſtical body and hys ſpouſe the chirche but hym ſelf nether is it nedeful to haue any ſpirituall / vnder hede of thys hys myſtical body for lak of hys preſence for he hath promyſed us that he will be with us unto the ende of the world / And as cōcernyng ſpirituall maters Chriſte gaue unto peter as myche autorite as he gaue unto any kyng or Emperour that ether is or was or ſhall be / when he gaue hym the keyes of the kyngdom of heuen but he made not peter nether any other of the Apoſtelles nether Chefe hede of the chirche / nether vnder hede of it / therfore ar nether Emperoures nor kynges popes nor biſſhopes nether vnder nor ouer ſpiritual hedes of the chirche whiche is Chriſtes myſtical body / To conclud i hold that the kyng our maſter is the ſuprem polytike hede vnder god both of all the ſpiritualti / and alſo of the temperalty of England and irelande and that there is nether ſpirituall nor politike hede in earthe aboue hym / nether biſſhop kyng nor emperour / If thys be not enoghe that i gyue unto the kyngis hyghnes tell

               The hunter
               Where ye ſay that i hunt the fox vnder the chalice / and therby mean that i hunt agaynſt the Sacrament / your lordſhip lyethe as ye had wont to do / for i ſay not that the fox is vnder the chalice / but i ſay that i truſt that if the kyng fynde the fox vnder the chalice / that he will no more ſuffer

hym to haue ſauctuarj there / then Salomon ſuffered ioab to haue any ſanctuarij of the aultare / When i ſay thoghe ſteuen gardiner had brought up of hys coſtes / all the lordes children of Englond / yit i truſt for all that / if he can be proued a papiſt / that the kyng will poniſh hym as he hathe deſerued / dothe it now folow that i haue ſayd that ye haue brought up all the lordis childer in Englond? at your coſtes? i reken nay / So it foloweth not that i hunt the fox under the chalice becauſe i deſyre the kyng to let hym haue no refuge there. Howbe it if the fox ſchuld crepe ether in to / or under the chalice as he crept in to the canon of the meſſ / from whence the kyng fet hym out / & i ſhuld hunt hym out of the chalice or from in under the chalice it foloweth not that i were angry withe the chalice or intended any hurt to the Sacrament therfore / ye do not ſay the truthe wher ye ſay that i hunt the fox under the chalice and your meanyng is as falſe where ye priuely meane that intend to write agaynſt the Sacrament / I ſought the fox among yow biſſhoppes & preſtes / & was he not of late found in your ſecretari whereas he hathe bene ſo long ſecretely hyd? ye diſſemble that i ſought hym among yow / and yit the title of my book teſtifieth that i ment that he was among yow / i ſought the fox alſo in the chirche and a bout the altare where as i thought that he was / and there i am ſuere he is and hathe taken ſanctuari and will theyr ſo long abyde tyll Solomon take hym by uiolence away from

               The reſcuer
               He aſkethe whether the kyngis maieſti banniſſhed the popes name hys purſeand hys doctrine.
            
            
               The hunter
               Thys biſſhop is no more aſhamed to lye then a beſte is aſhamede to go barefot / for i ſayd thes wordes only that folow / hoo ye lordly biſſhoppes & ye clene fingred gentlemen of the clergy / is not the fox of rome otherwiſe called papa among yow? What was the pope that the kyng commāded yow to dryue out of Englonde? When as thes wer my wordes / ar ye not aſhamede to ſay that i ax the kyngis maieſti whether he hath bannyſſhed the popis purſe / name / and doctrine? Ar ye lordelly biſſhoppes and the cleene fingerede gentle men of the clergye the kyngis maieſti? it apperethe playnly that ye meane ſo / or ellis ye wold not iudge that to beſayde unto the kyngis maieſti / what ſoeuer is ſayd unto yow and to the reſte of the clergye / let men that haue leyſure here of gather more of your meanyng. Moreouer i axed not whether the kyngis maieſti banniſſhed / nether whether ye proud prelates banniſſhed the popis name / purſe and doctrine / (for i knew well that the popis doctrine was ſtill vnbanniſſhed among yow) but i axed of yow foxes whelpes / what was the pope that the kyng commanded yow to bannyſh away / and wher as i ſay / commande to bannyſhe / ye make bannyſhe

alone / as to cōmand to banniſhe / & to bāniſhe folowed by & by from the maſter to the ſeruant / If that your banniſhe had bene all one with the kyngis cōmand to bāniſhe / & the on had folowed cōſe quētly of / the other / we had had no nede at thys tyme to babble ſo mych of that beſtis bamiſſhemēt.
            
            
               The reſcuer
               And by thys diſtribution the mā makyng hym ſelf an ſwere to eche membre & parte deuyſeth hym ſelf matter there upon to triumphe / But if an other ſhuld anſwer hym / he wold ſay that the kyngis maieſti banniſſhed not the biſſhop of rome / ether for hys name alone / for hys purſe alone or for hys doctrine alone / but for all to gether.
            
            
               The hunter
               Here ye anſwer nothyng to the purpos for the queſtione was not whether the kyng had banniſſhed the pope for hys name purſe or doctrine / but it was whether the pope whiche the kyng commanded yow to dryue out of Englonde / was the popis name or hys doctrine or hys purſe / and ye make no anſwer to that queſtione / but to the great diſhonor of the kyng and of the hole realm anſwer / that the kyng hathe banniſſhed the pope for hys purſe / Is not thys a ſwete hearyng to heare on of the kyngis counſel to ſay that the kyng hathe banniſſhed the pope for hys purſe? And then ye ſay that he hath banniſſhed

the pope not for hys purſe alone but for hys purſe name and doctrine all together.
            
            
               The reſcuer
               And not for all to gether ſo as all to gether were nought but for all to gether ſo far as he miſuſethe thē. And as touchyng hys name ſo far as it ſhuld ſignifi a ſuperiorite / aboue all princes and chalenge a dominion in thys realme / ſo far is the name of pope banniſſhed / But els the god man pope of trumpyngton may in Englond lyue quietly / for the name was neuer abhorred but as it brought a wrong perſuaſione of the biſſhop of rome / by that name / where as els the biſſhop of rome / men call hym ſtill withe out danger / And as concernyng hys purſe as it was worthely expelled / ſo was it not becauſe any mony myght be taken of the ſpiritualti by theyr iuſt ſuperioures / but becauſe it myght not be iuſtly taken of hym that was nether ſuperior / nether yit did any thyng for it.
            
            
               The hunter
               Se as the fox runnethe

out and in as it were in a ſophiſtri maſe / ſum tyme bakward and ſum tyme forwarde / that my houndes ſhuld not fynde hym / How beit i gather thys of hys ſayng that the popis purſe and hys doctrine abyde ſtill in Englonde only ſo myche of them taken away as the pope hathe abuſed and that the reſt of the popis doctrine and hys purſe whiche gardiner & hys felowes can occupy well / may lawfully tary ſtill in Englonde / 
            
            
               The reſcuer
               And as concernyng ſuch doctrine as was under hym taught it was neuer under ſtand of any good man that all that whiche was taught ether by the biſſhop of rome / or vnder hys autorite / was hys own doctrine / & to be caſt away / but only that whiche was worthely to manteyn hys auctorite to be reiect with hym.
            
            
               The hunter
               The fox thoghe he be uery wyly in kepyng of hys own conſel / yit hathe he once vttered hys meanyng / and holdethe that only thos doctrines of the byſſhop of rome ought to be put away where withe he manteyneth hys ſupremecie / for he ſayethe only / whiche worde excepteth all other / and therby hemeaneth that all other doctrines teache they neuer ſo myche idolatri / ſuperflition and deueliſhnes / ought to continu in Englōd ſtill. Is not thys to cut of the foxes

eares and to let hym worriſhe pe'ſtill at hys liberti? yis i thynk ſo.
            
            
               The reſcuer
               And it whiche was good to be reteyned and kept / not becauſe it was hys / but becauſe it is good / Shall not we confeſſ Chriſte the ſon of god becauſe the deuel ſayd the ſame?
            
            
               The hunter
               To anſwer ſhorthy to all thys ſuperfluous bablyng of thys biſſhop in my huntyng i dyd not ſay that all thes doctrines that were taught under the biſſhop of rome were nought / but thys was my argument. The popis doctrine / is the pope / and ye hold ſtill the popis doctrine ergo ye hold ſtill the pope. If that the pope or any of hys taught the worde of god / that was not hys doctrine / but the doctrine of god / whiche is eiher conteyned in the new Teſtament or in the olde / and agaynſt ſuche doctrine haue i not ſpoken / nether wold i ſuche to be caſtaway / thoghi he and hys had taught it / but ſuch doctrine wold i only to be driuen a way withe the pope as the pope hathe ordened only and not Chriſte / and is ether playn manifeſt contrary to the writen worde of god or ellis uayn / idle ſuperfluous and hynderance to the prechyng of goddis undouted worde / Now bable on as long as ye leſte.
            
            
               The reſcuer
               Finally the biſſhop of rome was expelled nether fox hys

name only hys purs only / ne hys doctrine only but for all to gether / ſo far as eche of them exceded from the treuthe whiche is only mynded / all noughty doctrine is expelled withe the biſſhop of rome / and not becauſe it was hys but becauſe it was nought / It were pity that euel men ſhuld haue ſuche a ſtroke in thynges of the world / and moche leſſ of god / that what good thynge one medled withe / ſhuld be called by and by nought / Kyng richarde the thyrde / au uſurper in thys realme / brak the truſt committed unto hym / by hys brother / concernyng the preſeruation of hys childer / And yit cauſed an act of the parlement after to be made in hys tyme / that feoffes of truſt ſhuld do acordyng to theyr truſt / The autor we iuſtly hate / & yit we make myche of the law whiche is good & reſonable / Wherfore the fundacion of thys mannis reſonyng to reproue or reiect any ordinance becaus our enemy ether made it or uſed it / is uery ſlender and foliſhe. God

can be the auctor but of goodnes / Amongeſt men that is nought is nought who ſoeuer hathe uſed it / and that / that is good is good who ſoeuer hathe abuſed it. And therfore there cannot be a more fond maner of prouyng then to ſay thys is nought / and whi ſo? for ſuch a man medled with it / ſuche aman uſed it ſuche a man commanded it / to be obſerued.
            
            
               The hunter
               Becaus ye cannot conconfut my argumentes / whiche i haue made agaynſt the pope & hys traditiones / that ye myght ſeme to your frendes to ſay ſumthyng ye fayn an argument your ſelf as thoghe it were myne and reaſon ſtoutly with hiſtories & examples agaynſt it but all in vayn / & to no purpoſe / your argument whiche ye haue made in my name is thys / the pope hathe made the ceremonies of the chirche / ergo they ar to be caſt a way withe hyme / whiche argument thoghe it be not myne yit for as miche / as it is fathered on me / a litle added to it / i will make it myne and proue that if foloweth well enoghe. Neuer the leſſ that all men may ſe how unſhamfaced a lyer ye be i wil reherſe the argument that i made to proue that the pope was ſtill in englōd / The popis doctrine is the pope / but ye hold ſtill the popes' doctrine whils ye holde ſtill

the ceremonies that he made / ergo ye hold ſtill the pope / and when as i cum to the tryall of the popis ceremonies i do not as ye falſly lyk one of the vnſham faced hore of babylones ſonnes / reporte of me / only ſay the traditiones ar to bē caſt away becaus the pope made them / but i proue bothe by teſtimonies of ſcripture and by naturall reſon that they ar nonght haue i brought no other argument agaynſt / coniuryng of hally water and ſalt / crepyng to the croſſ / agaynſt the forbiddyng of preſtis mariages / agaynſt / the robri of Chriſtis cope agaynſt the ſtewes / agaynſt the ſeruice / in latin / agaynſt the preſtes receynyng of the Gacrament to win ther by to other men remiſſion of ſinnes / but that the pope made them? I report me unto all them that haue red my booke whether i haue brought ſcriptur and reſon or no / i haue brought ſuch reſones as me thynke ye can not yit wype away withe all the ſophiſtri logike & law that ye haue / & as for the other ceremonies that i reſoned not agaynſt / i dyd not ſay that they wer therfore nought becauſe the pope made them as ye lie / but i wold they whiche were uery trifles in compary ſon of thos traditiones that i wrote agaynſt / ſhuld be eſtemed bi the other whiche ſemed miche more gorgiōs thē they were / not cōfutyng them becawſe bothe my book ſhuld haue bene to long and alſo they neded no confutation when theyr ibetters as they appered / wer proued to be nought / Now what will the ſtory of kyng Richard help yow? ſeyng your fundacion is fals.

But i pray yow what an argument is thys / kyng richard beyng an euel man / made a good polytike law / ergo the pope thoghe he be an euel man may make a good doctrine that god neuer made / whiche is godly & neceſſari for Chriſtis chirche / Ariſtotel and Plato were infideles and made good polytike lawes for the comon welthe ergo they culd alſo make good and godly and neceſſari doctrines for Chriſtis chirche / Your argument foloweth not where ye argue an euel man may make good politike lawes for the body / ergo he may alſo make good and holſum doctrine for the ſoul / Thys maner of reſonyng from the leſſ to the more affirmatiuely / is alowed in no logike nor learnyng that euer i haue ſene / But leſte ye ſhuld make your excuſe and ſay / that your argument is from lyke to kyke / and as it were thus made / kyng richarde an euel man made a good polytike lawe ergo the pope may make a good polytike law / i will proue that ye take not thes ceremonies and traditiones for polytik lawes / which ar profitable for the gouernance of a coman welthe but for lawes for the ſoule / Eccleſiaſticall lawes / and for bothe promotors of goddis honor and for goddis ſeruice alſo / ye and more ouer i can proue that ye take thes ceremonies for the commandementes of god and make the breakers of them the breakers of goddis commandementes / whiche if i do / then procedethe your argument thus an euel man may make / good polytike lawes / ergo he can alſo make good lawes for mannis ſaule and ſo

holſum doctrines for the chirche of Chriſte that if they were takē away all ſemelynes / & godlynes ſhuld be takē away withe them as ye ſay here after expreſſedly of takyng away of the popis cererionies / In yowr Catechiſme lately ſet out in the kyngis name writyng vpon the fourth cōmandment ye ſay thus of the popis ceremonies agaynſt the whiche i haue writen / partely in my huntyng of the fox.) Lykewyſe do they all breake thys commādment / whiche do not obſerue but deſpiſe ſuche laudable ceremonies of the chirche as ſet forthe goddis honor / & appertayn vnto good order to be vſed in the chirche / And ther fore concernyng ſuch ceremonies of the chirche as haue bene inſtituted by oure fore fathers / and be alowed by the princes or kynges of the dominiones as hallowyng of the font / of the chalice / of the corporace of the altare / & other lyke exorciſmes and benedictiones / ſprynklyng of holy water / gyuyng of holy brede / bearyng of cādelles / & palmes crepyng to the croſſ / and other lyke laudable cuſtomes rites & ceremonies / ar not to be deſpiſed / but to be obſerued.) Then can ye not ſay that ye meane by the popis traditiones polytſke lawes / for god gaue no cōmandment of polytyke lawes in the ten cōmandmentes / but left that in the liberti of Princes to make as many or as few as they thynk neceſſari for theyr ſubiectes / but ye weue thes ceremonies vnder the cōmandment of god / & to your great ſhame ye make thē commādmentes of god / for if the tranſgreſſion of ceremonies be the breakyng

of goddis cōmandment / then muſt the kepyng of them be the kepyng of goddis cōmādment / & they muſt alſo be goddis cōmandmentes. If that a mā cum not to the chirche to krepe to the croſ / to bear candelles to heare meſ in atong that he vnder ſtā
                  deth not / ſay not ye vnto hym whi wilt thow not cum to goddis ſeruice? Is goddis ſeruice a polytike law? thē it is playn that althoghe ve once ſayd ſo / ye meane not by the popes traditiones polytike lawes. Now let vſſe whether thys argumēt foloweth or no. The pope only being / a man & that an euel / man brought in to Chriſtrs chirche & commāded to be kept / thes ceremonies & traditiones whiche ar not founde in any place of goddis worde ergo they ought to be caſt out of the chirche agayne / That the pop is amāye will grant me / but that he is only a mā your canō law wil deny / for it ſayeth that the pope may do that amā may not do that is to ſerperate whome god had copled to gether / that the pope is an euel mā 
                  & a falſ Prophet i dout whether ye will grant me thys / both with hart and mouthe or no i muſt therfore proue it as well as i can / He is the kyngis enemy & an uſurper of autorite vnto hym ſelf that god gaue hym neuer / ergo he is an euel mā / but i will if i cā bryng a reaſon or two ſumthyng ſtrōger to proue that he is Antichriſt and a falſe Prophete & ther for that he is an euel man / He is Antichriſte whiche teacheth falſ and cōtrary doctrine ūto Chriſtis doctrine / & taketh it vpō hym which belongethe ōly vnto Chriſte / the pope dothe ſo for he teacheth that

Peter was hede of the hole catholike chirche ouer all kynges and Emperoures and aboue all the reſt of the Apoſtelles and that he is aboue all Emperoures and kynges and that they ar bound to obey hym and not he them / and that he beyng but a biſſhop hathe bothe the ſwordes / of the word / and of temporall correction / with many ſuche other falſe doctrines which becauſ they ar well knowen i nede not greatly to reherſe / That he is a falſe Prophete i proue it thus by the autorite of the Prophet Ezechiel whiche paynteth your father and yow ſo playnly as thoughe he had ſene yow bothe together / In the thyrtent chatpter he ſayethe thus / Son of man Propheci agaynſt the Prophetes of Iſrael / whiche prophecie / and ſay unto them that propheſi out of theyr oun hart heare the worde of the lord / Thus ſayeth the lord god / Wo be unto the fooliſh Prophetes which go after theyr own ſpret when as they haue ſene nothyng / Thy Prophetes (o Iſrael) ar made lyke foxes in the wildernes ye haue not gone up to the burſtynges / nether haue ye made an hedge for the houſe of Iſrael to ſtand in battale in the day of the lord. They haue ſene uanite / and a falſ propheci ſayng / the lorde hath ſayde / when as the lorde hathe nor ſent them / & they truſt that theyr worde ſhal ones be alowed / Haue ye not ſene a vayn viſion / and ſpoken a lying propheſi? And ye haue ſayde / the lorde hathe ſayd when as i haue not ſayd it / Ther fore ſayethe the lorde god / for as myche as ye haue ſpoken uanite / and haue ſene a

And ye ſhal know that i am the lorde / Now becauſe they haue deceyued my peple ſayng peace when there is no peace / and he byldeth a wall / and they playſter it ouer with an vnprofitable cruſte / Say vnto them that make an vnprofitable plaſteryng of it that it ſhall fall / and ther ſhall be a ſhowre flowyng in / and ye ſhall fall with the ſtones of the hale / and the wynde of the tempeſt ſhall bruſt yow / And behold when the wall fallethe / ſhall it not be ſayd vnto yow / where is the couer that ye layde ouer / I ſhall pul down the wall whiche ye haue couered with an vnprofitable cruſt / and i will daſhe it down to the grounde / and the fundacion of it ſhal be openly knowen and vncouered / and it ſhall fall / and ye ſhall be kylled in the myddes of it / and ye ſhall be taught to know that i am the lorde / And in the ende of the chapter he ſayethe thus / Becaus ye haue made ſad the ryghtuouſ mannis hart withe a lye / when as i dyd not make hym ſory / and ſtreyngthen the handes of the wikked that he return not from hys euel way / that he may be kept quik.

Euery ſtrange doctrine is to be ſhoned of Chriſten men and to be caſt out of the chirche / but euery doctrine is ſtrange whiche is not conteyned in the holy ſcripture / ergo all doctrines that ar not conteyned in the ſcripture ar to be ſhoned of Chriſten men / and to be caſt out of the chirche / But none of thes traditiones ar conteyned in the holy ſcripture / there fore they ar to be ſhoned of all Chriſten men and to be caſten out of the chirche / acordyng vnto the learnyng / of ſaynt Paule whiche ſayethe / hebrewes the xiii. let us not be caried about withe diuers and ſtrange doctrines. All thos preceptes ar to be banniſſhed out of the chirche / where to we ar forbidden to gyue hede / but vnto the preceptes of men whiche refuſe the truthe ar we forbidden to gyue hede / therfore / all preceptes of men whiche refuſe the truthe ar to be banniſſhede out of the chirche / But the pope and hys papiſtes ar falſ pro phetes and refuſe the truthe / ergo all theyr preceptes ceremonies & doctrines ar to be banniſſhed

If that we be forbidden in the ſcripture to kepe the commandemente bothe of our fathers by nature / and alſo by gouernance if they command any thyng concernyng religion that god hathe not commanded / moche more ar we forbidden to kepe the commandmentes of them that belong nothyng vnto us / if they commande it concernyng religion that god hathe not commanded / But we ar forbidden to kepe our fathers commandementes concernyng religion if they command vs any thyng that god hathe not commanded / Ezechiel the xx. chapter in thes wordes. In the commandementes of your fathers walk ye not and kepe ye not theyr iudgmentes / walk in my preceptes ande kepe my iudgementes / ergo myche more ar we forbidden to kepe the commandementes of them that belong nothyng to vs when they command vs to kepe that god hathe not commanded / But the pope hathe nothyng to do with vſ / ther for we ar forbidden to kep hys commandementes / when he commandethe vs that god hathe not commanded be

All the doctrines of thos men whiche for theyr falſe doctrine ar iuſtly exomunicated ar tobe dryuen away withe the men excomunicatede / But the pope for hys falſe doctrine is firſt iuſtly excommunicated of Paule / afterwarde of the germanes and laſte of our moſte noble Prince kyng Henry the eyght / ergo hys doctrine which is his / muſt be dryuen a way withe hym and not holdē ſtill as ye ſay / If ye ſay that Paule hathe not excommunicated hym heare what Paul ſayeth in the firſt chapter of the epiſtel to the Galathianes / if any man preache vn to yow any other thyng thē ye receyued / the ſame / be acurſed / but the pope preacheth other doctrine then the Galathianes learned of Poul / for they learned nothyng of Poul but that he had learned of god / be fore / for the pope teacheth hys owen doctrine and ceremonies which nether Paul nor he receydied of god / ther for the pope is acurſed and yit ſhall we hold ſtill hys learnyng? All the doctrines ar perilus for mannes ſoule and ar to be Caſten away / which when they ar taught / make the techers ther of to worſhip god in vayn / but all doctrines whiche ar the cōmandementes of men if they be taught make the teachers ther of to worſhip god in vayn / ergo all the doctrines whiche ar the cōmandementes of mē ar parillous for mannis ſoul and ar to be caſten away / but all the doctrines of the pope that i write agaynſt / and ye defend

And becauſ ye harp miche on that ſtrynge that thoghe a man be euel and a falſ Prophete that he may bryng furthe not with ſtādyng good fruytes and make holſome doctrines / we will examin that ſayng a litle farther yit withe the learnyng of Chriſte whiche ſayethe thes wordes cōcernyng the mater that is in ſtrife betwene you and me. Beware ſayeth Chriſte of falſe prophetes whiche cum vnto yow in ſhepis clothyng but with in ar rauenyng wolues / By theyr fruytes ſhall ye know them / So mē gather a grape of thornes / or of thiſtelles figges? Euery good tre makethe good fruite / but a rotten tre bringeth furthe euel fruit. A good tre cānot make euel fruites / nether can a rottē tre bryng furthe good fruites. whether is the pope a rottē tre or no

Thus far hathe Chriſte ſpoken / Now i deſyre yow that ar reders to be iudges in thys mater / whether Chriſte whiche ſayethe that an euel man and a falſ Prophet cannot bryng furthe good fruites and doctrines is more worthe to be beleued withe the naked truthe / or maſter gardiner which ſayeth that the pope whiche is a falſ Prophete and an euel man may bryng furthe good fruetes and make holſome doctrines and neceſſari ceremonies and profitable traditiones for the chirche of Chriſte / withe hys hyſtories and bys oft repeted good good / and withe hys natural reſones.

               Your meanyng is that the pope is to be ſo far reiected and banniſſhed away as he ſwarueth from the truthe and no farther / The biſſhop of rome is an heretike for ſtubbornly holdyng of doctrines contrari to the ſcripture / and he hys a traytour for makyng of hym ſelf hede of the chirche of Englonde / a boue the kyng.

Is there any holyer doctrine in the popis law and in

hys ceremonies and traditiones then is in the new Teſtameut of tyndalles tranſlation? ar there not as many hereſes in the popis bookes as in tyndalles?

And call ye not the lawes and ordinances made in the parlament howſe the actes of the parlament? Why may not i then call the popis lawes hys actes ād dedes / Sothe he nothyng that makethe a law? If he do ſumthyng it that he dothe / is a dede / then if he orden a law hys law ordened is hys dede / then will not thys ſhift ſerue yow / to trifle about a worde / and let the argument alone vnſoluted / If thys worde dede do offende yow ſo ſore i wil vſe a terme more pleaſant vnto yow / and make my argument thus / The popis ordinances and the pope ar all one then to whome ſoeuer ye gyue and attribute the popis ordinances hym as myche as lye the in yow ye make pope / but ye gyue and attribute vnto the kynge the popis ordinances ergo as myche as lye the in yow ye make the kyng pope / Now what aduantage haue ye goten

by refuſyng the worde dedes? As concernyng your examples fet out of the ciuile law they do not ſolute my argument / for my argument was thus / As if the kyng of Denmark ſhuld make a proclamation that all the ceremonies of Moſes law ſhuld be no more called Moſes ceremonies but hys ceremonies / yit for all that Moſes ceremonies ſhuld abyde and contynue ſtill Moſes ceremonies / for all hys proclamation / ſo the ceremonies that the pope hathe ones made / continue and abyde ſtill the popis ceremonies for all that they ar commanded by proclamation no more to be called the popis ceremonies but the kynges ceremonies / ye ſay that the Romanes ſend to the Grekes for theyr lawes and by approbation▪ made them theyrs / i pray yow remanded not the Grekes lawes ſtill theyrs / for all that the Romanes vſed the ſame lawes? Was not the Romanes and Grekes partners in lawes togyther when they vſed to gether the ſelf ſame lawes? then it folowethe for all your examples and by your examples that the popis ceremonies ar yit ſtill hys and ar occupeed in Englonde and that (by your ſayng) the kyngis hyghnes and the pope ar partners to gyther concernyng ceremonies / for the after partnerſhip diſpoſſeſſeth not the fierſt hole awner of hys former poſſeſſion / but he only gyuethe parte of hys ryght vnto hym that is made afterward partner with hym. Haue ye any other thyng to conclude with your examples? If ye haue / make your argument and i ſhal ſhape a ſolution

for it as wel as i can / I trow ye wil not be ſo mad as to argu thus on cite may receyne ciuile lawes of an other ergo the chirche may receyue lawes of the pope / Whiche is a falſe Prophete and a feruent Phariſe / when as Chriſte ſayethe in the goſpel be ware of falſe Prophetes / beware of the Leuin of the Phariſes / Where as ye ſay that i ſpeake ſo far out of reſon (where i ſay that i wold haue no other law in the chirche but the law of the goſpel alone) that ye will not reſon with me / ye play as your brother fox did whiche when he cam thorow a wynyarde and ſaw that the grapes we re hyer then he could reche to / ſayd he wolde eat no grapes / ſo when as my ſayng is ſtrongely defended withe goddis worde that ye can make no reſon agaynſt it / ye wilnot reſon / with me / ſcilicet / becauſye can not. Thys concluſion do ye hold that the law of the goſpel in not ſufficient for Chriſtes chirche to ordre and ruel it / except the popis traditiones be annexed ther to / and that he ſpeakethe far out of reſon that wold haue only the law of the goſpel in the chirche / Agaynſt thys deueliſh doctrine of yours i will make thes reſones / The law of the goſpel is miche more perfit / then the law of Moſes / But the law of Moſes was ſufficient by it ſelf for all them that was vnder it / and neded no mannis ordinance to be added vnto it / to order the iewes that were vnder the old Teſtament / then is the law of the goſpel miche more ſufficient by it ſelf for all them that ar vnder it / and miche leſſ nedethe any mannis ordinances

to be added vnto it to ordre them that ar vnder the new Teſtament / Paule calleth the law of Moſes a child leder vnto Chriſte / a ſhadow of good thynges for to cum / ād ſayeth that the lawe bringethe nothyng to perfection / If thys law neded nothyng to be added to it or mingled with it the law of the goſpel whiche Paul preferreth before the old law ij Corinth. in the third chapter hathe now no nede of the biſſhop of romis traditiones to be added to it or mingled with it / Is not the lau of the goſpel perfit? Is not that the moſte perfit law that the moſte perfit lawmaker makethe? made not Chriſte the perfiteſt law maker the law of the goſpel? To that law whiche is perfit in all poyntes nothyng nedethe to be added ūto it / Thē the law of the goſpel nedethe not the popis law to be added vnto it ād ſo is the law of the goſpel ſufficient for Chriſtes chirche and Chriſtes chirch nedeth no other law but it that Chriſte ordened hys ſelf for hys chirche. Further more when as the end of a perfit law of the chirche whiche alone is ſufficiend bi it ſelf to order the chirche / is to command all thyng that is neceſſari to ſaluation to forbid all thyng that is hynderāce to ſaluation / to teache / to reproue / to correct / to inſtruct / to make aman perfit / and redy to euery good work and to be ſaluation vnto all thē that beleve / and the law of the goſpell cādo all thes thynges / what ſhall we nede to haue any other law in the chirche ſeinge that thys law conteneth all thyng in it that is neceſſari for the chirche of Chriſte / and hathe all the poyntes / 

that be long vnto a perfit law whiche ne dethe no other law to be added vnto it? Almyghty god told hys ſon Chriſte all lawes that was neceſſari for Chriſtis chirche / and Chriſte taught hys Apoſtelles all that he heard of hys father / ād all that the Appoſtelles learned of Chriſte neceſſari for Chriſtis chirche / they and the Euāgeliſtes haue writen it in the new teſtamēt whiche is the law of the goſpel / But the Euāgeliſtes ād Apoſtelles haue made no mētion of the popis ceremonies lawes and traditiones / therfore they ar not neceſſari for Chriſtis chirche / but the law of the goſpel is neceſſari alone / Paul ſpeaketh of thys law of the chirche thes wordes / I am not aſhamed of the goſpel for it is the pour of god to ſaluation to all that beleue. Do i yit ſtill ſpeak far out of reſon whē i wold that ōly the law of the goſpell ſhuld be in the chirche? Chriſtis religiō cam in to the world bithe worde of god ād not by mānis traditiones ād Chriſtis religione hathe frō the beginning bē vp holdē withe the worde of god and not with mannis traditiones / and the Chriſtē religiō is not groūded vpō mannis ordinances / thē the religiō of Chriſte ſhuld continue and proſper well enoghe as it hathe don frō the beginnyng to thys day if all the popis ceremonies and traditiones were in the depeſt pit of hell from whēce they cam / The ceremonies and traditiones of men haue euer bene hinderance to the true religion / whiche thynges cauſed Chriſte to ſay to your brother phariſees manteners of mannis doctrine as ye be / Whi break ye the commandement of god for your tradition? They worſhip me in vayn

then the outwarde Curteſi / and if he alow the greater he aloweth the leſſ / And god commanded men to loue theyr wyues / then when as kiſſyng is the ſigne or token of loue / where the thyng is alowed / the token of the ſame is not forbidden / Therfore it is no idolatri for the ſeruant to make curteſie to hys maſter / nether is it idolatri for the man to kiſ hys wife / for nether of thos ij factes or forbidden / but ſeing that we ow no loue nor obediance vnto images / and the outward worſhip is in expreſſed wordes forbidden to be gyuen vnto images in the ſecond commandment / in thes wordes thow ſhal not humble or bow they ſelfe vnto them / nor ſerue them / it is open idolatri / to make curteſi to images and to kiſſ them / Where for it foloweth not / we may gyue outward reuerence and worſhip vnto maſters and to kynges ergo we may gyue outward worſhip vnto images / for if thys be your argument / ye meane that a blynde and lyfeles pece of ſyluer or gold made after the lyknes of a mortal man / by a mortal man / is as good honorable and as worthy to be honored as a maſter & a kynge whiche is the hyeſt and moſte honorable

Thynk ye that Iohan that holy mā to whome god had ſhewed ſo miche of hys ſecretes / was ſo mad as to go about to gyue vnto an angel the godly inwarde worſhip dew vnto god alone?

whiche can iudge beſt of the natures of wordes / hold contrary vnto yow / that adoro is only taken for outwarde worſhip and outwarde geſture / for thus writeth the abbreuiato▪ of Valla.
               Adorare eſt geſtu corporis honorem / etiam ſine ore et uoce impendere. And Valla hys ſelf ſayeth thus Adorare ſine ore hoc eſt ſine uoce fit / non ſine plicatione genuum et geſtu corporis / Elephas et Phenix et alia quedam irrationabilia ſolem adorare dicuntur. Saynt Ierom vpon the third chapter of Daniel writeth thes wordes / Et notanda proprietas Deos coli / imaginem adorari dicunt / Quod utrunque ſeruis Dei non conuenit / The ſcripture after the tranſlation of Ierom moſt comonly vſeth adoro to gyue outward worſhip and colo to gyue godly inward worſhip / as aman may ſe both in many other places / and eſpecially in the xx. of Exodus and in the v. chapter of the Deuteronomy / then is not thys word Adoro ſo general bothe to godly inwarde worſhip and to outward worſhip aſ ye vnlearnedly without autorite haue pronunced. But put the caſe that odoro betokeneth bothe the kyndes of worſhippyng / he that putteth a negation before adoro in ſuche a mode as men forbid / forbiddethe nothe bothe the kyndes of worſhippyng? He that ſayeth thow ſhalt not worſhip an image when worſhip is bothe taken for reuerent behauour / and for godly inwarde worſhip / forbiddethe he not to worſhip an image with reuerent behauour? But god putteth a negation before Adoro / wherfor euen

by your ſayng it is forbidden to giue any reuerent behauour vnto an image / If that i dyd reſon then from a general term to a particular my argument negatiuely after good Logik ſhuld be as good as ye made any thes ſeuen yeares / for wher the generalis denied or forbidden all the ſpecialles conteyned vnder the generall ar alſo denied and forbidden / then if adoro as ye ſay be generall bothe to kiſ and to ſhew a reuerent behauour / and to gyue godly inwarde worſhip / when images ar forbidden adorari / to be worſhipped / then is both the outward worſchip which ſtandeth in knelyng kiſſyng and in ſuche other outwarde geſture / and the inward worſhip of the hart / is alſo forbidden to be gyuen vnto imagines / How beit i made no ſuche argument before thys tyme for i reſoned thus a ſufficienti diuiſione / There ar no mo kyndes of worſhippyng but ij. inwarde and outward / but nether of them is to be gyuen vnto images ergo no worſhip is to be gyuen vnto images the probation of thys argument i fet out of the xx. chapter of Exodus where allmyghty god ſayethe touchyng images / non adorabis ea ne

               The hunter
               Ye play with allmyghty god whiche forbiddeth yow to bow and knele to images / as a certayn crafty boy did play with hys Scolmaſter in a grammer ſcoole / whiche cō
                  manded thys boy & all other that learned grammer to ſpeak Latin one to an other at all tymes / and no Engliſhe / Thys boy as oft as he was diſpoſed to clatter Engliſhe / he took vnto hym ād a. b. c. boy and ſayde vnto hym / Robin i will ſpeak to the / and with thys Preface he ſpak Engliſh all the longday by thys boy to hys felowes / and ſo mokked the ſpie / an brak hys maſters commandement / But the maſter cam ones in at the laſt and ſpied hys craft / and took hym and poniſſhed hym for a ſpeaker of Engliſhe to hys felowes for all that he ſayd that he ſpak vnto the a b. c. boy. So ye perceyuyng that ſum wold chek yow if that ye held alwayes that a man myght worſhip the croſſ it ſelf / moſt comonly ye ſay that a man may vſe reuerent behouour before the croſſ but not to the croſſ / and that ye worſhip not the croſſ it ſelf / but Chriſte / whiche is ſignified by the croſſ / when as ye worſhip the croſ it ſelf and not Chriſte / and ſum tyme hold in playn wordes that a man may

worſhip the croſ it ſelf / with reuerent behauour / ſo that the hart be away / as i ſhal here after god willyng / ſufficiently proue it. Ye ſay that ye may not worſhip the croſ in the chirch with godly honor for that is agaynſt goddis commandment / If that ye will make any anſwer to apore man / tell me what is thys godly honor that is forbidden / to be gyuen vnto images / and where and in what wordes it is forbidden? Ye meane by godly honor / as far as i can gather by your book / the inward worſhippyng of god alon / whiche ſtandeth in truſt of ſaluation and in loue aboue all creatures / for ye ſay here after in your booke that true worſhip is only in ſprete / & that kyſſyng and knelyng is not godly honor. wher of it foloweth that your iugement is that a man may worſhip an image withe outward woſhip that is with kyſſyng of it withe knelyng and crepyng to it / Where as ye hold that outward reuerent behauour as knelyng ād kiſſyng is no parte of goddis worſhip ye ſpeake agaynſt Chriſte whiche ſayethe Matthe iiij. chapter / thow ſhalt humble thy ſelf or bow thy ſelf down vnto thy lorde god / ād only ſerue hym / whereas humlyng or fallyng down is outward worſhip / and / ſeruing is to put confidence of ſaluation / and the inner worſhip of god / here ye may ſe that god requirethe alſo that the outward worſhip / and will not ſuffer it to be gyuen to other thē to hym ſelf and to ſuche as he will be knowen to ruel in. Whē the deuel ſayde vnto Chriſte / Luc the iiij. i will gyue the al thes if thow wil fal doun &

worſhip before me / what if that he had ſtande by / and ſayd to the deuel gyue me al that / thow promiſed Chriſte / and i wil do that thow requireſt of hym / if he promiſede & ye fell doune and worſhipped be fore the deuel / whether had ye gyuen any worſhip dew vnto god / to the deuel or no? If that ye ſay that ye had gyuen no worſhip dew to god / vnto the deuel / then is it noſin in your bookes to knele before the deuel and to kiſ hym ſo that your hart be away / & that a mā may worſhip the deuel with hys body ſo that he worſhip hym not with hys mynde / If that ye ſay that in fallyng down and worſhippyng before the deuel ye gaue to the deuel worſhip that was dew vnto god / thē is worſhippyng befor the deuel worſhippyng of the deuel / and fallyng down & ſuch other outward worſhip is dew vnto god & on kynde of goddis worſhip / thē is not alonly the godly honor whiche is in the hart / but alſo the outwarde geſture as bowyng & knelyng worſhip dew vnto god which nether cā be dō to the deuel nor to any image with out dedly ſin / ād yit ye ſay that we maynot worſhip the croſ with godly honor / but that we may vſe reuerēt behauour before it / that is to kiſ it / to how to it ād to crepe to it / whiche is no other thing thē to giue at the leaſt ūto it outward worſhip whiche is cōtrari to the ſecōd cōmandement of god / If that ye wold flie to thys ſhift & ſay i worſhip & vſe renerēt behauoure before the croſ but i worſhip not it i wil proue yow by the ſcripture that to worſhip before god is to worſhip god to worſhip before a man is to

worſhip a man and and to worſhip before an image is to worſhip the image / before which it is down / Geneſis iiij. Pharao made Ioſephe cum vp to hys charet / an the crier to crie that all men ſhuld bow theyr knees before Ioſeph / and know that he was made rueler ouer all Egypt. Mark here that to bow knees is to worſhip / and to worſhip before Ioſeph is to worſhip Ioſeph / and that the cauſe why that Pharao wold haue Ioſeph worſhipped / was that he wold let all hys peple know that hys pour and autorite was in Ioſeph / Leuitici the x. chapter. Nadab and abiu offered before the lorde / In the firſt of the kynges / xxv. chapter Abigael lyghted of hyr aſ and fell on hyr face before Dauid / and worſhipped on the ground and fel down to hys fete / ij of the kynges in the xiiij. chapter.

I will leue me 7000. whos knees haue not bene bowed before baal / By thes places it is playn that to worſhip before god / man or image / is to worſhip god man or the image that the worſhip is don before / But ye knele bow and crepe before

the croſ it ſelf ergo ye worſhip the croſ it ſelf / to kiſ with religions behauour is to gyue outward worſhip but ye with religious behauour kiſ the croſ it ſelf ergo ye worſhip the croſſ it ſelf / But what nede i any other witnes to proue that ye worſhip the croſ then your oun wordes whiche ye ſyng on good firday whiche ar thes crucem tuam Domine adoramus, lorde we worſhip thy croſſ / Neuer the leſ ye wold haue as long as ye could make the kyngis highnes and all hys ſubyectes beleue that ye wold worſhip before the Croſ only and not the croſ it ſelfe / But when as ye ar bet with argumentes ye leaue of your diſſemblyng and fall erneſtly to defend that the croſ may be worſhipped with reuerent behauour that is with kiſſyng it knelyng and crepyng to it / for ye ſay that in knelyng and kiſſyng alone vnderſtādyng of the croſ / is no idolatri / And that no vnlearned man in Englond ſhuld alledge any ſcripture agaynſt yow / or ſhuld percyue that the worſhippyng of the croſ with crepyng and bowyng to it / is contrari to the ſcripture ye haue theuiſhly / roberouſly / wikkedly & deutlyſhly ſtollē that pece of the ſecunde commandment away whiche forbiddethe to bow or gyue any outword worſhip vnto images. For thus write yow in your new Catechiſme whiche ye call lyke a maſker as ye be the kyngis booke / Thow ſhalt not haue any grauen image nor any lyknes of any thyng that is in heauen aboue / or in earthe benethe / or in the water vnder the earthe to the intent to do any godly honour and worſhip

vnto them / Thys is your tranſlation / and in thys book where in ye examin me / ye take away from godly honor bowyngdown / fallyng down / knelyng an keſſyng / and ſuche other outward geſtures / and ſay that thes ar not forbidden to be gyuen vnto images / but only the inward godly honour / is forbidden / And that ye myght the more eaſely bryng the lay peple vnto your opinion ye ſteal away as i haue ſayde a pece of the ſecond commandment / for where as ye ſay only / thow ſhalt gyue no godly honor and worſhip vnto images / meanyng therby the inwarde truſt and godly loue and obediēce / and that outwarde bowyng knelyng and kiſſyng ar not forbidden to begyuen vnto images / The truthe of the hebrue is openly agaynſt yow / for thus hathe the Hebrew text both in the Deuteronomi and in Exodo Lo chiſſtachaue Lahem velo thaauedē the lxx. interpretoures made thys text thus in Greke

Now let us cum vnto the ſayng of ſaynt Ierom whiche ye bryng agaydſt / me / It wold haue becumed a learned Biſhop to haue brought in a mater of religion the holy ſcripture / ād not a patche of a mannis doctrine / ye ſay that ſaynte Ierom ſayethe that he wold cleuero and not let go the poſt of the croſ til that

he purdreſſed forgiuenes / Where ſayethe Ierome thys? It is lyke that ye neuer red thys in ſaynt Ierom / but ether in the canon law or ellis in ſum of your brother papiſtys workes / for ij cauſes i reken that thes wordes ar ether non of ſaynt Ieromes or ellis that ye haue mangled them / firſt becauſe ye mangle the ſcripture ye wil not be aferde to mangle a Doctor / and becauſ ye ſhew no place where as Ierom writeth thes wordes / the ſecond is becaws i know that Ierom in an other place is of a cleane contrari iudgment / And becauſe ye leaue the wepens of the worde of god / and feght agaynſt me withe the wepens of Doctors / i will anſwer with the ſayng of a doctor. Saynt Ierom wrytyng vpon the third chapter of Daniel ſayethe thes wordes folowyng concernyng the worſhip of images / Siue statuam ut Simmachus ſiue imaginem auream, ut caeteri transtulerunt, uoluerimus legere, cultores Dei eam adorare non debent, Ergo iudices & principes ſeculi, qui imperatorum ſtatuas adorant & imagines, hoc ſe facere intelligant, quod tres pueri facere nolentes placuerunt Deo. Et notanda proprietas deos coli, imaginem adorari dicunt, quod utrun
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      ſeruis Dei non conuenit. Whether we wil rede a ſtandyng image / as ſymmachus / or a golden image as the other haue tranſlated / the true worſhippers of god ought not to / hūble theyr ſelues vnto it / Therfore let the iudges and Princes of the world / vnderſtand whiche gyue outward worſhip to the ſtandyng images and likneſſes of Emperoures / that they do the ſame that the iij. childer wold not do / and therin pleaſed god / And the properti is to be

marked / they ſay that god is worſhipped with inwarde worſhip and images with outward geſture. Thus far ſpeaketh Ierom / whos wordes whether they make for the outwarde bowyng knelyng and crepyng to images ar no / let them iudge whiche ether haue learnyng in the ſcripture or any good natural wit.

               Thus they delude the ſimplicite of the peple with the ambiguite of the wordes / and as uery enemies of the croſ of Chriſte they labor to extinct all wayes & meanes whiche myght ſet out the glori of the croſ / miche agreable to the turkes procedynges who forbiddeth open ſhewes or preching of Chriſtis Religion / thes men ſpeak mich of prechyng / but note well thys / they wold we ſhuld ſe nothyng in remembrance of Chriſt and therfore can they not abyde images / They wold we ſhuld ſmel nothyng in memori of Chriſte / and therfor ſpeak they agaynſt anoyntyng & hallywather. They wold we ſhuld taſte nothyng in memory of Chriſte / and therfore they cannot away with ſalt and holy brede / A ſupper they

ſpeak of wich they wold handle lyke a dryngkyng. Finally they wold haue all in talkyng they ſpeak ſo myche of prechynge / ſo as all the gates of our ſences and wayes to mannis vnder ſtandynge ſhuld be ſhit vp ſauyng the eare alone / as by talkyng the deuel were ſo far onward of hys purpos to extinct Chriſte / which with the ſubuerſion of the orders of the world / ſemeth to be the mark where at thys ſect ſhoteth.
            
            
               The hunter
               I delude not the ſimplicite of the peple with ambiguite of wordes / as ye falſly belye me / for i alledge the ſecond commandement of god agaynſt the crepyng to the croſ and the kyſſyng of it / where as bothe the outward worſhip and the inward is forbidden / Be that ſayeth eat of no dog nether of the land nor the water / vſe the no ambiguite of wordes / which ſhuld haue vſed ambiguite / as it appereth if he had ſayd alone / eat no dog. Therfore whether worſhip be taken generally or by excellencie for godly worſhip i wſe no ambiguite for i declare openly that bothe the kyndes of worſhip is forbidden to be gyuen vnto images / both it that ſtandeth in inwarde faythe and loue / and it that conſiſteth in outward geſture as knelyng and kyſſyng and ſuch lyke / Now be cauſe ye cannot reſon agaynſt

me nether with ſcripture nor naturall reſon / ye begyn ta rail agaynſt me and ſay that i am therfore an enemi of Chriſtis croſ becauſ i wil not ſuffer the croſ nether to be worſhipped with outward worſhip nor inward. If that i be therfore an enemy to Chriſte / then is almighty god an enemy to Chriſtis croſſ for he doth the ſame that i do / and it that i do i learned it of god / Se now as ye fall in to the vice that ye accuſe me of / ſum tyme vſyng the croſ for a pece of ſyluer and other whiles for the Paſſion of Chriſte / wher vnto if he be not an enemy / that maketh hallowed ſalt equal in pour / gyuyng vnto it Saluation of both body and ſoule / let learned men iudge / Is there any better meane in the hole world to ſet out the glori of the croſſ then the worde of god? And thys meane do we ſo exerciſe and defende that ye moke vs and cal vs talkers / Then / lyke vnto a ſon of the ſhameles hore of Babylo ye lye where ye ſay that i wold extinct all the meanes that ſhuld ſet out the glori of the croſſ / Where as ye compare me vnto the Turc whiche forbiddethe open ſhewes and preachyng of Chriſte / i meruel withe what face ye call me Turkiſh in that behaff when as ye your ſelf forbad the players of london (as it was toldme) to play any mo playes of Chriſte / but of robin hode and litle Iohan / and of the Parlament of byrdes and ſuche other trifles. Now ſyr biſſhop which of vs ij is more lyke the Turk? The Turkes law is partely drawen out of Moſes law / partly out of Chriſtis goſpel / partly out of mahumettis

fantaſes and your law that ye biſſhoppes of Englond now vſe in the chirche is partely taken out of Moſes law / partely out the goſpel and partly out of the popes decrees and traditiones / for with Moſes ye vſe outward ſacrifices to take ſin away / hallow temples and veſtimentes and purifi wymen / withe Chriſte ye baptiſe and rede the goſpel / with the pope ye crepe to the croſ forbid preſtes to mari and occupi infinite ſwarmes of ceremonies / And we receyue no manis doctrin but the word of god alone. Therfore your doynges ar more lyte the Turkes procedynges then ouris ar where as ye accuſe vſe with the Turke for forbiddyng of preachyng / ye declare your ſpret to be inconſtant and contrari to it ſelf and therfore to be of the deuel for ye accuſe vſ a litle here after for preachyng to miche. Ye blame vſe faſly wher ye ſay that we wold haue yow ſe nothyng in the remembrance of Chriſte / for we wold that all the peple that can rede ſhuld loke and ſe in the iiij. Euangeliſtes Chriſtis dedis and ſermones and therby call Chriſt to theyr remembrāces / we wold that the hole chirche of Chriſte / no man nor woman except ſhuld bothe ſe and receyue the ſacrament of Chriſte moſt preciouſ bloude / And ye lot vp the word of god for al the hole year from the comon peple and command all images to be couered as long as lent laſteth / and ſuffere no lay man to receyue with the preſtes the ſacrament of Chriſtis bloud in the remembrane of the bloud of Chriſte which was ſhed for vſ / therfore ye ar the

blotters out of Chriſtes memori and not we. We wold haue Chriſtes meane / that he ordened to hold hys remembrance with in the chirche hole / that is the hole Sacramentes and the hole worde of god / to dwel richely in Chriſtis hole chirche / & ye mangle and geld the Sacramentes / and lyke made men / as it doth apere vndeſtandyng Paulis word richely / among rich men / wil ſuffer non but gentle men and riche men rede the ſcripture which myght an hunderd thowſand tymes better and with leſ ieperdy put vs in remembrance of Chriſt then your forbidden and horiſh images do / And ſo ye do acordyng to the prouerbe ſtele agouſ and for hyr ſtik down a fether / when ye take Chriſtis worde away & one dele of hys Sacramē
                  tes and in ſtede ther of / ſet vp blynd blokes and dum ceremonies. Will we not let yow ſmel nothyng in memori of Chriſte / becauſ we ſpeake agaynſt anoyntyng of dede carcaſes / and witched water? Who ordened that ſuch ſtynkyng oyle as youres is ſhuld be a remembrance of Chriſte by ſmellyng of it? & that ſalted water whiche hath no ſmell at all / the firſt day / and with in ſix dayes that it is ſalted yit ſtynketh ſhal by the ſmellyng of it put vs in remembrance of Chriſte? Will we not let yow taſte nothyng in memory of Chriſte becauſ we ſpeak agaynſt the coniuryng of ſalt / What ſhuld we do with your ſalt when as it is al vn ſauery and / hath no taſte of the worde of god? Chriſte ſayeth that ſalt when it is vnſauery is good for nothyng but to be caſt out of dores to be

treden with mennis fete. We vſe to gyue the Sacrament to all that wil receyue it / euery moneth and in ſum places euery ſonday in the remembrance of our ſauiour Chriſte and ye gyue a bit of comon brede in the remembrance of the Sacrament / who holdeth Chriſtis memori better? What ie wiſhe and dull Phariſees ar thes that ether wil not / or can not be cantent withe the holy worde of Chriſte and hys Sacramentes to bryng Chriſte to theyr memories that they may thynk on hym except they ſmel ſum thyng to remembr▪ hym and taſte ſum thyng alſo to remembre hym thereby / I neuer red of more fleſhy Phariſees in my lyfe then thes be. Thes be the moſte forgitful felowes that i haue heard of. To that where ye ſay that we ſpeake of a ſupper and wold handle it lyke a drynkyng / i anſwer that we do not only drynke but alſo eat at Chriſtis ſupper / and ſo handle it / as Chriſt taught vs in hys worde / with out any players garmentes or popiſh knakkes and foliſhe iuglyng toyes whiche after the ordinance of the pope ye put to it / ye handle it not lyk Chriſtis ſupper but lyke a doggis dinner / and both do it and ſay it a miſ / In ſayng that we wold haue all thyng in talkyng and wold ſhit vp all your ſences ſauyng hearyng / ye do nothyng ellis but mok Chriſte / whiche ordened no other meanes to in gendre fayth in vs and to call vs to remembrance of hym / ſauyng only hys word and hys Sacramentes / Becauſ ye thynk that Chyriſtis worde and Sacrament

ar not ſufficient for the purpoſes aboue reherſed / and reken your ſelues wyſer then Chriſte / ye haue for a great parte put a way Chriſtes ordinances and ſet other as ye thynk better in theyrſtede / to put vs in remembrance of Chriſte / and to ſtir vs vp vnto godlynes / It is lyke that yf ye had ben lyuyng in Chriſtis tyme with your felow Phariſes and had heard Chriſte ſayng vnto hys Diſciples go in to all the world and preache the goſpel to euery creature / ye wold haue layde what meaneth thys man ſo erneſtly to gyue commandment of preachyng and teachyng / belyke thys man wil haue all thynges don with talkyng / and not with ſuch laudable and ſemely ceremonies as Moſes and our for fathers haue deuiſed / Where ye ſay the Mark that we ſhote at / is to extinct Chriſte and the orders of the world / i anſwer▪ that we go not about to extinct Chriſte but to ſet hym vp whome ye with your wordly orders haue long holden down as mich as lay in yow. Chriſte is not bilded vpon your polytike orders of the world as ye ſuppoſe / nether at the fallyng of them ſhuld he fall which is bylded vpon a ſtronger fundacion / for we haue put down viij. of your orders of the world / iiij. orders of freres / ij. of monkes & ij of chanones / & yit is not ther with Chriſte extinct but rather brought more to lyght / There remayne yit ij orders of the world in Englōd vn put down / that is the order of pōpoſe & Popiſhe Biſſhoppes / & Greue freres / whiche if they were put doū as well as the other ar put doun before / i rekē

and kyſſyng of images is worſhippyng of images / therfore ye hold that it is no idolatri to worſhip images with outward reuerence / ſo that the hart be ſeparat from the worſhippyng. A litle before lyke a craſty for ye ſayd thes wordes i may vſe reuerent behauour before the image of the croſſ / as thoghe ye wold not that certayn wyſe men ſhuld know that yow held that the croſ it ſelf ſhuld be worſhipped / & now ye ſay that when kiſſyng and kneling is ſeperate from the opinion / ſcilicet of the croſſ / then is it no idolatri / that is to wit to kiſſ the croſſ it ſelf and to bow to it / your mynde is knowen for all your diſſemblyng and your crafty maſkyng / All thoghe i haue fufficiently before confuted thys your opinion that aman may worſhip images with outwarde worſhip whiche ye call reuerent behauour / withe the autorite of the ſecond cōmandment of god which forbiddeth both the worſhip of the hart and of the body to begyuen vnto images yit i will bryng an example out the holy ſcripture to ſtreyngthen and make more clere my former confutation. Nebuchadnezar as it is writen in the third chapter of Daniel / made agolden image lx. cubites hie / and ſix cubites brode / and commanded all men that were with in hys dominion in payne of dothe to worſhip thys image with outwarde worſhip infallyng down before it / and makyng ſuch geſtures as worſhippers of images vſe to make / But Sadrach / Meſach / and Abednego wold not worſhip it / the kyng ſayde vnto them.

Is it trew that ye do no godly ſeruice vnto my god / nether wil worſhip the golden image whiche i haue ſet up? If that ye wil yit fal down & worſhip the image which i haue made (ye ſhal haue pardon) but if ye wil not worſhip it / the ſame houre ſhall ye be caſten in to aburnyng fornace of fyre / to whome they anſwered / o kyng we wold that thow ſhuld know / that we do no godly honor to thy goddes / nether / will we worſhip with outward worſhip the image that thow haſte ſet vp. And then the kyng cauſed them all iij. to be caſten in to the burnyng furnace / but god delyuered thē wonderouſly out of the fyre ſafe and ſound / Now do i ax yow whether thes iij. men myght haue gyuen reuerent hebauour as bowyng kiſſyng & knelyng to thys image / with out dedly ſin / & myght haue directed they: hartes vnto god / that the kyng knew not of / and ſo haue eſcaped the burnyng fornace / or no? If ye anſwer that they myght haue gyuen reuerent behauour vnto the kyngis image with out dedly ſin ād myght haue directed the inward worſhip of theyr hartes vnto the lyuyng god / that the kyng knew not of / and ſo with out ieperdy myght haue eſcaped the fornace / then was thes iij. euel men / and dyd break goddis commandment / which ſayeth thow ſhalt not tempt thy lorde god / that is thow ſhal not put thy ſelf in ieperdy where no nede requirethe / and thow ſhal require no miraculouſ help of god where as theyr ar naturall meanes enow. But if ye anſwer that all thoghe they had directed theyr hartes vnto

god that neuer the leſſ they could not with out dedly ſin haue kiſſed that image and kneled bowed and gyuen out ward worſhip vnto it / and that they were alowed of god becauſe they wold in no wyſe worſhip that golden image / then ye do noughtely and diſpleaſe god in doing it to an image that good men and alowed of god had leuer be burned in a fornace of fyre then to do to an image / They wold not worſhip a mannis image with outwarde reuerence / and ye both do outward reuerence vnto images and in payn of death compell other men as Nebuchadnezar did / to worſhip a mannis image. If the iij. iewe

to make an image of hym) ād to be worſhipped with outward reuerence as amannis images which is in earth is forbidden to be made & worſhipped. Haue ye not now ſeduced the hole realme teachyng all men there in that they may worſhip the croſ with outward reuerent behauour as with knelyng and kiſſyng when as it is proued open idolatri? Where ye ſay as trew worſhip is only in ſprete / and procedeth from the hart ſo doth idolatri procede from the hart alſo / it foloweth that all your ſenſyng / knelyng crowchyng / croſſyng / ſyngyng of meſſes dirges mattens and euenſonges which ar don in and by the body ar no tru goddis ſeruice but falſ ſeruice.

pleaſ yow to thys queſtion / Denied peter Chriſte with hys hart / or with hys mouth alon? If he denied hym with hys mouth alone and yit that denying was dedly ſin / then if a man ſhuld worſhip an image with hys body alone and not with hys hart he ſhuld committ dedly ſin for as Chriſte will haue both the confeſſion of the hart & alſo of the mouth / ſo dothe he forbid both to worſhip an image with your hart and alſo with your body. Where ye ſay that in only kiſſyng and knelyng cannot be idolatri i grant it is true as long as they ar applyed to nothyng / but when kiſſyng & knelyng ar applied to images wherto god forbad thē to be applied / in only kiſſyng of images & knelyng to thē / may idololatri be cōmitted.

               The hunter
               They that in Englond had leuer eat accornes then good wheat brede & wil not change theyr olde mumpſimus with the new ſumpſimus thynk that ye ar the greateſt clerk in Englond / but euery man that is not blynde may ſe that ye ar ſhamfully vnlearned in diuinite / and not able to anſwer any thyng apparently wel to an argument / and therfore trifle lyke a wanton boy and / anſwere neuer a worde to my argument / And becaus all men may ſe your hye learnyng i wil reherce my argument / that they may compare it with your anſwer. If it be not lawful to make an image and to haue an image it is not lawful to worſhip an image had and made. But the ſcripture forbiddeth to make and haue images / then myche more it forbiddeth to worſhip them / 

Thys was my argument / and thus did i proue by ſufficient autorite of the holy ſcripture that it was not lawful to make and to haue images. It is writen xx. chapter of Exodus / Thow ſhalt make the no grauen image nether any lyknes of any thyng that is in heuen a boue nether in earthe benethe nether of them that ar in the waters vnder the earthe / thow ſhalt nether bow thy ſelf vnto them nor do any ſeruice or godly honor vnto them. The ſame wordes ar writen in the fift chapter of the Deuteronomi And Leuitici the xxvj. it is writen make yow no idoles nether any grauen image / nether ſet vp any ſtandyng image for yow / nether ſhal ye ſet any figured ſtone in your land that ye may worſhip it / Allmyghty god ſayeth alſo Deuteronomij the iiij. chapter thes wordes by hys ſeruante Moſes. Ye cam and ſtood vnder the hil / but the hil burned in afyre to the middes of heauen / where was darknes cloudes and miſt / and the lorde ſpak vnto yow out from the middes of the fyre / and ye heard in dede the voyce of the wordes but ſaw no image ſauyng the voyce alone / Therfore euen as ye loue your own ſoul ſo diligently take ye hede (for ye haue ſene no image at all on that day that god ſpak with yow in the hill / out of the middes of the fyre) leſt by chance ye ſhuld do amiſ in makyng yow a grauen image what ſoeuer lyknes it beareth of aman or a womā / or the lyknes of any beſte that is on the earth / or the lyknes of any fethered fowel in the ayer or the form of any thyng that crepeth vpon the erthe

or the lyknes of any fiſh that is in the waters vnder the earthe / And leſte thow ſhuld lift vp thy eyes in to heuen and ſe the ſon and the moune & the ſterres with the hole company of heuen and fall down / and ſhew reuerent behauour or do any godly ſeruice vnto them / which the lord thy god hath gyuen vnto all peple that ar vnder the hole heuen. And in the xxvii. Acurſed be the man who ſo euer he be that maketh ether a grauen or a caſten image / the abomination of the lorde / the werk of the artificer / & ſetteth it in a pryuy place. The wyſe man in the xiij. chapter of hys book curſeth alſo bothe the image and the image maker. Thus dyd i reſon with yow with thes places of holy ſcripture / Whiche places if ye wold haue anſuered to i ſhuld haue obteyned it that i deſyred that is / that thes places at the leſte proued ſubſtancially that it is not lawful to make any image and to gyue any worſhip at al to it / nether knelyng nor bowyng nether any inwarde worſhip of the hart / for euen ſo erneſtly as the images ar forbidden to be made ſo er neſtly ar they forbidden to be worſhipped with outwarde geſture and with inward honor / If that ye had anſwered that images had ben forbidden to be made ether to be worſhipped with outward worſhip or with inwarde / i wold haue cōcluded that when the image of the croſ is an image that ye do wrong to make it / and to gyue any worſhip at all vnto it / ether inwarde or outwarde / But ye knowyng aforehād of thys concluſion / & wantyng wepens to auoyd

it / anſwer nothyng to my argument / but ſay that if i could proue my antecedent that we myght haue no images that then it folowed that we myght not worſhip the croſſ / as ye wold haue ſayd / ſo long ſhall it be lawful to worſhip the croſſ as ye cannot proue that ye ſhuld haue no image / but that ſhal be euer vnproued / therfore for euer ſhal it be lawful to worſhip the croſſ. Then ſeing that i perceyue that ye will not leue the worſhyppyng of images ſo long as ye haue them / to dryue away the worſhyppyng of images i am cōpelled to labor to proue that we that ar Chriſtē mē ſhuld haue no images at all in the place of worſhyppyng / & prayer / namely theyr where as images haue ben worſhipped may be worſhipped / & in ſuch places where as the worſhippyng of images with outward geſture is erneſtly defended / ye ſay that if i could proue my antecedent that my conſequēt were inſoluble / Is ther any more ſufficient probation thē the holy worde of god is? I haue brought vj. places out of the worde of god wher in all mē ar forbiddē to make images / then haue i ſufficiētly proued that it is not lawful to make images. If ye require the ſum of altogether in an argumēt thus do i make my argumēt / What ſoeuer allmyghty god forbiddeth is vnlawful / but almyghty god forbiddeth to make images / therfore it is vnlauful to make images / cā ye haue any playner forbiddyng thē thys is / non facies tibi ſculptile, how ſhalt make the no grauē image? Is not my antecedēt yit proued? Now let vs ſe what places of ſcripture ye can bryng to

proue that Chriſten men may haue images. In your inſtitution wrytyng vpon the ſeconde commandment ye ſay thes wordes / Thow ſhalt not haue any grauen image to the intent to do any godly honor vnto it. By thes wordes we ar not forbidden to make or to haue ſimilitudes or images / but only we be forbidden to make or to haue them to the intent to do godly honor vnto them / as it appareth in the xxvj. chapiter of Leuiticus. Thes ar your wordes All that ar learned men may ſe how ſhamfully ye play the thief here and how vnlearnedly ye handle the ſcriptures for thes wordes of the xxvj. chapter of Leuiticus / non facietis ut adoretis, ar no other wiſe to be expounded then thes wordes of the iiij. chapter of the Deuteronomi / non uidist is imaginem ne forte decepti faciatis, ne adoretis & colatis. Therfore wher allmyghty god ſayeth thow ſhalt make the no image that thow may worſhip it / is as miche to ſay as thow ſhalt make the no image leſte at any tyme / thow may chance to worſhip it / Expoſition of ſcripture bi it ſelf hathe hither to allwayes bene alowed of wyſe and learned men / and is and will be alowed / then if ye be learned and wiſe ye will alow thys my expoſition / But i pray yow where learned ye thys new Logik of a negatiue antecedent to bryng in an affirmatiue conſequent? for thus ye gather i may not make an image to worſhip it ergo i may make an image / ſcilicet to be a laymannis boke / There is a father which hath a childe which hathe wounded hym ſelf oft tymes with a ſharp

poynted knyfe / he forbiddeth hys ſone to weare any more a ſharp poynted knyfe / leſte he ſhuld hurt hym ſelf ther with / the child with the next money that he gitteth byeth hym ſelf a ſharp poynted knyfe / & weareth it / the father blameth the childe for breakyng of hys commandment the child alledgyng that he weareth hys knyfe to defend hym ſelf from dogges / ſayeth that he breaketh not hys fathers commandment / and that he weareth the knyfe not to hurt hym ſelf with all / but to defend hym from dogges ther with. Whether breaketh thys child hys fathers cōmandment or no? Whether ſhuld thys argumente of the childe folow wel or no? I am forbidden to wear a ſharp poynted knyfe leſte i ſhuld hurt my ſelf with all / ergo i may wear a ſharp poynted knyfe to defend my ſelf with all. Ther is an other father whiche hathe many ſonnes / and he ſayeth vnto hys ſonnes i cō

Art thow wiſer then i am? how canſt thow lye with hym that hathe the french pokkes runnyng vpon hym and not be infected ther with? How canſt thow auoyde the pox and ly with hym / the whiche thyng all other that lay with hym hyther to could not auoid? What promiſ or priuilege haſt thow mor then other / granted the of god / that thow may ly with hym with out ieperdy when all other take the pox of hym?

As touchyng the learnyng that thow ſayeſt thow may learn of hym / what madnes is it to learne it of an vnlearned pokky driuel withe in auoidable ieperdi of the frenche pox / that thow mayſt with out ieperdy learn of they elder brother / whome i haue apoynted to be thy Scoolmaſter who is an hunderd ſold better learned then dromo is / Thynk ye then that thys vſe of images in the chirche which hathe bene the occaſion of mich abominable idolatri as the images

lately burned and broken in Englond do teſtifi / will be alowed of god the father in the day of iudgement? i thynk no. Was not images in the chirche a certayn ſeaſon before they were worſhipped? And fell not the peple by hauynge of them to the worſhippyng of them? then can they not be h

                  d with out ieperdy as the images lately broken in Englond bear witnes / If they were no peril of idolatri in hauyng of images what neded Iohan to haue ſayd in hys firſt Epiſtel beware of images / The wiſe man ſayethe that images ar made to the iniuri of god to be ſtumblyng blokkes or mouſ trappes for mennis ſoules / and to ſnare the fete of the ſimple in / and that / Initiuns ſcortandi excogitatio ſimulacrorumest, & corundem inuentio uitae corruptela, Ne

                      erant ab initio nec in aeternum manebunt. The fyndyng out of images is the begynnyng of fornication / and the inuention of the ſame is the deſtruction of lyfe / Nether haue they bene from the beginnyng nether ſhal they continue for euer. Then the chirch can not haue images with out ieperdy. And that we nede no images in Chriſtes chirche it is caſy to proue for the ſcripture teacheth the chirche all thyng that is neceſſari for it / What thyng can a blynde bloke or ſtone do withe ieperdy but a preacher of goddis worde can do the ſame? Can an image teache any example of faythe of hope charite / humilite / liberalite patience or of any other vertu but a Chriſten preacher both can do the ſame & dothe the ſame manyfoldes myche better & with out any peril of ſpiritual fornicatiō / 

How can an image teache faythe with hyr example whiche hathe non at all / & when as true faythe cummeth of hearyng of goddis worde how can the dum image teache fayth whiche cannot ſpeak one worde of god? How ſhal the image teach' charite that loueth no mā? How ſhal the image teach humilite that boweth to no man / or liberalite that gyueth nothyng? or patience whiche ſuffereth nothyng? Then if ye wolde let the ſcripture go abrode in to euery mannis hande / and make your preſtes as diligēt in preachyng as they ar byſy in vn profitable playes & ſhewes of ceremonies / or if ye wold admitt none to be preſtes but ſuche that were as able to teache / as blynd images ar / we ſhuld nede no images at all in the chirche / no more then / ther was in the primatiue chirche. Then when as images cannot be in the chirche without ieperdi of idolatri as ye bear witnes your ſelf which wil ſo long gyue outward worſhip vnto images whiche is idolatri / as ye haue images in the chirche / and we nede them not / and may want them well / and to put one ſelf in ieperdy where no nede is / is to tempt god / & that is ſin / it foloweth that it is not lawful to haue images in the chirche / namely where theyr worſhip is defended and where men haue vſed and vſe ſtill to abuſe them / and gyue to them outwarde worſhip as ye do. Thes few reaſones haue i brought be cauſ i wold not be long / i could haue brought out examples out of hiſtories & alowed writers and out of the ciuile lawes of Emperoures

to haue proued that images haue bene forbidden to be in the chirche / but i differ them vntil an other tyme / If i ſe not the abuſes of images taken away intendyng to bryng them with all the reaſones that i can make. Brynge ye now as many reſones for the hauyng and outward worſhip of images as i haue brought agaynſt them or ellis chyde out your parte / or procure that my book may be forbidden to be red that ye ned to take no ſuche importable payne vpon yow or ellis grant that ye haue bene deceyued and defended vnlawful doctrine.

How can thos prayers be other then wikked / where in the name of god is called vpon in vayn? Chriſt did not hele the ſoul of the blynde man with clay / but only he delyuered hym from hys blyndenes with it / therfore it foloweth not becauſ / he vſed clay agaynſt blyndenes that ye may vſe ſalted water to heal both the body and the ſoule / Where as it is ſayd that many were ſaued by the fayth of Ieſu Chriſte that is no other thyng to ſay then that many were ſaued by Chriſte whom they took hold vpon / by faythe / then is not fayth an other ſauiour beſyde god / but it ledeth vs vnto god / And when as god is our ſauiour and he draweth vs

It is great honeſte for yow to hold and theache ſuch

doctrine as when as it is writen agaynſt ye can not defend it but ar fayn to ſende to the goſpellers of Germany to fet help to aſſoyl the argumentes made agaynſt it. But to that particle where ye ſay that god vnderſtandeth the childer ſyngyng in the Latin tong which they vnderſtand not / and mean theyr by / that the prayers of them that pray not with hart as popiniayes ſpeake / and wote not what they ſay / ar pleaſant and acceptable vnto god / i anſwer that Chriſte alledgyng the ſayng of Eſai the Prophete / miſlyketh ſuch prayers in thes wordes / Thys peple draweth nere me and worſhippeth me with theyr lippes but theyr hartes ar far from me / Paule alſo in the xiiij. chapter of the firſt Epiſtel to the Corinthianes in thes wordes teſtifieth that the prayer that is ſpoken in a ſtrange tong whiche he that prayeth vnderſtandeth not / is of no effect & nought worth / If that i pray in a tong / my breath prayeth / but my mynde hath no profit Eraſmus Expoundeth thes wordes thus in hys Paraphraſis / If that i pray in a tong that the peple vnderſtandeth not / for an example in the afrike tong among the Grekes / ye rather if that i ſhuld ſpeake a langage whiche nether i nor other that ar by me vnderſtand / (as certane do which vſe to ſounde / the ſong that they haue learned in a ſtrange tong which they vnderſtand not thē ſelues (my brethe & wynde bringeth furth the wordes that pray / but my ſoul or mynde hath no fruit there of.

Where as ve anſwer in the goſpellers name more lyke a piper then a preacher that therfore now god is prayſed & honored with the ſound & pipyng of the organes becauſ it is writen in the old Teſtament / Laudate Dominum in ſono tubae omnis Spiritus laudet Dominum. Where is your memory maſter Biſſhop / haue ye forgotten that ye ſayde concernyng the worſhippyng of the croſ that all true honor of god is only in ſprete & procedeth from the harte? The organes haue no hart nort ſprete therfore theyr can cum no true honor or worſhip from them to god / therfore the ſound of the organes is no true worſhip or honor of / god / Ha

not mary and thys reporteth he alſo lyke hym ſelf / And becauſe he wold ſeme to be pryuy vnto the diſputation betwene Martin bucer and me ſum what he toucheth that was in our diſputation ſpoken of / but faſſhoneth it lyke hym ſelf at the leſte / that i myght know the man lyeth euen thorowly / Thus he reporteth my reſon made to bucer / The ſame autorite hath the kyng ouer all preſtes of hys realme and hys other ſubiectes that a father hath ouer his childer / but a father may forbid the preſtes of hys realme to mary then if they mary when he forbiddeth them to mary / they break the commandment of god who ſayeth childer obey your father and mother / i truſt no man wold thynk i ſhuld haue faſſhoned the argument in thys wiſe / for it hath no ſequence in it / And the father that hath but childer in the maior / i haue gyuen hym a Realm and hys childer preſtes in the minor. And then in the concluſion / i haue forgoten the kyng that i ſpak of / and ſpeke only

of the father / Whos mater is mych what in lyke perplexite reherſed as an honeſt ſimple mannes example was of Johan that maried alice & robert that maryed an / in proceſſ of the mater called an Johannis wyfe / and ioyned to Robert which the audience heard merely and called it playn adulteri / And after thys ſorte wraghton hathe wrāglyngly reherſed my argument / Then by your oun own confeſſion it was your argument.

               Becauſe thys long narration of your clerkly behauyng of your ſelf with Martin Bucere perteynethe very litle to the anſwer that ye ſhuld make me / & is nothyng agaynſt me / i wil reſon nothyng of it / But where as ye

ſay that nether Bucer nor i haue aſſoyled your argument / let them iudge whiche haue red my former book / But leſt i ſhuld diſſemble your argument / and pretend as i red it not as ye haue done to ſhāfully oft in thys book of youres / I will anſwer to your argument and if god will / aſſoyle it alſo. Therefor let vs reherſe your argument where with ye wold haue proued that preftes by the law of god may not mary. The Prince hathe the ſame pour of commandment and order of hys ſubiectes that the father hathe ouer hys childern / But by ſaynt Paul the father may order ſum of hys childer not to mary / ergo the Prince may order ſum of hys ſubiectes not tomary / As for your maior that a Prince hathe the ſame poure of commandment / and order of hys ſubiectes that the father hath ouer hys childrens / I grant it is true if it be playnly and ſimply thus vnderſtande / The Prince in all ſuch maters as he long vnto hym / hathe the ſame pour of commandement and order of hys ſubiectes that a father hath ouer hys childer that is as the father in hys hous hath autorite to command hys childer in all thynges that ar godly & for the profit of hys childer / So hath the Prince autorite in hys Ream in all ſuch maters as be long to a Prince to be orderers of / ouer hys ſubiectes to cōmande thē to theyr profit to the glori of god & to the welthe of hys Realm / But if ye make no exceptiō your maior is not alwayes true / for if the Prince hath the ſame pour of commandment ouer all hys ſubiectes that / a father hath to

command hys childer / When the father and childer ar with in the Princes dominion the childer ar the Princes ſubiectes / Then when as the father (as ye ſay) hath autorite to command certayn of hys childer ether to mary or not mary at hys pleaſure / if he commanded Thomas and Iohan to mary / and the Prince commanded the ſame not to mary / by your maior it were both ſin for Thomas and Iohan to mary / and ſin to not mary / for if they maried they brake the Princes commandment / and ſo ſinned / if they maried not they brake theyr fathers commandment / therfore tell vs whether ye meane by the worde ſame lyke or the ſelf ſame / and tell whether ye mak an exception or none / As for your minor / that by ſaynt Paul a father may order ſum of hys childer not to mary / if ye vnderſtand it ſo that he may forbyd certayn of hys childer that they ſhal neuer mary as lōg as they lyue / I deny your minor / & put yow vnto the profe of it / ye ſay that it is playn by ſaynt Paul / & the 7. chapter is quoted in the mergen / howbeit when as i red ouer the hole chapter i could find neuer one worde that gaue any ſuch autorite of commandment / but very myche to the contrari parte / as here after i ſhal declare / Ye ſhuld therfore haue ſhewed vs the place and haue made an argument ther of / Why haue ye not ſhewed vs the text / that maketh ſo mich for your purpoſe? Belyke ye wold as gladly haue ſhewed it as ye did ſhew vs miche glorious and ſuperfluous boſtyng but that ye were afrayed that / if it

were ſene / men of learnyng and iudgement ſhuld deme it to make nothyng for your purpos / But for all the hydyng of it / i truſt i ſhal find it out that ye mean of / A learned man of Germany writeth that ye alledged thys text of Poul for your purpoſe. Be that ſtandeth ſtede faſt in hys harte / hauyng no neceſſite / but pour of hys own wil / and hath determined that / in hys hart to kepe hys virgin doth wel / and ſo he that marieth hys virgin doth wel but he that marieth hyr not doth better. If thys be not the place that ye mean of / ſhew an other & we ſhall anſwer to it as well as we can / If thys be the place form an argument of the text for your purpoſe and it ſhall be anſwered / And in the mean ſeaſon i ſhal proue by euident and clere places of ſcripture that a father hath no autorite to commande hys childer to lyue all theyr lyfe tyme withe out mariage / I ſhall alſo proue by ij. learned Doctores whiche turned Paul out of Greke in to Latin / whiche knew the phraſe of Poul as wel as ye do / and vnderſtode the text as wel alſo that thys text maketh nothyng for your purpos Ierom expoundyng the ſame text ſayeth thes wordes / Ille firmus ſtatuit cuius puellae conſenſus Patris firmauit uoluntatem, He purpoſeth ſtedfaſt whoſe madens conſent hath confirmed the fathers will / Then by ſaynt Ierome the conſent of the made is required with out whiche the father can orden nothyng. Eraſmus in hys paraphraſi vpon the ſame place writeth thus / If any man perceyuyng that he hath liberti to be ſtow in mariage hys virgine or

not to beſtow hyr / and is not compelled by nede to ether of bothe / and hath determined and purpoſed in hys mynde to kepe hys virgine at home which deſyreth no mariage / doth ryght / for as it is ieperdous to hold hyr from mariage that is deſyrons of mariage / ſo it is vngodly to diſcorage madens myndes from the deſyre and vow of chaſtite. Ambroſe writyng vpon the ſame place ſayeth. Hoc dicit ut qui uirginem habet cui animus ad nuptias non est, ſeruet illam nec illi ingerat fomitem nuptiarum quam uidet nubendi uoluntatem non habere, Thys doth he ſay that he that hath a virgin not mynded to mary ſhuld kepe hyr and not in tyſe hyr to mariage whom he perceyuedh is not willyng to mary / ye haue heard the Doctors now let vs ſe what reſones we can fet out of the Scripture / What ſo euer autorite of order or commandment Paule gyueth vnto fathers that ſame hathe he receyued of the lorde / But he ſayethe in the vij. chapter of the former Epiſtel to the Corinthianes / that he hath no commandement at all of the lorde concernyng virgines / De Virginibus praeceptum Domini non habeo. Therfore haue fathers no autorite gyuen them of Paul to command theyr childer not to mary / for noman can receyue of Paule it that he hath not / but he hath no precept or commandment of virginite / Then can none haue that autorite of hym / then is it not playn by Paul that a father may command ſum of hys childer not to mary. When Paule which hath as myche autorite as any other Apoſtel / 

and hath receyued of god as miche autorite for fathers to theyr childer as any other Apoſtel / yi

                   receyued no autorite of god to giue fathers where by they myght command they children to be virgines / ye may be ſure that / ther is no other Apoſtel that granteth fathers autorite to command theyr children to be virgines and to lyue with out mariage. If that the Prince haue the ſame autorite ouer hys ſubiectes concernyng mariage that a father hathe ouer hys childer / I will reſon with yow thus / Where ye ſay the father hath autorite to command certayn of hys childern that they ſhal neuer mary / i ax yow whether by thes certayn ye mean Richard / Robert / and Rolland / only or all that he liſt to forbid to mary what ſoeuer they be and of what ſoeuer name. If that ye grant that the father hath autorite to commande whom ſoeuer of hys childer he lift to abſteyn from mariage / and he Prince hath the ſame autorite ouer hys ſubiectes that a father hath ouer hys childer / then may the Prince forbid all the laymen to mary as he hath forbidden the Preſtes / Alſo it foloweth that whē the prince may ſo order all hys ſubiectes by the law of god as a father may order all hys childer by the law of god / and a father by the law of god may ordre all hys childer to mary / ergo thē may a Prince order all hys ſubiectes by the law of god to mary / but all the preſtes of thys Realme ar the Princes ſubiectes ergo he may order them all by then law of god to mary.

Ye muſt ether bring furth ſum other reſon or ſcripture or ellis preſtes may mary iure diuino by the law of god / If ye ſay that therfore the mariage of preſtes is forbidden iure diuino by the law of god be cauſ the Prince forbid / deth preſtes to mary then if the kyng of france forbad men to eat oyſtens on the friday and fleſh on the ſonday / it wer forbidden iure diuino to eat oyſters on the frayday and fleſh on the ſonday and ſo myght it be lawful to day and to morow is dedly ſyn / That it is no ſin for a preſte to mary & that the forbiddyng of the mariage of preſtes is no law of god i will proue it more at large that all the nobles and comones of Englond may ſe how ſhamfully ye mokked them / bearyng them in hand that it was ſin / and forbidden by goddis law that a preſte ſhuld mary / firſt that it is no ſin by the law of god i proue it thus / All ſin and all thyng that is vnlawful is forbidden by the law of god / Paul ſayeth Roman. iij. by the law is ſin knowen / and Rom. vij. I knew not ſin but thorow the law / that is throw the law of god / But the mariage of preſtes is not fotbydden by the law of god / for Aron and Zacharias teſtifi that it was not forbidden in the old Teſtament / Paul vnto Timothe and Titus witneſſeth in thes worde a Biſſhop muſt be the huſband of one wyfe that mariage of preſtes is not forbidden in the new Teſtament

/ and allthyng that is ether bidden or forbidden is forbidden ether in the new Teſtament or in the old / but ye ſe it is forbidden in nether / of both / therfore it is no ſin by the law of god for a preſte to mary. If that the law of forbiddyng of preſtes mariages were the law of god / as ye ſay / then it ſhuld be generall to al cuntres & the tranſgreſſion of that law ſhulde euery where be elyke ſyn / but in Grecia / and in Denmark / and in hic Germany it is no ſyn for a preſte to mary / both be cauſe they make no vowes / and becauſe the Princes forbid not there preſtes to marye. Thē is not the forbiddyng of preſtes mariages the law of god / but cōtrari to the law of god as i ſhall proue it thus / It is contrary to the law of god to forbid in payn of deth that god commanded in payne of damnation / but they that forbid many that cannot leue chaſte with out mariage / to mary forbid that god commanded for he ſayd by hys ſeruant Paul if they lyue not chaſte let them mary / If ye will that i ſhal ſay if they can not lyne chaſt let them mary / then ar theyr ſum that can not lyne chaſte / If that al the preſtes ſhuld be bound to mary that kepe not them ſelues chaſte / few preſtes ſhuld lyue ſyngle / Then is it agaynſt goddis law to forbid al preſtes to mary namely them that kepe not them ſelues chaſte and haue not the gift of chaſtite.

thys text is to be vnderſtand that what ſoeuer as man aſketh of god which is neceſſari vnto ſaluation that he wil grant hym the ſame / But when as thos thynges ar aſked that ar not neceſſari for ſaluation the aſkers thoghe they be good men git not at all tymes of god theyr aſkyng / as Paul whē he aſked thriſe of god that he wold take from hym the prik of the fleſhe obtened not hys aſkyng not withſtandyng that Chriſte ſayde what ſoeuer ye aſk the father in my name / that ſhal he gyue yow and whi? becauſe that it that he axed was not neceſſari vnto hym for hys ſaluation. Then when as the gift of chaſtite to lyue honeſtly with out a companion / is not neceſſari vnto ſaluation / for many men haue bene ſaued with out that gift / god by the forſayd promiſ is not bound to grant euery one it that ax it of hym. And that euery mā is not ordened to receyue that gift / Chriſte our ſauiour beareth wit neſ / in the xix. chapter of Mathew in thes wordes ſpeakyng of them that myght lyue honeſtly with out a wife / All men ar not able to receyue that worde / but they to whome it is gyuē / And Paule in the ſeuent chaprer of the .i. to the Corinthianes / ſayeth i wold all mē were as i am / but euery man hath hys proper gift of god / one ſo and an other ſo / that is one man hath the gift of god to lyue chaſte with out the vſe of mariage and an other hath it not.

               The hunter
               Whether my concluſiones folow of your minor or no / i reporte me vnto all then that haue learned Logik or haue any natural wit. I will forme my argument ones agayn that they that haue not my other booke / may ſe the argument here / ye ſay. The ſame autorite hath a Prince of order and commandment of hys ſubiectes that a father hathe ouer hys childer / But a father by ſaynt Paule may order certayne of hys childer not to mary / ergo the Prince may order certayne of hys ſubiectes not to mary. Tel me i pray yow whether god hath apoynted any childer by name / or any nombre of childer that a father may forbid to mary / or is it in the fathers libertie to forbid whom ſoeuer he wil to mary and ſo many as he will? What if he will forbid all hys childer to mary / may he not forbid all? ſhew what place of Scripture reſtrayneth hym that he may not as wel forbid all as one? The father hathe the ſame pour of order and commandment ouer all hys childer / that he hathe ouer one / but ye grant that he may commande or order on of hys childer not to mary / ergo / he may order or command them all not to mary / And the Prince hathe the ſame autorite ouer hys ſubiectes / that a father hath ouer hys childer / but a father may forbid all hys childer to mary / ergo a Prince / by your minor or may forbid all hys ſubiectes to mary / for he hath as myche autorite

of commandment ouer all hys ſubiectes / as ouer a certayn / or ellis all were not ſo moche bounde to obey hym as / the certayn of whom he had the autorite of cōmandment ouer. Thē it foloweth thus. He that may forbid all the ſubiectes of hys Realm to mary / may deſtroy mariage in hys Realm / But by your argument the Prince may forbid all the ſubiectes of hys Realme to mary / therfore by your minor a Prince may deſtroy mariage in hys Realme. Where ye ſay that they that commanded virginite moſte / wold not haue all virgines / i reken that is the treweſt worde that ye ſpak in all thys booke / for your father the pope whiche was the greteſt commander of virginite / of all other / Hath alowed ſtewes in Rome / and ſuffereth beſyde wymen hores / the filthines of the other kynde alſo / And ye my lorde prior of the grene freris in the bank / the greateſt commander of virginite in the hole Realm of Englond / therfore apoynte with in your dominion and lordſhip an hole ſtrete fore open bandry / and kepe a comonſtewes / that theyr ſhuld not be to many virgines but if there be any yong madens or yong men / that ar diſpoſed to depoſe and gyue ouer theyr virginite / they may theyr offer it vp to priap
                     •
                  s. And ſo is it tru that they that commanded virginite moſte wold not haue all virgines. Where as ye ſay that ſaynt Paule thoghe he were not maried / and yit wiſſhed that all were as he was not with ſtandyng wold not deſtroy mariage / i ſay the contrari / for i ſay if Paul were a virgine & wiſſhed

all men to be as he was / that is a virgine / then wiſſhed he that there ſhuld be no father nor mother / for fathers and mothers ar no virgines / and that no maried foll ſhuld be but all virgines. Then wold he with that wiſh that mariage were deſtroyed. But that wold not ſaint Poul therfore ye vnderſtande not ſaynt Paul as ye ſhulde do / for Poule had a wyfe and wiſſhed that all the Corinthianes whiche anaunced them ſelues of virginite and widowhede could lyue chaſte with out a woman as he dyd / which leſt hys wyfe in an other place / then where he preached / and that all men were with out care as he was / whiche thyng comonly foloweth mariage. But where as ye knok me on the pate / and lay vnlearned arroganci to my charge / let vſ now trie it whether yow or i am more worthy to be accuſed of vnlearned arrogance / Ye ſay that Paule wss not maried / and i hold that he was maried / how ſhal thys mater be beſt diſcuſſed? I know no better meanes then to call to witnes ſum that were ether alyue in poules tyme or ellis were very nere hys tyme / I call for witneſſes ignacius & Clement that Paule had a wyfe / Now hear the witneſſes ſpeake / Euſebius in the third booke of the Eccleſiaſtical ſtory in the thyrd chapter reporteth Clementes wordes thus. Clement whos wordes / we haue here marked / writynge agaynſt them which diſpiſe mariage / ſayethe thes wordes. Do they alſo diſalow the Apoſtelles / for Peter and Philip had wyues and gaue theyr doughters to be maried vnto men / 

but alſo Paul the Apoſtel / is not aſhamed to make mention in a certayn Epiſtel / of hys make or companion and to grete hyr / whom he ſayeth he led not about with hym that he myght be more redy / and combreles to preache the goſpel. Eraſmus in hys annotationes vpon the iiij. chapter of the Epiſtel to the Philippianes reporteth the witnes of ignatius in thys wyſe. The holy martyr ignatius in an Epiſtel / to the Philadelphianes doth playnly grant / that not only Peter / but alſo Paule and other of the Apoſtelles had wyues / & that he had them in noleſſ reputation therfore / becauſe / the Patriarches / & Prophetes was maried / not for theyr luſtis ſake but for childers ſake / Chryſoſtom granteth that there were ſum which rekened that Paule in thys place did ſpeake vnto hys wyfe / but he diſſenteth / ſhewyng no cauſ of hys diſſention / But to whome is it more ryght that we ſhuld ſtik to Clement and ignatius / of the which the one was ſaynt Peters companion / and the other was ſaynt markes the Euangeliſtes diſciple / or ſhal we beleue better Chryſoſtom / which was ſo longe a ſpace after the Apoſtelles tyme? thus far Eraſmus / Let indifferent men iudge now whether i that bryng autorite for me / or ye that pronounce boldly by geſſ with out all reſon and autorite / ar more worthy to be accuſed of arrogant ignorance.

               The Seconde concluſion is as wiſe / that i grant by

thys argument that preſtes myght haue maried / if the Prince had not forbidden it. If i proue that preſtes may not mary / becauſ of theyr vow do i therfore grāt that the vow falyng they myght mary? If i took vpon me to proue that one oweth me monie / for my labor / becauſ he promiſed me / doth thys infer thys concluſione that if he had not promiſed me / he had ought me nothyng for my labor?
            
            
               The hunter
               There is away from a village to the marcat towne ouer a bryge / ouer the whiche all men with out any toule had wont euer to go to the mercat / the lorde of the village vpon a mercat day ſet one of hys ſeruantes on the brydge to ſtop euery man to go ouer that brydge that wold not / for hys paſſage pay vj. d. in the yeare / the ſeruant letteth non paſſ but them that promiſ to pay vj. d. The pore men be cauſ they muſt nedes go to mercat / to ſel theyr corne to git them alyuyng ther with / promiſ all to pay that he requireth / At the day apoynted for the receyuyng of thys money / he by hys ſeruant commandeth them to pay the vj. d. and requireth the mony alſo by thyer promiſ / whether is thys gentle man only the cauſe of payng thys mony / or he is bothe cauſe of promiſyng and of payng of it alſo?

If thys gentle man had not required of them nether to promiſ thys monye nor to pay it / the pore men myght haue gone as well toolfre / to the mercate as they had wont to do before theyr lordes new requeſt and commandment. Euen ſo is it betwen the Prince and the preſtes. For by whoſe autorite / do ye require of euery one that cummeth to yow for orders of ſubdecon decon and preſihode / the vow of chaſtite? By the autorite of god or by the autorite of the Prince / ye can ſhew no autorite that ye haue of god to require of all that ſhal take thos orders / the vow of chaſtite. If that ye do it by the autorite of the kyng then it is the lyngis commandement that ye ſhall require of euery one that ſhall be ſubdecone decone and Preſte to vow chaſtite. Then when it is the kyngis commandment that thys vow ſhallbe required / which wold not haue ben offered / if it had not bene required / and the kyng commandeth all them / of whome he commanded yow Biſſhoppes that the vow ſhuld be required of / to kepe theyr vow that is to lyue ſingle with out wiues all theyr lyues / the vow of chaſtite concernyng preſtes is as well The kyngis commandment as the forbiddyng of mariage is. Then where as i reſon / if therfor the mariage of preſtes be vnlawful becauſe the kyng forbidde thē it / th if the kyng wold not forbid it it ſhuld not be vnlawful / & ye ſay that it is vnlawful alſo becauſ they haue vowed chaſtite / i ſay that if foloweth neuer the leſ of your ſayng that if the Prince wold not command Biſſhoppes to require

of ſubdecones decones and preſtes / the vow of chaſtite / and commanded not the preſtes to lyue with out wyues that it were not contrari to the law of god for a preſte to mary / Anſwer me / whē Biſſhoppes require no vowes / and preſtes make no vowes and the kyng forbiddeth no preſte to mary / why may not a preſte then / mary? How is it then de iure diuino? A man that will take hede may eſpie that your ſprete is an vnconſtant ſprete / for in ſum places when ye ar axed in Englond / whi that preſtes may not mary / ye anſwer that they may not mary be cauſe they ar forbidden by the law of god / in Germany ye anſwer that they may not mary becauſ the Prince forbiddeth them to mary / & in your Catechiſine ye ſhew thys caus that preſtes may not mary / Matrimoni is left at libertie to all men ſauyng preſtes & other / which of theyr fre liberti / by vow aduiſedly made / haue choſen the ſtate of continenci. Seme ye not here to ſay that only the vow hyndereth preſtes and ſuch other to mary? In thys place ye make no mention that they ar forbidden by goddis law / nether make ye any mētion that the forbidding of the Prince hyndereth them to mary. Bere do ye play as a fox doth when he is chaced out of on hole which rumneth in to an other / and when that ſerueth not flieth in to the thyrde. If that ye can bryng no other cauſ that preſtes ſhuld not mary but becauſ they haue made a wilful or a fre vow / I will proue that the vow is nether fre nor willful but conſtrayned by compulſion / if not

in all the votaries and preſtes that ar thys day in Englond / at leſte in a great nombre namely in all them that wold not haue vowed if the vow had not bene required of them / whiche if i bring to paſſ ther ſhall no voluntari vow hynder preſtes & ſuch lyke to mary. Now to the purpoſe Nothyng is fre that is conſtreyned by a commandment to on way / but the vow of chaſtite is conſtreyned whils it is commanded by the Prince to be required of all ſubdecones decones and preſtes / & that they ſhall lyue with out wyues / ergo the vowes of ſubdecones decones & preſtes ar not fre / If that ye anſwer that ſubdecones decones and preſtes may chus whether they will be votaries or no before they be decones ſubdecones or preſtes / i ſay / it that / a a man anoydeth before he is ſubdecon / auoydeth not beynge onis made ſubdecon / then when there is no ſubdecon but he is a votari / and muſt ether not be ſubdecon or ellis be auorary / how can a ſubdecon auoyde the vow? and ſo with decones and preſtes / If that ye ſay then when men know that the vow is indiuiſible copled withe preſtehode / all mē may chus whether they wil be preſtes or no / and ſo is the vow fre / i anſwer that where ſo euer the goſpel of Chriſte is / there muſt nedis be prechers there of / and miniſters of the Sacramentes whom ye call preſtes / It that muſt be / can not be auoyded / but there muſt be preſtes in Englond / then ar ther ſum that can not auoide but be preſtes vpon whom ſoeuer the lote falleth / Chriſte commandeth in euery Chriſten Realme

that hys goſpel ſhal be preched / and hys Sa cramentes ſhal be miniſtred / & when as the miniſteri is commanded to be / it is therbi commanded that ther ſhall be miniſters of the ſame / then Chriſte commandyng that hys worde ſhal be prea ched / commandeth that theyr ſhall be certayn miniſters of it / and of all the ſame that Chriſte commandeth to be hys miniſters the Prince commandeth yow to require the vow of chaſtite / & ye will not ſuffer them that Chriſte ſendeth to be hys miniſters / to be admitted to theyr office / except they make vnto yow the vow of chaſtite / then it is falſ that ye ſayd that all men myght chuſe whether they wold be votaries or no / & that all men myght chuſe whether they wold be preſtes or no / for whē as there muſt be preſtes / and the vow of chaſtite muſt be required of the ſame / of them then that muſt be preſtes / the vow can not be avoded / what fre election and liberti is thys? Apore ſcolare of cambrydge is brought vp of a child tyl he be xxiiij. year old in learnyng and canno ſtill of any occupation ſauyng only of learnyng / he is a felow of a colledge whos ſtatutes require that at the depar tyng of one preſte an other ſhall ſuccede in hys roume / that a certayn nombre of preſtes may be euer in the colledge / on

                  lder is beneficed / & thys ſcolar is eldeſt and muſt ether be preſte and ſo becum a votari / or ellis he muſt leſe hys lyuyng in the colledge / If he could chuſe he wolde not forſwear mariage and be a votari / but for fear of Ieſyng hys lyuyng he taketh the vow that is offered

hym / and ſo is auotari / is not thys man compelled to be a votari by lady ponerty? The men of monſtrel after long beſegement pretendyng to gyue vp the ceti / let in at theyr gates ſo many of our men as they thought they myght ouercum / and when they were in / let doū / the port culles & killed an c. of our mē / The capitane beinge ther with ſore greued / incoragyng hys men ſetteth mor freſhly on the citi then he dyd before / and he perceyuyng that he is able to win the citi by force / axeth them if they will gyue ouer the citi to hym and in that condition will let hym haue an c. men to order at hys pleaſure to ſle them or to do with them what he liſt / that all the reſt of the citi mayeſcape or that they will ſtand to theyr aduenture / to be filled euery mothers ſon / They perceyuyng that they can hold the citi no longer grant the captayne hys requeſte and gyue vp the citi vnto hym. He is fully purpoſed be fore the c. men be choſen out or apoynted / to make bond men of them all. And to make euery on of them ſwear vnto hym that they ſhal be hys true bond men. An c. men ar ether choſen out by lotes / or offer theym ſelues vp for the ſafegarde of the citi / to the capitane / he maketh them all ſwear to be hys true bond men as lōg as they lyue / They do ſweare / May all thes if they will auoyd the oth of bondage? is theyr one among al thes that cā chuſe but he muſt be a bondman? Non at all / ſo cā no more the preſtes of Englond auoyd the vow of chaſtite / for as fully as thys capitane is purpoſed to require of all them

that ſhal offer them ſelues or ſhal be offered vp vnto hym / the oth and promiſ of bondage / ſo fully ar ye mynded to require the vow of chaſtite of all them that god ſendeth to yow to make preſtes of / and all them that arſent of thē ſelues or of theyr frendes to yow to be ordered. Therfore the vow of chaſtite that all the ſubdecones decones and preſtes make in Englonde / is ſeruile ful of bondage / conſtreyned and compulſed / in al them that wold not haue vowed chaſtite if no vow had bene required. Take now the ſum of all our ſimilitudes in thys argument. That which is all wayes copled / and inſeparablely ioyned vnto a thyng / cannot be auoyded of hym that ſhall take that thyng / as he that wil take aloe and lay it on hys tong he can not auoid the bitterneſ of the ſame / but the vow of chaſtite is alwayes copled / and inſeparably ioyned to the orders of ſubdecon decon and preſtode ergo noman that will take the order of ſubdecon decon or preſtehod can a woyde the vow of chaſtite / But nothyng is fre that cannot be auoyded / and the vow of chaſtite that the preſtes decones and ſubdecones take cannot be auoyded / ergo the vou of chaſtite that ſubdecones decones & preſtes make is not fre / Anſwer to the partes of my argumēte as i haue anſwered to the prates of youres / But if ye cannot anſwere / gyue ouer your holde or ellis / in the ſtede of an anſwer chide ſcold & brawl as ye vſe comōly to do when ye haue no argumēt nor reſonto help your ſelf: with all.

               The Thyrd concluſione

is the ſelf ſame with the ſeconde / in other termes that by me mariage of preſtes was no ſin before god til the kyngis maieſti / made it ſin before god.

/ and therfore ar more buſy then i / i gyue yow that name again for tythe / tyl ye haue turned your cōditiones / as for your other namesi truſt i am as well quite of them be thys tyme as of buſy.
            
            
               The reſcuer
               No man can ſpeake here in farther / then the man in hys booke will make / god and a vow / i wold haue ſpoken of heretike / But he may not ſo be called till the book be anſured / therfore he hath made a ſpeciall requeſt / as i haue before noted / But now maſter hunter your houndes haue ron at ryot / and leuyng the fox yerned / ōly at the dere / whiche in the kyngis maieſtes cloſ ground / with your maſkery is felony all thoghe ye ſpeake ſo playnly as it may be acompted day. Thys is your fault ſo manifeſt / and apparant as it excedeth your pour to cloſe or hyde it. God gyue yow grace to make a more fruit ful ſuit to hys goodnes / and to the kingis maieſtie / for your recōciliation to bothe theyr fauoures thē your vndiſcrete ſuit in thys huntyng hath deſerued.
            
            
               The hunter
               I deſyred yow goodmā gardiner (or ellis i lie) that ye ſhuld not be ſo raſhe

as ye had wont to be / to call me heretike withe out a cauſe as ye did ones in your hall ryght proudly becauſe i weare a cloke and a hat of the new facion / But i could not git / my requeſt for ye haue called me now twyſe Heretike and neiher haue ye anſwered to my argumētes nether ſhewed me what Hereſies i held nether haue ye confuted any falſe Soctrine or Hereſi that i holde therfore ye do wrong thus lyingly and falſly to ſklander me. Thynk yow becauſ that ye haue taken it in a cuſtō to call men Heretikes god will take it for no ſin? Is ſin no ſin becauſ it is of
                     •
                   vſed? Well ye ar a mā in autorite & may do what ye liſt / and no man can haue any ryght where ye beare ruel. I muſt ſeke therfore for ryght of an hyer pour / But now haue ye ſayde that ye can ſay to defend the fox & that he is not in Englond / how be it ye haue profited nothyng at all for ye haue nether proued by reſon nor ſcripture that the popis Soctrine which ye haue taken in hand to defende / is good or agreyng with the worde of god. Nether haue ye confuted my reſones which i brought in my former booke agaynſt the popis learnyng which is now holden in Englond / Therfore ther is nothyng to let me but that i may cōclude in thys booke as i dyd in my former. Who ſoeuer holdeth ſtill the pepis doctrine cōtrari to the worde of god / holdeth ſtill the po pe which is Antichhriſte / But ye hold ſtill in Englond the popis doctrine contrarito the worde of god / therfore ye hold ſtill in Englond the pope which is Antichriſte. And thys ſalf doctrine do ye

defend / thē ar ye a defender of Antichriſte. Euery defender of Antichriſte / is Chriſtis enemy and the kynges / But ye ar a defender of Antichriſte / therfor ye ar Chriſtes enemy & the kyngis. If that Chriſtis enemy & the kyngis / mought ſtill occupi in Englond that occupation which maketh hym Chriſtis enemi & the kyngis / with out forbiddyng or correction after that hys fault is openly knowē / The officers of Englond & gouernoures vnder the kyng / were not Chriſtis frēdes & the kyngis / But i truſt they ar Chriſtis frendes & the kyngis the
                     ••
                  fore / i truſte that they wil at leſte forbid yow / your deueliſh occupation.
            
            God ſaue the kyng.
         
         
            Twelue new erronius articles of Steuengardinars crede taght in hys boke called the examination of the hunter.
            1 The cerimonies & traditions whiche the buſſhop of rome hath ordined / and ar now allowed in England ar the pale of the chirche of Englond.
            2 The popis cerimonies and traditions / ar good and polytique lawes / Wherbi god hath Encloſed the kyngs ſubiects vnder his mageſti alone.
            3 As king Richard an euel mā made a good politique law for the body & cōmon welth of Englōd / ſo can the pope an euel mā mak good lawes & holſum doctrine for mans ſowl & Chriſtes churche.
            4 What ſo euer is good ſpoken and vſed by man is miche mor of god / then Chriſts doctrine is hys fathers doctrine.
            5 He that ſayeth that the lawe of the goſpel ought

only to be holden in Chriſts churche and is ſufficient alon for it / ſpekith ſo far out of reaſon that he is not worthy to be reaſoned with all.
            6 Thei that hold that the croſſ of ſiluer or gold oght not to be worſhipped with kiſſing of it & bowing & kneling to it / ar ennimies of Chriſts trew croſe & tak away the means that might ſet owt the glori of Chriſtis croſe.
            7 Nether Paul nor the croſe can be worſhipped with godly honor.
            8 As Chriſt vſed clai for an inſtrumēt to heal the blindmans eyis withal and hath ſaued diuerſe bi faith & made it an inſtrument of ſaluation / & as god hath ordined Timothe to be an inſtrument of ſaluation both to hymſelf & for other / ſo may the pope orden halli water to be an inſtrument of ſaluation both of body and ſoule to al them that ar ſprinkled with it.
            9 No man can commit idolatrie with hys bodi alon & in only kiſſing of an image or idole / and in only kneling to it can no idolatrie be committed.
            10 For as moche as god vnderſtandeth thē that ſing in Latin / thogh they vnſterſtand not themſelues ther praer is acceptable be for god.
            11 As a father may forbid certane of his childer to mari ſo may a king in his kingdome forbid certane of hys ſubiects to mary / that is to ſay all the preſtes of his realme.
            12 He that wold take a way the popis ceremonies owt of the chirche / ſhuld driue away all godlines / and ſemlines / al religius and denowt behauiour owt of the chyrche.
