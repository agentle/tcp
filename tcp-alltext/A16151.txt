            MOst religious and renowned Prince, if the Heathen, reaching no farther than the light of Nature could leade them, sawe those Common-weales would soone flourish, whose Gouernors were giuen to the study of Philosophy; how much rather must Christians ascribe that to heauenlie Wisdome, which they did to earthly, and confesse those Realms to be blessed indeed, where the chiefe Rulers are carefull to seeke first the Kingdome of God, & to prefer the loue of true pietie before all respect of humane policie? For since Gods purpose and promise is to honour them
               1. Sam. 2. 
               that honour him; and no good thing can be wanting to those that rightly worship him according to his will; how liberall benedictions & mercifull protections may those Princes hope for at Gods hands, who set their hearts wholly to seeke him, and make all their wayes straight in his sight? This fauour from heauen, to be guided by good and godly Princes, the Realme of England hath tasted a long time, to their no small comfort; whiles for these 45 yeeres by the Christian care of a most milde and gratious Queene, (now with God) they haue beene directed to the trueth of the Gospell of Christ; and defended in peace from the violence of all impeachers and impugners of either. And after her decease, though our vnthankfulnesse had prouoked the wrath of God, and our vnfruitfulnesse well deserued, the Kingdome of God should be taken

from vs; yet he that is rich in mercie towards all that call on him, respecting more the glory of his name, lest his enemies should blaspheme, than any worthinesse of ours, not onely continued, but increased his accustomed goodnesse to vs; and gaue your Maiestie, being the lineall and rightfull heire to the Crowne of this Realme, a present and peaceable entrance with the greatest applause of all states, sorts, and sides, that hath beene seene these many ages; and specially of the godlie, who saw the happinesse of the former gouernment would be doubled by the manifolde gifts and graces of your Christian and Princely integrity, clemency, bounty, wisdome, and piety. And surely their hope hath not deceiued them: for who so hath rightly discerned, and duely considered your be

Whereof, because it pleased God and your Maiestie, I should attend you aswell at your Table in your first Progresse into these Countries of Surrey and Hampshire, as at your conference for matters of Religion, and assemblie of States for the welfare of this Realme, I can beare certaine and assured witnesse; as likewise can the rest of your Nobles and Bishops then present; who all, with no lesse admiration than contentation, heard, with what sharpnesse of vnderstanding, maturenesse of knowledge, soundnesse of reason, firmnesse of memorie, and aptnesse of speech, your Highnesse entred, debated and resolued the greatest and hardest points of diuine and humane wisdome; shewing in euery of them such dexteritie, perspicuitie, and sufficiencie, as I professe

before God without flattery, I haue not obserued the like in any man liuing. As therefore I iudge the whole Realme blessed and beloued of God for giuing them a Prince of such rare prudence, intelligence, and experience; so doe I after the example of the Apostle thinke my selfe happy, that I shall this dayActs 26. bring these matters in question before so learned, religious, and iudicious a King, no lesse skilfull in the sacred Scriptures, than carefull to continue the true Christian faith thorowout his Dominions, without dissenting from the will of God reuealed in his Word, or departing from the primitiue Church of Christ in her best and purest times.
            May it then please your excellent Maiestie to be enformed, that vpon some mens too much forwardnesse to innouate as well the doctrine as the discipline of the Church of England, (they thinking those deuices alwayes best, which are newest) it was rife in Pulpits, and vsuall in Catechismes, that the death of Christ Iesus on the Crosse, and his bloudshed for the remission of our sinnes, were the least cause and meane of our redemption; but he did, and must suffer the death of the soule, and the very same paines which the damned doe in hell, before we could be ransomed from the wrath of God; and this was that descent of Christ to hell, which we are taught by the Creed to beleeue. This opinion began to preuaile so fast, that children were trained to it, and the people led to controle the Scriptures, as not rightly deliuering the true cause of our redemption by Christ, in that they mention no meane to ransome vs from death and hell, but the bloud of his crosse, and death admitted in the bodie of his flesh; and therefore in all such places we must (as they say) by a kinde of Synecdoche conceiue the death of the damned to haue beene suffered for a season in the soule of Christ, and that to be the full and perfect price of our redemption. I was much grieued, I confesse to your sacred Maiestie, to finde this so often in Catechismes, and frequent in Pulpits, and without iust ground in the Word of God to be so confidently blazed, whiles the doctrine of this Realme, proposed by publike authoritie to the people in the Booke of Homilies, was neglected and loathed: And vpon conference with the most reuerend Father the late Archbishop (now with God)

was aduised in open audience to deliuer, what the Scriptures teach touching our redemption by the death and bloudshedding of Iesus Christ the Sonne of God. Which accordingly I did, declaring by occasion of the Apostles words, Be it far from me to reioyce, but in the Crosse of Christ, first the Contents, and then the Effects of Christes crosse. In the Contents of Christes crosse IThe sermons shewed what Christ suffered by the witnes of holy Scripture, and what he suffered not; and there ioyned this issue; That no Scripture doth teach the death of Christs soule, or the paines of the damned, to be requisite in the person of Christ, before he could be the Ransomer of our sinnes, and Sauiour of the world. And because the proofs, pretended for this point, might be three; Praedictions, that Christ should suffer those paines; Causes, why he must suffer them; and Signes, that he did suffer them: I likewise insisted on all three, and shewed there were no such Praedictions, Causes, nor Signes of the true paines of hell to be suffered in the soule of Christ, before he could saue vs. Wherein, his Agonie in the Garden, and Complaint on the Crosse were examined, as well by the rules of holy Scripture, as by the maine consent of all the Fathers. And lest the death of Christ suffered in the bodie of his flesh on the altar of the Crosse, as it is described in the Scriptures, and the shedding of his precious bloud should be disabled or distrusted of any, as no sufficient meanes or price of our redemption; in the Effects of Christs crosse, I prooued the merits of Christes suffering to be infinite in respect of his person, who was God, and of the perfection of his obedience vnto the death of the Crosse; the maner of his offering to be bloudie foreshewed by the Sacrifices of the Law, and sealed by the Sacraments of the Gospell; the power of his death to be mightie as able to conquer Sinne, Hell, and Satan; the comfort of his Crosse to be necessarie to which we must all be conformed to suffer with him, before we can raigne with him; the victorie thereof to be heauenly, in that he rose the third day into a celestiall and eternall life, hauing all his enemies vnder his feet. Yet for peace sake I yeelded, the name of hell-paines might in some sort be tolerated in the sufferings of Christ, if we meant thereby great and intolerable paines, as the word is sometimes metaphorically taken in the

Scriptures, at the least by our vulgar translation: for the word indeed was Sheôl, which is vsed aswell for the graue, as for hell; and so those speeches of Dauid, That the paines of Sheol found him out or compassed him, might import the paines of death, which brought men to their graues.
            And concerning that Article of our Faith, Christ descended to Hell; I taught, it might not by the course of the Creed be referred to Christ liuing, but to Christ dead, and safely note the conquest which Christs manhood after death had ouer all the powers of darkenesse, declared by his resurrection, when he rose Lord ouer all his enemies in his owne person; Death, Hell, and Satan not excepted; and had the Keyes (that is, all power) of death and hell deliuered him by God, that those in heauen, earth, and hell should stoope vnto him, and be subiect to the strength and glorie of his Kingdome. These things were first vttered by speech, and after committed to writing, that aswell the parts as proofes of euery point might more plainly appeare to all that would examine them. My care was in either of these to ioyne with the doctrine prescribed by the booke of Homilies to be taught in the Church of God to the people; That there is none other thing, that can be named vnder heauen, to
               The first and second Sermon of the Passion. 
               saue our soules, but this only worke of Christes precious offering his bodie vpon the Altar of the Crosse. For so great was Gods wrath and displeasure towards sinne, that he could be pacified by no other meanes, but only by the sweet and precious bloud of his deere Sonne. And so pleasant was this sacrifice and oblation of his Sonnes death, which he so obediently and innocently suffered, that God would take it for the onely and full amends for all the sinnes of the world. As for Christs descent to hell, I deliuered the same ends and intents, which the booke of Homilies doth, where it saith; Christes death destroyed death, and ouercame the Diuell.
               The Sermon of the Resurrection. 
               His death destroyed hell with all the damnation thereof. Christ passed thorow death and hell, to the intent to put vs in good hope, that by his strength we shall do the same. He destroyed the Diuell, and all his tyrannie, and openly triumphed ouer him, and tooke away from him all his Captiues (meaning all the Elect) and hath raised, and set them with himselfe amongst the heauenly Citizens aboue.
            
            These things thus preached and printed by me, it may please your excellent Maiestie to vnderstand, were first impugned

by an hastie and humorous Treatise, whiles my Sermons were yet vnder the Presse; and after by a larger and warier Defence, which is this that I now refute. The Treatiser slidingThe Trea

And because in this Treatise I found moe distempered pangs of erroneous follie, than aduised steppes of learning or religion, I refelled the chiefe reasons thereof in a Conclusion added to my Sermons, as theyThe Conclusion of the Sermons. were in printing; not thinking it worth my time or paines to make any longer resutation of him, that remembred so little of that I had vttered, and reasoned so loosely for that which he would establish.
            No sooner were those Sermons and that Conclusion published, but the curious Brethren, seeing their kingdome of conceits impugned, made their obseruations on both, and sent their collections and reasons to the Treatiser, that he might make a fresh Defence; correcting in many things hisThe Defence. former rashnesse, and now leading him rather cunningly to cauill with the Fathers speeches, than so proudly to disdaine their testimonies: which maketh him not only to change his minde in many matters from that he sayd before, but often to crosse himsel

In this Defence (for so they call it) they labour more to impeach my proofes, than to iustifie his former reasons; and as it were slipping their owne necks out of the coller, they inuade my Sermons with their whole might, making the world beleeue, I haue not only proued nothing, but vttered such strange positions, as no Diuinitie will endure. Howbeit in their hoatest onsets I might

soone perceiue, they still wrested my words from their right sense, as they did both Scriptures and Fathers; and shrouded themselues vnder certaine generall and ambiguous phrases, as, That Christ suffered the proper wrath and meere iustice of God, and full punishment of sinne, in substance, though not in circumstance; with which they seeke to blinde the Reader and intangle the Opponent, that he should neuer finde their exact and particular Assertion, but they would alwayes be sure to haue a refuge to their large and vnknowen couerts; from which they step not an inch, and without which they say nothing, for feare to be taken tardie with heresie or open impietie.
            To waste time, and enter brabbles about words, my manifolde businesses and publike seruices did not suffer me; and had not my late Soueraigne (now with God) at her last being at the Castle of Farnham taken knowledge of the things questioned betwixt me and them, and directly commanded mee neither to desert the doctrine, nor to let the calling, which I beare in the Church of God, to be trampled vnder foot by such vnquiet Refusers of trueth and authoritie, I confesse to your excellent Maiestie, I had made farre shorter worke with them, and not spent a quarter of the paper which now is bestowed on the cause. Vpon her appointment, which was sacred to me (notwithstanding my sicknesse, which detained me two yeeres from studie, whiles I was forced to seeke the recouerie of my health, and many other affaires and attendances, which continually called me away) I beganne to reuiew the whole; and since there was neither order nor method in their writing, to trace them in their confusion, which hath beene most tedious; and in the end to let them see, That neither for themselues, nor against me, in that whole Defence they haue vttered one true sentence; though the waightiest and most of their matters, besides their darke and deceitfull generalities, be proposed with as it were, in a sense, it seemeth, after a sort, and such like wauering and perplexed speech.

to commit it to the Presse; and so had I done the first yeere of your Maiesties entring into this Realme, had not the infection of your principall citie, and my attendance on your Maiestie (as my duetie bound me) here in this countrey stayed me.
            The points handled in the former Sermons, and iustified in this later Suruey, are many, and those very materiall; the chiefe heads whereof, though they appeare aswell in the Titles ouer 
                  •…
               ch Page, as in the Table prepared of purpose to helpe the confusion of their Defence, yet I will summarily contract and annex to these presents, that your Princely wisdome may with more ease perceiue in euery of these things controuersed, what I defend; and censure the same, when it hath pleased your Highnesse at your leasure to view the particular parts and proofs, as it seemeth best to your learned and religious iudgement. My only desire, and humble petition to your most sacred Maiestic, as becommeth a Christian Bishop, is, That in the foundations of our faith, I meane the worke and meane of our Redemption and Reconciliation to God by Iesus Christ, men be not suffered, vnder your godly gouernment, to preach or publish their vnwritten fansies, and by their continuall Synecdoches, which are manifest additions to the Word of God, to alter and inuert the Trueth, so plainly, fully, and frequently deliuered by the Apostles of Christ in the sacred Scriptures: lest if they get this liberty, with vnnecessary figures where they list to interlace the Word of God in these maine points of Saluation, they leaue neither doctrine nor discipline sound in the end.
            And as in the first question they adde to Christes sufferings the death of the soule and of the damned, though there be no such thing warranted or witnessed in the Scriptures; so in the second they outface Christes Descent to Hell with phrases and figures, when it is plainly professed in the Creed, (where not phrases of speech, but Articles of faith are deliuered) and expressed in the Scriptures, That Christes soule was not left (or forsaken) in hell; and that very place alleaged by Peter, as properly pertaining to Christ, and no way common to him with Dauid, who being a Prophet, knew that God had sworne with an oath to raise vp Christ, to set him vpon his Throne, & to make him Lord (of all)

               and Christ, that is, the anointed Sauiour of his people from Sinne, Death, and Hell. And though all the Fathers Greeke and Latine from the Apostles times, haue receiued, beleeued, and deliuered that to be the sense of Peters words; as likewise of Pauls: That Christ, who ascended on high, descended first to the lower parts of the earth; yet they sticke neither at Scriptures, Creeds, nor Fathers, but wrench and wrangle with them all, subiecting euery thing to their sleights and shifts, that they may raigne as they will in the Word of God. Where likewise they shame not to condemne all the Fathers Greeke and Latine, as conspiring against the Trueth, and peruerting the Scriptures, by altering the authentike vse of words; for which they appeale to Plato and prophane Poets. This the Treatiser blusheth not to write: This Iaffirme; It is only the Fathers abusiue

                     •…
                  rrour of Christes descending into Hell; their vnapt and perilous translating it into Latine, Inferi; and our naughtie and corrupt translating in English, Hell, hath confirmed the same. And note heere this first; It is a thing too rife with the Fathers, yea with some of the ancientest of them, to alter and change the authentike vse of words, whereby consequently it is easie for errours and grosse mistakings to creepe in. This lowd and lewd Proclamation he maketh against all Christian Writers, Greeke, Latine, and English, since the first foundation of the Church, and yet therein erreth most absurdly and shamefully. For the Greeke Fathers vse the word Hades, as the Apostles and Euangelists did; for the place where torments after this life are prepared for the wicked; and the prophane Graecians (one conceit of Socrates excepted) did alwayes take it for a place of darkenesse vnder the earth, whither they thought good and bad descended; the wicked to punishment, the better sort to such delights, as carnall men dreampt of after death in their Elysian fields. In both these questions I haue not spared (most religious Prince) aswell to examine the Scriptures with all diligence, as to shew the confession and resolution of Christs Church long before our times, that all the world may see, I maintaine none other grounds of Faith, nor sense of Scripture, than haue beene anciently, constantly and continually professed, and beleeued in the Church of Christ for these

fifteene hundred yeeres, till this our present Age; and the same allowed and ratified by the publike lawes of this Realme, which your Maiestie in your most Princely wisdome and courage professe to vpholde and continue.
            God for his holy Names sake blesse your most sacred Maiestie, and prosper all your vertuous and Christian cares, that as in learning and wisdome, in clemencie and pietie, he hath made you the Mirrour of this Age; so in peace and prosperitie, in concord and vnitie, in all happinesse and felicitie, he may exalt you aboue all your neighbour Princes; and hauing vnited the two Realmes of England and Scotland in one subiection vnder your Princely right and regiment, he will knit the hearts and hands of both to honour and serue you, loue and obey you, and your royall issue after you, to the worlds end.

            THE CHIEFE RESOLVTIONS OF THIS Suruey.
            THe cleerenes and fulnes of the Scriptures in the worke of our Redemption is exactly to be reuerenced; so as no man ought to teach or beleeue any thing touching our redemption by Christ, which is not expresly witnessed in the sacred Scriptures: much lesse may we distrust the manifest words of the holy Ghost to be impertinent or vnsufficient in declaring the true price and meane of our redemption.
            The maine ground of the Gospell, which the Apostles preached, the faithfull receiued, wherein they continued, and whereby they were saued, was this; That Christ died for our sinnes according to the Scriptures, and was buried, and rose the third day; according to the Scriptures. Since then we are reconciled to God by the death of his Sonne, we must acknowledge none other death of Christ then that which he suffered in the bodie of his flesh, after which he was buried, and from which he rose the third day, which death the Scriptures most apparently describe to be the death of Christs bodie.
            If we were redeemed by the bloud of Christ, and God proposed him (to be) a Reconciliation through faith in his bloud, which was shed for the remission of sinnes; we may not presume to appoint a new price of our redemption, or new meane of our reconciliation; since by the bloud of his crosse Christ hath pacified both the things in earth, and things in heauen; and the bloud of Iesus Christ cleanseth vs from all sinne.
            
            The Scriptures doe no where teach, nor mention the death of Christs Joule, or the death of the damned, which is the second death, to be needfull for our redemption. We must not therefore intrude our selues into Gods seat to ord
                  •…
               ne a new course for mans redemption.
            If the Spirit doe quicken, and the iust liue by faith, and he that abideth in loue, abideth in God, who is life; it was vtterlie impossible, but the soule of Christ in that abundance of Spirit, euidence of Faith, assurance of Hope, and perfection of Loue, which he alwayes retained, should alwayes liue to God.
            Life and death being opposed as priuatiues, and so not to be found in one and the same subiect at one and the same time; the soule of Christ alwayes liuing, could neuer be dead. Neither could a dead soule be pleasing to God, (who is whole life, and therefore hateth death as contrarie to his nature;) when yet he was alwayes well pleased with Christ.
            Where some imagine extreame paine in Christs soule may be called the death of his soule; that position is repugnant to the Scriptures: for the greater the paine which the soule feeleth, and endureth with innocencie, confidence, obedience, and patience, (such as were all Christes sufferings) the more the soule liueth and cleaueth to God, for whose glorie it suffereth so much smart; as appeareth in Martyrs, whose soules do most liue in their greatest torments.
            
            The late deuice of hell-paines in Christes passion is not only false, but also superfluous: for the true paines of hell neither are, nor can be suffered in this life, where, by Gods ordinance extreame paine driueth the soule from the bodie: much lesse can man or Angell endure them with obedience and patience, as Christ did all his paines. And what need was there of hell-paines in the crosse of Christ, since God can by euery meanes, or without meanes raise more paines in bodie or soule, than any creature can endure.
            Christs soule could not be strooken with any horrour of Gods displeasure against him, since in his greatest anguish he professed God to be his God, and his Father, and by prayer preuailed for his persecutors (as appeared after by their conuersion) and gaue eternall life to the soule of the Thiefe hanging by him, and beleeuing on him. Now to giue life is more than to haue life; and restore others to fauour he can not, that himselfe is in displeasure.
            Hell-fire, which the damned and diuels do and shall suffer, is a true and eternall fire prepared by the mightie hand of God to punish aswell spirits as bodies; and this errour, That the fire of hell was only an internall or spirituall fire in the soules and consciences of men, was long since condemned in Origen by the Church of Christ.
            Reiection therefore, desperation, confusion, horrour of damnation, externall and eternall fire, which are the torments of the damned, and true paines of hell, can not without blasphemie be ascribed to Christ. Christ therefore suffered neither the death of the soule, nor the paines nor horrors os the damned, or of hell.
            Euery sinne is common to the whole man, who is defiled euen with thoughts that be euill; not only because the bodie is the Seat, wherein, and the instrument, whereby the soule worketh; but also for that the first infection of sinne commeth to the soule by the bodie, and the first information and prouocation to sinne riseth from the senses and affections, which are mooued with corporall spirits; and all the parts and powers of the bodie attend the will with most readie subiection to haue each sinne (which the soule conceiueth) impressed on them, and executed by them. And therefore the suffering for sinne in the person of the Mediatour, must be common both to bodie and soule in such sort, that as in transgressing, our soules are the principall Agents, so in the suffering for sinne, his soule was the principall Patient.
            Christ would vse no power to assuage the force and violence of his paines, (though he wanted none, as appeareth by his ouerthrowing them with a word, that came to apprehend him;) but submitted himselfe to his Fathers will with greater obedience and patience, than any man liuing could. We may therefore safely beleeue, That the iustice of God condemning sinne in (Christes) flesh, proportioned the paines of his bodie, in which hee bare our sinnes, to the strength of his patience; and so both his paines and his patience farre exceeded all mens. The rather for that Christes sense did not faile him by degrees, as ours doth, when the paines of death are extreamest, which driue our soules from our bodies; but hee did in most perfect sense feele the sting and bitternesse of paine to the last breath; by reason he was of his owne accord, at an instant appointed by his Father, to breathe out his owne soule, and so did, to the great admiration of the Centurion that obserued it; and consequently hee retained

firmnesse of voice, and exactnesse of sense, all the while his paines were at sharpest.
            The soule is punished in this life by her vnderstanding, will, affections, and senses, according as their obiects, directed and strengthened by God, make violent and vehement impressions; the torment of hell-fire being the iudgement of another world. Neither is God the tormenter of soules in hell with his immediate hand, but by his wisdome and power hath ordained euerlasting fire, as an externall Agent aboue nature, to take vengeance of damned men and diuels according to their deserts.
            No Scripture doth teach, That God with his immediate hand tormented the soule of his Sonne on the Crosse, or in the Garden; notwithstanding Christes soule was full of feare and sorow in the Garden, and of griefe and paine on the Crosse: all which outward and inward passions ne did, ne could peruert Christs will, nor oppresse his power; but they must all be voluntarie, that they might all be meritorious; and the more Christs power was to admit them, when he would, as he would, and because he would; the more his obedience was to the will and hand of God, who forced nothing on Christ against his will, but by that which was offered and suffered, tried the obedience of his Sonne, and accepted all from him as a most willing Sacrifice.
            The wrath of God punishing our sinnes in the person of Christ, was neither such as the Damned in hell, nor as the Reprobate in earth doe suffer; but rather common to the members of Christ, who must drinke of this Cuppe, haue fellowship with his afflictions, and be conformed to his death, though they neuer feele the true paines of hell, nor haue their soules tormented by Gods immediate hand. Neither was it any other wrath, than such as might stand with Gods loue towards his Sonne, (who did not hate him for our sakes, but loued vs for his) and was Fatherly tempered to the strength of Christes manhood, and graciously ouerruled and quenched by the fauour that God bare to the person of his Sonne. And therefore the termes of meere and proper wrath (if they meane proper to the damned) are false and impious in Christes sufferings, which neither in maner, measure, nor purpose, did agree with the torments of the damned.
            The true and full satisfaction for our sinnes, must not be deriued from the singularitie and infinitie of Christes paines, longer and greater than which the damned and diuels doe euery one suffer; but from the dignitie of the person, who being the only and eternall Sonne of God that made vs, humbled himselfe in our stead, and in our nature to restore vs, and offered recompense for our sinnes, which was his submission and obedience vnto the death of the Crosse, more pleasing to God than our condemnation to hell could haue beene: for in this ballance betweene the wrath of God against our sinnes, and the loue of God towards his Sonne, neither was his iustice neglected, nor his loue ouer swayed; but a sweet and wise temper of both was prouided for the manhood of his Sonne, first to suffer with patience, and then to raigne with glorie; that all the sonnes of God might be the more willing and readie by his example to obey the will, and abide the hand of God, before they did enter into his Kingdome.
            The Scriptures witnessing, that the Sacrifices of God are a troubled spirit, this might not want in Christes Sacrifice for sinne; but he approching the presence

of God with and for our offences, lawfully might, and exceedingly did feare the greatnesse and iustnesse of Gods anger against our iniquities; and as deeply sorrowed, that Gods holinesse was so carelesly despised, and highly displeased with our manifolde iniquities. Which inward sacrifices of feare and sorrow for vs, and our sinnes, in the person of the Mediatour, were no lesse acceptable to God than the simple suffering of paine.
            Since Gods power is despised, where it is not duely feared, and sinne is iustified, where the displeasing of God is not thorowly sorrowed; in presenting vs and our cause to God, Christ was to yeeld for vs, and in our behalfe that infinite submission and feare to the power of God prouoked, and contrition and sorrow to the holinesse of God offended, which we could neuer haue done. And without these to offer to beare the burden of our sinnes, was to make light account of our sinne against God, and of Gods wrath against our sinne, which was farre from the Sonne of God.
            There might therefore in Christes sacrifice for sinne not without iust cause appeare exceeding feare and sorrow, yet both religious, and measured by the rules of obedience and humilitie, though passing grieuous to the soule of Christ. Neither were these submissions and afflictions of Christs soule answerable to his perfection, and our transgression, if they did not reach to the highest degree of feare and sorrow, that mans nature in Christ was capable of, without distrust of Gods fauour, or dislike of his iustice.
            Christ did not pray in the Garden contrarie to his Fathers knowen will, but made an expresse and speciall reseruation thereof euen in the first part of his prayer. Neither was he amazed and confounded in all the powers of his soule and senses of his bodie, as these Presumers teach, but he prayed with faith, and suffered with obedience; both which require perfect vnderstanding, will, and memorie.
            
            Manie things might concurre to increase Christes sorrow in the Garden, as the reiection of the Iewes for spilling his bloud, the dispersion of his Church, all flying and forsaking him; the continuall rage of Satan against his weake and fearefull members; Christ now in his temptations and afflictions beholding theirs with great compassion and griefe of heart: which is it that Hilarie saith; Et tristitia de nobis est, & oratio pro nobis est. Christ sorrowed for vs, andDe Trinitate li. 10. prayed for vs.
            
            An Agonie is properly a vehement contention of minde to preuaile in that we vndertake, rightly weighing and striuing to remoue the difficulties and impediments obiected to hinder the euent.
            Christes bloudie sweat, if it were naturall, must proceed rather from zeale and intention of minde, than from feare and sorow; which coole the bloud, and quench the spirits; whereas the spirits must be mightilie kindled, and the bloud much heated and thinned, before it can issue forth by sweat. And since by the words of Saint Luke, Christ fell into an Agonie after an Angell appeared from heauen, and comforted or strengthened him (with a message from God) it seemeth rather an effect of Christes intentiue prayer which the Scripture there mentioneth; than a consequent to any other passion or paine.
            Christes intentiue prayer, after comfort receiued by an Angell from heauen, might proceed from his ardent desire, care, and zeale of our redemption from

the wrath of God, and protection from the rage of Satan. And therefore, as the Prophet foreshewed he should not onely beare the sinnes of many, but pray for the Trespassers, Christ might spend all the spirits and powers of bodie and soule in most vehement and feruent prayer, euen vnto a bloudie sweat, to haue all his members pardoned their sinnes, and reconciled to God by the sacrifice of his bodie, which he would offer for them; and also to haue Satan cast out from accusing them, and in the end trodden vnder their feet.
            If Christes bloudie sweat were supernaturall; we must aske no cause thereof, but leaue it to his sacred will, who could aboue nature doe what he would. That it was no proofe of hell paines, appeareth plainly, because Christ after in greater paines on the Crosse did not sweat bloud; and of all those, whom these men imagine suffered hell paines in the Scriptures, no one can be produced, that euer sweat bloud.
            The word (forsaking) vsed by Christ in his Complaint on the Crosse, doth not in all the Scriptures inferre the paines of the damned; but in the wicked it noteth reiection, desperation, and feare of damnation; and in the godly it argueth want of protection, or decrease of consolation in their troubles. In Christ it might shew the time, the cause, the maner, or the griefe of his being so long forsaken, and left to the rage and reproch of his persecutors, without any sensible signe of Gods loue towards him, care for him, helpe in his troubles, or exse in his paines; but it doth not prooue, that Christ thought himselfe forsaken of Gods fauour, grace, or spirit; which feare or doubt could not be in him without a manifest touch of error, and want of faith.
            Christ neuer feared nor doubted, that he should or could perish vnder the hand of God persuing our sinnes in the bodie of his flesh; but for the ioy set before him, endured the Crosse, and despised the shame; and as S. Peter sayth of him at the time of his suffering, he alwayes beheld God at his right hand, that he should not be shaken; and therefore his heart reioyced, and his tongue was glad, and his flesh rested in hope, because his soule should not be forsaken in hell, nor his flesh see corruption.
            
            Christ was made a curse for vs, in that he suffered the temporall and corporall curses of the Law threatned vnto sinners, as all sorts of afflictions belonging to this life, and in the end, a painfull and shamefull death, by which he abolished the spirituall and eternall curse of God due to vs for sinne; but he was neuer inwardly, truely, nor eternally accursed of God, since by tasting of our externall curse for a time, he made vs partakers of his spirituall and celestiall blessednesse for euer.
            Christ who knew no sinne, was made sinne for vs, that is, either the punishment of, our sinnes, or the sacrifice for our sinnes: for we were healed by his stripes, and he gaue himselfe for vs a sacrifice of a sweet smell to God. Being then an holy and acceptable sacrifice to God for sinne, he was neither defiled nor hatefull to God with our sinnes: but suffered, the iust for the vniust; that is, he tooke vpon him the punishment of our sinnes, though he were most innocent; and by the holinesse of his person, submitting himselfe to the death of the crosse, purged our vncleannesse; by his innocencie, couered our guiltinesse; and by his fauour with God, reconciled vs that were enemies.
            Christ bare the full punishment of our sinnes; that is, not all which we should

haue borne; for then he must haue beene euer lastingly reiected, confounded and condemned to hell fire, which are most horrible blasphemies; but he bare so much of the punishments of this life, where he suffered, as in his person by the iust iudgement of God was most sufficient for all our sinnes.
            TOuching Christs descent to hell, the words are plainly cited by Peter out of Dauid, that Christes soule (after death) should not be left in Hades, which Saint Luke in his Gospell vseth for the place where torments are prepared for the wicked after this life. And in that sense is the word vsed thorowout the New Testament; as likewise the Greeke Fathers tooke it for the place vnder the earth, whither the soules of all men were condemned for sinne, and where the Diuels detaine and torment the wicked. That Christ likewise descended to the lower parts of the earth, and to the (bottomlesse) deepe after death, is vouched by Saint Paul; whereupon the whole Church of Christ from the beginning hath confessed his descent to hel to be a point of Christian pietie.
            Peters Sermon (in the second of the Acts) intended not simply to proue that Christ was risen from the dead, as Lazarus and others were; but affirmed farder of him, That God raised him vp, to set him on Dauids Throne; that is, to make him King of Glorie. This he prooueth, In that Christes flesh could not see corruption, nor his soule be forsaken in hell; which was verified in none, no not in Dauid (who were all dead, and saw corruption) but only in the Messias. It was therefore impossible, that either death or hell should detaine Christ, but he was to rise Lord of death and hell, and the Sauiour of all his from both; as appeared by his ascending to heauen, and sitting at the right hand of God. Neither was this strange to the Iewes, who were taught to expect that to be performed by the Messias, which God promised by his Prophet; O Death, I will be thy death: O Hell, I will be thy destruction.
            
            
               Sheol in the Olde Testament signifieth the Graue, and Hell; that is, the places whither the dead bodies of all men went, and whither the soules of the wicked dead in sinne descended after death. And therefore where it is distinguished from the death of the bodie, or referred to the soule after death, as it is in Dauids words applied by Peter to Christ, it apparently signifieth Hell.
            The ends of Christes descent are likewise deriued from the Scriptures, as the destroying of the Diuels kingdome, and triumphing ouer powers and principalities, and making an open shew of them, spoiling them by deliuering all his Elect, dead, liuing, and yet vnborne, from the right, power, and feare of eternall death; taking into his hands the Keyes of Death and Hell, that he might be Lord of all, in Heauen, Earth, and Hell.
            
            The Creed is not a Collection of Greeke or Hebrew phrases vnknowen to the people, but a short summe of the Christian faith prouided for the simpler sort of men to learne by heart. And therefore, as nothing is superfluously repeated, so nothing is obscurely couered in it. And though this Article, He descended to

hell, wanted for a time in some Churches, euen as some part of Scripture did, yet was it retained by all Christian Writers, as a ground of true religion from the Apostles time; and professed in some Churches very anciently in their Creed, and at last generally receiued in all places.
            All the Fathers of Christes Church with one consent teach this as a point of the Christian faith, That Christ after death descended to hell; insomuch that Austen resolutely sayth, Who but an Infidell will denie, that Christ was inEpistola. 99. hell?
            
            Where Abrahams bosome was, neither was, nor is agreed amongst the learned: only Austen rightly inferreth out of Christes words, That being a place of comfort, and farre off aboue Hades (where the rich man was tormented) with a great Gulfe setled betwixt those two places, it could be no part, norEpistola. 99. member of hell.

            THE SVRVEY OF CHRISTES SVFFERINGS FOR MANS REDEMPTION.
            IT may seeme somewhat strange to thee (Christian Reader) as it doth likewise to me, that one and the selfe same cause, being twice now debated and discussed in writing on either side; we should at the last be farther from agreeing on the true state of the controuersie than we were at the first entring into the matter. If the fault be either in the doubtfulnesse of my words proposing it; or in the diuersnesse of my mind defending it; I refuse no reproch of follie, and inconstancie; but if I keeping close to the points which I first propounded, and calling vpon the aduerse part, with as great vehemencie and importunitie as I could, to goe directly to the issue, and no way to digresse from the things in question; the Impugner trusting more to the couert of his words, than to the soundnesse of his proofs, will of purpose shunne the marke prefixed, and roue at pleasure with doubtfull and deceitfull termes, to hide the nakednesse of his side, and to make the Reader beleeue he hath matter of moment, when indeed he doth not so much as vnderstand himselfe, or take any knowledge of the chiefest things which I obiect or alledge; then is he woorthie to beare the blame who best deserueth it, and thou (Christian Reader) mayest soone perceiue, and assoone pronounce both for thine owne ease, and for an end to be had in this strife; (for to thee the Confuter referreth himselfe, and so doe I) whether of vs flieth the touchstone of trueth, and faileth in the due proofe of his doctrine, as neere as God shall giue thee wisdome to discerne light from darknesse, and grace to preferre trueth before falshood.
            In the Preface of my Sermons published, I much misliked, and openly charged the ouer hastie Discourser, that called himselfe H. I. for Praefat pag. 9. lin. 2.

               It was too much boldnesse to outface the world in print, that this was the position which I impugned. There were too many witnesses there, for me to denie, or for him to belie the Question, he knew it well enough, but he could not tell how to proue that which I then reproued, and therefore he shranke from it, and dallied with generall and doubtfull termes. And lest either the patient Reader, or strict Examiner, should be forced farre to seeke for the chiefe points by me denied or affirmed in those Sermons; I purposely and plainly numbred and deliuered them in such sort, as none could mistake them, but he that would wilfully ouerleape them. My words thou wilt pardon me to repeat (good Christian Reader) that thereby thou mayest see whether I alter or new frame my first questions and resolutions, as this Prater

pretendeth, by his euery where complaining of my manifolde ambiguities, fallacies, and contr

                  rieties; or he rather dissembleth the weaknesse, and couereth the badnesse of his cause vnder certeine perplexed and confused phrases, as anon thou shalt heare more at large. These are my words in the foresayd Pag. 2. l. 10. Preface.
            
               I laboured (in these my Sermons) to prooue these foure points: First, That it was no where recorded in holy Scriptures, nor iustly to be concluded by the Scriptures, that Christ suffered the true paines of Hell. Secondly, That as the Scriptures describe to vs the paines of the Damned and of hell; there are manie terrors and torments, which without euident impietie can not be ascribed to the Sonne of God. Thirdly, That the death and bloud of Christ Iesus were euidently, frequently, constantly set downe in the writings of the Apostles, as the sufficient price of our Redemption, and true meane of our Reconciliation to God, and the verie same proposed in the figures resembled in the sacrifices of the Law, and sealed with the Sacraments of the New testament, as the verie ground-worke of our saluation by Christ; and so haue beene receiued, and beleeued in the Church of God, foureteene hundred yeeres, before any man euer made mention of hell-paines to be suffered in the soule of Christ. Lastly, where the Scriptures are plaine and pregnant, That Christ died for our sinnes, and by his death destroyed him that had power of death, euen the diuell, and reconciled vs when we were strangers and enemies in the body of his flesh through death: besides, That the Holie ghost in these places by expresse words nameth the bodily death of Christ, as the meane of our Redemption & Reconciliation to God; no considerate Diuine might affirme or imagine Christ suffered the death of the soule; for somuch as the death of the soule must exclude Christ from the grace, spirit, and life of God, and leaue in him neither faith, hope, nor loue, sanctitie, nor innocencie, which God forbid any Christian man should so much as dreame. And if any man to mainteine his deuice, would inuent a new hell, and another death of the soule, then either Scriptures or Fathers euer heard, or spake of, they should keepe their inuentions to themselues: it sufficed me to beleeue what I read, and consequently, not to beleeue what I did not reade in the Word of God, which is and ought to be the foundation of our faith. Whether there be any darkenesse or doubling in my speech, I leaue it to thy censure, good Christian Reader. I affirme touching our redemption and reconciliation to God, what the Scriptures affirme, and as neere as I could in the selfe-same words: I denied the late additions of some men in matters of so great weight, which the Scriptures by their perpetuall silence denie, and by their open and euident consequents disprooue and impugne. If any man thinke my Sermons in these points lesse euident, or pertinent to the purpose than my Preface; let him looke to the places where these things are hand
                  •…
               ed, and iudge in Gods name, as he findeth cause; remembring that he which withstandeth or neglecteth the trueth, withstandeth and neglecteth his owne saluation.
            First that no Scripture doth witnesse or warrant Christs suffering the true paines of hell in his soule; see either the Sermons. p. 8. lin. 22. proposing of their opinions that so thinke; or the examining of their Serm. p. 11. l. 24. proofes which are brought for that conceit; or the shutting vp of that part, which sheweth the summe of all aforesayd, which I close in this wise: Serm. pa. 41. l. 14. 
               Then are there in the sacred Scriptures neither any praedictions that Christ should suffer the paines of hell in his soule heere on earth; nor causes why he must suffer them; nor signes that he did suffer them; and consequently, what soeuer is pretended, no proofe, that these sufferings must be added to the Crosse of Christ, before the worke of our saluation can be perfect. Secondly, that such paines of hell, as the Scriptures expresse and auouch, may not be applied to Christ, without apparent impietie, reade what I Serm. pa. 48. l. 34. write concerning the particulars, and settle thy iudgement (gentle Reader) as thou likest best. I desire not to preuaile, where I bring not sufficient proofe: emptie words on either side, are slender meanes to quiet thy conscience, or settle thy faith, if thou seeke to be religious. Thirdly, where the whole course and tenor of the sacred Scriptures do plainly and fully ascribe our Redemption and the remission of our sinnes to the death and bloud of Christ Iesus; I dare not delude the words of the Holy ghost, as if they were euery where improper or imperfect, but by the foure first Serm p. 42. l. 2. effects of Christs crosse, I

make it appeare how sufficient our saluation is by the bloud of Christ, without anie supplie of hell paines to be suffered in the soule of Christ. Lastly, since no Christian man may doubt, but we are redeemed and saued by the death of Christ, how Serm. p. 73. li. 13. farre it is from all sense and shew of holy Scripture to subiect Christ to the death of the soule, and how repugnant to the mouthes and mindes of the ancient and catholike fathers, I insert a speciall discourse, and thence obserue, that where & whensoeuer the Holie ghost speaketh of the death of Christ, he meaneth the death of Christs body suffered on the altar of the Crosse, and by no meanes the death of Christs soule.
            These things being thus sensibly and plainly set downe to the view and reach of all men, were they neuer so simple, if they were Christians; what reason had you, Sir Refuter in your Treatise to slide from all this, and to delude your Reader by telling him that the whole controuersie had in it two points:
            
            
               1 That Christ suffered for vs the wrath of God:
               2 That after his death on the Crosse, he went not into hell in his soule:
            
            as if I proposed or proued nothing in the first part of my Sermons, but that Christ did not suffer for vs the wrath of God? did I, or could I make or mooue anie such question, that in preci

               wrath of God against our sinnes was verie great in the Crosse of Christ? did I not in plaine termes ascribe to Christ Ibidem. li. 30.

               serious contemplation of that eternall and intolerable v
                     •…
                  ngeance, which the Iustice of God had in store for vs, by reason of our manifolde sinnes, whose danger and destruction touched him as neere, through the tendernesse of his loue and pitie, as if it had beene imminent ouer his owne head? But this you will say is not the wrath which you meane. Sir whatsoeuer your meaning be, which is scant knowen to your selfe, as anon we shal better perceiue, the words of your Treatise setting the very question, to which your Reader must looke, ouerlashed with two palpable vntrueths, vnfit for a man of that care and conscience which you would seeme to haue. For first this could be no question with me, whether Christ suffered for vs the wrath of God, who exactly affirmed that Gods wrath was great in the Crosse of Christ, and admitted in the soule of Christ a sight and sense of Gods temporall wrath inflicted on his bodie, and of Gods eternall wrath prepared for our sinnes. Againe, had I moued that question, which I neuer meant, doth the first part of the controuersie containe no more but Whether Christ suffered the wrath of God or no? are your hell paines so soone vanished into smoake? is the death of Christs soule no question with you? whether the death of Christs bodie, and the shedding of his bloud be the full price of our Redemption, and cause of our reconciliation to God, is it not worth the asking, nor worth the answering? but you ranne from the rest not able to iustifie that which I disproued; and then, as your maner is, you catch a large and licentious word, and currie that till you confound both your selfe and your Reader. For who but you would haue proposed such a question, Whether Christ suffered for vs the wrath of God, knowing that in the Scriptures themselues, according to which we must frame our speech in matters of faith, there are many degrees and differences of Gods wrath, whereof some may be attributed to Christs sufferings without offence; others can not without plaine impietie? and therefore the question which you proposed in your Treatise was but a very stale to make your Reader gaze at, whiles you shifted aside from the matter which I moued.
            [The one (you will say) is a proofe of the other; for he which suffereth Gods wrath, must needs suffer the paines of hell.] That was and must be the whole strength of your Treatise, vnlesse you will confesse that you meant to waste your paper, and mocke your Reader with a number of emptie and idle fansies. But how faint and feeble that foundation was to beare so great a building, the fo. 243. conclusion of my Sermons doth sufficiently shew. In which I tolde you, that either your argument must be vitious, if your antecedent were particular; or if to make your argument good, you enlarged

your antecedent to be generall, your first proposition would be both iniurious and blasphemous. For though Christ might and did suffer some parts of Gods wrath, as the Scripture vseth that word, which is all that your indefinite proposition will implie; yet it would no way follow that he therefore suffered the paines of hell. And if, to amend your consequent, you did affirme that Christ suffered the whole wrath of God, and euery part thereof, and so by consequent the paines of hell also; the forme of your argument was bettered, but your antecedent, on which the conclusion must depend, was a most false and wicked assertion: for then must Christ haue suffered reprobation, desperation, eternall damnation, and what not. Whether this exception were sound and good, I leaue to the iudgement of the Reader; verily, I haue either forgotten the first principles of Logicke; or els it was a full and plaine subuersion of your misshaped reason.
            But you now amend the matter in your last defence, and where your chiefe positionTheir foure restraints of hell paines. was before indefinite, Christ suffered for vs the wratb of God; and so did neither good nor harme to the maine question of Christs suffering the paines of hell; vpon better aduice, you make it generall and say; Christ suffered all Gods wrath, but with foure restraints to saue your opinion from apparent falsitie and heresie. For first you adde, Defence p. 7. l. 32. 
               all Gods PROPER wrath; next, if it be a punishment for sinne, and no sinne; thirdly, as touching the essence and nature thereof; fourthly, so farre as was due generally for all mankinde to suffer. But Sir Defender, this is not to maintaine your first argument, but to confesse, and recant your former follie, when you see your position impugned as friuolous and childish, if it be particular; or as erroneous and impious, if it be generall; to come in with foure fresh limitations in a new pamphlet before you can saue your generall assertion from sensible impietie and infidelitie. Howbeit take your fourth, to returne to trueth is neuer too late: Let your generall proposition stand fettered & restrained with these foure brakes: I must aske you now, not onely how you proue this generall Collection, Christ suffered for vs all Gods wrath in the same nature and maner that we should haue suffered it, sauing your foure exceptions; but also, what parts of Gods wrath you leaue inclosed in your generall affirmatiue, when all these are excluded. Which two demands I wish thee (good Reader) to haue in speciall remembrance against we come to debate the Defenders question, that thou mayest see both what cause leadeth him so to collect, and what trueth is in the generall, when these particulars are excepted.
            That Christ tooke our infimities and bare our sorrowes is confirmed by the Prophet Esaie, and alleaged and expounded as well by Saint Mathew in his Gospell, as by Saint Peter in his first Epistle; in either of which senses we may safely graunt the meaning of the Prophet to be generall, though his words haue no speciall adscription of all, or some. Saint Mathew declaring how Christ cured with his very word such as were possessed by diuels, and healed all that were sicke, affirmeth that to be Math. 8. vers. 17. fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the Prophet, he tooke our infirmities and bare our sicknesses, meaning he tooke from vs our infirmities and recouered our diseases. And in this sense the generall is most true, that Christ tooke away all our infirmities, and recouered all our sicknesses, were they corporall or spirituall, temporall or eternall, that we should feele the full burden of none of them. Neither did our Sauiour only take our sorrows from vs, but he also tooke them vpon himselfe, which Peter obserueth when he saith (Christ) 1. Pet 2. 
               himselfe bare our sinnes (that is, the burden and punishment of our sinnes) in his body on the tree. And in this sense likewise, it is very true that Christ bare the burden of all our sinnes without exception, but not all, and the selfe same burdens of our sinnes which we should haue borne. For he that so enlargeth Saint Peters words, which this Discourser so much laboureth, extendeth them to reprobation, pollution, desperation, damnation, and to all the punishments prepared for the wicked in this life and the next, which is the depth and height of all impiety. I wish the Defender therefore to get him some better ground to erect his frame vpon, he will else prooue himselfe an euill Disputer, and a woorse beleeuer. Saint Paule hath a third sense gathered

out of this place, when he saith, Heb. 4. 
               We haue not an high Priest that can not be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in ALL THINGS (tried or) tempted in like sort, ‖yet‖ without sinne. That Christ was tried and pressed with all our infirmities may hence be collected, but with these two additions like to his brethren, and still WITHOVT SINNE. for he must be like (not to the reprobate, much lesse to the damned, but) to his 
               Heb. 2. 
               brethren in all things, that is by partaking as well flesh and blood with them, as sufferings and tentations like them, yet alwaies without sinne. Then as the godly neither doe nor can suffer the true paines of hell in this life, which are the iudgements and torments of the damned in another world; no more did Christ suffer them in this life. And where conscience of sinne, ignorance of Gods counsaile, and weakenesse of faith sometimes draw the godly to doubt of Gods fauour, and affright them with the horror of hell; from these, and all like inward tentations and motions of sinne, Christ must be most free, in whose soule was no lacke of grace, nor touch of sinne; but the fulnesse of Gods spirit, assured knowledge of Gods will, and perfection of all humane integritie and innocencie, besides the personall vnion and communion of his Godhead, which kept him both from doubting of Gods loue towards himselfe, and from fearing damnation as due to him or possible to be laide on him.
            [Your limitations you will say, serue to exclude those punishments which Christ neither did nor might suffer. For Christ suffered onely in this life, and but for a time, and without sinne; and yet suffered all, and the very same punishments so limited, as you limite them, which the damned doe, and those were the paines of hell.] If you begin (Sir Defender) to limite the words of the holy Ghost to your liking, I thinke it a safer and surer course to heare and receiue S. Peters and S. Pauls limitations annexed to their owne words, and other defence against all your attempts I desire none. Christ himselfe (saith Peter) bare our sinnes in his bodie on the tree. Heere see we not onely the person who, euen the sonne of God; and the place where, and time when; on the tree, not after; but also the part in which he bare the punishment of all our sinnes, to wit, in his body. He must (saith Paul) be like his brethren in all things; that is, infirmities, tentations, and sufferings, but still without sinne. What is this to the paines of hell, which are the destruction of bodie and soule excluded after this life from the ioy and blisse of Gods kingdome, and tormented among diuels with euerlasting fire?
            [That (you thinke) is my grosse imagination of hell, the fire there is a toyish fable; the greatest paine in hell is the sense of Gods fierie wrath, which he inflicteth with his immediate hand vpon the soule lyable to sinne without any meanes or instruments; the substance whereof because Christ suffered (as you say) for a time in this life, though not in hell nor for euer, he suffered the verie same paines of hell as touching the essence and nature thereof, which the damned doe; though in circumstances of time and place his sufferings somewhat differed from theirs.] Your quintessencing and new framing of another hell, which the Scriptures neuer speake of; your quenching hell-fire with a fansie; your appointing God to be the tormentor in hell with his immediate hand; your nice diuiding betweene the substance and circumstance of Gods eternall iudgements; your placing the substance thereof in the apprehension of the soule, and that as well in this life as in the next, with a number of like audacious and desperate deuises to vphold the name or the shade of hell-paines in the sufferings of Christ, wee shall anon discusse, when we come to your opening of the question; in the meane while the Reader must marke, The question is not whether Christ bare the burden of all our sinnes on the tree, or whether he were touched and tempted in all things like to his brethren, yet still without sinne, but whether it can be prooued by the Scriptures that Christ must beare all and the selfe same burdens of our sinnes which wee should haue borne in this life, and the next, and which the damned doe and shall beare. Your distinction of the substance and circumstance of Gods endlesse and mercilesse vengeance of sinne in hell, we shall quickly let the Reader see how vainely you presume it without

all warrant of holy Scripture, and how falsely you applie it to the person of Christ against the manifest Scripture, if first we obserue how handsomely you set downe the doctrine which I defend in the next words to your owne hieroglyphicall question, of purpose that if you cannot by trueth ouerbeare it, you may at least by falshood disgrace it.

               ed nothing else for our sinnes but simply and meerely a bodyly death altogether like as the godly often doe at the hands of persecutors. Had you said, I maintaine Christ suffered no death, but onely a bodily death, I would haue asked you by what Scriptures you or all your adherents can disproue it; but charging me as you doe with this opinion, that Christ suffered nothing else but simply and meerely a bodily death altogether like the godly; I must tell you this is one of your trueths, which many men will call a malitious leasing, since my wordes are publikely extant to the contrarie. My first resolution was; ChristSerm. p. 4. l. 4. saw before hand that going to his Crosse he should tast all kindes of calamities, and so it came to passe. For betweene his last Supper and his death, he was betrayed of Iudas, abiured of Peter, forsaken of all his followers; he was wrongfully imprisoned, falsly accused, uniustly condemned, he was buffe

him in the Garden. All this I affirme Christ suffered before his death, and therefore all this besides his meere bodily death; to which I addedSerm. p. 87. l. 23. all those afflictions and passions of the Soule, which naturally and necessarily follow paine and accompany death. You perchance would annex the paines of hell, and the death of the Soule, but those are the very points in question which I then did, and yet doe vtterly exclude from the sufferings of Christ.
            Where you say, I hold, Christs death was altogether like as the godly doe suffer at the hands of Persecutors, I know not what you meane by your altogether; in some things his death was like theirs, in many things vnlike. A wrongfull and painefull death of the body he suffered at the hands of the Iewes, as the godly doe often at the hands of their persecutors; and a full perswasion he alwaies had of Gods exceeding and assured loue and fauour towards him, in the middest of all his anguishes, as the godly haue in theirs, though in farre lesse perfection then his was; but as touching the cause, the manner, the force of his death, I make it altogether vnlike theirs. They inherite both sinne, and death, from their Parents, and so of necessity must die, and putrifie in the graue; he did inherite neither, but being free from both, yeelded himselfe to die, that he might purge and abolish sinne. Death wresteth our soules from our bodies, be we neuer so patient, whiles sence doth last; he breathed out his soule powerfully, and willingly, which none could take from him, except he would lay it downe of his owne accord. Our bodies doe rot in the graue, and lye in corruption, which is the dominion of death, till the time, they shall be restored; his body could not be dissolued to ashes, because neither part of his humane nature might perish, after it was once vnited to his Diuine; but lay in the graue without corruption resisting death, and rose with speede in glory ouerthrowing death, first in him selfe, and after in all his members at their appointed time. So that death is now a necessarie consequent to our sinfull nature, his voluntary death was the satisfaction for our sins, and pacification of Gods wrath, restoring vs againe to Gods fauour, which through sin we had lost. Thus haue you both swarued very far Sir Desender from your owne question, which your selfe put in your first Treatise though wide from our purpose, and wholy misreported the doctrine which I formerly auouched by Scriptures, and Fathers; giuing small hope you will deale more sincerely in the rest, that enter so corruptly at the first, but you will now open the whole state of the Question, which we are content to heare.

                the opening of the Question, I may better call the darkning and obscuring of the Question with many trifling and tedious obseruations, with many new found, farre fet, and ill applyed phrases, with many bold and false assertions powred out of your owne braines, without any shew or so much as pretence of holy Scripture. And if you may be suffered thus to raigne and reuele in matters of Religion at your pleasure; it is an easie way for you to conclude any thing without any great paines or proofes. For you bring vs a world of wordes warranted by no mans authoritie, but by your owne, and out of them you frame false positions fitte for your fancie, and vtter them as vndoubted principles of Christian Religion; which indeede haue in them neither truth, nor sence, when they come to be examined. As is your matter, so is your method, tumbling and tossing too and fro, like the vnsettlednesse of your head, and spending twentie pages in meere confusion and contradiction, for which cause I must be driuen to recall your conceits to some speciall heads, least in pursuing your steps I loose both my selfe and the Reader.
            The things which you disorderly shuffle, and I shall be forced more largely to handle, concerne either the offender, which is man, or the offence, which is sinne, or the Iudge, which is God; or the punishment which is death, or the ransommer and redeemer, which is Christ. I meane to meddle with no more in any of these, but what directly pertaineth to this question, and serueth aptly to exclude your conceits, and

truely to establish the collections which I make. First then, 1 touching MAN who  consisteth of body and soule, the doubt will be whether the whole man sinned in Adam, that the whole might suffer in Christ; or whether the soule onely sinned, that the soule of Christ onely must suffer. Secondly in 2 SINNE must be remembred how  it commeth, and what it bringeth. Sinne is either COMMITTED, as by Adam, or INHERITED, as by vs all; or ASSVMED, as by Christ, who tooke vpon him the punishment of our sinnes though neither committed nor inherited by him. And of it selfe sinne breedeth in the offendor, where it is not remitted, clensed, and remooued by the blood of Christ; POLLVTION of the whole man, STING of conscience, and REVENGE of Gods wrath in this life and the next. Thirdly, for the 3 IVDGE  which is God, we must learne, from what ground, within him the punishments of his elect in this life doe proceede, whether from his Iustice, or from his loue, or from both mixed together, by whom he executeth his iustice in earth and in hell, whether by his immediate hand, or by inferiour ministers and meanes, with what measure he proportioneth it, as well to the faithfull in this life, as to the faithlesse, till the number of their sinnes be full; and lastly, to what purpose he directeth it, either to reuenge sinne, as in the wicked and damned; or to represse sinne as in the godly, or to declare his iustice, as in Infants baptized; or to perfit his graces, as in the best of his Saints here on earth; or to purge and abolish sinne, and to prooue obedience as in the person of Christ Iesus. Fourthly, 4 DEATH which is the wages of sinne, and includeth all the punishments prouided here, and elsewhere for sinners, is either corporall parting the soule from the bodie; or spirituall separating the soule from the life, and grace of God; or eternall, excluding both bodie and soule, from the ioy, and blisse of Gods heauenly kingdome, and wrapping them both in the darkenesse, fire, and horrour of hell for euer. That all the paynes and griefes of this life, are the seedes of death, and wayes to death, and so come vnder the name of death, which driueth the soule from the bodie, is now presumed, and shall be prooued in place conuenient. Fiftly, concerning the 5 REDEEMER, which is Christ; to whose sufferings all that is aforesaid must in some  sort be referred, the question is, in what part, and how farre he suffered, feared, or apprehended the wrath of God against our sinnes: but without question we must know and beleeue that his person was naturally and infinitely beloued of God, (all the elect being imbraced and accepted onely for him, and in him) and that the dignitie of his person and depth of his fauour with God, (when hee submitted himselfe to shew his obedience, and maintaine Gods iustice, by the shame and sharpenesse of the Crosse, receiued in his humaine nature) was the right ground, and true cause of our Redemption and Reconciliation to God; whose patience vnto death was a greater and acceptabler sacrifice to God for sinne, then all the world; yea then all earthly and heauenly creatures were worth. And to increase or strengthen this voluntary sacrifice for sinne, the paines of hell were no way needfull since Christ was to shew his obedience in this life onely, and after death to rise and raigne with glory, and by that which he suffered on the Crosse, he was to learne the obedience of a Sonne, and not the vengeance due to deuils. In all these issues, if I would take the Discoursers trade, to affirme what I list, without any further proofe, I could end the whole cause in as fewe wordes as I haue expressed it; but since that will neither content the Reader, nor conclude the gaine-sayer, I must haue leaue in larger maner as occasion serueth, both to repell the Defenders bold presumptions, and to confirme those things which I take to be safer Resolutions in Christian Religion.
            The principall things which you would haue noted (Sir Discourser) are either defectiue in their diuisions, or coincident in their partes, or repugnant to your purpose.Defence p. 8. l. 6. 
               All suffering of paines in man (you say) is from God, either properly from his Iustice, or from his holy loue; either from himselfe alone, or also from his instruments and inferiour meanes: and that for sinne either inherent, or imputed; either as Correction or as punishment; either immediatly or mediatly as anon we shall further see. Not one of these foure partitions, which you make the fortresse of your cause, is sound and sufficient; and the

fift is the selfe-same with the second, it onely varieth in words. In these two diuisions (all suffering of paines in man is from Gods Iustice, or from his holy loue; either as correction or as punishment) you roue obscurely, but absurdly, at the ground, the measure, the purpose of all paines and punishments, as they come from God on all men, be they wicked or godly, Christ himselfe not excepted; either in this world, or the next. For the GROVND of them, you say they proceed from Gods iustice properly, or from his holy loue. The MEASVRE and PVRPOSE of them you confound in saying either as correction, or as punishment, which you should distinguish.
            
               From Gods iustice properly on men infected with sinne commeth nothing but punishment, that is their due, which the iust Iudge awardeth them. From Gods loue, of it selfe commeth nothing but grace and blisse; for which cause he is the fountaine of Grace, and father of Mercy to such as he loueth. In the reprobate God hateth their sinnes, and so their persons, being the committers or inheriters of sinne still abiding. In the elect, Gods holinesse disliketh their sinnes as much as the others; but their persons he loueth and fauoureth for Christ his sonne, in whom they are chosen. And though the full and due punishment of their sinne, which is spirituall and eternall death, be translated from them, and abolished in Christ; yet when men redeemed and freed from the heauie burden of their sinnes doe not earnestly repent them, or eftsoones frequent them, God for the conseruation of his holinesle, and demonstration of his righteous iudgement to all the world, doth sooner and sharper visit and punish with the corporall and temporall scourges of this life his owne children, neglecting or resuming their sinnes, than his enemies; whom with longer patience he suffereth to heape vp wrath against the day of wrath. AIames 2. ver. 13. 
               iudgement mercilesse therfore, as S. Iames calleth it, is and shall be to the wicked, whereas in the godly mercy reioyceth against iudgement, but not without iustice. For1. Pet. 4. 
               iudgement (which in God can neuer be without iustice, since he is the righteous Iudge of the world) must begin at the house of God,
               1. Cor. 11. 
               and when we are iudged, we are chastened, (with a mercifull iudgement) that we should not be condemned with the world. And though in the afflictions of the godly, there be many things added of fauour; as the measure, which is tolerable, not ouerwhelming their patience; the purpose which is holy, to recall them from the delight and custome of sinne, and to perfit the graces of God in them; the comfort which is great, that God loueth their persons, when he pursueth their sinnes; the promise which is sure, that if they suffer with Christ, they shall reigne with Christ, and such like; yet the smart of Gods rod, and sharpnesse of his whip, wherewith he awaketh the negligent, and tameth the vnruly, proceed from his iust iudgement, and commend his holinesse which hateth all sinne in whomsoeuer; and declare his iustice to the whole world, that he wincketh not either at the waiwardnesse, or at the carelesnesse of his owne children. The places in Scripture witnessing thus much are infinite, and easie for euery childe to obserue; and therefore one shall suffice for all. To his Church God sayth by the mouth of Ieremie,Ierem. 30. 
               Though I vtterly destroy all the Nations, where I haue scattred thee, yet will I not vtterly destroy thee; but I will correct thee by iudgement, and not vtterly cut thee off. I haue stricken thee with the wound of an enemie, and with a cruell chastisement for the multitude of thine iniquities, thy sinnes were increased. Thy sorrow is incurable for the number of thine offences, ‖because‖ thy sinnes were increased, I haue done these things vnto thee: ‖But‖ I will restore health to thee, and heale thee of thy wounds.
            
            
               Defen. p. 10. l. 29. [The godly in this world doe suffer paines for their sinnes; but these whatsoeuer they be, (yea though death it selfe) are improperly called punishments, they are chasticements of sinne.] This new Grammer doth best become your newe doctrine. All paines for sinnes whatsoeuer, suffered by any of the elect in this life, are chasticements, but in no wise you may indure to haue them called punishments, except very improperly. What is a chasticement properly, but a punishment moderated with loue and mercy? And since you be so precise that no paine suffered by any of Gods children may properly be called a punishment; whence I pray you is the word punishment deriued? not from the Latine word punire to punish? and punio from Poena, which our

English tongue resembling the Latine, calleth paine? so that paine and punishment are wordes of one deriuation, and so properly of one signification, and by force of the wordes properly, all paine for sinne is punishment for sinne. And therefore in all mens iudgements sauing yours, chasticement is a punishment tempered with fauor, and not a paine excluding all punishment as you make it in your dissolute diuision. Read either the text, or notes of the Geneuian Translation of the Bible, which you would seeme so much to follow; or whose translation you will, and see whether they doe not contradict your childish conceite, that the Chasticement of Gods children is no punishment. Psal. 106. 
               Moses was punished for their sakes; and againe, God 
               Lament. 3. 
               doth not punish with the hart; & the Wiseman speaking vnto God, Sapient. 12. 
               with how great circumspection (saith he) wilt thou punish thine owne children. And vpon those words of Ieremie, 
               Ierem. 10. 
               O Lord correct me, but with iudgement, not in thine anger; they of Geneua note, Ibid. lit. q. 
               He onely prayeth that God would PVNISH THEM with mercie, which Esay calleth in measure ca. 27. for here by iudgement is ment, not onely the PVNISHMENT, but also the MERCIFVLL MODERATION of the same. So that Chastisement noteth the measure of the punishment, which God fauourably inflicteth on his children, not according to their sinnes, nor exceding their strength. Psal. 103. 
               He hath not dealt with us (saith Dauid) after our sinnes, nor rewarded vs according to our iniquities. 
               1. Cor. 10. 
               There hath no tentation taken you (saith Paul) but such as belongeth to men; and God is faithfull which will not suffer you to be tempted, aboue that you be able, but will giue the issue with the tentation, that you may be able to beare it. Yea, to his enimies God mitigateth the heauinesse of his hand at first, and giueth them time and place to amend before he destroyeth them. Reuelat. 2. 
               I gaue her space to repent (saith Christ) but she repented not; and therefore when the measure of their sinnes waxeth full, God repaieth them the fulnes of vengeance, which is puuishment proportioned to their sinnes; and this is the due and proper punishments of those that are wilfull, and doe not repent their wickednesse.
            
               Defenc. p. 10. l. 29. [The paines of the godly are partly remembrances to cause repentance, partly Chasticements to humble vs and mortifie sinne in vs; but these whatsoeuer they be (yea though death it selfe) are improperly called punishments. Here you touch after your loose maner the purpose of God in afflicting his seruants, which you say is to reforme them, but in no wise to punish them. If God had none other meaning in afflicting the faithfull, but to reforme their sins, nor none other meanes to doe that, but by paines, your speech had some truth; but because God hath diuers purposes in so doing, and diuers waies without paines to amend his children, this that here you bring, as the rest else-where, is a blind groping besides the truth, and a bold presuming that you are in the truth. God many times lodeth the best and chiefest of his Saintes with oftner and greater troubles, then he doth the meaner sort; not because their sinnes are more then others, or they neede more amendment then the rest; but to TRIE their faith, as in Heb. 11. 
               Abraham, and Iob. 1. 
               Iob; or to shew the 2. Cor. 12. perfection of his grace, as in Paul; or to prepare them to glory, as in Luk. 16. 
               Lazarus; or to Rom. 8. conforme them to Christ, whose steps they must follow; and often to declare his iustice, as he did in striking Dauids child, when the sinne was both repented and pardoned in the Father. In the 2. Sam 12. sicknesse and death of which child, as of all other infants regenerate by Baptisme, there neither was, nor can be any vse of Repentance, humiliation, or mortification for themselues; and consequently by your owne diuision, since to them it can be NO CORRECTION, it must in them be a punishment of sinne, not actually committed by them, but naturally deriued to them by the guilt and corruption of their Parents. Yea, the generall paine laid on Adam and all mankinde, as dissolution by death, priuation of originall light and grace, corruption of sinne, infection of soule, which declare vs all to be the children of wrath by nature; were they corrections or punishments of Adams sinne, since after death there is no repentance nor amendment of life, and the rest are neither barres to sinne, nor retraits from sinne, but either parts, effects, or causes of sinne? which sticke so fast, and beare such

rule in many euen of the elect, that no gentle or fatherly admonitions, reprehensions, or comminations, will preuaile with them, but they must be ouerruled and wearied with sharp and pearcing scourges, before they will see or forsake the loathsomnesse of their sinne. Wherein though it be a great fauour of God, rather to persue them with all temporall plagues vnto their conuersion, then to let them run headlong to euerlasting perdition; yet the meanes which he vseth are mixed with iustice and mercie, and are rightly beleeued to be punishments fully deserued by their sinnes, though not fully proportioned to their sinnes, the iust and full wages whereof in sinfull men can be none other but death corporall, spirituall, and eternall. So that your diuision, all paine from God is either correction, or punishment; and your position no paine in the godly is punishment, are not onely friuolous and false, but repugnant each to the other: for so much as paine commeth from God for probation of faith, perfection of grace, assurance of saluation, encouraging of others by example, as well as for correction; and death and correction in Infants, where correction hath no place, must by your owne partition be a punishment of sinne inflicted on the first Man and all his posteritie. The which because we all inherite from our Parents, and had it in vs at our birth, when there was no vse of correction for vs, it was then in vs all, and so still remaineth a punishment of our first Parents sinne; though by the grace, and price of Christs death, we are and shall be freed from it.
            But come to your purpose, and apply this to Christ, for thither you bend andChrists bodily death, part of the punishment of our sinnes. thereat you shoote; is your diuision true in the sufferings of Christ? then since by your owne assertion Defenc. pa. 11. l. 12. 
               chastisements and remembrances, (which are the branches that you make of Correction) belonged nothing at all to Christ, and indeede there could be no cause to correct any sinfull corruption or affection in him, where no sinne was; it is a plaine confession that the bodily death and paines which Christ suffered on the Crosse, were the punishment of our sinnes in his body; and consequently a part of that curse which was imposed on the first mans sinne; which you so stifly denied in your Treatise, where you said; Treatise. pa. 45. l. 1. 
               Therefore Christs dying simply as the godly die (that is a bodily death) may in no sort be called a curse or cursed. And if to shift of this contradiction, and confession of the truth of my answere to the place of S. Paule, Christ was made a curse for vs, you referre these words (as the godly doe) not to the same kinde of death which is bodily in both, but to the same cause of death, which was different, in Christ and his members; Remember good Sir, the words are not mine, but your owne; I put many differences betwixt the death of Christ, and his Saints; as namely the cause, the manner, and force of his death, which I haue touched Supra pa. 7. before; but the kind of death which was bodily, and not Ghostly, is all one in Christ and the godly. For Christ died not the death of the Soule, no more doe the godly, when they depart this life, albeit they may oftentimes whiles here they liue, draw neere to the death of the Soule by sinning, which Christ could not. And if you begin now to be better aduised, I am not displeased with it; it shall suffice that mine answere did, and doth stand true, that Christ in suffering bodyly paines and death for vs, suffered a part of the same punishment and curse which was laid on all mankind for the sinne of Adam.
            
            
               Defen. pa. 9. l. 34. [We must note especially that to suffer (as the godly doe) Chasticements and corrections, is not to suffer or feele Gods wrath, nor the punishment of sinne: except it be in a very improper speech. To suffer the true punishment, satisfaction, proper payment and wages of sinne, onely that is to suffer properly and truely the wrath of God: now then seeing the paines which Christ for vs did feele, were indeede properly the punishment, and payment and vengeance for sinne, such as the godly doe in no wise suffer, Christ onely hauing wholy suffered that for vs all: Therefore indeede his sufferings proceded from Gods proper wrath, and were the true effects of Gods meere Iustice, bent to take recompence on him for our offences.] Thou hast in these words (Christian Reader) the bulwarke of this mans cause, concluding that Christ suffered the MEERE IVSTICE, PROPER VVRATH, and

very CVRSE of God for sinne. The frame of his reason, if I vnderstand it, (as who vnderstandeth his mysteries but himselfe?) is this. All paine in man is from God, either as correction of sinne or as punishment for sinne. In Christ there was no (‖ cause and so no neede of ‖) correction: his sufferings therefore were the punishments of sinne. They were punishments for sinne; Ergo, they were the true punishment, proper payment, wages and vengeance of sinne, which proceeded from Gods proper wrath, and were the true effects of Gods m

His termes of TRVE, PROPER, and MEERE, ioyned to the PVNISHMENT, VVRATH and IVSTICE of God, are not warranted by any Scripture, much lesse referred to the sufferings of Christ, nor so much as prooued by any testimony, defined with any certaintie, directed by any part, or expounded by any meanes; but onely proiected as Ridles, and laberinthes to weary the wise, to angle the simple, and to refuge himselfe, when he shall be pressed with the falsitie and impietie of his assertions. Least therefore we wrangle about words in vaine, which is his desire and deuise, that he may seeme to say somewhat, and carry the Reader into a forest of strange and vnknowen phrases, where he shall hardly discerne what either side saith; I th

               nke it needefull first to declare what the Scriptures meane by the wages of sinne and wrath of God, and so to trie in what sense, and with what truth his termes may be added to them, and applyed to the sufferings of Christ.
            
               Rom. 6. [The wages of sinne is death, saith S. Paul. God himselfe foretold Adam it should be so. Whensoeuer thou catest (of the forbidden tree) thou shalt 
               Genes 2. 
               die the death. Then how many kinds of death, are by God threatned and inflicted on sinners; so many parts must the wages of sinne containe. Now those are three, the death of the Soule in this life, which I call spirituall; the death of the body leauing this life, which I call corporall; and the death of both in the next world, which I call eternall. For as man had two parts by which he did liue, Soule and body; and two places wherein he might liue if he obeyed God, earth for a time, and heauen for euer; so disobedience depriued either part of man in either place, of the life which he should haue enioyed, and subiected him to the feares, griefes, and paines of death, both here, and in hell for euer.
            The life of the body is the vnion of the Soule with the body; the effects whereof are sense, and motion, to discerne, obtaine, and performe that which is needfull or healthfull for the body. And as the presence of the Soule bringeth life to the body, so the departing of the Soule taketh life from the body, and leaueth it dead, that is, voide of all action, motion and sense, as to euery mans eyes is apparent in dead bodies. The Soule therefore in the Scriptures is vsually taken for the life of the body, which proceedeth from the Soule, and is maintained by the Soule; And these phrases to Math. 2. Rom. 11. 
               seeke a mans Soule, tolay 
               Ioh. 13. 1. Ioh. 3. 
               downe his owne Soule, or to giue it for another, to powre out his Soule vnto death, with such like, doe properly expresse the death of the body, quickned by the Soule, because men loose or leaue this life, when they loose or leaue their Soules. And where God threatned death to Adam, euen the very same day in which he should transgresse, we must not thinke that God either delayed the punishment longer, or extended it farder, then his words at first imported. When therefore the very same day that they sinned, God said to the woman, 
               Genes. 3. 
               increasing I will increase thy sorrow, and to the man, In sorrow shalt thou eate all the daies of thy life, we must acknowledge, that from that time forward, death began to take hold, and worke on both their bodies, though not by present separation of the Soule from the body, (for Adam liued after that 930. yeeres) yet by mortalitie, mutabilitie, miserie, and namely by sorrow and paine as the instruments and agents of death. 2. Cor. 7.

And were it not so written, yet experience and nature teacheth vs, that griefe of mind, and paine of body, where they continue or increase, consume the flesh and hasten death; so that when God. the same day that they sinned, subiected them to sorrow and paine, which before they

And indeed the outward punishments of this life are by Gods bountie, and patience so tempered, not only with comfort to the godly, but with moderation to the wicked, that they warne all men to feare and flie the wrath to come, and giue time and place for amendment. Sapien. 12.

                  te (sayth

the Wiseman) for they committed abominable works, as sorceries, and wicked sacrifices; neuerthelesse thou sparedst them also, as men, and didst send the forerunners of thine host, euen hornets to root them out; not that thou couldest not destroy them with one rough word, but in punishing them by little and little, thou gauest them space to repent. The Apostle sayth the same,Rom. 2. 
               Despisest thou the riches of Gods bountie, and patience, and long suffering, not knowing that the bountie of God leadeth thee to repentance? but thou after thine hardnesse, and heart that can not repent, heapest vnto thy selfe wrath against the day of wrath, and of the declaration of the iust iudgement of God, who will reward euery man according to his works.
            
            The wrath of God is also diuersly taken in the Scriptures; sometimes for the inward dislike, and hatred that God in his holinesse hath of all iniquitie; sometimes for his iudgements threatned, or executed against sinne, whether they be tempered with loue or patience, to worke or expect repentance, as in his owne, and in this life; or proportioned to the deserts of wicked and impenitent sinners, for substraction of grace, as to the reprobate in this world, or infliction of vengeance, as to the danmed in hell. Such is the holinesse of God, that he can loue no wickednesse, but by nature and of necessity doth and must hate all vnrighteousnesse in whomsoeuer. Psal. 5. 
               Thou art not a God, that loueth wickednesse (sayth Dauid) neither shall euill dwell with thee. 
               2. Cor. 6. 
               What fellowship hath righteousnesse with vnrighteousnesse? or what communion hath light and darknesse; What fauour then and allowance should iniquitie finde with God, that is the very fountaine and flaming fire of all holinesse? To declare Gods perfect hatred against all sinne as well of the faithfull as faithlesse, the Scripture witnesseth not only that his soule abhorreth the outrages of the wicked, which are an abomination vnto him, but also that he is displeased and grieued with the sinnes euen of his elect. Prouerb. 6. 
               These things the Lord hateth (sayth Salomon) yea his soule abhorreth them. 
               Zacharie 8. 
               All these are the things that I hate saith the Lord, by the Prophet Zacharie. Psal. 5. 
               The foolish shall not stand in thy sight, thou hatest all them that worke i

                  iquitie, sayth Dauid to God. The Lord will abhorre the cruell and deceitfull man. Yea God is displeased and grieued with his owne, when they sinne against him. Deuter. 32. 
               The Lord saw it (sayth Moses) and was stirred to anger, with the prouocation of his sonnes and his daughters. When Dauid had slaine Vriah, and taken home his wife; the 
               2. Sam. 11. 
               thing displeased the eies of the Lord, sayth the Scripture. Likewise when he numbred the people, 1. Paral. 21. 
               God was displeased with that deed. Esay remembring the mercies of the Lord towards the house of Israel, sayth; Esa. 63. 
               hee was their Sauiour in all their troubles, he was troubled, and the angell of his presence saned them: but they rebelled and grieued the spirit of his holinesse. The Apostle confirmeth the same: Ephes. 4. 
               Grieue not the Holy spirit, by whom ye are sealed vnto the day of Redemption. Then as the loue of all righteousnesse is a naturall and necessarie consequent to Gods holinesse; so the dislike and hatred of all sinne is rightly and properly appertinent to his diuine puritie; neither must the godly take it for an improper kinde of speech, but fully beleeue and plainely confesse, that God is truely and greatly displeased with their sinnes, lest in their hearts they bring him within compasse of liking or allowing their vncleannesse: and when they repent, they must not onely tremble at the prouoking of so righteous and fearefull a Iudge, but chiefly sorrow for the displeasing and offending the holinesse of so gratious and louing a father. This dislike and detestation of disobedience euen in his owne children, which God of his holinesse hath, the Scripture often expresseth by the name of Anger, though no punishment follow. Exod. 4. ver. 14. 
               The Lord was very angrie with Moses (sayth the Scripture) when he so long refused to goe at Gods appointment to deliuer the children of Israel out of Aegypt. God was likewise Numb. 12. vers. 9. 
               verie angrie with Aaron and Miriam his sister, for speaking against Moses, though Aaron was not punished for it, and Miriam quickely healed of her leprosie. So God himselfe professed to Eliphaz the Temanite, saying; Iob. 42. vers. 7. 
               My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends, though he willed them to sacrifice for their offence, and promised to accept Iobs prayer for them. The same may often be obserued in other places of the Scriptures.
            
            The wrath of God is likewise taken for the threates, whereby God denounceth what he will inflict on the wickednesse of men; or for the sharpe reproofe, which hee vseth against sinne committed. Psal. 95. 
               I sware in my wrath, they shall not enter into my rest, saith God of the disobedient Israelites in the wildernesse. Ezech. 38. 
               In mi

                  d in the fire of my wrath haue I spoken it (saith God by Ezechiel) surely at that time there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel. So Dauid, Psal. 2. 
               Then shall ‖ God ‖ speake to them in his wrath, and terrifie them in his sore displeasure. Wherefore Dauid prayeth for himselfe, Psal. 6. 
               O Lord reprooue me not in thine anger; knowing that Gods rebukes and threates ought to be as much regarded and feared of the faithfull, as his plagues.
            Lastly, all the Iudgements of God, awaking the negligent, scourging the disobedient, obdurating the impenitent in this life, or renenging the Reprobate, here and in hell, are in the Scriptures called the wrath of God; of which speech there can be no question, because the word of God giueth plaine & plentifull euidence in euery of those parts: onely the Discourser auoucheth, that the two first, are no degrees nor effects of Gods proper wrath; though the Scripture call them wrath, but are so termed by a very improper speech. These are his words: Defen. pa. 9. l. 35. 
               To suffer chastisements and corrections as the godly doe, is not to suffer, or feele Gods wrath, except it be in a very improper speech. And this is one of the maine points, on which he putteth theissue of the question. Defen. p. 13. l. 2. 
               I affirme (saith he) Christ suffered Gods proper wrath and vengeance: You thinke, all afflictions whatsoeuer, small or great, and towards whomsoeuer, are the effects of Gods wrath: but that is not so, except in a most improper speech. To the godly their afflictions both small and great, are Gods fatherly and gracious chastisements, and no effects of his properwrath.
            
            Thou must not forget (Christian Reader) from what beginning we come to this issue. This Rouer taking vpon him to prooue, that Christ suffered the true paines of hell, and of the damned, made this his foundation, Treatis. pa. 33. 
               That Christ suffered the wrath of God for vs; which he affirmed to be equall to hell it selfe, and all the torments thereof. Mine answere shortly was, I did not see what this proposition, Christ suffered for vs the wrath of God, if it were granted, could helpe his cause, or hinder mine. Conclus. pa. 243. l. 27. 
               For the wrath of God extended to all paines and punishments, aswell corporall as spirituall, in this life and the next, were they temporall or eternall. So that no paine or punishment, small or great, could befall the bodie or soule of Christ, but it must needs proceed from the wrath of God. To this he now replieth, To 
               Defen. p. 9. l. 35. 
               suffer (as the godly do) chastisements and corrections, is not to suffer or feele Gods wrath, nor indeed the punishment of sinne; except it be in a very improper speech. Where first obserue that these words (as the godly do) are not conteined in mine answer, but intended by him in his replie. The ground on which I stood, was that all the miseries of mans life what soeuer they be, came first from the wrath of God reuenging the sinne of our first Father; and so are degrees and parts of that wrath wherewith God punished the transgression of Adam. I named no miseries peculiar to the godly, but common to them with the wicked; neither did I touch any speciall maner of suffering as the godly do suffer; but prooued that the Scriptures, which must teach vs all how to speake in Gods causes, called them wrath euen in the godly. And consequently, since Christ suffered sorrow, paine, and death, which came for sinne, and are common to all, he might and did suffer the wrath of God for vs, and yet not the paines of the damned.
            [You cast about afresh (Sir Discourser) in your defence, and tell vs the ScripturesPhrases of Gods wrath in Scripture against the wicked are improper. speake verie improperlie, when they call the miseries of this life the wrath of God; and therefore you bring vs a new phrase of your owne framing, and say the godly in no wise doe suffer Gods proper wrath, that is, properly taken, or properly so called, which Christ did suffer as you affirme.] Is your learning so good (Sir Defender) that you will applie to God wrath, indignation, and furie properly so called, which are the highest degrees of Gods anger against the wicked? Haue you forgotten, who tooke vpon you such knowledge in the Hebrue tongue, that the vsuall words whereby the Scripture expresseth the wrath of God against the wicked, do import the aph.

So that your late coined distinction of Gods wrath by improper speech towards his children, and his wrath properly so called against his enemies, is vaine and foolish: the words in Scripture that note Gods wrath against his enemies are most improper, and are translated from the behauiou

                of angrie men to God, of purpose to strike a terrour into the wicked, of that great and grieuous iudgement which they shall receiue. But whatsoeuer the words designe in their naturall signification, which the Christian faith forbiddeth vs to attribute properly vnto God, because they expresse humane affections and corporall passions, which are not in God: by the anger which is in God against sinne, the Scripture meaneth nothing els, but his most holy dislike of sinne in whomsoeuer, and his most iust and constant will and decree, in some to reward sinne according to desert, which is vengeance in this life, and the next; in others so to temper the punishment of sinne with loue and mercie, that whatsoeuer he inflict on bodie or soule, shall tend to the praise of his iustice and mercie, and end with the consolation and saluation of their soules. And by the anger which proceedeth from God, are in the Scriptures intended either his threats against sinne, or his punishments of sinne, be they corporall or spirituall, temporall or eternall, mixed with mercie, or proportioned only to iustice.
            If you relinquish your holdfast of improper speech, and rase that vnaduised shift out of your booke; (for God hath in him no wrath properly so called, but his holinesse displeased, and iustice prouoked by sinne, are improperly named his wrath in the Scriptures;) Let vs come to the proprieties of the things themselues, and see whether chasticements for sinne doe properly proceede from Gods loue onely, or from his iustice tempered with loue and mercy. Of the wicked I shall not neede to speake much, we make no great question of them; howbeit euen their externall punishments in this life are not voide of Gods bountie and patience diuersly blessing them with earthly things, often warning and sparing them, by giuing them time and place to mislike and leaue their sinnes; and length-fully expecting their submission and amendment, which the Apostle calleth Rom. 2. 
               the riches of Gods bountie, patience, and long sufferance, leading (euen the obstinate and hard harted) to repentance: The doubt is of the godly; whether their afflictions which are corrections and chasticements for sinne, rise only from Gods loue, or rather from his iustice mixed with loue. I affirme the Scriptures doe directly and distinctly propose in the chasticements of the elect as well iudgement and wrath, as mercy and loue; and that not by abusing the words, but by reseruing to either their naturall proprieties, and seuerall consequents; the one for the commendation of Gods iustice, the other for the demonstration of his mercy, and consolation of the afflicted.

               For his wicked couetousnesse I was angry, (saith God) and did smite him, ‖but‖ I will heale him, and restore comfort vnto him. He must be more then absurd; that will imagine, God would or could say, for his wicked couetousnesse I loued him; that were to make God the abettour and embracer of wickednesse, which is wholy repugnant to his Diuine sanctitie and glory; the words therefore must stand as they doe without any euasion of improper speech, and Gods anger in this place must plainely differ from his loue, which cannot be added to these words without euident impietie. Since then the cause was sinne which God doth perfectly hate in whomsoeuer, euen in his owne, and the smiting came for sinne and from anger, it is not possible this chasticement should spring onely from loue, but ioyntly both must worke together, I meane Gods anger against sinne, and his loue towards the person, to make the punishment tolerable, and comfortable to the bearer. The like rule God giueth for all that belong to the true seed, and sonne of Dauid, which is Christ. If

as the onely cause of this correction, which is ascribed to the transgressions and iniquities of the children; but it serueth for a salue, to heale the wound, which Gods iustice prouoked by their sinnes should formerly make. For he is the God that Deut. 32.

               Psal. 77. 
               shut vp his mercies. These two therefore in God, iust anger against the sinnes, and tender loue towards the persons of his children, together with their effects, which are iudgement and mercy, may not be confounded the one with the other, but as they haue different causes and proprieties in God, so haue they different effects and consequents in vs; the Scriptures bearing witnesse, that Gods anger riseth for our sinnes, his loue for his owne names sake; his anger he threatneth, his loue he promiseth; he hath no pleasure in punishing, he delighteth in mercie; he repenteth him often of the euill which he denounceth, his gifts and calling are without repentance; when we call vpon him he deliuereth vs out of all our troubles, his mercy will he neuer take from his, nor frustrate his truth. Yea, the godly haue a different feeling of his anger towards them from his loue; they feare, they faint, they grieue, and grone vnder the burden of affliction, they waxe weary of it, they pray against it; they giue him thankes when they are freed from it; none of which affections may with any sense of godlinesse agree to his loue.
            [But these are

               no effects of Gods proper wrath, (you thinke) Et pa. 10. 
               Christ onely hauing wholy suffered that for vs all.] What you meane by Gods proper wrath, is knowen onely to your selfe, you neuer expresse nor expound the word, but with more obscure and doubtfull termes then the former. At first, you affirme Gods wrath towards his children was a most improper speech. I haue now shewed, that if you looke to the words vsed in the sacred Scriptures, Gods wrath towards his enemies is as improper a speech as the other. Your second wrench was, that all chastisements for sinne are inflicted on Gods children properly by his loue. I haue prooued, that they proceede properly from Gods iustice tempered with mercie, and not from his onely loue. Your third shift is now, they are no effects of Gods proper wrath, which Christ did wholy suffer for vs all. If you vnderstand by Gods proper wrath that which is only wrath, and hath no admixture of his loue, fauour or mercie, then is your position ridiculous in your first maine point, and blasphemous in the second. For who euer auouched that God punished his children, and his enemies with the same degrees and effects of wrath? or who euer dreamed that God chastising the sinnes of his elect, in wrath remembred not his mercie? you doe indeede affirme of Christ, that he suffered all Gods proper wrath, which if you now interpret to be without all respect of loue or fauour towards him, you light on a greater blasphemie, then you are ware of. Wherefore looke well to your new found phrases of Gods meere iustice, and proper wrath, with which you thinke to colour your conceits; they will else proue you a weake Scholer, and a worse Christian.
            The word (proper) applyed to Gods wrath may signifie either that which is not figuratiue; or that which is not common to others; or that which hath no mixture of loue, or mercie to mitigate wrath, but is wholy and onely wrath. In God nothing is figuratiue; he is naturally, and wholy truth itselfe. The words applyed to him are often improper and figuratiue, because we can hardly speake, or vnderstand many

things that are in him, but by such words as are knowen and familiar to vs. In this sense all that the Scripture intendeth by wrath in God, is most proper, and naturall to God; namely his holinesse abhorring sinne; his iustice proportioning punishment to it, and his power performing whatsoeuer his will and councell decreeth for the repressing, or reuenging of sinne. For which respect Zanchius, a very moderate and considerate writer of our time, and one whom amongst others, the DiscourserDefen. p. 26. 
               iudgeth no way inferior to the best of the Auncients, setteth downe this for one of his Resolutions, which he calleth a Thesis:
               De tribus Elohim lib. 4. ca 6. quaest. 1. 
               Ira, eo sensu, quo scripturae dant illam deo, veré, & proprié, ei attribuitur: Anger, in that sense in which the Scriptures giue it to God, is truely and properly ascribed vnto him. And his resolutions ensuing vpon the former are not onely, that God is
               Ibid. quaest. 2. 
               angry, (he meaneth truely and properly as his first Thesis affirmeth,) with all sinners as well elect, as reprobate; but that,Ibid. quaest. 4. 
               maior & grauior est ira dei aduersus homines etiam electos, propter peccata, quam existimari possit ab ipsis hominibus. The anger of God against his elect for sinne, is greater and greeuouser, then they can conceiue.
            
            A second signification of proper may be, that this wrath which the Scriptures attribute to God, is proper to him, and common to no creature els. Men, and deuils haue wrath, but that is tumultuous, or vitious; and hath no communion with Gods wrath, which is righteous and holy. The Saints and Angels in heauen no doubt detest all iniquitie, but they are no fit discerners, esteemers, nor rewarders of sinne. The secrets of the heart they know not, whose vncleannesse is open onely to the eies of God. The waight of sinne they cannot truely balance; he onely that is offended, and cannot be deceiued, rightly knoweth how farre euery sinne should displease, and what euery sinne deserueth. As they cannot fully ponder offences, no more can they iustly proportion punishment to the demerits of euery sinner, and least of all ordaine, and arme meanes temporally to afflict, or eternally to reuenge the bodies and soules of transgressors: he onely that is all-wise, all-holy, all-iust and allmightie, can throughly discerne, perfectly dislike, euenly reward, and powerfully represse sinne by repentance or vengeance, as seemeth best to him; and therefote he onely is the righteous Iudge of the world, and capable of that wrath, which is proper to God.
            A third meaning of Gods proper wrath may be this, that as euery thing most rightly deserueth his name, when it hath in 
                  〈◊〉
                permixtion of the contrary to alter his nature; so Gods proper wrath may be that which is wholy and onely wrath without any temper of mercie or loue, to diminish the heate and hight of wrath. That is most properly light, that hath no darkenesse; trueth, that hath no falshood; good, that hath no euill in it. And since Gods iustice against the wicked admitteth neither loue to their persons, nor mercie to their miseries; that is also Gods proper wrath, which is fully and wholy wrath without any fauour or pitie towards them that are the vessels of wrath appointed to destruction. Of their damnation S. Iohn writeth: The

                   1. 
               Iacob haue I loued (saith God) and Esau haue I hated. Thou
               Psal. 5. 
               hatest (saith Dauid to God) all those that worke wickednesse. YeaRom. 1. 
               the wrath of God (saith Paul) is reuealed from heauen against all vngodlinesse and vnrighteousnesse of men. For as they regarded not to know God, so God deliuered them vp into a reprobate minde to doe vnseemely things. Neither is there any greater wrath in this life, then for men to be left to the lustes of their owne hearts, that they may be full of all vnrighteousnesse, wickednesse, maliciousnesse, haters of God, inuenters of euill, voyde of all loue, fidelitie, and mercie, and here receiue in themselues a meete reward of their errour, to prepare them for eternall vengeance, with diuels in the world to come. This wrath of God against the wicked, hath in it neither loue, nor mercie, but is wholy wrath proportioned to their desires which are sinnefull, and their deserts which are hatefull before God, and so they feele the iust, and full recompence of their affected ignorance, and wilfull disobedience.

Of this wrath the elect doe not taste, they are freed from it in Christ their Redeemer and Sauiour, by whose spirit their mindes are lightned and renued, and their hearts perswaded to the obedience of faith, and by whose death they are wholy deliuered from the wrath to come. Of the two former they often taste, specially when they neglect continuall and serious repentance, to which free remission of sinnes is offered in the blood of Christ Iesus; or when through the rebellion of the flesh against the spirit, they are caried backe to the desires of their former corruption. In which cases the Lord with sundry and sore afflictions letteth them sharpely feele what it is to prouoke the holinesse, or abuse the goodnesse of so gracious a Father, and neuer leaueth scourging them, till they see and acknowledge their vnrulinesse, and lament and leaue their vncleannesse, taking hope and hold through faith of his mercies promised them in Christ Iesus.
            If it can not be truely sayd of the elect, that in this third sense, which you vrge, they taste of Gods proper wrath, because of the loue which God beareth, and sheweth them in Christ his sonne; how much lesse may it be auouched of Christ himselfe, that he suffered all Gods proper wrath; on whom nothing was layed for our sinnes, but with so great loue, fauour, and honour (considering the cause which he vndertooke) that God in each and all Christs sufferings declared him to be the best pleasing sacrifice, and most sufficient recompense for sinne, that heauen could yeeld, or God would haue. For whether wee looke to the choise of the person, to the measure of his chastisement, or to the reward of his labour, wee shall see the exceeding and admirable loue, and fauour of God towards him, albeit the iustice of God kindled against our sinnes, did not quit him from all paine: yea that very chastisement, by which he yeelded, and learned obedience, did not onely witnesse, but also increase Gods loue towards him. And where you (Sir Discourser) cast your eyes onely vpon Gods seuere and implacable iustice against sinne, when you speake of Christes sufferings, to serue your owne turne, and to tole in hell-paines with some pretence of piety; all the godly may perceiue, and must confesse, that God in satisfaction for sinne had greater regard of his holinesse despised by mans disobedience, and of his glorie defaced by Satans triumph for our fall, than of the rigor of his iustice prouoked by contempt of his commandement. For had God chiefly respected the execution of his iustice against sinne, his owne sonne was most vnfit to be subiected to that vengeance which was prepared for deuils: but God in the recompense which he required for sinne, chose rather to haue his holinesse contented, and his glory aduanced, than to haue his iustice inflicted to the vttermost. And therefore he selected the person of his owne sonne, that might fully satisfie his holinesse, and maruellously exalt his glorie, but on whom of all others his iustice could take least holde; not that his iustice should be neglected, but that a moderate punishment in his person, for the worthinesse thereof would weigh more euen in the balance of Gods exact iustice, than the depth of Gods wrath executed on all the transgressours.
            The chastisement of our peace layd vpon him will proue the same. For where theWhat death Christ died. wages of sinne is death, and death due to sinne is threefold, spirituall, corporall, and eternall, as I haue formerly shewed; such was the person of our Sauiour, that two parts of death due to sinne, could by no rule of Gods iustice fasten on Christes humane nature. The gifts of Gods spirit and grace could not be quenched nor diminished in him; he wasIohn 1. 
               full of grace and trueth; he had not the spirit
               Iohn 3. 
               by measure, as we haue; but
               Iohn 1. 
               of his fulnesse we all haue receiued.
               Iohn 8. 
               It is my father (saith he) that honoureth me, whom ye say to be your God; yet haue ye not knowen him, but I know him; and if I should say I know him not, I should be a liar like vnto you: but I know him, and keepe his word, and do alwayes the things that please him. The cleerenesse of trueth knowing Gods will, and fulnesse of grace keeping his word, beeing continually present with the humane soule of Christ; most apparently the death of the soule, which excludeth all inward sense and motion of Gods spirit, could haue no place in him, by reason the death of the soule is the want of all grace, and height of all sinne, from which he was free:

much lesse could any part of Christs manhood by Gods iustice be condemned to euerlasting death, or to hell fire; since there could nothing befall the humanitie of Christ, which was vnfit for his Diuinitie, they both being inseparably ioyned together; or repugnant to that loue which God so often professed, and proclamed from heauen; or iniurious to the innocencie and obedience, which God so highly accepted, and rewarded; or preiudiciall to mans saluation, which God so long before purposed and promised. No weight of sinne, no heat of wrath, no rigour of iustice could preuaile against the least of these, to cast Christ out of heauen, and combine him with diuels in the second death, which is the
               Reuel. 21. 
               lake burning with fire and brimstone. There is onely left the third kinde of death, which is corporall, to which Christ yeelded himselfe willingly for the conseruation of Gods iustice, who inflicted that paine on all men as the generall punishment of sinne; for the demonstration of his power, who by death ouercame death, together with the cause and consequents thereof, and for the consolation of the godly, that they should not faint vnder the crosse, nor feare what sinne and Satan could do against them.
            It was loue then in God towards vs, to giue his sonne for vs;Iohn 3. 
               So God loued the world, that he gaue his only begotten sonne, that whosoeuer beleeueth in him should not perish, but haue life euerlasting: but farre greater loue to his sonne, than to vs, though the burden of our sinnes, which we could not beare, were layd vpon him. For since God hath.Ephes. 1. 
               adopted vs through Christ Iesus vnto himselfe, and made vs accepted in his beloued; of force he must be much better beloued, for whose sake we all are beloued. And if toHebr. 1. 
               make the world by his sonne, were an excellent demonstration of Gods euerlasting and exceeding loue towards his sonne; to
               Iohn 3. 
               send him into the world, that the world through him might be saued, doth as farre in honour and loue exceed the former, as our Redemption, by which heauen is inherited, doth passe our creation, whereby the earth was first inhabited. Neither was it possible that God should remit the rigor of iustice against sinne, for the loue of any, but onely of his owne sonne; whom because he loued as deerely as himselfe, and had made
               Hebr. 1. 
               heire of all things; worthily and rightly did the wrath of God against man asswage, and yeeld to the loue of God towards his owne sonne; against whom no punishment could proceed, but such as was fatherly, and serued rather to witnesse obedience, than to execute vengeance. For though you (Sir Discourser) in the height of your vnlearned skill resolue, that Christ could suffer no chastisement, butDefenc. pa. 11. l. 11. 
               all his sufferings were the true and proper punishment, or iust vengeance of God for sinne; yet the Prophet Esay telleth vs, the chastisment of our peace was vpon him; and the word Musar, which the Prophet there vseth, deriued from Iasar, is the proper word that in the Scripture signifieth the correction of a father towards his sonne; and of God likewise towards his Church.Prouerb. 19.

               Though he were the sonne, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered. He learned obedience, which is the subiection of a sonne to his fathers chastisement, he tasted not vengeance, which is the indignation of an enemie requiting.
            Yea the very death which Christ suffered in the body of his flesh, was so farre from being an effect of Gods proper wrath, that it was an increase of Gods loue towards him, and as well the price of our Redemption, as the cause of all his honor following.Iohn 10.

Was it then wrath in God without loue, that brought Christ to his death; or rather vnspeakable loue in God towards his sonne, which ouerruled his iustice prouoked by our sinnes, and so highly accepted, and plentifully rewarded the death of Christ, that he made him LORD ouer all things and persons in heauen, earth, and hell? to giue grace and peace, mercie and glory to Gods elect by his meanes and merites; and to inflict excecation, destruction, and damnation on the wicked both men and diuels by his iudgement and sentence? If it were admirable loue and fauour in God towards Christs humane nature to ioyne mans flesh and spirit into the vnitie and societie of his Sonnes Diuine maiestie, what inestimable honor and glory was it to put the whole gouernment of Gods kingdome in heauen and earth into Christs hands, which is the reward that God hath allotted to Christs obedience & patience shewed on the Altar of the Crosse?

            More then this if you will vrge on the person of Christ, as needefull for our Redemption, first proue it, and then professe it at your pleasure; otherwise if you boldly and vainely presume it, your addle and idle wordes can not preiudice the setled and vndoubted principles of the Christian faith warranted by the word of God, and fully receaued by the Church of Christ euen from the beginning. To your maimed and ruinous foundation that Christ must suffer all and the very same punishment, wages, and vengeance of sinne, which the damned doe suffer, and we should haue suffered, had we not beene excused by his suffering it for vs; I haue plainly and sadly answered I know not how often, it is a false and lewd imagination; and so impious, that your selfe dare not in your late Defence offer it to vew, without many bridles to holde it from horrible blasphemie. But (Sir discourser) why coyne you conclusions in christian Religion, that must haue three or foure exceptions to saue them from open impietie? and why see you not that your speciall reseruations ouerthrow the truth of your owne assertion? for where the true and proper punishment, wages and vengeance of sinne in all the wicked is spirituall, corporall, and eternall death; in your limitations at last, which you forgate at first, you except Christ from spirituall death, which is sinne, and from eternall death which is damnation of body and soule to hell fier; & yet you still affirme, that Christ suffered the full & proper punishment, wages, and vengeance of sinne, as though these two, spirituall and eternall death, were no parts of the punishment & vengeance due to sin; or these being excepted as vnfit for Christ to suffer; you could truely say Christ suffered the full and proper punishment, and vengeance of sinne, which consisteth of these three kinds of death.
            
            And who but you would send vs such headlesse and senselesse resolutions in Diuinitie as these are; I

               He suffered from Gods hand euen as the damned doe; namely in these points which are both possible and reasonable. Were you some new Euangelist, or vpstart Apostle, it were euen enough for you to referre Christs sufferings to your description and your limitation without any farther authority; but when you take vpon you with your bare word to broch so many nouelties in Christian religion, without one line or letter of holy writ to vpholde your dreames and deuices, who can chuse but deride your follie? You pinne mens faiths for the ground of their saluation to your descriptions and your limitations, to possibilitie and reason measured by your rule without any text or title of Scripture to warrant your words; and then you thinke the maine question is profoundly and fully handled; but your sober and wise Reader will presently finde the lamenesse or leudnesse of your grand conclusion. For if Christs person not only by your possibilitie and reason, but by the soundnesse of trueth, and sincerenesse of faith must be exempted from sinne which is the death of the soule, and from damnation which is euerlasting death; why write you so boldly that Christ must suffer all Gods proper wrath, euen all that the damned do suffer; whereas apparently those two being excepted, Christ could suffer no kinde of death but only a corporall? And if by your so describing and so limiting the matter, you draw Christ within the staine or guilt of sinne, or within the compasse or danger of damnation; hope you to finde any Christian eares so patient that will endure that monstrous and sacrilegious indignitie?

I make no doubt, but God can create another heauen, another earth, and another hell, as quickly and as easily as he did these that now are; yet if any man affirme that God will so do, or hath so done, I must holde him for an Infidell, because he gainsayth Gods trueth, and belieth Gods will by pretending Gods power. Talke not therefore what God can doe; shew rather by the word and witnesse of trueth what God hath done; to that must we trust, to that are you bound, and from that are you slipt. You haue not so much as any colour of Scripture, for these desperate nouelties and vanities, I will giue them no woorse words, lest you complaine of my bitternesse; and if any man be but so wise, as to let your proue these things before he beleeue them, he is safe enough for euer admitting them, I may spare my paines in refuting them; yet because destitute of all other helpe, you appeale to possibilitie and reason, to fourbish your new inuention of another hell, let vs see how handsomely you hale it onward.
            
               Defenc. pa. 8. l. 12. [By the law of our creation as we are men, hauing a soule besides our bodie, so our soule hath in it a threefolde facultie of suffering paines. First that which is proper and immediate iustly so called: proper, because it is proper only to reasonable and immortall spirits. Immediate two wayes; First, because it can and doth receiue an impression of sorrow and paines made from God only by and in it selfe, without any outward bodily meanes thereunto. Secondly, it is also an immediate punishment or els correction of sinne: it commeth not for any other cause at all. So that thus we meane, when we speake of the soules proper and immediate suffering. The soules second facultie of suffering paines, is not proper, but common to vs with beasts: namely, that which is by sympathie and communion with and from the body. A third kinde of painfull suffering the soule hath: namely, her vehement and strong affections are painfull, whether they be good or euill, as zeale, loue, compassion, pitie, care, &c. neither are these immediatly

            If the walles and roofe of your new hell rise no fairer, nor stand no faster then your foundation doth; a weake puffe of winde will blow all away. If a man should shortly answer you, That the soule of man hath but one facultie of suffering, though the meanes be diuers from which and by which she suffereth paines, and that the meanes be farre moe than you number (as namely she may suffer paine from her owne vnderstanding and will, yea from diuels and from the fire of hell, besides the meanes which you recken, to wit, her sympathie with the bodie, her vehement affections, and the immediate hand of God when and where pleaseth him) your building is at an end; you can go no farder; you haue neither Diuinitie, nor Philosophie, possibilitie, nor reason to support that which you would so faine inferre. But let vs view your specialties.
            [The soule (you say) by the law of our creation hath in it a threefold facultie of suffering paine.] The soule indeed by her creation hath a triple reference to good and euill; to wit, her apprehension and distinction of either; her inclination and motion to either; and her impression and passion from both; and for the performance of these she hath sundrie and seuerall parts and faculties. For as man was made to know God, and loue God, and after a time of obedience perfectly to enioy God, who is onely and wholly good; so had he three speciall powers and faculties in his soule answerable to these three purposes of the Creator; and yet capable of the contrarie, which was the want of all good, if he fell 
                  •…
               rom God. And therefore by the power of his vnderstanding man might discerne good and euill; by the libertie of his will 
                  •…
               e might elect and embrace either, and by the passibilitie of his soule he might feele and suffer the impression and sequele of both by ioy or paine, which God in his iustice alotted to be the end and wages of liking and doing good or euill. And because for the seruice and safetie of his bodie, and for the dueties and actions of this life, man was to vse earthly things, and also to need outward meanes for hearing the word, and viewing the works of God, there were giuen him senses to perceiue, and sensitiue motions to desire things needfull and delightfull for him, as also to dislike the euill of penurie, paine, and sorrow that should be occurrent to his senses. In which the wisdome of God ordained, that what seemed good to mans imagination should prouoke his desire with loue and delight, and what seemed euill, should offend him with some touch of griese; the superiour and spirituall powers of the soule being giuen as Iudges to censure, restraine and oue
                  •…
               rule the sensitiue delights and motions, where they swarued from the true rule of good and euill, which was only Gods will reuealed, or written in the heart of man. The respects and diuersities of good and euill offered in generall to the sense and vnderstanding of man, were sanctitie, sufficiencie, and felicitie with their contraries, and likewise the generall passions and impressions of good and euill receiued in the soule, were hope and ioy for good approching or posfessed; and feare and paine for the imminence or presence of euill, as also for the departure or losse of good, in whose place euill, which is the priuation of good, necessarily succeeded. The passions then of euill (for true ioy and hope thereof, are rather perfections than passions of the soule) are feare and griefe; and the meanes by which they are wrought in the soule, and brought to the soule, are naturally the senses and affections, vnderstanding and will; and supernaturally the hand of God, or such externall meanes as God hath prouided to punish the soule.
            So that first your making a threefolde facultie in the soule of suffering paines, is an ignorant conceit in you, as if the facultie of suffering paines were multiplied, because the meanes inflicting paines are many. If I should say, The soule hath in it a thre
                  •…
               
               fold facultie of vnderstanding, for that it perceiueth many things by the senses of her bodie; many things by her owne light and remembrance; and many things by the immediate reuelation of Gods spirit; might not wise men instly deride me, knowing

the power and facultie of vnderstanding to be but one and the selfe-same in man, though the means be diuers by which that facultie is informed? Likewise the will of man is caried sometimes by the eie, sometimes by the eare at the persuasion of others, sometimes by her owne affections, sometimes by feare, sometimes by reason, sometimes by grace; shall we therefore say the soule hath in it a sixfold facultie of liking and electing that which is offered her? or rather it is one and the same power of will, which is moued and often times ruled by these sixe meanes; partly from the bodie, partly from her selfe, partly from others, and partly from God. Euen so the passibility of the soule, or the faculty of suffering paine, is but simple and single in the soule, how many soeuer the meanes be, by which she receiueth the impression of paine: otherwise you might as well say, The soule hath contrary faculties of suffering, because she feeleth contrary impressions of ioy and paine sometimes striuing together, sometimes succeeding ech the other; but the soule as she is furnished with her faculties to discerne, and elect good and euill, so is she framed to receiue the impressions of either which are contrary; and in that respect capable of ioy and paine in this life, howsoeuer in the next life, the soule shall be perpetually fastned to the one or to the other without alteration or change.
            As you confound the facultie of suffering paine with the causes offering, and theThe agents and means by which the soule suffereth paine. meanes bringing the impression of paine to the soule; so doe you neither fully number the agents from which, nor the meanes by which paine is inflicted on the soule, on which you ground your three kinds of the soules suffering of paines. If the soule were not passible, that is, capable of ioy and paine, she could neither be rewarded for well doing, nor punished for euill. But God hath created her receiuable of both, that as she should doe good or euill in his sight, so she might suffer and feele that which should be good or euill, to wit, ioyous or grieuous euen in her owne sense and iudgement. Of both, (I meane ioy and paine as they are rewards of well and euill doing) God alone is in this life, and the next, the supreame ordainer, appointer, effecter, worker, and distributer, all other agents and meanes whatsoeuer seruing only his will, expressing his power, and obeying his commandement; yet that doth not hinder, but in the punishing of his owne heere, or of his enemies in this world and the next, God may and doth vse instruments and meanes, whom and what pleaseth him to performe his will. For example in this life, besides Gods agents to punish, which are Angels, men, diuels, and all other creatures; the meanes which he hath ordained to impresse paine in the soule, are as many as there be intellectiue or sensitiue powers and abilities in the soule to foresee, discerne, or remember whatsoeuer euill past, present, or to come, on vs, or on others whom we loue; or to perceiue, or desire any good which is lost, lacking, or likely to be taken from vs, or from others whom we regard. So that not only sympathie with and from the bodie, and vehement and strong affections, of zeale, loue, compassion, pitie, and care, which you recken, do paine the soule; but the eyes, and eares, vpon a thousand occasions, when the bodie is not touched, bring feare and griefe to the heart; yea the vnderstanding, remembrance, conscience, and will (which you vtterly forget) doe oftener offend and afflict the soule euen of the gody, than either the bodie, or the affections do. And in the world to come (which you purposely skip to make way for your new hell) besides the losse of glory, sting of conscience, and shame of sinne, the Scriptures assure vs that vtter darkenesse, ruthfullwailing, horror of diuels, torment of fire, despaire of case shal

            A third errour in you is, that you make your second kinde of the soules suffering paine, which is by sympathie and communion with and from the bodie, not to be proper to man, butDefenc. p. 8. l. 23. 
               common to vs with beasts; wherein you bewray either your vnderstanding not to be great, or your intent to be vilde. For though beasts haue bodies and senses, as men haue, and the paine of their bodies pierceth and affecteth the sensitiue parts & powers of life in them; yet haue they no soules I trust, which can be affected

the paine of their bodies, as men haue. I hope you be not so deepe in your distillation of hell, that you will bestow soules on beasts to make them liable to your newfound paines of hell; but in men their immortall spirits are and shall be afflicted by their bodies and senses both heere, and in hell, when the full punishment of their sinnes commeth to be layed vpon them.

               A sword shall pierce thy soule, sayth Simeon to Marie. Then for the soule or spirit of man to be vexed, afflicted, pierced, and pained by and from the bodie, is proper to man, and no way common to vs with beasts, which haue no soules: and that kinde of suffering paine which is without the bodie, is not proper to the soule, by reason it is common to men with diuels, who haue no bodies, and yet suffer paine aswell by their vnderstanding and will, as by externall meanes appointed of God to punish the damned both soules and diuels. Wherefore your termes of the soules proper and immediate suffering, which before I called vnsalted and vnsetled, and you say are

               easie to be vnderstood and necessarily to be vsed in this question, as you now haue declared and deliuered them, are false and absurd. For no kinde of suffering paine is proper to the soule of man, but onely that which is with the bodie, or by the bodie; the other kinde of suffering paine by vnderstanding and will, and by hell-fire, being common to men with diuels; which haue no bodies, and are no soules, no more than soules in heauen are Angels.

                  ent and strong affections are painfull, whether they be good or euill, as zeale, loue, &c. I pray you Sir, how come zeale, and specially loue, when they be good, to be painfull affections in your Calender? S. Iohn sayth, 1. Iohn 4. 
               There is no feare in loue; and giueth this reason; for feare hath painfulnesse, presupposing it for a prinple, that loue hath no paine: which is most true; because we delight in that which we loue; and so loue hauing no paine in it, but delight, it hath consequently no feare, by reason feare hath paine, which loue hath not. But if it be strong (you will say) it paineth the soule. If loue bring delight, the stronger the loue that is good, the greater the delight; and so the strength of loue doth not increase, but exclude all paine. Which is also S. Iohns rule, 1. Iohn 4. 
               Perfect loue casteth out feare, which is the least impression of paine that may be. And where loue that is good, is strongest and most feruent, as namely in heauen, there is no place for paine; and in earth when we are commanded to 
               Luc. 10. 
               loue the Lord ‖ our ‖ God, with all ‖ our ‖ heart, with all ‖ our ‖ soule, with all ‖ our ‖ strength, and ‖ our ‖ neighbour as ‖ our ‖ selues, must we be whollie delighted, or partlie grieued with God, and our neighbour. The like is to be sayd for zeale, which is nothing but the heat or feruencie of loue. Accidentally they may turne vs to paine, when our godly zeale and loue are hindred, or crossed by the wicked. But the thing that grieueth vs in those cases is not our loue, but the leaudnesse of the wicked, despising or wronging that which we zealously loue. And so may all vertues paine vs. What iust man is not displeased with iniustice? What liberall minde is not moued at auarice? What valiant heart is not grieued with cowardice? The like we shall

finde in all other vertues; euen an inward offence at their contraries, and yet no wise man will say that vertues are paines and punishments of the soule.
            [Of Dèfenc. p. 8. l 33. 
               compassion, and pitie, among the rest you say accidentally they may be punishments when they grow so strong that they grieue the soule.] As though there could be any compassion or pitie which doth not grieue the soule. What is pity but sorow at the sight of another mans miserie? and what is compassion but a vehement passion or griefe of the heart for his miserie whom we deerely loue? so that there can be neither compassion nor pitie, without sorow and griefe of heart; neither are they at any time punishments if they be good, but rather Christian dueties and vertues. The miseries of those whom we loue, may be punishments vnto vs; and our compassion on them, if they be wicked, may turne to be vicious, and so be a punishment because it is immoderate, where it should be temperate; as we reade of Dauids excessiue compassion on Absalon his leud and rebellious sonne. These be errours enow in so few words, but these are nothing to those that follow in fauour of the soules immediate suffering from the hand of God himselfe without any instruments or inferiour meanes. I might resume your former words of the soules immediate suffering from God alone; but because you heape vp a great deale of rubbish to the same purpose much like the other, or rather much worse than the other; I thinke it best to rid all together.
            
               Defenc p. 9. l. 9. 
               Thirdly, we must also note, that God himselfe is alwayes and euermore the principall and proper punisher when the soule suffereth paines after the first maner, that is in her proper and
               What suffering is immediate from God. 
               immediate facultie of suffering. And that is alwayes immediatly for sinne also, not for anie other cause at all. Fourthly, God himselfe therefore was thus the principall, and only proper punisher of Christ, as he sustained the punishment of our sinnes. The diuels and wicked men his persecuters did their parts also indeed for other ends, but yet they were all as instruments onely, and vsed by God vnto his owne end, namely that Christ might pay heereby a iust price and full satisfaction for our sinnes. It was then the Almightie and most iust God himselfe in his seuere wrath against our sinne, that principally and properly inflicted on Christ the paines and punishments, which he as our suretie suffered for the paying of our ransome. As it is written, 
               Esa. 53. 
               The Lord LAYD VPON HIM THE PVNISHMENT OF VS ALL.
            Your phrases be so fresh and new, that your selfe can scant tell what to make of them, or how to expound them. In these words, and those which goe but the next side before, you set vs downe three interpretations of the soules immediate suffering not agreeing the one with the other. Defenc. p. 8. l. 8. 
               All suffering of paine, is (you say) from God, either from him alone, or also from his instruments and inferiour meanes. This presently you call immediatly or mediatly; and this commeth neerest to the sense of the word, if it came as neere to the trueth of the matter. For what is immediate, but without all meanes? The soules first maner of suffering paine then (as you say) is immediate, that is Defenc. p. 8. l. 8. 
               from God only; you must implie without all instruments or inferiour meanes whatsoeuer. For that kinde of suffering which hath any meanes or instruments, is mediate, not immediate from God alone. Why then in your second interpretation of immediat, do you not exclude all instruments and meanes, but only outward bodily meanes? For thus you say in the second place, It is iustly called 
               Defenc. p. 8. l. 18. 
               immediate, because it can and doth receiue an impression of sorrow and paine made from God, only by and in it selfe without any outward bodily meanes thereunto. Heere you exclude not all meanes, but outward bodilie meanes. And when Satan led Saul for feare, and Achitophel for anger, and Iudas for sorrow to despaire, and in fine to dispatch themselues; this desperation wrought in them by Satan, was by your doctrine immediate from God, because the diuell was the doer thereof, without any outward bodily meanes. And likewise, when by hatred, rage, feare, and furie Satan afflicteth the children of disobedience, in whom he worketh; this you will call the immedia
                  •…
               e hand of God, because he vseth a spirit, and not a bodie for his instrument. And yet doubting how this can be maintained, for that God vseth men aswell as diuels to prooue and punish both his owne and his enemies, you fall to a third sense of immediate, where you make God alone the principall; the rest to be only instruments; and so that is immediatly from God, which is

principally from God, what meanes or instruments soeuer he vse, bodily, or ghostly, men or diuels. And in this sense all paines and punishments whatsoeuer, wheresoeuer, by whomsoeuer, are immediatly, that is, principally from God, and by consequent all three kinds of suffering paine in the soule which you put, and what meanes soeuer els can be named of inflicting and impressing paine in the soule are immediate from God, that is, they come chiefly from him, whose power, will, and iudgement the rest demonstrate or execute. And thus for want of trueth and lacke of vnderstanding, whiles you labour to expound the soules immediate suffering of paine from God, you vtterly subuert and ouerthrow all that you would say.
            [Againe, God himselfe (you say) is alwayes and euermore the principall and proper punisher, when the soule suffereth paines after the first maner, that is in her proper and immediate facultie of suffering.] Keepe your manifold faculties to procure you more wit; the soule hath but one facultie to suffer and feele paine, how manie soeuer the meanes be from which or by which she may receiue paine; it shall suffice to call it the first maner of the soules suffering paine. When you say God is the principall and proper punisher, what meane you by punisher? Amongst men the Iudge determineth and pronounceth what shall be done, the hangman executeth the sentence vpon the condemned, and both in their kinds are punishers. The like appeareth in Gods iudgements. God alone is the decreer, appointer and commander; though he v
                  •…
               e angels, men, diuels, and all other creatures to execute his will for the punishing of sinne; or deliuering of his seruants from the hands of the wicked. This is the difference betwixt an earthly & the heauenly Iudge; that men giue to men right, and not strength to execute their iudgements, but God as he gaue to all his creatures all the strength which by nature they haue, when he first made them; so hee vseth their naturall strength which he gaue, and giueth them farther power and force, where need is, fully to accomplish his will and commandement: yea farther, he vseth the willes and forces of men and diuels for ends and effects to them vnknowen, and in them vnrighteous, but to him most iust and holy. So that God is the only punisher as a Iudge to decree, appoint, and command what shall befall euerie man for sinne; he is also the onli
                  •…
                giuer and supporter of all power and force, when anie punishment is executed either by the naturall strength of any creature, or by strength and might aboue nature; but that God is alwaies and euermore the executioner, when the soule suffereth otherwise than by her bodie, or by her affections, or that he was the principall and onelie proper executioner of Christ as he suffered for our sinnes; or that in hell (which is your vpshot) God is the immediate executioner and tormentor of soules and diuels, those are rather sicke mens dreames or madde mens fits, than sober and Christian verities.
            And in plaine reason how agreeth this word principall, either with proper or with immediate, both which are ioyned by you with it? Where God is principall, there vseth he other meanes and instruments besides himselfe, and his owne hand. Principall hath alwayes accessaries and instruments, and where they intermeddle, they vse not Gods immediate hand, but such meanes as they are able and apt to guide. So that when God is principall punisher, he is neither proper nor immediate punisher, but vseth the seruice and force of his creatures to perfourme his appointment; and when he is either the proper, or immediate executour of his owne will, he neither needeth, nor vseth his creatures. And here the third time you play with the word proper, but very improperly, as you did twice before; first with Gods proper wrath, then with the soules proper facultie of suffering, now with the proper punisher, which can no way be matched with principall and applyed to God without a palpable absurditie. For referre principall whether you will, to the determination or to the execution of Gods wil and iudgement; to say that God is the principall determiner of his owne will, is a wicked speech. For who is Gods counseller to aduise him, or associate to assist him; that God should be principall and others concurrent with him to promote his will with their consents; or restraine it with their dislikes? God is not only a Iudge

of the world, but the sole Iudge thereof; to make him principall and not sole therein, is to impart his right, and glorie vnto others, which he will not endure. Wee shall see, honour, and admire, and with heart and voice magnifie the righteousnesse of Gods Iudgement that shall be giuen by his Sonne; 
                  •…
               n which sense it is said,1. Cor. 6. 
               The Saints shall iudge the worlde; yea, we shall iudge the Angels, but that is by submitting our wils to his, and by glorifying his iudgement, as in heauen his Saints alwaies doe, not by clayming voices with him. There is then no Iudge of the soule but onely God, and to say he is principall Iudge thereof, is apparantly to dishonour him. Will you referre principall to the execution of Gods iudgements? then he must haue some others to conioyne with him in common; and they must vse such meanes as lie in their power; and so God is neither the proper nor immediate punisher of the soule, where he is the principall. And when it pleaseth him to take vpon him the chiefe execution of his owne iudgement, what cause is there he should call assistants vnto him? Doth he lacke wisedome, or power, that his creatures must aide and helpe him? I wish you to weigh your words better, before you wade in things aboue your height.
            Your words are absurd, your matter is more absurd, and the proofes you bring for it are most absurd of all. To bring Christs soule within the compasse of hell paines, you flash out the fire of hell as a fable, and turne out of seruice the rest of the torments there, namely reiection from the kingdome of heauen, the sting of Conscience, confusion of Sinne, horrour of darkenesse and diuels, despaire of ease and such like, as no paines, or at least as no substantiall paines of hell: you suppose a paine which you imagine commeth from the immediate power of God, vpon the soules of the wicked as well in earth, as in hell, and so not onely you make God the tormentor of soules and diuels in hell with his owne immediate hande, but you so aggrauate the paine thereof, with fierie words, that the reprobate may fully feele it in this world, and yet it neither doth end their liues, nor waste their bodies, which a pange of the stone, or a fit of an Ague will doe. The best proofe you bring for all this, is a bold face, and bigge words, wherewith you bid all the world NOTE it is so. But Sir, if charitie did not stay me, I should NOTE you rather for an idle talker, then for a booke-maker, which thinke it lawfull for you to allegorize all that the Scripture mentioneth or threatneth of hell; and in the end broach out of the heate of your owne head a Chymysticall hell, as well in this world as in the next; and so little regard either the truth of Gods speech, or the faith of the whole Church, or the consciences of all good men; that without any further trouble or triall WE MVST NOTE, you say so. Such archers, such arrowes; such cheapmen, such chaffe; a man of your pitch will hardly be brought to any other passe.
            The bottome of your building (for it deserueth not the name of a foundation, it is so weake and rotten) is this, which I wish the Reader to NOTE, it is so notable stuffe; That where there are but three sorts of the soules suffering paine, as you conceiue; the first by the immediate hand of God, the second by sympathie with the bodie, and the third by her vehement and strong affections; The affections (you say) are neither
               Defen. p. 8. l. 29. 
               immediatly for sinne, nor punishments at all properly in themselues: the soules second facultie of suffering by sympathie with the bodie, you affirme, is
               Defen. pa 8. l. 23. 
               not proper, but common to vs with beasts: the first therefore in your conceit is the
               Ibid. l. 37. 
               proper and principall humane suffering for sinne; which Christ must needs feele being a
               Ibid. l. 38. 
               man made of God to suffer for all our sinnes. Of this wandring and halting diuision I haue spoken before. It is euident the soule may suffer paine from and with the bodie; and from and by her owne powers and faculties of vnderstanding, will, sense, and affections, and from the hand of God immediate or mediate, that is vsing other meanes than are beforenamed to punish the soule.
            That the paine of the bodie paineth the soule of man there can be no question, naturall  euidence and dailie experience sufficientlie confirme it: and this is that which you call sympathie, when both doe suffer paine together, the one from and with the other. Touching the eies and eares how often impressions they make of feare and 
               
sorrow for our selues and others, when the bodie is not touched nor pained, euerie woman and childe can giue testimonie. Threats, rebukes, euill reports taken in at the eares; dangers, distresses, and losses foreseene or seene in our selues and others, which must needs trouble and grieue the soule, are no newes in any condition or person. The affections which are both vngodlie and vnrulie, are so manie blasts and  stormes tossing the soule to and fro, with anger and feare, with desire and dislike, with pensiue care of earthlie things and foolish pitie, with hope and despaire, with vnlawfull loue and hatred, with vaine ioy and vnprofitable sorrow, and with a number like headie and hastie passions, insomuch that they often driue the soule to rage and furie, or end this life with griefe and disdaine. As for the vnderstanding and will; the soule  conceiuing Gods iust and heauie displeasure against sinne, and knowing the wages thereof to be finall depriuation of all grace and glorie, and eternall damnation of bodie and soule to hell-fire; how can she but quake and tremble at the very cogitation and remembrance of her owne guiltinesse, and of the greatnesse of his power and iustnesse of his anger? And therefore the godlie presently fall vpon the consideration  hereof to condemne and detest all their sinnes, and with broken and contrite harts to lament their vnrighteousnesse, and to afflict their spirits with earnest and inward sorrow till by faith and repentance they find comfort in the mercies of God through Christ Iesus. For want of which, the wicked often in this life, and speciallie at the houre of death, sincke vnder the burden of their sinnes; and plunged into the depth of desperation are possessed with an horrible fright, and terror of the torments prepared for them in another world; they feeling here on earth in their soules the remorse of sinne, and sting of conscience, but not able to rise vnto true repentance and hope of saluation by reason of their continuall contempt of grace, whiles it was offered them, which then is taken from them. After this life appeare the terrible iudgements  of God against sinne, which the wicked so much feare, and the faithful so much shun: the speciall maner and meanes whereof as farre as the Scriptures deliuer them, I will deferre till I come to the particular handling of them; though I haue often proposed them, and in part proued them; but whether the words of the Scripture expressing them be allegories, that is figuratiue shadowes, or plaine speeches, that question is not yet debated; which I reserue till I haue ended the immediate suffering of the soule, as this Discourser calleth it.
            Of these sixe meanes, besides the immediate hand of God to inflict paine on the soule for the punishment of sinne; it pleaseth you (Sir Discourser) to skip foure; and the other two in effect to denie. Affections (you say) are neither punishments nor corrections at all properly in themselues; and suffering by sympathie from and with the bodie, is common (as you auouch) to vs with beasts, and is no proper humane suffering; because in your iudgement your first kinde of suffering from the immediate hand of God alone is the proper humane suffering, which for that cause your selfe call the soules 
               Defenc. p. 8. l. 22. 
               proper and immediate suffering. But what if in all this you speake not one true word? what if the affections that be euill be properlie punishments of sinne? what if the soules suffering, from and with the bodie, be the true and proper humane suffering? what if God vse not his immediate hand in tormenting soules; but hauing ordained and appointed meanes by his wisedome and power, committeth sinfull soules to be punished by those instruments and meanes which he with his hand hath prepared, and in his word expressed? Do you not shew your selfe a deepe Diuine, that prooue points of faith by open falsities; and heape vp errours by the dozens, binding them with your bare word, and obtruding them to the world as oracles lately slipt from heauen? but go to the parts, and first to the affections, which you affirme are no punishments, whether they be good or euill.
            The affections of the soule that be good, as the loue of God, the zeale of his glorie, and hope of his mercie and trueth, are the speciall gifts and graces of Gods spirit, and so farre from paining the soule, that they breed exceeding comfort and ioy in the Holieghost. The affections that are e
                  •…
               ill are not onely the rage and reward of sinne,

but inflict as great anguish as may be felt in this life. Concupiscence which is the root and nurse of all euill affections in vs, be they sensitiue or intellectiue; what is it, but the inordinate and intemperate desire and loue of our owne willes and pleasures, despising and hating whatsoeuer resisteth or hindereth our deuices or delights, yea though it be the will and hand of God himselfe? this corruption of the soule by sinne, which is now naturall in vs all, whence came it, but from and for the punishment of the first mans sinne? what is it but the verie poison of sinne? and whether tendeth it, but to withstand and refuse all grace, that men reiecting God, and reiected of God, may runne headlong to the finall and eternall vengeance of their sinne? It is no small punishment of sinne for men to be left to the 
               Rom. 1. 
               desires of their owne hearts, and to be giuen ouer to vile affections; which the Apostle calleth the reward of their error, and euen the fulnesse of all vnrighteousnesse: which make men the seruants of sinne, whiles they Tit 3. wait on lusts, and diuers pleasures, which 
               1. Pet. 2. 
               fight against the soule, by 
               Rom. 7. 
               leading it captiue vnto the law of sinne, which is in the members. And if you doubt whether they paine the soule or no, looke but on their names or their effects, and you shall soone be out of doubt. Anger, disdaine, despaire, dislike, detestation, feare, sorrow, rag
                     •…
                  , furie for earthly things, can these be so much as conceiued or named without euident impression or mention of paine? yea the fairest of our affections, and those which at first flarter vs most, as loue, desire, and pleasure. (I speake still of euill and vnlawfull) do they not quicklie faile, sowerlie leaue, and sharplie vexe with their remembrance and repentance the greatest seekers and owners of them? In all these worldlie desires and delights S. Austens rule is generallie true. August. deciuitat. Dei. l. 21. cap. 26. 
               Quod sine illiciente amore non habuit, sine vrente dolore non perdet. He that kept them not without alluring loue, loseth them with afflicting griefe. As for the intellectiue passions of the soule, which are the trembling at Gods wrath, the feare of his power, and despaire of his fauour, besides the shame of sinne, griefe of heart, and horror of hell; what torments they breed in the condemned consciences of the wicked, the godly may partly iudge, by that which they sometimes taste, notwithstanding their present recourse to the mercies and promises of God in Christ. So that euill affections, aswell intellectiue as sensitiue, be punishments of sinne, and painfull to the soule; howsoeuer your cogitations (Sir Discourser) be otherwise humored.
            Concerning the soules suffering from and with the bodie, which you say is commonThe soules suffering from and with the bodie is not common to beasts. to vs with beasts: if the soule do not consider for what cause, at whose hand, and to what end she suffereth; as also how she may be freed, and what thanks is due to her deliuerer, she may be well likened to the Horse and Mule in whom is no vnderstanding: but the brutish dulnesse of some earthly minded men, doth not make this kind of suffering not to be properly humane, which God from the beginning did, and doth vse to all his seruants and saints (his owne sonne not excepted); and whereby God worketh in all his children correction, probation, perfection, preparation to glorie, which are things most proper to men, and no way communicable vnto beasts. Heb. 12. 
               God scourgeth euerie sonne whom he receiueth, and yet he vseth him not like a beast. 2. Tim. 3. 
               All that will liue godlie in Christ Iesus shall suffer persecution, not common to them with beasts. Iam. 1. 
               Count it an exceeding ioy (saith Iames) when you fall into diuers tentations, knowing that the triall of your faith bringeth foorth patience. Now to impart any of these things to beasts, were very strange Diuinity. Math. 5. 
               Blessed are they (saith our Sauiour) that suffer persecution for righteousnesse sake, for theirs is the kingdome of heauen. Shall men be blessed, and enioy Gods kingdome for suffering as the beasts doe? 1. Pet. 4. 
               If any suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed. He that putteth no difference betwixt the sufferings of beasts and Christians, is vnwoorthie to be a Christian. 1. Pet. 5. 
               The same afflictions (saith Peter) are accomplished in your brethren, which are in the world. If you list (Sir Discourser) to take beasts for your brethren, you may make your sufferings like to theirs, or common to them; otherwise they that are men, and speciallie Christian men, must acknowledge that this kinde of paining the soule by the bodie, is proper to men, and common neither to beasts, nor to diuels. 1. Cor. 10. 
               There hath no tentation taken you (saith

Paul) but such as is humane. What is humane, but common to all men, and onely to men; and so common neither to beasts, nor to any other creature, but proper to men? Take backe therefore your vaine imagination, and more foolish collection, that the suffering of the soule by her bodie is not properly humane, because it is common to men with beasts, and learne hereafter that beasts hauing no soule, much lesse anie graces or promises of God in this life or the next, can not communicate with men in that kinde of suffering, which the soule feeleth from her bodie, and whereby she is chastised, prooued, perfected in this life, and prepared for the glorie of the life to come.

            From the hand of God without question is all power, and so all punishment, whether it be here, or in hell; he alone giueth force to each creature to pierce and punish; and he alone made the soule capable of paine from her bodie, from her selfe, and from whatsoeuer creature should please him to vse for the punishment of the soule. Of this I make no doubt; the hand of God, which is the power of God, ordereth▪ strengtheneth, sharpeneth, continueth, and worketh, all paine and punishment both here and elsewhere, for the time and for euer; but whether he doeth this by meanes likewise ordeined and appointed by the same power, either within or without the soule, or by his immediate hand without all meanes, this is the question; and reading the Scriptures for this with as good attention as I could, I find no such thing affirmed in them, or prooued by you in all your Discourse.

            That God is the onely giuer of all grace, by the working of his holy Spirit in our hearts, without the assistance of any creature to further that action, may not be doubted of any Christian. Iohn 3. 
               A man can receiue nothing except it be giuen him from heauen; euen from the Father of lights. (whence) Iam. 1.

Otherwise neither man nor Angel hath, or can haue

any power to touch and turne the heart, or to inspire it with grace, but onely God, who made it and can alter and change it at his pleasure.

               worketh in the children of disobedience, and carieth them headlong into all kind of mischiefe. Not that God performeth any of these things with his immediate hand, which are wicked and impious; but that by his iust iudgement he giueth them ouer, which despise and forsake him, to be a pray to the roaring Lion, that deuoureth them. Neither is Satan to seeke howe to leade men destitute of grace, to all villanie both against themselues and others; since he can 2. Cor. 4.

               wits, and inflame their hearts with all sorts of raging lustes, and vntamed affections, as he did in Cain, Saul, Achitophel, Iudas; and dayly doth in all the wicked.
            In the outward punishments of this life, where God turneth the furie and violence of his creatures to reuenge sinne; and the seruice of men, Angels, and deuils, to pursue the wicked to their destruction, and to chastise his owne to their conuersion; the hand of God doth euery where appeare by the Scriptures, but that is nothing to your immediate suffering of the soule. For first in them God vseth his creatures, as his agents and instruments; and where his immediate hand may happily be conceaued to worke without meanes, there he punisheth the soule by the bodie, which by your owne position is not the proper and immediate suffering of the soule.
            In the feare, shame, and griefe, which the soule here conceaueth vpon the denouncing, conuicting, or beholding of her owne vncleannesse, and the terrible iudgements of God against sinne; the power, trueth and iustice of God are euident, but not that immediate hand of God, which you imagine. For in this case God punisheth the soule by her selfe, that is, by her intellectiue or sensitiue faculties, letting her plainely perceiue, what ioy is lost, and what vengeance is prouided for all the workers of wickednesse. The losse of which blisse, and terrour of which vengeance apprehended by outward sense, or inward intelligence, cannot but mightily grieue and afflict the soule. And the greater the losse, that is irreuocable; as also the soarer the mischiefe that is ineuitable, the deeper is the wound, that either of them make in the heart of man. But this feare and griefe, whiles here men liue, proceede from the cogitation and perswasion of the minde and conscience, and not from the immediate hand of God. And in the world to come the horrour of hell and rage of fire, which God hath ordained to punish the soule, shall inflict an intollerable torment not rising from the minds and wils of the wicked, as in this world it doth, but impressed by an externall and violent agent, which is the meanes that God hath prepared to execute vengeance on men and deuils.
            How beit in none of all these appeareth that immediate suffering of the soule from the hand of God alone, which you so much talke of, and to which you would so faine subiect the soule of Christ to make him suffer the substance of that, which the damned (according to your dreame) doe feele in hell. For in your conceit of the soules immediate suffering from the hand of God, the soule must onely be a patient, and no agent; and God must inflict the paine on the soule with his owne hand, and not by any meanes without or within the soule; onely the soule must feele and discerne the present and inherent paine by her passiue power and facultie, by which she is capable of all paine, whence soeuer or howsoeuer it commeth. This kind of suffering you euery where affirme, you no where prooue; and that which is most absurd, you presume against the cleare words of the holy Ghost continually naming the fire of hell, and threatning the wicked with it, to allegorize the Scriptures at your pleasure, and

in stead of fire which God hath ordained and armed as a most dreadfull meanes to take vengeance of sinne, you suppose a certaine paine, which God with his immediate hand will inflict on the soules of the damned, and that you make the substance of hell paines, and fasten it to the soule of Christ for the time, before he could worke our redemption, or suffer the punishment of our sinnes. But sir Discourser this is rather dreaming then debating of matters of faith, to allegorize whatsoeuer standeth in your way, and in stead thereof to imagine what you please without either proofe or pretence out of the word of God; as if your mouth were the rule of Religion, or the trueth of God would vanish by your fantasticall figures and shadowes. Wherefore leaue your deuising and auouching what best liketh your vnquiet humour in so weightie matters of mans Redemption, and tye your tongue if not your heart, to the wordes of the holy Ghost, that at least you may beare the shew, if not the sense, of a Christian man. For I vtterly denie that God is either the immediate tormentour of soules in hell, which is your idle and absurd imagination; or that with his immediate hand God did torment the soule of his Sonne at any time here on earth, as the soules of the damned are tormented in hell, which is your witlesse and wicked assertion.

But grant it may sometimes by the ioyning of other words import anie punishment allotted to wickednesse; doth the Prophet say that God layed all the punishment due to sinne vpon Christ, or that God layed it vpon the soule of Christ; both which you inferre out of the Prophets words, though neither be there expressed, or thence to be concluded? S. Peter will tell you on what part of Christ God layd our sinnes, euen on his bodie. 1. Pet. 2. 
               Himselfe bare our sinnes (saith Peter) in his bodie on the tree. Now where Christ did beare them, there God did lay them. Christ bare them in his bodie, as Peter affirmeth; God therefore layd our sinnes on his bodie, that by suffering death on the Crosse, which was the wages of sinne, Christ might make the purgation of our sinnes in his owne person. Againe, the sense which you would sowe to the Prophets words, that God layd vpon him all our punishment, that is as you would haue it, all the punishment which we should haue suffered, is false and wicked. For so Christ must haue suffered, reiection, desperation, and eternall damnation which the damned doe suffer, and we should haue suffered, had we not beene redeemed. If you meane no more than the Scripture intendeth, that what Christ suffered for vs in the bodie of his flesh on the Crosse, was the full redemption and satisfaction for all our sinnes; then are you wide from concluding out of these words, that Christ suffered the paines of hell or the full vengeance due to our sinne by the immediate hand of God, which is the chiefe point that you aime at. This is all the proofe you offer out of the Scriptures for the immediate suffering of the soule of Christ from the hand of God; and what sturdie stuffe this is, the rudest reader that lighteth on your pamphlet of Defence will soone conceiue. If you keepe this course in the rest of your positions, the world will soone be wearie of your new-found fansies, if you be not of your manifest follies.

Of the continuance there can be no question, but here it is expresly mentioned, that it shalbe EVERLASTING. For the place, it is as plaine by the witnesse of the Scripture, which maketh no fire euerlasting but onely hell-fire. Our Sauiour Marke 9. vers. 43. 45. twice in one chapter ioyneth the one as an exposition to the other; and thrice almost with one breath affirmeth euerlasting fire to be the fire of hell. vers. 44. 46. 48.

No fire is euerlasting, but onely hellfire. Christ therefore in his sentence including the one, implieth the other as part of his iudgement against the reprobate, and maketh both time and place essentiall parts in the punishment of the damned. And when he sayth, DEPART from me ye cursed, forsomuch as there shalbe then no places left, but heauen for the blessed, and hell for the cursed, he doth not exclude them from the one, but by appointing them to the other. Besides, that fire which is prepared for the diuell and his angels, is no where but in hell; and therefore adiudging them to that fire, he doth euidentlie adiudge them to hell fire. Since then no man is or shall be damned but only to hell, and that for euer; the place and continuance are expresse, and so essentiall parts of the iudgement; and consequently of the punishment that is and shall be inflicted on all the damned. For the iudgement which then shall be openly pronounced, is immutablie decreed, and alreadie reuealed by the Iudge himselfe; and therefore vnchangeable to all that a

Most vainly then and falsely doe you slide betweene the substance and circumstance of hell-paines; since the name of hell-paines doth necessarilie and naturallie import the place of torment where those

paines are, which is hell; and out of which place they are not: els might they be called aswell aëriall or terrest

            And where you would seeme out of the dregs of Philosophie to borrow the difference of the substance and circumstance of hell-paines, you vnderstand not what you say. For euen by the rules of Philosophie there are no circumstances in things perpetuall and immutable. Circumstances must often varie, els are they no circumstances, if they be eternall and necessarie consequents. Since then time and place do not alter in anie of the damned; for all that are damned are cast into hell for euer, though all suffer not like paines; if there be any circumstances in hell, they are rather in the degrees and differences of paine, which you make the substance of hell, than in the place or perpetuitie of the torment, which neuer varie in any of the damned. And since you will needs be medling with Philosophie, I pray you Sir Discourser, if Christ suffered the substance of damnation as you auouch, doth not your doctrine plainlie conclude the Sauiour of the world to be damned? for, which shall truely attribute the name of anie thing to anie person, the substance or the circumstance of the thing? By all the rules of Art and reason, to whom the definition doth agree, the thing defined must likewise agree. Now ech definition importeth the substance, not the circumstance of the thing defined. And so if Christ suffered the substance or damnation, it is euident by your doctrine he was damned; which is a corollar

               ised in his sentence of condemnation, you make that only to be substantiall and essentiall in hell-paines; let the Reader now iudge whether this hel be not of your owne framing, and not of Gods ordaining.
            This is follie sufficient by a vaine distinction of substance and circumstance to exclude all that Christ pronunceth on the damned, from the substance of hell paines; but because it maketh an open gap to Atheisme, to allegorize the greatest torments that God hath ordained for the wicked in hell, and to admit nothing for the substance thereof, saue that which was common to Christ with the damned; which can be neither reiection, malediction, nor eternall torment of fire, since Christ suffered none of these, and yet (as you affirme) he suffered the substance of all that the damned doe suffer; let vs more largelie consider what paines are essentiall to damnation, and to hell, not that hell which your running head hath latelie hatched, but that which the word and will of God hath for euer established; as also whether there be true fire in

hell or no; that we may the more plainly perceiue what vanitie and impietie you haue aduentured to make hell and so heauen to be euerie where as touching their substance; and the chiefest torments of hell to be imaginarie paines deuised and conceiued by your selfe and a few of your sect, without all warrant of holie Scripture, or witnesse of ancient and Christian beleeuers. Wherein when I speake of substance and essence, thou must not thinke (gentle Reader) that I meane precisely matter and forme, as Philosophers do, which bodies only haue; I speake as a Diuine, of rewards and punishments; in which that is most essentiall and substantiall, which God hath ordained shalbe generall and perpetuall in either kinde. Then that is essentiall to damnation or to the paines of hell reserued for the damned, which God by his word and will reuealed, hath prouided and established for all that shalbe damned, excepting or sparing none, but including them all in one and the same iudgement. And if thou finde by the word of God, that the place of hell and perpetuall torment there, be necessarily and generally decreed and appointed for all the reprobate that shall be damned, make sure account that is essentiall to the punishment and paines of hell, which the will and word of God hath ordained and expressed shall ineuitably and eternally pursue and punish the wicked. For Gods will and ordinance is most essentiall and substantiall in all these things; and what he hath determined, and setled generallie and eternallie, without ceasing or changing to take holde on the wicked, that is the substance and essence of their punishment, and of hell-paines, which is their portion.
            In my Sermons I deliuered manie parts of hell-paines, which by no meanes could with any sense of religion be applied to Christ. The Discourser neither doth nor can denie them, but shifteth them off as either allegoricall or not essentiall to the paines of hell. I shall therefore need but to examine whether they be figuratiue or proper speeches, as also whether they be essentiall or accidentall to the condition and punishment of the damned; which I am content in order to do. Out of the sentence of the Iudge to be pronounced against all the reprobate, I obserued foure parts of hellpaines inflicted on all the damned; to wit, Sermons.

               e true, though it be neither agreeable to himselfe in other places, nor conformable to his generall positions otherwise. But of that afterward. In the meane while, if reiection from all grace and glorie, and extreame malediction of bodie and soule, be essentiall paines in hell, and punishments for sinnes; and Christ neuer tasted these; then Christ neuer suffered all that the damned doe suffer, as touching the essence and substance thereof.
            And first of reiection from the kingdome of God, what say you, Sir Deuiser, (for IReiection from the kingdome of God: essentiall to hell paines. may rightly so call you, that take vpon you to deuise vs a new hell not heard of in the Scriptures) is it either no paine to the damned, or is it no essentiall part of their punishment, to be thrust out of the kingdome of heauen? The losse of good things, when they be perceiued and desired, doth by nature no lesse grieue and asflict the soule of man, than the presence of euill doth offend him. All earthly creatures, as well as man, affect that which is good for them; and from the desire of good which is naturall to all, it is not possible that man should be exempted: but as by sense and vnderstanding he discerneth higher and better things than the rest, so this affection and inclination after he truely perceiueth or fully beholdeth them, is exceedingly inflamed with them; and when he findeth himselfe disappointed and depriued of them, his griefe increaseth according to the goodnesse of the things, and greatnesse of his desire. The ioy and honour then of the saints in the kingdome of God when the wicked shall presently beholde, and see themselues reiected thence, they shall inwardly grieue with vnspeakable sorrow, and outwardly mourne with gnashing their teeth for very anguish of heart, as perceiuing themselues excluded from that inestimable blisse for euer. This collection our Sauiour confirmeth in expresse words:

               There shal be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob, and all the Prophets in the kingdome of God, and your selues thrust out at doores. Yea where there are two sorts of paines in hell; Losse of heauen, and sense of euill; the learned and ancient Fathers haue professed the former, to be a greater and grieuouser paine than the latter. Ad Theodoru lapsum epist. 5.

                  firme there is a farre worse torment than hell it selfe is, to wit, the losse of so great glory, and the falling there-from. Neither doe I thinke that we ought so much to grieue at the euils in hell, as at the losse whereby we fall from heauen, qui nimirum est cruciatus omnium durissimus, which doubtlesse is the bitterest anguish of all the rest.

If the griefe shall be so great to be excluded from the kindome of God, and the same be comprised in the sentence of the Iudge, where he saith, Depart from me ye cursed; then is there no doubt but it is an essentiall part of the paines of hell: since it is not only generall and perpetuall to all the damned; but a necessarie precedent to the rest of their torments, which can neither take full hold of them, nor afllict them in the highest degree, till they be wholly depriued of all consolation and expectation of any fauour from God, and vtterly confounded with the griefe and shame of that re

               Magna paena est impiorum conscientia. The conscience of the wicked, is a great paine or punishment vnto them.
            You did well vtterly to exempt the Sauiour of the world from both these, I meane from reiection and malediction; you must otherwise haue depriued him of all grace and glorie; and plunged him into the shame of sinne, and remorse of conscience; neither of which without open impietie, can be ascribed to the soule of Christ: and yet both these are essentiall paincs to the damned, and not circumstances, as you pretend of time and place. How painefull they are, I leaue the Reader to consider by that which is already said; essentiall they cannot chuse but be to damnation and hell, not onely because they are comprised in the sentence of the Iudge, which is the substance of condemnation, but also for that the rest of hell paines are not inflicted till both these take hold on the soules of men. For so long as men haue any part or hope of heauen, they are not condemned to hell, neither shall the finall iudgement of God proceede against any, till their owne consciences doe first conuict them and condemne them. And therefore as in Christs sentence, reiection, and malediction stand before the rest, so in perfourmance they must take place before eternall torment of fire shall follow. Gods iudgement being certainely iust, shall be without all contradiction euen in the consciences of the condemned, who then shal be their owne accusers: and as hell hath no communion with heauen, no more can a man bee adiudged to hell, but he must first be excluded from the possession and expectation of all heauenly ioy and blisse. I speake of the order and coherence of the punishments, not of any long distance of time betweene them; forsomuch as that iudgement shalbe as quickly executed, as pronounced.

               , which I make no question, but you will acknowledge to be an essentiall paine of hell, whatsoeuer you intend by the name of fire. For if this also be accidentall to damnation, I maruaile much what is substantiall. But you are content to admit this for the substance of hell paines, so you may allegorize it, and make thereof what best fitteth your fansie. Then if Christ suffered not the torment of hell fire so much threatned to the wicked in the Scriptures, and inflicted on the damned by Christs sentence; it is very plaine he suffered no part of the substance of hell paines; vnlesse your learning serue you to say, that when Christ commeth to giue Iudgement against all the damned, he shall vtterly forget and mistake himselfe, and in stead of the substance of hell paines, pronounce onely the circumstances thereof against the reprobate both men and Angels. Here therfore is the place to examine whether the fire of hell be allegoricall, or no; for that it is essentiall to the paines of hell, can be (no doubt) with any but with Atheists, and Infidels, which know not God, since it is named by Christ as a chiefe punishment, prepared for the diuell and his Angels. Wherein I wish thee (gentle Reader) aduisedly to marke what is said on either side, it is a matter of no small moment both to Christian religion and true godlinesse, whether it shall be lawfull for euery vnstable wit, at his pleasure to allegorize whatsoeuer liketh not his humour in the sacred Scriptures.

For if the small and eternall Iudgement of God against the wicked be allegoricall; then surely the reward of the faithfull from the same Iudge at the same time must likewise be allegoricall. And if we once bring all that is threatned and promised in the world to come to be figures and allegories, we endanger the power, and iustice of God, which must openly appeare to all the world in the punishment of sinne, (if he be a God: and displeased and offended with sinne) as also his mercy, bountie and glorie, in crowning his elect, to be nothing but types and figures. The end of all things, which is the time of iudgement must openly and fully performe whatsoeuer God in this life threatneth or promiseth: and if that day doe not plainly distinguish betweene righteousnesse and vnrighteousnesse, the elect and the reprobate, and shewe a most sensible difference betwixt the kingdome of heauen and the torments of hell; to the view of men and Angels without figures or allegories, no time after is, or euer shalbe appointed for that purpose.
            The first reason which leadeth me to beleeue the fire of hell to to be a true, substantiall, and externall fire, and no allegorie, is that, which is and must be the ground of all Religion, to wit, the proper signification of the word threatned in the Scriptures to the wicked, and by Christ inflicted on the damned. Otherwise if we hold not fast this rule, not to runne to figures in expounding the Scriptures, except the proper signification of the words in any place be August. de d

               against the trueth of faith, or honestie of manners, we shall leaue nothing sound or assured in the word of God. For August. ibid. 
               when the mind is possessed with any errour, whatsoeuer the Scriptures auouch to the contrarie, men thinke it to be figuratiue; as S. Austen rightly obserueth. Your selfe approue this rule, when it maketh any thing for you: your words are: Defenc. pa. 109. l. 8. 
               I like well that no figure is to be admitted in Scripture, where there is no ill or hurtfull sense following litterally. Now that externall and substantiall fire is denounced to the wicked in the Scriptures, and shall accordingly torment the damned in hell, what iniurie is it to the Christian faith, or what repugnance hath it with the rest of the Scriptures? We doe and must beleeue that Christ shall come to iudge the quicke and dead; and with his owne mouth shall openly adiudge the reprobate to 
               Matth. 25. 
               euerlasting fire, prepared for the deuill and his angels. What necessitie then is there to allegorize this fire? It is impossible, you thinke, for soules and deuils, which are spirits, to be punished with externall and corporall fire; and therefore the fire in your conceit must be figuratiue. Shall it be impossible to God, when he speaketh the word, to performe the deede; or is it too hard for you to conceaue the manner how it shall be done? I trust you take not vpon you to restraine the maruailes of Gods workes to the reach of your wits, or to measure the greatnesse of his arme by the weaknesse of your hand. How many thousand things are there in the creation, conseruation, and alteration of the world; in the aire, in the earth, and euery part thereof, which are daily before our eyes, and yet farre passe our vnderstanding? To tie Gods trueth and glorie to your capacitie, were madde deuinitie; to make any thing vnpossible for him, which his mouth hath spoken, were meere infidelitie. He that created spirits of nothing can as easily make them capable of paine and punishment from fire, or whatsoeuer meane pleaseth him to vse. But fire hee hath threatned vnto men and deuils. By fire therefore shall they be tormented, which his hand that is Almightie, and his mouth that is all true, shall perfourme in the sight of all the world.
            A second reason is, that Christ shall pronounce these words in Iudgement, where the guiltie must perceiue, what is their doome; the ministers must know, what they shall execute; and the elect must discerne what they are to approoue. Now allegories are exactly knowen onely to the speaker; the hearers, except they can search the heart, can not certainely knowe the meaning of figures and parables till they be expounded. Christs iudgement therefore shall be plaine and proper, and containe nothing in it that any way may hinder the present and euident conception, execution, or approbation of it. The end and vse of parables, which are allegoricall similitudes, ou

                Sauiour confessed when his disciples asked him, Matth. 13. 
               Why speakest thou to them in

parables. Who answered: because it is giuen to you to know the secrets of the kingdome of heauen, but to them it is not giuen. 
               Mark. 4. 
               To them that are without, all things are done in parables, that seeing they may see and not discerne, and hearing they may heare and not vnderstand. Then serue parables and allegories, which are both one, to hide the meaning of the speaker; and to darken the vnderstanding of the hearer. But the Iudgement of Christ hath cleane contrarie purposes; and must haue plaine and proper speech, that the whole world may heare it with their eares, vnderstand it with their hearts, and see it executed with their eyes. For how should allegories or metaphores be executed by Gods Angels, who shall be the ministers in that iudgement? or how shall all the elect concurre with Christ in iudgement, if he vse metaphores and allegories knowen onely to himselfe? It is euident therefore the generall and finall sentence by which the wicked shall be adiudged to euerlasting fire, must haue in it no figures nor allegories, but onely plaine and proper speech, which must be heard and vnderstood of all good and bad, and be presently put in execution by the ministers that attend that Iudgement.
            A third is, that where parables by reason of their darknesse must be expounded before they can be conceiued; when Christ doth declare the meaning of them, his exposition of necessitie must be in plaine and proper words, lest a darke and doubtfull exposition breed a further confusion in the mindes of the hearers, than the parable it selfe. The parable of the good seed sowed by the owner of the ground; and of tares sowed by the enemie; as also of the haruest and reapers; when the Disciples of Christ prayed him to declare vnto them; he expounded it in these words: Matth. 13. vers. 37. 
               The sower of the good seed is the sonne of man, the field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdome; the tares are the children of the wicked; the enemie that soweth them, is the diuell; the haruest is the end of the world; and the Reapers be the Angels. As then the tares are gathered and burned in the fire, so shall it be in the end of the world. The Sonne of man shall send forth his Angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdome all offences and the workers of iniquitie, and shall cast them into a furnace of fire, there shalbe wailing and gnashing of teeth. And vpon occasion of the parable of the draw-net cast into the sea, and gathering all kinds of men, and after seuering the good from the bad; our Sauiour repeating the same exposition in the same words (So shall it be in the end of the world; the angels shall go forth, and seuer the bad from among the iust, and shall cast them into a fornace of fire) sayd to his Disciples,Ibid. ver. 51. 
               Vnderstand ye all these things? and they sayd to him, Yea Lord. The parable they vnderstood not, but this they vnderstood. The fire therefore into which the wicked shall be cast, is no parabolicall, but a plaine and proper speech. Againe, Christ expoundeth the parable by it: it is therefore no allegorie, but a true and proper speech by which Christ opened the obscuritie of the parable; and his Disciples presently conceiued his meaning by the proprietie and perspicuitie of his words. Then, that 
               Matth. 13. 
               the Angels of God in the end of the world shall seuer the wicked; and cast them into a furnace of fire, is an euident, plaine, and proper speech, easie to be vnderstood of euerie Christian by the verie hearing of the words vttered, without recourse to you Sir Deuiser to helpe allegorize them; or to bring in stead of them the immediat soules suffering, which you still auouch, but neuer take the paines to proue, or vse the meanes to vnfold.
            Fourthly, your new conceit hath no coherence with the sense or words of the Holy ghost; but either he must correct his speech, wheresoeuer he mentioneth the fire of hell, or you must recall your fansie, who suppose an inward paine in the soule from the immediat hand of God to be hell fire. For if that which you call hell fire be only within the soules of the wicked, how can they DEPART, GO, or BE CAST INTO HELL FIRE, which by your imagination is cast into them, & not they into it? And therefore when our Sauiour so often affirmeth, that the wicked shall be cast into hell fire, and iudicially willeth them to depart from him into euerlasting fire; you must set him to schoole, and teach him to speake righter, and according to your opinion, to say, that hell fire shalbe cast into them. But if these be fooleries most vnfit for any

Christian man, to controll the sonne of God in his speech, and to condemne him of open and childish ignorance, as not knowing the difference betwixt an externall and internall fire; then learne to reuerence the veritie and grauitie of the word of God, and to confesse that he which seeth and setleth all things in heauen, earth, and hell, cannot so forget himselfe as to mistake the one for the other. For if the fire be a violent, externall, and locall agent into which the wicked shalbe cast; then are the words of our Sauiour and of the Prophets and Apostles most proper and pertinent to the matter: but if that fire which shall torment the damned, be nothing but an internall paine rising within the soule by the immediat hand of God; then are all the speeches of the Holy ghost, expressing their punishment, wide from the sense, and dissonant from the truth of that which you suppose they would deliuer. Dauid describing the vengeance that God at the last will execute on the wicked, sayth, Psal. 11. 
               Vpon the wicked God will raine snares, fire, and brimstone. This raining vpon them, sheweth that the meanes and matter of their torment shall be without them; and not an anguish onely rising within them, as you imagine of hell fire. Reuel. 20. 
               The diuell that deceiued them, was cast (sayth S. Iohn) into a lake of fire and brimstone; and whosoeuer was not found written in the booke of life, was cast into the lake of fire. The Holy ghost by your direction must haue sayd, the lake of fire was cast into the diuell, and into euery one that was not found written in the booke of life. Mark 9. 
               It is better (sayth our Sauiour) to enter into life maimed, than hauing two hands to goe into hell, into the fire that neuer shall be quenched. Our Sauiour by your doctrine is not well aduised so to speake, when he should haue sayd, It is better to enter into life maymed, than hell fire to goe into you. And when Christ foretelleth that the Angels shall seuer the badde, and cast them into a furnace of fire; he committeth two great ouersights by your new Diuinity: the first in saying, the Angels shall cast the badde into a furnace of fire; where indeed by your deuice the furnace of fire shalbe cast into the badde: the next in that he sayth, the Angels shall cast them into the fire; which hath no trueth in it, if the soules of the wicked inwardly suffer from the immediate hand of God alone, as you teach. For how do the Angels cast the wicked into the fire, when the immediate hand of God inflicteth that, which you call hell fire, on the soule without any instruments or inferiour meanes? These mockeries you must make of the Scriptures, before they will serue your new conceit, that hell fire is an allegorie, and importeth nothing but a paine raised within the soule by the immediate hand of God alone; which what agreement it hath with the doctrine and descriptions of the Holy ghost, I leaue the Christian Reader to consider.
            Fiftly, the word Gehenna, which Christ authorized in the new testament to signifie hell, hath no iust representation of hell, if there be no substantiall and externall fire in hel. For where anciently the children of Iudah Ierem. 7. 
               built the place of Topheth in the valley of the sonne of Hinnom to burne their sonnes & daughters in the fire 
               2. Reg. 23. vnto Molech; which valley the eighteenth of Iosue placethIosue. 18. vers. 16. neere to Iebusi (that was afterward Ierusalem) and calleth Gehinnom: and the chiefe councel of Ierusalem, whiles their power lasted, vsed to punish certaine offences with fire in the same valley lying neere to their citie: Our Lord and Master either taking the word that was vsuall among the people in his time to import hell, and establishing it with his authoritie; or resembling hell to the place of tormenting & burning malefactors with fire so wel knowen to the Iewes, nameth it Gihanna in Syriack; which the Hebrues call Gehinnam, the Euangelists 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , and the Latines Gehenna. In this application of the word, that the one might fitly resemble the other, three things were chiefly respected, as Peter Martyr rightly obserueth vpon the second chapter of the second booke of Kings. First that being a
               Pet. Martyr. in 2. cap. 2. lib. Regum. 
               valley, to wit, a lowe bottome, it resembled hell, which is beleeued to be beneath the earth. Secondly, for the fire, wherewith the wicked are tormented (in hell) euen as the children were in that valley burnt with fire. Lastly, the place was vncleane and detestable, whither all vile and lothsome things were cast out of the citie of Ierusalem, euen as defiled and wicked soules are cast out of the kingdome of heauen into hell. And howsoeuer you may quarrell with the first and last respects, because you thinke them not Canonicall, though I finde

them grounded on the Scriptures, if that were to this present purpose: the second is without contradiction the maine reason why our Sauiour tooke the word Gehenna to represent hell, and is expressed by himselfe when so often in the Gospell he addeth fire to the word Gehenna, and expoundeth the one by the other, that is, Gehenna by vnquenchable fire. Matth. 5. 
               Whosoeuer shall say foole (to his brother) shalbe worthy of the Gehenne of fire, that is, of the vale of fire, or of hell. And againe,Matth. 18. 
               It is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, than hauing two eyes to be cast into the Gehenne of fire, which is the vale or lake of fire, and hell fire. In the Gospel written by S. Marke Christ ioyneth the one as an explication to the other. It 
               Mark. 9. 
               is better to goe halting into life than hauing two feet to be cast into GEHENNA, into the fire that neuer shalbe quenched. So that the resemblance of true fire in either place, painfull to the sufferer and dreadfull to the beholder, was the chiefe respect, why our Sauiour allowed GEHENNA in the new Testament to signifie hell, and consequently doth assure vs there is true fire in hell. For if hell haue no fi e in it besides an inward and inherent paine of bodie or soule, as we see in all violent and burning diseases, Christ might more fitly haue resembled hell to any sharpe and sore sicknes

Therefore the iustice of God both temporally and eternally punisheth the soule (ONELY) by the bodie: Or therefore all the soules paine for sinne, both temporally and eternally is by the body.

            You begin and end with two notorious vntrueths and falsifications of my words; that at least you may make others beleeue, there is some likelihood in yours, when I dare not stand by mine, but am either afraid of them, or conclude directly against them. Doe I set my selfe to prooue, that in hell there is materiall fire; and yet am I now almost afraid so to call it? It is your wont (Sir Discourser) not mine, to take vp termes that may be turned euery way, and to plant your chiefe strength vpon the doubtfulnesse of their Signification. Doe I any where apply the word materiall to hell fire?

or doe any of the places which I cite, so call it? If they doe, name them; if not, how set I my selfe to prooue materiall fire in hell, without any words or proofes sounding that way? Know you my meaning without my words? or doe you boldly presume of my meaning against my words? If by materiall fire, you meane that which is maintained by wood or by such like matter as nourisheth fire, and without the which fire will quench; (for that is one of your chiefest obiections which you say is vnanswered:) then doe the places which I bring plainely prooue that hell fire is not materiall. For Lactantius sayth of it; Conclus. pa. 346. 
               It burneth of it selfe without any nourishment. And Gregorie; Ibid. pag. 345. 
               It is neither kindled with mans industrie, nor nourished with wood; but contrary to the nature of our fire, it consumeth not what it burneth, but rather repaireth what it eateth, as Tertullian sayth of it. So that neither my positions nor probations gaue you any cause to coniecture I meant your materiall fire. The places produced by me expresse the contrary: and mine owne words are; Ibid. pag. 343. 
               S. Austen long since hath plainly resolued, the fire of hell is not only a true fire, which were my words, but a corporall fire, that shall punish both men and diuels. And closing I make it Ibid. pag. 348. 
               a point of Christian doctrine deliuered by the Prophets and Apostles, and receiued by the Fathers of all ages in Christs church, that the fire of hell shall be visible and sensible to the bodies of the wicked, and shall eternally and corporally punish the damned according to their deserts. It was therefore your foolish obiection, that hell fire must be materiall, if it be not allegoricall according as you dreame; it was no resolution of mine, nor so much as mentioned by me. I saw the ambiguity of the word well enough, and for that cause did refraine it from the beginning For though materiall may be that which consisteth of matter and forme, and so all things that are corporall, as the wind, the aire, the heauens are likewise materiall; yet in our vulgar speech and vnderstanding, to which I framed my selfe, that is materiall fire which is nourished with some MATTER apt to burne and consume; and in that sense hell fire is no materiall fire.
            The end of your answer in this place is farre woorse than your entrance: for thereThe Defender grosly peruerteth my words. you wittingly and wilfully peruert my words by adding ONLY and ALL vnto them, directly against my meaning; yea when I openly admonish the Reader to the contrary. I inferred by occasion of former proofs; therefore the iustice of God both temporally and eternally punisheth the soule by the bodie: which words are most euidentlie true, since in this life without all question the soule is punished by the bodie; and after iudgement the bodie being cast into hell fire, shall eternally afflict the soule. My words then bearing in them a manifest trueth, you take the paines, by interlacing them, to wrest them to an open falsehood: for you make me say: Therefore the iustice of God both temporally and eternally punisheth the soule ONLY by the bodie. Now this is as false, as the former was true: for God in this life doth often punish the soule by her selfe; and vntill the last day it is as certeine the soules of the wicked departed hence are punished without their bodies; which so long lie dead in the dust of the earth. What conscience this is (for nothing in you must be impudence, though it be neuer so shamelesse) of an euident trueth to make a palpable errour, by adding (ONLY) to my wordes, which I carefully and purposely did auoide, let the Reader iudge.
            But the proposition inducing this conclusion you will say is generall; to wit, all prouocations and pleasures of sinne the soule taketh from her bodie, all acts of sinne she committeth by her bodie; the conclusion thereof you thinke should be likewise generall: therefore ALL the soules paines for sinne both temporally and eternally is by the bodie. Your thoughts (Sir Discourser) bewray your owne follie, they must not marshall my reasons; I can expresse mine intent without your helpe. Out of a generall assumption what Art hindreth me to auouch an indefinite and particular conclusion; especially when I meddle with Gods matters, whose power and will in iudgement no rules of reason can binde or limit? And if I would needs expresse the forme of a syllogisme (as you vainly imagine I meant to doe in these words) I neuer learned out of a negatiue for the maior, to draw an affirmatiue for the conclusion: but had not your eyes

stood in your light, it was easie for you to haue seene both what the conclusion must be by force of the premisses; and how in respect of him that is all-iust and yet allmighty, I thought not good to restraine him to my conclusions, but to inferre in sted thereof, that which sufficiently depended on the conclusion, and could haue no question either in holy writ, or dayly vse. Both the premisses are orderly and plainly set downe in my writing, and not loosely and ignorantly misplaced, as yours are, by putting the cart before the horse, and taking that for the maior which with me is a part or appendix of the conclusion. My words stand thus: Conclus. pa. 254. l. 29. 
               Nothing is more proportionable to Gods iustice, than to ioyne them in paine that were ioyned in sinne; and to retaine the same order in punishing, which they kept in offending. But all prouocations and pleasures of sinne the soule taketh from the bodie, all acts of sinne shee committeth by the bodie. What boy now knowing the first principles of Logicke doth not presently perceiue the conclusion must be; therefore nothing is more proportionable to Gods iustice than both temporally and eternally to ioyne bodie and soule in paine which were ioyned in sinne; and to make the bodie the instrument of her paine, as it hath beene of her pleasure. This conclusion is an vniuersall negatiue; and yet doth not exclude all paine of the soule without the bodie to be vnagreeable to Gods iustice, as you pretend I meane; but auoucheth no paine to be more agreeable, than where bodie and soule are both ioyned in suffering, as they were in offending. And because no punishment is more agreeable to Gods iustice, than where both soule and bodie are coupled in paine, as they were in sinne; though it be no way against Gods iustice to punish the soule for a season without the bodie: Ibidem. 
               Therefore (which is the inference that I vse) the iustice of God both temporally and eternally punisheth the soule by the bodie, that as it hath beene the instrument of her pleasure, so it shalbe of her paine. You affirme, not only my meaning, but my reason to be this; that God temporally and eternally punisheth the soule (ONLY) by the bodie. I vtterly denie that I haue any such reason, words, or sense; but that you purposely haue inserted the word (ONLY) of your owne, to make my reason seeme false and foolish; which otherwise is sound and sure.
            You mistooke (you will say) my meaning; you did it not of malice. Your mistakings (Sir Discourser) are indeed very grosse, as shall well appeare, when we come to your fairest forts; but in this (by your leaue) you could not mistake me, except you were bereaued of your wits and senses. I not onely prouided that my words should import no such thing, as you dreame of; but to cleere all cauils, when I had made some proofe out of Cyprian, Ierom, and Tertullian, for the second proposition of my reason, I moued the question my selfe, and answered it, with as plaine and precise a deniall as I could deuise to vtter. These are my words: Conclus. pa. 257. l. 12. 
               Do I then denie that the soule hath any sufferings in this life & the next, which come not by the body? BY NO MEANES. For though those conioyned sufferings be most answerable to sinnes committed; yet the soule hath some proper punishments in this life, as sorrow, and feare, when the bodie hath no hurt: from which Christ was not free, as appeareth by his agonie: and so in the next, the soules of the wicked haue griefe and remorse, besides the paine of fire. These punishments in this world and the next, the soule suffereth, not by her body, nor from her body: how then should I meane that God temporally and eternally punisheth the soule (ONLY) by the bodie, or that (ALL) the soules paine for sinne is from the bodie, as you make me to speake, both without and against mine owne words? Whether this dealing sauour of vnshamefastnesse, or no, iudge thou Christian Reader, as thou seest cause. The maner of the Discoursers carriage in the entring and ending of his answer, I might not omit. Now to his matter.
            The midst of his answer is a medley meet for a man of his learning and iudgement; the summe of it is this: Defene. pag. 146. l. 25. 
               All my proofs (out of the Fathers) runne to prooue corporall and materiall fire, except the Scriptures (by me alleaged) which vtterly prooue nothing at all. For his part he seeth no reason to beleeue, that now there is corporall fire in hell (which is only our question or els nothing) whatsoeuer shalbe heereafter, when the bodies shalbe tormented with their soules. Lastly, Austen here doth not proue there shalbe such sire (after

the resurrection) be only sheweth the maner how it may be so heereafter, if God will. Now if the power of God only be all our reason, we may as well proue the skie is fallen. All the rest of the Fathers say nothing further, nor indeed, so farre as Austen. Whether ten ancient writers, all Christian and Catholike fathers, relying themselues on the manifest words of holy Scripture, and ioyning in one confession of the trueth, be not more to be trusted and better beleeued than H. I. of Paules Chaine, let the poorest prentise in London iudge. As for the Scriptures; if you Sir Deuiser and such other busie heads may allegorize them, when they contradict your humors, from Genesis to the Apocalypsis, they shall vtterly proue nothing at all against you: for what is there in them which you may not peruert with your fansies and figures, if nothing shall be plaine and proper that any way seemeth vnsauourie to your reason? The Fathers haue for that which they affirme, the exact and euident words of holy Scripture, and not so few as Twenty Places of the New Testament witnessing, without any parables or allegories, fire to be threatened and performed to the wicked in the world to come. Whereupon with one consent they haue all resolued and professed it as a setled ground of Christian religion; that hell fire, to which Christ shall adiudge the wicked at the last day, shalbe a true, externall, and sensible fire; I meane seene and felt of all the reprobate in their soules and bodies. To this our new Patriarck of Pater-noster Rew answereth:Defenc. pa. 146. l. 37. 
               Austen doth not proue there shalbe such a fire; he only sheweth the maner how it may be so heereafter, if God will. Now if Gods power onely be all our reason, we may prooue aswell the skie is fallen. Gentle Sir, if so many vouchers from Christes owne mouth and from his Apostles following their masters steps, be no proofe with you, nor sufficient witnesse of Gods will, you haue some aduantage against S. Austen and all the rest of the Fathers for presuming vpon Gods power without the knowledge of his will: but if those proofs be more then pregnant, then looke to your allegories, lest they prooue you to be a proud presumer against the Scriptures, and an arrogant despiser of the Fathers, where they accord with the word and will of God. It is not enough for you (Sir Deuiser) to rowze your selfe, and say YOV SEE NO REASON; you must take the paines to yeeld good reason why you depart from the literall and proper signification of the words vttered by the sonne of God. And since you can pretend none but want of power in God to performe the words which he hath spoken in their proper sense; all the godly will see great reason to refuse your fansies and figures, as idle shifts to decline the cleerenesse of the sacred Scriptures.
            The Scriptures you sayDefenc pa. 146. 
               shew no more any corporall, or materiall, or true fire to be now in hell, than a corporall worme, materiall brimstone, much wood, and true chaines: which IWhat is meant by the worme that neuer dieth. called a sleeuelesse obiection; but neither I, nor Austen whom I cite against it, doth any where answere it.] Of the worme mentioned in Christes words (their worme neuer dieth) I shewed you S. Austens iudgement, which might content a farre greater Clerke than you. Neither is he alone in that opinion. Gregorie Nyssene sayth,Nyssenus de resurrectione Christs.

meanes he thinke the bodies in hell shall not be touched with the paine of fire; I left it likewise free for euery man to make his choise, and saw no need of farther answer.* Touching brimstone, you may iest at S. Iohn if you list, who saith of the wicked, they shall beReuel. 14.

For if God will haue brimstone mixed with hell fire to make it burne not onely the darker and sharper, but also the lothsommer, and so to grieue the sight, smell and taste of the wicked, which haue heere surfeited with so many vaine pleasures; what haue you or any man liuing to say against it? yea rather, why teach you not men to tremble at the terror of Gods iudgements, who can and will so fully punish all the powers and parts of bodie and soule, with one and the same fire in hell?

               kept vnto damnation, without any power to resist or decline the iudgement, which shall be pronounced on them. That God hath a Smith to make Iron chaines to bind the deuill, or a fueller to cut and fetch wood for hell fire, lest it should faile; these were such meriments to be concluded out of Scripture, that if you find no vanitie nor absurditie in them against the trueth and glorie of God, you may take the Legend or the Alcoran into your Creede, without any scruple of conscience: but if these things be more then sottish, then deserue your obiections a worse name then I gaue them.
            The Scriptures, you say, shew no more any true fire in hell, then true chaines and much wood. To suppose those things to be needefull for hell, which are prepared by the hands of men; is a very wicked and wilfull impietie. For so should hell fire quickly cease, which Christ hath said shall be euerlasting. And that the Scriptures prooue no more the trueth of fire there then they doe of wood, is an open, and arrogant vntruth. For first all the Fathers of Christs Church, and the soberest Diuines of our time, are condemned by this insolent assertion, as ignorant and absurd teachers, who confesse the trueth of hell fire to be established by the Scriptures, which of wood they do not. Secondly, the words of Christ and his Apostles, are chalenged to be false. For they in plaine speech affirme fire to be in hell, which of wood they doe not. Thirdly, the reason, whereupon the Defenders obiection is grounded, ouerthroweth all religion

in this life, and all reward in the life to come. For this is and must be the pillar whereto his obiection leaneth. The Scripture nameth fire, and so it nameth wood; and therefore it sheweth the trueth of the one no more then it doth of the other; but if the wood be figuratiue, so must the fire be. Applie this reason to the Church of Christ on earth, or to the kingdome of heauen, or to Christ himselfe, and see whether it will not vtterly subuert them all, and make all Gods promises and graces here and in heauen to be allegoricall, and not literally true. Of Christ God saith; Esa. 28. 
               Behold I will lay in Sion a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone. And of himselfe Christ saith, Iohn 15. 
               I am the true Vine. Were it not braue blasphemie to say, the Scriptures shewe Christ to be no more a true God, then a true Stone, or a true Vine, because they affirme of him all three? To his Church God saith, Esai. 54. 
               I will lay thy foundation with Saphires, and will make thy windowes of Emeraudes, and thy gates shining stones. All thy children shall bee taught of God, and much peace shall be to thy children: in righteousnesse shalt thou be established. Shall we say that wisedome, peace, and righteousnesse here promised to the Church are figuratiue, because Emeraudes and Saphires mentioned in the very same place must be figuratiuely taken? Christ saith to his disciples; Luc. 22. 
               I appoint you a kingdome as my Father hath appointed to mee, that you may eate and drinke at my table in my kingdome. Are all the rewards of the faithfull in the kingdome of heauen allegoricall, because this most apparantly is so? Proude and false therefore is that surly resolution of yours, Sir Discourser, who auouch the Scriptures shewe no more true fire in hell, then much wood, because the Prophet in one place nameth them both; and if your obiections be no better, let the Christian reader iudge whether there be any cause you should so earnestly call for an answere.
            But let vs view the place whence you fetch your wood to nourish hell fire; and see whether it make no more for the one then for the other. Against Senacherib that proud and blasphemous king of Assyria, the capitall and cruell enemie of Gods people and Church, the Prophet denounceth vengeance in this wise. Esa. 30. 
               The Lord shall cause the glorie of his voice to be heard, and shall shew the stroke of his arme with the anger of his countenance, and flame of deuouring fire, with scattering and tempest. For Tophet is prouided of olde, it is euen readie for the King: (God) hath made it deepe and wide, the burning thereof is fire and much wood: the breath of the Lord doth kindle it as a current (or riuer) of brimstone. Tophet was a place built by hand in the valley of Hinnom nere to Ierusalem, made deepe and wide to containe whole Pyles of woode which the Priests of Molech with their deuices and prouisions could readily kindle, and raize to huge and mightie flames, to inclose and consume the children that were presented to their Idole. To this place and vse the Prophet alludeth, when he threatneth the King of Asshur; and to comfort the Iowes that God had care ouer them, he assureth them, that Gods Tophet was prouided of olde, and readie for the King (of Asshur,) that it was deepe and wide (to receiue him and all his retinue;) and the burning thereof (as) the fire (of) much wood, the breath of the Lord kindling it as a flood of brimstone. That Tophet was a place in the valley of Hinnom, & a part of Gehinnom Ierem.

And to euery man meanely seene in the Hebrew tongue, it is a knowen Rule, that Caph the note of similitude is often vnderstood in the Scriptures; and then specially when it is added to one part of the Periode, for example; Psal. 11. v. 1. 
               Flie to your mountaine a bird, that is LIKE a bird. 
               Miche. 3 v 9. 
               Zion shall be plowed a field that is LIKE a field. 
               Gen. 49. v 9. 
               A Lyons whelpe Iudah from the pray shalt thou ascend; that is LIKE a Lyons whelpe. 
               Esa. 4
                     •…
                  . v. 6. 
               All flesh is grasse, and the glory thereof is as the flower of the field that is, all flesh is LIKE grasse. And in this place of Esaie it is so the rather,

because the aduerbe of similitude is expressed in the next member, where it is said, the breath of the Lord, LIKE a streame of brimstone, doth kindle it: which argueth that the former part must likewise be vnderstood the burning thereof is A s a fire of much wood which in effect is a mightie flame. This then being a comparison, what reason haue you, Sir Discourser, to pronounce, that the Scriptures shew no more true fire in hell then much wood; since fire was the maine respect why hell was likened to Tophet; wood was not, and without fire, hell is no more like to Tophet then it is to a bodkin; which if it be thrust into a mans body will raize paine enough. And therefore these amplifications must either vtterly be voyde, and import nothing knowen to the Iewes, or else there must be fire in hell as there was in Tophet, and that like the fire of much wood, which is violent and raging; and as a torrent of brimstone, which flameth all with fire, if it be once kindled. And since Christ called hell Gehinnam for the resemblance it had to the flames of Gehinnom as is before prooued; what maruaile if the Prophet speaking by the same spirite, compared hell to Tophet, which was the place in Gehinnom where the mightiest fires to burne men were made in his time?
            Or if we follow not the Chaldaie paraphrase to make wood a comparison, but leane to the later writers who make it a metaphore, and referre it either to the continuance of hell fire, or to the sinnes, soules, and bodies of the wicked feeding and nourishing the fire of hell, as wood doth our common fire; what gaine you by that? If one word in the sentence be figuratiue, will you conclude all the rest to be figuratiue? so may you as well anouch all the Articles of our faith to be allegoricall, because sitting at the right hand of God is a plaine allegorie. And are there no moe places in the Scriptures mentioning hell fire besides this of Esaie? Or if there be, as there be exceeding many, which haue no similitudes nor metaphores in them, will you allegorize them all, because this place of Esaie hath one similitude or metaphore in it? whether this haue any learning, reason, or sense in it let the Reader iudge.
            And because I haue mentioned the opinion of the latter writers, making wood aLater Diuines profess true fire to be in hell. metaphore in this place of Esaie, and yet confessing the fire of hell to be a true, substantiall, aud externall fire; I thinke it not amisse to let the Reader see, what diuerse of them, in true religion and learning not inferior to any of our time, haue professed touching either of these points. Peter Martyrs iudgement of GEHENNA we heard before, who maketh Pet. Martyr in 2. cap. 2. lib. Reg. 
               Tophet all one with GEHENNA and saith of Tophet: Esaie in his 30. Chapter calleth that place (of Gehenna) Tophet, and fire vnquenchable, as hauing much wood and brimstone to nourish it. The Prophet also setteth downe the breath wherewith the fire is blowne, that it may flame the more siercely. Munster in his Annotations vpon the 30. of Esaie saith Ma

                  eum; That (place or) habitacle the Prophet saith is all fierie, to let thee vnderstand, that the torment there is euerlasting. For the vncleane lustes of the mind, which here are not purged by faith, shall be the nourishment of that eternall flame IN STEEDE of wood and coales. And also the conscience (within) shall afflict the wicked as a kind of fire. Hell is perpetuall because the Spirite and will of the Lord giue euerlasting force of fire to it. Bullinger in his 90. homilie vpon the same Chapter. Bullinger homil. 90. in Esa. 30. 
               Our Prophet calleth hell Tophet, as our Sauiour called it Gehenna. And indeede Tophet or Gehenna did burne and flame with perpetuall fires deuouring their children, which seduced with a diuelish error, thought they offered them vnto God, when they offered them vnto the diuell. As then in Tophet wretched men were skorched with fire, so in hell all the wicked are tormented with euerlasting fire. Therefore hell is rightly called Tophet and Gehenna whose inside or burning is fire; that is, if thou aske what is in hell, there is fire and burning, or, whatsoeuer is within hell is nothing but fire. God perfourmeth that hell shall flame with perpetuall fire, euen as in many places and hilles of the earth an unwasted store of brimstone is found that euen thence we may gather there may be Riuers and lakes of brimstone in hell. All these things the Almightie knoweth how to prepare, that these torments may

                  itte both Soules and bodies, so that we haue no neede to dispute whether this fire and brimstone be corporall, and if it be corporall, how it worketh vpon spirituall substances. The Lord as I now said, can fit all these to either part (of man,) that in truth they may be inflicted as well on the bodies, as on the spirits of the damned, which here the Prophet foretelleth. If thou hadst rather dispute against them, and wilt not now beleeue these things, doubtles thou shalt one day trie them by experience. Gualter vpon the same place. Esaie

For so he describeth the sharpnes of the punishment, which the wicked shall there suffer. And lest any should aske, what matter can suffice to maintaine such a fire, the Prophet saith, there is great store of wood. He that made hell hath plentifully prouided, that the fire there shall neuer goe out. For filthie lustes and lewd actes not purged by

Yea and the bodies also of the wicked shall be incorruptible that they may suffer continuall fire and flame, and dure therein. He mentioneth also a streame of brimstone, whereof the Apocalypse speaketh, that we should remember and consider those things which are in nature; For so many ages hath the fire of Aetna continued and still doth, casting vp flames of brimstone. He then that kindleth these things (in nature) without the helpe or assistance of men, he also can kindle and maintaine the fire of hell, that it shall neuer faile. Musculus commenting vpon the 25. of Mathew sayth.Muscul. in Mat. cap. 25. 
               Those who measure all things by the rule of reason, and thinke nothing firme that cannot be comprehended by mans witte, dispute how it is possible, that the body should alwaies burne (in hell) and not consume, which is repugnant to the nature of the body. They likewise dispute how fire can burne not onely bodies, but also wicked spirits which haue no bodies. These curious men thinke that to be against nature, which is done by Gods will, neither doe they consider, the nature of all creatures to haue and be that, which they haue and are by Gods commandement. Others quarrell with the qualitie of the fire, and thinke it no corporall but a metaphoricall fire, which they take 
                     •…
                  or an exceeding paine and sorrow of minde. This they gather out of the 9. of Marke, where Christ saith, their worme dieth not, and the sire quencheth not. Here as by the name of worme no corporall worme is to be vnderstood, but a great and continuall remorse of mind; so they thinke by the word fire no corporall fire, but a metaphoricall must be conceaued. I take it to be rashnes and not the part of a christian man (thus) to dispute of the qualitie of this fire, but rather leauing the certaine knowledge thereof to the Iudge, to prouide that we trie it not one day, what manner of sire it is. Zanchius very soberly and learnedly examining this question resolueth in this sort. Zanchius de operibus dei part. 1. lib. 4. cap. 19. 
               It is certaine the diuels together with all the wicked shall be in euerlasting fire, and therein tormented. Christ plainely professeth he will say to the wicked depart into euerlasting fire prepared for the diuell and his Angels. What manner of fire it shall be I dispute not because the Scripture doth not expresse it; but this is without question, that not onely the soules of the wicked, but also their bodies shall suffer torment FROM THIS FIRE, and therefore the fire such as may worke vpon their bodies, and inflict on them a farre greater paine, then our materiall fire doth impresse on vs. What qualitie soeuer it shall be of, it seemeth it shall be altogether a corporall creature, which may worke vpon bodies and torment them. Which being so; IT IS MANIFEST the diuell shall suffer paine and torment from a corporall thing, I meane from this sire, and that euerlastingly; therefore it is called eternall and vnquenchable fire. And asking your question Idem in 1 cap. 2 epist. ad Thes. part. 3. Thesi. 4. 
               How is it possible, that spirituall substances should suffer from corporall, he answereth. We haue an example in our selues in whom the soule suffereth many things from the body by her coniunction with it. Againe, what can resist the power and will of God? Let this doubt therefore depart from the minds of the faithfull. I produce these later writers of great learning and good religion, as I might many moe, to let thee vnderstand gentle Reader, that I neither presse the Scriptures, nor cite the Fathers to any other purpose, but to that, which by all their iudgements is Christian and catholike; and howsoeuer some men otherwise learned, but carried with this new conceite of Christs suffering the essentiall paines of the damned, to colour their deuise, call these things in question,

yet the most aduised and sufficient Diuines of our age haue clearely confessed that which I teach, to accord with the holy Scriptures, and to be held of the godly without contradiction.
            The ancient Fathers of Christs Church vphold the same doctrine, and teach the fire of hell to be an externall, visible, and true fire, and not a spirituall and internall paine onely, as this Discourser intendeth. Chrysost. ad Theodor. laps. epist. 5. 
               With no speech (sayth Chrysostome) can any man expresse it here, but els where we shal see it most plainely. Set now before thine eyes that horrible way, which shal carrie (thee) headlong to the fire, and the (deuils) readie with torments, and the persons deliuered to such cruel tormentors. These things shalbe in that day. 
               August. li. 50. homiliarum. hom. 16. 
               Let vs alwayes thinke on these things (sayth Austen) lest it repent vs too late, when we come to the sight of eternal fire. For the burning pit of hell shalbe laid open, there shalbe a descent, but no ascent. 
               Basil. in psal. 33. 
               Call to minde (saith Basil) that terrible tribunal of Christ, which no creature may indure; there must euery one of vs be presented to render an account of his life. About those that haue liued wickedly shal stand fearefull and grisly angels beholding the sire and kindling it. Then shall they see a deepe gulfe, and darkenes that no eyes can pierce through, and an obscure fire that with blackenesse hath lost his shining, but kept his burning.

               Alas (saith Cyril) what a place is that where is weeping and gnashing of teeth, which is called hell, which the deuil himselfe abhorreth? Alas what a Gehenne of vnquenched sire is that, which burneth and shineth not? how venemous is that worme, which neuer resteth? how terrible is that deepe and euerduring darkenesse? how cruel in their torments are those mercilesse Angels? woe to the guiltie; when the innocent shalbe rewarded with honour, and they with shame. The innocent shal goe to Paradise, the nocent into fire vnquenchable. The sight of God shal cherish the innocent, the sight of fire shal torment the wicked. If the fire of hell be visible, it must needs be an externall and true fire: for internall and spirituall paines are inuisible. And therefore the Church of Christ hath alwayes confessed the fire of hell to be an externall and violent force of true fire tormenting the wicked; and condemned as an error in Origen, the conceit of an inward and spirituall fire in stead of hell fire, which this Defender is so much in loue withall.

               Scias detestanda tibi in cis esse quàm plurima, & iuxta sermonem Domini, inter scorpiones & colubros incedendum. This know, that there are very many things in them to be detested by thee; and as God speaketh, Thou must walke amongst Scorpions and Serpents. Where repeating diuers errours of Origen, hee layeth this downe for one of those that must be detested. Hiero. ibid. 
               Ignes quoque Gehennae & tormenta quae scriptura sancta peccatoribus comminatur, non ponit in supplicijs, sed in conscientia peccatorum, quando Dei virtute & potentia omnis memoria delictorum ante oculos nostros ponitur, ac praeteritas voluptates mens intuens conscientiae punitur ardore, & poenitudinis stimulis confoditur. The fire of hell also and the torments, which the sacred Scripture threatneth vnto sinners, (Origen) PLACETH NOT AMONGST (externall) PVNISHMENTS, BVT VVITHIN THE CONSCIENCE of sinners; when as by the vertue and power of God the remembrance of all our sinnes is set before our eyes, and the minde beholding her pleasures past, is punished with the fire of conscience, and pierced with the stings of (griefe and) repentance. This error Ierom more plainly expresseth, and sharply taxeth in his larger Commentaries vpon the Epistle to the Ephesians; whose words to preuent all cauils I thinke best to set downe in Latine as they lie, though they be large; for that they giue light to the former testimonie. Hier. in 5. cap. epist. ad Ephes. 
               Quia sunt plerique, qui dicunt non futura pro peccatis esse supplicia nec extrinsecus adhibenda tormenta, sed ipsum peccatum & conscientiam delicti esse pro poena, dum vermis in corde non moritur, & in animo ignis accenditur in similitudinem febris, quae non torquet extrinsecus aegrotantem, sed corpus ipsa corripiens punit sine cruciatuum forinsecus adhibitione: has it aque persuasiones & decipulas fraudulentas verba inania appellauit & vacua, quae videntur blandiri peccantibus, sed magis eos ferunt ad aeterna supplicia. Because there are many which say that there shall be no (externall) punishments for sinne, nor TORMENTS OVTVVARDLY INFLICTED, but that sinne it selfe, and the conscience thereof is punishment, whiles the worme doth not die in the heart, and a fire is

kindled in the soule after the fashion of a feuer, which doth not outwardly torment the sicke, but possessing the bodie ve

Hell fire by this resolution is a punishment OVTVVARDLY inflicted on the damned, and not an inward fire or paine kindled in the minde, and possessing the soule or bodie as an ague doth, which is an inward grieuance, but no externall violence; and the contrarie conceit of your spirituall fire in the minde to be hell fire, is heere condemned in Origen as a deceitfull and detestable error, hastning men to eternall torments.

As the flashes of lightning touch mens bodies, but consume them not, and as the fires of Aetna and Vesuuius and of other places of the earth doe burne, and not spend; so that flame appointed to punish (the wicked) is not fed with the decayes of those that burne, but nourished with parching their bodies that waste not.

Apparently then the fire of hell by the confession of all these ancient aud Christian writers is locall, as kept vnder the earth; externall, as inclosing the damned both men and diuels; and sensible to the eyes with obscure flames tormenting all the parts of the body with an horrible paine of burning, but not consuming them.
            And that the fire of hell shalbe an externall and true fire, what proofe can be fairer or fuller than that Scriptures and Fathers with one voice professe that Christ shall come to iudge the world in flaming fire, which shall2. Pet 3.

And Theophylact: (Christs) comming shall be in flaming fire, as Dauid professeth (of him): A fire shall goe before him, and shall burne his enemies round about. ForTheophylact. in 2. Thess. cap. 1. this fire shall offer burning to sinners, and no shining; but to the iust it shall giue light and shining and no heat or burning. The fire, I trust, which hath these two properties, to lighten the iust, and torment the wicked, is an externall and sensible fire; and with that fire Christ shall come to dissolue the heauens, melt the elements, and punish the wicked; neither shall the spirituall and internall paine of the soule, which the Discourser maketh his hell fire, come neere the Saints, or be ioyous and comfortable to any, as the fire of iudgement shalbe to the saints of God.
            Then all sorts of writers, Prophets, Euangelists. Apostles, and Diuines of all ages: Yea Philosophers, Poets, and Sibyls haue taught, the wicked shall

               e punished with true fire, and not with metaphores; and the Sonne of God in person hath confirmed the same; and all sectes, Iewes, Pagans, and Christians haue beleeued it; God taking speciall care as well by deeds as words that the truth and terror of his vengeance vpon sinne should not be vnknowen to all the world. For which cause he hath not only made the earth in many places as Aetna, Vesuuis, and else where to burne with perpetuall fire; but hath often destroyed sinfull persons and places with fire from heauen; to let all men see and know that the vengeance decreed. threatned, and executed on the wicked is sensible and true fire from God; which he hath made of all senseles creatures the most violent, potent and fearefull meanes to punish. Therefore did he Genes. 19. 
               raine fire and brimstone vpon Sodome and Gomorre when their sinnes were at full; & punished the people, that murmured at him, with fire; calling the name of the place Number 11 THABHERAH, because the fire of the Lord burnt amongst them; as likewise he sent Number. 21.

               The fire of God is fallen from heauen, and hath burnt vp (thy) sheepe and seruants and deuoured them. Which kind of vengeance Luke 9. Iames and Iohn the Disciples of Christ desired, when their master was repelled by the Samaritans and denyed lodging, as willing to haue that inhumanitie punished to the example of all others, but that they were repressed by him who came to saue, and not to destroy. Thus hath God often by true and sensible fire from heauen, declared and verified the certaintie of his generall and finall iudgement, when his Sonne shall appeare in flaming fire to render vengeance to all that know not God and obey not the Gospell; and that fire of Iudgement, which shall burne heauen and earth, shall shine to the Saints with ioy and comfort, and punish the wicked by tormenting them for euer.
            This you thinke is not against you: for you deny that Defenc. pa. 146. l. 35. 
               Now there is corporall fire in hell, whatsoeuer there shall be hereafter, when bodies also shal be there vnited and tormented with the soules, and this only is your question, or nothing. Many shifts you haue sent vs inWhether there be true fire in hell before iudgment is not the question. your late defence, which sauour neither of learning nor religion; but a slenderer then this you haue sent vs none. For first this is not the chiefe doubt, whether there be now in hell any true fire or no; which you say is your ONLY QVESTION or nothing: but what is the substance of damnation due to sinne, and what vengeance for sinne all the wicked must suffer in hell, not for a time but for euer; and we should haue suffered, had we not been redeemed; this is the right & maine point in question. For this is the full waight and burden of our sinnes, which you See the conclusion of my sermons fol. 339 say must be laid vpon Christ before we could be freed from it; and this is the proper payment and wages of sinne, which we should haue payed, had we not beene ransommed by the death of Christ; and therefore by your owne conclusions Christ must and did pay the same, which else we should haue payed. That which the damned doe presently suffer in hell, is not the full burden, nor iust vages of their sinnes; else the terror of Iudgement, as well as the taking of their bodies were wholy superfluous; if the true payment and full vengeance of their sinnes were executed on them before Iudgement. But the reprobat as well men as Angels are Epist Iud. vers. 6. 
               Reserued vnder darknes vnto the iudgement of the great day; and 2. Pet. 2. 
               Vnto DAMNATION (which) sleepeth not; though it be not already to the full performed on either. Againe, a great number of the wicked shall neuer trie the torments of the soule seuered from the body, because the day of Christ shall find them liuing, as the Apostle 1. Cor. 15. testifieth, and not part their soules from their bodies, but cast both ioyntly into hell fire, so that the vengeance of sinne before Iudgement which you would so faine fasten on, and make YOVR ONLY QVESTION, commeth too short of all your owne conclusions, and is excluded by the expresse words of your limitations in your late defence. For you subiect Christ to all Gods proper wrath and vengeance, so farre as was due generally for all mankinde to suffer. But the fire of hell before Iudgement, except it be the selfe same that also remaineth after iudgement, belongeth not by Gods iustice to all men in generall, by reason manie shall not suffer it but after iudgement. It is euident therefore that the fire of hell before iudgement is not your maine question, because it neither is the full wages nor vengeance of sinne, nor generally due to all mankinde; but the right and true question is touching hell fire after iudgement, wherein body and soule shall burne, feeling the torment and violence of euerlasting fire, according to the measure of ech mans sinnes.
            Howbeit, if we marke well the words of holy Scripture, this which you would so gladly make your question, is no question at all. For by the sentence of the Iudge it manifestly appeareth, that there is but one aud the same fire prouided for all the damned both men and diuels; and that fire not onely is euerlasting without end or change, but prepared and made ready before the day of iudgement, as the words of our Sauiour doe plainly import; who will say to all the wicked without exception: Matth. 25. 
               Depart from me ye cursed, 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , into (that) euerlasting fire, which is (alreadie) prepared for the diuell and his

angels. The article so often repeated suffereth the fire whereinto the wicked shall be cast, to be none other fire but the selfe-same that is euerlasting, and prepared for the diuels. The Participle of the Preterperfect tence argueth the time when that fire was prepared for the diuell and his angels, to be perfectly past before iudgement. Of the first there can be no question; August. de ciuitate Dei lib. 21. cap. 10. 
               Idem quippe ignis crit supplicio scilicet hominum attributus & Daemonum, dicente Christo, Discedite à me maledicti in ignem aeternum, qui paratus est Diabolo & Angelis eius. Vnus quippe ignis vtrisque erit, sicut veritas dixit. The same fire (sayth Austen) shall serue for the punishing of men and Diuels, Christ saying, Depart from me ye cursed into the fire euerlasting, which is prepared for the Diuell and his Angels. One fire shalbe to both, as the trueth hath spoken. The second, that hell fire is prepared before the day of iudgement, and abideth euerlasting from the time of the preparation without any new creating or altering at the day of iudgement, is as euident by the sacred Scriptures. Esay who liued and prophesied more than eight hundred yeeres before our Sauiour reuealed this doctrine, sayth of it, as we heard before: Esa. 30. 
               Tophet is prepared of old (or long since) the burning thereofis (as the) fire (of) much wood; the breath of the Lord, like a riuer of brimstone, doth kindle it. Our Lord and Master almost one thousand six hundred yeeres since, made the soule of the rich man in the sixteenth of Luke to say of hell fire, Luke 16. 
               I am tormented in this flame. And S. Iude proposing the destruction of Sodome and Gomorrhe, sayth; They 
               Epist. Iude. vers. 7. 
               are set foorth for an example, 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , (in or by) suffering the punishment of euerlasting fire. Where we see the fire which God rained from heauen on Sodome and Gomorrhe, is called euerlasting; and the inhabitants of those cities are affirmed by the Apostle (euen then when he wrate) to suffer euerlasting sire, for an example of the iust iudgement of God. It is therefore one and the same fire of hell that punisheth the wicked before and after iudgement, which was prepared long since, as Esay sayth, and is euerlasting, that is, not ending or changing into another fire, but increasing and kindling with greater fiercenesse at the day of iudgement, that all the wicked both men and angels may receiue a damnation answerable to their deserts, which in part they now feele, but then expect a sharper and sorer torment than yet is executed on them; which is the terrour of iudgement and fulnesse of damnation reserued for them.
            Then notwithstanding your sleights and shifts, Sir Discourser, that Christ suffered the substance and essence of hell paines, and that happily there shall be corporall fire after Iudgement, yet now there is no true fire in hell: we find it resolued by the Scriptures, and auouched by all the ancient Fathers, and the best learned Diuines of our time; that the fire of hell so much threatned in the Scriptures to the reprobate, is a true, substantiall, and externall fire, and the same that was prepared for the deuils euen from their fall, and doth and shal dure as well before, as after Iudgement for euer; into which the soules are, and at the generall resurrection the bodies of all the wicked shall be cast, there to burne with vnspeakeable and vnceaseable torments. And though I thinke it not fit for any man to take vpon him to deliuer the quality or force of that fire further then the Scriptures haue reuealed it; yet that is no iust cause to doubt the trueth thereof, or to preiudice the power of God, who hath spoken the word, as if he could not, or would not performe it; but rather for certaine to know, and confesse that God can punish the mightiest of his Angels by the weakest of his creatures; and as in sinning they haue exalted themselues by pride farre aboue their degree; so in punishing them for their sinne, God can and will depresse them as farre beneath their originall condition; to teach them that all their strength depended on his will and pleasure. So that we haue no neede to runne to the immediate hande of God alone, to make him the sole tormentor of spirits, (as this Discourser doeth) for extracting a new Quintessence of hell fire: the will and word of God, as it gaue to men and Angels all their power and force, so may it take the same from them swelling against him when he will; and subiect them to the force of any his creatures, which he can endue with might to performe his commandement against all the transgressours and despisers of his righteousnesse and holinesse.
            
            In summe we see that Christ suffered no part of that, which the Scriptures make substantiall and essentiall to the paines of hell and damnation of the wicked, I meane of that which is included in the sentence of the Iudge pronounced against them: but this Discourser, as he hath deuised a new kind of redemption neuer mentioned in the Scriptures, nor deriued from the blood of Christ; so hath he framed vs another hell, then the word of God reuealeth; and changed the whole course of the sacred Scriptures with his dreames and deuises, that though the text of holy writ doe no way fauour his sansies, yet by flying to allegories, and heaping vp a number of metaphores, he might entertaine some talke, when his proofes did faile. To vphold that Christ suffered the true paines of hell, before we could be redeemed by his death & bloodshed; he minced hell paines into substance and accidence, and least this geare should seeme grosse, he shadowed the substance of hell fire with figures and allegories; and sent vs at last to the immediate hand of God, for all punishment of sinne in the life to come; not vpon any iust ground or proofe out of Scripture, but because his Mastership knew not otherwise how to carrie his conceites cleanly, he vnloaded them all by tropes and metaphores vpon Gods immediate hand; from which onely (as he saith, though very vntruely) the Soule hath her proper and principall suffering. But examining the parts, we find no such metaphysicall substance of hell, as he pretendeth; no such metaphoricall fire, as he affirmeth; no such immediate hand of God, vexing Soules and deuils in hell, as he imagineth; we rather find the cleane contrarie; to wit, his circumstances to be of the substance of the Iudgement pronounced vpon the wicked; the fire in hell to be a true and substantiall fire; and by that, as by a peculiar meanes decreed by the will, strengthened by the power and reuealed by the word of God, the damned both soules and diuels to be perpetually punished and tormented, each of them according to their demerits; though the inward powers and faculties of the minde, shall not cease most grieuously also to afflict the damned and despayring spirits. And touching Christs sufferings, to which all this must be referred, and for which all this is discussed, we finde him most free from darkenes

You haue labored (Sir Discourser) in twentie pages of your Defence by many lame distinctions and false positions to shew vs the MANNER & MEASVRE of Christs suffering the paines of hell for the sin of man. The manner you made to be, Christs suffering them properly, yea onely in his very soule, from the immediat hand of God, euen as the damned do. The measure you tooke to be all Gods proper wrath and vengeance for sinne, yea the selfe same paines for their nature which are in hell. and which are extreamest and sharpest in hell. Your twelfth page told vs in plaine words,Defenc. pa. 12. l. 28. 
               These paines then in this very manner inflicted Christ felt; indeede not being in the locall hell; yet those being the selfe same paines for their nature which are in hell, yea which are SHARPEST in hell. And he discerned and receaued them properly, yea ONLY in his very soule. You beginne now to tell vs another tale, that you doc not contend to expresse what iust measure of Gods wrath, nor precisely in what manner it was reuealed and executed on Christ. Onely you know that what soeuer it was, Gods very wrath and proper vengeance for sinnes, though outwardly executed on

the bodie, could not but sinke in deeper, and so wound the soule properly yea chiefly. By a long processe you made vs beleeue the soules proper and immediat suffering must be from the hand of God alone, without inferiour meanes and instruments, and not from the bodie, because that kind of suffering is common to vs with beastes, and
               Treatis. pa. 18. li. vltima. 
               maketh not properly to our redemption. And so by your refined diuinitie, the stripes, wounds, blood and death of Christ, could not properly pertaine to the price of our redemption, by reason those sufferings which come by the body were common to Christ with beasts. Thus reuerently and religiously, to prooue your selfe a pure Christian, you resolued touching the bloodshed and death of Christ, sustained on the Crosse. Now as almost tyred with that blasphemous toy, and perceiuing how hard it would be to please the learned with this leauen, or to seduce the simple with these vnsauerie shifts, which haue neither foundation nor mention in the sacred Scriptures; you beginne to turne an other leafe, and to tell vs you doe not contend for the iust measure, nor precise maner of Christs suffering the wrath of God. Only you know that whatsoeuer it were (though you can neither prooue nor expresse what it was) Gods very wrath and proper vengeance for sinne, though outwardly executed on the body, could not but sinke deeper into the Soule, and wound the soule properly yea chiefly, though the anguish thereof bruised the bodie ioyntly also.
            
            It is well yet at last that you find your selfe ignorant of some things, and that you will not take vpon you to expresse in what precise manner, or iust measure the wrath of God was reuealed and executed on Christ. For whiles you broched those secrets more boldly then wisely or truely, you ranne your selfe out of breath, and brought neither substance nor shadow of holy Scripture to warrant your vanities, but daunced vp and downe with certaine licentious and ambiguous phrases of GODS PROPER VVRATH, MEERE IVSTICE, VERY VENGEANCE and such like flowers, neither confirmed by the Scriptures, nor so much as expounded by your selfe, but because you checke your owne presumption, I will spare it, and come to that which you professe your selfe so resolutely to know; that Gods very wrath and proper vengeance for sinne, though outwardly executed on the body (of Christ) could not but sinke deeper into the soule, and wound the soule properly, yea chiefly, though the anguish thereof bruized his bodie also. Wherein notwithstanding you keepe your accustomed phrases of Gods very wrath and proper vengeance, which you neither doe, nor dare describe by the parts thereof, that we may discerne the trueth of your speech; yet for their sakes that are simple, I am content shortly to examine what wrath from God, Christ suffered, as farre as the Scriptures direct vs, at whose hands he suffered it, and what he did, and must conceaue of those his sufferings.
            There is no question but power to feele, conceaue, and discerne by sense, reason,What wrath of God Christ suffered. or faith in man belongeth properly yea onely to the soule of man. Life, sense, and motion appeare in the body, and haue their actions perfourmed by the instruments of the body: but euen in them the power and force that quickneth and mooueth the body, and discerneth by the senses of the body, commeth from the soule, and so dependeth on the soule, that the soule departing from the body leaueth it voyd of all motion, sense and life. Then in all Christs sufferings, when any violence lighted on his body, the paine pearced into his soule, and his soule not onely fully felt the anguish thereof, but rightly discerned the fountaine whence, the cause why, and the meanes by which it came. Christ likewise knew himselfe to be endewed with such might and strength, that of him selfe he could not onely resist the whole world, if he would; but euen commaund and represse men and diuels. His ouerruling of seas, windes, and wicked spirits, and giuing his Disciples power ouer them is so euident and often in the Scriptures, that no Christian may be ignorant of it. After his agony in the Garden, with the word of his mouth he threw to the
               Iohn. 18. 
               ground the whole band of men, that came with Iudas to take him; and when by this meanes he had shewed him selfe not destitute of his wonted force and vertue, he voluntarily submitted him selfe, not onely to be bound and brought whether they would, but euen to be whipped,

mocked, wounded, hanged, and euery way vsed at their pleasure. Which he did not to satisfie their wicked rage, but to obey the will of his heauenly Father; who when he would punish the sinnes of men in the person of his owne Sonne, Matth. 26. 
               Deliuered him into the hands of sinners, from them to suffer Acts. 4. 
               whatsoeuer the hand and counsell (of God) had determined before to be done. For 
               Acts. 3. 
               those things which God before had shewed by the mouthes of all his Prophets that Christ should suffer, he thus fulfilled, by the malice of some, and ignorance of others, whom Satan incited, with the greatest contumely and crueltie they could deuise, to take Christs life from him. In all which Christ suffered nothing but what the Acts. 2. 
               determinate counsell and foreknowledge of God purposed and appointed should be done. For this was Iohn. 18. 
               the Cup which (his) father gaue (him) to drinke; and this was the Luke 22. 
               houre, and power of darknes, when the Prince of the world came against him, howbeit neither man nor deuill Iohn 19. 
               could haue any power at all against him, but what was giuen (them) from aboue. So that in all those wronges, reproches and paines which were offered and inflicted on him by the rage of Satan and the wicked, he saw the secret counsell and hand of God punishing our sinnes in his bodie, and by that meanes satisfiyng the diuine iustice that was prouoked by our transgressions.
            But no where doe the Scriptures deliuer that God with his immediate hand tormentedThe paines of hell were not the cause of agonie. the soule or body of his Sonne, much lesse that he impressed the very paines of hell and of the damned on the soule of Christ; which is your new found Redemption and satisfaction for the sinnes of men. By his agonie in the garden you boldly and rashly presume it; but by what logick you conclude it, neither doe I conceaue, nor can you declare. Christ was SORROVVFVLL and AFRAID in the garden, and began to be AMAZED; ergo, you thinke, he felt, or foresaw he should suffer the paines of the damned from the immediate hand of God. Well these may be your hastie thoughts, but this hath no ground in Arte, reason, nature, or Scripture. For many other things Christ might feare; and this of all other things he could not feare. How many things are there in God, when we approach his presence; how many things proceede there from God, when we aduisedly marke his counsels and iudgements, which may iustly ouerwhelme the weakenes of mans flesh with admiration and feare euen to astonishment? The brightnes of Gods glory, the greatnes of his power, the deepenes of his counsels, the sound of his voice, the presence of his Angels, the sight of his vengeance prepared, or executed on others how many good and perfect men haue these things strooken into feares and mazes? When Saint Iohn in the spirite sawe the shape of the sonne of man and heard his voice, he 
               Reuel. 1. 
               fell downe as dead for feare. When Daniel had seene the vision of the goat and the Ram, he was Daniel. 8. 
               afraid and fell vpon his face, yea he was stricken and sicke certaine daies being astonished at the vision. When the parents of Sampson saw the Angell ascend toward heauen in the flame of the Altar, they 
               Iudic. 13. 
               fell on their faces to the ground; and one of them said, we shall surely die, because we haue seene the Lord. When a light from heauen suddainly shined round about Paul, as he was trauayling to Damascus, he 
               Acts 9. 
               fell to the earth trembling and amazed. When Isaac perceaued that he had ignorantly blessed Iacob in steede of Esau, he was 
               Genes. 27. 
               stricken with an exceeding great (feare and) trembling. When the people saw the Creeple walking, that was dayly layd at the gate of the Temple to aske almes, and knew him to be the same man that before was lame from his mothers wombe, they were 
               Acts 3. 
               amazed and sore astonished at it. Ieremie lamenting the miserie of the Iewes, sayth; I am sore 
               Ierem. 8. 
               vexed for the hurt of the daughter of my people, I am heauie, and astonishment hath taken me. Euen as the Apostle also witnesseth of himselfe; Rom. 9. 
               I speake the trueth in Christ, and lie not; I haue great heauinesse and continuall sorow in mine heart, for my brethren that are my kinsmen according to the flesh. If visions and Angels from God, if the works and iudgements of God executed on others haue driuen the best men to frights and agonies, what maruell then if the humane nature of Christ presenting himselfe in the garden vnto the Maiestie of his Father to be the Ransommer of mankinde, and with his owne smart to satisfie the iustice of God for the sinne of the world,

and no way ignorant how weighty that burden, and how mighty the hand of God was, to whose will he must and did wholly submit himselfe; what maruell I say if the weaknesse of our flesh in Christ beganne to be afrayed and astonished at the iudiciall presence and power of God, at the perill of man if he were deserted, and price to be payd for him before he could be redeemed? not that damnation or destruction were prepared or purposed for him that should saue vs; but for that the hand of God was infinitely able without hell and the paines thereof to presse and ouerpresse the manhood of Christ by whatsoeuer meanes he would.
            This, you will say, is the paines of hell, and the very same, yea all that which the damned do suffer.] In deed Sir Discourser? doth your skill serue you to make a religious submission to the Maiesty of God, and an holy confession of his most mighty power euen with feare and trembling, to be all that the damned now suffer, or the selfe same paine which is sharpest in hell? Doe not the godly at all times when they enter into the iust consideration of themselues, presently see their owne infirmity and indignitie, and thereby fall with feare and trembling to confesse all sanctitie, glorie, might, and maiesty to be Gods, and themselues to be not only earth and ashes, but euen sinfull and hatefull vnto God, if he be not gracious and mercifull vnto them? And will you call these faithfull meditations of Gods children giuing vnto God his due, the paines of hell and state of the damned, because the sense of their weaknesse and vnwoorthinesse breedeth in them feare and trembling? Then make heauen as touching the essence thereof all one with hell, and saluation in substance to be the same that damnation is, because the best learned Fathers confesse, that the Angels in heauen doe and shall tremble at the voice and iudgements of God.

               comming from the heauens (to iudgement) euery creature shall tremble, saith Basil: the Angels themselues shall not be without feare. for they also shall be present, though they shall giue no account to God. At that day (sayth Chrysostome) Chrysost. ep. 5. ad Theodorum lapsum. 
               all things shall be full of astonishment, horror and feare. A great feare shall then possesse euen the Angels, and not the Angels only, but the Archangels, and Thrones, and powers of heauen, because their fellow seruants must vndergoe iudgement for their liues led in this world. Will you hence conclude that the Angels and Archangels are or shalbe then in the paines of hell, because they do and shall tremble at the sound of Gods voice, and sight of Gods wrath to be executed on the world? No more may you inferre that Christ did or should suffer the paines of hell and of the damned, for that his manhood began to feare and tremble either at the maiestie of God sitting in iudgement; or at the power of his iustice able to punish by what meanes, and in what measure pleased him; or at the weight of our sinnes, for which he did vndertake; or at the sharpnesse of vengeance layd vp in store aswell for the Iewes as all other vnbeleeuers, that should neglect the saluation then to be purchased by his death and passion; since the person of Christ being God and man was farre more assured and secured from hell and damnation, than either the Saints or Angels of God are, or can be.
            At least then, you thinke, Christ feared and felt the wrath of God due to our sinnes, though outwardly executed on his bodie.] From Christes Agonie, which might haue diuers causes, and whereof the true cause is not reuealed vnto vs by the Scriptures, as I haue alwayes sayd, so I now repeat it againe; you can conclude nothing for your paines of hell to be suffered in the soule of Christ through the immediate hand of God. They are your blind and bold deuises, (I must not say lewd and wicked, because you are so tender, you may not be touched) to bring the true paines of hell, yea the sharpest and extreamest of them into this life; and to make the substance of hell nothing but a certaine paine inflicted onely on the soule by the immediate

hand of God: which you thinke Christ suffered in the garden, where you say, he Defenc. pa. 17. l. 1. 
               felt as extreame sharpnes of paine, as may by any possibilitie be endured yea though in hell it selfe; and yet this Ibidem. pa. 21. l. 7.

            To say that Christ suffered this kinde of wrath, which is the true and proper wages of sinne, is horrible and hellish blasphemie, which I hope no Christian man will aduenture. From the spirituall death of the soule, which is the Rom. 1. 
               wrath of God reuealed

from heauen against all vngodlinesse and vnrighteousnesse of men, and bringeth with it the losse of all grace and goodnesse in this life, and consequently leaueth the pollution and dominion of sinne in the soule of man, our Lord and master must be as free as from damnation; the one being alwayes a necessary consequent to the other. Displeasure and wrath against Christes person God neuer had, nor could haue any; Christ being his owne and only sonne, and so deerely beloued, that for his sake Gods most iust and most heauie wrath against the sinnes of all his elect did calme and asswage: for Gods inward loue doth not admit contrarieties or changes as mans doth; all Gods counsels, wayes, and wo kes being absolutely perfect and constant, chiefly towards his owne sonne, whom he naturally, infinitly, and euerlastingly loueth in the same degree that he doth himselfe; and therefore no more possible there should be in god any displeasure or dislike conceiued of his sonne for bearing the sinnes of the world, or for what cause soeuer, than of himselfe. And since the humane nature of Christ was by Gods owne wisdome, will, and worke, ioyned into the vnitie of the person of his sonne, and made one and the same Christ with his Godhead; no cause, nor course whatsoeuer could alter or diminish the exceeding loue and fauour of God towards the very manhood of Christ; but as God did inseparably knit it to the person of his sonne, so did he make it fully partaker of that infinite loue wherewith he embraced his sonne. To confirme this to all the world: God did often from heauen pronounce with his owne voice, Matth. 3. 
               Matth. 17. 
               This is my beloued sonne in whom I am well pleased; as he forespake by his Prophet, Esa. 42.

                but most meritorious and acceptable to God, the Author, and accomplisher of mans Redemption by this meanes; what cause could Christ haue to doubt of his fathers loue towards him, or of his fathers approuing and

accepting his office and seruice tending wholy to the perfourming of Gods will, and aduauncing of Gods glorie?
            But God was angrie with our sinnes, though not with his sonne; and that Anger Christ must beare, before we could be freed from it.] The more Angrie God was with our sinnes, the more contented he was with the person of his Sonne and euery part thereof, that submitted himselfe to the purpose and pleasure of God to appease his wrath kindled against our offences. And that Anger Christ did vndertake to quench, by satisfiyng the iustice of God in such sort as seemed best to God himselfe, and not by frustrating or declining it, nor by suffering the substance of the same destruction and damnation which was due to vs. Yea this very point of Christs obedience and patience, enduring and so vpholding Gods iustice according to Gods owne will, (respecting who he was that in this wise submitted and emptied him selfe) was farre more contenting and pleasing to God, then if the whole world had beene condemned for sinne to hell fire. For God delighteth not in the destruction of the wicked, but in the obedience of his Sonne he tooke infinite delight; not reuenging him with rage as an enemie, but imposing a fatherly correction on him for our sinnes; which in his person could extend no farder, that is, to none other kinde of death; and in ours would haue beene the eternall destruction of body and soule. Wherefore the wisedome and goodnesse of God chose out the person of his owne Sonne purposely; that neither our sinnes might be remitted as trifles skant prouoking his Anger, nor his Iustice meete with such as no way deserued to be respected or spared; but that the burden of our sinnes might be translated from vs, who were vnworthy of all fauour, and lye vpon the shoulders of his owne Sonne, whom in all iustice he must and did most highly loue and tender; and therefore could award no farder or other punishment against him for our sinnes, then might stand with the moderation and affection of a father, and try the obedience and submission of a sonne. Sharpe was the chasticement of our peace on that part of our Sauiour which was capable of paine and smart, least God should seeme to dally with our sinnes; but not such as either exceeded his strength, or any way chaunged or called in question Gods fauour towards him. And so our Sauiour conceaued and resolued of all his sufferings, that by Gods iustice they must haue in them griefe and anguish very painfull and offensiue to his humane nature, because our sinnes were very lothsome and displeasing to Gods diuine nature: yet so that nothing should be laid on him, which might ouerwhelme or endanger his obedience or patience; and that Gods purpose in so doing was to abolish sinne, and abate his wrath, his iustice being thus satisfied in the person of Christ Iesus: and not to execute on his owne Sonne the fulnes of that vengeance which was prepared for sinne in men and Angels.
            And where the Discourser prateth so much of Gods VERY wrath, and PROPER vengeance for sinne, to be executed on the bodie and soule of Christ; if he meane the very same wrath and vengeance which is prepared for deuils, and shall be executed on all the damned; he openly blasphemeth. For then must the Sonne of God be euerlastingly adiudged to hell fire as they are. If hee flie to the substance and essence thereof; he foolishly cau

               lleth, or vainely seeketh to shift his hands of open impietie. For if by substance and essence of hell fire prouided for sinne, he meane only a sharpe and extreame paine; then by this childish sophistrie, an headach, or toothach, a fit of an ague, or pang of the stone, if the paine be sharpe, are in substance and essence all one and the very same, which the damned now suffer in hell; since he is no way able to prooue that God is the immediate tormentor of soules in hell. But thus to mocke and delude the dreadfull Iudgements of God against sinne, and to play with the person of Christ in so waightie matters of our saluation, is fitter for Pagans then Christians; and well this Discourser may multiply the miste of his words, but he shall neuer be able thence to der

For the bodies of the damned suffer hell fire, which Christs did not; and their Soules apprehend that God is their enemie, and not onely hateth them, but hath reiected, accursed, and condemned them for euer; which to imagine of Christs soule, is to charge him with plaine Infidelitie and Apostasie.

Since then God could no way be displeased with the nature, office, or action of Christ in offering himselfe a ransome for man, which God himselfe first decreed before all worlds, promised by his Prophers, published by his Angels, testified by signes and wonders, and confirmed with his owne voyce from heauen; and the sufferings of Christ were tempered with Gods loue, proportioned to Christs strength, supported with

               bare our sinnes in his body on the tree; by those sufferings before and on the Crosse which the Scriptures expresly declare and describe. And as for the immediate hand of God tormenting the soule of Christ with the selfe same paines which the damned now suffer in hell, which is this deuisers maine drift; when he maketh or offereth any proofe thereof out of the word of God, I shall be ready to receiue it, if I can not refute it: till then I see no cause why euery wandring witte should imagine what monsters please him in mans redemption, and obtrude them to the faithfull without any sentence or syllable of holy Scripture. I haue no doubt but all the godly will be so wise, as to suffer no man to raigne so much ouer their faith with fancies and figures, vnwarranted by the Scriptures, vnknowen to all the learned and ancient councels and Fathers, vnheard of in the Church of Christ till our age, wherein some men applaude more their owne inuentions then all humane or diuine instructions.
            The feare of bodily sufferings you thinke could not be the cause that thereDefenc. pag. 12. l. 35. 
               strained out from Christ much sweat of clotted blood.] You straine the text of the Euangelist to draw it to your bent. Saint Luke hath no such words, that there strained out from Christ much sweat of clotted blood: he sayth, ChristesLuc. 22. 
               sweat was like drops of blood trickling downe to the ground. Theophylact a Greeke borne, and no way ignorant of his mother tongue, expresseth Christes sweat in the garden by these words, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , Christes body or face DISTILLED with plentifull drops of sweat. And albeit

                in comparison with thinner, or eminent in respect of plainer. Now Christes sweat might be thicke by reason it issued from the inmost parts of his bodie, and was permixed with blood, or els it might breake out with great and eminent drops, as comming from him violently and abundantly, and being coloured with blood and congealed with colde, might trickle downe like DROPS or strings of blood vpon the ground. Howsoeuer, the Scripture saith not his sweate was clotted blood, but like to congealed or cooled blood, neither that such clots were strained out from him, but that his sweate being thicked and cooled on his face, fell from him like strings of blood. But grant there could be no reason giuen of Christs bloodie sweat in the garden, no more then there can be of the issuing first of blood, and then of water out of his side when he was dead; which S. Iohn doth exactly note as strange but yet true; will you conclude what please you, because many things in Christ both liuing and dying we

               e miraculous? I bind no mans conscience to any probabilities for the cause of this sweate, but onely to the expresse wordes and necessarie consequents of holy Scripture, and yet I wish all men either to be sober and leaue that to God which he hath concealed from vs, or if they will needes be gessing at the reason thereof (for certaine knowledge they can haue none) by no meanes to relinquish the plaine words or knowen groundes of holy Scripture, to embrace a fansie of their owne begetting.
            The learned and ancient Fathers haue deliuered diuers opinions of this sweate, which thou mayest see (Christian Reader) in my Sermons, and which we shall haue occasion anon to reexamine: euery one of them being (as I thinke) more probable and more agreeable to Christian pietie, then this Discoursers dreame of hell paines, or Gods immediate hand at that present tormenting of the soule of Christ. And if we looke to the order and sequence of the Gospell, we shall finde that feruent zeale extreamely heating the whole bodie, melting the spirits, thinning the blood, opening the pores, and so colouring and thicking the sweate of Christ, might in most likelihood be the cause of that bloodie sweate. Which S. Luke seemeth to insinuate when he saith, that after Christ was
               Luc. 22. 
               comforted by an Angell from heauen, (and so recouered from his former feare, and freed from suffering hell paines, wherein there is no comfort) he prayed more earnestly, (or ardently) and his sweate was (in colour and consistence) like drops (or strings) of blood trickling downe to the ground. So that feruencie

in prayer is set downe next before that sweate in the Gospell, as a precedent or cause thereof. Howbeit I onely barre the boldnesse of this deuiser, who presumeth what pleaseth him of Christs bloodie sweate in the garden, because the Scriptures doe not exactly mention the cause; and thinke it no reason to let him build on a blinde coniecture, a false conceit of his owne without any warrant of holy Scripture.
            But I am repugnant to my selfe, and some whereDefenc. pag. 13. l. 27. 
               I hold that Christ suffered no more but meere bodily paines, that is in his soule from and by his bodie.

Indeed I euery where defend that Christ suffered no death expressed or mentioned in the Scriptures, saue onely the death of the bodie; from other passions or sufferings of the soule, as feare, sorrow, shame, and such like, I doe not exempt the soule of Christ, when he sustered for our sinnes; though I leaue no place in him for the feare of damnation, sting of conscience, despaire or doubt of Gods fauour, and such other shipwrackes of all faith, hope, patience, and pietie. The Crosse, death and blood of Christ when I name, I vse those words as the Scripture doth, to declare the whole maner and order of his passion from the garden to the graue, as it is described in the Euangelists; not excluding either the feare or agonie, which befell him before he was apprehended, but comprising within his death his obedience and patience in all those as

And this is no wauering in mee, to retaine the words of the holy Ghost in their right sense and vse; but it is rather a childish dalliance in you, Sir Discourser, to suppose that the death of Christ doth import no more but the very act of giuing vp the ghost; or els if I by that worde designe the rest of Christs sufferings endured at the time of his death by the witnesse of holy Scripture, you will also hemme in your hell paines within the list of the same wordes, though the Euangelists name or note no such thing in all the historie of Christs pass

In the wicked, Gods holinesse hateth the euill deede, and the doer; that is, both the sinne, and the sinner; and by his iustice without all loue or fauour towardes them awardeth a punishment against them according to their deserts; which the power of God doth execute on them, not respecting their strength, but rather inabling them to continue in perpetuall torments of bodie and soule in hell fire for euer: Gods purpose being onely to reuenge sinne in them, and to destroy them for their sinnes; which is most holy and righteous in him, though it be neuer so grieuous and intollerable to them. Gods iust and full iudgement against sinne, where and when it pleaseth him to inflict it, is the depriuing bodie and soule of all outward and inward peace and grace in this life for the time, and the reiecting of both from all blis

               e of God and of all his blessings prouided in this life, and the next for his elect. These causes and parts Gods anger hath against the wicked for their sinnes, and to euery of these the Scripture beareth witnesse.
            In Christ Gods holinesse infinitely imbraced the humilitie, obedience, and charitie of his Sonne offering himselfe to be the ransommer of man, and perfectly loued the integritie, innocencie, and puritie of his manhood created, called, and anointed of God to this intent and end, that his death and bloodshedding should be the redemption of the world, though God vtterly hated the sinnes of men, which his sonne then assumed into the bodie of his flesh to beare the burden of them, when wee could not.

Wherefore Gods iustice finding the loue of the Father towards his Sonne, farre to exceede the hatred of the Creator against the vncleannesse of his sinfull, but sedused creature, did relent from the rigour of that iudgement, which was prouided for sinne in Angels, and with a fatherly regard and respect to the meanest part of the pe

This correction though very sharpe yet not ouerpressing the patience of Christs manhood, Gods iustice would not release to his owne Sonne, least he should seeme to make light account of our sinne, (if it were remitted onely for prayer and intreatie) and without iust cause so terribly to punish the sinnes of the reprobate with all kinds of death, I meane corporall, spirituall, and eternall. And greater or other death, then the death of the bodie, God by no iustice could impose on the person of his Sonne, since Christ could not be subiected to sinne, which he must cleanse and abolish in vs; much lesse be reiected from euerlasting

            Against the tenor and effect of this Christian confession, which I referre to the iudgements of all that be learned & rightly instructed in the sacred Scriptures, I neuer speake any one word to my knowledge; I cannot in euery sentence repeate euery circumstance, nor of euery page make a paire of Indentures, much lesse may I forsake the forme of holsome words deliuered in the Scriptures. But the maine summe and scope of this doctrine being so fully declared and so often repeated by me, I had no reason to feare the capacity, or doubt the memorie of any heedfull Reader. And howsoeuer some shallow trifler may picke out a word heere and there to carpe at, yet are there so many cleere places to direct all doubts, that no man needeth to stumble, but he that will not or can not stand vpright. For let the Christian Reader looke but to the marke at which I aime in euery place, and remember these two rules; that of three sorts of death, which onely are mentioned in the Scriptures, as the wages of sinne, to wit, corporall, spirituall and eternall death; I alwayes remoue the two last from the person of Christ by describing or naming the first, which was his corporall death? and in that I conteine the whole course and maner of his death, that is, the feares, forrow

               re worthy to be challenged: but if I say no more than the Scriptures do warrant me to speake, looke you Sir Discourser to your late created Creed that can not admit nor endure the words of the Holy Ghost. That the true sacrifice for sinne was but ONE and ONCE made, and that it required the BODIE, BLOOD, and DEATH of the Offerer, is not my addition, but the Apostles assertion. Christ Heb. 9. vers. 26. 
               appeared (sayth Paul) in the end of the world once to put away sinne by the sacrifice of himselfe; and by reason he was an high Hebr. 7. vers 17. 
               Priest after the order of Melchisedech, and a 
               Heb. 8. vers. 2. 
               Minister of the true Tabernacle and Sanctuarie, it was of necessitie he should haue somewhat also to offer, 
               Heb. 10. 5. 
               Wherefore when he commeth into the world, he saith (to God) Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a bodie hast thou ordained me. 
               vers. 7. 
               It is written of me that I should doe thy will O God; 
               vers. 10. 
               by the which will we are sanctified (sayth the Apostle) euen by the offering of the body of Iesus Christ once. Who after he had offered (this) vers. 2 
               one sacrifice for sinne sitteth for euer at the right hand of God. For with (this) vers. 14. 
               one offering hath he (consecrated or) made perfect for euer them that are sanctified. That likewise without Heb. 9. 22. 
               effusion of blood there is no remission, and therefore Christ with his 
               vers. 12. 
               owne blood entred in once vnto the holy place, and obtained eternall redemption; as also that the vers. 16. 
               death of the testator must be, where a testament is; in either of these the Apostle is euident and vehement. Now if you (Sir Discourser) can conuey these things to the soules proper and immediate suffering the paines of hell from the hand of God, and shew how these resolutions of the Apostle perteine properly yea only to the soule of Christ; we shal greatly woonder at your wisdome. For thereby shall you prooue, that the soule hath not only a body, but blood also that may be shed, which are miracles, I will not say monsters, both in Scripture and nature. Luk. 24. 
               A spirit (sayth Christ) hath no flesh and bones, as ye see me haue. If you can teach Christ that he neuer knew before, by my consent you shalbe allowed for more than a Creed-maker. Howbeit, you will marre your owne market in so doing. For if the soule consist of bodie and of blood, what shall become of her proper and immediate facultie, of suffering without and besides the bodie, which you so highly aduanced in the beginning, as to make it the proper and principall humane suffering? If you shrinke from these follies or rather frensies, as I hope you will, then must you grant the ioynt sufferings of Christ, I meane the wounding of his body and shedding of his blood euen vnto death, as the Scriptures describe it, to be the true sacrifice for sinne, and consequently most auaileable for our saluation. If you thinke I exclude the soule of Christ from her part in this bodily and bloody sacrifice of Christ; I haue so often said and shewed the contrarie in my former reply that I am weary of iterating one and the same thing, though you be neuer weary of mistaking it. My former words I repeat againe, that the Reader may see, I haue no cause to recant or controle them. Conclus. pa. 352. l. 19. 
               The true sacrifice for sinne which Christ offered, must haue the body, the blood, and the death of the offerer; none of which agree to the soule of Christ, though the body without a soule could be no reasonable sacrifice; and therefore I exclude not the soule, whose obedience, innocence, and patience concurred to sanctifie this sacrifice, but I note the parts of the sacrifice for sinne by the Apostles doctrine were those, which I named, the blood and death of the Sacrificer, both which must needs be found in his bodie, and not in his soule. These words you quote in the margent, but you take not the paines to refute them, much lesse to establish your vnbloody and vnbodily sacrifice of Christs soule suffering hell paines from the immediate hand of God. Which kind of

offering for sinne is as strange to the Scriptures, and to all the learned and auncient fathers as the rest of your vnknowne doctrine. And therefore you doe well to straine still on the same string by censuring what you mislike, and neuer proouing what you affirme, least you should marre your musicke, if you should proceede to the parts or proofes of your new found Redemption by the paines of hell.
            Yet Defenc. pa. 14
               somewhere I seeme to yeeld wholy as much as you affirme; as where I say, the same part indeede might suffer in Christ which sinned in man, I meane the soule.] Somewhat it is you find so many writers new and old on your side; you here no sooner the sufferingChrist might suffer in s

                  le and yet not hell paines. of the soule, or the anger of God against sinne in any man, but you presently count him vnder your coulours. Euen as I make for you, when I write against you, so doe the Auncient fathers, and later Diuines, whose names you abuse. [But if Defenc. pa. 14. l. 21. 
               I meane as I ought, then at least I follow your meaning.] It is a peece of your skill, when I speake directly against your fancies, to make men beleeue I meane as you doe, or at least I ought so to meane. Indeed if you may be vmpeere what I ought to meane, I shall be sure to iump with your meaning; but looke to my words good Sir and measure my meaning by that which I speake, and not by that which you would haue me speake. I said Christs soule might suffer for sinne: what collect you thence? I did not adde without or with the body, so that all the sufferings of Christ inflicted on his body might be and were impressed in his soule, and you nothing the nearer to your purpose of hell paines suffered in the Soule of Christ. But graunt the soule of Christ did suffer for sinne without concurrence of the body; must it needs follow, he therefore suffered the paines of hell? how many griefes and paines of the soule are there, not proceeding from the body, which are nothing like nor neare the paines of hell? For example in harty and true repentance how great is the griefe and paine of euery part and facultie of the soule detesting and abhorring sinne, and fearing and feeling the power of Gods wrath? and yet I trust ech penitent person doth not suffer the paines of hell. Feare, griefe, and sorrow then, the soule of Christ might deepely tast when he suffered for sinne, and yet be farre from the paines of hell. But your collection from my words is more absurd; for where I say, the soule of Christ might suffer for sinne, yet by no meanes could it receiue the same wages (of sinne) which we should haue receiued; you inferre not only without any words of mine, but directlv against my words; ergo I meane, or I ought to meane, that the soule and mind of Christ suffered the paines of hell from the immediate hand of God: and so where I auouch Christ by no meanes could suffer the same wages (of sin) which we should haue suffered; you paraphrase, Imeane, or I ought to meane, Christ suffered the selfe same which we should haue suffered, and of my negatiues you make affirmatiues, and then tell the Reader I contradict my selfe.
            But in plaine termes I 
               Defenc. pa. 14. l. 27. 
               allow in Christ all those afflictions and passions of the Soule which naturally and necessarily follow paine; and this ALL reacheth vnto moe then meere bodily paines; it includeth the soules proper and immediate paines also.] Where you learned to reason I doe not know, but you haue the best grace to disgrace your selfe that euer I saw; and if this be all the learning you haue, you may clout shoes with this Al. Doe the torments of hell naturally and necessarily follow paine? then whosoeuer in any part, or for any cause is payned, suffereth the paines of hell, or at least the soules proper and immediate paines, which you make extreamest and sharpest in hell. Babes and boyes may thus bable; it is a shame for men to talke so much out of square. Let my words stand simplely as you bring them, and allow in Christ all those afflictions and passions of the soule, which naturally and necessarily follow paine, what conclude you out of them? your sight is very sharpe, if you see any absurditie in them. Howbeit you draw my words from their right course and sense, by leauing out what pleaseth you: My words are Sermons pa. 87. 
               When the auncient fathers affirme that Christ dyed for vs the death of the body only, we must not like children imagine, they exclude the vnion, operation, or passion of the soule: but in the death of his body and shedding of his blood, they include all those afflictions and passions of the soule which naturally and necessarily follow paine, and accompany death. Christ suffering for vs a painefull death how could it be otherwise,

The mortall bodies of men and their fraile life, are by no meanes capable of those terrible iudgements of God against sinne reserued for another world: and howsoeuer your errour leadeth you to aduenture the making of a new hell, my resolution is euery where occurrent in my Sermons, that no iustice of God could award against his owne Sonne the same paines, which the damned in hell doe suffer; if we measure their paines by the Scriptures and not by your fansies: besides that the members of Christ are not subiected in this life to those torments of hell, which the reprobate in an other place doe and shall endure. Rom. 8. 
               There is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Iesus. How then should the Lord Iesus himselfe not onely feare, which I there denie, but also suffer the same condemnation to hell paines, which the wicked and accursed doe and shall suffer?
            
               Defenc. pa. 15. li. 6. 
               We say not Christ suffered simply all the paines of the damned; he felt not such as are by their very nature sinnes, as well as paines; as indeede desperation is.

And therefore neither reiection, confusion, destruction, desperation, nor damnation, are sinnes in hell, but the iust and fearefull punishments of sinne, ordained by Gods iustice, and inflicted by Gods power; who there requireth no obedience, but onely executeth vengeance; the suffering whereof is not sinnefull, though it be neuer so painefull to the damned, abiding for euer in the pollution and confusion of their sinnes here committed. So that if my Lordship as you call it, doe stand to my words, and not clippe them nor renounce them, your Patriark ship gaineth little by them for your purpose. For I by no meanes acknowledge that the true paines of hell are inflicted on any in this life; and by no iustice could the Sonne of God be damned to suffer hell paines, either in substance or in circumstance, as the Scriptures describe them. And therefore your vaunting before the victorie. depending onely on the foolish mistaking, or peeuish peruerting of my words is as

By which arte of yours you make me say in one section, that the iustice of God both temporally and eternally punisheth the soule (ONLY) by the bodie; and in the next section, you say I grant, that Christ did beare punishment of sinne, (AS GREAT AS ANY IS) proceeding from the iustice of God, yet being no sinne; and so with adding (ONLY) to my wordes in the first place, and as (GREAT AS ANY IS) in the second, you haue made some shew of contradiction in my positions, or at least in your additions.
            Thus much for the examination and refutation of those maine diuisions and positions which the Discourser hath laid for the foundation of his cause in his generall opening of the Question; and likewise for the clearing of those contradictions which he falsely supposed to be in my writings. Wherein if I would haue taken the trade which he doth, I could with farre more breuitie and facilitie haue denied all that he affirmeth, and ballanced my no to be euery way as good as his yea: but for their sakes that cannot discusse those things themselues, I haue not refused more largely and fully to expresse and proue the trueth in ech of those points, which he catcheth hold of in defence of his errour, and thereby haue giuen the Reader to vnderstand that this

Discoursers new doctrine is as wide from the veritie, as from the authoritie of holy Scripture. There remain the particular challenges such as they are, which this impugner maketh to many parts & points of my Sermons, and of my conclusion annexed to them; as also his defence of those speciall reasons published in his first Treatise, which I refuted as farre as needed in the conclusion afore mentioned. In which I meane to spend no more time then necessitie forceth me, but to referre the Reader to the places where the things are purposely handled, except some new matter not fully debated be offered vnto me, by reason whereof I may sometimes be drawen to make larger proofe of some things, shortly but truely before vttered by me; and ignorantly, if not peruersely mistaken by him.
            To the Discoursers chalenge that I forced my Text by mistaking the crosse of Christ for Christs personall sufferings on the Crosse, where Paul meaneth the afflictions of Christes members in this world; I made in the conclusion of my Sermons a tripartite answere, 1. That the Crosse of Christ did alwayes in the Scriptures import the personall sufferings of Christ on the Crosse; and neuer the afflictions of the godly. 2. That the circumstances of the Text conuinced no lesse; which were Pauls earnest renouncing of all ioy saue in the Crosse of Christ, and his vehement opposing himselfe to those that ioyned circumcision to the Crosse of Christ, least they should suffer persecution for it at the hands of the Iewes. 3 That the best and most ancient Fathers, Ierom, Chrysostome, Austen and others, expounded these words precisely of Christs death on the Crosse.
            To this what replieth our Controuller? The 
               Defenc. pag. 22. 
               crosse of Christ here signifieth I grant Christ crucified, not in his owne person onely, but also in his members.] Then first you be slipt from your former resolutio deliuered in your Treatise, which is no strange thing in your writings. There your words were, Treatis. pag. 32.
               I take it to be cleare, the Apostle HERE SPEAKETH NOT of the personall sufferings of Christ, but of the godly: You there denie that Paul speaketh of Christs personall sufferings, but of the godly. Here you affirme hee speaketh of both, and least you should seeme to diuide them, you adde; Paul doth here 
               Defenc. pag. 22. l. 9. 
               ioyntly together vnderstand by Christs crosse, the afflictions of the whole mysticall bodie, both head and members. A large and long Crosse of Christ, that conteineth not onely his owne death and passion, and whatsoeuer persecution he suffered in his life time, but ioyntly together all the asflictions of the godly from the beginning of the world to the end. I will not aske you where you find, or how you proue Christs crosse to be so vsed in the Scriptures; you that take vpon you to frame new Redemptions, new hels, and new heauens to your fansie; will not sticke to frame a new Crosse of Christ, without any Scripture: howbeit know this, all wise will beware of such expositions as haue neither example nor ground in the word of God. For though our Sauiour sometimes said, If any will come after me, let him denie himselfe, and take vp his

               Crosse and follow me; yet he neuer said, let him take vp my Crosse and follow mee; and Paul who often vseth the word Crosse without addition, & many times the Crosse of Christ, neuer taketh it in all his Epistles for the afflictions of the godly, but onely for the spitefull and shamefull death which Christ in his owne person suffered on the Crosse. So that howsoeuer euery Christian may be said to take or beare his Crosse; the Scriptures no where apply the Crosse of Christ, but only to the force and fruit of Christes death suffered on the Crosse for vs and our saluation: which is the sense that I affirme Saint Paul here intended.
            But the markes, afflictions, and DYING OF THE LORD IESVS, are vsed in this and other places of the Scripture, to signifie the afflictions of the godly.] Those places haue speciall wordes adioyned, which can not bee referred to the person of Christ, but must of force belong to the speaker or sufferer. As Galat. 6. 
               I beare IN MY BODY the markes of the Lord Iesus, saith Paul: and againe, Coloss. 1. 
               I fulfill the rest of the afflictions of Christ IN MY FLESH. And so, 2. Corinth. 4. 
               we beare about IN OUR BODIE the dying of the Lord Iesus. Where these words, in my bodie, and in my flesh are proper to the speaker, and no way deriueable to the person of Christ. Wherefore the markes,

afflictions, and dying of the Lord, must either import a resemblance to the personall sufferings of Christ, or demonstrate the cause for which the Apostle suffered, which was for Christs sake: and in this is no difficultie, to suffer affliction, in like manner as Christ did, or to suffer it for Christs cause. But the Crosse of Christ, whereof the Apostle speaketh in my Text was that, at which the Iewes were so greatly offended, for which the true preachers were so sharpely persecuted, to which the false teachers ioyned circumcision for the better attayning of saluation, in which the godly most reioyced, and by which the faithfull were crucified to the world, and the world to them; and all these are proper to the personall death and crosse of Christ as he was the Sauiour of the world, and not common to the afflictions of the Saints. It was a question of doctrine, not of manners, for which the Apostle so much striued; and the highest point of mans redemption, not of mans perfection, in which he so much gloried. For touching other mens miseries, how should Paul reioyce in them; or how should he by them be crucified to the world; and the world to him? He had good cause to reioyce in the death of Christ though it were neuer so much maligned and pursued by the Iewes, because it was the wisedome and power of God to saue all that beleeued; and in his owne troubles for Christes quarrell hee might reioyce as hauing thereby Philip. 3. 
               fellowship with Christs afflictions and made conformable to his death: but to reioyce at other mens troubles, that hath no warrant in the word of God. Rom. 12. 
               Reioyce, saith Paul, with them that reioyce, and weepe with them that weepe. Wee may take comfort, and giue God thankes that the faithfull haue grace to endure persecution with patience and courage; but that affliction befalleth them, we may not be glad. For that is to reioyce at other mens harmes, which is repugnant to the rule of charitie. Neither could Paul be crucified to the world, by other mens troubles long before dead, or then vnborne; examples might encourage the weake, but Paul was strong and proposed himselfe as a paterne of patience, suffering persecution. And therefore this haling into the Crosse of Christ the afflictions of all the godly that euer were or shall be, as if the Apostle so highly reioyced in them, and were crucified to the world by them, is wholy against the haire, and hath neither dependence nor coherence with the Apostles words.
            Besides you doe not, or will not vnderstand the maine point here in question betwixt the Apostle and those false teachers of the Iewes, whom he reprooueth and refuteth in this Epistle. You say indeede, Defenc. pa. 22. l. 2. 
               It is manifest the Apostle here (Gala. 6. v. 12.) reprooueth the false teachers for mingling the pure doctrine, because they were loth to taste persecution; but you neither tell vs what the Gospell was which they thus mingled with circumcision, nor why they feared persecution, nor from whom; which things if you would haue specified as the Scriptures deliuer them, you should soone haue perceiued how properly the Apostle addeth for the Crosse of Christ, and how rightly I referred these words to the force and fruite of Christs death, which is the summe and substance of the Gospell. What the Gospel was which Paul preached, appeareth plainly by his owne words. 1. Corin. 1. vers. 23. 
               We preach (saith he) Christ crucified, vnto the Iewes a scandall (or offence) and vnto the Grecians foolishnesse: 
               24. 
               but vnto them which are called both of the Iewes and Greekes, Christ the power of God, and wisedome of God, to saue all that beleeue. For Christ is 
               30. 
               made of God to vs righteousnesse, redemption, and sanctification; to the end, 31. 
               That he which reioyceth might reioyce in the Lord. In so much that 1. Cor. 2. vers. 2. 
               I esteemed not to know any thing among you (sayth Paul) saue Iesus Christ, and him crucified. So that, Christ crucified, the Crosse of Christ, the preaching of the Crosse, and the Gospell of Iesu Christ are phrases of like force vsed by Paul for one and the selfe same word of trueth, which is the doctrine of our saluation by the death and blood of Christ. 1. Cor. 1. vers. 17. 
               Christ sent me (saith he) to preach THE GOSPEL not with wisedome of words, least THE CROSSE OF CHRIST should be frustrate. For the 
               18. PREACHING OF THE CROSSE is to them that perish foolishnesse, but to vs that are saued, it is the power of God. Christ crucified then being the very ground of our saluation, and the Gospel declaring him to be the power of God to saue all that beleeue; euidently the crosse of Christ

was the maine doctrine of the Gospell which Paul preached to the Galathians; and which the false Apostles mixed with circumcision and the righteousnesse of the law, as well for the aduancing themselues being Iewes, as for feare of their countreymen, who vtterly disdained, and egerly pursued all that taught, a man hanged on a tree as a malefactor, (for so the vnbeleeuing Iewes conceiued of Christ) to be the Sauiour of the world, and complement of all Gods promises made to the seede of Abraham for their euerlasting blisse.
            The rage of the vnbeleeuing Iewes against Paul for preaching the death and blood of Christ to be the Redemption of all the faithfull is manifest in many Acts 14. 17. 18. 21. places of the Actes and of his owne 2. Cor. 11. 1. Thes. 2. Epistles; which furie whiles the false Apostles sought to decline, and somewhat to please and pacifie the Iewes, they added circumcision and the obseruation of the law vnto the Crosse of Christ as necessary for iustification and saluation, without which the death of Christ could doe vs no good. This error then newly sowen among the Galathians (to whom Paul before had preached Christ crucified as the sole and sufficient meane of their Redemption, and Iustification, through faith in his blood) the Apostle throughout that large Epistle of his written
               Gal. 6. 11. vnto them with his owne hand, doth purposely and mightily confute; and is so farre from coupling any thing with Christ as requisite for righteousnesse or blessednesse, and chiefly the law, that he opposeth himselfe against men and Angels for the truth of his doctrine; and resolueth cleane contrary to those false teachers and flatterers of the Iewish nation, in most vehement manner; Gal. 5. 
               Behold I Paul say vnto you, that if yee be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing. Ye are abandoned from Christ, whosoeuer are iustified by the law: ye are fallen from grace. His reasons are vrgent and euident. Gal. 2. 
               If righteousnesse (could be) by the law, then Christ died in vaine. 
               Gal. 3. 
               And that no man is iustified by the law in the sight of God, it is plaine; for the iust shall liue by faith; now the law is not of faith. For all haue sinned, and are iustified freely by (Gods) grace through the Redemption that is in Christ Iesus, 
               Rom. 3. 
               whom God hath set foorth, to be a Reconciliation THROVGH FAITH in his blood, to declare his righteousnesse by the forgiuenes of sinnes. 
               Gal. 3. 
               As many (then) as are of the works of the law, are vnder the curse; but Christ hath redeemed vs from the curse of the law being made a curse for vs; (as it is written, cursed is euery one that hangeth on a tree) that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentils through Iesus Christ. And that made the Apostle enter this disputation with so sharpe a rebuke to the Galathians, for sliding from this Gospel or glad tidings of their saluation in the Crosse of Christ, to circumcision and the works of the law. Gal. 3. 
               O foolish Galathians, (saith he) who hath bewitched you not to obey the truth; to whom Iesus Christ was before your eyes described crucified among you? And in this confident course he goeth on with plentifull and substantiall proofes; that the Redemption, righteousnesse, blessednesse, adoption, freedome and sanctification of Gods children, proceede from the grace of God and of Christ, who 
               Gal. 1. 
               gaue himselfe for our sinnes that he might 
               Heb. 2. 
               tast death for all, and are receiued by faith in the blood of Christ, which confesseth him to be the Sonne of God and the only Sauiour of the world.
            What marueile then, if in the close of this example, when Paul had shewed his care to haue the Galathians persist in this truth, in that he wrote so 
               Gal. 6. v. 11. 
               long a letter vnto them with his owne hand, which otherwise he did not vse; he did also traduce the pride and pollicie of the false Apostles, who partly to aduance themselues because they were Iewes, partly to shunne the enuie of their countrimen, frustrated the Crosse of Christ, by adding circumcision and the obseruation of the law vnto it, Vers. 13. 
               not that they themselues kept the law but 12. 
               only because they would not suffer persecution for preaching the Crosse of Christ, which the vnbeleeuing Iewes so egerly resisted and impugned; and withall professed of himselfe, that howsoeuer they

               God forbid that he should reioyce but in the crosse of Christ, as the most sufficient meane of mans Redemption, by which he was crucified to the world, and the world to him, what persecution soeuer he suffered for it? And the verses following, which you pe

            There is no miscoherence with the Text, nor dissidence from the truth in this exposition which not my selfe alone but the auncient Fathers and best Diuines both olde and new haue imbraced: yea it fully agreeth with the maine intent of Paul in this Epistle, with the perpetuall vse of his words, and with the cleare light of other places where like persons and cause were vndertaken by the Apostle. You only are found, Sir Discourser, that to shew neither learning nor reading, but a presumptious ouerweening of your owne witte will needs make the Reader beleeue I vnderstand not the Text. But let vs heare your pure conceit, how currantly it carrieth with it the words and circumstances of the Text. They vrge you to be circumcised, onely least they should suffer persecution for the crosse of Christ, saith Paul of those false teachers, which peruerted the truth of the Gospell among the Galathians by teaching circumcision and the righteousnesse of the Law to be necessarie to saluation. How expound you these words of the Apostle? Def. pag. 23. li. 36. 
               he may (say you) be vnderstood to say, that he would not suffer persecution for commending the afflictions and shame of good Christians for Christs sake. You should say, THEY would not suffer persecution, vnlesse you put Paul into the number of false teachers, but that might be the scape of your Printer. Come to your owne ouersights. First then Christs personall sufferings are here quite excluded; for Christ I trust shall haue an other title with you then the name of a good Christian among the many; and so the crosse of Christ in this place by your exposition doth both exclude and include the proper sufferings of Christ. For afore you said, here Paul doth ioyntly together vnderstand by Christs crosse, the afflictions of the whole mysticall body of Christ both head and members. Secondly where euer read you in the Scriptures, that the Iewes raized persecutions against any, for commending the afflictions of the godly? If it be a truth, name vs the place and the persons; if it be a dreame of yours, keepe it to your selfe: the Scriptures can expound themselues without your

That the Iewes had a furious disdaine and hatred against the person of Christ, and specially against the shame and reproch of his crosse, and for his sake against all that preached or beleeued him to be the Messias so long before promised, and his death to be the Redemption of t

               e world, the Euangelistes and Apostles euery where in their writings giue full testimony. Paul himselfe first persecuting the Christians vnto death, and afterward as sharply pursued by the Iewes for the very same cause, best knew what offence the Iewes tooke at the infamous death of Christ on the crosse, and how egerly they were bent against all that durst professe the name of Christ; and therefore could speake in this case out of his owne experience; that not the commending of the afflictions of the godly, but the preaching of Christs death on the crosse to be the saluation of the world, was the point that so much irritated the Iewes to lay

violent hands on the Christians. Thirdly did circumcision hinder the commending of the afflictions of the godly? the Apostles and first spreaders of the Gospell, as also Paul himselfe were circumcised, and yet the chiefest fauourers and encouragers of the afflicted Christians, so that circumcision was no impediment to like and allow the afl ictions of the godly. But as Paul saw himselfe to be most odious to the Iewes, because they held opinion of him, that he Acts 21. 
               taught all men euery where against the people, the Law and the Temple; (and indeed he boldly professed that in Christ Iesus neither Gal. 5. & 6. 
               circumcision auayled any thing nor vncircumcision, and that they were no longer vnder the Law, since Christ had redeemed both Iew and Gentile from the curse and bondage of the Law) so he could not but discerne the drift of those false teachers, who to flatter the Iewes and to claw fauour with the enimies of Christs crosse taught circumcision and the righteousnesse of the law, to be necessary vnto saluation, as if the death of Christ without them could profit vs nothing. You doe therefore not expound, but peruert the words of Paul, which I tooke for my text; when as he reprouing those false teachers, (whom he before confuted) for adding circumcision and the iustification of the law to the death of Christ, thereby to mitigate the malice of the Iewes conceaued against the crosse of Christ; you turne the Apostles words from doctrine to manners, from preaching to not commending, from the death of Christ to the afflictions of Christians; and so of the highest point of our Redemption, and Saluation by the crosse of Christ, you haue found out a cold kind of scant allowing the troubles of the Saints.
            But the Fathers (which I brought) ouerthrow not your sense, they rather iustifie it.] Whether Augustine, Chrysostome, Ierome, and Bede, whom I cited for the sense of this place, do take the word Crosse in this very sentence for the personall suffe

I must confesse mine eyes be not matches, if they speake not directly to that purpose. Howbeit, you haue a speciall gift to make a short returne of all the Fathers with a nihil dicit, when they speake against you. Indeed you are out of your element when you talke of Fathers, for you neither like their credits, nor allow their iudgements, as in processe we shall more fully shew. For the present, to satisfie those that be soberly minded, and to let all men see to your shame, that I tooke my text right, though you fondly seeke by your silly conceits to impeach it; marke I pray thee, Christian Reader, whether both elder and later Diuines doe not concurre with me in that sense of Christes crosse, which I auouched to be in Pauls words.

               Happily some man (sayth Athanasius) beholding the Lord and Sauiour to be condemned of Pilate and crucified of the Iewes, will cast downe his head for shame. But if we learne the cause why the Lord suffered, wee shall cease to blush, and rather reioyce as Paul did in the Lords crosse.

               Paul might haue vsed a simple kinde of affirmation, ONLY THE DEATH OF CHRIST is sufficient for me to saluation, he chose rather to expresse it by the way of detestation, and to say; Farre be it from me to reioyce, but in the crosse of our Lord Iesus Christ. Where againe the second time, by the crosse he meaneth the death, sacrifice, and expiation of the Lord Christ and the whole worke of our redemption. Gualter in his 59. homilie vpon that Epistle sayth: Now

               Paul opposeth himselfe to those false teachers declaring how he himselfe is affected, and vpon that occasion repeateth the Summe of his doctrine, touching the redemption and saluation of mankind?, in these words; Be it farre from me to reioyce, but in the crosse of our Lord Iesus Christ. He might haue sayd simply; I reioyce only in Christ crucified, in whose crosse I know there is reposed for me life and saluation. But he vseth such a kind of speech as teacheth vs their insolencie was an abominable and capitall offence. Caluin, a man for his great paines in the Church of God worthy of great praise, where he steppeth not too much aside from the ancient Fathers, expounding these words of Paul, sayth: Caluinus in Gala. ca. 6. 
               To reioyce in Christs crosse, is as much as in Christ crucified, but that it expresseth more: for it signifieth that death of Christs which was full of reproch and shame, and was accursed of God. That death then which men abhorre, and whereof they are ashamed, in that death Paul sayth he reioyceth, because he hath perfect blessednesse therein. Piscator in his Scholies vpon Pauls Epistle to the Galathians, noting what crosse of Christ it was for which the false teachers would not suffer persecution, sayth; Piscator in schol. super Epistolam ad Gala. ca. 6. 
               Ob crucem Christs, id est, ob doctrinam Euangelij de salute part a per solam Christi crucem; they would not suffer persecution for the crosse of Christ, that is, for the doctrine of the Gospell teaching saluation to be purchased by the crosse of Christ only.
            
            There is not a new writer of any iudgement or diligence which ioyneth not with these; and howsoeuer some of them withall auouch, that Paul meant to shew by this opposing himselfe to these false teachers, that hee shunned not persecution for the crosse of Christ as they did, but reioyced in the doctrine of the crosse by which the elect are saued, what affliction soeuer befell him therefore; yet they deriue that part of Pauls meaning, not from the confused signification of Christs crosse, as you doe; but either from the EFFICACIE thereof by which Paul was crucified to the world, and the world to him, in neglecting the flattery and enduring the fury of such as opposed themselues against Christ: or from the CONFORMITIE to it, that as he desired to reigne, so he was willing to suffer with Christ, and therefore reioyced as well in the fellowship as in the force and effects of Christes sufferings on the crosse: or lastly, from the CONTRARIETIE to the false teachers, that though they adulterated the true doctrine of Christes crosse, because they would decline persecution; it was Paul
                  •…
                ioy to teach sincerely the power of Christ crucified, whosoeuer pursued him for so doing. This sinceritie and duetie of the Apostle I am farre from denying, but the crosse of Christ I constantly referre to the doctrine of mans redemption and saluation by the crosse of Christ, that is, by his personall sufferings on the crosse, as all those old and new writers do, and not to the troubles and afflictions of the godly, to which if this Discourser dare ascribe the meane or merit of mans redemption or saluation, he falleth from puritie to poperie, and from the Christian faith to open heresie. Thou seest then, gentle Reader, how sure ground and iust reason I had to propose that sense of my text which I did; as also how vntruely, vnwisely, and headily, this fellow ranne first to the challenging of my text, and still vpholdeth his humour with his priuate dreame of Christs crosse conteining ioyntly together all the afflictions of Christ and his members from the beginning of the world to the ending thereof; and maketh the

false teachers, as fearing persecution for the commending of his conceit, to ioyne circumcision to the doctrine of the Gospell, and so by altering and interlacing Pauls words after his owne fansie, hee hath hatched at last an exposition without head or heele, which no man vnderstandeth besides himselfe, and the Diuines of all ages both new and olde do contradict.
            But I committed another great ouersight in handling my text, which was to 
               Defenc pa. 24. 
               take occasion from the text to speake of any thing, for you count them the faithfullest and wisest handlers of Scripture which conclude euen from their text firmly and first of all what soeuer they afterwards teach thereupon.] Indeed I thinke your maner be to conclude all that you afterward say, euen from your text without the helpe of any other places of Scripture. You be so fast in your conceits, and so loose in your conclusions, that you can inferre any thing of euery thing. Euery word you speake, you tie to your text as firmly as flax to fire: but if you would take the paines once to proue that you say, and not only to say that which you should prooue, you would finde great difference betwixt the firmnesse of a fansie in which you be so resolute, and of an argument which for ought I yet see in your writings, you scant make not vnderstand. And where you quarrell with such handling of texts as is vsuall in these dayes, but no good nor commendable vse, your reading must be greater and iudgement better, before you take vpon you to controle the Preachers of England for mishandling their texts. Many hundreds there are of whom you may learne both how to diuide and how to pursue your theme; your skill is not such, that you should professe your selfe a Method-master to this Realme. When I tooke occasion from my text to lay downe first the contents, then the effects of Christs crosse, as the Scriptures did deliuer them; that is, what Christ suffered on his crosse for vs, and what he performed by his crosse to vs; say good Sir out of your new found art, what fault you finde either with the matter or with the method. [Christes crosse, you say, signifieth here no such thing, but the afflictions of Christ and his members.] That is the vanitie of your errour; that is not the trueth of my text. Christ crucified in his owne person for mans redemption, is the full purport of Christs crosse in my text; as in my Sermons I shortly declared; in my conclusion I more amplie proued; and now I trust I haue therein fully satisfied the Reader. That standing good, I note what Christ suffered; which I call the contents of his crosse; and to what end he suffered, which are the effects of his crosse; both these are aptly and fairely closed in my text, and by other places of Scripture iustly proued to be comprised in my text. This forsooth your mastership liketh not, but I must make syllogismes out of euery word conteined in my text, or els I make the Scriptures such an instrument as they ought not to be. Silly Sir you vnderstand not what you say: first learne, and after teach, lest you teach that you neuer learned. When it is sayd, Matth. 22. 
               Giue vnto God the things which are Gods, can you out of these words without the aid of other Scriptures, firmely conclude what things are Gods, and how they must be giuen vnto him; or must you proue that by other places of holy Scripture? Euen so when I had shewed what was iustly inclosed within the words of my theme, I made direct & ful proofe thereof by other places of holy writ; which I take to be a sound and sure way of well vsing the Scriptures, to that very purpose they should be applied, notwithstanding your palterie prouisoes, that no man must after speake any thing that can not firmely be concluded by the sole and single words of his text; which is a rule fit for such a Rouer as you are, that neuer soundly proue any thing; but not for him that will fully diuide and rightly deliuer, as well the sense as the sound of any sentence of holy Scripture which he taketh in hand to vnfold.
            To shew your selfe a firme and fine concluder vpon texts, you exemplifie your skill, and inferre that in three speciall points, I my selfe 
               Defenc. pag. 25. 
               by my very text ouerthrow my selfe, in the first entrance as all men may see: First, in that I expresly grant, the proper sufferings of Christes minde may rightly be in the contents of his crosse, contrary to my maine opinion, that Christs bodily sufferings ALONE were the full price of our redemption. Secondly, that Christs soule in a large sense may be sayd to be crucified, if I suppose my text to

signifie the whole contents of Christs crosse, which I reproued in you with great contempt. Thirdly, in that I quite ouerthrow my second question: for if it be a detestable thing to reioyce but in the crosse of Christ, then Christes descent to hell after death must either be a part of the contents of his crosse, and so he must suffer among the diuels and damned spirits, or els he did vs no good there, if we may not reioyce in his descending thither. These iarres in my selfe, you say, I must reconcile, els men will thinke, I haue not handled my text indeed very rightly.] These iarres good Sir, for so much as concerneth me, are soone reconciled. Your first obiection is a plaine falsitie, your second an open follie, your third a meere mockerie. The contents of Christs crosse I extended to those griefs, wrongs, and paines, which Christ suffered in his passage to his crosse, as namely his submission in the garden, his apprehension, accusation, illusion, flagellation, condemnation and such like, all which he felt before he was fastened to the tree; and though indeed they were precedents to his crosse, yet because the griefe and smart of them continued and increased with his hanging on the tree, the Scripture doth not exclude them from the crosse of Christ, which often meaneth by that word, the whole course and maner of Christes death and passion, as well in comming to his crosse, as in hanging on his crosse. As for the proper sufferings of the minde, those be none of my words; yet if you thereby meane care and feare, shame and sorrow, not repugnant to the condition and perfection of Christes person; let them in Gods name come within the contents of Christes crosse as antecedents or consequents to the paines which he suffered. But if vnder the proper sufferings of the soule you conuey the suffering of hell paines, or the death of the soule from the immediate hand of God, which is your dreame; keepe your errours for your owne accounts, my words haue no such matter nor meaning.
            
               How then 
               Defen. pa. 25. li. 6. 
               can my maine opinion be true that Christs bodily sufferings ALONE were the full price of our Redemption, which I would also ground on all the Fathers though very vntruely?] How can your obiections be waightie that speake neuer a true word? By Christs bodily sufferings I no where exclude either the sense, consideration, or affection of the Soule, discerning the paines which, and the cause why the body suffered, as you falsely imagine; I only except the death of the Soule and paines of hell in Christs sufferings; and to barre that, I shew by many sufficient testimonies of the auncient Fathers, (which you shall neuer ouerbeare for all your bragges,) that Christ dyed for vs the death of the bodie onely, and not the death of the soule. In this case I vse the word ONLY, as hath beene often told you; otherwise to exclude the vnion, operation, or passion of the soule from Christs sufferings, I neuer vse it. And where I so often and instantly vrge that Christs death, and blood-shedding are specified in the Scriptures as the full price of our Redemption, and true meanes of our reconciliation to God; You foolishly by their fulnesse would turne out all the rest of Christs sufferings as superfluous; but my words throughout my sermons are expresse to the contrarie. Sermons. pa. 63. 
               The crosse, blood, and death of Christ are euery where mentioned in the Scriptures, as the very ground-worke, and pillars of our Redemption. And the things which are named in the Scriptures as they were the last, so are they the chiefest parts of Christs sufferings; the rest being vnderstood as antecedent to them, and not eminent aboue them. So that by the death and blood of Christ I neither did nor doe exclude the rest of his sufferings before he came to his crosse; only I make them Antecedent to that, not eminent aboue that which he suffered on the crosse. For as the end of euery thing presupposeth a beginning and a middle, and the highest staire doth orderly confirme there are lower greeces; so the fulnesse of Christs obedience and our Redemption performed by his death and bloodshed on the crosse, doth not exclude the rest of his antecedent sufferings from the communion of his merits, or cause of our saluation, but onely noteth that his obedience, and patience on the crosse euen vnto death as it was the last, and the sharpest, so it was the chiefest and acceptablest part of the sacrifice which he offered for the sinnes of the world. Though then as you haue vsed the matter by adding PROPER (to the) sufferings of the mind, and ONLY to the sufferings of the body,
               
you make some shew of repugnancie in my positions; yet when your miscoloured and misconstrued patches are returned to their owner, my opinions stand sound in themselues and consonant ech to other, and haue that reference to my Text which I first expressed.
            
               But Christs soule in a
               Defenc. pa. 25. 
               large sense may be said to be crucified if we suppose this text to signifie the whole contents of Christs crosse; which I reprooue in you with (such) contempt.] It is an Idle skill and dangerous trade in you and your assistants, when the necessarie parts of Christs satisfaction, and essentiall points of our Redemption come to be questioned; for you to bring your inuentions, besides the Scriptures and without, if not against the faith, and then to vouch it may be said in a large sense; that is by a metaphoricall, hyperbolicall, or metonymicall vnderstanding. In exhortations we permit many things to Diuines, which in positions of faith are vtterly vnlawfull. So long as the words of a perswader may receaue any true construction, be it proper or figuratiue, we beare with his vehement and suddaine affections; but in determinations of doctrine, and conclusions of faith, all men require plaine and proper speech, that the truth may appeare and not be shadowed and obscured with darke and doubtfull riddles. If your hell paines in Christs soule and the death of Christs soule, be but phrases of speech first deuised by you, you should not so much striue for them being no where mentioned, nor applyed to Christ in the sacred Scriptures; but if they be matters of faith, and sufferings requisite by Gods iustice for mans saluation, as you beare the world in hand; why now when you see the falsitie and absurditie of them iustly reprooued, come you in with a large sense, a kind of speach, which in resolutions of faith is not tolerable? I haue no doubt but figuratiuely the soule of man and the Sonne of God may be said to be crucisied euery day. For not only the1 Cor. 2. 
               Lord of glory was once crucified by the Iewes; but there are that
               Hebr. 6. 
               crucifie againe to themselues the Sonne of God, euen such as willingly fall from the truth. And that the desires and delights of the soule may and must be continually crucified, the word of God is euident.Gal. 5. 
               They which are Christs, haue crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts; not by fastning their bodies to the tree, but byColoss. 3. 
               mortifying their earthly members, as inordinate affection, euill concupiscence, couetousnes, and such like which haue their seate principally in the soule.Gal. 6. 
               The world is crucified to me, and I to the world, (saith Paul) when he meaneth that his hart despiseth for Christ all the baites and threats of the world. In a large and figuratiue sense therefore, Christs soule may be said to be dead and crucisied, and so may the diuell be said to be God, for the Scripture calleth him the2. Cor. 4. 
               God of this world; but I hope these may not goe for positions of faith, nor for Articles of Christian Religion, without beleeuing of which we can not be saued.
            From the word Crosse to crucified is an argument, you thinke à Coniugatis, as from words of the same force and inflection; and therefore if Christs soule were partaker of the crosse, it was also crucified.] From being fastened or nayled to the Crosse vnto crucified is indeede a good consequent in the proper signification of the word; for so much doth Crucifigi import, whence Crucifixus commeth: but from the Patients, instruments, or the precedent or consequent circumstances of the Crosse, which yet are inclosed in the contents of the Crosse, to being crucified, is such an Argument as none but you would make.

               ge Logicke to say they were all dead and crucified. The swordes and staues that were brought to take him, the cordes that bound him, the whippes that were made to scourge him, the thornes that crowned him, the nayles that fastned him, the wood that bare him, the lots cast on his garments, the sponge that was filled with vineger to giue him drinke, the speare that pearced his side, are all within the contents of his Crosse: Shall we thence reason, and say they were also crucified? only his bodie was fastned to the Crosse, in which respect the whole person is saide to haue bene crucified; and the paines which he suffered before in his bodie & brought

with him to the crosse, are properly contayned in his crucifixion, by reason they continued in his bodie when it was nayled to the Crosse. The rest of the wrongs & paines which he suffered, are figuratiuely comprised in the name of Christs Crosse, because they were antecedents to his Crosse, or els the name of Crosse is largely taken for all maner of affliction, which befell him after his last Supper, when once he yeelded himselfe to be prepared as a sacrifice for the Crosse. But what is this to the death of Christs soule, or how doth it any way prooue that in soule he must suffer the paines of hell before he could redeeme vs?
            At least yet; I quite ouerthrow my second question, that Christ after this went downe into Hell. For either Christ got vs no purchase in hell, for which we should reioyce; or else I must extend the crosse of Christ, and his bitter sufferings, euen vnto his being in hell, among the deuils and damned spirits, before we may reioyce therein] A conclusion fit for such a Clerke as you are, that can neither distinguish things different from things pertinent to the crosse of Christ, nor see the coherence betwixt the cause and effects of Christs sufferings. In that I obserued, the Apostle made it a thing detestable to reioyce in any thing els but in the crosse of Christ; I followed therein, Chrysostome, O

                  cumenius, Theophylact, Bullinger, Gualter and others, whose litle fingers I take had more learning and iudgement then your whole head; neither do I see what you bring against it, but the opening of your owne follie. For first there be things coherent to the crosse of Christ, and things different from it. Hee that reioyceth in the crosse of Christ, doth also reioyce in euery thing that is necessarily by Gods power and ordinance adioyned vnto it. For no man can reioyce in the cause, but he must likewise reioyce in the effects; and where the Antecedent is expressed, the consequent is therewithall intended. Now the crosse of Christ in it selfe without the effects, was and is most odious and scandalous to men, as appeareth by the Iewes and Gentiles ignorant thereof, and offended therewith. So that when the godly professe they reioyce in the crosse of Christ, they meane in the loue of Christ, who willinglie endured the paine and shame of the crosse, to purchase them euerlasting blisse, and therewith procured and established all the meanes and parts of their Redemption, iustification, and sanctification in this li

Wherefore it was an easie thing for euery childe to see, that when the Apostle reioyced in the death of Christ suffered for vs and for our saluation, he also reioyced in the consequents of Christs death, as his Resurrection, ascension, sitting at the right hand of God, and promised returne to Iudgement, by which as by certaine degrees and steps, our iustification, mortification, sanctification, and saluation, are assured and performed. Now a consequent to Christs death, if not a part or preamble to his Resurrection from the dead, is the destruction of the diuell, and of hell, which is the chiefe place of Satans power as I thinke, and as the Church of Christ before me hath thought, notwithstanding all that you haue said, or can say to the contrarie. Thus standeth my Text neither forced, nor misapplied, as by your ioynt mysticall imagination of a new crosse you supposed, but rightly both conceiued and referred to the painfull sufferings and powerfull effects of Christ on the crosse; in which the Apostle so reioyced, that he detested all things different from it, or derogatorie to it: and the iarres which so much offended your eares, were but your owne iests andFollies. iefallies not truely reporting, but grosly mistaking the sense and sequels of my positions.

               Proceeding forward, I still shew a badde minde towards you, seeking foorthwith euen in the entrance to draw you without cause into hatred for disdaining the Fathers. What then is your contempt and disdaine of the Fathers, which I so often report in sundry places, and as odiously as is possible? Surely you beleeue I can not tell, happily it is because you follow not their authorities in some opinions of religion, nor in diuers expositions of Scripture.] What need you seeke so busily for that which I so plainly haue exemplified vnto you? you affourd

the Fathers when pleaseth you, neither true knowledge of the first principles of their faith, nor the right vnderstanding of words familiar in their natiue tongue, nor so much as reasonable or likely expositions of the Scriptures, but fond and absurd as you terme them; and yet you aske What is your insolent dealing against the Fathers? With one consent they teach that for our redemption Christ died the death of the body only, and by no meanes the death of the soule: You teach that Christ must die the death of the soule before he could redeeme vs, and that his bodily sufferings Treat. pa. 18. l. vltim. 
               properly did not make to our redemption. And though Austen aske, Austen. Epist. 99. 
               Who dare auouch that Christ died in soule, or in his humane spirit? you not only dare and doe it, but you make it the maine ground of our redemption: wherein you condemne him and the rest of the ancient and learned Fathers as ignorant of the very way and meane of our redemption. So likewise, that Christ receiued vpon him the punishment, but not the guilt of our sinne; that the second death in the Scriptures is the eternall punishment of bodie and soule; and that the death of the bodie was inflicted on Adam and all his posteritie as a punishment of sinne; in these and many such, which are deliuered as sound conclusions of Christian religion, you oppose your selfe against S. Austen and the rest, and reiect their iudgements as false and erroneous. And for the sense and signification of words vsed in the Scriptures, you lustily controle them in their natiue speech, and leaue them not so much as the true vnderstanding of the Greeke or Latine tongue. This Trea. pa. 95. 
               I affirme, say you, it is only the Fathers abusiue speaking and altering the vsuall and ancient sense of Hades that bredde this error of Christs descending into hell: their vnapt and perillous translating into Latine Inferi. 
               Ibid. pag. 96. 
               And note heere first, it is a thing too rife with the Fathers, yea with some of the ancientest of them, to alter and change the authentike vse of words; whereby consequently it is easie for errours and grosse mistakings to creepe in.] This challenge of yours against the credits and consciences of so many learned and worthy Fathers as haue vsed the word hades to signifie the place of hell, how insolent it is, I leaue to the wise Reader to iudge, when he shall see that indeed they concurre with the writers of the new Testament, and with the ancient and vulgar vnderstanding of their owne tongue. How you entertaine their expositions of the Scripture, your owne words doe witnesse, when you replie to interpretations alledged out of them; Trea. pa. 66. 
               this sense is most absurd; 
               67. this is no lesse absurd than the former, there is no reason, nor likelihood for it. 
               68. 
               This is more fond and absurd than the other. This is the reuerence and louing regard you beare towards their opinions and iudgements for the manifolde graces of God that were otherwise in them; and this you thinke is no contempt, nor disdaine of the Fathers.

               Here some perchaunce will aske, where as the Canon of the Scripture is perfect, and abundantly sufficient in it selfe for all things, quid opus est vt ei ecclesiasticae intelligentiae iungatur authoritas; what neede is there that the authoritie of the ecclesiasticall interpretation should be ioyned with it? The effect of his answere (which is good for you to obserue, that claime such libertie for your selfe to expound the Scriptures at your pleasure) is this, least euery man should wrest the Scriptures to his fansie, and sucke thence not the truth, but the patronage of his error. Saint Augustine that is euery where carefull to yeeld the Scriptures their due reuerence, yet giueth the word Authoritie, to the decrees of Councels and writings of godly Fathers before his time. Speaking of generall Councels he saith, August epist. 118. 
               Quorum est in ecclesia saluberrima authoritas, Whose authoritie is most wholsome in the Church. And alleaging the testimonies of Irenaeus, Cyprian, Hilarius, Ambrose, Gregorie, Chrysostome, Basil, and others against Iulian the Pelagian he concludeth; Idem contra Iulianum P

If then this word seeme insolent to you which is so frequent with the best Diuines of former and latter times, let your Reader iudge whether it be ignorance or insolence in you to stumble at so plaine a word, as if the religious and auncient Fathers, and lights of Christs Church were not worthy with you to be counted learned Authors, nor their testimonies to be named Authorities fit to guide and lead others to the knowledge of the truth.

               I trust no aduised Christian will challenge more authoritie to the Fathers then was giuen, (by those of Beraea) to the Apostle, nor deny indeede to any priuate man, much lesse to a Minister to iudge and discerne in themselues not onely the words of men, but euen of the sense and meaning of the Scripture by the Scripture it selfe, which thing the Beraeans did, and are commended by the holy Ghost for it.] I trust you claime no power to iudge of

the Scriptures; you may discerne the truth there written, but with necessitie to beleeue, not with libertie to iudge. And if by your freedome you fasten on falsehood, it is no excuse for you, but a condemnation vnto you. Saint Austen speaking of the bookes of the Prophets and Apostles saith, August contra Cr

This if you now assume to your selfe ouer Pauls words or writings, you incurre the crime of flat impietie. Pauls words to vs that beleeue, without further search or other credit, are of equall authoritie with the rest of the Scriptures; and not to beleeue him, till we examine and see the trueth of his doctrine, is meere infidelitie. Galat. 5.

For our comfort that beleeue, and to perswade them which as yet beleeue not, we may search and see the consent betwixt the Prophets and Apostles; yea the sonne of God sent men to the writings of Moses and the Prophets, not as wanting soueraigntie and sufficiencie in himselfe aboue all Prophets, but leading them that knew him not, to consider better of those Scriptures which they knew. It is as true of Pauls writings, as of the rest of the Apostles and Prophets, which S. Augustine affirmeth; Aug. epist. 19. 
               De quorum scriptis, quòd omni errore careant, dubitare nefarium est. Of whose writings to doubt whether they be free from all error, is plaine wickednesse.

Had I brought Fathers in matters of faith against or without the Scriptures, you had some colour to choake me with mine owne words; but taking care as I did, that in cases of faith the Scriptures should be plaine and perspicuous for my purpose before I cited them; and the testimonies of the Fathers euident and concurrent with the Scriptures; how doe I crosse any of those places which you quote out of my writings touching the authoritie and sufficiencie of the Scriptures in points of faith? or what agreement hath your dissenting from the Scriptures and Fathers in the chiefest keyes of Christian religion, with my leauing them in some expositions and positions not pertinent to the faith nor generally receiued of them all?

Where I obserued out of Augustine, Ierome, and Bernard, that the manner of Christs death was not like ours, (though his death were the same that ours is, I meane the separation of the soule from the body,) by reason he had perfect sense and strong speech euen to the very instant that of his owne accord (when he saw his time) he breathed out his soule; whereas both speech, and sense doe faile in vs before we die, and our soules are taken from vs, we can not breath them out when we will; to impeach this obseruation you cast out first reprochfull words, and then vntidy proofes, such as your store could best affourd. Treatis. pa. 53. 
               Here a fine fable is offered vs, say you, a Paradoxe in nature, and contrary to the Scripture which saith, HE VVAS LIKE VS IN ALL THINGS sinne onely excepted. This scornefull speech and bare pretence of Scripture misapplied to your peeuish conceite, is all the answere you vouchsafe to those auncient and reuerend Fathers, I meane Saint Austen, and Saint Ierome. To repell this pride of yours, and to make you perceaue the misconstering of the Scriptures, I shortly replyed; Was Christ like vs in his birth? in his graue or in his resurrection? If he were vnlike vs in these, and yet those words must stand true, then might he also be vnlike vs in his death, and no proofe out of those words could be made to the contrarie. At this poore answere you wonder; but you and your adherents lay your wits together, as you haue done your heads, you shal neuer refell this answere, as poore as it is, without confessing the weaknesse of your owne proofe. For if you restraine the text (which you brought) to naturall humane properties, and infirmities, as now you doe, then most apparantly his birth and his graue must in all things be like to ours, for they are in vs naturall humane properties or infirmities. To be borne of a Virgin, not to rotte in graue and to rise from the dead, Defenc. pa. 30. Those Diuine effects (you say) are iustly beleeued to haue beene in Christ because of the expresse Scripture that witnesseth the same.] But then the text which you vrged, he was like vs in all things, must haue an other meaning then you made shew of. And so it well may, for euen in his birth, in his graue, and in his resurrection, he was like to vs though not in euery circumstance thereof. His body was made of the seede and substance of his mother as ours is, though she a Virgin, and we were begotten by our Fathers. It also lay senselesse and dead in the graue as ours doth, though it could not returne to dust as ours shall. He rose from the dead to a celestiall and immortall life; and so shall we, but not when we will, nor of our owne power, as he did: So that he was like vs in all things▪
                that is in euery part of our nature, and in euery kind of humane infirmities, but not like vs in euery action, circumstance or consequent of all humane properties and infirmities. For so we should depriue him of that fulnesse of wisdome, grace and power, wherewith his humane soule was indued farre vnlike to ours not only if we respect naturall properties, and infirmities in vs, which are vtterly voide of these gifts; but if we compare our measure of knowledge, grace, and strength with the abundance of his spirit. Then might he be like vs euen in death also which parted his soule from his body, as it doth ours; though he were vnlike vs in power to dye when he would, which we can not, and retained full force of sense and speech to the very moment of giuing vp his Ghost, which we doe not.
            Againe the words following in the Text He was like vs in all things, SINNE EXCEPTED, are a sufficient exemption of Christ from our manner of death, as well as from our kind of birth, and rotting in the graue. For we are borne in sinne, which he might not be, & therefore was to be borne of a Virgin to auoid all concupiscence, as well of a Father as in his Mother, without whom he could not be made our flesh. So rotte we in the graue by reason of sinne dwelling in our bodies; which must be changed into dust, whence we were taken, in reward of our first fathers sinne, from

whose loynes we come with like infection of sinne. This Christs body might by no possibilitie admit, though you in the margin of your booke make a false note to the contrarie. First, for that no part of his person might vtterly be dissolued or corrupted after it was once vnited to his Godhead, but must remaine for euer inseparable from his Diuine nature, and so incorruptible: because God was vnited not to dust or ashes, but to humane flesh which so must still continue. Secondly, for that all Christs sufferings for sinne must haue in them exact and perfect obedience, and so precisely sense and will in euery passion, to submit himselfe to the hand of God: which in death he might doe and did; but in rotting i
                  •…
                the graue where sense and will wanted he could not doe. Lastly, the Apostle extendeth Christs obedience in suffering, no farder then to the death of the Crosse; after which could follow no fatder humiliation, and so no corruption to dust; but a sure confirmation of his death by lying three daies in the graue, and a plaine pledge of his resurrection, because he could not see corruption. The same words exempt Christ from our manner of death. For where death entred not but by sinne, and the soule of ech man to this day, by a naturall instinct sheweth her secret abhorring of death and open strugling with death before she depart her body, from which she doth not yeeld but by force of death taking from her first speech and sense, and so by degrees the whole possession of hir bodie; violently thrusting hir out of her seate; Neither this violence of death, nor this resistance of the soule may be admitted, or were perceaued in the person of Christ. He might suffer nothing but willingly; because the misliking of the hart is disobedience though the fact be endured. Wherefore if we meane with the Apostle to confesse Christ to haue beene obedient to his death, we must leaue in him both sense and will to obey euen to the last gasp, and also power to breath out his soule into his Fathers hand, when the time was come appointed by God for him to depart this life. Againe, what force created could wrest his soule from him being God, and man, but at his liking? His owne words are, none taketh my soule from me, but I lay it downe of my selfe. Whereon Chrysostome rightly groundeth this consequent. Chrysost. de feria 5. passioni

               expresse words in the Text that Christ died, as I say, not naturally, but miraculously, and then you will beleeue it.] Would you haue so plaine words in the text, that you can not, or that you should not quarrell with? If you delude, as your maner is, the plaine words of the Scripture with kinds of speeches and large senses, I see no words that can hold you, but you may defend after your fashion any kind of fansie or heresie, with Synecdoches, Allegories, and Hyperboles. And though the iudgement of so great and godly fathers ioyning with the very words of the Scripture, carie with it sufficient weight to a sober and religious Reader; yet for your pleasure, that you may see your follie, I am content to cast about againe. What is ponere animam in the Scripture, Sir, I pray? is it willingly or vnwillingly to lay downe a mans soule or life? You know Peters words to his Master, Iohn. 13. 
               Animam meam pro te ponam. I will lay downe my life for thy sake. And S. Iohns, 1. Iohn 3. 
               Nos debemus profratribus animas ponere. We ought to lay downe our liues for our brethren. And Christes, Iohn. 10. 
               Propter hoc Pater me diligit, quoniam ego pono animam meam, vt iterum sumam eam. Therefore the Father loueth me, because I lay downe my soule to take it againe. In all these places ponere animam must needs be to lay downe life or soule willingly; except you be so wise as to thinke that Peter in loue telleth his Master he was vnwilling to die for him; and S. Iohn forwarneth vs, we must not be willing to die for our brethren; yea, and that the Father loued the Sonne because hee was vnwilling to die for his sheepe, which were Diuinitie fit for such a Doctor as you are. Then tollere animam is for another to take our (life or) soule fromvs, whether we be willing or vnwilling it should be done, as appeareth by Eliahs prayer vnto God, in saying 1. King. 19. 
               take away my soule, when he desired to die. Resort now to the words of our Sauiour, where he sayd, Iohn. 10. 
               None taketh (my soule) from me, but I lay it downe of my selfe, and see whether they inferre a peculiar maner of dying, not common to others. Had he meant to say no more, but I die willingly, as you imagine he intended;

               pono animam, I lay downe my soule, had been words enow to expresse that meaning: but he maketh an addition, which must needs haue some force; and not be an idle repetition of the same thing; and likewise an opposition, the contrarie whereof must be found in his death. For where other mens soules are taken from them, though they be neuer so willing to die, as appeareth by the witnesse of Scripture, I lay it downe OF MY SELFE, sayth our Sauiour; that is, not onely of mine owne accord, but by mine owne power. To shew that so he doth, he sayth, None taketh (my soule) from me, (which they do from others) I lay it downe of my selfe. And lest any man should doubt as you doe, whether 
                  •…
               e spake of his willingnesse to die, which is common to others; or of his power, which was proper to himselfe; in full, expresse, and direct words, to stoppe such cauilling mouthes as yours is, hee addeth as a proofe of his speech,Iohn. 10. 
               I haue power to lay it downe (he meaneth of himselfe, as the former words conuince) and haue power to take it againe: this commandement haue I receiued of my Father. That he was willing to lay down his soule I do not denie, the word pono (I lay it down) proueth so much; but he professeth that hee had receiued power and commandement from his Father to lay it downe of himselfe, and to take it againe of himselfe. This commaundement was peculiar to his person; no man liuing euer had or shall haue the like; & this power to lay downe his soule of himselfe was as MIRACVLOVS, as his power to raise himselfe from the dead, since they are both compared and ioyned together. These things did those ancient and learned Fathers see, when they made their collections: and so plaine and perspicuous are they euen in the Text it selfe, that none of meane capacitie or any modestie can mistake, or will outface them.

               I alone haue this power, which you haue not. In this power which he had and we haue not, I trust he was vnlike vs; and so Chrysostom directly refelleth your vnskilfull application of the Scripture that Christ was like vs in all things, euen in the manner of his death. ButDefenc. pa. 31. 
               If it were new and not ordinarie that Christ should haue power to lay downe his life, yet why may not his manhood dye naturally notwithstanding?] Forsooth because he vsed that power at the time of his death, as he himselfe witnesseth, which no man euer did, or can doe. As he had power which was aboue nature to lay downe his life when he himselfe would; so his owne mouth testifieth that none tooke his soule from him, but he layed it downe of himselfe, that is, of his owne accord and power, when he saw his time.

Howbeit in your mocking vaine you goe on, and say, that I will conclude this better. You must remember what God himselfe saith; O foole this night they shall fetch away thy soule from thee. Whereto you adde. I remember it well, what then? ergo, Christ saying none taketh my life from me, ment he would dye miraculously, and not by the fayling of nature in him? If this be the reason, verely I graunt it is marueylous subtill and past my reach. If you ouer-reach no more then this reason doth, you will come short of all your new conceits. If your memory be not too much moistened, you may call to mind that this place was brought to prooue, Christ was vnlike vs in the laying downe of this soule; and if I be not as grosse as you are gamesome, it proueth it very directly. God by those words expresseth the rich man should that night die, and thereby teacheth vs that when we dye, our soules are taken from vs. So that it is not in our power to keepe our soules in our bodies as long as we will, nor to leaue them when we list: but when God sendeth, will we, nill we, they are taken from vs. This Christ denieth

to be verified in him; none tooke his soule from him, but he laid is downe of himselfe, which we cannot doe. Hence if it please you to frame but this reason which is in open sight: All mens soules are taken from them when they dye: Christs soule was not taken from him when he dyed: ergo, Christ dyed not in the same manner that we doe; and so was vnlike vs in his death, by the manifest wordes of the Scripture; you shall see a plaine truth, not past your reach, though repugnant to your purpose.

                motion doe first euidently faile before our soules depart from our bodies: But Christ had all three by the full report of the Euangelists, euen to the very act of breathing out of his soule. Saint Iohn writeth thatIohn. 19. 
               Iesus knowing all things were fulfilled said, I thirst: and when he had tasted the vineger he said, it is finished: and inclining his head gaue vp the ghost. Hee noteth in Christ exact memorie of all things written in the Scripture touching him, Plaine speach, and voluntarie motion in laying downe his head at the very moment that he yeelded vp the ghost. S. Luke witnesseth thatLuke 23.

               . And speaking these words hee breathed out his soule. The lowdnesse of his voyce, and effect of his prayer professing hee would now die, and at the same instant performing it by giuing vp his spirit, conclude that neither sense, memorie, speach, nor prayer failed him to the last breath, as they doe vs when wee draw towards death; and therefore the maner of his death to bee farre distant from ours.

And so bowing his head of his owne accord he forthwith breathed out his soule. Anone after, say you, but nature first decaying in him; Presently say I, when there was in him no decay of nature, nor any want of memorie, sense, or speach. In vaine else were all those things, both performed by our Sauiour, and testified by the Euangelists, if this were not the scope thereof, that Christ with actuall and perfect obedience, deuotion, and submission to the will of God, and therefore also with full and perfect memorie, sense, and speach, did aboue the strength and vse of men, willingly and powerfully with one breath render his soule into the hands of his Father; who had decreed hee should die, but gaue him leaue and power to lay downe his soule of his owne accord when hee would, without constraint or stroke of death wresting or taking his soule from him. And that the maner of Christs death was miraculous euen in his owne Person, and draue the standers by to confesse hee was more then a man, that so could die; if you could but open

What hath Ierom said in those words; which Saint Marke, and S. Luke in effect did not before him? That the lowde voyce which Christ vsed presently before his yeelding vp the ghost, was that prayer which Ierom mentioneth, S. Luke witnesseth. And speaking those words (saith S. Luke) Christ gaue vp the ghost. That was a very strange, and marueilous thing to the Centurion to heare him so speake, and see him so die. Saint Marke obserueth; The Centurion seeing, that crying in such sort, Christ gaue vp the ghost, said, Surely this man was the Sonne of God. Could it mooue the Centurion (that had the charge to see Christ executed) to this confession, and not seeme strange vnto him? Pilate that gaue sentence of death vpon him, Marueiled he was so soone dead; and doe you thinke it much S. Ierom should say it was a wonder? But in S. Matthew it is Defenc. pa. 32.

                     •…
                  ly did mooue the Centurion so to thinke, and speake.] Saint Marke saith, The Centurion that stoode ouer-right Christ, and beheld him; when hee saw in what sort hee cried, and died, said, Truely this was the Sonne of God. After his death, the Earthquake and other things that followed the death of Christ, caused the Centurion and his Souldiers, as they were keeping Iesus now dead, greatly to feare, and with one voyce now to confesse that surely he was the Sonne of God. Both which reports stand true together; the one not ouerthrowing the other. For the Centurio alone at the hearing of Christs voyce, and sight of his death did first affirme it: Afterward when Christ was dead, as the Centurion and his souldiers kept his body on the Crosse, till Pilates pleasure were knowen, the wonders which followed Christs death, as the shaking of the earth, the cleauing of the rockes, and opening of the graues, made the Centurion and those that were with him watching Iesus greatly to feare, and (with one mind) to say, Truely this was the Sonne of God. So that your words Pag. 32. li. 45.HE SAID, meaning thereby the Centurion, are not in S. Matthew, but the Centurion and those that were with him SEEING (the wonders that followed Christs death) greatly feared, saying, Truely this man was the Sonne of God. And had the Centurion seene nothing wonderfull in Christs person before he died; how should hee and the rest haue gathered certainely, that these things declared Christ and none other, to be the Sonne of God? But Christ suffering all things with silence and patience till the instant of his death, he then shewed himselfe to die with a strange and diuine power aboue mans nature, which the Centurion first marked, and therefore confes

               ed him to be the Sonne of God; & when the rest of the wonders that followed the death of Christ, were perceiued; they confirmed him and all his souldiers

in the same opinion: yea Luk 23. all the people that came to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their brests and returned. Where S. Luke also putteth a manifest difference betwixt the Centurion and the rest of the people. Of the Centurion hee saith,Vers. 47. 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                
               seeing what was done, in that Christ praying gaue vp the ghost, hee glorified God and said, truely this man was iust. Of the rest Saint Luke saith, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , Beholding the sundry things that were done (after Christs death)Vers. 48. they stroke their brests and returned.
            This miraculous and diuine power, which appeared in the person of our Sauiour breathing out his soule at an instant, when he would and as he would, besides and beyond the nature of man, at which the Centurion so much wondered; the best Diuines of all ages haue likewise obserued, and acknowledged. So that you haue small cause to conceiue, you can take Bernard tardie in a tale in such sort as you doe; as if his age were too young, or his wits too weake to encounter your worth. He sayth indeede: to die was a great infirmitie, but so to die, (as Christ did) was a great (or an infinite) power. Where shewing your selfe to be sharpe sighted in toyes, and heauie headed in trueth, you aske, which is this infinite power? Christs tasting the vineger, or his saying it is finished, or his bowing the head, or his giuing vp the ghost? Had you not tasted so much the vineger of your owne conceits, that you can scant lift vp your head to looke on any thing but lees, you might easily haue seene what Bernard sayth, and that he sayth no more then the best learned Fathers in Christes Church said before him.

Againe, he dyeth when he will himselfe, yea and layeth of his soule with authoritie, to shew himselfe Lord of life and death, which is an euident proofe of his Diuine power. It is profitable for vs diligently to marke the Diuine power of Christ, which shewed it selfe so plainly in his death.

Whereupon Pilat maruailed that Christ was so soone dead. And the Lord himselfe said, None taketh my soule from me but I lay it downe of my selfe. I haue power to lay it downe, and power to take it againe. To which it pertaineth that is written, he bowing downe his head gaue vp his spirit; for other men first dye, and then their heads hang; but Christ first laid downe his head, and then voluntarily rendered his soule to his Father.

Adde hereunto that experience sheweth, (as Phisitians say,) how some diseases in the body bring death presently after most strong and violent crying: Namely in some excessiue torments, as of the stone.] Things reported and expressed in the Scriptures touching the strange and wonderfull manner of Christs death you deny; and dreame of things there no way mentioned, to coulour your matter and cosin your Reader. That Christ did render his soule into his Fathers hands, when as yet neither speech, sense, memory, nor motion began to faile, is diligently obserued by the Euangelists, and was greatly marueyled at by the Centurion, which saw the manner of his death: As also that he breathed out his soule of his owne accord when he had spoken those words without any former or other degrees or pangs of death appearing in him, is likewise witnessed by the Scriptures, and constantly auouched by all the Fathers. Saint Luke saith, and speaking these words he breat hed out his soule: Saint Mathew, and crying with a loud voice he dismissed his spirit: Saint Marke, and sending a strong voice from him he blew out his

Soule. This did he of his owne accord and power, None taking his soule from him, as in death they doe ours; but declaring himselfe by laying of his soule when he would, and as he would, to be Lord and master of life and death. This is fit for all Christians to confesse, least they dishonor the death of Christ by depriuing his person of that power and glory, which he openly shewed in the eyes & eares of all his persecutors. This you shift of, and instced thereof imagine some strange and VNVSVALI accident in the manner of Christs death, which neither the Scriptures report, nor you can expresse: wherein you shew your selfe forward to inuent what is not written, and backward to beleeue what is written, which is the trade of such men as meane to make a shipwracke of their faith.
            That a man may dye crying, as Christ did, you haue found at length if not from Diuines, at least from Phisitians; for I perccaue you haue sought all sorts of helps both farre and neere to vphold your fansies.] P

               rchaunce Phisitians may tell you, when a painefull disease possesseth the parts which are no fountaines of life or sense, a man may cry, till sense and strength begin to faile, and so hasten his death by the violent spending of his spirits; but that a man may by any course of nature retaine perfect memorie, sense, motion, and speach to the very act of breathing out his soule, I assure my selfe no wise Phisitian will affirme. And if any more humorous then learned will wade so farre without his Art, he must vnderstand that his word may not ouersway the Rules of Diuinitie and Principles of nature. For what are the powers and faculties whereby the soule is conioyned with the body, but life, sense, and motion? so long then as they last, the soule by nature neither doth, nor can forsake the body. But when sense and motion first outward and then inward are oppressed and ouerwhelmed, then life also perisheth and the soule may no longer abide in her body; the vnion by which she was fastened vnto it, being wholy dissolued Wherefore death which is the priuation of life, by Gods ordinance for the punishment of sinne by degrees surpriseth and in the end quencheth all sense and motion, and so forceth the soule to forsake her seate; which by Gods appointment is violently parted from hir body whether she will or no: but neuer till the effects oflife, which are sense and motion, be first decayed and abolished. A sowne is the suddainest ouerwhelming of the powers of life, which any natural experience doth teach vs; and yet therewith though outward sense and motion doe faile at an instant, and the inward be very weake and almost insensible, the soule doth not presently depart, but stayeth a time till all sense and motion without and within, (except the partie be recouered) be vtterly extinguished. Wherefore in all men by necessitie of nature the powers and parts of life decav in some sooner in some later before they die; and therefore in Christ on the Crosse it was MIRACVLOVS and aboue nature, that hauing full & perfect outward and inward sense speech and motion, he did in a moment, when he would, and as he would, render his soule into the hands of his Father without any farder decayes, or other degrees of death precedent then the very act of breathing out his soule, which left his body presently and perfectly dead.

               proceedeth to shew my disdaine to the Fathers for insolent reiecting all their opinions touching the causes of Christs Agonie in the Garden, and of his complaint on the Crosse. For answere, first I desire to know whether you allow of all these causes, or no; you seeme to refuse thē here: for herein you shewed not your own opinion, but the Iudgement of the Fathers. Elsewhere your selfe are resolute for some of those causes, and against other some. And yet before; all these interpretations you say are sound, & stand well with the rules of Christian pietie; thus variable you are in that wherin you seeme most resolute.] When you know what it is to be constant, you shall doe well to talke of inconstancie; till that time your owne doctrine will most disgrace your owne doings. You catch oft at contrarieties in my writings; make good but one, and then prate at your pleasure. Otherwise men will thinke it to be the weaknesse of your witte, or stifnesse of your stomacke, that can not or will not rightly conceiue that which is truely spoken.

Iohn 7. MY doctrine is not MINE (sayth our Sauiour) but his that sent me: will you hence conclude a manifest contradiction in Christ, because he sayth, mine is not mine, but his that sent me. In possessions, that is mine, which is wholly mine and no mans els; and in opinions, that is properly mine, whereof I am the first inuenter and author; howbeit by a larger extension of the word, that is mine also, wherein I communicate with others, though it be not properly or only mine. Out of this distinction of proper & common, knowen to the very children in Grammar schooles, our Sauiour sayth most truly; My doctrine (that is, the doctrine which I preach, and in that respect is mine) is not mine, is not only mine, nor of my deuising, but his that sent me. This were enough to warrant my words; and yet my speech is somewhat plainer: for I added, not MINE OVVNE opinion, but the iudgements of the Fathers. Now mine owne is that which is properly mine, and wherein no man partaketh with me; and although you might stumble at Mine, yet MINE OVVNE would put you out of doubt. So that here, as elswhere, you bewray the sharpnesse of your quarrelling humor; but if neither you nor your friends could spie any greater faults, than these absurd and ignorant cauils; the Reader will scant

trust you hereafter, when you talke of my contrarieties and inconstancies. But how doth this excuse the foulenesse of your mouth in reiecting the Fathers iudgements with irreuerent and disdainfull termes; which was the thing I then reproued in you?

               I know our contraries do fansie other senses of this Text, My God, my God why hast thou forsaken me; but the senses of that text alledged out of the Fathers word for word, & the places of the Authors named, when you come after your proud and peremptorie maner to examine and censure; you say, to that which was produced out of Ierome and Chrysostome, 
               Trea. pa. 66. li. 31. 
               which sense is most absurd; and this is too fond to be spoken. To the sense noted out of Athanasius, Austen, and Leo, your answer is; Trea. pa. 67. li. 11. 
               this is no lesse absurd than the former; there is no cause nor likelihood in the world for it. So when the testimonies of Ambrose, Austen, Ierom and Bede were produced, that the reiection of the Iewes might be some cause of Christes sorrow in the Garden; you grosly mistake their words, as if they had expounded Christes complaint on the crosse, and pertly reioyne, Trea pa. 68. li. 3. & 8.

               My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me, be most friuolous and foolish; yet none is more babish than when you mistake the reiection of the Iewes (which I shewed out of Ambrose, Ierom, Austen and Bede might be some cause of Christes sorrow after his last supper) to be the meaning of his complaint on the Crosse: and would needs in a flaunt affirme that ME in those words of Christ (why hast thou forsaken me) doth not signifie my whole Nation; which of my certaine knowledge neuer came into my head, nor euer out of my mouth. For I tooke care to wade no further in expounding them than the Scriptures and Fathers went before me; and howsoeuer his sorrow for them

might happily not cease before his death; yet there was no cause why hauing formerly prayed his Father to forgiue them, that knew not what they did, he should now call the rest of the perfidious and obstinate Iewes by the name of himselfe. If you stand to vphold this ouersight, you shew your selfe to haue lesse iudgement in mainteining it, than you had in mistaking it; but you haue stood too long on these irifles, which I thinke to be true: for you trifle indeed, and neither in defence of your selfe, nor disaduantage of me, bring any thing that is materiall. You come therefore to peruse how you haue ignorantly and purposely peruerted my reasons.

               true sacrifice for sinne must be indeed BODILY, BLOODY and DEAD, we doubt not; we vnfainedly and heartily embrace it. The Patriarks beleeued it, the Iewes sacrifices of beasts figured it, the New Testament confirmeth it. But what will follow then? ergo Christes bodilie death only and meerely was the whole ransome and price of our sinne? for we must note that this is the very question indeed; this is the point of our controuersie.]The Defender not able to support his errours, doth quarrell with the question. When you can say nothing to support your errours, you beginne to quarrell with the question; as if you had or could prescribe me what I should preach of. What I by warrant of holie Scripture receiued into the contents of Christs crosse, and what I excluded from the same, is euident by my words; you may not come after and alter the question to your liking. Into the Crosse of Christ I admitted whatsoeuer the Holie ghost witnesseth the Sonne of God suffered either on his crosse, or going to his crosse. My words are plaine, Serm. pag. 8. li. 35.

And good reason had I so to doe: for all the paines and griefes of bodie or minde which befell him betweene his last supper and his fastning to the crosse, endured and augmented on the crosse; and so by no meanes might be excluded from his crosse. What things I then excluded from the crosse of Christ, is as manifest by mine owne words; which neither I can hide, nor you may change. These they are: Serm. pag. 8. li. 23. 
               Some men in our dayes stretch (the crosse of Christ) a great deale farther, to the death both of bodie and soule, and vnto the whole paines of the damned in hell: but vpon how iust grounds, when you heare, you m

               a wrestling with the very powers of hell, or trembling at the terrour of Gods vengeance prouoked by our sinnes, so they put no distrust nor doubt in Christes soule of his owne saluation or our redemption, but leaue him firme faith alwayes fixed on God: I repeated againe, what it was I impugned; to wit, that Serm. pag. 9. li. 14. 
               some men in our dayes will no nay, but that Christ on the crosse suffered the selfe same paines in soule, which the damned do in hell, and endured euen the death of the soule. Heere Sir is the question as I first proposed it, I no where alter it, no

                varie from it: both these, I meane the death of the soule, and the selfe same paines which the damned in hell do suffer, I excluded from the crosse of Christ, and consequently from the worke of our redemption; which I auouched to be perfect and full without either of those additions. To this are all my proofs directed, and from this by your leaue I may not suffer you to wander: Defenc. pa. 35. li. 32. 
               Your meere bodily sufferings without any proper sufferings of the soule take backe to your selfe; I haue no such words, nor make no such doubts; the death of the soule and the selfe same paines which the damned doe suffer, and we should haue suffered, had we not beene redeemed, which is the second death or the death of the damned, are the things brought by me in question. Wherefore howsoeuer you will vnderstand my meaning contrarie to my words, because you would shroud your selfe vnder the couert of these wordes MEERE AND PROPER, I must recall all my reasons to those two points to which I first intended them: and whether I speake ambiguously or deceitfully, or change my question, or charge you vniustly that you slip from the question to certaine generall and doubtfull termes, let the Reader in Gods name iudge.
            My proofes to my purpose stand sound and good. The true sacrifice for sinne by the Apostles Doctrine hath these three properties in it; it must be BODILY,

BLOODY, and DEADLIE; that is, it must haue the bodily and bloody death of the mediator, who must be the Sonne of God. This the Patriarkes belee

                   Christs bodily death onely and meerely was the whole ransome and price of sinne? Without your termes of proper and meere you are no body. My reason is in sight. The death which the Mediator must dye for the sinnes of the world must be bodily and bloody. The death of the soule, in this life, and the death of the damned after this life (which are the paines of hell) could not be bodily and bloody. Therefore neither of them was the death which the Mediator must or did die for the sinnes of the world. If he dyed neither of those, then he died the death of the body onely, for so much as the Scriptures mention no kinds of death but onely these three, except it be by way of figuratiue speech. Doe you now see what followeth? then what is your answere? Defenc. pa. 35. li. 32. 
               If I meane that the MEERE bodily sufferings of Christ without any proper sufferings of his soule are the intire and whole Ransome for sinne, then you affirme expreslie, there is no peece of reason in these words.] You are a PROPER and MEERE Gentleman to spott out matters of this importance.

But what are meere bodily sufferings? such as haue no communion neither with the sense nor grace of the soule? can a liuing body die a shamefull and cruell death as Christ did and the soule neither like or mislike it, nor so much as feele it? This you inferre vpon the word onely, when I conclude that Christ died a bodily death onely.

And likewise by the suffering of death they vnderstand the paine and sting of death approching, and lastly separating the soule from the body. And therefore Christs sacrifice for sinne though it were only bodily; because no part of Christ died but only the body, yet the soule endured the paine and discerned the cause thereof. And though it were deadly, because it ended in death and was finished by death; yet the actions and affections of Christs soule, as well from her selfe as from his body, at the time of his passion impressed, or stirred, either by the cause, smart, author, or manner of his sufferings were meritorious, and made way for the satisfaction of sinne, which was not accomplished but by that death of Christs body, that God had determined. Let therefore the Reader iudge how well you impugne my conclusion, that Christ died for our sinnes the death of the body only, and not the death of the soule nor of the damned; and how vainly you vouch, Christs death and sacrifice as they were bodily, had neither paines nor patience, obedience nor charitie, nor any other action or passion of his soule in them.

And so our whole redemption, doe you referre it only to remission of sinnes, as the Apostle doth when he sayth, We haue redemption through Christes bloud, euen the forgiuenesse of sinnes? or also to deliuerance from the dominion and infection of sinne, and to the abolishing of all corruption in soule and bodie; which is our whole and absolute redemption?

               The whole propitiatorie sacrifice are words as doubtfull as the other: for since Christ was the Priest, who Heb. 9. 
               by his eternall spirit offered himselfe vnspotted to God, and 
               Eph. 5. 
               gaue himselfe for vs to be an offering and sacrifice of a sweet smel vnto God; his innocence and obedience chiefly rested in his soule, & thence sanctified his bodie, which suffered death for the ransome of our sinnes. Though then all things in Christ were holie and acceptable vnto God, and so sacrifices most meritorious; yet nothing did fully satisfie the iustice of God for sinne, nor make a perfect reconciliation for vs with God, but his obedience vnto death. For that which must satisfie for sinne, must be death; other ransome for sinne God neither in his wisdome and counsell would, nor in his trueth and iustice could accept, after his will once determined and declared. It was the first wages appointed and denounced by God to sinne: Gene. 2. 
               In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt die the death; (or certainly thou shalt die;) the doubling of the word noting the inflexibilit

               e of Gods counsell and iustice. The Apostle witnesseth the same, when he sayth, Rom. 6. 
               The wages of sinne is death. Then as sinne was irreuocab
                     •…
                  e rewarded with death, so must it necessarily be redeemed by death. Which rule stood so sure, that when the Sonne of God would giue himselfe for vs to redeeme vs, he could not do it (by reason of Gods immutable counsell and decree) but by death. Wherefore the Apostle calleth him the 
               Hebr. 9. 
               Mediator of the New testament through death for the redemption of transgressions. And where a testament is, there MVST BE (sayth he) the death of the testator. He contenteth not himselfe to say there was, but there must be the death of the testator, before we could be redeemed. A necessitie not simplie binding Gods power, but plainly declaring his counsell to be fixed, and his will reuealed.
            Since then Christ was to 
               Hebr. 2. 
               taste death for all men, that through death he might destroy him which had power of death, euen the diuell; and deliuer vs who were

soule; or (as I auouch) the death of the bodie only. Other parts of Christes person, and beames of his vertues, and kinds of his sufferings are not to this qu

                  lose which consummated all the rest, was death; and therefore no sufferings of Christ were parts of the propitiatorie sacrifice which ransomed sinne, but such as ended in death, or tended to that sorrowfull, shamefull and painfull death of Christ, which by order of Gods iustice was appointed to satisfie for sinne. The fulnesse of which satisfaction consisted in death, and therefore the death and bloud of Christ though they were not the whole sacrifice, yet were they the full and perfect ransome and price for sinne; because without them the rest could not preuaile, and to them all the rest was directed. If then you will deale plainly as you pretend, or not forget your duetie to God and his trueth, you must leaue cauilling with the words of the Holy Ghost, and go soberly to consider, not whether any other sufferings, but whether any other death of Christes be mentioned in the Scriptures to ransome our sinnes, besides the death of his bodie. If you finde any other there, professe

            In sense and substance there is no difference betwixt these words, the death, bloud, and crosse of Christ; the crosse noting the tree, whereon Christ died a reprochfull and cruell death for vs; and his bloud expressing the maner of his death by sundrie sorts of shedding the same, as by whipping, piercing his head with thornes, boaring his hands and feet to fasten him to the crosse, and hanging him thereon three houres by the sorenesse of his wounds, till his soule departed from his bodie. To make these iarre one with the other, which the holy Ghost had knit together, is the signe of a busie, but not of godly wit; and howsoeuer you and your adherents can flourish with figures of Grammar, you were best take heede that you turne not your eares from the trueth of God. The bodily death which Christ died to ransome our sinnes, the holy Ghost doth note sometimes by his Flesh, sometimes by his Body, sometimes by his Blood and sometimes by his Crosse, and these either ioyned or seuered; and sometimes also by his soule or life laide downe or powred out vnto death for vs. We finde them ioyned, when Paul saith, Coloss 1. 
               It pleased (God) by Christ to reconcile all things to himselfe and to pacifie by the BLOOD of his Crosse through him, both things in earth and things in heauen. And you which in times past were strangers and enemies, hath he now reconciled in the BODY OF HIS FLESH through death. Seuered are they when Peter saith; 1. Pet. 1. 
               You were redeemed by the precious blood of Christ as a Lambe vndefiled; Who Hebr. 9. 
               by his owne blood (saith the Apostle) entered in once into the holyplace, and obtained eternall Redemption. And so when Iohn saith, 1. Iohn 1. 
               The blood of Iesus Christ clenseth vs from all sinne. As likewife Paul; Ephe. 1. 
               We haue Redemption through his blood, euen the Remission of sinnes. Of his body himselfe saith; Luke 22. 
               This is my body, which is giuen for you; and Iohn 6. 
               my flesh will I giue for the life of the world: so are 
               Hebr. 10. 
               we sanctified by the offering of the body of Iesus Christ once. Likewise of his soule by which the Scripture meaneth his life for that life wholy dependeth vpon the presence of the soule in the body; Iohn 10. 
               My Father loueth me (sayth Christ) because I lay downe my soule (or life.) Matt. 20. 
               The sonne of man came to giue his soule (or life) as a ransome for many. And Esay foreshewed that Christ should diuide the spoyle of (or with) the mightie, Because he

               powred out his soule vnto death, which seuereth the soule from the body; and so made it an offering for sinne by laying it downe of himselfe, that death might seaze on his body. This then being the maine foundation of the Gospel, which the Apostle receiued, that 1. Co

               Christ died for our sinnes according to the Scriptures, the Question still standeth as I first set it, What death Christ died for our sinnes by the witnesse of holy Scriptures, and not what sufferings went before, or what other things ioyned with his death, which is the hole that you would faine hide your selfe in. To that intent, which I set downe, my reasons drawen from the

Iewish sacrifices and Christians sacraments did, and doe still stand effectuall. For the olde sacrifices must figure, and the new Sacraments must seale whatsoeuer death in Christ was the full and perfect ransome of our sinnes. But they foreshew and confirme the bodily death of Christ onely; they neither shew not signifie the death of the soule, nor the death of the damned. Therefore the bodily death of Christ onely is the full and perfect ransome of our sinnes: the death of the soule, and the death of the damned, as they serued nothing to our Redemption, so were they not suffered in the soule of Christ.
            Two cauils you offer against the first part of this reason touching the sacrifices of the fathers before and vnder the law. One that they figured not the whole sacrifice, as neither Christes Deitie, his soule, nor his resurrection: the next that all the sacrifices of the Iewes did not signifie his bodily death, because the Scape goate, which was a sinne offering, was not slaine. Of trifling you talke much, this is more then trifling, it is plaine shifting. Christes deitie could be no part of that sacrifice which suffered for sinne; the diuine Maiestie can not suffer either paine or sorrow. To what ende then come you in with Christes Godhead, when you talke of his suffering for sinne? His soule, you say, was not figured by those sacrifices.] The suffering death in his soule was indeed no way figured by them; but that the mediatour should haue an humane soule to bee separated from his body by death, before hee could make purgation of our sinnes; that was more then figured by those sacrifices. For since not the blood of beasts, but of man, and euen of the Sonne of God made man, was by Gods promise to be shed for our sinnes; It is euident that from life to death he could not come, but by seuering his soule from his body. And consequently he must haue a soule being a man, which must be powred out vnto death, before he could die, euen as the powers of life in bloody sacrifices were parted from their flesh, before they could be offered as sacrifices vnto God.

               charge you vntruely when I say, you expound your whole and absolute Redemption to be of all the fruites and causes of our Redemption: you haue no such word nor meaning as fruites.] Your words are our whole and absolute Redemption, and those I say containe the whole course of our saluation euen vnto the last step, which is our glorification, as I haue formerly prooued by Christes owne speech. Againe if the Treati pa. 11. li 30. resurrection of Christ, which is your owne instance, bee a part of that propitiatorie sacrifice, because it was a necessarie consequent, then all the benefites that Christ obtained for vs, or bestowed on vs, must be comprised in that his oblation for sinne. For they are all necessarie consequents and effects of our Redemption, and depend on these two branches; his death to free vs from sinne, and his resurrection to raise vs into a new and heauenly life now & for euer. He was 
               Rom. 4. 
               deliuered (to death) for our sinnes, and rose againe for our iustification. From these two heads the Scriptures deriue not onely forgiuenes of sinnes, but newnesse of life on earth, and happinesse of life in heauen. Yet you did not call them fruits. Effects you called them, and what is a ioyfull effect, such as was Christs resurrection, but a fruit? and that as well in Christ as in vs? When the Prophet saith of Christ Esay. 53. 
               he shall see the trauaile of his soule, and be satisfied, what meaneth he but the fruits and effects of Christs labour? when for his obedience to death, God highly exalted him, and gaue him a name aboue euery name, that euery knee should bow vnto him, what is this but a fruite and reward of his humiliation, first, in his owne person, then proportionably in all that be his?

               Many of the Iewes sacrifices, yea most of them, did represent and signifie Christs bodily sufferings onely, yet not all. Therefore you may well deny mine assumption, as you did before; and affirme that certaine Iewish Sacrifices set forth the sufferings euen of the soule of Christ, and not of his body only.] Did I any where say that all the Iewish sacrifices were bloudy? or that all of them did represent Christs death and blood shedding? Could I be ignorant, that the Iewes had oblations made onely by fier, as of flower, wine, and incense? and also offerings of the first fruits, and other things dedicated or presented to the Lord for the vse of his tabernacle and Temple? Doth not the Apostle say; Heb. 5. 
               Euery

high Priest is ordayned for men to offer GIFTES and SACRIFICES for sinne? Where gifts shew, that things without life were offered as well as liuing beasts and birds which were slaine. As then there was no cause, nor neede I should, so I neuer vsed the word ALL in that case, vnlesse I added liuing or BLOODY Sacrifices. For they by their life lost and blood shed figured the death of Christ Iesus. But this ALL is your adding to my wordes, that you may take occasion to pike some quarrell at them.
            
               But you may well deny my assumption, that no sacrifices of the Iewes did figure the sufferings of Christs soule.] I assumed no such thing, neither did I meddle with the sufferings of Christs soule, vnlesse they were the death of the soule, or the paines of hell, which the Scripture calleth the second death; and I the death of the damned; because none besides the damned die that second death: but you plainly giue me the slip; and conuey your selfe from speaking of the death of the soule or of the death of the damned, which are the things in Question, to the sufferings of the soule in generall, of which I make no Question. And though your meaning be, vnder the sufferings of the soule to comprise the tormenting of Christs soule by the immediate hand of God with the selfe same paines which the damned do feele in hell; Yet such is your cariage, that euery where you suppresse your maine intent, and make a faire shew with the sufferings of Christs soule, as if you ment no more, but that Christs soule must needs haue some sufferings proper to it selfe; which you confesse I sundry times teach; and yet you make your Reader beleeue, I euer impugne. You shall doe well to awake out of this slumber and call to minde, that there are no sufferings of Christs soule now in question, but the DEATH of the SOVLE, or of the DAMNED; which you dare not openly auouch, and therefore you plaster them ouer with smoother termes of the sufferings of the soule; to hide your secret mysteries till you meete with itching eares, that will listen more to fansies then to faith. Another peece of skill you shew in this place, to ease your selfe of all proofe, and thinke it enough if you once denie it. For where you affirme that certaine Sacrifices of the Iewes set foorth (those) sufferings of Christs soule, which you meane; and I vtterly denied that any sacrifices of the Iewes did shew the suffering of hell paines in Christs soule, or any other kind of death besides the death of the body only: you take not the paines to make any proofe of that you a

To the last, which is the chiefest, you take the paines to say little; and so giue the Reader to vnderstand, that your bolde assertion is the best foundation of your proofe: for if you can not shew, as you neither doe nor can, that the Scape-goat by the Scriptures suffered any thing; how will you bring it about, that the Scape-goat figured the sufferings of Christes soule? shall no suffering be a figure of suffering? such may your figures be; but the wisdome of God maketh figures for similitude and resemblance to the trueth; and not for contrarietie to it, as you do.

In as plaine words as the former be, or any can be, that goat on which the lot fell for the Lord, must be made readie, that is, sacrificed for sinne, of which he spake at first; and that which was the peoples sinne-offering must be slaine, and his blood brought within the vaile. But neither of these agree to the Scape-goat: therefore the Scapegoat was not the sinne offering for the people, which the Scripture in that place mentioneth.Defenc. pa. 37. li. 21. 
               These words (you say) proue not that the Scape-goat was no sinne-offering at all.] These particular circumstances doe plainly proue, which of the two goats was made the peoples sinne-offering, and so conuince that you inlargc the words of Moses without any iust ground to serue your owne conceit. Two sinne-offerings were not taken from the people, but two goats were taken for sinne, and one of them sacrificed for the people, as was after prescribed and performed; and Aaron commanded for him and his houseLeuitic 16. vers. 6. 
               to offer a bullocke for his sinne-offering. So that where the Scripture mentioneth no moe sinne-offerings for the people but one, neither vseth the word AASA but to one of them; that one was prepared and slaine by Gods commandement as a sinne-offering for the people, where the Scape-goat was preserued aliue, and sent away into the wildernesse, to shew the force of the former sacrifice by carying with it the sinnes of the people.
            
               Defenc pag. 37. li. 28. 
               I take a sacrifice and offering in the largest sense, as signifying any consecrated thing giuen to God to appease him for sinne. And such vnbloudie sinne-offerings very manie we shall finde in Moses Law. Wherefore the Scape-goat may be a sinne-offering, though it were not slaine or bloudie.] That the word Sacrifice may be diuersly taken, and applied to things vnbloudie and ghostly, I haue no doubt: but that one and the same word, in one and the same place, should import both a bloudie and vnbloudie sacrifice for sinne, is a shift of yours without all sense, it hath no shew in the sacred Scriptures. Againe, the sacrifices for sinne, were they bloudie or vnbloudie, which are mentioned in Moses law, and namely in all those places which you quote in your margin; they were all without exception OFFERED to God by FIRE; the things liuing suffered first death by effusion of bloud; the things without life, as flowre, oyle, wine, and such like, were cast into the fire where the bloudie sacrifices were burned; and so without bloud or fire no sacrifice for sinne is appointed in Moses law. Since then the Scapegoat was neither slaine nor touched with fire, but sent forth aliue into the wildernesse; what do those examples of things vnbloudie, yet offered by fire, helpe you to proue, that the Scape-goat liuing was such a sinne offering as many are found in Moses law?

For as the slaine so the Scape-goat, we see, was CONSECRATED to the Lord, and here OFFERED (to make reconciliation by him) and separated from men, and bar

That the Scape-goat was consecrated or offered, there are no such wordes in Moses text; except you meane, that the bringing of the goat before God was the offering of it, and the praying ouer it was the consecrating of it; but these be sillie coniectures to proue the consecration and oblation of a Sacrifice. The Scape-goat therefore was not the halfe sinne-offering of the people as you pretend; it was a sensible figure of the acceptance of the former Sacrifice, whose bloud was carried within the vaile, and made a full propitiation for all their sinnes; as much as those Sacrifices could effect. And in token thereof the Priest was willed before their faces by imposing his hands and confessing their iniquities, to let them see, that the Lord remoued all their sinnes out of his sight, as that goat was caried away from the sight of men into the wildernesse. So that the Scape-goat was nothing giuen to God for sinne as you would haue it, but shewed rather a reiection and detestation of sinne by his departure into the desert, and was no sanctified and accepted sacrifice for sinne, as the other was who
                  •…

               Was not the Scape-goat then a figure of Christ as well as the slaine goat?] Though certaineThe Scape-goat might in some sort be a figure of Christ. Fathers doe sometimes resemble the Scape-goat to the wicked and reprobate, which is not so wide a wandering from the trueth, as your wresting it to signifie the sufferings of Christes soule; yet neither did I, nor doe I gainsay, but the Scape-goat might in some sort be a figure of Christ, notwithstanding all things in it can not be proportioned to Christ, for so no figure can match him: yet that doth not proue it to be sacrifice for sinne, much lesse to foreshew the sufferings of Christes soule. There were many figures of Christ, yea of Christes death, as the Brasen Serpent, the Rocke in the desert; Sampson, Ionas, and many such, which were no sacirfices; and so might the Scape-goat prefigure either the cause or shame of his death or both, as the slaine goat did the maner and power of his death, and yet be no sinne-offering.

               , as a thing deuoted to destruction for others, or an of-scouring of the people. The truth of either of these figures was exhibited in Christ, because he was the lambe of God, whose slaying abolished the sinnes of the world; and that he might be 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , (one deuoted or appointed to beare the plague for others;) all beautie was quenched in him, and he reiected of men. There may be brought a more curious speculation, that the sending away of the (Scape-goat) was a figure of Christes resurrection; but I embrace that which is more simple and certaine, that the goat sent away aliue and free was VICE PIACVLI (as a thing deuoted to beare the brunt for others) that by his departure and leading away, the people might be assured their sinnes did vanish, and were caried farre out of sight. So that though the Priest brought one goat aliue for a reconciliation, yet God was not pacified without bloud, quia vis expiationis a sacrificio alterius Hirci pendebat, because the force of cleansing sinne depended on the sacrifice of the other (slaine) goat. Thus haue we manie significations of the Scape-goat referred euen to Christ by old and new writers, and euen by some whom you would seeme most to follow; and yet none of them applieth it to the sufferings of Christes soule. So that your assertion in that behalfe is but your meere imagination, farther from the words of Moses, than their coniectures which you count widest off. But you will proue it by maine might, that shall remoue mountaines before it.

               must needs be then that the (Scape-goate) signified Christ, yea doubtlesse Christ man. For the godhead could be no sinne-offering neither did it make reconciliation for sinne, neither did the Deitie beare our sinnes vpon him properly; all which the Scape-goate did. If it were Christ man, it could not be his body, for his body was slaine bloudily, the Scape-goate was not slaine. It must then be of necessitie (I thinke) the humane MORTALL Soule, which the Scape-goate signified.] I know not whether you make the Soule of Christ mortall as your words here stand, because he suffered the death of the soule as you imagine, or whether this were the scape of your Printer; but by such demonstrations as these are, supported with figures and fansies of your owne making, you may prooue what you will. That the Brasen Serpent was a figure of Christs death, Christ himselfe witnesseth. Whence you may inferre after your manner, that Christ had no true flesh nor felt death. For the Brasen Serpent had neither flesh to feele, nor life to loose. So the Lord expresseth, that Matth. 12. 
               Ionas was a figure of his lying in the graue; and yet was Ionas aliue in the Whales belly. May it therefore be concluded that Christ was neuer dead, nor buried, because Ionas indeede was neither? Figures haue a resemblance to some things in Christ, not to all; as the brasen Serpent to his fastning on the Crosse, and sauing all that beheld him in faith; Ionas to the time that he lay in his graue, and to the impossibilitie conceaued of his resurrection. So the Scape-goate notwithstanding your must needs be, and could not be, migh

                signifie the impassible godhead of Christ, as Theodoret, and Isychius affirme, since power to take away sin and to cleanse it, without any suffering for it, is proper to God. It might likewise resemble the detestation and hatred the Iewes had of Christ when they cryed, Iohn. 19. 
               away with him, away with him, if the vsage of the people towards the Scape-goate were such as Tertullian describeth; which was to spit at him, punch him, and curse him, as he was caried out of the Citie. And where he went away aliue for all their spites and wrongs, that might declare either his resurrection into life eternall which they could not touch, or else the disposition of his life here not left in the peoples hands, but reserued to his owne power, till he did willingly offer it as a sacrifice vnto God. Ambrose saith of him. Ambro. de incarn dom. Sacramento. ca. 5. 
               Quasi arbiter exuendi suscipiendique corporis, emisit spiritum non amisit. As hauing power in himselfe to lay aside and to take againe his body, he sent foorth his soule, he lost it not. And likewise Eusebius. When

               . So (loosed from all force) and resting free, him selfe of him selfe made the departure from his body. This the Scape-goate I say might figure, as some ancient Fathers auouch, & your reasons to the contrary are but rushes,

vnfit to conclude such a cause; considering that no figure agreeth in all things with the truth, for then it should be no figure but the truth, and you collect some small disagreements betweene the figure and the truth..
            Againe as you suppose for some petite difference the Scape-goat could not figure the deity, nor body of Christ: so I vpon stronger grounds collect, it could not signifie the proper sufferings of Christs soule, & if your word were of any waight, your selfe auouch that which I entend.

Can you so closely conuey contradictions, as in your treatise to tell vs the sacrifices of beasts could not prefigure the immortall soule of Christ, and in your defence to assure vs it must be ofnecessitie that the Scape-goat signified the humane soule of Christ? Besides if the Scapegoat signified Christs soule sent away from his body, for the other goat was first slain; it must of force import Christs death; for without death, his soule was not separated from his body. And so by your vrging that it could not signifie Christs death, you plainly confirme it did signifie Christes death. Thirdly the place whither the Scapegoat was sent, was the Leuit. 16. vers. 22. 
               Wildernes and a land vnhabitabie. Now the soule of Christ seuered from his body, went to heauen as you hold or to Paradise. Is heauen or Paradise with you become a wildernes & a land not inhabited? Fourthly the Scape-goat after he was sent away, did Ibidem. beare vpon him all the sinnes of the people. Dare you say that Christs soule departed from his body did beare or suffer the punishment of the peoples sinnes? Your meaning is but to

The Reader is well holpen vp to rest on your word, and to beleeue SOME SVCH MATTER AS YOV AYME AT. But backe to the matter indeed, and then your Reader shall finde euen by your owne confession, besides my proofes, that you do but ayme at these things vpon the bare surmise of your own braine; and that you can shew no sacrifices of the Iewes which did figure the proper sufferings of Christs foule; much lesse the death of his soule which is the matter that we differ about, howsoeuer you would now loose your necke out of the coller.

They might well serue to make the sacrifice the sweeter, and the fuller, and so resemble the fragrancie and sufficiencie of Christs death; but what reason you haue to make Christes life to be thought his death; and his merits all one with his sufferings; and things without sense or life to figure the sufferings of his soule, and you know not what besides; I doe not see, but onely that your will is your best weapon, when you be put to the push of any proofe.

               very like are your three reasons brought to shew that the Holocaust can not signifie the sufferings of whole Christ, and therefore not of his soule any way.] Whether the Holocaust
               What the Holocaust did signifie. were a figure of Christes sacrifice, or did represent the ioynt sufferings of the whole manhood of Christ, neither of these is in question betwixt vs. You tooke vpon you to shew, that the Iewes by their sacrifices were directed to beleeue the suffering of that which you call hell paines in the soule of Christ, when he offered himselfe for our sinnes. That was the point which I denied. The shedding of Christes bloud vnto death, the Apostle in the ninth and tenth Chapters to the Hebrewes, doeth plainely deduce from those bloudie sacrifices of the Iewes; other sufferings of Christ from their sacrifices he doth not deriue. The Holocaust, you replied, was Trea. pa. 13. li. 18. 
               euery whit chopt in peeces, and altogether put into the fire and burnt. I answered this was done after the death of the sacrifice, whose dead body was wholly consumed to ashes with one and the selfe same sire; and therefore this could not be referred to the proper sufferings of Christs soule; which could not suffer any thing after the death of the body, much lesse be wholly consumed with any sufferings common to the body, since the body of Christ it selfe neither was, nor could be consumed with any corruption or affliction. Besides that you your self in the leafe before made a plaine resolution, that those Trea. pa. 11. li. 24. 
               Sacrifices of beasts, could not prefigure the immortall and reasonable soule of Christ. How then could the dead bodies of those beasts cut in peeces and quite consumed with fire, represent the inward and proper sufferings of the soule?
            
               Is there 
               Defen. pa. 40. li. 13. 
               any Similitude concurring in all points and circumstances with the thing signified?] If it did, it were the trueth it selfe, and not a figure thereof. And therefore all your illations that the Scape-goate, which in some things disagreed from the Deitie and body of Christ, could signifie neither, were vaine and idle. It sufficeth in figures warranted by the word of God, that one principall action or circumstance bee common to both, in how many things so euer they bee otherwise different. But where is your warrant in the Scriptures, that the burning of sacrifices when they were dead, signified the sufferings of Christes soule? Shew that, and then wee will soone dispence with the rest of your rules and my reasons also. Figures expressed in the word of God had no doubt their similitude to the trueth, though we perhaps see it not; and if any one point of resemblance be ratified by Gods authoritie, that may and must content vs. But will you of your owne head make figures to fit your fansies, and then claime the same prerogatiue, which God himselfe hath? What if many figures in the Law had

as great disparagement as you call it, To the things signified, as the burning of the Holocaust to the sufferings of Christes soule? Is that a president for you to deuise and establish what figures please you, and thence to raise platformes for strange and newe doctrine?

                  ine were after caried out of the host. Now these signified Christs going out of Ierusalem to be slaine, but being yet aliue. The burning of the beasts after they were dead, was a sacrifice of a sweete sauour vnto God, which in trueth is Christs very death, and nothing done by him afterward, whereby Gods anger is fully pacified toward vs.] In figuratiue and bloudie sacrifices could you distinguish the suffering, which was proper to the liuing creature that was offered, from the offering which was peculiar to the Priest, and from the accepting which belonged onely vnto God, you would not thus iumble them together both in the figures signifying, and in the thing signified. That the bloud of the carnall sacrifices slaine vnder the Lawe, did foreshew the bloudshedding and death of Christ Iesus for the sinnes of the world, the Apostle to the Hebrewes is very plaine, not onely calling him amongst other things

               , a similitude for the time present, but also making diuers comparisons betwixt them and the bloud of Christ, and proouing by the first testament that the second must be ratified with bloud and death. By which as by figures were sufficiently testified, the ioynt sufferings of the whole manhood of Christ euen vnto death. For the powers of

And that being made so manifest to all mens eyes by the death of the liuing sacrifices, what needed the burning of the same after it was dead and senselesse, obscurely to intimate if not falsely, that the fire of affliction as you would haue it, should consume the Messias? God had therefore another meaning, as I take it, in commanding ech sacrifice after it was slaine, to be offered to him by fire. Forwhere of all creatures subiect to mans sight and sense, fire was the fittest for the light, heate, force, and motion thereof to designe vnto the people, the brightnesse of Gods glorie, the zeale of his holinesse the grace of his Spirit, and seate of his habitation in the heauens; God gaue the Iewes fire from heauen to burne perpetually on his Altar; which did teach them with what cleannesse of hands and feruentnesse of heart, the things which hee required, should bee offered vnto him; and did separate the sacrifices dedicated vnto God from all prophane abuse and humane vse; and made them ascend towardes the place of his glorious presence, that he might accept them with fauour, and be pleased with them. All which significations of heauenly fire were most perfectly accomplished in the sacrifice of Christ Iesus. For neuer man nor Angel offered vnto God any seruice with like puritie and charitie, as the Lord Iesus offered himselfe to his Fathers will; and that his oblation did not onely clense his body from all corruption of mortalitie and infirmitie, as appeared by his resurrection; but pearced the heauens with admirable celeritie and efficacie, and preuailed in the presence of God to bee a sweete smelling sauour for all the sonnes of God.
            Some of these things you seeme to acknowledge, As fire to signifie the

               Acceptation of Christs death, in that it was a sacrifice of a sweete sauour ascending vp to God. WhatWhat fire did signifie in sacrifices. reason then haue you that fire should note the wrath of God powred out on Christes soule and body before he died? Shall one and the same fire in one and the same sacrifice import both gracious acceptance with God, and terrible vengeance from God? These be contraries in mine eyes, whatsoeuer they be in yours.

               Elias, doe plainly prooue, which God with fire from heauen consumed, not in token of any displeasure against them, or dislike of their offerings, but in signe of very fauorable acceptations both of their persons and sacrifices. Euen so at the first offerings

of Aaron Leuit. 9. 
               the glory of the Lord appeared to all the people and there came a fire from the Lord, and consumed the burnt offering vpon the Altar; which when all the people saw, they gaue a shout for ioy and fell on their faces. This fire descending from God and consuming that sacrifice, God commaunded to keepe Leuit. 6. vers. 12. 13. 
               burning for euer on his Altar, and none might approch to him with any other fire in incense or offering: in so much that when Nadab and Abihu the sonnes of Aaron tooke strange

                  ire to offer before the Lord, and not of that which alwaies burned on the Altar, God Leuit. 10. 
               destroyed them with fire. The fire then which consumed the sacrifices of the Iewes was miraculously deliuered them by God, and ioyfully receaued of all the people, and therefore did not argue to them any wrath or vengeance on their sacrifices, but rather the fauour and good liking of God, which the Scripture noteth by the sweete odour of the sacrifice. As when Noah made his 
               Genes. 8. 
               burnt offerings to ascend (by fire) the Scripture saith, the Lord smelled a sauour of rest, that is, he shewed himselfe to be appeased, and his anger to rest. So when Aaron and his sonnes were to be consecrated Priests, God said to Moses, Exod 29. 
               Thou shalt make to smell, (by fier) (that is, thou shalt burne) the whole Ram, as a burnt offering; it shall be to the Lord a sauour of rest: that is a pleasing sacrifice. And for that cause God willed the Iewes in their peace offerings, whereby they gaue thanks for their safetie and prosperitie, to vse fire; and saith of it, Leuit. 3. v. 5. ISSHE, this burning by fire, (or this sacrifice made by fire) is a sauour of rest vnto the Lord. And so in incense, which Saint Iohn resembleth to the 
               Reuel. 8. 
               prayers of the Saints, fire was likewise required, to teach them, that their prayers went vp before God as the smoke of sweete odours, and were accepted of him. Then not affliction or indignation on the Sacrifice was declared by the fire which God commaunded to be vsed in all kinds of sacrifices, but rather an ascending vp to the presence of God, and an accepting thereof in the sight of God, which is farre from your suffering of hell paines in the soule of Christ, for which you bable so much in both your bookes.
            But the Apostle sayth, as the bodies of beasts were burnt without the campe, so Christ
               Christs suffering without the gate of the Citie. 
               suffered without the gate.] Were it granted, that fire in Sacrifices did signifie probation or affliction, which is no way proued; you are no whit the neerer to your suffering of hell paines in the soule of Christ. For the bodies of beasts, sayth the Apostle, were burnt, which can by no pretense of these wordes be stretched farder than the afflictions of Christes bodie, when he was carried to be crucified without the gate. And the chopping of the holocaust in pieces, that it might the more conueniently be layed on the wood to burne, maketh as slender proofe, that Christes soule suffered the paines of hell, notwithstanding your graue deuice, that Christes soule was chopt in pieces, and not his bodie; which conceits of yours, declare your follie, but helpe not your cause. Those Sacrifices whereof part was burnt by fire, and the rest reserued for the Priest, and sometimes for the owner that brought them to feast before the Lord, had their bloud shed at the doore of the Tabernacle as well as the other, and so resembled the death of Christ no lesse than the other, though God would haue no part of the one to be eaten by the Priests or people, as the other were, but to be wholly consumed by fire, because they were wholly reserued or dedicated vnto him. And this the Apostle respecteth in that comparison which he maketh of the bodies of beasts burnt without the campe, whereof the Priests that serued in the Tabernacle could not be partakers. They were consumed by fire, because the Priests should not eat thereof; to foreshew, as the Apostle noteth, that such as were addicted to the seruice and ceremonies of the Law and the outward Temple, could not be partakers of the trueth, which is in Christ, except they did leaue those elements of the Law, which seemed so glorious in their eyes; and followed Christ out of the gate, bearing his reproch; whose bloud was most holy and most sufficient to sanctifie the people, though hee were cast out of the citie to suffer as a malefactour and wicked person. Neither were the dead bodies of those beasts consumed by fire out of the campe, to make them sacrifices vnto God; for then must they haue beene burnt on the Altar, which was at the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation within the citie, as the holocausts

were; but after they were slaine before the doore of that Tabernacle, and their bloud brought and sprinckled on the hornes of the Altar of incense, and before the vaile of the Sanctuarie, and their fat burned on the Altar of burnt offerings in the Court; then was the rest caried out of the campe to be consumed with fire, that no man might eat thereof. The place whither, and the purpose why the dead bodies of those beasts were carried forth from the vse of the Priests, are touched by the Apostle in the thirteenth to the Hebrues; but the maner of burning them after their bloud was sprinckled, and their fat offered vnto God vpon his Altar by sacred fire, he no way compareth with the sufferings of Christes bodie, much lesse of his soule, neither of which was consumed in Christes passion without the gate as their bodies were by fire without the campe. For the fire of probation and affliction by the witnesse of holy Scripture, consumeth only the wicked; which are as drosse andEsa. 5. v. 24. Nah. 1. v. 10. 1. Co

            So that my first and second exceptions stand good for ought you haue proued to the contrarie. No Scripture doth warrant, that fire in Sacrifices did signifie the torments of Christs bodie, much lesse the proper sufferings of Christes soule, least of all the paines of the damned; but rather, as I haue shewed, the perfection and puritie of Christs sacrifice before God, and the acceptation thereof with God; which are things farre distant from your deuice. As also that Christes bodie or soule were wholly consumed by any affliction when he suffered for our sinnes; this hath neither ground in the word of God, nor trueth in it selfe. Which reason you cunningly skip, and say, my
               Def. pag. 41. 
               second exception is also nothing. What mine exceptions were, my words are plaine.Conclus. pa. 236. li 30. 
               Why the burning of the holocaust should signifie Christs affliction on the crosse either in body or in soule, I see no proofe made by this Confuter; and why they should not resemble Christs afflictions before death, these two reasons moue me: First it was burnt after it was dead; next it was wholly consumed by fire: neither of which can accord with Christes sufferings on the crosse. This was, as all men may see, my second exception, and not that which you subiect in place thereof. That indeed sheweth how carelesly you concluded against your selfe. For where you make such a stirre for the PROPER sufferings of the soule of Christ, when you come to exemplifie them but in a figure, you bring the burning of the bodie of the holocaust, which either wholly excludeth the sufferings of the soule, or admitteth none but those that were also common to the bodie of Christ, and so your PROPER sufferings of Christes soule are cleane without your owne example. But now you amend the matter, and plainly affirme, that

To proue the proper sufferings of the soule, you proportion out the sufferings of the whole man, which are common to bodie and soule; and these because they are chiefly in the soule, you make proper vnto the soule. By that reason all the sufferings of the bodie are proper likewise to the soule; because the sense of them is chiefly, if not onely in the soule. But what will you not say, that speaking both monstrously and falsely in your firie humor, salue it all with as it were? The soule of Christ, you say, was AS IT VVERE chopt in pieces, and as it were quite consumed; and so in effect, when your words, which should be proper and positiue in points of faith, are absurd and senselesse, you imagine they may be as it were like to be true. Did you professe to speake figuratiuely and not properly, as in positions of Religion you ought to do, many phrases might be borne withall which otherwise are intolerable: but when your assertions are out of all square and trueth; then to qualifie them with as it were (which is a shift, though verie shamefull, thorowout

your booke in the greatest matters in question) and still to defend them as principles of Christian religion; this is fit for no man but for him that maketh a Maygame of p

            With like learning you cure the contrarietie that you readily ranne into, whiles ouer egerly you pursued your owne purposes forgetting what fell from you in other places. For where in your Treatise for an aduantage you sayd,Trea. pa. 11. 
               those sacrifices (of beasts) could not prefigure the immortall and reasonable soule of Christ; and in your Defence you resolutely inferre,Defenc. pa. 39. li. 11. 
               It must then be of necessitie (I thinke) the humane soule of Christ, which the Scape-goat signified, which was a true sinne-offering: This you can FVL EASILY reconcile, and that without trifling. In the former place you meant generally and for the most part, but not alwayes, nor altogether: Againe, the Scape-goat and the holocaust do not, in respect as they are bodily things, represent the soule of Christ or any matter pertaining to it; but the particular vsage and maner of action about them, doth liuely represent the sufferings of Christes soule.] This indeed is not trifling, but plaine tumbling in the mire. Your words were: those sacrifices (of beasts) could not prefigure the immortall and reasonable soule of Christ. Your new correction is now, you meant they did not ALVV AIHS nor ALTOGETHER represent meere bodily sufferings. What is your new addition but a cleere confession, that your former words were false? For if those sacrificcs did not alwayes nor altogether represent Christs bodily sufferings, then sometimes they prefigured the sufferings of his soule. But you sayd, they wereTrea. pa. 11. li. 9. & 12. ALTOGETHER VNFIT for those inward and inuisible things, NEITHER HAD THEY ANIE RESEMBLANCE TOGETHER. Altogether vnfit, and not altogether vnfit to represent the sufferings of the soules; as also not any resemblance and some resemblance are contradictions in our countrey, whatsoeuer they be in yours.
            But since you can not alwayes nor altogether hit the trueth, you will now goe to it with respects. The Scape-goat and the holocaust, you say, doe not in that respect as they are bodily things, represent the soule of Christ, or any matter pertaining to it.] In that respect as they are bodily things without any sacred action or passion, they figure neither bodie nor soule of Christ, nor are indeed any figures at all. But you speake of sacrifices of beasts, which can not beare that name in the Scriptures without some sacred action and passion ordeined by God to praefigure the sacrifice of his Sonne. And where euery thing which was appointed of God to foreshew the comming and dying of his Sonne, was a figure of him, not in respect of any bodily matter or forme, (for so all things of that kinde should naturally haue beene figures of Christ, and not by gods appointment, which is most absurd and false:) but in regard of some holie, rare, or beneficiall action, passion, or propertie authorized by God to represent the power and vertue of Christ appearing in our flesh; you like a deepe Diuine seuer from those sacrifices all sacred actions and passions ordained by God, to make them both sacrifices and figures, and then tell vs that in respect of their earthly and bodily substance they were no figures of Christes soule. When you sayd Sacrifices, you included those sacred actions and passions, which made them sacrifices and figures of Christes sacrifice; and therefore to exclude them againe with an idle respect, is a silly and emptie refuge. If vnder bodily things you comprise externall and sensible actions and passions; then is it euident, that by sensible signes in those Sacrifices God did alwayes and altogether declare the ioynt sufferings of Christ for the sinnes of the world, but not the paines of hell nor the death of the soule, from which you alwayes and altogether slide, vnder pretence of my grosse vttering it, though I vtter it in the selfe-same words and parts which the Scripture doth. But how considerate are you, when you vouch, that theTrea. pa. 41. 
               Scape-goat representeth not Christes soule, vnlesse onely in respect of the escaping of it, when the other goat died; & yet not the body of the holocaust, but the vtter consuming by sire of the whole, signifieth the sufferings of whole Christ? What agreement hath ESCAPING with VTTER CONSVMING? and yet you make both these actions to be figures of the sufferings of Christes soule. So that Christes soule by your refined figures did escape free from death, and not escape free from death (for

you defend that Christ died the death of the soule) and was vtterly consumed, and could not be consumed; but as it were escaped, and yet escaped not, and was at it were vtterly consumed, and yet could no way be consumed, but escaped free and vntouched as the Scape-goat did. Such is your settlednesse, that yea and no, with you, are as it were all one.

Sacrifices had their respect to Christes death, not to any thing further or afterwards.] All things are farre fetcht with you, that come not from the whirlepoole of your owne head. It is the iudgement of S. Austen and other learned Fathers, which you so lightly esteeme. Aug. contra

               Agreeably (to the sacrifices) did heauenly fire consume all things that were done by our Sauiour in the bodie, and restored them all neerer to the nature of his Diuinitie: for rising from the dead, he ascended to heauen: his passage to which place the nature of fire doth shew. To farder sufferings after Christes death no sacrifice had respect, because there neither were any, nor needed any; but to the efficacie and glorie consequent to Christes death, the fire in sacrifices had respect, as these Fathers affirme. Against whom though you euery where oppose the worm-eaten warrant of your owne words, I trust you will somewhat relent to the Apostles authoritie; who telleth you, that the Hebr. 9. v. 7.

Also you both here do seeme to double, vnderstanding by the holocaust both incorruption after death, and a perfect burning loue in vs now in this life; which things are farre distant, and can not stand together.] You are so giddie, that you dislike euerie thing; and so hastie, that you conceiue nothing right.

The Sacrifices then which (as you grant) primarily signified the person, passion and perfection of Christ, did secondly note and teach our dying to sinne, our rising againe in glorie and appearing before him in perfect holinesse; which in this life we endeuour but can not attaine to the full, till by death we be freed from sinne. The bearing of Christs Image is enough to iustifie Saint Austens speech. For he neither saith, that the holocaust did primarily signifie the members of Christ, nor that men could haue perfection of charitie in this life: but when Christ shall present vs righteous and glorious vnto his Father, then shall he offer vs as holocausts vnto God. And yet in the meane while what hindereth Saint Austen to exhort vs, that the Diuine fire of Gods wisedome and grace may wholy inflame vs, and euen consume vs?

Doth Baptisme shew no more in Christ, but that actuall and substantiall water ranne out of his side after he was dead? Is this the whole signification and rep

The bread and wine on the Lords table, besides the reference which they haue to the body of Christ broken and his blood shed, doe they not plainly shew the flesh of Christ is meate, and his blood drinke nourishing our soules to euerlasting life, as the elements support and maintaine the life of the body? Water in Baptisme doth it not declare the power of Christs death washing our soules, and of his spirit renuing our minds? These you say are 
               Defenc. pag. 42. li. 37. 
               spirituall effects wrought in vs not in Christ. Power to clense, quicken, nourish, and strengthen to eternall life, is that Christs or ours? We indeede are the persons that are clensed, quickened, nourished and strengthened; but the force and grace working these things in vs, is Christs and not ours. We receiue it as flowing from the fountaine, but it naturally springeth in him, and from thence is deriued to vs. The Sacraments then teach vs, that the fulnesse of power and grace dwelleth in Christ really and truely; which he is content shall worke in vs, but neuer leaue him. The water washing, the bread nourishing, the wine comforting, note no power in vs to do any of these things; it is euident impietie so to thinke or say; onely they assure vs, that as Christ the true owner of all these things, by his obedience vnto death, was made the onely disposer of them; so he will performe the couenant with vs, which the Sacraments doe seale vnto vs; and that is the couenant of mercie and grace in this life, and of glorie in the next; which the Sacraments could not seale, except they did signifie those gifts and effects to be actiuely and originally in the giuer; as they are passiuely in the Receiuers.
            
               Defenc. pag. 42. li. 38. VSVALLY Sacraments doe not represent spirituall effects or actes in Christ.] When text and trueth faile you, your fashion is to flie to phrases; and so still to saySacraments doe constantly and continually signifie and represent the same. somewhat, though it want both learning and vnderstanding. For example, Sacraments (you say) doe not VSVALLY represent spirituall effects or acts in Christ. Did you speake of nature, which often faileth; or of men, who change their minds, vsuall and vnusuall might serue for some purpose; but what is this to Sacraments? they constantly and continually keepe the same order in their significations and representations; so that vsuall and vnusuall in them are all one. The nature of the Element is still the same; the action prescribed may not be varied; the promise annexed neuer faileth on Gods part. So that what any Sacrament once resembleth or signifieth, it alwayes expresseth and obserueth the same. Will you diuert your wordes to diuers Sacraments, and make that vsuall to one, which is vnusuall to another? This which you vsually exclude from Sacraments, is common to both the Sacraments of the New Testament of which we reason; and being common to them both, as I haue shewed, to signifie spirituall effects or acts in Christ himselfe, with what trueth say you now, THEY do it not vsually, speaking of both; whereas both do it apparently and perpetually?

               These propose vnto vs no inuisible paines of hell, but the body of Christ wounded, and his bloud shed for the remitting of our sinnes, and vniting vs vnto Christ. Therefore your turning no inuisible paines of hell, which are my words, into no more then a bodily death, which are yours; and vnder pretence of those words, excluding from the Sacraments all other significations and representations of Christs inuisible power and grace proposed by them, sheweth your accustomed vain of misconstering and altering my words, when you cannot otherwise impugne them.

               make me to crosse the institution of the Lords table, because I said the Ceremonie of breaking the bread, cannot properly belong to Christs body. But euen here doe I not expressely say, that it sheweth forth how Christs body was broken for vs?] Where by Christs institution the bread was BROKEN, to note vnto vs the breaking of his body for our sinnes; and Paul expresseth that similitude of the bread broken to Christes body, in saying,s 1. Cor. 10. 
               The bread, which wee breake, is it not the communion of the body of Christ; and to verifie that resemblance, reporteth the words of Christs institution in effect to be these, This is my body which is broken for you: you to make a siely shew that the Sacraments declaret 1.

Wherein you first denie the Similitude betwixt the bread and the body of Christ, to be true in deedes but onely in words; because you doe not acknowledge the violence offered to Christs body by his persecutors, to bee any kind of breaking properly and truely. For howsoeuer with bigge words you talke of the anguish of Christes soule bruising his

               body ioyntly also; yet when you come to expresse your selse plainely, you say, Trea. pa. 5. li. 27. 
               This grieuous passion was in his soule immediatly and properly, seeing then his body was not touched with any smart. And since all sense of paine is in the soule; if by breaking you vnderstand not the violence offered to Christes body, in vaine come you in with your Sympathie, which may shew itselfe in the body, but not bee felt of the body, by reason the powers of sense are in the soule; and so you controle the Apostles words as voide of all trueth, whiles you referre them truely and properly to the soule, and not to the body but onely by Sympathie.
            The grounds, whereon you denie this Analogie betwixt the bread and the body of Christ, are as absurd and false, as the Conclusion, which you build on them; and are in number foure. 1. That Klômenon (in Greeke) is BROKEN TO PEECES properly.
               z Defenc. pa. 43. 2. That MEDVCCA in the Prophet (Esay) is also broken to peeces, properly, or crushed and beaten to POVVDER. 3. That Christes body was not properly broken. 4. That the breaking of the bread into many peeces, doeth first and immediatly set out the breaking of his soule.

And though Robert Steuen in his Thesaurus, set downe none other signification to the verbe Klân, but frango to breake; yet hee doth not thereby meane onely breaking of bones, or making of peeces as you ful wisely intend; but to breake generally, whatsoeuer or howsoeuer. And so Klân is to breake the straitnesse of any thing by wrying or bowing it, and the coherence of any thing by straining, tearing or cutting it, and the roundnesse or fulnesse of any thing by bruising it.

               Klan then, whence klômenon is deriued, importeth not necessarily the breaking of bones in mans body, as by your new Diuinitie you haue lately deuised, to make way for your hell paines in the soule of Christ; but it signifieth generally to breake, as our English word doth, and frango with the Latines likewise; whether it be by bowing or straining that which is straight; by losing that which is fast; by bruizing that which is sound; or by cutting and seuering in part or in whole that which is coherent. And so much our English word BROKEN expresseth. We say the necke or backe is broken, when neither bone nor skinne is broken, but the fastning of the ioynts is losed. Likewise the head the face, the shinnes are broken, when the skin or flesh of these parts is by some violence razed or torne. Yea the veynes are broken with a rupture, and children are broken out when their flesh doth exulcerate. And since the diuiding of that which was coherent, (which the Phisitians call Galenus de Methodo medendi li. 6. 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , the solution of vnitie or continuitie,) whether it be strayning, cutting, razing, tearing, or bruizing the bones or flesh of mans body in part or in whole, is contained in the English word breaking, and in the Greeke word Klômenon; the Apostle spake properly enough when he said that Christs body was broken, for so much as all the ioynts of it were losed in sunder, the vaines and sinewes tornc with piercing and grating of Iron spikes,q Psal. 22. vers. 15. the flesh and the skinne cut and rent with thornes, whips, and speare, and bruized with staues; though the bones were not broken, which is your ignorant exception against the Apostles words.

DACHA indeede is properly to bruize whether it be with hand or foote, but not to peeces nor to powder, without some other word added to expresse so much. For your Lexicons, to which you so confidently appeale, consult that of Pagnine perused and augmented by Mercere, Ceuattere, and Bertrame, and Printed at Lyons in Fraunce Anno 1575. or Forsters Printed at Basile Anno 1564. and see whether they do not plainly reproue your folly.

               say. For where the Prophet saith, the Esa. 19. v. 10. 
               Nettes of Egypt shall be torne, that is farre from beating to powder, except you haue lately deuised the powder of Nettes to make a plaister of. And if we should say they were torne to pieces, what necessitie is there, that either this tearing should be properly breaking, which you admit not but in things that be stiffe and hard as bones and such like; or that those pieces should be diuided from the whole, and not rather be ruptures in the whole, as we see in torne nettes, which are not alwaies rent cleane a sunder?

That bruizing was vsed as well as cutting, to make men Eunuches, appeareth by Paulus Aegineta; where he sayth: Paulus Aegineta. lib. 6. cap. 68.

            These are the grounds on which you gather, the Prophet could not by that word meane the wounding and bruizing of Christes bodie; but because powder and pieces, as you dreame, are properly comprised in that theme, therefore it must be referred to the soule of Christ. As if pieces and powder came neerer in soules to the right signification of bruizing, than the mangling, tearing, and contusing of Christs body, which he suffered from the violent rage of the Iewes. Your other word of the very same nature, keepe to your selfe. When your proofs faile you in this, you may not be suffered to roue at your pleasure, and to reach after other words, & out of your own vnlearned skill to vouch, they are of the very same nature. Wherefore there is no cause why the coherence of Esaies wordes should be cut in sunder by your vnhandsome deuice of the peeces and powder of soules; but as the first words in that sentence, Esa. 53. v. 5. 
               he was wounded for our transgressions, and the last, with his stripes we are healed, are plainly referred to the punishments of Christes bodie; so the middest, he was bruized for our iniquities, should haue the same relation and intention, especially the Prophet foretelling the people, what they should see in their Messias, and how they should misiudge of him. 
               Ibid. v. 4. 
               We (sayth Esay) did iudge him as plagued and smitt

                  n of God, but he was wounded for our transgressions, and bruized for our iniquities, and with his stripes are we healed.
            
            Neither is it any strange thing in the Scriptures to ioyne this very word which you talke so much of with wounding as with a word of the same nature and force. For besides that Moses sayth, Deut. 23. 
               None wounded with any bruizing or

                  utting of his secret parts, shall enter into the Lords congregation; Dauid saith to God, Thou hast bruized Rahab, as one that is wounded. Where wounding & bruizing are more properly lincked together as words of like force and effect, than your breaking of soules into pieces, or beating them to powder. The verie same word is also vsed in the Scriptures, to note the bruizing of mans bodie by sicknesse, or of his estate by wrong and oppression. Dauid in a grieuous sicknesse complaining that he felt nothing sound in his flesh, nor any rest in his

bones; addeth: Psal. 38. v. 8. 
               I am weakned and bruized very much. Bruize not the poore in the gate, sayth Salomon; that is, oppresse not the poore in iudgement. The children of the foolish shall be Iob. 5. v. 4. 
               bruized (that is, oppressed) in the gate, and none shall deliuer them. And when it is applied to the soule, it may note that to be either wounded with sorrow, oppressed with wrong, or humbled with obedience; but as for powder and pieces, from which you would pull a iust proportion, which nothing can answere but the paines of hell, it is a sicke conceit of your owne braine; it hath no deriuation either from the Prophets or Apostles words.
            You did not meane, that Defenc. pa. 44. li. 18. & 29. 
               the soule might be properly broken in pieces, but that thus it is neerer and better applied to the soule than to the bodie; which was only pierced and boared thorow.] Then was your former opposition out of the Scripture very licentious, and your conclusion as friuolous. In that a bone of Christes was not broken, you inferred that Esaies words, He was broken for our sinnes, 
               Trea. pa. 10. li. 16. 
               could not be properly meant of Christes bodie, flesh, and bones: as if there were no breaking of ioynts, veines, sinewes, flesh, or skinne; but only of bones. And yet as if the soule of Christ, which is by nature altogether indiuisible, might properly be broken in pieces, you conclude the breaking of the bread can not properly belong to the bodie of Christ, BVT TO THE SOVLE. Had you denied the breaking of the bread properly to belong to either, your words must haue beene; It can belong properly neither to the bodie, nor to the soule; but you denie the one, and auouch the other; It can not belong properly to the body, but to the soule. Whether those words of yours doe not expresly import, that the breaking of bread doth properly belong to the soule of Christ, as to the trueth wherein they must be verified, I leaue it to the iudgement of the discreet Reader. [Howbeit, you denie not, but Defenc. pa. 44. li. 26. 
               broken applied to the soule (of Christ) is figuratiue.] And so you grant there was no cause you should take such exceptions as you did to the Apostles wordes, This is my bodie which is broken for you. For since it can not be verified of the soule, but figuratiuely as you now confesse; it may so be most iustly verified of Christes bodie, without any sense of hell paines suffered in the soule of Christ. And if the consent of the English, Latine, and Greeke tongues may be trusted for the vse of a word; breaking may properly be affirmed of Christes bodie, which can not be of his soule; for so much as his ioynts, veines, sinewes, flesh and skinne were broken and torne in sunder,Christs body truely broken by the iudgement of new and old writers. though his bones were not.
            And but that your fashion is to follow no man farder than your fansie leadeth you, you might haue seene with what reuerence and conscience Master Beza, that otherwise vpholdeth the sufferings of Christes soule, referreth this word KLOMENON to the tearings and torments of Christes bodie, being hereto led by the Apostles assertion. By the word Beze Annot. in epist. ad Cor. 1. ca. 11. v. 24. 
               broken (in Pauls wordes) is designed the kind
                     •…
                   of (Christes) death; because, besides that the Lords bodie was torne, bruized, and euen broken with most bitter torments, though his legges were not broken as the theeues were, Christ breathing out his soule with a most violent death, was as it were rent in two parts according to his humane Nature. This word then hath a MARVELLOVS EXPRESSE SIGNIFICATION, that the figure should fullie agree with the thing it selfe; to wit, that the breaking of the bread should represent to our minds the verie death of Christ. Peter Martyr hauing made your obiection, that a bone of Christ was not broken, resolueth: But

For if by piercing you meane all kinde of violence, that impressed any paine in the bodie; then is piercing farre larger and grieuouser than your kinde of breaking, which is of bones; and more than such piercing, Christes bodie needed not, to answer the similitude of breaking the bread. But if by piercing you meane boaring thorow, as you seeme to expound it; then did Christes bodie suffer manie violences, as buffeting, striking, whipping, piercing with thornes, and such like, which were no borings thorow. And so there is either no weight or no truth in your words, that Christes bodie was only pierced and boared thorow.
            
            
               Defenc. pa. 43. li. 37. 
               Vainly you charge me, I know not how often, against my expresse words, that I call hell, heauen, and descending, ascending; but here it is no wrong to charge you with such an absurditie
               Proper opposed to metaphoricall. 
               indeed, who expresly do make that, which you say is FIGVRATIVE, to be a proper denomination.] If I charge you falslie, when you come to the place conceale it not; in the meanetime, if there were any inconuenience in this, as there is none, it was the tracing of you in your owne termes. For you argued, that Christes bodie could not be sayd properly to be broken, because no bone of his was broken; and consequentlie it is your collection, that if a bone (which is but a part of Christes bodie) had beene broken, the bodie of Christ (which is the whole) might be sayd to haue beene properly broken. Mine answer was, that since Christs bodie had other parts besides his bones, which by his owne words are conteined vnder the name of his flesh, if any parts of his flesh were truelie broken, the whole body might be sayd to be properlie broken, as well in respect of his flesh, as of his bones. What absurditie find you in this, that first proceeded not from your selfe? But, were the words mine owne, when I speake as a Diuine of the proprietie of signification, calling that proper which is not metaphoricall; and affirme, that as the sense of the word BROKEN was proper in a part of Christes bodie, so must it likewise be proper and not metaphoricall in the whole, because the whole, which taketh his denomination from a part, must retaine the same signification of the word, which was verified in that part; what boyes play is it in you to come from metaphors to other kinds of figures, and to trifle with termes of proper and siguratiue (when I opposed proper to metaphoricall) and child
                  •…
               shlie to charge me, that I speake contraries with a breath? As if one and the same speech might not be figuratiue in expressing the whole for a part, which is Synecdoche, and yet reteine his proper signification, and be no metaphor. Except therefore your Grammar be so great, that euerie Synecdoche must needs be a metaphor; and your Logicke so little, that you can not distinguish a subiect from a predicate; I see no cause but one and the same speech or proposition may be figuratiue in the subiect, by vnderstanding the whole for a part; and yet proper in the predicate, by reason the sense thereof is not metaphoricall. For these be figurae dictionum, not orationum; figures of words, not of sentences. As in our case whether Christes bodie were properly broken, or no: if the bodie, which is the subiect in that proposition, by Synecdoche be taken for a part; then broken, which is the predicate, must the rather be properlie and not metaphoricallie affirmed of that part, which was truelie broken: how beit, as I thinke, since the proper sense of breaking was verified of all or the most parts of Christes bodie, it must likewise be verified of the whole bodie.
            But omit these Grammaticall and Logicall points, wherewith manie Readers are

not acquainted, and come to the verie pitch of my words. I doe not affirme, that the whole for a part is a proper speech, as you conceiue me; but that the whole from a part may properly (and not metaphorically) take his denomination. That a man speaketh, writeth, heareth; seeth, tasteth, smelleth, and such like, are they proper or figuratiue speeches in your censure? Proper I thinke; and yet no part in mans bodie is the instrument of speech besides the tongue, of writing besides the hand, of hearing besides the care, of seeing besides the eye, of tasting besides the mouth, of smelling besides the nose. Infinite are the actions of the bodie naturallie executed by certaine parts, as eating, drinking, sleeping, spetting, coughing, weeping, and other such, which no man in his right wits will affirme to be figuratiue actions or speeches in man; and yet in them all, a part doth denominate the whole. In the vertues and vices of the mind, as for men to be wise, sober, diligent, patient, liberall, learned, mindfull, watchfull, and such like, or the contrarie; shall we say, that men be figuratiuely and not properly and truely such, because these are gifts of the minde, and not of the bodie? The verie essentiall parts of man, as vnderstanding, will, reason, sense, and appetite; shall they likewise make figuratiue speeches in men, because none of them are common to all the parts and powers of bodie and soule, but in euerie of them a part doth denominate the whole? It may be you will not greatlie sticke to turne Porphyries predicables and Aristotles predicaments into Mosellanes tropes, and make figures of them all; what say you then to the branches of Christian faith and trueth? are they also figuratiue and improper speeches? That Christ is the sonne of God, and the sonne of Dauid; that he was borne of a virgine, and circumcised in the eight day; that he fasted, hungred, and was tempted; that he eat and slept, wept, and waxed weary; that he was buffeted, whipped, and crucified; that he died for our sinnes, and rose for our righteousnesse; that he ascended into heauen, and thence shall come to iudge the quicke and the dead; and an infinite number of the like: are all these figuratiue speeches in your conceit? I hope you be not so fastened to figures, that you will make vs a figuratiue faith, and a figuratiue Sauiour; and yet in all these, a part doth denominate the whole. Your eyes therefore were somewhat close, or your wits wandering, when you could not see the difference betwixt taking the whole for a part, and denominating the whole by a part; which is so common and constant both in Diuinitie and Philosophie, that in all naturall and necessarie actions, passions, and proprieties, the whole receiueth his attribute from a part. And so my words rest sound and true, both in humane reason and in holie Scripture, notwithstanding your vaine proclamation of so cleere and expresse an absurditie in them. But you must be borne with, your humor is so sharpe, and your head so shallow, that your left hand knoweth not what your right s

               not in any sense proportionable to the proprietie of the word KLO'MENON and MEDVCCA. You prate of PROPRIETIES and proportions to no end, but to colour your absurdities and presumptions. What Christian Reader will endure you to say, that the Apostle in applying the word KLO'MENON to the body of Christ, had neither proprietie nor proportion to the right sense of the word? If he did not speake properly in those words, (which is broken for you) as I thinke he did, yet at least he must speake metaphorically and figuratiuely, and so keepe a resemblance and proportion to the originall sense of the word; except your wisedome will auouch that the holy Ghost ignorantly

and vnaduisedly abuseth the word. Which if you confesse of your selfe, I will easily beleeue, because you neither know what you affirme, nor what you deny. For where afore you said in plaine words, Trea. pa. 14. 
               the breaking of the bread CAN NOT PROPERLY BELONG BVT TO THE SOVLE (of Christ,) Now you graunt it properly belongeth neither to body nor to soule; onely from powder and peeces you take a iust and full proportion in the soule to the proper sense of those words. You haue me in iealousie that Defenc. pa. 44. li. 16. 
               I thinke you to be a senslesse foole; indeed I thinke you to be more conceited then learned, and a great deale more shifting then sound, though in this booke you haue sought the helpe of all your friends to maintaine the most of your matters with as it were; but if you reiect the Apostles words as wanting both proprietie and proportion, except your hell paines be admitted; and make out iust and full proportions from powder and peeces vnto the soule of Christ, I doubt your Reader will thinke these be senslesse and foolish Toyes.
            If I would play with proportions as you doe, I neede not depart from the words of the holy Ghost to find a fairer resemblance to the proper sense of those words in the body of Christ crucified, then you make any. Psal. 22. v. 14. 
               All my bones are sundered, saith Dauid in the person of Christ, and & 15.

                  a. 8. 
               what else doe all these signifie but the condition of (Christs) dead body? Wherefore he presently addeth, and into the dust of death thou hast brought me. Here in expresse words is the dust of death to which Christs body was brought, and besides, all his bones were sundered. Now to be sundered is euidently to be diuided, and that must be with parts or peeces; the naturall coherence wherewith the bones were formerly ioyned, being losed and dissolued, though one part be not seuered from the other. Whether therefore the word broken be properly or figuratiuely taken, I see no cause why the Apostles words may not in either sense be fully true. For if the Ioynts, vaines, sinewes, flesh, and skinne of Christs body from head to foote were properly straeined, rent and torne, besides the seuering of his soule from his body; then was his body truely broken. If by breaking we figuratiuely meane, as others doe, the affliction and anguish of Christs body; then as no part was free from it, so no increase of bodily paine in this life could be added to his sufferings: and so in either respect your hell paines haue their pasport, till you find some fitter place and better proofe for them then either KLO'MENON or MEDVCCA.
            The next point you vndertake is whether the blood of Christ be the full RedemptionThe Defender aludeth the Scriptures with his termes of single & meere. as well of our bodies, as of our Soules in this life. Wherein, because the word Redemption is diuersly taken in the Scriptures, as for deliuerance sometimes from sinne, sometimes from death, sometimes from the power and feare of either; and all the promises of God we haue now in hope, though not some of them indeed till the generall resurrection: you shew your selfe cunning in carping at words, which you labour to turne and wind euery way. But before you come to it, you make a short and swift answere to all the places of Scripture, which I produce touching the force and effects of Christs blood; least you should haue Defenc. pa. 45. li. 12. 
               any neede to trouble your selfe hereafter about any of them. Where, as your manner is throughout your booke, you first chaunge the question with adding your witlesse and senslesse termes of meere, single, and simple to my words, and then without any more adoe, Ibidem li. 7. 
               Your aduised and resolute answere to all is this; 
               & 11. 
               there is not one text any where that hath any meaning of my strange conceite. It were reason, a man would thinke, you tooke the paines to impugne my words, and not to presume you know my meaning against my words, and so to frame it after your fashion with your new found phrases, which I abhor as much as I doe your new found faith.
            
               Defenc. pa. 44. li. 32. 
               You will prooue the blood of our Sauiour is the true price of our Redemption, and that as well of our soules as of our bodies. Who denieth this as your words runne?] It is happie yet that my words runne well, whatsoeuer my conceite be. Now if I meane no more then I speake, and the sacred Scriptures fully concurre with that which I speake; then haue I both the word of God to warrant that I teach, and besides your owne confession

that as I speake it, it is truth. Defenc. pa. 44. li. 35. 
               But you know I meane, that no more but the shedding of Christs blood ONLY AND MEERELY, is the iust and full satisfaction of all our sinnes.] What my meaning is you cannot be ignorant, I haue often declared it, not here only, but in my Sermons and conclusion also, as I haue formerly shewed, and you haue plainely confessed. I will once more repeate your owne words and hereafter by your leaue tell you it is a plaine lye and a meere shift, if you father your termes of Christs meere blood, and single bodie vpon me, as any part of the Question which I mooued, or Doctrine which I defend. Wherefore I pray thee Christian Reader once more to take notice, that I be not driuen in euery page to proue one and the same thing against the Discoursers vnsauery, childish, and Idle phrases, with which he would faine elude the Scriptures, and delude the world. Your confession both of my Sermons and conclusion (Sir Descourser) is this; Defenc. pa. 36. li. 9. 
               Sundry times you teach, that Christ did suffer peculiarly and seuerally some proper punishments in his soule, besides his bodily sufferings: yea that this was a part of his crosse, and the effect of Gods wrath on his soule, as well as the suffering in his body. Against my words so often witnessed in my writings, and so openly confessed by your selfe, you take vpon you (by some secret reuelation belike) to know my meaning, that 
               Defenc. pa. 45. li. 3. 
               no more but the shedding of Christs blood MEERELY is the full satisfaction of all our sinnes; which MEERE BLOOD of Christ the Scriptures meane not, nor onely his body SINGLY and SIMPLY considered.] The MEERE blood, and SINGLE and SIMPLE body of Christ, with such like couerts of your cause, are termes fit for such a teacher as you are, to which if you could once conuert the Question, we must haue as many Lexicons to bring vs out of these Laberinthes, as there be leaues in your booke. Keepe them therefore as whelps of your owne litture, the faith of Christ and the word of God hath stood without them these sixteene hundered yeeres.
            What I meane by the body and blood of Christ, giuen, and shed for our Redemption, and the remission of our sinne; I haue meetly well expressed; I must not in euery section fall to fresh repetitions. When I speake as the Scripture speaketh, I meane as the Scripture meaneth. They know not your new termes of the MEERE blood, nor of the single and simple body of Christ; but by his blood and death they meane that manner of shedding his blood, and that kind and course of death suffered in the body of his flesh, which the Gospell describeth; no way excluding from Christ, when he presented himselfe before God to vndertake mans cause the due consideration of mans infirmitie and iniquitie abounding, or of Gods iustice therewith displeased; nor his humble and voluntary submission to the mightie hand and righteous will of his heauenly Father, to excuse vs from the heauie iudgement that otherwise did hang ouer our heads. So much as the Scriptures mention in declaring the manner of his death and bloodshedding, so much they containe in the name of his Crosse, blood and death. For as the description, which the holy Ghost maketh, is in no point idle; so the comprehension of all vnder one word excludeth nothing formerly described. This I take to be a sound and sure way to expound the Scriptures by their owne direction and intention. For since the manner and order of Christs death was so carefully regestred by the spirite of God, that we should not be ignorant of it; whensoeuer the Scriptures speake of Christs Crosse, blood, and death, they referre vs to all that, which either by the Prophets was foretold, or in the Gospell is expressed touching the order and manner of his death. And so Christ 
                1. Cor. 15. vers. 3.
               died for our sinnes according to the Scriptures (as Paul addeth.) Then to take any thing from it, which is mentioned in the Scriptures; or to adde any thing to it, which is not there expresly recorded; is to depart from the word of trueth, and to dishonor and deface the death and bloud of Christ with our inuentions.
            This being my meaning euen from the beginning, as my words declare, I moued these two generall questions: The first, Whether in the crosse and death of Christ described in the Scriptures, the death of the soule, or the death of the damned, were by any good warrant of the sayd Scriptures comprised: Secondly, Whether the

               crosse and death of Christ, as the Scriptures describe them, be not the full and perfect price of our redemption from sinne, and reconciliation to God by the testimonie of the same Scriptures, without the death of the soule, or paines of the damned. The Discourser finding himselfe inclosed with these questions, speaketh directlie to neither, and prooueth nothing in either; but declining the enuie of these speeches, the death of the soule, and the paines of the damned, which indeed are the points misliked and reiected, he changeth the first question into the generall termes of suffering Gods wrath, and the soules proper suffering, which may import manie things besides those two; and in the second, he euery where beareth the Reader in hand, that by the death and bloud of Christ, I meane the MEERE bodily sufferings of Christ, without anie sense or sorrow of the soule in her spirituall powers. And lest the Scripture should stand in his way, he casteth them all behinde him, that any way witnesse the force and merit of Christes death and bloudshedding, as figuratiue speeches; because they name not the MEERE bloud of Christ, nor only his body SINGLY considered. But Sir, all this while you forget, that you haue proued nothing, but onely supposed and auouched what pleased you; and that in matters of faith you may not adde to the word of God without manifest apostasie. The things questioned by me, were the Sermo. pa. 8. li 23. & pa. 9. li. 14. 
               death of the soule, and the verie paines of the damned, as appeareth euidently by my words, when I first mooued the question. Of these you say nothing all this while; which yet you must soundly & fully proue before you may adde them to the words of the Holy ghost testifying the power & vertue of Christes bloud and death. Therefore howsoeuer you seeme to shift off the Scriptures as figuratiue speeches with your MEERE and SINGLE termes, they will sticke faster by you than so. For as thereThe Scriptures teach no redēption, but by the bloud and death of Christ. can be no doubt of my meaning, comprising all in the death and bloud of Christ, which the Scriptures report of the order and maner of his sufferings, when he yeelded himselfe to die for the sinnes of the world according to the counsell of his Fathers wil; so you may not presume any thing to be conteined in the death or crosse of Christ, as requisite for our redemption, which is not cleerely witnessed by the Scriptures. Proue therefore by the Scriptures, that Christ died the death of the soule, or the death of the damned, which are the true paines of hell; and then adde it to the crosse of Christ when you will. Till so you do, the Scriptures which I haue produced, stand in their full strength against you. For as they bind all Christian men stedfastly to beleeue that which is written touching their redemption by the death and bloud of Christ; so do they straitly prohibit all and euery, be they men or Angels, to adde any other deuice to the doctrine of our saluation, than what is euidently reuealed, and directly witnessed in the Scriptures.

               Whether it be of Christ (sayth Austen) or of any other thing what soeuer touching the faith; I say not, if we, who are no way comparable to him that so spake, but that which followeth, if an Angell from heauen teach you BESIDES that which you haue receiued in the Scriptures, of the Law and the Gospell, holde him accursed. 
               Basil. in serm. de fide. 
               It is a manifest fall from the faith (sayth Basil) either to abrogate any thing that is written, or to bring in any thing that is not written. For

               when once we beleeue (the Gospel, sayth Tertullian) this we first beleeue, that there is nothing besides, which we ought to beleeue. So that the meere bloud and single bodie of Christ are but sleights of yours, with vnknowen phrases to draw your Reader from asking or eying your proofes for the death of Christes soule, and the paines of the damned to be suffered by him, before wee could be redeemed. The Scriptures are maine and manifest for that which I beleeue and teach, and which the whole Church of Christ before mee, taught and beleeued these fifteene hundred yeeres, afore your conceit of hell paines in the soule of Christ was either hatcht or heard of. The sufferings of the soule and the wrath of God, which things you now catch holde on to make some introduction to your secret and priuate fansies, are too generall to inferre either the death of the soule or the paines of the damned, except to the rest of your absurdities you will adde these, that the soule neuer suffereth but

it dieth the death of spirits; and that Gods anger in this life hath none other effects, but damnation.
            
               Defenc. pa. 45. li. 13. 
               Here you vrge a reason against vs: if then our soules be not redeemed by the blood of Christ, our bodies haue no benefite of Redemption from death.] You hunt so headily after aduantages of words by some ambiguitie in them, that you neither remember what the Scriptures teach, nor what your selfe defend, nor when I vse a word in the same sense that the Apostle doth. It is not my deuise, but the Apostles doing, to take REDEMPTION of the body for the incorruption of the same. Rom. 8. 23. 
               We sigh in our selues, saith Paul, wayting for the Redemption of our body. And againe, you are 
               Ephes. 4. 30. 
               sealed by the holy spirit of God vnto the day of Redemption. When that day shall be, our Sauiour telleth vs in these words. When the 
               Luk. 21. 28. 
               powers of heauen shall be shaken, and you see the sonne of man come in a cloud with power and great glory, then lift vp your heads; for your Redemption draweth neere; In all which places Redemption is taken for none of those mercies or graces, which are bestowed on Gods children in this life, but for that glorie and immortalitie, which shall be reueiled on them, when Christ shall come to iudge the world; and namely the Redemption of the body for that incorruption, wherewith Philip 3. 21. 
               our vile bodies shall bee changed and made like to his glorious body. Take then the Redemption of the body for the incorruption of the same, as the Apostle plainely doth and I did; and see what absurditie or obscuritie there is in my reason, which you so much wrangle with, and wonder at, as though it passed all vnderstanding. The Redemption, which we haue in this life by the bloud of Christ, must needes bee either of body or of soule; we haue no more parts to be redeemed by Christ. But the Redemption of our bodies we haue not in this world, we must waite for it, till 1. Cor. 15. 53, 54. 
               this corruptible put on incorruption. The Redemption therefore which we haue in this life, or shal haue before the last day, is the Redemption of our soules. And so the words of Peter, 1. Pet. 1. 19. 
               You were Redeemed with the precious bloud of Christ, and of the Saints in heauen, saying to the Lambe, Reue. 5. 9. 
               Thou hast redeemed vs to God by thy bloud, pertaine expresly to the Redemption of their soules, because their bodies then did, and yet do lie in corruption. What so strange monsters or marueiles, doeth your Logicall head finde in this reason, that you should make such wonderizations at it, and protestations against it? Is it not open and easie to all, that be meanely witted or soberly minded?
            But you haue 
               Defenc. pag. 45. li. 17. 
               three things to note (in my words which you alleage:) 1. The Proposition is vaine and Illogicall, hauing no consequence in it at all.] It is a speciall point of Art memoratiue in you to note three things, and vtterly to forget two of them. For in this whole Section, you doe not so much as mention any second or third thing to bee noted in those words which you cite. The first and al, which you note, is that my proposition is vaine, Illogicall, and vncoherent.] Your idle and vntheologicall head hath ouer busied it selfe with many mad multiplications, and what ifs vpon this proposition; and yet you come nothing neere the sense or coherence of it. The Proposition hath two parts, whereof the second is either an illation out of the Apostles words, vpon the first being a supposition of yours, if we limit it to the time of this life; or if wee speake without restraint of time as you doe, it is a necessarie consequent to the former, being the condition and cause of the latter. That our soules are not redeemed by the bloud of Christ, but by his soule, is a resolution of yours; wherewith you giue a fresh on-set in the next Section, as the Reader shall there perceiue, though here in shew you somwhat relent after your inconstant maner. That being a position of yours; I added by the Apostles warrant, that our bodies haue not their Redemption in this life, but must stay for it till the day of Redemption, or generall resurrection. And so the reason standeth: Conclu. pa. 240 l. 24. 
               If our soules be not (here) redeemed by the bloud of Christ, (which is your Assertion) our bodies (by the Apostles doctrine) haue no Redemption in this life. But this, That wee should 
               Ibidem 241. li. 6. et m 8. 
               presently haue no Redemption (in body or soule) by the bloud of Christ is quite 
               m 
               contrarie to the words of Peter, who sayth, Yee are redeemed by the bloud of Christ, (not yee shall be;) and of the soules in heauen that say to Christ, thou hast

redeemed vs by thy bloud, when their bodies were rotten in the earth. Since therefore either body or soule must haue Redemption in this life, and the body as Paul assureth vs, hath not Redemption in this life; Vt supra. pa. 240. li. 31. 
               Ergo the Redemption which we haue in this life by the bloud of Christ, must bee referred to our soules; and our bodies must expect the generall day of Redemption in the end of the world, before they shall haue it. If the sober and wise Reader vnderstand not this reason, or can dislike the sequence of it, I am content he shall condemne it as darke and obscure; but if it be open to all mens eyes saue yours; then is your dull conceite or eger stomacke rather betrayed by your foolish rolling to so many what ifs, then my reason any way refuted. [I alter, you will say, the order of it.] Though I spake then more shortly then now I doe, because I had no leasure to stand so long thereon, yet he that will Reade but the third part of that Section whence you take this, shall finde the very same parts and words, that now I vse, there contained and expressed.
            But I afterward defend the proposition with the condition annexed to bee simplie true.] When I saw your humour was so franticke, that not vnderstanding my words, you would presently pronounce them in the view of the whole Realme to be a notorious Paradoxe and impietie, I bid you take your vttermost aduantage of my words; and as they stoode, though that were not my first intent, they were sound and good, and your impugning them was prophane and false. I yet auouch the same. For where the Scriptures teach no Redemption but by the death and bloud of Christ, your other deu
                  •…
               sed Redemptions by the death of the soule, and paines of Hell, I account no better then false and prophane. And therefore if our soules be not that way redeemed, which the Scriptures reueile, which is by the death and bloud of Christ; they are not redeemed at all. And being not at all redeemed, I would faine know by the best of your skill, what benefit of Redemption our bodies shall or can haue, more then the bodies of Infidels. Yea set that redemption aside, which the Scriptures attribute to the death and bloud of Christ, and neither bodie nor soule can be saued, but infidelity and the wages therof, I meane damnation both of soule and bodie, preuaile in all men. So that you were not well in your wits, when with such an heat and huffe you cried out Trea. pa. 23. li. 13. 
               What a Pradoxe is it, yea what impietie? But I must chuse whether I will speake this sophistically or absurdly, you say.] Is it any sophistrie or absurditie to speake as the Spirit of God speaketh in the Scriptures? Your MEERE bloud of Christ is indeed absurd Sophistrie: for you imagine by that word, that Christ shed his bloud for our sinnes without any meritorious action or passion of the soule concurring, which in the Redeemer of the world was so impossible, as nothing more. If I speake otherwise than the Scriptures speake, take your pleasure at it, so you bring reason for it; but whe I keepe my selfe within the compasse of their speech, your a
                  •…
               ouching that I speake Sophisticallie or absurdlie, reprocheth the Scriptures, whom I follow. In either of those points which you impugne, as that our soules are redeemed by the bloud of Christ, and that our bodies haue not redemption in this life, I haue the Scriptures plainly precedent before me, and therefore except they speake sophistically or absurdly, I in retaining their speech and sense can do neither.
            The difference betwixt the deaths of the faithfull and infidels, is a thing wellThe

               Si Redemptio corporis nostri

secundum Apostolum expectatur, profecto quod expectatur adhuc speratur, nondum tenetur. If the Redemption of our body by the Apostles doctrine must be wayted for, that which is expected is still hoped for, but not yet obtained. Take then the Redemption of the body for the incorruption of the same, as Paul doth, whom in that point I followed, and tell me what benefite of incorruption (which is the word you so much storme at) the bodies of the faithfull haue more then the bodies of infidels. You range aside as your manner is, to the ceasing of sinne in the godly, and their resting from labours, as also the entrance of their soules into heauen; as if the bodies of the wicked did sinne in their graues, or were tossed with troubles when they were dead and rotten, or in the Saints your sight did not serue you to distinguish their soules from their bodies. For when I say as Paul sayth, their bodies haue not yet redemption; you replie, their soules after death haue an entrance into heauen. Euen so, when I say, that the death of the bodie to the saints is a part of that wrath, curse, and punishment which God inflicted on all mankinde for their sinne in Adam, as shall after (God willing) more largely appeare; you oppose the benefits which God of his peculiar goodnesse towards his children, hath reserued for them, after they haue obediently and patiently submitted themselues to his diuine pleasure, in bringing their bodies to corruption for the sinne that dwelleth in them. And thus by your mangling of matters you confound in the godlie their soules with their bodies, and in God himselfe his iustice against sinne with his mercy towards his owne. You might haue learned of S. Austen rightly to seuer them as he doth, though you crosse him in this, as in most of the things that are in question betwixt vs. Aug. contra dua

               Before you depart from this point, that not the bloud of Christ nor his flesh without respect to the merit of his whole soule, was the full price of redemption, you will shew how sundrie of
               Both body and soule must suffer in Christ. 
               the ancient Fathers doe agree with you sufficiently in this matter, though afterwards in my booke I seeme to bring them against you.] If you had Fathers to witnesse your fansies of Christes suffering the death of the soule and paines of hell, you would soone recken them and more regard them, than now you doe, when they directly gainsay your late deuice of a new kinde of redemption, which the Scriptures neuer specifie. These Fathers I brought not against you, as you imagine, not perceiuing what maketh with you nor what against you. In shew these places seemed to make against me, and to disclaime that assertion which I concluded out of the Scriptures, that the bloud of Christ redeemed and sanctified both our bodies and soules. Lest therefore the simple should stumble at any such sayings of the Fathers, not knowing their meanings, I brought them to expound them, and to let the Reader see that indeed I dissented not from them: but confessed, as they intended, that in Christes suffering for sinne the whole man, that is, bodie and soule, must be ioyned together. And if any part of Christs humane nature were wholy freed and exempted from suffering, that part in vs was not fully ransomed. By which they neuer ment that Christs soule must haue seuerall sufferings for our soules, and his body likewise for our bodies; but as Adam sinned in both ioyntly, so the punishment of sinne, which Christ vndertooke for vs, must be felt ioyntly in both, and if either part in Christes sufferings were vntouched, some part in vs was vnrestored. This to be the true meaning of those Fathers, and all that their words must inferre, if they will speake trueth, and agree with themselues, as no doubt they doe, your selfe is a witnesse sufficient against your selfe. In defence of your doctrine you say: Treat. pag. 22. li. 21. 
               It is most false, that we precisely say, that Christs body satisfied for

our bodies, and his soule for our soules, yea ech of them in a seuerall and distinct kinde of satisfying: which thing we neuer meant, but acknowledge the sufferings of the whole man Christ do satisfie for vs wholly, without any such precise partition.] What you dare not affirme, because it is false and repugnant to the Scriptures, I hope you will not impose on the Fathers, so long as their words conclude no such thing. They say precisely Christ

So farre we agree; you acknowledgingCyril. de fide ad Theodosium. mine exposition of the Fathers to be such as you doe not, nor dare not impugne: for otherwise you must make them contradict both the Scriptures, and themselues which they neuer ment, if they should say that our soules are not clensed, redeemed, and sanctified by the bloud of Christ: What now inferre you farder out of their wordes?

               Marke well how these Fathers do not say that Christ gaue his life for a ransome only (as you would construe it) but euen his verie soule for our soules.] You are a worthie Clerke if you vnderstand not, that nothing but the very soule of man is the life of his bodie, and therefore Christ in giuing his life for vs, must needs giue his verie soule for vs. The one of them doth not exclude the other, as you vainly collect, but implieth the other, as by the vsuall speeches of the Scriptures, and generall consent of all Interpreters olde and new may soone appeare. Matt. 2. v 20 
               They are dead (sayth the Angell to Ioseph) that sought the childes soule; meaning Herod that went about to destroy Christ in his cradle. Matt. 6. v. 25 
               Be not pensiue for your soule (sayth our Sauiour) what ye shall eat or what ye shall drinke. Is not your soule of more value then meate? Meate and drinke maintaine life, and so continue the soule in the body, otherwise they are no way needfull for the soule. Matth. 10. vers. 39. 
               He that loseth his soule for my sake, (saith Christ) shall saue it. How can a man lose his soule for Christ, but by laying downe his life for Christ? There shall be no losse
               Acts 27. vers. 22.

               came all safe to land. So of Epaphroditus Paul saith; for the worke of Christ he was neere vnto death, not regarding his Soule. Nothing is more often in the Scriptures then for life to vse the name of Soule, which is the cause of life; and by the soule to expresse life, which is a necessary consequent of the Soule remaining in the body, as death is of the Soule departing from the body. This kind of speech so familiar with the Hebrewes, and so frequent in the olde and new Testament, our Sauiour keepeth, when he speaketh of his owne death.

               Idem in Iohannem li. 10. ca. 22. 
               I will cite our Sauiour himselfe for a witnesse (where he saith;) greater loue hath no man, then to lay downe his soule for his friends. By all this Christ teacheth his Disciples to be so farre from shunning daungers and troubles for the saluation of men, that the death of the flesh must not be refused; for euen to that doth charitie stretch. Fulgentius an other of the Fathers, on whom you would faine fasten your error of Christs redeeming our soules by the death of his soule, and our bodies by the death of his body; not only noteth when and how Christ laid downe his soule for vs, but why that phrase is applyed to Christs death, and to all theirs, that die willingly for loue, not necessarily vpon constraint. Fulgent. ad Thrasimundum li. 3. 
               The whole man (Christ) laid downe his soule, when his soule departed, his flesh dying on the crosse. And so againe, Ibidem. 
               Christ dying in the flesh, laid downe his Soule; and shewing the difference betwixt deliuering the body to death and giuing or laying downe the soule, He saith Ibidem. 
               Where loue is not, the body is said to be deliuered, but not the soule to be laid downe; as the vessell of election plainly testifieth, If I giue my body to be burnt, and haue no loue, it auayleth me nothing. (Here Paule) declareth, that without loue the body may be yeelded, but not the soule laid downe. For where he purposeth to signifie the purenesse of his loue, he thus writeth to the Thessalonians. Our goodwill was to bestow on you not onely the Gospell of God, but euen our owne soules; and to proue this an effect of his loue he addeth, because yee were deare vnto vs. So that it is proued by manifest witnesse of Scripture, that there wanteth loue, where the body onely is layed downe to death, but there is charitie, where the soule is laid downe together with the body. Beda. 
               Beda in Euangelium Iohan. cap. 10. 
               Ponere ergo animam, mori est. Sic & Apostolus Petrus Domino dixit, animam pro te ponam, id est, pro te moriar carne. To lay downe the Soule is to die. So the Apostle Peter said to Christ, I will lay downe my Soule for thee, that is, I will die in the flesh for thee. 
               Ibidem. 
               A good sheepeheard (saith Christ) layeth downe his soule for his sheepe. He did, that he taught; he performed, that he commaunded, he laid downe his Soule for his sheepe; and shewed vs a way to contemne death, which we must follow, and a paterne after which we must be Printed, which is first to extend our outward works of mercie towards his sheepe; then if neede be to offer our death for them.
            
            The later writers are all of the same mind, and expound those words of our Sauiour, the Sonne of man came to serue, and to giue his soule a ransome for many; and I lay downe my soule for my sheepe; to haue none other sense, then that he would die for vs, as the Fathers before them did expound the same. Erasmus in his paraphrase expressing our Sauiours meaning in both places saith in the person of Christ; Eras. paraphra. in Matth. cap. 20. 
               Therefore I came euen to serue the welfare of all, in so much that I thinke it no burden to giue my life; by the losse of one soule to redeeme many. And againe; Idem in Ioh. hannis. cap. 10. 
               Therefore my Father loueth me singularly as his Sonne, because of mine owne accord I bestowed my life for the safetie of my Fathers flocke. Bullinger likewise in the person of our Sauiour; Bullingerus in Mat. ca. 20. 
               I came to serue the good of all, and that which is farre greater, I came into this world to giue my life for sinners. And so, Idem in Ioh. cap. 10. 
               I yeeld my selfe to death, and euen to the death of the crosse, that my sheepe beleeuing in me, may liue by my death. And alleadging and relying on Saint Austens words on the same place, he addeth out of Austen. To lay downe the soule is to die. So Peter the Apostle said to his Master; I will lay downe my soule for thee, that is I will die for thee. Attribute this to the flesh, for when the soule goeth out of the flesh, and the flesh remaineth without a soule, then is a man said to lay downe his soule. What saith the Euangelist? Christ bowing his head gaue vp the Ghost; this is, to lay downe the soule. Musculus; Christ declareth what his 
               Muscul. in Matth. ca. 20. 
               ministerie is; euen to redeeme mortall men, and the chiefest degree of this ministerie is; that he would giue his soule (for them.) Then are we redeemed by the onely begotten Sonne of God, and that dearely, euen with his owne death. For the Lord of heauen and earth humbled himselfe vnto death, and that vnto a most shamefull death. What was more vile or more abiect in the world, then the death of the crosse? And in the person of Christ; Idem in Ioh. cap. 10. 
               Therefore my Father loueth me because I lay downe my soule; that is, because I die for

(my) sheepe. Caluine vpon those words of Christ, I came to giue my soule a Redemption for many: 
               Caluin. in Matth. ca. 20. 
               Therefore Christ mentioneth his death, that he might withdraw his Disciples from a peruerse imagination of an earthly kingdome. In the meane time the force and fruite of his death is aptly and rightly expressed, whiles he affirmeth his life to be the price of our Redemption. Whence it followeth that the price of our reconciliation with God, is no where found but in the death of Christ; and so; It is no maruaile that Christ 
               Idem in Ioh. cap. 10. 
               affirmeth himselfe to be therefore loued (of his Father,) because he esteemeth our saluation dearer then his owne life. 
               Ibid. 
               He would by this arme his Disciples, least seeing him soone after to be caried to death, they should faint in hart, as if he were oppressed by his enimies, but rather acknowledge it to be the wonderfull prouidence of God, that he should die to redeeme the flocke. Gualter; Gualtherus in Matth. cap. 20. 
               Christ (saith he) came to giue his soule to be the price of Redemption for many. This passeth all offices, that men may yeeld one to another. For as him selfe saith, no man hath greater loue then this, to giue his soule for his friends. But he vouchsafeth to die for his enimies. And dying for vs he bestowed life on vs, because his death was a ransome sufficient for the sinnes of the world. And so; A good sheepeheard (saith Christ) layeth downe his soule for his sheepe.b 
               As if he should haue said, who can deny him to be a good sheepeheard that so
               Idem in Ioh. cap. 10. homilia. 97.

               Christ saith the sonne of man came to minister, and to giue his life for the Redemption of all. That surely is the chiefest and truest loue and seruice, when a man serueth his enimies with body and life. And likewise in the person of Christ. Idem in Ioh. cap. 10. 
               I alone am the good sheepeheard and lay downe my soule for my sheepe; that is, by my death men are deliuered from eternall death.
            
            I aske now the Christian Reader whether he thinke it a shift of mine, when ChristChrists Soule suffered, but died not for vs. 
               gaue his soule for vs, or our soules, for me to say, that he gaue it by the losse of his life, in such sort as the Euangelists describe; or whether the Scriptures and Fathers together with the later writers doe not consent with me in the same exposition of Christs words. This conclusion then that Christ gaue his soule for our soules, doth not inferre that he had distinct times, places, or manners, of suffering or dying for our soules and then for our bodies; (that is erroneous & iniurious to the death of Christ and openly disclaimed euen by the Discourser himselfe) but that in suffering death on the crosse, by which his soule was separated from his body after long and sharpe torments first endured in his body; his soule was the chiefe or rather the onely patient, that discerned and sustained the bitternesse of the paines, and perceiued the cause for which, and the counsell of God from whence, all that affliction was ordained and decreed. For as we sinned in body and soule, but chiefly in soule, so Christs death for our Redemption must grieue both body and soule, but chiefly the soule, which was ioyned with the body in suffering death; that both soule and body might be redeemed: and the paine thereof proportioned to the soule, as the pleasure of sinne chiefly delighted the soule. More then this, no Father euer ment, and this is no way denied by me. You would faine wring in a conceite of your owne into their words, which is mainly & directly against their words and resolutions in all other places, and therefore which of vs two deserueth best the name of a shifter, let the Reader iudge.
            The Fathers Defenc. pa. 47. li. 30. 
               striue to expresse an exact proportion, so farre as was possible betweene Christ and vs; first in the parts that suffered in Christ, and are saued in vs: 
               Ibid pa. 48. li. 3. 
               Next in that which Christ suffered for vs, and which we are saued from thereby.] They iustly conclude, that no parts of our nature are saued in vs, but such as Christ assumed into the vnitie of his person; and therefore in Christs sufferings there must be body and soule, before they could be humane sufferings or auailable for vs. As
               1. Cor. 15. 
               by man came death, so by man came the resurrection of the dead. But that they doe or would affirme, that we are saued from no more then Christ suffered for vs, or that we are wholy freed from all those kinds of paines, which he suffered for our sakes, this is a false and fantasticall proportion of your owne inuenting, it is no part of their meaning. Sundry things should we haue suffered for sinne, as the death of the soule, and the death of the damned, besides

reiection from all grace and blisse, confusion, malediction, and many other terrors and torments of conscience, which by no meanes these Fathers apply to Christ; but in euident and vehement words auouch the contrarie. Christ likewise suffered wrong, reproch, shame, paine, and death of the body, from which we are not freed; yea rather we must haue fellowship with his afflictions, and be Philip. 3. 10. 
               conformed vnto his death, before we shall be partakers of the comforts that are in him, or of his resurrection. So that your running to proportions of your owne compounding, when you should bring sound probations for that you defend, is mad Musicke, though best becomming the discords of your doctrine.
            
               Defenc. pag. 47. l. 32. 
               As we are saued not in our bodies onely, nor onely in the externall sensitiue part of our soules (wherein standeth that suffering with and by our bodies) but we are saued, redeemed, and sanctified in our whole spirit and vnderstanding also; euen so (by their verdict) Christ suffered for vs not the bodily and outward sufferings by Sympathie onely, but he suffered for vs euen in his minde also. Now this is directly against your present assertion.] A man can not readily tell, whether your assertion in this place be more false, absurd, or idle. The Scripture teacheth vs, that a man hath but two substances, of which he consisteth, a mortall and visible, which is his bodie; an immortall and inuisible, which is his soule. Our Sauiour, who best knew what man had, saith as much: Matt. 10. 
               Feare not them, which kill the bodie, but can not kill the soule; feare him rather, that can destroy soule and bodie in hell. The names of these parts are sometimes varied, and sometimes diuided into sundrie powers and faculties, but the partes themselues cannot be increased. Salomon speaking of mans death, sayth: Eccles. 12. 
               Dust goeth to the earth as it was, (meaning the bodie) and the Spirit returneth to God that gaue it, (meaning the Soule.) Of a Virgin Paul sayth, 1. Corin. 7. 
               she careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in bodie and spirit; that is, in bodie and soule. And writing to the Thessalonians the same Apostle saith that their 1. Thess. 5. vers. 23. 
               whole Spirit, and Soule, and Bodie may be kept blamelesse vnto the comming of the Lord Iesus Christ. Of this place diuerse haue diuersly thought. In 1. Thess. 5. vers. 23. 
               Chrysostome, Theodoret, Ambrose, Ierome, Oecumenius, and Theophylact, commenting on these words, take the spirit for the grace of Gods spirit, wherewith our mindes are lightned and renewed; and indeede sometimes Paul vseth the word spirit, for the gifts of the spirit, as where he saith, 1. Thess. 5. 
               Quench not the spirit; and calleth them our spirits, as the 1. Cor. 14.

                  . cap. 22. Augustine, In 1. Thess. c 5 v 23. Bede, and others, take here the spirit for the vnderstanding and minde of man; as also In 1. Thess. c 5 v 23. Caluine, In 1. Thess. c 5 v 23. Zanchius and In 1. Thess. c 5 v 23. Beza doe; who referre the soule here spoken of, to the will and affections of man; not that any of them maketh two soules in man, which were most absurd, but that by those names they note two different faculties or functions in one and the same substance of mans soule.
            Come now to your words and see how handsomely you proportion them, either to your Authors, or to the trueth, or to your purpose. Not one of the Fathers which you cite, nameth the minde of Christ, but onely his soule and his bodie, saue Nazianzene; who speaketh not of Christs suffering in the minde, but of his sanctifying the same, by assuming it in his incarnation. Let himselfe explane his owne wordes in the very same place. Nazianzepistoia. 1. ad Ciedonium. 
               Our mind (some say) is condemned. And what our flesh? is not that also condemned? then either cast away mans flesh (from Christ) for sinne, or admit mans mind, that it may be saued. For if Christ take the worse part (of man) to sanctific it by his incarnation, shall he not take the better part, that it may be sanctified, 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , by his assuming of mans nature? I speake not this, as if it might not safely be granted, that Christs soule suffered as well by his minde, as by his sense, and you nothing the neerer to your purpose of his suffering hell paines in mind from the immediate hand of God; but to let the Reader see how you catch at Fathers for an aduantage without any shew of their words, and when they make against you, you reiect with disdaine the whole aray of them.
            Your diuiding of man into his parts, and your resolutions thereupon, are more absurd,

and haue neither trueth, learning, nor common vnderstanding in them. Of man (to shew your exactnesse) you make these partes, 
                  
                     •…
                  e bodie, the externall sensitiue part of the soule, the whole spirit, and vnderstanding also. You name here the bodie, the soule, and the spirit, but so vntowardly, that neither your selfe, nor any man els can tell how to make them agree. Hath the soule, if you will needes distinguish it from the spirit, no moe parts or powers to suffer or to be saued, but the externall sensitiue part? will you take the soule to be all one with the spirit, and so make the whole spirit, as much as the whole soule? But the Apostle reckoneth the 1. Thess. 5. 
               whole spirit, the soule and the bodie, (whose words you would seeme to follow) and so seuereth the soule from the spirit. But not by the externall sensitiue part as you doe. Againe, why adde you the vnderstanding also after the whole spirit? As if it were no part thereof, but a different thing from the spirit? But this is your skill, when you come to any matter of importance, to wrap it in ambiguous and confused termes, that it shall be more masterie to vnderstand you, then to refute you. And how commeth it about by your Philosophie, that the sufferings of the soule by and from the body pierce no farder, then into the externall senses of the soule? Doe the sufferings of the body offend and afflict the powers onely, or the substance also of the soule? Is not the very substance of the Soule passible and punishable as well by the powers of sense, as by the affections, and vnderstanding? The actions, passions, powers, and faculties of the soule, are they not all grounded on and seated in the substance of the soule, so that from thence all the actions thereof must proceed, therein all the passions thereof must be receiued, and thereon all the faculties thereof depend? Are you so learned in logick, that you will bring vs passions without a subiect, or powers and faculties without a substance? Whether it be therefore by the vnderstanding, will, affections, or sense, that the soule suffereth; the substance thereof suffereth by those powers and meanes, and not any part thereof; for so much as the substance of the soule is not diuisible into parts as being a spirit, though the powers and faculties thereof may be distinguished, and called parts. Then is it a strange position of yours that the sensitiue part suffereth, or that the vnderstanding suffereth, and not the soule by either of them, when indeed the substance of the soule suffereth by or from her power or faculties of sense, vnderstanding, and will, which are the meanes that God hath made to impresse paine on the soule. For the vnderstanding, which you call the mind, is no more a seuerall substance in the soule, then the power of sense is: and the soule not onely discerneth particular things by her facultie of sense, as she doth consequent and generall things by hir facultie of reason, but by the eares and eyes she heareth the word, and beholdeth the works of God, whence commeth information of faith and truth.
            Of the vnderstanding Epiphanius saith. Epiphanius contra Here

               &c. I thinke not our mind to be any substance of it selfe, neither hath any of the children ofthe Church so thought; but to be an effectuall power or operation giuen of God, and abiding in vs. Of the sense Tertullian saith. Tertullian de anima. cap. 8. 
               Anima perinde per corpus corporalia sentit, quemadmodum per animam incorporalia intelligit. The soule perceiueth corporall things by the sense, euen as she doth vnderstand incorporall things by the mind. And shewing how both those powers depend on the soule, he addeth. Sit nunc & potior sensu intellectus, dummodo & ipse propria vis animae quod & sensus. Let the vnderstanding excell the sense, so that it be a proper facultie of the Soule, as the sense is. Of the passions of Christs Soule Fulgentius writeth; Fulgentius ad Trasimundum cap. 3. 
               Nunc ostendendum nobis est passionem tristitiae, maeroris, taedij & timoris, ad animae substantiam propriè pertinere. Now must we shew that the passion of sorrow, heauinesse, and loathing of hart, and feare (which our Sauiour felt) pertaine properly to the substance of the soule. And at the length concluding that Ibidem. 
               the flesh of it selfe can neither haue life, nor sense, nor sorrow, nor desire, nor feare, nor mourning, he saith; 
               Ibidem. 
               Haec ergo cuncta in anima, quam susceperat, pertulit Christus, vt veram totam
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   in se cum suis infirmitatibus hominis demonstraret accepti substantiam. All these (passions) Christ endured in his soule which he tooke, that he might shew in himselfe THE TRVE AND VVHOLE SVBSTANCE of a man with his infirmities.
            
            
            The purpose for which you pretend so many Fathers is as idle, as all the rest: forChrists Soule suffered by all her powers but not the death of the Soule. the Soule of Christ might suffer by her senses, by her affections, by her vnderstanding and will, and yet not suffer the paines of hell, nor the death of the soule, which is your doctrine. Though therefore the Fathers doe say that the soule of Christ suffered in his death and passion, which is a thing I neuer doubted of, much lesse called in question; yet neither auouch they, it suffered your hell paines, neither from the immediate hand of God, as your deuice leadeth; which things are as strange to them, as those they neuer heard of.
            
               Defenc. pa. 48. li. 23. 
               By the Fathers, Christ suffered exactly all and whatsoeuer sorrowes and paines, which we should haue suffered, as well spirituall as corporall, as well in all the powers of the soule subiect to suffering, as in that which suffered alwaies with and from the body. This if you would prooue by the Fathers themselues, and not by your false translating and misapplying their words, which otherwise haue no such thing, you said somewhat. You haue raked together some places alleaged Sermo. pa. 25. formerly by me, or formerly refuted by me, and out of them you would make fresh shewes, if you could tell how. There is onely one place of Cyrill, taken out of my Sermons by you, (as you doe the rest of your authorities) which hath generall termes apt to be wrested by you, and forced against the Authors minde, which you forget not to straine to the vttermost: the rest are miserably racked, without cause or colour, from the Fathers mindes and wordes. Cyrill saith, Cyrillus Thesaur. li. 10. cap. 3. 
               Omnia Christus perpessus est, vt nos ab omnibus liberaret. Christ suffered all things, that he might free vs from all; where the word ALL is found, which you make the ground of all your descant: but thereby it plainly appeareth you take not the paines to reade the Fathers words in the places where they are written, but rashly catch at them to serue your turne, without all respect to the antecedents or consequents, which would declare the writers meaning. In that Chapter whence these words are taken, Cyrill treateth not of the punishments which Christ suffered for our sinnes, but of the passions and infirmities of our nature; ALL VVHICH Christ receaued, and suffered to rise in himselfe, that they might be repressed by him, and our nature reformed. And therefore in those words, Christ suffered all to free vs from all; Cyrill euidently meaneth all the naturall infirmities and passions of our flesh. And those are his expresse words twice or thrice in that Chapter. Cyrill. Thesaur
                     •…
                  . li. 10. cap. 3. 
               When thou hearest, (saith he) that Christ wept, feared, and sorrowed, acknowledge him to be a true man, and ascribe these things to the nature of man. For Christ tooke a mortall bodie subiect to all the passions of our nature, sinne alwaies excepted. And againe. Cyrillus ibid. 
               How commeth it to passe, that these men know not, that all these things must be applied to mans nature (in Christ) which he truely tooke vnto him with all the passions thereof, but still without sinne. And the very recollection of the words which you stand on, conuinceth Cyrill spake of the naturall passions and infirmities of our flesh. For when he had exemplified his generall wordes, Christ suffered all to free vs from all, by death, feare, and sorrow, which are naturall to our corrupt condition; he concludeth, Ibidem. 
               & it a singulas passiones carnis fuisse in Christo absque peccato commotas inuenies, vt commotae vincerentur, & natura nostra reformaretur ad melius. AND LIKEVVISE ALL THE PASSIONS (or affections) of our flesh shalt thou finde mooued in Christ, but without sinne, that being mooued they might be repressed, and our nature reformed to the better. What is this to hell paines, which I trow are no naturall infirmities or affections in man, or to the proper sufferings of the soule, which you would hence establish; since heere is no mention but of the naturall infirmities and affections of the flesh, which Cyrill calleth the passions therof, as both Diuines and Philosophers doe?
            'Thus I take Bernards meaning to be (when he saith) Christ spared not himselfe, who
               Defenc. pa. 48. li. 12. 
               knoweth how to spare his.] Your taking may soone shew you to be a wilfull mistaker, but it concludeth nothing for your cause. Doth Bernard say that Christ suffered hell paines, and therein spared not himselfe? you would faine haue him say so, but he is as farre from it, as you are neere it. Bernard in that Chapter which you cite, but neuer saw; (for you went no farder for all your authorities, then my sermons,) speaketh of

the sixt and seuenth time Christ shedde his blood for vs; and when he commeth to the piercing of Christs hands and his feete with spikes of iron to fasten him to the crosse; wondering at Christes patience and loue towards vs, that endured such things for vs, he saith; God which either 
               Bernard. de passione Domini. cap. 41. 
               shortneth, lightneth, or taketh from his seruants the force of their torments, did in nothing ease vnto himselfe the wine-presse of his passion: he spared not himselfe, that knoweth how to spare his. Doth this conclude that Christ suffered the paines of hell? or that he shedde his blood vnto death for vs, not sparing himselfe, (from that, or, in that, which he suffered) though it were painfull and greeuous to him? But, I my selfe confesse that Christ 
               S
                     •…
                  rm. pa. 7. 
               suffered and endured all to the vttermost with exact obedience and patience.] Euen as Bernard fauoured your vntoward fansies, and said nothing for them, so doe I: but doe either Bernards words or mine import, that Christ suffered all, which else we should haue suffered, as you enterlace Cyrils words to make them sound somewhat to your purpose? are you so seely that you can not, or so slie that you will not see the plaine seames of humane speech? If a man should saie you affirme all things boldly, you prooue all things weakely, you translate al thinges corruptly: Doe his words imply, that you translate Euclide and Aristotle? that you prooue the roundnesse of the earth, and the bignesse of the Sunne? or that you affirme the sea burneth, and the Moone melteth? Is it not the vsuall course of al speech and speakers, when they expresse how things are done, to restraine the word all with a relation to the same person and action, whereof they spake? as you affirme all things (which you affirme) boldly, you prooue all, (that you prooue) weakely; and you translate all (whatsoeuer you translate) corruptly. Doth not the Scripture obserue the like? The people said of Christ, Mark. 7. 
               he hath done all things well. Will you inferre, that Christ made ships, built Towers, cast Lead, and did whatsoeuer, because he did all things well? or did they intend, that whatsoeuer he did, he did it well? Iohn. 1. 
               The true light saith Saint Iohn lightneth euerie man, that commeth into the world. Where if you take all men without exception, you plant a palpable error vpon Saint Iohns words; if you restraine them to all (that are lightned) his speech is a manifest trueth in Christ, and an excellent honour to Christ. So said I of Christ, that he suffered all, (that he suffered) with exact obedience and patience; not expressing there what he suffered, but how he suffered, to wit obediently and patiently. Which wordes of mine giue you no great cause of aduantage, if you looke well vnto them, and abuse them not after your idle maner. But such poore shifts you are forced to seeke to set some colour on your cause; which otherwise would bewray it selfe to want all good groundes and proofes.
            As you deale with me, so you doe with Tertullian, Ambrose, Ierom, Cyprian, and Cyrill, whose words partly you mistranslate, partly you misconster, and build vpon them what best pleaseth your selfe without any precedence or sequence of their text. Tertullian saith; Tertul. aduers. Praxeam cap. 30. 
               sic reliquit, dum non parcit. So God left his Sonne, whiles he spared him not. If this make for you, why quote you not the Apostle Paul as one of your partners, who spake the word before Tertullian, and whom Tertullian citeth by name for that word? God Rom. 8. 
               spared not his owne Sonne, saith Paul, but deliuered him for vs all. This place you baulked; because it expoundeth Gods not sparing his Sonne by deliuering him; (for God spared not his Sonne, but deliuered him; that is, God did not spare him from deliuering;) and also for that it excludeth your imagination of Gods immediate hand tormenting the soule of his Sonne, with the substance of hell paines. For if God deliuered his Sonne for vs all, he deliuered him to others, and not to himselfe; and consequently your dreame of Gods immediate hand inflicting hell paines on the soule of his Sonne, is against the Apostles words, God deliuered his Sonne. Which Christ himselfe expoundeth very often in the Gospel, saying; Matth. 17. 
               The Sonne of man shalbe deliuered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him. And againe, Matth. 26. vers. 2. 
               The Sonne of man shall be deliuered to be crucified; and immediately before his apprehension; Matth. 26. vers. 45. 
               Behold the houre is come, the Sonne of man is deliuered into the hands of sinners. This deliuering of Christ into the hands of men to be crucified, was the not sparing him,
               
which the Apostle meant; and was that for saking, which Christ testified on the Crosse, as Tertullian thinketh. Tertul. aduers. Praxeam. cap. 30. 
               Filium dereliquit, dum hominem eius tradit in mortem. Hoc & Apostolus sensit, scribens, si pater Filio non pepercit. Sic reliquit, dum non parcit; sic reliquit, dum tradit. Ceterum non reliquit pater filium, in cuius manibus Filius spiritum suum posuit. Deni
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   posuit, & statim obijt. Spiritu enim manente in carne, caro omnino mori non potest. Ita relinqui á patre, mori fuit filio. God left (or forsooke his Sonne (as Christ complained on the Crosse) whiles he deliuered his humane nature vnto death. This the Apostle meant when he wrote, if God spared not his Sonne. So God left him, whiles he spared him not; so God left him, whiles he deliuered him. Otherwise the Father forsooke not the Sonne, into whose hands the Sonne commended his spirit. He laide it downe and presently died. For while the spirit abideth in the flesh, the flesh can not die at all. Then to bee left of the Father, was as much in the Sonne, as to die. Here are Tertullians words in order as they stand. Where first he maketh the Sonne to die, when hee laide downe his soule into his Fathers hands. This death, by which the soule of Christ departed from his body, was that deliuering, that not sparing, which Paul meant; and that forsaking which Christ spake of on the crosse. What finde you here for the paines of Hell, or for the proper sufferings of the soule? You may peruert any mans words, if you will, but of them selues these are very coherent and euident.
            In Ambrose you finde more hold. He saith: Minus contulerat mihi, nisimeum suscepisset
               f Defenc. pag. 48. li. 17. 
               affectum. Christ had done lesse for me if hee had not beene (altogether) affected, as I should haue beene.] Though you be no good concluder, yet are you a notable translatour. For you can turne the English not onely cleane from, but quite against the Latine. Where Ambrose saith, Christ had done lesse for mee, (if taking my nature vnto him) hee had not also taken my (naturall) affection vnto him) as feare, sorrow, and such like; you misconster affection for punishment, and mine, that is naturally mine, for that which I should haue suffered in hell; and adding the word (altogether) of your owne, you make Ambrose say; that Christ was altogether affected (that is punished in soule) as I should haue beene, (in hell) if I had not bene redeemed. But by what Grammar doth affectus signifie hell paines? Feare, griefe, and sorrow, are naturall affections in all men, and passions of the soule; they signifie not in their owne nature the torments of the damned. How shall we know this to bee Ambrose meaning? Hee that hath but halfe an eye, may see by that whole Chapter the roote of this sorrow, to bee the infirmitie of our nature in Christ, and the cause thereof to be his compassion and pitie had of vs, and for vs. The next words to those which you bring, are. Ambros. in Luc. li. 10. de tristitia & dolere Christs. 
               Ergo pro me doluit, qui pro se nihil habuit quod doleret. And presently, taedio meae infirmitatis afficitur. Christ therefore sorrowed for me, who had nothing in him selfe for which he should sorrow; he is affected with the tediousnesse of my infirmitie. The tediousnesse of our infirmitie affected him, not the torments of hell suffered in his owne soule. Ibidem. 
               Ne
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   speciem incarnationis suscepit, sed veritatem. Debuit ergo & dolorem suscipere, vt vinceret tristitiam, non excluderet. Christ tooke vpon him not the shew, but the trueth of our flesh. Hee was therefore to feele griefe, (as a consequent to our nature) that he might ouercome sorrow, and not exclude it. 
               Ibidem. 
               Tristis est non ipse, sed anima. Suscepit enim animam meam, suscepit corpus meum. Anima obnoxia passionibus. Christ was sorrowfull not in person, but in soule. For he tooke vnto him my soule, and my body. Now the soule it is, that is subiect to passions. Is hell with you of late become a naturall infirmitie and affection, that wheresoeuer you reade either of these words, you streight inferre the paines of hell? The causes of Christes sorrow will put all out of doubt, and are plainely recited by Ambrose in the ende of this Chapter, though stifly reiected by you, because they sort not with your conceits. Ibid. 
               Tristis videbatur, & tristis erat, non pro sua passione, sed pro nostra dispersione. Christ seemed sorrowfull, and indeede was sorrowfull, not for his owne suffering, but for our dispersing. You say Christs sorrow was for the suffering of hell paines in his soule; Ambrose saith in expresse words; Christ sorrowed not for his owne suffering: which of you twaine shall wee thinke best vnderstoode Ambrose meaning? him selfe, or you? Christ, sorowed, saith Ambrose, Ambros. ibid. 
               for our dispersion; he sorrowed because he left vs orphanes,

he sorrowed for his persecutors. All these occasions of sorrow in Christ at the time of his passion mentioned by Ambrose you vtterly disauerre, and in spite of Ambrose teeth, you will haue the infirmitie and affection of mans nature in Christ to signifie hell.
            Yet Ierom shall helpe at a neede, who saith; Defenc. pa. 44. li. 20. 
               That which we should haue borne for our sinnes, the same (Christ) suffered for vs.] You might haue done well to haue put quicquid for quod, as one of your fellowes hath done alleaging this place, that where Ierom would not say, Christ suffered for vs, whatsoeuer we should haue suffered, your selues may speake it in his name. Neither is it so strange a thing with you to translate all for some. In the very next Page before, citing Ambrose words, hoc in se obtulit Christus, quod induit; Christ offered that in him selfe, which he tooke (of vs;) you render it, Christ offered in sacrifice 
               Defenc. pa. 47. li. 17. ALL that which he assumed; which translation is euidently false, whatsoeuer the illation be. This place of Ierom I haue already answered in the Pag. 350. conclusion of my Sermons; and but that the booke happely will not alwaies be at hand, I would spend no moe words therein. The particular can not hurt me, if it be simply graunted; and the generall is not affirmed by Ierom. Howbeit Ierom in plaine speech presently expresseth what he ment Christ suffered for vs. By this (saith he) Hiero. in Esa. cap. 53. 
               it is manifest, that as Christs body whipt and torne bare the printes of the stripes and wrongs, so his soule truely sorrowed for vs. What neede we any other exposition then his owne, that Christ suffered for vs smart of body and griefe of minde, which were due to vs in this world where Christ suffered for vs, besides the torments of the next world, where Christ neither did, nor could suffer any thing?
            Cyprians words are far weaker for your purpose, & wider fro your matter. He saith, Christ was called sinne, and a curse; 
               Cypria. de passione Christi. 
               pro similitudine poenae, non culpae; for the likenesse of punishment, not of fault: LIKE is farre lesse then the same. If therefore Christs punishment were but like, there is no necessitie it should be the same. Againe, when Cyprian nameth the likenesse of our punishment suffered by Christ on the crosse; he meaneth the punishment of sinne, that God inflicted on Adam, and all his of-spring in this life, where Christ suffered for vs, as sorrow, shame, reproch, paine, and death which were the punishments that God laid on Adams transgression in this life. The death of the Soule Adam pulled on him selfe by sinning; that Christ suffered not: the other God inflicted with his owne mouth, and by them accursed and punished sinne in this world, reseruing his terrible and eternall iudgements, which are the paines of hell, to an other time and place, when the bodies of the wicked should be altered and abled to endure those intolerable and euerlasting torments, threatned, but not executed in this world. The first kind of punishment due to all men in this life for sinne, Cyprian saw and knew full well, and by the Scriptures found that to be in Christ on the Crosse; the paines of hell Cyprian knew not, much lesse could he be sure that Christ suffered them, since no such thing is mentioned in the Scriptures. Let then the Reader iudge, whether Cyprian were likely to speake of that, which he knew and read, or rashly to pronounce that to be like, which he neither knew nor read. But if Cyprian bee the fittest man to declare his owne meaning, Cyprian euen in that place speaketh directly against your supposed paines of hell, suffered in the soule of Christ on the Crosse. Admiror te cruci inter damnatos affixum, iam nec tristem, nec pauidum,
               Cypria. ibid.

I admire thee, ô Lord, being once fastned to the Crosse amidst the condemned (theeues) to bee now neither sorrowfull, nor fearefull, but despising the punishments (laid on thee) with thine hands lifted vp to triumph ouer Amelec, (the enemies of Gods people.) If Christ once fastned to the Crosse had neither sorrow nor feare, but a neglect of his paines, and a ioyfull triumph ouer all his foes, I trust hee felt not the paines of hell; which were very easie, if they brought with them neither sorrow, nor feare, but rather contempt and triumph.
            Christ feared before in the garden, you will say, and for feare or paine did sweate bloud.] That Cyprian remembreth and explaineth, wherein you shall see the difference betwixt his iudgement and yours of Christs sufferings. Cypria. ibid. 
               Thou diddest Lord (saith he) professe before thine Apostles thy selfe to be sorrowfull vnto death, and for exceeding

griefe didst power foorth a bloudie sweate. Hearing this (in the gospel) I was vtterly abashed. For who will not feare, if be feare whom all things feare? His answere I wil set downe in Latine, though it will be the longer, as well to let the Reader heare Cyprians resolution in his owne words, which many will desire, and to discharge my selfe from all quarels of mistranslating, whiles I sometimes seeke to make that plaine to the simple, which in the text is more darke and obscure; as for diuers other respects, which I will after mention, when Cyprians minde is fully knowen. His words are,Cypria. de passione in initio. 
               Sed metus ille infirmitatis humanae communem exprimebat affectum, & generalitatem omnium in carne viuentium hoc dolore vrgeri, & dissolutionem corporeae spiritualis
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   naturae hac molestia non posse carere, & hanc poenam vniuersae successioni Adam sine exceptione impositam, vt difficultas extremi transit us timeretur. Hanc nemo anxietatem euasit, & nemo egrediente anima sine amaritudine expirauit. But that feare (of thine o Lord) did expresse the common affection of mans infirmitie, and the generall state of all liuing in the flesh to be pressed with this sorrow; and that the separation of body and soule can not be free from this griefe, but this punishment is laide on all Adams posteritie without exception, that the difficultie of departing this life should be feared: this wofulnesse no man euer escaped, neither did euer any man breath out his soule without bitternesse.
            
            Here you may learne; first, whence Ambrose, who was a great follower of Cyprian, tooke his words of humane infirmitie and affection, and what hee meant by them. Secondly, that this is a punishment (which you denie) laide by God himselfe on all mankinde, to feare and feele death separating the soule from the body. Thirdly, from this was no man euer exempted, but euen Christ himselfe, though he were free from that necessitie, yet would hee be partaker of this our infirmitie. Fourthly, that where on the crosse Christ neither feared nor sorrowed, but shewed him selfe terrible to his persecutors, and a conquerour of all their malice, and a triumpher ouer all their iniuries, yet to his Disciples in the garden hee opened his affection incident to our nature, thereby to confirme himselfe to bee a true man by his taking as well our infirmities, as our flesh. Lastly out of Cyprian in that Sermon you may learne, that to Christ the
               Cypria. ibid. 
               sight of (God) his Father could not bee formidable, that it was his Fathers will the sacrifice of his flesh should begin with feare and sorrow, that hee sorrowed to heale our weaknesse, and feared to make vs secure, by repressing those infirmities in his owne person, to cure them in vs for euer after. All these and many moe good lessons you cleane ouerslip in Cyprian, and broching a new doctrine quite contrarie to his, you lay violent hands on one poore word in that whole treatie, which yet maketh nothing for you; and as though you had performed a worthy worke, grossely to mistake the like for the same, you muster Cyprian as a maintainer of your new made hell.
            
               Defenc pag. 47. li. 24. 
               Say as Fulgentius saith, and wee aske no more. Quicquid fuit infirmitatis animae, sine peccato suscepit & pertulit. Christ tooke vpon him and suffered whatsoeuer infirmitie may bee in the soule without sinne.] I hope you will your selfe accept the condition, which you offer to others, and I require no more. But what is there in these words on which you so stoutly stand, and so confidently crake, that helpeth your deuice forward? Grant them absolutely, and what conclude you? The griefe of hell paines suffered from the immediate hand of God, is an infirmitie of the soule, you must say; if you will say any thing towards the matter you haue in hand. But who euer said so, that knew his left hand from his right? What passing dulnesse and surpassing drowsinesse is this, to make the suffering of hell paines from the immediate hand of God an infirmitie of the soule? As if it were weaknesse in man, not to be stronger then God; or imbecilitie, not to be able to resist his power? [Feare and sorrow are infirmities; and Fulgentius sayth whatsoeuer infirmitie, that is whatsoeuer feare, or sorow may be in the soule, the same Christ tooke and suffered.] These must be your collections, if you open your mouth to make any; and these bee so grosse, that no boy would engage himselfe with them. For the name of Infirmitie doth naturally note the speciall kindes thereof, by which they differ from other things that are not infirmities; it doth not import either degrees, to which they may grow; or the causes, from whence they may rise. Is it then any consequent,

that if Christ tooke vpon him all kinds of infirmities, and passions of the soule, he must therefore vndergoe all degrees, and all the causes of feare and sorrow, that may be in the soule? Christ did feare, and Christ did sorow; for those without question were infirmities of his humane soule. Will it thence follow that Christ suffered all those dangers, losses, harmes, which men in this life doe, and may feare? If these will no way follow vpon Fulgentius words, how will the paines of hell be thence deriued, which I vtterly denie to be any infirmitie in mans soule, since no creature is so strong, though he were an Angell, as to decline, or resist the hand of God in punishing? Fulgentius wordes therefore, that Christ tooke vnto him euery infirmitie of the soule, doe not inferre that Christ suffered euery degree, or euery obiect of feare and sorrow, but onely that he feared and sorowed, which maketh as much for your hell paines, as feathers doe to reare a fortresse.
            The wordes of Fulgentius at your best aduantage doe you little good; his true meaning doth you farre lesse. For going onward to debate this matter more at large, he addeth two conditions to the infirmities and affections of Christs soule: the one that they were naturall, that is necessarily consequent to the nature of man; the other that they were voluntarie in Christ, though in vs they be necessarie. These limitations are very often in that Booke expressed, whence your words are taken. Fulgentius de passione Domini ad Trasimundū lib. 3. 
               Animae tristitiam & perturbationem, quam voluntariam in anima Dei filius habuit sic habuisse credatur, vt etiam ipsas humanae animae passiones, & voluntate veras, & in veritate voluntarias non n
                     •…
                  gemus. The sorrow and trouble of soule which the Sonne of God had voluntarily in his soule, he must be beleeued so to haue had, that we done them not to be true, because they were voluntarie; nor to be voluntarie, because they were true. This hee maketh common to bodie and soule. Ibidem. 
               Quia verum hominem suscepit, ideo cunctas humanae naturae infirmitates veras quidem, sed voluntarias in eadem veritate naturae duntaxat humanae sustinuit. Because Christ tooke vpon him to be a true man, therefore he sustained ALL the true infirmities of mans nature, but yet voluntarie in the trueth of the same nature onely. If you know not what naturall and voluntarie passions in Christes manhood doe meane, you may learne of Damascene, whom an adherent of yours much esteemeth, and often alleageth, though Damascene make nothing for his or your purposes. Wee confesse, sayth Damascene, that Christ tooke vnto him 
               Damascenus orthodox. fides lib. 3. cap. 20. ALL NATVRALL AND BLAMELESSE passions. For he assumed the whole man, and all that pertained to man, saue sinne. Naturall and blamelesse passions are those, which are not in our power, and whatsoeuer entred into mans life, through the condemnation of (Adams) sinne, as hunger, thirst, weakenesse, labour, weeping, corruption, shunning of death, feare, agonie, whence (came) sweat and drops of blood. These things are in all men by nature. Christ therefore tooke all these vnto him, that he might sanctifie them all. Howbeit our naturall passions were in Christ according to nature, and aboue nature. According to nature they were stirred vp in Christ, when he permitted his flesh to endure that which was proper vnto it. Aboue nature (they were in Christ) because nature in him did neuer go
                     •…
                   before his will. For there was nothing forced in him, but all things voluntarie. When he would he hungred, when he would he thirsted, when he would he feared; when he would he died. The naturall infirmities and passions then, which Christ tooke vnto him, as Damascene teacheth, were common to all men by nature, and so are not the paines of hell; they were in this life, so a
                  •…
                not the other; they were sanctified, so cannot the torments of hell be; they were voluntarie, that is, they mooued not in Christ, but at his owne will. Wherefore by Damascenes iudgement, Christ did not suffer your hellish torture from the immediate hand of God, by which he was wholy amazed and ouerwhelmed, as you say, with the waight and anguish of them, which could not be with his will.
            I haue stood to Fulgentius words, more then which you did not aske; will you now likewise be tried by Fulgentius testimonie, whether you teach an errour exiled from all Christian hearts in his age? Or if you will not, your Reader will soone perceaue, that what was then reiected for an absurditie and falsitie, (I will spare heauier termes till I come to fuller proofes) can not now be professed as pietie. Touching

Christs death by which wee are redeemed, that it had in it neither the death of the soule, nor the paines of hell, Fulgentius is very plaine euen in the same booke, where you would haue him so much forget himselfe, as to speake the contrary. Fulgentius ad Trasimundum lib. 3. 
               Quis ignoret Christum nec diuinitate, sed in solo corpore mortuum & sepultum? Who can be ignorant (if he be a Christian) that Christ died and was buried not in his diuinitie, but onely in bodie? and againe, Ibidem. 
               In morte solius carnis immortalis fuit. Christ was immortall, nothing dying in him but his flesh. And so Ibidem. 
               Cum sola caro moreretur & resuscitaretur in Christo, filius Dei dicitur mortuus. When onely the flesh died and was raised againe in Christ, yet the Sonne of God is said to haue died. And as though no repeating were susficient; Ibidem. 
               In tota (humanitate) traditus idem Christus, secundum solam carnem mortuus, secundum solam carnem de sepulcho surrexit. The same Christ deliuered in his whole (humanitie) died in his flesh onely, and rose againe onely in his flesh. And least you should wrench aside, as you afterward doe, that the name of Christs flesh containeth soule and bodie; besides that the word bodie directly excludeth the soule, which can not be the bodie; and so doeth the buriall and resurrection of Christ, for so much as the soule of Christ neither was, neither could be buried nor raised from the graue; Fulgentius in full and faire words exempteth not only the deitie, but the soule of Christ as well as the deitie from death. Fulgentius eodem libro. 
               Moriente carne non solum deitas, sed nec anima Christi potest ostendi commortua. When Christ died in the flesh, neither can the godhead, nor the soule of Christ be shewed to haue bene also dead. And of hell paines he saith, Ibidem. 
               Dignum fuit, vt animam dolor non contigisset inferni, quam seruitus nequiuit tenere peccati. It was a meete (and right) thing that the paines of hell should not touch that soule, whom the seruitude of sinne could not fasten on.
            
            Yet Cyrill in the place aboue cited 
               Defenc. pag. 48. li. 35. SEEMETH to acknowledge A KIND OF DEATH EVEN OF THE SOVLE, from which Christ reuiued againe. But of that in due place hereafter.] Is the death of Christs soule so slender a matter, that you may collect it by a seeming, and a kind of death, without any mention, or occasion of any such thing comprised in Cyrils words? The Reader may there obserue what your maine intent is, and whereon you fasten your eyes all this while, euen on the death of Christs soule to be requisite for our Redemption, though you finde no such thing in Scripture or Father; but miserably and childishly slide it in at last with a seeming. Now if there be no such thing in Cyrils words, nor any such seeming, how wel deserue you to be hissed out with hands, if not to be hurled out by the heeles, for a seeming sleeper, if not for a waking dreamer? what are those words of Cyrill, that seeme to acknowledge the death of Christs soule? Christ bestowed his flesh as a ransome for our flesh, and made his soule likewise the price of redemption for our soules, although he liued againe, being by nature life it selfe. It is lawfull for you to further euery place you bring, with a mayned and forced translation. Cyrils true words stand thus: Cyril. ad Theodosium de rectafide. 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               . Without constraint of any, Christ of himselfe laide downe his owne soule for vs, that he might be Lord of dead and quicke: yeelding his flesh in recompence, as a gift fully worth it, for the flesh of all, and making his soule (or life) a ransome for the soule (or life) of all, though he reuiued againe, being life by nature, in that he was God. The words which you would cite, are heere no perfect sentence, as hauing no principall verbe in them, and therefore must be ioyned with the former and depend vpon the verbe 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                (Christ layd downe his soule) which gouerneth the whole; as appeareth also by the two participles 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , yeelding in recompence, and 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , making, which must be directed by the same nominatiue case that 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                is, and likewise by the opposition of the verbe 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , he reuiued. Of what death Cyrill here speaketh, is more then manifest by the words of our Sauiour here vsed and deriued from the Gospell, where he said, Iohn 10. 
               None taketh my soule from me, or constraineth me to die, I lay it downe of my selfe; and likewise, Matth. 20. 
               the Sonne of man came to giue his soule (or life) a ransome for many. What kind of death those words of Christ imported, I made it appeare but a little before by the full consent of Scriptures and

interpreters old and new, and of Cyrill himselfe, who all with one accord referre both those sayings to the death of Christs bodie, and the losse of his life on the Crosse, when his soule departed from him. Set that downe in Cyrils first words for the death which Christ died by the constant assertion of Scriptures, Fathers, New writers, and of Cyrill himselfe; and then the words which you alleage shew plainely the force of his corporall death to be auaileable for the bodies and soules of all men, in that his flesh yeelded to death was a recompence or exchange for all mens flesh; and his soule laide downe without constraint of any, was the ransome of all mens soules; and he notwithstanding rose againe the third day to life by his owne power, as being God and life it selfe, against whom death could preuaile no farder, nor longer, then hee him selfe would.
            Where are the words that acknowledge the death of Christs Soule, or that so much as seeme to acknowledge a kind of death in the soule of Christ? Here are the cleane contrarie. For if the death of Christs bodie, by which he laid aside his soule for vs, be sufficient to redeeme the bodies and soules of all men, then superfluous and needlesse euen by these words was the death of Christs soule, the whole being fully perfourmed without it. But he gaue his flesh to be a ransome for our flesh, and his soule for our soules, you say, and yet liued againe.] Cyrill doth not say by seuerall deaths, but by one and the same death, which was the laying down of his soule or life for vs, as Christ himselfe in the Gospel said he would. If those wordes inferre the death of Christes soule, why bring you not the words of Christ himselfe, saying; Matth. 20. 
               The Sonne of man came to giue his soule a ransome for many. You saw the Scriptures themselues and the whole Church of Christ, first and last, I meane all old and new writers, translators and expositors would condemne your folly therin, in most exact words taking soule there for life, which must needes import the death of Christs bodie. And therefore you thought it more safetie to catch at the same words in some Father, for whose meaning there could not be brought so many, and so sound deponents. But all in vaine. For if Christ had no meaning in those wordes to point out the death of his owne soule, then Cyrill alleaging and obseruing the words of Christ, can haue no such purpose as to crosse the Scriptures, himselfe, and all the Fathers of Christs Church in a matter so dangerous and desperate, as the death of Christs soule amounteth vnto. In the meane while his words conclude no such thing, neither in saying nor in seeming; and so your embracing them to that end, argueth your good will to seeke, but your euill lucke to finde any such thing as the death of Christs soule in all the Fathers.
            
               Cyrill doth not say Christ rose againe, which properly belongeth to the body, but he reuiued or liued againe which seemeth to be spoken of the Soule.] Then Saint Paul maketh more for you, then Cyrill doth: for he affirmeth both os Christ; to this end (saith he) Christ died, and rose againe, and reuiued, that he might be Lord of dead and liuing. And indeed resurrection properly noteth from whence Christ arose, to wit from the graue; Reuiuing expresseth the blessed and glorious life which he enioyed, after he was risen from the dead. Christ himselfe saith of his, they shall come forth (of their graues) Ioh. 5. v. 29. 
               vnto the resurrection of life, to separate them from the wicked who shall come likewise forth vnto the resurrection, but of iudgement and condemnation. Notwithstanding in Christ there is either no difference betwixt them, the one euer implying the other; or if we make any, Christs reuiuing alwaies presupposeth his Resurrection as antecedent, since he possessed not that immortall and heauenly life, which now he hath, but vpon his arising from the dead. And so the Apostle placeth them, Christ died, and rose againe, and reuiued (into such power and glory, that he was) made Lord ouer dead and quicke. And Cyrill who often times vseth this word (he reuiued) of Christ, meaneth the third day after Christs death, when the Scriptures affirme he rose from the graue. So Cyrill and the Synode of Alexandria that ioyned with him in writing vnto Nestorius say of Christ. Epist. Cyrilli & Synode Alex. ad Nestorium. 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , he reuiued the third day hauing spoyled hell; and so in his second confession of the true faith to the religious Queenes, Cyrill de fide ad Reginas li. 2. 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               . Christ spoyling death reuiued the third day.
               
And in his Epistle to those of Egypt. Christ is said (in the Scriptures) first to haue died as a man, 
               Cyrill epist. ad Presbyt. & mo
                     •…
                  ch Aegypt. 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , and after that to haue returned to life, by that which he was by Nature. If then he died not in the flesh according to the Scriptures, he was not quickned by the Spirit, 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , that is he reuiued not againe. So that Cyrill hath not any seeming words for the death of Christs Soule; but saith as Christ said in effect before, that the Sonne of man gaue his (soule or) life to be a ransome for the life of all, and not for the Soule of all, which in the singular number is neither good English, nor good Diuinitie, though to smooth it, you put the plurall and say, for our soules, which is not in Cyrill.
            The words of Ambrose will prooue that Christ offered his Soule for vs; Defenc. pa. 47. li. 17. 
               hoc in se obtulit Christus quod induit. Christ offered in Sacrifice all that which he assumed.] Besides that you falsifie Ambrose by adding ALL to his words, which haue no such thing in them, you 
                  •…
               est Ambroses words against Ambroses meaning. For though it may well be graunted, that Christ offered body and soule as a Sacrifice of holinesse and obedience vnto God; and that Christs Soule likewise was laid downe vnto the death of his body to feele the smart thereof, and to be seuered by the force thereof; in which respect Esay saith, that Christ powred forth his Soule vnto death: Yet Ambrose speaking of Christs sacrifice for the sinnes of the people, meaneth (as the rest of the Fathers doe) that part of the Sacrifice, which was slaine; which was by his and their confession, Christs body, and not Christs Soule. Heare Ambrose him selfe Ambros. de fide. li. 3. ca. 5. 
               In quo nisi in corpore, expiauit populi peceata? In quo passus est nisi in corpore? Wherein did Christ sacrifice for the sinnes of the people, but in his body? wherein did he suffer (death) but in his body? And so Theodoret: Christ was
               Theodoret. Dialogo. 1. 
               called a Priest in his humane nature, 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , and offered none other Sacrifice but his owne body. Athanasius nameth what Christ put on, and what he offered. Athanasius contra Ar

               . Putting on a body that was borne and made, which he might offer for vs. Nazianzene saith to Christ. Nazianzen. in illud Euangelis, Cum consummasset Iesus hos sermones. 
               Thou art a sheepe, because thouwast a Sacrifice; thou art an hie Priest, because thou offeredst thy body. Augustine also, Sacerdos propter victimam, quam pro nobis offerret, a nobis acceptam. Christ 
                     〈◊〉
                   a Priest, for the Sacrifice, he tooke of vs, that he might offer it for vs. What that Sacrifice was he sheweth saying: Idem in Psal. 64. 
               Assumpsit a nobis, quod offerret Domino; ipsas diximus sanctas primitias carnis ex vtero virginis: Christ tooke of vs that he might offer to the Lord, we meane the holy first fruits of his flesh
               y August. in Psal. 109. (taken) from the wombe of the Virgine. Theophylact; Theophylact in cap. 8 e

                  st. ad Hebraeos. 
               A Priest may by no meanes be without a Sacrifice. It was then necessarie that (Christ) should haue somewhat to offer. Quod autem offerretur praeter eius corpus nil quidpiam erat; necessariò ergo & mortuus est. Now there was vtterly nothing that he might offer, besides his body; it was needfull then he should die.
            
            This that Christ tooke a body to offer, is most agreeable to Ambroses mind as well in the booke which you cite, as in other parts of his writings. Ambros. de incarnat. Doman. sacramento. ca. 6. 
               Ex segenerauit Maria, Marie conceiued of her selfe, (to wit, of her owne body) that what was conceiued of her, might be the true nature of a body. And alleadging Saint Pauls words; that Christ was made of the seede of Dauid according to the flesh, Rom. 1. and made of a woman, Galat. 4. He concludeth; Ibidem. 
               Ergo ex nobis accepit, quod proprium offerret pro nobis, vt nos redimeret ex nostro. Then Christ tooke of vs, that which hee might offer as his owne for vs, to the ende he might redeeme vs by that which was ours. And declaring what he meant euen by the words, which you bring, Christ offered that in himselfe which hee put on; Ambrose addeth: Ibid. 
               Non igitur diuinitatem induit, sed carnem assumpsit, vt spolium carnis exueret, Christ put not on the nature of his Diuinitie, but he tooke flesh that he might put off the spoyle of his flesh (when he should die.) Now if the flesh of Christ were subiect to all iniuries, how say you, that Christs flesh is of the same substance with his Godhead? What else doe you in so saying, but compare Adams slime and our earth to the Diuine substance? Here Ambrose plainely confesseth, what hee meant, Christ tooke vnto him, and offered for vs; euen Adams slime and our earth, whereof his body was made. Which elsewhere hee precisely

auoucheth, saying. Ambros in Epist. ad Heb. cap. 10. 
               Corpus suscepit nostrae mortalitatis, vt pro nobis haberet quid offerret. Christ assumed our mortall body, that he might haue what to offer for vs.
            
            And least you should after your trifling maner, aske whether we exclude an humane soule from the body, which Christ tooke of the substance of his mother, and which hee offered for vs to death on the Crosse, I answere with Ambrose. Ambros. de incarnat. Doman. Sacram. cap. 7. 
               Cum susceperit carnem hominis, consequens est vt perfectionem incarnationis plenitudinem
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   susceperit. Nihil enim in Christo imperfectum. Where as Christ tooke vnto him the flesh of a man, it is consequent that hee tooke vnto him the perfection and fulnesse of incarnation; for there is nothing imperfect in Christ. And what neede was there, hee should take flesh without a Soule, when as an insensible flesh, and an vnreasonable soule was neither subiect to sinne, nor capable of reward? An humane soule was a necessarie sequell to Christs body, which he tooke of the seede of Dauid and substance of his mother, as it is to all ours before we can be men: but the soule is not comprised in the name of the body, much lesse doeth it receiue the same conditions and properties which the body doth. Though then I make no doubt, but Christ at his birth and at his death, as all his life long, had both a body and a perfect reasonable and humane soule, indued with all the powers, affections and infirmities of mans nature, saue sinne and the corruption of sinne; yet is it no consequent with Ambrose, that Christs soule was made of a woman as his flesh was, nor that Christ died the death of the soule, when his body died on the Crosse. Let them doubt (saith Ambrose) Ambros. de incarnat. Domin. Sacram. cap. 7. 
               of that which the Prophet saith (my soule hateth your new Moones and Sabboths;) This that is testified in the Gospel (therefore the Father loueth me because I lay downe my soule to take it againe) they can not refute to bee spoken of the proprietie of the soule, when as it is spoken of the Lords death and resurrection. The bodie of Christ could not die, but by laying downe his soule, as also it could not rise to life, but by taking it againe. So that both Christes death and his resurrection doe cleerely prooue, that he had a true soule as Ambrose noteth, which by his death was seuered from his body, and by his resurrection was assumed againe into his body. And yet that death was proper to Christs body and not to his soule; though the soule felt the smart and sting thereof as well before, as when it departed from his body. Tertull. contra Marcionem. li. 5. cap. 9. 
               Corpus est quod amit tit animam, & amittendo fit mortuum; it a mortui vocabulum corpori competit. Porro si resurrectio mortui est, mortuum autem non aliud est quàm corpus, corporis erit resurrectio. It is the body (saith Tertullian) that looseth the soule, and by loosing it dieth, so that the word, dead, agreeth to the body. Now if the resurrection be of that which was dead, and nothing can be dead besides the body, Resurrection must likewise pertaine to the body. This death and this resurrection, I meane of the body, was found in Christ, yours is very strange to Ambrose and to all the Fathers. Ambro. de fide li. 3. cap. 5. 
               Per quam nisiper corporis mortem, mortis vincula dissoluit? By what other death (saith Ambrose) then by the death of the body, did Christ breake the bands of death?
            
            Thus haue you spent your great store of Fathers with small successe; and though you dissemble where you borrowed them, yet you dissemble not your excessiue bragging of them, as if they were Defenc. pag 49. l. 1. 
               cleane against me, and for you in the chiefest point of this question: where indeede you doe but reach after a word in them here and there, and that not rightly conceaued, or not rightly translated; from whence you would faine inferre your fansies, saue that neither the grounds of trueth nor learning, will beare you out in your conclusions. That Christs sufferings did belong to bodie and soule the Fathers affirme, whether by Sympathie or without Sympathie they say nothing; much lesse that Christ suffered in minde distinctly from soule or bodie. Nazianzene saith he assumed mans mind at his incarnation, that thereby he might sanctifie it; besides him not one of your places so much as nameth the minde. As for Gods immediate hand punishing the soule of Christ, in his passion, if you should fast till you find that in these or any other Fathers, you should fast, not fourtie dayes but yeares. And as though these were not falsities enough to loade the Fathers with, you hoyse vp the top sayle of vntrueth, and flant it out, that Defenc. pag. 49. li. 6. 
               these Fathers say, Christ suffered all these paines, which els we should haue suffered, and was spared in nothing: plainely

belying your Authors, which say no such thing, and out-facing your Reader, as if his sight did not serue him to seuer your shamefull additions from the texts of those ancient writers. Cyrill sayth, Christ suffered all things (that is, all naturall and innocent infirmities and passions of bodie and soule, as Cyrill explaineth himselfe in the same Chapter, yea in the close of the very same sentence) to whose words you adde of your owne, WHICH els we should haue suffered. Only, you ioyned them at first so cunningly to Cyrils sentence hauing two parts, that a man could not readily tell to which you referred this addition, saue that now in the recapitulation of your proofes, you apparantly tie them to the former. For if you made Cyrill to say, Christ suffered to free vs from all, which els we should haue suffered, that assertion is verie true; onely, these last words are yours and not Cyrils. If you make him to say, Christ suffered all, which els we should haue suffered, this hath neither trueth in it, nor any colour in Cyrils text. Ierome indeede saith, Christ suffered that which we ought to haue suffered, meaning, what Christ suffered, was due to vs, and not to him; but Ierome is farre from your all, which els we should haue suffered.
            
            Your sleight then in collecting your conceits from the Fathers sayings, is woorth the obseruing. Nazianzene sayth, Christ in his incarnation assumed mans mind to sanctisie it. Cyrill saith, Christ SVFFERED ALL the infirmities and passions of mans nature. Ierome sayth: That which was due to vs for our sinnes, Christ suffered for vs. And Tertullian saith, God spared not his owne Sonne, but deliuered him for vs, that is, God spared him not from deliuering. Out of these foure places, hauing different causes, ends, and respects, for which, to which, & in which they were written, you clout this conclusion, as common to them all, which is repugnant to euery one of them; that Christ IN MIND (so saieth Nazianzene) SVFFERED ALL, (so saith Cyrill) WHICH VVAS DVE TO VS, (so saith Ierome) WITHOVT SPARING, (so saith Tertullian.) By this order and manner of hudling and hampering different things and diuerse places together, you may collect what you will, when you will, and out of whom you will; and this is your Defenc. pa. 49. l. 8. 
               cleare and plaine sense of the Fathers against the which you say I can take no exception.
            
            After this you fal againe to your first trench more of termes, and wandering a while about the phrases of Gods proper wrath, the true and right punishment of sinne, two countenances in Christ, and the coincidence of his soule and spirit; you would faine conclude if you could, that if Christ suffered the wrath of God for vs, he suffered the true paines of hell; which I auouched you neuer should be able to doe. Whether I or you abuse the Reader with ambiguous and doubtfull words I leaue to his iudgement, that taketh the paines to peruse what is past, and what followeth: truely I disaduantage my selfe very much so precisely to diuide, distinguish and prooue euery thing as I doe, if I ment to slide away with generalities. But you that neither can, nor will specifie any parts, nor bring any proofes of your chiefest assertions, but keepe your selfe safe vnder the shelter of certaine phrases deuised by your selfe without any warrant of Scriptures or Fathers, and neuer expounded nor defined in all your writing, saue onely with AS IT VVERE, and after a sort; what meaning you can haue to handle so great matters as mans redemption and saluation after so sleight a manner, besides a vaine ostentation of your contentious and curious humour, I leaue it to the Readers censure. Now to the returne of your termes.
            
               Defenc. pag. 49. l. 31. 
               According to the most vsuall and common sense of Gods wrath, so in my whole Treatise I take it for Gods perfect holinesse, iustice, and power properly executing vengeance and punishment
               Iohn 3. 
               (whether little or great) due to them on whom sinne lieth.] Take from you yourPsal. 20. termes no where found in the Scriptures, but inuented and authorized onely by your2. Corin. 3. selfe, and you can not steppe one foote further in this question. You haue named, I know not how often, Gods PROPER VVRATH in the premises, though you neuer tooke the care nor paines to describe or define it. Now you come to the most vsuall & common sense of Gods wrath, which you say is Gods PROPER wrath. Except that old starting hole of yours, which here you call the proper executing of punishment; and

there is nothing more repugnant to your owne assertion, then your owne description. For all the afflictions of this life, whatsoeuer they be, come from Gods perfect holinesse, iustice, and power, and are due to the children of Adam for sinne abiding or dwelling in them, though God of his secret counsell may haue other purposes in sifting his Saints for their good and his glorie. Your sense of Gods wrath you say is most vsuall, but you shew not where, nor with whom. If you meane with your selues, I can easily yeeld that; if you meane in the Scriptures, I greatly doubt whether the wrath of God in the Scriptures doe more vsually signifie his euerlasting iudgements against sinne after this life, or his temporall plagues vpon sinners in this life. Howbeit it is not greatly materiall, which is most vsuall, since either is vsuall in the word of God. You quote but foure places for that purpose in your Margin, and misse two of them. For in the 2. Cor. 3. vers. 17. and 9. I finde not the name of Gods wrath at all expressed in either of them. But I so vse the phrase as signifying any punishment of sinne whatsoeuer.] The Scriptures so vse it before me, and you can giue no reason, why I should not so vse it after them. It is altogether an improper speech, you say.] So say you, but the Scriptures say not so. They make degrees and differences betwixt the wrath of God in this world and in the next, and his displeasure against the sinnes of his own, and his enemies; but they take not wrath for fauour as you doe, though Gods wrath against the wickednesse of his children be neuer executed without fauor to their persons, which in the faithlesse is farre otherwise.
            
               Defenc. pa. 50. li. 5. 
               It is true, all troubles, paines and griefs in their first ordinance were the effects of Gods proper wrath: but in their state and condition now, they are not, namely as the godly doe suffer them.] You are full of shifts, but they are so slender, that they doe but shame you. After much wrangling you grant it to be true, that all troubles, paines and griefs in their first ordinance were the effects of Gods wrath; you say of Gods PROPER VVRATH. Which last I thinke to be vntrue, though the former be verie true. If by their first ordinance you meane the iudgement of God pronounced against Adam and all his ofspring for sinne, and the punishment irreuocably inflicted on mankinde therefore, it is in effect the same which I auouched against you, and so true, that you your selfe dare not contradict it. For if you should, you should openly gainsay the Scriptures, which witnesse that man was created in all integritie of nature, felicitie of state, and perpetuitie of life; and that by sinne, this impuritie, miserie, and mortalitie, which now we all feele, entred into the world as the wages of Adams sinne, and namely, that Gen. 3. v. 16. 
               paine, 
               17. 
               sorrow, and 
               19. 
               death were imposed on Adam (and so on all his) by Gods owne mouth, as effects or degrees of his most iust displeasure against the sinne of our first parents. If you start from this with any shift of words, you start from a maine principle of the Christian faith: but I suppose, that you confesle it by this that you say, they were effects of Gods wrath in their first ordinance, that is, when they were first inflicted on Adam and all his posteritie.
            But NOVV you say, they are NOT so, specially to the godlie.] Since what time beganThe first man punished for his sinne, after Christ was promised. your Now? or when was their state or condition changed? These things were generally and irreuocablely inflicted on all men, as the punishment of sinne in the first man, when as yet they were signes and tastes of Gods wrath not in words, but in deeds; notwithstanding we were then, and long before, euen before Eph. 1. v. 4. 
               the foundation of the world, elected and adopted in Christ Iesu to be heires of eternall saluation. Wherefore2. Tim. 1. v. 9. God euen at the first, when by your confession they were the effects of his wrath, layd them on all, euen on his owne children, whom he meant euerlastingly to saue; and so doth continue them to this day, as monuments of his iust displeasure against sinne euen in his owne seruants and saints. Yea, before God would inflict them, he made open promise of the womans seed, that it should Gen. 3. v. 15. 
               bruize the serpents head; and then to teach his owne, and not onlie the wicked, for whom he reserued euerlasting destruction, what it was by sinne to prouoke him; he loaded the life of all the godlie with sorow, paine and death; to make them for euer by that grieuous but righteous punishment of sinne in themselues, the more mindfull how offensiue sinne was vnto

God; and the more warie how to giue eare to the Serpent against the voice of God. And therefore at the verie first inflicting of them, if wee cast our eyes either on our owne deserts, or on the lot of the wicked, we shall find the wonderfull fauor of God, not onlie in opening his purpose vnto vs, for our euerlasting saluation in Christ, but euen in so tempering the smart of his rod, that by the punishment we did feele in our selues the weight of sinne in some sort, yet by his mercie we should be strengthened, eased, and comforted vnder that burden in this life; and after be receiued into euerlasting blisse. Notwithstanding, when we compare this mortall & miserable condition here with our creation, and with the abundance of Gods blessings richly powred on vs, when he first made vs; we should beholde what sinne had depriued vs of, and subiected vs vnto, though it did not exclude vs from Christ, who loued vs so dearely, that he would and did giue himselfe for vs, rather than we should euerlastingly perish. So that the sorow, paine, and death which the godly feele, were euen at the first layd on them by the same mixture of Gods iustice and mercie, with which they now continue; neither did Christ die for vs, presently to free vs from that sentence of bodilie death, which God had irreuocably pronounced and executed on Adam and his ofspring, by returning him and them to the earth for manie thousand yeeres before Christ came: but rather in that to partake with vs, that he might saue vs from the rest, which in all the wicked did accompany this death; and in the end to raise vs againe to a better life, lest we should faint vnder the hand of God, who fastneth vs to the afflictions of this life by the example and fellowship of Christs sufferings. For if we suffer with him, we shall raigne with him; and we must first die in Adam, before we can be quickned againe in Christ.
            
            They are now profitable for vs, you will say; and so rather helpe vs than hurt vs in this corruption of sinne, with which we are compassed.] I doubt not thereof, and so were they from the first instant that they were imposed on Adam: but how came this corruption of our nature, if not as a punishment of sinne in Adam? and consequently the remedies thereof do also witnesse Gods displeasure against sinne, though they be farre more holesome for vs, than to rot in the sores of our inward corruption. Can any man doubt, but God was and is able to cleere vs, though neuer so corrupt, from the infection and dominion of sinne, by the working of his Spirit more mightilie and casilie than by troubles and griefs, if it had so seemed good to his wisdome and iustice? And had he determined to shew vs onlie loue without all regard to his iustice, how readie was it for him in Christ to haue released as well all corporall and temporall affliction to his elect, as he did spirituall and eternall? But he resolued otherwise in his most wise counsell for the conseruation of his iustice; and so now healeth our corruption with the salue of affliction, to let vs haue continually presented before our eyes, and impressed in our bodies, what our sinne at first did, and still doth deserue, though he neuer withdrew his mercie from vs, which in the end shall most abundantly recompense all. Wherefore it is no reason, that because troubles are profitable or necessarie for our corrupt state, therefore they are not effects of Gods displeasure against sinne: yea rather because God could haue otherwise cured sinne in vs, and would not but by perpetuall affliction; it is an argument, that God so hated sinne in our first parents, that he would haue the verie remembring & curing thereof to be alwayes in this life painfull and grieuous to our outward man, though he would also comfort vs in Christ, whiles heere we liue; and heereafter crowne vs with glorie for Christes sake.
            Neither is this a question of words, whether they be proper or improper in the Scriptures, but a point of doctrine necessarie to be receiued of all men, that the corruption and dissolution of our nature and life in this world, doth manifest the exceeding hatred that naturallie God hath of sinne, who rewarded it in all mankinde so seuerely, that he spared neither the bodies, soules, states, nor liues of his elect, from sensible signes of his detesting sinne in them: though for his sonnes sake, in whom they were beloued and adopted, he would by his wonderfull power rather further than

indanger their saluation euen by those maladies and corrosiues of sinne. This sheweth the greatnesse of Gods power, and goodnesse of his mercie towards vs, but this altereth not the iudgement which God pronounced, and punishment which he inflicted on Adam and all his ofspring for sinne. The corruption and infection of sinne, which naturally and continually dwelleth in all the godly, called by Diuines concupiscence, is it no punishment of sinne, because the guilt thereof is remitted in Baptisme, and now it is left in vs to humble vs, and awake vs to call for grace, and to resist sinne, that striuing with it, we see not only the danger of sinne assaulting vs, but the Spirit of God assisting vs, and bountie of God rewarding vs? The actuall sinnes of the faithfull, shall we thinke them no sinnes but fauors from God, because by them God worketh repentance, submission, conuersion, yea faith, zeale, ioy and thanksgiuing in his elect? August. de corrept. & gratia. cap. 9. 
               God worketh (sayth Austen) all things for the good of those that loue him, and so farre forth vtterly all things, that if any of them stray, and for sake the right way, euen that God turneth to their good, because they returne more humble and better taught. The like I say of death, and other miseries of mans life, pronounced first by Gods mouth, and still inflicted by Gods hand. They are, as they were, degrees or effects of Gods anger against sinne in Adam; pursuing him and all his posteritie for the confirmation of his iustice, though by Gods mercie towards his, they now serue as they did euen at the first in Gods children, to represse sinne, to worke repentance, to raise confidence in God, and contempt of all earthly things, and to exercise the graces of Gods Spirit giuen them, as patience, obedience, and such like, and to giue them assurance of a better life.
            The Church of Christ euer was, and is of the same minde with me, that the death of the bodie with her seeds and fruits in this life, first entred, and still remaineth as a PVNISHMENT of sin. 
               
                  August. de Trinitate. li. 4. cap. 12. 
               Men shunned (saith Austen) the death of the flesh, rather than the death of the spirit, that is, the punishment rather than the cause of the punishment. We came vnto death by sinne, Christ by righteousnesse, & ideo, cum sit mors nostra poena peccati, mors illius facta est hostia pro peccato; and therefore, where our death is the punishment of sinne, his death was the sacrifice for sinne. Theodoret speaking of the separation of bodie and soule, wherby that which is mort all sustaineth death, the soule remaining free from death as being immortall, asketh his aduersarie, 
                  Theodor. dialogo. 3. cap. 2. 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ? Doest thou not thinke death to be a punishment? Who answering; The Diuine Scripture teacheth so much; Theodoret inferreth; Is death then the punishment of sinners? The other yeelding that this is granted of all men, Theodoret concludeth: Why then, since both the soule and bodie sinned, doth the bodie alone sustaine the punishment of death? Fulgentius: 
                  Fulgen. de incarnat. & gratia Christs. cap. 12. 
               Nisi praecessisset in peccato mors animae, nunquam corporis mors in supplicio sequeretur. Except the death of the soule had gone before by sinne, the death of the bodie had neuer followed after as a punishment. And therefore of our flesh he sayth: 
                  Ibid. cap. 13. 
               Nascitur cum poena mortis, & pollutione peccati: It is borne with the punishment of death, and pollution of sinne. And of yoong children: By what iustice is an infant subiected to the wages of sinne, if there be no vncleannesse of sinne in him? or how do we see him strooken with death, if he felt not the sting thereof (which is sinne?) Maxentius in the confession of his faith; 
                  Maxentius in libello fidei cap. 3. 
               We beleeue (sayth he) that not only the death of the bodie, which is the punishment of sinne, but also the sting of death, which is sinne, entred into the world; because we consent not to these men (who say the contrarie) but to the Apostle, who testifieth that sinne and death went ouer all men. Prosper: 
                  Prosperde promissio. & praedict. parte 1. cap. 5. 
               The punishment of sinne, which Adam the root of mankinde receiued by (Gods) sentence, (saying, Earth thou art, and to earth thou shalt returne) and transmitted to his posteritie as to his branches, the Apostle sayth, entred into the world by one mans sinne, and so ranged ouer all men. Beda: 
                  Beda in Psal. 34. 
               The death as well of vs men, as of Christ, is called sinne, because it is the effect and punishment of that sinne which Adam committed. The second councell of Arrange about 450 yeres after Christ confesseth no lesse; 
                  Concilium Arausic anum 2. cap. 2. 
               If any man affirme, that only the death of the bodie, which is the punishment of sinne, and not sinne also, which is the death of the soule, passed by one man to all mankinde, he ascribeth iniustice to God, and

contradicteth the Apostle, who sayth; By one man sinne entred into the world, and by sinne death passed ouer all men.
            
            Our later writers, though they fully defend that God doth not punish his either to destruction, as he doth the wicked; nor for satisfaction of sinne, as he did his owne Sonne for the sinnes of all his Saints; and to comfort the afflicted, they set before them the presence of Gods power assisting them in their miseries, or deliuering them from their troubles, the purpose of God respecting wholy their good, and the promise of God exceedingly recompencing their patience; yet when they come to the causes prouoking God to this seueritie, they acknowledge that to be sinne, and teach euery man to descend into himselfe, and to giue God the glorie, in that his righteous iudgement beginneth at his owne house. Of the euils, (which we suffer in this life) Bullingerus decadis 3. sermo. 3. 
               there be many and sundry causes, saith Bullinger, but sinne it selfe is counted to be the generall cause. For by disobedience sinne entred into the world, and by sinne death, diseases, and all the mischiefes in the world. 
               Ibidem. 
               The persecutions and cruell tortures inflicted on the Church of God, or on particular Martyrs, as they were offered them for the confession and testimony of the faith and truth of the Gospell, so for the most part they had for their causes the offences and sinnes of the godly, which the iustice of God did visite in his seruants, though for the good and welfare of his Saints. 
               Ibidem. 
               The people of Israell sinned against the Lord in the desert vnder the Iudges and Kings very often, and very enormously, and were grieuously punished by the Lord; but againe they were speedily deliuered as often as they acknowledged their sinnes, and turned vnto the Lord. 
               Ibidem. 
               If therefore any man suffer any euill for sinne committed, let him acknowledge the iust iudgement of God vpon himselfe, and humble himselfe vnder the mightie hand of God, confessing it vnto God; and asking pardon with lowly praier, let him patiently beare that which he hath so well deserued to suffer. 
               Zanchij tractat. Theolog. lib. 1. cap 2. thes. 8. 
               It is certaine, saith Zanchius, that all the punishments and miseries, which we feele in this world, are from sin, and inflicted for sinne. In which place he resolueth by a plaine thesis, that death is the punishment of sinne, and (so are) all those things which are the fruits of death, as well in Soule, as in body, and in (our) externall state. 
               Gualther. homil. 118. in 12. cap. Joh. 
               It is an argument (saith Gualther) of a mind skant religious wholy to despise death, quam per peccatum ingressam, & peccati poenam esse omnes Scripturae testantur, which all the Scriptures witnesse came in by sinne, and is the punishment of sinne. In the Philosophers commendations (of the death of the bodie) Petri Martyris loci communes, class. 3. lo. 14. & sect. 5. 
               there are some things (saith Peter Martyr) not agreeable to the Christian faith, and to the sacred Scriptures. For we say, that death must not be accounted any good, but an euill thing. Quandoquidem Deus illam vti poenam inflixit nostro generi; For so much as God inflicted it as a punishment on mankind.

And if there be any to whom it is contenting and acceptable to die, they haue that from some other fountaine, and not from the nature of death. 
               Musculus in locis communibus theologicis de Ira Dei. 
               There might be assigned (saith Musculus) many kinds of the wrath of God, but for this present we content our selues with a triple diuision thereof, whereby we diuide it into generall, temporall, and eternall. The generall (wrath of God) is that wherewith the whole posteritie of Adam is enwrapped for originall sinne. Hence come all the miseries of mankind, which equally follow the condition of men, and cleaue as well to our minds, as to our flesh. The temporall wrath of God is that (Qua peccat is non impiorum modò, sed & piorum irascitur, ac paenas de illis sumit in hac vita,) whereby God is angry with the sinnes not of the wicked onely, but of the godly also, and taketh punishment of them in this life. Whether I speake or thinke otherwise, then these new and old Diuines haue spoken and taught, let the Reader iudge.
            But mine owne Authors in the very places, which I alleadge, doe say that the nature of death is changed, and that God is angry with his elect, as a Father with his beloued children, to chasten and amend them.] Peter Martyr saith indeede the nature of death is chaunged by Gods goodnes making that profitable to vs, which of it selfe is very harmefull: but with what condition doth he say it is changed? Pet. Mart. loc. com. classe 3. lo. 14. sect. 7. 
               Puta,

si quis obediente animo eam sube at, néque poenam illam reijciat, quam diuina iustitia nos omnes voluerit exoluere: If a man submit himselfe vnto it with an obedient hart, and reiect not that punishment, which the iustice of God would haue vs all to suffer. And so it was chaunged, euen when it was inflicted on the elect in Adams loynes. For Christ was first promised to be the bruizer of the Serpents head. Now if death afterward tooke full and euerlasting hold on Christs members, then the serpent preuailed against Christ and his chosen, and not Christ against the Serpent. Wherefore God so moderated his sentence, that he adiudged Christes members in Adam no farder then to the earth, whence Christ should raise them, and vtterly abolish from them all the Serpents poyson, that is, sinne, death, and corruption: but this prooueth not death to be good in Gods Children, or to be no punishment of sinne in them, because God conuerteth it to their aduantage in the ende; no more then their sinnes are good, because God turneth them also to the benefite of his elect. For, as you heard before, Saint Austen saith of their sinnes as he doth of their death, that God turneth them, and all things else to the good of those that loue him. Touching Gods fatherly Anger against the sinnes of the faithfull for their amendment, which Musculus mentioneth; He doth not say as you doe, it is no Anger; neither doe I defend any other kinde of Anger in God then such, as a Religious and wise Father in some sort resembleth, when he persueth the wickednes of his vnruly sonne. Whose person though he fauour as being his Sonne, and by chastisement seeke to reforme; yet is he or ought he to be, not in words or lookes onely, but inwardly and truely displeased and offended with the lewdnesse of his Sonne. And though loue doe temper the correction, that he meane not to kill or ouerthrow his owne flesh and blood; yet the zealous Father spareth not to make his Sonne throughly smart, till he confesse, mislike, and leaue his former loosenesse, and frame himselfe obediently to his Fathers will. Doth not this Father as much hate the vices, as he loueth the person, and seeketh the welfare of his Sonne? And since his Sonne will not be otherwise recalled, may not the sharp correction, which the Father vseth to represse the vnbridled and vntamed appetites of his licentious child, be called punishment? The Scriptures so speake, and so doe the Fathers, as also the later writers; onely this fabler hath found out a new faith, and new phrases of Gods improper wrath, and vntrue punishment of sinne, which God vseth toward his children, that prouoke him with their impuritie and iniquitie.

               It may not be said properly, that (Gods) Iustice leadeth him to inflict these things on vs, (as you affirme) but his holinesse and loue.] Your mouth belike is the measure of proper speeches. If you intend that not onely Iustice, but also Loue did and doth leadGod is iust in punishing his Saints. God to inflict these things on vs, you say the same that I affirme; but if you meane, (as you must, if you will crosse my position,) that Loue without Iustice did and doth lead God to inflict these things on vs, then speake you both absurdly and wickedly. For the Scriptures ascribe Iustice and Iudgement to God in chastening his Church, and punishing the sinnes of his seruants, as well as they doe Loue and holinesse. When the Prophet told Roboham and the Princes of Iuda, that 
               2. Chro. 12. vers. 5. 
               they had left God, and therefore God would leaue them in the hands of Shishak the King of Egypt: the King and Princes Vers. 6. 
               humbled themselues, and said, the Lord is iust. When Ierusalem was burnt and her people caried captiue to Babilon, the Prophet lamenting her miserie saith, the Lord hath 
               Lament. 1. vers. 5. 
               afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: and teacheth her to say; Vers. 1

               Iust is the Lord, for I haue rebelled against his mouth. Daniel at the time, when God would deliuer his people from that Captiuitie, maketh confession of his and their sinnes, and saith; Dan. 9. v. 11. 
               All Israell haue transgressed thy law, and departed from hearkning to thy voice. Therefore the curse is powred vpon vs, because we haue sinned against him. 
               Vers. 14. 
               And the Lord hath watched ouer this euill, and brought it vpon vs, because the Lord our God is iust in all that he doth; for we would not heare his voice. The Leuites after their returne making confession of their sinnes vnto God, & mentioning their afflictions,

            The Apostles confesse the like after Christs comming. Rom. 3. 
               If our iniquitie (saith Paul,) commend the Iustice of God, what shall we say? Is God vniust in punishing? God forbid. Very plainly the same Apostle denounceth Gods iustice and vengeance to all Christians that wrong their brethren; 1. Thess 4. vers. 6. 
               You know (saith he) what Commandements we gaue you by the Lord Iesus, that no man oppresse or defraud his brother: for the Lord is the Auenger of all such things, as we foretold and protested vnto you. And to the Colossians; Coloss. 3. 
               He that doth wrong shall receaue (at Gods hand) for the wrong, which he hath done, and there is no respect of persons. 
               Prou. 12. 
               The recompence of a mans hands (that is works) shall (God) giue vnto him, either in this life if he repent, or in the next if he persist. Prou. 11. 
               Lo (saith Salomon) the righteous are repayed on earth (he meaneth the euill which they haue done to others) how then the wicked and the sinner? For here in this life is the 1. Pet. 4. 
               time, that iudgement beginneth at the house of God. If it first (begin) with vs (saith Peter) what shall be the end of them, who obey not the Gospell of God? Howsoeuer you tattle that God vtterly forgetteth his Iustice in afflicting his Church; the Scriptures teach vs, that Iudgement beginneth here at the house of God, for an example of the iust iudgement of God against the wicked, and that the very righteous are repayed on earth the wrongs which they do to others, God by his Apostle openly professing himselfe to be the Auenger of such beleeuers, as wrong or defraud their brethren. Now whether there may be Iudgement, Requitall, and Reuenge in this life from God against euill, without some admixture of his iustice, though he purpose not to destroy the penitent, I leaue it to the Christian Reader to consider.
            Hath not Christ then borne the burden of our sinnes to free vs from all punishment?How we are freed from sinne by Christ. Christ hath not presently and generally freed vs and euery part of vs from all corruption and affliction of sinne; he will doe it at his appointed time, when the day of our redemption commeth. In the meane time our inward man is freed, though our 2. Cor. 4. 
               outward man dayly perish. For Christ 1. Cor. 15. 
               must raigne till he haue put all his (and our) enemies vnder his feete. The last enemie, that shall be destroyed is death. Then shall be the end of sinne, death, and corruption in all his; and not before: though we be alreadie redeemed by Christ from it, in Gods purpose and promise (which shall then bee fully performed) and in part, whereof we presently haue an assurance in that our soules are renewed in this life by grace, and receiued in the next to a blessed rest and comfort, till that day rise, when Christ will set a crowne of righteousnesse on them all, that loue his comming. Againe we are presently freed from all that, which is solely the punishment of sinne, and hath no farder or other profit or vse in it, then onely to punish and reuenge sinne. And such are none of these things, whereof wee speake. For God in them all hath so tempered a taste of his iustice with his manifold and great mercies, that it is not expedient for vs as yet to be wholly freed from them. This respect preuaileth so farre with God, that whiles the world must dure, hee hath subiected his children to the capitall and penall lawes not of Christian Magistrates onely, but euen of infidels also, for that without discipline of the sword, mans state and life on earth can not be maintained. And therefore the politicke and penall lawes of Princes bee not derogatorie to Christes death, nor iniuries to Christian men, as the Libertines would haue them; not because men haue more right to punish then God hath, or their interest to punish could continue, when Gods doth cease; but for that it is expedient and needfull for vs so to bee gouerned in outward and earthly things, till the time come, when Christ will 
               1 Cor. 15. Vers. 24. 
               put downe all rule and all authoritie and power, that God may be all in all. Now if Christs death repeale not mans lawes, how much lesse Gods irreuocable iudgements fastned to our nature, and not hindering our saluation, but renuing the memoriall of our sinne, lest we should forget it, or neglect it; and teaching vs by tollerable and temporall paines, what intollerable torments wee haue escaped by Gods mercies towards vs? Wherefore Christ by his obedience vnto death

hath shewed vs an example what to follow, and thereby rather confirmed then reuersed his Fathers sentence for the time, till he come to wipe all teares from our eyes, and to restore vs to the glorious libertie of the sonnes of God, which he hath presently purchased for vs, though he will not presently execute it.
            Lastly the death of Christ doeth not belong, nor any benefite thereof, but to such as repent and beleeue. After his death Christ commanded Luk. 24. 
               repentance and remission of sinnes to be preached in his name among all nations; and with all denounced, Mark. 16. 
               He which will not beleeue, shall be damned. So that neither the incredulous, nor the impenitent haue any part or pardon in Christes death and sufferings. If then all the children of God would fully repent and perfectly beleeue: surely all which they should suffer in this life (I still except the naturall, and as yet vnchangeable corruption of body and soule, which abideth in them from their birth) were onely trials of the graces, and signes of their blessednesse. Matth. 5. 
               Blessed are they (saith our Sauiour) that suffer persecution for righteousnesse sake: for theirs is the kingdome of heauen. When you doe well and suffer, taking it
               1. Pet. 2. 
               patiently, this (saith Peter) is acceptable vnto God. But what praise is it, if when yee be buffeted for your faults, you take it patiently? Now how many thousands are there in Christs flocke, which defect in faith and specially in true repentance? Yea how rare are they, that repent when, and as they ought? Then hath Gods iustice cause enough, and enough to punish all, that either shrinke in faith, neglect his will, or slacke repentance; notwithstanding the generall freedome obtained and proclaimed by the death of Christ; and out of this number very few Christians are exempted. Wherefore to make men beleeue, that God hath no iustice, or regardeth not his iustice, to punish them in this life, after hee hath once engraffed them into Christ, because Christ hath suffered all the punishment of their sinnes for them; is but to deceiue them. God is most faithfull in his promises, if we could take assured hold of them; but if wee fall from them by diffidence or disobedience, God wanteth no iustice to aggrauate his hand according to our deserts, though in mercie he spare vs, euen when he striketh vs, and intendeth our conuersion and not our destruction, how sharpe soeuer his plagues be, which would be farre sharper, if his loue towardes vs in Christ Iesu, did not ouer-rule his iust displeasure against our sinnes.

               The case with Christ was cleane otherwise. He needed no amendment, but that which he suffered was right punishment.] Right and proper, if you may be moderator, shall beThe Defenders partition of punishment, applied to Christ, is insufficient and impious. what please you. What is RIGHT AND TRVE PVNISHMENT you neuer define; but pretending sinceritie, when you come to the issue, you enclose your conceites with verie, proper, right, and such like phrases, and so take your leaue. But declare, if you can, or will vouchsafe to make others partakers of your mysteries, what is proper and right, verie and true punishment. You must define punishment either by the paine, which is suffered; or by the purpose of the punisher, that is, by the cause, for which it is inflicted. You stand not in this place on the paine imposed, but rather on the purpose of the punisher, or cause of the punishment. For if you measure punishment by the same paines, then tell vs why the miseries of this life, as penurie, sicknesse, and death, be punishments in the wicked, and not in the godly; since they be the same in both, setting aside the purpose of the punisher, which is different in both. They are, you say, for correction and amendment in the godly, not for destruction and vengeance, as they are in the wicked. Then the purpose of the punisher, by your intention, maketh the paine to be punishment; which being referred to another end, as in other patients, is no punishment, though it be the selfe same paine in both. And thence you draw your conclusion, that since the sufferings of Christ could not be for correction and amendment in him, therefore Defenc. pag. 52. l. 1. 
               his afflictions euery one, SMALL AND GREAT, were true and proper punishments, and the effects of Gods very wrath for sinne lying vpon him. Otherwise the bodily afflictions which Christ suffered were the selfe same which the godly often suffer; and yet you auouch them in the faithfull to be no punishments, because they serue for correction and amendment in them; which

hauing no place in Christ, you conclude his sufferings great and small to be true, right and proper punishments. But Sir how prooue you this diuision, that all the punishments, (you call them paines) which God inflicteth in this life, are either for correction or for vengeance properly so called? there is neither sufficiencie, nor pietie in this partition of yours thus applied to Christ. For in the wicked Gods purpose is onely to reuenge sinne, and therefore in the end God allotteth them the iust and full punishment of sinne, which is euerlasting damnation. And in the meane season during the time of his patience, he mitigateth his hand in respect of that which shall follow, but giueth them no inward grace to repent, whereby they are in all their afflictions hardned and ripened for sorer vengeance, as still repining and murmuring at the hand of God but neuer misliking or leauing their sinnes. In the elect when they are disobedient and impenitent, God persueth their sinnes with corporall and temporall plagues, that they may returne and flie vnto him for mercie; to which ende he giueth them grace in the midst of their miseries to acknowledge their offences, and by faith to take hold of his promises made to them in Christ Iesus; and so vpon their submission and conuersion he receiueth them to fauour; whose persons he alwayes loued in his onely Sonne, though he hated and scourged their vncleannesse. In Christ Iesus the case was cleane different from the one and the other. You confesse there was nothing in him to be corrected or amended; then was he not punished for correction. On the other side, much lesse did God purpose to destroy Christs person being his owne and onely Sonne; as he doth the wicked, whose bodies and soules he will destroy in hell: and consequently Christ was not punished to destruction. That is proper to the reprobate, whose persons God hateth, and leaueth in their sinnes, that they may prouoke his iust wrath to their vtter destruction. Then was Christ neither punished as the godly are for amendment, nor as the wicked are for vengeance; and so your partition is false, and defectiue; and all your collections grounded thereon are like the foundation, that is voide of all strength and trueth.
            What then was Gods purpose in punishing Christ for our sinnes? euen that whichGods purpose in the death and Crosse of Christ. you alwayes passe by with deafe and dull eares, though it be often repeated and vrged vnto you, because you will not be turned from the trade of your hellish paines. Why God would not haue man redeemed, but by the death and passion (that I call the punishment) of Christ Iesus, the Scriptures yeeld many causes, (though of Gods will no cause may be required;) some respecting God himselfe, some concerning Christ, and some regarding vs. Touching God, the crosse of Christ doth commend his wisdome, shew his power, manifest his loue, content his holines, & preserue his iustice. 
               1. Corin. 1. 
               Christ crucisied (as Paul sayth) is the power of God, and the wisdome of God to them that are saued, howsoeuer the crosse of Christ seeme foolishnesse and weakenesse to them that perish. Then to controle the carnall wisdome of the world, and to confound the pride and strength of Satan and his members, God would vse the basenesse and feeblenesse of the Crosse in sauing his elect. Also, to witnesse his loue towards vs, he decreed the same: Iohn 3. 
               So God loued the world, that he gaue his onely begotten Sonne, 
               Ephes. 5. 
               to be an offering and a sacrifice of a sweet smelling sauour vnto God. With which Sacrifice the holinesse of God resteth so 2. Pet. 1. well pleased, that he accepteth vs as holy, and Hebr. 10. 
               sanctified by the oblation of the bodie of Iesus Christ once made. The vpholding of Gods Iustice by the death of Christ is often specified in the Scriptures. 1. Corin. 15. 
               By a man (came) death, and by a man the resurrection from the dead. 
               2. Corin. 5. 
               Him that knew no sinne, God made sinne for vs (to wit, a sacrifice for sinne) that wee should be made the righteousnesse of God in him. Therefore it was 
               Iohn 11. 
               expedient, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole Nation perished not. 
               Esa. 53. 
               He was wounded for our transgressions; and by his stripes are wee healed. The Lord layed vpon him the iniquitie of vs all. 
               Hebr. 9. 
               And where a Testament is, there must be the death of the Testator: for a Testament is confirmed, when men are dead. So that by the Scriptures themselues God decreed the Crosse of Christ in mans redemption, to reueale his wisdome, power, and loue to the world, and wholly to satisfie his holinesse
               
and iustice, which were thorowly displeased and prouoked with mans disobedience, but as thorowly recompensed and appeased by the submission and obedience of Christ.
            As for Christ himselfe, it is euident by the Scriptures, that his enduring the crosse declared his obedience, patience, humilitie, charitie, perfection and power, in more effectuall maner, than without it he could haue done. For therein he Phil. 2. 
               emptied and humbled himselfe, and became obedient vnto death, euen to the death of the crosse. 
               1. Pet. 2. 
               When hee was reuiled, he reuiled not againe; when he suffered, he threatned not. He 
               Esa. 53. 
               was oppressed and afflicted, yet did he not open his mouth. For so Galat. 2. 
               he loued (vs) that he gaue himselfe (for vs;) Iohn 15. 
               and greater loue than this hath no man, to bestow his life for his friends. But Rom. 5. 
               God setteth out his loue towards vs, that whiles we were yet sinners Christ died for vs. Once (then) 1. Pet. 3. 
               he suffered, the iust for the vniust, that he might bring vs to God; and being Hebr. 2. 
               consummate through affliction, was made the Prince of (our) Saluation. For in that he suffered and was tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted, and became a mercifull and faithfull high Priest, to make reconciliation for the sinnes of the people. And 
               Rom. 14. 
               therefore he died and rose againe, that he might be Lord of the dead and the liuing, and 
               Hebr. 2. 
               through death destroy him that had power of death, euen the diuell.
            
            On our behalfe it was not needlesse, that Christ should die the death of the crosse. For besides that we are 
               1 Cor. 6. 
               bought with a price, lest we should be our owne, euen with the 
               1. Pet. 1. 
               precious bloud of Christ, as of a Lambe vnspotted and vndefiled, and 
               Rom. 5. 
               reconciled to God by the death of his Sonne, which couenant is irreuocable, being sealed with his bloud: by his crosse Christ 1. Pet. 2. 
               left vs an example how we should follow his steps, and be 
               1. Pet. 4. 
               partakers of his sufferings; that when his glorie shall appeare, we may be glad and reioyce. For it is a 
               2. Tim. 2. 
               true saying, if we be dead with him, we shall liue with him; if we suffer (with him) we shall raigne with him. 
               Rom. 6. 
               We are buried then by Baptisme into his death, that like as Christ was raised from the dead by the glorie of his Father; so we should also walke in newnesse of life: knowing this, that our olde man is crucified with him, that the bodie of sinne might be destroyed, that hencefoorth we should not serue sinne. 
               2. Cor. 5. 
               He died for all, that they which liue should not hencefoorth liue vnto themselues, but to him, which died for them, and rose againe.
            
            Infinite are the places of Scripture witnessing the causes, effects, and fruits of Christs death on the Crosse; all which this Dreamer must denie or delude, before he can defend, that Gods purpose in Christes sufferings was only to punish our sinne lying on him. For if Gods purposes in appointing Christes Crosse, were so acceptable to the Father, so honourable to the Sonne, and so profitable for man, as the Scriptures mention; with what face can it be said, that God punished his Sonne only for vengeance? or that whatsoeuer Christ suffered (all his life long) specially at his death, was 
               Defenc. pag. 51. l. 4. 
               verie wrath and vengeance from God properly taken? Christ suffered the same things here on earth, which the godly likewise do in this life, as appeareth by the history of his death and passion; and other paines or deaths in Christ the Scriptures doe not specifie. Gods counsell in decreeing the Crosse of Christ for mans redemption, considering the true desert of our sinne and terrible vengeance prouided for others, was varie fauourable and fatherly, not ouerpressing the patience of Christes humane nature, nor wearying his obedience; and had in it farre more gracious and glorious intents and euents, than our afflictions can or ought any way to match or approch. If then Gods fauour to his elect make their sufferings in this life no wrath, nor vengeance, nor so much as punishments; why should the exceeding loue and admirable honor wherewith God accepted and aduanced the death of his Sonne for mans saluation, seeme to any sober man verie wrath, true vengeance, or the proper punishment of sinne prouided and reserued for reprobate men and angels?
            It was not for correction, you say.] What then? ergo for vengeance? Who being in his right wits would so reason? God afflicteth his Saints often times for probation, for perfection, for coronation, as the Scriptures auouch, and not for correction. May a man thence conclude by your Logick, that these afflictions of the Godly are

true punishment and proper vengeance? Your selfe most withstand it. Why then since Christes afflictions had in them a cleere illustration of Gods wisdome, power, and loue towards man, somewhat blemished and obscured in mans fall by Satans craft, and a full recompence to his holinesse and iustice, neglected and irritated by mans vnrighteousnesse, besides the obedience, sufficience, and preualence of his Sonne thereby declared; why should, I say, those afflictions of Christ great and small, during his life and at his death, seeme to any man that is well aduised, the true wrath, proper vengeance and right punishment that was prepared for sinners? Yea since the proper vengeance and right punishment of sinne must be common to sinfull men with the sinfull Angels, in as much as they both sinned, and shall both receaue the due wages of sinne; how can the corporall afflictions of this life, wherein the diuels can not partake with men, be called the proper vengeance and right punishment of sinne? And who but you, hearing our Sauiour pronounce that euerlasting fire is the full payment and proper punishment of wicked and accursed men and Angels, would labour with such loose and lewd collections to bring Christ Iesus within the compasse of the full punishment and proper vengeance due to sinne? Wherefore take backe your riotous and irreligious termes: As they are not prooued by any Scripture, so are they not to be suffered in Christian Religion, because they are but cloudes to cloke the fantasticall frame of your new hell. In the sharpnesse of the punishment exacted by God on the manhood of his owne Sonne for our sinnes, though farre different from that which the wicked doe and shall feele, and which the Scriptures call the wrath to come; (wherein the diuels shall haue their portion, euen in the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone,) God would haue vs learne, how much he detesteth our sinnes; how easie all the plagues, which we suffer in this life, are in respect of that we deserue; how infinite the loue and mercy of God was towards vs, to lay the burden, which we could not haue borne, on the shoulders of his onely Sonne, who for his dignitie, innocencie, and euery way sufficiencie was able to quench that wrath, that euerlastingly and intolerably would haue burnt against vs to our finall and perpetuall destruction of body and soule. For if Gods owne Sonne, though he did recompence our sinnes with his infinite humilitie, obedience, and sanctitie, was yet pursued vnto death in most painefull and reprochfull manner for our sakes, before we could be quited from the guilt and load of our sinnes; had we appeared in the iust iudgement of God to receaue the reward of our manifold iniquities, what could haue beene the end thereof but a most dreadfull damnation of body and soule to hell fire for euer with the desperate and damned spirits? This God would haue vs obserue in the death of his Sonne, though there be many other points of Gods wisedome, power, and loue towards Christ himselfe, which the Scriptures inclose in the Crosse of Christ.

                  sse of Christ. of Christ, I doe not deny, speaking of wrath after the manner of the Sacred Scriptures. But that any wrath or vengeance proper to the wicked was therein offered or executed on Christ, or that he suffered the iust and full punishment allotted to others for sinne, (Saue that his sufferings were in his person the full price of our Redemption, I meane a most sufficient satisfaction and recompence for all the sinnes of the world) I find no mention made thereof in all the Scriptures, nor see any iust cause or proofe thereof alleaged by you in all your writings. For since you will not endure, that any thing executed on the godly shall be truely called wrath; it is euident that the wrath which you imagine Christ suffered, must be proper to the wicked, before it can be rightly called wrath; because the godly feele no part of Gods wrath, litle nor great, as you suppose. Now that Christ suffered the wrath of God prouided for the sinnes of the wicked only; and no way common to the godly; this is both a false, and a wicked proposition of yours, & though you euery where vrge it, you no where prooue it, but boldly, as your fashion is, affirming it, you thinke the world bound to embrace it.
            I find by the Scriptures that the wrath which Christ suffered in Soule and Body,

differed from that which is proper to the wicked as well in the Nature and measure of the paines, as in the purpose of the punisher, and inward peace of the sufferer, and in all the consequents of the paines themselues. In this world the wicked find subtraction of all grace and fauour, confusion and desperation; in the world to come exclusion from glorie, Malediction, and damnation wholy and euerlastingly light on them; none of which may be transferred to Christ without intolerable blasphemie. Yet paine you thinke Christ suffered, and more then paine the wicked and damned doe not suffer.] Were that true which is most false, that the damned suffer no more then pain, though indeed in hell cuery thing doth paine them, yet all paines are not of the same nature and kind; and no paines felt in this life come neere the paines of hell whereof this mortall life and flesh is not capable. The paine of fire we see doth presently cut of this life, and some diseases so much heate the body, that they doe the like; and yet the paine and force of this naturall fire, or of any sicknesse is nothing comparable to the fury of hell fire, for which the bodies of the wicked must be made immortall, before they can endure it. All aches and agues doe paine the body, all feares and sorrowes afflict the soule and spirit of man. Shall we thence conclude, that all men at all times, when they are pained or grieued, suffer the paines of hell, because it is paine which the damned doe suffer? It is more then prophane abusing and deluding the terrible iudgements of God against sinne to suppose, that all paines of body and soule are hell paines in nature and kind, which you wrap vnder the fold of proper wrath and right punishment of sinne, because they are paines. Wherefore they must either be the selfe same paines, that God in his iust and fierce wrath inflicted on the damned; or you shall neuer inferre by phrases of your owne making, which only serue to hide your owne meaning, that Christ suffered the paines of hell.
            As for Gods wrath against sinne, it hath many degrees and parts by the verdict ofGods wrath against sinne hath many degrees and parts. holy Scripture, though you will not heare thereof. For as Gods blessings & benefits, when he first made man, were of his heauenly goodnes richly prouided for man, and plentifully powred on the body and soule of man; as well for the leading of this life in plenty, safety, and delight, as for the surer attaining of euerlasting ioy and blisse in an other place: so when man by sinne fell from God, by iustice God depriued him and his of all those earthly and bodily fauours and comforts no lesse then of the spirituall and inward gifts and graces of the mind; by that meanes making way to his euerlasting and dreadfull Iudgements against sinne. Now if these externall things bestowed on man in his first creation, were iustly called, and must be confessed in their kind, to be the blessings and fauours of God afforded to all mankind, when he made man and the whole world for his vse; then out of question the taking them away from man, and subiecting him by iustice to the contrary for sinne committed, may as truly be named, and must be beleeued, to be the signes and effects of Gods displeasure against sinne, which the Scripture nameth wrath. And so God calleth either of them when heDeut. 28. promiseth the one to the obseruers of his Law, andDeut. 28. threatneth the other to the breakers thereof; who vseth not to promise or threaten words but deeds. Neither hath it any reason because the reiecting of man from the greater and higher blessings of inward grace and eternall blisse was farre the sorer and sharper punishment of mans sinne, that therefore the withdrawing of these should be no degree nor effect of Gods wrath against sinne; no more then the losse of a legge or an arme should be counted no mayme, because a man hath an head and an hart, which are more principall parts of his body. Wherefore though in comparison they may be iustly diminished, and abased farre beneath the worthinesse of the rest of Gods blessings, which are reserued for his Children in an other life; yet can they not be denyed to be Gods blessings euen in this life: and if to giue them to man, when he was first made, were the fauour and bountie of God towards man, which no Christian may deny; to take them from man for sinne, must truely argue Gods displeasure against sinne, not in improper speech, as you gloze, but in a lesse degree then those, which bring with them perpetuall subuersion of Body and Soule.
            
            And when the Scriptures meane to expresse the spirituall and eternall wrath of God, they doe it not by proprietie of words as you pretend; but by different circumstances: either of the TIME after this life, when no wrath is executed but that which is euerlasting; as Christ 
               1. Thess. 1. 
               deliuereth vs from the wrath to come; and thou 
               Rom. 2. 
               heapest vp wrath against the day of wrath, which is the day of iudgement; or of the PERSONS, who are wicked, and the 
               Rom. 9. 
               vessels of wrath prepared to destruction, and for whom is reserued the mist of darknesse for euer; as, Ephes. 5. 
               for such things commeth the wrath of God on the Children of vnbeliefe; or of the CONTINVANCE which neuer ceaseth, as Iohn 3. 
               the wrath of God abideth on him that beleeueth not; or of the HIGTH thereof when it is full, as 1. Thess. 2. 
               the wrath of God is come vpon them to the vttermost: or of the CONTRARY when it is eternall life; as, 1. Thess. 5. 
               God hath not appointed vs vnto wrath, but to obtaine Saluation by Iesus Christ: or of the CONSEQVENTS which are suddaine destruction and such like; as, Psal. 2. 
               kisse the Sonne, least he be angry, and ye perish in the way; when his wrath shall suddenly burne, blessed are they that trust in him. By these and such like particulars we may perceiue, when the Scriptures speake of the one wrath, and when of the other; but otherwise the wordes are common to both, as also the cause which is sinne. O Lord, saith Moses, Exod. 32.
               why doth thy wrath waxe hote against thy people? turne from thy fierce wrath and desist from this euill towards thy People. And againe, Deut. 9. 
               I fell downe (saith he) fortie daies and fortie nights before the Lord, because of all your sinnes, which yee had sinned, doing wickedly in the sight of the Lord and prouoking him. For I was afraid of the wrath and indignation, wherewith the Lord was kindled against you to destroy you, and the Lord heard me at that time also. Exceeding many are the places, which teach vs, that our iniquities auert the outward blessing, of this life, and that our sinnes Iere. 5. 
               hinder good things from vs; Though God after that, comfort his people, when their 
               Esa. 40. 
               warrefare is accomplished, and they haue receaued sufficient Correction at the hands of God for all their sinnes. Surely these warnings of the holy Ghost are not empty words or improper speeches; but effectuall and faithfull instructions for the Church of God; to learne them, that God doth visite their sinnes, when they forget to repent and obey; though he spare them in comparison of that wrath, which is effunded on the wicked. And therefore the name of wrath is rightly and truely applyed in the Scriptures, euen to those afflictions wherewith God scourgeth his owne Children for their negligence and impenitence, though God haue an other and greater, which is eternall wrath, laid vp in store for the Reprobate, who die without Repentance and Remission of their sinnes.
            Howsoeuer the strife for words standeth, wherein I confesse I may not be brought to disalow the tongue and pen of the holy Ghost; it is most certaine, that the Gospel reporteth of Christs sufferings nothing, but what was common to him with his members, euen in this life where he suffered. The Apostles plainely prooue as much, to wit that we haue Philip. 3.

               communion with Christs afflictions, and are 1. Pet. 4. 
               conformed to his death. Now there is no communion, but where the same things are common to both, though the degrees may differ. And you your selfe, when it maketh for you, can vrge, that the Apostle speaking of Christs sufferings, saith; Hebr. 4. 
               He was tempted in all things like (to vs) yet without sinne. So that in my iudgement it is a most cleere case, as well by the witnesse of Scripture, as by your owne confession; that all Christes sufferings were LIKE, yea the SAME that ours are, as being common to both; and consequently if you any way vnderstand what belongeth to trueth or reason, the sufferings of the godly must either bee wrath as well as Christes, or if their bee not, his were not, since they were the same. And so the godly must either in all their afflictions, small and great, suffer as Christ did the proper wrath of God, and true paines of hell, which you make equiualent: or if the godly doe not so suffer, then Christ did not so suffer. If you flie to the purpose of the punisher, which was different in Christ and his members, and thinke there to succour your selfe, you come to short: the purpose of God in Christes afflictions, as I haue shewed by the Scriptures, was farre more fauourable and honourable in Christ, then it can bee to any of the elect. And therefore

Gods purpose in Christes punishment will far der free him from hell paines, then it will any of the faithfull.
            The proportion of the pain which Christ suffered, & the inward peace of the sufferer, will proue the same. For where the paines of hell exceed the patience of men and Angels, and are no way possible to bee suffered in the weaknesse of our mortall bodies; the measure of Christes paine was so proportioned to the strength of his flesh, that it neither ouerwhelmed his life, nor his patience. And though his sweate were like bloud in his earnest prayer and Agonie, yet no Scripture decideth, whether that were for paine, feare, or zeale; and that dured but a while in the Garden, where as after, when his afflictions and paines were at sorest, he shewed no signe of shrinking either at the torments of his body, or at the affliction of his minde; but as the Apostle saith, Hebr. 12. 
               For the ioy set before him, endured the Crosse, and despised the shame; not wearied nor fainting in minde, but with most perfect obedience, and quiet patience persisting to the ende. This conflict betweene paine and patience, to serue Gods glorie and obey Gods will, Christ proposeth to all his members on the same condition that it was offered to his humane nature. Reuel. 3. 
               To him that ouercommeth (saith he) will I giue to sit with me in my throne, euen as I ouercame, and

            As for the consequents of hell paines, it is so brutish blasphemie to affirme them of Christ, that I forbeare to obiect them. I haue often named them, and you say, you

                   doe, that Christ so suffered hell paines.] But Sir, you & your friends must shew by the Scriptures that God hath seuered these consequents I meane, reiection, reprobation, confusion, malediction diction, desperation, and such like, from the true paines of hell. The Scripture proposeth them as necessarie and infallible consequents to the true paines of hell: You will seuer them, because otherwise Christ must either not suffer the true paines of hell, which euerteth all your new Doctrine; or he must also suffer these, which the Scriptures annexe to the true paines of hell. If you confesse the first, that Christ did not suffer the true paines of hell; the Question is well ended: If you seuer these consequents from the true paines of hell, shew by what authoritie of sacred Scriptures you doe it; and then you may be excused from lewd and wicked presumption. For if God by his word reuealed hath ioyned them together, you doe or should know what sacriledge it is for your pleasure to pull them in sunder. Let your Reader therefore iudge, whether you can be quited from the one, except you shew good warrant for the other; which as yet you neither haue done, nor offered to doe.

So that we see hereby how vainely you say; out of this proposition, Christ suffered for vs the wrath of God for sinne, I shall neuer conclude, ergo he suffered the true paines of hell. I haue here shewed you I trust that this followeth well, seeing the wrath of God, which Christ fel

                   in his spirit, was his right and proper wrath, albeit he suffered not all, nor the whole wrath of God, nor euery part thereof, iust as the damned doe.] Here you see your full purpose is to conclude, that Christ suffred for vs the true paines of hell, though it hath beene your policie to conceale so much from the Reader all this while. And indeede howsoeuer you dissemble it, because you can no way prooueit, The death of Christes soule, and the true paines of hell or of the Damned are the maine markes which you shoote at; though you closely carie it in other termes, which are more generall and ambiguous, as the wrath of God, and the punishment of sinne, to keepe your Reader from discouering your foolish reasons, and reiecting your wicked deuices. But cough vp your conceites freely, and wander not thus about a wood of words, to shew your contentious spirit, or at least to hide your hatefull mysteries. Here you haue shewed, you trust, that it followeth well, seeing the wrath, that Christ felt in his spirit, was right and proper wrath.] You haue shewed vs what you intend; but neither here, nor else where doe you shew by what grounds of reason, and trueth you can inferre it. Christ suffered proper wrath and that in spirit, you say.] You neuer went about to define or describe what proper wrath is; much lesse haue you any way prooued that, which

Christ suffered, to be proper wrath. And now on the sudden you bend vp your bristles, and boast you haue shewed, that Christ suffered the true paines of hell. But by what Scriptures I pray you haue you shewed it, or by what Fathers? Or if you haue neither of those to deriue your doctrine from; what groundes of reason haue you produced for it? You haue roued ignorantly, confusedly, and absurdly at the sufferings of mans soule; you haue filled our eares with certaine new phrases of proper, verie, and right wrath and vengeance for sinne; but first and last you haue proued nothing; nay I see not so much as any offer of proofe, but a bolde proiect of trifles and termes to support your errors.
            But I grant expresly, that the wrath of God is hell.] Hauing shewed by sundrie Fathers the verie page before, that the wrath of God is often taken for the effects thereof, and so for any punishment which God inflicteth for sinne; I granted that hell and Conclus. pa. 247. li. 20. & 21.

What conclude you thence? ergo euerie effect or degree of Gods wrath is hell. If you clamper vs such conclusions, you are fitter to ring a bell, than to write a booke. What shew of reason hath this illation of yours? The wrath of God is applied to all the paines and punishments of sinne, and so by consequent to hell, as to the greatest vengeance that God taketh of men or diuels for sinne. Will you hence inferre, hell is the greatest punishment of sinne, ergo hell is all the punishment that God inflicteth for sinne, or whatsoeuer God inflicteth for sinne, is hell? By this Logike, a rotten tooth, a gowtie toe, a broken head, or a lame legge, are the true paines of hell, and all men liuing and dying are in the paines of hell. But you will create vs a new compasse of hell, that shall containe all that the wicked doe suffer in this life or elsewhere, be it neuer so little.] If you will fall to creating of new helles, shew your commission; otherwise you may create your selfe a woorse condition than you are ware of. Thinke you that any wise or godlie Reader will rest himselfe vpon such inuentions or such conclusions as these be?

For Christes paines may be great and intolerable to vs, though nothing neere the paines of hell. But if you take infinite, as contrarie to finite, which you do in this place by opposing it to finite, then infinite indeed is more than hell: for the paines of hell are finite in degree, though infinite in hauing no end. Howbeit, in the meane while you wrong the Godhead of Christ, in whom nothing is infinite, besides his Diuine Nature, and the force thereof. So that if Christ did suffer paines truely infinite, his Godhead must suffer, which is infinite blasphemie; by reason his manhood being a creature could not, nor might not suffer but that which was finite, both in waight and end. Such speculations you broach out of your owne brest, without any likelihood of trueth or concurrence with the sacred Scriptures; and then you aske Who can limit or measure

Such desperate vntrueths well become your sobrietie, who will say any thing, so you may haue some shift of words to shrowd your selfe vnder: but the

Scriptures will teach you, that Christes sufferings were of infinite price in respect of the person who was God and man, not of infinite paine which exceedeth the power and strength of all creatures.
            I aske, do you grant, that Christ suffered Gods wrath in spirit, as the Apostle (1. Thess. 5.) distinguisheth the spirit and the soule?] I answere, do you heare, that you grosly mistake the Apostle, if you make the soule and the spirit two seuerall substances in man? otherwise if they be but one, your question is very childish. For the immortall substance of mans soule suffereth, whether it be by her sense, affections, vnderstanding, or will. And this is no Sophistrie deceiuing you with the word soule; but it is the recalling you to conceiue rightly of the soule of man, which is an immortall and spirituall substance, subiect to paine as well by her vnderstanding and sense, as by her affections and will; and by what other meanes soeuer it pleaseth God to punish her. As for the wrath, which you would haue suffered in Christs spirit, when you tell vs what you meane by wrath, whether the apprehension of Gods wrath against our sinne, or the absolute impression of paine from the immediate hand of God; or the due consideration of the case wherein Christ stood, when he suffered for our sinnes, which might iustly breed feare, care and sorrow in his soule, besides the affliction of bodily paines and anguish, which his immortall and humane spirit must needs discerne and feele; you shall receiue a fuller answere. Till then holde vs excused, if we spend not time to guesse & grope after your blinde and hid fansies. Howbeit, whatsoeuer Christ suffered in his soule, it was religious and meritorious in him, I meane euen the feare, sorow and smart, which hee humbly, obediently, and patiently suffered, as from the hand of God, whosoeuer were the meanes: and other wrath than that, you shall neuer be able to proue was inflicted on Christs spirit or soule.

               Who can say, but that this was as hot and scorching as hell fire it selfe?] We see then your forwardnesse to haue it so; but withall your foolishnesse, that daunting all others as vnpriuie to Gods secrets, and Christes sufferings, you only take vpon you to tell vs out of your casting boxe, how great and how hot the paine was, which Christ suffered in soule; euen as great and as hot as hell fire it selfe. What dreames be these to mocke men withall, and to fraight the Christian faith with? As if you had of late receiued some Reuelation from heauen, that Christes paine was full as hot as hell fire. I will not diminish the paines which the Sonne of God suffered for our sakes; but am well content to aggrauate them to the highest, so farre as the Scriptures giue me any light or leading; but you that extenuate his paines described in the Scriptures, and deuise other paines for him as hot as hell fire, no where testified by the Holy Ghost, what defence can you bring for your doings? (Who can say no?) Nay who can say yea, that doth not rush headlong into Gods secret counsels, as you doe? Be these the proofes whereon you pinne the paines of hell suffered in Christes soule? Who can say they were not as hot and scorching as hell fire it selfe?] Frie in your follie, I wish you no worse fire; if I knew not your vaine, I should thinke you sicker than you are.
            I haue no doubt but Christes paine on the Crosse was proportioned to his patience; which God meant to proue, though not to ouerpresse: otherwise the measure of his paine, saue that it exceeded not the strength of his manhood, as I do not know, no more doeth any man liuing, except hee will deceiue himselfe with his owne dreames, as this Discourser doth. For though we may by nature, in some sort, coniecture how grieuous it was for Christ to hang three houres by the woundes of his hands and feet, all his bones being vnioynted; yet know we not how farre the power and iustice of God made way to that paine, who can by any meanes, as well as without all meanes, increase paine to what degree he will. For my part therefore I will not meddle with any certaine measure of Christes paines felt in his bodie or soule, by which his soule might easily be afflicted as farre as his humane strength could stretch: but the matching and euening of it with hell fire, I take to be a presumptuous and irreligious deuice of this Dreamer, for the reasons which I haue formerly shewed; to wit, that hell paines are not executed in this life, where Christ suffered; nor sufferable

to the bodie, which is mortall; nor tolerable to the strength of men or angels. Now though the gifts and graces of Gods Spirit in the soule of Christ exceeded the measure of angels, as well for himselfe who is Lord and Iudge ouer all, as for vs that receiue of his fulnesse; yet in his crucifying, the Scriptures note his infirmitie, not his infinitie, and auouch him by the suffering of death, to be inferiour to the angels, and not in strength of flesh to be superiour vnto them, who are not able to endure hell paines with patience, as we finde by triall in diuels. Wherefore assure thy selfe Christian Reader they are more than follies, which this man fableth of Christes paines equall and euen to hell fire it selfe; and such is his constancie in his new Diuinitie, that sometimes Christ suffered the verie paines of hell themselues, and the same which the damned doe; sometimes Christes paine was equall to it, and as hot as hell fire, and so not the verie same that the damned do suffer, who feele indeed the true force of hell fire, though not in that heat and heigth, which they shall feele it, at and after the day of iudgement.

               It is most necessarie and most comfortable to be vnderstood of all men, how the Lord assigned to his Sonne in the worke of redemption two persons as it were, or countenances or conditions. His owne naturally, which God euer deerely loued, and our countenance or person or condition, which the Lord truely accursed and punished. His owne Nature felt the sorrow and paine of the curse and hatred: but the hatred and curse was bent against the load of our sinne, wherein he stood foorth as guiltie before God, and appeared as it were clothed therewith.] The taking of our Nature, person, and cause by the Sonne of God for our saluation, is a key of Christian pietie that most concerneth, and most profiteth vs, if it be rightly vnderstood. But as Waspes out of sweete flowres gather sharpe and hote liquors; so out of the wholsome mysteries of true religion, you labour to encrease the tartnesse of your vnholsome humour. The eternall and true Sonne of God, by the determinate counsell of his Father, tooke our humane nature (that is, both the bodie and soule of man) into one and the same person with his diuine glorie; that by the sanctitie, power, and dignitie of the one, the basenesse and weakenesse of the other might with more certaintie, securitie, and facilitie, performe the worke of our redemption. For by the neere and inseparable knitting of those two natures together, not onely the person was able by his owne power to destroy sinne, death, and Satan; and of his owne right to giue the spirit of trueth and grace, and euerlasting righteousnesse and happinesse to all that beleeue in him, but his birth, life, and death; that is, his humilitie, obedience, and patience were of infinite price and value with God, by reason the same person that so humbled himselfe to obey the will, and suffer the hand of his Father, was also God; though he could not suffer in his diuine, but onely in his humane nature. And to assure vs of his mercies towards vs by making vs partakers of his graces and merits with him; he tooke all his elect into one and the same bodie with him, ioyning himselfe vnto them by the power of his spirit, as the head to the members, that from him they might draw the strength, hope, and ioy of eternall life; and all his meritorious passions, and victorious actions be fully theirs, as performed in their names and to their vses, by him that for their sakes became their like and their leader, I meane their head and their Sauiour.
            And because sinne was the thing which seuered vs from Gods holinesse, and prouoked his iustice against vs, subiecting vs to death and damnation; Christ therefore tooke vpon him the recompence of his Fathers holines by his obedience, & the preseruance of his Fathers iustice by his patience; admitting into his humane soule and bodie, not the infection or pollution of our sinne, much lesse the confusion or destruction due to vs for sinne, (since he could neither be defiled with our sinne, nor damned for our sinne;) but the purgation and satisfaction of our sinnes. To which end, by his obedience he abolished our disobedience; that Roman. 5. 
               as by one mans disobedience (which was Adam) many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one (which is Christ) manie (should) be made righteous; and

               bearing our finnes in his bodie on the tree, that we might be healed by his stripes, We then were in our selues defiled, hated, accursed, reiected and condemned for sinne; yet Christ our Redeemer and Sauiour tooke vs into himselfe, and our cause vpon himselfe, not to partake with vs in our spirituall filthinesse, and eternall wretchednesse, but to clense vs from the one, and to free vs from the other. So that we did neither defile, nor endanger him; But 1. Iohn

            You speake then not onely without booke, but without trueth, when you say, that Christ was euer deerely loued of God for his owne condition; yet in or for our condition he was truely accursed and hated. You might with as much faith and religion haue said, That Christ by or with our condition was truely polluted with sinne, and truely reiected, confounded, and damned for sinne. For so were we, and if his taking our cause vpon him doe truely and necessarily subiect him to our deserts and dangers, then can none of these things be auoided, which you so much abhorre as blasphemies. All those things were due to vs in the highest degree, euen when Christ tooke vs and our cause vnto him; and were not released vnto vs, but in Christ and for Christ; and consequently if your two countenances and conditions in Christ be such as you make, you may aswell affirme the last as the first, that is as well pollution of sinne, and damnation for sinne, as malediction and hatred for sinne. But who is so foolish amongst men, as to thinke or call him a Theefe and a Felon, that vpon repentance of the partie, and recompense for the fact, intreateth and obteineth pardon for one that was a Theefe and a Felon? or so childish to say, that none can ransome a Prisoner condemned to death, but by suffering the same death which the other should haue done? How come you then to conclude of Christ, because it pleased him to be our Mediatour and Redeemer, that therefore he was guiltie of our sinne, or liable to the same death of bodie and soule, which otherwise we should haue suffered? A ransome he payd for vs of farre more value than we were woorth, which was his obedience vnto death, and the shedding of his precious bloud for vs. But he neither owed nor payed the destruction or damnation of himselfe, who neither by his person could, nor by his office needed to suffer any such thing. He came 
               Iohn 6. 
               to giue his flesh for the life of the world; and 
               Ioh. 10. 
               to lay downe his life for his sheepe, that his death might be a ransome for vs, and for our transgressions. Farder or other ransome than this, the Scripture mentioneth none, and therefore God required none, who by his will reuealed hath thorowly expressed what recompense for vs best contented both his holinesse and iustice.
            
               Could not Christ stand euer blessed and beloued in his owne Nature and yet be truly accursed and hated in our condition and person?] In the wicked God hateth and accurseth their persons for their sinnes, because their iniquities are neither ransomed, nor repented, and so not pardoned: but in Christ and his members it was and is farre otherwise. God still hateth and abhorreth the sinnes as well of the faithfull, as of the wicked; but because he loueth the persons of his elect whom he hath adopted in Christ his Sonne, therefore he destroyeth their sinnes in them by repentance, and remission thereof for Christes sake, and saueth their persons, whom he can not be sayd to hate; though he truely hate their sinnes, by reason that loue and hatred in God can not be permixed or varied, as they are in men. For Gods loue is perfect and constant, as likewise his hatred; and for that cause either in him is perpetuall without ceasing or altering. If Gods loue to men for Christes sake be so setled, that it can not be remoued, nor transferred to the contrarie, how much more then was the naturall and eternall loue of God towards the person of his Sonne, so fixed, and feruent iu the highest degree, that for no cause, and in no condition he could be truely hated or accursed of God? The partaking with vs in penurie, sorrow, shame and death; which first came in as signes and effects of Gods iust displeasure against sinne, and curse vpon sinne; made him the more blessed, and beloued of God; since the voluntarie submitting himselfe to these things in his humane nature, taught vs obedience and patience vnder

the mightie hand of God; and how rightly to distinguish, and willingly to want temporall and earthly blessings, that we may be partakers of eternall and heauenly.
            It is no consequent therefore in vs, that we are truely accursed or hated of God, because we are often depriued of his earthly blessings, and so subiected to his temporall and externall curses; for that we enioy by faith and hope, greater and perfecter blessings; which being in honor, comfort, and vse, farre aboue the other, make vs blessed; and so remaining blessed for possessing the better, we can not be accursed for wanting the smaller; which indeed doe not truely make men blessed or cursed, since the lacke of them doth not exclude the true and eternall blessings of God. Much lesse then might the nature or person of Christ, which so greatly abounded in all spirituall and heauenly blessings, be counted accursed and hated of God, because he was content to taste of those things, which were inflicted on our condition as remembrances of Gods displeasure against our sinne. For since no mans person can be truly blessed and truely accursed with God, in as much as they are perfect contraries, and so the preualent state doth prooue the person to be either blessed or cursed, but not both; much lesse then might the person of Christ be both, though he did vndergo some things in this life, which were the priuations of Gods outward and earthly blessings, and so kinds of curses in their first entrance and ordinance. And yet because those temporall and externall curses were nether permanent, nor predominant in Christs person or condition, whether you respect his owne or ours in him, and he otherwise was a fountaine of blessing for himselfe and all vs; it is euident that Christs suffering those outward and earthly curses (for so the Scripture calleth the priuations of Gods blessings in the same kinds) imposed on mans condition for sinne, could not preuaile to make him accursed or hated with God. For as Christ was 2. Cor. 5. made sinne for vs, and yet no sinner, but still continued holy, Hebr. 7. 
               harmlesse, vndesiled, and separate from sinners: so was he made a curse for vs, and yet not accursed: by reason he endured the smart of our sinne, and tasted of our curse in this life; but he no waies receiued the guilt, or endured the dominion of either; much lesse was he by them depriued of any part of his inward and euerlasting blessings; which being by many degrees superiour to the other, must needs vphold his blessednesse, and ouerwhelme the griefe and name of those curses, which were temporally and tolerably laid on mans state and condition, to make him the humbler in him selfe, the mindfuller of his maker, and the warier against the flatteries of that old and craftie Serpent the Diuell. You shall doe well therefore, Sir Collector, to learne more reason, if not more Religion, and euen in naturall things to remember, that the night is darkenes though it haue some light; and the tree may be fruitfull, though some bough wither, and the

            The next thing you vndertake is the saluing of a contradiction, with which, you say, you are charged by me: wherein the patient Reader if he be at leasure and haue the Booke at hand, may take a plaine view of your idle Rouing, and litle vnderstanding. For I doe not charge you with saying, that Christ suffered ALL he suffered in his whole manhood, as you vntruely Defenc. pa. 53. li. 2

               This Antecedent, as you vtter it, doth neither good nor hurt to the Question. That Christ suffered in his whole Manhood for the Redemption of our sinnes, is a thing by me neuer doubted, nor denied: (and) that he suffered all that hee suffered in his whole manhood your selfe doe disclaime in the next Page. Your Indefinite proposition I said prooued nothing; and your selfe disclaymed the generall. Where now doe I charge you with saying that Christ suffered all he suffered in his whole manhood? Irather discharge you from it, then burthen you with it; onely I added, if you should meane otherwise, then your words were vttered, which I did not say, you did; then your Antecedent had a flat contradiction in it selfe. For so you should in one and the

same reason affirme, that Christ suffered all which he suffered in his whole Manhood, and yet had some sufferings proper to his Soule.

               whatsoeuer Christ suffered was very wrath properly taken. But you vnderstand suffering. for discerning, and so the soule onlie discernethWrath must be measured by Gods intention not mans discerning. the wrath to be from God, which the bodie suffereth.] Then by your vnderstanding, Christes bodie suffered nothing at all, because it discerned nothing at all; and so Christ suffered nothing in his whole manhood, which is contrarie to your maine assertion. But heere you take suffering for sensitiue discerning, which may be in the bodie, through or from the soule.] If you may be suffered to leape to and fro, with what significations of words you please to deuise, you may reach what contrarieties you will for the principles of your faith, and one As in the end shall mend all. Were it worth the time or paines to oppose your trifling As, I could aske you, whether condemnation of sinne, corruption of nature and infliction of death on the children of Infidels, be no parts of Gods wrath (as Gods wrath) because they are not yet by age able to discerne the wrath of God: or whether the curse which God layed on the Gen. 3 v 17. 
               earth, and Christ on the Mar. 11. v. 21 
               figge tree, were no curses; because neither the earth, nor the figge tree, could discerne them? But Gods intention maketh it wrath; not mans discerning: and in man it is wrath on either part, bodie and soule; though onlie the soule can discerne what and which is wrath from God. As for the goodnesse of your reason, if your say may stand for reason, you haue sayd it indeed; but any thing els that you proue there or elsewhere touching the proper wrath of God, or the sufferings of Christes soule from the immediate hand of God, truely I see not; and that I likewise leaue, as I do the rest, to the Readers censure.
            Hauing freed your selfe from contrarieties, as your maner is, with increasing them, you hasten now to vnload your al surdities: in which, whatsoeuer I haue said, I could thorowly fasten on you, notwithstanding your new found shifts of directly and indirectly, primarily and secundarily; if it could stead Christs Church to haue your speeches proued absurd: but because I seeke to mainteine the trueth of our redemption, which is needfull for all men to know; and not to publish your follies farder than the pride of your owne reasons compelled me; as I shortly touched them at the first, so will I now as shortly ouerrunne them, to-let you see, that I mistake not your words, howsoeuer you will now amend them; and not spend long time in displaying your ouersights which may be better bestowed about the matter itself.

For, what if the bodie of a beast may be crucified, and his blood shed, by piercing and wounding as Christs was? shall wee therefore say that Christs death and passion were common to brute beastes? Would any ma

                frame his heart thus to think, or his tongue thus to speake, but he that is bruter then a beast? Of your hell paines may it not more truly be said, that as you would cast them on Christes soule, they should be common to him with deuils; who I troe are worse then beastes? But these bee meete matters for such a master in Israel as you are.
            You vntruely and vnlearnedly suppose the corporall afflictions of the Saints, and of Christ himselfe, to pierce no further then into the externall sensitiue part, which you make common to them with beasts: and sufferings proper to reasonable creatures you admit none, but your hell paines, which are common to them with deuils. So

that by your profound diuinitie all Christian men suffer either as beasts, or as deuils. Which errour of yours I haue sufficiently refuted before; and by that enformed the Reader that the chastening and afflicting the soule of man by temporall and externall meanes and paines from the bodie is proper to men, and not common to beasts, who haue no soules, nor to deuils, who haue no bodies: and that God doth thus chasten and correct his children, whose patience is precious in his sight; thereby to trie, encrease, and quicken his graces in them, which is blasphemie to affirme either of beasts or deuils. And from what spirit this can proceede, to yeelde Christ no more sense, taste, nor thought of his bodily sufferings, then you doe to a beast, let the Reader iudge; for my part I abhorre such heathenish, if not hellish comparisons. But sense you will say, is common to man and beast.] I haue no doubt that beasts doe heare and see, smell, taste and feele, as well as men; but euen in all these fiue, and specially in hearing, seeing, and feeling, the soule of man sheweth difference sufficient betwixt a man and a beast. For man by his immortall and reasonable spirit, discerneth and vnderstandeth what he heareth, seeth, or feeleth, which beasts cannot doe; and he conceaueth not onely the things, which affect his senses, but the causes, effects, adiuncts, consequents, and remedies thereof; and thereby frameth himselfe, if he be religious, to behold therein the worke and will of God, which is as farre from beasts, as reason and grace. Though then eares, eyes, and sinewes be common to men with beastes; yet in them and by them the soule of man worketh, and suffereth; which because beasts haue not, it is a verie grosse ouersight of yours (Sir Discourser) to make the bodily sufferings of Christ common to him with beastes; in which the soule of Christ shewed so much obedience, pacience, submission, deuotion, and loue, that God accepted those sufferings violently and iniuriously inflicted on Christs bodie, but humbly, religiously, and willingly receiued in his soule, as the full satisfaction for our sinnes.

               There is no reason in the world, nor likelyhood, that the naturall facultie in Christs soule of proper and immediate suffering for our sinnes should haue no vse; and a suffering of paines onely from and by the bodie should be sufficient; when as in his doing of righteousnesse for vs, his soules ioynt obedience, and mutually knit together in and with his body was not alone sufficient. This must needes be a perfect reason for vs against you, except you could by expresse Scripture disprooue this proportion of like necessitie betweene the operation of the proper faculties of Christs humane soule, that is betweene his doing and his suffering for vs, which you shall neuer be able to doe.] When and how came you by this authoritie or libertie, that you may say what you will in matters of faith without all warrant of holy Scripture, and your fansies must stand for authentike, except I can disproue them by expresse Scripture? Nay first proue them, before we receiue them, as you and all other Christians ought to doe, if you will haue them passe for grounds of religion; and then if I can not disproue them by the same Scriptures, they shall go for good. An answer to this perfect reason of yours if you would haue, I answere you with Tertullian: Tertull. de carne Christi. c. 7. 
               Non recipio, quod extra Scripturam de tuo infers. I receiue not this, which you bring of your owne without the Scripture. And with Athanasius: Athanasius de incarnatione Christi. 
               If you will babble other things besides those which are written, why striue you with vs, that are persuaded neither to heare, nor to speake any thing besides the Scriptures? Shew vs this proper and immediate suffering for sinnes in the soule of Christ (which you so much talke of) by the Scriptures, and we wil thinke our selues bound to answer it; otherwise it is as easily reiected, as it is offered.
            
               But there is no reason in the world nor likelyhood it should bee otherwise.] IndeedeProper and immediate suffering for sinnes in the Soule of Christ, is the Defenders proper deuice. there is no reason in the world, nor likelyhood it should be so as you haue said. For in Christes doings and sufferings there was obserued, and must bee confessed a cleane contrarie course. His doings were all iust and holy, as hee himselfe was, and proceeded first from his own mind and will, by the immediate power and grace of Gods spirit in him, whencesoeuer the outward occasions were offered him. The sufferings which he receiued in his body, were all vniust and violent, proceeding from others, that wickedly persued and oppressed him; though in all his afflictions he beheld with

his minde, and with his will obeyed the Acts.

               fulfilling those things, which God before had shewed by the mouth of all his Prophets, that Christ should suffer. So that Christes obedience and patience in all his persecutions, came from the same inward powers and graces of his soule from which all his actions did; though the wrongs and violences were first offered his body by the wicked. In his inward affections and passions of feare, griefe, and sorrow; his minde was the first apprehender of the causes, that mooued them; and his will the admitter of them. But as in all his actions he was holy and iust, so in all his affections and inward passions, were they neuer so grieuous vnto him, he was not only righteous and innocent, but religious, and patient; and other passions of the soule in Christ, the Scripture knoweth none. As for your suffering of hell paines in the soule of Christ properly from the immediate hand of God, it is a deuice proper and immediate to your selfe, which you would faine bring in as an other and chiefe meane of our redemption, besides that which the Scripture speaketh of Christes sufferings. Wherein you must pardon me and all true beleeuers, for not accepting your fansies as any parts of our faith. We reade that God is the 2. Cor. 1.

Which fire we confesse is created and established by the might, power, and hand of God, as a meane to torment the damned, both men and Angels, according to their deserts; but that this fire is nothing else, but the immediate hand of God tormenting the wicked spirits in hell, as it did the soule of his owne Sonne on the Crosse; I take either of these assertions, not to dissemble with you, to bee a grosse and palpable error; strange to the Scriptures and strange to the whole Church of God, before these our dayes, wherein some make it their glorie rather newly to inuent, then rightly to beleeue, what the Scriptures deliuer, and the Church of Christ from the beginning receiued, and reuerenced as principles of Christian truth and pietie.

You would faine see how. Truely it followeth stronger vpon your words then I would wish, or you are ware. For whatsoeuer was by Gods ordinance needfull to the worke of our redemption, that made properly to our redemption. But the sufferings of Christs soule by or from the body (which you call by Simpathy) did not make properly to our Redemption, as you say: ergo the sufferings of Christs Soule by or from his body were not needfull to the worke of our Redemption. Now if the sufferings of Christs flesh were not needfull to our Redemption, then was his flesh needelesse for our Redemption by your illation. Which of these propositions can you auoyd, but they are either plainly true, as the Maior: or fully yours, as all the rest? Our Redemption being no naturall thing, but wholy depending on the counsell and will of God; whatsoeuer God appointed as necessary for our Redemption, that most properly made to our Redemption; and things needlesse could not appertaine thereto, but improperly. Of all men you may not start from this force of the word PROPER. For with you, improper wrath is no wrath, improper punishment is no punishment, and therefore improper belonging to our Redemption, is no belonging at all, but needlesse to our Redemption. And since Christs sufferings in his body by your assertion, did not make properly to our Redemption; it is euident they were needlesse to our Redemption: and if the sufferings of his flesh were needlesse, the flesh it selfe was needlesse to our Redemption, euen by your owne Conclusions.

he had NO NEEDE to assume both, but either the one part or the other.

               sleepe, which are your Resemblances; but they were directly intended by God himselfe in Christs incarnation, and expresly foreshewed by the mouthes of his Prophets, and necessarily to be borne in the body of Christ, before we could be redeemed, in respect of Gods will so setled and reuealed. The Apostle to the Hebrewes going about to prooue that Christ was to offer his body and shed his bloud for our sanctification and Redemption, layeth this for the ground; Hebr. 8. 
               Euery high Priest is ordained to offer gifts and Sacrifices. Wherefore it was of NECESSITIE, that this Man (Christ) should haue somewhat to offer. For (else) he were not a Priest. And concluding what must be offered; Christ (saith he) being 
               Hebr. 9. 
               an high Priest of good things to come, by his owne bloud entred in once into the holy place, and found eternall Redemption for vs. Wherefore 
               Hebr. 10. 
               when (Christ) commeth into the world, he saith; Sacrifice and offering (which are offered by the Law) thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou ordained me; then said I, Loe I come to doe thy will, O God. By the which will we are sanctified, euen by the offering of the body of Iesus Christ once. The suffering of Christs body and shedding of his blood were exactly purposed, and openly reuealed in Christs incarnation, as the WILL OF GOD for our Redemption; and the offering of Christs body on the Crosse WAS OF NECESSITIE, as the Apostle teacheth. Our Sauiour said as much; when he Matth. 16.
               Mark. 8.
               Luk. 9. 
               began to shew his Disciples, that he must suffer many things of the Elders, and of the high Priests, and Scribes, and be shine, and rise againe the third day. And when they had forgotten his words, the Angels put them in mind thereof after his resurrection, bidding them Luk. 24. v. 7. 
               remember, how he spake vnto you saying, the Sonne of man MVST BE deliuered into the hands of sinfull men, and be crucified, and the third day rise againe. And when some of them reporting how he was condemned to death by the Rulers and crucified, skant beleeued he was risen againe, himselfe said vnto them; Luke. 24. v. 25. 26. 
               O fooles, and slow of hart to beleeue all, that the Prophets haue spoken. Ought not Christ to haue suffered these things, and to enter into his glory? And to all his Apostles; Vers. 46. 
               Thus it is written, and THVS OVGHT CHRIST TO HAVE SVFFERED. So that Christs bodily sufferings for our Redemption were foreshewed by the Prophets, and OF NECESSITIE to be performed by Christ, in regard they were FOREDECREED of God, as a part of the ransome for our sinnes. For though Pilate with the 
               Acts 4. vers. 28. 
               Gentils and the people of Israell gathered themselues together against Iesus, yet did they nothing to him but whatsoeuer the hand and counsell of God determined before to be done. What greater necessitie or proprietie can you prooue by the Scriptures for any other things, which you dreame the Soule of Christ suffered from the immediat hand of God? If these things did not properly make for our Redemption, but indirectly and secondarily and by consequent as you prate; shew by the word of God, that your hell paines pertained more directly to our redemption then these things, which the Scripture speaketh of.

What you meane by Sympathie knoweth no man but your selfe. And therefore if that word haue in it any ambiguitie, the fault is yours, who first vsed it, and not mine. I teach as Nature and Scripture doe warrant me, that the Soule of man suffereth, as well by the force of her sense, as of her vnderstanding; and to the body of it selfe, I attribute neither motion, sense, nor life, but all these are the powers and effects of the Soule in the Body; and so is paine an impression on the Soule from or by the Body. As therefore the Soule seeth the workes of God by the eyes of her body, and heareth his words by the eares of her flesh, and neither of these by Sympathie: so the whole body and euery part thereof serueth as an Instrument, or a meane for the Soule to feele in her selfe, and not by Sympathie, the touch of Gods hand vpon the body. Had the Body sense of it selfe without or besides the operation of the Soule, then might it iustly be called a Sympathie, for the one to feele what the other suffereth and feeleth, as friends doe, that are like affected ech with other: but because all discerning by sense in mans body is proper to the Soule, I doe not see how the Soule should be exactly said to discerne and feele by Sympathie those things, which the body receaueth; but rather by her originall and naturall facultie of suffering from and by the Body, with which she is ioyned to doe all in the body, and suffer all from the body. Howbeit I striue not about the word, which some learned men haue vsed for the Communion of suffering betweene the Soule and the Body; but onely note that the word was first vttered by you, not by me; and therefore if you cauill with the signification of that word, you Cauill with your selfe and not with me. It sufficeth for me, that not onely Christians but euen miscreants, by the paines of their body haue perceiued and acknowledged the hand of God vpon them selues. The 
               Iob. 19. 
               hand of God hath touched me, saith Iob, when he was spoyled of all his goods, and his body blasted by Satan with a sore disease. Dauid in a sharp sicknesse, that consumed his bones, and turned his moysture into the drought of Summer, said to God; Psal. 32. 
               thine hand is heauie vpon me. Yea the Philistimes of Ashdod, Gath and Ekron, when they were plagued with Emerods for detaining the Ark of God, could say, 1. Sam. 5. v. 6. 
               his hand is sore vpon vs. And so much Paul told Elimas the Sorcerer, when he withstood the preaching of the Faith; Behold the 
               Acts 13. 
               hand of the Lord is vpon thee, and thou shalt be blind. Of Christ then there can be no doubt, but he felt the hand, and beheld the counsell of God in all, that the Iewes did vnto him; which whether you may call a suffering by Sympathie or no, maketh nothing to my Question or purpose. It is euident by the Scriptures that God by these outward paines vrgeth the Soules of his Seruants to seeke him; and Christ without vrging, submitted himselfe to the cruell and bloody rage of the Iewes, as to Gods decree and ordinance for our Redemption; who Iohn 19. 
               could haue no power at all against (him) vnlesse it had been giuen (them) from aboue.
            
            Hence you goe to examine the deriuation of sinne from Adam, the satisfaction for sinne by Christ, the beginning of sinne in the first man, and the continuing thereof in vs all: matters of good waight and worthy due consideration; wherein if either you did vnderstand what I said, or not so hastily catch after shewes, that as soone deceiue you, I should need fewer words to represse your follies. But such is your course and custome, that you flie after feathers, and thinke you get great purchases. In your Treatise you framed an obiection in my name, as if I had reasoned, that Trea. pag. 19. li 7. 
               Adams sinne was propagated into vs not by our Soules, but onely by our flesh, which onely we deriue from him: and therefore Christ onely by his flesh and not by his Soule procured satisfaction for vs. Indeede I might haue said that our Bodies, and not our Soules, are deriued from Adam, and shewed the consent of Scriptures, Fathers, and the best writers on euery side, as well Protestants and Papists, as Pagan Philosophers all ioyning in that opinion; but I thought not good then to trouble the people with that Question: and therefore

I rested on a knowne and confessed principle of Christian truth and faith, that we inherite pollution and death from Adams flesh, without resoluing whence the Soule commeth, which I did refraine before the multitude to speake of. And since by the Scriptures the first Adam was a Rom. 5. v. 14. 
               figure of the second, the flesh of Christ giuen for vs must be as able to clense and quicken vs, as Adams flesh was to defile and kill vs. To this reason you here pike many quarrels, but in the end you slide it of, as else where answered. Your first quarrell is, that I force, what I promised to forbeare, euen the difficultie whence the Soule of man is deriued. As though the grounds of our Faith might be doubted, because that Question in former times was vndecided? That we deriue flesh from Adam, and haue men for the Fathers of our bodies, did neuer man yet, that was in his right wits, call in Question, were he Christian or Heretick, Iewe, Turke, or Pagan. That likewise wee deriue with our flesh pollution and death from Adam, the faith of Christ rightly grounded on the Scriptures doth not suffer vs to stagger at, though whence our Soules are giuen vs, some haue stood perplexed. You thinke it much I should deliuer the one, which is the pollution of our flesh professing not to determine the other; and make it in me a kind of inconstancie to vrge the propagation of the flesh with her sequels, of which no Christian may doubt, because I thought it not fit to trouble the people with the deriuation of the Soule. But so hath the Church of Christ alwaies done; it hath cleerely confessed the deriuation of sinne and death from Adam, and made it necessarie for all Christian men so to beleeue, though some would not hastily, or could not easily resolue the doubt, whence the Soule commeth.

The most diuine Moses writeth, that Adams bodie was first made, and afterward his soule inspired into him, Againe in his lawes the same Prophet plainly teacheth vs, that the bodie is first made, and then the soule created and infused. And blessed Iob spake thus to God: Diddest thou not powre me forth like milke, and thicken me like curds of cheese? thou diddest clothe me with skinne and flesh; and compact me with bones and sinewes.

If the whole, the fathers of force must presently dic, (hauing whollie lost their soules:) If a part, how can a part be cut off from a simple (and spirituall) substance? Vrsinus: Vrsin. tract. Theolog. de peccate. 
               We grant the soules of all men are created of God, when they beginne to liue; for they at one time are created, and vnited to the bodie. Zanchius: Zanchius de

               That the whole soule is created by God, I beleeue, confesse, and teach with the whole Church, and auouch it may be prooued by firme reasons. His reasons are largely deliuered in the fift chapter of the same booke, and all that can be sayd for generation and propagation of soules against their creation by the immediate worke of God without any humane meanes, is there learnedly and sufficiently refuted. So that in respect of Austens doubt, whether God deriue the soule from the soules of the parents, when he putteth it into the bodie being first finished, or createth it of nothing, as he did Adams soule, I did relinquish that in question; but as for the soules rising in and by generation from Adam, which you now catch holde of, I neuer meant to fauor that fansie so much as to make it any question in matters of faith; since with one consent Philosophie, Physicke, euident experience, and the Scriptures themselues conuince that to be an erroneous and manifest vntruth.

               I haue shewed before at large, that your Minor is nothing true: for pollution that is sinne and reall iniquitie is not in our flesh without a soule.] You said so much in effect before in your Treatise, and if your word bee a proofe, you haue shewed it; but other proofe

you bring none, saue that which inclineth rather to heresie then Christianitie, if you speake to the purpose, and stand to your words as they lie either in your Treatise, or in your Defence. In your Treatise you say, Trea. pa. 21. li. 28. 
               Let vs not bee curious in this hard point, holding this most euident trueth, that sinne is a proper and vnseparable qualitie of the soule, and can not be found being in any thing, where a reasonable soule is wanting.] If you take the word sinne in his right sense, as you ought to doe speaking of the propagation of sinne, and so comprise in it as well originall as actuall sinne; here are two grosse errors euen against the Christian faith. For if sinne can not be found in any thing, where a reasonable soule is wanting; then can no sinne bee found in the deuils, for they haue no soules. August. Retract. li. 1. cap. 11. 
               Angels to haue soules I doe not remember that euer I read in the deuine and canonicall Scriptures, saith Austen. If Angels haue not soules, then deuils haue none; for they were holy, and now are reprobate, but still Angels, as Christ calleth the deuill and his Angels. Againe, sinne being either actual or originall; children in their mothersMatth. 25. wombe haue not actuall sinne, neither dispute we of actuall sinne, when we talke of deriuing and inheriting sinne; for actuall sinne is neither deriued, nor inherited. If then that, which is conceiued, haue no originall sinne so long as the soule wanteth; since you 
               Trea. pa. 21. li. 4. 
               content your selfe, as you say, with the opinion of the most at this present, that the soule doth not passe together with the seede of our generation and conception; most euidently you denie original sinne, till the soule come to quicken the body; and so contradict the expresse words of Dauid, who saith, Hee was 
               Psal. 51. 
               begotten in sinne and conceiued in iniquitie. No maruell then you stumble at Ambroses words, that wee are

               pray omit mens Authorities in this case, and prooue by sound reason, that which you would. For pollution that is sinne and reall iniquitie, is not in our flesh without a soule.] We were best to omit all learning, experience, and trueth; that onely your conceits may stand vpright. It hath pleased God in things naturall, by sight and experience to leade Philosophers and Physitians to the trueth of his workes; as farre as mans wit can reach; and with one consent they resolue, that the reasonable soule of man neither riseth in the body, nor commeth to the body presently with the conception. Mothers and midwiues doe certainely distinguish the time of quickning, from the time of conceiuing; and hee that would perswade them, that the child quickneth immediately vpon the conception, might as easily bring them to beleeue, that the moone is made of a greene cheese. But sound reason you require.] As if trueth of experience were not the soundest reason men can giue, till God doe speake. That the body is not straight way framed vpon the conception, many thousand scapes in all femals, and namely in women doe perfectly prooue. The Physitians and Philosophers interpose many monthes betweene the conception and perfection of the body. Iob himselfe declareth that we were first Iob 10. 
               as milke, when we were in seede; then Iob 10. 
               condensed as curds, when we turned to bloud; and after that Iob 10. 
               clothed with skinne and flesh, and lastly Iob 10. 
               compacted with bones and synewes, before we receiued life and soule from God. The new Testament noteth these three degrees in forming our bodies; to wit, seede, bloud, and flesh; and calleth our parents the fathers of our bodies, but not of our spirits, which God alone is. If then nothing can be defiled with sinne, as by your doctrine you resolue, except it haue a reasonable soule; of necessitie wee either had reasonable soules at the instant of our conception, which is a most famous falsehood repugnant to al learning, experience, and to the words of Iob; or else we were not conceiued in sinne, which is a flat heresie dissenting from the plaine words of the sacred Scriptures, and from the Christian faith. Choose which of these issues you will; you either way shew your selfe to haue little sense, and lesse trueth.
            But I must 
               Defenc. pa. 57. li. 13. 
               adde the word onely, or else I say nothing against you.] No good Sir, that shall not need. We inherite pollution by Adams flesh before our Soules come to our bodies; and that sufficeth for my reason, though the pollution, which we inherite, be deriued as well from the Soules, as from the Bodies of our Parents; because their bodies,

when they begat vs, were ioyned with their Soules, whose naturall and animall faculties were still in them wholy corrupted, and their sinnes communicated vnto their bodies, though their spirits were renued and sanctified. The very Seed, of which we were begotten and conceaued, was an vncleane thing, (as Iob calleth it, when he saith; Iob. 14. 
               Who can make a cleane thing of an vncleane?) and corruptible; that is full of Corruption, as Peter nameth it when he saith; 1. Pet. 1. 
               borne againe not of corruptible Seed, of which we were borne by our Parents. The corruption of sinne then is first deriued by our Bodies, though our Soules be likewise wrapped in the same pollution and condemnation, that our bodies are; and sinne still abideth and rebelleth in our flesh so long as we liue, though our Soules be washed and clensed from sinne. And therefore the Apostle calleth our flesh, Rom. 8. v. 3. 
               the flesh of sinne, in the similitude of which Christ was sent, and confessed that Rom. 7. 
               in his flesh dwelt no good thing; assuring vs, that though Christ be in vs, Rom. 8. v. 10 
               the body is dead because of sinne, when the Spirit is life, (or liueth) because of righteousnesse. Neither is this newes to Zanchius, whom you cite in your Treatise as if he fauoured your error. Zanchij tractat. Theolog. cap. 4. de peccato originali. 
               Quod attinet ad contagium illud, certe citra controuersiam, in corpore primum inest, & deinde per corpus in animam deriuatur. Iob docet aperte cap. 14. Quis potest facere mundum de immundo conceptum semine? Quid autem proprie de immundo concipitur semine? Caro. As for the contagion (of originall sinne) that is surely without Question first in the body, and after by the body is deriued into the Soule. Iob teacheth vs plainly in his fourteenth Chapter. Who can make one cleane, conceaued of vncleane Seede? Now what is properly conceaued of vncleane Seede? Flesh. If any man list to read more I remit him to that place of Zanchius, least I should be ouerlong; or else to Peter Martyr where he largely treateth thereof against Pigghius. Pet. Martyr

               The common receaued Opinion is (saith he) that the Soule draweth originall sinne by her coniunction with the body, which is infected and vitiated from our Parents. Wherefore if any aske, what is the seate or subiect thereof, (as they vse to speake;) We answere, that originall sinne hath place in the flesh as in the roote, and beginning thereof: afterward from that fountaine, it occupieth the Soule, and so is extended through the whole man. Idcirco semen est instrumentum quo hoc peccatum ex parentibus traducitur in filios. Therefore the Seede (of man) is the instrument whereby this sinne is traduced from the Parents to the children. And least he should seeme to rest himselfe on the receaued opinion onely, not long after he addeth. Idem Sectione. 30. 
               Now reasons are to be brought, which may firmely and soundly prooue, that originall sinne is propagated in men by Seede and generation. And that we will therefore shew out of the Scriptures, because many reclaime and thinke this whole matter to be a fiction.
            
            
               Defenc. pag. 57. l. 19. 
               With one breath you ouerthrow your selfe. For you say we haue pollution before the soule commeth, whence soeuer it commeth. Yea, whence soeuer? What if the soule doe come in and by generation? you see how you crosse your selfe.] To that peruerse and false supposition of yours, that the soule of man commeth in and by generation, which now you cleaue so fast vnto for an aduantage, I neuer gaue any allowance or forbearance. Looke to my words as narrowly as you can. I say, the minor (proposition of my reason) is cleere 
               Conclus. pa. 252. l. 25. 
               without intermedling with the question, whence, (not when) the soule commeth. I there resolue, that the soule is the life of the bodie, not of seede nor of blood, as you grossely would wrest my speech; and therfore before life come, the soule which bringeth life, commeth not to the bodie. Then if pollution cleaue to the flesh before life come, (as Ambrose teacheth) and consequently before the soule come, (which commeth not before the bodie is made, as I auouch) whence soeuer it commeth; it is euident that Adams flesh defileth, and so condemneth vs (before the soule come.) You in the abundance of your wit, take whence soeuer to be as much as when soeuer; and so by your misconceiuing you would fasten a contradiction to my words. But coaxe not your selfe with such contrarieties grounded vpon your owne most ignorant mistaking; I made no question of the time, when; but of the roote, whence, the soule commeth. I learned by Leo, that 
               I
                     •…
                  o. epist. 93. ad Furibium. 
               the Catholike faith did truely and constantly teach, that the soules of men were not before they were inspired into their bodies: and consequently the bodie must first be framed, before the soule can be inspired. And the contrarie conceite, which you now take holde on,

is a manifest repugnancie to the Church, and faith of Christ. I saw that inconuenience which you see not, when you pronounce, sinne is not in our flesh without a soule, that is neither before, nor after the soule. For if the soule of man arise in and BY GENERATION, and that can be no man which neuer had mans bodie; what kind of creatures, I pray you, call you those abortions and scapes, that passe from their mothers, when they are yet but seede or blood, before the body be framed? Soules they haue, in and by generation, as you now suppose; bodies they haue none, that be humane. Men therefore they be not for want of bodies; other kinds they are not, seeing they haue soules; what name then will you giue to these vnfashioned births, hauing reasonable and immortall spirits as you imagine, or what place will you assigne them after this life? 2. Cor. 5. 
               We all must appeare before the Tribunall of Christ, euery one to receiue things done (in or) by his bodie. They haue nothing to receiue for any thing done in or by their bodies, which they neuer had; neither can they expect the resurrection of the bodie, which pertaineth not to them. 1. Cor. 15. 
               It is sowen (saith the Apostle) a naturall body, it is raised a spirituall bodie. These haue no naturall bodies of men, and so shall neuer rise with spirituall and glorified bodies; yea they haue no part in Christs resurrection, which was corporall, since they do not communicate with him in their bodies, which may be conformed to his glorious bodie. You must then deuise some new name, and some new place for those new creatures of yours, which hauing no bodies of men, can not by the Scriptures looke either for the resurrection, or for the saluation promised to men.
            You doe not auouch it, you will say, you did but obiect it.] Your most euident truth, as you call it, that sinne cannot be found being in any thing, where a reasonable soule is wanting, doth directly inferre, that either we were not begotten and conceiued in sinne, which is an euident heresie, repugnant to Dauids wordes; or els the vntimely fruites and scapes of women, haue reasonable soules at the very instant of their conception, when sinne is found in them by Dauids words, which is this grosse, absurd, and false conceite, that now you would shunne. If you flie for helpe to actuall sinne; haue children actuall sinne in their mothers wombes, or as soone as they haue reasonable soules? Or is actuall sinne traduced and inherited from Adam? or spake I of actuall sinne when I said, we inherite pollution from Adams flesh before the soule commeth? Will you sticke to it, and say; originall pollution is no sinne? Dauid conuinceth you, who saith, he was Psal. 51. 
               begotten in sinnes, and conceaued in iniquitie; and Paul affirmeth that Rom. 5. v. 12. 
               death went ouer all men, (infants not excepted) for so much as all men haue sinned, and euen ouer them also who 
               Vers. 14. 
               sinned not after the likenesse of Adams transgression; that is, who did not commit sinne as Adam did, actually and voluntarily; but naturally inherited sinne from Adam, which Rom. 4. v. 20. 
               dwelleth in them from the houre of their conception, to the time of their dissolution; and Verse 23. 
               worketh the euill in them that they would not; leading them captiue to the law of sinne which is in their members.
            
            But how could Dauid say, he was conceiued in sinne, when at the time of his conception he had neither bodie nor soule?] Howsoeuer mans reason iudge thereof, which yet often giueth the name of the whole to a part, and the titles of things represented to their images; with God nothing is more frequent than 
               Rom. 4. v. 17 
               to call those things which are not, as though they were; because he not only made all things of nothing, but quickeneth the dead, and hath things past and to come present before him. Leui is sayd by the Scripture to haue Hebr. 7. 
               payed tithes to Melchisedech by Abraham, as being then in Abrahams loines, when Leuies grandfather was not yet borne. So God by his Prophet spake to Cyrus many yeeres before Cyrus was borne, calling him his anointed, and saying to him by name, Esa. 44. & 45. 
               thou art my shepheard. So certaine is the counsell of God, and his purpose so immutable, that he speaketh in the Scriptures of things to come, as if they were past or present. Out of this infallible decree of God, Dauid and Iob call that seed which was prepared to be the matter of their bodies, by the names of themselues, because it could not be altered, what God had appointed. But

the void conceptions of women, which miscarie before the bodie be framed, neuer had either life or soule; and so neither name, nor kinde; but perish as other superfluous burdens and repletions of the bodie, which God hath appointed to no vse, saue to ease the bodie.
            In satisfaction for sinne you runne the same course that you do in the rest: for neither vnderstanding my words, nor almost any mans els rightly, you fight with your owne fansies, as if they were parts of my faith. I sayd, the Scripture acknowledgeth no satisfaction for sinne but by death. I did and do so say; what then? Defenc.

               Still we must note, that by death you meane onlie the bodilie death.] In Christes person I alwayes meane by the death which he suffered, the death of the bodie; though you would include the death of the soule, which I do not. In the wicked I take death for all kinds of death, corporall, spirituall, and eternall. What can you hence distill? Then 
               Defenc. pag. 57. li 32. 
               surely the wicked should satisfie easily for their sinnes. Farre be it from me to vtter such a sentence.] Doe the wicked with any kinde of death satisfie for their sinnes? or is their condemnation to hell paines therefore eternall, because by no death they can satisfie for their sinnes? Were the iustice of God once satisfied by any thing the wicked could suffer, their torments should cease; but their punishments euerlastingly continue, for that no satisfaction can be made to God by them, suffer they neuer so much, or neuer so long. Whose follie then is it, to pronounce, that the wicked may satisfie for their sinnes? mine or yours? I sayd no such word; I directly auouched the contrary. Serm. pag. 43. li. 23. 
               The paines of hell haue neither worth nor weight sufficient in themselues, to satisfie the anger, or to procure the fauor of God. Satisfaction for sinne I ascribe to none but onlie to Christ, and in him to no death but onlie to that of his body. Will it thence follow, the Scripture acknowledgeth no satisfaction but by (some kind of) death: ergo the wicked may satisfie for their sinnes by the deaths which they suffer? Be it farre from all wise men to make such consequents, and from all Christian men to make such conclusions. The antecedent in effect is confessed by your selfe. Defenc. pag. 58. li. 20. 
               The Scriptures (you say) do shew indeed that Christ should not satisfie without death. I sayd the same. By satisfaction, I meant full satisfaction, when no more could be exacted, as the word importeth; and not the concurrents or precedents to satisfaction, when the chiefest is vnpayed. Why then doth your absurd and leud conclusion folow more vpon my words than vpon your owne?
            My proofs are not good, with those you finde fault.] If yours were no worse, they would go more currantly. The Apostle sayth: Christ is the 
               Hebr. 9. 
               Mediator of the new Testament, that through death, which was for the redemption of transgressions, we might receiue the promise. Heere death is auouched to be the redemption, which is all one with satisfaction, for sinne: for wherewith we are redeemed, therewith God is satisfied. Defenc. pag. 58. li. 3. 
               Christes bodily death meerely and alone (you say) without any thing else together therewith (which is my intent) is not heere mentioned.] You will not tell where your shoo wringeth. Death was for the redemption or satisfaction for sin sayth the Scripture. Now the death of Christes bodie, or of his soule, or of both, must here be contained. The death of Christes soule you dare not openly professe, and therefore all this while you carrie it couertly vnder the sufferings of Christes soule. But you must come plainly to it: for these assertions of the Apostle; Hebr. 9. 
               Death was the redemption of our transgressions, and we are 
               Rom 5. 
               reconciled to God by the death of his Sonne, will make this to be the question, as I first set it; whether the death of Christes soule, or the death of the damned, which is the true paines of hell be a necessary part of Christs satisfaction and our Redemption. Other sufferings of the Soule are meere shifts to harbor your folly, if you striue in words; or your impietie, if you striue indeede for the death of Christs Soule, as requisite by the Scriptures to our Saluation. That Christ did not die the death of the Soule I doe not prooue; there is no cause I should, it is your assertion that he did, and must be prooued by you; which you be so farre from comming neere, that you purposely conceale it, and onely skirre at it here and there in SOME KIND OF SENSE. Otherwise you offer nothing as yet to the Reader, but

the 
               Defenc. pa. 58. li. 35. 
               proper sufferings of the soule; which I trust are not alwaies priuation of grace, and exclusion from blisse. For so the faithfull should neuer haue any proper sufferings of the Soule, or else vtterly loose both the spirit and fauour of God, which they neuer doe.
            The other Authoritie which I cite, (In the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt die the death) is not so sound you thinke. For Defenc. pa. 57. li. 31. 
               am I sure that death here is but the bodyly death onely and no more? I no where say, that death threatned in these words was onely the death of the body; it is one of your rash and rude illations, it is none of my assertions. I knew that God gaue this Commandement, and threatned this punishment as well to Adams posteritie, as to his person. Otherwise had this prohibition beene made to Adam alone, neither could the woman haue beene within the compasse of it, who was not then created when this precept was inioyned, neither could Adams of-spring haue tasted of death, as well as Adam, if this penaltie had stretched no farder then to Adams person. But he being the roote and stocke of all mankind, as he receaued blessings by his creation, which should be common to all that descended of him, so by his transgression he lost them as well from his Issue, as from himselfe, and subiected them to the same death and condemnation, that he did him selfe, when he rebelled against God his Creator. Death we see executed on all the children of Adam; and therefore we may not doubt but death was threatned to them all, before it was inflicted on them. Howbeit the commination in this place is like to Gods th

               e due vnto all, but it bindeth not God, that he shall not haue power to release, or mitigate what, and to whom pleaseth him. In death then here threatned I containe all kinds of death; corporall, spirituall, and eternall; either as expressed in the generall name of death, which is common to them all, or as consequent ech to other and coherent, if by Gods goodnes and mercies in Christ Iesus they be not seuered. Saint Austen learnedly and truely teacheth the same. August. deciuitate Det. li. 13. cap. 12. 
               When it is asked, what death God threatned to the first men, if they transgressed the Commandement giuen them, whether the death of the body, or of the soule, or of the whole man, or that which is called the second death; we must answere, ALI. When therefore God said to the first man, what day soeuer yee eate thereof, yee shall die the death, that threatning contained what soeuer death there is euen vnto the last, which is called the second death, and after which there is none other.
            
            If any man stand more strictly on the time and kinde of death, when and which Adam should die by this Commination; Saint Austen hath an other answere. August. deciuitate Dei. li. 13. cap. 15. 
               In that which was said yee shall die the death, because it was not said, deaths; if we vnderstand that onely death whereby the soule is forsaken of her life, which to her is God; (for she was not forsaken, that she might forsake, but she did (first) forsake that she might (after) be forsaken) though I say we vnderstand, that God denounceth this death, when he said, what day yee eate thereof, yee shall die the death; as if God had said, what day yee forsake me by disobedience, I will forsake you by iustice; Surely in that death were the rest denounced, which without Question were to follow. For euen in that a disobedient motion rose in the flesh of the Soule disobeying, for which they couered their priuie parts, one death was perceaued, wherein God forsooke the Soule. And when the Soule forsooke the body now corrupted with time, and wasted with age, an other death was found by experience, which God mentioned to Man, when punishing sinne he said, earth thou art, and to earth shalt thou returne: that by these two deaths that first death of the whole man might be accomplished, which the second death at last doth follow, except man be deliuered by the grace of God. By Saint Austens iudgement concording with the Scriptures, God threatned all kinds of death to the transgressor; the death of the Soule the same houre to take place that he disobeyed; the rest to follow in their order; as next the death of the body, and at last eternall death of body and soule, if the grace of God by Iesus Christ did not release and free man from it. That the death of the Soule tooke present hold vpon the disobeyers, the Scripture giueth testimony sufficient, when it noteth their shame, feare, and flight of Gods presence, who before sinne was their delight, ioy and blisse. The death of the

body was a long time differred in Adam, euen Gen. 5. v. 5.

Secondly, that some of Adams issue should effectuall feele the sting of all, which God allotted to the reprobate. Thirdly, that euen the elect as well as the reprobate, should beare in themselues the monuments of this transgression by the corruption & dissolution of their nature, though the one should in this life bee reformed by the working of Gods spirit in them, and the other bee restored after this life by the Resurrection from the dead. All these wee finde performed by God in the trueth of his iudgements, and therefore we may be sure they were intended at the time of his threatning. And consequently this collection is very true, that God threating Adam with these words, Thou shalt die the death; purposed, if Adam transgressed, that none of his posteritie should escape the death of their bodies, to which, God foorthwith punishing sinne, irreuocably subiected Adam and all his children, as Gods owne words declare, when he said to Adam, and in him to all men, Genes. 3. 
               Dust thou art and to dust shalt thou returne. The iudges reuenge then for sinne, which we deserued and to which we were iustly condemned, was temporall & eternall death, of the body and soule, heere and in hell. But this was not executed on all, because some were freed by the fauour of God in Iesus Christ, though none excused from a corporall death; which prooueth my position the truer, that God neuer released sinne to any, no not to his owne Sonne, without some kind of death.

               must not be forgotten, that here you renounce all satisfaction for sinne, in respect of merite as from Christes soule vtterly.] If you meane I vtterly renounce all satisfaction for sinne as from the death of Christs soule, I easily graunt it; and would gladly heare what you can say against it, because the soule of Christ, as I beleeue, could not die the death of spirits. But if you conceiue; that Christes soule had neither part, sense, nor

merit in the death of his body, by which satisfaction for sinne was fully made, it is the weamishnesse of your wit to mistake so much, and vnderstand so little. I attributed all sense of paine as well in death as other wise to the soule of Christ; and the death of his body I communicated to his soule, by reason it is a separation of the soule from the body, not thereby to bee depriued of sense or grace, which Christes soule could not be, but therein to feele the paine and sting which the death of the body brought with it.

               paine of the flesh is only the offending (or afflicting) the soule by the flesh. Wherefore I made the soule of Christ to be the principall agent in all his meriting, and patient in all his suffering; and though the soule of Christ could not pay the satisfaction for our sinnes by her death, because shee could not die; yet that is no impediment, but the soule of Christ might haue, and had the chiefest paine, sense, and merit in the death of Christes bodie, by which the whole person made full satisfaction for the sinnes of the world. And this is so farre from renouncing all merit of satisfaction from the soule of Christ, as you conceiue, that it ascribeth the whole power and force thereof to the obedience and patience of Christes soule, and maketh the bodie the instrument ordeined of God to conuey paine vnto the soule; and to lie dead when the soule is departed from it. As for Bernards words which I alledge, if you did or could tell how they crosse mine, I would take the paines to reconcile them; now you say they sute not with mine: but awake out of your wonted maze, and you shall see that I giue the chiefe place and part in the meritorious sacrifice vnto the soule of Christ, which you dreame I doe not; as also that you neither like nor allow of Bernards words.

               That nothing may satisfie for sinne but death, is not sound; the Scriptures doe shewe indeede that Christ should not satisfie without death: but they denie not, that there are other parts of Christs satisfaction, which differ from his death, as his bloodshedding, his shame, his
               Euery thing in Christ was meritorious, but not satisfactory for sinne. 
               reproches, his apprehension, his buffeting; and besides that, pouertie, hunger, and wearines. These doubtlesse, yea all other sufferings of Christ what soeuer, small or great, are satisfactorie and meritorious.] That all Christes actions and passions were meritorious with God, I haue no doubt; but that all his sufferings as well naturall as voluntarie, did euery one, small or great, satisfie for sinne, This is a speech of yours, which except it be well qualified, hath in it an whole heape of absurdities and contrarieties. For if the least and the first thing that Christ suffered either naturally or voluntarily did satisfie for sinne, superfluous were all the rest to our redemption, when God was once satisfied. And so by his birth or circumcision you graunt a Supersedeas to all his life and death as needelesse to our redemption. Then the which what can be more repugnant to the word of God, and faith of Christ, and euen to your selfe, who by this meanes make your hell paines of no importance to our saluation? By satisfaction you meane not full satisfaction; but that which any way tendeth to satisfaction, or is requisite before satisfaction can be made.] It is easie and often with you to abuse words, though you talke much of their proprietie. What is Satis in Latine, whence to satisfie commeth, but enough? and what is enough for sinne, but after which more is not requisite? If then Christ satisfied, that is, did or paide enough for sinne by the first of his sufferings, then all that followed, as I inferred, were more then enough, and consequently superfluous. That you will say is the proper and strict signification of the word satisfie, but you take it more largely.] For the abuse of words I will not greatly striue, so you build thereon no impieties; howbeit when I say that nothing might satisfie for sinne but

death; I take satisfaction properly for the last and full payment, after which no more was due for sinne; and that apparantly by the Scriptures was the death of Christ, before which the rest was not sufficient, and after which no more was required by the righteous will and counsell of God. So that although the obedience and patience of Christ all his life long did tend to satisfaction, and made way for satisfaction, as his hunger, wearinesse, pouertie, and such like; yet none of these did satisfie for sinne, or acquite vs from sinne by the verdict of the holy Scripture; but Christ after all these must yeeld himselfe to suffer that kind of death, which the iustice of God should appoint and ordaine, before we could be freed from our sinnes. His blood you thinke did wash vs from all our sinnes. Because his blood was shed for vs euen vnto death, therefore his bloodshed expresseth the manner of his death, as likewise his apprehension, buffeting, reproches, and shame; which the Scripture describeth in the order of his death, and therefore compriseth vnder the name of his death. For by Christes death, as I haue often said, the Scripture meaneth that kind of death in all respects and circumstances, which the Euangelists in their writings report.

               Who will grant in proper speech, that those are his death?] The name of Christs death in the Scriptures containeth all those things, which were coincident and concurrent to that death, which Christ died for our sinnes according to the Scriptures. NeitherWhat is contan

For where S. Iohn saith, the blood of Christ doth clense vs from all our sinnes; by your Synecdoche you imagine that the Matth. 26. wine, which he dranke at his last Supper; Iohn. 13. the water, wherewith he washed his disciples feete; Iohn. 11. the teares which he shed for Lazarus death; Iohn. 4. the iourney, which he tooke to Galilee; the Matth. 8. sleepe, which he fetched in the ship; the Matth. 4. hunger, which he sustained in the wildernesse; and what not, should doe the like; since euery thing that befell our Sauiour, small or great, did satisfie for sinnes, as well as his death and passion. What els is this but to mayme and mangle the Scriptures, which name the blood of Christ to be the price of our redemption, and his death the meane of our reconciliation; if euerie thing that Christ did or endured shall be of the same force and weight to satisfie for sinne, that his bloud and death were? His bloud, you will say, is not his death.] The shedding of his bloud vnto death, which the Scripture intendeth by his bloud, is a plaine description of his death: Matth. 26. 
               This is my bloud, sayd he, which is shed for many for the remission of sinnes. And the rest which were appendants to his death, expresse the maner of his death, which the wisdome and iustice of God would haue to be full of violence, iniurie, reproch, contempt, shame and paine. All which as they note the maner of his death, so are they inclosed by the Scriptures in the name of his death; and that I trust more properly being parts thereof, than the naturall infirmities of his bodie, as sleepe, hunger and wearinesse; or the voluntarie euents of his life, as the rest of his actions and passions, long before the houre came that he should be deliuered into the hands of sinfull men.

               Why may not the proper sufferings of Christs Soule be as well admitted into the worke of Christs satisfaction, although his SOVLE COVLD NOT PROPERLY DIE?] The sufferings of Christs Soule at the time of his death, which the Scriptures mention, we easily admit into the worke of his satisfaction for sinne; but your satis-fiction of hell paines and of the death of Christs Soule we doe not admit; because the holy Ghost so diligently describing the whole order and manner of Christs sufferings, when he went to his death, teacheth no such thing as you falsely collect from certaine words of his, and chiefly from his bloody sweate; whereof not knowing precisely the cause, you surmise what best pleaseth your humor without all warrant of the word of God. Prooue therefore by the Scriptures, and not by your owne ghesses, that Christs Soule suffered these things from the immediate hand of God, which you suppose; and we shall soone find a place for them, in the worke of Christs satisfaction for sinne.

Till then giue me leaue to expound the Scriptures by themselues, and not by your vnioynted and vntidie Commentaries confounding Christs life and death, nature and will, affections and punishments, satisfaction and merits; as if they were not different parts of our saluation, to take our nature vpon him, to worke all righteousnes in our names, to suffer a shamefull and painfull death for our sinnes, and to obtaine all spirituall and celestiall graces and comforts, here and in heauen for vs.
            The first sinne committed by Adam, and our continuall treading in his steps, rest yet vndiscussed; wherein we should not neede many words, if you could, or at least would rightly conceaue what is said; and not ignorantly or purposely mistake, and measure all things by your hastie humor. To prooue that Christ must satisfie for sinne by the proper sufferings of his Soule, and not with or by his body, you brought this reason in your Treatise. Trea. pa. 19. li. 27. 
               Whereby Adam first did, and we euer since doe most properly commit sinne, by the same the second Adam Christ hath made satisfaction for our sinnes. But Adam first did, and we euer since doe most properly commit sinne in our Soules, our bodies being but the Instrument of the Soule, and following the Soules direction and will. Therefore Christ in his Soule most properly made satisfaction for vs: In my Conclusion to your obiections I first denyed your Maior or former proposition. For though the Soule of Adam, as also our Soules quickly might, and worthily did die for sinne and by sinne, wherein they were the principall agents; yet the Soule of Christ by no warrant of holy Scripture did, or could die the death of Spirits, and so could make no satisction for sin by her death. Now by the Scriptures without death there was no satisfaction for sin: and therefore the soule of Christ must satisfie for sinne by the death of her body, & not by any death proper to her selfe. And so much the Scriptures auouch teaching vs, that we haue Ephes. 1. 
               redemption euen the remission of sinnes through his blood, & are 
               Rom. 5. 
               reconciled to God by the death of his Sonne: who 
               1. Pet. 2. 
               bare our sinnes in his body on the tree, that we might be deliuered from sinne, and healed with his stripes. And without satisfaction to God for sinne we haue neither remission of sinne, nor redemption from sinne, nor reconciliation with God. Vpon this ground I then did & still do reiect your maior, as guarded neither with text nor truth, but leaning only to your priuat liking, as the best helpe to commend it. From thence I came to your assumption or second proposition; that Adam first, and we euer since most properly committed sin in our soules, our bodies being but the instruments of our soules, & following the Soules direction and will. The which because it had diuerse branches, one touching Adams transgression, an other touching ours; and likewise two parts, the soule & body in either; I reserued for diuers answers.
            In Adams sinne if you meant, as your words made shew, that his Soule and bodie were ioyned in transgressing Gods Commandement, the Soule as the agent, the body as the instrument; That I said was MOST TRVE, but repugnant to your intention and maine Conclusion. For then as Adams Soule transgressed the Commandement with and by her bodie; so in fatisfying for sinne Christs Soule must be punished by and with her bodie, which was the thing you so much laboured to ouerthrow. To this you now replie. Defenc. pa. 59. li. 8. 
               Nay, the Conclusion will follow, that the immortall part, the minde, was punished peculiarly, and not by and from the body onely: seeing in all euen outward sinnes the Soule sinneth both principally, and also in a proper and peculiar manner by it selfe, yea before the body sinneth. Albeit the body sinneth also secondarily and in a manner proper to it selfe, euen as the instrument as you say.] The principall and peculiar action of the Soule, in sinnes that be common to the Body and Soule, maketh no proofe that the Soule must haue a distinct and seuerall punishment from the body; or that it may not be punished from and by the body. The true and full punishment of all sinne in all the wicked is the casting of Body and Soule into hell fire, where one and the same punishment is common to both, euen as their sinnes were; notwithstanding the proper and peculiar manner which the Soule hath in sinne by it selfe aboue the body. The punishments of this life are likewise common to both. For the Soule feeleth whatsoeuer greeueth the Body, neither can any thing offend the Soule, which doth not likewise disquiet the Body. How beit the effects and impressions of one and the

same punishment are different in Soule and Body; not onely because the Soule is the chiefe patient and sentient in all paine, as it was the chiefe agent, and disponent in all sinne; but also for that the Soule seeth and greeueth farder vpon feeling the paine, then the body can doe. For the Sense of the Body can onely iudge how tolerable, or intolerable the paine is; but the Soule reacheth vnto the cause, continuance, and consequence thereof, which often times afflict the Soule as much, or more then the paine it selfe. This difference dependeth on the nature of the Soule which because it is endued with reason, remembrance, and intelligence, perceiueth not onely things present and subiect to sense, as the Body doth, but things past and future together with their dependences; and things spirituall, as well as corporall; and the losse of ioy and blisse, no lesse then the anguish of perpetuall paine and miserie. So that in all punishments of sinne, which be common to the Soule and Body, the Soule is farre deeper engaged in the griefe thereof, then the Body can be. But this is no reason to proue that Christs Soule must die the death of Soules, or feele the paines of hell, because his Soule considered better of his paines then his body could doe.
            Two Rules of Gods Iustice in punishing the sinnes of men the Scriptures report. Which though they be kept in all others, yet may no man affirme them of Christ, farder then the Gospell giueth euident Testimonie to them. The one is the meanes, the other is the measure of punishment. As, Wisdom. 11. 
               Wherewith a man sinneth, by the same also shall he be punished: and Reuel. 18. 
               How much she exalted her selfe and liued in pleasure, so much torment and sorrow giue yee to her. Neither of these ruies could rightly fasten on Christ, because he neuer sinned; and therefore touching the meanes, by which he satisfied for our sinnes, the Scriptures and not your imaginations must be consulted. Now they testifie that he 
               1. Cor. 15. 
               dyed for our sinnes according to the Scriptures; and that we were 1. Pet. 1. 
               Redeemed by his pretious bloud, which was Matth. 26. 
               shed for Remission of sinnes. Here is the satisfaction for the sins of men which the Scripture deliuereth without any other death of the soule, or of the damned, which men must suffer, if they be not freed from it by the death and blood of Christ; but Christ neither did nor could suffer. For the measure of paine, which Christ suffered in the death of his body described in the Scriptures, we must leaue it to God, who only knew what proportion of paine in the person of his Sonne was sufficient for the sinnes of the world, & not therein trust the deceitfull ballance of your presumption, who neither know what degree of pain Christ suffred on the crosse; nor how much in the person of Christ would satisfie the iustice of God for our sinnes. Only this we are assured, that he 
               Hebr. 5. 
               learned obedience by that which he suffered, & his patience was thereby proued, but neither of them ouerwhelmed, or endangered. And therefore that Christs paine on the Crosse was equall to hell paines, or the very same, which the damned do suffer; these be your rash and violent intrusions vpon Gods iustice; allotting to Christ out of your owne braine the same punishment (as you call it) in substance, that the wrath of God inflicteth on the wicked and damned for their sinnes; but in all these collections you rest on the rules of your owne reason without any warrant of the word of God, which neuer sorteth our Sauior in his sufferings with the reprobate & damned; and contrary to the Christian faith, which groundeth the waight of our redemption, and strength of our Reconciliation to God vpon the infinitie of the person that died for vs, and not of the paine that was suffered in our steeds.
            
               Defenc. pa. 59. li. 14. 
               Yea farder I meane, that some sinnes the Soule acteth in and by it selfe meerely: and therefore it suffereth likewise some punishments meerely in it selfe, which touch not the body at all, vnlesse it be by Sympathie onely, and that onely when they grow vehement.] What you now meane vpon better aduise, maketh nothing to the Conclusion, which you would haue forced out of your former words. Your assumption was, that Adam first did, and we euer since doe commit sinne most properly in our Soules, our bodies being but the Instruments of our Soules. In which words you speake of no sinnes, but onely such as Adam did, and we still doe commit ioyntly with Soule and body, though most properly in the soule, the body being her Instrument or accessarie to follow her direction and will. And would you wrie and wrangle neuer so much, from sinnes common to

Soule and Body, most proportionably followeth punishment likewise common to Soule and Body; though in that common punishment the Soule perceiueth and feeleth greater and grieuouser hurt and smart, then the body can doe. If now you adde a farder meaning then you there expressed, your reason remaineth as weake as it was at first, and your new meaning must haue a new answere. For which I must pray the Reader to stay till we haue more fully examined Adams fact, where you first began, and wherein you would seeme to haue some great aduantage. Howbeit if you marke well either your own purpose, which you offer to prooue; or your Assumption, which you bring for proofe thereof; or my words depending thereon; you will haue but a cold suite of all this hoate challenge. Your purpose was to prooue, that Christs sufferings for sinne must be proper to the Soule, and not with, from, or by the Body, which you reiect as common to vs with beasts. The reason, which you brought for it, was, that Adam first & we euer since (so) sinned, that is, MOST PROPERLY in our Soules, our Bodies being but the Instruments of our Soules to follow the Soules direction and will. Now because your wonted phrase (MOST PROPERLY) is so loosely set in your assumption, that a Man can not tell whether you meane most properly in the Soule, together with the Body being the Instrument of the Soule, as your words lye; or else most properly in the Soule, without and besides the Body, which is it that you intend, & must conclude before you can thence inferre the proper sufferings of Christs soule, without and besides his body: I asked you which of these twaine you ment. If the former, then Adam first, and we euer since committed sinne ioyntly with Soule and Body, the Soule being the Principall, and the Body her Instrument and accessarie. This I said was most true, but repugnant to your purpose, as I before haue shewed. But if you ment OTHERVVISE, that Adam transgressed the Commandement of God MOST PROPERLY in his Soule, without his Body concurring to the same transgression, which is more pertinent to your purpose; then you contradicted, the fact of Adam and Gods precept, both which doe plainly witnesse, that Adam disobeyed as well by Body as by Soule.
            If you will needs examine my words vpon this your intention and assumption, I am well content. That Adam sinned in soule and bodie, I say is most true. There is my full resolution: Against this I neuer goe. But if you meant Conclus. pa. 254. li. 6. OTHERVVISE, that Adam brake the commandement of God, not by his body properly, but by his soule (only) as your words most properly might intend, then your assumption was a manifest contradiction to the fact of Adam, and to the precept of God. That the bodie alone without the soule doth or can commit actuall sinne, which hath neither life, sense, motion, nor action without the soule, is a position so absurd and false, that I thought it not woorth the mentioning. I asked you then whether you meant that Adam brake the commandement, not by his bodie properly, as by an instrument to his soule, which is 
               Defenc. pag. 59. li. 13. 
               proper to the bodie, as your selfe confesse; but by his soule without his bodie, that is, by his soule onely. For what is by the soule, and not by the bodie; but by the soule onely? I asking you that question of your meaning, you as eclipsed of your wits, suppose that I say, Adam sinned onlie by his bodie and not by his soule; as if Adam when he sinned, were a body without a soule; or his bodie did any thing without the direction and operation of his soule. This is therefore a verie foolish dotage of yours, to dreame that I defend Adam sinned by his bodie without his soule, when I prooue and inferre by Adams fact and Gods precept, that Adam transgressed not by his soule (only) but by his bodie (also:) euen as in murder, theft, and adulterie, these facts men commit by their bodies (as instruments) and not by their soules (alone or without their bodies.) For can men commit these facts without their bodies, or are their bodies requisite as well as their soules before they can commit these facts?
            
               Adam was 
               Defenc. pa. 60. li. 2. 
               as well forbidden 
                     •…
                  o desire or like that fruit, as to eat it; which you denie.] To proue that Adam sinned not onely by his soule, but also by his bodie; I brought the words of Gods precept, Thou shalt not eat thereof. Which commandement since Adam wholly transgressed, the words had more in them than the prohibition of desiring

or liking; and Adams sinne reached farder than to liking or lust, euen to the complete fact, whereby the commandement of God was thorowly in euerie part of man broken, which could not be done without the ioynt actions of Adams bodie. Wherefore take backe the heresie of the Pharisees to your 
                  •…
               elfe, and bestow it among your friends that haue lent you their labours in this Defence. I am not to seeke, that Gods law is transgressed as well with heart and tongue, as with hand and deed. Howbeit, I distinguish facts from words and thoughts, and auouch that FACTS can not be performed without the bodie. And yet are there speciall reasons which you see not, why the wisdome of God would not giue this commandement without euident mention of an outward fact. For the breaking of this precept was the transgression, that should subiect Adam and all his posteritie, to the dominion of sinne and death, in euerie part of bodie and soule. Wherefore God would not haue the first sinne to be secret within the soule alone; that all Adams of-spring should openly behold and confesse the wickednesse, vnworthinesse, and vnthankfulnesse of their first parents, that so lightly regarded and presently transgressed the charge and precept, that God gaue vnto them. Secondly, since Adams cariage in this case should be the retaining or loosing of all Gods graces and blessings for him and his children, bestowed on man in his first creation; the transgression must reach to all the senses and faculties of bodie and soule, that should infect and corrupt all the parts and powers of bodie and soule. Thirdly, the first sinne was to extend as well to bodie as to soule, lest the soule sinning should be adiudged to euerlasting death, and the bodie not sinning reserued for eternall life; and so man be diuided contrarie to his creation, the one part in hell, and the other in heauen, which was vtterly impossible. And if Adam after liking had yet remembred Gods precept and threat, and so refrained the eating of the forbidden fruit, it would trouble your wits to make a true answer, whether Adam had obeyed or transgressed the commandement. But it sufficeth for my purpose, that Adam sinned ioyntly with both parts, as well with bodie as with soule; and so Christ, (if your proportion were any thing needfull, which I wholly reiect, as needlesse in the Sonne of God) by this reason of yours needed no proper sufferings of the soule without and besides the bodie.

               Paul vnderstoode (Rom. 7. vers. 7.) when hee became a Christian, that the desiring of euill is sinne before the outward act bee consummate.] You alleage Saint Paul, as you doe the rest, for matters that he neuer meant. Paul speaketh not Rom. 7. vers. 7. there of the actuall desire of euill, when the will hath thereto consented, such as was in Adam, when hee resolued to eate the forbidden fruite; but of the naturall inclination and first motions to sinne, which are in vs after Adams disobedience, but were not in him before his fall. For that precept, thou shalt not lust, conuinceth and condemneth our nature to be corrupt and sinfull, to which originall concupiscence (the roote and spring of all sinne in vs) cleaueth so fast, that euen in our cradles this corruption excludeth vs from the kingdome of God, if we be not regenerate in Christ by water and the holy Ghost. In Adam besore sinne there was no such thing, his nature was vpright and sincere, as it was first created, and voide of all concupiscence intended by this precept, as the See Peter Martyr, M. Musculus, Caluine, Gualter, and others vpon this place. Rom. 7. verse 7. best learned of our time teach, till by his transgression sinne entred and infected both body and soule. Neither doe you conceiue right of Paul, as he was a Pharisee, when you suppose he tooke the outward fact of sinne onely to bee sinne. Neuer read he, thinke you, when he was a Pharisee, the words of Esay; Esay. 7.

The very heathen Philosophers placed vertues and vices in the minds of men, and the prophane Poets would haue mens enterprises measured by the intent, & not by the euent. The Pharisees were neuer so blinde, as to thinke all counsels, thoughts, desires, and lusts to bee lawfull, against the manifest and expresse words of the law and Prophets; but they blindly

mistooke the law of God, as forbidding externall facts onely which are hurtfull to others, vpon paine of malediction and damnation. They rather stood vpon the Popish opinion of veniall and mortall sinnes, and did not thinke that veniall sinnes did exclude them from the righteousnesse of the Law, nor from the kingdome of heauen. Of that opinion was Paul when he was a Pharisee, but vpon his conuersion and better instruction by the spirit of Christ hee vnderstoode, that not onely euill desires and thoughts were forbidden by the seueral precepts of Gods law as deadly sinnes, which the Pharisees would not admit, to vphold their owne righteousnesse; but that euen the secret tentation to sinne, and the inward propension and corruption of our hearts are interdicted and condemned by this precept, thou shalt not lust, as sinne sufficient to exclude vs from the kingdome of God.

               Your doctrine is very strange, where you teach, that the soule properly committeth no sin, but by & with the body; that is, the soule in it selfe & by it selfe alone sinneth not. You say, all prouocations and pleasures of sin the soule taketh from her body, all acts of sin she committeth by her body; which speeches are exceeding vntrue and hurtfull.] To him that either fully can not, or rightly will not vnderstand what is said, all things seeme strange; otherwise set aside your olde ordinarie phrases of proper and meere, without which you can say nothing; and the matter which you so much maruaileat, is very plaine, as well by the rules of Scripture, as proofes of nature. Is it so strange a doctrine with you, that the whole man, and not this or that part of man, is by the word of God charged with the committing of euery sinne, and guiltie thereof in such sort, that the whole person is defiled therewith, and shalbe condemned therefore? Luke. 5. 
               Depart from me Lord, saith Peter to Christ, for I am a sinfull man. 
               Psal. 32.

               Tribulation and anguish vpon the soule of euery man, that worketh euill, saith the Apostle. By which, as by infinite other places of Scripture wee are taught, that the whole person, which is man himselfe, is the sinner, by which part so euer he sinneth. Iohn. 8. 
               Euery one that committeth sinne, is the seruant of sinne; saith our Sauiour. Can the soule be in bondage for sinne, and the body bee free? Deut. 27. 
               Cursed is the man, saith Moses, that keepeth not all the words of the law to doe them. Can the soule bee accursed for sinning, and the body be blessed as not sinning? The 
               Rom. 6. 
               wages of sinne is death, saith the Apostle. Shall death preuaile against the Soule for sin, and the Body escape death as voyd of sinne? Surely no. Sinne defileth the whole Man, by what part soeuer it is committed; yea the very thoughts of the hart coinquinate the whole man. When the Pharisees held opinion, that meate eaten with vnwashen hands defiled the Body, our Sauiour reprooueth that error in them; and teacheth his Disciples, that Marc. 7. 
               nothing without a man can defile him, when it entreth into him: but the things which come foorth of him, are they that defile the Man. For from within out of the hart of Man come foorth euill thoughts, couetousnesse, wantonnesse, a wicked eye, pride, foolishness. All these euils come from within, and defile a Man. Where we see that enuie, (which Christ noteth by a wicked eye) and pride, and such like inward sinnes, yea and euill thoughts defile the Man, that is as well the Body, which the Pharisees tooke to be defiled with vncleane hands, as the Soule. The Apostle stretcheth the infection of sinne farder, euen to the meates them selues, that are eaten of the wicked. Tit. 1. v. 15. 
               All things (saith he, speaking of meates, which the Iewes counted vncleane) are cleane to the cleane; but to the vncleane and vnbeleeuers nothing is cleane; but euen their minde and conscience is vncleane. So that the vncleannesse of the inward Man, defileth the outward Man, and all things, which the outward Man vseth.
            This is so true, that not onely the guiltinesse, and filthinesse of sinne is in this life communicated from the Soule to the Body; but both shalbe therefore condemned in the righteous iudgement of God to euerlasting fire. 2. Cor. 5. 
               We must all appeare before the tribunal of Christ euery man to receiue the things done by his Body. Where all sorts of sinnes in thought, word, or deede, are by the Apostle called 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , or as others read, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , things done by the body, or the things proper to the Body. And though we expound it, as some doe, for the things done in the Body; yet all three expositions

conuince that the Soule can not sinne without the Body, but by or in the Bodie; and that the condemnation for sinne reacheth as well to the Body, as to the Soule. Else the resurrection of the Body were superfluous in the wicked, if Gods Iustice did not determine for sin to punish the Body together with the Soule. Where Tertullians Rule taketh place to prooue them both guiltie of sinne, that shall be both punished for sinne. Tertullianus de resurrect. carnis.

               What define we a man to be? both (a bodie and a soule) ioyned together, or either of them seuered? It is manifest, that the coniunction of both maketh a man. Let vs also consider this, whether those things which men do and commit; for example, adulterie, murder, theft, and whatsoeuer is consequent to these; or on the other side, sobrietie, continencie and euerie action that is opposite to vice, may be sayd to be the effects of both, or be referred to the soule alone.

               it? Such a soule may contradict the iudgement of God, and say: I (alone) sinned not, but the bodie (with me.) For since I departed from the bodie, I committed neither fornication, nor adultrie, nor theft, nor murder, nor idolatrie, neither did I any euill; and her defence shall be found reasonable. Vpon this reasonable defence of hers what shall we say? Shall the iudgement of God cease? or will God punish men vniustly? God forbid. Therefore as God made the man one compound of bodie and soule, the iust Iudge will raise the bodie againe, and giue it his owne soule, and so shall the iudgement of God be iust, both parts communicating either in punishment for sinne, or in reward for vertue. Ambrose giueth the same reason for the resurrection of the bodie.

                   aut poenae dedatur, aut gloriae reseruetur. This is the course and ground of iustice,

that because the act (of sinne) is common to bodie and soule, the bodie performing what the minde deuised, both should come into iudgement, and both be awarded to punishment, or reserued to glorie. For it seemeth almost absurd, where the law of the flesh impugneth the law of the mind, and the minde often doth that which she hateth whiles the sinne (or corruption) of the flesh dwelling in man worketh, that the soule should be subiected to the iniurie as guiltie of anothers fault, and the flesh should enioy rest, which is the author of the miserie; and the soule alone should be punished, which alone did not sinne; or alone be glorified, which alone did not striue for glorie. Theodoret treadeth the same steps, though with a larger processe: Theodoret. de prouidentia. Serm. 9.

                  ! fall on the rocks of wickednesse; or rather if I must speake the trueth, the bodie drew me into the pit of sinne. Snared with his eyes did I curiously view the beautie belonging to others and affected both lands and riches, they compelling me to behold such things. The affections of the bodie brought me to seruitude, and tooke away the libertie which thou gauest me. I was forced 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , as bred with him and his fellow-seruant, to minister vnto him, and prouide for his wants. Often times grieued therewith, haue I yeelded to the necessities of the flesh, yea not knowing what els to do, and verie much sorowing, haue I beene driuen to wait on the desires of the bodie. And often haue I resisted, and stifly repelled his snares; but his continuall conflicts manie times ouercame me. When I repressed him, I afflicted my selfe, for I receiued backe the griefe: when I cherished him, I was impugned by him, enduring his wanton assaults. Therefore assigne not me alone to punishment, ó Lord, but either free me together with the bodie from these straits, or cast that together with me into torment. Howbeit the Iudge needeth no such supplication; but as he gouerneth wisely, so he iudgeth iustly, restoring the bodie; to their soules, and so giuing to euerie one according to their deserts. Damascene alledgeth the coniunction of the soule with the bodie, and the cooperation of both in all vertues and vices, as causes sufficient why the bodie must be iudged and rewarded together with the soule. Damascen. de fide Orthodoxa. l 4. cap. 28. 
               If the soule alone sustained the trials of vertue, alone shall she be crowned: and if she alone were intangled with pleasures, iustly she alone must be punished.

                   faculties of the Soule the Father call corporall, and why. Fathers meane by the bodie; and what powers and faculties of man they comprise in that name, and why: so shall wee the sooner discerne what cooperation in sinne mans bodie hath with his soule. The bodie, as it is the instrument or seruant of the soule, to do good or euill, is no dead nor senselesse lumpe of flesh; but hath annexed vnto it, besides life, both sense and motion, and those as well inward as outward. For externall and internall sense and motion are not only performed by vitall and animall spirits, which are plainly corporall; (though their vigor and force be from the soule, which bringeth life and sense;) but so affixed to the bodie, that they die with the bodie, and are not found in the soule, so long as she is separated from the bodie. Those faculties these Fathers ascribe the rather to the flesh, because in some sort they be in beasts, who in their kinde haue sense and motion, both outward and inward; and sensitiue desires and affections depending thereon: which all must needs be corporall, for that brute beasts ledde only by sense to desire and delight in things present before them, haue no spirituall nor immortall part from which they should proceed. The same powers of sense, and sensitiue appetites, and affections in mans bodie, these learned Fathers account and call corporall, not that they discerne or moue without the soule, but that the sensitiue and inferiour powers of the soule are mixed with corporal spirits in man, and by them apprehend and desire externall & sensible things, by which corruption of senses and affections the soule is drawen to diuers delights and desires, that

are continuall occasions and inducements to sinnes. Therefore Theodoret nameth 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , the desires, affections, assaults and conflicts of the bodie seeking by pleasures and sundrie lusts to conquer the soule. Neither want they the warrant of holy Scripture in so speaking. Rom. 6. 
               Let not sinne reigne in your mortall bodies, sayth Paul, to obey it in the lusts thereof; neither giue your members to be weapons of vnrighteousnesse vnto sinne. So that the members of our mortall bodie are called by the Apostle the weapons of vnrighteousnesse, by which sinne fighteth against the soule. Iam. 4. 
               Whence are warres and strifes in you, sayth Iames? not hence, euen from the pleasures which fight in your members?

               Abstaine, sayth Peter, from carnall desires, which fight against the soule. 
               Rom. 7. 
               I delight in the law of God, sayth Paul, according to the inward man: but I see another law in my members fighting against the law of my minde, and leading me captiue to the law of sinne, which is in my members. O wretched man that I am, who shall deliuer me from the bodie of this death? Where the inward man (which is the mind lightned and the will directed by grace) is diuided against the outward man, which must n

            To strengthen this doctrine, which you thinke so strange, it shall not be amisse to consider somewhat further, what communion the soule hath with the bodie; that thereby we may perceiue, what vse the soule hath of her bodie in well or euill doing. The habitation of the soule in the bodie, and her coniunction with the bodie making one man of two contrarie parts; mortall, and immortall; visible, and inuisible; reasonable, and vnreasonable; is so wonderfull a worke of God, that the manner thereof wholly pas

               eth our vnderstanding: onely by consequents, and effects wee gather, what she vseth in the bodie, what she perceiueth by the bodie, and what she imparteth to the bodie. Howbeit her habitation in the bodie, and vnion with the bodie, composing one person of both, called man, is sufficient by the Scriptures, if we knew no more of the communion that is betwixt them, to make both parts guiltie of all sinne committed and liable to the punishment thereof both in this world, and in the next. And so much the Scriptures teach vs, when they require confession of our sinnes, or promise remission of our sinnes or threaten vengeance for our vnrighteousnesse; wherein the bodie is not seuered nor excepted from the soule, but both are con
                  •…
               oyned in one person, to whom and euery part of whom, either mercie is afforded vnto saluation, or iustice awarded vnto damnation. And yet because the communion which is betwixt the soule and bodie, will giue vs some light, how the soule vseth the helpe of her bodie in accomplishing her actions; I may not omit to speake thereof, though happily it will be somewhat obscure to the simple, and more remote from their vnderstanding, then in this case I could wish.
            As man was ordained of God to haue in him the seuerall operations, of life, of sense of reason, so was the soule created with three diuerse faculties answerable to those three functions; to wit, with a vitall or vegetatiue for the first, with a sensitiue and motiue for the second, with a reasonable or intellectiue for the third. The vitall facultie prouided for the quickning, nourishing, increasing and preseruing of the bodie in moderate strength to the discharge of our dueties to God and our neighbour, is so fastned to the bodie that without the bodie it hath neither vse, nor action.
            The second facultie called sensitiue was giuen of purpose to the soule, not onely to perceiue by sense the natures, helpes, and vses of all externall and sensible things, and by voluntarie motion to pursue that, which was profitable for vs; but chiefly, that by seeing the workes & hearing the words of God we should come to the knowledge of his will, and open our lippes to praise his name, and to direct and comfort others; as also stretch out our hands to aide and relieue our selues and our brethren, and with all the partes of our bodie to performe all outward actions and dueties of pietie and charitie. To which ends because sense and motion both externall and internall

were requisite as well as reason, the wisedome of God hath placed in the body, and specially in the head and heart (the seates of vnderstanding and will) certaine thinne, quicke, and aeriall vapours, or spirits, which rise from the blood, and are brought by the braine to a marueilous force and agilitie, that they should carie to the minde of man with incredible celeritie the resemblances of all things subiected to sense, and with like vehemencie stirre and excite the heart and will of man, with consent to imbrace, and with all the powers and partes of soule and bodie to follow after that, which prouoketh and delighteth the sensitiue spirits. So that these corporall and actiue spirits are the meanes, whereby particular things and circumstances, together with their profites and pleasures, are in a moment presented to the mind: and the heart and will likewise mooued and inflamed to accept and allow that, which contenteth and pleaseth the senses. For according as the things obiected to sense, or remembred after sense, seeme good or euill to the powers of the soule vnited with these spirits, so is desire or anger kindled by pleasure on the one side, and dislike or griefe on the other, which presently and violently preuaile with the soule, where grace wanteth, and lust and striue euen in the Saints against the spirit of God. This is that part of the soule, which in the faithfull is not regenerate, whiles here they liue; lusting still after the things of this world, euen the delights of the flesh, the desires of the eye, and the pride of life; and by these baits and snares fighting against the Soule.
            The third power of the Soule is intellectiue, that is the mind endued with vnderstanding and will; which in the naturall man is ignorant of God and auerse from God by corruption of sinne, and so caried through the loue of it selfe either to carnall pleasures at the prouocation of the senses, or to vaine desires vnder color of humane reason and glorie. This part in the faithfull is lightned and perswaded by the Spirit of God to see and acknowledge the good and acceptable will of God, and strengthned with a measure of grace to resist the dominion of sinne dwelling in our mortall bodie, that is in the sensitiue powers and affections of the soule mixed with the members and spirits of the body; though in this life the mind euen of the regenerate hath not that perfection of knowledge and loue, which the law of God requireth; and therefore shrinketh often from the leading of Gods spirit by ignorance and infirmitie, but neuer by rebellion and obstinacie.
            This much being said touching the powers of the Soule, which may more largely be perused in that learned Zanchius de operibus dei part. 3. lib 2. cap. 3. worke of Zanchius alleaged by this Discourser; It is most euident by the very grounds of humane and Diuine learning and experience, that the principall part of the Soule, which is the mind enabled with reason and will, hath in all sorts of sinnes a manifest communion with the Body; either by information of the senses, or by tentation from the affections, or by impression on the spirits and parts of the body, or by the ready subiection of the whole body to the will; besides originall corruption, which the Soule draweth from the Body, sufficient of it selfe to make the Body guiltie of all euill committed by the Soule, and actuall execution, whereby the Soule needeth and vseth the Body to effect and accomplish, whatsoeuer she intendeth. And first of information for the senses.
            The knowledge of good and euill, which the Soule of man hath in this life, is not infused by creation, as it was in Angels, to whom that kind of knowledge is peculiar, but collected from the sense, and taught by time, as we see by experience in all mankind without exception. I still reserue the reuelation and inspiration of Gods Spirit; when, where, and to whom pleaseth him. A plaine proofe of the former point we dayly behold in children, who vtterly know nothing, no

                  ft, as God himselfe testifieth, till by sense and vse they learne to distinguish, and at length to conceaue the things set before them. The Rule of naturall Philosophie expressing, that the vnderstanding hath nothing, which came not from the sense, you would faine tumble out of your way, but it is very true and consonant to the Scriptures, if it be taken as it was ment, and the reuelation of Christs Spirit thence excepted, of which in deed the Philosophers knew nothing. For that was not spoken of conclusions
               
in reason, as if they must be first in sense, before they could be inferred by consequent; nor of the diuiding and compounding things in mans imagination, that came from the sense, as dreames and fictions; but of the principles or premisses in reason, which must be plaine to the sense; and of the naturall and true proprieties and differences of all particular things, which the sense must first apprehend, before the mind can rightly discerne them. So that the mind conceaueth truely no singular things, which were not first apparent to the sense, since man hath no naturall meanes giuen him of God to get the true knowledge of any thing, that is not reuealed or inspired from aboue, but onely his senses. To this the Scriptures beareth witnesse, where the meanes to informe mans Hart of good and badde, in which sinne consisteth, are set downe to be the eyes, and the eares, still sauing to God, what he reuealeth by the power of his spirit. Ignorance and neglect of Gods will, whence all sinne commeth, are described in the Scriptures by the dulnesse of the eare, and blindnesse of the eye. God hath giuen them (saith Paul) the spirit of slumber; euen eyes that they should not see, and eares that

               they should not heare vnto this day. Our Sauiour confirmeth the same out of the Prophet Esaie. Matth. 13. 
               The Hart of this people is wexed fatte, they heare dully with their eares, and winke with their eyes; least they should see with their eyes, and heare with their eares, and (so) vnderstand with their harts. But blessed (saith he to his Disciples) are your eyes, for they see; and your eares for they heare. In so much that the Apostle doubteth not to assure vs, Rom. 10. 
               faith commeth by hearing, when the hart beleeueth vnto righteousnesse, and without hearing there is no beleeuing; How shall they beleeue in him, of whom they haue not heard? And God requiring his people to be wise and learne, saith,

                  2. 
               Heare ye deafe, and yee blind behold, that yee may see. As God then vseth no outward meanes besides his works and his words to teach vs his will; so hath he giuen vs no naturall course to learne, but by the eyes and the eares; by which we must come to the knowledge of all heauenly, and much more of all earthly things.
            The loosing and decaying of mans knowledge in this life, after he hath gotten it, will proue the same, no lesse then the lacking thereof, before he doth by sense attaine it. For when the sensitiue spirits in the braine be either grosse and heauie, as in fooles; or extreame hoate and whirling as in madde men; or obstructed and choked as in Lethargies and Apoplexies; men want the vse of reason, because the obiects, whereon the minde worketh, are by these meanes hindered and hid from the vnderstanding. This is the true resolution both of Philosophers and Diuines. Zanchius de operibus dei part. 3. li. 2. cap. 2. fol. 507. 
               Ad facultatem intelligentem exercendam non eget (mens) organo tanquam medio, per quod intelligat: quanquam eget obiecto, in quod intueatur, & ex quo intellectionem concipiat. Hoc autem obiectum, sunt phantasmata, seu rerum a sensibus perceptarum simulachra ad phantasiam perlata. To exercise the facultie of vnderstanding the mind of man, saith Zanchius, needeth no instrument, as a meane by which she may vnderstand, but she needeth an obiect, whereon to looke, and whence to conceaue the act of vnderstanding. This obiect are the sensitiue apprehensions, or the resemblances of things receaued from the senses and caried to the phantasme or imagination of man. And to this obiection that vpon the hurt or wearinesse of the braine we find by experience, our mind can not vnderstand and worke in those things as it did before; he answereth. Zanchius ibidem. fol. 507. 
               Ideo non potest lesis aut defatigatis turbatis

Therefore our mind can not contemplate and conceaue, when the instruments are hurt, wearied, or troubled, because the resemblances of things, which are in a corporall instrument, and are as an obiect to the vnderstanding, can not be seene and perceaued. For the Ibidem. 
               resemblances of things in mans Imagination are to his vnderstanding and mind, as colours are to his sight. Now the eye seeth nothing but the colour of euery thing, though therewithall it distinguish number, quantitie, motion and figure, and so taketh the knowledge of euery sensible thing. In like manner without the similitudes and shapes of things caried from the sense to the phantasiue imagination or apprehension, and there remaining, the mind vnderstandeth nothing of those things, that are without it; and

no knowledge is naturally within it, but what God hath reuealed to it. His conclusion is. Zanchius de operibus Dei part 3 li. 2. cap. 3. Thesi. 2. de phantasia.

            In inward tentation to euill, Saint Iames rule doeth generally take place. Iam. 1. 
               Euery man is tempted being drawne away, and entised by his owne concupiscence. And lust conceiuing bringeth foorth sinne. So that lust naturally dwelling in vs, and conceiuing and bringing foorth sinne, is the very mother and nurse of all sinne in vs. Austen maketh two chiefe rootes of sinne in man, desire, and feare.

                   vestra, perscrutamini conscientias, videte vtrum possunt esse peccatanisi cupiendo aut timendo. Two things cause ALL SINNES in men, desire and feare. Bethinke your selues, discusse, examine your hearts, search your consciences, and see whether there can possible bee any sinnes, but by desiring or fearing. Where least Austen making two fountaines of all sinnes, desire, and feare; should iarre with Saint Iames, that setteth downe lust for the first spring of euery tentation to sinne: we must either take tentation, of which Saint Iames speaketh, for a delightfull prouocation to sinne, resting within vs; and terrour, which Austen addeth, for a violent and externall induction thereto proceeding from others: or else wee must deriue, desire and feare from the loue of our selues, which originally dwelleth in vs, and lusteth after euery thing that liketh vs: or lastly wee may ioyne the one as a consequent to the other; since the naturall desire wee haue of our owne ease and welfare, breedeth in vs that dislike and feare of euill, which so much vrgeth and forceth vs. If then desire and feare, be the motiues and inducements to ALL SINNES, that men commit; as most resolutely Saint Austen auoucheth; and these two desire and feare, on which depend the rest of our affections, be passions of the sensitiue part of the Soule permixed in this life with corporall spirits: certainely all sinnes in men haue their prouocations and incitations from and by bodily senses, spirits, or motions. Clamens Alexand. Stromat. li. 6. 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               . By bodily spirits (saith Clemens Alexandrinus) man hath sense, desire, reioyceth, and kindleth to anger; yea and by the same (spirits) doe the thoughts and resolutions of the minde proceede to action.

                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , &c. Where is it iust, sayth Athenagoras, that DESIRES, pleasures, FEARES and sorrowes should haue their motion (or rising) from the body, and the sinnes occasioned by them, and the punishments for the same sinnes should lie on the Soule alone? Damascene defining the passions or affections of the Soule, saith. Damascenus orthodox. fidei li. 2. cap. 22. 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               . A passion (or affection of the Soule) is a sensible motion of the desiring or appetitiue facultie, vpon the imagination of good or euill. In which description are three plaine proofes, that the passions of the soule (which by the confession of Damascene, and all other Diuines are Ibidem. li. 2. cap. 12. DESIRE, FEARE, ioy and sorrow) doe not mooue in this life without the body. First in that they are sensible motions, they must be perceiued in the body; next in that they rise from the sensitiue appetite, they are conioyned with the body; thirdly in that they come vpon the phantasiue imagination of good or euill, they are kindled from the senses of the body. What sensible motions these affections of the soule doe raise in the outward and inward parts of man, we shall anon perceiue, when we come to the impressions, that the soule maketh on the body: in the meane time it is not amisse to know, how Satan, who hath that name from his desire and power of tempting, worketh and preuaileth in his temptations vpon men.
            It is euident by the Scriptures, that God alone searcheth, and changeth the heart of man, because he alone is the maker of it; and therefore Satan, though he be a spirit, yet can hee not by himselfe either discerne the thoughts, or alter the will of man; but in the one he obserueth the secret impressions of the soule on the bodie; and in the other he stirreth and vseth the spirits and affections of the bodie against the soule. So

that when he will put any euill thoughts into the hearts of men, as he did into Iohn 13. Iudas and Act. 5. Ananias, and dayly doth into the children of disobedience, and often time, into the godlie themselues, when he is so permitted; he can not of himselfe turne and winde the heart as pleaseth him, that is proper to God alone; but he abuseth our eares and eyes, or els he stirreth the humors and spirits of the bodie, and by tempering and mixing the resemblances of things receiued from the sense, and reserued in mans imagination, he obiecteth to the mind what he listeth, and incensing theHow the diuell may discerne and incense our affections. affections, that are likewise bodilie, he trieth whether he can draw the heart to consent. Which he discerneth not by any inward power of his owne, but by the different motions of the heart, where the will of man is seated, and according as he findeth his temptations to be either refused, or admitted in the heart of man, so he either desisteth from his lost labour, or persueth the suggestion once allowed, till the sinne be performed. S. Austen discussing how diuels could diuine at mens thoughts, and induce mens hearts, sayth: August de Diuinatione Damonum. cap. 5. 
               Suadent miris & inuisibilibus modis, corpora hominum non sentientium penetrando, sese
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   cogitationibus eorum per quaedam imaginaria visa miscendo, siue vigilantium, siue dormientium: The diuels persuade by maruellous & inuisible means, entring the bodies of men when they feele it not, and by certaine resemblances or sights of the imagination intermingling themselues with the thoughts of men, either waking or sleeping. Of discerning our thoughts, the writer of Ecclesiasticall opinions amongst S. Austens works, sayth: De ecclesiast. Dogmatibus. cap. 80. 
               Internas animae cogitationes diabolum non videre, certi sumus, sed motibus eas corporis ab illo, & affectionum indicijs colligi, experimento didicimus. We be sure the diuell seeth not the inward thoughts of the heart, yet finde we by experience, that he collecteth them by the motions of the bodie, and the shewes of mens affections. To which S. Austen agreeth: August. de Diuinatione Damonum. cap 5. 
               Sicut apparet concitatior animi motus in vultu, vt ab hominibus quo
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   aliquid forinsecus agnoscatur, quod intrinsecus agitur: Ita non debet esse incredibile, si etiam leuiores cogitationes dant aliqua signa per corpus, quae obtuso hominum sensu cognosci non possunt, acuto autem damonum possunt. As a vehement motion of the minde appeareth euen in the countenance, that men may outwardly perceiue what is inwardly purposed; so ought it not to be incredible, that the lighter thoughts of men giue some signes by the bodie, which can not be descried by the dull sense of men, but yet may be discerned by the quicke sense of diuels. By themselues then diuels can not infuse any thoughts into vs; that onely belongeth to the spirit of God; immediatly to inspire the heart of man; neither can they so much as discerne our secret thoughts, which none can do, but he that framed the heart; yet as the soule getteth her knowledge by resemblance and informance of things carried from the senses to the imagination, and thence presented to the minde: so the diuell hath his meanes to worke in the outward and inward senses, which haue corporall seats and spirits, and by the similitudes and shewes of things there found, to offer suggestions to the minde of man. Whether it be therefore the world without vs, the flesh within vs, or the diuell both without and within, that tempteth vs; our senses, imaginations and affections are the meanes which are vsed by all those three; and these haue such vnion and communion with the bodie, that after death there is no meanes for new temptations to be offered, nor new sinnes to be committed, but ech man shall receiue iudgement for the things done in the bodie, and not after or before the bodie.
            That all the thoughts of man, be they neuer so light, giue signes in the bodie, I by no meanes affirme: for so the diuels should easily discerne thoughts; and S. Austen wisely did moderate that assertion, and make some doubt, August. retract. li. 2. ca. 3. how thoughts are knowen to diuels; but in sinnes, (of which I speake, not of thoughts) it is more manifest, that the diuell hath his meanes to see, whether his temptations take place in the heart or no. For when S. Iames sayth, Iames. 4. 
               Resist the diuell, and he will flee from you; surely the diuell must see when he is resisted in the heart of man, els how shall he flee? E hes. 4. 
               Giue no place to the diuell, sayth Paul. Then doth the diuell perceiue, when place is giuen vnto him, that he may enter and possesse the heart; neither are his temptations so vainly offered, that he can not discerne when the heart imbraceth them. The soule therfore

pleased or displeased with euill, causeth certaine naturall motions and impressions on the bodie, by which the wicked spirits obserue the inclination of the heart; and that to them is as cleere, as the outward carriage of the countenance is to men, or the inward feeling of our affections is to our selues.
            Of outward motions and impressions Iesus the sonne of Syrach sayth: Eccles. 13. 
               The heart of man changeth his countenance, either to good or euill. 
               Ibid. v. 27.

               . The disposition of the soule piercing to the very outsides of the bodie, euen as the prints of the seemlinesse of the soule appeare 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , in the composed behauiour and gesture of the godly.
            
            The alterations of the bloud, and motions of the spirits within the bodie, whichAll affections make sensible alterations in the hart. the soule raiseth in all her affections, are not so open to the eye as the former, yet are they the causes of all outward mutations, and sensible enough to the parties themselues, when they grow any thing vehement. For this is Gods ordinance in all things which haue sense or reason, that good any way perceiued, should delight, stirre, and inflame the will and appetite of beasts, men and angels, with desire and loue thereof: and euill contrariwise should not onely auert and quench the will and appetite with hatred, but offend and oppresse the patient with feare and griefe. When then the soule of man vnited to her bodie, liketh any thing obiected or apprehended vnder the shew of good; she kindleth and moueth her selfe to attaine her desire, and therewithall incenseth the vitall and animall spirits, which warme the bloud, enlarge the heart, and diffuse themselues to persue, or embrace the good that is approching or present. And when she seeth any euill which she can not decline, but must endure, she staggereth, and sincketh for feare, which quencheth the spirits, cooleth the bloud, and closeth the heart, depressing all three with a slacke, colde, and heauie remisnesse. If she may withstand or requite the euill that is towards, she raiseth her selfe to anger, which maketh the bloud to boile, the heart to swell, and the spirits to flie to the outmost parts, as readie to resist or reuenge. So that LOVE and HATRED of good and euill obiected to the sense or minde of man, are the two chiefe springs of all his affections and actions; and the branches thereof, which are desire, feare, ioy, griefe and anger, moued either by the sense or vnderstanding, haue their manifest or secret alterations of the bloud, and motions of the heart, by the intension or remission of the spirits kindled, or quenched more or lesse, according as the obiect of good and euill is greater or nearer. By this meanes the soule affected and mooued with good or

euill, affecteth and moueth her bodie, and sheweth her inward disposition and inclination to either; and the heart of man, which is the seat of will, hath his naturall and different motions raised by the soule, vpon het liking or disliking of good or euill, perceiued by sense or by vnderstanding.
            These alterations and motions naturally impressed by the soule on the bodie, not onely Philosophers and Physitians haue obserued, but the Diuines of all ages, that haue waded therein, haue fully confessed. Aristotle by the rules of nature collected and inferred thus much:Arist. de animalium moti
                  
                     •…
                  ne. cap. 8. 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               . The beginning of motion is that, which in our actions must be persued or declined; and of necessitie heat and cold do follow vpon the cogitation or imagination of either. That which is grieuing, is declined; that which is pleasing, is persued. Howbeit, in small things this is scant sensible. 
               Ibid. cap. 7. 
               So that almost all things grieuing and pleasing (vs) bring with them a (sensible) kinde of colde and heat; as it is euident by our affections; the parts enlarging by heat, and shrinking with colde. This alteration, either the sense, or the imagination, or the cogitation can make. Wherefore some shake and feare onely vpon the cogitation of things. The euill or good which grieueth or pleaseth vs, bringeth naturally colde or heat to the bloud, and so enlargeth or shrinketh the heart; which alterations do come as well vpon cogitation and imagination, as vpon sense. Galene an exact and skilfull obseruer of mans bodie, writeth that the first and principall cause of shaking is theGalenus de causis Symptomatum. li. 2. cap. 5. 
               recourse of the naturall heat to the inward and outward parts, which is found in manie affections of the soule; and with the same are as well the spirits as the bloud caried sometimes inward to the fountaine (of the heart) and there compressed; sometimes extended to the outward parts, and there diffused. Those spirits and bloud, together with the heat that is in either or both, the soule vseth for her first instruments in all her operations, or els dwelleth in them; and those motions of the soule we may plainly beholde in manie other things, but chiefly in the affections of the soule. For feare presently driueth the spirits and the bloud to the inward parts, and presseth them to a narrow roome by cooling the outsides of the bodie. Anger doth hastily send forth, diffuse, and heat (the bloud and spirits) and therefore the beating of the arteries and the heart, in them that feare, are small and weake; but very great and vehement in them that are angrie.
            
            That feare doth straiten and contract the hart, and ioy dilate it and make it leape, and the signes of either preuaile and appeare in the body; the auncient Father Saint Basile did long since obserue. Basil. Homil. 4. de gratiar. Actione. 
               Teares (the effect of griefe) doe rise, saith he, when an impression against our wils doth strike the Soule, and draw it together, the spirit about the heart being compacted and straitned. Ioy is as it were the leaping of the Soule exulting (or aduancing it selfe) for things answerable to our mind. Wherefore the Soule sheweth signes in the Body accordingly. For in those that sorrow the masse of flesh is pale, wanne, and cold. In those that reioyce, the habite of their body is floorishing and ruddy, the Soule euen leaping, and for pleasure offering to rush to the outmost parts. Thomas Aquinas a man well learned, though led with the errors of his age, very truely noteth; First, Quod in

Secondly, that Quaest. 84. artic 1. in respons. 
               From the loue of temporall things all sinne proceedeth; all (our) affections being caused by loue, which 
               Quaest. 25 artic 2. quaest. 28. artic. 5. 
               melteth and mollifieth the hart, that the thing loued may pearce it, contrary to coldnesse and hardnesse of hart, which is a disposition repugnant to loue, whose perfection is to be zealous and feruent. The cause of all sinne then, which is the loue of our selues and of temporall things delighting vs, so flameth in our harts, that it seeketh all occasions, and vndertaketh all actions to content our appetites; and this heate and motion of loue being impressed in the hart by the soule, it is manifest that the consent of sinne is communicated from the Soule to the Body. Leonardus Fuchsius a learned Phisitian of our time, and a professor of true Religion, in his institutions of Phisicke sheweth, that ioy Fuchsius insti

Zanchius a wise and worthy Diuine treating of the parts of the Body, saith; Zanchius de operibus Dei part. 3. li. 2. cap. 1. Numer. 7. 
               The second vse of the hart is to impart vitall spirits specially to the head, in which the mind properly worketh, and so to minister matter whence the sensitiue spirits are produced in the braine; by which, motion, sense, and cogitations are stirred. The third vse of the hart is that it should also be the seate, fountaine, and cause of all our affections. For there are in the hart two motions, the one of pulse, to maintaine life by the ordinary breathing in and out of the ayre: the other of affection, which followeth the thought of man, and is made by the extraordinarie dilating of the whole hart, as in ioy; or compressing it, as in sorow. With sorow and griefe we pine away, with ioy we reuiue. Whereupon the hart in one affection is opened and cheered, in the other it is shut and dryed. Hereby we perceiue why the Scripture by the name of the hart vnder standeth the WILL and all the affections of man, as by the name of the minde it noteth all the thoughts and knowledge of man. Wherefore as motion, sense, and cogitations spring from the braine or head, so all affections from the hart. Then
               Ibidem. 
               from the hart ascend to the braine vitall spirits, whence sensitiue spirits are engendred. By these sensitiue spirits thoughts are mooued, and knowledge planted in the mind. Againe, those sensitiue spirits by cogitations and conceptions strike the whole hart, and kindle diuers affections, and raize diuers motions in it. And this hath great profit in Diuinitie. For besides that we vnderstand how the Soule vseth the Body, and worketh by the Body; two chiefe points of true godlinesse are illustrated by this Doctrine: the KNOVVLEDGE and LOVE of God, whence commeth obedience and the obseruance of all his commaundements. For the holy Ghost sliding into our harts first lightneth the minde, which worketh in the head, and with that effectuall knowledge kindleth in our hart the affection of loue. And from thence commeth the motion (of all the parts) to performe the will of God. By this meanes God truely dwelleth in our mind, in our hart, and in our whole Body. There is then neither good nor euill affection in the soule of man, which is not somewhat communicated to the hart of man, & expressed by the very motions of the hart; that the body may iustly be drawen by consenting and seruing in either, to the reward and punishment of either.
            The READY SVBIECTION of the Body to the Soule in all sinne is the last point that I mentioned of their mutuall communion. For though vnderstanding and will were giuen at first with all facilitie to rule and gouerne the other powers and parts of Soule and Body; yet the corruption of sinne once entering, not onely diuided the Body against the Soule, but euen the Soule against it selfe. So that in good things this corruptible Body is now an heauie burden loading the Soule, when it is lightned with grace; and the inferiour and sensitiue powers of the Soule rebell and striue against the spirit, which renueth the inward man of the hart. Some ignorance, infirmitie and selfeloue remaine still in the mind, as defects, till we come to the place, where our knowledge and loue shall be made perfect; but when we would doe good, euen then the law of sinne in our members 
               Rom. 7. REBELLETH against the law of our mind, and leadeth (vs) captiue to the law of sinne, that is in our members. The 
               Galat. 6. 
               flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh, and these are repugnant the one to the other, so that we can not doe the things which we would. For which cause the Apostle professed of himselfe, that he did 1. Cor. 9. 
               presse downe his body, and bring it into subiection; least (the Body rebelling and preuailing against the spirit) he should become a cast-away. This sharpe and strong resistance, which our earthly members make against the mind and will delighting in the law of God, and guided by his spirit, sheweth the willingnesse and readinesse of the flesh to conspire and ioyne with the WILL in the seruitude of sinne; to make her members the weapons of vnrighteousnesse; so that the will no sooner consenteth to any euill, but the sensitiue and motiue powers of the Soule permixed with the bodily spirits, attend with delight and forwardnesse to promote and execute ech sinfull purpose. This is thatEphes. 4. 
               greedinesse, which the Apostle noteth in some to vncleannesse,

from which if either feare or grace restraine, it is not without some sensible griefe to the flesh, disappointed of her desires and lusts.
            We see the manifest and manifold coniunction and communion of the soule with the bodie as well in good as in euill; which is strange to none, neither Philosophers, Physitians, nor Diuines, but onely to this Discourser, to whom all sound and true learning is strange. For not onely vertues and vices are common to both; but spirituall graces, as faith, hope, and loue, the soule in this life receiueth, perceiueth, and practiseth together with her bodie, and by her body.

               Vertue and vice, saith Athenagoras, can not so much as be conceiued in the soule without the bodie. For the vertues, that are, we know to be the vertues of men, (as also the vices that are contrarie) and not to be in the soule apart from the bodie, or consisting by her selfe. Of faith we said before, it commeth by hearing: and so doth hope, since that is expected which is beleeued. Touching

The soule then beleeuing and louing the promises and graces of God, openeth the heart and diffuseth the spirits to accept and imbrace the goodnesse of God in like maner, as she did before dilate it to entertaine the desires of earthly things; and God detesting an h

               flame: describing zeale and deuotion by the naturall motions and passions, which are felt in the heart, when it is affected with vehement and strong loue. So in repentance the soule depresseth and humbleth the heart, raising it againe with hope, which before was exalted with pride, and incensed with selfe loue; by the same naturall meanes and motions testifying the one, that she did the other, and drawing the body with the powers and parts thereof to the obedience of faith, so farre as the law of sinne lusting in the flesh will permit, and the measure of grace giuen vs doth preuaile.

But if men be taught as well errors as trueth, by their parents and masters, then this is a wodden reason to make vs beleeue, that heresies are inspired without teaching or hearing. S. Paul saith, Rom. 10. 
               Faith commeth by hearing; and so I trust you did first learne it, and not by reuelation. If we be not borne Christians in knowledge, but must be taught; no more are any men borne Iewes, Turkes, or Heretikes, but their eares and hearts must be first infected with the tongues or pennes of others. This is one of your surest weapons, wherewith you thought to doe great workes: but put it vp; at such strawes children will not stumble. The first inuenters of heresies, you will say, were not taught.] The first authors of errours shut their eyes or eares against the trueth offered them, and so declined from trueth to falsehood, by leaning rather to their owne corrupt iudgements grounded on earthly reasons, then to the voyce of God directing them aright. For why doe men disbeleeue and impugne the word of God, as all heretikes do; but because they measure diuine things, that passe their reach, by humane sense and experience, which are not gathered without the bodie? The Turkes are strangers (you thinke) to the word of God, and Atheists are vtter despisers of it.] The Turke destitute of trueth, and so notable rightly to iudge of Gods fauours in this life, bendeth his eyes on the worldly miseries of Christians, and comparing them with the victories and felicities (as he thinketh) of his owne nation, condemneth the faith of Christ, as displeasant to God, by reason of the manifold

afflictions of the faithfull, and preferreth his owne profession, and Mahomet the first erector of it as most acceptable to God, because they haue their desires in this world, and are conquerors ouer Christians, not knowing the finall reward of the one and of the other after this life.

               Further as the Angels sinned in the beginning by their meere spirituall conceit against God, so nothing letteth but that man in his Angel-like nature (the reasonable soule) may sinne likewise, without any bodily meanes thereunto.] This is another of your reasons not much vnlike the former. For in Angels, which now are deuils, their vnderstanding and will might and did sinne, because they were spirits, and other essentiall partes in them we doe not know. In men that cannot be, because they consist of bodie and soule, and haue many powers of the soule permixed with the bodie, and so must sin in both the parts of their nature, before they can sin, as the Angels did, that is, in their whole substance. If then you see no difference betweene Angels, that are only spirits, and men, that must haue bodies as well as soules, before they can be men; your Angel-like nature is not very bright. If you see the difference, and yet vrge your consequence; that is a meere spirituall conceite of yours, but vtterly voyde of all reason. For as well men as Angels must sinne in their whole natures, least whiles you place one part in hell as nocent, and the other in heauen as innocent, you bring vs as strange iudgements, as you doe doctrines. In Gods iudgement, Cyrill. in Ioan. lib. 1. cap. 9. 
               Ea solummodo quaeruntur, quae cum corpore gessit; those things onely are required, (saith Cyrill) which (man) committed with his bodie. Neither will this serue your turne, that the bodie is the instrument of the soule. For as whiles man liueth, many faculties of the soule are tempered with the bodie; so when man sinneth, the whole soule is not guiltie, if the sensitiue powers and affections of the soule be exempted from sinne. And since by Gods ordinance after Adams fall, the corruption of sinne first riseth in the bodie, the information and tentation to sinne commeth from the bodie, and the consent of the soule to sinne is impressed on the bodie, as also willing subiection to sinne is yeelded by the bodie; this is let sufficient, why the soule alone neither can, nor doeth sinne in this life without her bodie.

               Also as we can thinke well without vsing our bodie, God so inspiring vs: so may we thinke. ill (which is sinne) our inborne corrupt vnderstanding, and reason, and will moouing vs only.] If Gods power be not tied to the course of nature prescribed vs, will you thence inferre, that we are likewise freed from it? He that framed the heart, can open it, and alter it as pleaseth him; but that is no charter, for vs to chalenge any knowledge, saue what is naturally gathered with our eyes, or with our eares, or supernaturally reuealed to vs. Wisedome infused from our cradles we haue none; we KNOVV not our right hand from our left, till by time we be taught; and our teachers, be they men or Angels, must vse our outward senses, or our inward imaginations to direct and instruct vs: otherwise we can neither conceaue nor vnderstand, what they say or shew, since they can not lighten our hearts. And when God doth inspire vs with that which is good, he not onely openeth our hearts, but filleth them with the loue of his truth & goodnesse, without which 1. Cor. 13. 
               all knowledge is nothing. Now the loue of God diffused in our hearts here on earth, raiseth the selfe same inward and naturall motion of the heart, which is incident to that affection; and which other kindes of loue doe; least our hearts should be colder and slower in louing God, who requireth all the partes and powers of soule and bodie to be deuoted to his loue, then they were in affecting and louing the world. So that first your Antecedent is false; for things inspired must be embraced with the whole heart, before they can please God; and your consequent is

things that be euill, to the naturall course of our corrupt condition, which receaueth sinne from the soule and bodie, and imparteth it vnto both, that neither scape vnpunished.

               If the Soules operations were so necessarily tied to the faculties and instruments of the body, as you doe auouch, I greatly doubt how the Soules immortalitie will be defended against the effect of your assertion.] I giue the body no essentiall cooperation with the Soule in vnderstanding and will; I giue it a prouocation, impression, subiection, and execution in euill, which argueth a communion with the Soule in sinne, though vnderstanding and will bee the proper actions of the Soule. Now if the soule, so long as shee is ioyned with her body, communicate her sinfull operations to the body, is that any proofe shee can not bee seuered from the body? Children in their cradles haue no knowledge of good and euill. Shall they therefore remaine children for euer in minde, and not discerne either their happinesse in heauen, or their wretchednesse in hell? What here they want because the soule is coupled with the body, shall there be supplied, when the soule is parted from the body. Here the soule seeth with the eyes, heareth with the eares, and speaketh with the tongue; but after this life our Sauiour teacheth vs, that the Soule shall see, heare, and speake after an other maner, as spirits doe, though shee want eyes, eares and tongue. Here the soule can not mooue from place to place, but with her body: when shee is seuered, shee shall be caried to Paradise, or hell without her body. Here the passions of the Soule, desire, ioy, feare, and sorrow are common to both parts of man: hereafter they shalbe proper to the soule, so long as shee abideth vncoupled to the body. Here foolishnesse, madnesse, forgetfulnesse, sicknesse, wearinesse, do hinder the operations of the soule: there shall bee no such thing. Here the soule sinneth, repenteth, and beleeueth: there is no place, nor power to commit new sinnes, nor to repent the olde. S. Austen sayth thereof. August. in Ench

               Istis voluntas, illis facultas non poterit esse vlla peccandi. The Saued can haue no will, the Damned no power to sinne. So that the condition of the Soule seuered from the body, much differeth from the state of the soule ioyned with the body; and though shee communicate her actions good and bad in this life to her body, yet in the next shee shall vse her vnderstanding and will, and feele her affections and passions without her body.

               Surely it bringeth in the heresie of Pope Iohn the two and twentieth, and of certaine Anabaptists, that the Soule hath no being till shee resume her body at the last day.] Your ignorance is no argument to bring the soule a sleepe, till shee resume her body. Shee hath no seueral being from her body in this life, for that Man consisteth of soule and body vnited and ioyned together. Shall shee therefore not bee seuered, or haue no being, when shee is seuered? Are you a Diuine and doe not know, that God hath so framed the Soule, that shee may be vnited to the body, and also seuered from the bodie, without losse of her essentiall powers, which yet during this life are seated in the body, and in some sort assisted by the body? The very faculties of sense and motion, which are permixed with the body, and can not be exercised but in the body, retaine their roote and force still in the Soule, when their operation ceaseth for want of the body. To gather knowledge, and declare consent, the Soule heere vseth the spirits and parts of the body; yet after this life her vnderstanding and will shall not onely persist the same, which they were, but be exceedingly encreased and confirmed. For 
               1. Cor. 13. 
               now we see through a glasse darkely, but then face to face. Now we know in part; but then shall we know, euen as we are knowen. Yea loue and ioy, which here are discerned by the motion of the heart, and alteration of the spirits, shall there bee most perfect, and neuer fall away. So that your doubt of Pope Iohns heresie to be consequent to my position, is a drowsie slumber of your distempered braine, it hath no coherence with any conclusions or assertions of mine.

               Hence is it, that you say, Gods iustice punisheth the soule (onely) by the body, that is, not till the resurrection.] You can hatch errours foule enough, and fast enough, if you may be suffered to adde and alter, what pleaseth you, in other mens words. Betweene the

professions of Arians & Christians, there was but a diphthongs difference,

What heresie then may you not come by adding (ONLY) to my words, which I precisely did decline; and made a manifest exception against it, lest any should suspect it? Giue me the like libertie in your words, and I will find you holes in euery leafe to harbor the grossest heresies, that euer were heard of in Turke or Pagan. But Sir, this is the diuels occupation, plainely to peruert the words, that otherwise containe nothing in them but the trueth. That the

               iustice of God both temporally and eternally punisheth the soule by the bodie, which are my words, is a notorious and manifest trueth: for he punisheth temporally in this world, and eternally in the world to come after that sort; so that no man is so doltish as to doubt thereof. That God neuer punisheth otherwise in this life, nor the next, but (ONLY) so, this is your exorbitant imagination, it is no conclusion depending on my words, much lesse any part expressed in them. Defenc. pa. 62. li. 38. 
               In trueth thus you must needs affirme and holde, you can not auoid it, if you will hold your maine question.] In trueth your Mastership is mis-sighted; I do not see, nor you do not shew, how any such thing is consequent to my question. The absurditie, with which you would intangle me, that Defenc. pag. 63. li. 3. 
               els God did not properly punish Christ for our sins, is weaker than a spiders webbe. The proper punishment of sinne, without respect to persons, is spirituall, temporall, and eternall death; which Christ could not suffer. The full satisfaction and punishment of our sinnes in Christes person, was the death of his bodie suffered on the crosse, with those paines preceding and accompanying it which are described in the Scriptures. And this is so euident and easie, that besides such conceited Sirs as you are, few do or need doubt it.
            
               Defenc. pa. 61. li. 11. 
               If I grant this point of heathen Philosophie, that the Soule taketh occasion to thinke all things, which she thinketh, vniuersally from the Body and bodily obiects, yet it followeth not,
               The meanes of mans knowledge. 
               that she taketh occasion to mis-thinke from thence also.] Doe you call that heathen Philosophie, which is so plainely perceaued by nature, so fully confirmed by Scripture, and so vniuersally confessed on all sides, that the very Heathen could not gainesay it? Tell vs I pray you, if you haue lately lighted on any new way, how Man may come to knowledge, but either from sense, or by reuelation. Our Sauiour knew no more waies, when he said to Peter, Matth. 16. 
               Flesh and blood hath not reuealed it vnto thee, but my Father which is in Heauen. Where men, that are teachers or learners, are called flesh and blood, because without the Body the Soule learneth nothing in this life, but what is reuealed vnto it by the spirit of God. Saint Iohn knew as few. 1. Ioh. 1. v. 3. 
               That (saith he) which we haue seene, and heard, declare we vnto you, that you also may haue fellowship with vs. This a man would thinke were plaine enough, that all knowledge must be either naturally infused in vs, as it was in Angels; or collected of vs by sense and experience, or reuealed to vs from God. For if we be borne voide of all knowledge, as the Scripture expresly testifieth we know not (at first) our right hand from our left; then must we get it by meanes. And meanes to come by the knowledge of particular and externall things, what can you assigne besides the sense? If therefore the Heathen saw this, and you see it not, you prooue your selfe to haue lesse vnderstanding then the Heathen. The Soule indeede by the power of vnderstanding and reason wherewith she is endued of God, doth in continuance obserue, discerne, and compare the agreements and contrarieties of things, as also their causes and consequents; and what of her selfe she can not perceaue, she learneth with more ease of others, who are longer and better acquainted therewith, and whose phantasiue spirits are thinner and quicker to pearce into the depth of things. The differences then and defects of mens wits doe cleerele witnesse, that not onely the instruments of sense, but the Imaginatiue spirits must concurre to attaine and encrease knowledge in this life, vnlesse God inspire the Hart aboue nature; which he doth when and where pleaseth him.
            These may be the meanes of thinking, and yet not the causes or occasions of misthinking.] The naturall meanes of thinking must still be the meanes of well and ill thinking: they varie not, howsoeuer the minde varie in her resolutions. What or

how manie may be the causes or occasions of ill thoughts, maketh nothing to this question; it sufficeth for my purpose, to make the bodie liable to the punishment of euery sinne, that the parts, powers, or spirits of the Body haue any communion with the suggesting, admitting, or performing of ech sinne. For in all sinne not onely the Doers, but the leaders, directors, aduisers, helpers, consenters, allowers, and reioycers are in their degree partners with the principall. Yea all the instruments are iustly detested, where the crime is worthily condemned. But whence ill thinking commeth, can you tell? A man may thinke and speake of all the errors and heresies in the world, and yet not sinne. It is the liking and embracing of them, that maketh the offence, and not thinking or reasoning of them. The will then causeth thoughts to be good or euill, the vnderstanding doth not. Now the will must haue somewhat to lead it, which is either the show of truth, or the loue of some other thing, which doth preiudice the truth. There is no truth but in the word of God, which we must either heare or read, before we can apprehend. If we stop our eares against the word of God, shall not that wilfull deafenesse of ours turne to the deserued destruction of Body and Soule? If we open our eares, but not our harts to the voice of God, doth not the loue of some earthly good, or feare of some temporall harme close our harts against the truth? Both which, as well loue as feare, come from the bodily senses and affections, and make their manifest impression on the hart, leading the will to consent to their law. For where all ill thoughts are against veritie, charitie, or temperance; men are ledde from the truth, by August. de vtilitate

Lamenesse maketh a creeple to halt, it prouoketh him not. And so doth pitch defile the hands, and not prouoke them to fowlenesse. The next and necessarie causes of things are called efficients, and not provocations. So that will you, nill you, prouocations are externall either to the person, or to the part, that is the principall, or speciall Agent. The Apostle teacheth you how to vse the word properly, when he saith, Galat 5. 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , prouoking one an other. The very composition of the word proueth as much, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , or prouocare, is first to call or vrge a man to any thing, before he him selfe be willing. Then the naturall and inward corruption of the minde is no prouocation, but the cause ef
                  •…
               cient of ill thoughts; and if there be any prouocations, they must be externall to the part, or partie prouoked. And did you know the principles of learning, or grounds of nature, you would soone perceaue, that as well the will of man, as his desire is led with respect of somewhat, that is good, or at least seemeth good, which prouoketh and draweth both sense, and will to performe her actions. Now though the desire Antecedent, and delight consequent be inward and inherent, yet the good things which we affect, and would attaine, are then externall when we pursue them; and when we vse them or enioy them, they are but conioyned with vs in possession or opinion, which contenteth both Body and Soule.
            As you do not vnderstand what PROVOCATION meaneth; so do you lesse perccaue what PLEASVRE is. You mingle Soule and sense, head and heeles together to make some shew of opposition; but in the end you bewray your presumptuous ignorance, and daube it ouer with your wonted words of PROPER & MEERE, which are as much to this purpose, as salt to make sugar.

But notwithstanding your toying with termes, that is properly PLEASVRE, which the soule taketh by or from the bodie. Cicero the father of the Latine tongue disputing of pleasure, sayth resolutely: Cicero de finibus bonorum & malorum. li. 2. 
               Omnes iucundum motum, quo sensus hilaretur, Graecè

               , Latine voluptatem vocant. All men both in Greeke and Latine call that pleasing motion wherewith the sense is delighted, Pleasure. And againe: Ibidem. 
               In eo voluptas omnium Latinè loquentium more ponitur, quum percipitur ea, quae sensum aliquem moue at, iucunditas. That is called pleasure by the vse of all that speake Latine, when any delight is felt which moueth some of the senses.

            And did not the word pleasure alone without addition signifie the delights of the senses, as by these Philosophers and Diuines we see it doth; yet the soule taketh no delight, which the Scriptures do properly call gladnesse and ioy, but she doth communicate the same to her bodie; insomuch that the Scriptures expresse the delight and ioy of the soule by the mouing and leaping of the heart, as it doth sorow by the shrinking and gathering together of the heart.

               , and shrinking of the heart, that is, sorow, which contracteth and shrinketh the heart together. A better proofe, that soule and bodie do communicate together in ioy and griefe, we can not haue, than that life and death thereon doe depend. Eccles. 30. 
               The ioy of heart is the life of man, and sorrow hath slaine manie. Which Salomon confirmeth, saying; Pro. 17.

So that all delight of the minde in sinne, which you call pleasure, if it affect the soule, it is communicated to the bodie: if it be so small, that it pierceth not the soule, nor moueth the heart, it deserueth none of those names.
            In examining the acts of sinne, you keepe the same course that you do in the rest; you light on a licentious phrase, and publish that for a proofe. For where I sayd, all acts of sinne the soule committeth by her bodie, by acts noting deeds, which the soule can not performe without her bodie; you tell vs, the soule can

minde, and incensing the will with their delights and desires, were not sinfull as well as the minde? It is the Soule, that taketh her pleasures of sinne, as well by her senses, as by her vnderstanding; and to that end setteth her sensitiue powers on worke; the naturall action of the vnderstanding is no more sinfull in it selfe, then is the sense; but the corruption of the Soule abuseth them both in their kinds to content her sinfull appetites. Though then the senses bee not the very causes of sinne, which resteth chiefely in the will, yet since the Soule ioyneth her selfe vnto the powers of sense by them to imbrace and enioy the pleasures of this life aboue or against the loue of God, at least they must be occasions of sinne, if they be no more.

               you to affirme that the Soule committeth all acts of sinne by the body, and that God did not forbid Adam to like or desire that fruite, is more then strange doctrine.] In you nothing is strange, no not new hels, new heauens, new deathes of the Soule, and new redemptions of mankind, vnknowen to the Scriptures and all the fathers of Christes Church; but vnto you euerie thing is strange, that fitteth not your distempered taste.

What diuersitie finde ye betwixt them, saue that I say soule for spirit, bodie for flesh, all for whatsoeuer, and acts for things affected? my words being somewhat plainer and easier than Cyprians, and for ought that I see, hauing no disagreement? The other words, that God did not forbid Adam to like the fruit, smell of your owne forge, which reporteth nothing truely. For to prooue, that Adam transgressed the commandement with more than his minde, I obserued, that God did not say to Adam, Thou shalt not like it, which the soule of Adam did, but Thou shalt not eat thereof. Which precept since Adam did wholly violate, it followeth, he sinned with his hand & mouth, and not with his minde alone. You clippe off that which I concluded; and neglecting the affirmatiue which I adioyned, you note the negatiue, which I did not simplie exclude, but augmented with an addition of another part, that Adam sinned also with his bodie, and therefore not with his soule alone, or without his bodie.

                  . For Christ heere meaneth not by heart any part of the bodie, but meerely the minde and soule of man, and that with opposition to the bodie in this case of sinning.] You found in your Note-booke, that the heart of man is taken in the Scriptures for his will and affection moued with knowledge either from the vnderstanding or from the sense; but the reason why it is so vsed, you neuer read, or doe not remember. For if a man should aske you, why the hart of man rather then his hand or his heele doth import in the Scriptures his knowledge and will, what answere would you frame? That it is a figure of speech without all reason or cause? Such indeed are your figures, but the holy Ghost vseth no such. The Scriptures by the parts of mans body expresse the powers of mans soule, there seating, and there working: as sight, by the eye; hearing by the eare; speaking, by the tongue; going, by the feete; doing, by the hand; lusting, by the raines; and many such. The very same reason causeth the hart of man to be taken in the Scriptures for his will, which is seated in that part, and by which all his cogitations, affections, and Actions are made good or euill. So that the vse of the hart in the sacred Scriptures well considered, doth first plainely prooue, that the chiefe Seate of the Soule is the hart; and next that there it worketh, where it dwelleth, euen in the hart, and on that part impresseth all her affections & resolutions, when they once grow to be liked or disliked. And this is so farre from opposition to the Body in cause of sinning, that it doth manifestly communicate sinne vnto the Body.

Our Sauiour doth not say, the Body sinneth not; But Matth. 15. 
               that which goeth into the mouth, or

                  •…
               ot. How good this argument is, I leaue to your friends and your selfe to consider. But you farder inferre; That which commeth out of man, defileth man, ergo, the Body sinned not at all, no not in grosse facts, except as an Instrument. This is figuratiue Logicke, to make the consequent cleane contrarie to the Antecedent. Out of our Sauiours words, that which commeth out of man, defileth man, it rightly followeth, that sinne comming from the hart defileth man, to wit, the whole man, and so both Body and Soule. For man is not this or that part of man, but the person composed of both. Who then besides you vpon these words of Christ, that murders, adulteries, thefts, lyes, and slaunders defile a man, would conclude that these defile not the Body, or else though they defile the Body, yet that sinneth not, as if Christ spake here of any pollution, but of sinne? The Body you say, sinneth not, except as an Instrument.] How the Body sinneth we neede not discusse, so long as it is cleere by our Sauiours voice, that the sinne of the hart defileth the Body, as well as the Soule, that is the whole man; more I doe not affirme, not require. And so much doe euill thoughts, no lesse then euill deeds by the position of our Sauiour; euen they defile the man, as well as adulteries, thefts, murders, and such like. Your admitting at last the Body to be an Instrument of sinne, doth rather strengthen then weaken mine Assertion. For since the Body is no dead but a liuing instrument, and so capable of pleasure in sinne, as also of paine in punishment, it iustifieth my Collection, that sinne is common both to Body and Soule, and the satisfaction for sinne must likewise be common to both. But yet as I obserued, the ancient Fathers haue in this Question comprised in the name of the Body the powers of life and sense permixed with the Body, as also the sensitiue desires and affections, which sometimes obey, and sometimes rebell against the mind; and these in man are not onely capable of sinne, but the causes of sinne; and in that respect the Body with his sensitiue powers and desires is more then an Instrument.

                   other times.] To let the simpler sort see that the Soule doth not sinne in her vnderstanding and will without coniunction with her Body, and some concurrence of her Body; I specified three or foure cases open to all mens eyes, as sleepe, frensies, Lethargies, Apoplexies, which are often so strong that they leaue in man no vse of sense, reason, memorie, nor will, whereby he may or doth sinne. To this you answere, Peraduenture (the Soule) then considereth more freely in it selfe and by it selfe, then when the Body setteth it on worke.] A Resolution without peraduenture agreeable to the rest of your Doctrines; that men depriued of their senses, wits, and memories, perhaps perceiue more, iudge righter, and remember better, then when they were indued with all three. Surely if madnesse with you may be sobrietie, if Lethargie may be memorie, if the ouerwhelming of sense, reason and remembrance as in strong Apoplexies, may be the encreasing of them, you shall doe well to professe this new Phisicke, with your new Diuinitie, that it may shew the perfection of your puritie. Many such Conclusions will driue vs to thinke, that your considerations are wiser, when you sleepe, then when you wake. If this conceite be true, you were best perswade men to runne out of their wits, or to desire and procure Lethargies and Apoplexies as much as they can, that their Soules may be then more considerate. What it pleaseth God sometime to reueale or shew to men in sleepes and traunces, we are not to meddle with; they are things to vs vnknowen; the naturall and ordinarie course of vnderstanding and remembring appointed by God for men is that, which we reason of; and that is often so stopped and hindred by sicknesse or violence, that neither reason, memorie, nor will can rightly performe their functions. Which is so well knowne not onely to Philosophers and Phisitians acknowledging strong Lethargies and Apoplexies to be the decay, and sometimes the ouerthrow of reason and memorie, but vnto Diuines, that

with one consent they grant men oppressed with violent furie, or naturall follie not alwayes to sinne in their actions, no not of murder, adulterie, theft, and blasphemie, for want of iudgement and memorie to direct their willes.
            But how commeth this sudden change in you now to confesse, that the bodie setteth the soule a worke in her thoughts or considerations, good or badde, who not ten l

Next in those that vse it, straight vpon meat, (whiles sleepe is sound) they dreame not, but vpon distribution and reuocation of the naturall heat vp to the head. Thirdly, in dreames (except they be from God) it is certaine that mens imaginations, which haue corporall spirits and seats, worke as well as their minde; and so the operation of the soule in sleepe is no way continuall, nor excludeth the bodie, though the outward and common sense be bound and oppressed with sleepe. And euen the first ordaining of sleepe for man by God proueth, that in meditation & contemplation the spirits of the braine (which are aeriall, yet corporall) are vsed by the soule in this life. For with inward and earnest intension of the minde and vnderstanding those spirits waxe hoat and drie, and therefore of necessitie must be cooled and tempered with sleepe; otherwise if men lacke sleepe long, frensie disturbeth both reason and remembrance.

                  rily on the bodie, the doubt is how she may be separated from the bodie.] The power, by which the soule discerneth and iudgeth of things offered by sense, or by reuelation, is internall and essentiall, so that when she is seuered, she is fully possessed of that facultie as part of her nature. The meanes, by which she commeth to the knowledge of externall and particular things in this life, are naturally her senses and spirits, by which she worketh in the body; supernaturally the power of God, which now and hereafter lightneth the eyes of the soule, and not onely continueth her knowledge here obtained, but increaseth the same, and representeth to the mind and conscience all things good or bad here obscured, neglected, or forgotten. The separation of the soule from the bodie, and her knowledge after this life, depend not vpon her naturall power and strength, but vpon the worde and hand of God, who can Heb. 4. 
               diuide the spirit from the soule euen in this life, and either take or giue both sense and reason, from her or to her as pleaseth him. From Nabuchodonoser God tooke all cogitation and operation of humane reason and sense; hee doth the same to others, when it liketh him. Paul liuing was rapt 2. Cor. 12. 
               into the third heauen, whether in the bodie, or out of the bodie, he could not tell; (but either way was easie to God:) as also Iohn, when he was in the bodie, was willed to 
               Reuel. 4. 
               ascend vp to heauen, and was there in his spirit, his bodie not dying in the meane space, whiles his spirit was absent.

To children that vtterly know nothing in this life, God will giue exact and perfect knowledge of their States, by reuealing vnto them either his mercies, or their miseries. In vs all God will 1. Corin. 4. 
               lighten the secrets of darkenesse; and as he is trueth, so suffer no trueth to lie hid in his presence. We shall not onely remember all the workes of our hands, and 1. Corin. 4. 
               counsels of our hearts, which now we haue forgotten, but we shall see each others deedes and thoughts, which is no way possible for our naturall abilitie, so farre as shall be needefull for the declaration of his iust iudgement. For Luke 8. 
               nothing is secret, that shall not be open, neither is there any thing hid, that shall not be knowen, and come to light. Therefore neuer doubt, whether the soule hauing left her naturall and corporall meanes of knowledge shall sleepe till the day of resurrection, shee shall haue an other manner of knowledge, then here shee had, either to her euerlasting comfort or confusion. She shall then perceiue and discerne the things, which 1. Cor. 2.

Howbeit neither the separation nor intellection of the soule pertaine directly to this question.

It seemeth, you say, Tertullian cited the reasons of the Heretikes houlding the soule slept till the last iudgement.] It is past seeming, that either your eyes were not open, when you reade that place of Tertullian, or your wits so weake, that you could not vnderstand your Authour. Tertullian in that booke speaketh not one word of the sleeping or not sleeping of the soule till iudgement; hee directeth his whole discourse against such as denied the resurrection of the flesh, and therfore held the soule alone after this life should euer lastingly be rewarded, or punished without the societie of her bodie. To reprooue that heresie, which is the ouerthrowe of all Christianitie, Tertullian diuideth his Treatise into two principle parts; the reasons inducing, and the promises in the Scriptures assuring the resurrection of the bodie. The reasons inducing it he recalleth to three chiefe stemmes. For where the Heretikes to discredite the resurrection of the flesh, opposed the 1 basenes of the flesh vnworthy to rise; 2 the distruction of the flesh by fire, water, deuouring, rotting and such like, as impossible to be restored; 3 the dulnesse of the flesh, as hauing neither will, wisedome, or sense of it selfe, but being onely the vessell of the soule, and so subiect to no punishment, in that it is guiltie of no sinne: Tertullian to surprise them in their owne principles, produceth the number of honours that God hath done to mans flesh in this life, the examples of Gods power reuiuing things dead, and restoring things perished, and the rule of Gods iustice, which must not acquit the bodie, that is partner with the soule in all her actions. The first part he concludeth in these words. Tertull. de  resurrectione car

againe, that so many waies belongeth to God? The second part he bindeth vp in this wise: Tertullianus ibide
                     •…
                  . ca. 12. 
               All things returne to the state which they lost; all begin when they cease, and therefore are ended, that they may be renued. Nothing perisheth, but to be kept. This whole course of things (in heauen and earth) is a witnesse of the Resurrection of the dead. God did first worke it, before he did write it; he declared his power, before he spake the word. He sent nature to teach thee, that thou mightst the more easily beleeue prophesie, being first the Disciple of Nature; and not doubt, that God could raise the flesh, whom thou knowest to restore all things. And if all things rise againe to man, for whom they were made, and not to man, except to his flesh; what an absurditie is it, that the flesh should vtterly perish, for whose sake, and to whose vse nothing perisheth?
            
            Before he entreth the third part, he maketh this preface. Tertullianus ibide
                     •…
                  . ca. 14. 
               Exorsi sumus ab AVTHORITATE carnis, de hinc prosecuti de POTENTIA dei: velim etiam de CAVSA requiras: quia subest dicere, & si caro capax restitui, & si diuinitas idonea restituendi, sed ca

                  sse debebit. We began with the ESTIMATION of the flesh, whether that being perished were meete to be restored; we then handled the POVVER of God, whether that be so great, as vseth to repaire things decayed: Now if both those bee admitted, I would haue you require the CAVSE, whether there be any so waightie, as to make the resurrection of the flesh necessarie, and euery way answerable to reason; for that wee may say, though the flesh be fit to be restored, and God able to restore it, yet there ought to be a cause why it should bee restored. The cause of resurrection, Tertullian persueth plainely, pithily, purposely in three whole Chapters; expresly and directly teaching, that the whole man must bee iudged, to wit both body and soule, because the whole man liued, and ioyned in euery action. Ibid. ca. 1
                     •…
                  . 
               This is the whole cause (saith he) yea the necessitie of the resurrection, most agreeable to God, the appointing of iudgement. For that, which must bee iudged, must be raised. The iudgement of God we affirme must be beleeued to bee full and perfect, as it is finall, and euer after perpetuall; and therefore the fulnesse and perfection of iudgement not to be without the representing of the WHOLE MAN. Now the whole man consisteth in the mixture of two substances, and so must bee presented to iudgement in both, since the whole must be iudged. Such then as he li
                     •…
                  d. such must he be iudged, because he must bee iudged for his doings whiles he liued. Descending then to shew that the Soule and body ioyned in all things good and bad here on earth, and taxing his aduersaries the heretickes as absurd, for diuiding the body from the Soule in the actions of this life; hee thus chalengeth them in the very next words: Tertullianus ibidem. 15.

Non sit particeps in sententia caro, si non fuerit & in causa. Goe on then, let our aduersaries first seuer the ioynture of body and Soule in the administration of this life, that so they may dare to part the same in the Remuneration of this life. Let them denie the fellowship of actions, that they may iustly de

                  e the reward thereof. Let not the flesh bee partner in the sentence (of iudgement) if it were not companion in the cause (or desert.) But so farre is it, that the Soule alone did passe this life, that we doe not exempt thoughts, though sole, and not brought to effect, from the communion of the flesh. For in the flesh, and with the flesh, and by the flesh, is that done of the Soule, which is done in the hart. This part of the flesh, as the chiefe castle of the Soule, the Lord taxeth, when he reproueth thoughts, (saying) Why thinke you euill in your harts? And againe, He that beholdeth a woman to desire her, hath committed adulterie in his hart. So that thought without deed or effect, is the act of the flesh. Neuer is the Soule without the flesh, so long as she is in the flesh. She doth euery thing with the flesh, without which she is not. Looke then whether thoughts also be administred by the flesh, which are outwardly perceiued by the flesh. Let the soule reuolue any thing (with her selfe,) the countenance maketh shew thereof. Let them deny the fellowship of facts, when they cannot deny the fellowship of thoughts, (betweene the Body and the Soule.) Thus stand Tertullians words. I aske now the simplest Reader that is, whether the ancient writer ernestly pursue his maine and coherent matter against his Aduersaries the Heretikes, or whether he alleadge their reasons against himselfe. The Discourser could not see the wood for trees; but like a

It is NOT FVLL, because the one halfe of man is absent: it is NOT FINALL, because an other iudgement and sentence shall follow after: it is NOT PERPETVALL, because it dureth but till the resurrection, when both soule and bodie shall be cast into euerlasting fire: it is NOT GENERALL, because such of the wicked, as liue when Christ shall come to iudge the quicke and dead, shall not haue their soules punished apart from their bodies.

Neither

doth Tertullian call this punishment of the soule without the bodie simplie or absolutely IVDGEMENT, but the TASTE or SHEVV of iudgement. Hilarie saith rightly of it. Hilarius in Psal. n. 2. 
               The day of iudgement is the repaying of eternall ioy or paine. The time of death in the meane space hath euery one tied to his state, dum ad iudicium vnumquemque aut Abraham reseruat, aut poena; Whiles either Paradise, or punishment keepeth euery man for iudgement. So Tertullian Tertull. de anima. cap. 58. 
               Cur non putes animam & puniri & foueri in inferis sub expectatione vtriusque iudicij in quadam vsurpatione & candida eius? Why shouldest thou not thinke the Soule to be comforted and punished below in the earth vnder the expectation of either iudgement (of eternall happinesse or cursednesse) in a kind of vsurping and foreshewing thereof?

            Tertullian confesseth that the Soule doth 
               De anima. cap 58. 
               not diuide all her works with the ministerie of the flesh, and that the Diuine censure doth pursue the onely thoughts and bare Wills of men. And therefore he saith, Ibidem. ca. 40 
               Sensus delictorum etiam sine affectibus imputari solent anime. The very purposes (or desires) of sinne without their effects are imputed vnto the Soule.] When Tertullian speaketh of sinne committed by the Soule alone without the Body or the helpe thereof, he meaneth without any EXTERNALL PART of the Bodie concurring thereto; as in outward facts, when hands, or feete, or other members of the Body are imployed to bring the sinne to a sensible act and effect. Take his owne example in both these places. Ibidem. cap. 40. & 58. 
               Qui viderit ad concupiscendum, iam adulterauit in corde. He that seeth a woman to desire her, hath committed adulterie in his hart. Is any man so childish as to thinke, the Soule can see or desire a woman without corporall sense or concupiscence? There is then in that case plainly the concurrence of the eyes and affections, which are bodily; but yet because the Act is not accomplished, the sinne remayneth in the hart alone, and proceedeth not vnto the DEEDE. And so diuiding sinnes into thoughts, words, and deeds, as Saint Austen and other Diuines doe, when words and deeds are forborne, they often say that men sinne in thoughts alone; but this doth not exclude the inward coniunction and communion of the Soule with the Body in sinne, which is denied to be corporall, because it is not open to the sense Notwithstanding the powers of the Soule vsed therein are permixed with the spirits of the Body, which are corporall in comparison of the Soule, though spirituall in respect of the grossenes of the flesh, in that they are aeriall, and approch the nature and purenes of ayre, to which the word spirit is vsually applyed. So that the diuerse taking of the Body, sometimes for the outward masse of flesh subiected to sense, sometimes for the inward powers of life and sense tempered with the body, causeth this difference of speech in Tertullian and the rest of the fathers; who all concurre in this, that except the body haue life and sense, the Soule can commit no actuall sinne. For we must not onely be liuing, but awaked and aduised, before wee can voluntarily runne into sinne. Of sleepe, which bereaueth vs of sense, I haue spoken before; of death, which taketh life from vs, it is also certaine that thereby sinne ceaseth in vs.

               Apostle speaketh of the effect of death, which maketh vs when we are dead, necessarily to cease from the actions of this life, and consequently from sinne. So that leroms conclusion is very true. The 
               Hierony in Ecclesiast. ca. 9. 
               dead are able to adde nothing to that, which they brought with them out of this life. For neither can they doe well, nor sinne, neither encrease vertues nor vices. If then the Soule can not sinne, except the body haue life and sense, (for neither in death, nor sleepe men doe sinne) without question the body must concurre to the committing of all sinne; and the action is common to both. And if not onely life and sense be required in the body, but intelligence and remembrance to discerne good from euill, must remaine vnperished, before the Soule can sinne, (for otherwise Insants, mad men, and others stroken with Lethargies, Epilepsies, and Apoplexies, should doe nothing but sinne, by continuall omitting of good, if not committing of euill) and these naturall infirmities, or violent distempers of the braines come from the body, and ouerwhelme the actions of reason and memorie; how can the body bee excluded from the communion of all sinne, whose parts and spirits, if they bee inflamed or obstructed, doe excuse men from sinne, by hindering the iudgement of good and euill? And where no sinne is committed, but that which is either embraced with loue and delight, or else inforced with feare and dislike; and all these haue their sensible impressions and motions in the heart; how should the body bee free from any sinne, which hath his manifest delectation and contentation in euery sinne, bee it neuer so inward and spirituall? Howsoeuer then your vnlearned and vnbridled humour pronounce this Doctrine to bee exceeding vntrue and hurtfull, and more then strange, and euen hereticall; it is a faire, plaine, and Christian trueth, that all sinne in man is common to body and Soule, and that as both parts do ioyne in the committing of each sinne, so shall both bee coupled in the punishment of each sinne; though the Soule, as shee first beginneth, and most affecteth sinne, whether by her sense, or vnderstanding; so shall shee first taste, and most feele the iust iudgement of God against sinne.
            Lastly you contradict your selfe. For you graunt, that the Soule hath 
               Defenc. pa. 64. li. 10. 
               some sufferings in this life and the next, which come not by the body.] I graunt it indeede; and therefore your impudencie is the more, who by adding (onely) to my former words would make mee say the contrarie. I Ibidem li. 15 
               suppose you denied before the Soules punishment without the body.] Where and what are my words that make the deniall? You and your friends haue skanned them often, and neere enough; shew them, or else your supposing will prooue by your leaue but a shamelesse inforcing. The strongest words, that I haue sounding that way, are these; Conclus. pag. 254. li. 
                     •…
                  ima. 
               The iustice of God both temporally and eternally punisheth the Soule by the body. Which words are apparently sound and true; and therefore you could not falsifie them, but by putting (onely) of your owne vnto them, which was no part of my speech nor intent. Defenc. pag. 64. li. 19. 
               Seeing now you graunt it, therefore it followeth by your owne words, that the wicked sinned meerely in and by their Soules.] It is a world to heare a man conclude so much, and conceiue so little. For first though the Soule bee punished without the body, yet is that not the full punishment of sinne (which is and must bee eternall) for want of the body; and therefore this reason is rightly returned on your owne head. For if the body (as you say) doe not sinne at all, then should the Soule euerlastingly bee punished without the body. But that is expresse heresie, gainesaying the resurrection and condemnation of the body to euerlasting fire. Since then the punishment of the Soule is not full without the body, it is a necessarie point of Christian truth, that the body did sinne as well as the Soule; otherwise it should vniustly be punished together with the Soule. Againe, what if the body before Iudgement bee not punished in the same place, nor with the same paine that the Soule is; is that a consequent, the body is free from all punishment of sinne? As though priuation of life, corruption to dust, subiection to the curse, and obligation to eternall fire were no punishments, which are allotted to the body for the time, till the day of generall resurrection and iudgement. Wherefore this reason also recuyleth vpon you. For if the bodies of the wicked, when they bee seuered from their

Soules, are not exempted from some punishment of sinne; that rather inferreth the body was partner with the Soule in sinne, then vtterly innocent, as you would haue it.

               sound this is I wot not, where you yeelde none other reall and positiue punishment now to the Damned, but remorse and remembrance of sinne onely, as it seemeth.] What talke you of soundnesse, till you shew your selfe to haue more sense in matters of Religion? To repeate all the paines, which the damned doe suffer, would trouble your wits; and if I could doe it, to what purpose were it? I said, the Soule seuered from her Body was punished in hell with theConclus. pa. 257. li. 19.

               besides the paine of fire, which torment is vnspeakable. Your eyes did not serue you to see those words, besides the paine of fire; You vouch, I yeeld no punishment to the damned now but remorse and remembrance of sinne ONLY.] Let your discrete Readeriudge, what dealing this is, and how well you deserue to be beleeued vpon your word. The fire of hell you will say, is no reall nor positiue punishment.] The triall of that will cost you deere, you were best forbeare your dreames, till you bring your proofes. You would haue, if I ghesse right at your meaning, immediate paine from the hand of God tormenting Soules in hell: but when you prooue, that God is not able as well with meanes to punish the Soules of the wicked, as without meanes; and that the fire of hell so often threatned in the Scriptures, is but a figure of speech to make vs afraid, we wil harken after your new reall and positiue punishments, which you so highly esteem, because they are deuised by your selfe.
            In saying that Christ was not free from some proper punishments to his Soule, as sorow and
               Pain. proper to the Soule, is not by and by the paines of hell.

That sorrow and feare for what causes soeuer are punishments of our first sinne inflicted on Adam and all his posteritie, whiles here they liue, is newes to none, but to you.

               feare in the Soule of Christ by the witnesse of the Gospell, though the cause thereof be not expressed, I resolued that Christ tasted these, which were punishments of sin by their first institution, as well as other our infirmities of Soule and Body. What followeth hereupon? That
               Defenc. pa. 64. li. 28. 
               these were proper punishments inflicted on Christ by Gods very wrath.] Who saith so? You or I? They are your words in deed, but no way mine. It followeth, you say, euidently from my words.] As how? Christ was not free from SORROVV and feare; and these were punishments of our first offence; ergo, what? Ergo, the whole Question is granted in a word.] Ergo fooles might flee, but for want of wings. The Question is, whether Christ died the death of the Soule, or suffered the paine of the damned. You heare me say Christ sorrowed and feared; as also he hungred in the desert, and thirsted on the Crosse, which likewise came into mans nature as punishments of sinne; will it hence follow, that hunger and thirst are the paines of hell? No more doe sorrow and feare inferre the whole Question, except in a mad moode you will auouch, that no man can feare, or sorrow, vnlesse he suffer the paines of the damned, and death of the Soule. [But Christ suffered these as a punishment of our sinnes, you will say.] And so did he those. For though euery thing, which he suffered, did not yeeld satisfaction for our sinnes, because death was required to make the full paiment thereof; yet euery infirmitie and miserie, that he felt consequent to our condition, were recea

               I feare you meane his holy affections, as deuotion to God, and compassion to men.] Were there any sufferings in Christ, that were vnholy? Would you haue him afraid, that he was or should be reiected and condemned of God? Or sorrow for the losse of Gods grace, and sauour in him selfe? That were vnholinesse in deede, to be in any sort so affected, and without hainous blasphemie you can not suspect that of Christ. But his paine, you thinke was infinite.] Then was his patience and obedience the more religious

and pretious in Gods sight, wheresoeuer he felt the paine, either in Soule, or in Body, or in both. And when you haue said what you can, and deuised what you will, except you will weaken Christs faith, hope and loue in God, which without sinne can not be, you must leaue feare and sorrow in him to be naturall and holy affections, and no way defiled with our sinne. The obiect or cause of Christs feare is that you would speake of, if you could tell what to make of it; but you dare not depart from your couert of Gods very wrath and proper punishment for sinne, least you should vtter as many absurditics as syllables. That feare and sorrow then were affections in Christ, I thinke no man doubteth besides you; and that they were in him most holy, you dare not deny, least to folly you should ioyne heresie; and so notwithstanding your feare what I meane; sorrow and feare in Christ were most holy affections, whatsoeuer the occasions of his feare and sorrow were. If they were affections common to Body and Soule, how then were they punishments proper to the Sonle.] I vse not PROPER, as you doe, for that which is peculiar to the Soule, and not imparted to the Body; for so no feare nor sorow is proper to the Soule in this life; and least of all Christs; whose Body no doubt was afflicted with the feare of his minde; which as you thinke astonished and ouerwhelmed all the powers of Christs Soule, and senses of his Body; but I take proper for that, which first beginneth in the Soule, though it after offend the Body. Otherwise the Body feeleth nothing, which doth not affect the Soule, neither is there any feare or sorrow in the Soule, which is not impressed on the Body. The sorrow

                  . 
               of this world worketh death, saith the Apostle, which it could not do but by changing and decaying the Body; and godly sorrow, for sinne, though it make a deepe impression in Soule and Body, yet the pardon of sinne, and comfort of grace doe more reuiue the spirits, then sorrow doth quench them; and so that hurteth not mans life, as worldly sorrow doth.
            
               But why cite I the Fathers, that Christ did not feare either death or hell?] Forsooth because you and your friends make that the cause of Christs feare and Agonie, though now you hide it vnder the name of Gods proper wrath. And if it be an absurd, impudent, and impious assertion to say that Christ trembled or doubted for feare of hell, as due to him, or determined for him, what is it then to defend, that he did and must suffer the very paines of the damned and of hell, before we could be redeemed? If he did not feare it, how could he suffer it, since he was not ignorant what should befall him? A naturall feare, you say, he had of death and hell.] A disliking and declining of hell Christ might haue as well for him selfe, as for vs, that were ioyned in one Body with him; but a doubtfull feare, what should be the end of him selfe or his sufferings, he could not haue. The weaknesse of mans nature might also iustly tremble and shake at the might and power of God prouoked with our sinnes, which were to be answered and ranfomed by his Body; but other feare Christ could haue none, and these I trust be religious submissions, and not amazed confusions, such as you put in the Soule of Christ.
            You come now to your fortifying of your speciall reasons, not speciall for any more excellencie in them, then in the rest, which you may safely sweare; but for that they more specially touched the question, as you say, though you neuer offered to come necre it. To the words of Esay the Prophet by you cited, that ChristTreat pag. 34. 
               bare our iniquities, and sustained our sorowes themselues, I answered shortly: the words made nothing to your purpose; the text did not expresse, whether Christ sustained all or some. What now replie you? Defenc. pag. 65. l. 13. 
               I meane all and euery whit, so farre as possibilitie will admit.] Keepe your meaning to make sawsigies: as I aske not after it, so I little regard it. How prooue you the Prophet meant so? Not by his words; for they are not generall: what other helpe you haue to come by his meaning, I would gladly heare. Ibid. li. 17. 
               The verie text expresseth (so much) WITH GREAT EMPHASIS: Christ bare our sorowes themselues.] You shew your skill, when you come to your proofs: for first this is no Emphasis; and were it, how prooue you, that an Emphaticall proposition is all one with a generall?

Our English tongue admitteth the same kinde of speech: as if we should say; our dayes, we waste them in vanitie; our bodies, we weaken them with intemperance; our foes, we flatter them; our friends, we neglect them; and such like: where the Pronoune following the Verbs, repeateth only the words, and directeth the cases that went before, as the Hebrue affixe doth, but addeth no force vnto them.

You exclude by your adding of ONLY, the chiefest waight and worth of our redemption, which was the dignitie and innocencie of the person that suffered. For as Gods holinesse was infinitely despighted, and displeased with our disobedience in Adam, and his Iustice thereby infinitely prouoked; so in the satisfaction for sinne his Holinesse was to receiue an infinite recompense, which was the obedience of his owne Sonne; and his Iustice to finde a sufficient barre to breake off the extremitie and perpetuitie of vengeance due to our sinnes. Both these the Scriptures expresse in mans ransome, as well as the paines. A

               What soeuer in this life might be painfull, and was due to mankinde generally for sinne, and in it owne nature was no sinne, that Christ suffered wholly and altogether for vs, euen the same which els we should.] This lacketh a faire deale of your generall and emphaticall collection, which you would force out of Esay, as if Christ had borne (all) our sorowes themselues, that is, all the same which we should haue borne. You of your owne head make here three recantations of that vniuersall proposition, which you goe about to proue. And if your authoritie stretch so farre, I hope I haue as good right to put in S. Peters limitation, that Christ 1. Pet. 2. 
               bare our sinnes himselfe in his bodie on the tree: and S. Iohns; that Christ was 
               Ioh. 1. 
               full of grace and trueth, of whose fulnesse we all haue receiued: and S. Pauls; that Christ was 
               Rom. 4. 
               deliuered for our sinnes (Mark. 14 into the hands of sinners) to do Act. 4. 
               whatsoeuer the hand and counsell of God had before determined to be done. Put these exceptions to your generall assertion, which haue as good interest as any of yours, and better than some of yours, and inferre what you can. Your emphasis will not doe you a penie woorth of good, nor me a farthing of hurt. For as the death of Christes soule doth defile him with sinne, and exclude him from God; so the true paines of hell can neither be suffered in this mortall life, nor at mens hands, nor leaue in Christ any sparke of grace or trueth, which are absurdities and impieties enough to breake the greatest beame that is in your building. But let vs see how handsomely you contriue your exceptions. Whatsoeuer in this life might be painfull, and was due to mankinde generally for sinne, all that and euen the same Christ suffered wholly for vs.] Due to mankind in this life for sinne, are all and all sorts of corporall griefs and plagues, as blindnesse, dumbnesse, sicknesse, and such like defects and distempers of bodie and minde as naturall and extreme follie, frensie, lethargie, and many moe. Did Christ suffer all and the very same in this life wholly and altogether, as you auouch he must? DVE perhaps you take for that which is appointed, and inflicted on all men generally for sinne. Is no more due to any man for sinne than he suffereth? dealeth God fully with euerie man according to his sinnes? This is doctrine false enough: but wrest wordes to your will, for that is your strength; was all that and the very same which Christ suffered determined and appointed for all men to suffer? were all men to be whipt, crowned with thornes, and hanged on a tree as he was? If you vse to flappe men in the mouthes with such manifest falsities in stead of your holy verities, they will thinke you suffer somewhat that Christ neuer suffered, though you would indanger aswell his wits as his merits for the time of his agonie.
            That which you conclude, is

               smart, paine and griefe of bodie or minde, be it neuer so great, will commend the obedience and patience of Christ, so it haue no sense of damnation, or separation from God. And in the next place, when you had obiected, the

                  ead (Christ) must suffer what the members doe; (where I hope you meane in this life, for the members of Christ suffer not the paines of hell after this life; I answered, Conclus. pa. 138. 
               The punishment of sinne which proceedeth (in this life) from the iustice of God (vpon the members of Christ) and is no sinne, that Christ might and did beare, but in no wise those terrours and feares of conscience, which proceed from sinne, and augment SINNE, and sometimes light on the members of Christ for a season to humble them. What maketh either of these places for Christes suffering the paines of hell? If you see so much in them, you see

more than I did at the first vttering of them, or yet doe vpon better reuiewing them. I did and do grant, that Christ suffered the same punishments which Gods iustice inflictea on all mankinde for sinne, during the time of this life, and haue no sinne nor sinfull adherents in them, as doubting, distrusting, and despairing haue; if you vrge no more, we shall soone agree. Where then is the death of the soule, which without sinne can not lose her life in God? and where are the true paines of the damned, which are not inflicted on all mankinde, though they were due to all; nor imposed on any during the time of this life, since this corruptible flesh and mortall condition of man is not capable of those violent and terrible iudgements which God had reserued for another world, where bodie and life shall dure for euer in eternall torments?
            
               Defenc. pag. 66. li. 3. 
               All these our due sorowes, and all this our sharpest deserued paine, euen Gods owne immediate hand smiting the soule for sinne, (which farre exceedeth and comprehendeth all other paine) Christ without any dispensation or qualification whatsoeuer endured for vs.] If Esay had sayd so much, it would make somewhat for your matter; but since it hath no better warrant than you say, you shew vs how full you are of idle and vaine conceits, and how ready rather to turne heauen, earth, and hell vpside downe, than to faile of your fansies. But to me and others that rest our faiths not on your sleights, but on the sacred Scriptures, you multiply monsters in all these your newest deuised, and sharpest supposed paines from the immediate hand of God smiting the soule of Christ. That all paines here and in hell are ordeined and strengthened by the power of Gods hand, I make no doubt; but that in all temporall or eternall paines due to the soule for sinne, God vseth his immediate hand on earth and in hell, I wholly reiect this as a fantasticall error of yours, and giue it no place neither in the soule of Christ, neither in the soules of the damned. We see how easie and vsuall it is for God, by the bodie to afflict the soule, and to make it feele the force and rage of euery griefe. He likewise maketh the soule afflict her selfe, as well with feare and sorow, as with remembrance, intelligence, and conscience of her sinnes past, and paines to come. The same God is able with the same power to make the weakest creature torment and punish both soules and diuels, since hee giueth strength to men and angels; and taketh it from them, when pleaseth him. That therefore euerlasting fire prepared for the diuell and his angels, into which all the wicked shall be cast, is nothing but a secret smiting of the soule by the immediate hand of God, I auouch is a palpable errour contrarie to the plaine words of the Scripture, and to the whole Church of Christ, as I haue formerly shewed. And that the soule of Christ was so smitten in his passion, is a bolde and bare presumption of yours, lately broched to deriue your new-found hell to the soule of Christ, without any trueth or shew of sacred Scripture. And yet all this being admitted, it will not proue the paines of hell, nor the proper wrath of God in the soule of Christ. For put the case, that Christ suffered as much paine in this life as was possible for man to suffer; so long as he fuffered it patiently, willingly, with full assistance of grace, and assurance of Gods fauour and loue toward him and his, it is euident this is not the paines of the damned, nor properly the wrath of God. So should all Martyrs and others of the godly, whose soules are wrested from their bodies with extreame and intolerable torments, be in the true paines of the damned, which is a falshood flatly repugnant to the word and promises of God. And that a finall separation from God, confusion, desperation, and eternall damnation shall torment and afflict the soules of the damned, no more than a positiue paine doth the faithfull in this life, not exceeding the strength of man, or ending this life with the sharpnesse thereof in hope and comfort of eternall bli

               le; this is such a brutish position putting no difference betwixt comfort and confusion, hope and despaire, blessednesse and cursednesse, saluation and damnation, the fauour and terrour of God, nor giuing any more ease nor ioy to the one than to the other, that I thinke few men besides you will runne on these rocks. First then, that God is not able to punish the soule seuered from the bodie by meanes, but himselfe must be the immediate and onely tormentor of soules in hell, this hath no trueth in it. Next, that Christes soule was thus tormented and

pressed with the immediate hand of God, hath no ground besides the giddinesse of your head. Lastly, if both those were receiued, yet was there great distance betweene the feare and sorow of Christ suffering in perfect affiance, and expectance of eternall ioy and honour from God; and the terrors, griefs and torments of the damned, reiected and condemned of God to perpetuall and vnsufferable paines; so that your conceits in this place are weake, false and wicked.
            
               The smiting of the Soule by Gods immediat hand, farre exceedeth and comprehendeth, as it were, all other paine; and that Christ suffered without any dispensation or qualification whatsoeuer.] You need no Qualification to holde as many absurdities, as your pen can heape together; you dispense with your selfe. That your new hell, which of your owne head you make to be the smiting of the Soule with Gods immediate hand, farre exceedeth all other paines; you speake the words, but where are the proofes and deeds? The true paines of hell, which God hath ordained and denounced in his word, farre exceede the power and patience of men and Angels; neither can they be suffered in this mortall flesh, and feeble life of ours; which fainteth vnder extreme anguish, and parteth the Soule from the body by farre lesser paines, then hell hath any. Chrysostome saith of them truely, Homil. 49. a

               Name fire, sword, deuouring beasts, and if any paine bee more grieuous (in this life) attamen ne vmbra quidem sunt haec ad illa tormenta, And yet these are not a shadow to those torments. Now your new made hell, that so farre exceedeth and comprehendeth all other paine (as you pretend,) not onely Christ did suffer with quietnesse and patience, but the members of Christ, that are no more then men, and the wicked, that are the worst and the weakest of all men, in respect of inward strength, endure the same, as you affirme in this life. Yea, so terrible are your late deuised paines and sufferings of Gods wrath, which as you say Treatis. pag. 77. 
               alwayes accompanie them that are separated from the grace and loue of God, that they neither end the liues, nor waste the flesh, nor breake the sleepe of the wicked. This exceedeth, you say, and comprehendeth all other paine.] But the pains of hell indeed haue an other maner of torment and terrour in them, then to suffer men to eate and sleepe. These be your mockeries of Gods wrath, and not the hell which he threatneth. If it comprehend all other paines, that are mediate, and those as well priuatiue, as positiue; how is it then immediate? Can it both comprehend all paines that haue meanes, and yet bee without all meanes? But what may not you say, that without any dispensation take vpon you to found a new hell, and subiect the Soule of Christ vnto it as a principall part of our Redemption?

               Thus Ierom also expoundeth this very Text, against whom you may turne your vaine and friuolous insultation for his indefinite speech, to whom it pertaineth in this case, as well as to me.] If you could prooue, that Ierom intended a generall conclusion, as you doe, then were Ieroms indefinite proposition somewhat too short to declare his meaning; but who saith that Ierom meant so, besides your selfe? Ieroms proposition therefore to his purpose is sober, and sound; and yours ouer-reaching the trueth of Ieroms Assertion, hath neither veritie, nor sobrietie in it. Ibid. li. 18. 
               In learning and reason an indefinite proposition, is to be taken as vniuersall in a necessarie matter.] But if the matter be not plainely necessarie, that the Assertion may be fully generall; to conclude a generall vpon an indefinite, is inexcusable ignorance, and oftentimes intollerable madnesse. If it bee simply necessarie, then is it as true in all, as in one. But how commeth this to bee a matter wholly necessarie, that whosoeuer will redeeme or deliuer a prisoner, must suffer all things without exception, which the prisoner should? I troe, if that were true, few prisoners would bee ransomed amongst men; and in Christ it is not only most vntrue, but furious and heynous blasphemie, to say hee must, or did suffer all the same, which was due to vs. For so Christ must bee excluded from all grace and glorie, and subiected to euerlasting confusion and damnation, as wee should haue beene. And if you make this a matter simply necessarie in Christ, before we could bee redeemed, I know not what you may adde to augment this franticke impietie. Ibid. li. 21. 
               It is a necessarie matter, you say, yet but 
               Ibid. li. 21. 
               so farre as knowen possibilitie admitteth, and indeede no farder.]

Well fare your learning, that in one and the same sentence auouch this to be necessarie, and not necessarie; and so generall, and not generall. These bee the flowers of your best digested doctrine. But Sir, if the generall Assertion be blasphemous, then is it no way necessarie, except you haue a qualification to make blaspemie a necessarie matter. If the Assertion may not be generall, least it be hereticall and worse, why labour you so earnestly against the words of the Text, to fasten the generall not on Ierom onely, but on Esay also? Will you needes make the Prophet a blasphemer for companie? But you will delay the blasphemie with a knowen possibilitie.] If there be knowen impossibilities to hinder this generall Assertion, as indeede there be many, how commeth it to be a matter so necessarie, as you make it? Be impossibilities generall, and necessarie with you? This is the first rule of reason and Art, that I heard come from you, since you entred this question; but if your iudgement serue you no better to discerne betweene matters necessarie and vnnecessarie, I would wish you to keepe the rest of your Logicke for Loyterers hall. Did you thinke Sir Discourser, with a vaine bragge of a necessarie matter to outface the Reader, where if you could prooue it to be necessarie, you need not flie for helpe to any rules of reason? Your Rule therefore is sensibly false in earthly Ransomming of prisoners; and much more false and impious in the Sonne of God, who would and might tast by his man-hoode the miseries of this life, but in no wise be partaker of our inward, or euerlasting pollution, or confusion.

The words cited by Ierom immediatly before, are these, the chasticement of our peace is vpon him; and not as you vntruely auouch, (the Apostles words) He was made a curse for vs. That indeede goeth before, but before also goe the misiudging, wounding, and hanging of Christ on the Crosse. Now the relatiue following, (QVOD enim) must either be referred to all that went before, and so not to malediction apart from the rest, or to that which went next before, which is the chasticement of our peace. And so either way you were ouer bold with your Author, to referre his words whether pleased you. And farder answere to Ierom there needed none. For to no proofe needed no answere.

So doth he of digging Christs hands and feete out of the Psalme, and of the rest of Christs wounds and stripes, by which we were healed, out of the Prophet, whom hee expoundeth; All which Christ suffered for vs, being in deed due to vs for our sinnes.

grounded on the plaine euidence of the Sacred Scriptures; and so receaued in the Church of Christ before our Age. I list not to deuise or approue a new Saluation vnknowen till our time, and if any man be otherwise minded, he shall goe alone for me. God grant me to be a member of that Church, which hath reuerently receaued and faithfully beleeued the simplicitie of the Scriptures touching our Redemption by the death and bloud of Christ Iesus. Howbeit I see many men speake diuersly, that meane nothing lesse then your late found hell, inflicted by the immediat hand of God on the Soule of Christ. Where then you dreampt in your Treatise, (as you still doe in your Defence,) that whosoeuer named the wrath of God in Christs sufferings, or called his Crosse a cursed kinde of death, was wholy of your side; I did in few lines reprooue that folly of yours, and since you quoted no speciall words neither out of Master Nowels Catechisme, nor out of the Bible appointed publikely to be read in the Churches of this Realme, nor out of the Booke of Homilies, that were worth the standing on; there was no cause why I should wast time to hunt after your meaning. If you would haue an answere, it was meete you made your Arguments, and pressed your Authorities, as well as you could; and then you should soone see what I said vnto them. But as I then foretold, so you now performe; Your buzzing head no where findeth the wrath of God, or horror of Iudgement against our sinne to be apprehended by Christ, but you straightway conclude all your conceits from the first to the last. These words when I reade them in any man, offend not me, as they helpe not you, except you wrest them after your manner to hide vnder them your new found hell, and the rest of your presumptuous and irreligious humours. Begin with the Catechisme, and see what choise you haue made thence.

               There it is thus taught. He payd and suffered the paine due to vs, and by this meanes deliuerd vs from the same. With Christ as our suretie God dealt as it were with extremitie of law. Christ therefore suffered, and in suffering ouercame death, the paine appointed by the euerliuing God for mans offence.] What of all this? What one worde is here sounding towards the death of the soule, or the death of the damned after this life? The Catechisme in the very same sentence expressely speaketh of the painefull and reprochfull death which the Iewes inflicted on Christ, the manner whereof is orderly described in the next answere before. These things (sayth the Catechisme) the Iewes did vnto him cruelly, maliciously, and wickedly; but Christ willingly of his owne accord suffered ALL THOSE THINGS (from the Iewes) to appease with this most sweete sacrifice his father offended with mankinde, vtque paenas nobis debitas dependeret & persolueret, atque nos ex illis hoc modo eximeret: and to pay and satisfie the punishments due to vs, thereby to exempt vs from them. Cum Christo quasi sponsore, pro nobis sic passo, Deus summo quasiiure egit. God dealt after a sort seuerely with Christ as with a surety, suffering thus for vs; but to vs, whose sinnes, deserued punishments, and due paines (transtulit in Christum) hee transferred on Christ, God shewed singular mercie and clemencie. All this is plainely referred to the punishments and paines, which Christ suffered at the hands of the Iewes by the secret counsell and appointment of God, that thereby he might pacifie the wrath of his Father, and deliuer vs from the shame, paine, and death due to our sinnes, which God transferred and remoued from vs to Christ, that he might suffer them, and we be freed both here, and hereafter for them. Wherein great fauour and mercie were shewed to vs; and Christ as it were a Suretie subiected for vs after a sort to the rigour of the Lawe. What hurt is there in these wordes, if you leaue haling and pulling them from their right sense? The Authour of the Catechisme warily forbeareth the generall, which you seeke after so greedily, and when hee commeth to the places that might seeme harsh, he qualifieth them with quasi, as it were, not meaning to presse those phrases, as you doe, to the vttermost. Wherefore he saith that Christ was, quasi sponsor, a kinde of suretie suffering for vs, and that God dealt with him, Quasi summo iure, as it were with riger, in respect of the lenitie shewed to vs. Which speeches if you poyson them not with your bitter conceits, I mislike not, so long as they be stretched no further, then to, SIC passo pro nobis, Christ THVS suffering for vs at the hands of the Iewes;

to which the writer of the Catechisme wisely restraineth his wordes of Christs sufferings in that whole Section. The death therefore, which hee saith Christ suffered as the punishment appointed by God for haynous offences, or for mans wickednesse, and thereby conquered the deuill, who had the rule of death; was the cruell and shamefull death, which the Iewes put Christ to on the Crosse, which was the death that God either allotted to all men for sinne; or prescribed specially for grieuous offences, as an accursed kind of death, euen in this life, where Christ suffered, though euerlasting death did ensue the wicked in the next world, from which Christ was free. Neither can the deuill be said to be the ruler of the second death, if it be inflicted as you would haue it, by the immediat hand of God, except you make the deuill ruler and gouernour of Gods immediate hand, which is notorious blasphemie.
            It is there also written, that Christs 
               Defenc. pa. 67. li. 7. 
               will was to suffer all extreamitie for vs, who had deserued all extreamitie, and all these things being taken vpon him, hee destroyed them all.] You sliely slippe your Authors words in the question prefixed, which is the cause of this answere, and lighting on a Latine phrase, which you scant vnderstand, you pursue that to the pit of hell. The question proposed in the Catechisme is this. Since Christ had power in himselfe to choose what kind of death he would, why would he rather be fastned to the Crosse, then suffer any other kind of punishment? The answere is. Vltima omnia pati voluit pronobis, quia vltima omnia eramus commeriti. Christ would endure for vs in all things the vttermost (which the Iewes could doe vnto him) because in all things we had deserued the vttermost. And that the phrase, vltima omnia, the vttermost in all things, is referred to the Iewes, to note the worst they could doe vnto Christ, appeareth by that which is added as a reason of those words. For the Crosse (saith he) was of all others a detested and abhorred kind of death, which yet Christ would chiefly sustaine (at the Iewes hands) for vs, that he might receiue on him the grieuous curse, which our sinnes had fastned to vs, and by this meanes deliuer vs from it. All despightes, all reproches, and punishments (offered him by the Iewes) Christ counted light for our saluation, and endured to be contemned, and abiected (by them) as the basest (or vilest) of all men. So that the Catechisme had no intent to say, that Christ willingly would suffer the worst that God could doe vnto him; that were defiance to Gods power and iustice, which was fardest from Christs thought, and must be from the Catechizers words, except you will haue him blaspheme: but in deede our Sauiour did submit himselfe to the worst and vttermost, that men could doe vnto him, which was the determinate counsell of God for the satisfaction of his iustice, and redemption of our sinnes; and therefore Christ made choise of the Crosse to yeeld vp his life, that the Iewes might to the last breath loade him with all maner of despightes, reproches, and tortures, which they by Satans instigation failed not to performe. Leaue then your peruerting of other mens words, and subuerting of their meanings, and I see no one syllable yet cited by you out of the Catechisme, that tendeth towards your new found hell, or the death of the damned to be suffered in Christs soule.
            
               But Christ (you thinke) could deliuer vs from no more then he suffered for vs.] You might haue learned the contrarie to that out of the Catechisme; where you are plainly taught, that Christs corporall and temporall wrongs, reproches, and paines inflicted on him by the Iewes, did quit vs from all spirituall & euerlasting debts, deaths, feares and paines.

               Christ in our name and place vndertooke to his Father to satisfie him for our sinnes, and with the most sweete sacrifice of his obedience, to appease his Fathers wrath conceaued against vs for our obstinacie, and so to restore vs to fauour with God. And therefore Christ the most innocent Lambe of God was bound with cordes to free vs, who for our deserts were deliuered captiues to Satan, sinne, and damnation: Christ, who was vtterly without all fault, was accused, and condemned by the sentence of an earthly Iudge, that he might absolue vs before the heauenly Tribunall, who were euery way guiltie and most worthy of damnation: Christ with his precious bloud shed for vs, did wash and clense the spots and filthinesse of our sinnes: Lastly Christ with the reproches, which he sustained most vndeseruedly, and with the most shamefull, and most sharpe death, which was inflicted on him, deliuered vs from

the punishment, ignominie, and death euerlasting, which we had most iustly merited with our wicked offences: and so all our sinnes were buried in obliuion, and remooued farre from the sight of God by Christ. This doctrine if you could brooke, you would not so much disable the sufferings of Christ at the hands of his persecutours, as you doe; not so hastily commit the soule of Christ to the paines of the damned from the immediate hand of God, before you wil acknowledge our redemption to be perfect by the crosse and death of Christ: but as your manner is, you steppe by whole leaues that are against you, and stumble at a word, that happily may be wrested from his right sense; and that you thinke is strong enough to beare the waight of all those absurdities, if not impieties, which you would reare. Defenc. pa. 67. li. 9. 
               Marke also what doctrine the Law of this Realme consonantly publisheth and commandeth in the homilies of Christs passion. The first homily maketh Christes putting himselfe betweene Gods deserued wrath and our sinne, the extreamest part of his passion.] You alleaged the Catechisme rather for your pleasure, then any profit to your cause; you do the like now with the booke of Homilies. You cite but little thence, and that to litle purpose. That Christ put himselfe betweene Gods deserued wrath, and our sinne, to appeare the iust displeasure of God kindled against vs and to auert it from vs, I knowe no man that maketh any doubt thereof; and I maruaile to what ende you alleage it. For what needed a Redeemer, but to saue vs from the wrath of God prouoked by our wickednesse, and armed with infinite power to take vengeance of mans vnrighteousnesse? Or how could Christ be a Mediatour, if he did not stand betweene vs and the dreadfull anger of God irritated by our iniquities, to quench the same, and to keepe vs from euerlasting destruction? But the Homily, you say, maketh that the extreamest part of Christs passion, which was a further feeling then the sense of bodily paine onely. And therefore by the Homilie he felt Gods proper wrath spiritually which our sinne deserued.] You no sooner heare the name of Gods wrath, but you run to your old bias, and straightway pitch on your hell paines. There are no such words in all that Homilie, as that Christs putting him selfe betweene Gods wrath and our sinne, was the extreamest part of his passion. Gods wrath against mans sinne, was indeede the cause of all that Christ suffered, and not the extreamest part onely of his sufferings, by which you would extenuate the rest, as not extreame enough, till that were added. But the Booke of Homilies teacheth you no such Doctrine; that proposeth the death of Christ suffered in his Body on the Crosse for the FVLL and ONLY (satisfaction or) amends of all our sinnes. Heare the words, that the Reader may see what a counterfeite pretence you make of publike Authoritie, as if it were consonant to your new conceited errours, when it plainly impugneth them. The first Sermon of the Passion. pag. 5.

               Ibidem. 
               there is none other thing that can be named vnder heauen to saue our Soules, but THIS ONLY VVORKE of Christs pretious offering of his Body vpon the Altar of the Crosse. The death of Christs Body you thinke did not manifest the wrath of God against our sinnes; the death of the Soule and paines of hell must be added before the wrath of God will appeare in Christs Crosse.] So teach you; but the Booke of Homilies teacheth the cleane contrarie. The second Sermon of the Passion. pag. 9. 
               Christ being the Sonne of God, and perfect God himselfe, who neuer committed sinne, was compelled to come downe from heauen, and to giue his Body to be brused and broken on the Crosse for our sinnes. Was not this a manifest token of Gods great wrath and displeasure towards sinne, that he could be pacified by NO OTHER MEANES, but ONLY by the sweete and pretious bloud of his deare Sonne? Therefore in the Booke of Homilies, as there is no mention, so is their no intention, that Christ suffered spiritually the proper wrath of God, which our sinnes deserued. These are your phrases and fansies added to the booke of Homilies, which neither speaketh nor meaneth any such thing, as you idlely inferre.
            
               Defenc. pag. 67. li. 20. 
               Againe, Christ bare all our sinnes, sores and infirmities vpon his owne backe; no paine

did he refuse to suffer in his owne bodie. But as he felt all this in his bodie, so he must feele the greatest part primarily and much more deeply in his soule: ergo he refused not to suffer all the paines of the wrath of God both in bodie and soule.] This kinde of ergoing passeth mine vnderstanding. To the first proposition taken out of the booke of Homilies, that Christ bare all our sores and infirmities vpon his owne backe, refusing no paine in his owne bodie, to deliver vs from euerlasting paine, you put what pleaseth you, without any proofe; and then you inferre what you list, without any sequele of reason or trueth. For how hangeth this geere together? Christ bare all our sores and infirmities in his owne bodie, ergo he suffered all the paines of Gods wrath both in bodie and soule. Are there none other paines of Gods wrath, but the sores and infirmities of our bodies? And if Christ did suffer all bodily paine incident to men heere on earth, doth it therefore follow, that he suffered all the paines both of bodie and soule, that Gods wrath here and els where hath prouided for sinners? If a man would set himselfe purposely to crosse the booke of homilies, I know not how he might do it more directly then you do, to conclude expresly the contrary to that which is there deliuered. It is no maruell, that so manie writers are of your side, as you say, when you can enlarge them and interlace them after this sort; but you shall doe well to thinke, that your Reader now hearkeneth after the publike doctrine of this Realme authorized by the lawes thereof in the booke of homilies, as you professed; and not after your secret conceits intercepting and peruerting the trueth there taught, by your pernicious and erroneous glozes.
            
               Christ, you say, Defenc. pag. 67. li. 20. 
               must feele the greatest part of his bodily paines primarily in his soule.] Haue you not brought vs monsters enough in matters of faith, but you must hatch vs more? Must bodily paines (for of those speaketh the booke of homilies, as appeareth by the next words; Christ refused no paine in his owne bodie; and the first wordes are; he bare all our sores and infirmities on his owne backe) must I say bodily paines be felt primarily in the soule? If you shift all sense to the soule, then the bodie beareth, that is, feeleth nothing; and so you refute the booke of homilies, you follow it not. If you allow sense to the bodie, tell vs I pray you how violence first offered to the bodie is primarily felt in the soule. It may be betwixt first in English, and primus in Latine, you haue found some deepe difference. The soule, you thinke, doth primarily consider of the paines of her bodie, that you meane by feeling.] Then leaue you to the bodie a second consideration of his owne paines; and so you giue reason and memorie to the bodie distinct from the soule, which well becommeth a man of your wisdome. That Christ duely considered of the cause for which he suffered, and of the Iudge by whose appointment he suffered these things in his bodie from the Iewes, I haue often sayd it, and you haue often reiected it as not sufficient to satisfie the wrath of God against our sinnes; and therefore you euery where vrge the proper punishment, and iust reward of sinne due to vs on the soule of Christ; and when you come to proue it, you rest on the religious consideration that Christ had of his sufferings, and call that the wrath of God; as if you might choppe and change the wrath of God to your best liking, and neuer be constant in any thing. Howbeit, the question now is, what the publike homilies teach the people to beleeue of the worke of their saluation; and not how you can shift and sheere wordes, to make them sort with your errours. Shew therefore somewhat out of the booke of Homilies established by the lawes of this realme, that may cleerely confirme, or concurre with your doctrine, and sell vs not the verdiuyce of your owne deuices in stead of good wine allowed by publike authoritie.

               tooke vpon him the reward of our sinnes, the iust reward of sinne. But the same homilie sayth, the reward of our sinne was the iust wrath and indignation of God, the death both of bodie and soule. Therefore by the homilie Christ tooke on him for vs the iust wrath and indignation of God, the death of the bodie and soule.] Your trade of iugling will but shame you, if you can shift hands no cleanlier, then here you doe. Your first and second propositions here cited out of the Booke of Homilies are so curtayled by you, that they seeme nothing lesse then that they are in their right places. The writer of the

Homilies hauing taught the people, that Christ

               hatred of sinne, that was so grieuous in the sight of God, that he would not be pacified, but onely with the bloud of his owne Sonne. And though there were a thousand The second Sermon of the Passion. 
               examples in the Scripture shewing how greatly God abhorred sinne, yet this one is of more force then all the rest, that the Sonne of God was 
               The second Sermon of the Passion. 
               compelled to giue his body to bee bruised and broken on the Crosse for our sinnes. After these premonitions follow your words, The second Sermon of the Passion. 
               Christ hath taken vpon him the iust reward of sinne, which was death, not the whole reward of sinne, which is an vtter exclusion from all grace and glorie, and the eternall damnation of body and Soule in hell fire, but the death of his body bruised and broken on the Crosse, by the cruell rage of the Iewes, which is particularly and plainely before described. Now the death of the body inflicted on all mankind for sinne is the iust, though not the full reward of sinne; and by suffering that, Christ freed vs from all condemnation of sinne, which otherwise in vs would haue beene euerlasting. And this explication the same Homily addeth to the former words, which you cite, though you purposely suppresse it. The second Sermon of the Passion. pag. 5. 
               When all hope of righteousnesse was past on our part, and wee had nothing whereby wee might quench Gods burning wrath, and worke the saluation of our Soules; Then, euen then did the Sonne of God come downe from heauen to be wounded for our sakes, to be reputed with the wicked, to be condemned vnto death, to take vpon him the reward of our sinnes, and to giue his body to be broken on the Crosse for our offences. Here are both the places, which you patch together; the one noting Death to be the iust reward of sinne, the other expressing what kind of death Christ suffered for vs as the reward of our sinne, euen the breaking of his body on the Crosse for our offences.
            In the second proposition you shew more deprauing of the publike doctrine of this Realme. For where the second Homily saith in expresse words, that our The second Sermon of the Passion. pag.

               Grandfather Adam, by breaking Gods commaundement in eating the Apple forbidden him in Paradise, purchased not onely to himselfe, but also to his posteritie for euer, the iust wrath and indignation of God, who condemned both him and his to euerlasting death both of body and Soule; you transferre this iudgement from Adam to Christ, which the Homily doeth not; and least you should bee taken tardie with open blasphemie, you leaue out the word EVERLASTING, which is euident in the Homily, and vpon those maimed and forged collections you inferre, that by the Homily Christ tooke on him for vs the death both of body and Soule.] Why say you not, Christ tooke vpon him EVERLASTING death both of body and Soule, which was the iust and due purchase (or wages) of our sinne by the plaine words of that Homilie? You feared blasphemie, and therefore you chose rather to falsifie the place, then to want some defence for your Doctrine. Christ you will say, died that death, which was the reward of our sinne, by the Booke of Homilies.] To belie publike Authoritie, so grossely, in so great causes, is a quadruple iniquitie. What death Christ died for our sinnes, is openly professed and euen pictured before our eyes in this very Homilie; the words I repeated in the Section before. What death was the wages of our sinne, if the word euerlasting did not fully declare, the same Homilie in the same Section, whence your words are taken, doth twice most abundantly teach. The second Homilie of the Passion. li. 24. 
               Adam tooke vpon him to eate, (of the tree forbidden) and in so doing he died the death, that is to say, he became mortall, he lost the fauour of God, he was cast out of Paradise, he was no longer a Citizen of heauen, but a fire brand of hell, and a bond-slaue to the Diuell. And sixe lines after. Ibidem. 
               So that now neither Adam, nor any of his had any right, or interest at all in the kingdome of heauen: but were become plaine Reprobates and cast-awaies, being perpetually damned to the euerlasting paines of hell fire. It

would fairely fit your new Doctrine to defend that Christ was a Reprobate and a Castaway, yea a fire-brand of hell, and a bond-slaue to the Diuell, perpetually damned to the euerlasting paines of hell fire. And though I be perswaded you detest these diuelish impieties, and hellish blasphemies; yet you regard little your cause, or your conscience, which vouch in Print, that Christ suffered that reward of sinne, which by the Booke of Homilies was due to vs; all those things by the same Booke in the same place being due to vs. You will shift of this matter, as if these things might be granted in substance, not in circumstance, and in our countenance, not in his. But such shifts are so shamefull and sinfull in this case, that I thinke your owne friends wil altogether mislike your flying to the Booke of Homilies for the death of the Soule, or the iust reward of sinne in all mankind there mentioned, to be suffered in the Soule of Christ.
            
               Treat. pa. 80. li. 33. 
               Also our great Bible appointed by Authoritie to be read in publike Churches expresly saith as much] It is a poore pittance, when you finde no helpe for your new made hell in the whole Text of the Bible, to run to the Printers additions set by the sides of the Booke, who often annexe things in the Margine for direction or explication, as they thinke good, which declare the Printers or Correctors, but not the Authors nor Translators mind. Your wits I trust be not so weake, but you can discerne between the English translation of the Text commaunded to be publikely read in the Church, and the Marginall notes added by others without any warrant of publike Authority, for ought that I see. And therefore I take not my selfe, nor any man else, to be bound to those notes, farder then they euidently concurre with the truth of the Text; though they may be sometimes profitable for the opening of hard places. That Christ 
               Luke. 22. vers. 24. 
               was in an Agonie, the Euangelist affirmeth, and the English Translator hath done his duetie in expressing so much; but what the cause was of that Agonie, is beyond the Commission of a Translator to specifie, since the Scripture concealeth it; and so publike Authoritie, which appointed the English Translation to be openly reade in the Church confirmeth not the Marginall appositions, which may not be read in the Church, though they may be receiued so farre as they haue manifest coherence with the Text, or consequence from the Text, in respect rather of their veritie then Authoritie. For these notes at first were not affixed, and in sundry editions they haue been altered, & increased as the Corrector liked, & euen this note which you alleage, somewhat differeth from the Geneuian notes, whence this and the most of the rest were taken. The words of the Geneuian edition vpon this place are these: Annotat. in cap. 22. Luc. vers. 44. 
               The word (Agonie) signifieth that horror that Christ had conceaued not onely for feare of death, but of his Fathers Iudgement and wrath against sinne. The Printer of the great English Bible, or his Corrector, ouer against those words of the Text, he was in an Agonie, setteth this obseruation in the Margine; In Lu
                     •…
                  . cap. 22. vers. 44. 
               He felt the horror of Gods wrath and iudgement against sinne. I refuse not those words as if they gainsaid the Doctrine, which I defend; but I see no farder ground in them then ghesse, when they ayme at the cause of Christs Agonie, which the Scripture suppresseth.
            Howbeit let the words stand in their full strength; though by no meanes I acknowledge either Authentike or publike Authoritie in them; they rather euert, then support your opinion. The vttermost here ascribed to Christ is HORROR, that is, a shaking or trembling feare of Gods Iudgement and wrath against sinne, which all the godly finde in them selues, when they enter into the serious cogitation of Gods holinesse displeased, and his Iustice prouoked with their sinnes; but this is farre from the death or paines of the damned, except you make the vengeance of the Reprobate all one with the repentance of the faithfull. This therefore is like the rest of your proofes, no way tending to your purpose. The feare of Gods wrath against sinne, which is common to all the godly in this life, though not at all times, hath no fellowship with the feare of the Reprobate, much lesse with the torments of the damned. The one is a religious and godly sorrow for sinne, which worketh saluation, and yet agniseth with feare and trembling the iustnesse and greatnesse of Gods wrath against sinne: the other is the beholding of the terrible and eternall destruction of Body and

Soule prepared for them without all hope of ease or end. In Christ there might be a double cause of this horror conceaued or felt by him, as affections are felt in the Nature of Man; the one touching vs, the other touching himselfe. Christ might tremble and shake at the terror of Gods Iudgement prouided for vs, which was euerlasting damnation of Body and Soule in hell fire; and the more tenderly he loued vs, the greater was his horror to see this hang ouer our heads; euen as we naturally tremble to see the desperate daungers of our dearest friends present before our eyes. And if Paul said truely of him selfe, 2. Cor. 5. 
               we knowing the terror of the Lord, meaning the terror of the Lords Iudgement against sinne; how much more then did the Sauiour of the world know the same? the cleare beholding of which might iustly worke in him a manifest horror, to teach vs to take heede of that terrible Iudgement, at the sight whereof for our sakes he did tremble in the daies of his flesh. An other cause of that horror might concerne himselfe. For since the wrath and Iudgement of God against our sinne was so terrible to behold, that Christ in his humane nature trembled at it; how could it but raise an horror in him to know, that he must presently receiue in his owne Body the burthen thereof, and make satisfaction therefore with his owne smart? which how farre it would pearce his patience, the weakenes of our flesh in him might well feare and tremble, though his spirit were neuer so resolute and ready to endure the most, that mans nature in this life could sustaine with obedience and confidence. So that either the sight of Gods wrath against sinne due to vs, or the satisfaction of the same which Christ was to make, might vrge his humane nature to that feare and trembling for the time, which these notes obserue; and yet neither of these come neere the feare of the wicked, or paines of the damned. Besides that religious horror and feare is nothing lesse then the paines of hell inflicted on the Soule by the immediate hand of God, which is the deuice, that you seeke to establish.

               Thus my Text of Scripture is also iustified, that Christ gaue himselfe the price of Redemption for vs, WHICH ELS VVE SHOVLD HAVE PAYD.] If wresting, adding, and altering may be called iustifying, then is your sense of that text iustified indeed; otherwise there is nothing yet alleadged, that any way approueth that meaning of the text which you would inforce. The price of our redemption Christ payd; not the
               Christ payed a price for vs which we could not pay. 
               same, which els we should haue payd, had we not beene redeemed; (for so Christ must haue suffered euerlasting damnation of bodie and soule, which was the payment exacted of vs) but he payd a PRICE for vs, that more contented his displeased Father, than our euerlasting destruction could haue done. You dallie therefore with the doubtfulnesse of the word PAYD, which sometimes signifieth the enduring of punishment, sometimes the yeelding of recompence. The Price of our sinnes which we should haue payd, that is, the punishment of our sinnes, which we should haue susteined, was eternall destruction of bodie and soule in hell fire; and other payment we could make none. This payment due to vs, or punishment which we should haue payd, the person of Christ could not suffer; it is most horrible blasphemy so to speake or thinke; but he payd a price for vs, that is, a SATISFACTION and AMENDS for our sinnes, which by no meanes we were able to pay. And so much the word ANTILYTRON noteth, euen a Price, Recompence, or Ransome in exchange of the punishment or imprisonment which the captiue should suffer. This Price, you will say, was himselfe. I make no doubt, that Christ gaue himselfe to die, but NOT TO BE DAMNED for our sinnes, as we should haue beene. Neither can the common custome of redeeming captiues inferre any more than the giuing of a price for the Prisoner. And therefore I did iustly aske, Who told you that the Scripture here speaketh after the common vse of redeeming Captiues taken in warre.
            And where you answere, the 
               Defenc. pag. 67. l. 35. 
               nature of the word ANTILYTRON importeth so much, which is properly vsed in such cases; you vndestand neither the nature of the word, neither the maner of our redemption rightly. For first the word 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , whence Antilytron commeth, properly signifieth a mutuall redemption of ech other, as Aristotle Arist. Eth. li. 9. ca. 2. obserueth; and so we should redeeme Christ, as he redeemed vs. Wherefore

the word is heere improperly taken, and signifieth no more than LYTRON without composition. Againe, the common vse of redeeming Captiues, is either to free Prisoner for Prisoner, or to take money for the ransome of libertie; neither of which tooke place in our redemption: and therefore the common custome of redeeming of men taken in warre hath no likenesse with the redeeming of the world, since God tooke no money for our ransome as men vse to do for their Prisoners; but the life of his only Sonne for the libertie of his rebellious seruants, which men vse not to doe. Neither did Christ offer a price proportioned to our value or abilitie, but farre excelling our persons, and exceeding our power. It was therefore a very colde comparison to resemble the freeing of mens bodies for golde and siluer (which Captaines esteeme more than they doe Prisoners) to the redeeming of their soules by the precious bloud of Christ; and such as S. Peter reiected before me in euident words: 1. Pet. 1. 
               Yee were not redeemed with corruptible things, as siluer and golde, but with the precious bloud of Christ, as of a lambe vndefiled and vnspotted. And for you or any man els to say, that Christ suffered no lesse, nor none other, than we should haue suffered, or payed no more than we should haue payd; is to subiect the soule of Christ to our deserued confusion and condemnation, and to euen our persons, who are wretched and sinfull men, with his, who is the true and eternall sonne of God; either of which is a sensible defacing of his dignitie, innocencie, and obedience, wholly requisit to our redemption, and vtterly impossible to our condition.

               You seeme to inferre, that I forsooth doe holde with your opinion, that Christ payed the price of our redemption (properly) to the diuell, and not to God.] If you should leaue belying and falsifying of other mens speeches, you should leaue one of your chiefest defences. For when you can take no aduantage of my words, you sticke not to straine them to your b

               nt; and as though mistaking and wresting were not wrongs enough, you inlarge them and interlace them not only with things neuer intended by me, but with plaine contrarieties to that which is conteined in my words. To shew how full and perfect our redemption is by the bloud of Christ, in my sermons I say; Serm pa. 60. & 61. 
               The bloud of Christ doth redeeme, cleanse, wash, iustifie and sanctifie the elect; it doth pacifie and propitiate the Iudge; it doth seale the couenant of mercie, grace, and glorie, betwixt God and man; it doth conclude and binde the diuell. And lest any man should mistake that I sayd, The price was so sufficient, that it did not onely pacifie and propitiate the Iudge, but conclude and binde the diuell, that otherwise had a challenge to vs as to the seruants of sinne and corruption; I added: Serm. pa. 64. li. 30. 
               It was an iniurie to Christ for vs to thinke his bloud was shed to satisfie the diuell, but Christ offered his bloud as a sacrifice to God his Father, to satisfie the iustice of God prouoked with our sinnes; and yet Satans extreme rage against the person of Christ (in conspiring and compassing his death with all contumelie and crueltie) turned to his vtter ruine: God raising againe the Lord Iesus from death, and giuing him power to spoile the kingdome of the diuell, in recompence of the wrong which he receiued at Satans hand. Thus was the bloud of Christ a price most sufficient for all the world; the voluntarie offering whereof by Christ himselfe, was the sacrifice that appeased the wrath, satisfied the iustice, and purchased the fauour of God towards vs; and the wrongfull spilling whereof, which Christ with patience endured, did exclude the diuell euen by Gods iustice, from all the challenge, that otherwise he had vnto vs. Doth this make the p
                     •…
                  ce of our redemption, which was the bloud of Christ, to be payed properly to the diuell, and not to God? or rather cleane contrarie, that this price was willingly offered, and so properly payed to God for the satisfaction of his iustice, and by no meanes yeelded or payed to satisfie the diuell; but the iniurious shedding thereof by the procurement of Satan, did iustly discharge all the members of Christ from the power and challenge of the diuell, who afore possessed them by the rule of Gods iustice? And to this sense I did restraine the words of Ambrose, to make him accord with the rest of the Fathers; who with one voice confesse, that God would not vse power alone, but euen iustice to the diuell, in taking man out of his hand; and therefore ordered the price of our redemption in such sort, that it should not only fully satisfie and pacifie his owne wrath

by a willing and precious oblation, but iustly exclude all the power and possession of darknesse from the elect, by Satans malitious and contumelious attempt against the person of the Sonne of God.
            Neither is this doctrine so strange as you would make it, but only to those that neuer waded farther then the mire of their owne inuentions. Irenaeus that ancient Father vrgeth this as a r

This excludeth not the voluntarie seruice and sacrifice of Christs obedience vnto death, wherewith the Iustice of God was satisfied and appeased; but this sheweth, that as God had chiefe regard of his owne Iustice and mercie towards man in giuing his owne Sonne to be the pacification of his wrath, and propitiation of our sinnes, so he dealt iustly with the diuell in causing the spoyler to be spoyled, and for the wrongfull and spitefull inuasion, that Satan made

against his Lord and Master, to loose all the Dominion and power, that otherwise he claymed ouer Christs elect. And so the Price of our Redemption whatsoeuer you trifle to the contrarie, did not onely discharge the guilt of our sinnes, and our debt to Gods iustice by Christs willing obedience to God euen vnto death, but the furious and iniurious intermedling of Satan therewith, so closeth his mouth, that he seeth and knoweth our deliuerance and his destruction to be iust.

August. de Trinitate. li. 13. cap. 13. 
               Because the Diuell by his peruersenesse was a desirer of power, and a forsaker and impugner of Iustice; and men did so much the more imitate him, how much the more neglecting or hating Iustice, they did studie to be mightie; and were either inflamed with the getting, or delighted with the hauing thereof: It pleased God, that for the taking of Man out of the diuels power, the diuell should not be conquered by power, but by Iustice; and so men imitating Christ should seeke to ouercome the diuell by Iustice, and not with power. 
               Ibidem. ca. 14. 
               By him that dyed and was so mightie, to vs that were mortall and altogether weake, both Iustice was commended and power promised. Of these twaine, the one Christ performed dying, the other rising. For what is more iust, then to come (willingly) to the death of the Crosse for righteousnesse? And what is more mightie, then to rise from the dead, and ascend vp to heauen with the same flesh, which was slaine? First then by righteousnesse, and after by power Christ Conquered the diuell. 
               Ibidem. ca. 15 
               It is no hard matter to perceaue the diuell to be conquered (by power,) when Christ, who was slaine by the diuell, rose againe: that is harder and deeper to be vnderstoode, that the diuell was conquered, when he seemed to himselfe to be the Conquerer; to wit, when Christ was slaine. For then Christs bloud, because it was his, that had no sinne, was shed for the remission of our sinnes: that whom the diuell iustly detained and tied to the condition of death, as guiltie of sinne, those he might iustly loose through Christ, whom being guiltie of no sinne, he vniustly put to death. With this Iustice was the Diuell vanquished, and with this bond was the strong man bound, that his things should be taken from him; which were with him the vessels of wrath, and bee turned to vessels of mercie.

               In this Redemption the bloud of Christ was giuen for vs as a Price, QVO ACCEPTO which being taken, (that is wrongfully pursued and vsurped, as the diuels manner is to take things which are not his, and not willingly offered or lawfully

receaued, as God did accept the same at the hands of his Sonne) the diuell was not enriched, but fast tyed, that we should be loosed from his bands. The bloud of Christ patiently shed vnto death was the Price of our Redemption by the witnesse of the whole Scriptures, which Christ obediently and voluntarily offered to his Fathers will for the full remission of our sinnes, and our perfect reconciliation with God. This bloud could not be iustly shed by any, because it was innocent and holy. They must therefore be iniust and wicked that should shed the righteous bloud of that vndefiled Lamb. Wherefore the secrete counsell and iustice of God deliuered Christ being thereto willing, into the

            This obedience and patience of the Redeemer, in suffering the rage and violence of Satan and his members, God so highly accepted and recompenced, that not onely his wrath was appeased, and our sinnes remitted, but all power in heauen and earth, as well ouer Satan as ouer all his kingdome, was giuen vnto the manhood of Christ, to take from the power and feare of the diuell, whom Christ would, and to adiudge that cru

               ll and bloudie tyrant with all his adherents to euerlasting destruction. For though the Diuine nature of Christ, in that hee was the Sonne of God, were a rightfull and powerfull Lord ouer Satan and his whole kingdome (sinne, death, and hell not excepted) to dispose thereof at his pleasure; yet the humane nature of Christ had of it selfe no such right or prerogatiue, in respect it was a creature, and so lower and weaker then the condition of Angels, sauing for the personall vnion thereof with the Godhead of Christ. And therefore as the wisedome of God thought it no match nor honour for the diuine Maiestie of Christ to spoyle the diuell, that was but a base and vile seruant in comparison of his Almightie power; so the iustice of God would not aduance the manhood of Christ to the heigth of his kingdom to rule all things in heauen, earth, and hell, till hee had humbled himselfe to the death of the Crosse for remission of our sinnes, and receiued violent wrong from the diuell in putting him to death. In reuenge and recompence whereof, as all these fathers confesse, God tooke iust cause to make not the Diuine nature, which had that right before and could not loose it, but mans nature, which Satan had by sinne conquered and subiected to himselfe, to be in the person of Christ conquerer and Lord ouer Satan, and all his power, to take whom hee would to make them vessels of mercie; and to reserue the rest as vessels of wrath vnto the terrible iudgement of Christ. Wherein these Fathers doe not swarue from the Pophets and Apostles meaning, howsoeuer they vse different words; that Christ shouldEsa. 53. v. 12.

            Neither doth Ambrose, when he speakerh of a Price required by the diuell or yeelded to the diuell, meane any more then a CAVSE SVFFICIENT why the spoyling of Satans kingdome was giuen vnto the manhood of Christ, and al the power of darknesse, sinne, death and hell, put vnder his feete. For a Price doeth not alway import an honourable condition, or a pleasing satisfaction, as it signifieth when it is referred to God; but as 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                in Greeke, which is properly a Price, noteth either Reward, or Reuenge; so doth pretium in Latine comprise both, and generally whatsoeuer is balanced one against the other, to be exchanged one with the other, is the price of ech other. So that it is no dishonour to the bloud of Christ to be so precious, that not onely the voluntarie offering therof did fully satisfie the iustice of God displeased with our sinnes, but that also the wrongfull shedding thereof (which was necessarily to be committed to Satan and his members, as the onely fit instruments for such an impietie) was a iust occasion, why God in requitall of that wrong, made the manhood of Christ the subduer and destroyer of Satans kingdome. Not that the diuell had any right or command ouer vs, against or without the will of God; but that hee was so blinded by the wonderfull wisedome of God, in reuenge of his subuerting the first man, that

he was made, by shewing his malice against the manhood of Christ, an Actor in our Redemption, and the Author of his owne subuersion, whiles without his knowledge, and against his meaning, hee was Gods instrument for our saluation, and his owne destruction.
            This you can not quietly brooke, because you make the chiefest point of our Redemption to bee the killing of Christs Soule with Gods immediate hand; and so farre are you from confessing Christ to be vniustly slaine as an innocent, that you defend him to be sinfull, hatefull, defiled with our sinnes, and hanged by the iust sentence of the Law, and the diuel to be onely a minister and executioner of Gods iudgement against Christ. Yea your similitude, if you stand to it, of prisoners taken in warre, and your ransome yeelded to God as to an enemie for his captiues, setteth iarres if not warres betweene the first and second person in Trinitie, by making God the Father an enemie both to the Redeemer and Prisoner. For among men, whose vse and custome you presse in this place, the detainer is alwayes a professed enemie to the redeemer, since confederates doe not vse to take or detaine ech others subiectes or seruants, but open enemies. The Ransomer then, and the prisoner haue one and the same enemy; and consequently by your resemblance, God is an enemie as well to Christ as to vs. The proofe which you bring, to shew God to be an enemie to his elect out of the fift of S.

And since the punishment of our sinnes was layd vpon Christ, and we healed by his stripes; if therein God professed Enmitie to his elect, and executed it all on Christ, the deuill being but the Iaylor and Executioner, or as else where you say, an Instrument onely, and by that parable not to be blamed, for doing no more, then he is commaunded by the Iudge; your wholesome doctrine commendeth the deuill as an obedient seruant, and maketh God an Inferiour, and yet an Enemy to the manhood of Christ. Which if you did not meane, you must temper your words and proofes better, and learne not so egerly to reiect euery phrase in an ancient Father, that pleaseth not your palate, when your selfe spake and wrote so licentiously and dangerously.

You positiuely teach, that Christ our Redeemer must suffer the selfe same paines of hell, which we should haue suffered. The reason you yeeld for it, is a poore similitude drawen from the common vse and custome of men in redeeming their captiues taken in warres. I replyed, that your similitude prooueth no such thing, because amongst men the Ransomers neede not, nor doe not sustaine the same seruitude

and imprisonment, which the captiues doe and must, if they be not redeemed. [Yet the whole price, you say, must be payd by the Ransomer, which the captiue otherwise should.] You reason from the willes of men, which preferre money before captiues, to the will of God, who regardeth no money; which kind of reasoning I reiect as n

It is therefore no way needefull by this similitude, that our Redeemer should suffer the selfe same paines, which we should haue suffered. A recompence aboue our power, and so not possible to vs, was easie to him, that so farre exceeded our condition; and that by your owne similitude might more then suffice for the prisoner. For though men will not take lesse then the worth of their Captiues, as they conceiue their abilities or likelihoodes of seruice, yet that doeth not hinder the Sonne of God to giue for vs farre more, then our value could, or can reach vnto, because he had infinite riches of holinesse, righteousnesse, and obedience in his power, which we haue not. He might not therefore giue lesse then we were worth, but more he might, and did giue: not by suffering hell paines in a sharper sense & greater measure, then we can endure, which is your fansie; but because those things, which he suffered, were of infinite price in his person, which in ours would amount to no such rate.
            From the sorowes which Christ did beare for our sakes, you came in your second reason to the curse, which hee tasted for our sinnes; and because the Apostle saieth, Christ was

You were answered by me, that before your conclusion would any way follow vpon your premisses, you must make your first proposition generall, that the whole curse of the Law, and all the parts thereof were suffered by Christ. Now this generall assertion, that Christ suffered the whole curse of the Law and euery part thereof, was not onely false, and farre from the Apostles words, but so wicked and impious, that without horrible blasphemie it might not be affirmed of Christ.

For what haue the Apostles words to doe with your three limitations? And if there be no possibilitie to draw Pauls speech to the WHOLE CVRSE of the Law, without apparant and palpable falsitie and impietie; why striue you for the generall, that you dare not stande to without three limitations, which prooue the generall not to be simply true? First then in steede of Pauls warrant, you obtrude your owne, and imagine your naked speech to be an armed proofe. Next you say Christ suffered the WHOLE CVRSE of the Law, saue three exceptions, which denie the whole; and so in effect you affirme, Christ suffered the whole curse of the law, and yet not the whole, but onely so farre as possibilitie could admit; that is in plaine termes, or in plaine trueth, it was not possible Christ should suffer the WHOLE CVRSE of the Law due to sinners, since by that suffering he could neither saue vs, nor be saued himselfe.
            This gappe was so great, that you foresaw euery man would eye it, and therefore you brack it vp with an other bush euen as good as the former. For in this wise you seeke to preuent that obiection. But you will say; [

               Thus we make it not the whole curse of the Law. Yes we call it rightly the whole curse, for as much as Christ suffered it in

his whole manhood euen in all the powers of his spirit, and soule, and bodie.] Here we see what your wisedome doth and sayth; but what saith the Apostle? Did he speake or thinke as you doe? His words we haue farre different from yours; now your proofe of his meaning were worth the hearing. Christ, you say, suffered it in his whole manhood. What then? Ergo he suffered the whole curse? You must found a new Vniuersitie, where your Logicke must get grace to proceede by it selfe without controle: it is so repugnant to all rules knowen to vs, that we can not so much as conceaue it. For thus you reason. The whole manhood of Christ suffered the curse, that is some parts of the curse: Ergo Christ suffered the whole curse. As well you may reason; the whole man in all Gods seruants performeth some parts of the Law; ergo all the seruants of God performe the whole law. You would be loth to be answered your debts, if you haue any, with such accounts: for if a man did owe you ten pounds, and with all his heart and both his hands did bring you ten pence, your reason here will conclude, he hath payd you the whole, though that I thinke would scant content you, if you were a Creditour. You be neerely driuen, when such shifts must serue you, or els be taken with a non-plus. What els is this but a cleere confession, that Christ could not suffer the whole curse of the law, when you dare not otherwise defend it, but that the whole manhood of Christ suffered some parts of the curse? It was, you say, Defenc. pa. 70. li. 3.

And if you recant that generall proposition, what handfast hath your conclusion?

               it were vaine and senselesse to thinke the Apostle here spake of two seuerall kinds of curses; taxing in your huffe not onely Chrysostome, who expresly teacheth, it was another curse, and not the same; but euen the Trueth it selfe to be vaine and senselesse, which euidently conuinceth the one to be in nature very much different from the other. For the detestation which God hath of sinne assoone as it is committed, whereby he reiecteth the deed as repugnant to his holinesse, and hateth the doer euen before punishment, is a plaine distinct thing from the vengeance that is consequent and agreeable to Gods iustice. Much more then doth it differ from the iudiciall punishments of men, whereto Moses pointeth when he speaketh of hanging, which though they haue a dependance vpon Gods will and law, so farre as they follow the same, yet must they differ as much as the persons, punishments and powers of God and man doe. Cursed, sayth Moses, is euerie one that abideth not in all things written in the booke of the Law. This curse is present vpon ech sinne, and generall to all the wicked in the middest of their greatest prosperity and securitie. The punishment due to sinne is not so; that is deferred till God see his time; and then most dreadfull, when men can not commit new sinnes, as after this life. Wherefore as all creatures reuenge mans sinne, and yet are not all of one nature, though in that seruice to God they al

                agree; so the plagues and curses of sinne be not of one nature, notwithstanding they be powred on men to punish their offences.

               I meane they are both of one and the same Nature, that is, true and proper curses of God. Well crowed yet before your courage come downe. Shall all things that proceed from one cause, or that haue one generall wherein they agree, be all of one and the same nature? Then men and mise be of the same nature, for they are both liuing creatures. Then angels and andierns, starres and strawes, and all things created, haue the same nature, because they are all the works of God. Then vices and vertues, and all contraries be of one and the same nature, in as much as they are inherent in one subiect, and destruent ech to other. And to go no farther then your owne example; then hunger and hell fire are both of the same nature, because they both are true and proper curses of God vpon the wicked. Be they great or litle, you will say, they are all punishments.] So the rest are all the works of Gods hands, and yet were it mad-merie Diuinitie to say they are all of one and the same nature.

               One was the whole, the other a part; but both of them the true and proper curses of God.] The one is the cause, the other is the consequent or effect, but not a necessarie, much

lesse an essentiall part of the other. For a man may bee truely accursed, and yet not hanged; as also he may bee iustly hanged, and yet not truely or properly accursed of God. The penitent thiefe on the Crosse came deseruedly to his death, as himselfe Luk. 23. v. 41. confessed, and yet was not thereby truly accursed, since he was that day receiued into Paradise. His death was an accursed kind of death, as also Christes was, though the one did blesse, and the other was blessed, euen vnder that punishment, which Christ did willingly and the thiefe patiently suffer.

               Paul saith not as you affirme, that Christ was made that curse, only, that iudiciall curse, whereof onely Moses speaketh.] Much lesse doth Paul say, as you teach, that Christ suffered the whole proper curse of the law. I measure Pauls meaning by his proofe, you extend it to your fansie. So that, as I say, Paul prooueth that he meaneth; as you say, Paul meaneth that hee prooueth not. Which of our constructions commeth neerest the Apostles mind, the Reader will soone perceiue.
            
               Defenc. pag. 69. li. 31. 
               Paul handling before generally Gods curse and the punishment of the Law against sinne, and shewing we are redeemed from it by Christs being made the same for vs, he confirmeth it by applying Moses iudiciall punishment against certaine transgressours, being it seemeth a figure of Christ herein.] If you may adde what fansies and falsities you list to the Apostles words, you will make at length some shew of proofe, if not from Pauls text, yet out of your owne trifles. There is not one true word in all this Preface of yours to Pauls proofe: for neither doth the Apostle in that place handle generally the punishment of the Law against sinne, nor shew, that Christ was made the same for vs; neither did Moses appoint (hanging) by any iudiciall Law against transgressours, neither were o
                  •…
               enders so punished, a figure of Christ herein. Paul in that place handleth the righteousnesse of faith in Christ, as bringing the blessing of Abraham, and freeing from sinne, which the law conuinced and accursed. The law threatneth a curse vpon euery breach thereof, but it inflicteth not actuall punishment vpon euery sinner. And therefore the curse of the law in Pauls first words is either the DETESTATION, which God hath of sinne and sinners, whom in time appointed he meaneth euerlastingly to destroy; or the OBLIGATION to temporall and eternall euill, which sinne hath in it. Neither of which Christ was made for vs, since hee tasted not the same, but another kind of curse, which was the temporall punishment of sinne by the hands of men; and by that obedience to the will and counsell of God, hee freed vs from the guilt and wages of sinne, which the law denounced. To note the differences of those two curses, the Apostle putteth the Article to the first for the more vehemencie, and not to the second, saying: Galat. 3. 
               Christ redeemed vs from that curse of the law, being made a curse for vs. The curse then or punishment of sinne in the person of Christ, was hanging on a tree: to which Moses by his iudiciall law adiudged no man. Deut. 17. Worshippers of other Gods, Leuit. 24. blasphemers, Numb. 15. breakers of the Sabbath, Deut. 21. disobeiers of parents, and 22. Adulterers were to bee stoned to death by the law of Moses. Gene. 9. 
               Numb. 25. Murderers were to loose bloud for bloud, and Deut. 19. false witnesses to suffer that they meant to others, whether it were eye for eye, hand for hand, or life for life. But by no iudiciall law, that I reade, did Moses appoint any transgressours to be hanged. By the expresse commandement of God, who is aboue the law, Moses tooke the chiefe of the people that coupled themselues with Baal Peor, and Num. 25. vers. 4. 
               hanged them vp before the Lord against the Sunne. And Ioshua vsed the same kind of death in some that were Iosh. 8. & 10. 
               strangers, and not Israelites: otherwise Moses neuer commanded, but onely permitted the Magistrate to hange transgressours; yet so, that Deut. 21. 
               the body should not remaine all night vpon the tree, but be buried the same day, because the curse of God was (executed) on him, that was hanged. So that God not appointing any man by his law to bee hanged, but leauing that libertie to the Magistrate so to reuenge malefactours, where the law did not specifie their punishment, they could bee no figures of Christ; as well in respect they were wicked, that must be so vsed, who were not fit to be figures of that innocent & vndefiled Lambe, as also that men had no power to erect figures of Christs

death & passion, but must leaue that to God to represent the sufferings of his Sonne as he saw cause.
            
               Defenc. pag. 69. li. 36. 
               They that were hanged by the iust sentence of the Law, they were herein accursed, that is they herein sustained the lawes true and deserued punishment.] But if they were INNOCENTS oppressed by vnrighteous iudgement, which is no newes among men, as we see by the death of our Sauiour; or if they were PENITENTS, though their punishment were neuer so deserued, neither of these could be truly accursed before God, & yet might be hanged, and so subiected to the corporall curse of the Law. For though Moses had no meaning to haue men vniustly hanged, yet had he lesse purpose to pronounce them damned, that died for their sinnes, if they repented: and therefore he commmandeth the bodies to be buried the same day, because the Curse, that is, the Rigour and Reuenge of the Law was executed on them; and consequently Moses extendeth not this curse farther then this life; which maketh nothing to the paines or perpetuall curse of the damned. And here the Reader may plainly perceiue you to sincke in the sands of your owne subtilties: for here you confesse, that deserued hanging is a TRVE CVRSE and PVNISHMENT, notwithstanding, if the guiltie repent, as the Theefe did on the Crosse; I hope you will leaue him the child of Gods mercie, whom Christ receiued into Paradise. And consequently by your owne confession, the paines and afflictions of this life, when they are deserued, are curses and true punishments of sinne to Gods children, though their soules be blessed by their submission and conuersion vnto God. Which ouerthroweth all, that you formerly haue said touching the troubles and vexations of this life, and that you presently meane to conclude of Moses curse applied to Christ.
            
               Defenc. pag. 70. l. 1. 
               By applying this text of Moses in this sense, and in this respect to Christ, it is well confirmed to be in nature and veritie the true and proper curse of the Law, which Christ was made for vs: for such also in deede was the nature of that iudiciall curse of Moses.] Moses we see had no meaning to make their soules accursed, whose bodies were hanged on the tree by the iust iudgement of the Magistrate, if the malefactours truely repented their wicked offences. How much lesse then ment he to subiect the Sonne of God to the internall or eternall curse of the Law, for that he was vniustly and wrongfully hanged on a tree by the malice and spight of his Enemies. And yet in both as well poenitent as innocent, hanging is called a curse, that is, a true and corporall punishment appointed by God for sinne, though mans error inflict it on innocents, or true repentance abolish the rest, that would follow after this life, if God were not reconciled vnto vs. In the wicked then, which persist in their mischieuous purposes without repentance, your reason taketh place, that hanging to them is a part of that true and terrible curse, the whole whereof shall be executed on them for their sinnes; but in repentants it is starke false, and in Christ of whom this question riseth it is irreligious and impious to say, that he suffered the whole curse of the Law prouided for sinne, or the death of the soule and of the damned, which is properly due to sinners.

               Now vnderstand Chrysostome thus, as we before haue distinguished the punishment of Christ and of the damned, and then we differ not.] Suppose Chrysostome to teach falsly, and talke absurdly as you doe; and then you may soone bring him to weare your badge; but leaue him at libertie to tell his owne tale, and hee is farre enough from your follies.

His words are: Chrysost. in 3. cap epist. ad Galat. 
               The people were in danger of another curse, which saith, Cursed is euery one which abideth not in the things written in the booke of the Law. For not one of them had obserued the whole Law. Christ then since he was not subiect to the curse of transgression, admitted this curse (to hang on the Crosse) in steede of that, to loose the people from their curse. Chrysostome truely, learnedly, and consonantly to the rest of

the ancient Fathers, distinguisheth two kindes of EVILS or CVRSES incident to men, which are sinne, and the punishment of sinne. The one is an vniust action pleasing man, but displeasing God: the other is a iust passion pleasing God, but displeasing man.Tertull. contra Marcion

               by Gods prouidence ruling all things, (as) man doth the euill, which he will; (so) he suffereth the Euill which he will not. Then sinne is not onely euill before it be punished, but a greater euill, then the punishment is; since it is an euill in his owne nature repugnant to the righteousnesse of God. Now as God is all good, and therefore all blessed; so sinne forsaking God, falleth from goodnesse, and so from blessednesse; and is consequently more accursed with God then punishment is, and ought so to be with men, if they be rightly aduised, as being the cause and continuance of their punishment. For accursed signifieth as well detested and depriued of blessednesse, as subiected to miserie, or deuoted to destruction. So that sinne in it selfe is a curse with God, that is hated and detested of God, and depriuing man of all communion and participation with the fountaine of blessednesse, though no punishment did follow.

                   said, Accursed is euery Mortall Man, or accursed is euery one that dieth. How thinke you, would Austen prooue that Christ truely died, because he was truely accursed, or that Christ tooke vpon him a Curse, because he tooke vpon him the death of the Bodie, which is the punishment of sinne in all mortall men, and so proceeded from the curse whereunto all men for sinne were subiect? He doth not defend the Apostle by Moses, but he expoundeth Moses by the Apostle, and so resolueth in plaine words, that Moses had none other meaning, when he said, accursed is euery one that hangeth on a Tree, then if he had said, accursed is euery mortall man, because death came first on all men as a Curse for sinne. You acknowledge not the death, which all men die, to be a punishment or Curse for sinne. But all the wit you haue, will not answere Saint Austens reasons. For the death of the Body, which is common to all mortall men, must of force be a blessing or a Cursing. If it be a blessing, why doe we beleeue, or hope to be free from a blessing? but if we detest continuance vnder it, and desire deliuerance from it, then certainly the death of the Body in all men, euen in the Saints of God, was and still is a punishment and Curse of Sinne, till Christ raise vs from it.

The Scriptures themselues in that point concurred with them, as I haue fully shewed in my Pag. 267. Conclusion, and you can not auoid it.

This then is one of your familiar trades and trueths, to set downe that in my name, which I neuer spake nor meant; and so by lying, when you can not by reasoning, to support your cause. Indeed if a man will admit your absurd and false positions, so much is consequent out of their words. For where you will not haue the death of the bodie to be any part of the curse inflicted on sinne, except the death, of the damned be coherent with it, as in the reprobate; it followeth from Chrysostomes words, that the corporall death of Christ seuered from all other sorts of death had no part of Gods curse in it besides shame, which yet is as farre from being a true curse, where the cause is good, as death it selfe; since neither shame nor death are true and inward curses, when they are suffered for righteousnesse, but rather causes and increases of blessing; not in, nor of themselues, but by Gods goodnesse accepting, and recompensing them with all fauour and blisse.

But as no wise man will say the Law is euill, when the wicked abuse it to kindle their lusts, so may no sober man say, that the death of the faithfull is good in it selfe, though by Gods goodnesse it bee made to them a triall of their patience, and a passage to a better life.

It is still an euill as it was, and the nature thereof is not changed, though the vse thereof be changed by faith, and the consequents altered by Gods goodnesse. Now things must bee esteemed by their nature, and not by their vse, as Austen teacheth. For euill men vse good things euilly, yet that maketh not good to bee euill, because their vse is inuerted; and euen so, saith Austen, good men haue a good vse of death, which is euill, yet that maketh not the death, which they suffer, to be good in it selfe, or in nature to bee such, as by Gods fauour it is to them. When the death therefore of the faithfull is said by Saint Austen or any others to be good, they meane the vse, and not the nature thereof; and when they say it is euill, or a curse, they meane the nature and not the vse. For touching the nature thereof the Apostle, who must be heard, saith fully and resolutely; Death is an 
               1. Cor. 15. vers. 26. 
               enemie, that must be destroyed, euen in the godly. And touching the vse thereof, the same Apostle saith. Philip. 1. 
               To mee Christ is life, and to die is gaine. Against this you neither doe, nor can bring ought, besides waste words, and places either not vnderstood of you, or wrested by you, as spoken of the nature of death, when they meane the vse of death, which the faithfull haue by Gods abundant blessing.
            
               Defenc. pa. 71. li 26. Your selfe doe say, The vengeance of the Law once executed on the suertie, can no more in Gods iustice be executed on vs.] In the vengeance of the law is comprised, corporall, spirituall and eternall death. The whole Christ neither did, nor could taste, and bee a Sauiour. A part he therefore tasted, which was the death of his body, and thereby freed vs from the rest, which was due to our sinnes. From the death of the body he hath not as yet wholly deliuered vs, but hee will; and in the meane time hee hath broken the linckes of death (whereby those three were coupled together) first in his owne person, who suffered the first kinde of death, and neither of the other, and by vertue thereof hath done the like in all his Saints, leauing their bodies for a season vnto death, as his was, that he may raise them after with greater power and glorie, then if they had neuer died. What doeth this hinder, but death may truely bee called a Curse, as in Christ, so in his members; and though execution of vengeance be restrained from vs, yet imitation of Christ is not excluded, neither is the generall sentence pronounced against the sinne of all mankinde, (To dust thou shalt returne) reuoked but by the resurrection from the dead [how then was it vengeance on Christ, if it were due to mans nature?] Death was due to mans nature for sinne, and consequently not due to Christ that had not sinned. When therefore it was laide on him, that deserued it not, it must be taken as the wages of our sinne in his person; and so was a wound to him, though a medicine to vs, because hee

               Our publike doctrine in England set foorth by Master Nowel, confirmeth as much. To the faithfull, death is now not a destruction, but a changing of life, and a very sure and short passage to heauen.] Euery thing that is licensed or liked, as profitable to bee publikely read or taught, is not by and by authorised in all things, nor made the publike doctrine of this Realme. You would faine oppose Master Nowel to Saint Austen, who if hee were liuing would giue you no thanks therefore. Saint Austens Faith hath beene allowed and receiued by all Synods and Councels since his time, and by the whole Church of Christ, as fit to guide and leade not onely learners, but makers of Catechismes; and therefore the match, if they were repugnant, is somewhat vnequall: but

indeede you haue neede to bee taught, how to vnderstand your Catechisme. That death is a destruction to the godly, can you tell who saith so, except it bee your selfe? That it is a changing of life and short passage to heauen, if you meane to the soules of the faithfull, as the Ca

               echisme doth, no man doubteth thereof; if you meane to their bodies, that they by death change life, and so haue a short passage to heauen, it is a notable falsitie, and heresie, gainsaying the verie grounds of the Christian faith. For priuation of sense, and corruption to dust, is no life, much lesse an heauen; except you will multiplie heauens as you do helles, without reason or trueth. It is most true which the Catechisine intendeth, that death is this to the souls of the faithful, but not to their bodies as yet till the generall day of resurrection; and then the destruction of death in their bodies shall bring them to the full possession of heauenly glory, prouided both for soule and bodie: till that time, their bodies lie vnder the dominion or power of death, which is not yet destroied in euery part of vs, because of sinne dwelling in our bodies, though it throughly be conquered in the person of Christ, and shall be likewise in vs at his appointed time.
            As little to the purpose is that, which you cite next out of the Catechisme, that Defenc pag. 71. li. 35. 
               Death, which before was a punishment, is now become a vantage.] For he meaneth, that death before had nothing in it, nor after it but punishment, and so was wholly and onely punishment; which now by Christ is altered, and made an aduantage to vs, as well in respect of the manifold miseries and offences of this life, from which we are deliuered, as in regard of the felicitie and securitie, which the soules of the Saints dec

And since the Apostle calleth it an Enemie to Christ, and Austen doubteth not to name it a corporall Curse, why should I not number it rather amongst the gates or powers of hell, then of heauen, since the diuell was the Author, and Christ will be the destroyer thereof.
            It offendeth you that I say, if we will reason what death is in it selfe, we must resolue it to be a part of Gods curse; which you say is no answere.

               Therefore Christes dying simply as the godly die, MAY IN NO SORT HERE BE CALLED A CVRSE, or accursed. You iterate the verie same in your defence. Yea, it is the maine ground of your second speciall reason. Defenc. pa. 71. li 15. Christ, you say, was made a curse sor vs or accursed in his death. But to die simply as the godly doe, may in no sort be called a curse or accursed. Christ therefore endured the curse and wrath of God truely. [Your Defenc. pa. 72. li. 6. 
               expresse wordes, you say, are; Death to the godly is no curse properly, but a vantage.] Are not the other your expresse wordes also that the death of the godly MAY IN NO SORT BE called a curse or accursed? and doth not the force of your reason wholy depend vpon these later wordes? For had you confessed that death, shame and paine were to the godly corporall curses; how then conclude you, that Christ was properly accursed? Because the Apostle saith, He was made a curse? Doeth the Apostle say, he was made a curse properly? It would empt and waste all the wit in your head, from the one to conclude the other. Against your prec

            In floting to and fro you fell to the curse of the Law, and the curse of God, and there, as your fashion is, you auouched what you listed, without any proofe or witnesse besides your selfe; telling vs that Paul mentioned Christs hanging on the tree as a part of the curse of the Law, thereby impolying the whole to be executed on Christ.

To this when you should answere, you turne with a trice to your world of wordes, and say, your question was, Whether death to the godly were a curse properly or no. But sir remember the reason was yours, which if you doe not fully proo

Now you hold fast to the ambiguitie and vncertainetie of the word proper, as though it were enough for you to deliuer Oracles with the breath of your mouth; you say the worde, and then the field is wonne.
            
               Defenc. pag. 72. li. 4. 
               Our question is not, what death is in it selfe but what death is to the godly.] You are so wedded to your owne wordes, that you vnderstand no man els, and scant your selfe. When I reason what the death of the godly is in it selfe, I speake not of the death, which they do no not suffer, that is not their death at all, which they no way feele; but since they die the death of the bodie, that death which they suffer, is to them one thing in his owne force, which they taste and endure, and the consequents after death, by Gods mercie prouided for his seruants, are most euidently other things, and he that cannot distinguish this, is no way worthy to beare the name of a Diuine. For the ioyes of Gods heauenly kingdome are after death prepared for the godly. Shall we therefore say, the ioyes of heauen are death? Besides the smart and anguish which afflicteth the soule when she is driuen from her bodie, death in it selfe is the separation of the soule from the bodie, with priuation of sense and life in the bodie, and resolution of the same into dust. The ioyning of the soule with the bodie was a most wonderfull worke of God in his creation, and consequentlyGen. 1. v. 31. 
               verie good, by the plaine words of Moses. Then is the dissolution of the soule from the bodie repugnant to that which is verie good, and of force euill; as being contrarie to good. The making of mans bodie fromGen. 2. v. 7. 
               the dust of the ground was likewise verie good, by the same witnesse of Moses. Then the returning of the bodie to dust againe must be an euill vnto man, destroying that excellent worke of God. And if sense, motion and action be blessings of God on mans bodie, then the bereauing of these must needs be curses in their kinde. Yea since life was no small fauour of God bestowed on man, when he made him a liuing soule; & (as all the rest in their degrees) was verie good: then death which is the priuation of life, is the taking of Gods good blessing from mans bodie, which cannot chuse but be a curse. It is recompensed, you will say, with a better blessing, euen with the blisse of heauen.] The soule is, but not the bodie, so long as death preuaileth on it. And this blessing consquent is no way pertinent to the nature of death, no not as the godly do suffer it; but it is a fruit of Gods fauour reserued for the faithfull in Christ Iesus, who remoueth death from their soules, and will doe the like from their bodies, when the time commeth. Without death, you thinke, we can not come to Gods presence.] And why is that, but because the corruption of sinne dwelleth in our bodies, which is not meet for the kingdome of God? 1. Cor. 15. 
               Corruption cannot inherit incorruption. And whence came this corruption, but from sinne? and consequently

the displeasure of God against sinne, both brought corruption to our bodies, and for corruption keepeth our bodies vnder death, excluded for the time from his heauenly kingdome.
            Yet this is no proper curse to the bodies of the Saints] Had you but once declared what you meant by proper and true curses, sixe lines had long since leuelled this question: but you according to the heigth of your skill, that neuer troubled your selfe but with a few fond conceits, and some vnsetled sentences, trace to and fro sometimes with no curse in any sort, sometimes with no true curse, and sometimes with no curse properly, and will not be drawen to steppe one foot farther. And though I haue no cause to how your timber, that you leaue ragged, yet for their sakes that would see the trueth, I am content to square your worke.
            Of Gods curse I must say as I did of Gods wrath; (for the wrath and curse of God are all one in effect) it noteth either Gods detestation of sinne, or his commination to sinne, or which is most to this case, Gods indignation or pnnishment prouided for sinne, or executed on sinners. For as man is sayd to blesse with his minde, mouth, or hand, when he meaneth, prayeth, or doth good to any; so is he sayd to curse by thought, word, or deed, when he desireth, vttereth, or worketh euill to any. God is likewise sayd to curse in soule, when he detesteth and hateth euill; in voice, when he pronounceth or threatneth euill; in iudgement, when he decreeth or inflicteth euill. To shew how execrable sinne is to God, the Scripture sayth, these things GodPro. 6. v. 16. HATETH, and his soule ABHORRETH them. And so, the way of the wicked is
               Pro. 15. ABOMINABLE to the Lord. The threats of God against sinne, and his plagues vpon sinne, are euery where extant in the Law, and chiefiy in the 27. and 28. of Deuteronomie; where not onely the greatest sinnes are namely and all sinnes in the close generally accursed, but the manifolde plagues of this life persuing the states, the bodies, and soules of sinners are numbred.August. contra Faustu

The plagues and curses of sinne extending as farre as sinners haue any parts, of which they consist, as bodie and soule; or places, in which they may be, as here so in hell; or pertinents, which they may haue or need for the ease and vse of this life; I called in my conclusion, externall, corporall, spirituall and eternall plagues or punishments of sinne.
            Contrarie to cursing is blessing, which is good purposed, promised, o
                  •…
                performed to obedience, as Cursing is euill intended, threatned, or prepared for disobedience; and so by the one Contrarie we may rightly measure the other: yea the names of benediction and malediction, which is blessing and cursing, are deriued from bonum and malum, good and euill. And therefore, as we conceaue good and euill, to proceede from the bountie or Iustice of God, so must we recken his blessings and curses to be.Matth. 10. 
               None is good but onely God; that is all true goodnesse is naturally, supreamely, infinitely, and vnchangeably in God, as likewise all true blessednesse is. Neither can any thing haue any degree of true goodnesse or blessednesse, but onely by deriuation from God, and by participation with God. Capable of God, that is of the holinesse, and happinesse, that is in God, and commeth from God, are no Creatures but men and Angels; since only they haue cognition and fruition of his true goodnesse and blessednesse. To omit the Elect Angels, that haue their measure of heauenly light and power, grace, and loue, righteousnesse and holinesse, ioy and securitie in the continuall presence and seruice of God; when God decreed to reueale him selfe to Man, he gaue him a reasonable Soule endued with vnderstanding and will, to discerne, and desire the goodnesse, that is in God, and by louing and obeying Gods righteousnesse, to haue Communion with his blessednesse. The better to declare him selfe to man, God gaue him a Bodie to be quickned by his Soule with Life, sense, and motion, as a Tabernacle for the Soule to dwell and worke therein; and made heauen and earth, and all the furniture

thereof, for the vse, delight, and safegard of his Body; thereby to assure Man of his exceeding care for man, and bountie towards Man; which were not onely wonderfull causes of thanks, but euident proofes of greater fauour, and honor reserued for him in the heauens, if he loued and serued the Author, and giuer of these earthly things. The integritie then, and safetie; the sanitie, Actiuitie, and perpetuitie of mans Body free from all dangers, distempers, decases, diseases, and death: The excellent beautie, plentie, vtilitie, and varietie of the Creatures seruing mans vse, obeying mans Rule, and increasing mans delight, were all the maruelous blessings of God on man, not onely testifying to him the wisedome, power, and glorie of the Creator by their natures, properties and forces, but leading him by the eyes, eares, and all other senses to the admiring, embracing, and honoring of that great and mightie Lord, that by these pledges proposed himselfe, with all his spirituall and vnspeakable riches, to be the spouse of mans Soule, and reward of his loue. He therefore that denieth or doubteth these to haue beene the blessings of God on man, when he first made man, and so to remaine at this present; is an vnthankfull and wicked abuser, and despiser of Gods goodnesse, and bountie towards him selfe and all mankind.
            The gifts of God on the Soule of Man were farre worthier then those corporall and externall blessings. For God gaue vnto Man reason and vnderstanding, to behold the greatnesse, and withall the goodnesse of God, and free will, to cleaue fast vnto him, without preferring any Creature before him, or matching any thing with him; as likewise affections to inflame the hart with burning and vnceasing loue; Man feeling no defect, nor finding any impediment in that innocencie, tranquillitie, facilitie and consonancie of all the powers and parts of the Soule and body, to the knowledge, loue, and seruice of God. But none of the gifts and graces of God, either outwardly prouided for man, or naturally ingraffed in mans Body or Soule, did make Man truely blessed. For had he beene truely blessed by these, he could not so wretchedly haue fallen from these into the Seas of miseries, and heapes of curses, with which he was after for sinne ouerwhelmed. Wherefore we must resolue, that as God is onely truth, because he is by Nature immutable; and onely blessednesse, because no euill can approch him, so no blessing can rightly be called true, but that which is perpetuall; nor full, but that which is free from all miserie. Saint Austen saith wisely. August. de Trinitate. li.

                   mutatur. There can be no truth, but a shew in the Creature, which is easily lost, and changed. And therefore Austen expoundeth August. de Trinitate. li. 13 cap. 9. 
               beatam vitam stabilem, id est, veram; a stedfast, that is a true blessed life. For how can that be thought a true blessing, which may end in euerlasting wretchednesse? True blessings then there are none, but such as ioyne vs to God, who is the true fountaine of all true blessing, that without any separation or defection from him, we may be partakers of him.
            By true blessing we shall best vnderstand what true cursing is: for as EVILL is no contrarie nature to GOOD, but onely the defect or priuation of good; so there is no true curse to vs, but that which bereaueth vs of our true blessing. August. de Moribus MAnicheorum. cap. 4. 
               Malum non secundum essentiam, sed secundum priuationem rectissime dicitur. Euill is most rightly sayd to be no essence, but the priuation of good. To cleaue fast to God, who is only and wholly our good, is the true blessing of men and angels; and consequently to be seuered from God, and to loose all communion with him, is the true curse of men and angels. The true blessings of God bestowed on his children, though they be indeed infinit, yet may they be reduced to these three summes, according to the times wherein they were, are, and shall be performed: that is, TO THE LOVE of God freely affourded vs before the world, whereby we were elected and adopted in Christ Iesus our Sauiour; TO THE LIKENESSE of God, which we haue in this world, where we are conformed to the image of his Sonne by the working of his Spirit, our sinnes being

remitted, that diuided vs from God, and our hearts sanctified with the faith and loue of his trueth; and to THE IIFE of God, which after this world shall be reuealed and imparted vnto vs in the heauens, where shalbe perfect blessednesse without want of any good, or feare of any euill. The priuation of these three blessings bringeth three euils, which are maine and true curses to the wicked. F

            Applie this to Christ and his members, and we shall presently finde by the rules of our Christian faith, how farre they agree to either. No true curse can be ascribed to Christ, which shall seuer him from God, without apparent impietie: for neither the fauour of Gods fauour towards his manhood, nor the fulnesse of grace and trueth in his soule, nor the stedfast and most assured expectation of euerlasting ioy and glorie set before him, euen in his greatest afflictions and temptations, may be doubted of by any that will retaine the name of a Christian; besides the perpetuall and personall vnion of his manhood with his Godhead, to which was consequent such a communion with God, and fruition of God, as no elect man or angell euer had, or can haue. Wherefore you must either defend, that the true curse of God did not seuer him from God, but that one and the same nature in him might be truely blessed, and yet truly accursed of God at one and the same time; which are monsters meet for your doctrine; or els you must wholly forbeare to aff

So that Christ, as I said at first, by submitting him selfe to a part of the curse of the Law, which depriueth vs of all earthly and bodily blessings, and of life it selfe, quenched the whole Curse of the Law, and by his shamefull, wrongfull, and painefull death quited vs from euerlasting death, which was the iust reward of our sinnes.
            
               You say if by the Resurrection of Christ,
               Defenc. pag. 72. li. 11. 
               the Nature of death were changed, then till Christ was risen, death was a punishment to the faithfull themselues. I wonder what meaning there is in this Argument. As well you may say that none were saued till Christ was risen.] Wonder then at your owne conceits reasons and Authorities. For if the nature of Death were changed, as you suppose it was, since it was first inflicted on Adam, I asked you how and when? before the change you doe not doubt, but it was a punishment, you must graunt, to the godly; for Christ neuer changed the Nature of Death to the wicked. Then if the change were made by Christs dying and rising from the dead; how thinke you doth it not follow vpon this confession, that death, BEFORE it was changed in the godly by Christs Resurrection, was a punishment euen to the godly? And to this end you bring the Catechisme in this very Section. Death which BEFORE was a punishment is now by Christ become a vantage.] If death were neuer but a vantage to the godly, euen when it was first inflicted, then the change, that you dreame to be made of death in the Godly, is but a fansie. If NOVV it be so, which BEFORE it was not; then BEFORE, what else could it be to the godly, but a punishment of sinne? My Resolution was and is, that Christ was first promised by Gods owne mouth,Genes. 3. 
               to bruize the Serpents head, before death was inflicted on Adam and his of-spring. And therefore the punishment of mans sinne following could extend no farder in the Elect, then to the death of the Body; vnlesse you will make Gods punishment repugnant to his promise of Christ made before to his Elect; which were to charge God with Inconstancie. And therefore either the death of the Body was neuer any punishment of sinne in Adam, which is repugnant to the Scriptures, and the full consent of all Diuines, old and new, or else it resteth still the same to the Elect, which it was at first, when it was inflicted on them in the person of their first Father. Indeede the promise of Christ to the faithfull brake of the sequence of eternall death, which in the wicked is coherent to the death of their Bodies; and that made God in his Iudiciall sentence pronounced against Adams sinne to comprise no more, but Adams returne to dust, for that he meant no more to his Elect, though he would suffer death to haue his full force against the Bodies and Soules of the wicked both in this world and in the next for euer.
            As for the Saluation of the faithfull before Christs comming in the flesh, I see not which way that should be endangered by their afflictions in this life. It is written of Lazarus dying before Christ, thatLuke. 16. 
               in his life time he receiued euill, and therefore after death, he was comforted. So that their chasticement in this life, which was a moderate and fatherly correction and punishment of their sinnes, could be no impediment to their saluation, but worke rather in them, that were patient in their troubles, as it doth in vs, an

               excellent and eternall waight of glorie. For in that the Iudgement of God began here in this life with them, their humbling themselues vnder the mightie hand of God with true Repentance of their sinnes and full assurance by faith that in the

promised Seede their sinnes should be pardoned, caused God of his mercy to

               As sinne is accursed, so all punishment of sinne, saith Austen, is accursed; meaning till it be released, and no longer a punishment of sinne. Which he auoucheth not of the wicked onely, whose punishment is perpetuall, and therefore truely and properly a curse, but of all the godly, when they suffer for their sinnes. August. de Trinitate. li. 4. cap. 12. 
               We, saith Austen, came to death by sinne, Christ by righteousnesse: and therefore where our death is the punishment of sinne, his death is the sacrifice for sinne. And that the death of our bodies is hatefull to God, euen as our sinne is, he resolueth in these words. August. contra Faustum. li. 14. cap. 6. 
               Nisi Deus odisset peccatum, & mortem nostram, non ad eam suscipiendam atque delendam filium suum mitteret. Except God had hated sinne, and also death in vs, he would neuer haue sent his Sonne t

For so much the more willingly God giueth vs immortalitie (of our bodies) which shalbe reuealed with Christes comming, how much the more mercifully he hateth our death, which hung on the crosse, when Christ died. Here you may learne that the bodies of Martyrs are so acceptable to God, that he hateth death, which detaineth them in dust; and that the loue, which he beareth to the one, is the cause why he will destroy the other, as an enimie to them, 
                  •…
               hom he loueth, and therefore iustly hated of him: but in the meane time, how false is this reason, which you so much stand on? God in his secret and euerlasting counsell loueth the soules and bodies of his Saints, as being the 1. Cor. 6. 
               members of Christ, and 1. Cor. 6. 
               temples of his holie spirite: therefore he hateth neither sinne in their soules, nor death in their bodies. Nay rather the more he loueth the one, the more he hateth the other, and sent his Sonne to destroy both sinne and death in his elect, as the Enimies, that hinder and defer the true blisse promised to his seruants.

               How Christ was made a Curse for vs. 
               made the proper punishment, or Sacrifice for sinne.] You reach beyond your strength, when you come to interpret Fathers. And no maruaile, for you that vnderstand not your Catechisme rightly, how should you intermeddle with expounding those, whom you neuer read, nor regarded? and that will well appeare by your exposition in this place. What Christ was naturally and continually in himselfe, he can not be said to be made that for vs. To be MADE importeth a change, which was not before, and FOR VS excludeth the respect of himselfe, and noteth as much as for our good, or for our sakes. So Christ when he was true God, and with his Father from euerlasting, was
               Iohn. 1. 
               made flesh, not for himselfe, but for vs,Esay. 9. 
               vnto vs, saith the Prophet, a child is borne, and vnto vs a Sonne is giuen. Euen so, when Christ
               2. Cor. 5. 
               knew no Sinne, he was made sinne for vs; and when he was the promised Seede, in whichGalat. 3. 
               all Nations should be blessed, he was made a Curse for vs. When then the Scriptures or Fathers obserue, what Christ was made for vs, they imply that before, and of himselfe he was otherwise. Now of Saint Pauls words, Christ was made a Curse for vs, Cyrill and Epiphanius bring two different expositions. The one, which is Cyrils, that Christ wasCyrill. in Defensio. 1. Anathematis. ad Ori

The other, which Epiphanius followeth, that as God promised by his Prophet, saying,Ose. 13. 
               ó Death, I will be thy Death, ó hell, I will be thy destruction: So Christ wasEpiphanius contra Marci

To both these you answere, Christ was not made sinne in himselfe.] As much to the purpose, as Charing Crosse to Cheape side. For they doe not onely say, that he was iust and blessed in himselfe, but they shew how Saint Pauls words must be vnderstood, that he was made a Curse amongst men, that is reiected and condemned as a wicked Malefactor; or that he became a Curse to the Curse, that is a Destroyer of the Curse due to vs. Neither of these can you refute, and therefore your Reason drawen from these words of the Apostle, is not worth a rotten rush to conclude any thing for your purpose; and either of their expositions hauing two parts; a Negatiue, and an affirmatiue, you cleane misse their meaning in both, and say they deny not, but Christ was made aDefenc. pag. 73. li. 25. 
               Sacrifice for sinne.
            
            Now if you remember Saint Austens words, on which you would seeme to stand, you shall see two Conclusions directly drawen against two points of your new found Doctrine. For if nothing can be truely accursed in Man but the committing of sinne, and iust suffering for sinne, as you concea

               sed, till it be iustly deserued. But Christ was iust and

holy, as the Scriptures auouch, euen when he suffered for vs. He1. Pet. 3. 
               suffered the iust for the vniust; and
               Act. 3. 
               ye denyed the holy one and Iust. Therefore Christ was not truely accursed by his suffering for sinne. And you your selfe before you be ware, confesse thus much, whiles you would auoyd these Fathers, and vphold the Apostles words as pertinent to your purpose. For you graunt the Apostles meaning to be, that Christ was made a Sacrifice for sinne; and consequently that he could neither be defiled with our sinne, nor accursed for our sinne. For a Sacrifice though it be slaine, and beare the sinne of others; yet is it not onely cleere from sinne, but holy to God, and accepted for sinne. If the Sacrifices, which were but figures of the true Sacrifice, were neither defiled nor accursed, though they were slaine for sinne, how much more then shall the death of the true Sacrifice be in deed vndefiled and blessed with God, for which all our sinnes are remitted, and our Curses abolished.
            And this iustineth both Cyrils and Epiphanius exposition. Christ was

               Christ not onely receaued on him all absurd and odious names, but that, which is most absurd of all others, he was called sinne it selfe, and THE CVRSE IT SELFE, though he were not so. For how should he be sinne, that freed vs from sinne? or how should he be a curse (indeed) that Redeemed vs from the curse of the Law? Nazianzene admireth Christs patience and humilite, that endured to haue himselfe accounted, called, and abused by men as a sinfull and accursed wretch; and saith, Christ was content so to be made a curse for vs, when indeed he was none, by the wrong, which he suffered at mens hands, to free vs from the iust desert of our sinnes with God. Which exposition I bring to let the Reader see, how much the learned and godly Fathers detested your proper and true curses in the whole manhood of Christ.

We are Redeemed, that such as pertaine to Christes grace should so farre forth die, how farre forth Christ himselfe died for them, that is onely the death of the bodie, and not of the SPIRIT. So that the godly are conformed and matched

with Christ, as touching the kind of death, which must be common to both; and that being a punishment and curse on our nature for sinne, why is it not truely saide of Saint Austen, that Christ receaued our curse, that is a bodily death, to free vs from euerlasting death, which is the true curse of body and soule?

Since then there are so notorious impediments, why Christ neither did, nor could suffer the whole curse of the Law denounced to sinne, and prouided for sinne, with what face and conscience you shift and shuffle this geere, let the Reader iudge, if he haue either godly wisdome, to which you appeale; or but humane sense, from which I doe not appeale.

               Marke if our publike Doctrine be not the same. Diram execrationem suscepit.] I marke well enough how you wrest and wrong the Catechisme, to force it to your error. The Chatechisme saith; that kind of death was aboue all others execrable and detestable, which yet Christ chiefly would suffer for vs, that he might receaue that grieuous Curse, which our sinnes had deserued, on him selfe, and so quite vs from it. That kinde of Death, which all men iustly detested and abhorred, Christ would chiefly chuse, that thereby he might receaue on himselfe the grieuous Curse, that was due to vs, and so quench it. The Catechisme then graunteth, this was all the kinds of Death that Christ suffered for vs, which because it was full of shame and paine, he calleth a greeuous Curse or punishment. What is this to the whole Curse of the Law, in which the death of the Soule by want of grace, and the death of the damned, which is the second death, are comprised? You would faine haue all men of your mind, and that maketh you thinke euery man speaketh in your sense; otherwise the Catechisme, if you peruert it not, is cleere enough from your conceits of hell inflicted by Gods immediate hand on the Soule of Christ, though it talke sometimes of things not altogether so fit for Childrens vnderstanding. And had the Catechisme gone farder to mention other degrees of our Curse, yet so long as, in se suscepit, is not precisely to suffer the same, but to vndertake and to discharge all, that is due to vs, Christ might well, and did take vpon him in his Body to pay the Price and amends of our whole Curse, but not to suffer all the parts thereof, which were spirituall and eternall death, though he gaue Recompence and satisfaction euen for those, when he quited vs from them.

These two deaths then, a Naturall by the hand of God on all men, and a violent by the hands of the Magistrate on some certaine offenders, haue difference enough a man would thinke; so that when the one is proposed, for you to runne to the other, is a manifest faile in your answere, and a flat confession, that you can not prooue, Christ was iustly hanged by the sentence of the Law.

which we must reuerence, because it cannot be but iust in him, though it be hid from vs. The sentence of the Law is the reuealed will of Gods reuenging Iustice, by that I vtterly denie, that Christ any way deserued to be hanged. And thus much Saint Peter affirmeth, when he saith,1. Pet. 3. 
               Christ suffered; the iust for the vniust, that he might present vs to God. If Christ by Gods reuealed will suffered iustly, then Christ himselfe must be vniust. But if he were iust, euen when and as he suffered, then were his sufferings vndeserued euen by the sentence of the Law, which is the will of God prescribed vs, that we must follow. Otherwise who can suffer as Martyrs or innocents, if we speake of Gods secret Iustice, since he hath cause enough to deliuer all men for their due deserts to death, when pleaseth him; though he be graciously content, that his seruants shall die most innocently in respect of his will reuealed, that is not for any offence, which their persuers can iustly chalenge; and most gloriously, when they giue testimonie to his trueth with their bloud, who yet in his sight may not, nor can not iustifie themselues. This therefore is another leape of yours, to start from the sentence of the Law to the secrets of Gods counsell; and most vntruely and iniuriously to pronounce men, that are sinners before God, to be innocents in their deaths; and Christ, that was truely innocent before God and man, to be iustly hanged by the sentence of the Law.
            As you misse the Rule, so doe you the Iustice of Gods will; and that which you would make to be the curtaine of your cause, I take to be the very puddle of your error. For where you would insinuate, that either Christ was iustly put to death, or els God did vniustly deliuer him to death, your ignorant abusing, or aduised inuerting the name of Gods Iustice breadeth in you this sensible ouersight. The Scriptures most truely confesse, thatPsa. 145. v. 17 
               God is iust in all his waies; not in punishing onely mens offences, but in giuing grace, forgiuing sinne, promising and performing life eternall; and generally whatsoeuer he doth, in him is iust and holie. There is as great iustice, that God should doeMatth. 20. 
               with his owne what he will, as that he should repay men their deserts. For if we ascribe no iustice to God, but in rewarding our works, then was he vniust in creating vs of nothing, when we could deserue nothing: then is he vniust in sauing vs, when he condemneth others, since we deserued no better then others. Accursed be that mouth, and minde, which calleth or counteth the fauour and loue of God, wherewith he embraceth his; the grace and mercie, which he affoordeth his; the glorie and blisse, which he will giue to his, to be vniust.

Which words Peter could not speake in respect of the Iewes, who killed Christ, for they tooke Christ to be most vniust, and they had no meaning, nor power to put him to death for the redemption of the world; but Peter speaketh this of Christ, who knowing himselfe to be iust and innocent in the sight of God, was yet patient and willing, when he suffered for the vniust. By this example Peter often exhorteth the godly to follow Christes 
               1. Pet. 2. 
               steppes, and to suffer wrong patiently, when they do well. For that is more acceptable to God, then when they are buffeted for their faults; because they are 1. Pet. 3. 
               blessed, that suffer for righteousnesse sake, as Christ did. You turne the text cleane contrarie, and would haue men beleeue, that Christ was not only sinfull, accursed, and defiled with our sinnes, but the greatest sinner and most vniust person, that euer suffered, as guiltie before God of all their sinnes for whom he died.

               If I bring not backe thy Sonne vnto thee, said Iudah to Iacob his Father, I will sinne vnto thee euery day; not meaning he would euery day offer new offences to his Father, but that he would be guiltie of that sinne for euer. Whosoeuer shall eate this Bread, saith Paul, or drinke this Cup of the Lord
               1 Cor. 11. 
               vnworthily shall be guiltie of the Body and bloud of the Lord; that is, guiltie of sinning against the Body and bloud of the Lord. Now the workeman is worthie of his reward, whether it be in good or euill; and therefore punishment is the wages of sinne worthily deserued, or certainly reserued for sinners by the Iudgement of God. When the high Priest asked the Councel touching Christ,Matth 26. 
               behold ye heard his blasphemy, what thinke ye? They answered he is guiltie of death, that is worthie to die, and so they
               Mark. 14.

               he that blasphemeth against the holy Ghost, shall neuer be pardoned, but guiltie (that is assured) of euerlasting condemnation.
            
            So likewise the true malediction of sinne is triple. For as the true blessings of GodThe Curse for s

            Come now to your Termes of sinfull, defiled, and accursed; and see how well theyChrist not defile with our sinnes. agree to Christ. First, if the holinesse of God were so great in his Person, as to purge our vncleannesse, much more was it able to resist our Corruption, and to keepe him from being defiled with our sinnes, from which he clensed vs. Againe, if he were any way defiled with our sinnes, he must needs offer Sacrifice first for himselfe, and then for vs. But this is quite repugnant to the Apostles Doctrine; who saith, Christ
               Heb. 7. v. 27. 
               needed not to offer vp (any such) Sacrifice for himselfe. Thirdly, if he were defiled by our sinnes, his office must defile him; his nature, nor Actions could not. That which was borne of the Virgine, wasLuke. 1. v. 35 HOLY, his life was innocent and iust;1. Pet. 2 
               he did no sinne, nor

               knew no sinne; his office was more holy then either of these. For these resisted sinne, but his office clensed sinne. Now to clense others from sinne, required more holinesse, then to keepe himselfe from sinne. The one is the holinesse of the Creature, the other of the Creator. And how should the Priesthood defile him, when the Sacrifice was holy, and vndefiled? Christ
               Heb. 9. 
               offered himselfe without spot to God, saith the Apostle directly speaking of his Sacrifice. And Peter calleth him the1. Pet. 1. 
               Lamb vnspotted and vndefiled, which must be in respect of his Sacrifice. For he was the Lamb of God,Iohn. 1.

if he were any way vncleane with his owne, or with our sinnes? and if our sinnes could then defile him, or make him vnclean, he is at this day sitting in the heauens, defiled & vncleane. For we haue the very same coniunction with him now that we had then, being members of his Body, as then we were, and he our head; and he still presenteth vs to God, as then he did, and euen by the vertue of those sufferings, which he sustained here on earth for vs. So that his mediation is now by the power of that Passion, which he then endured, and if his assuming Sinners into his Body, or being the propitiation for our sinnes, could then touch him with any vncleannesse, he can not be free from it at this present. But his Priesthood was holy then and vndefiled, and so remaineth still both pure and perpetuall. And if in the figuratiue Sacrifices of the Law, neither the P

               st, nor the Sacrifice were defiled with the sinnes of the People, but were sanctified and accepted, when the one did offer, the other was offered for sinne; what ground of truth can it haue, that the true, most holy, and acceptable Sacrifice for sinne, which indeede purged the sinnes of the world, should defile either the Person of Christ, or his office, or his action in that oblation. Lastly since all pollution of Soule is inherent, which you graunt was not in Christ, how should he be defiled, that had nothing in him, but holinesse and righteousnesse, which I trust are not defiled? If Christ were not defiled with our sinnes, then was he not sinfull. One sinn defileth, how much more then doth the fulnesse of sinne make Christ vncleane, which is your deuotion to the Sonne of God.
            
               I meane not inherently, but by imputation. [You meane he was defiled and sinnefull, not truely, but falsely. Did you speake of men, who erre in their iudgements, it might be borne; but when you speake of God, there is no imputation with him, but in trueth; vnlesse you will change the Apostles doctrine,Rom. 3. 
               Let God be true, and euery man a liar; and say, God must be a lyar, afore you can speake trueth in this behalfe. God doth impute righteousnesse to vs that be sinners, by pardoning our offences, and accepting vs for Christes sake, when of our selues we are most vnwoorthie; but vncleannesse he doth not impute, where none is found, because he giueth freely by mercy, and condemneth iustly by desert. The punishment of our sinnes Christ did willingly beare in his bodie, the guilt of our sinnes he did not, and that made his sufferings the more righteous, as being without desert or guilt. [Did God then wrong his Sonne in afflicting him?] he laide the burden of our iniquities on the bodie of Christ, who was willing to redeeme our danger with his owne death, and by the infinite dignitie of his person able to support the one, and abolish the other: and that the rather because euerie part of Christes manhood was holie and vndefiled, and so by the rule of Gods iustice no part of him could be pressed with spirituall and eternall death. Which is a plaine proofe, that the guilt of our sinnes tooke not hold on him. For then as well spirituall as eternall death, which both are due to sinne, must haue fastned on Christ, which we see to be false: yea the death of the bodie could not wrest his soule from him, but he must lay it downe of himselfe. And if the desert of a corporall death did not binde him, how should the guilt of eternall death be due to him, which was the

Whence it is, that the Apostle saith of the Lord Christ; him that knew no sinne, God the Father made sinne for vs, that is a sacrifice for sinne.

Master Caluin truely I honour for his great gifts, and paines in the Church of God; but I may not take him for the first founder of Christian religion, and therefore where he dissenteth from the worthie Pillers of Christs Church in matters of Doctrine, I dissent from him. And I more commend his warinesse elsewhere, and thinke it fit, that when his speech soundeth somewhat hard, or offensiueHard speeches should rather be qualified then strained to the highest. to the Godly, it should be expounded by other places of his writings, least you make him in so waightie points, as these are, very inconstant, or very inconsiderate.

not in all points proportioned to the other. God made him Sinne for vs, that we might be made the righteousnesse of God in him; Thus speaketh the Apostle.

               ? His righteousnesse is now imputed to vs, because it shall be perfectly inherent in vs, and is presently sealed vnto vs by the spirit of adoption, whereby our harts are inherently sanctified. Were our sinnes so imputed to him, that they should afterward perfectly possesse him? To vs God imputeth Christs righteousnesse without our consents, and often without our knowledge, as in children baptized. Were out sinnes imputed to Christ without his vnderstanding or will? In vs God hateth out sinnes, and ioueth our persons for Christes sake. To keepe this comparison, will you say that God hated the righteousnesse of Christ, and loued the sinne imputed to him for our sakes? And were there not so many differences in the maner of Christes hauing our sinnes, and our hauing his righteousnesse, as there are; yet are you no whit the nearer. For as we no way deserue to be his righteousnesse, so he no way deserued to be our sinne. And though God forget all our sinnes, and putteth them vtterly out of his sight, when he washeth vs from them; yet God did not wholly cast Christs righteousnesse out of his remembrance, when he did punish him for our sinnes. Christ therefore tooke our sinnes from vs, and layed them on himselfe; but he doth not take his righteousnesse from himselfe to giue it to vs, but doth impart it to vs, as hauing enough for himselfe and for vs, because he is God as well as man. So that all our sinnes were imputed to him to make vs iust; yet all his righteousnesse is not imputed to vs to make him a finner, as you would haue him; but he bare the punishment of our sinnes, which the Apostle calleth sinne, that we might receiue the reward of his righteousnesse, not in cogitation or computation only, but in deed and execution. For euen in this life, where we a

You heare the Fathers say, (for of their sense you speake) that God permitted the wicked to reproch his Sonne, and to put him to a shamefull and cruell death, as if he had beene the vilest malefactor amongst the multitude; thence you collect that God punished Christ, As he doth sinners, that is with the greatest and sorest torments of death and damnation, that are in this life or in hell. But this As doth rather plunge you into the mire, then plucke you out of it, and therefore you adde so farre as possibilitie admitteth. Now how farre that is, by whom shall we be tried? by the Scriptures and Fathers, or by your shallow conceits and fancies? you haue beene told often enough, that where the Scriptures make three kinds of death due to sinners, and for sinne; the death of the bodie, the death of the soule, and the second death, which is the euerlasting torment of bodie and soule in hell fire; and all the learned and Catholike Fathers hold the same confession; the two last deaths spirituall and eternall, are not onely impossibilities, but horrible blasphemies to be ascribed to the person of Christ; and to either of these, you would not yet speake one word, but by stealth. Now you haue gotten hold of a double As, saying that God vsed Christ, As he doth sinners, so farre As possibilitie admitteth, you thinke your selfe safe: and out of this As, you will frame vs new deaths of the soule, a new Hell, and all the same, which the damned doe suffer in substance, not in circumstance.

You alleage but fower words out of Athanasius, besides Prepositions and Pronouns, and in them you commit fiue notable faults, and three of them grosse, wilfull, and wicked corruptions. Sententiam, you call, the sentence of the Law; Where Athanasius expresly noteth the sentence, which God gaue against Adam for eating of the forbidden fruit: Soluit, you interpret, he satisfied; where the word is, he loosed or dissolued it:

                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , you render, of a Damned man, applying it to Christ for some countenance to your cause, in laying the paines of the damned on the soule of Christ; where Athanasius speaketh that word of Adam, that was condemned for sinne, in whose substance or forme Christ appeared, that is a true man, to dissolue the sentence giuen against Adam, when he was first condemned. And that which is most intolerable, where Athanasius in the same sentence the verie next words, expresly addeth, that Christ was altogether vntouched either with condemnation, or with sinne, to shew that he ment Adam in the former word of condemnation, you purposely skippe and neglect that which should lead you to the trueth of his speech, and directly against his plaine and manifest words, you referre Damnation to Christ, as if in spite of Athanasius, though he earnestly and openly professe the contrary, you would wrest his words to dishonour and belie Christ, and make the Reader beleeue, that some before you had ascribed damnation vnto Christ. But be ashamed of these monstrous falsifications if you haue any shame in you; or if not, your Reader will soone perceaue, what cause it is you haue in hand, that must be vpheld with such hatefull forgeries.
            Athanasius doctrine is very sound and good, though you will not acknowledge it,What Athanasius speaketh  of Adam, the Defender referreth to Christ. that Christ in his owne person, taking our humane nature vnto him, dissolued the sentence, that he gaue against Adam, when he condemned him for transgressing: and by his bodie dead and laid in the graue, he freed our bodies from the power of corruption, and with his soule descending into hell, he quited our soules from all the right and power, that hell had ouer vs by sinne. This whiles Athanasius mindeth to expresse, he saith; He that examined (Adams) disobedience, and gaue iudgement; comprised a double punishment in his sentence; saying to the earthly (part) earth thou art, and to earth thoushalt returne; and to the soule, thou shalt die the death; and thereupon man is deuided in twaine, and condemned to goe vnto two places; (to wit, his bodie to the graue, and his soule to hell.)

Christ then receaued a curse for vs, which in him was the chastisement or punishment of our sinne; yet as he no way deserued it, so was it not destruction, which lighteth on the wicked for their wilfull persisting in sinne, but a proofe of his obedience, and a full satisfaction for our offences, respecting his person that suffered it, who was God and Man, and is by Saint Austen called our Punishment, as well for the cause, which was wholy ours, as for the likenesse it had with the punishments prouided for vs in this life, where Christ suffered; and not in hel, where Christ could not suffer.Dio

               Your former sense that Christ was a sacrifice for sinne, how differeth it from your second, that he was punished for our sinnes?] With you it may be a question, with me it is none. For though they were both ioined in Christes sufferings, yet that is no reason to take away their difference. In the sacrifice, which Christ of

In his Martyrdome, he was a patient sufferer of that, which the Iewes with cruell and wicked rage wrongfully laid on him, when he was deliuered by Gods determinate counsell into their hands. Now betweene his patient suffering from men, and willing offering to God, there is some difference, if you could see it, though they were both coupled in his death. [they both prooue directly and necessarily, that he must be indeed sinnefull by imputation.] The one prooueth that he bare our sinnes in his bodie on the tree, but by no meanes, that he was guiltie of them: the other sheweth, that he clensed our sinnes, and so was no way defiled with them. [How could he be truely punished for sinne by God, but that he was sinnefull by imputation?] Because he was most willing and able to make recompence to God for our sinnes by the dignity and innocencie of his person, which we could not.

Shall it not then be much more iust with God, in whose only will and hand is the supreame power of all things, to release his wrath, and pardon his prisoner vpon repentance, and recompence offered to his iustice?
            
               How can any suffer at Gods hand, except he be reputed sinnefull?] For such as were his owne, Christ might suffer, and be no way touched with any guilt of their sinne, but rather accepted with God, and honored with men for the greatnesse of his mercy and charitie. And if he be no good shepheard, that flieth to saue his owne life, and leaueth his flocke to the woolfe; but the goodnesse of a shepheard is tried, as our Sauiour saith, by ventring his life for his sheepe; how commeth it into your braines, to make Christ a sinnefull and hatefull shepheard for giuing his life for his sheepe?1. Iohn. 3. 
               We ought, saith Saint Iohn, to lay downe our liues for (our) brethren. Shall that wrappe vs

vs within the guilt of other mens sinnes, or rather commend our obedience to God, when we venter our liues, our dueties so requiring, to preuent other mens harmes? [But God himselfe, you will say, doth not punish in this case; and therefore he holdeth vs not guiltie.] As though an haire of our heads could fall without Gods appointment and decree? or he would accept it as his seruice, if it made vs sinfull? What rude and lewd ignorance is it, to make that sinfull in Christ, which is commended to vs by his example, and commanded vs for his loue, and the good of others?

The Scape-goat, which you make a president for all other Sacrifices, but very falsely, was not slaine at all, and had no hands layd on him, saue the high Priests alone, and liuing caried away the sinnes of the people into a land not inhabited. What resemblance hath this with the bloudie sacrifice of Christ for sinne, or what comparison can you make betweene them but by contrarieties? The other bloudie Sacrifices, which vndoubtedly were figures of Christ, teach no such thing, as you imagine, but rather plainly confute it. For as in nature they were not capable of the guilt, but onely of the paine of sinne, which is death; so in vse they were holy, and in their reference to the true sacrifice, accepted for the sinnes of men.

This Suretiship of Christ, to establish with his bloud the new couenant, which God made with vs, not we with him, without all respect of our merits to pardon our offences, and to make vs heires of his heauenly kingdome; the Scripture mentioneth, which is no more like to your Suretiship, then freedome is to bondage. I therefore reprooued not the word, which my selfe also did vse, I reprooued your seruile applying the word to bring Christ from loue and libertie, which led him to be our Redeemer, vnto thraldome and debt, to make him thereby sinfull and defiled with our vncleannesse. And is it not worthie of reproofe, when a word is vsed in the Scriptures to one purpose, for you to take vpon you to draw it as you list to your deuices? It is plainly written in the Gospell; Matth. 20.

               I am a worme and not a man. Will you trample on him, as you doe on wormes? God hath giuen vs his Spirit as Ephes. 1.

               Defenc. pag. 78. li. 1. 
               You say Christ was not as a Suretie bound to the Law, but of a better couenant euen of grace. Verely a Suretie to vs of both.] Verely if you say, that Christ was bound to vs, or to the Law, in both; that is, as well to beare our sinnes, as to giue vs grace, you broch two apparant blasphemies. If you shift with saying, Christ doth assure vs he hath done both for vs, you slide from your former Assertion. For that both these are done by Christ, we bothagree, only you would haue him, when he bare our sinnes,

to be thereto bound, and in that respect worthely Trea pa. 93. li. 6. & 9.

I told you, that not onely we were in our selues to wicked and hatefull, as being Enemies, to haue any loue or fauour due to vs from God, but also the Person of the Redeemer was so full of might and maiestie, that no bands could be laid on him by the Lawe, because he was afore the Law, and aboue the Law, that vndertooke our Redemption. To this what reply yon? [He was a Suretie to vs of both.] But was he bound to vs, orIt is a most hain

It would well become the rest of your conceits, to say that Christ was bound to redeeme vs being his Enemies, and that the Sonne of God was bound to beare our burdens for vs. [He promised so to doe.] Then the Loue of God which began it; the Will, which published it; and the Truth, which performed it; are the more to be magnified by vs in the Sonne of God; who could owe vs no duetie; nor be bound to vs, nor to the Law. [Those are the greatest bands that God can enter.] If Gods Counsels, purposes, and Promises be bands to barre the freedome of his fauour, grace, and mercie; and in all these to impose on him a necessitie, then is there in God no freedome, but onely bondage; which God forbid should come within any Christians hart. He is most constant in all his thoughts, words, and waies; which we may not thinke, much lesse call debts to vs, or bands to him, without euident and extreame impietie; but as he giueth all things to all, and oweth nothing to any, which the Scripture calleth his Grace, whereof he is a giuer, and not a Debtor; so he cannot repent or change, as men doe; which we must ascribe to the infallible stedfastnesse of his most wise and glorious will; the only Rule of all his gifts and works. No band then, if you know what a band meaneth, can be fastned on God, since that hath in it a debt, which must of necessitie be yeelded, whereto the partie may be compelled and forced by the right of the Law, which chalenges in Gods promises are most prophane and heathenish Blasphemies.
            
               Defenc. pag. 78. li. 11. 
               It is written that Christ was made, Hyponomon, subiect to the Law, or vnder the Law, which you mightely denie against expresse Scripture.] You are so well acquainted with corrupting and deprauing other mens words, that you make no care to doe the like to mine. That Christ was vnder the Law, I neuer denied, no more then that he wasChrist made himselfe vnder the law by loue, when he was free from the Law, and Lord of the Law. vnder death; but I said he was not bound to the Law, no more then he was bound to death, though he willingly for our sakes subiected himselfe to the rudiments of the Law, (for of those the Apostle speaketh) to liue vnder them for a time, and to taste of death, that he might in the end abolish them both. For as Christ would be Circumcised, and Baptised, though there was nothing in him needfull to be pared or washed away, but rather that fulfilling all righteousnesse, he might commend both the one and the other with his person and presence: so would he obserue the ceremonies of the Law, not tied like a Seruant vnto them, but content to vse them, as Lord ouer them, till he saw his time, which he did not sticke to professe of himselfe, when occasion was offered. The 
               Matth 12. vers. 8. 
               Sonne of man (saith he of himselfe) is Lord euen of the Sabboth: And so likewise, Matth 12. vers. 6. 
               I say vnto you, that here is one greater then the temple. By which words of his it is euident, that he was not bound to the Law, who called himselfe, as he was the Sonne of Man, Lord of the Sabboth, and so of all the Law; but as he laide downe his life, when the Law could not take it from him, and was obedient vnto death, though death were in his power; so would he subiect himselfe to the carnall commandements of the Law, though he were free from them, as being the truth and end of the Law. For the Law was our Schole-master to Christ, to whom when we were come by faith, which made vs the 
               Galat. 3. 
               Sonnes of God, we were no longer vnder a Schoole-master. How much lesse then could Christ himselfe, who freed all, that beleeued in him, from obseruing the Law, be bound or of necessitie subiect to the Law; which neede not lead him to himselfe, nor could not force him, that was personally the Sonne of God, to be a seruant vnder the types and figures of the Law, farder then his owne wil induced him.
            I made a reason that Suerties bound to the law to pay other mens debts, might

not looke to haue all referred to their liking and power. as Christ had to his, but to answer the penalties of the law, to which they were obliged. Defenc. pag. 78. li. 15.

For after our transgression committed, and iudgement giuen vpon Adam and all his posteritie by Gods owne mouth, a Suertie commeth to late, a Redeemer is not too late before execution; and therefore the Scriptures doe euerie where giue vs a Redeen er, to note that we were condemned, and reserued vnder feare and danger of euerlasting punishment, till the Redeemer interposed himselfe, and offered such ransome and restitution, as should more content and satisfie the holinesse and iustice of God, then out condemnation could doe. The person that vndertooke our redemption, was not Christes humane nature, which as then was not, but the Sonne of God in his owne person assumed on him to make ful satisfaction for our disobedience; not by suffering euerlasting death, which was due to vs, but by giuing a better and more pretious recompence, then we were woorth. And this he would doe by submitting himselfe to obey and serue in our nature, and in our steed, and so offer the most acceptable Sacrifice of humilitie and obedience vnto death, that Gods holinesse might be honored, which we d

               spised; and his iustice satisfied, which we prouoked. Let all men therefore aduise themselues, how they binde the person of the Sonne of God to their obligation or condemnation; it was he, and none other that vndertooke for vs, and by whose fauour, power, dignitie, sanctitie and humilitie ioyned in one person with our weake and fraile nature, the worke of our redemption was performed.

So that our Suretie for foure thousand yeeres could not be bound to the Law by your confession: and when the same Sonne of God tooke vnto him our humane nature into the vnity of his perfon; HE, that is, the Person could be no more bound to the Law then he was before. For the Godhead was of more power to free the manhood of Christ in that Person from the Law, then our flesh in Christ was to subiect the Godhead vnder the Law. Wherefore the person remained free and vnbound, yet would he submit himselfe to obserue the signes and sacraments of the Law, as he did humble himselfe to the death of the Crosse, to neither of which the person was bound by any legall seruitude, but only by voluntarie submission, that his obedience being no way tied, might be the more precious in Gods sight.

               If ye be led by the spirit, sayth Paul, ye are not vnder the Law: for against such there is no law. Whether you thinke the manhood of Christ was endued and guided with the spirit, I referre it to your owne conscience. If it were, then against him was no law, though in loue to vs, which was the fulfilling of the law, he would humble himselfe, not vnder the law only, but vnder the worst of men, to be the

            Then as it is certaine by the Christian faith the Sonne of God could not be bound to helpe or redeeme vs being his enemies, nor to humble himselfe to the forme of a seruant, but only was thereto led with the loue of his Fathers glorie, and of our safetie: so it is euident, that the same person, after he had assumed our nature vnto him,

could not be forced with any necessitie, nor vrged with any commandement againstThe person of Christ could not be bound, but his humane will was gu

And therefore aswell the Scriptures, as the Fathers do plainly testifie, that euen Christes manhood had power enough giuen it to withstand all that was offered him by men or diuels, but that for our sakes the person would submit himselfe to the seruitude, infirmitie, miserie, and mortalitie of our condition; therein to comfort vs, thereby to redeeme vs, and therefrom to deliuer vs; which he could not do but in his humane nature, since his Godhead was impassible.
            This fredome and power not to be bound, nor compelled to any of his sufferings, we must reserue to the person of Christ, that his obedience might be meritorious and voluntarie, not only at his first consenting thereto, which is this Defenders drift, but in his continuall persisting therein, and finall performing thereof; that is, in all and euery part of those things which the wisedome of God thought requisit for our redemption.

If God so much respect the willingnesse of the heart, that he will not haue men tied with necessitie to doe good, shall we thinke, that he would binde his owne Sonne to the obedience of a seruant, and not suffer his submission to be voluntary, that it might be acceptable and thanks worthy to God?

For which cause the Scripture resolueth vs, that Christ Eph. 5 v 2. 
               loued vs, and gaue himselfe for vs, to be an offering and a sacrifice of a sweet sauour vnto God, that is, a most willing, free, and acceptable seruice, and satisfaction to God for all our sinnes.

And these multitudes of men, as you call them, though they be not of equall strength with the word of God, which is the touchstone of all trueth, yet doe they plainely prooue, that you innouate the faith of Christes Church, which in their seuerall ages they all beleeued and professed: and for their faith they haue the manifest wordes of our Sauiour, that none tooke his soule from him, but he laid it downe of himselfe; and the witnesse of the Apostle, that Christ for loue gaue himselfe for vs: which argueth, that he was vrged thereto

with no violence, necessitie, nor dutie, much lesse was thereto bound: and you for your deuice haue the curiositie of creditours, & the discredite of debtours, of whom men require Suerties with bands, because they trust not their words and promises; much lesle their willes and dispositions. But this iealousie in the Sonne of God, is hainous blasphemie; & therfore there could be no cause to bind him, as there could be no distrust of him, since our miserie, and his mercie were motiues enough to incline, and continue his loue, though we leaue him at his full libertie without all seruitude or necessirie.

So that Gods decree was no iniunction, nor ordinance, that his Sonne should doe it, but an ACCEPTATION of his Sonnes loue and mercie towards vs, and an APPROEATION, that it was a most sufficient recompence for all the transgressions of men. And the Father is said Rom. 8.
               to giue his Sonne for vs, not that he loued vs better then he did his Sonne, whom he infinitely loueth, as himselfe, and for whose sake onely he accepteth vs; not that he vsed any authoritie or power ouer his Sonne, to appoint him to this seruice; but that knowing the strength and sufficiencie of his Sonne, to be as his owne, and seeing his loue and mercie towards vs, which was common to him with the rest of the persons in that most glorious Trinitie; the Father out of the same loue towards vs thought it fitter to accept the offer of his Sonne, then that we should perish. And therefore though the Father loued his Sonne as himselfe, yet he was content his Sonne should beare our burden, which we could not without euerlasting destruction, and his Sonne could with exceeding honour, and admiration of his mercie, humilitie, obedience, and patience.

So that the Suertie, as you call him, that vndertooke our saluation, not onely from the beginning, but before the world, was precisely the person of the Sonne of God, and not the humane nature of Christ, and therefore you must either binde the Godhead of Christ as our Suertie, or free his manhood from all bands.

               Those sentences of your Authors Gregorie, Austen, and Ambrose, if they be spoken simply, seeme very harsh, where they say, that Christ could haue saued vs otherwaies then by suffering and dying for vs. For herein they oppose Gods absolute omnipotencie against his expresse and reuealed will; which how it may be liked in Diuinitie I know not.] Yours is more harsh, that reprooue them, before you vnderstand them; and chalenge that as false, which is most apparantly true by the maine grounds of Christian Religion. For if you auouch Gods power to extend no farder then his works, as if God could doe

no more, then he hath done, or will doe; is a manifest denying of Gods omnipotencie, which is larger then either his will, or his works; and though his works must alwaies be measured by his wil, yet must his power be limited to neither, because God is able to doe many things, which he neuer did, nor will doe. And in his works, if you bind him with any necessitie, to do as he did, and leaue him not at libertie to doe all things according to his owne wisdome and will, you reuiue the accursed error of the Manichees, against whom Saint Austen fully resolueth.

               Nullam ergo necessitatem patitur Deus, neque necessitate facit, quae facit, sed summa & ineffabili voluntate ac potestate. God then suffereth no necessitie, neither doth he the things, which he doth, with any necessitte, but with a supreame and vnspeakeable will and power. So that the words of Gregorie, Austen, and Ambrose are most true, that God had other meanes in his power to saue vs, then by the death of his owne Sonne; but a BETTER or more conuenient way to demonstrate his loue, and mercy towards vs, and to manifest his wisedome, power, and iustice against sinne, death, and Satan, he had not; for no Question God chose the best. And why these words should offend any Christian man I see no cause, since they be both sound and sober.
            They oppose Gods power against his expresse and reuealed will.] You were told, it is an error to restraine Gods power to his will, as if he could not doe more, or otherwise, then he hath done; but in this you conceiue them not. For they doe not say, God had meanes to change his will, or to alter his promise once published, but when he first decreed this way to saue man, it was in his power to haue appointed an other way, if it had pleased him. So that God was not tied to determine this way by any necessitie, as if the power of euill preuailed against him, or choyse of other meanes failed him; but this in the wisedome of God, common to all three persons in that most holy Trinitie, was allowed as the most honorable and acceptable way to God, and most fauorable and comfortable to man. And this confession, which you so much controle, hath beene vsed by Diuines of all ages, howsoeuer you know not what to make of it in your new Diuinitie. Cyprian before their time. Cypria

               Suretie standeth bound for a seruant, much lesse for a condemned, & dead person. Since then we were not only the seruants of sinne; but for haynous offences condemned, Soule and Body, to euer lasting perdition, and already dead in Soule by sinne; no course of Law allowed vs Sureties. Moreouer, the Prince who is the Lord ouer the Law, may be no Suretie, because he is not chalengable by the Law. how then will you bind the King of Kings to be our Suretie, as if the most Soueraigne were most subiected to the Law? besides, Christ freed vs by giuing himselfe, and his life for vs. What Sureties doe so? Christ bought vs with a Price to be his seruants. Doe Sureties buy their debtors to serue them? Christ gaue infinitely more then we were worth. Is that possible for Sureties? Christ did change our punishment in his person from eternall death to the death of the Crosse. Haue Sureties that libertie, or authoritie?

If you had auouched so much of Christes words, we would desire no better interpreter then Cyprian, who saith, those were the wordes of Christs beloued; and so that forsaking had no direct application to Christes person, but a mercifull relation to his members, who might often inwardly feele, that they were forsaken of Gods fauor and assistance for the time, though not as the damned are.] MEE, you thinke, in Christes words must signifie his person, and not his members.] But Cyprian is expresly opposite to you in that point, and saith; MEE there, is as much as MY BELOVED, or chosen members.

All which are most false of Christs person, for he then raigned in glory at the right hand of his Father, & endured none of those miseries; but yet they are most true in his members, whom he calleth by the name of himselfe, because he loued them as himselfe, & more then himselfe, since for their sakes he humbled, and emptied himselfe.

Then by Cyprians iudgement Christ spake those wordes neither for himselfe, nor of himselfe, but for those, and of those, that deserued to be forsaken of God, whom he calleth by the name of himselfe, as he doth oftentimes elsewhere in the Scriptures, because they were members of his bodie, and as deare to him, as himselfe.

                  ed. prophane collection out of Cyprian, that Christ suffered such a forsaking of God touching sense of paine and want of present seeling of comfort in his paines AS THE DAMNED DOE? You would faine set your infernall imaginations to sale vnder the names of some of the auncient Fathers, to inure your Reader with the name of the DAMNED, lest he should detest your irreligious presumption, if you should proferre these pedegrees in your owne name. But a man may know the fowle by the feather; and your deuices shew themselues by the verie vtterance of them. For expressing two points in Christes sufferings, the one is sensiblie absurd, the other apparantly false and wicked. The paine of Christes soule, you euery where defend, was inflicted by the immediate hand of God, and was the selfe same, which the damned doe suffer. Then how could this be called a forsaking in Christ, when it was rather a plaine persuing of him by Gods owne hand? Doth a man depart from an other, when he persueth him, or forsake him whom he followeth with the stroke of his hand? If therefore Christes suffering in soule came from the immediate hand of God, as you dreame; Christ should haue said, my God, my God, why persuest thou me? or why doth thine hand oppresse me? and not, why doest thou forsake me, and leaue me in the hands of mine enemies without any shew, that thou regardest or respectest me?
            The second point is farre woorse. For if Christ had no more comfort in his paine

the
                  •…
                the damned haue; then Christ for the time of his suffering had neither faith, hope, grace nor loue of God, nor any fauour with God, nor 
                  •…
               xpectation that hee himselfe should be saued, much lesse that he should saue others; from all which the damned are cleane cut off. Indeed this was the conceit, that the diuel by the mouths of the wicked did vrge against Christ, to vpbraid him with his case as desperate, and to persue him as forsaken of God; and therefore this resolution, that Christ was thus indeed forsaken, or felt no more present comfort then the damned doe, is plainly the diuels Diuinitie, and maketh as flat a contradiction to all the Scriptures, as any the damned themselues could deuise. For Dauid ledde by the spirit of God, sayth exactly of Christes sufferings in the person of Christ, Psal. 16. 
               I set the Lord alwaies before me, he is at my right hand, that I shall no

                   slide. Therefore my heart is glad, and my tongue reioiceth; my flesh also doth rest in hope. And the Apostle saith, that Heb. 12. 
               Iesus for the ioy that was set before him, endured the crosse, and despised the shame. And he that against these expresse Scriptures auoucheth, that Christ had no more feeling of any comfort in his paines, then the damned haue in theirs, I see no cause why the whole Church of Christ should not hold him madde, or woorse. But you meane no present comfort.] As if faith, hope, and grace, the assured fauour, and promise of God, yea personall coniunction with God, and his owne certaine knowledge that he should rise againe the third day Lord of the quicke and dead, and Sauiour of the whole world, did not yeeld him present comfort in the middest of his greatest paine; insomuch that the Apostle saith, Christ endured the crosse, (hee meaneth with patience) and des

AS A SVERTIE BOVND TO THE LAVV, you put BOVND in your pocket, to serue you an other banket against you be disposed; where if you did loue trueth, as well as you doe talke, you would farely report, though you did not fully vnderstand my words. I said, it was not written in the Scriptures, that Christ Ibid. li. 25. 
               was a Suertie to the Law to pay our debts; If you haue found where it is so written, shew the place, and take the prize: you will prooue it out of my words, you say; at least if you could; and yet betweene my wordes and the Scriptures, when you liste, you can put difference enough. But let vs see how you deduce it out of my words, that Christ was bound to the Law to pay our debts for vs. That he did submit himselfe to the curse of the Law, to discharge vs from all our debts to the Law, I neuer denied; the Apostle saith, Galat. 3. 
               Christ redeemed vs from the curse of the Law, being made a curse for vs, that is in our steeds, or to our vse. The Question is whether he did this willingly, freely, and of his owne accord, as I with the whole Church of Christ affirme he did; or whether he were bound to the Law so to do, which is your new found faith to defile Christ with our sinnes, and to hang him iustly by the sentence of the Law. You haue laboured a long while in vaine, saying much and proouing nothing; what now conclude you out of my words?
            The vengeance of the Law was executed on him as our Suertie.] The vengeance of the Law due to vs was executed on him, that of his owne fice-will put himselfe in our places, by his suffering (who was an innocent, and the Sonne of God) to ouerthrow the curse of the Law, which we could neuer haue done, but rather by our punishment haue confirmed it. How prooue you now, that he was bound thus to doe, or that the Law did allow vs Suerties? You haue my words, make your best of them. [He was our Suertie.] May not a man as well freely, when hee seeth his time, dischargeA man may a

                  scharge an others dobt and not be bound thereto. an others debts, as if he were bound? must euerie man, that will shew mercy, be thereto tied with bands? was not the loue, which the Sonne of God bare vnto vs, as good an assurance, as all the bands you haue brought in, to make him a seruant vnder the Law, that was Lord ouer the Law? [Those are not properly Suerties.] Amongst Banckrowts and Vsurers they are not, but honest and able men do most desire such. How much lesse then ought we to binde the Sonne of God, as if his credite were crazed, or haue him in suspition, except he will enter an obligation to redeeme vs? [The debt can not now by Gods iustice be exacted on vs.] And why? becauseThe rule of Iustice suffereth the stronger to beare the burden of the weaker. God in his mercie towards vs, liked rather to accept the obedience of his Sonne for vs, then to execute his vengeance on vs. Which since he did no way owe for himselfe, being not onely a most innocent man, but the most excellent Lord of heauen and earth, his sufferings were in vaine, if they preuailed not for vs. [For vs then they were iust.] Farre woorse were well deserued by vs, and reserued for vs, if the Lord of glorie had not interposed himselfe: but his willing admitting the punishment due to vs in his owne bodie did not make him guiltie of our sinnes, nor woorthie of our punishment. [If Christes sufferings were iust in him, how was he an innocent?] Because God is as well righteous in his fauour, as in his anger; and no lesse iust in sauing his elect, then in condemning his enemies. Wherefore Christes sufferings were not due to him by Gods reuenging iustice; but in his righteous mercie towards vs, he laid our burden on him, who was well able to beare it, and of his owne good will desired it. And this suffering as an innocent, with his vndeserued death to releeue others, was more righteous and glorious in the sight of God by infinite degrees, then if he had patiently suffered, and deserued it. It was therefore exceeding mercy in the Sonne to offer it, and maruellous clemencie in the Father to accept it; and in both most admirable loue to performe it, which is neuer vniust with God. And this though you for a shift call Law, the Scriptures call grace by faith in Christ, which is not of the Law, nor by the Law, that increaseth sinne and causeth anger. Iohn. 1. 
               For the Law was giuen by Moses, but grace and trueth by Iesus Christ. But heereof I haue spoken enough before, I may not repeat it for your pleasure.

               Your Similitude of a Kings Sonne intreating for his Fathers Rebels is very weake,

and ouerthroweth, if it were good, a confessed point of Christs Redemption.] Because you coyne new Principles of Religion, you thinke your selfe Authorized to make newe Rules for Similitudes. In the Scriptures it is not required, that Similitudes made ofSimilitudes are not alwaies of things lawfull. God, or of Christ his Sonne, should be lawfull in euery part of the Comparison, but onely that they be possible, and so propose the thing which the holy Ghost would intimate. 1. Thess. 5. 
               The day of the Lord shall come euen as a Theife in the night. Will you iustifie night Robbers because Christs comming is resembled to theirs? Christ draweth. a comparison from the Luke 18. 
               vnrighteous Iudge, to God; and taketh likewise a Similitude from Matth. 25. 
               Vsurers and Extortioners to teach that God will haue his gifts carefully imployed. Will you by that Parable make it lawfull to lend money for aduantage? Or for men to reape, where they did not sow, because these things are proportioned to Gods graces? Christ bringeth the Similitude of an vnfaithfull Steward, that wasted his Masters goods, and abated his Masters debts; and saith, the Lord (and Master) Luke. 16. 
               commended the vniust Steward, that he had done wisely. Will you hence vphold prodigalitie and infidelitie in seruants, which cosen their Masters, rather then they will worke or want? Similitudes we see of things most vnlawfull are made and referred to Gods Actions by Christ himselfe, and therefore it is no weakning to my Similitude (whatsoeuer you say,) that no King hath power by Gods Law to lay bodily death on his Innocent Sonne. I doe not by that resemblance make any thing lawfull or vnlawfull; but shew how euill it becommeth Prisoners and Captiues to twite or vpbraid their Redeemers and deliuerers, as if they were defiled, and guiltie of their Sinnes, for whom they mediate and intreate. Of bodily death I spake neuer a word, that is your Idle conceite added to my comparison.
            But the Similitude fitteth not Christs sufferings in our Redemption.] No more doth any Similitude, that man can make. I say of Christs death, as Saint Austen saith of his birth. August. Epist. 3. ad Vo

                  us. 
               If you seeke for areason, it shall not be wonderfull; if you aske for an example, it shall not be singular. The Acts of men may in some sort resemble or imitate, they cannot match or euen the works of God. But why are you so curious in other mens Similitudes, that are so carelesse of your own? Doth your example of a Suretie fit the bodily sufferings of Christ? I hope humane lawes haue no power, nor practise to take mens liues away for Suretiship; nay they allow no Sureties for any corporall paines, as we saw before, because no man is Master of his owne Body to engage the whole, or any part thereof to be mangled or maymed, vnlesse he will be an homicide of himselfe, which Gods Law doth not permit, nor mans Law accept. How much lesse then doth your Suretie resemble the paines of the damned suffered in the Soule of Christ, as you say, from the immediate hand of God? If men haue no power to pawne their owne Soules, nor to kill other mens; your similitude of a Suretie bound to the Law to pay an other mans debts, is as wide from Christes sufferings, as mine and farre wider. For he must be Suretie not onely life for life, but Soule for Soule, which Mans Law doth not meddle with. And yet your owne example of a Suretie serueth my turne to declare your Doctrine to be false, as well as any other. For if a Man fined by a Court for ryots, contempts, or other misdemeanures, and committed to prison till he pay the same, find friends that to purchase his libertie, will make present payment of his fine; haue you any reason or conscience to charge them as guiltie, or partakers of those Riots, or other offences done by him whom they deliuer? If men may be Sureties, Mediators, and ransomers of others, and yet not deserue to be blamed for other mens Crimes; why could not the Sonne of God take vpon him the punishment of our sinnes, and yet be most free from the fault and guilt thereof? [Because God did punish Christ, you will say, with his immediate hand, which he would not doe, if Christ were Innocent.] Soft Sir, that is no way prooued, but barely pretended by you, that God was the Tormentor of Christs Soule with his immediate hand: The Scriptures teach the contrarie, that God Marke. 14. 
               deliuered him into the hands of sinners, 
               Acts. 4. 
               to doe what soeuer Gods hand and counsell had determined before to be done. And though the wicked be Esa. 10. 
               the Rod of Gods wrath; and the staffe in their hands

is his Indignation; Yet serue they their malice in afflicting the faithfull, when God hath an other end, which is most iust and holy, to put his Saints to the tryall of their obedience, and patience, in suffering for righteousnesse sake, that he may be glorified in them, and they exalted and crowned by him. In the cruell and wrongfull death of his Sonne, to which Christ willingly submitted himselfe, God had farre greater and waightier causes and works, euen the Redemption of the world, and the demonstration of his Diuine power and wisedome, and such like, which I haue often mentioned, and therefore doe presently passe them with silence.
            
               Defenc. pag. 80. li. 28. 
               An other Reason of mine you impugne with marueylous skorne and detestation. That seeing Christ on the Crosse spoyled powers and Principalities, and made a shew of them openly triumphing ouer them; Therefore I collected that Christ selt (the diuels) as the very instruments, that wrought the very effects of Gods wrath vpon him. I grant I tooke it to be not a ridiculous, but impious iest rather then a tolerable reason, for you to conclude, that because Christ triumphed ouer diuels, therefore diuels tormented his Soule with the very effects of Gods wrath; which euery where you make to be the paines of the damned. And surely as yet, why I should conceiue better of it, I see nothing either proued or produced by you. First you assume, that these words of the Apostle were spoken of Christ hanging on the Crosse; but what Scripture assureth that besides your selfe? you peremptorily put it into the Text by saying, Trea. pa. 45 li. 9. 
               Christ on the Crosse spoyled Principalities, but your additions are no good illations with me. The place, if you take the paines to turne to it, doth rather shew the Contrarie. To proue that the faithfull are tied neither to the Rites and shadowes of the Law, nor to any submission or seruice of Angels, the Apostle bringeth Christs death for the one, where the handwriting of Ceremonies, that kept vs in bondage, was fastned to the Crosse, and so cancelled, and we freed from it; and for the other he bringeth Christs Resurrection, by which all contrarie powers were openly spoyled, triumphed, and subiected to Christ, as to the head of all power and principalitie. (Yee were) Co'oss. 2. 12. 
               buried with him in Baptisme, (saith Paul) with whom yee were also raised; and (when yee were) 
               Vers. 13. 
               dead in sinnes, and in vncircumcision of your flesh, he quickned (you) together with him, forgiuing your sinnes, (and) 14. 
               cancelling the hanauriting of ordinances that was against vs: (and) 15. 
               spoyling powers and principalities, he made an open shew of them, triumphing ouer them in himselfe. Yee died and were buried with Christ, who fastned the handwriting of ordinances to the Crosse, that he might abolish it, from hauing any right to tie or yoke his members. Yee likewise were quickned, and raised together with Christ, who rising spoyled powers and principalities, and triumphed ouer them in his own Person, that he alone might be Lord of quicke and dead, of Men and Angels: so that these words, (spoyling powers and Principalities, and triumphing ouer them,) are not referred to the Crosse, for any thing that appeareth in the Text, but to Christs Resurrection, and take their truth and force from his subiecting all power in heauen and earth vnder him by his rising againe from the dead. This triumph ouer Satan and all his kingdome the same Apostle to the Ephesians setteth downe as a consequent to Christs death, and pertinent to his Resurrection. Ephes. 4. 
               Ascending on high he led Captiuitie Captiue; and this, he ascended, what meaneth it, but that he descended first into the lower parts of the earth? So that ascending from the lower parts of the earth, he led Captiuitie Captiue, which is all one with, he triumphed ouer powers and Principalities.
            
            The Syriack translation of the New Testament, together with the ancientest of the Latine Fathers, doth not only so interpret the place, but it doth expresse so much in the verie text; that Christ had this conquest after his death.

By rising from the lower parts, Christ triumphed and spoiled principalities and powers, carying them captiue in maner of a triumph, as is in the second to the Colossians: but he also giueth his testimony of it. Therefore nothing hindereth, but what Paul here writeth, we may interpret, as the words doe sound, of a reall triumph of Christes soule (seuered from his bodie) in the sight of God onely, and of the blessed spirits, specially since the Fathers for the most part do so expound it, and of our writers not a few, nor the meanest. Bethinke your selfe now, how wide you range from the Apostles meaning by the exposition of so many learned and ancient writers. Christ rose Conquerer of death and hell. Ergo, say you, the diuels tormented Christes soule before he died, with the very paines of the damned. If any man be so patient to like this Logicke, and not to laugh at it, I much maruell, seeing the Conclusion so meere a stranger to the Antecedent, which hath no coherence with it.

[There was a conflict, you thinke, before the conquest.] A conflict argueth a resistance for the time, but no preualence. Reuel. 12. 
               There was a battell in heauen (sayth S. Iohn) Michael and his Angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon fought, and his Angels, but they preuailed not. And the great dragon, called the Diuell and Satan, was cast out into the earth. Shall we say, that the dragon and his angels, euen the Diuell and his assistants, preuailed against Christ, because they resisted and encountered him? If this please you not, take the Similitude which our Sauiour himselfe vseth of his owne doings towards the Diuell. Luk. 11. 
               When a strong man armed keepeth his house, the things that he possesseth are in peace: but when a stronger then he entreth vpon him, and ouer commeth him, he taketh away all his armour wherein he trusted, and diuideth his spoiles.

               And no man can enter into a strong mans house, and take away his goods, except he first binde that strong man, and then spoile his house. If Christ then did enter on Satan, and binde him, and disarme him, and so spoile him, that he might make an open shew of him, and of all his power; what necessitie is there, that Christ being the stronger, should be endangered or oppressed by Satan, farther then hee himselfe would? The conquest was bloudie; for so much as in ouercomming Satan, Christ lost his life. He lost it not, he layed it downe to put the diuell to greater confusion: for when he was, not onely weake and wounded vnto death, but past all helpe and

hope, as Satan in his pride presumed, then Christ raised himselfe from the dead, and ouerthrew the whole kingdome and strength of Satan, spoiling him of all his force, and leading him captiue with a most glorious triumph in the sight of God and his Angels.

               Doth not the verie maner of speech import some mightie contention and violent opposition, where yet at length an absolute and most glorious triumphant victorie was obtained?] The words import a glorious conquest, but what contention or opposition could there be betweene the Sonne of God and the diuell, farther than pleased Christ himselfe to permit and admit? I hope you will giue the diuell no power nor abilitie to resist God against his will. It was Gods will, and Christs good liking, that the Genes. 3. 
               serpents head should be crushed by biting the heele of the promised seed; for so the Scripture expresseth the contention and opposition, that Satan should be suffered to haue against Christ. Grant then Christ suffered the diuell, by the violent hands and tongues of the Iewes to doc his worst (which may be proued by other places of Scripture, though not by this that you bring) what thence inferre you? [Defenc. pag. 81. li. 1. 
               This must be conceiued and felt by Christ.] What must Christ conceiue and feele? The question is not whether Christ wanted sense, but what the diuell did against him. [Pag. 81. li 2. 
               These could be none other effects, but only of Gods proper wrath, seueritie, and indignation against the sinne of the world. We are no whit the wiser for this answer, though this be plainly repugnant to your former principles, which make the soules proper suffering in Christ to be from the immediate hand of God, and that the diuell, I trust, is not. If it be truth that you teach, why speake you not more directly and particularly, what it was that Christ suffered from the diuell? Are your mysteries so bottomlesse, that they can not; or so truethlesse, that they may not be specified? [Defenc. pag. 81 li. 4. 
               It could not be the reuealing of any glorie or comfort, which such instruments procured vnto him, and wrought vpon him.] Make you the diuell the authour of Reuelations vnto Christ? It may be he is the founder of your fansies; but Christ needed no such Reuealers. Or do you reason, that because the diuell reuealed no comfort to Christ, therefore he tormented the soule of Christ? These are some new found Reuelations, they are no conclusions in any diuine or humane learning. [Against this you bring not a word.] I need not bring any thing against it, till you bring somewhat for it; but you be farre from prouing it, that can not, or dare not expresse it.

The testimonie of the Holy Ghost is as true as yours is false, and hath no more concordance with your conceits than light hath with darknesse. [A conquest, you say, implieth first a conflict;] But a conquest extendeth farther than the conflict: for not only the persons and weapons of the resistants are in the Conquerers power, but all the goods, rights and dominions, that any way belong to the vanquished. It is therefore true, that Christ subduing Satan, subdued sinne, hell, eternall malediction, confusion, desperation, and damnation: but these things did not inwardly assault Christ, howsoeuer by the mindes and mouthes of the wicked Christ was reputed and reproched as a reprobate. The Scriptures then describe the outward tentations and afflictions, that Christ suffered from the malicious thoughts, tongues, and deeds of the Iewcs fired and inflamed by Satan to this mischiefe; but of your mysticall, internall, and Satanicall

prouocations and torments the holy Ghost speaketh not a word. I gaue you occasion enough to speake of these things, when I tolde you the diuell had nothing to doe with the soules of men, but either to tempt them, or torment them, which words you report; but you after your loose maner leade your Reader by by-wayes and crosse-paths, to eye other things, & then you glance at my exceptions, forgetting still, that the reason which you made, remaineth both weake and idle, for ought that you haue brought, first or last.

               Before I answer you directly, this we may consider: Christ might, and no doubt he did in his soule discerne, conceiue, and applie to himselfe, all the rage, malice, and violence of the Iewes tormenting him to death, as set on fire by Satan himselfe, and by all the powers of hell.] You were to proue, the diuell himselfe did worke on the Soule of Christ without any meanes of men, whom he maketh his Instruments for his wicked purposes; and now you tell vs that Satan did set the Iewes hands and tongues on worke, to reproch the Soule, and torment the Body of Christ. This that you last say, is most true, and ouerthroweth all that you would say. For if Christ discerned and felt no worke nor force of Satan, but by the mouthes and hands of the Iewes, then certainly Satan had no such inward and spirituall conflict with Christ, as you imagine; much lesse had Satan any power to possesse and torment the Soule of Christ, which is the thing you must proue, before your hell paines will be haled out of Christs triumph. [Defenc. pag. 81. li. 22. 
               These (powers of hell) also were set on worke by the Iustice and seuere wrath of God now purposety laying punishment on his Sonne, thereby to take Satisfaction for all our sinnes.] If you meane that God by his secret Counsell and Iustice losed the raines to Satan to shew his malice against Christ by the mouthes and hands of the wicked, as he doth in the afflictions of all his Saints, for purposes to him knowne and by him liked; I see not how this should any thing helpe your Cause: but if by this you would, that Satan was Gods Instrument inwardly to torment the Soule of Christ, or that the diuell had any speciall Commission to inuade the manhoode of Christ, otherwise then by the violent hands and virulent tongues of the Iewes; as it is most false, that you ashrme, so is it most wicked, that you intend.

We know the diuell can not touch any haire of our heads till he receaue power from God so to doe. This our discerning and acknowledging the hand of God in setting the wicked on worke, as you call it; in giuing them leaue to sift his Saints, as I say, and to exercise his graces in them, doth breede no such feare nor torment of conscience, as you talke of in Christ, so long as we are perswaded, that God loueth vs, and doth all things for the best, and that the sharpest triall in this life is the speediest way to his kingdome. If we that be sinfull, and fraile, subiected indeede to the iust remorse of our consciences, can yet apprehend and discerne the rage of Satan, and of the wicked, armed with power from aboue to make triall of our Faith and Patience, and not be dismayed nor tormented in mind, in any such sort as you speake of: what shall we thinke the Soule of Christ, full of grace, and of the holy Ghost, inseparably ioyned with his Godhead in one and the same person, could conceaue of these his sufferings, or Satans incensing the Iewes against him, but as the truth was, that he well liked, and God approoued and annointed him to be the Sauiour of the world, and the destroyer of Satans kingdome for this obedience and patience, which he should shew in admitting the Iewes to execute Satans furious rage against his Body? You would haue Christ to conceaue, that he was sinfull, defiled, hatefull and accursed of God, and in that respect God was become an Enemie to him, and had forsaken him; but these mysteries of iniquitie and Infidelitie were farre from that holy, vndefiled, and acceptable Sacrifice, which the vnspotted I amb of God did offer for the sinnes of the world. But why shrinke you, and shift you thus from pillar to post; and make sometimes the immediate hand of God

to be cause of Christs suffering in Soule, sometimes the working or conflicting of Satan with him, and sometimes Christs owne apprehension that the Iewes and the diuell were set on worke by the secret wrath of God; and all this while you doe not once endeuour you say, to expresse the manner of it? where in deede you doe nothing but waue to & fro, not knowing where to stand, or what to hold, but only to requoile to your accustomed couerts of Gods proper wrath and indignation against sinne, from which you thinke you may frame what fansies you will.

               else but the Lord laid vpon him the iniquitie of vs all. You shew your skill and vnderstanding in the Scriptures. To prooue that God with his immediate hand did afflict and torment the Soule of Christ, you note that God did appoint him to be the Sacrifice for sinne, and that Christ accordingly did offer vp his Soule, (or life) to be disposed at Gods pleasure. What is ment by sinne in those words of the Apostle, God made him sinns for vs, I haue largely shewed before; whence you may conclude, that God did appoint and approoue Christ to be the Lamb, that should take away the sinnes of the world, because he was vndefiled, and accepted of God as a most sufficient exchange or recompence for the sinnes of men: but torment from the immediate hand of God these words doe not touch, and therefore you might haue as well saued your Paper, as lost your paines. The next words, that Christ made his (owne) Soule, (or life) an offering for sinne, to what purpose you bring it I can not ghesse, except it be to let your Reader see, that you doe not vnderstand whereabout you goe. For how doth Christs giuing of his life for many, proue that his Soule was afflicted by the very hand of God? Had Gods immediate hand tormented his Soule, when he commended his Spirit into his Fathers hands, by your Doctrine he commended it not to rest, but to Torment. [This is nothing else, you say, but the Lord laid vpon him the iniquitie of vt all. Then none of these three Texts come any thing neere your intention, that God with his owne hand laid the punishment of our sinnes on Christ, since the last word, by which you expound the rest, inferreth no more, but that God caused or made our sinnes to come against him. In which words, as in all the rest implying any such thing, the Prophet meaneth; God was the Supreme Cause and Author of all Christs sufferings, which I no way deny; but not the immediate executioner with his owne hand, as you haue lately deuised, and now would prooue, if you could tell how.
            This Phrase in the Scriptures, that God DID these or these things, concludeth not that he did them with his immediate hand, but that he was the Decreer, director, and disposer of those things by his iust Iudgement to punish sinne, or by his wisdome to make triall of his Saints; God vsing for his Ministers and executioners, Men or

Angels, good or bad, as seemed best to his heauenly will and Counsell. Amos 3. 
               Is there any euill in the Citie, and the Lord hath not done it? saith Amos. Where he doth not ascribe all euill of punishment to the immediate hand of God, but to the Soueraigne Iudgement and power of God appointing and ordering what shall be done. Esa. 45. 
               I am the Lord, there is none other; making Peace, and creating euill. In both God had and hath his Instruments, though in both his will and power did and doth preuaile. When Dauid had sinned by killing Vriah, and taking his wife, God thus threatned him by Nathan the prophet. 2. Sam. 12. 
               I will raise vp euill against thee out of thine owne bouse, and will take thymiues before thine cies, and giue them to thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wiues in the sight of this Sunne. For thou didst it secretly: but I will doe this thing before all Israell and the Sunne. Shall we attribute Absolons vnnaturall rebellion against his father, and his most shameles incest to Gods immediate hand, and so make God the onely author of so horrible sinne, which is the heigth of all wickednesse? Or did God by his iust iudgement giue libertie to Satan to lead Absolon, that ambitious murderer of his eldest brother, by the wicked counsell of Achitophell to this impudent villanie? So when Iob sayth, The Lord hath giuen, and the Lord hath taken it; did he meane that God tooke it with his immediate hand? or that God by his righteous iudgement did enlarge the diuell, and those wicked robbers to make triall of him by the losse of his goods and children? Iob. 2. 
               Stretch out thine hand, and touch his bones and his flesh, said Satan to God, when he desired leaue to strike Iobs body. Whereupon Saint Austen sayth. August. ad Simplicianum. li. 2. Epist. 1. 
               Manum Domini appellabat permissam à Domino manum suam, id est, ipsam potestatem quam volebat accipere. The hand of the Lord (Satan) calleth his owne hand permitted by God, that is, the power and leaue which he would receaue. God himselfe thus speaketh of the Assyrians, that oppressed his people. Esa. 10. 
               O Ashur, the rod of my wrath; the staffe in their hands is mine indignation. God then vseth the wicked both men and Angels, to execute his iudgements, and exercise his seruants, though they haue no such knowledge or purpose; and their rage and deeds he calleth his anger and acts, because he giueth them power and leaue, without which they could not stirre to hurt any of his creatures, much lesse any of his seruants. Which Christ signified to Pilate, when he said; Iohn. 19. 
               Thou couldest haue no power at all against me, except it were giuen thee from aboue.

How beit to direct the Reader the safest way in this case; Neither you, nor I must intrude our deuices vpon the words of God, but what the Euangelists describe in Christs sufferings, that without Question the Prophets foresaw, and foretold in their Predictions. The words then of the Prophets must not inferre any new fansies of yours, nowhere confirmed in the Euangelists; but what the Gospell witnesseth Christ did suffer, that Esay foresaid Christ should susfer. The immediate hand of God tormenting the Soule of his Sonne, is no where testified in the Gospell: It was therefore no where foreshewed in the Prophets. But the true & accustomed translation may stand for good; the Lord would bruise him or humble him, and made him weake. And where you catch hold of the word khaphets, as if it were Gods owne action, because he tooke pleasure and delight

therein, besides that the word signifieth to be willing and content as well as to desire and delight, that part of your exposition refuteth the rest. For God taketh no pleasure in punishing, as the Prophet confesseth of him, Lament. 3. vers. 33.

For Psal. 116.

Let the simplest that is, heere iudge, whether the Apostles in this their praier acknowledge any thing done to Christ in his sufferings by Gods owne hand without all meanes, as you imagine; or whether they doe not expressely auouch, that both rulers and people of Iewes and Gentils were Gods meanes to doe that, which his hand and counsell had before determined to be done. So that Christ was not left to the will and power of his enemies, to doc with him what they would, but to doe that vnto him, which Gods wisdome determined, and hand guided to be done. Heere apparantly is the hand of God named and confessed, but mediate; that is, ordering and disposing the Iewes rage and violence according to Gods foresetled counsell. Wherein the goodnesse of your iudgement and cause appeareth, that when you should prooue any thing, you produce places that euidently impugne your purpose. With like discretion you cite that which followeth. For what if God condemned (that is, abolished) sinne in the flesh, (of which words I haue spoken enough before) doth that imply, that God punished Christes Soule or bodie with his immediate hand? Small store of proofes you haue for your vpstart doctrine of God tormenting Christes soule with his immediate hand, when you turne aside to texts, that no way mention any such matter, and prate in your pride, that the word of God is flat contrarie to me.

               Gods owne hand then did smite Christ, and inflicted on him whatsoeuer he suffered, as the condemnation of sinne. Well leapt; From Gods hand vsing the Iewes and Gentils as his meanes to doe to Christ whatsoeuer his counsell had determined, you step to Gods owne hand, excluding all meanes; directly against the profession of the Apostles, and the whole Church with them, and against the tenor of the new Testament, which sharpely rebuketh the rage and wickednesse of the Iewes, that put Christ to death. Were you not caried with the spirit of slumber and giddinesse, could you thus loosely conclude so weightie causes, not onely without, but against the Scriptures? [Ibid. li. 16. 
               The punishment ordained for sinne by the iustice of God, and inflicted by the hand of God (whatsoeuer meane it pleaseth him to vse) is called the wrath of God, as you acknowledge.] My words make as much for you, as the Apostles did euen now, when they expresly contradicted you; but such as your cause is, such is your conscience; you duck and diue, you care not where nor whether, so you may haue a generall Phrase to beare you aboue water, when you are out of breath. You set your selfe to prooue that God with his immediate hand afflicted the Soule of Christ; and when your proofes faile you, you catch vp my words auouching Conclus. pa. 245. li. 31.

hand? Or because all punishments great and small on vs, or on whomsoeuer, come from the Souera gne power & hand of God, therefore God vseth no meanes? Or what other absurd conceite would you collect out of my words? I speake not here of the Reprobate, I speake of all mankinde, though you leaue out my words (inflicted ON VS) of purpose to serue your owne sense. Neither do I say it is Gods eternall or spirituall wrath, but all afflictions imposed on vs for sinne, by what means soeuer, are in the Scriptures called the wrath of God, as I haue else where shewed, albeit they tend not to damnation, nor destruction. What is this to Gods immediate hand punishing the Soule of Christ? Or which way recall you this to the Conquest, that Christ had ouer Satan and all his power, wherewith you began?

For in these few words you presume more then you will prooue whiles you liue; to make God with his immediate hand to afflict the soule of Christ with the same paines, that the damned are tormented; and other reason for it you haue none, but because all power in heauen, earth, and hell is from God; and called the hand of God. By which the Scriptures doe not imply the immediate hand of God, but his power working by meanes appointed and established by him. In the Scriptures God is euery where proclaimed to be THE LORD OF HOSTES, and therefore as there is no power in Angels, Diuels, Men or other creatures, that cometh not from him, so they are not idle armies, nor lookers on, but are indued with power from God as well to protect, as to punish where, when, how, and whom they shal be appointed. Which the wisdome and power of God hath ordained and setled, not to shorten his arme nor to weaken his strength as needing assistants, but by constituting Seruants and Ministers vnder him, to let men and Angels, good and badde, continually behold how mightie and wise, righteous and glorious he is, that wanteth no meanes to execute his will, and yet directeth all things by his wisdome. Is not God able to preferre and keepe his Saints by his word or his will without aide of others? who doubteth it? And yet Psal. 91. 
               He giueth his Angels charge ouer thee, to keepe thee in all thy waies. And

                   hand. Where you would intimate, that Christ on the Crosse was not tempted by the powers of hell, because Christ could not be tempted by Satans inward suggestion, but only by the eare receiuing an outward voice; this I suppose also is a singular conceit of your owne, without any title of Scripture to proue it by. I can not call your conceits singular, they are so void of all reason and iudgement; priuate they are to your selfe, and depriued of all trueth, and testimonie either of Scripture, saue such as you most ignorantly abuse, or of the Church of Christ before you, which you regard not, as drowned in the depth of your selfe-pleasing paradoxes.

Whether I haue grounds of Scripture, and the consent of Christs Church, for that which I defend in this and other points refused by your curious conceitfull head, the Reader shall see before we depart. But in the meane while you forget, Sir Defensor, that you should proue this to be the Apostles meaning in those words produced by you, Christ spoiled powers and principalities, which you neuer offer to doe. You denie that I affirme, and without any farther processe you presume your fansie to be the Apostles sense; which is your common course throughout your writings. Could you desorce mine exceptions, as you can not, that maketh not your exposition the truer, nor your argument the stronger, till you haue iustly proued this, which you pretend to be the Apostles purpose.
            
               Defenc. pag. 83. li. 4. 
               What reason can you giue, that where the minde conceiueth any temptation, there of necessitie must be concupiscence, and corruption of the flesh? &c. In vs men it is so you say; I grant it is so: but that of necessitie in nature it must be so, I see no reason in the world.] The conceiuing & discerning of a tentation is not the point we speake of, but the profering and suggesting it; and why that can not inwardly be done by the minde of man without corruption of sinne, the reason is euident in the Scriptures. For a tentation to sinne is not a cogitation or imagination, but a prouocation and motion to sinne, which is sinfull in the Tempter, since it is no lesse euill di ectly and purposely to prouoke to sinne, then to consent or commit sinne. For which cause the Scriptures ascribe that office namely to the diuell, to be the Tempter vnto euill; and S. IamesActs 5. v 3. Matth 
                     •…

               tempteth he any man (to euill) sayth Iames; thereby teaching vs, that he must first be tempted, or filled with euill, that tempteth and leadeth another thereto. Since then Man in his first Creation was made after the Image of God, that was very good, and void of all euill; though he might be outwardly tempted, because he was mutable, yet could 
                  •…
               e not inwardly be tempted by his owne heart, because he was innocent: for that which was right and good, as euery part within man was, could not perswade or prouoke man to euill, but like must leade the like. And this is the reason of that generall rule in Saint Iames touching inward tentation, where he saith: Euery one is tempted, when he is drawen and enticed by his owne concupiscence. The Apostle speaketh not this of outward tentations, but of inward; sending men to the corruption of their owne hearts and lusts, by which Satan secretly prouoketh them to sinne, without externall speech and presence, which all the godly would soone detest and abhorre; but baiting them with their owne desires and delights by meanes of that concupiscence which naturally dwelleth in them, and not onely serueth the diuell as an instrument to farther his wicked suggestions, but of it selfe lusteth after euill, and striueth against the Spirit of grace. If this were not in Adam before his fall, then could the diuell worke in him by no inward motion of infidelitie or iniquitie, since the parts and powers of the soule that should suggest either, must be infected and inclined to either, before they could prouoke and allure the rest to consent. Howbeit, the question is of Christ, whether he could inwardly be tempted to euill by the cogitations or thoughts of his owne heart, though neither consent, nor act did follow; and herein I thinke you will shew your selfe to haue a fountaine of folly, if not worse, springing out of that vnquiet braine of yours.

               I suppose you haue no reason to affirme (as you doe) that Christ in the wildernesse was tempted by Satan by outward voice only.] The discreet Reader, when he hath well considered your vanities in this place, will the lesse woonder at, and the sooner discouer your nouelties in other things. Haue I no reason to affirme, that Christ was tempted in the wildernesse by the outward voice of Satan, when the Scriptures directly record the words and deeds of the Diuell to Christ, as also Satans presence before him, and departure from him? Doth not the Scripture expresly say, that the diuell tooke him Matth. 4. vp into the holy citie, and set him on the pinnacle of the Temple: and againe tooke him into a very high hill, and shewed him all the kingdomes of the world, and the glory thereof? Are

not the diuels words to Christ in three seuerall temptations likewise set downe by the Euangelists, Luke and Matthew, whereby he tempted Christ; first to make (the) stones, (that lay in sight) bread; then to cast himselfe from the pinuacle of the Temple; and lastly, to fall downe before the diuell, and to worship him? [It was a temptation, you will say.] The words and deeds of Satan were, So sayth the Scripture; but not that Christ imagined these things, or that the diuell mooued Christes heart thus to thinke. It is a narration of things done and spoken, not a vision or cogitation what might be profered by Satans suggestion; the Diuell sayd to Christ, Luke 4. 
               If thou wilt bow thy knee

               Matth. 4. 
               It is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him alone shalt thou serue. And so the Diuell left him, and loe, the angels came, and ministred vnto him. Why may not the rest of the Histories in the Gospell be thoughts and imaginations aswell as this, since they haue no plainer words nor deeds then this?
            
               Defenc. pag. 83. li. 13. 
               It seemeth rather to be manifest, that (Christs) temptation was meerely in cogitation, and in the thoughts of his heart, so mooued by the spirituall suggestion of the diuell.] Besides your manifest gaine-saying the wordes of the Euangelists, that the diuell did and spake thus to Christ, as the Gospell reporteth, and carried him to the temple, and to the mountaine; you make the thoughts and cogitations of Christes heart to be inwardly mooued with Infidelitie, presumption, idolatrie and blasphemie. For such in effect were the perswasions, that Satan profered Christ by word of mouth; which if you thinke Christs heart suggested to himselfe in Satans steed, and by Satans meanes, then bring you worse then corruption into the soule of Christ. For a Prou. 24. 
               foolish thought as sinne, saith Salomon; and 
               Prou. 5. 
               an euili thought is an abomination to the Lord. What then are perfidious, presumptuous, mendacious, and blasphemous thoughts, I saie thoughts suggesting and perswading these hainous sinnes, though consent or act doe not follow? and yet if you looke well to them, you shall see false and wicked asseuerations in Satans words, which if any mans heart suggest vnto him in the same forme, that Satan vttered them, he is guilty of the same impietie with Satan. To shew his pride and vaunt his power, Satan sayd; Luke 4. 
               all (the authority and glory of earthly kingdomes) is committed to me, and I giue it to whom I will. If any mans heart or thought do but say, or suggest the same to it selfe after Satan, doeth not his heart affirme a lie to Gods great dishonour, as Satans mouth did? You therefore and your hobler, that would raine helpe you out of this quake mire, by setting his censure in the margine, may do well to beware of maintaining such spirituall cogitations in Christ as proceeded from the diuels mouth by the witnesse of holy Scripture, and are meet for none but for him and his members: and to tread rather in the plaine path of the Holy Ghost, that Satans voice vttered those blasphemies, which Christes heart so detested, that he could no longer endure the diuels speech, when he brake out to such open impietie, that he put himselfe in Gods stead, but commanded him away.
            And when you next suffer any man to reuise your doings, intreat him not to crosse you and himselfe so fondly as this Corrector doth. For where you say it is manifest, that Christes temptation was meerely (that is onely) in cogitation, your owne ouerseer controleth that as an error, and sayth, Defenc. pag. 83. ad margin h. 15. OR ELS by some such outward obiects, which might worke that spirituall cogitation in Christ, as Satan might well know how. What these meanes were or might be, this Huckster knoweth no more then you doe, but it sufficeth some of your sort neuer to holde their tongues nor pennes, though they know not what you say or write. Outward obiects to worke any such cogitation in Christ, must be by the eare or by the eye. The eare in Christ you denie to haue beene the instrument that receiued this temptation; though the Scripture by plaine consequent auouch so much. What obiect of the eye could leade Christ to thinke, that Satan was the Disposer of earthly power and glorie; and that the Diuell would affoord him all, if he would bow his knee in the diuels presence to acknowledge the giuer,

can you tell? In vs, since the soule was weakened, corrupted, and diuided against it selfe by sinne, the diuell can (when he is permitted so to doe) stirre the imaginations of men either sleeping or waking, and moue their affections; otherwise he can impresse no cogitation in the soule, but must proferre the suggestion by some speech of his owne or others. In Christ he could do nothing, farther than Christ was willing to permit; the words of our Sauiour are very plaine: Iohn 14. 
               The Prince of this world commeth, but in me he hath nothing, that is, no power, place, nor worke. So much the diuels themselues confessed. Luke. 4. 
               What haue we to doe with thee, thou Iesus of Nazaret? And since he was stronger than the diuell, and tooke his armour from him, and bound him, and cast him out of others, neither could he so much as enter hogges without Christes leaue, how was it possible the diuell should worke any cogitation in Christ, but what Christ was willing he should? Now, will, that Satan should impresse these impious cogitations in his heart, Christ had none, nor could haue any; since with disdaine he put the diuell to silence vpon the hearing of that blasphemous and idolatrous suggestion. Wherefore it is euident, that these things were spoken and done by Satan, euen as the Scriptures describe them; and we may not for our pleasures make them imaginations, not actions; cogitations, not speeches.

Saint Marke, whom you would oppose to the rest, omitting the particular circumstances of Christs temptation, saith in generall words, that Christ was in the Wildernesse fortie daies, (& was) tempted of Satan. Hence you would infer, that after these forty daies Christ was not tempted; but which way? can you tell? The Euangelist, whose words you pretend, deuideth these two, which you ioyne together, as the point betweene them in all our Greeke Copies doth cleerely conuince. And were they not diuided, thence perhaps you might prooue, that during the time of fortie daies he was in some sort tempted, but that he was not tempted after the end of fortie daies, those words doe no way imply.

So that apparantly Christ fasted fortie dayes eating nothing, and at the end thereof began to be hungrie; which occasion the diuell tooke first to tempt him openly, and so spight of your cauilling conceits, Christ was tempted after the end of fortie dayes, whatsoeuer he was before. Now those words in Saint Lukes text, (Fortie dayes tempted of the Diuell) Eusebius and Cyrill, two ancient Greeke Fathers,o Cyril. de recta fide ad Regin

whether we say, that Christ abode those fortie dayes in the Wildernesse, or he was tempted those fortie daies in the Wildernesse, since it is plaine, that Saint Luke speaketh of other Temptations during those fortie daies, then those three, which himselfe and Mathew exactly note, begun after the end of those forty daies. Euthymius obserueth, that Marke and Luke doe say,  Euthymius in 4.  ca. Matth.

                doth not enforce such an insensible time as you pretend; though the diuell tooke no long time to shew those things, and Christ tooke lesse to beholde them; for he knew better then the diuell did, the vanitie of that worldly glory which Satan so much magnified; and since for our saluation Christ had layed aside the brightnesse of his diuine Maiestie, during the time of his humilitie; I verily thinke he would not vouchsafe all earthly pompe any longer view then the turning of an eye to it, and from it; not that he doubted any temptation in it, but that he despised it as not worthy of his sight, who was Lord of all heauenly power.

            Satan also might shew, and Christ might see the places themselues, and the pompe thereof: for Satan being an Angell, had another maner of sight, euen in the bodie which he assumed, then we haue: and Christ, when pleased him, could see whither, and what he would. That the Angels of God heare and see the particular words and actions of all men here on earth, S. Paul is a witnesse, where he sayth: 1. Tim. 5.

               The woman ought to haue power on her head, because of the Angels; that is, she ought to couer her head in signe of subiection to the power of the man, because the Angels beholde this, as all other actions of men, either in the Church or in the world. From this power to heare and see what is sayd and done on the face of the earth, euen in the secret and darke places thereof, the diuell is not excluded, in that he is an Angel, though fallen from heauen, and cast vnto the earth, yet an Reuel. 12.

And what maruell, that Angels, who by their creation excell (vs) in power and might haue this incident to their condition, when as men, God opening their eyes, can see things done in heauen and earth, which naturally they can by no meanes see? When Dothan was besieged by the Aramites to apprehend Elizeus, and his seruant was afrayd at the sight of them, the Prophet encouraging his seruant, sayd: 2. Kings 5. 
               Feare not, for they that be with vs, are moe then they that be with them: and prayed God to open his seruants eyes, which the Lord did; and 2. Kings 5.

                  ierie charets and horses, round about Elizeus. 
               Mark. 1. 
               Assoone as Iohn was come out of the water, where he baptized Iesus in Iordan, Iohn saw the heauens cleaue asunder, and the Holy Ghost descending on (Christ) like a Doue. Steuen likewise not only had his face changed in the Councell, Acts 7. 
               as the face of an Angell, but looking stedfastly into heauen, saw the glory of God, and Iesus standing at the right hand of God. Which though the incredulous Iewes did no wayes beleeue, but stopped their eares when they heard him so say, and ranne vpon him all at once, and cast him out of the citie, and stoned him as a blasphemous liar, yet can he be no Christian,Christ might see what he would. that doubteth whether Steuen saw this with his bodily eyes or no; the Scripture being so resolute for it, how impossible soeuer it be to our eyes. This power to beholde things farre distant, notwithstanding all impediments interiected, not onely Christ had when he would, as appeareth by his words to Nathaniel; Ioh. 1. v. 48. 
               Before Philip called thee, being vnder the figge tree I saw thee (for which Nathaniel acknowledged him to be the Sonne of God;) but he promised his, that they should see greater things. Vers. 50. 
               Because I sayd to thee, I saw thee vnder the figge tree, beleeuest thou? Thou shalt see greater things then these. 
               Vers. 51. 
               Verily, verily, I say vnto you, henceforth you shall see the heauens open, and the Angels of God ascending and descending vpon the Sonne of man. Since then Christ could and Luke 10. vers. 18. 
               did see Satan, like lightning, fall downe from heauen; I make no doubt, but he could open his owne eyes to see the remote parts of the earth, when it pleased him, though vsually he did it not, by reason he needed it not: for he knew all things, and euen what was in man, which the Angels doe not; and therefore needed not any such vse of his eyes, but when he saw his time; which in this case he might like, lest the d
                  •…
               uell should despise him, as hauing greater power and cleerer sight then Christ did or could shew himselfe to haue. For which cause also Christ would stand on the pinnacle of the Temple without the diuels helpe, to let him know, that he wanted not power to doe greater things then the diuell vrged him vnto; but onely that hee would take his owne time, and do nothing at the diuels instigation or motion, nor repugnant to the will and pleasure of God.
            A third way the diuell had, if Christ would permit it, to set these things before our Sauiours eyes. Satan is able not onely to assume, what shapes he will, and to transforme himselfe into an Angell of light, but also to make specters and shewes of any thing in the aire, and to deceiue the eyes of men, when he is suffered by God so to do: which not onely experience of all ages, but the Scriptures themselues confirme; wherein all 2. Thess. 2. 
               false woonders and signes are ascribed to the operation of Satan. By this meanes Simon the Sorcerer so bewitched the whole citie of Samaria, that Acts 8. 
               they all from the least to the greatest gaue heed vnto him, and sayd; This man is the great power of God. The Sorcerers of Pharaoh Exod 7.

               Exod. 8. 
               frogs vpon the land of Egypt, as Moses and Aaron did; and other miracles could the diuell haue done, as we see by killing of Iobs Iob. 1. 
               sheepe and seruants with fire from heauen, and the 
               Iob. 2. 
               smiting of Iobs bodie with sore boiles, had not the

hand of the Almightie stopped him, and thereby made the Sorcerers confesse, that Exod. 8. v 19 
               there was the finger of God. It was therefore no hard thing for Satan to frame the appearances of kingdomes and cities, and shew the similitudes of them from euery part of the earth, since they are but the figures and semblances of things that we see with our eyes, which Angels good and badde haue in their power, when they are sent of God to do his will. Howbeit, Satan could not delude the eyes of Christ without his knowledge and leaue, though Satan did not so thinke. And therefore all these wayes being possible, yet I thinke the second most agreeable to the words, and see no cause why we should measure Christs sight, (when pleased him) by mans reason, when as he did so many things heere on earth aboue all humane power and reason. For he often 
               Marke 4. 
               walked on the sea; and 
               Iohn 20. 
               came, and stood in the midst of his disciples, when the doores were shut; and made the ship that receiued him in the sea of Tiberias, Iohn 6. 
               to be by and by at the land, whither they went; besides many thousand miracles, which he wrought with his word and hand, whiles he conuersed amongst men. Of which, if no Christian may make any question, why flie you to imaginations or visions, so long as Christ had power enough with his eyes to behold whatsoeuer Satan could shew him.
            It was Satans act, you will say, to shew them, and not Christes. Satan as an angell might see them, and shew them; and Christ must either confesse, that he could not see so farre, which would argue him to be feebler and weaker in power then the Tempter, and so not the Sonne of God; or els be pleased to see whatsoeuer Satan could shew, which was easier for him to see, that was God and man, then for Satan to shew, that was but a reprobate angell, and could doe nothing, sauing what was permitted. Whatsoeuer the meanes were, by which Christ did see that which was shewedHistories are not Visions. him, it is euident, that the Scripture directeth vs to a sensible view taken of earthly things and places, and not to a vision, much lesse to a cogitation. For to what end was Christ caried to an exceeding high mountaine, if he did behold those things but in thought, and by a vision? Cogitations and visions need no hilles, and therefore that circumstance expressed by the Euangelists, refuteth your dreame of spirituall cogitations. And so doth the danger, whereto Satan perswaded our Sauiour to put himselfe, by falling from the pinnacle of the Temple, to see whether the Angels would beare him vp from dashing his foot against a stone. What danger of dashing his feet against the stones could there be in a cogitation without an action? And as for visions, besides that the Scriptures vse to distinguish dreames and visions from histories and actions, what visions could the diuell shew Christ, except they were delusions? And that Christ would suffer him to delude his spirit, is far more incredible, than that he would be content to see what Satan could shew. But though the maner may be darke vnto vs, yet is the matter euident, that Satan with the shew of earthly glory would haue allured Christ to accept the kingdome of the earth at his hands. Now the eyes were the greatest prouocations that Satan could vse in that case, since all Christes cogitations were righteous and holy, despising all carthly honour and pompe, as vaine and transitorie; and if the eye could not be affected therewith, the minde of Christ was farther from embracing it.

               I must needs thinke, that as Satan was a subtile spirit, so he could and did sometime spiritually suggest temptations into Christes heart, and yet vtterly without all sinne: which we at no hand can doe, because we are all naturally apt and inclining to euill, as Christ was not.]Satan could impresse no euill in Christs heart. And I must needs thinke, that you neither vnderstand what a temptation is, nor what detestation of sin was in the Soule of Christ, that you make him willingly subiect his heart to the motions and suggestions of Satan vnto euill. For a thinking vpon euill to detest it or disswade it, was common to Christes humane soule with the best saints of God, and euen with the elect Angels, and was the worke of Gods spirit; but an inward temptation to euill, that is, a persuasion or motion of the heart to sinne, Christ needed not admit without his owne consent, (since the Prince of this Iohn 14. 
               world had nothing in him) and could not giue way to any such prouocation without corruption of sinne. In that you attribute more to Satans subtiltie, than to Christes power and integritie,

being both God and man, and in his humane soule endued with the fulnesse of the Holy Ghost, you shew your selfe a good Proctor for the Diuell, that giue him abilitie to inuade the soule of Christ, and to impresse in him most sinfull and wicked cogitations, which you call spirituall, because they proceeded from the spirit of error and infidelitie; not remembring, or not beleeuing that Christ was Lord ouer Satan, and displaced him from such as he formerly possessed, and preserued his Disciples as well from the subtiltie as furie of Satan, that in the end they might tread him vnder their feet. If then Christ could, and did 1. Iohn 3.

against sinne. Howbeit you leaue my wordes and make consequents of them full like your owne, that is, without toppe or taile, when you come to oppose my speeches one against the other. For where tentation in the Scriptures is sometimes taken for persecution and affliction, sometimes for perswasion and allurement to euill, and sometimes for probation or triall, what a man will doe; you take hold of the ambiguitie of the word, and where one place speaketh of perswasion to euill, the other of affliction, you iumble them together, and make the one repugnant to the other. Now though afflictions may be called temptations, yet all temptations are not afflictions, nor effects of Gods wrath: otherwise Adam could neuer haue bin tempted in Paradise before sinne; and friendship, fauor, and flatterie do more often and more properly tempt or prouoke, then affliction, which doth more violently prooue the obedience and patience, that is in men. What temptation might well be ment in this place, appeareth by the word of torment opposed to it, when I said the diuell doth either tempt, or torment: where temptation, if you will needes take the words themselues, must note that which is no torment, and consequently be taken for perswasion by faire and friendly words or meanes, by which the diuell tempteth as dangerously, as by force and violence. And so neither way you hit the trueth, nor can conclude any contrarietie in me, though indeed I spake those words out of your sense of Gods wrath, which is pregnant enough against you, knowing that in your reason, which I refute, you made the diuels to be the verie instruments of Gods proper and spirituall wrath against the soule of Christ.

Saint Iames telleth you, that Iam. 1. v. 14. 
               euerie man is tempted, when he is drawen away, and intised by his owne concupiscence, which of it selfe naturally lusteth against the spirit, and much more when it is inflamed by Satans suggestions and motions. This kinde of temptation riseth from the corruption of our sinnefull nature, and is the poison of sinne dwelling in vs, the verie motion whereof is forbidden by the law of God, Thou shalt not lust; though it be pardoned in the elect for Christes sake, as all their sinnes are. Outward temptations haue no such necessary condition. It is no sinne to be tempted externally; otherwise Adam had sinne before his fall, and Christ himselfe was subiect to sinne, for they both were outwardly tempted, though not inwardly, as I teach, and the Church of Christ before me taught the same, howsoeuer you take a pride in departing from the full conse

For the diuels themselues confessed, they had nothing to doe with Christ; and you make them the raisers of strange temptations in Christes heart, and inflictors of incomprehensible sorrowes on Christes soule.

               Christ felt and discerned by that meanes the verie stroke of Gods owne hand vpon him, and receiued the sting of his wrath and indignation therein, which then wrought and was reuealed chiefly then vpon him for all our sinnes.] Meane you that Christ felt the stroke of

Gods owne hand by the temptations, or by the torments which Satan offered to his soule? If by temptations; besides that you giue S. Iames the lie, who sayth, Iames 1. 
               God tempteth no man (with euill,) you make God with his owne hand to moue and prouoke Christ to wickednesse, which is more then infernall wickednesse to auouch, If you meane by torments; those you teach must come from the immediate hand of God vpon the soule of Christ; and will you make the diuell to be Gods immediate hand? Choose here, whether all your graue discourse (at your first entrance into this question) of the soules proper and immediate suffering shall be wholy idle, and vtterly false, or whether the diuell shall be Gods immediate hand. Gods immediate hand is his eternall, diuine, and almighty power, which if you admit the diuell to be; I must confesse all my speculations, beleeuing but one God, and him to be most pure and holy, are plaine and grosse in respect of your new found hell, and your eternall and almighty Ruler thereof, the diuell. As for proofe, I should wrong you to aske for any; it is not your maner to vouchsafe to proue what you say; but to say what you list vnder certaine generall stales of words; which are but dennes of theeues to rob Christ of his sanctitie and glorie. What Christ discerned in his sufferings, is neuer like to come from you with any trueth, you follow your fansies so much as your best guides; which leade you to a sidelesse and bottomlesse pit of absurd dreames and doctrines. You distinguish nothing, you define nothing, you proue nothing; onely you wallow in the mire of strange temptations, and most dolefull and incomprehensible sorrowes; how, why, or what, you can not tell, but the hand of God serueth you at all assayes to bring out your misborne and misshapen speculations vnder some shew of religion, because you pretend the power of God. For my part, what the Scriptures euidently auouch of Christes sufferings, that I faithfully beleeue; what is deuised or added by mens imaginations and fictions, I vtterly reiect not as false and presumptuous only, but as absurd and irreligious.
            What the Scriptures say Christ discerned in his sufferings, I haue often specified, which farre differeth from your strange and imaginary speculations. They auouch of Christ, that he Acts 2. 
               saw God alwaies at his right hand, that he should not be shaken; and therfore his heart was glad, and his tongue reioyced. And 
               Heb. 12. 
               for the ioy proposed vnto him, (and therefore discerned by him) he endured the crosse and despised the shame thereof. Christ himselfe after his last supper, Ioh. 18. 
               knowing all things that should befall him, and that Ioh. 13. 
               his houre was come, that he should depart out of this world vnto the Father, and that the Father had giuen all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God; not onely pronounced the diuel, for all his comming against him, Ioh 14. 
               had nothing in him, but speaking directly of his passion, said; Ioh. 17. 
               Father the houre is come, glorifie thy sonne, that thy sonne may glorifie thee; as thou hast giuen him power ouer all flesh, that hee might giue them life euerlasting. I haue glorified thee on earth, and now Father glorifie me with thy selfe, with the glorie which I had with thee before the world was. With this most assured and infallible perswasion and resolution Christ passed to his passion to be glorified, and thereby declared to be the Sonne of God. Which the Theefe on the crosse confessing, receaued that present day an euerlasting reward in Paradise; And the Centurion and Souldiers, that watched him, when they saw the manner of his death and woonders consequent, acknowledged, saying; Matth. 27. 
               Truely this man was the Sonne of God. Against this foundation of faith and knowledge in the soule and spirit of Christ, if you dreame of any doubt or feare, that did arise in the heart of Christ vpon any suggestions of men or diuels, you make him a liar and a sinner. His faith could not shrinke without hainous infidelitie, because he was assured of his personall vnion with God, and of his inunction with power and the holie Ghost from God, by the voice of his Father speaking thrice from heauen vnto him, by the visible descent of the holie Ghost vpon him at his baptisme, by the seruice and adoration of Angels, by the power and commaund, which he had ouerall creatures, and ouer diuels themselues. Wherefore the least doubt or distrust in Christs heart, that his person might perish, or

his sacrifice be reiected, or that his Father was or could be displeased with him, must needs haue beene most detestable impietie. And this cleerenesse of faith and knowledge standing fast, and immooueable against all the powers of hell, what strange temptations or incomprehensible torments could the diuell worke in the soule of Christ, the Scriptures assuring vs, that the

               we reioice, (and ought so to doe) in that we be partakers of Christs sufferings; so Christ in all his sufferings had exceeding both comfort and ioy, though the anguish of his flesh were very painfull vnto him, whereto the manhood of Christ did ful mit it selfe, according to the will of God.

Their tentations the Scriptures doe specifie, which were sufficient to trie the stedfastnesse of Christs faith and hope; of others they make no mention. And to these, or any other if you thinke Christs heart did yeeld but by fearing or doubting, whether their words were true or no, you take from him all assurance of faith, and place him in the midst betweene fidelitie and infidelitle, hope and despaire, as not resolued whether God would deceaue him, and forsake him vnder the burden of our sinnes, and his sufferings. This perplexitie would indeed haue beene a strange temptation, and horrible torment of minde, but withall a manifest faile in faith, and ecclipse of hope, which if you take from Christ, you robbe him not onely of his comfort, confidence, and glorie; but euen of all pietie, patience, and obedience for that time, as doubting whether God were faithfull in his promise, and whether the coniunction of God and man in his person might be seuered and dissolued or no. But of these temptations, feares, and sorrowes, I wish you to take heede, least if you defile the merits, or diminish the graces of his sufferings, you declare your

selfe to be any thing rather then a Christian, and to haue no part in the kingdome of God, and of Christ, by dishonoring the Father, and the Sonne to serue your owne fansies.

As though I must be bound to make Commentaries vpon all the Scriptures, which you abuse, or else you will take the trueth tardie by my default. It sufficed good Sir, that your application had neither coherence with the Apostles words, nor deriuance from them; and so was woorthely reiected as voide of all reason and sense. For this, that Christs soule was inwardly tempted, and tormented by diuels, because he triumphed ouer them most gloriously, this, I say, to all wise men is rather a meriement or a prattlement, then an argument. That they resisted, or inuaded, might happely be collected, not from the force of those words, but from the disposition of such enemies: yet which way they inuaded, or how farre they preuailed, can no way be thence coniectured, though it be strongly by you conceited. The Apostles words as I haue shewed, may either declare the glory of Christes resurrection, wherein all knees of things in heauen, earth, and hell did bow, and stoupe vnto him rising from the dead; or, as some apply them, expresse the power and glorie of his Passion, in which by the perfection of his innocence, patience, and obedience, he spoyled sinne and Satan of al their right and force ouer his Elect, and caried all his Enemies as Captiues in an open shew before God and his Angels, notwithstanding all the instance, or resistance they could make. From either of these senses how you can inferre, that Satan tormented the Soule of Christ, or that he impressed in Christs hart spirituall wicked cogitations or motions, I verily doe not see, except you haue a Patent to make Conclusions contrary to their Premisses.

So that what the godly doe sometimes feele (for not onely Children and Infants, but many thousand Christians die free from these hellish sorrowes of yours) may not be made a President for Christs sufferings.

               which though all generally feele not, yet generally is due to all in respect of sinne; you multiply your absurdities, you mend not the loosenesse of this Proposition. For due to all in respect of sinne, are all manner of externall and corporall plagues, from many of which your selfe would exempt Christ by this obseruation of yours; and likewise reiection, confusion, desperation, and eternall damnation are due to all in respect of sinne, from which if you doe not exempt Christ, you exempt your selfe out of the number of the Faithfull to take a worse course then Iudas, who yeelded his Masters Body into the hands of men, where this conceit yeeldeth Christs Soule into the power of diuels.
            Secondly, be you now of the minde that the Godly doe sometimes feele a Tast of Gods wrath? How often haue you resolued, and Proclaimed in this Booke, thatDefenc. pa. 13. li 8. 
               to the Godly their afflictions, both small and great, are no effects of Gods proper wrath, and now they sometimes feele a Tast of his Infinite wrath? What shift to saue this repugnancie, can you deuise? [Gods Infinite wrath perhaps is not his proper wrath.] It is the same, you say, that Christ suffered, and since Christ by your Doctrine suffered none but the proper wrath of God, the Faithfull feeling the same, that Christ did, must suffer the same kind of wrath, that Christ suffered. Againe, can you find vs an Infinite wrath in God, that is not properly wrath? What hath Gods proper wrath, of which you haue iangled so much, more then Infinite in time, or degree, or both? but these Resolutions of yours be like your Inuentions, they hang together, as drunken mens steps, or mad mens dreames. Consult I pray you with your friends, and aske them what answere you shall yeelde to this forgetfulnesse of theirs, or variablenesse of yours.

If you so thinke, you new stampe vs a strange, but an easie hell, in respect of those terrible iudgements, which God hath ordeined for the wicked in the world to come. Will you flie to your metaphors, and say that hell paines are taken for great and exceeding? Then play you with figures and phrases, as your fashion is, and come nothing neere to the substance of the cause. So that the one is a sensible vntrueth, the other is a shifting trifle brought in to lengthen the tale, when matter faileth.

            My next proposition, which you left vntouched, is, thatDefenc. pag. 85. li. 28. 
               Christ our Redeemer suffered for vs as deeply, yea deeper then any of vs here do suffer, or can suffer.] This proposition no way helpeth your intent, and besides, wanteth both parts and proofs: for if the whole were granted, as you offer it, you can neuer thence conclude, that Christ

suffered the true paines of the damned, till first you shew, that all the faithfull in this life do likewise suffer the true paines of the damned, which were a monstrous miscreance meet for your new made hell. Such desperate and reprobate assertions, as haue no touch of proofe, nor taste of trueth, you place in the foreward of your fanseries. [But Christ you say, suffered as deepely as euer any of vs heere doth, or can suffer.] Then did Christ by your doctrine not only doubt, and distrust, but euen despaire his owne saluation: for so haue many done, that after were recouered and restored by grace; and so you wrappe the Sonne of God not onely within the guilt, but within the verie sincke of our sinnes inherent, now not in the temptation, but in the perswasion of the heart: for therewith haue many of the Elect beene grieuously afflicted for the time. This it is for a man of your vnderstanding, to wade in waters aboue your heigth, and to finde no bottome till you come to the depth of all impietie, which you do not intend, but can not auoid by the consequence of your positions. Two lines and lesse in my Conclusion, euen where you complaine for want of answer, would haue eased you of all these frantike imaginations, had you but soberly considered them, or aduisedly sought to disproue them.

               O thou of little faith, why didst thou doubt? and to all the rest;Matth. 8. 
               Why are you fearefull, ô you of little faith? So that faith is a full and constant perswasion of Gods promises without all feare or doubt, that we may be deceiued or defrauded. Then must there in Christ be either no doubting, or small faith. And if vnbeliefe in vs be sinne, what was it in Christ after so many and so cleere euidences of Gods owne voice and oath vnto him?Psal. 89. 
               I haue sworne to Dauid my seruant, Thy seed will I stablish for euer. And againe; I haue sworne once by mine holinesse, I will not faile Dauid, his seed shall endure for euer. And likewise;Psal. 110. 
               The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou art a Priest for euer after the order of Melchisedech. After these oathes, promises, and speeches of God from heauen to the manhood of Christ, all doubting and distrusting is most hainous and horrible sinne; which, if any man attribute to Christ, he is worse then a Iew or a Turke. For they know him not; we doe know him to be the Sonne of God, and Trueth it selfe.
            Set this downe for an infallible rule in Christian religion, as indeed it is the foundation of all our saith (for if Christ might be a liar and a sinner, we are but deceiued in trusting to him) and none of these inward torments or deepe sufferings which you desperately dreame of, can be fast

               ed on Christ. So long as Christes heart and spirit stood fixed and immoued in the graces and promises of God, no such strange doubt or feare, temptation or torment, as you talke of, could afflict him. No force of Satan, no sting of sinne, no storme of wrath could confound him, or amaze him. In vs these things are possible, because the corruption of flesh, and want of grace often pinch vs with remorse of conscience, and remembrance of sinne committed; but in Christ there could be no such thing. And all your drifts to make him like vs in our sinfull affections, and conflicts with confusion and desperation, as they haue no ground in the Scriptures, so are they weake and wicked, in that you measure the fulnesse of Christes graces, and his freedome from all sinne, by the faithlesse and fearefull assaults, that sinne and Satan make on the corrupt and irregenerate parts and powers of our soules. Wherefore as I first resolued, so I now reiterate by reason of your importunitie, that1 Iohn 4.

which must be farre from Christ? Is Infidelitie, and distrust no sinne with you, that you make it common to Christ with vs? or are doubting and fearing no parts of infidelity? or what feare or doubt of his saluation could incomprehensibly torment the soule of Christ, except his heart did first encline from faith to feare, and so apprehend the griefe of Gods fauour lost, or in imminent danger to be lost?
            You haue giuen vs three variations of this incomprehensible and infinite paine and griefe, which should torment the soule of Christ, and yet you know not where to rest. The first was vnspeakeable smart and paine from Gods immediate hand, inflictingWhat torments the Defen

                  sed for Christes soule. the same anguish on the soule of his Sonne, that he doth on the damned spirits. For this you haue neither script nor scrole, text nor title in the word of God; it is a bold and lewd deuice of yours presuming what you please of Gods hand, because it is diuersly taken in the Scriptures. From thence you lept to diuels, and made them Gods instruments to torment the soule of Christ with strange temptations, and incomprehensible sorrowes suggested into the soule of Christ. Then you made Christs owne heart conceaue, and discerne from the wordes and acts of the Iewes fired and enraged by Satan, the dreadfull and painfull strokes and stings of Gods anger, and iust indignation against him for our sinnes; and yet all these are but the tumultuous dreames of your owne head, and certaine wastefull words that may be drawen to diuers senses, besides which you haue neither expressed nor confirmed any thing. Now you begin to make Commentaries vpon the Apostle to the Hebrewes, which are as cleere as a coale, and as sound as a satchell of saw-dust.
            
               Defenc. pag. 86. li. 10. 
               First, en ho, in that which himselfe suffered, signifieth either the 
               Defenc. pag. 86. li. 10. 
               matter wherein Christ is able to succour vs, or the

               meanes whereby he becommeth readie and fit to succour vs, or els the occasion and 
               Defenc. pag. 86. li. 10. 
               reason, why he is the readier to succour vs, euen in that he himselfe suffered and was tempted.] Your expositions be like your conclusions, they haue neither root nor rinde. Here are in shew three parts of a diuision, all which indeed (you say) are Defenc. pag. 86. li. 31. 
               but one and the same in effect, and so your triple diuision senselesse and needlesse, the parts importing one thing; and the Li. 27. 
               first way seemeth to you not the vnlikeliest; which, if you put any difference between them, is the falsest & farthest from the Apostles meaning. For that Christ helpeth men in nothing, but what himselfe first suffered, that he suffred al particular degrees, & speciall sorts of afflictions, as well in soule as in bodie, which may befall any man; these are so lowd lies, that but you, no man would make either of them the apostles speech or purpose. But your lucke is to light on the worst, or your choise leadeth you to fansie the foulest, that you may differ fro other men, & be singular in your own sense. For your selfe see, & say, Li. 35. 
               all the particular (kinds of) crosses in the world neither could nor can possibly come to any man, and so not to Christ. Why then make you that the likeliest meaning of the Apostles words, that Christ suffered all the matter, that is, all those kinds of paines wherein he succoureth vs? If you meane generally, that Christ tasted all sorts of paines, that is, both corporall and spirituall, then shall you neuer conclude, that he tasted this or that kinde of paine in speciall; but it sufficeth that Christ had not only a diuine respect in mercie, but an humane sense and experience of our miseries both outward and inward, to assure vs, that he is compassionate and tenderly affected in our infirmities and extremities, because he himselfe felt the sharpnesse of feare, sorow, shame and paine, whiles heere he liued; and hath not forgotten how neere they pinch the weakenesse of mans nature. And more the Apostle meant not in those words then to shew, the Sonne of God would in his owne person and humane nature feele our infirmities and miseries, that he might haue an humane commiseration and compassion of vs, when we are afflicted, by the remembrance of his owne sufferings, which the words doe fully fit. For Heb. 2. en ho, in that (or in as much as) he suffered, when he was tempted (or tried) he is able (with more tendernesse of heart) to helpe those that are tempted.

               Which way soeuer of these three we take the words, yet they plainly inferre, that Christ him selfe felt all the miserie and smart of our sufferings and Temptations, which at any time we feele.] The smart and griefe of reiection, confusion, desperation, and such like

And none of these waies, which you mention, came neere the concluding of any such thing, except you vrge the first against all truth and sense acknowledged euen by your selfe, where you say, Defenc. pag. 87. li 21. 
               I speake not of euery particular in each of them, or which euery man meeteth withall. Graunt then, that Christ in his manhood would

which euery man hath, or may haue; what reason had you out of the Apostle to conclude so confidently, that Christ must suffer the very same sorowes and paines of hell, which sometimes in this life befall some men through vehement remorse of sinne, and faintnesse of faith? For they are not generall to all Ages and Persons; and if they were, yet proceede they from the guiltinesse of our owne consciences, and the not feeling of Gods grace for the time, that we may see our owne vnworthinesse; neither of which could haue place in Christ. [Generall termes, you say, should be vnderstood according to the possibilitie and probabilitie of the matter.] Be those the raines of your Reasons, that you will vtter matters neither probable, nor possible, and then require to haue your speech recalled to possibilitie and probabilitie? Doe other men vse so to speake or write, that when they haue ouer lashed themselues, they flie to probabilities and possibilities, such as they best like? You must looke, good Sir, to your Propositions and Conclusions, that they be sound and good, concording with the grounds of Faith, and Rules of holy Scripture, and then you shall not neede to make such idle reseruations. Now in your Conceits, which I repeated and refuted, what probabilitie, or possibilitie doe you dreame of? that Christ was touched and plunged deeper then any other man into feares, Passions, and Agonies of reiection, confusion, desperation, and damnation, though at last with much a doe he wrastled from them all? Such Probabilities keepe to your selfe, no wise Christian will admit them, except he see them prooued with stronger Reasons, and cleerer Testimonies, then such loose possibilities and probabilities, as you bring.

               Christ had not his eies put out as Sampson had, nor was swallowed vp by a Whale, as Ionas was; nor was cast into a burning fornace as Sydrac and his fellowes were, nor was stoned to death as Naboth and Steuen were: These I say were iust and full reproofes of your licencious inference, that Christ of necessitie must suffer whatsoeuer his members suffered.

Then Christ yet at last shall be alwayes and altogether free from all sinfull suffering; and then how might his soule or mind apprehend any doubt or feare of Gods fauour towards him, or any the least distrust or staggering of his saluation or our redemption? his faith and hope standing sure and vnshaken, as also the full perswasion of Gods loue towards his person, and acceptation of his obedience,

Secondly, the paines of the damned passe the Patience of all Men and Angels, and much more the weakenesse and frailtie of mortall flesh. Lastly, the purpose of God in laying the burden of oursinn es vpon his owne Sonne, was not to dishonor him, or to forsake him, or to execute vengeance on him prepared for the wicked, but to take recompence from him for all our sinnes in such sort, as better pleased the holinesse and Iustice of God, then if eternall damnation had beene inflicted on vs. So that I see no one point, wherein the damned agree with Christ by the verdict of the holy Scriptures: onely he felt sharpe and bitt

You would faine torment and afflict the Soule of Christ with Gods immediare hand, but your proofe thereof is so weake and idle, and your inconstancie therein so plaine and sensible, that you doe but play with both hands to see, which will soonest deceaue the Reader.

Wherefore though I willingly grant as much paine in Christes sufferings, as his patience could sustaine without declining or disobeying, yet see I no point, wherein the sufferings of Christ, either apprehended or inflicted, did concord with the paines of the damned. As for the terrour of Gods anger against sinne (which wrought in Christ submission, not confusion) and sorow for sinne conceiued, for that God was thereby iustly displeased; these and all such religious FEARES, sorowes, & tremblings, I easily yeeld to the soule of Christ, which were sacrifices in Gods sight of inestimable price, and very painfull, though very faithfull submissions and passions of the inward man.

So that he was more then perswaded, or resolued of Gods fauour and faithfulnesse, who tooke vpon him in the midst of his sufferings to giue the kingdome of heauen to such as acknowledged and beleeued in him; though the chastisement of our sinnes in his body and soule were by Gods iustice and his owne consent very sharpe and bitter vnto him, that his loue to vs and obedience to his Father might appeare the more fully, not in peace, ease, and dalliance, but in sorrow, paine and grieuance: by which ardent and constant loue is tried, as golde in the fire. Whereby it appeareth, that all your talke of Gods wrath against Christ, equall with the damned or reprobate, hath no trueth nor sense in it, but is a meere and flat falsity and impiety: only the generall words, that Christ suffered Gods wrath and displeasure against our sinnes, may be tolerated, because the Scriptures vse to call the bitternesse of affliction in whom soeuer the wrath of God, by reason it riseth not simply out of Gods fauour and bountie, but is permixed with his Iustice, that the transitorie and tolerable smart of our sinnes may euen in this life, when we feele it and faint vnder it, commend vnto vs the wonderfull grace of God, that hath for Christs sake released vs of those euerlasting and vnspeakable Torments, which our sinnes iustly deserued, the Reprobate fully feare, and the damned by experience most dreadfully doe feele.

               You bring a Reason against this, that God spiritually punisheth no man but for his owne vncleannesse which is a thing meerely vntrue.] Out of two Pages in my Sermons against the death of Christs Soule you piked two words, where I call the death of the Soule spirituall punishment, and because, to auoyde tediousnesse, I repeat not in euery line the same words; you neglect, that purposely in that Section I entreate of the death of the Soule; that eighteene times in those two Pages I name the life and death of the Soule, that ouer right those very words, which you bring, I set this Note in the Margine, the Death of Christs Soule could neither proceede from God, nor be acceptable vnto God, as the summe of that which I intended to prooue in that place: that my Conclusion immediatly vrged vpon these words is this, Serm. pag. 103. li. 1. 
               Christ then might not suffer the inward or euerlasting death of the Soule: All this I say you neglect, and ouer-skip many sound and sure reasons in those two sides against the death of Christs Soule, and carpe at two poore words, where I vse spirituall punishment for the death of the Soule. But take the words in their right sense for the death of the Soule, whereof I reason in that place, and then see what you, and all your Adherents can say against them. Eternall or spirituall death, which seuereth the Soule from all grace and glory, God layeth on none for an others fault; because God neuer reiecteth or condemneth any Man but vpon his owne desert. Punish one for another by affliction of Bodie or Mind he may, because he can restore and recompence, when he seeth his Time; though no Man (Christ Iesus excepted) can want sinne, whiles here he liueth, which God may iustly punish when, and in what respect he will.

               If Christs body hanging on the crosse, and held by death in the graue, was punished by God, where yet hee found no sinne, and which he still intirely loued, and was neuer separated from; then so he might and did punish properly Christes soule also, and yet neuer deuide his Godhead, nor his loue from it. The one standeth with Gods iustice, and with the nature of man in Christ, as well as the other.] A wanton colt, when he winceth with his heeles, thinketh he can batter walles, and beate downe trees with a blow; when yet the skittish thing doth but hurt it selfe. Is this the reason which weakened all, that I said in so manie sides against the death of the soule? for of that I speake in all those pages, which you quote. Neede you a paire of spectacles so see the difference betweene the death of the soule, and the death of the bodie, that you so falsely, idlely, and foolishly match them together? A verie drone would soone discerne, that the death of the bodie innocently, obediently, and patiently suffered could no way separate Christ from the fauour and loue of God, nor hinder the worke of our redemption, though it depriued hi

                of life, sense, and motion in the bodie for the time, which are the good blessings of God, when they are vsed to his glorie; and yet the death of the soule, (which leaueth neither action, affection, nor communion of grace, trueth, or faith in the soule)

seuereth both Soule and body quite from God, and maketh them hatefull vnto God, and altogether vnapt to reconcile others vnto God, when they themselues are disioyned and parted from God. And therefore notwithstanding your Crakes, that you can blow mountaines afore you with your breath; and your craft, that shift the death of the Soule, (whereof I speake in all those places) into a proper spirituall punishment of your owne framing; you haue not auoyded any one Reason there, nor offer so much as to come toward the matter in question, but roue after your wonted manner with generall phrases proper to your selfe, and then thinke that no man seeth you. [there are other punishments in the Soule besides death.] but none, that can reconcile vs vnto God. For Rom 5. 
               We were reconciled to God by the death of his Sonne. 
               1. Cor. 15. I declare vnto you (saith Paul) the Gospell, which I preached vnto you, and whereby you are saued. For first of all I deliuered vnto you, that Christ died for our sinnes according to the Scriptures. Then you and whosoeuer else, that preach or beleeue Remission of sinnes by any thing else, but by the death of Christ, you preach not the Gospell, which the Apostle deliuered, neither can you looke for saluation in Christ, that leaue the maine ground thereof, which is the death, that he tasted for all, and through which he destroyed him, that had the power of death, euen the diuell. So that to step to any other spirituall punishments for the satisfaction of our sinnes and reconciliation to God, then to that which the Scriptures call the death of Christ and the death of the Crosse, is to renounce all, that God hath ordained or reuealed for our Saluation, and to create you new Sauiours after your owne conceits. You must therefore be directly and plainly brought to this point, whether Christ suffered for vs the death of the Soule by the Scriptures, and not such giggers of proper punishments, nor straines of improper speeches, as you and your friends hunt after; but fairely and fully according to the direction of the sacred Scriptures, which must be heard, and preferred before all your fansies, as well touching the death of the soule, as the trueth of our redemption by the bloud of Christ Iesus. Wherein though I exclude not the sense and affections of his soule, which felt the paine, knew the cause, and beheld the counsell of God in all those sufferings vndertaken for man, through the tender loue that he bare to man, yet none of those feares, sorrowes, nor paines, which the soule discerned and receiued, did any whit diminish the power of Gods spirit and grace in him, nor the perfection of his faith, hope, and loue, whereby the soule cleaued fast to God without any separation; and consequently the innocence, obedience, and patience of Christes soule in his sufferings both outward and inward, did confirme and manifest the life of his soule. But of this more in due place.

               Then you addresse your selfe against another, euen one of the chiefest reasons of mine, which I make from the strange and incomparable agonies of Christ in the time of his passion.] You make no reasons from Christes agonie; but assuming that for a shew, which you do not vnderstand, you inferre what you list, by your rash, presumptuous and manifest contradictions both to your selfe and to the Scriptures. [Ibid. li. 30. 
               These inuaded him, as we reade, principally at three times; First, in the foretaste of his passion, Ioh. 12. secondly, in the Garden a little before his apprehension. thirdly, in his very extreame passion it selfe on the crosse.] The Scripture mentioneth one agonie, and you multiplie that to three. In the twelfth of Iohn when some of the Grecians that came to worship on the feast of Easter, were desirous to see Christ (of whom they had heard much) and made their desire knowen to Philip, and he to Andrew, and they both to Iesus, Iesus answered them,Iohn 12. 
               The houre was come (euen at hand) that the Sonne of man should be glorified; by his death. This therefore was not a time to shew himselfe, when his (heart or) soule was troubled with other matters, euen with the meditation and preparation of his death. Now except you be so wise, that you will make euery affection in Christ an agonie, there is no cause to conceiue this to be an agonie. He often times thought and spake of his death before, where no man besides you doth dreame of agonies; and this verie word is in other cases ascribed aswell to Christ, as to others, where no colour of an agonie doth appeare. When he tolde his Disciples, that one of them should betray

him, Iohn 13.

               , he was troubled in spirit; and meaning to raise Lazarus from death, when he saw Mary the sister of Lazarus, and the Iewes that were with her, to weepe; Iohn 11. 
               he groned in spirit, and troubled himselfe, insomuch that he wept, which yet was no agonie, but a touch of humane compassion, shewing the loue he bare vnto them. The complaint on the crosse, besides the words, had no shew of an agonie; and what sense they beare, we shall after examine. Verily, he that would not suffer his owne Disciples to beholde his agonie in the Garden, would neuer in the eyes or eares of his enemies with his owne deeds or words verifie their reproches and taunts against himselfe, as if he were forsaken of God, which was the thing they vpbraided him with. And therfore you may deuise not three, but threescore agonies, if you will: The Scripture expresseth one, and that you neither rightly conceiue, nor rightly vse.

               An agonie, sayth he, is not the passing of the (naturall) heat from the higher parts of the bodie vnto the lower, as in feare, but it is rather an increase of heat, as in anger and indignation. And he that is in an agonie, is not troubled with feare or colde, but with expectation of the euent. Wherein Theophrastus not much behinde him, agreeth with him: Theophrastus de Sudoribus. 12.

            I speake not this to bind Christes sweate in the Garden wholy to naturall causes,

but to shew that neither Diuinitie, Philosophy, nor Physicke doe permit that feare or sorow, which coole the blood, and quench the spirits, should be the cause of this bloudie sweate, but that rather as the Euangelist expresseth, it came from strength and contention of zeale, whiles Christ most feruently prayed for that, which he was very desirous, and in present expectation to obtaine. An Angell appeared from heauen
               Luc. 22. 43. 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , strengthning him (saith the Scripture) no question with a message from God. For Angels otherwise were not in this case to entermeddle. And then Christvers. 44. 
               entring into an Agonie, (that is, into a vehement contention of mind to preuaile against that, which resisted or hindred him) he prayed more feruently. From this feruencie of zeale and contention of minde came that bloudie sweate, which the Euangelist mentioneth; which whether we make to be according to Nature, or aboue Nature, it could not proceede from feare or sorrow, as some men imagine. For feare doth driue the bloud inward and coole it, and so can not thinne it, and expell it by the outmost parts and pores of the Body. The Physitian that wrote the Booke de vtilitate Respirationis amongst Galens works, saith.Li. de vtilita

                  e of Nature. No man then may dare impute Christs sweate to weakenesse, because it is against Nature to sweat bloud. Beda followeth him in theBeda in Luc. cap. 22. same words: Rupertus in larger.Rupertus de victoria verbi Dei. li. 12. ca. 21. 
               This is vnwonted, this is aboue nature, the flesh whole, the skinne not cut, for bloude to runne out of all the body, and to fall on the earth as it were sweate. Lyra receaueth the same. According to the Iudgement of diuersLyra in Luc. ca. 22. 
               this was supernaturally done, that bloud should come foorth in steede of sweate; that so Christ euen then might begin to shed his bloud for our saluation. Then neither in Diuine nor humane learning is there any necessitie, that the feare of your hell paines should be the cause of this sweate, which Augustine, Prosper and Bernard ascribe vnto Christs wil and power for a mysticall signification, as I haue shewed in mySerm. pag. 38. & 39. Sermons.
            Thus see we by the words of the holy Ghost, that in the Garden Christs Soule was affected with feare, and afflicted with sorrow; his prayer prooueth his submission, and intention of minde, after comfort sent him from heauen by an Angell; and his bloudie sweate, if we attribute it to nature, must come from zeale; if we referre it to Christs power aboue Nature, might haue many causes to vs vnknowne in particular, though we can ghesse at the generall. Of all these circumstances, actions, and affections, there can no one direct cause be designed in speciall, except in large termes we will say, the worke of our Redemption was the cause of them all; but neither pains, nor suffrings can precisely be determined to be the proper ground of them all, since after comfort from heauen, he fell to most feruent prayer, and therein to his bloudie sweat: much lesse can you conclude, that hell paines were the right and true cause thereof. So that I haue more reason to reiect your maior proposition as apparently false, than you haue right to pronounce it firme, because you can denie mine assertion by flinging off all the Fathers, as vnworthy to haue their iudgements regarded, outfacing the Scriptures with phrases and figures to bring them to your bent. But in the kinds of paines which Christ suffered in the Garden, we doubt as much as in the causes of his agonie. You must therefore declare, what maner of paines you meane in your proposition, before we shall fully vnderstand you.
            
               Defenc. pag. 91. li. 16. 
               You meane it seemeth, that Christ suffered paines in his soule, by reason of the strength and zeale of his holy affections: and that those were the proper and maine causes of that his most wofull and miraculous agonie and complaint. Therefore not only extraordinarie paines inflicted vpon him by way of proper punishment, as my proposition intendeth.] You seeke nothing but by confusion to couer and colour your absurd and false doctrines, and that maketh you huddle and heape things together without all distinction or exposition.

Christes agonie in the Garden was before any paines inflicted on his bodie or soule, other than feare or sorrow, which were painfull affections rising from diuers occasions and causes, as we shall afterward see. His complaint on the Crosse was in the midst and extreamest of his paines now inherent, and afflicting both soule and body. You couple Christes agonie in the Garden with his complaint on the Crosse, and yoke them together as proceeding both from one direct and particular cause, which breedeth more doubt in my answer, that should containe both in one, than trueth in your argument, that obiecteth both at once.

                  •…
               , though she knewe not whence, or how that paine commeth. Therefore I make paine as it is distinct from feare and sorrow, and riseth from neither of them, to be a naturall and absolute passion and sense of euill present and inherent in soule or bodie. 1. Iohn 4. 
               feare hath painfulnesse, saith Saint Iohn; and sorrow not only2. Cor. 2.

               hope differred afflicteth the soule, saieth Salomon. So that all our affections may haue griefe in them, loue and ioy not excepted, when they are disappointed: and sorrow & feare may be mitigated, but not separated from griefe and dislike; yet in neither of them is the euill present & inherent, nor the sense and feeling thereof absolute or meerely passiue, but according as the mind conceaueth and esteemeth of the causes and obiects thereof, so the griefe of feare and sorow increaseth or decreaseth.
            Now touching Christes agonie in the Garden, the Scripture auoucheth, that feare and sorrow possessed and grieued his mind, but that an absolute or inherent paine was inflicted on Christes soule by the immediat hand of god, either in the Garden, or on the Crosse, this is a late and lew de deuice of yours, it hath no ground nor proofe in the Scriptures. And yf by paines you meane this absolute kind of torment impressed on Christes soule by Gods owne hand, as you would haue it; I vtterly denie that any such paines presently felt were parts or causes of Christs agonie in the Garden, and so your proposition, that you fained to be firme, hath not one true word in it.

As also your fourth fallacie, which may be called Fallacia accidentis.] To the three last notable equiuocations, as he calleth them, here is all that this Defensor speaketh in this place, where he would haue thee, Christian Reader, so considerately to marke some maruellous matters. And thus shalt thou often be troubled with his vaine tatling, when thou most expectest either his proofs or his promises. He sendeth thee backe to peruse his former pages, where thou shalt finde as little to the purpose, as here thou doest, though words he wanted not to couer his conceits. Is there be any thing in those pages proued by him, which I haue not in the same places confuted, I am content to hazzard the perill of thy censure. Howbeit, I thinke thou mayest perceiue by my carriage, that I desire to auoid and preuent all ambiguities, as much as in me lieth. I speake as plainly as my simple

abilitie will suffer me; I distinguish thinges as euidently, as either the matter permitteth, or the trewth requireth. And therefore he, that in all his defence hath yet vttered not one distinct and cleere sentence touching his cause, but clowded and cloaked with proper and meere, and such like shifts, and shadowes neuer expounded by himselfe, and knowen to no man, but himselfe, hath small reason, (though as much in this as in the rest) to say that fallacies are the Pillars of my doctrine. But if thou beleeue Pedlers praising their owne wares; then maiest thou credit this booke-maker craking of his cleere and Sunne-shine proofes, which he himselfe neither expresseth, nor vnderstandeth. The equiuocation of the word SVFFERING which in this place his mastershipp will deale withall, will giue thee a tast, what thou shalt looke for in the rest.
            
               Defenc. pag. 92. li, 1. 
               The common and ordinarie phrase vnderstandeth herein, Christes feeling of paines inflicted on him by way of PROPER punishment and satisfaction for sinne, which he vndertooke for vs. Onely this in the ordinarie and vsuall manner of speach is signified by Christes suffering, or his passion: and so we alwaies vnderstand by it.] This is one of your enlightned and purified expositions, which is as faire and bright, as the darknes of Egypt. Doe men vsually & ordinarily describe Christs passion to be nothing els, but the feeling of paines inflictedon him by way of proper punishment? who vseth these wordes by way of proper punishment, besides your selfe and your adherents, who vnder that colour would secretly conuey the paines of the damned into the soule of Christ? for what is the proper punishment of sinne? that which all sinners not Redeemed by Christ must endure, or that which all men being sinners doe endure, or that which none endured but Christ alone, because it was proper to the dignitie of his person, with that punishment, which god laied on him by the hands and mouthes of men, to satisfie the iustice of God for our sinnes, and vtterly to abolish the guilt and wages of our sinne? Proper may be either to the damned, whose sinnes are neuer pardoned; or proper to sinne in all mankinde, euer since the first man forsooke his Creator; or proper to Christes person, and not common to him with the damned. Which of all these senses do you containe in the word Proper? You spake euen now of equiuocations, and made a grieuous complaint to your Reader, that I meant to circumuent you with ambiguities; and what is this but to turne your Readers eyes aside on me, whiles you play your part with the maine worke of Christes passion for mans Redemption? how often haue I chalenged in you this shifting with proper and improper, when and where pleased you? Christes sufferings in all mens speeches, saue yours, were farre larger than his passion. He suffered afliction all the time of his life, yea the whole course of his life was a continuall suffering of reproches, disdaines, dispites: besides the naturall infirmities of our flesh, as hunger, cold, wearines, weeping and such like, which in his person were all sufferings, and yet no man calleth his life his passion: his passion we take to be the manner of his death, and so all his sufferings from the Garden to the graue, imposed on him by the hands, mouthes, or harts of men betraying, forsaking, or pursuing him, were parts of his passion. The false accusing and vniust condemning him, the mocking, reproching, and reuiling him to be wicked and forsaken of God, were parts of his passion, and yet these were no inherent nor sensible paines, of which you would seeme to speake, when you exclude his affections of feare and griefe of minde, as no parts of his passion.

                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , and by the Latine, passiones, passions or sufferings of the minde. The Apostles applie the word 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

Manifest proofes thereof are euery where occurrent in the Scriptures. Heb. 10 v. 32

Yea not only feare and sorow of minde, which are the painfnll affections of our nature, but euen corporall affections, though naturall, were sufferings in Christ.

These all Christ tooke vnto him, that he might sanctifie all.

Neither are the violences offered to the bodie called paines, but because the soule by nature disliketh them, howsoeuer by faith she may be content to endure them for Gods cause; and so the impressions of feare and sorrow, in that they are painfull, they are sufferings of the soule, though charitie perswade them in other mens troubles, or necessitie impose them in our owne cases, or pietie raise them in respect of God. Psal. 51.

Reioice and be glad, for great is your reward in heauen; so pursued they the Prophets before you. This is a great blessednes, and yet a great suffering of minde, to be reuiled and slandered; and therefore holinesse in Christ, as in the Saints, did not exclude, but rather commend and aduance Christes sufferings.

And you, that seuer his holinesse and righteousnesse from his sufferings, as if he were defiled and accursed with them, lewdlie abuse both the word of God, and faith of Christ, which containe no such thing.

               Christes exact and perfect keeping of Gods iust law, and his sufferings, are two parts of Christes mediation greatly differing, and ought not both in trueth be called his passion or satisfaction for sinne.] His passion I call the things suffered at or about the time of his death; because not the instant of breathing out his soule, but the whole order and maner of comming to his death after his last supper, is by the Scriptures inclosed in the name of his death, and by all sober and aduised writers called his Passion or suffering of death. His whole life besides was full of sufferings, and euen those naturall infirmities of hunger, thirst, wearinesse, and such like, were voluntarie sufferings in him, because he had power enough in himselfe to represse or exclude those punishments in
                  •…

               tious, were likewise voluntarie sufferings in him, and pertained to the humilitie and obedience, to which he submitted himselfe for the fuller satisfaction of our sinnes, as well by his life as death. That our whole life is a suffering for our sinne in Adam, S. Austen exactly noteth: August. in Psal. 37. 
               Non enim in illum non est vindicat

Neither did God not reuenge Adam, nor sayd in vaine: Thou shalt die the death; neither do we suffer any thing in this life, but from that death which we deserued by the first sinne. And making an example of hunger, sayth; August. ibid.

                   quod erat poena, natura nobis est. This hunger (of the bodie) is a disease of nature, because the punishment inflicted (on Adam) to reuenge (his sin) is our nature. That which was punishment to the first man, is become nature to vs. Christ then in partaking our nature, did partake with our punishment, and his submitting himselfe to that, what was it but a continuall suffering of our punishment, by feeling our naturall infirmities both of soule and bodie, though still without sinne, and all naturall necessitie, as in vs; that his obedience might be the more euident and acceptable vnto God. So that it is no equiuocation in me, to call feare and sorrow of minde in Christ, sufferings for sinne, notwithstanding they were innocent and obedient in him, and so parts of his humane holinesse and righteousnesse directly tending to satisfaction for our sinfull disobedience. The full price and payment whereof was death, the close of mans life, which as it was the last, so was it the greatest and weightiest part of his obedience, and recompence to Gods Iustice for our sinnes: but it is an idle vagation in you, when you can neither refute nor resist the trueth, to make an appeale against ambiguities, when you your selfe can neither proue, nor dare plainly expresse, that you intend.

               might for a time somewhat astonish the humane nature of Christ; yet so, that the sight of our sinnes, and the wages thereof Pa. 23. li. 2. 
               impressed nothing (that is no feare) in the soule of Christ, but a religious feare to sorow for the one, and pray against the other. Here are expresly named religious feare, sorow and (zealous) praier; occasioned by the sight of the cuppe of Gods wrath prepared for our sinnes. How then doth this exclude the rest of the causes, which are there precedent or consequent? or how come you to cast away Christes sorow for sinne, and

praier against the desert of our euill deedes, (whereof the first rose from the submission, that Christ made vnto Gods wrath prouoked, and the second from the compassion, that Christ had towards men endangered) and to leaue but one, where I name three? Are you so well skilled in the Scriptures, that you doe not know, a Religious feare of God compriseth the whole seruice of God; and therefore might much more containe the holines of Christs affections, when he submitted himselfe to the will and hand of God for our sakes? What rudenes then, or rashnes, or both is this, when I note diuers partes or effects of one thing, or vse diuers words to describe one and the same matter, for you to quote out contrarieties by Arithmetick, because the wordes be different, and neuer to weigh the sense in which they accord?
            So trifle you with the two generall causes, as if they could not containe the six speciall that, I say, might be of Christs agonie, when yet those six are but remembrances of some respects, that Christ might haue in his feare and sorow; and those two comprehend all six as parts, or consequents of Christs submission to God and compassion on men. Neither doe I pretend or professe, that euery of these six was the whole and entire cause of his agony; (It is your dottage so to dreame, and no piece of my mind.) These six, and many moe reasons and occasions Christe might haue at that time to feare and sorow, wherin I doe not determine, which was the full and true cause of that agonie; but how many respects might lead him to feare and sorrow at that present, which I doe not conclude as certaine, but propose as possible, and farre more probable, then your reall paines of the damned supposed at that instant actually to torment the soule of Christ. Leaue therefore your one, two, and six, to Tilers to tell their pinnes, or Wittalls to number their Geese; and shew that either I determine any precise or particuler cause ef Christs agonie, thereby to deserue mine owne censure, as you doe; or that those six, which I mention, may not be referred to those two generalls, which I note, that so at least you may make me disagree with my selfe.

               shall I not drinke of the cup (saith Christ) which the Father hath giuen me? The fruit of this Iudgment is euerie where specified in the Scriptures. 1. Pet. 2. 
               Christ bare our sinnes in his bodie on the Tree, by whose stripes ye were healed, that being deliuered from sinne, wee should liue to righteousnes. What need you then so curiously question, Against whom or in what cause sate God in iudgment now when Christ was thus astonished, and agonized? God sate in iudgment to receaue satisfaction for the sinnes of his elect at the hands of his owne Sonne by his humilitie and obedience vnto death.

               Of necessitte it must be one of these three wayes. First, Gods maiestie and great iustice now at this time might sit in iudgment against vs, and so consequently, yea chiefly against Christ himselfe as our Ransomepaier & Suertie in our steed. 
               li. 16. 
               Secondly, God might be considered now as iudging Satan the Prince of this world. 
               Pa. 94. li. 40. 
               Thirdly, Gods matestie & iustice may be considered sitting in iudgment meerely against sinfullmen.] You be copious where you neede not, and carelesse, where most cause is you should be circumspect, to make an idle shew of small skill, you bring here a TRIPLE iudgment of God; First, against vs and Christ our suertie; Secondly, against Satan; Thirdly, against sinnefull men, which were either elect or reprobate: as though one and the same iudgment of God for mans Redemption did not concerne all three: to witt, Christ as the Redeemer,Gods iudgement for our redemption concerneth Christ, men, and Satan. Satan as the accuser, the Elect as the ransomed, leauing the reprobate in their sinnes through their vnbeliefe vnto the dreadfull day of vengeance. In that the Redeemer was by this iudgment receaued and allowed to make satisfaction for the sinnes of his elect, Satan was excluded from all place and power to accuse them for sinne, or to raigne ouer them by sinne, and the purgation of their sinnes, which should beleeue in Christ, being made by the Person of the Sauiour, they were reconciled to God by the death of Christ and discharged from the wrath to come; the anger of god remaining on such, as by faith obeied not the sonne of God. Saue therfore your fruitlesse paines in the rest, and shew why the beholding of Gods power and iustice now sitting in iudgment to redeeme the world, and to receaue recompence from the person of Christ for the sinnes of men, might not breed a religious feare and trembling in the humane nature of Christ.

               If you meane that thus Christ with submission beholding his Father in iudgement at this time was cast into this agonie, it is the verie trewth, and the same which we maintaine.] You take this for a shew to build your fansies on, but as your maner is you abuse trewthes to serue your turnes. Let it stand for good, that Christ now beheld his FatherChrist might beholde the power of his Fathers wrath against sinne, and yet not feare the vengeance due to the wicked. sitting in iudgment to require recompence for the sinnes of the faithfull; what followeth? that God awarded the selfe same vengeance against the person of Christ, that we had deserued, and should haue suffered, if we had not beene redeemed? This is a false, hereticall, and blasphemous conclusion no way coherent to the premisses, and no way consonant to the Scriptures. For then finall destruction, desperation, confusion and euerlasting damnation of soule and bodie to hell fire, which without question were the wages of our sinnes, as we may see by their example, that are not

clensed from sinne by the bloud of Christ, must without reseruation or remedie haue lighted on the person of Christ. If that vengeance of sinne, which was due to vs, could by no iustice be inflicted on the person of the sonne of God, no not, if he had borne the sinnes of the whole world; how then could the doubt or feare of his punishment on himselfe cast him into this agony? you will release him of the circumstance, but tie him to the substance of the selfe same pains, which the damned endure. When you sitt in iudgement on Christ, shew your wicked and witles conceits, as much as you list; but the father, to whom of right it appertained, sitting in iudgment to receaue 
                  〈◊〉
                from the person of his sonne, who was most willing thereto, ne did, ne could by iustice determine any thing against his owne sonne, that should either derogate from the person of Christ, or abrogate the loue which God professed and pronounced so often from heauen towards him. God might haue condemned vs, that most iustly deserued it; but to adiudge the same condemnation to his owne Sonne, was simply impossible to the Iustice, holines, trueth and loue of God. For so the vnion of Christes person must either be dissolued, which god hath faithfully sworne, and mightily wrought, or els the second person in Trinitie must haue tasted of the same vengeance with the damned and with the Diuells, which is a blasphemie that the Diuell neuer drempt, nor durst to broche.

                  〈◊〉
               , the reall paines of the damned were inflicted on the soule of Christ at that instant, except in madde mens conceits, which respect more their pangs than their proofs, and preferre their willes before the wisdome of Gods spirit, or witnesse of mans reason. All iudgement against sinne, you will say, tendeth vnto condemnation.] No iudgement against the Sonne of God could proceed vnto damnation for what or whose sinnes soeuer. And therefore to me, and to all that obserue the words of the Holy Ghost, it is a cleerer case than the Sunne-shining at noone day, that we are reconciled to God by the death of his Sonne, and healed by his stripes, who bare our sinnes in his bodie on the tree, and whose 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   was shed for many sor remission of sinnes. Your infliction of hell paines on the soule of Christ is no such trifle, that it may be lightly taken vp for your pleasure, or humorously surmised vpon your vaine coniectures; you must euidently and ineuitablely prooue it, before any wise or sober Christian will or should beleeue it. Ch
                     •…
                  istes feare and agonie, you thinke, could haue no other cause.] Of all others this can neuer be concluded to haue beene the cause, since there is no witnesse nor word thereof in all the Scriptures. That euerlasting damnation was due to our sinnes, we haue no doubt, but that any such iudgement could be decreed or executed against the Sonne of God, or against any part of his person, we lesse doubt. Wherefore it is most manifest to all that list not to mixe their desperate deuices with Gods eternall trueth, that no such iudgement could be giuen against the person of Christ, as we should haue 
                  〈◊〉
               , or as the damned feele; but the Esa. 53. 
               chastisement of our peace was layd vpon him, and 
               Heb. 5. 
               though he were the Sonne, yet by the things which he suffered, he learned obedience. [It is no iudgement, you will say, where nothing is condemned.] In the finall iudgement of God against the wicked, both their sinnes and their persons shall be condemned; that is, their persons shalbe euerlastingly reiected and adiudged to perpetuall torments of bodie and soule in hell fire for their sinnes, which God iustly hateth and punisheth. In the 1. Pet. 4. 
               iudgement, which beginneth at the house of God, sinne is condemned in their flesh, as it was in Christes, but their persons are beloued in Christ, and so cleansed from sinne by him that sanctifieth himselfe for their sakes, and whose bloud clenseth them from all their sinnes. The paterne of which iudgement was precedent in Christ their head, to whose 
               Rom. 8. 
               image the whole bodie must be conformed, that 2. Tim. 2. 
               suffering with him, they may

               raigne with him, and being 1. Pet. 4. 
               condemned as touching men in the flesh, they may liue as touching God in the spirit. There must be the same minde in vs, that was in Christ, euen as there is the same condemnation in our flesh that was in his. For in Christ and all his members, sinne was condemned in the flesh, that their spirits might liue to God, and their bodies be raised againe to be partakers of the same blisse with their spirits. The Scriptures therefore doe not appoint the iudgement of hell or of the damned vnto Christ and his members, but only the destruction of their flesh ioyned with the saluation of their spirits.
            
               What need had Christ (you will aske) to feare this iudgement?] As Christ had lesse need to feare the iudgement seat of God, than all his members, so had he more will, care and power to giue God his due, than all the rest of his brethren. And therefore approching to God for sinners and with sinne, as he vndertooke their persons and cause, that is, to present them to God, and to profer satisfaction for their sinnes; so he taught vs all our duties, which is, to approch the throne of Maiestie with all reuerence and feare, when we beholde his passing glorie, and our exceeding infirmitie, and in faith of his goodnesse, and feare of his greatnesse, to tremble and shake before him. This Christian submission which God requireth of all men, Christ did most of all performe, when he presented vs and our cause to God; and therefore prostrate flat on the earth, he humbled himselfe with greater feare and trembling (but without distrust or doubt of Gods fauour) than euer man before or since did. This feare and trembling with all submission and deuotion yeelded by the humane nature of Christ to the diuine Maiestie of God, you no way like; but in a selfe conceit will haue it to be the feare of desperate and damned persons, and Christes soule to be actually tormented with the same paines that are the sharpest in hell: and all this you gather vpon none other ground, but for that Christ exceedingly feared and sorrowed in the Garden. But if no man guided by Gods spirit may heare the words, doe the works, or receiue the messengers of God, but with feare and trembling, as a seruice and duetie belonging to the Creatour from the weakenesse of the creature; how much more might the humane nature of Christ now offering vs all, that were sinfull, to the presence of God with infinite desire and most ardent prayer to make recompence in his owne person for our offences; and so through his loue and sauour with God, to reconcile vs to God; how much more I say might Christ in our cause and in our names shew all possible feare and trembling to so great Maiestie so mightily displeased with vs? And therefore in either respect both of his owne religious humilitie, and our sinfull infirmity, he might performe this seruice and submission vnto the throne of Gods heauenly presence.
            
               Defenc. pag. 93. li. 32. 
               Your testimonies touching men sinfull, make nothing to the purpose at all: for these could not by reason of their sinnes endure the verie presence of Gods Maiestie, being in any measure reuealed vnto them: but Christ in himselfe being free from all sinne, could be in no such case.] Your exceptions are more friuolous, and no way fit your fansies: for what if conscience of sinne breed an amazed feare in men, when the glorious presence of God is in any measure reuealed vnto them, doth that exclude the religious affection & submission of feare and trembling, which mans weakenesse in this life oweth to the diuine Maiesty? Esa. 66. 
               Him will I respect (saith God) that is poore in spirit, and trembleth at my words. Not only Gods glory reuealed, but his word denounced requireth submission and reuerent trembling. Phil. 2. 
               Worke your saluation (sayth the Apostle) with feare and trembling; not meaning men should alwayes be amazed, or that God still reuealed his glorious presence, but that our infirmitie remembred, and his Maiestie considered, we should do all things commanded by him with feare and trembling. Of the Corinthians Paul testifieth, that they receiued Tite 2. Cor. 7. 
               with feare and trembling. Such reuerence the faithfull yeeld to the words and works of God, that they tremble at the presence of his messengers. And lest you should thinke, that only conscience of sinne, and the brightnesse of Gods presence impresse this affection, the Apostle requireth seruants to obey their Ephes. 6. 
               carnall masters with feare and trembling: and witnesseth of himselfe,

when he preached the Gospell to the Corinthians, he 
               1. Cor. 2. 
               was amongst them in feare and much trembling. So that not onely guilt of sinne maketh men to feare and flie the sight of God, as in Adam, when he first transgressed; and in Peter, before he was called (whose words you abuse, to elude the rest, which is brought against you) but in all our actions, dueties and affections we are willed by the holy Ghost, to haue a religious and reuerent respect with feare & trembling to the word, will and presence of God. 
               Heb. 12. 
               Let vs haue grace, thereby to serue and please God with reuerence and feare. Where we are taught, that not sinne, but grace maketh men to serue and please God with reuerence and feare, which before are called feare and trembling, during the time of our conuersing heere on earth. Though then Christ did neither flie, nor feare the presence of God for any conscience of sinne, yet his humane nature consisting of our flesh, and compassed as yet with our infirmitie, knew well what religious and reuerent submission with feare and trembling was due from the creature to the creator; and specially, when he presented vs that were sinfull to the throne of Grace: for whom he humbled himselfe vnder the mightie hand of God, to abolish our pride, and approched Gods presence with vnspeakable care and sorow, feare and trembling, to recompence our heauie dulnesse and carelesse neglect both of Gods anger and our owne danger. Which Christ obserued in his owne Disciples, that otherwise deerely loued him, and were often called on by him to watch and pray, and yet were they in their deepest s

               No better is that of the Angels (meere creatures) vailing their faces at the glorious presence of God the Creator of all: but Christ the Mediator was not a meere creature, but alwayes personally vnited with greater power than the Angels were; and alwayes sustained by it.] As if the manhood of Christ did not hunger and thirst, waxed wearie, and wept, though it were alwayes vnited to his Godhead. The greater his power, by which he might haue refused and repelled all infirmitie, the greater his humilitie and obedience, that would subiect himselfe of his owne good will to these afflictions and affections of mans weaknesse. By suffering of death, as likewise in all our infirmities, he made himselfe Heb. 2. 
               lower than the Angels; yet what doth that hinder, but the manhood of Christ, which was made of a woman, and therefore a creature, though personally ioyned with the Creator by the great goodnesse and grace of God, might in the dayes of his flesh most willingly submit it selfé with religious feare and trembling, since that either shewed the thankefulnesse of the creature to the creatour for so great honour and fauour, as to be receiued into the coniunction and communion of the Godhead, or declared his loue and likenesse tó vs, that in our cause would lay downe his power and right for the time, and be like affected with vs, that so he might commend vs vnto God? You can be content, that the 
               Defenc. pag. 94. li. 5. 
               Godhead should purposely hide it selfe as it were, and withdraw his wonted comfort, that the manhood of Christ might be subiect to the paines of the damned, which you call full punishment for vs; but you can not heare, that the Godhead should guide the manhood of Christ to humble it selfe in our cause with a most religious and reuerent feare and trembling, to giue God his due, and thereby to teach all his members to doe the like. But if the Apostle speake most truely, that the 
               Rom. 8. v. 26 
               spirit it selfe maketh requests for vs with sighs which cannot be expressed; why should not the manhood of Christ much more performe the part that is proper to his office, to pray for transgressours, with all affection and submission belonging to God either from our nature, or from our condition? In sinne Christ might not communicate with vs; but since sorow for sinne, and most humble submission to the power of God displeased with sinne, are rather in Christes person recompences for sinne (which we could not make) than infections of sinne; why should you by pretence of Christes power make those religious offices impossible to him, whom notwithstanding you will haue amazed and confounded in all the powers and parts of soule and bodie with the terrour and feare of your hell paines? Is your zeale so great for Christes power, that you will not haue him trouble himselfe with any religious submission of minde to the throne of Gods glorie, by his example to teach vs to tremble at the

greatnesse thereof; and yet you spare not to load him with vnspeakable terrours and feares of Gods indignation, and his owne confusion? Such deuotion doth well beseeme your hellish inuentions, but it no way sorteth with Christian religion.

               In respect as God proceeded against Satan and for this cause, that Christ should be cast into these dreadfull feares, sorrowes and bloudy agonies, what man of Iudgement will Imagine? what colour of likelihood is there in it?] That Satan was presently cast out from hindering mans saluation, and should in the ende be troden vnder foote; that Christ obtained by his prayer for vs: but what spoyle he should make in the Church of Christ by heresie, iniquitie and Tyrannie, when our Sauiour beheld, who could not be ignorant thereof, why should not that mooue the manhood of Christ both grecuously to sorrow for the weakenesse and dulnesse, falles and offences of his members, as also with most vehement and inflamed zeale, euen vnto the sweating of bloud, to pray against the power and rage of Satan, to haue it cut short and fully subiected, as all other enemies, vnder his and our feete? And who of any sense will thinke it strange, that Christ approching the brunt of his passion should performe that to all, which he professed to Peter and the rest. Luke. 22. 
               Behold Satan hath desired you to winnow you as wheate, but I haue prayed for thee, that thy faith faile not: because he was the first that should haue most neede? Christ was able without prayer, if we respect his diuine power, to vphold Peter and all the rest against the worst, that Satan could doe vnto them; Iohn 17. 
               Whiles I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name, those that thou gauest me, haue I kept, and none of them is lost: But this was the time of his submission and humiliation euen vnto death, and therefore soreseeing himselfe and all his members by Gods iust iudgement to be so farre deliuered into Satans hands, that they should be sifted with all manner of tentations and trials; as he most humbly submitted himselfe, and his members thereto, so he most affectionately and with greater vehemencie, then euer man did or could pray, desired the feeblenesse and folly of his elect to be forgiuen them, and the old and cruell serpents head to be bruized, and conquered, that he might haue no power, but to bite their heeles. These I say, and many moe occasions and reasons might leade our Sauiour to that prayer so full of compassion and affection to vs, that euen feruencie might open the pores of his body, and straine forth his bloud, to shew that he bent all the powers of Body and Soule in making his prayers vnto God.
            As for ioy and triumph, which this conquest ouer Satan did and doth bring, I make no doubt thereof; but we now speake of the prayer, wherewith Christ obtained

it, and of the triall, wherein both head and members were to be conformed, and consummate with affliction, and that for the time was as sharp, as the fruite thereof in the end would be sweete; that not onely Christ was first to

               We must through many afflictions enter into the kingdome of God. In speaking against these things you shew as much iudgement, as you doe in the rest of your conceits, which haue your bare word for their best warrant, and your vnlearned humour for their chiefest helpe.

               Thirdly, if you meane (that God sate in Iudgement) here against the sinnes of the elect, Christ knew the eternall and sure decree of God, which had turned the cup of vengeance alreadie from them vpon himselfe, as being their Suertie: so that this commeth to our assertion.] Christ knew, that the second person in Trinitie by whom his manhoode was now assumed, had before all worlds consented to beare the burden or punishment of our sinnes in his Body, and by himselfe to make the purgation of them, and that the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost had eternally decreed this to be the meane and

To Iames and Iohn the Sonnes of Zebedee, that asked to sit, the one at his right hand, the other at his left, he answered; Marke. 10. 
               Can yee drinke of the Cup that I shall drinke of? and they saying, they could, he replied; Ye shall drinke indeede of the cup, that I shall drinke of. If Christ had the Cup of vengeance common to him with the desperate and damned, then Iames and Iohn, and consequently all his Disciples and members dranke of the same Cup, for they all dranke of his cup. And Paul missed much of his reckning, when he said; Phil. 3. 
               I counted all things losse, and doe iudge them to be dong, that I may know the fellowship of Christs afflictions, and be made conformable to his death. Can you perswade any man of common sense, that Paul was so desirous to suffer the death of the Soule, and the paines of the damned, that he iudged all things vile in comparison thereof? for so he was affected to the fellowship of Christs sufferings, which was an other manner of Cup, then you conceiue, or else Paul erred very grossely in his Account.

               Touching the Reprobates doe you thinke, that Christ here so vehemently wished them better, whom he knew God hated: or that for pittie of them he fell into this Agonie and sorowfull prayers? Such a Iester besides your selfe, a man shall hardly iump with all. Of Christs Agonie in the Garden as there were sundry parts, so there were sundry causes. You take euery particular by the Pole, and examine that, as if it were offered to be the sole and entire cause of the whole Agonie. But leaue this wide wandering, and litle vnderstanding, and trie whether Christ were not so much affected to his owne Nation, that he greatly sorowed for their reiection. [Ibid. li. 19. 
               Christ saith a litle before he would not so much as pray for them.] He would not pray to crosse Gods Counsell towards the whole Nation, but onely for such as should beleeue in him: yet he pittied them, and praied pardon euen for those, that put him to death: Luke. 23. 
               Father forgiue them, for they know not what to doe.

               It is certaine Christ rather would haue greatly reioyced to see the due execution of Gods most holy and deserued Iustice, which is a speciall part of his high glory.] Your certainties are like Spiders webs, euery touch will teare them. If Christ of your certaine knowledge would haue so greatly reioyced to see the destruction of the Iewes, how came it to passe, that beholding Ierusalem he wept for it? If the remembrance of their desolation moued him to teares, would the present sight of their destruction haue bred in him such great ioy, as you talke of? Haue you so vtterly forgotten,

These are not your contrarieties, but concordance; wherein you rightly agree with your selfe, that neuer vsein your assertions to make one piece agree with an other. How much Christ might grieue at those things, we shall presently examine; but that he grieued more at this time now in the garden for these respects, then at any other time before, you doe not grant, because you see no reason for it.

Why wept he then but once ouer her? why did he not the like for other Cities, wherein the Iewes dwelt, can you tell? he was often tempted by the Pharisees, and still saw the hardnes of their harts.

When I heare you speake some truth, or see you vnderstand any thing right, I will more regard your word, then now I doe. That these things might be the causes thereof, shall plainly appeare to the sober and aduised Reader, when we come to the discussing of them; Howbeit I doe not say, that euery one of these sixe was the whole cause of his Agonie; as you childishly carpe; or that these sixe were the sole causes of his Agonie; but these respects were such, as might most exceedingly grieue, and most inwardly affect the Soule of Christ, making now way by prayer to procure the course of mans Redemption to be actually and effectually decreed and pronounced at his instance; which he would after perfect with patience. Neither are there greater workes in mans redemption, then these that were now in hand, with which if you thinke it not likely, nor possible, the Soule of our Sauiour should be mightily affected, your erroneous Imagination is farre stranger then my position of pietie and possibilitie. for as if you aske me, what the Angell that came from heauen, said to Christ in the Garden, I must openly professe, I take vpon me no such knowledge, but leaue Gods secrets to himselfe and his Sonne; so what occasions

besides these might at that instant affect the Soule of Christ, I dare not determine, though you be so desperate, that you nothing doubt, Christ then felt in Soule from the immediate hand of God the selfe same paines, which the damned doe in hell; Notwithstanding the Scriptures insinuate no such suspition, much lesse auouch any such Doctrine for mans redemption.
            
               Defenc pag. 95 li. 1. 
               For the Reiection of the Iewes what reason bring you. Christ wept ouer their Cittie: ergo, now at his Passion he was driuen into his dreadfull Agonie for this cause.] You must make your owne match, or else you will quickly marre all. Where I professed it impossible certainly to conclude the true cause of Christs Agonie, your wisedome taketh a part of my words, and clappeth on a Conclusion to them of your owne stamping, and then you say the Argument is nought: and so nimble you be at nothing, that where I repeate sixe causes, that might be concurrent therein, you will haue me inferre, that euery one of them was the whole and sole cause thereof. But your mastership is to warme to be wise, and to selfe-willed to be sound, you doe not so much as see, or care, why I tooke this in for one of the causes, that might meete in this Agonie. The reuerent Sermo. pag. 19. li. 4. regard I had to the Iudgements of Ambrose, Ierom, Augustine, and Bede, who obserued this before me as one of the causes, that might be of Christs sorrow in the Garden, made me number this amongst the rest, howsoeuer you spurne them away like foote-bals, and thinke with a wilde gallop to winne the Goale. But soft Sir, first their opinions lie in your way, which wise men will respect before your emptie wordes, and lasie likelihoods, that haue no salt in them, besides the sharpnesse of your humour. Secondly, my reasons to my purpose are auaileable enough, though you mishape them with a senselesse error of your own, as if euerie of these six were the single and sole cause of this agonie. There can no one particular cause be assigned of Christes feare, sorrow, and zeale in the Garden; but since himselfe is a witnesse, that his Soule was 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                on euery side pressed with sorrow, my proofes which you cannot auoide, inferre, that amongst others this might be one cause of his sorrow. And so much those Fathers professe, as I haue formerly shewed; and you cannot decline them but with impudent flurting at them, that Defenc. pag. 95. li. 15. 
               this verily cannot stand with any reason. But of our Reasons let the Reader Iudge. Christ wept at the sight of Ierusalem, when he remembred her desolation by the hands of the Romanes. What griefe then was it to him in all reason, to foresee the reiection of that people from the sauour of God by their rash and wicked desire to haue his bloud on them and their children, at the time of his arraignment before Pilate? If Moses and Paul so vehemently 
                  〈◊〉
                at the fall of their bretheren according to the flesh, that for their sakes the one wished to be wiped out of the Booke of God, the other most sacredly protested the great heauinesse and continuall anguish, that he felt in hart for them; how much more then did it grieue the Sauiour of the world, who farre exceeded both the other in compassion and mercie, to see himselfe, that came to blesse them, and saue them, to be the ruine and stone of offence, that should stumble them, and their children, striking them with perpetuall blindnesse, and bruizing them with euerlasting perdition, through their vnbeliefe. To this what answere you?
            
               Defenc. pag. 95. li. 28. 
               It prooueth that Christ surely had very great pittie and commiseration of them, but nothing else in the world.] I professed to prooue no more. Why then should not this be one of the causes, that mooued Christ to sorrow in the Garden, where he confes
                  •…
               ed his Soule was on euery side heauie? Ibid. li. 30. 
               Christ might haue farre greater pittie of them, then Moses or Paul had, and yet he was able to carrie his affection farre more patiently and quietly then they were able.] Doth any man besides you say, that Christ was impatient in his Agonie, but that as he was fully able to restraine all violence and vehemence of affection in himselfe, when he would; so was he likewise able to shew the inward touch and motion of mercie towards that people, by what signes he would, and by farre greater then Moses and Paul were able, and yet without all distemper or impatience, as you interpret his Agonie to be. Ibid. li. 34. 
               Also Christ knew

exactly Gods counsell and purpose for their reiection, which those holy men were not so particularly sure of. Wherefore Christ might better stay the vehemencie and breaking out of this affection, which in such a case must needes tend against the knowen will of God.] Moses and Paul were sure enough of that, which they were sorie for, though the euidence of their knowledge was not comparable to Christs in any thing. And I pray you what letteth, but the clearer Christs knowledge was of the horrible vengeance of God, that should light on the Iewes for their wicked despising and murdering of him, the greater might his sorrow be for them, so long as he sorowed not, that God would be righteous, but that they would be both impious in the fact, and incredulous in the Gospell of repentance, and so prouoke the Iustice of God to that extreame reuenge. Neither is that any way to impugne Gods knowen will, to be sorie that men will be so mad, as to heape vp vengeance on their owne heads: God rather alloweth that affection in vs here on earth, where we are not compassed or confirmed with glorie, as our Sauiour then was not with his, that as 
               Lament. 3. 
               he doth not punish with his hart (or willingly,) so we should not wish, or before hand reioyce at the destruction of our enemies, whom we should loue, and for whom we should pray, euen when they persecute vs, as he taught vs by his owne example in praying, Luke. 22. 
               Father forgiue them, they know not what they doe; and inspired Steuen with the same minde to say at the time, when they stoned him, Acts. 7. 
               Lord lay not this sinne to their charge. So that your exceptions are rather preiudiciall to your owne positions, then to mine, which are no way weakned with these pretences, but rather strengthned.

               Christs expresse compassion towards the Iewes (Luk. 19. Matth. 24.) a litle before he prepared him to his passion, plainly sheweth that now in the Garden and so still forward, he gaue him selfe wholy to other thoughts and matters, namely such as concerned his great worke in hand.] Out of your learning you allow Christs compassion towards the walles and buildings of the temple, and the stones of the cittie, for he sheweth in both places, which you cite, that a 
               Matth. 24. 2. 
               Luc. 19 44. 
               stone shall not be left vppon a stone, either in the Matth. 24. 2. Temple or Luc. 19 44. Citty, which concerned the Iewes temporall state and safety; but touching the reiection of that whole nation for these fifteene hundred yeares (as we find to this day) fromChrist sorrowed that his death should be the ruine of the Iewes. the knowledge and grace of God, whereby their soules might be saued, which Christ most clearely foresaw would befall them for their putting him to death so barbarously, tumultuously, and contemptuously, that in the higth of your skill, you count not a matter worthy Christs cogitation or compassion. Such chipps you hew to helpe vp the building of your new made hell, that the Sauiour of the world vpon your word must be mindfull of the walles and houses in which the Iewes dwelt, and forgetfull of their Saluation, of whom, and for whom he was borne, and to whom he was first sent, if they would haue receaued him: as if the sonne of God knew not how to proportion his sorow for them according to the dangers, that were imminent ouer them. But in all wise mens eies, if he so much pittied the ruine of their citie and desolation of their Land, that he wept for it, what sorow and griefe shall we think he inwardly tooke to see the perpetuall destruction of so many thousands, and all their posterities so many hundred yeares through their owne madnes in thirsting for his bloud? and why should this be excluded from the greate worke of mans Redemption, which he had then in hand, when he was in his agonie, since not only the future paines were foreseene by him, but all things incident and consequent were plainly to him foreknowen; Amongst which was the vtter abandoning of Gods former people for their infidelitie to the doctrine, and for their crueltie to the person of their and our Lord and Sauiour.
            
               Defenc. pag. 95. li. 7. 
               A litle before when he throughly intended and expressed his affection touching that matter, yet thereby he fell into no such agonie, but onelie wept and mourned for them.] Christ knew his times and places for all his affections and actions farre better then such a guest, as you are, could direct him. His affections before men he did moderate with all sobrietie and grauitie, they neuer saw in his face nor heard from his mouth an vndecent gesture or speech. For his vehement and most feruent affections, (which yet proceeded from no kind of impatience nor distemper of mind, as you imagine, but

from the fire and flame of his most sacred humilitie, and zeale to God, and loue and pietie to man) he chose the time neerest his passion, and the place secret not only from others, but euen, from his owne Disciples. Had the people openly seene him in these feares praiers and sweats they would haue iudged him either Mar. 3. v. 21. 
               madd, or Iohn 7. 
               possessed with a diuell, as they did, when no signes of a troubled mind appeared. Christ therefore in his heauenly wisedome would haue no witnesses of his most feruent affections, as it seemeth by the course of the Scriptures, but God and his elect Angels, in somuch that he willed the rest of his disciples to sitt where he appointed them, and tooke Peter, Iames, and Iohn, that had seen his glorie in the mountaine, and went on-ward with them to his purposed place, but left them a stones cast of, when he went to his passionate praiers: where for the darknesse of the night they could distinguish nothing; besides their incredible heauinesse to sleepe whiles their master was in his greatest agonie, which prooueth they neither heard, nor saw what befell him. How childishly then do you reason; Christ, when he spake of the destruction of the citie, fell not into an agonie before the people: therefore the griefe of their reiection could be no part of the sorow, which he assumed in the Garden. As this is most friuolous, so the rest is most captious. For what if his sorow for the Iewes were not the cause of his bloudie sweate; or of that part of his piaier, Father if it be possible, let this cup passe from me? Is that a reason, this was not respected by Christ at that time, because he hadThe different affections in Christes agony had different causes. diuers other assaults and seas of sorow, touching himselfe, and others, as well as touching the Iewes? what hobling is this, to aske one entire cause for so many different affections and actions, as Christ shewed in his agonie; where the Scriptures note not only feare and sorow on euery side, but extreame humilitie, and ardent zeale with such feruencie of spirit in praier, that the sweat brake from him like droppes of bloud? who, that sought trueth, or reade but the words of the Euangelists, would thus cauill with matters of such moment? Christ was in these passions and praiers by the space of an houre (for so himselfe said to Peter, Matth. 26. 
               What could ye not watch with me one houre and he praied 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                
               more intentiuely or more feruently after he was strengthned by an Angell, then before. Shall we thinke he said nothing all that while in his praiers, but only these words O my father if it be possible, let this cupe passe from me? This he repeated thrise, as the Scripture obserueth, but his praiers were longer, and extended to other things, except we thinke Christ was an houre repeating three lines. Besides the Scriptures note a change in his praiers. For after the Angel from heauen appeared to him, and strengthened him, Luc. 22. 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , then entering into an agonie, he praied more earnestly, than before, so that his sweat trickled downe to the ground like droppes of bloud. You say there must be one entire cause of all these passions. So you say, but which way doe you, or can you goe about to prooue it, saue by the liquor of your owne lips, which is weaker then water to glew these things together.

               The worke of Christ at this time wrought by him is by a proper and peculiar name iustly called his passion, not his compassion. Which I would haue you to note.] A man may soon note the worthinesse of your arguments, that when neither by truth nor reason you can preuaile you fall to collude with the names of passion and compassion. As if Christes passion did not sometimes import the whole historie of his death and sufferings, wherein are confessions, reprehensions, predictions, praiers and promises of Christ, as well as paines endured. And did it note noe more but paines, are not the passions and affections of feare and sorow, as painfull many times to the soule, as the stripes and wounds of the bodie? Such trifles you take for triple engins, when your conceits must be concluded; all other mens arguments haue no shape of any reason with you; so deepely you are in loue with your selfe and your owne inuentions, be they neuer so ill-fauoured or mishapen.
            
               Defenc. pag. 96. li. 2. 
               Lastly those holymen (it seemeth) hauing their thoughts wholly defixed on their vehement pittie towards the Iewes, earnestly and constantly wished that the cuppe of Gods eternall wrath might come vpon themselues, that the Iewes who deserued it, might scape. But Christ in his passion contrariewise desired that cuppe, which he tasted to be to bitter, and to violent

for him, might passe away from himselfe.] If your suppositions of Moses and Paule were graunted you, which yet are no way true, they make the stronger against you, though you dissemble the sight thereof. For if pittie towards the Iewes so farre preuailed with those two being the seruants of Christ, that they yeelded their soules to eternall torments, as you imagine, to saue their Brethren; how great reason then hath it, that the Messias himselfe, in whom was the fullnesse of all mercie, might be mooued with such inward compassion for that whole nation, that he most earnestly and frequently praied in the Garden to haue this cuppe (that is, this maner of death, whereby the Iewes should perish) to passe from him, as Origen, Ierom, Ambrose and Bede expound those wordes? and though your hellish humour be so hoat, and so haughtie, that you pronounce of euerie thing, there is no semblance of reason in this; yet the considerate Reader will find in those mens iudgments, whom I haue named and produced, more sap and pith then in your hell paines. For seeing the affection of mercy hath beene so mightie in men, that they were more then perplexed with this griefe, what bring you but babling to shew that Christ might not feruently pray, if so it pleased God, not to make his death the meane of their vtter ouerthrowe; and when he saw their pertinacie and infidelitie to be such, that his praier did not preuaile for them, to be troubled and agonized in mind for their wofull and willfull destruction? Christ praid for himselfe, not for them.] But these learned Fathers tell you, he praied not against his owne death simply, but respecting them, by whose hands it should come, and whose eternall ruine it should be. Your cup of hell paines, which you dreame Christ then tasted to be too bitter and too violent for him, is a false and fond conceit of yours, hauing neither trueth, sense, nor likelihood in it, and yet forsooth both Scriptures and fathers must giue place to your deuices, and semblances. This I speake, if your assertion of Moses and Paul were admitted; howbeit indeed you are not able to prooue one word of all that you affirme in this case. You take certaine verie obscure and much questioned words of Moses and Paul for your ground-worke, and at your pleasure without all proofe you build thereon a whole world of falshood and confusion. Out of which, and the like darke and doubtfull places because the most of your hellish doctrine is drawen, I thinke it needfull to let the Reader see, how far and what those wordes inferre, which you so much striue to abuse.
            When the children of Israel had made them a Calfe of golde, and feasted and plaiedMoses prayer for the people examined. before it, as the God that brought them out of Egypt, the Lord was wroth and said to Moses; Deuter. 9. v. 13. 
               I haue seene this people, and beholde it is a stifnecked people; 
               14. 
               let me alone, that I may destroy them, and put out their name from vnder heauen, and I will make of thee a mightie nation, and greater than they be. For this sinne, when Moses prayed that the whole nation might not be destroyed, he sayd to God; Exod. 32. v. 31. 
               This people hath sinned a great sinne. 
               32. 
               And now if thou wilt take away their sinne: and if not, wipe me out of the Booke which thou hast written. To whom God answered; Vers 33. 
               Whosoeuer hath sinned against me, I will put him out of my booke. The first thing here to be considered is, what God threatened to the people, and promised to Moses; the next, what Moses did, or could desire for them. God did not threaten presently to execute damnation on all the people, there were many thousand children amongst them, that knew not what idolatrie meant, but he would temporally destroy that whole nation, and raise Moses to a greater number than they were. Neither may we thinke, that God then would make a new number of predestinate, and assure the kingdome of heauen to all Moses ofspring without reiecting of any one of them, but that he would giue the land of Canaan, whereof he spake to their fathers, vnto Moses and his posteritie. Against this, Moses pleadeth two things vnto God; HIS GLORIE, lest the Egyptians should blaspheme, and say, Exod. 32. v. 12. 
               he brought them out in malice to slay them in the mountaines, and to consume them from the face of the earth: and HIS PROMISE, when he Vers. 13. sware by himselfe to Abraham, Isaac and Iacob, to multiplie their seed as the starres of heauen, and to giue them all the land (of Canaan) to inherit for euer. So that Moses intreateth God to regard his owne glorie and trueth, and not in that sort to reuenge the peoples sinnes,

by rooting them and their seed from the earth. And touching Gods offer vnto him, he so farre preferred his care of Gods glorie and mercie towards the Israelites, before his owne dignitie safetie, and posteritie, that he desired God, if the people were destroied from the earth, to rase out him also and his posteritie, that he might not see the ruine of his nation, and heare the reproch of Gods name. Moses doth not meddle in this place with Gods eternall and secret predestination, which he knew was immutable, and wherof the Egyptians neither had, neither could haue any knowledge; and therefore so to conceiue Moses words, as if God should euerlastingly damne him, if he presently damned the people, is a construction full of presumption and impietie. Moses did not say, So thou wilt spare them, condemne me; but if thou wilt not forbeare them, destroy me (and mine) also. Wherein you may make Moses so madde, (which God forbid) that he would goe to the diuell for companie; but you can not shew by his words, that he desired his euerlasting damnation might be their eternall saluation. Moses was too well learned in Gods mysteries, to thinke that he could be the Sauiour of that people, or that his soule was a meet price for their redemption; he refuseth all his personall honour, which was great in Gods sight, his present life, and future hope for all his ofspring in the land of Promise, rather than he would see the destruction of that whole multitude committed to his charge. This I take to be the true meaning of Moses words, and the booke there, of which he speaketh, to be Gods 
                  〈◊〉
                decree, to haue him (during their abode in the desert) to be the leader and

            The words of Paul, Rom. 9. v. 3. 
               I did (or could) wish my selfe separated from Christ for my brethren according to the flesh, somewhat differ from the words of Moses, and may receiuePauls wish for the Iewes considered. euen by Grammar a double sense; the first actuall and absolute, the second potentiall or conditionall.

               Optabam, inquit, non opto. I did, I doe not wish it. Against this exposition can nothing be brought, that is not easily answered. Paul taketh Christ and the Holie Ghost as witnesses to his owne conscience, that his heauinesse was great, and the griefe of his heart continuall for his brethren the Iewes, in regard of the good which he wished them in Christ, and his desire to haue them saued. And how farre this zeale and affection for his people did carie him before to runne headlong against Christ, and to do his vttermost to be a cast-away from Christ for their sakes, themselues did discerne by his sharpe and eager persute of Christes Church. He therefore euer was, and yet is a zealous well-willer to his owne Nation, though he were now called to be the Teacher of the Gentils.
            Those that referre this speech to the time when Paul wrote to the Romans, must first haue leaue to supply the text with a Potentiall particle in Greeke called

                to make the difference betwixt the Indicatiue and Optatiue Moods. For when a man sayth he could or would wish this or that, he meaneth, If there were not

some stoppes to hinder his desire. And so the Apostles words, if they be, Potentiall, they import some necessarie respects, that stayed him from actuall 
                  〈◊〉
                so much. They then which would haue the Apostle to speake Optatiuely; I could wish my selfe to be seuered from Christ for my brethren; doe vnderstand; so as it were pleasing to God, possible for me, and profitable to them. For no man of any sense or iudgement doth hence conclude as this Defender doth, that it was possible; Paul was too great a Diuine to thinke, that Gods eternall counsell and election could be changed for any mans priuate desires or wishes; but he declared, as they suppose, how willing he was to renounce all the honour, hope, and happinesse, that Christ had called him vnto, so it might be for Gods glorie, and their good that were his kinsmen after the flesh. What is meant by separation from Christ, and whether Paul wished an euerlasting deprination of all blisse or no, the best Interpreters do not agree. Nicolaus Hemmingius a learned professor of true religion, commenting vpon Pauls Epistles, sayth: Hemmingius in ca. 9. ep. ad Rom. 
               What shall we say of this affection in Paul? Hoc

                   perire in carne, vt saluentur alij in spiritu. Let vs holde this for a maine principle, that Paul wished no absurd, no wicked thing, nothing against the saluation of his owne soule, nor against the loue of Christ: for Paul was (in this) guided with the spirit of Christ. This foundation lying fast, we must necessarily vnderstand this separa

                  ion from Christ (which Paul wished) not of any internall or eternall separation from Christ, but only of an externall and temporall, whereby he wisheth to perish in the flesh, that others might be saued in the spirit. This is another of Ieroms Expositions in his questions to Algasia: Hieron. ad Algasiam. quaest. 9. 
               Wee shall finde the same affection in Moses and Paul towards the flocke committed vnto them. A good shepheard layeth downe his life for his sheepe, which is all one with this (of Paul) I wished to be separate from Christ; and with that (of Moses) Wipe mee out of the booke which thou hast written. And withall see how great the Apostles loue was to Christ, that he desired to die for Christ, and to perish alone, so all sorts of men might beleeue in him. Perire autem non in perpetuum sed imprasentiarum. Perish Paul would not euer lastingly, but for this present life. He would therefore perish in the flesh, that others might be saued in the spirit; and lose his owne bloud to preserue their soules. Haymo likewise; Haymo in 9. ca. ad Rom. 
               Hoc loquebatur de occisione corporis sui, cùm nullo modo optaret mentis affectu separaria Christo. This (Paul) spake of the killing of his bodie, when by no meanes he wished the affection of his minde to be seuered from Christ.

Paul doth not say, he would be made a separate from Christ, that is, now to be diuided from Christ, (that were most detestable) but (he could wish) to haue beene (still) a separate from Christ, that is, as yet to haue continued an alien, and not to that present time to haue cleaned vnto Christ. In effect Paul sayth, I would haue wished mine owne selfe not yet to haue come to Christ, but to

               desireth himselfe for (his kinsmen) the Iewes to be anathema from Christ, that is, for a time to be a stranger from Christ, that in the meane while his nation might haue place in Christ, and himselfe at last be saued (with them.) The words may likewise be taken for an imperfect speech, as though he had sayd; I could wish this, if it were lawfull for me (salua pietate) by the rules of pietie; I would doe it for Christes glory, who could not want meanes to restore me againe from this (anathema or) curse.
            
            Chrysostoms exposition best pleaseth Peter Martyr and Zanchius, as if Paul had beene content for Christs glory and the Saluation of the Iewes, not to haue beene seuered from the loue and fauour of Christ, but if it were possible thereby to do

them good, from the blisse and happinesse, that Christ would bestow on him. Howbeit they both make it simply impossible, and that euen to Pauls knowledge, that this should, or could be. Peter Martyr in 9. cap. Epist. ad Romanos. 
               Neque mirari debemus Paulum hoc optasse, cum non posset fieri, (illum enim dubium non est ad praedestinatos pertinuisse) voluntas enim nostra saepe rapitur ad ea quae sieri non possunt. Neither ought we to maruaile, (saith Peter Martyr) that Paul wished that which could not be: (for he no doubt was of the number of the Elect) since our will is often caried to things impossible.

               In the word Anathema, (separated from Christ) I consider (saith Zanchius) two very diuerse and distinct things, towitte, separation from the loue (and fauour) of Christ, and priuation from the fruite of Christs loue, which fruite is blessednesse it selfe, or a blessed and euerlasting life in heauen with Christ. That Paul wished to be seuered from Christ, meaning, from the loue and fauour of Christ, and to become execrable vnto Christ for the safetie of his bretheren, Dari nullo modo potest, aut debet, this in no wise may, or ought to be graunted. For this is repugnant to that, which he said before in the ende of the eight Chapter, yea to the Principall cause, which led him to his desire. The ground whereof was not so much his affection to his bretheren, as his loue chiefly to Christ. And comparing Moses words and wish with Pauls, he saith. Ibidem. 
               I doe not doubt, but as Paul did no way desire to be seuered from Christ, that is, from his communion and fauour: so Moses by no meanes did aske, that God would rather strike him out of the number of his friends, then destroy the people. Neque enim hoc potuit salua pietate expetere, aut petere, for neither could he desire, nor aske this with any pietie; but as Paul wished him selfe alone rather, if it were possible, to be depriu

                  d of eternall happinesse, then all the Israelites to be reiected from grace, and thereby the name of Christ and glory of God to be endangered by blasphemous minds and mouthes. Ibidem. 
               Neither is it any impediment, which is opposed touching the immutabilitie of Gods election and his Iustice, against which Moses seemeth to tend, when he desireth that God would destroy him being an Innocent, and ordained to saluation. For Moses Prayer is to be vnderstoode with this Condition, if it be possible, and yet he knew, it was not possible.
            
            There is a fift Exposition of this place, which thinketh that Paul led with a feruentThis exposition may not simply be receiued. loue and zeale to haue the Iewes partakers of Christ, did not remember or respect either the Counsell or Iustice of God to be immutable, which yet are, but brake forth into a vehement affection, as desiring to exchange his eternall damnation for their Saluation. These leaue out all manner of Conditions, not because there were not many, and must be many, before the wish can be religious and pleasing to God, but for that the Apostle wholy defixed on his care for the Iewes, did not in that Passion consider the rest. But by their leaues, that are the leaders to this exposition, well this may be conceaued of some short and suddaine motion rising from mans infirmitie; but this can neuer be imagined of the Apostle aduisedly and iudicially writing to the Romans, and weighing all his words with the wisedome of Gods spirit, which if they take from the Apostle in that part of this Epistle, where he calleth Christ and the holy Ghost to witnesse, that he speaketh the truth, I see not why they may not derogate all Authoritie from the rest of his writings, when after so great deliberation, and vehement protestation they make him forget the chiefest grounds of Christian Religion earnestly vrged by himselfe in the selfe same Epistle, and euen in the next wordes before, written in the later ende of the eight Chapter. It is therefore a dangerous position to say, the Apostle was amazed or astonished in his writings, or so caried away with his affections, that he knew not what he wrote in those Scriptures, which are Canonicall. For it openeth a gap to all impieties and heresies, to thinke that Paul led with Christs spirit, did not remember nor respect, that Gods eternall election could not be changed, nor the chosen vessels of Christ be euerlastingly condemned for the loue and zeale, which they bare to Christ, nor any man or Angell admitted to be the Redeemer and deliuerer of the Reprobate from the iust and deserued wrath of God prouided for them. All which pestilent errors are consequent to this supposition, that the Apostles speech was absolutely without condition; and must be graunted to be possible,

before his desire or wish could simply take place. It is therefore resolued euen by them who first deuised this exposition, that Pauls wish in this place was wholy impossible, as well in respect of God, who would not change his eternall counsels and decrees; as of the Apostle, who being a chosen vessell could not perish; and likewise of the Iewes, whose deserued destruction so often denounced by our Sauiour, as where he said, Matth. 21. 
               The kingdome of God shall be taken from you, and to Ierusalem, Luke 19. 
               They shall not leaue in thee a stone vpon a stone, because thou knewest not the day of thy visitation, and many such threats; could not be auerted. Only this Defender to shew his discretion, out of these darke places, which admit many senses, collecteth that to be possible; which by the verdict of the holy Scriptures and of all Interpreters new and old is auouched to be simply impossible; and thence he maketh his notable obseruations, which indeede are nothing else but grosse and palpable errors.
            
               Defenc. pag. 96. li. 25. 
               From thence I obserue foure notable points. First, That if God omnipotent, and onely soueraigne Lord will, he may inflict damnation and the paines of hell vpon meere men, not for themselues, but for others, nor for their owne sinnes, but for the imputed sinnes of other men: much rather then might he doe this to Christ, whom God sent indeede and ordained for that purpose. Flatly contrarie to your Assertion.] To make your ObseruationNote. the nearer to the patterne, which you follow, you must say, that God, if he will, may inflict eternall damnation (for temporall damnation to hell the Scripture knoweth none,) on his elect, (so were Moses and Paul;) for their loue to Christ and theirFoure notable errors falsely grounded on the facts of Moses & Paul whereof 
                     〈◊〉
                   the first. bretheren, for that was the cause of their wish. And then you haue made a worthy Corollarie, that indeede contrarieth my Assertion, and not mine onely, but also the expresse words of the holy Ghost, the maine grounds of the Christian Faith, and the resolution of all writers first and last, that haue spoken of these places. To Moses Petition Gods answere was, that he would not wipe an Innocent out of his booke, but, Exod. 32. verse 33. 
               Whosoeuer hath sinned against me, said God, I will put him out of my booke. So that God himselfe did not onely refuse Moses Prayer in that part, but declared it to be repugnant to his Iustice to condemne the guiltlesse with the guiltie. The Apostle, the next words before these, by which you would make it possible that he might perish for others, professed; that Rom. 8. v. 38. 
               neither death, nor life, nor Angels, nor things present, nor things to come, nor heigth, nor deapth, nor any other creature was able to separate him from the loue of God in Christ. And therefore generally demandeth, Ibid. v. 35. 
               Who shall separate vs from the loue of Christ? No creature is able, as he exactly auoucheth; and as for the Creator, Verse. 33. 
               It is God that iustifieth, (and therefore cannot be contrarie to himselfe) Verse. 34. 
               who shall condemne, where God in Christ doth acquite? [God you thinke may change his mind.] His eternall counsell decreed, reuealed, and assured in Christ, God neither will correct, because he is wise, and before all worlds foresaw all that might mooue him to the contrarie, neither can alter, because he is truth, and so can neither repent, nor change, as men doe. The Rom. 11. 
               Gifts and calling of God are without repentance. 
               2. Tim. 2. 
               The foundation of God standeth sure, and hath this seale, the Lord knoweth who are his.

               With him is no varying nor turning; And therefore our Sauiour excepteth it as a thing not possible, that the elect should perish, when he saith; that false Prophets and great wonders in the later daies should deceaue, 
               Matth. 24. 
               If that were possible, the very Elect.
            
            By his power, you will say, God may doe it, though he will not.] Gods power was most absolute ouer all creatures to dispose them at his pleasure, before he determined and setled his will in Christ Iesus, what to doe with them; since which the holy Ghost teacheth vs in plaine words, it is impossible that God should lie, hauing made his promise to all his elect in Christ, and bound it with an Othe; not because he is become weaker then he was, but because he hath fastned his counsell, and reuealed his truth in his Sonne, which he neither will, nor can change; not for want of power, but because of his truth, which is constant and immutable. Heb. 6. v. 17. 18. 
               God willing (saith the Apostle) more abundantly to shew the stablenesse of his counsell, bound himselfe with an othe, that by two immutable things (his promise and his othe) wherein it

is impossible that God should lie, we might haue strong comfort. So that howsoeuer you in your irreligious sophistrie doe say, God Omnipotent may inflict damnation vpon men for others, If you meane vpon his Elect, such as Moses and Paul were, whose examples and words you would seeme to follow, you defend an open and exact Impossibilitie
               Note. and heresie; speaking of damnation as the Scriptures doe, and as you doe in this place, where you say, those holy men (Moses and Paul) Defenc. pag. 96. li. 5. 
               Earnestly and constantly wished Gods eternall wrath might come vpon themselues, that the Iewes might scape it. Will you flie from the elect to the reprobate, and say that God may inflict damnation on them for other mens sinnes? Then are you cleane gone from your examples of Moses and Paul, for they were no reprobates; and as farre from all regard of Gods Iustice, who eternally condemneth no man but for sinne permanent and inherent, as in all the reprobate? For though God doe saue without merite for his mercies sake, yet he condemneth no man eternally but for sinne; and that either committed, or inherited. Genes. 18. 
               Be it farre from thee (saith Abraham to God) to slay the righteous with the wicked, and that the righteous should be euen as the wicked, be it farre from thee. Shall not the Iudge of the world doe iudgement?
            
            If it be simply impossible for Gods elect to perish, as our Sauiour witnesseth, what hainous and horrrible falsitie and impietie is it to say, The Sonne of God might be damned for sinners? And though you shift sides and say, Defenc pag. 96. li. 29.

                   God doe this to Christ, yet if you hold either to your former examples, whence you deduce this; or to your words in this very sentence, whence you draw this comparison, you must say, much rather then may God inflict damnation and his eternall wrath on Christ; which whether it may not rightly be called one of your hellish mysteries, I leaue to all Christian men to iudge. Such wicked obseruations when you make from so weake and false foundations, the Reader may soone see, what a notable Diuine you are, and how likely to teach the truth, that pretend Gods power against his will for the vtter ruine os all Religion. Christ you say was ordained for that purpose.]Christ was not ordained to be damned for vs. What to be damned for others, or rather to beare the chastisment of our peace, that we might be healed with his stripes? The Prophet Esay saith he was wounded for our transgressions, and bruized for our iniquities. But you are the first supplanter of all Patriarkes and Prophets, that say Christ was damned for our sinnes. You will come in with your temporall and substantiall damnation, to which you subiect the Soule of Christ: But Sir if you beleeue and teach the same truth, which the holy Ghost doth in the word of God; Why swarue you so much from the words and grounds of the Sacred Scriptures? Why doth nothing please you in mans Redemption but hell and damnation inflicted on Christ, where you neuer learned any such lesson out of the Prophets or Apostles? And here your abused and vnaduised examples, which you pretend for this purpose, import no such thing, but rather the cleane contrarie. For if it were not possible for Moses and Paul euerlastingly to perish, because they were elected in Christ; how infinitely more impossible was it, that Christ should perish, in whom all are elected? And how Christ could perish but either by the dissolution of his person, or else by the ioynt condemnation of the second person in the most glorious Trinitie to the fire of hell, I doe not see; since these are such blasphemies, as hell neuer hatched the like.

                  st.] The wordes which I cited, are sufficient to reprooue the first of your foure notable obseruations as starke false. For there God sweareth by himselfe, that the 
               Ezech. 18. 
               Soule which sinneth that shall die: and consequently, the Sonne shall not beare the iniquitie of the Father, neither shall the Father beare the iniquitie of the Sonne; much lesse shall Moses and Paul beare the iniquitie of the whole people, as you dreame they might. And so much Gods answere to Moses importeth; Exod. 32. 
               whosoeuer hath sinned against me, I will wipe him, (and none other) out of my Booke. As for Christ, since he was God as well as man, his person could not be tied to the Lawes and Rules appointed

for men, but what he himselfe would admit in his owne person, to that by willing obedience he submitted himselfe; namely in his Manhood to die the death of the Crosse for our sinnes according to the Scriptures, but not to be damned for vs, nor to die the death of the Soule mentioned in the Scriptures; to whose Doctrine we must stand, and not to your deuices, when we speake of Gods iudgements against sinne, or of the purgation of our Soules. Wherefore that God himselfe by his owne body would be the Price of our Redemption, was indeed a thing proper and singular to the person of Christ, wherein neither Moses nor Paul could be partakers with him, or examples of him: and therefore your fitting their prayers to his Passion, to make your hel paines thereby possible, is a thing far fet, & no way pertinent to this purpose.
            
               Defenc. pag. 96. li 22. 
               I take it plaine enough that these sinned not in their desire, and I suppose you take it so too, in that you alleadge them, and ground your Reasons of comparison vpon them.] They sinned not, because their desires were conditionall & submitted to Gods good pleasure with reseruation of their dueties; otherwise if they thought that possible, which they desired, as you doe, by their destruction, (who were the chosen vessels of mercie) to excuse the reprobate from damnation deserued by obstinacie and infidelitie, they not only erred from the truth, but sinned in praying to haue their wils take place before and against the will of God. But Moses in loue to Gods glory, and care for his charge, desired to be partaker of such temporall vengeance, as should befall the whole people of God; and Pauls words, that are potentiall, must be conditionall; otherwise he needed not to haue said, I could wish, but I doe wish. The which because he doth not, but onely shew his desire, were it possible and pleasing to God, therefore he may be well excused from sinne, though you condemne this in him, and that in Moses as a Defenc. pag. 95. li. 33. 
               Distemper. Touching my alleadging their griefe for Gods people, I doe not vse to venture on such desperate conclusions as you doe. To my purpose it was sufficient, that they both were Rom. 9. 
               grieued at hart with great and continuall heauinesse for their Nation, which are the vndoubted and vnquestioned words of Paul, and causes of Moses Prayer: farder I did not goe, but from that care and sorrow of theirs, I obserued it both lawfull and likely for the Messias, as he was man, to be inwardly and deepely troubled in his affection with the present and perpetuall ruine of that people for his death by taking his bloud vpon them and their children. And this standeth sound and good, whatsoeuer become of your newe and notable collections, which shew your small Iudgement, and lesse truth in points of Diuinitie.

               Secondly, we see here that there may be possibly a death of the Soule, a curse, and separation from God, which is in it selfe neither siane, nor conioyned with sinne necessarily: but meerely a suffering of punishment from God for the sinnes of others imputed. Contrarie to you also pag. 73. & 310. yea generally euery where.] You remember belike the olde rule, Ex impossibili sequitur quodlibet, from an impossibilitie supposed any thing will

               follow: and seeing your selfe destitute of all proofes for your new Doctrine, you will needs make lotteries of impossibilities, and thence draw what you like best. For taking a plaine impossibilitie for your maine ground, you thereupon frame vs foure obseruations as impossible, as the first supposition. And this absurd wandring from all truth and faith you would haue the Reader Note, as a speciall demonstration of your discretion and vnderstanding in matters of Religion. Suppose as you doe, that God through his omnipotent power may turne heauen into hell, and reuerse all that he hath decreed and prouided for the different rewards of pietie and impiety, and you may soone prooue what falsitie you will by flying from Gods counsell and truth to his power and might: But Christian religion teacheth not whatsoeuer is possible to Gods power, but what is ordained by his will, and reuealed by his word. Otherwise what heresie can you name touching Gods works in his creation or redemption of the world, that defendeth impossibilities to Gods power, setting aside all respect of his will and truth? This therefore is the high way to vphold all falsities and impieties, to oppose Gods power against his will and word, and to beleeue he hath done, whatsoeuer his almightie power is able to doe.
            
            Concerning the death of the Soule, though here be no place to speake largely of it▪ it is double by the confession of all Diuines, and euen of the Scriptures themselues. For as the places are diuerse, where men doe abide, here and else where, in this life and the next; so the life, which the Soule enioyeth, is proportioned to the place, where she continueth; God in his wisdome and goodnesse hauing so prouided, that whiles she gouerneth the body here on earth, she should be partaker of him by the grace of his spirit, and hereafter in the kingdome of heauen she should haue the full fruition of him by the manifest reuelation and communion of his glorie. Likewise the death of the Soule preuaileth in this life by sinne, which is the naturall depriuing, or voluntarie renouncing of all grace, and in the world to come by damnation, which is the iust reiecting of all the wicked from any fellowship with God in his glorie, and the fastning them to euerlasting torments in hell fire. Gods actions in either of which are most iust and holy; for he withdraweth and denieth his grace, when it is refused; and excludeth them from all accesse to his blessednesse, that heere on earth despised both him and it, adiudging them to the iust desert of their sinnes in euerlasting flames: But neither of these can possibly take hold of man without sinne committed, or inherited. And therefore your imagining a death of the Soule without sinne, is a supposing of things impossible, since neither Moses Prayer nor Pauls wish in that sense, which you follow, were possible, as all Diuines both new and old confesse.

               Thirdly that extraordinarily there is greater loue among meere men, then only to die bodily one for another, though vsually and ordinarily a greater cannot be found among men: which is it that Christ meaneth: but how much more then may the loue of Christ toward his elect be farre greater: contrarie to your assertion pag: 107. 108.] Your doctrine is all extraordinarie,The Defend

               No man hath greater loue, then to lay downe his life for his friend. That is ordinarily true, you say but extraordinarily false. Then extraordinarily by your supposition Christ sometimes speaketh an vntrueth, though it be not ordinarie with him so to doe: which honor you yeeld to the rest of the Scriptures. For when you can not otherwise auoid them; those, you answeare, are the Defenc. pag. 96. li. 32. 
               ordinarie and common rules of the Scripture; But your doctrine consisteth of extraordinarie Rules, which are no where found but in your owne braine. You haue heard Chrysostome, Photius, and Zanchius auouch (who are the chiefe commenders of the exposition, which you would seeme to follow) that Paul neither did, nor might preferre the loue of his Countriemen before his owne saluation, and communion with Christ; but that his principall respect in this wish was his loue to the glorie of Christ, which he more esteemed then his owne soule. So that nothing did hinder Paul to preferre Gods glory before the safety of his owne soule, and yet Christes rule to stand true, that no man hath greater loue, then to lay downe his life for his friend. Neither was it the death of the Soule that Paul wished, since he would by no meanes, as these old and new writers obserue, be seuered from the loue and fauour of Christ, but from the ioy and honour that is laid vp for the saints of God. Peter Martyr is of the same opinion with them. Pet. Martyr in ca. 9. epist. ad Romanos. 
               Neither doth Paul in this place say, he wished to be separated from the loue of God, (nullo enim modo voluisset ab illo amando desistere: for by no meanes would Paul haue ceased from louing God) only he wisheth to be excluded from the blessednesse and fruition of God. And this euerie one of vs ought to be willing vnto, euen lesse to regard his owne (eternall) happinesse then the glorie of God. Now he that still loueth god, and is beloued of him, by no meanes can suffer the death or curse of the soule mentioned in the Scriptures. 1. Cor. 16. 
               if any man loue not the Lord Iesus Christ, let him be Anathema maranAtha, that is accursed in the highest degree. then could not the same curse befall him, that loued Christ dearer then his owne soule; but the words of our Sauiour must needes be verified in him, Ma

               he that looseth his soule for my sake, shall find (or saue) it.
            
            So that neither of your suppositions are true, either that Paul preferred the loue of men before the safety of his owne soule, or that for their sakes he was content to die the death of the soule mentioned in the Scriptures, which is a separation as well from the loue and trueth of God, as from the glorie and felicitie of God. And your comparison, for which you intend all this, and wherewith you would crosse my assertion, is most vntrue, that Christes loue to his elect led him to die the death of the soule, or to forgoe the fauour and fellowship of God for their sakes. For the coniunction of Christs manhoode to his Godhead, being personall, was farre greater and nearer then the knitting of Paul or Moses vnto God; and if that vnion were broken, all the workes and sufferings of Christs manhoode were no way able to bring vs to God.Christ could not be content to be separated from God for vs. Wherefore it were a thing extreamly impious in the manhood of Christ, and no lesse dangerous to our saluation, for him to be content to be vtterly seuered from the vnion and communion of the diuine nature, with which he was personally ioined; and though your imagination of Moses and Paul be false enough, and altogether impossible, yet to dreame the like of Christ, is the higth of all impietie. Neither doth that diminish his loue to vs, since there was no need thereof for vs, his other suffrings being sufficient in the iust and exact iudgement of God; and the loue, that led the second person in Trinitie to lay aside for the time the full and perfect fruition of his glorie, and equalitie with God his Father, and in our flesh to emptie and humble himselfe, not only to the infirmities of our nature, and miseries of our life, but euen to the shame and paine of our death on the Crosse, farre exceeded all the loues, that men or Angels could shew vnto vs. For there is more distance betweene the glorie and

Maiesty of God, and the sense and shame of our miserie and mortality, then betwixt the saluation or damnation of men or Angels. Wherefore Christs loue to vs may not be diminished, or made inferiour to the loue of creatures, though he were not damned for our sakes, since that ineuitablely and irreuocablely would haue fastned vs to a greater condemnation, and no way saued vs; whereas now his vnspeakable fellowship with God hath recalled vs all from the damnation due to vs, to be partakers of the loue and grace, that eternally and infinitely he possessed with God.

               Fourthly, we see here these holy men, without feeling any paines inflicted by Gods wrath, but only through an earnest and mighty compassion of loue had their minds drawen so wholy to thinke on this speciall thing aboue their reach, that during the time they turne not themselues to any other cogitation. 
               li. 17. 
               This you acknowledge may be in men, and yet you will not scoffe at them as cast into a Traunce by it, nor reproche them with infernall confusion. How much lesse ought you so to deale with Christ.] Your fourth obseruation is like the rest, that is, voide of all reason and trueth. For though you take vpon you to be bold with Moses and his praier, which yet you cannot shew li. 14. 
               was directly against his owne saluation, as you auouch; what proofe haue you that Paul aduisedly and considerately writing to theThe fourth errour pretended from the former examples. Romans, was amazed, and had no remembrance that Gods election was immutable, and certainly reserued for him and the rest of Gods chosen in the heauens? will you tell vs, that the Scriptures were written by men amazed, and forgetting the first principles of religion euen in their writings? you may do wel to make that your fift obseruation rightly matching your doctrine & deuotion: but I weene few wise men wil allow this or that audacious enterprise in you. I did in those words of mine which you bring, describe what astonishment by nature was; to wit, feare & admiration so mixed, that for the time both sense & speach are suddenly inter

                not or endureth not, neglecteth the sense or speach of her bodie, as regarding or attending greater things, that presently or fearefully oppresse her. What is this to Moses or Paul? if they were astonished with feare, then neither could they speake, nor write; how els they should be caried besides themselues, I doe not see, nor you doe not say. Moses had often accesse to god, and so feared not to speake, or pray vnto him; and at the first kindling of Gods wrath against the people, for making the Golden Calfe, Moses carefully and mindfully proposed in his Exod. 32. vers. 11. praiers to God both the reproch, which the 12. Aegyptians would breath forth against gods holie name, and the 13. oath made by God to Abraham Isaac and Iacob, to giue their seed the land of Canaan for an euerlasting inheritance. And the Scripture saieth that vppon that praier, before Moses went downe from the mount, Exod. 32. vers. 14. 
               The Lord changed his mind from the euill, which he threatned to doe vnto his people. Lesse cause then had Moses afterward to be amazed, hauing alreadie diuerted and pacified the brunt of Gods anger against the multitude, and praying now for the quite abolishing of this sinne, out of Gods remembrance, and the continuance of his fauour, and presence to goe before his people. Augustine thinketh Moses was well aduised in his praier, and knew Gods mercy to be such, that he would rather spare the wicked, then destroy the godly; of which goodnesse in God Abraham presumed, when he made request for Sodom. August. in Psal. 77. 
               God (sayth Austen) so spared that nation, that he kindled not his whole wrath vtterly to roote them out, and make an end of them, which appeareth plainly in Gods speach, and Moses praier for their sinnes; where God said, I will rase them (from the earth) and make thee a great people. But Moses interposeth himselfe, paratior deleri pro ipsis, quàm ipsos, readier to be cut off, than they should, 
                     〈◊〉
                   apud misericordem se id agere, qui quoniam nullo modo deleret ipsum, etiam illis ipsis parceret propter ipsum, knowing he should preuaile with him that was mercifull, who would by no meanes destroy him, but rather spare them for his sake. So that Moses by the iudgement of S. Augustine was not amazed in his prayer, as you falsly presume, but remembred himselfe well enough, and put his life into Gods hands, as more willing to be slaine, than the whole multitude should, and knowing that God would rather spare them in mercie, who were trespassers, than slay him, that was innocent.
            
            For Paul you haue lesse reason, since he doth not actually wish it, but sayeth, hee could wish it, if it were lawfull and possible; meaning, he could be content to put bodie and soule into Gods hands, to doe there with what pleased him, so the trueth of Christ might be receiued and acknowledged of the Iewes. His maner of speech, which must be conditionall, except you grant it to respect the time past, proueth that he was well aduised in referring all to Gods will, and reseruing as well Gods counsell, as his word reuealed, without touch or impeach. And therefore that the Apostle so writing was amazed, I see no ground, besides the gulfe of your owne inuentions. I am farre therefore from scof

               Specially you should acknowledge that his maruelous perplexity might well be a meanes, that his suddaine wishes against his owne constant purpose and Gods will were yet no sinnes.] That Christ might be somewhat astonished in the Garden, I doe not deme, because that was an affection incident to our nature, and specially for that the Scripture applieth the wordes, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , Mar. 14. 
               he began to be afraid and astonished, vnto him; but that this astonishment continued all the time of his passion, or of his praiers in the Garden, and that it proceeded from the sense of hell paines inflicted on him, these are your voluntarie fansies voide of all foundation in the word of God, and wholly depending on your priuate conceits. For were it an astonishment, as it was suddaine so it must be short; and though for the time it might suspend sense and memorie, yet when Christ began to pray, he resumed not only the power of speach, which in a maze men want, but of vnderstanding also, since praier without faith is a sinnefull temptation of God, and faith requireth as well knowledge, what we aske, as perswasion of Gods goodnesse, that he will graunt our desires. So that both the turning of Christs tongue to speake, and the directing of his hart in praier, doe prooue sufficiently, that Christ speedily recouered both sense & memorie, if we grant, he was on the suddaine somewhat astonished; the cause whereof you boldly conceaue to be what you list, as your maner is without any care to make proofe thereof. But as your obseruations were most absurd and false, so are your collections, that Christ by his paines (then felt and feared) had 
               Defenc. pag. 97. li. 23. 
               infinitly more cause to be in his mind amazed, then either Moses or Paul; since the Scriptures mention no paines then felt of him in his mind, besides the affections of feare and sorow, which though they be painfull to mans nature, yet differre they farre from the paines of the damned, to which you seeke in this place to fasten the soule of Christ.

               As for the Fathers which you cite, if they meane as they seeme to doe, that now at his passion among other causes of sorow there wanted not this, euen his great pittie towards his forlorne countriemen, then we ioine with them. If they meane, as you would haue them, that this was the maine and chiefe cause of his extreame sorow and amazednesse, therein Ivtterly leaue them.] You haue a long while in most lauish maner vntowardly pretended, that Defenc. pag. 94. li. 20. 
               Certainly Christ would haue greatly reioiced to see the due execution of Gods most holie and deserued iustice vpon the Iewes; and now with a suddaine retraite you ioine with Ambrose, Ierom, Augustine and Bede, that this among other causes of sorow wanted not in the Garden. Then as here you be more soberlie minded then before, or he at least that made this collection for you; so this often crossing your selfe, argueth that either you haue not yet recouered your witts, to vnderstand what you write, or that your helpers being in diuers places, and not seeing the one what the other wrote, you haue vnhandsomely patched their notes together without marking, wherein they contradicted each other. But this we take to be the nearest the trueth, since I doe not vrge this cause to exclude all others, which by any due circumstance of the Scriptures

might concurre to greeue him in the Garden; onely I noted that those learned and auncient fathers coniecturing the causes of Christs sorrow at that instant, neuer drempt of your hell paines, which you haue lately coyned out of the hollownesse of your owne hart; but obserued other causes, that might afflict his mind, which you in your Treatise reiected with great skorne, howsoeuer some of your friends haue since drawen you to be otherwise minded. As for your leaning them, it is little to the purpose, they will remaine wise and godly expositors, when such a blind guide as you are, will be lightly regarded withall your fantasticall Nouelties.
            
               Defenc. pag. 97. li. 31. 
               Howbeit this here note in the, that these Fathers auouch Christ feared not his (bodily) death or passion: for thereof only they speake here questionles. You contrariwise say that Christ feared (bodily) death, for thereof also you discourse, and had more cause as you thinke so to doe then any of his members. First then they questionlesse gainsay your new plot of mans redemption by the paines of hell. For they speak of the death, which Christ died for our sins accordingto the Scriptures, which if they tooke to be only bodily, as you graunt; they knew nothing neither of the death of the Soule, nor of the second death of the damned, which you auouch Christ must suffer, before he could redeeme vs; and so they, or you are cleane besides the Christian faith. Againe, they doe not simply say, he feared not death, for then should they crosse other fathers (and euen themselues) affirming, that Christ had a naturall feare of death, but the feare thereof was not the cause of this Agonie, that is, he feared it not so much, as to be thus afflicted at the remembrance of it. Otherwise Ambrose himselfe saith. Ambros. in Luc. li. 10. de tristitia & dolore Christi. 
               Debuit ergo Dolorem suscipere, vt vinceret tristitiam, non excluderet, & nos disceremus in Christo, quemadmodum futurae mortis mestitiam vinceremus. Christ was therefore to admit sorrow, that he might conquere it, not exclude it, and we in Christ might learne to ouercome the feare of death approching. So Cyrill. Cyril. The sauri li. 10 ca. 3.

For though as a man he abhorred death, yet as a man he refused not to performe the will of his Father, and of himselfe, being the word (or Sonne) of God. Morti ergo, quam vt homo formidabat, seipsum pro nobis vt Deus tradidit. To death then, which as a man he feared, he deliuered himselfe for vs as God. And Athanasius. Athana. Ora tio 4. contra Aria. 
               As by Death Christ abolished Death, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , and all humane miseries by suffering them as a man, so by vsuall feare he tooke away our feare, and made Men no longer to feare death. And Damascene.Damascen. orthodoxae fidei li. 3. ca. 18.

               . It is incident to the nature of man to feare death, for death entered besides (or against) Nature, and therefore nature flieth death.

                   consuming (or dispersing) it in him selfe, and making it obedient to the will of God. This your ignorance apprehendeth as a contradiction in them, but were you quietly minded, or better acquainted with their positions, and reasons, you would soone see, that these may stand together, that Christ might haue a naturall feare of death incident to man, and yet that feare not to be the whole cause of this agonie.

               Thirdly, touching his regard of his Church generally the same answere serueth, as it is giuen to the last point before.] You meane that among other causes of his sorrow this wanted not, which is as much as I auouched. And the more dearely he loued hisThe third cause concurring to Christs agonie. Disciples that followed him, and the whole Church, that should after beleeue in him, the more inwardly he might sorrow for their infirmities, and earnestly pray for their safeties, being no way ignorant of satans eger and watchfull malice against them. Since then after his resurrection and ascension he should in glory appeare to the face of God for them, what let was there, but he might now in the daies of his flesh, approching to his passion for their deliuerance, in most humble and ardent manner mediate aswell for their redemption as preseruation; and in this loue & zeale towards them, for whom he gaue himselfe, powre out both abundant teares, and bloudie sweats to shew the height of his desire and care to prouide and purchase their protection

and saluation? His supplications for vs were a necessarie part of our reconciliation to God, as well as his sufferings for vs; and the Prophet expressing the one, adioyneth the other as no lesse requisite then the former, in saying; Esa. 53. 
                  he bare the sinne of many, and prayed for the Trespassers. And no doubt he chose this place and time before his apprehension with inflamed and vehement affection of prayer to direct the course, and strengthen the force of all his sufferings, that receauing comfort and courage from aboue, he might wade through the worke of our redemption with greater assurance and confidence in the eyes of all his enemies, to whom he would shew neither feare nor sorrow, but silent and constant patience.

               If you vrge that these Fathers are so resolute for these causes, as their words pretend, then you your selfe abuse them more than euer I did or meane to doe, where you say, it is curiositie to examine, presumption to determine, impossibilitie to conclude, (as these doe) what was the true cause of Christes agonie.] A wise answere forsooth, and woorthy the vigor of your wit; to say their words are so resolute, that I condemne them more than you, when they with all inoderation temper their speech, and by the generalitie or diuersitie of occasions, that might engender feare to Christ in the Garden, shew they meane nothing lesse than to conclude any direct or particular cause of that agonie. Ambroses words are; Ambros. in Luc. lib. 10. de tristitia & dolore Christi. 
               Nec illud distat a vero. Neither is that dissonant from the trueth. And againe; Ambros. in Luc. lib. 10. de tristitia & dolore Christi. 
               Et fortasse ideo tristis est. And perhaps he was therefore sorowfull. And so Augustine; August. in Psal. 87. 
               Non incongruè nos dicere aestimo. I thinke we speake not without some reason. The rest admonish in generall, that Christ sorowed not for himselfe, but for vs. Doth this conclude any speciall and certaine cause of that agonie? But when you can not otherwise decline them, you thinke it enough to shift them off with such a iest as this is. Indeed they touch your free holde somewhat neerely, when they say, Christ sorowed not for any sufferings of his owne: this you impugne for life; and if their assertion in this be true, they turne your hell paines cleane out of Christes passion. For if Christ suffered, as you dreame, the death of the damned, he had good cause to feare and grieue at that which he felt; but with one consent Hilarie, Ambrose, Ierome, and Bede reiect that as false, that Christ did (thus) feare and grieue for any sufferings of his owne. Whether therefore you or I most abuse these Fathers, let the Reader iudge. And howsoeuer your helpers haue somewhat haltered your headlong humours, not long since, as I haue sormerly shewed, you flung off these Fathers in this very case as Trea. pa. 67.

I plainly professed in my Sermons, that since the Scriptures expressed no particular cause of Christes agonie in the Garden, it was impossible certainly to conclude any direct or determinate cause thereof. What follie then is it in you to suppose, that I goe about to inferre that, which precisely I forwarned was impossible to be concluded? Of the causes, which I produced, I professed no more, but that they were consonant to the rules of pietie, and might concurre in Christes agonie, which you do grant after your nice maner by confessing these wanted not; and when you haue yeelded as much as I vrged, then you runne backe to your sillie shift, and say they were not the maine or chiefe causes of that agonie; your hell paines are left out, which must haue a place, as you thinke, in that perplexitie of Christs in the Garden. But sir first prooue your hell paines were then and there inflicted on Christs soule, and then you shall haue leaue to couple that to the causes of Christs agonie. Till you so doe, in vaine you denie the rest for want of this. It sufficeth me to shew religious and zealous respects of pietie and charitie, which might

mooue Christ to those affections, and other proofe of voluntarie actions and inward affections can none be brought. And yet you may remember, sir Defensor, though you dissemble it, that when you trample so readily, but yet so rudely on my reasons, you wrong the ancient fathers, whence I collected them, more then you doe mee. Hilarie and Ambrose doe peremptorily teach, that Christs sorow in the Garden was not for himselfe, nor his owne sufferings, but for our sinnes and woundes. And though you refute me with breathing out more absurdities then sentences in this your defence, yet the sober Reader will not suffer you so soone to deface their iudgements and opinions, whom I follow. But we shall heare some doubtie dispute to mainetaine this matter.

               Sunt duo tortores animae, timor et dolor. There are two tormentors of the soule, feare and sorow, saith Austen. And who that hath but his fiue witts, doth not feele, that feare and sorow are afflictions and vexations of the soule? Wherfore your excluding them from the sacrifice for sinne, because they are no paines, is a learned peece of worke which neuer a Morter-maker in England would stumble at besides you. Let shame, if not sense, teach you that feare and sorow are very painfull afflictions of the soule, and rather comprised then exempted in Christs sufferings by that text of Scripture, which you pretend; and therefore necessarie respects and pertinences to the sacrifice for sin. Psal. 51. 
               The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit, saith Dauid. Why then should not the affliction of Christs spirit with feare and sorow be properly a part of his sacrifice and suffering for sin? They were proper parts, you say, of his holinesse.] And might they not also, when they grew vehement & grieuous, be parts of his sufferings? You would seeme skilfull after your vnlearned maner in the soules-suffering. Is there any suffring more proper to the soule then feare & sorow from her owne cogitations, apprehensions, & affections? from the immediate hand of God, you thinke, is more proper. That in some cases may be possible, though in Christes you can prooue no such thing; but that is most proper, which the soule neuer wanteth, and hath of her owne nature. And therefore so farre is it from being exempted from the sacrifice of sinne, that in vs there is none other sacrifice for sinne but repentance which is all one with godly sorow, bringing with it2.

To haue accepted the punishment, which Gods iustice awarded, and to haue neglected the offence and displeasure, which gods holinesse conceaued against sinne, had beene not to pacifie, but to prouoke God, in not regarding the cause which mooued him to take vengeance on sinne. It is therefore most agreeable to the rules of pietie, that the inward sorow for our sinnes, which the sonne of God impressed on his humane soule, when he prepared himselfe to make purgation of them, did no lesse affect and afflict him, then the outward paines receaued in his body; and why you should exclude this from his agonie, there is no reason, but that you are most in loue with that, which hath least proofe or likeliehood to be the cause of this agonie.
            This being exactly noted by Hilarie, Ambrose, Cyrill and other auncient and learned Fathers, I did rightly to obserue it, how lightly soeuer your insolent conceit esteemeth it.

               If Christ were sorowfull to vs, that is, for our sakes, it must needs be, that he was comforted (by the Angell) for vs, and to our vse. For what should he aske with that agonie for himselfe, who here on earth gaue heauenly things with power? Then neither Christes sorow in the Garden, nor his prayer with that agonie after he was comforted by the Angell, were for himselfe or his owne sufferings, much lesse for hell paines deuised and inflicted by you on the soule of Christ, but his extreame sorrow and affectionate prayer might well be for our sinnes, whose cause he vndertooke, and for our sakes, whose persons he then presented vnto God with most vehement contention of spirit, and of all the powers of soule and body.
            
               Defenc. pag. 98. li. 12. 
               Neither in respect of these your supposed causes could Christ say, Saue me from this houre, nor, Let this cuppe passe from me: as in respect of his infinite paines, he might.] The houre and cuppe which Christ speaketh of, are by himselfe referred not to any painesWhat cup Christ dranke of. suffered in the Garden, as you pretend, much lesse to the paines of hell inflicted by Gods immediate hand on Christes soule, as you would haue it; but to the time and maner of his sufferings from the hands of the Iewes. Of the houre, after all his prayers ended in the Garden, and his last returne to his Disciples, he sayth:Mar. 14. v. 41 
               Sleepe hence forth, and take your rest, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , the houre is come, beholde the Sonne of man is giuen into the hands of sinners. Here is that houre that Christ so much spake of, euen the time that he should be deliuered into the handes of sinners to suffer a cruell and shamefull death at their hands. And so he told them, that came to take him,Luc. 22. v. 53 
               This is your verie houre, and the power of darkenesse. And this he called the Cuppe, which his father gaue him to drinke. For when Peter drew his sword to defend his Master from the hands of the Iewes, Iesus said vnto him,Ioh. 18. v. 11. 
               put vp thy sword into thy sheath: shall I not drinke of the cuppe, which my Father hath giuen me? Peter neither did, nor coulde hinder the cuppe, which you imagine Christ dranke in the garden from the immediate hand of God, he ment plainly to resist the Iewes, that they should not apprehend Christ. That enterprise of Peter when Christ would represse, and submit himselfe to his fathers will and counsell for his death, he said as we saw before, shall I not drinke of the cup, which my Father hath giuen me? So that the Scriptures mention the houre & cup of Christs suffering on the Crosse from the rage of the people & malice of the rulers; of your inuisible cuppe containing the death of the damned, they say nothing.

               His holy and righteous affections were at all houres and seasons in him without measure holy, yet now at his death did not so expresly breake out and shew themselues, as they did at diuers times before.] You receaue a iust reward of your error, that whiles you labour to impugne the trueth, your lucke is not to light on one true sentence to your purpose. That extreame feare and sorrow were at all houres and seasons in him, which yet were holy and righteous affections in Christ, is a notable vntrueth; and that they did not breake out so expresly in the garden, as at diuers times before, is another as false as the former; and but that it is no newes in you to fasten on fancies, a man would maruell to see so many falshoods couched so closely together.

Wherefore damnation and desperation excepted, and all dubitation excluded as well of his person, as of his function, hee might yeeld to God for vs, and as part of our ransome, the lowest degree of submission, and deepest impression of feare and sorrow, that mans nature could feele without doubting or distrusting the fauour and goodnesse of God towards him or his. Wherein he did not onely religiously giue vnto God, that which was due vnto the holinesse and Iustice of God, but he set vs a patterne how we should approch to God, when we finde our selues loaden with sinne, euen in all feare and trembling of so great power and maiestie, and with inward griefe and groanes of heart for displeasing so admirable holinesse, that we may receaue comfort from God, when we doe not spare truely to acknowledge his goodnesse, and earnestly to lament our owne wickednesse. These verie painefull, but yet very holy impressions of feare and sorrow with teares and sighes vnspeakeable, Christ shewed and sanctified in his owne person, as an acceptable sacrifice to God, not for any blemish of his owne, who was the cleane and vndefiled lambe of God, but for our haynous and enormous sinnes, the excesse whereof could neuer be matched or purged but by the infinite dignitie and humilitie of him, that owing nothing paid all, and forced to none of these freely offered his obedience to the honour and glorie of his father.

And what if Christ spake of the present impressions of feare and sorrow, which he wished to be mitigated with comfort from God, as they were within a while by the sending of an Angell from heauen; did he therefore wish the holinesse of his obedience and humilitie to be changed, because he praied the burden thereof might be eased?Psal. 51.

               The truth is, he could not by any meanes pray against that, or decline that, onely vnlesse he were for the time in some astonishment and perturbation of his senses, which by the infinitenesse of that paine he well might be, yea he could not but be, as is afore shewed to haue hapned in Moses and Paul.] There is as much truth in this, as in the rest of your deuices. Here are errors as thicke as hops, shuffled in vpon your bare word, the proofe whereof you bring after at leasure about latter Lammas. 1. That Christ felt infinite pain

               Therefore no maruaile though this astonishment (in Christ) were farre greater, then is to be seene in any man, that euer was or shall be. Wherein you keepe the Sauiour of the world as long, and as often, as pleaseth yourselfe. 3. That against these paines he could not by any meanes pray, onely vnlesse he were thus astonished: 4. That Paul in his Epistle to the Romanes expressing his affection for the Iewes, was likewise astonished and amazed, as not knowing what he said.Defenc. pag. 99 li. 8.

To this opinion of some men that Christ was in his agonie stroken with a feare of eternall death, and so might pray against it; I gaue two expositions, how those words might be tolerated in Christian Religion without apparent impietie. The one, thatSermo. pag. 23. li. 21. 
               Christ had no neede to pray for himselfe, (against that cuppe of eternall death) but ONLIE FOR VS, who then suffered with him & in him. The other, that if we would conioine Christs person with ours, feare must there be taken for a shunning and declining of that cup, which heIbid. pag. 24. li. 10. 
               religiously disliked. ForIbid. pag. 23. li. 29. 
               touching himselfe, albeit the innocencie of his cause, the holinesse of his life, the merite of his obedience, the abundance of his spirite, the loue of his father, and vnity of his person did most sufficiently guard him from all danger and doubt of eternall death: yet to shew the perfection of his humility, he would not suffer his humane nature to require it on right but prostrate on the earth besought his father, that cuppe might passe from him, and was heard in that he shunned or auoided. I repeate the selfe same words, which then I vsed, to lett the Reader see that I shift not hands, nor change not mindes as there is no cause I should; but that this Broker neglecting my manifest limitations to other mens opinions, and euident speache, as also suppressing my purpose, would haue the world beleeue that I graunt Christ doubted and feared eternall death to come on his owne person. Which in the maze that you put him in, sir defensor, might well be, since you auouch hee knew not what he praied, or els he sinned in praying against the resolute and knowen will of God; but by my positions it is impossible, that any distrustfull feare of hell, or eternall death should fall on the soule of Christ for the reasons there shortly, but sufficiently collected by me. And this is your idle course throughout your Booke, to catch at a word and neuer to regard what goeth before or after, be it neuer so plaine and perspicuous to recall your misconstruing my speach.

of men, but was also perfused (The Translator of the Catechisme into Greeke allowed as well as the Latin saith,

For to sinners, whose person in some sort Christ here sustained, were due the sorowes and torments not of this present death onely, but also of future and eternall death. Of the paines of the damned really inflicted in the garden on Christs soule by the immediate hand of God, and of Christs extreame astonishment for the present Torments therof, the writer of the Catechisme knew nothing; (these deuices of yours are later then the making of that Booke;) but he speaketh of Christes fearing the infinite wrath of God against our sinnes, which he apprehended in the Garden, and in respect thereof fell into this horrible feare.

               It is passing strange doctrine, and simply impossible, that Christ should feare the cup of eternall malediction, which he perfectly knew concerned him not at all, and by no meanes could euer possibly come neere him. But the Catechisme saith Christ was perfused (or perplexed) with the horror of eternall death. And as our head knit with vs into one and the same body, he might tremble at eternall death hanging ouer our heads, and most dreadfully persuing our sinnes in vs, if he made not satisfaction for vs. You would shift the word eternall out of the text, and tell vs a tale of the substance thereof, which you will imagine how Christ shall suffer by a new deuice of yours, though the Catechisme speake nothing thereof: but if you expound the Catechisme, and not correct it, or confute it, you must shew vs how Christ might feele or feare EVERLASTING OR FVTVRE DEATH due to sinners. For those are the words of the Catechisme; who not content to say EVERLASTING, addeth thereto FVTVRE death, which of force must follow after this present death separating the soule from the bodie, except you haue the skill in Grammar to make future goe before present. How Christ in coniunction with vs, and compassion on vs, might feare euerlasting death for vs, as imminent ouer vs, and yet speake in his owne name, I will in place conuenient more largely declare, when I come to Christes complaint on the crosse; till which time I pray the Reader to haue patience, least I should be forced often to prooue and repeat one and the same thing.

               that, which he perfectly knew could by no meanes come neere him. By this rule Christ should pray for nothing touching himselfe: for Christ perfectly knew all that God had most certainly decreed towards him; and chiefly Gods resolute and reuealed counsels for his glory. What need then was there Christ should pray for any such thing, since he perfectly knew what should come to passe, and by the power of his person was fully able to dispose of heauen and hell, life and death both present and eternall. His owne words are:

               Father I will, that they which thou hast giuen me, be with me euen where I am, that they may behold my glory; yet to demonstrate the wonderfull vertue of his obedience and humilitie, he suffered his humane nature humbly to pray for that, which his person could of it selfe performe, and in all things referred himselfe to his Fathers will, though he also sayd to his Father; All thine are mine, and I am glorified in them, and all things that the Father hath, are mine. Then might Christ in the Garden pray, that the cuppe of eternall malediction deserued by our sinnes might passe from him and his, though he submitted himselfe and his members to drinke of the cuppe of Gods wrath so much as should please his heauenly Father; which he was assured in regard of his prayer should be no more than he and his should well endure.
            
               Defenc. pag. 99 li. 16. 
               All this is nothing else in effect then your first cause, his submission to Gods maiestie sitting in iudgement. wherefore you might haue lessened your number, and so your answer to this might haue beene the same, which is made to your foremost.] Your conceite is not so currant, that I should pare my number for your pleasure. Christ himselfe saith,Matth. 22. 
               On these two Commandements, (thou shalt loue the Lord thy God, with all thine heart, with all thy soule, and with all thy minde; and thy neighbour as thy selfe) hangeth the whole Law and the Prophets. Were therefore then the tenne Commandements, which God gaue to Moses, superfluous, because they might be reuoked to two generall contents? speciall parts and duties are profitablie deliuered, so long as they be any way distinguished, notwithstanding they may be comprised in fewer, but more generall branches. The worke of our Redemption was the summe of all that Christ did, said, or suffered heere on earth. shall we therefore reiect the rest of the Gospell, because the substance thereof may be expressed in a word or twaine? [these you will say, are not distinct in matter but in wordes.] Who told you so? The trembling at Gods glorie, when it was reuealed to mans infirmitie; the honouringFeare & sorow necessarie in the sacrifice for sinne. of his sanctitie with godly sorrow, which was despised with our iniquitie, the mitigating of his anger with humble and earnest praier, which was prouoked with our contempts, were they not three different effects euen in Christ himselfe, and so might stirre vp three religious affections of feare, sorrow and prayer? Why then should they be confounded in Christ, whose humane nature might yeeld all three to God, as well in respect of pietie to God, and of charitie to men, as in regard of his office for the satisfaction of our sinnes? for he might not approch the presence of God as a Priest with our person and cause, who were sinnefull, though he were innocent and holy, to make intercession and sacrifice for our sinnes, but he must giue God his due glorie, haue compassion on our miserie, and mediate for our safetie. As therefore I see no cause to exclude these affections and actions from the satisfaction for sin, so I see greater reason to include them in the sacrifice for sin, except we make Christ a Priest onely by his SVFFERINGS & leaue him neither any honor of OFFERING nor right of PRAYING for vs in the purgation of our sins, which were a strange kind of Priesthood, & no way answerable to the Leuiticall in that, wherin the apostle compareth them. For in the Law the Priest was to present the sacrifice to God, and to pray for the trespasser; which if you thinke needlesse in the true sacrifice, that should propitiate the sinnes of the world, you must correct the Apostle, that maketh the Law a figure of the Gospell, though the person of the Priest, and the price of the sacrifice farre excell all that was vnder the Law.
            
               Defenc. pag. 99. li. 20. 
               Furthermore, you knit in within this, foure other seuer all causes of Christes agonie, as you recken them pa. 27. First, his taking of our infirmities in his flesh to cure them. Secondly, his breaking the knot betwixt bodily death and hell, which none but hee was able to doe.

Thirdly, Gods anger which might be executed on his bodie, but was mitigated by him. Fourthly, the desire he had to continue the feeling and enioying of Gods presence with his bodie.] As there is no one thing in the Scriptures, that receiueth and hath more diuers opinions of it, than Christes agonie in the Garden; so I proposed as many as had any coherence with trueth, and left the Reader to make his choise, which he liked best. Howbeit, I did not pag. 27. recken foure seuerall causes of Christes agonie, as you mistake, but of the Serm. pag. 27. li. 23. 
               feare which Christ had and shewed of (his bodily) death. His agony had other parts and affections besides feare and astonishment, as sorow, zeale, submissiue and intentiue prayer, and a bloudie sweat: the obiects and ends whereof might be as different as the things themselues. For example; Christes feare in the Garden might haue many respects and causes as well as his sorow. He might feare the glory of God now sitting in iudgement to receiue recompense for the sinnes of his elect. For as Christ himselfe, who best knew it, confirmeth it by saying, Iohn 12. Christes manhood might feare the glorie of Gods iudgement. 
               Now (at hand) is the iudgement of this world, now shall the Prince of this world be cast ont: so wee must not thinke so mightie and weightie matters, as the iudgement of the world, and the casting out of Satan the accuser of his brethren, and the admitting the Redeemer to present himselfe here on earth for our cause to the face of God in iudgement, were decreed and setled by God without some reuelation of his glorie and maiestie meet for those persons and purposes. For this is a rule which may euery where be obserued in the Scriptures, that when God is described as a Iudge, he is sayd to sit in a Throne, and all the host of heauen to stand before him, to resemble the glory of his iudgement: as we finde in Daniel. 7. vers. 9, 10. Esa. 6. vers. 1, 2. 1. Kings. 22. vers. 19. Wherefore Dauid sayth, Psal. 9. v. 7. 
               The Lord hath prepared his throne for iudgement. This Michaiah and Esay the Prophets say they SAW, which whether it were by sight, as Steuen Act. 7 v. 55. 
               looked stedfastly into heauen, and (with his eyes) saw the glory of God, and Iesus standing at the right hand of God; or in spirit, as Ezechiel waking, and Ezech. 8. 
               sitting in his house with the Elders of Iudah before him, was by a diuine vision brought to Ierusalem, to see all the abominations there committed; I dare not determine. Christ himselfe sayth, I saw Satan fall downe from heauen like lightning. Which way soeuer Gods glory in iudgement was reuealed vnto Christ, and beheld of Christ in the Garden, it was able for the time of his humilitie to impresse a religious feare and trembling into his humane nature, since Christ came now by iudgement to haue the burden of our sinnes taken from vs, and layed vpon him, that he might make satisfaction for them.
            Another thing that Christ might iustly, and yet religiously feare in the Garden, offering now to ransome man from the wrath of God, was the POWER of Gods wrath,

                  eare. which is fully infinite, and so farre exceedeth the strength and reach of mans nature, that our earthly infirmitie, to which Christ submitted himselfe for our sakes, can not comprehend the greatnesse thereof, nor thinke on the power thereof without feare and trembling. Psal. 90. v. 11 
               Who knoweth (saith Dauid to God) the power of thy wrath? for according to thy feare, (that is, as thou art feared,) so is thine anger. Contempt and carelessenesse kindle and increase the wrath of God against vs, feare and submission asswage it. And when I name feare, I meane not a dreadfull distrust of Gods purpose towards vs, which is desperation, but a perswasion and confession of his power ouer vs, whereby we feare to displease him, and tremble before him withall submission, when we haue displeased him. This feare Christ teacheth his disciples, when he saith, I will shew you,
               Luc. 12. 
               whom you shall feare; feare him, which after he hath killed, hath power to cast into hell; ye
                     •…
                   I say, feare him: not meaning, they should firmely beleeue, God would euerlastingly condemne them, but that thinking on his power preuailing here and in hell, they should beware to prouoke him, and with all humilitie prostrate themselues before him, when they had offended him, to preuent his anger. [Christ (you will say) needed not thus to feare, since he was no sinner.] For himselfe he needed not, because he was innocent and obedient in all thinges to the vttermost: but since he was at this time now to beare the burthen of our sinnes in his body, and to haue the chasticement of our peace laid vpon him, he might, and did iustly feare the power of Gods wrath prouoked

with our sinnes; which though he were assured could not rage on him vnto condemnation, yet God had infinite meanes to presse and punish the humane nature of Christ aboue that it was able to beare. And therefore except Christ would contemne the wrath of his father, which were impious, he was withall possible feare and trembling to deprecate his fathers anger against our sinnes, knowing that God would at his most ardent and most suppliant praier both pardon vs, and proportion that paine according to the weaknesse of our flesh which he bare about him, that neither his obedience, nor patience should be ouerwhelmed nor endangered, but onely prooued and tried, that in all things Christ might shew himselfe a patterne of perfection, as well by patience in affliction, as by innocencie of life. And this feare the more vehement in Christ, the more pleasing to God, since it proceeded neither from infidelitie nor distrust, but from pietie confessing the greatnesse and iustnesse of Gods anger against our wickednesse and vnwoorthinesse, and from charitie putting his holy and harmelesse person in the gappe betweene vs and God, least the wrathfull displeasure of God lighting on vs should vtterly consume vs.
            A third cause concurring with the rest of Christes feares in the Garden, againstChrist might feare the sting of death as horrible to mans nature. which he praied, might be the naturall abhorring of death, which his manhood then had and shewed in priuate, because he neither despised that punishment of God laide vpon our sinne; which indeed is and ought to be displeasant to mans nature; in that it was inflicted on vs for disobedience; neither would he suffer his soule or flesh to struggle and striue with death (as ours doe when sense and life beginnes to faile) in the eies of his persecutors, to whom by the present and quiet breathing out of his soule in their sight, he would declare himselfe to be the disposer and ruler of death; and so more then a man, though as a man hee were content to die for our sakes. And this kinde of feare verie learned and well redde Diuines agree might be the cause of Christes prayer in the garden, to haue the Cuppe passe from him; not that he was then amazed, and in that astonishment praied against the knowen will of God, as you imagine, and on that foundation build your conceit of hell paines to be then suffered in the soule of Christ, which you thinke excluded both reason and memorie from Christ: but that he therein accorded with his fathers will, who would haue that Cuppe hatefull and horrible by nature, though faith and obedience should ouerrule the feare and sting of death in our flesh, and Gods will be preferred before the naturall dislike, which he would haue vs to feele of death.

Yea as Christ was man, he was alwaies obedient to his Father, and therefore he saide; I alwaies doe the things, which please him. What meaning then hath, Quod deprecatur mortem & calicem, that he praieth to be freed from death, and from the Cuppe? Naturaliter, quâ homo, expauescebat, & exhorrescebat, fugiebatque mortem, Naturally as a man Christ feared, abhorred, and shunned death, & his naturall horror of death he called his will, when he said, Not my will be done, to witte, this naturall will which I haue as a man. Yet neither doth this will of Christ resist his Fathers will. for the Father would haue Christ to be like vs in all things sinne excepted, and to that end would haue him made Man. Therefore when Christ did naturally shunne and desire to escape death, he did not contradict his Fathers will, because the Father would haue this (naturall) horror and feare (of death) to be in Christ, as a punishment of our sinnes. Wherefore it is altogether false, that Christes will in this was diuers from his Fathers will. For we haue concluded, that this naturall horror of death, which Christ called his will, was not repugnant to the will of his Father, whereby he would haue Christ subiect to this horror. If in respect of the same end the Father had beene willing Christ should die, and Christ had beene vnwilling, or had neuer so little refused, then their willes had beene indeed repugnant. But in reference to the same end, that is to our saluation, Christ alwaies had the same will that his Father had. For in regard of our saluation Christs will was euer the same, and constant: but in respect of his humane Nature he neuer put off this affection, wherein he was like vs, and whereby we naturally flie death. By the iudgement of this

learned writer the varietie of willes in Christ, the one naturally shunning death, as in a man like vs, the other accepting and desiring it for our saluation, was no contrarietie either in it selfe, or to the will of God; but God himselfe would haue the sting of our common and vsuall death to be grieuous vnto him, because it was the punishment of our sinne in Adam, and yet obedience to counteruaile that naturall detestation of death, when God for his glorie calleth vs to that triall, as he did his Sonne in that case.
            The like limitations of Christes prayer in the Garden (if it were possible let this cup passe from me) other ancient writers deliuered before Zanchius, who obserue this expresse condition out of Christes prayer, That if it were possible to stand with Gods will and our saluation, then Christ prayed the cuppe might passe from him, and not otherwise. Orig. in Math. tract. 35. 
               Christ taking vnto him (sayth Origen) the nature of mans flesh, retained all the properties thereof: according to which he prayed in this place, the cuppe might passe from him. It is the propertie of euery faithfull man first to be vnwilling to suffer any paine, specially that tendeth to death, because he is a man, and hath flesh; but if God so will, then to be content euen against that will of his owne, because he is faithfull. There is also another Exposition of this place, which is this: If it be possible, that all those good things may come to effect without my passion, which otherwise shall come by my death, then let this passion passe from me, that both the world may be saued, and the Iewes not perish by putting me to death. So Bede: Be

                     〈◊〉
                  . 
               If death may die without my death in the flesh, let this cuppe (sayth Christ) passe from me, but because this will not otherwise be, thy will be done, not mine. And Euthymius: Euthymius in Matth. cap. 26. 
               As a man Christ sayd, If it be possible, that is, so farre as is possible. And in saying, Yet not as I will, but as thou wilt; he teacheth, that we must follow the will of God, though nature reclaime. So that the preferring of Gods will before the desire of his owne nature, and the limiting of his prayer with this condition, If it were possible (not to Gods power, but to Gods purpose) to saue the world without his death, then he desired the cuppe might passe from him; prooue apparently, that Christ was not onely well aduised in that prayer, but he meant to teach vs, that neither the power of his enemies did oppresse his weaknesse, nor his owne loue leade him to a needlesse death; it was rather Gods determined and irreuocable counsell and will, that he must die, or we must perish. By which we learne not Christes inconstancie, as of a man amazed, but an excellent mysterie of Christian religion, that no sacrifice could take away sinne, but onelyThe intent of Christs prayer in the garden. the death of Christ on the crosse, which he for our sakes earnestly desired, though by his thrise declining it, if we might possibly be otherwise saued, he shewed how painfull and grieuous that suffering would be vnto him. We are therefore by the one to collect, how intolerable that cuppe would be to his flesh; and by the other, to beholde his ardent loue to vs, and willing obedience to his Father: which things, if in your conceit they conclude Christ to haue beene therein amazed, I shall coniecture, that your wits are not to this houre yet well recouered; since greater pietie and charitie could not be shewed in that infirmitie, wherewith Christ was then compassed, and acerbitie of paines to come, which he did not dissemble. Now let vs heare how you impugne this.
            
               Defenc. pag. 99. li. 26. 
               The first of these (foure) maketh in my minde much for vs. For vnderstanding that Christ tooke all the infirmities and passions whereto mens nature is subiect, to the end he might cure all and euerie kinde of them in vs; then it followeth, that he wanted not the paines and immediate sufferings of paines inflicted by Gods owne hand in his soule.] It is but your mind that maketh so much for you, your collection is otherwise as wide from reason and trueth, as any may be. For what if Christ taking our nature vnto him tooke therewith all our infirmities and affections, (which you cunningly call passions, a word indifferent to affections and sufferings) doth that inferre that he tooke vnto him the paines of the damned, because mans nature through the hardnesse of his impenitent hart is subiect after this life by Gods iust iudgement to euerlasting damnation for sinne? are your eyes so ill matches that you cannot discerne betwixt naturall affections cleauing to all men from their birth, and the reall suffering of hell paines inflicted, as you defend,

by Gods immediate hand on the soules of the faithfull here in this life, which in deed are reserued for the wicked in another world, & are somtimes feared of the godly here on earth, when the conscience of their sin through want of faith calleth Gods fauor in question with their owne harts? first proue, that all the godly haue the pains of the damned inflicted here in this life on their soules by the immediat hand of God; (for nature is not proper nor priuate to this or that man, but common and constant to all men) and next, that notwithstanding your hell paines thus suffered, they are in constant and perfect faith and assurance of Gods fauour and his heauenly kingdome; and then you haue some pretence for your purpose, which now is none. For touching the first I appeale not onely to the Scriptures, which teach no such thing; but to the consciences and experiences of all the faithfull, whether this can haue any trueth in it, that the true paines of the damned are really inflicted on all their soules here on earth by Gods immediate hand. And secondly, when they feele any feare of Gods wrath, or doubt of Gods fauour; whether that come not through the failing and shrincking of their faith, which, pressed often with the number of their sinnes, feareth least God will visite their offences with a mercielesse iudgement, because they haue so greatly prouoked him. The feare of hell may iustly make them quake and tremble, which they acknowledge they haue worthily deserued, and the same terrour doth often, though not alwaies, pursue the wicked vnto desperation: but other torments of hell actually inflicted by Gods owne hand on the soules of all the faithfull, as the Scriptures deliuer none, so you shall not be able to prooue any common to all mankind, though God want not power to punish where and as pleaseth him. If therefore you speake of naturall affections, they were common to Christ with vs, but in vs excessiue vpon euery occasion, which in him were moderate, till they were inflamed with piety or charitie, and then they burned more in him then in vs, by reason of his abundant giftes and graces farre passing ours. But if you talke of some secret speculations priuate to your selfe, and some others of your sort, that dreame perchaunce of hell paines both night and day according to your owne fansies, then no words of mine, nor of any auncient father come neere those deuices of yours, which are knowen to no man either by reading or feeling, but to such conceiters as you are, if happely you doe not belie, or deceaue your owne hearts.

               It is most vnreasonable, which here you doe, (if you doe as you seeme) to vnderstand them of meere bodilie death, and of the infirmities meerelie of his flesh.] Shew that they name, or intend any other death, then the death of Christes body on the crosse, or els your otherwise conceauing them without any words of theirs is a plaine peruerting them, to pull them to your part. Of infirmities when they speake, they meane naturall, such as were no derogations to faith, nor hope, nor to any other the graces of Gods spirite in Christ, and in them all Christ was like vnto vs, whether they were infirmities of body or soule. Whether feare and sorow be infirmities meerely of the flesh, is a doubt fit forFeare may be intellectiu

As for the contrarieties, which you would take hold of, that Christ as a man did abhorre and feare death, and yet not somuch as to fall into that agony or bloudy sweate for feare of his sufferings; with such a slacke and shallow Reader, as you are, they may beare a shew of repugnancie; but to any man, that marketh or vnderstandeth what is said, it accordeth full well, that

Christ might haue a naturall feare of death, which is common to all the godly; and yet no such perplexed feare for any sufferings of his, as to sweate bloud for paine therof. And this maketh more against you, then you wil seeme to acknowledge. For if Christ had no such afflicting feare in regard of his owne suffring or passion, but only in respect of vs and our danger, then certainly by the censure of Ambrose, Ierom, and Bede, Christ suffered no paines of hell, nor of the damned, since they would bread another maner of agony, then this life could endure. And howsoeuer the view of death fast clasped with hell, till Christ did breake the knotte thereof, might seeme terrible to Christes humane consideration; yet for somuch, as he was secured from the one by the innocency, vnity, and dignity of his person, though he submitted himselfe to the death of his body; this feare was both righteous and religious, and as farre from the paines of the damned, as any sufferings of the soule in this life might be.

               He would not, he could not so feare and be affrighted, yea and piteously astonished with such sorrow oppressing him, as to sweate drops of bloud onely for feare of his bodily death; Neither would he pray at all, much lesse so vehemently, and so often times as he did, against that which he perfectly knew was Gods will, and his owne most willing purpose to vndergoe.] It is more then folly to mistake, misplace, and misapplie euerie thing after this sort as you doe; and then to collect you know not what, nor why, from your owne vnwise and rash presumptions. What if Christ had more cause of sorrow in the Garden, then his bodily death? ergo he felt the paines of the damned inflicted on his Soule by Gods immediate hand. Tie this argument to the manger, litter is fitter for it, then an answere. Such blockish and brutish sequences were the first morter that plastred your hell paines to Christs passion. The worke of our redemption, which Christ now vndertooke to haue pronounced and setled by the righteous iudgement of God, and his Elect to be freed, and pardoned of all their sinnes by the sufferings of his person,The worke of our redemption was cause enough to prouoke Christs bloudy sweate. and to be restored to Gods fauour by his mediation, as also satan to be reiected from preuailing against them, or so much as accusing them; was a matter of the greatest moment in all Christian Religion. What maruaile then, if the manhood of Christ, when it approched so waightie a worke, as by prayer first to obtaine and confirme all this, that after he might the more cheerefully and constantly accomplish his obedience vnto death; What maruaile I say, if the glory of Gods iudgement, and power of his wrath, the number of our sinnes, and neglect of our owne state; the sharpe and eger malice of satan made Christ with all possible feare of the great might and maiestie of the Iudge, all passionate sorrow for the crimes and contempts of the prisoners, all earnest and zealous intention of prayer against the impugner and impediment of mans deliuerance, to agonize himselfe euen vnto a bloudie sweate? If in our prayers the spirit of Christ stirre vp Rom. 8. 
               sighes vnspeakeable, when we remember what danger we were in; what sorrow, cries, and teares may we iustly thinke, the fountaine of mercie and pietie would powre forth in our behalfe, when our saluation was now in question before the Iudge of all the world, and how burned that fire and flame of Christs loue and care for vs, till he was comforted and assured from heauen, that God would not by our wickednesse or vnworthinesse be stayed from performing his mercies towards vs, in Christ his Sonne, nor from accepting Christs obedience and sacrifice as the full ransome for all our transgressions notwithstanding all the resistance that sinne or satan could make in the righteous iudgement of God?
            This, you will say, God long before had purposed and promised vnto his Sonne.]Christ was most earnestly to aske what God had faithfully promised to graunt. And that made Christ the more earnestly pray for it, since God had from the beginning determined, as well to haue it asked by his Sonne, as graunted by himselfe. And therefore Christs supplications for vs in the daies of his flesh, and at the hower of his passion now approching, were as needefull as his sufferings, forsomuch as pietie and charitie are perceiued rather by the Soule, then by the flesh; and God would neuer haue accepted the outward murdering of Christs body without the inward and acceptable sacrifice of his voluntarie obedience, patience and loue euen vnto death which were the points, that were chieflly pretious in Gods sight.

Secondly, if we grant

For feare doth not alwayes apprehend what danger is toward, but onely that some danger aboue our reach or strength is imminent ouer vs. Thirdly, if feare of what you will, were the cause of this agonie, it is no way consequent, that that which Christ feared, was really inflicted on him; since feare is of future, not of present eui

Wherefore you hit Saint Austens meaning as rightly, as if a man should post to London Bridge with his backe towards it.

For when he thought it needfull, he did stirre in himselfe by his owne power humane affections. If to raise feare and sorrow within himselfe, when he would, were power aboue nature, and no humane infirmitie; as also to appoint how farre they should preuaile in him; what was it then by the power of these affections in him, to represse and temper all our infirmities and affections, and to endue vs with heauenly grace and courage to resist and restraine the excesse of those affections in our weake natures? was it power, or infirmitie in Christ thus to worke, either in himselfe, or in vs? It was power no doubt in Christ to limit the time, degree and force of those affections, which his will would admit; and in all these things the lesse necessitie of nature vrged him; the more acceptable was his obedience vnto God, that would voluntarily subiect himselfe to our miseries, paines and afflictions. I then neither doe, nor neede denie, that our naturall infirmities were common to Christ with vs, but those were voluntarily receiued in him August. de trinitate li. 4. cap.

How much more likely is it then, that Christ the very Rock of all strength and fountaine of patience would not thus seeme affrighted and astonished, for his meere bodily death, and that before it came vnto him?] Your brablement is more tedious to me, then your Argument troublesome. You spend here a whole leafe to shew that Malefactors and Martyrs o

               ten suffer most horrible torments very quietly and altogether without any such agonie, as Christ shewed in the Garden. How maketh that against me, who teach out of Hilarie, Ambrose, Ierom and Bede, that Christ was not thus agonized for any sufferings of his owne, much lesse for feare of a bodily death; though he would be like vs in hauing a naturall horror of death, as Athanasius, Austen, Cyrill and Damascene affirme? What wandering and trifling is this, to be loquent in things superfluous, and silent in matters most serious? The whole worke and waight of our redemption was now before Christs eyes and apprehension in more exact and liuely manner, (he now appearing before the iudgement seate of God) then we in this body can discerne or describe. For as all things needfull shall be present and patent to vs, when we are brought to Gods Tribunall, where no truth of things without vs, or within vs, which concerne vs, shall be couered or concealed from vs; so Christ presenting himselfe before the iudgement of God to haue Man redeemed by the ransome, which he would yeeld for him, and satan eiected from preuayling against his members by his mediation, did perfectly and fully behold both the detestation, that Gods holinesse had of all our sinnes, and the power of his wrath prouoked by our defection and rebellion; as also the dreadfull vengeance prepared and ordained for sinne, and our dull and carelesse contempt of our owne miserie, together with the watchfulnesse and egernesse of the Aduersarie; the brunt and burden of all which he must receaue, and auert from vs by that kind of satisfaction and recompence, which the iustice of God should then require at his hands. None of those things might be hid from Christs present and perfect view, when he came now to performe that, which the iudgement of God should thinke a iust price and full recompence for the sinnes of men. The due consideration, contemplation, intuition and apprehension whereof being in Christ more cleare, then we can conceaue, might worthily make the Manhood of Christ not onely feare and tremble, but in his prayers to God to stirre and inflame all the powers and parts of body and Soule, as farre as mans nature and spirit were able, with all submission, intention and deprecation possible to powre forth themselues before God. These you push away not as false, but as parts of Christs holinesse; as if any feare or sorrow could be in Christ, which were not religious and holy; and substitute other sufferings of the damned; as the second death, and the true paines of hell from the immediate hand of God, deuiced by your selfe without any direction of the Scriptures; and those you dreame Christ not onely feared, but really felt in the Garden, otherwise he could not sorrow and sweate as he did.
            And because you would seeme to say somewhat, though little to the purpose, and lesse against me, who auouch no such thing; you heape vp heere malefactours, murderers and theeues, besides martyrs, who neuer sweate bloud for any bodily torments inflicted on them. Grant all this, though there be differences, which yet you see not, what inferre you? That Christ did not thus sweate for his bodily death. What then? Ergo he suffered in the Garden the death of the damned, and the true paines of hell? This conclusion hangeth to the premisses with hay-ropes, you winde it which way you will, and then you say, I would faine wipe it off. But to me that neither

say, nor said any such thing, that Christ was thus agonized onely for feare of his meere bodily death, these be rather wildgoose-races, then sober mens reasons impugning any thing that I did or doe defend.
            And yet your comparisons be not so currant, as you conceaue them. For though murderers or malefactors for obstinacie or stupiditie, and martyrs for constancy may despise the torments, which they suffer, so long as strength of desperate malice in the one, or of heauenly grace in the other resisteth or endureth the paine; yet when nature is subdued and conquered by paine, that the soule must yeeld to death and depart, then can no man expresse, nor euer could any man declare, what conflicts of feare and horror the soule hath with death and in death. Onely Christ, who on the Crosse did voluntarily and instantly breath out his soule with all quietnesse contrarie to the course of mans nature, might before hand shew in himselfe, if it pleased him, the anguish and agonie, which naturally the soule hath in her strugling with death, and fainting vnder death, and which God had impressed on mans nature at the time of the departure of the soule from the bodie, in remembrance and resemblance of Gods displeasure against sinne, when by his mightie power he seuered the soule and spirit of man asunder, to giue way to death for the reuenge of the first mans disobedience in all his ofspring. I speake not this, as if there were none other causes, that might be of Christes agonie, but to shew that your comparisons, which you take to be so strong, are woorse then weake, since the soules both of Martyrs and Malefactors haue a naturall terror and horror of death impressed in them by Gods power and will, though whiles strength and memorie dure, they may be so confirmed in their good or euill purposes, that they doe not yeeld so long, as they can make resistance. This naturall horror of death, which mans soule hath impressed in her by Gods owne doing, if Christ would admit in the Garden priuately before his Father, as obedient to his ordinance, not openly before his enemies, to whom he would shew nothing but patience and constance aboue all malefactors and martyrs, what force haue your examples to refute this, since Christ voluntarily shewed that in the Garden, which the soules of all men naturally doe, when the feare or force of death falleth on them?

            To let you farther see, that your Malefactors and Martyrs doe not prooue, that Christ might not shew himselfe afrayd of death in the Garden, though in patience and constancie he exceeded all mankinde, when he came to the present feeling of his paines, you shall heare the iudgement of S. Austen affirming, that Christ by this voluntarieChrist would be like the weake to comfort the weake. feare would of mercie conforme himselfe to his weake members for their comfort, lest they should despaire when they feele the feare of death oppressing them.

They are indeed most setled Christians, if there be any such, which are not troubled when death approcheth: But are they stronger than Christ? Who will so say, though he were neuer so madde? What is it then that Christ was troubled (therewith) but because by the voluntarie shew of his weaknesse he did comfort those that were weake in his bodie, which is his Church: that if any of his were troubled with the approching of death, they should in spirit beholde him, lest thinking themselues by this (fearefulnesse) to be reprobates, they should be swallowed vp with a woorse death of desperation? And elswhere with admiration of Christes goodnesse for this verie cause; Idem in Iohannem tract. 52. 
               O Lord (sayth he) God aboue vs, Man for vs, I acknowledge thy mercy; for in that thou being so great, wouldest of thy loue be voluntarily troubled (by Ibidem. taking the affection of thy

members) thou doest comfort many in thy bodie (the Church) which are necessarily troubled with this their infirmitie, lest by despairing they should perish. So that neither of these wayes Martyrs nor Malefactours are stronger than Christ, though he feared death, which you imagine they do not: but Christ either in respect of his Fathers ordinance against sinne shewed that conflict with death in himselfe, which the soules of all men haue naturally, be they Martyrs or Malefactors, before they depart their bodies; or els of mercie towards vs he would voluntarily assume our weaknesse in the Garden, lest we should despaire, when we feele the stroke and terrour of death, as by his example on the crosse he ledde vs to immooueable patience and confidence in all our afflictions.
            Some Malefactors (you say) despise death, & often smile in their torments.] Being hardened in their sinnes, and obstinate against God, they may haue either stupefaction of sense by Satans meanes, to encourage others to the like wickednesse by their contempt of death; or els obduration in their mischiefe, till the time of repentance be past; but their soules, that so stifly contemne Gods iudgements, haue another maner of terror before they forsake their bodies, when indeed it is too late for want of sense and memorie to call for grace. And the Martyrs themselues, as all good Christians that are resolued not only quietly to suffer, but to desire death, that they may be with Christ, are by Gods grace preserued in that minde so long as vnderstanding and faith preuaile; but when the powers of the soule are ouerwhelmed by the violent paines and pangues of death, she is by Gods ordinance in all mankinde, and euen in theAll feele the sting of death which Christ expressed before

Your reasons therefore are all idle and impertinent, which you draw from the patience of Martyrs, or stifnesse of Malefactors. For admitting all that to be true, which Martyrs by grace, and Malefactors of pertinacie performe in their torments, whiles strength and memorie serue them, yet haue they both their conflicts with death, when they can neither speake nor expresse what they feele, and malefactors a most fearefull confusion, when repentance being past, which they neglected, their soules are now suffered to see the terrours and torments of hell, into which they shall presently depart. And this naturall anguish of death, which assaulteth all men, when the soule feeleth the strangenesse and bitternesse of her diuorce from the bodie, Christ might purposely

               All your answeare is, malefactours are no fit comparison for the sonne of God: for they are desperate not hauing any feare or care of God, till they feele the force of his wrath in hell fire. What an answeare is this?] The answeare is 
                  •…
               itter and fuller, then your wit serueth you to vnderstand, or your learning to refute. For this ignorant or desperate contempt of Gods iudgment, which you alleage in malefactors, Christ might not follow; since he rightly discerned, and religiously feared Gods displeasure against sinne euen in the death inflicted on the body of man. So that Christ shewed an humble regard of Gods punishment with due feare and sorow, which impenitent Theeues and murderers neglect till it be to late; and yet when he came to the very suffering of death on the Crosse, his silence and patience farre exceeded both malefactours and martyrs. The cause of your error is this, that you ascribe that to weaknesse of heart and want of strength in Christ, which he of humilitie to God & mercie to his members voluntarily admitted in himselfe to comfort and strengthen the weake, which are not able to imitate his perfection of patience on the crosse. Leo de Passione Domini serm. 7. 
               In our basenesse (saith Leo) Christe was despised, he sorowed in our heauinesse, and was crucified in our paine. For of mercy he tooke vnto him the passion of our mortality to this end, that he might heale it, and his power

For Christ tooke from death all destroying power ouer the Elect, and from them all amazed and confounding feare, which others finde in death; and so not only by his example taught them to resort to God with prayer for comfort against the terrour of death, but by his agonie enabled them to goe securely and quietly to their deaths, notwithstanding the horror thereof; since he will helpe them in the midst of that miserie, and receiue them with glorie, when others thinke them swallowed vp with death.

               Christ might feele somewhat extraordinary, yet not the pains of hell. 
               this you haue nothing to answer.] Are the pains of hell & the death of the damned come now to SOMEWHAT EXTRAORDINARIE? Heere may the Reader see the verie depth of all your new doctrine. It was SOMEWHAT, that Christ SVFFERED or FEARED in the Garden: ergo it was the second death and the pains of the damned. All your idle and erroneous illations and amplifications of martyrs and malefactors end now in SOMEWHAT, if you could tell what; and because you knowe not what it was, you will imagine what you list. I doe not doubt, but it was somewhat extraordinarie, that mooued Christ to this feare, sorow, and intentiue Prayer after comfort receaued from heauen by an Angell; although I dare not determine, what it was, which the Scriptures doe not expresse; much lesse presume it to be the second death, as you doe against the Scriptures, or frame a new hell of the damned, for Christes soule to pay our ransome, thereby to crosse the whole course of the word of God teaching and assuring vs the bloud of Christ was the price of our Redemption. I see many things extraordinarie, or rather nothing wholy ordinarie in the son of God, specially at the time of our redemption, which he alone for the innocencie and excellency

of his person, and power could, and did throughly performe. Yea euen in his agonie though some thinges might be common to him with man, yet none of those thinges could be sustained by any man, as they were by him. And therefore your somwhat betraieth your presumption, when thence you inferre what you best like, because the Scripture hath not acquainted you with euery secret affection or action, that was required in mans saluation.

               It was not therefore that only, but some other death farre more dreadfull and intolerable, which made Christ man, (being also God) in such wise to tremble and quake.] I hope you doe not meane, that Christes godhead trembled at your other death, or was subiect to any humane feares or miseries, nor that your other death was so dreadfull, that his diuine power could not keepe him from trembling and quaking at it. It was no small part of Christes obedience and humilitie to lay aside his strength, when he suffered for our sinnes, and not by power to resist, repulse or ease the paines, which his passion should bring; but with exact sense to feele it, and with woonderfull patience to indure it. Neither was it no part of Christes purpose by his sorrow and feare in the Garden to giue vs to vnderstand, that he would vse no power, which he might easily haue done, to diminish the vehemency or sense of the paines prepared for him; least his so sauing himselfe from smart by his secret power should delude Gods Iustice, impaire his loue to vs, and put vs in despaire of following his example; since we had no power to succour ourselues, as we might imagine of him, had he not by naturall and euident signes of true feare and sorow confirmed vnto vs, that he felt his afflictions, as much as we doe ours, and will helpe our infirmitie, and ease our miserie, though he would not spare himselfe. So that hence a good Christian would collect Christes submission to the weakest degree of mans infirmitie, and his communion with vs in tasting the sharpest of our sorowes, and not exaggerate his power to make him capable of the second death, Reuel. 21. 
               which is the lake burning with fire and brimstone, as the Scriptures affirme; and consequent, not antecedent to the first death, as you dreame in Christes case, besides that the Reuel. 14. 
               smoke of their torments (which are cast into this lake) ascendeth euermore, and they haue no rest night nor day.

               Indeed Christ had farre greater cause (as you say) to feare euen his bodily death, then any of his members haue. For it was therefore because death approched vnto him clasped fast with hell, so that he could not by the ordinance of God meddle with the one, but he must feele the other.] My wordes enlarged and peruerted by you may seeme to make some musicke for you, but of themselues they are true, and no way touch your vntuned and hie strained cratchets. That Christ must and did breake the knot betwixt death and hell, which otherwise were fast clasped together, and by receauing the one in his owne person did free all his members from the other, is no question neither with me, nor I thinke with any Christian man. The iust vengeance deserued and prepared for sinne, which was temporall and eternall death, the Redeemer must throughly know least he should ransome vs he could not tell from what. Wherefore not your new found hell, but the wages of our sinne, which was eternall death, vsually called hell in the Scriptures, might not be hidde from the e

               es of Christ; but euen the iust and full reward of our iniquities was to be presented to the sight and spirit of the Redeemer, that in the presence of God he might behold the waight of our sinne, the greatnesse and iustnesse of Gods anger against it, and accordingly conceaue how deare the price, and how sharpe the paine must be, that should quitte vs from this debt, and yet how pretious his person, and infinite his obedience was, that by one death should excuse vs from the other. Whether these things were reuealed and shewed to Christ by sight, as the terrors and torments of hell might be; or by vision, or in spirit, I dare not pronounce; I meddle not so farre with Gods secrets: God hath waies enough to propose the Iudgemets of the next world to men here liuing, when and how pleaseth him; but of none of these might Christ be ignorant, least we make him a Sauiour at peraduentures, as not knowing all things, that directly belonged to his office, and sacrifice, and to the causes & effects of our Redemption. That therfore

Christ must haue a perfect knowledge and liuely sight and view of all these things pertaining to the waight and burden of mans deliuerance, chiefly now when he appeared in Gods iudgement, (where nothing is couered) to performe the fame, I may safely grant; but that he felt or suffered eternall death, or the paines of the damned, or the full wages of our sinnes, this you shall neuer prooue, how much soeuer you presume with licentious but irreligious words to couer it, and conuey it into the Creed of Christians.

               He did not contemplate and looke on them a farre of, nor had to do with one more then the other, but by suffering one he felt both, and by enduring one he endured both.] Your speaches are false, absurd, and impious, howsoeuer you will qualifie them, when you come to the point, with the substances, but not with the circumstances of eternall death and damnation. First, shew that the Scripture teacheth any such thing of ChristThe Defender forgeth apace new parts of the Christian faith. as that he suffered the second death, or the paines of the damned. Next, that your deuice of this new second death, which dureth but for a moment, and proceedeth from Gods owne hand agreeth with the word of God. And Thirdly, that God did thus torment the soule of his sonne with his immediate hand, either in the garden, or on the crosse. All these things are your owne dreames plainly plastered to the Christian faith with figures and phrases of your owne coining; and yet you thinke you haue wrong, if you be not suffered to change the whole Creede, and outface the Scriptures with your idle fansies. That Christ should and did suffer a bodily death on the crosse, the Prophets did forshew, the Euangelists doe witnesse, and the Apostles doe confirme. That he died the second death in the garden before the first, or that this death came to him by fitts, and dured but the turning of an hand, and was inflicted on his soule by Gods immediate hand, as the other death was on his body by the Iewes, what Prophet, what Euangelist, what Apostle did euer teach or write? And how hang your owne words with your owne conceits? by suffering the one, Christ felt both, (you say) and by enduring the one he endured both.] Then in the Garden, when as yet he suffered not the death of the body, he felt not your second death; and Gods immediate hand did cease, if by the one, which the Iewes inflicted he endured both. If you fly to Christes fearing and apprehending the second death by the first; then are you farre from his suffering and enduring it; and this apprehension, which was not erroneous in Christ, as it is in you, might offer him a feare of Gods power, which is more infinite, then the manhoode of Christ could comprehend, and so might be terrible to him, as it is to all the godly when they finde or feele Gods anger against sinne; but it could breed no perswasion, or distrust, that God would destroy him for our sinnes, since he perfectly knew God would saue vs by his sufferings.

               Also you forget my argument: that Christ alwayes charged his Disciples not to take their bodily death heauily for righteousnesse sake. ergo he himselfe would neuer be so dismáyed with the feare of it.] As I did not professe in my conclusion to refute all your follies, which were both trifling and tedious, so if I had purposed any such thing, I should haue skipped this, as an argument rather of your ignorance and vanitie, than of any force or veritie. For first, where did I defend in my Sermons, that Christes bodilie death was the cause of this agonie? recken my sixe causes on your fingers ends, if your memorie be so fickle, that refuting them you can not tell what they are, and see whether Christes bodily death be any of them or no; if it be none, how doth this argument conclude any thing against me, who shew so many things, which might concurre in Christes feare, besides his bodily death? Wherefore your conclusion, if it were good, is no way preiudiciall to me, nor beneficiall to your hell paines. For though Christ feared somewhat els, there is a large leape betweene somewhat els, and the death of the damned. But what was it that Christ willed his Disciples to feare?Christ teacheth all his to feare Gods power, as himselfe did in the garden. Gods purpose meaning to condemne Christians to hell, or his power, that was able to destroy soule and bodie in hell? Did Christ teach in these words a desperation of Gods fauour, or submission vnder the mighty hand of God, and a religious feare not to displease him? To feare religiously, not distrustfully Gods power, since they were

persuaded of Gods goodnesse whom Christ calleth his friends, and so not to prouoke him, considering the mightinesse of his arme, is the summe of Christes doctrine in that place; as God himselfe by the Prophet Esay taught all the faithfull, saying; Esa. 8. 
               Sanctifie the Lord of hosts, and let him be your fear
                     •…
                   and let him be your dread. A deepe impression of this feare commended to all the Elect, whiles heere they liue, Christ himselfe might haue and shew in the Garden, and be farre from doubting his owne saluation and our redemption. So that Christes words doe no way touch your new deuice of hell paines, except by contradicting it. For where Christ sayd, Luke 12. v. 4. 
               I speake to you my friends, 
               vers. 5.

And so where Christ maketh the second death of the damned to come after the death of the bodie, you make in Christ and all his members the second death to go before the first, which is a grosse ouersight as well against order as against trueth; saue that your conceits haue neither order, weight nor measure.

               Here you haue a notable saying in the margent, which must not be forgotten, we must preferre Christs sufferings before all Martyrs, not for his paines, but for his Patience. Not for his paines, but for his Patience? A rare distinction: If you could make vs beleeue, that the greatest patience is tried and discerned, where the smallest paines are, then you said somewhat.] The margin will prooue you fit to play with a feather, and willing to embrace a bable before a better thing. Doe my words there import or intend, that Christs paines were lesse then the paines of Martyrs? Hauing said before as much as I thought good, touching the comparison of Christs paines with other mens, I obserued here that Christs patience in suffering farre passed theirs, whatsoeuer we resolued of his paines. My words were. Sermo. pa. 7. li. 10. 
               Longer torments others haue endured, but neuer greater for the time, nor with like patience. This, as your manner is, you ouerskip, and where I refuse a needlesse contention, what kinds of paines are sharpest here on earth, but auouch Christs patience far exceeded the tolerance of Martyrs, whatsoeuerChrists patience was greater than any mans whatsoeuer his paines were. his paines did; you neither remember what I before auouched, nor what these words inferre, but make your selfe merie with your owne folly. We must preferre, I said, Christs sufferings before all Martyrs, not for his paines, (the exact degree whereof I know not) but for his patience. Doth this hinder, but that Christs paines were equall to any Martyrs sufferings, though I tooke not vpon me to make them sharper, then all the paines, that euer were felt on earth? My words before were plaine enough, greater torments for the time others neuer endured: And if such a Wyer-drawer, as you are; would goe to cafling, which is the sharpest kind of paine, it pertained not much to the purpose, there could be. no question, but Christs patience in his extreame paines did farre excell all mens. Indeede you little regard his patience, for you put him in a maze all confounded and all astonished, where neither obedience nor patience could haue any place: and as for paines you will none other, but the paines of the damned, which passe the patience of men and Angels. Wherefore that I would make men beleeue, the greatest patience is tried in the smallest paines, is a buzzardly deuice of your owne, and howsoeuer I would not contend, whether Christs paines were the sharpest that euer were suffered on earth, yet I before resolued his paines to be as great, as any mans euer were in this mortall body, and his patience to be farre greater and painfuller to him. The reasons whereof I gaue before in my Sermons, though your course be to leape ouer what you list, and to meddle with no more then you may entertaine with a wrest or a iest.
            The eminence of Christs patience aboue all Martyrs I shewed to consist in these two points; in exacter sense, and perfecter obedience at the time of his sufferings, then any man euer had, or could haue. For in others the more violent the tortures,

the sooner they ouerwhelme the sense, and hasten death; but in Christ (whatsoeuer you dreame to the contrarie) there was no confusion, nor corruption of sense; rather when his paines were sharpest, and himselfe weakest; then was his sense as tender, if not tenderer then at any time before. Againe in others, euen in Martyrs, when paine doth passe their strength, the Soule struggleth and striueth to repell or auoyde the paine, which when she cannot conquere, nor resist, she departeth the body. In Christ it was otherwise; when the sharpnesse of paine most fiercely assaulted him, then did his obedience and patience rise to the highest degree. So that nothing in him refused or declined the bitternesse of his paines, nor so much as repined or shrunke at it, but to the vttermost he put himselfe with all submission and patience aduisedly, obediently, and quietly to beare, and endure the greatest rage and excesse of his intolerable torments, which no mans strength or nature can performe. And this I trust toucheth the triall and proofe of Christs patience, and not the inward habite, as you call it; not so much as vnderstanding, that my words concerne the vse, and not the gift of Christs patience. And if I would enterpret my words, as you did Saint Austens a little before, when they contained contraries, not consequents, as mine doe, and so say, Christs sufferings must be preferred before all Martyrs, not for paines (only,) but for patience also, since there could be no vse of patience in Christ without paines: then by your owne interpretation, which in things consequent is very requisite, you haue flowen faire, and seased on a Butterflie.

               By this also we may see how vaine your next coniecture is, that he feared in his Agony corporall castigation aboue his strength. For why may not Martyrs and others feare as much crùeltie and extraordinarie torments at the hands of men, as Christ had cause to doe?] You haue an habite of vnderstanding nothing besides that, which no man vnderstandeth besides your selfe. When I tell you that another thing Sermo. pag. 24. li. 18. 
               which Christ might iustly feare and earnestly pray against, (though his soule were neuer so safe, from the paines of the damned) was the power of Gods wrath to be executed on his bodie: 
               li. 22. 
               for God was armed with infinit vengeance to afflict and punish the bodie about that the humane flesh of Christ was able to endure: You answer, why may not martyrs feare as much at mens

               andes. Wisely forsooth, and as much to the purpose as chalke to make cheese. Why should not Martyrs feare the power of men against their bodies, as much as Christ feared the power of God against his body? If you see not the cause, aske one of the children that dwelleth at next house to you, if they haue learned to know God from men, and they will readily tell you; though my wordes were full enough, but that your head was so emptie, as not to see what I said. God I said, was armed with infinite vengeance to afflict the body aboue that the humane flesh of Christ was able to endure. Are men so armed as God is, euen in this life? I troe not, and therefore are not so to be feared.
            
               Defenc. pag 104 li. 32. 
               Why should the feare of any whatsoeuer meere bodily paines, ouercome Christes patience?] Euen therefore because it was humane, and weake in respect of God, and farre vnable to beare that, which God could impose. [Are not martyrs as far vnable?] Yes farre lesse able, whether it be the hand of God, or of man, which they must feele. [Why then are not they as much afraid?] Of Gods power they are, when and wheresoeuer shewed vnto them, or duely considered by them. As Moses when God Exo. 19. v. 16. 
               lightned and thundred on mount Sinai before the deliuering of the Law, Heb. 12. v. 21 Why Christ feared more than martyrs do. 
               feared and trembled by the Apostles report, as well as the rest of the people. And as for the rage of men, Martyrs first know, that Gods wrath towards them is appeased by Christ Iesus, and therefore they shall feele no more but the hands of men. Secondly, that as the crueltie of humane tortures increaseth, so God either assisteth his seruants by diminishing the bitternesse of their paines, or suffereth their strength or sense to be ouerwhelmed by the furie of their torments, in which case the soule though impatient of such paine doth not sinne, because the violence is greater then mans strength can endure, and thereby driueth the soule from the bodie. With Christ it was otherwise. For where he was to beare our sinnes in his bodie, and had power sufficient in himlefe to decline or frustrate all that men could doe vnto him, when he would; he was

to see that Gods hand might ioyne with the Iewes rage for the punishments of our sinnes in his flesh; and that the sharper the anguish, which he should feele, the exacter the sense thereof which he must haue, and yet must still continue the perfection of his obedience and patience; since no violence of torments, were they neuer so intolerable, might ouerwhelme his sense, or force his soule from his body, but he must expect the time appointed by his Father, when he should in full sense and memorie breath out his soule at an instant, as I haue formerly shewed. He might therefore feare as well the violence, as the continuance of his paines (farre more then Martyrs neede) if he did not deprecate the power of Gods wrath deserued by our sinnes, to be eased euen in his body, where he bare our sinnes. For God was and is able to aggrauate bodily paines farre aboue the strength of mans nature in vs or in Christ, without meanes, or by meanes whatsoeuer. So that Christ desiring this cup, which he now beheld (for THIS doth demonstrate somewhat conceaued in the cup, which he declined) should passe from him, might haue this meaning, that the cuppe should passe from him, and not oppresse his patience, because his flesh was but weake to beare that hea

               ie burden in his body, which our sinnes prouoked; and was heard, as the Apostle noteth of this praier in the garden, and eased of that he seared.
            Christ knew all thinges, you will say, that should befall him.] Then he also knew, what his praier would auert of that punishment which our sinnes deserued: and since it is euident, that greater torments both of soule and body were due to vs fo

               If you meane that he felt greater (paines) concurring in and with the bodily punishment inflicted by the wrathfull hand of God armed with infinite vengeance, then you say well, and we acknowledge it.] If I will mistake fearing for suffering, and bodily for ghostly pains, and the crosse for hell, and make Gods immediate hand a pretence for all these deuices, as you doe, then I say well, as you suppose; but if I make the power of God able to afflict for sinne the Bodie or Soule of man aboue all humane strength without the paines of the damned; and Christ iustly to feare the power of Gods wrath, if he did not by earnest and humble prayer pacifie Gods indignation for as much as exceeded the weaknesse and patience of his manhood, then my coniectures are vaine, though they neuer so well agree with the rules of religion and pietie.

               Your other cause is, for that by death his Body should want awhile the feeling of Gods presence. But did not Christ perfectly know that this was Gods decree and certaine appointment, yea his owne most free will and purpose?] He that once hath vndertaken to wrench the Scriptures from their right sense, will neuer sticke to wrangle with all the world, as long as braine, or breath will giue him leaue. Often enough if that would serue, you haue beene told, that I produced not those foure points, on which you last insisted, as causes of Christs agonie, but as respects of his fearing, disliking, and shunning bodily death; against which you say nothing, but that he could not, he would not so feare it, as to sweate bloud for it. Which sillinesse, if not sottishnesse, still to impugne that, which I doe not affirme, and to post ouer the rest as pertinent to Christs perfection and holinesse, and so no part of his sufferings, is the best ground of your defence: but take any of these foure points, which you so much mislike, and referre them rightly to the end, for which I brought them, or any of the former fiue causes concurring to Christs agonie, and speake directly and truely to any one of them, and you shall be excused for all the rest. But being not able to refute one of them in sound and vpright reasoning. All your shift is, to misapply the respects of

Christs declining death, as if I made them causes of his agonie; and to single the causes, which I auouch might all meete in Christs feare and sorrow in the Garden, as sole and singular efficients of his whole agonie. With this childish Art you haue almost waded by them, not denying, as indeede you cannot, that they were then before Christs eyes, when he feared and sorrowed in the Garden, but that either they were no new things to him, or else parts of his righteousnesse and holinesse. Both which Answeres are very idle. For your hell paines, if that were part of his Passion, were no more newes to his foresight then the rest; and all Christs sufferings euen of your hell paines (if that conceite had any truth in it) were parts of his obedience and patience, as well as his suffering of feare and sorrow, or of bodily death. Wherefore these be but straines and starts to make your Reader beleeue you haue somewhat to say, when indeed your oppositions are so sleight, that they bewray how gladly you would, and how hardly you can distresse any of these causes, which I said might concurre in Christs Agonie. They all were weightie and godly respects impressing no small degrees of feare, sorrow, care and zeale on the Soule of Christ, and directly pertinent to the worke of our redemption now in hand. And where you shift them of as parts of Christs habituall holinesse alwaies resting in him, know you good Sir, that I speake not in this case of the permanent gifts of grace alwaies inherent in Christs Soule, but of the painfull impressions, which those respects did therefore now presently and sensiblie make on the Soule of Christ more then at other times, because they came now to execution, which before were but in cogitation, & by religious and humble praier, he was now to settle the whole course, force, & effects of his sufferings.

               Call you this greater perfection in him than in other men, to pray expressely against the knowne will of his Father, yea against his owne?] That Christ praied against the knowen will of his Father, is an irreligious and dangerous dreame of yours. This Toy you trump in euery where, as if it were some choise Answere, and yet this emptie reason maketh as much against you, as against me, if there were any waight in it. For if Christ did suffer the paines of the damned according to your deuice, was it not his Fathers knowen will he should so doe, yea and his owne also? How then doe the paines of hell excuse him from praying against his Fathers knowen will? [he was so amazed therewith, you will say, that he knew not what he did.] Christ must then be wholy depriued of all vnderstanding, if he neither remembred his Fathers will, nor his owne, nor our saluation, for whose sake he was content to suffer. And how then came he so suddainly in the very next syllable to remember himselfe, and his Fathers will? [He was now freed, you will say, from that astonishment.] How fell he then thrice into it? [he had so many touches of hell paines, which must needs confound all the powers and parts of his body.] Then all the time of his apprehension, examination, condemnation and crucifixion he felt no such thing, since the Gospels beare witnesse, that he wisely, religiously, constantly, carefully, and euery way admirably behaued himselfe in eche word and deede after to the instant of his death; and remembred all things that were written of him. Is not here a fine mockerie, which is the fortresse of all your hidden mysteries; that to prooue your hell paines, you must bring Christ into three such fits and pangs of confusion and obliuion, that he knew not what he said, or did; & presently with the speaking of (YET) to restore him againe to his perfect sense and memorie, and so to free him from all your new deuised Passions? besides your selues, no writer old nor new did euer find in Christs prayer, that he knew not what he said; and the condition added before his prayer, Luke. 22. 
               Father, if thou wilt, take away this Cup from me; and the submission following with the same breath, yet not my will, but thine be done, doe plainely prooue that Christ had exact remembrance and regard of his fathers will, besides that the Apostle affirmeth of this prayer, that Christ

So that if this be all the Scripture you can produce for your hell paines, I protest before God and his whole Church, I will sooner beleeue that you were out of your wits in writing this, then that Christ was forgetfull in praying that, which he spake in the Garden.

               Againe could this thing in any reason be such an horrible griefe vnto him; to haue his flesh lie dead for a day and a few howers, would the thought of this make him sweat bloud for griefe, and to neede an Angell from heauen to comfort him, and to pray three times vehemently, this cup might passe from him? verily it is vnreasonable to thinkeso.

If the cause were not Gods, it might be thought a pastime thus to faine and face; but in so serious questions to vse such idle and false imputations and friuolous refutations, is a griefe to any good mans eares and a corrosiue to his conscience. Of Christes agony, and the causes that might occasion his feare, his sorow, and his zeale in the garden I haue said so much that I am wearie with repeating, though you be neuer weary with resuming the selfe same childish and erroneous mistaking. The reason of my speach is plaine and euident, howsoeuer you take the course rather to misreport it, then refute it. For if the soules of Gods saincts doe by nature vnwillingly leaue their bodies to which they are vnited, though by them they are often molested and burdened; (otherwise death were no punishment of sinne, but a signe of Gods far our which is nothing so) how farre iuster cause then was there, Christ should naturally dislike death not only because it was a subuersion of nature created, & quickned by God, and an effect of Gods displeasure against sinne imposed on all men; but also for that it should during the time depriue him of life, sense and action with great slaunder and infamie, and cheefely should exclude for a season his bodie from that blessed communion and fruition of his diuine grace and glorie, which formerly it felt, though the personall vnion should not be dis

               olued? now the more Christ liked and loued that adherence to God, which he liuing enioied, the more grieuous was the want thereof, which death tooke from him for the time, though it were after restored with greater glory. This I did not put for the cause of his agonie, as you idlely amplifie, but noted it as a respect, that might worthily lead Christ to dislike or abhorre death in respect of his perfection and communion with God aboue all men and Angels, saue for the will of his father, and the good of man, which ouerruled this dislike in him.

And your audacious and presumptuous boldnesse is the more chalengeable, for that you not onely take vpon you to giue the right and exact cause therof out of your owne braine, but you light on such a cause, as hath no foundation in any part of the Scripture, nor any coherence with the

Wherfore I haue not transgressed my directions, when I teach what iust and waighty respects of feare, sorow & zeale our Lord & Sauior had in the worke of our redemption; which might be the causes of that earnest prayer & agonie, and withall shewed the iudgements and opinions of diuers ancient and learned Fathers concerning the same; but you as insolent in your conclusions, as in your conceits, take vpon you to specifie the full and true cause thereof, for which you haue no shew of Scriptures, nor touch of reason.

Wherefore your course is either to misrecite, or to misconstrue all that you bring. In the oblations of the Law, which prefigured the death of Christ, I obserued, that not only the Sacrifice was slaine by the shedding of bloud, but that the person of the Priest was sanctified, as well as the sinner presented by the Priest to God with earnest and humble prayer to make atonement for the trespasse. And since the trueth must haue some resemblance with the figure, Christ might in the Garden performe some points requisite to his Priesthood, as the sanctifying of himselfe with his owne bloud, and presenting his bodie to be the redemption and remission of our sinnes, with most instant and intentiue prayer for the transgressours. This if you simply graunt, as in wordes you say you doe, tell vs now which way you will conclude Christes suffering of hell paines in the Garden from his bloudie sweat? [It hindereth not our assertion. Much lesse doeth it further it: but yet if there might be a cause of Christes voluntarie sprinckling himselfe with his owne bloud, and dedicating it to Gods pleasure for mans redemption besides and without your hellish torments, you will come shorter than you recken, to make good your conclusion.

               The Scriptures which you cite, prooue indeed that Christ now executed his office of Priesthood, but will you diuide and exempt his death on the Crosse from his Priesthood?] Who besides your selfe restraineth Christes euerlasting Priesthood either to the garden or to the crosse? But it was one thing for Christ with feruent and submissiue prayer to present and submit his bodie, which was his Sacrifice, to the will of his Father, as he did in the garden; and another thing, to receiue and admit the violent and wicked hands of the Iewes executing their rage on his bodie with all reproch and crueltie, as he did on the crosse. Now what had his Priesthood to do with the paines of hell, since he was to present and performe the bloudie sacrifice of his bodie prefigured in the Law, which he did in the garden, and on the crosse? And forsomuch as you grant, that Christes bloudy sweat, and his vehement prayers in the garden were pertinents to his Priesthood prefigured in the Law, which indeed isHebr. 5. confirmed by the Apostle, as you can shew no figure of suffering hell paines or the second death in the sacrifices of the Law, no more doth either of these performed in the garden concerne any secret death of the soule, which Christ there suffered from the immediate hand of God.

               Why say you not aswell, that his death and bloudshed on the Crosse shewed in him no paines nor infirmitie, but onely that voluntarily he made himselfe there the true Priest, and performed the prefigured bloudie and deadlie sacrifice for the sinnes of the world? As good reason altogether you haue to say so, as to affirme it of his agonie,] No by your leaue: for Christ did not actually offer two sacrifices; the one ghostly, suffering the paines of hell in the garden, as you imagine; the other bodily and bloudy, yeelding himselfe to the death of the crosse. Heb.

               and we are sanctified by the offering of the body of Iesus Christ once (made). This sacrifice was presented and submitted to Gods will in the garden, but finished and consummated on the Crosse, which could not be without paines and infirmitie belonging vnto death. In the garden, where no Scripture saith Christ died, I admit not the second death nor the paines of the damned, which are thereto consequent. And where you say, I refuse all paines and infirmitie in Christes agonie, it is one of your wonted trueths, which in another were an open lie. I admit not the paines of the damned, or of the second death, til you shew where the scripture teacheth, that Christ suffered two deaths; the first on the Crosse, and the second in the garden, and that afore the first. Otherwise painefull affections of feare and sorow, which were humane infirmities, though voluntarily and religiously receaued by Christ into his soule, I euerie where acknowledge, and with Cyprian make them entrances to his oblation for the sinnes of the world.

Our nature though he tooke in substance, yet the corruption and distemper of our sinfull nature he did not take; and therfore as before our fall the innocency and rectitude, that was in man, could guide and gouerne as well the rising, as the inflaming of his affections; so much more Christ, who besides sincerity from sinne, and libertie from corruption, had the grace and power of Gods spirite aboue measure in his humane nature, could so restraine and represse in himselfe all affections of feare and sorow, that till he was willing, and thought it fitte, they neither did mooue, nor molest his humane flesh, or spirit.

Yet is it contrarie to your Resolution also, yea it is contrarie to the Scripture expressing his feare and vehement sorrowes, and discomfort to haue caused his Agonie.] Your words are of so small waight, that a man would skant spare you Oystershels vpon your credit.

What I say of the one, You more then negligently apply to the other. As for my Resolution Pag. 290. prooue it contrarie to this position (for exposition it is none, since it concerneth the cause of Christs sweate, and not the sense of his words;) and you shall after many failes and follies prooue somewhat. Otherwise if these things in the Garden concerned Christs priesthood, which is mine Assertion in this place, I hope his Priesthood prooueth both his submission to God, to whom he yeelded himselfe obedient and suppliant, and his compassion on man, for whose sake he refused not to make a bloudie and deadly offering of his owne bodie, which is my Resolution in the Page, that you name for a contradiction to this.

               . That Christ in the Garden began to be afraid, and said of himselfe, he was on euery side sorrowfull, and after comfort receaued by an Angell from heauen fell into an agonie of intentiue prayer, in which his sweate was like drops of bloud, this the Scriptures report. What was the direct and particular cause of this feare and sorrow, or for what, after the vision of an Angell from heauen, Christ prayed so earnestly, that his sweate was like bloud, this is the Question in this place. Wherein like some late risen Apostle, you take vpon you to decide, what best sorteth with your error, and proclaime that to be expresse Scripture. But where doth the Scripture expresse, that Christs feare, sorrow, and discomfort caused his Agonie? If they were parts of his agonie, as well as his bloudie sweate, then must there be a cause as well of these, as of the other; and they caused not his bloudie sweate. Now the cause of neither is directly mentioned in the Scriptures. The ScriptureComfort by an Angell and intenti
                     •…
                  e prayer went before Christs bloudie sweate. speaketh of Christs prostration and prayer, of his triple Petition that the Cup might passe from him, of his Disciples heauinesse and neglect to watch with him, of their danger and tentation, of the weaknesse of flesh, as well as of his sorrow or feare. Doth it therefore expresse these to be the causes of his agonie? and how doth the Gospell declare discomfort to haue caused that agonie? because it saith, there appeared to him an Angell from heauen 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , strengthning (or comforting) him? the Angell was not able to inspire any spirituall strength into Christ, that is proper to the spirit of God; neither did the Angell performe the part of an honest neighbour, to perswade Christ with words to be content and patient; these kinds of strengthning and comforting are not tolerable in this place; but by his message from God (for he was Gods messenger comming from heauen,) he declared in all likelihoode, that Christs prayers were heard in that he feared. For so much the Apostle noteth of Christs prayers in the Garden, which in all coherence was the comfort the Angell

brought with him, when he appeared to him in the Garden. Now this comfort would rather asswage his sorrow and feare, then increase it. Yea how could any comfort brought by the Angel cause this agonie? you dreame perhaps Christ would not receaue that comfort, but notwithstanding the Angels comfortable message continued his former agonie, or fell into a worse then before, wherein he sweate bloud. If your dreames be expresse Scripture, then here is all the Scripture you haue, euen your presuming besides the Scripture, or rather against the Scripture. For since the Euangelist affirmeth, Luke. 22. 
               an Angell from heauen, that is from God, appeared comforting him, that is with a comfortable message to him; in all reason his feare and sorrow did now cease; and he fell vpon this comfort receaued as I thinke, not repelled as you imagine, to an agonie, not of feare and sorrow, much lesse of hell paines; but of more vehement prayer, then before, and in that zealous and inflamed prayer, in which he powred forth not onely the strength of his Soule, but the very spirits of his body for desire to preuaile for man against sinne and satan, his sweate was like bloud.

               strengthening him, or comforting him; no doubt with a message from God, which what it was, we do not know, except we applie the Apostles words to this purpose, where he sayth: (Christ) Heb 5. v. 7.

                   did offer vp prayers and supplications with strong crying and teares, to him that was able to saue him from death, AND WAS HEARD IN THAT WHICH HE FEARED. This if we take to be the comfort which the Angell brought from heauen, the Apostle might well intend it. For that Christes prayers were heard, and so much declared to him by an Angell from heauen, could not be but very comfortable to him. If we list not to beleeue this was the Angels message of comfort, then we must confesse, that the comfort which the Angell brought, is vnknowen to man, as the certaine cause of Christes bloudie sweat.
            But whatsoeuer we suppose of the Angels message, there is some difference betwixt S. Lukes words, and those which you cite, as the words next before the text. [not in matter you will say. I speake of the words which you may not alter, when you professe to cite the text whatsoeuer the matter be. [You keepe the meaning of the Euangelist, you thinke.

the text. Your wordes then, hee was in his agonie, are no good translation; and that which is added, but still he was in his agonie, is a violent corruption; for genómenos there doeth not signifie his being, or continuing that which he was before; but his becomming that which he was not before. For example, Gal. 4. v. 4. 
               God sent his Sonne genómenon made of a woman, and genómenon made vnder the law. Doth the word genómenos heere signifie, that Christ was man before he was conceiued of his mother, or rather, that he was made of his mother, which before he was not? and so, made vnder the law, doth not import, that Christ was subiect to the law before he was man, but that being altogether free from the law he would become subiect to the law, which before he was not. Likewise Ioh. 1. v. 14.

            An agonie (you will say) you vse for all Christes affections and actions in the garden.] But so doth not S. Luke; he referreth the word to Christes more ardent prayers, and to his bloudie sweat. If we speake abusiuely, an agonie may be taken for feare, as I haue formerly shewed; or if defectiuely we name one part for the whole, whichHow some vse the word Agonie. some men vse to auoid length of speech, and the number of particulars; then Christs agonie may stand to note all his affections, actions and supplications in the garden: but if we speake properly, as there is no cause nor proofe S. Luke should heere do otherwise, then Christes agonie both by the proprietie of the Greeke word, and by the circumstances of the text, was that vehement contention of minde, wherewith Christ prayed 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                
               more feruently than before, being now strengthened or comforted by the Angels appearing and message, and euen powred forth his spirit to God with so zealous affection, that his sweat was like bloud. This you would crosse by your corrupt translation, in saying, BVT STILL he was in his agonie, though the words of the Euangelist doe not import, that he continued still any former agonie, but vpon the strength and comfort receiued by the Angell, he fell into an agonie of most vehement desire to preuaile in the worke of our redemption, and to remooue all impediments, for which he vsed so strong cries and teares, that his sweat was coloured like bloud.
            All these things you venture to determine by your owne authoritie, as if the Scriptures were vnder your command, and little thinke, that wise and godly Readers will censure your licentious intrusion on the Scriptures as it deserueth. Neither can you cease for ought that I see: for as you affirme that which our Sauiour assumed vpon the Angels message, to haue possessed him before at his entrance into the garden; so the words which he spake before any prayer in the garden, and much more before the appearing of the Angel, you make consequent to his bloudie sweat. Your handsome and holie translation and exposition is, Defenc. pag. 107. li 3. 
               but still hee was in his agonie, and sweat like droppes of bloud trickling to the ground: and presently sayth, My soule is full of sorrowes to death. Where you commit two notable falsifications euen of the Scripture it selfe.The D
                     •…
                  fender addeth to Saint Luke that which he neuer wrote, and leaueth out that which he wrote. For first these words, My soule is full of sorrowes euen to death, are not in S. Lukes Gospell, whence you would seeme to cite them, as presently sayd after Christes bloudie sweat. Next you peruert both the other Euangelists, in which these words are written: for both Matthew and Marke, which witnesse the speaking of those words, precisely record, that they were spoken to Christes three Disciples before he departed at first from them to pray in secret, and before he began to expresse any desire, that the cuppe might passe from him. Reade the texts, they keepe almost the same wordes.

When Christ had sayd to the rest of his Disciples, Mar. 14. v. 32 
               Sit you here till I haue prayed, 
               33. 
               he tooke Peter, and Iames, and Iohn, and he began to be afrayd, and in great heauinesse; 
               34. 
               and sayd vnto them: My soule is very heauy vnto death: tary here and watch. 
               35. 
               So he went forward a little, and fell downe on the ground, and prayed that if it were possible, that houre might passe from him. You turne all vpside downward, and tell vs out of S. Luke, that still Christ was in his agonie and sweat like droppes of bloud, and presently sayth, My soule is full of sorrowes euen to death. With such additions, translations, and corruptions against the circumstances described in the Scriptures, some doubt may chance to creepe at a creuie into some mens consciences touching the cause of Christes agonie, but your pains of the damned are not one iot the neerer for all your inuerting & peruerting the Euangelists words to your will. For what if Christ did sweat bloud at first, which the Gospell referreth to the last, doth that giue entrance to the second death and torments of the damned? Are not the paines of this life able to make men sweat bloud, but you must runne to hell for the lake that burneth there with fire and brimstone, before mans body may colour his sweat with the shew of bloud? Is it harder for Christ to resolue his bloud into sweat by zeale without paines, or with bodilie paines, whiles he was liuing, than when he was dead to send out of his side, first Ioh. 13 v. 34. 
               bloud, and then water, so distinctly and miraculously the one after the other, that S. Iohn confirmeth it with his owne vers. 35.

               Defenc. pag. 106. li. 35. 
               Though it be against the common course of our nature for any paines or feare to sweate bloud: yet the diuine power with and through paines and feares might wring out of his body that trickling bloudy sweate. As it is plaine that it did by the wordes next before in the text, an Angell came to giue him some comfort.] Your head was troubled about some waighty worke, when one sentence wrang from you such contrarieties and falsities. But the Pag. 105. li. 38. Page before, you tooke speciall exception against me, if I did not thinke, that Christ was vrged to his bloudy sweate (for thereof you speake in that place) by violence of paines, or feare procuring it in him NATVRALLY; here you say, it is against the common course of our nature for any paines or feare to sweat bloud. Could it be naturally procured in Christ, and yet against the common course of our nature? againe if it be against the common course of our nature for any paines or feare to sweate bloud, by what reason or authority doe you conclude hell paines out of Christes bloudy sweate? for if no paines or feare can by the course of our nature procure a bloudy sweate, how know you that Christ did sweate bloud for paines or for feare? for hell paines, you will say, he might.] Not by any course of our nature. For then all his members which at one time or other feele the like, which Christ felt, should sweate bloud, as Christ did. But that I trust is sensiblely false. [The diuine power might wring it out of his body.] So it may raise Children to Abraham out of stones. Doth that inferre, that men are made of stones? and might not the diuine power wring this sweate (for that is your phrase) out of Christes bodie as well without hell paines, as with them? is it hard for God to make a man sweat bloud without the paines of the damned? [It is plaine that it did by the words next before in the text.] Doth the text name hell paines, or the feare of hell? what will you not aduenture, that thus presume to outface the Scriptures? the text nameth many thinges before, and you like your crafts-master will make your choise, though the Scripture doe not expresse, what was the cause thereof. [The words next before the text are an Angell came to giue him comfort.] Then comfort belike cast him into this bloudy sweate, if the wordes next before declare the cause thereof; which were very strange, that a man by comfort should be cast into a bloudy sweate. Why may not I rather say that the vision of an Angell put him rather into this sweate, then the comfort, which was brought him, since Daniel was Dan. 8. v. 27. 
                  stroken sicke and astonished with a vision, as diuers others of Gods saints haue beene? yet I thinke neither of these to be the cause of that sweate, but as I say in my Sermons, it might be voluntary either for signification, as Austen, Prosper, Bede, and Bernard do thinke; or for sanctification and consecration of his person and sacrifice answeareable to the manner of the legall oblation prefiguring this as the trueth; or for vehement contention of spirit in praier, which

indeed is the next thing mentioned before his sweate, and shewed his desire and zeale to be more then humane for the Redeeming and reconciling of man to God by the shedding of his bloud.
            
            
               Defenc. pag. 106. li. 27. 
               You conclude that Christes agony demonstrating Christs Priesthood must not rise from the terror of his owne death; and yet a little before you openly confesse and graunt, that his agony did rise from the feare of his death.] The effect of Christes Priest-hood performed in the garden must in no wise concerne himselfe. For he was not a Priest to make intercession, or to offer sacrifice for himselfe, but for vs. And therefore his praiers then vttered in his agonie with strong cries and teares, if they pertained to his Priesthood, they were made for vs, and not for himselfe; and declared his voluntarie profering and presenting his body and bloud to Gods pleasure, to be the sacrifice for mans Redemption, and his feruent supplications to haue it accepted as the full Ransome for his elect, that the accuser and supplanter of his Church might be remooued from Gods presence, and wholy subiected vnder Christes feete. Now if this desire and offer for vs must not only be voluntarie, but inflamed with wonderfull vehemencie, then would not Christ sweat bloud for any terror of his owne death, but for his infinite feruency to preuaile and obtaine his petition for vs. You permix Christes feare, and his feruent zeale together, and call the whole action his agonie, though it containe both feare conceaued at first, when he approched Gods presence in iudgement for sinne, and comfort receaued at last by message brought from Heauen, and out of this confusion you collect what you list, and say what you please to no purpose. That Christ might haue a naturall feare of death, I then said, and yet see no cause to recall it; but that I said Christ did sweate bloud for feare of his bodily death, this is one of your painted faces with which you would outface the trueth. Howbeit this persisting in your ignorant folly without remembring or regarding what is said on the other side, argueth ridiculous negligence, or malitious diligence: of which because I haue already spoken, I will say no more.
            
               Defenc. pag. 106. li. 33. 
               Why should Hilarie deny, that Christes bloudy sweat came of infirmity? or Austen, that Christes feare and perturbation was of infirmity?] Because they had learned iudgments, and sober considerations in these matters, which you want. They beheld Christes power, which no force of hell or Satan could impeach, but where and when himselfe would permit. They saw the innocencie and integrity of Christes humane nature, which could not be tossed nor troubled with inward affections, but when and how farre he was content to admit them. They knew the infinite loue of God to his son, for whose sake we were all beloued and adopted; and that the father was so farre from tormenting the soule of his sonne with his immediate hand, that Iohn 17. 
               he gaue him power ouer all flesh, and 
               Iohn 13. 
               gaue all things into his hands euen before his death, and against the time of his agony in the garden. Wherefore as the Iohn 14. 
               Prince of this world had nought in him, and for that cause neither sinne nor corruption were found in him; and Iohn 10. 
               no man tooke his soule from him, but he laid it downe of himselfe; so neither necessity nor infirmitie of our nature could oppresse or possesse him, but he must first giue place to it by his will, and guide it by power, that in all as well sufferings, as doings, he might be obedient, and yet righteous. And had they heard such a ghest, as you are, tell them a tale of Gods Defenc. pag. 106. li. 38. 
               diuine power wringing out of Christes body a bloudy sweat, they would haue rung you another manner of Peale. For what is wringing, but violent forcing? and what is violence, but inuoluntary constraint, which is any thing rather then obedience? and so where the Apostle professeth of Christ, that he was obedient euen vnto death, you haue spied out that Christes bloudy sweat was WRVNG from him, and so no part of his willing and free submission and obedience vnto God.
            
               Defenc. pag. 107. li. 12. 
               Where they say, Nec infirmitas quod potestas gessit, that prooueth the cleane contrarie: for ideo & infirmitas quia potestas gessit. For the working of his power in him argueth the suffering of his infirmity. The power of God is perfited in infirmity.] If you would ascribe neither Religion, nor learning to two such Pillars of Christes Church, as Hilarie and Austen were, you should at least leaue them common in sight and vnderstanding

of their owne wordes. It is enough for a man of your sise to lacke learning, trueth, and sense. They were very learned and wise, or els the whole Church, that hath hitherto esteemed and receaued them for such, was much deceaued. But you, that haue found a new faith in the Scriptures, no maruaile if you catch the fathers with contrarieties, which others neuer drempt of. The ground of their wordes is the cleare rule of reason, nature, and trueth, confirmed in heauen, earth and hell: that contraries in one and the same subiect, time, and respect doe exclude one another. As if any thing be cold, it is not hoate; if it be drie, it is not moist; if it be straight, it is not crooked; and so if it be weake, it is not strong. Hence they conclude, if there could be in Christ no compulsion to feare and sorow, then was there election; if no necessity, then liberty; and consequently if no preualence of corruption against his fullnesse of trueth and grace, then it was not infirmity, that subiected him to these violent and painfull affections, but it was his will and power, that raised and restrained them in him selfe. Against this what saith our master of new maximes? [nay it was therefore infirmitie, because power did it.] This indeed crosteth their sayings, but withall it crosseth all trueth, if you take their wordes, as they spake them. [But you meane, as your marginer noteth therefore there was infirmity, because
               x Defenc pag. 107. ad marginem. li. 3. 
               there was power.] He can neuer shoot amisse, that neuer offreth to any marke. Where was there infirmity, & where was there power? in the person of Christ? belike Hilary and Austen did not know, that Christ was God and man, and had in his person both the infinite power of God, and the voluntarie weaknesse of man, that being compared with his Godhead might well be called infirmity: as the Apostle sai
                  •…
               th, Christ was crucisied concerning (his) infirmity, that is, in the weaknesse of his flesh, but yet that voluntary weaknesse of God, or in God the sonne, was stronger then all the power of men or of Diuels, whom his manhood spoiled, and caried captiues, with an open triumphe. This is not their meaning to say, that Christ had no infirme part in his person, compared with his diuine power, that is no manhood, but only his Godhead; and therefore your reply to that purpose is as senselesse, as it is needlesse.
            
               Where Christes diuine power did punish, there his humane infirmity did suffer.] This is your wresting of their wordes against their meaning, to bring them to your compasse, but this is no part of their speech. That weaknesse is patient, where power is agent, this may be; but what is that to their words, which are very true without your punishing power? Hilarie sayth, Hilar. de Trinitate. li. 10. 
               To sweat bloud is against nature, and so not a weaknesse in nature. Since then it was aboue nature to sweat bloud, he ascribeth it to Christes will and power performing that in his bodie, which nature could not do. Ibidem.

What madnesse is this (here you, Sir Defender, how he requiteth you for peruerting the trueth of his words) by refusing the faith of the Apostles doctrine, to change the sense of religion, and to impute all that to the imbccillitie and contumelie of (Christes) nature, which was (his) will, and a mysterie, yea power, considence and victory? And againe, lest you should thinke he wanted reason for his speech: Ibidem.

                   ad mortem. With what faith, I aske, is (Christ) assirmed to be naturally weake, to whom it was naturall to heale all mans infirmities? Happely by a foolish and wicked peeuishnesse he is therefore presumed to be of a weake nature, because his soule was sorrowfull vnto death. This ground of his speech is short, but sure, except you will deride Christ, and say, Luke 4. 
               Physician heale thy selfe; or blaspheme him with the Pharises, and say as they sayd; Matth. 27. 
               He saued others, he can not saue himselfe. It was then in Christ not want of power to represse these passions, or repell these infirmities, that subiected himselfe vnto them, it was his owne willing obedience, that would taste them, and power that did guide them, lest they should breake into the distemper and excesse of our corrupt nature.
            
            
               The power of God, you say, is perfected in infirmitie.] Those words I trust were not spoken of Christ; and howsoeuer in some sort they may be verified of Christ, yet is there no comparison betwixt our naturall infirmitie, and his fulnesse of trueth and grace. Esa. 11. 
               The spirit of counsell and trueth rested on him 
               Iohn 3. 
               without measure: wee wholly want it, till Gods power in some degree confirme our infirmitie. Againe, infirmitie in these words doth signifie outward afflictions and miseries: for so the Apostle there expoundeth it: 2. Cotin. 12. vers. 10. 
               Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproches, in necessities, in persecutions; for when I am (outwardly) weake, then I am (inwardly) strong. So that those words can not rightly be referred to inward infirmitie; and might they, yet Christes gifts and graces of the Holy Ghost were not only farre aboue Pauls, but in the greatest degree that any creature might haue them, and greater than all the gifts of men and angels. How then doth it follow, that Christ was weake, because Paul was weake? Yea, if Pauls weaknesse were perfected by Christes power, as Paul himselfe confesseth in that place; Ibid. vers 9. 
               Very gladly will I reioyce in mine infirmities, that the power of Christ may dwell in me; then from those words Christes power is prooued, and not his infirmitie. But take it which way you will, though this be the trueth which I haue tolde; these wordes doe nothing hinder Hilaries and Austens confession, that Christes infirmitie was voluntarie, where ours is necessarie; and so infirmitie in him was not for want of strength, but for merit of righteousnesse, and was both receiued and directed by his will and power. And where you are so often on the hoigh to impaire S. Austens credit with yours, you shall do well to get you some more vnderstanding in him, before you rush so rashly against him, left if it come to the ballance, whether you or S. Austen be in an errour, you finde few friends so fauourable, that will forsake him to follow you. His resolution, which you may put off with pride, but you shall neuer refute with reason, is this: August. de ciuitate Dei. li. 14. ca. 9.

We haue these affections (of feare and sorow &c.) by the infirmitie of mans condition, but the Lord Iesus had them not so, whose infirmitie was of his owne power. Wherefore the Lord, when he vouchsafed to leade an humane life in the forme of a seruant, but vtterly void of all sinne, admitted those affections, when he saw it fit to admit them. And in the Gaspell, when those things are reported of him, as that he wept when he was about to raise Lazarus, and that his Passion approching, his soule was sorrowfull vnto death; these things are not falselie written of him, but he admitted these motions in his humane minde for certaine purposes, euen when he would, as when he would he was made man.

               I iudge their very meaning to be, that here appeared not Christs infirmitie onely in suffering, but his diuine power also in punishing, and this they speake fully for vs, and against you.] If you make them speake that they neuer ment, they may chance to speake with you; but leaue them to expresse their owne minds, and then they neither speake, nor meane with you. But what is the reason, they so soone speake with you, where not fiue lines before you controled their speech, as repugnant to the truth? haue you now by your glozes made them lyers like your selfe? you should at least be more constant, if not more prudent, then first to chalenge in their speech a contrarietie to the truth, and then to claime a conformity to their sense. They ment no such thing, as you make shew of, but they speake of Christs power, which stirred and gouerned his affections, as he thought good, that they might declare him a true man, and yet be parts of his obedience, and submission to his Father, though withall they were religious and voluntarie. For as he emptied and humbled himselfe, so he weakned and troubled himselfe, when he saw time; not for want of power, but of purpose so disposing and despensing

his affections, that by his vertue he might moderate them in his owne person, and cure them in ours.

It did not signifie this, but it did it indeede.] If their opinions of Christs bloudyChrists bloudie sweate might hau

Why Christ sent out of his side, after his body was dead, first bloud, and then water, can any man giue the reason? Saint Austen saith, August. in Iohan. tract. 15. 
               De latere pendentis in cruce, lancea 
                     〈◊〉
                  , sacramenta ecclesiae profluxerunt. Out of Christs side pearced with a speare, as he hanged on the crosse, the Sacraments of the Church issued forth. What warrant had he so to say? the Scripture doth not vouch so much; and yet the Church of God hath euer since regarded, and receaued that speech of his. So for Christs bloudy sweate, finding no reason deliuered in the Scripture, he descended to the signification, which might be thereof, that Christ by sweating bloud in his whole naturall body, foreshewed the martyrdomes of his mysticall body, the Church. You aske for a Reason.] The resemblance is euident, and the performance consequent; greater reasons then which cannot be giuen of significations. You like it not.] No maruaile; nothing pleaseth you besides the wringing out of this sweate by the diuine power punishing. You haue neither proofe, nor truth for your second death to be suffered at this time, and in this place; and yet you would haue your absurd conceits preferred before Saint Austens iudgement. It was aboue the course of nature, you grant; and since it was not naturall, it must be miraculous, if not mysticall. Now if it were a miracle, there may no reason be required of it, but it must be left to the power and will of the doer. To what end Christ did it, if you like neither Austens, Prospers, Bedes nor Bernards iudgements in this case, know you any man so vnwise, as to like yours?
            You say, it did not signifie the purging of the earth from sinne, it did it indeede.] Did the bloudie sweate of Christ in the Garden purge indeed all his Church in the whole world from sinne? what needed then his death and passion afterward on the Crosse? what needed his body be giuen for them, and his bloud to be (violently) shed for remission of sinnes, if this sweate did indeed purge all our sinnes? but you speake in this, as you doe in all other things, without caring what you say, so you bring somewhat to continue your cauilling. This sweate the Apostle calleth Heb. 5. 
               teares, and ioyneth them with Christs vehement prayers in the garden, which he saith were heard. Then Christs feruent desire to preuaile in the worke of our redemption against all the hinderances thereof, might in all reason mooue him to pray with teares, respecting our miserie, and yet indignitie, for whom he prayed; and so be the cause of this bloudie sweate: and your hell paines must giue place, till you find some better proofe for them, then your bare auouching, that this sweate might rise from the very paines of the damned, which is your single supposall with farre lesse warrant, then any thing that Austen, Prosper, Bede or Bernard said. And as for your binding all their significations and your imaginations in a bundell together; when you first prooue, that the Scriptures affirme any such thing, as the second death, or the paines of the damned to be suffered by Christ, then we will talke what might rise from your hell paines; in the meane time know you Sir wanderer, that if the rest might be the causes of this bloudie and voluntarie sweate, then you may put vp your pen, and lay your vnquiet head to rest.

               Hitherto we haue made it manifest that in truth you haue nothing in all these words against

our Doctrine, that paines and sorrowes were the true and proper cause of Christs dreadfull agonie; nor to prooue that his meere bodily paines or death was the whole cause. Now we are to shew the like in his most wofull complaint on the crosse: where he saith, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me.] And I haue made it more manifest, that you haue lesse for your doctrine of the second death and the paines of the damned to be suffered in the Soule of Christ, whiles he prayed in the Garden. For what reasons be these; Christ feared and sorowed in the Garden, and he prayed so intentiuely that his sweate was like bloud: ergo, he suffered the second death and the paines of the damned: except a man were disposed to run madde with reason? [He feared somewhat else besides a meere bodily death.] What then? how many degrees and causes of feare and sorow haue I shewed, that might conioyne in Christ now seeing in Gods presence and iudgement the waight of our redemption, and the number of our sinnes, together with the vengeance prouoked by them, and the power of Gods anger displeased with them, and yet no point nor part of the second death to be suffered by him? if there might be any cause besides yours, then yours can neuer be certainly concluded from the Scripture, which is the thing I first affirmed to the Reader. You aske me where I reade mine in the word of God, and I aske you the like. The Text saith, Christ feared and sorrowed, but the cause of Christs feare or sorrow is not there declared.

And where you promise to shew the like in Christs complaint on the Crosse, I easily beleeue, you will performe the one, as well as you did the other, by your owne fansies without all regard of truth or proofe.

What haue I to doe with your vntidie deuices wynoing words as men doe chaffe to and fro without any manner or offer of proofe? The question I did and doe aske, is; not what you parle out of your owne platforme, but how you can prooue by the word of God, that forsaking in this complaint of Christs was either damnation, or the second death, which your Reader perceaueth now to be your purpose, though you long dissembled it. Your interlacing those words with qualified phrases serueth but to saue you from apparent heresie and blasphemie. It maketh no manner of proofe, that those words must so be vnderstoode, or that the paines of the damned may thence by any colour be concluded. [Ibid. li. 3

               I plainly shewed you before, if you had regarded it.] And I more plainly opposed those things against it, which you neither did, nor can answere: and doe you thinke, that neglecting what you list, I must be forced laboriously to disprooue all your deuices, before you shew what dependence they haue with the Sacred Scriptures, or with the primatiue faith of Christes Church? my grounds excluding your exposition and conclusion, are to be seene in my Sermons pag. 32. 33. and are such, as you shall neuer defeate. The first is, that dereliction and forsaking doe no where throughout the Scriptures import damnation, or the second death, which is your drift in this place; but are alwaies applied to the iudgements of this life. The second, that in the wicked castawaies it argueth reprobation from grace, and desperation of glory, which if any man imagine of Christ, it is rather furious blasphemie, then erroneous follie. Thirdly, that in the godly the word vsed by Christ noteth either destitution of help, or diminution of comfort in time of trouble; but neither in Dauid, who first spake them; nor in Christ doe they with any shew conclude the true paines of the damned. Fourthly, that no construction must be made of this word, that may decrease in Christ

the fulnesse of truth and grace, which neuer wanted in his Soule, or draw him within the compasse of erroneous mistrusting or mistaking Gods fauour & counsell towards him. These grounds standing good, which you shall neuer be able to remooue, your warbling with those words to make them pliable to your will, is but time and paines lost; wind them which way you can, by example of any Scripture you shall neuer wrest them to that height, which you desire. But because you are so far in loue with your owne fansies, and my leasure now serueth me better then it did before, let vs heare what kinde of forsaking you would faine fasten to Christes complaint on the Crosse.
            
               Defenc. pag. 108. li. 1. 
               Christ being now in the feeling of infinite paines inflicted on him sundry waies, and that directly from Gods proper wrath for our sinnes, he felt his whole humane Nature for the time left all comfortlesse and alone, without any ioyous assistance of his Deitie.] Doe you enforce all this from the word for saking, or would you adde it to those words, which Christ spake? either way your ignorance or impudence is cleare and manifest. For if you dare adde so many circumstances of so great importance to those words, you are not a tolerable expounder, but a notable peruerter of Christs words. If you would conclude so much from the word, you shew your selfe most ridiculous against all the rules of Diuine Doctrine, and humane sense to deduce all those sequels from that one word. For neither infinite paines, nor from Gods proper wrath, nor in Christs whole humane Nature, nor all comfortlesse are necessarie consequents to that word; and yet graunt all these, so farre as any truth or experience conuinceth them to be felt in this life, they no way amount to the second death, or to the true paines of the damned, which is the thing you should and would inferre from this complaint.
            
               Defenc. pag. 108. li. 7. I meane his Godhead as it were withdrawing and hiding it selfe from him, for that season of his Passion gaue him no sense nor feeling of ease, comfort, or ioy.] Your owne mouth testifieth against you, that you doe not expound, but corrupt the Scriptures to serue your conceits. Begin with the last. Doth not the Apostle in plaine words say, that Christ Heb. 12. 
               for the ioy set before him endured the Crosse? Who could set any ioy before him in that case, but God alone? then apparantly did his Godhead set before him assurance of ioy, and that euerlasting in the highest degree, which was so great, that it led him with patience to endure the Crosse. [He had no present feeling thereof, you will say.] So you must say, or else in exact words you shew your selfe to contradict the spirit of God. But if God did propose it, and Christ did most certainly know it, and expect it; had faith and hope in him no present sense nor feeling? had not Christ farre certainer and fuller knowledge and sight of Gods presence, fauour, and promises, then any faith or hope in vs can haue? Rom. 5. 
               If then we reioyce vnder the hope of glory, did not he? did not he know, that he 
               Luke 24. 
               was to suffer those things, and (so) to enter into his glory; when he called them fooles, and slow of hart, that beleeued not all that the Prophets haue spoken by the spirit, 1. Peter 1. 
               forewitnessing the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow? Did the spirit of God by Dauid beare false witnesse, when he said of Christ, and in Christs person; I 
               Acts 2. 
               beheld the Lord alwaies before me at my right hand, that I should not be shaken; therefore did mine hart reioyce, and my toong was glad, and my flesh shall rest in hope? Ease from paine he felt none; ne would he feele, till by death he determined his sufferings, but comfort in his afflictions he could not want, because he was not onely patient and obedient to the will of God, and so not void of comfort, when he had done the will of God, to receiue his promises; but euen in the midst of his sharpest paines he saw the counsell of God for his glorification, and our redemption; and beheld God as his Father most highly pleased with him, though iustly displeased with our sinnes, the smart whereof he must feele in his flesh.
            That therefore Christes whole humane Nature on the Crosse was all comfortlesse and alone, is false doctrine, and repugnant not onely to the words of Dauid, that Christ Psal. 16. 
               beheld God alwaies at his right hand, that he should not be mooued; but euen to the manifest assertion of Christ himselfe, who said to his Disciples, Iohn 16. 
               the houre is come,

that you shall be scattered, and leaue me alone; but I am not alone, for the Father is with me. Now if God were alwaies present with Christ, that he should not be shaken, God was alwaies well pleased with him. Yea God was ioyned to him, not ingrace alone, as he is with vs, but in nature and person, as he is with no man else nor Angel. If then we haue comfort from Gods grace and spirit in our afflictions, how much more did consolations abound in Christ, euen as sufferings did? for since God is 2. Cor. 1. 
               the God of all comfort; who comforteth vs in all our troubles, that as the sufferings of Christ abound in vs, so our consolation (should) abound through Christ; how is it possible, Christ should comfort vs, if he were himselfe all comfortlesse in his paines? shall we deriue that from him, which he had not? or rather is it impietie so much as to thinke, that any inward comfort wanted vnto Christ, who was personally vnited to God, and on whom the Esa. 11. 
               Spirit of God rested, (that is alwaies continued with all fulnesse of grace and truth) Esa. 11. 
               euen the spirit of wisedome, and vnder standing, the spirit of counsell and strength, the spirit of knowledge, and of the feare of the Lord? If this spirit neuer departed from him, he could want neither peace nor ioy in the holy Ghost, and so no comfort incident to mans nature afflicted, as he then was, and would be; yea that was the least degree of his comfort, which was common to him with vs, who yet deriue all our comfort from him: he had the nearest, surest, highest, and plentifullest spring of comfort in his owne person, that any creature was capable of. To make therefore his whole manhood all comfortlesse without any inward peace or ioy from Gods spirit, is a detestable doctrine, subuerting the communion of both Natures in Christ, and so dissoluing the vnion of his person, if neither part of his humane nature had any sense or feeling of his Godhead.
            
               Defenc. pag. 108. li. 5. 
               I say not he wanted now all assistance of his deitie.] If he wanted peace and comfort in the holy Ghost, if he had no longer any certaine knowledge, nor vnderstanding of his fathers will, and if he felt inwardly in his humane soule no perswasion, apprehension, nor expectation of his fathers presence, fauour, and promises; tell me what assistance he had of his Godhead, when all these things failed in him? [ioious assistanceChrist found no ioy in his p

                  ine, but comfort in his hope. he had none.] Is it fit for such a wrangler, as you are, first to dishonour the sufferings of Christ with the leauen of your fansies, and then to sprinkle them with the holy water of your Phrases? how often hath it beene told you, that for obedience to the will of his father, the sonne of God would vse no power to repell his paines, nor to diminish his sense thereof, but only patience, whereby we might be assured, that he felt his afflictions on the Crosse with quicker sense and greater paines, then we are able with any patience to endure? And is this all that now you would say, that Christ found no ioy in his paines? what Cow-keeper doth not know, that paine is paine, and not ioy? but was Christes paine such that it excluded his soule from the remembrance or sense of all Gods graces so richly powred on him, and promises so faithfully made vnto him? you were best come in with your mooueable fittes of astonishment, and tell vs that in one and the same sentence, when Christ said, My God, my God, he was in full and perfect assurance and assistance of Gods fauour, whom els he could not call his God, if he felt no comfort in him, that is the God of all comfort; and when he pronounced the next syllable, why, he presently fell into a sudden pangue, where he was forsaken, and left all comfortlesse and alone according to your deuices. And if any man be so wise, to let you lead him through such thornes, as to graunt in Christ on the Crosse sometimes hope of glorie, and sometimes feare of confusion, sometimes comfort and suddainly distrust of his saluation, sometimes Gods fauour and full assistance, as in affliction, and by and by the second death and the paines of the damned; he may dally with faith and infidelity, with heauen and hell, with Christ and Beliall as you doe. But if it were not possible for Christ crucified, being the wisdome and power of God, to be tossed and tumbled with such contrarie blasts, then hath the forsaking, which he complained of, an other manner of sense, then you imagine.
            And whatsoeuer meaning you ascribe vnto it, you may not with a word, that admitteth diuers interpretations, impugne the plaine and open wordes and deeds of our

Sauiour, in which is no question. As when the high Priest asked him, Mar. 14. 
               art thou Christ the sonne of the blessed? Iesus said I am; and ye shall see the sonne of man sit at the right hand of power, and come in the cloudes of heauen. And when the Theefe, that was crucified with him, said vnto him; Luc. 22. 
               Lord remember me, when thou comest into thy kingdome; he answeared, Verily I say vnto thee, to day shalt thou be with me in Paradise. As also breathing out his soule, he said, Ibidem. 
               Father into thine hands I commend my spirit. If to be the sonne of God, and to sit at Gods right hand in glory, if to dispose of Paradise at his pleasure, and to commit his spirit into his Fathers hands, be no signes nor proofes of comfort and ioy, then let your exposition beare some shew: but if these be more then arguments of most excellent honour and glory, not onely reserued for him, and confirmed vnto him, but assumed and professed by him, euen when he was condemned and crucified; who that had any care of trueth, or respect to reason, would auouche, that Christs Defenc. pag. 108. li 9.

This is your yarne, which you would faine weaue into the Apostles words, but truth and falshood haue no fellowship; no more haue your dreames and the Apostles doctrine. As much it maketh for you, that God spared not his owne sonne, but gaue him for vs all, whence you may as well conclude, that God adiudged his sonne to euerlasting destruction and damnation, for that were indeed not to spare him, as that he inflicted on him the true paines of hell, least he should seeme to spare him. The Apostles wordes expound themselues; God spared not his sonne, but gaue him for vs; This giuing him into the hands of sinners for our sakes was Gods not sparing him, otherwise that God spared him in nothing, which either his power was able to impose, or our sinnes did deserue, this is doctrine for him that meaneth to be an Apostata from all faith and trueth, to set the father at as great enmity with his sonne, as our sinnes did deserue, or could prouoke. The higth of Christs not sparing himselfe was, as the Apostle teacheth, his obedience vnto the death of the Crosse; if you will haue Christs obedience stretch to the second death of the damned, you must get you some new Scriptures; these that are already written, witnesse no such thing.

               This forsaking or dereliction beseemeth the time, place, person and cause of Christ our ransome payer, and purchaser of saluation with the price of his owne most direfull paines: not any other farre fet, or hardly applied, and strangely deuised by the braines of men. As i

But if you so much despise their learning, religion, and iudgements, who were Gods blessed instruments to maintaine his trueth against all heresies, and his Church against all Schismaticks, and thinke your braines to be more than the braines of a man; take heed lest your Reader begin to suspect you haue the braines of some other kinde. If Athanasius, Hilarie, Chrysostome, Basil, Cyrill, Epiphanius, Ierome, Ambrose, Augustine, Origen, Tertullian and Leo may not be thought, in the verdict of any wise or sober man, as likely to vnderstand the sense of Christes words on the crosse, as your humorous and presumptuous, shall I say braine, which you so much abase in others, or head without braine; then I must confesse my fault, who loue not to leane to mine owne wit in cases of faith, but rather preferre the religious and laborious inquiries of others, chiefly of learned and ancient Fathers, where it concerneth matters of saluation, and the grounds of Christian religion, which they carefully receiued, and faithfully deliuered to Gods people so many hundred yeeres before we were borne. And what ma

               uell you be so bolde with the braines of men, as you terme it, when you take vpon you to ouerrule the words of the Holy Ghost? For where in the sacred Scriptures the bloud of Christ shed for vs, is recorded to be the true price of our redemption, you controlling as well the Apostles as the Fathers, tell vs here that Christ Pa. 108. li. 23. 
               purchased our saluation with the price of his most direfull paines; where by direfull paines you meane hell paines, that your speech in this case may be as new as your faith. Belike then in your conceit Peter, Paul, and Iohn, though Christes Apostles, were neuer well Catechised nor instructed in their faith, since they affirme, 1. Pet. 1. 
               we were redeemed by the precious bloud of Christ, and 
               Ephes. 1. 
               we haue redemption in Christ through his bloud, and Christ 
               Reuel. 5. 
               by (his) bloud redeemed vs vnto God; which lesson you like not, and therefore you say our saluation was purchased with the price of Christes direfull paines, that is, of hell paines suffered in the soule of Christ; which hath no bloud, vnlesse you can as easily deuise new bloud for Christes soule, as you haue done a new hell for Christs sufferings. Till you so do, giue me and other Christians leaue to thinke, that the second death which you dreame of, did neither beseeme the time, place, person nor cause of Christ our Redeemer, and therefore his words on the crosse could haue no such reference, as you haue riddled in this place.

               Your expositions are sixe in number; the first is, that when Christ on the crosse cried out, My God my God why hast thou forsaken me, by this word ME he should meane his Church: for which you haue no reason in the world, but the bare names of Austen, Leo, Athanasius.] The moe the senses may be of these words, and euery of them agreeing with Christian pietie, as I professed of them, the lesse soundnesse is in your conclusion, that would inferre vpon a strange and needlesse sense of these words your paines of the damned to be then suffered in the soule of Christ. And in denying your direfull exposition of Christes words, I haue all the Fathers of Christes Church for 1400 yeeres of the same opinion with me. And if your chiefe and capitall proofes were such newes to them, what thinke you was the rest of your new faith? [They are sixe in number, you say, and they all can not stand together.] You are nimble in trifles, and in substance no bodie. Nor I, nor any man liuing may take vpon vs to determine, which shall be the meaning of Christes words, when the words themselues admit and allow manie

senses. In this very case the persons and the parts forsaken; the graces and degrees wherein, and how farre that dereliction might extend, receiue diuers opinions; and though they be different, they are not repugnant the one to the other. And yet it is no newes in many places of holy Scripture, by reason of the different or repugnant significations of the words, circumstances of the sentence and degrees of extension and intension in many things, to finde contrarie iudgements of men euen of the same words and things in holy writ. Neither doe diuers expositions disgrace the word of God, so long as they containe nothing repugnant to the text it selfe in that or any other place; but shew rather the depth of Gods wisedome, which incloseth many things in few words, and often passeth the reach and search of mans wit. But you, that carpe at euery thing besides your owne conceits, would faine make your Reader beleeue, that siue fingers and one hand, ten toes and two feet can not stand together.
            For the matter it selfe, as dereliction is confessed on all sides, because it is mentioned in the words of Christ, so it may be questioned; of what persons, to what part, and in what things Christ conceined and intended that for saking of which he spake. For as God is sayd in the Scriptures to be present with vs diuers wayes and to diuers effects, namely when he lightneth, strengtheneth, and inwardly guideth vs with the grace of his spirit, or outwardly blesseth our wayes, and heareth and helpeth vs in time of trouble; so when he withdraweth or with holdeth any of these things from vs, whether it be his helpe, his blessing, or his grace; he is sayd to depart, and to forsake vs. Now if we take forsaking in Christes words for the losing or lacking of GodsWhat forsaking could not be found in Christ. fauour, grace, or spirit; it was not possible that any such forsaking should at any time be found in Christ our head, though the members of Christ do all well deserue to be depriued of all these things, and were depriued of them, till by Christ they were restored. Since then this kinde of forsaking could neuer be verified of Christes person, but only of his members, and he suffered for vs, Ephes. 2. 16. 
               to reconcile vs to God by his Crosse; these words of Christ on the Crosse some learned Fathers haue expounded to containe the reconciliation of man to God, who for sin had before forsaken vs, and was now pacified by Christes bloud, and an entrance giuen vs to the Father by vertue of Christes oblation and petition for vs. Wherefore in their iudgements, as Christ then suffered for vs, so he prayed in these words for vs, and the neere coniunction of Christ with vs, as the head with his members, made him couer vs, and present vs to God vnder his owne name, who was then and there no Redeemer of himselfe, but of vs. Examples of this speech they haue many and good: as where Christ sayd to Paul, Acts 9. 
               Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me; that is, my members? And againe; I am Iesus whom thou persecutest; that is, whose members thou pursuest. And in one Matth. 25. Chapter, where Christ foresheweth the separation that he will make betweene the sheepe and the goats, he calleth his brethren and seruants by the name of himselfe no lesse than two and thirtie times, saying: Ibid. vers. 35. I was hungrie, and ye gaue ME meat; I thirsted, and ye gaue ME drinke; I was a stranger, and ye lodged ME; vers. 36. I was naked, and ye clothed ME; I was sicke, and ye visited ME: and so forth to the number that I named. And when the good maruelled how euer they affourded any of these things to him, he answereth them; vers 40. 
               Verily I say vnto you, in as much as ye did it vnto one of the least of my brethren, ye did it vnto me. So that this exposition of Christes speech concerneth directly the worke that Christ had then in hand for vs, and wanteth not Christes warrant for the vse of his owne words; and this sense of that his prayer presenting and commending vs to God, that were forsaken of God, was of no lesse waight for vs than the rest of his sufferings.

For I vtterly denie, that your exposition hath any ground in the word of God, but resteth onely on your single and sillie surmises in fauour of your owne fansies. And since you demand of all the Fathers a reason of all their expositions, how come you against all reason and trueth to conclude the paines of the damned to be suffered in Christes soule by pretence of this dereliction, when as the word thorowoutDereliction in the Scriptures neuer implieth the paines of the damned. the Scriptures neuer implieth the present state or paines of the damned? What defence can you haue for your desperate aduenture to plunge Christes soule into the second death, which the Scripture calleth the Lake burning with fire and brimstone, since you want all, as well diuine, as humane reason and authoritie?

I do no where refuse the faith professed and preached in the primitiue Church of Christ by the learned and ancient Pastours and Guiders thereof; I openly confesseWherein wee should follow the Fathers. to God and this Realme, I should neuer sleepe quietly, if I saw my selfe to be of another faith than they were. In other things not pertinent to our saluation and redemption, where they themselues tooke libertie, either to dissent ech from other in some questions, or sometimes vpon better aduice to correct or moderate their former opinions, I thinke my selfe not burdened in conscience, if I with modestie make choise, what I like best. Neither doe I account it any disgrace, to make their faith deduced and confirmed by the word of God my best or only reason, since all hereticks haue subuerted themselues and their followers, whiles they would shew their inuentions, and with plausible reasons fasten their fansies on the sacred Scriptures, not contenting themselues with those sober and sound interpretations of hard places, which the Church of Christ with long experience and great diligence had examined and tried. And howsoeuer for want of knowledge in the Hebrew tongue they might sometimes come short, yet this was their generall care in all their expositions and applications, neuer to swarue from the Canons of the Christian faith, I speake of those, whom the Church accepted and allowed for truely Catholike. Yet to their interpretations I binde no mans conscience, farther than euident trueth shall appeare to be in them; onely I wish others, and euen you, Sir Inuentour, not ouerhastily to despise their iudgements, which the Church of God hath so many hundred yeeres reuerenced and followed. Howbeit, this is a bar sufficient to your bold deuices, that where you would deriue your hell paines from Christes complaint. on the Crosse, I bring you fiue or six expositions of those wordes out of the auntient and catholike fathers, whereof you shall neuer be able to refute one, which no way touch your hellish torments, and thereby teach you, if you be capable either of verity or sobriety, that your conclusion more then halteth in the highest mysteries of christian Religion.

afraid, nor ashamed to be crucified and to dy, leauing for a time thine owne higth, and emptying the maiesty of thy glory, that the dispersed might returne, and the forsaken might take breath, (or comfort). The forsaking, which Cyprian here describeth in Christ, consisteth in leauing of his diuine power and glory for a time, and in abasing himselfe SO FARRE, as to dy the death of the Crosse for their sakes, but no farder. And these wordes he saith Christ would haue vnderstoode to be a cause of their Reconciliation to God, who had deserued for their sinnes to be forsaken of God, and therefore he addeth presently

You would faine so wrest Cyprians wordes, that he should say Christ vndertooke our cause and no more, but he withall affirmeth, that Christ tooke vpon him our person, and that his carefull complaint were the wordes of his beloued. If the wordes were spoken as well in our person, as in our cause, then we were indeed forsaken, and Christ by laying downe his glorie for a time, and obeying his fathers will, did by those wordes declare, that he reconciled vs to God, when we were forsaken, and in signe thereof with full power made the theefe partaker of his kingdome, that had deserued, and was condemned to die the death of a for lorne and forsaken malefactour.

And what hindreth this complaint or prayer of Christs to beare witnesse, that we were now reconciled and purchased vnto God, which before were forsaken and separated from God? For those words doe not imply, that we still continued forsaken, but that formerly without Christ we were vtterly forsaken, and now by him restored to fauour. And the goodnesse of this sense, I doe not thinke but any man of meane capacitie will soone conceaue, and iudge it more fruitfull for vs to know, that by Christs mediation and oblation on the crosse we are now no longer strangers vnto God, nor forsaken of him, as before we were for our sinnes; then that Christ suffered the direfull and infernall paines and death of the damned in his Soule, before we could be freed from our sinnes.

For if euery man may elude with figures that, which liketh not his humour, we shall haue little truth left in the word of God. But euen by that rule your sense of Christs complaint is quite ouerthrowen, because your exposition plainly fastneth desperation for the time to the Soule of Christ. For all hope hath ioy and comfort in it. Rom. 12.

And what is no hope, but despaire? that therefore the litterall sense of these words neither is, nor can be true, taking dereliction for the inward forsaking of Gods grace and spirit, as well the Scriptures, as the Fathers, whom I haue produced, doe with one voice confirme. Saint Austen may serue to shew the reason, that led him and the rest so to thinke. August. in Psal. 43. 
               Ille caput nostrum, vocem de cruce non dixit suam, sed nostram. non enim vnquam dereliquit eum Deus, sed propter nos dixit hoc, Deus, Deus meus vt quid me dereliquisti.

               Finally this first sense is contrarie to your second and third following: also to your fift and sixt senses. If either of these be taken as the true meaning of this place, it cannot possibly stand with the rest.] I did not professe to discusse the likeliest sense of those words; It sufficed me to let you see the weaknesse of your cause in deriuing your hell paines from Christs complaint on the crosse, by this that twelue auncient and learned Fathers did diuersly sift and examine those words, and yet none of them euer lighted on your second death, or on the forsaking, which you labour to establish in the soule of Christ. Now if the words doe tolerably beare so many interpretations, what assurance had you thence to conclude your hellish confusion, which you imagine in the Sauiour of the world? yea graunt the expositions were contrarie, which indeed are somewhat different, according as the word of dereliction is applied and intended, that maketh the more against you, and hindereth not me. For still I vrge the words, which you stand on, do necessarily inferre no such sense, as you would fasten to them. The thing, that I presse, is this, that there are many other senses of these words approoued and preferred by the consent of the best writers old and new; and yours of all others, as it hath no consent of Christs Church, ne was euer heard of before our age, so hath it no foundation in the Sacred Scriptures. You would disgrace the Fathers as iuuentors of strange and new senses, but you little remember all this while,

that of all others yours is the latest, absurdest, and least likely sense of that complaint. And yet if you wrest it to the lowest step of dereliction, that this life knoweth, or the Scripture here

               Your second sense what is it? euen this that Christs humane Nature was left helplesse to the rage of the Iewes, which is a kind of forsaking. This seemeth to come neerest indeede to your liking, but as I said thi

So here, if we take dereliction for losse of grace, then that sense of the word could not agree to Christ, but to the reprobate without Christ, or to the rest before they be engraffed into Christ, and consequently me in Christs words must signifie my Members, that were one body with him. If we take it for lacke of helpe in time of trouble, then it might well agree vnto the person of Christ, who was forsaken, that is left in his affliction, and not deliuered from it, till he died, that we might euer after be restored, and reconciled to the fauour of God. Which commeth neerest to my liking, I neuer acquainted you; the places which you quote, prooue no such thing; they onely shew, that this exposition hath sufficient foundation in other places of Scripture, where the word forsaking is vsed to the like intent. Howbeit there is no cause that I, or you should mislike this exposition; and the trifles, which you obiect against it, will confirme as much.

Had the Church of God no reason to say in the Prophet Esay.Esa. 49. 
               The Lord hath forsaken me? or did God want reason in his answere, when he said;Esa. 54. ver. 7. 
               for a while I forsooke thee, for a moment in (mine) anger I hid my face from thee? If then God had Reason to say to his Church,Ibid. ver. 6. 
               the Lord hath called thee a woman forsaken, and afflicted in spirit, could Christ want reason in his intolerable paines on the Crosse to complaine, that he was now a long time left in them without helpe or ease? as for the equall sufferings of the godly at the hands of men, on which you would take aduantage. I haue shewed the difference before. When paines in others grow sharpest, then sense decaieth, and'death approcheth; in the paines whereof men cannot expresse how much nature misliketh and abhorreth the paine. In Christ it was otherwise: his bodie being in exquisite paines on euery side, and in euery part fromChrists patience was at the highest proof before he complained on the crosse. top to toe, and hanging in that plight now three houres on the crosse, when the paine was greatest, and himselfe weakest, his sense was quickest, which could not be ouerwhelmed in him, as it is in vs; but he endured most horrible anguish all that time, and therefore when his patience was at the highest proofe, he had more than reason to complaine, that he had long beene left in that extremitie without assistance or deliuerance; and he that doubteth thereof, sheweth that his fansie doth ouerrule his reason, and his will doth vndermine his wit.

And so this praier, which you would haue to be a most mournefull and vncomfortable complaint of inward forsaking in soule and spirit, was an effectuall and powerful praier prouoking God his father to demonstrate by most maruailous signes and wonders the exceeding loue and honour, that he bare to the tormented and despised person of his sonne.

               It is a great shame to imagine that Christ was lesse able to endure such a dereliction, or

that he would thus complaine and mourne for it onely.] It is a greater shame and sinne first to mistake, and then to disgrace the wordes of Christ. What rule either of reason or pietie could hinder our Sauior (when his time drew neere, that he would die, and ease himselfe of his exceeding paines on the crosse,) earnestly to call to God, euen now to declare, which he had all this while refrained, what account he made of that person, whom the Iewes and Gentils so much despised and oppressed? was it any shame for the manhood of Christ to say, my God, my God, why hast thou (so long) forsaken me; without any publike signe or shew, that thou louest and fauourest me, whom this nation had so much wronged and blasphemed? or is it of late become so shamefull a thing with you, that Christ should complaine he was forsaken and left in the hands of his persuers without help or ease? both old and new writers euen of the best learned, that haue been in Christs Church, haue thought it no shame for Christ in that very respect so to speake.

               haec Christi verbanon impatientiam aliquam, aut diffiden̄tiam prae se ferunt &c: these words of Christ, (My God my God why hast thou forsaken mee?) shew no impatience, or diffidence, but declare that he was a true man, and that he had truely suffered.
            
            And what if, as some learned Fathers conceaue, Christ did not grieuously complaine in those wordes, that he was forsaken, but thereby led his enemies to looke and search in the Psalmes & Prophets for the cause, why the messias should be so forsaken & deliuered into the hands of sinners, as they saw he was? August. epist. 120.

Christ on the crosse chalengeable, but they stand well with the piety, patience, confidence and expectance, that were in Christ, and haue better foundation in the sacred Scriptures then your paines of the damned, or your second death to be then and there suffered in the soule of Christ.

               The bare names againe of Austen, Ambrose, Ierom doe here likewise no good, this is but a weake kind of reasoning for so learned a Diuine as you are.] I like better this kind of weakenesse in matters of faith to haue the consent of the learned and auncient fathers for that I teach, then your kind of strength, which is to be so stiffe in your priuate conceits, that you will delude the Scriptures with your figures, and deride the fathers as seely fooles not vnderstanding the first principles of Religion, rather then you will forgoe the least of your fansies. If you light on any Reader of the same mind let him know, that the choice wilbe hard for him to make, whether all the fathers in Christes Church did erre in the chiefe grounds of their faith, or he himselfe be out of the trueth. If Christian Religion were not since Christes time before our age, this is a greater forsaking of Christ, then any was on the Crosse. For then hath God forgotten all his purposes and promises so often mentioned in the Prophets, and confirmed to Christ; if there were neuer Church of Christ since the Apostles death till our dayes. And he that is of that humour, it skilleth not greatly of what side he be, for certainly he can be no member of Christs Church, that reiecteth all persons, places, and ages before his birth, as none of Christs. I wish no wise nor sober Reader so farre to venture his soule. If then to the Primatiue Church of Christ next after the Apostles we yeeld but ordinary knowledge of the Christian faith, we may not take from so many learned fathers and Pastours, as God hath for so many hundred yeares adorned his Church withall, the common vnderstanding of their Catechisme and Creed, how we were saued, and what is the price of our Redemption, specially the Scriptures going so cleare with them, and they teaching so closely and soundly the trueth there expressed.
            
               Defenc. pag. 110. li. 9. 
               These very sentences of the fathers I can easily admit, if they import no more, then that those outward afflictions on the Crosse were SOME CAVSES (AND THAT NO SMAL) of his complaint, alwaies remembring that some greater cause also did concurre and was conioined with them.] Then by your owne confession haue the fathers spoken trueth, and there was small or no cause, giuen you, to make so light regard of them. As for your other greater cause, when you prooue by Scripture, as you intend, that Christs soule on the crosse suffered the second death, and the paines of the damned, you shall haue a speciall reseruation, that your fansies may be conioined with Christs praiers: otherwise your reasons be like your resolutions, they haue neither proofe nor strength besides your owne priuate and presumptuous perswasions.

               Your third sense if I conceiue it aright, is; that his being left to bodily death caused him thus to mourne, which is but as the last before. And yet you seeme to meane not only that, but also because his flesh now should want all feeling of his heauenly comfort for that while that it should remaine dead. A maruailous exquisite and farre fet cause.] The sense is neither mine, nor so farre fet as you would make it. I tooke it out of Tertullian, Hilarie, andThe third sense of Christs complaint on the crosse. 
               Epiphanius, whose wordes I produced to that purpose; and howsoeuer you gibe at it after your scornefull maner, I suppose it will prooue sounder then your hellish death, which you haue so learnedly deuised out of their words. The difference betwixt this and the former sense is not great. For there the fathers ment Christ was forsaken, that is not deliuered from the rage of his persecutors, whiles he liued; and these doe adde, that he was left vnto death, presuming death to be the greatest and most grieuous of all outward afflictions, which in this life befall the nature of man.

               giueth after a sort to Christes dead flesh this LIVELY AFFECTION, my flesh shall rest in hope.] The soule of Christ, which was replenished with life, trueth, and grace, as being personally vnited vnto God, and of whose fullnesse we all haue receaued, you affirme died on the Crosse, and none other death then the second death: and Christs flesh lying dead in the graue you imagine not only to haue life, but to be a liuing spirit. For you giue vnto it the liuely affection of hope; which nothing hath, that is not a liuing and reasonable soule, or more. You doe it, you will say but after a sort.] That sort is absurd inough, of figuratiue speaches in the Scriptures to make positiue doctrines. For if you defend, that the dead flesh of Christ in the graue had indeed any liuely affection of hope in part or in whole, it is a brutish heresie denying that Christ was truely dead, and that his body was truely flesh; since a liuely hope impo

Hope in these wordes of Dauid is either applied to the soule of Christ in respect of the resurrection of his body, which he beleeued and hoped for as most assured; or if we apply it to the body, it noteth safety from corruption, and promise made by God of speedie resurrection, which was the thing wherewith Christs bodie might be inuested. But we shall haue mainer proofe for this matter.

For (Christian Reader I pray thee) take no more but his owne confession or assertion in this place, by which he thought to ouerbeare all that stood in his way, and obserue both how desperatly he contradicteth himselfe, and how sensibly he subuerteth his whole doctrine and his deuice of this new found hell. But the lease before he told vs peremptorily, thatPa. 108. li. 8. 
               Christes Godhead as it were withdrawing and hiding it selfe from him for that season of his passion gaue him NO SENSE, NOR FEELING OF COMFORT OR IOY in spirit, soule, or body. Now suddainly whiles he eagerly hunteth after his hell paines, he not onely falleth ouer head and eares into the myre of contradictions, but he clearely confesseth before hand, that all which himselfe will say touching the second death of Christes soule on the crosse, is apparantly false doctrine, and euidently repugnant to the sacred Scriptures. Thou wilt maruaile much at this, and so doe I; but that Liars are often so earnest to serue their turnes and not the trueth, that they forget their former tales, whiles they inuent newer. As here for example.
            
            He that would before allow to Christ on the crosse NO SENSE NOR FEELING OF COMFORT OR IOY, in spirit, soule or body; Now vrgeth, to promote another purpose, Christs EXCEEDING GENERALL AND CONSTANT IOY euen at the same time, when he spake these wordes, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me: and not content with this, he addeth, that Christ euen then IN HIS MIND SPAKE TRIVMPHANTLY OF HIS CONSTANT and CONTINVALL IOY in GOD; and prooueth it by the words of the holy Ghost, where Dauid being a Prophet spake concerning Christ on the Crosse, that heActs 2. 
               beheld the Lord alwaies before him at his right hand, that he should not be shaken. And therefore did Christs hart reioyce, and his tongue was glad. Vnderstand you, sit faith-maker, the difference or repugnance betweene NO SENSE NOR FEELING OF COMFORTOR IOY, in spirit, soule, or body,
               A most shamefull contradiction. 
               and EXCEEDING GENERALL, CONSTANT, and TRIVMPHANT IOY in GOD in the mind of Christ? can you read this, and not thinke you reele, as your reasons doe to and fro? can you salue this sore without sweating? or make vp this breach without blushing? and I pray you since the ground of these wordes is true, in that it is the holy Ghosts, and you may not flie from your owne inference, which you presse so violently against the fathers to beate downe their exposition, how could Christs Soule on the crosse IN THIS EXCEEDING GENERALL, CONTINVALL, CONSTANT, and TRIVMPHANT IOY OF MIND suffer also the paines of the damned and the second death, wherein IS NO SENSE NOR FEELING OF ANY COMFORT OR IOY IN body, soule, or spirit? Can you hang these gymmoes together, that the one shall not crie shamefull and intolerable falsehood against the other? the best excuse, that I can make for your, to saue you from ebriety or frensie, is that these things were posted ouer to you from diuers, that saw not each others fansies, and so without due perusing or remembring, where they crossed ech other, you patched their papers together with more hast then good speed. How beit surely I take it to be a iust iudgement of God, when you are diuided from the trueth, to diuide either your tongues from your harts, or your harts from themselues, that all men may learne to take heed how they dally with the Christian faith, or delude the Scriptures. I thanke God I hate you not so much, but for your owne sake I could wish, you had beene silenter, or circumspecter.
            And see how euill you lucke, or at least your cause is. For heere haue you spoken enough to confute all that you formerly haue said, and afterward will say, and yet you haue brought nothing to infringe that which I said. For a naturall seare and mislike of death, as also griefe and sharpnesse of paine in the body may well stand with a continuall and constant comfort in God; yea where grace is present and preuaileth, the
               2 Cor. 4.

               power is perfected in our infirmity. For, when I am weake (saith the Apostle, in body,) then I am strong, in spirit. And if Paul could2. Cor. 12. 
               delight in reproches, persecutions and anguishes for Christes sake, and yet feele the smart of them, could not Christ retaine comfort in his afflictions, though his flesh were pressed with extreame paine?

               As first: that seeing he perfectly knew that as his flesh should now quietly rest, so his soule should enioy perfect glory and comfort more then before it did.] That doth not quench the detestation,Was there no comfort in all this? which mans nature hath of death euen by Gods ordinance; though it comfort and courage the soule in hope of future blisse to indure the paine and horrour of death. S. Austen saith,August. epistola 120.

The resurrection of the body maketh no man willing to die, if he could with Gods liking decline death, but obedience ouerruleth the naturall instinct, that God hath impressed in vs to abhorre death. And where you take it for a mighty'pillar in your building, that Christ Pa. 111. li. 6. 
               would not so extreamly mourne and complaine only for this cause, as my fansie importeth, you build but on sand, which will haue the greater fall. For I shew you many more causes and senses of those words, then this only; all which you kindly skippe, and pretend this only which I neuer professed, calling it my fansie, that I cited out of auncient and reuerend writers.

               Further he knew perfectly, that this was the very appointment of God for the obtaining of his most desired purchase of our health, for the more aduancing of Gods glorie, and for the aduancing of his very manhood. Finally, it was his owne most free and fore-determined will: would he then so mournefully grieue and complaine thereat? It hath no reason nor likelihood in it.] You runne your selfe out of breath, and quite besides the way. You shall not need to perswade me, that Christ was resolued and willing to die; I perfectly beleeue it, and easily confesse it: but how? as he himselfe declared, the spirit was willing, the flesh was weake. The minde of Christ apprehended and persued all these things which you mention, but that excludeth not the naturall dislike which Gods will is all men should haue of death. This imperfection of mans nature, since it pleased Christ to taste, as well as the rest of our infirmities and affections, you may by no respects nor rewards, make the weakenesse of Christes flesh, to which he submitted himselfe, theWeaknesse appered in Christs flesh, but willingnesse in his spirit. same or equall with the willingnesse of his spirit, which had and shewed the abundance of all grace. Wherefore I maintaine both in Christ, a voluntarie sense of the weaknesse of our flesh, and an heauenly strength of the inward man, which expressed, but ouerballanced the naturall desire of the outward man in Christ. And still you harpe on that one string, which is vtterly out of tune, that he would not do it So extreamly and So mournefully. This extremitie is only your fansie; for I say Christ did it meekely, obediently, and faithfully, assuring himselfe, that his Father, who all this while had tried his patience, would at his prayer not onely end his paine, but make heauen and earth to witnesse, what account God made of him, though for a season he left him in their hands to be made a sacrifice for our sinnes.

               Lazarus when he was returned from the ioyes of heauen to take againe his rotten carcase, yet he grieued not at it, nor ought he so to haue done.] When you sincke in reasons, you ascend to reuelations. Who tolde you, that the soule of Lazarus was in the ioyes of heauen, when Christ raised his bodie from the graue? Christ placeth the soule of the other Lazarus, that died at the rich mans doore, in Abrahams bosome to be comforted; and doe you take vpon you to place this Lazarus, that was brother to Marie and Martha, in the very ioyes of heauen? Where was his soule those foure dayes, you will aske? It is not for you to aske, nor for me to answere. The things after this life, and out of this world, it is not lawfull for me or you farder to enquire, then the Scripture reuealeth. That such as are raised from the dead should be able by experience to report the ioies of heauen or the paines of hell, or the secrets of Gods kingdome; is a thing not permitted by God, as we find by Abrahams answeare to the rich man praying that Lazarus might be sent to his fathers house. God hath places and Angels enough to keepe the soules of such, as he meaneth shalbe returned to this life, though

it be neither in hell nor in heauen. From hell no man is released, and from heauen no man is dismissed that hath once seene God face to face. When 1. Cor. 13. 
               that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be abolished, sayth the Apostle. And will you aduenture to abolish perfection after it is come, and to bring men backe to this mortall life, that haue seene God in the fulnesse of his glory, whom no man liuing can see, depriuing them of that vision, perfection, and brightnesse, which the ioyes of heauen haue in them? It is an enterprise meet for such an encounterer as you are. Paul liuing was taken vp into

If the abundance of reuelation would so exalt Paul when he was but taken vp into Paradise, that he needed the messenger of Satan to humble him, how would the ioyes of heauen, and cleercnesse of Gods face beheld in his glory, exalt men that should afterward liue againe in this wretched world? And therefore this is like the rest, euen a bolde assertion of things vnknowen; whereas God wanteth no meanes nor places extraordinarie to detaine the soules of such as shall in his counsell returne to this life, without knowing the secrets or possessing the ioyes of heauen.

Neither do I thinke will you plainly holde this, NEITHER DO VVE DENIE THE OTHER.] If the Fathers meaning be, which you now consesse, that Christ on the crosse complained because of his bodily dying, then proue they as much as I produced them sor: and your admitting this exposition of theirs sheweth, that all this while you idlely sought to subuert their assertion with your strong allegation (as you supposed) to no purpose, since now you denie it not. And where you pretend, they say not ONLY and meerely for that, you come too late with your exception: For since Christ made no complaint on the crosse but this, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me; if in that he complained because of his bodily dying, as you do not denie; then all proofe for your hell paines out of those words is quite excluded, aswell by their opinion, as by your owne confession. And your making Christs complaint on the crosse to be Pa. 111. li. 22 
               improbable, yea vnlawfull, conuinceth you by your owne mouth, that within the compasse of fiue lines you are contrary to your selfe, and charge Christ with vnlawfull mourning, which amounteth to as much as sinfull. As for mine opinion, what respects Christ might haue in that complaint of his, I haue before deliuered, so that your so grieuing and so mourning only and meerely for that, is but a sillie refuge, when you can not otherwise resist the trueth.

Their purpose I know was to proue Christ no God in nature, because he feared and sorowed in the Garden, and complained on the Crosse, as if he were forsaken; which things they thought vnfit for him that was God. The Fathers to repell their heresie, and to open this obscuritie, insist plainly on these points, that the Mediatour must be God as well as man, and that the Godhead of Christ incarnate was impassible, and could not suffer any violence or change; but his manhood might and did suffer somethings in soule, as feare and sorow; and somethings in bodie, as paines and death. But generally when they speake of death, they neuer intend as you doc, the death of Christes soule as well as of his bodie, but they meane plainly the death of the Crosse described by the Euangelists, which is farre from the second death or the death of the damned.

               The very same doth Hilarie also, where he sayth, that this in Christ was Corporis vox,

The outcrie of his bodie, he plainly meaneth it of his whole manhood, the opposition being betweene it and his Godhead, as the Scripture often doth.] If your authoritie be such, that you may take bodie for soule, and life for death, where you will, you may soone make a shew, that the Fathers intend nothing against your doctrine: but if you must proue it as well as say it, then is it the most riotous and most ridiculous course that can be, to take one contrarie for another: for so you may proue darknesse to be light, vice to be vertue, falshood to be trueth, and infidelitie to be faith. What the Fathers taught touching the death of Christes soule, when we come to the place we shall plainly see by their owne asserting, and not by your peruerting; in the meane time you were best bring stronger proofes than these, that you will take the bodie for the soule, if you meane to conclude any thing out of the Fathers for your croslegged doctrine.
            
               Trea. pag. 9. 
               The Scripture often doth the like, you say, as you haue shewed in your Treatise.] There you haue childishly abused a number of Scriptures, and yet no way prooued, that any where the bodie signifieth the soule, or standeth for the soule. That the soule is a consequent to the bodie, and the bodie likewise a consequent to the soule, wheresoeuerThe s

                  , but no part of it. the Scripture speaketh of men liuing heere on earth, is a sure and safe rule; because no man heere liueth, that doeth not consist of soule and bodie: yet that is no proofe, that what is attributed to the bodie, must be verified of the soule, much lesse that the one must be taken for the other. Looke but to your owne examples, where bodie is named:Rom. 6. 
               Let not sinne reigne in your mortall bodies, sayth the Apostle. If here you will comprehend the soule vnder the name of the bodie, you must grant in exact words, that the soule is mortall, which is an open heresie destroying the summe and effect of the Christian faith. Againe:1. Cor. 6. 
               Euery sinne that a man doth, is without the body, but the fornicato-sinneth against his owne bodie. If in this place the bodie conclude the soule, then euery sinne (saue fornication) is without soule and body, and consequently no sinne; which is a doctrine a man would thinke meet for no Diuine. The third instance which you bring, hath not so grosse sequels, but as plaine falshoods:Hebr. 10.

               shadowes. Now did the bodies of beasts slaine, or their bloud shed, prefigure the Soule of Christ, or the death of his bodie? These be the places, on which you build your vnsound obseruation, that the Scripture doth often take the bodie for the soule, which are so sensibly false, that they need no Refuter. But we reason of death, which seuereth the soule from the bodie, and therein to say the bodie must be taken for the soule, is a very sincke of sottish absurdities and falsities. For what can be more repugnant to trueth and sense, than to take a dead bodie for a liuing soule, and when they are so farre seuered by nature, to say they must agree in name, and the one be called the other?
            Peruse now the Fathers, which you would faine wrest to your purpose, and see whether they doe not flatly contradict your deuice, that the body in their speaches must be taken for the whole man, and so the death of Christes body for the death, as well of soule, as of the body. Epiphanius is the first, that you would frustrate with your deuices, and the first that shall conuince your falshood. He saith the manhood of Christ spake these words, Now seeing the deity together with the soule moouing to forsake his sacred body. What death call you that, where the soule moueth and forsaketh the body? then in that complaint of Christs the thing forsaken was his body alone by the iudgement of Epiphanius, and the deityEpiph. contra

Which way doth this prooue the soule or the whole manhood of Christ to be forsaken, when Epiphanius expresly saith, the deity with the soule did mooue to forsake the body? Hilarie is the next, whom you would infect with your fansie, but finding no words in him meet for your matter, you are forced shamefully to misconster the body for the soule, and the death of the one for the death of the other, which is all the hold you haue in Hilarie, though you lustily would beare out the rest with the copy of your countenance. Notwithstanding Hilarie doth not only preuent, but also refute your mistaking. For in plaine

words he saith

               Querela derelicti morientis infirmit as est, traditio spirit us morientis excessio est, The complaint (of Christ) that he was forsaken was the infirmity of one dying, the yeelding vp his spirit was his departure hence, when he died. And againe, Tradens spiritum mortuus est; Christ died by deliuering vp his spirit. Sepultus est Christus, quia & mortuus est, mortuus autem est, quia & moriturus locutus est, Deus, Deus meus, quare me dereliquisti. Christ was buried because he was dead; and ready to die, he said, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me. So that Christes death, when he spake those words, was not past nor present, but then to come, as Hilarie noteth by the future tence, and was the deliuering vp of his spirit into his fathers hands. I trust you dare not defend, that Christ in or after the deliuering vp of his spirit, suffered the paines of hell or the second death, and yet saith Hilarie those words Christ spake of his death, that was to come.

This voice of the flesh and soule, that is of the man, not of the word, nor of the spirit, that is not of God, was therefore spoken to shew that God is impassible, who so left his sonne, whiles he deliuered his manhood to death. Yet the Father did not (altogether) forsake the sonne, into whose hands the sonne breathed out his spirit. For he breathed it out, and straigh

Here are the words of Tertullian in order as they stand. Where it is euident, that he affirmeth no death nor forsaking in Christ, but only that, when the spirit left the body. His words are plaine. The Father forsocke not the sonne, into whose hands the sonne deposed his spirit. For he laid it downe, and died. So to be forsaken of the Father was (this) for the sonne to die, by laying downe his spirit or soule, as before he prooueth Christ did. Then suffered Christ no death of the soule, since he died not, till he breathed out his spirit into his fathers hands; and other forsaking the sonne felt none, then so to die by the separation of his soule from his body.

Other death he nameth none here, then to die by breathing out the spirit. And so long as the spirit abideth in the flesh, the flesh he saith cannot die at all. Christ therefore endured no death whiles his spirit did abide in his body, and consequently no death of the soule; and when he breathed out his spirit he straightway died, which was the forsaking, that he complained of in those words. So that all your collections heere out of Tertullian are your additions to Tertullian, and not so much as one of them to be found or fet from his text. He speaketh not a word that ChristDefenc. pag.

euen the separation of the deitie from the whole manhood, which is the death of the soule. I speake nothing here but the Fathers words, yea the Scriptures.] Your setting vnto TertullianTertullian nameth no death but of Christes bodie. your owne sense, is an impudent attempt, and the weakest argument that can be, when you tell vs he meaneth so, though he speake not one word touching the death of the soule, but as exactly as he can or should, nameth the death of the bodie, by this that he sayth: Denique (spiritum) posuit, & statim obijt. Spiritu enim manente in carne caro omnino mori non potest. Christ layd downe his (spirit) and straightway died. For whiles the spirit remained in the flesh, the flesh could not die at all. What was it to lay downe his spirit into his fathers hands, as the Scripture speaketh of Christ on the crosse, but to die the death of the body? Those very words Tertullian here citeth and vseth, and thereby prooueth the Father had not inwardly forsaken the sonne, since the sonne by the manifest words of himselfe reported in the Euangelist, commended and yeelded his spirit to his fathers hands. So that against the death of the soule, Tertullians words are pregnant:) for how did the soule die, that was commended into Gods hands?) and other death Tertullian nameth nor meaneth none, but only this. Denique (spiritum) posuit, & statim obijt. Christ laied downe (his spirit into his fathers hands) and straightway died. As for your speaking nothing heere but the fathers and the Scriptures words, beware you take not vp the Diuels trade, to keepe their words, and peruert their sense. It is no great mastery to abuse mens words, yea the word of God, which all Hereticks haue euer drawen to their owne false and wicked purposes.

You alleage three places to this purpose, and either corrupt, or peruert all three most apparantly.

               piphanius saith, that Christs deity TOGETHER WITH THE SOVLE departed from his sacred body, which is as plaine a description of bodily death, as may be vttered. You leaue out the words, TOGETHER WITH THE SOVLE, as crossing your course, and turne the body into the soule, meaning by this corruption to load Epiphanius with a sense cleane contrarie to his owne. Hilaries words spoken of Christes body, you enlarge to the whole manhood of Christ, and thence conclude directly against Hilaries meaning and words, that the deity departed from both, where as Hilarie professeth of Christ; Hilarius de Trinitate li. 10.

The man Christ cried (not then dead in soule, when he cried as you would haue it, but) ready to die, or that after should die, when he yeelded his spirit into his fathers hands. The very next sentence before sheweth that this departing was of the diuinity from the body, to leaue that vnto death. Ibidem. 
               Euidens manifestatio contestantis Dei secessionem diuinitatis & corporis. A manifest speach of God witnessing the departure of his diuinity from his bodie. So that by no meanes Ambrose euer imagined that Christes soule died, but as he expresseth himselfe in the same Chapter; Ibidem. 
               Caro moritur, vt resurgat, spiritus Patri commendatur, vt pax fuerit in Caelo. The flesh dieth, that it might rise againe; the spirit is commended to (God) the father, that peace might be established in the heauens. Thus shortly haue you taken the paines to produce three Fathers for the death of Christes soule, and haue as shamefully peruerted and inuerted euery one of them, which is no newes with you; and yet all that you can conclude out of them may amount to a pestilent heresie, if you will, that the vnion of Christes person was dissolued for the time of his death, but it can neuer inferre any thing pertinent to your purpose.

Wherefore if their words concerne his bodily death, they by no meanes admix the death of the soule, since they all affirme a

                the Scripture doth, that Christ committed his soule to his Fathers hands, and so died; of which death they say he spake in those words, Why hast thou left me, that is, to die, as they expound it. Now if you affixe any death to the soule of Christ, I hope you will free him from it, before he commended his soule into his Fathers hands. And so the one must be ended, before the other could enter; and consequently, if they spake of the latter, their words haue no intent to implie the other. But what dispute we of their meaning, when their words are so manifest, that you can not hale them to your hell-paines, but by shamefull corrupting of their sentences, and wilfull misconstruing the bodie for the soule?

Is it so small a mote in your eye, that Christes deitie was separated from his humane soule, that you may loosely and lightly surmise it by disordering and altering other mens words? At this speech of Ambrose you could not so grosly haue stumbled, had you but read the Master of the Sentences, who long since in one whole distinction of his third booke examined those words, and answered as the trueth is, that separation in that place was taken for want of protection, and withholding Christes power, whiles the bodie died.

This separation is meant and may be called the death of the soule.] If you separate none of these, what then is it that you separate from the soule of Christ to proue it dead? [All comfortable feeling and assistance of the Godhead.] He knew himselfe to be personally God and man, he saw his soule full of all truth and grace, he was assured, the loue of God towards him could neither faile nor change; he knew that his obedience and sacrifice were acceptable to his Father, and should be the redemption of the world, and he was most certaine, that the third day he should rise againe into immortall and celestiall glory, hauing men, diuels and angels, euen all things in heauen and earth subiect to his manhood. Were all these no comforts? or was there no assistance of the Godhead in these?

constant, and continuall? May a man be so franticke, as to confesse that Christ felt all this, and yet to say he had no comfortable feeling? [This may be called the death of the soule.] To him that calleth light darknesse, good euill, faith feare, ioy discomfort, this may seeme death; which by all the rules of the sacred Scriptures is called the life of the soule heere on earth; but by no man that vnderstandeth or careth what he sayth, can this be called or defended to be the death of the soule.

The sixteenth Psalme vers: 11 not 21 as you quote it, sheweth vs, that there is a way to life reuealed here on earth, but the fulnesse of ioy is in Gods presence, when we shall behold his face, as the Angels doe in heauen. The way to life is grace, wherewith Christ was replenished from his mothers wombe, and in greater measure then all his members. For he had the fullnesse thereof in this life, where the perfectest men haue but a measure thereof, and we Iohn 1. 
               all haue receaued of his fulnesse. The plenty of pleasure, which is at Gods right hand, is euerlasting glory both of soule and body, into which Christ entred after his Resurrection. How doth this prooue, that Christs soule was dead during the time of his Pa

               the waies of life were made knowen to him by God, and that after his rising againe, God would Replenish him with the ioy of his countenance, which was euerlasting glory in the heauens. The one he possessed, the other was promised, more then which the soule of man cannot enioy in this life. Now except this be your rage rather then your reason, that all mens soules are dead, till they come to behold God face to face in the heauens; I see not what you can hence collect touching the death of Christs soule. The contrarie may be soundly concluded out of this place. For the wayes of life were made knowen to him here on earth, and by him to all men liuing, since he prosessed himselfe to be theIohn 14.

Did you meane, that he had no ease of his paines, nor end of reproches, whiles he liued, as also no deliuerance from the hands of his persecutors, nor protection from death, all these might be borne with, since the Scriptures giue manifest testimony, that these things he suffered till he died; but these things, that are true, will not serue your turne, you vrge his soule died: because he had no heauenly life, such as he tasted in his transfiguration, whereMatth. 17.

               Your fift exposition is Leos conceit, without warrant, farre fetcht, hardly applied. Origen is also here as weake.] Pricke on in your pride, despising all the world besids your selfe,

Leos exposition vtterly subuerteth your hellish assertion, and that maketh you fling it away with such disdaine as you doe. Otherwise it hath more vicinity with the circumstances of the text, then yours by many degrees. For there is nothing in Leos interpretation, which accordeth not with the Christian faith, and hath his foundation in the very words of the sacred Scriptures; in both which your hellish and harrish application faileth. He saith;Leo de Pass. Dom. serm. 16. 
               Vox ista doctrina est, non querela; those words were an instruction, not a lamentation. And his reason is past your refuting. Cum in Christo Dei & hominis vna sit persona, nec potuerit ab eo relinqui, à quo non poterat separari, pro nobis trepidis & infirmis interrogat, cur caro pati metuens ex audita non fuerit. Since in Christ there was but one person of God and man, & he could not be for saken of him, from whom he could not be seuered, he ASKETH for our sakes, that are fearefull and weake, why flesh fearing to suffer was not heard. Which of these things can you refell with all the witte in your head? the coniunction and communion of both natures in one person of Christ you were not best meddle with, lest you sowe damnable heresies as thicke, as you haue done notable absurdities. He saith further, Cur for quare, and non exandities for relictus. Aske the Boyes in Pauls schoole, what difference betwixt cur and quare, both signifying WHY, and being both interrogatiues, as Leo rightly obserueth, concurring with that of Saint Austen, who said, as we haue heard before,August. epist. 120. 
               Causam commonuit requirendam, cum addidit, vt quid dereliquistime. Christ warned (them) to search for the cause, when he added, WHY HAST THOV FORSAKEN ME? His exposition of the word forsaking, he taketh out of the very Psalme, whence Christ cited the rest. For so Dauid ioined them together.

               Quare me dereliquisti, tanquam diceret, relinquendo me, hoc est, non me exaudiendo, longè factus es à salute mea, praesenti scilicet salute huius vitae. Why hast thou forsaken me, as if he should haue said, leauing me, that is, not hearing me, thou art farre from sauing me, to wit from the present safety of this life. So saith Leo. De Passione serm. 16. 
               In ipso tantae victoriae exaltatus triumpho, causam & rationem, qua sit relictus, id est, non exauditus, inquirit. Christ exalted in the triumph of so great a victory, inquireth the cause & reason why he is forsaken, that is, not heard. The reason therof he giueth soberly, learnedly, and truely, howsoeuer your humour like it not. Idem de Pass. Dom. serm. 17. 
               That the Lord should be deliuered to his passion, it was as well his Fathers will, as

                   non solum Pater relinqueret, sed etiam ipse se quadam ratione desereret; That not only the father might leaue him, but that after a sort he should forsake himselfe, not by any fearefull shrincking, but by a voluntary cession. For the power of Christ crucisied conteined it selfe from those wicked ones, and to performe his secret disposition, he would not vse any manifest power. He that came by his passion to destroy death, and the author of death, how should he saue sinners if he would haue resisted his pursuers? And touching that kind of forsaking, which you dreame of, he saith; Ibidem.

Let vs leaue this to the Iewes, to thinke Christ forsaken of God, on whom they could execute their rage with such wickednesse; who sacriligiously deriding him saied, he saued others, he cannot saue himselfe. He was then forsaken of his father, when he was deliuered into the hands of the wicked, that is, he was not defended from them; yea he would forsake himselfe, that is, he would vse no manifest power against them, but willingly yeelded himselfe into their hands to suffer what they would. This is the forsaking, saith Leo, which the Scripture alloweth. That other sort of forsaking, that God indeed had left him & would not help him in his good time, that is rather the perfidiousnesse of the Iewes, which obiected so much vnto him, then the faith of Christians.

               Christ was forsaken of his Father, when he tooke vnto him the forme of a seruant, and came to the death of the crosse, which amongest men seemed most shamefull. Then maiest thou plainly vnderstand, what he ment, when he sayd, why hast thou forsaken me; comparing that glory, which he had with his Father, to this shame, which he despised enduring the Crosse. Tell vs not what you will mislike, but what you can refute in this saying. And since you require the reasons of all other mens speaches, and thinke your selfe priuiledged to speake without all reason, what say you, which was the greater abasing or forsaking, for God to lay aside the power and glory of his maiesty and to take vnto him the shape of a seruant, and therein to die the shamefull death of the crosse; or for man to want comfort in his affliction? which was the greater emptying, or humbling himselfe in Christ? If Origen in this point be weake, the Apostle is as weake, who nameth this as the greatest Phil. 2. EXINANITION, that Christ endured; saying, he being in the forme of God (that is equall with God) emptied himselfe, and tooke on him the forme of a seruant, and humbled himselfe, and became obedient to the death, euen the death of the Crosse. Origen goeth right with the Apostles words, and saith this was the greatest dereliction, or humiliation that Christ suffered; and before you can with any reason controle this speach you must correct the Apostles text, and in steed of the death of the Crosse, put in the death of the damned, which is a mystery the apostle neuer heard, nor spake of. Origen therefore concludeth. Origen. v

What els can Chrysostome meane by this, but that the Prophet by this Psalme foreshewed the Sonne of God and Sauiour of the world should speake these words on the crosse, and thereby not only affirme, that God was his God, and not his aduersarie, but ratifie the ancient Scripture, euen that whole Psalme, as forespoken of him; whereby the Iewes might plainely learne, that nothing befell him, which the Prophet in that Psalme did not before declare should befall the true Messias and Sauiour of the world.

               Finally, these kindes of dereliction which you mention besides, pag. 32, 33, 38, &c. are nothing sitter than the former.] You sit like a supreame Iudge ouer Fathers and Scriptures, and cassiere all besides your owne conceits, vpon the warrant of your owne will, without any farther trouble or proofe. It is vrged in those pages which you passe ouer, that forsaking thorowout the Scriptures neuer signifieth the state or paines of the damned. You care not for that, your will must haue way, and your word must

stand. It is there also auouched, that whensoeuer the godly complaine in the Scriptures, as they often doe, that they are forsaken; they meane of helpe in time of need, and of deliuerance in the day of trouble. Nor Scriptures nor Fathers haue any power to preuaile against your pleasure, you will haue forsaking in Christes words to note the paines of the damned, though there be no example thereof in any diuine or humane writings. You are belike some Praetor or some Pilate, that what you haue written, you haue written, and other reason you will yeeld none.

               Six or seuen diuers yea contrary senses you haue brought of a few words, and of them all you say, they are all godly expositions, and all these interpretations are sound, and stand well with the rules of Christian pietie. How sound and fit they are, it hath beene scene.] And what haue you found in any of them dissonant from the rules of Christian pietie, for which I commended them? They fit not your fansie, I know it well; but they swarue neither from the faith of Christ, nor from the word of God. For where all good ExpositionsThe true rules how to expound the Scriptures. should haue these foure conditions; the right vse of the words, the circumstances of the place, the coherence with other Scriptures, and concordance with the maine grounds of pietie and charitie, which by no pretence of any speech in Scripture may be impugned; these expositions of the ancient Fathers transgresse in none of them. And where the Iewes falsely, wickedly, and blasphemously obiected to Christ, that he was forsaken of God, you out of the abundance of your wit and faith, will haue Christ on the crosse publikely and plainly to confesse and confirme their sacrilegious obiections, and to iustifie their impietie for trueth, by acknowledging with a loud voice, that he was forsaken of God. A worse exposition than which, the diuell himselfe could not deuise. For whatsoeuer was inwardly betweene him and his Father, he would neuer so openly ratifie their impious and slanderous cogitations and imputations with his owne mouth, nor leaue such a confession presently before his death in the eares and hearts of all his enemies, as that he found himselfe to be truely and inwardly forsaken of God; but rather calling that a forsaking, which they misconstrued to be so, he complained that God had so long with such patience left him in their hands without any shew as yet of loue and fauour towards him, which made his enemies thinke God had indeed forsaken him.

               Verily you haue a good head, if you can reconcile all these, and make them stand together.] Doth any man, that hath so much as a head, require to haue all expositions reconciled, before they may be tolerated? When they are diuers, the Reader may make his choise what he best liketh; but there is no cause nor reason to reiect all that can not be reconciled. Neither did I tell you, they might all stand together; but I sayd they stood well with the rules of Christian pietie. And since they had in them no contradiction to the text, nor to the faith, I saw no ground to depriue the Reader of them, much lesse to reiect or disdaine the authours of them, as you do. And yet truly it were no such hard matter, as you imagine, to make the substance of them stand together. For why might not Christ on the crosse, as the head and Sauiour of his bodie, in his owne name make his complaint, or inquire the cause why both he and his were so long and in this wise forsaken; as namely, the head to be left to the paine, shame and death of the crosse, and his members to the poison of sinne, and rage of Satan: and therefore pray that his members might be freed and restored to Gods fauour, and himselfe be eased of his anguish with deposing his spirit into his Fathers hands, and honoured with the signes of his Fathers loue and liking towards him, when he should depart this life, that all his enemies might know there was a great and good cause, euen the glory of God and mans saluation, why he was thus martyred and mocked on the crosse? Here are the effects of those sixe or seuen causes layd together; what so great repugnancie finde you betwixtthem, that because they are manie, therefore your hell-paines should be the likelier to be the true meaning of these words?

               Now it resteth, that I gather some reasons from the expresse Scripture, to shew you that indeed very paines, and the vehemencte of sorrowes, namely, which he now susteined by way of yeelding satisfaction and sacrifice for sinne, were the principall and only proper cause of his most dreadfull agonies and complaint. Which trucly though it need no reason for proofe of it (the matter being so cleere in it selfe) yet your vnreasonablenesse is such, that it draweth somewhat from me about it. Your Art of carping hath fayed but ill-fauouredly with you; you will now proceed to your trade of prouing, and that by expresse Scripture: wherein you shew your selfe to be right your selfe, that is, take all your owne fansies for expresse Scripture, and though your conceits be such, that are more worthy to be derided than answered; yet the matter, you say, is so cleere in it selfe, that it needeth no reason for proofe of it. The expresse Scriptures on which you so much stand, are the name of the Agonie, the Houre, and the Cuppe, with this one sentence, My soule is on euery side heauy vnto death. About these you brabble, going neither backeward nor forward, but heaping vp a few generall phrases of mightie sorowes and excessiue paines, you iterate the very same that you often sayd before, and adde not so much as a piece of a reason, that should stumble a man of any vnderstanding. And touching your hell paines, or the second death, you lay that on soaking till your proouing be ouerpast, and then we shall heare of it at Lands end, when you are lightned of your burden.
            
               Defenc. pag. 115. li 3. 
               First no Christian doubteth (I suppose) much lesse denieth that Christs most wofull agonies and complaining, belonged properly and directly to his Passion and sacrifice: and that they expressed a part thereof, yea as I thinke not the least part, but his whole sacrifice consisted in afflictions. The prince of our saluation was consecrated through afflictions. Therefore, afflictions, sorrowes and paines were the cause of his agonies and complaint: not his religious
               The Defenders maner of reasoning is as illogical as his matter is false. 
               feare, not his piette or pitie.] Somewhat it was, this gecre was Drawen from you; it commeth not so vnwillingly, but it commeth as vntowardly from you. First to the forme, and then to the matter of your argument. Your conclusion is a strange kind of creature, it hath to much, and yet it hath too little. For before you can exclude religious feare, pittie and pietie from the cause of Christs agonie or complaint, you must adde (onely) to your inference, and say, Afflictions, sorrowes, and paines, were the onely cause of Christs agonies and complaint. Otherwise with one part you exclude another, as if a man would say, that your head is not part of your bodie, because your heele is; which would put all your reasons in daunger to be drawen out of your heele, and not out of your head. And yet as defectiue as your conclusion is one way, it is as excessiue another way. For these words (were the cause) are stollen into this conclusion, of which there was no mention in your premisses; and so your precedent propositions are of one countrey, and your conclusion of another, they haue not so much as entercourse eche with other; where by the rules of reason and Art, there should be nothing in your conclusion, which is not exactly specified in your premisses. Your maior beginneth with (belonged to) your minor proceedeth to (consisted in) and your conclusion huddleth (was the cause of) which are rather like forkes to skatrer, then rakes to gather the parts of your syllogisme together. If to hale in your conclusion, you will amend your assumption, as you must; and say, that afflictions were the onely cause of Christs sacrifice, we shall more wonder at this monster, then at the former. For besides the falsenesse of it, in that it is vtterly repugnant to all truth, since the causes of Christs sacrifice, were sinne in vs, needing it, Loue in Christ proferring

it, and Iustice in God requiring it; how come the parts of any thing to be the causes thereof? Afflictions suffered were parts of Christs sacrifice, and not the causes. And therefore you must pray the Printer to stampe you a new conclusion before any part of this argument will haue passage.
            The premisses be as good, as the conclusion. For they haue neither any certainety nor veritie in them. [Christs agonies and complaint belonged directly, you say, to his Passion and Sacrifice.] Belonged, what is that? as an Antecedent, Adiunct, or Consequent? as a necessary, or a voluntarie pertinent? It will be long before you draw any good conclusion from this belonging. Againe, Christs agony, if you take it for all that Christ did or suffered in the Garden, how diuers and how different parts had it, as inward affections of feare and sorrow, desire, and zeale; humble, often, and intentiue prayer, besides the comfort of an Angell, and sweate like blood, and sundry other things which I haue mentioned before? all these belonged directly to Christs action in the Garden. Wherefore hereafter, afore you professe such cleerenesse in your reasons, either vsesuch words as the Scripture doth, or foretell vs how farre you extend, and what you intend by the words which you bring. Your minor is worse where you say [but Christs whole Sacrifice consisted in afflictions.] For where is the puritie of the Sacrifice, which must be vnspotted; the dignitie, which must counteruaile the offence; the voluntarie presenting thereof to God, that it might be accepted as meritorious, and not inflicted as ignominious? yea, where is the Sanctification of this Sacrifice, which required not onely prayer, but pietie and charitie, as also humilitie to commend it to God? All these things were in Christs Sacrifice, as chiefe and maine respects; which you haue blotted out with expressely falsifying the Scriptures, to make roome onely for hell paines. For though we haue no doubt, but God in his secret wisedome and iustice did Hebr. 2. 
               consecrate the prince of our saluation through afflictions, yet the Scripture sayth not wholy, or onely through afflictions, as if neither sanctitie, nor submission, nor pietie, nor pitie, nor obedience, nor willingnesse, nor any thing else were requisite, but only to suffer affliction. The Scripture fairely intendeth, that God, who had tried the obedience of his Sonne in all kind of holinesse and righteousnesse, would now trie him by affliction, that the perfection of his graces and gifts might be sacred, and shewed to the vttermost in these things, wherein it is hardest for the nature of man quietly and willingly to endure the hand of God. Therefore God would also consecrate the prince of our saluation by affliction, but not onely by that, as if nothing else were needefull in the author of our saluation, but onely affliction; which assertion hath in it an heape of huge absurdities and impieties. This is your drawing of expresse Scriptures to serue your vnlearned and vnsetled fansies, that where you would professe to be strongest, there euery child may perceiue you to be weakest.
            
               Defenc. pag. 115. li. 11. 
               If you say these were afflictions in him, I answere, they properly belonged to his holinesse as parts thereof, and were not immediatly, directly, nor properly in him as the wages and price of sinne.] You be soone wearie of your proofes, that you since come to your answeres, and there in steede of trueth you runne for refuge to your wonted termes, of immediately, directly and properly, as the wages and price of sinne. But leaue your termes for another time, and shew vs some proofe besides your owne preface, that either the sacrifice for sinne might haue nothing in it but onely afflictions, or that the religious feare of Gods power and wrath against sinne, and hartie sorrow for displeasing God with our sinnes, are no afflictions, or no necessarie parts of Christs sacrifice for sinne. For if you faile in those, your great promises of cleere cases & expresse Scriptures, are idle and emptie florishes. Your replying, that these properly belonged to his holinesse, as parts thereof, is meere trifling. For Christs affections and submission in all his sufferings, were parts of his holinesse, neither could any paines make any impressions on his soule, were they neuer so grieuous, which were not also religious. And so much the very words, which you bring in fauour of your cause, confirme. For God did consecrate him through afflictions to be the prince of our saluation. What is consecration by God, but holinesse deriued from God, and accepted of God? if then Christ were consecrated

by his asflictions, they wrought no impressions, nor af
                  •…
               ections in his soule, but such as were SACRED and religious.
            Yf you doubt, whether the parts of holinesse may be painefull and greeuous vnto the soule of man, looke either on repentance, compassion, zeale or charity in vs, and see whether as well in our owne causes as in other mens, they may not be painefull and greeuous to the mind, euen when they be also faithfull & religious. Repentance doth or should worke in vs an inward, earnest, and harty sorrow, that we haue displeased and prouoked God with our sinnes. I aske whether penitent sorow be not painfull, because it is religious and faithfull? Were it not painfull, it were no sorow, much lesse repentance, or an acceptable sacrifice to God. Psal. 51. 
               A troubled spirit is a sacrifice to God, a broken hart thou (God) wilt not despise. When we do voluntarily afflict our owne soules, because we haue displeased him, he is pleased in mercy 1. Corin. 11. vers. 31. 
               not to iudge vs, since we iudge our selues. Saint Iames saith, Iam. 4. v. 9. 
               Clense your hands ye sinners, and purge your harts ye wauering minds; be afflicted (inwardly in soule) and sorow and weepe; he meaneth in respect of their continuall and manifold sinnes. Is this asfliction and sorow not greeuous to men, because it is religious? [It is no punishment of sinne, you will say. Saint Austen saith it is, whose iudgement I farre preferre before yours. Psal. 90. 
               Iniquitas

                  . Vis non puniat, puni tu. All iniquity, be it little or great, of necessity must be punished, either by man repenting, or by God reuenging. For he that repenteth, punisheth himselfe. Certainly then either thou must punish it, or God will punish it. Wilt thou not haue him to punish? punish it thy selfe. Then in vs sorow for sinne is a voluntary, but a holy punishment of sinne, and is in all the godly both grieuous and religious, and the more grieuous the more religious. Since then voluntary sorow for sinne committed, which is repentance, is an higher and acceptabler sacrifice to God then vengeance, shall we thinke, that our Sauiour, who was to yeeld God his due for vs in all things agreeable to his person,Inward and voluntarie sorrow of the soule is a sacrifice to God. did omit this excellent sacrifice of inward and infinite sorow, for that our sinnes so much displeaseth the holin

               rforme both, then we are? the like I say of the feare of Gods wrath when we haue prouoked it. We ought not only to reuerence that most excellent maiesty, but when we haue sinned, to feare and tremble before that power, which can doe with vs what he will. And though we hope in his mercy, yet that doth not breed any neglect of his power, which if we doe not feare, when we haue prouoked, we doe despice. And therefore Moses giueth this for a rule of true deuotion and submission vnder the mighty hand of God; Who knoweth the power of thy wrath? for according to thy feare, (that is as thou art feared) so is thine anger. The lighter account we make of his anger, the heauier shall his hand be to vs. The more we feare it without distrust, the lesse we shall feele it. For submission and sorow doe mitigate the wrath of God, which carelessenesse and contempt do aggrauate. Since then no man knew the power of Gods wrath against sinne so perfectly, as Christ did; and yet the infinitenesse of Gods power did passe the reach of Christs humane soule to comprehend, why might not the manhoode of Christ yeld greater feare and trembling to the power of Gods wrath against our sinne, for which he was to satisfie, then all men liuing were able to do, and yet together with the fearefull impression thereof retaine a religious submission thereto?
            In compassion, when we feare for other mens dangers, or grieue for other mens harmes, is not this affection painfull to vs, because it proceedeth from mercy, and

Did I not weepe saith Iob, with him that was in trouble? Was not my soule in heauinesse for the poore? When the Apostle willeth vs to Rom. 12. 
               mourne with them, that mourne; Doth he meane we should make a pastime of it, because it is an affection of mercy and charity? Doth not daily

experience teach vs, how much the miseries of those, whom we dearly loue do bite & pinch vs? Can we forget Dauids 2. Sam. 19. ver. 1. & 4. affection aud affliction for Absolon? Doth not the Scripture describe all naturall mothers in those words.? Matt. 2. v. 18. 
               In Rama was a voice heard; mourning and weeping, and great Lamentation: Rachel weeping for her children, & would not be comforted, because they were not. In godly zeale and care we shall find the like. 2. Cor. 11. 
               Who is weake, saith the Apostle, and I am not (as) weake? who is offended, and I burne not? yea the Psal. 69. 
               zeale of thine house hath consumed me, saith Dauid. Then are feare and sorow proceeding either from piety or charity no whit the lesse grieuous, becauseThe highest degrees of religious feare and sorow were in Christ. they are religious, but rather the more inwardly we are touched with either, the more acceptable is that affection to God, specially when it concerneth his owne power or honor. And consequently as the highest degrees of religious feare and sorow were in Christ at the time of his propitiating the holinesse and iustice of God for our sinns, so were they in him as sharpe and painfull, as any his afflictions, which otherwise he felt in his body.
            
               Defenc. pag. 115. li. 15. 
               That these should or could afflict Christ so much aboue his strength and patience, is more then strange. Easily they might aboue his strength, since he would vse no strength, but weakened himselfe of purpose to feele the smart and burden of our sinnes; but not aboue his patience, since he did not repine at any of these, but requested by praier to haue the punishment of our sinne proportioned to the weaknesse of his humane flesh, considering the infinite power of Gods wrath most iustly prouoked by our sinnes.
            
               Defenc. pag. 115. li. 17. 
               It were no vertue but sinne in any, to giue way to our affections (though about good things) immoderately beyond our patience and strength of nature.] It is no sinne, but vertue, to presse both our strength and patience to the vttermost for Gods glory in things commanded by him. As in louing God, Bernardus de diligendo Deo. 
               modus est sine modo diligere, the measure is to loue him without measure; so in all the dueties which God requireth, the most that we can doe is not too much. Feare and sorrow then, which are, as the Apostle speaketh, 2. Corin. 7. vers. 10. 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , according to God, or for God, that is, obedient to Gods will, are neuer immoderate, neither bring they danger of life, or defect of grace, as worldly feare and sorow do. But how commeth your disc
                  •…
               etion to charge Christes affections with immoderation? For your hell-paines you are content to plunge his bodie, and chiefly his soule into astonished and all comfortlesse confusion; and for submission to God, and confession and apprehension of the iustnesse and greatnesse of his anger against our sinnes, you will not giue him leaue being our Agent and Intercessour in his owne person to present that to God, which is due from vs and for vs; euen inward sorrow for Gods iust displeasure, and an humble feare of his mightie power, thereby to honour the one and preuent the other, when he now addressed himselfe to make full satisfaction for our sinnes.
            
               Defenc. pag. 115. li. 19. 
               Though they somewhat molest the minde, yet in trueth they are most pleasing and delightfull to good men, not tedious, much lesse painfull vnto death.] The Apostle himselfe answereth this obiection, and telleth you, that Heb. 11. 
               no chastisement FOR THE PRESENT seemeth to be ioyous, but grieuous; yet AFTERVVARD it bringeth the quiet fruit of righteousnesse to them that are thereby exercised. Our Sauiour by this example teacheth the same: Verily, Iohn 16. 
               Verily I say vnto you, ye shall weepe and lament, but your sorow shall be turned into ioy. A woman when she trauelleth hath sorrow because her houre is come; but as soone as she is deliuered of the childe, she remembreth no more the anguish, for ioy that a man is borne into the world. To say that paine is pleasure, and sorrow is delightfull, fighteth against Nature, Scripture, and euen against common sense; but God doth diuersly comfort the affliction of his Saints with ending, easing, or otherwise recompensing them, whereby the faithfull 2. Cor. 4. 
               faint not, though their outward man perish, because our light affliction, which is for a moment, worketh to vs a farre exceeding and euerlasting weight of glorie. Though then our Sauiour was on euery side pressed with sundry sorowes, which would not end but in his death, yet that doth not proue them to be either irreligious, or vtterly comfortlesse, since Heb. 12. for the ioy that was set before him, he endured the crosse, and despised the shame; and 
               Reuel. 3. 
               ouercomming sitteth with his Father

in his throne. By which confession of our Sauiours we must learne, that he vsed no power to repell or rebate his paines, but that he had as sensible and tender feeling of all his sufferings in the weaknesse of his flesh, which he with obedience and patience subiected to that burden, as any man could haue, and rather more, in that he willingly layd aside his strength, whiles he suffered for sinne.
            
               Defenc. pag. 115. li. 21. 
               You do very ill to make these parts of Christs holinesse proper parts of his satisfaction, and the maine causes of his agonie and complaint. And woorse you doe, if you ascribe them not to any paines in him at all.] And what doe you to acknowledge no cause in Christ of his complaint or agonie, neither religious, nor naturall, but only the paines of hell; and to seuer the inward sacrifice of an afflicted spirit from the outward sacrifice of his bodie, for the purgation of our sinnes, since he wanted in no point that was required or accepted of God, but yeelded that to him, which was due from vs, in farre more excellent and perfect maner than we can comprehend? It is therefore voluntary blindnesse and deafenesse in you, to shut eyes and eares at all sorts of religious sorowes and feares, when you reade that Christ feared and sorowed in the Garden, and so to pitch on the paines of the damned, which haue no witnesse in holy writ, that nothing can remoue you or content you, but your owne conceit.
            
               Defenc. pag. 115. li. 25. 
               Secondly, the summe of these fore-noted texts must be considered, namely, that Christ expresly wished sundry times in his dreadfull astonishment, suddenly euen against Gods knowen will in one respect: and here are expressed (with his strange astonishment) his mightie sorowes, and feare of them partly felt, and partly further to come.] After a large promise of cleere proofs and expresse Scriptures for so great and weighty matters as these are, you trole out your owne false and absurd conceits no way gathered from the Scriptures, but violently vrged on them with more rage than reason, and now so often refuted, that a man would be wearic, if not ashamed, to spend so much time in these idle repetitions of the selfe-same misapprehensions and misconstructions of some words of the Euangelist. The summe of all these fore-noted texts is, that the Euangelists say, Christ professed his soule was heauie vnto death; that the Apostle addeth, he was heard in that he feared, that himselfe on the crosse sayd, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me. All these places are already handled and cleered, and no paines of the damned or of the second death found any thing neere to any of these words. What meaneth then this importunitie to obtrude them againe as fresh and new proofes, without any farder paines bestowed on them, then bar

                  •…
               ating of? only two poisened rootes you haue added to them out of your owne store, the one is the dreadfull and strange astonishment during all the time of Christs praier in the Garden; the other is the sundry suddaine wishes of Christ in that astonishment euen against Gods knowen will, which things, as your maner is, you proue by your owne authority painting them out with dreadfull, strange, and mighty words, when your proofes be weake and childish. That Christ praied suddainly and sundry times against the knowen will of God, is a false and wicked position, and as directly repugnant to the Scriptures, as any thing may be. Saint Luke saith his praier was Luc. 22. v. 42 
               Father, if thou wilt, take away this cup from me; And the Apostle saith, he was heard, in that he feared. So that not only you auouch this thing against expresse Scripture, but you bring the sonne of God within the compasse of vnaduised and faithlesse praiers, which you excuse with as false and lewd a deuice, because he was past sense and memory what he did: whereas he well remembred, mentioned, and reserued his fathers will in his praiers, and warned his Apostles to 
               Matth. 26. 
               watch and pray, that they entred not into temptation; and constantly continued his praiers, till he was Luc. 22. 
               comforted by an Angell from heauen, and Heb. 5. 
               heard in that he

                  eared.
            
            As for his astonishment, neither doe the words vsed by the Euangelist Saint Mark import any such strange and dreadsull want of sense and memory, as you imagine; neither doe the consequents declare any such continuance, as you pretend; but in both these you prescribe your owne will ro be the rule of your faith. First the word 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                signifieth either admiration alone, or 
                  •…
               ls a mixtion thereof with some feare vpon any suddaine or strange sight. When the Creeple, that lay at the beautyfull

gate of the temple asking almes, was healed by Peter and Iohn; the people seeing him walking, and leaping, and praising God, were filled with admiration and astonishment, and flocked to Salomons porch 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , euèn amazed. This affection in them Peter expresseth in the next verse after this sort. Acts 3. v. 12. 
               Ye men of Israell, saith he, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , why wonder you at this? 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , or why looke you so steadfastly on vs? so that stedfast beholding, and inward admiring are the force of this word in that place. When Christ returned from the mountaine, where he was transfigured, to his nine Disciples, that were disputing with the Scribes; Mar. 9. v. 15. 
               All the people as soone as they saw him, 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                
               were amazed, and came to him, and saluted him. In neither of these places can we imagine, the people were stroken with such great feare, that should take their senses from them; and in this last it is expressely written; they ranne and saluted him: which argueth, that 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                importeth a sudden admiration sometimes without feare, and sometimes permixed with feare for the sight of some strange or vnknowen thing. So the people when they saw him cast out vncleane spirits with his word, Mar. 1. v. 27. 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , were all amazed, and asked one of another, What thing is this? What new doctrine is this? And the women that went earely to Christes sepulchre, and Mar. 16. v. 5. & 
               saw a yong man sitting clothed in a long white robe,

                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , Be not afraid. In none of which places the word signifieth any hellish paine, or confusion; but either admiration, or such sudden feare ioyned with some wondering, as a strange or vnknowen sight breedeth; though we feare no hurt towards our selues. And of these very words of Christes sorow, and feare or astonishment vsed by the Euangelists, S. Ierom saith; Hieronym. in Matth. ca. 26. 
               Caepit contristari: aliud est enim contristari, aliud incipere contristari. Christ began to be sorowfull: for it is one thing to be sorowfull, and another thing to begin to be sorowfull. And so Origen: Origen. in Matth. tract. 35. 
               Capit pauere vel tristari, nihil amplius tristitiae vel pauoris patiens nisi principium tantum. Christ began to be afrayd or to be sorrowfull, suffering no more but onely the beginning of feare or sorrow. And consider, sayth he, Ibidem. 
               the Euangelist sayth not he was afrayd, or he was loaden with sorow, but he beganne to be afrayd and sorowfull. There is great difference betwixt sorow, and the beginning of sorow. And so he expoundeth Christes words; My soule is heauie vnto death; that is, Heauinesse is begunne in me, so that I am not altogether without some taste thereof.
            
            The continuance thereof the Scripture noteth not to be such that either bereaued him of memorie, or hindred his prayers: for both he persisted in earnest and humbleChrist did not pray in astonishment. prayer, wherein he was heard, and carefully warned his Apostles that were with him, to watch and pray, that they entred not into temptation. Now prayer requireth not vnderstanding and memory alone, but faith also. Of euery man that would pray, Saint Iames sayth, Iames 1. 
               Let him aske in faith, and wauer not: for he that wauereth is like the waue of the sea tost with the winde. Neither let that man thinke he shall receiue any thing of the Lord. And where by these tastes and touches of feare and sorow you would insinuate your hell paines partly felt, and partly further to come; S. Austen telleth you that August. 83. qu

               cognitu facile est, nullum metum esse nisi futuri & imminentis mali; it is easie to know there is no feare but of future and imminent euill. As also: Ibidem. 
               Nihil erat inter omnia genera mortis illo genere execrabilius, & formidolosius. Amongst all kindes of death there was none more execrable and formidable than that kinde of death on the crosse, which Christ died. So that what Christ feared, was to come, and not present; as also he might haue a naturall mislike and feare of that kinde of death, respecting as well the paine, which would be intolerable, as the exactnesse of patience required more in him than in all men liuing, because he might admit no declining nor disliking the sharpnesse thereof in the weakenesse of his flesh, were it neuer so grieuous. This I speake of his bodilie paines, besides the feare and sorow that his soule might apprehend for the weightie worke of mans redemption then in hand.

               You skip this kind of feare, when you recken but foure kinds: for this was neither a religious care, nor doubtfull feare, nor desperate, nor damned feare, but a right naturall feare in Christ.] As though the ground of all these were not a naturall feare and dislike of hell

paines. For why doe the faithfull decline them, the weake conflict with them, the desperate sinke vnder them, and the damned lie confounded in them, but because nature abhorreth and shunneth all kind of paine, and consequently the greatest, which is hell, with the greatest detestation that may be? You after your surly sort presume, that Christ really felt in the Garden the paines of the damned; I admitting no such deuice, did yet sufficiently comprise all kinds of feare concerning hell in that diuision of mine, since if they were presently felt of Christ, as they are of the damned, his feare of them must then needs be a damned feare, or rather paine, because he had, as you defend, a present sense of them, as the damned haue. And therefore if you misse no more in your conclusions, then I did in my partition, your reasons would passe without any iust reproofe.

               Dauid wanted sometime the present feeling of Gods comfortable spirit, and mourned dolefully for the want of it, albeit yet he was not destitute of his spirit inde
                     •…
                  de: which also himselfe knew well enough. And thus did Christ euen in his greatest plunge of woe: for then he called God his God resolutely.] The example of Dauid maketh nothing for your hell paines to be suffered in the soule of Christ, but very much against them, and yet betweene Dauids case in that Psalme and Christs, there is no comparison. For Dauid then was not pressed with any outward affliction, but stroken with an inward doubt of Gods fauour towards him, whom he had so greatly offended with adultery and homicide, and so long dallied with before repentance. Christ contrariwise was neuer pressed with any doubt or distrust of Gods fauour towards himselfe, but the weakenesse of his flesh was burdened with extreame and intolerable paynes. What affinitie then had Dauids feare of reiection with Christs sense of affliction? and yet were they like, what gaine you by that? Dauid was truely penitent, when he made that psalme; and true repentance I hope putteth not men into the paines of hell. Againe, Dauid you confesse was not then destitute of Gods spirit, which also himselfe knew well enough. But the spirit of God is life to the soule of man, and quickeneth it. Ergo Dauid, though he wanted the full peace and ioy of conscience, which he calleth saluation, yet he liued in soule, and was farre from the second death. How much more then was Christs soule free from all these things, in whom was the fulnesse of Gods spirit with all his gifts and graces any way needfull for the Sauiour of the world, though glory were differred, and ioy diminished for the time by excesse of paine? To wish ease of paine, or to grieue at the sharpenesse therof, is naturall vnto man, and therefore may well be graunted to haue bene in Christ; as also to lacke the fulnesse of ioy and comfort, till his sufferings were ouer past. But he neuer wanted the ioy of saluation, nor assurance thereof, and therefore he doubled his inuocation on the crosse, saying not onely, My God, my God, but Father forgiue them, and Father into thine hands I commend my spirit: and in the Garden he resolutely pronounced as often, if not oftner, Mat. 26. vers. 39 42. 
               O my Father. Which words doe most apparantly prooue, that Christ had neuer any other perswasion, suspition, or feare, but that God was his God, and his Father, and therefore most certainly bare towards him a fatherly loue and affection; though he knew it was his Fathers will, he should inwardly and outwardly grieue a while for our sinnes, and so receiue ease by death, ioy by Paradise, and glory by his speedy and heauenly resurrection.

               Thirdly adde hereunto Christs owne expresse wordes, when in this season he prayeth that this houre, and this cup might passe from him. That which this houre and this cup doe signifie, the same is the proper and principall cause of this agonie: but what can be ment by this houre, vnlesse the paines of his suffering set and appointed by God for him to be are at his determined time from Gods iustice for sinne? What is this cup, but the bitter taste of the same paines, aforsaid? this I hope was not his holinesse and sanctification, which so troubled and molested him, nor his piety, nor his pity.] If you permit our Sauiour to be the interpreter of his owne wordes, as he was the speaker, then neither this hower, nor this cup import any thing suffered in the garden. After his agony past, and praiers ended in the garden, Christ said to his Disciples, b 
               Sleepe henceforth, and take your rest, behold THE HOWER

               draweth neere, and the Sonne of man is giuen into the hands of sinners. And so to the Iewes, that came to approhend him,

               sorow and feare, as his other sufferings? Was not the Cuppe mixed that he dranke; and the houre long enough to comprise all that he suffered? But what maketh either of those for your hell paines? Was there no Cuppe for him to drinke, nor time for him to suffer, except your hellish torments were interposed? His sufferings then are confessed, though no feare nor sorow might besiege him, but such as was ioyned with obedience and patience; and in the midst of his afflictions he neither neglected submission to God, nor compassion to men. You with the one would exclude the other; and I see no words nor cause, but both might be ioyned in one houre and one Cup, whatsoeuer you pretend to the contrary.
            
               Defenc. pag. 110. li. 23. 
               Nay finally he himselfe expresseth the true cause, euen his excessiue paines, his ouerabounding sorowes and anguish; saying, My soule is full of paines, or full of sorowes euen vnto death. Heere he nameth the cause.] You are a man of much intelligence, that out of Christs words would conclude his sorow to be the cause of it selfe. For where by Christs agonie, if it be largely taken, you must meane his feare, and his sorow confessed in that speach, My soule is heauy (or sorowfull) vnto death; You make no more adoe but auouch, that Christ here nameth sorow to be the cause of his agony, that is of his sorow. For if by his agony you meane his bloudy sweat, from these words to that part of his action in the garden you shall neuer make any consequent. The Euangelist expressely saith, There appeared an Angel from heauen comforting him, and then falling into an agonie he praied more earnestly, and in that vehement praier his sweat was like drops of bloud. He was comforted before this last praier, and therein rather with the intention of spirits for zeale, then with the remission of them for feare, he did sweat, as the Scripture noteth. Now whereof receaued he comfort, but of his sorow? and what is comfort but a depulsion or mitigation of sorow? what sense then can it haue, to say, that after Christs sorow was eased and comforted from heauen, his sorow decreasing, his agony of sorow so much encreased, that he sweat bloud for very sorow? how hang these contraries together, which you would hale out of Christs owne words? In the former part of his action in the garden, wherein he praied the cup might passe from him, he said his soule was heauy (or sorowfull) vnto death. We enquire the cause of this sorow. You answere, that Christs owne words expresse and name sorow to be the cause therof. What is this, but to collude with Christs words in making his sorow to be the cause of his sorow, which in a more generall and confused word you call his agonie? but with vs the cause of his sorow is in question; to that you neither can, nor doe say any thing out of Christes words; out of your owne conceit you presume, that Christs Pa. 116. li. 31. 
               excessiue paines (then felt,) and the intire want of feeling of Gods comfort, and nothing els was the proper and principall cause of that sorow. But these be your additions and expositions, they be no part of Christs words, nor meaning.

                  ell. I shew

not there the cause of Christs agonie and feare, I shewed it of purpose in the beginning. Why did you not refuse that?] You extend it so farre according to my wordes, yea your maine purpose is to make that the cause of Christs agonie in the garden and on the crosse; onely you would vse some cunning in the carriage of it, first to make sorrowes and feares the cause thereof, and at the next step to aske what sorrowes and feares could those be, but the intolerable sorowes and horrors of Gods fierie wrath equall to hell. And to this end you quote both the Catechisme, and the notes in the great Bible here, to shew the cause of Christs agonie to be these horrible sorrowes and torments, as the Catechisme sayth, of future and euerlasting death. Why then are you so nice, when you fully intend it, in shew to denie it? [why did you not refuse that in the beginning?] The causes, that might concurre in Christs agonie, I shewed in my sermons out of the auncient Fathers agreeing with the Scriptures; why should I repeate it againe in my conclusion, you bringing nothing against it, but a few voluntarie and emptie words, which I know no man so vnwise as to regard without better proofe? [pa: 118. li. 32 
               There is no other sorrow in the world to be found, which can be imagined to be the cause possibly.] You erre as well in aggrauating Christs agonie aboue that the text auoucheth, as in assigning a false cause thereof out of your owne fansie. Feare and sorrow the Scripture affirmeth in Christ, if we so interprete the words, as you doe; but such feare, and such sorow, as cannot be found in the world, except the feares & sorowes of the second death, this is your bold assertion no way mentioned, nor purposed in the Scriptures, nor grounded on any sound reason or experience. For where the paines of some kinds of bodily deaths be often greater then mans nature can endure, and therefore violently part the soule from the body; what did hinder the paines of Christs body on the crosse, to be such, that they pressed his patience to the highest degree, since he would not strengthen his flesh to sustaine the paines of hell, as you pretend, but layd downe all power, that he might feele the smart and anguish of his bodily torments as tenderly, as any man could? Now what paines in others ouerwhelme the senses, and hasten death, as passing the strength of mans nature, why might not euen the same bodily paines in Christ so presse his humane weakenesse; that he felt himselfe able with patience to support no more, and so prayed on the crosse for an end thereof; and foresaw so much in the Garden, which made him earnest, if it were possible, to decline it? What can be sayd against this sharpenesse and bitternesse of bodily paine, since in all Martyrs and malefactours their deaths declare, that paine in the end doth so preuaile, that the rage thereof is vtterly intolerable to mans nature, and therefore sundereth the soule from the body with extreme violence, as exceeding all human

You would needs tell vs, that Christ in soule was as sharpely touched, and with as great vehemencie of paine, euen as the reprobates themselues, and more if it might be.

selfe, but that your cunning is such, that then you did, and yet you doe forbeare to vnfold your generall and ambiguous speaches. You persist still in your old song, and say that touching the vehemencie of paine, this is true. As though remorse, reiection, desperation, and expectation of euerlasting confusion, and fire were NO PAINES to the soules of the reprobates. Why play you with the name of paine to and fro after this sort? Why role you sometimes to feares, sometime to sorrowes, sometime to paines, as the causes of Christs agonie; and those sometime apprehended by the mind of Christ, sometime really inflicted by Gods immediate hand? what Christ did, or might apprehend, you neuer declare; you thinke it enough to tell vs, hisDefenc. pag. 52. li. 35.

Yea besides apprehension and conception of mind, you bring in your hell paines at your pleasure, as an inherent and absolute torment really inflicted on the soule of Christ by Gods immediate hand, as it is on all the damned after this life for the vengeance of their sinnes; and when you are asked the proofe of these things, you affourd vs figures and phrases to stuffe out your wallet.
            
               Defenc. pag. 119. li. 1. 
               Why doe you not bend your odious outcries and accusations against the authoritie before truely cited, which maintaineth the same so fully and amply, as I deliuer it?] The Catechisme hath some generall words, that Christ conflicted with all the powers of hell, not as suffering them, but as resisting them, and that he endured horrible feares and griefes of mind to satisfie the iudgement of God, and to pacifie his wrath. These words if you will stretch to what please you, they may seeme to haue some seedes of your error, though not the buds and branches thereof: but as they be generall, so if we reuoke them to the grounds of the sacred Scriptures, which was no doubt the writers and the allowers meaning, then may we extend them no farder, then we haue warrant in the word of God to iustifie them. The feares and horrors, which you would conuert to the reall suffering of the temporall hell, the Catechisme referreth to the feare and horror of euerlasting death; which you confesse ChristDefenc pag. 99. 
               most perfectly knew concerned him not at all, and by no meanes could euer possibly come neere him. How then doe you concurre with the authoritie, which you cite, saue that you peruert some generall words there vsed by misapplying them to your fansie? Otherwise feares and sorrowes, to satisfie and pacifie the wrath of God against our sinnes, Christ might haue, and yet be farre from the paines of the damned, and the second death, yea from the terrors and confusion of the wicked; since he knowing the iustnesse and greatnesse of Gods anger against sinne, and how impossible it was for him with patience to support the power thereof, either in soule, or in body, might giue God his due by inward and euident sorrow for sinne, and feare of Gods power, by which the fiercenesse of Gods indignation against sinne was rebated and calmed, and so much paine proportioned to the weakenesse of Christs flesh, as should not exceede the patience of his humane nature. But this doth no way further your hell paines suffered in the soule of Christ, since these religious feares and sorowes, which mitigate the wrath of God, though they be painefull in themselues, yet haue they no communion with the feares and sorrowes of the reprobate, much lesse of the damned.
            
               Defenc pag. 119. li. 5. 
               What reason haue you against our assertion? Verily only this you oppose, because all the sorowes of the reprobate are but sinfull guiltinesse of conscience, or feares of iudgement foreseene, which is executed onely in the next life; you meane onely in the definite and locall hell. Which is no refutation of my assertion, that Christ was as sharpely touched with paine, as the very reprobate.] When men affirme strange and new positions in Christian religion, they must not aske what reason can be brought against them, but they must shew where that they teach is written in the word of God, or ineuitably concluded from that which is written: forRom. 10. 
               faith is by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. So that if you take vpon you to be a Coiner of new Creeds, we must not beleeue you, till by

Shew then, where these comparisons and positions are written; if not, feare the plagues appointed for such as adde their lies to the Trueth of God. And yet to exclude all comparison betweene Christ and the reprobate in this case, what better reason can be brought, than that Christes feares and sorowes had no soci

               tie nor affinitie with the feares and terrours of the reprobate? for no rule of reason alloweth you to compare things together, that haue no likenesse betwixt themselues. You make Christ and the reprobate, yea and the damned, equall in paine, and Christes paines superiour to the sharpest of theirs, and yet when all is sayd, there is no kinde of likenesse betwixt their paines.

               Though the wicked in this world did neuer suffer any reall effect of Gods burning wrath working actuall vengeance on their soules for sinne, but only some guiltie remorse or feare, and nothing els, yet this letteth not but that Christ whom God ordained extraordinarily and alone to be in this life a whole and absolute burnt sacrifice for all sinne, did feele and suffer the same truely, properly, and perfectly.] You were of opinion in your Treatise, and set it downe resolutely for one of your new-made Maximes, That the
               Trea. pa. 77. li. 5. 
               paines and sufferings of Gods wrath did ALVVAYES ACCOMPANIE THEM that are separated from the grace and loue of God. And euen there you also affirmed,li. 9. 
               Christ suffered the horror of Gods seuere iustice LIKE THEM, who be separated indeed from the grace and loue of God. If you stand to these words, you must confesse that Christ suffered the horror of reiection, confusion, and desperation, LIKE to the reprobate, which is euen as the reprobate doe suffer it; and then ineuitably you fasten on the soule of Christ a plaine persuasion, and inward feeling, that he was for the time reiected, confounded, and seuered from God, as the reprobate be, which whether it will amount to open impietie, I leaue to the Christian Reader to iudge. Your cunning in two leaues after, with as touching the vehemencie of paine, is a giddie deuice, when you haue made their horrors like, then to restraine it to the sharpnesse of paine: for thereby you doe not intend to make their horrours vnlike, which before you pronounced to be like, but that their horrours being LIKE, their paines can not be vnlike. Since then paine and griefe of minde is a necessarie consequent to horror, as it is to feare and sorow, you doe not recall, but confirme your former imp
                  •…
               etic, That Christ hauing the same horrour of Gods iustice and wrath, which the reprobate haue, must needs haue the same paine; forsomuch as that horrour is not without paine answerable to it in the soule of man despairing the goodnesse of God, and beholding nothing in God but his terrible and fierie indignation against sinne. That the wicked haue ALVVAYFS these horrors accompanying them in this life, is a great and grosse vntrueth; the 73 Psalme doth auouch the cleane contrarie:Psal. 73. ver. 
               Loe these are the wicked, yet prosper they alway. So that they for the most part liue here in pleasure and abundance, neither are they plagued with (other) men, but

               receiue their good things in this life, saue when the wisdome and iustice of God is pleased to make some of them examples vnto others: for then these inward terrours of minde raised with remorse of sinne, and feare of iudgement to come, doe desperately, finally, and vtterly ouerwhelme them. This now you begin to see, which before was not within your thoughts, and therefore you now affirme, that though the wicked did suffer no such thing as you before sayd they ALVVAYES suffered, yet this doth not hinder, but Christ did feele and suffer the same. What doth not hinder, is not the question, but what doth helpe you to proue that Christ did suffer your new-made hell from the immediat hand of God in the garden, or on the crosse. I hope you bring it not for an argument, that the wicked do not suffer it in this life; ergo Christ did suffer it. That were very strange both Logicke and Diuinitie.

In Christ then these were more sinfull than in any other, if after so cleere and constant promises and oaths secretly decreed, formerly reuealed, and lastly proclaimed by God from heauen, the Sonne of God should stagger, and wauer in the full and immoueable persuasion and resolution of Gods most gracious purpose and promise, faith and fauour towards him. Wherefore his apprehension of Gods wrath against our sinnes must be such as might not call the loue that God bare towards him in any question; but he might well beholde the iustnesse and greatnesse of Gods displeasure against our vncleannesse, and knowing full well the power of Gods wrath to exceed infinitely the strength of his humane nature, with sorow and feare due to so great, and yet so str

               For proofe whereof that which before I alleged out of Iob and others, that euen the godly heere want not experience of the sorowes of hell sometimes, you passe ouer answearing nothing thereunto. Which being so in the godly, it must needes be in Cain, Iudas, and the reprobates, farre more direfull and intollerable sometimes.] Such proofes doe well become such a cause. The godly are sometimes afraid of Gods displeasure, and are persued with the tentations and snares of Satan. Ergo they feele the very torments of the damned. What shew of reason is in this which is worth the answearing? and yet how often haue I repelled this peeuish presumption; and obserued, that if desperation which is the greatest torment of this life, be but aHeb. 10.

Which may soone be gathered, though not so soone be measured. For the destruction and confusion of the damned may better be feared then knowen, forsomuch as the Scripture threatneth that, as the full wages of wickednesse, and highest degree of Gods displeasure against sinne. But you are vnansweared you say.] Some weighty reasons belike, that require so exactly an answeare.

               The members of Christ doe wrastle with the power of darknesse, and endure the fierie darts of the diuell.] A learned reason, and like the maker. Doth the Apostle there speake of hell torments, or of the temptations to sinne, busily offered by Satan to all the godly? if your conceit of hell paines be true, we must wrestle, not with the powers of darknesse, but with God himselfe, by whose immediate hand, as you imagine, the paines of hell are inflicted on all mens soules. As wisely you quote, that the members of Christ endure the fierie darts of the diuell, where the Apostle willeth them to take the shield of faith, wherewith they may quench all the fierie darts of the Diuell. Whence if your corruption and misconstruction of the text were true, may be drawen a good argument against your hell paines to be suffered in the soule of Christ. For the shield of faith (as the Apostle noteth) quencheth all the fierie darts of the Diuel, which you presume to be the fierie paines of hell. Christ then, who wanted no perfection of faith, endured none of these fiery darts of the Diuel, since they are all quenched by faith. Choose now, whether by your owne reason you will charge Christ with infidelity, or discharge him from enduring your fierie darts of the Diuel, which you suppose to be the paines of hell, except you play with this place to no purpose. Howbeit in these words the fierie darts of the Diuel are not the torments of hel, but either dangerous tentations, which quenching our faith consume and wast our consciences, as fire doth where it taketh hold; or els sinnes, which inflame our harts with wicked and worldly desires, making them burne with vnlawfull and vngodly lusts.

               Iob crieth out, The arrowes of the almighty are in me, the venom whereof doth drinke vp my spirit, and the terrors of God sight against me.] Out of these metaphors, wereby Iob describeth the vehemency of that disease, wherewith the Diuel strooke himIob. 2. 
               from the sole of the foot vnto the crowne, You shall neuer conclude any thing for the paines of

hell. Metaphors make no direct conclusions in doctrine, but serue to resemble, or amplifie the things, to which they are applied. Then as venemous arrowes doe not only teare and wound the flesh, but the poison added doth inflame the whole body, and consume the vital spirits; so Iob complaineth, that his disease did not only rot, but burne his flesh, and wast his spirits, so that the paine thereof was intolerable. By the terrors of God, he meaneth the terrible and bitter affliction sent from God, and not the paines of hell, as you fondly conceaue. For that these wordes are applied to the greeuousnesse of his disease, appeareth both by Iobs speach and wish.Iob. 6. ver. 12 
               Is my strength, saith he, the strength of stones? is my flesh of brasse, that it can endure the rage of this disease? Wherefore he wisheth,Iob. 6 ver. 9. 
               that God would destroy him (with this sicknesse) and cut him of (by death,)vers. 10. 
               then should I yet haue comfort, though I burne with sorow, let him not spare.
               vers. 11. 
               What is mine end, that I should prolong my life? Iob wisheth not here destruction of body and soule, that were more madnesse; but he desireth an end of his life, that he might haue rest and comfort. Then doth he not meane the terrors of conscience, which bring with them a most vncomfortable end, but the terrors of hisIbid. ver. 21. 
               fearefull plague, which death would ease, & not augment. Not that I thinke Iob wanted dangerous tentations in his greeuous afflictions; but that this may be referred either to the greatnesse of his plague, or to the vnquietnesse of his mind, though he alwaies trusted in God, and was forced with extreamity of paine to desire ease. He may also meane, as he after saith,Iob. 7. v. 14. 
               Thou fearest me with dreames, and astonishest me with visions; but none of these three terros were the paines of hell, neither did Iob desperately rage in his mind, but felt violent torments in his flesh, as he himselfe confesseth.Iob. 7. ver. 5. 
               My flesh is clothed with wormes, and filthinesse of the dust, my skinne is rent, and become horrible.
            
            And touching the terrour of God, that word in the sacred Scripture doth not necessarily import the paines of hell, nor the conflict of conscience with doubt or despaire of Gods fauor, but the greatnesse of his power, and righteousnesse of his iudgements, which we must confesse with feare and trembling.Psal. 88. 
               From my youth (sayth the Psalmist to God) I suffer thy terrours. Shall we thinke, that he was all his life long in the paines of hell, or that he liued in perpetuall affliction, which continually humbled him, and made him afrayd of the mighty hand of God?Prou. 28. 
               Blessed is the man (sayth Salomon) that is alwayes afrayed (of God): where he doth not account the paines of hell to be blessed, but he meaneth as the Apostle doth, that we should worke our saluationPhil. 2. 
               with feare and trembling. And so the Saints at the sight of Gods presence are afrayd, not with an hellish paine, or perfidious feare, but with a quaking and trembling at so great Maiestie, knowing that power andIob. 25.

               The like terrors doth Ionas seeme to feele in the fishes belly, when he cryed to the Lord out of the bottome of hell.] You doe well to say it seemeth, for indeede neither haue the words any such force, neither had Ionas any such meaning. The word Sheol noteth the graue as well as hell as I haue else where sufficiently prooued; and in this case the Whales bellie may resemble the graue by the very direction of our Sauiour.Matth. 12. 
               As Ionas (sayth he) was three dayes and three nights in the Whales belly; so shall the sonne of man be three dayes and three nights in the hart of the earth. Where Christ expresseth his buriall, and not his discent to hell, by the Whalles belly, in which Ionas lay. And Ionas himselfe sheweth by his prayer, that he ment the present danger of death, wherein he was, and not the paines of hell, of which he speaketh not. For besides the discription of his danger, when he saith,Ionas 2. 
               The flouds compassed me about, all thy surges and all thy waues passed ouer me, the weeds were wrapt about mine head, and I went downe to the bottome of the mountaines: His praier declareth his faith in the beginning, middle, and ending thereof. I cried in mine affliction vnto the Lord, and he heard me; I sayd, I am cast out of thy sight. (not to be amongst the liuing any more) yet will I looke againe toward thine holy temple. Thou hast brought vp my life from the pit, ó Lord my God.

               When my soule fainted, I remembred the Lord, and my praier came vnto thee into thine holy temple. So that Ionas sainted with feare of death, but not with the paines of the damned, who I troe do not

               Dauid wanted not the like in his manifold and fearefull agonies many times.] Though I exempt neither Dauid, nor any of Gods saints here on earth, from
               2. Cor. 7. 
               feares within, and sights without, and troubles on euery side, as the Apostle speaketh of himselfe, yet is there no proofe, that Dauid euer suffered the paines of the damned; his words conuince no such thing. Sheol which you would now turne to signifie hell, though in the words of Dauid applied to Christ by Peter in the acts you stiffely refuse it, standeth indifferent to note the pit prouided for the body, which is the graue; or prepared for the soule, which is hell. So that out of a word admitting this double signification, you can neuer inferre which sense you please, but by some other sound and sufficient circumstances. Againe, there are but two places, which cleerly confesse, that Dauid was compassed or ouertaken with the snares, dangers, or troubles of Sheol, the 18 Psalme, and the 116. In the first of which it is more then euident, as well by the occasion of the Psalme, as by the variation and coniunction of other words, that Dauid ment the danger of death, which often beset him vnder the persuit of Saul, and other his enemies, as the manifest words of holy writte do witnesse. For this is the inscription of the Psalme.2. Sam. 22. 
               Dauid spake vnto the Lord the words of this song in the day, that the Lord deliuered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul. So that the snares and ropes of death, which he speaketh of in that Psalme, were apparantly the manifold dangers of life, which his enemies, and chiefly Saul put him in. Secondly, the titles, that he there ascribeth vnto God, proue that in his persecutions Dauid neuer doubted of Gods goodnesse towards him, but in all his troubles held that for his chiefe hope and help.Psal. 18. v. 1. 
               I will loue thee deerly (saith he) ô Lord my strength.
               2. 
               The Lord is my Rocke, and my fortresse, and my deliuerer, my God, my Rocke, in him will I trust; my shield, the horne of my saluation, and my refuge;
               3. 
               I will call vpon the Lord, which is worthy to be praised, so shall I be safe from mine enemies. Thirdly, the words there declaring his dangers, and yet at last the destruction of his enemies, argue as much. For he saith, Ibid. vers. 4. 
               The ropes of death compassed me, the floudes of vngodlinesse (that is of the vngodly) made me afraid. The
               5. 
               ropes of Sheol enuironed me, the snares of death ouertooke me. And so for the persons of his enemies he saith,Ibid. vers. 18. 
               They preuented me in the day of my trouble, but the Lord was my stay; the Lord rewarded me according to my righteousnesse, because I kept the waies of the Lord. His seuering his enemies from God, and iustifying himselfe, not in the sight of God, but in respect of them, proueth all his intention in that Psalme to be touching his enemies, whom by Gods aide and might hee
               vers. 37. 
               persued and consumed, wounding them, that they fell vnder his feet, and whose necks were giuen him, that he might destroy them that hated him.
               vers. 41. 
               They cried vnto the Lord (sayth he) but there was none to deliuer them. This no way concerneth the diuell nor his tentations, much lesse any paines of hell from the immediate hand of God; but most euidently the plots of men that were his enemies, and sought his destruction. The other Psalme maketh the like profession vpon the like occasion, and affirmeth, that God heard Dauid, and inclined his eare vnto him, when the
               Psal. 116. 
               snares of death compassed him, when the straights of Sheol found him out, when troubles and griefe tooke hold on him.
            
            In other places, where Dauid saith, that his life or Soule was deliuered and saued fromPsal. 30. & Sheol, and euen from the86. 
               lowest Sheol; it is indifferent, which sense wee follow, since no doubt he did ascribe the euerlasting Saluation of his Soule from Hell vnto Gods goodnes and mercie, no lesse then he did the preseruation of his life from the Graue. And therefore I shall not neede to discusse any of those places, which admit both constructions, and yet bring not your hell-paines into this life any whit the sooner. Againe when Dauid speaketh of feares, ropes & snares of hell, if it were graunted, that Dauid intended as well the inward assaultes of Satan to subuert his soule, as the outward perils of his life to shorten his daies, it helpeth not your cause. For the gates euen of hell, (that is the power thereof) preuaile in this life against all that are not of Christs true church, and often compasse and besiege the faithfull; and1. Pet. 5. 
               the roaring lion, (that) goeth about seeking whom he may deuoure, is neither idle, nor vnable

to take hold of mens soules by sundrie sinnes, tentations, deceits, and snares, (if he be not stedfastly resisted by faith) and to make them the children of hell, not by the present suffering thereof, but by preparing, and obliging them to the wrath to come. Of the Scribes and Pharises Christ saith, Matth. 23. vers. 15. 
               You compasse sea and land to make one Proselyte, (that is a nouice of your profession) and when he is gotten you make him, filium gehennae, the child of hell double to your selues. Shall we hence conclude, that the Scribes, and Pharises, and all their Proselytes were heere on earth in the true paines of hell, and of the damned, because our Sauiour, who can not erre, pronounceth them THE CHILDREN OF HELL? or shall wee rather accept Christes owne Exposition, where he saith, Ibid ver. 33. 
               O Serpents, generation of Vipers how should you escape the (future damnation or) iudgment of hell? Lastly as the name of God is added figuratiuely to manie things, to signifie the beautie and excellencie thereof in their kindes, as the Psal. 36. 
               hilles of God, and the 80. 
               Ceders of God, for faire and goodlie hills and trees; so the name of hell is vsed in detestation for that, which is fearefull and intolerable, as the sorowes of hell and straights of hell and such like. Whereby it is euident, that you may dreame of Dauid, as you doe of others, that he felt in this life the paines of hell or of the damned, but if you sett your selfe to prooue it, you must bring stronger stuffe then such wordes, as besides their diuers significations, haue manie figuratiue translations and applications, which will not serue you to conclude any thing for your hell paines suffered in this life. These are the mightie proofes, that were vnanswered, which indeed I neglected, as prouing nothing, and so would yet haue donne, had not you so mouthly called for an answeare, as if the things had beene verie materiall, which in truth are weake and faint.

That they are somtimes inwardly and fearefully either tormented by satan, or by their owne consciences, I easily admit; but what is the feare of hell either in the elect, or in the reprobate, to the true paines thereof, which the wicked after this life shall feele? that they feele an horror confounding them, I neuer denied; as also the godly may feele a terror pursuing them; but if you determine this to be all the torment the wicked shal find in hell, you were best take heed of deluding Gods iudgments against sinne, and playing with fiery words in steed of euerlasting fire. It is another manner of torment, that there abideth the damned, then this guilt of conscience, remorse of sinne, and a fearefull expectation of iudgement and fire; in which the wicked sometimes lead their liues with horror and confusion; and yet it is open blasphemy to ascribe any of these horrors or feares of the reprobate vnto Christ, since they vtterly quench all persuasion of Gods fauour, loue, and patience towards them, which if we affirme of him, we wrap him within their reprobation.

               The Diuels are many times out of the locall hell, as when they are in this world. But Diuels are neuer released of hell sorrowes. Therefore the true sorrowes of hell are euen in this world: and then possibly may be inflicted on wicked men as they are on Diuels which are sometimes out of the locall hell.] We speake of men here liuing on earth, and you runne to Diuels ranging in the aire, or compassing the earth, for proofe of your hell-paines. Which is as much, as if you did plainely confesse, you can find no Scripture to prooue that mortall men in this life may endure the torments of hell. For the example of Diuels inferreth no more the paines of hell to be suffered of men in this life, then the presence of elect Angels here on earth doth prooue, that men in this life may enioy the perfection of Gods heauenly ioies and glory; since the angels of God whithersoeuer they goe, or wheresoeuer they are, cannot be depriued or diminished of that inward power and light, blessednesse and glory in which they are confirmed for euer. With Angels elect or reprobate men after this life shall haue a resemblance and conuenience; the faithfull (saith Christ) shall be Matth. 22. 
               as the Angels of God in heauen, and the cursed are cast 
               Matth. 25. 
               into euerlasting fire, prepared for the diuell and his angels: But in this life, except we will waxe mad, we must make no equiualence betwixt their estates and

ours. So that from the diuels condition to mans in this life there is no consequent, more then the imitation and communion of his wickednesse in the reprobate, whose children they are because they fulfill his desires, and an expectation and feare of his punishment. Otherwise as the earth is neither heauen nor hell, no more is mans life on earth matchable with the ioyes of the good, or paines of the bad Angels; which haue the place of their abode determined, and assigned them in heauen or in hell, saue when they are sent, or loosed by God, to attend the execution of his will. And yet if the place of hell had no greater nor other paines then the diuels alwayes carrie with them and in them, why should they so much feare to be 
               Luc. 8. v. 31. 
               sent into the deepe, or 
               Iudae epla. v. 6. 
               be reserued vnto the iugdement of the great day, and 
               Peter 2. ca. 2. 
               kept vnto damnation? feare they without cause, or are they kept and reserued to no more, nor worse paines then already they feele? That is no reseruation, where there is nothing but a continuation of the very same that was besore. It is certaine therefore, howsoeuer you presume the contrarie, that the place of hell hath greater paines euen for the diuels, then they feele any heere on earth, or before the last day, and howsoeuer their inward confusion and desperation doe horribly persue them in all places since their fall, yet a more fearefull torment abideth them in hell, and especially when the last iudgement commeth, which is the set time that shall torment them by addicting and fastning them to eternall and intolerable fire.
            
               Yet the sorrowes of hell are in the world.] By such logicke you may prooue the paines of hell to be in heauen, and the ioyes of heauen to be in hell; and so make a full confusion of all things, which well becommeth your newe found faith. For the Scriptures beare witnesse, that Satan not only Luc. 10.

               I saw the Lord sit on his throne, (saith Michaiah the Prophet) and all the host of heauen stoode about him on his right hand, and on his left hand. Then there came foorth a (lying) spirit, and stoode before the Lord, of whom the booke of Iob testifieth, that 
               Iob 1. v. 6. 
               when the children of God came, and stoode before the Lord, Satan came also among them. Certaine it is, that Satan and his angels sinned euen in heauen, and were cast out of heauen after their defection from God, carrying alwayes with them, and within them, the losse of their originall brightnesse, and the chaines of inward and fearefull darknesse, whereby they find themselues reiected from Gods sauour, despoyled of their former light and glory, and reserued for the iudgement of the great day, at which they tremble, as well as at the place of their perpetuall imprisonment, where their torments are, and shalbe increased, though they be neuer freed from that horrible confusion, in which they lie. And therefore they scare the place prouided for them, and besought Christ neither 
               Luc. 8. 
               to send them into the deepe (and bottomlesse pit) nor to 
               Matth. 8. 
               torment them besore their time. Neither was there onely transgression, reprobation, and confusion in the place of heauen, where the Angels sinned, and whence they were cast, but of the blessed Angels S. Iohn saith, that one of them Reuel. 20. 
               came downe from heauen, hauing the key of the bottomlesse pit, and a great chaine in his hand, who tooke the Dragon, which is the diuell, and bound him, and cast him into the bottomlesse pit, and shut him vp, and sealed vpon him. And were it doubtfull of Angels, how they could retaine the measure of their brightnesse and blessednesse in the place of hell; yet heare we Dauid confesse of God himselfe, and of his spirit; If I ascend to heauen, thou art there; if I get downe to hell, thou art there. So that the very fountaine of all holinesse and happinesse is in heauen, earth, and hell, and yet the states of these three places are not confounded, because the perfection of all goodnesse is present in euery of them. The goodnesse and glory of God is not so fastned vnto places, that either

Paradise or heauen did priuilege men or Angels from sinne, as heauen did not the diuels, nor hell it selfe can hinder the happinesse of the blessed Angels, when they are sent with power from God to execute his pleasure. And yet this doth not confound the distinction of places, or states in heauen or hell, but that heauen is now the place, where the brightnesse of Gods glory is reuealed to his Saints, besides their internall and continuall vision of God, which maketh them most happie, and neuer leaueth them, whethersoeuer they goe. And therefore the Angels that sinned, were cast thence, that they should not defile the place of Gods presence with their wickednesse; and hell is likewise the prepared mansion for the diuels, where vengeance from God is powred on them, and greater shall be, when after iudgement they shall be closed in perpetuall prison, though till that day some of them be suffered to beare rule in the aire, and to worke in the children of disobedience, for the triall of the saints and farder setting forth os Gods most glorious wisedome, power, and rightcousnesse.

               Lastly the true ioyes of heauen may be out of the locall heauen, as when the glorious Angels haue bene and tarried some while here on earth with men. Yet did they neuer for a moment want the toyes and glory of heauen.] From Angels endued with inward and heauenly light, power, holinesse, and happinesse, and by grace euerlastingly confirmed therein, no argument can be drawen to our weake, sinfull, and variable condition; neither doe we dispute of Gods power, what he can doe, but of his will and ordinance, whereby he hath appointed heauen to be his seat, that is the place, where his glory is

The Angels of God

Can these things be attributed to mortall men here on earth without open and palpable heresie? Wherefore it is an erroneous and presumptuous inference, that Defenc pa. 120.

               It is possible for Gods goodnesse to communicate some reall foretasie thereof vnto some blessed men also.] A taste of glory, which neither continueth nor satisfieth, can not be called heauen, which is the perfect and perpetuall fulnesse of all kinde of blisse, and want of all kinde of miserie. S. Peter teacheth vs that God 1. Pet. 1. 
               begetieth (vs) into a liuely hope, to an inheritance incorruptible, vndefiled, and vnchangeable, reserued in the heauens for vs, who are by the power of God kept by faith vnto saluation, readie to le shewed in the last time. If the taste of glory, which you talke of, be not immortall, immutable, & vndefiled with any defect or miserie, it may not be called heauen, nor be sayd to be the inheritance reserued for vs in heauen. And therefore though some blessed men haue had a sight of some glory, which you call a taste thereof, as Moses, Esay, Steuen, and others; yet that doth not proue them to haue beene really in the ioyes of heauen. How osten is it written of the Israelites, that they saw the glory of the Lord; and yet they were ouerthrowen in the wildernesse? Exodus 24. ver. 16.

               The glory of the Lord (saith Moses) abode vpon mount Sinai, and the sight of the glory of the Lord was like a consuming fire on the top of the mountaine in the eies of the children of Israel. So when Aaron offered his first offering for his Priesthood, and blessed the people; Leu t. 9. v. 23 
               The glorie of the Lord appeared to all the people: of whom God saith, Numb. 14. vers. 22.

And when all the children of Israel saw the fire, and the glory of the Lord come downe vpon the house, they bowed themselues with their faces to the earth vpon the pauement, and worshipped, and praised the Lord. I trust the King, the Priests, and the People were not all in the ioies of heauen; and yet they all with their eies saw the glory of God there presented before them; and such as were religious and obedient, saw it to their exceeding ioy.

               That God doth indeed reueale some reall tast of his heauenly ioies to his children euen in this life, I haue already shewed, but am not answeared.] You slide from some blessed men to all the children of God; to whom, you affirme, God doth reueale indeed some reall tast of his heauenly ioies euen in this life. What you meane by a reall tast, we must learne from your owne mouth; by such doubtfull phrases, which you may after wrangle about, you vse to deliuer your doctrine. If you meane ioy in the holy Ghost, whiles by hope we expect the promises of God at his determined time, that indeed is common to all the children of God in their measure; but that teacheth a maine difference betwixt the things heere enioined, and reserued for vs in heauen; and quite crosseth the new heauen, which you would establish. For we learne by the Scriptures, that our Coloss. 3. 
               Life is hid in Christ, and when Christ, who is our life, shall appeare, then shall we also appeare with him in glory. 
               1 Iohn 3. 
               Now we are the sonnes of God, but yet it doth not appeare, what we shalbe: and we know, that when he shall appeare, we shalbe like him: for we shall see him, as he is. Our knowledge, loue, and ioy of God and in God, beginne heere by the preaching of the Gospell, and the working of his spirit; but the Scripture neuer calleth those the ioies of ueauen, though they shall there continue, yet so augmented, and accompanied with heauenly brightnesse and glory, that they shall not be the same, they were. For as our naturall vnderstanding and sense, and corporall life and flesh shall not be abolished in heauen, but abide and be glorified, and yet no man is so senselesse, as to thinke or say, the glory of our creation is the glory of our resurrection: so our knowledge, loue, and ioy, which heere are weake, and wanting all perfection, as being mixed with ignorance and error, lust and vnlawfull desires, feare and griefe, and often obscured, and almost ouerwhelmed with infirmity, iniquity, and misery, no wise man will defend to be the ioies of Gods heauenly kingdome where is no want, nor defect of any good, nor feare, nor doubt of any euill inward, or outward; but as God shall then be all in all, so shall we be filled with the sight and fruition of God; our loue and ioy increasing according to our knowledge, which then shalbe the manifest vision of God face to face, who is the vnceasing and vnsearchable fountaine of all goodnesse and blessednesse.
            The Treatis. pa. 80 proofe, on which you stand as yet not answered, is a place of the Apostle to the Corinths, applied by many men to the preaching of the Gospel, & then it maketh nothing for your purpose; but if it be referred to the ioyes of heauen, as you would haue it, it maketh quite against you. For 1. Cor. 2. 
               eye hath not seene, saith the Apostle, neither eare hath heard, neither hath mans heart conceaued, the things which God hath prepared for them, that loue him. If those be the ioyes of heauen, which the Apostle there meaneth, then is it euident, that men are not capable of them, whiles they are compassed with sinne and infirmitie, but God hath reserued them in the heauens for vs, when we shall come to his presence, though in the meane time 1. 2. 
               he hath reuealed to vs by his spirit, that such things are kept in store for vs, which then shall appeare, that is, be apparently and perfectly bestowed on vs, and we euerlastingly inuested with them. The Reuelation which the Apostle here speaketh of, is the reuelation of knowledge, whereby these things are promised and assured vnto vs, not the reuelation of glory, whereby we shall see that, which we now hope for; and enioy that, which we now expect.
            This doctrine, howsoeuer you would delude it with your reall tasts, is plainely deliuered in the Scriptures. When Moses besought God to shew him his glory, God answered; Exod. 33. ver. 20. 
               Thou CANST NOT SEE my face, and liue; for there shall no man see mee,

and liue. Where God doth not meane, that men shall not see him in heauen, when they come to be Matth. 22. 
               as the Angels of God, who Mat. 18. v. 10. 
               alwayes behold the face of God in heauen; his owne sonne hath sayd, Matt 5. 
               blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God; and his Apostle likewise, 2. Cor. 13. 
               Now we see through a glasse darkely; then (shall we see) face to face: But he meaneth, that no man liuing in this mortall flesh can see his face. Otherwise it is the cleere resolution of the Scriptures, that we 1. Iohn 3. 
               shall see him as he is, that is, not by faith, as now we doe; nor by some created shew of his glory, as Moses, Elias, Esai and other the Prophets and Patriarkes did see him for the confirmation of their callings, or consolation of their miseries, but as the Apostle speaketh face to face. Vpon these words of S. Iohn, we shall see him as he is, S. Austen learnedly and truely sayth. August. in

This fruite of her whole labour the Church now trauelleth with by desiring it, but then shall attaine by beholding it.

God hath not defrauded cleane harts of the sight of his substance, since that is promised to those which serue and loue God, as the great and chiefe reward; the Lord saying, when he appeared visible to the eyes of their bodies, & promised himselfe inuisible to be seene of cleane hearts; he that loueth me shalbe loued of my Father; and I will loue him, and will shew mine owne selfe vnto him.

               The transfiguration of Christ on the mount declareth, that some reall part of heauenly glory may be heere on earth, which you your selfe somewhere confesse cleane against your selfe.] You would needes tell vs in you Treatise, that heauen was some foretaste of the infinite ioy prepared for the godly, which you attempted to prooue by the Apostles words common to all the children of God, and thereupon concluded; thus you pa. 80. li. 23. 
               see that as there is heauen in this life in some measure, euen so there may be hell. I replied that if you Conclu. pag. 337.

               affirmed of heauen, as you did of hell, that the VERY SAME IOYES which are in heauen, or EQVALL with them, are heere sometimes found (in vs liuing) on earth, it was a wicked error flatly repugning to the trueth of Gods promises, and to the very nature of our Christian faith and hope. We reasoned not of Christs manhoode, which Colos. 1. 
               in all things had the preeminence aboue and afore all the sonnes of God,, but OF THE CODLY, whom you expressely named, and of whom I accordingly replied, and to whom those words of the Apostle cited by you for proofe of your purpose doe precisely pertaine. For of Christ they are most false, that his eye neuer saw, nor his eare neuer heard, nor his hart neuer conceiued the things, which God hath prepared for them, that loue him. Now when you should prooue that mortall men, and no more then men, though the members of Christ, liuing heere on the earth haue THE VERY SAME IOYES, which are in heauen, or EQVALL with them; you run to Christes transfiguration on the mountaine, and by that you would inferre, that there was heauen euen in this life in some measure. But first where can you shew, that Christes transfiguration on the mountaine is called heauen in the Scriptures. Next, what deriuation can you make from Christs power, knowledge, and glory, to ours heere on earth? Christs soule had many parts and degrees of heauenly perfection in this life, which ours haue not; he

was free from sinne and error, which abound in vs; he was full of trueth and grace, which want in vs, saue what we receiue from his fulnesse; he was the way, the light, and the life, that leadeth, lightneth and quickeneth euery man comming into the world; yea the crosse of Christ was the wisdome and power of God. These and many other maine differences the Scriptures expresse betwixt Christ and vs; so that from his perfection and preeminence to our weakenesse, wickednesse, and wretchednesse in this world no comparison can be made, nor any consequent, but that beleeuing in him, louing him, and obeying his commandements, as we are heere regenerate and renewed by his spirit, so we shalbe conformed to his image, to raigne with him in the next life, if we suffer with him in this life. Christs transfiguration then is not called heauen in any Scripture, neither had it the perfection or condition of heauen; since heauen is not a transitory taste of mutable ioy or glory, but a full and euerlasting possession of all power, honour, and blisse communicable from God, and proportionable to the receauer. But if Christ had the reall fruition of heauen in his flesh heere on earth, how much more in his soule, which was alwaies full of trueth and grace, light, and life; and hauing so reall a tast as you speake of, and so immeasurable a fulnesse of life and grace, as the Scriptures speake; I greatly maruaile how you come really to place hell and heauen in one soule together, and specially in the soule of Christ, on which you inflict the very substance of hell paines, when yet the abundance and continuance of heauenly ioy could not want in him.
            As for my somewhere confessing cleane against my selfe, that Christ transfigured in the mount tasted of that heauenly glory prepared for him; I see not how that crosseth any thing auouched by me in the 337. and 338. page by you noted. You shall do well when you challenge contrarieties, not to let the report rest on your crackt credit, but produce the words, that your Reader may be iudge of both. You are sharp enough to catch hold of any thing, if there were any cause. I called indeed Christs transfiguration on the mount a taste of that heauenly ioy prepared for him, I called it not heauen. A taste of things neither abideth, nor sufficeth, which heauen fully doth; & therefore it is rather a contradiction, then a confession of your conceit. For if you thinke that Christs heauenly glory may be defectiue or mutable, as his transfiguration was, you broch a wicked and impious error. Christs transfiguration did not exempt him from feare, sorrow, shame and death following, which if you imagine of his glorification in heauen, it is a right hellish impiety. And whatsoeuer we affirme of Christ touching his preeminence aboue all the children of men as that he was free from sinne, and full of grace, and had the perfect knowledge of Gods trueth and will aboue men and Angels, I hope you will not deriue it to his members heere liuing in the flesh, least you leaue no ground of Christian religion vnshaken.

               Onely this you haue to obiect touching men, that faith and hope is the euidence of things not seene: neither are our greatest ioyes the same, nor equall to them which we shall possesse in the next world.] I haue also to obiect, that it is not lawfull for you nor for any man liuing to determine of Gods kingdome without his warrant, nor to auouch that to be heauen, which the Scriptures doe not. Take heed, it is no pastime to play with heauen and hell, as you do, without better aslurance than you haue. Know you not what that learned Father sayth?

               Thou canst not see my face, for there shall no man see me, and liue. Moses saw as much as in this mortall life any man compassed with sinne is able to see. He saw posteriora Dei, the backe parts of God; for so God sayd vnto him: Exo. 33. v. 22

No man in this life, Christ Iesus only excepted, had euer any such vision of God, or possession and fruition of his heauenly kingdome, that he did not walke by faith, and liue by hope. Paul was

If you dare defend, that Paul in Paradise did see God face to face, then may you say, that at that time he walked not by faith, but by sight; but if that be a plaine errour, then Paul as yet attained not the sight of Gods face, nor the crowne of righteousnesse layed vp for him, which should be giuen him by the iust Iudge at that day; and consequently neither faith nor hope ceased in Paul, notwithstanding his being in the third heauen.

When a voice came from heauen to Christ in the audience of all the people, Christ answered; This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes. S. Peter, who was one of those Disciples that saw him transfigured, writeth thus of it: 2. Pet. 1. 
               We followed not deceiuable fables, but with our eyes we saw his Maiestie: for he receiued of God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloued Sonne, in whom I am well pleased. This voice, which was greater glory than his transfiguration, came in respect of them, to confirme them in their faith and obedience to the Sonne of God then incarnate; and yet to assure their eyes by sight, as well as their

For his soule within him had here on earth greater glorie continually then a transitorie change of his body, as namely the personall vnion with God, which no creature, man, nor Angell, in earth or heauen, had or hath besides him; the fulnesse of Gods spirit resting on him, by which he knew all the counsell and will of God, and all the secrets of mens

hearts; power ouer all flesh, and command ouer all creatures, which neither Saint nor Angell in heauen hath. In the glory of his body Moses and Steuen did here on earth in part communicate with him. 2. Cor. 3. Moses face did shine when he knew it not. 
               The children of Israel could not behold the face of Moses for the glorie of his countenance, which so glittered, that the children of Israel were afrayd to come neere him, & he forced to put a vaile vpon his face, when they spake with him; and yet Moses 
               Exod. 34. ver. 29. 
               wist not that the skin of his face shone bright. And likewise Acts 6. 
               all that sate in the councell, where Steuen was conuented & condemned, looking stedfastly on him saw his face as the face of an Angell, that is, bright and glorious, though Steuen knew it not no more than Moses, for ought that the Scripture noteth of him; saue that in the end Steuen Acts 7. 
               looking stedfastly into heauen saw the glory of God, and Iesus standing at the right hand of God. But the inward and continuall glorie of Christes soule heere on earth was proper to him, no man nor angell matching him therein. How come you then to attribute heauen vnto Christ for the momentarie transfiguration of his bodie, and to neglect and ouerskippe the constant and continuall ioy and glory of his soule, which far better deserued the name of heauen, than the change of his bodie?

Neither is this, as your charity speaketh, any lewd or wicked error.] My charity serueth me, and my duty bindeth me to tell you, that if you, of your owne head without the word of God, will make an heauen, or defend that to be heauen, which is imperfect, mutable, and often defiled not with misery and death only, but with weakenesse and wickednesse also, you maintaine an euident and pestilent error. The graces of God are heauenly, aswell because they are giuen from heauen, and direct to heauen, as also they assure men of heauen; but the measure of grace or ioy, which we haue heere on earth, is not the heauen, which we are willed to beleeue and expect, where our reward is, and where an incorruptible, vndefiled, and immutable inheritance is reserued for vs, and whence we looke for our Sauiour.

And therefore though there be the knowledge, loue and ioy of God, both in this life and in the next; yet the differences are so many, and so great, that no man of any reason or vnderstanding will make the one to be the other for some agreements in some points, whereas in the whole there is not only a substantiall difference betwixt them, which is the sight of Gods face, but so many parts, effects, and consequēts in the one, which are not in the other, that it is more then folly to make the one by pretence of nature to be the same with the other. All ioy in nature is the same, if by nature we meane the generall definition therof; for ioy is the impression or inward sense of good present, or instant; yea hope is in nature all one with ioy, since in hope there is ioy, as in feare there is paine, and in hope we reioice: yet no considerate diuine will confound hope and ioy together, because they differ but in time, much lesse make the ioies in this life, which are defectiue, mutable, and permixed with our infirmity, misery, and iniquity, the very same in nature with the ioies of heauen, which are abundant, constant, and sincere in all parts and effects, of brightnesse, mightfulnesse, righteousnesse, and blessednesse, which men can possibly comprehend, when they come to the presence of God. The sight of God by his creatures, by his iudgments, by his word, and by himselfe, is the same in the generall nature of knowledge; yet are there as great differences betwixt them, as betwixt darkenesse and light. The Apostle saith, Rom. 1. 
               The inuisible thinges of God, that is his eternall power and godhead, are seene by the creation of the world, considered in his workes, and that which may be knowen of God, is manifest in them. Shall we then say, the heathen haue the very same knowledge of

God by his workes, which the Angels in heauen haue by the sight of himselfe? the Diuels know him also by his workes, by his word, and his iudgements.Ionas 2.

               They were once lightened, and tasted of the heauenly gift, and were made partakers of the holy Ghost, and tasted of the good word of God, and of the powers of the world to come. Shall we auouch these reprobates were in heauen in this life, because they had once the very same graces in nature, which the elect haue? If our knowledge doe differ in this life and the next,Our loue and ioy do follow our knowledge. then doth our ioy likewise differ. From our knowledge of God riseth our loue of God, and our ioy in God. For we can neither haue loue, nor ioy of that, which we know not: but as our knowledge increaseth, so doth our loue and ioy. And therefore when we see God infallibly, as he is, then shall we loue him vnfainedly, as we ought, and reioice in him vnspeakeably, euen as much, as we are capable of, not by the strength of our nature, but by the working of his power. Till then as our knowledge is darke, and in part, so our loue is weake, and our ioy is faint; but then shall these very thinges not only rise to an higher degree, and be of another nature, but be replenished with all parts of light, power, and blisse, without which we may defend nothing to be heauen indeed, howsoeuer wee may vse figuratiue speaches to comfort, or encourage the godly. As then worke and wages, labour and rest, sowing and reaping, running and obtaining, striuing and crowning, abroade and at home, doe differ euen in nature, so faith and sight, hope and haning, promising, and performing, that is, our state in earth and heauen, doth likewise differ; though it be one and the same thing, which is now promised, beleeued, and hoped for, and which hereafter shalbe receaued, attained, and enioyed.

As for your proofe, when you shew that the paines of hell are sacred and holy, then bring them to

consecrate the Prince of our saluation. Till then, refraine this apparent collusion, to make Christ both obedient and astonished, patient and ouerwhelmed in the paines of hell; and learne that God tried the obedience and patience of his Sonne by the things which he suffered, and so consecrated or consummated him to be the Prince of our saluation; who must be conformed to his image to suffer with him, not the pains of hell, but the miseries and afflictions of this life, with all obedience to the will and counsell of God, if we will reigne with him.

the dignitie of his person, that by his death he might abolish him that had rule of death, and restore vs to life by his humilitie and obedience, which was so precious and glorious in the sight of God, that he accepted it as a full sacrifice and satisfaction for all our sinnes, and made him the authour of eternali saluation to all that obey him: but that he must be God aswel as man, to be able to suffer the paines of hell & the second death, that is a new deuice of yours, not conuerting the Godhead of Christ to the infinitenesse of his merits, but abusing it to the infinitenesse of his paines, to make place for your new-found hell from the immediate hand of God, where Scripture mentioneth no such thing in the worke of our redemption, but plainly and fairely teacheth vs, that we areRom. 5.

If therefore it be not lawfull in the highest points of faith to adde ought to the word of God, nor to thinke that the spirit of Trueth faileth or defecteth in his instruction vnto trueth, I do not see with what dutie to God you and others may be so bolde with the Sonne of God, as to subiect his soule to the second death, and to the paines of the damned, when the Scriptures offer vs no such part or point of our beliefe.

For sooth it is not. It is no more than a very naturall humane feare and sorow. It proceedeth immediately and principally from God himselfe, who is the Nature of Natures. Also mans nature is apt to receiue such sorow and feare from him. Thus the very paines of the damned are meerely naturall.] If you make vs many such conclusions, you will proue your selfe a meere Naturall.

And if men shall feele the paines of hell, why shall they not comprehend that, which they feele? They shall apprehend no end nor ease thereof, but feeling is a comprehension of the paine, though it shall be so great, that they cannot endure it with any patience. And yet since you striue for the paines of hell in the soule of Christ, aduise you whether Christ shall comprehend them, or want patience in them, and not see an end of them. For if he did suffer them, he did beare them, and comprehend them, except you make him impatient in his paines, and the paines euerlasting in him.

A third is, that Christ confessed a naturall dislike of death and paine in the weaknesse of his flesh, though his spirit did readily submit it selfe to the diuine will of his Father, and of himselfe, euen touching the death of the crosse. This sense Chysostome, Damascene and others doe bring. The fourth, that Christ here assumed and declared the weaknesse of his members, who being no more then men, should feare death; but he by suffering that affection to rise in himselfe, and repressing it, did by his grace cure it in his, when, and as he seeth time and cause. This Hilarie, Cyrill, and Austen doe like. So that Christes wordes being euery way free

               d of God, and the ground of all our prayers in the time of trouble. Thirdly, the best Greeke expositours that we haue, as Chrysostom, Epiphanius, and Theophylact,

haue conceaued the force and order of Christs speach to be such, as if that part, which you auouch to be repugnant to the rest, were excluded and denied by the words antecedent and consequent, and so to haue rather the power of a negation, then an affirmation. Lastly, many new writers acknowledge the wordes, though they were affirmatiue, may receiue an other sense: as if Christ did not desire to be free from suffering, but to be kept from fainting, vnder the burden of his passion. So Bucer.Bucerus in Iohan. ca. 12. 
               Patrem Christus or auit, vt liberaret eū à supplicio, non ne illud perferret, sed vt forti
                     •…
                  r perferret. Christ besought his Father to saue him from (the houre of) punishment, not that he might not suffer it, but that he might suffer it patiently, (or without fainting.) So Aretius.Aretius in Iohan. ca. 12. 
               There may be an other sense of this place, which is, that Christ doth not intreate to escape death, but prayeth his Fathers aide against the horror thereof. So that to be saued from this houre, is to be preserued in it, that it preuailed not against him. The wordes then of our Sauiour in S. Iohn admitting so many limitations and constructions, who but a wilfull neglecter of all learning and trueth, would so peremtorily by pretence of them conclude, that manifestly in plaine wordes, Christ prayed contrary to Gods knowen will?

               If this could not be possible in Christs manhoode without sinne, then I were a wretch to affirme so much of him; especially still to affirme it. But if it be possible by any meanes, through the meere instinct of mans nature (as it is Gods creature and free from all sinne) thus to speake and to wish suddainly, and suddainly to controle it againe, as Christ did, then what mind beare you, and how may we iudge of this your striuing, which is not to cleare Christ from all sinne in his agony?] A goodly clearing from sinne you make in Christ, that in a maze he prayed he knew not what. You suddainly take Christs memorie from him, and suddainly restore it againe with the twinckling of an eye; and thus you play with Christs sense and memorie, as men doe with tennis balles. But vnderstand you sir, howsoeuer you please your selfe with amazing Christ after this manner, the Scriptures allow no such thing, nor any circumstances of the text, where the wordes seeme most plainely repugnant as you say, to Gods knowen will, as in the 12. of Iohn. Read that Chapter who will, where are no wordes nor signes of any maze, but a perpetuall course of most excellen

                speach; in the midst whereof he confessed, that his soule was (then) troubled with the remembrance of his death. And as doubting what to desire, through the dislike that mans nature in him had of death, he yet resolueth to desire not his owne safetie from death, but the increase of his Fathers glory by his death. What signe or proofe of amazement is in this? why take you this pestilent libertie to put Christ into a suddaine maze, when pleaseth you; and as suddainly, least all the world should crie shame on you, to cleare him from it, though the cause of his maze, if there were any, still continued? you say, if it were not by some meanes possible, you were a wretch to affirme it: but you must not deuise what meanes please you, to waue the Sonne of God to and fro with suddaine and often desires, which needed correcting and controlling, and then to warfe them with want of memorie. My striuing is not against any wordes in the text, or any thing that may be iustly deduced from the Scriptures, but against your forgetfull and faithlesse prayers, which you purposely impute to Christ, because you would hemme him either within sinne, or astonishment; and then excuse him with losse of sense, and lacke of memorie. This is the maine plot, that heere you vndertake, not by proouing, that it was so; but by pronouncing, that you will haue it so; and therefore you still answere in steede of arguing, knowing that your proofes be as weake, as your proiects strong. For first youDefenc. pag. 122. li. 37.

of eminent power and grace. Againe, the word 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

So that the word neither in the Scriptures, nor in any Grammar, signifieth your hellish astonishment for intolerable paines and torments, but suddenly to stand defixed, or somewhat afrayd at an vnwoonted sight. Thirdly, the circumstances and consequents in the text, declare that Christes astonishment or feare was not such, that it tooke from him either sense or memorie. For where all vehement amazing for the time depriueth a man of motion, sense, and speech, Christ felt vtterly none of these. The very place of S. Marke, which you quote for the word ekthamb 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

               began (
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ) to be afrayd, presently sayd vnto his three disciples, My soule is very heauy vnto death: tary heere and watch. So he went forward a little, and fell downe on the ground, and prayd, that if it were possible, that houre might passe from him. Then he came, and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, Couldest not thou watch one houre? Watch ye, and pray, that ye enter not into temptation. What signes or words are here of astonishment continuing? astonishment stoppeth speech and motion, as well as sense.Rhetoricorum ad Her

               Amazednesse is, when men neither speake nor do any thing, but abide silent with their eyes open, like to men astonished with feare. So that if Christ were astonished with feare or amazed, he could neither haue done nor sayd any of those things which the Gospell reporteth he did and sayd: and therefore vnlesse you can alter the rules of nature, as you doe of Scripture, Christ was in no such astonishment as you dreame of; neither did his memory faile him in speaking those words: for then how could he not haue remem

And therefore your second obseruation, that these infinite incomprehensible and incomparable paines, which you meane, astonished,

If you say thus with me, then must you say farder with me, that as soone as Christ beganne to vse speach, or conuert his cogitation to praier, this astonishment was eased; and howsoeuer feare was not altogether dispelled, yet he could no longer be said to be amazed, or to seeke what to doe. For praier to God without the mind intending, and attending it, is sinne; which might not be in Christ: and that Christ did attend his praiers, is most euident. For he both added a condition to them, and presently declared, what he ment by that condition, to witte, that he desired the bitternesse of this cup to passe, as much as Gods gratious will towards him should like, and not as the sense of mans nature in him would affect. So that here is nothing in Christes praier arguing any forgetfulnesse, or not remembring, but an euident confirmation rather of that which you would so faine denie or auoid if you could tell how; that Christ did religiously and carefully conuert his cogitations in his praiers, both to deprecate his Fathers wrath as farre as might be, and yet to giue full assent to his Fathers wil.

So that without your hell paines then inflicted on Christes soule by Gods immediate hand, and without your confused and forgetfull astonishment, the praiers of our Sauiour in the Garden did both answeare Gods ordinance in the frame of our flesh, which is not brasse, as Iob speaketh, and yet preferre the will of God for the conseruation of his iustice, before the liking of his sense, or desire of his nature. Which if you acknowledge, then are your assertions false and wicked, that Christ in plaine wordes praied contrary to Gods knowen will and this could not haue wanted sinne; had he not been astonished, when he so praied. For the praiers are facred and sound without any maze or obliuion of his Fathers will, and his owne purpose; but rather expressely remembring both, and preferring that, which indeed should be preferred, when and as it ought.

               Quare falsum omnino est, in Christo diuersam voluntatem a Patris fuisse. It is vtterly false, that there was in Christ a will diuers from his Fathers will. The naturall dislike, that man hath of paine and death, which is the rule of Gods creation, Christ calleth his will, because it was the weakenesse of mans flesh in him, as he forewarned, when he said, The spirit is prompt, but the flesh is weake, to abide the paine and horror of death; but this naturall affection when he had confessed to be in himselfe, both to shew himselfe to be a true man, and naturally affected as we are, and also to foreshew, that his death should be very painefull and greeuous vnto him, he wholly and fully submitted it to his fathers will, which indeed was his will and desire, (euen as he was man) as well as his Fathers.

Neither was there any contrariety in the particular affection of Christs mind to Gods will, as you auouch. It is a dangerous deuice of yours to make Christes will agreeable to Gods in the generall disposition of his mind, but repugnant in his particular affection; which you would excuse with a greater error of Now wanting this remembrance; But Gods will was as Christes was, that Christ in his humane nature should haue an vtter dislike and horror of death, which yet for the loue of man, and obedience to God, he should submit to that will of God, whereby he would haue the punishment of our sinnes tedious and gr

the one despising and conquering death, which was his diuine will answeareable to his Fathers; the other fearing & shunning death, which shewed him to be a true man.

When then he saith, if it be possible, let this cup passe from me, and not as I will, but as thou wilt; he declareth nothing els, but that he was compassed with true flesh, which feared death. For to feare and shunne death, and to be astonished (or perplexed) therewith, is proper to flesh. Now therefore (that is at this time, when he spake these wordes) he permitted his fl

He sayd Christ corrected not his speech, as if he had before spoken amisse; I say, he did correct his speech, making it being good to be better.] You can not, by your leaue, thus winde out from your lewd assertion, that Christs prayer could not haue wanted sinne, had he beene in perfect remembrance without astonishment. If Christes prayer were good without the latter addition, which you call a correction; ergo it was not repugnant to the knowen will of God, much lesse sinne in it selfe, but that Christ now wanted remembrance by reason of his infinite and incomprehensible paines. You would faine daube vp these dangerous conceits and conclusions, but your morter is vntempered. If Christes desire were good, as now you grant, before this correction (and how could any thing be but good, which proceeded from him?) then which way inferred you your hell paines out of that prayer? where is the ground of your conclusion, that Christ sinned in that prayer, if he were not astonished, because it was in plaine words contrarie to Gods knowen will? Is any thing good, that is contrarie to Gods knowen will? Faine you would, and yet you know not how to keepe this geere vpright.

It may be pardoned by your rule for want of memorie; but that is no commendation of any goodnesse in it. And yet if we venture to pray without faith, it is sinne so to tempt God. Neither can we be excused by want of iudgement or memorie; we may omit somewhat for want of vnderstanding, but if we commit ought vpon opinion or credulitie that it is good and lawfull for vs, when indeed it is not so, that doth not excuse our ignorance or forgetfulnesse. It is the lesse sinne, but sinne it is, and farre from goodnesse. If therefore this be all the goodnesse you ascribe to Christes prayer, you expresly contradict Chrysostome, who maketh it proper and lawfull for mans nature in the best remembrance to dislike and shun death, so we still submit our selues to Gods will, as Christ did, not to like that which is against nature, but patiently to suffer that which is according to Gods will and counsell towards vs.

               You say I am captious against Christ in not supplying one Euangelist with another. For so Christs desire will appeare to be but conditionall, therefore not contrarie to Gods will; yes neuerthelesse as touching the desire it selfe, and his particular present inclination compared to Gods particular determination herein.] If Christes prayer in the garden were heard, as the Apostle saith it was, then is it euident it was no way repugnant to the will of God: for God doth not vse to grant petitions made contrarie to his will. And then we must so interprete the sense of Christs praier, that it might take effect in his sufferings, as I thinke it did. And though we should suppose, it tooke not effect, yet since he himselfe did so condition his desire of nature, that he subiected it to the will of God; which way can you proue it contrary to Gods knowen will? Christs particular present inclination compared to Gods particular determination herein, you say, was contrary to it.] I denie that vtterly. For Christs particular and present inclination of mans nature to dislike paine and death was Gods generall ordinance in all men, and Gods speciall will in the manhood of Christ at that instant: and Christes determination was the same with Gods, since he submitted the one to the other, and resolued, as we find in his praier, with obedience willingly to vndergoe that shamefull and painfull death, which Gods iustice purposed for the sinnes of men. Yea God hath not only ordained, that the Crosse should be greeuous vnto vs, as it was to the manhood of Christ, but he misliketh, when it is otherwise; that is, if we despise his correction, because it is made tolerable by his fatherly goodnesse respecting our weakenesse. Ierem. 5. 
               Thou hast striken them, but they haue not sorowed, saith the Prophet; meaning they despised the hand of God, because it was tempered with mercy, and plagued them not vnto destruction. Then is it Gods will, that affliction should grieue vs, and he hath not only so created vs, but it is his purpose, when he smiteth to haue vs feele it, and to haue vs mourne vnder the Crosse, but yet without distrust of his goodnesse, or dislike of his counsell, though it pinch vs neuer so neere in the sense of our nature. What contrariety then to Gods will had Christs inclination of nature shunning death, and the

sharpenesse thereof, so farre as was possible, and did stand with Gods pleasure; since his resolution was the same with Gods will, most obediently to suffer it, though it seemed neuer so sharp to his flesh, which was Gods will it should? as for Balaams bad desire, I leaue it to you to comment thereon at your leasure; his wicked auarice secretly seeking after gaine, though pretending Gods name, ought not in Christes case to be so much as mentioned.

               The very nature of all conditionall desires is such, that it includeth euermore a possibility (at least) of being contrary to his will, whom we desire.] This generall obseruation of yours is not true, and though it were, it maketh nothing to this purpose. The Saints haue often prayed in full persuasion of faith yet with a condition, not as doubting, but as humbling themselues in his presence, before whom or of whom they spake. When God had sayd to Iacob: Genes. 28. 
               Loe I am with thee, and will keepe thee, whither soeuer thou goest, and will bring thee againe into this land; Iacob vowed, saying; if God will be with me, and will keepe me in the iourney, which I goe, so that I come againe into my fathers house in safetie, then shall the Lord be my God. Shall we say, because God addeth a conditionall to his vow, that either he doubted of Gods promise made vnto him that verie night, or that it was possible to be contrarie to Gods will? I trust not. So Moses confessed to God; Exod. 33. 
               See, thou hast said vnto me, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found fauour in my sight: Now therefore I pray thee, if I haue found fauour in thy sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know thee. Was Moses vnfaithfull to the mouth of God, because he maketh that a condition, which God vttered as an affirmatiue; or was there any possibilitie of the contrarie to that which God had once pronounced? Likewise the Apostles vnder conditions expresse most certaine assertions; as Paul: 2. Thes

Christ knew it was possible for Gods power to saue him from death, and yet to make him the Sauiour of the world; but as Gods counsell decreed and reuealed now stood, he knew it was not possible, the whole cup should passe from him, but that he must drinke thereof. Both these Christ affirmeth in the garden. Matth. 26. vers. 53. 
               Thinkest thou, (saith he to Peter) that I cannot

now pray to my Father, and he will giue me more then twelue Legions of Angels? how then should the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must be so? And at the second time of his returne to praier; Ibid. vers 42. 
               O my Father, if this cup cannot paesse away from me, but that I must drinke it, (that is thereof) thy will be donne. So that by the first frame of Christs praiers, Ibid. ver. 39. 
               O my Father, IF IT BE POSSIBLE, let this cup passe from me; If we vnderstand either Christs purpose to make it appeare, that his death reuealed in the Scriptures was now by Gods counsell necessarily required for our redemption, and that it was no want of power, nor neglect of his safetie, that put him into the hands of his enemies, but his owne good will obeying the wisedome of his Father for our saluation; or els that he desired the sharpenesse of the Cuppe might passe from him, so farre as was possible, that it might not ouerpresse his strength and patience; in either of these two senses the words stand well, and haue no touch of declining or disliking the counsell and determination of God to ransome and reconcile the world to himselfe by the death of his Sonne. If with Chrysostom, Cyril, Damascene, and others, we like to make it the voice of mans weake flesh in Christ, but still subiected to the will of God, there is no repugnance to the will of God, which is alwayes preferred, though there be a declining of his hand, if it were possible to stand with his will. For so long as obedience ouerruleth the sense of nature, and nature sheweth nothing but that which is ingraffed in it by Gods power and will, I doe not see what aduantage you can take, Sir Defender, at this third sense of Christes words, though we grant the flesh of man to be so created, that it shrinketh at the weight of Gods hand, and would decline it, if it might stand with Gods will. Els were it not lawfull to pray that affliction might be ended or eased, if we might desire nothing that were possible to be contrary to Gods will, since we know not his particular will touching our temporall troubles, but by the euent.

So Christ had two willes, the one proportioned to Gods creation, whereby the flesh shrinketh and shunneth paine, the other measured by Gods determination, which declared his obedience; and in either of these he accorded with the will of God, who ment not onely to strike, but to haue the stroke felt with paine and griefe to mans nature in Christ.

               Howbeit both their desires were neuerthelesse holy, made in faith, assured to receiue (as conditionall desires may be) directed aright, prepared sufficiently: yet only for this cause, seeing Dauid simply knew not Gods contrarie will, Christ knew it not at this instant.] Dauid repented his sin (with which God was displeased) the more earnestly & instantly, because he saw the dislike, which God had of his fact, was the cause of death denounced to his child. So that Dauids desire to please and pacifie God with most humble and inward submission, the rather if it were possible, to auert the wrath of God threatned to his child for his offence, had in it pietie, charitie, humilitie, and other good points of godly repentance; and his prayer for his child was pardonable, because he knew not Gods certaine resolution to the contrarie, though he heard the Prophet in Gods name denounce, 2. Sam. 12. 
               the child should surely die: which Dauid tooke to be conditionall, as other Gods threats are oftentimes, the rather to reduce sinners to more zealous and

hartie conuersion vnto God. But in Christes prayers no such thing can be pretended. His not remembring, what he knew most assuredly, and beleeued most stedfastly, could not make his prayers to be prepared sufficiently, directed aright, and assured to receiue. For neither preparation, direction, faith, nor assurance could be in the soule of Christ without vnderstanding and memorie; since neither forgetfulnesse, nor ignorance of that, which we should know, doe warrant our prayers to be holy, much lesse to be perfect, and such as are assured to be heard. And if all these conditions of faithfull and Godly prayer were found in Christs petition in the Garden, as you confesse, shew vs how they could be indeed contrary to Gods knowen will. I haue no doubt of all Christes prayers and speaches, but they were well aduised, rightly prepared, and throughly assured to be heard, that is perfectly holy, as he intended them; but Christes not remembring the will of God reuealed to him, could not performe or effect these things in his prayer, but rather contrariwise his full knowledge, and present remembrance of Gods will, with exact obedience and submission thereunto. Otherwise not remembring that, which he well knew, might excuse from sinne, if hee were so amazed, that vnderstanding and memorie failed him; but it could not make him assured to receiue, since God doth graunt their desires to such, as dewly remember, and not in such as in part, or wholy forget his will. Againe, not remembring the trueth of Gods will reuealed is not faith in any man, since faith is the sure and full perswasion of Gods will and promises toward vs, which if we remember not, how may we be said to be fully assured, and firmely perswaded of them? Wherefore you make out this matter with emptie words, as your manner is, least you should be taken tardie with a plaine error; and haue peeced together very vntowardly diuers mens places, the head not agreeing with the h

And yet the wordes themselues, which Christ vsed in his prayer, are directly referred to Gods will; and whatsoeuer Christ feared, or felt according to your conceit, he was right sure was inflicted on him by Gods immediate hand, and consequently by Gods will, whose hand doth not worke without his will, and yet seeing, and feeling it to be Gods hand, and so Gods will, you make him not remember, that it was Gods will.

               All in vaine then doe you charge me, that I stretch the Scriptures beyond their wordes and trueth, when in my discourse I shew that Christ in the Garden was astonished and grieuously perplexed, the text hauing onely he began to be astonished and grieuously perplexed.] You tooke vpon you in your Treatise, without all proofe, against the plaine wordes, and plainer circumstances of the text to pronounce, that Christ in the Garden Treat. pa. 55.
               fell amazed and sorgetfull of himselfe, and Ibid. pa. 53. could not be but astonished, ouerwhelmed, and all confounded in his whole humanitie, both in all the powers of his soule and senses of his bodie, and vnlesse this had beene in him, he had sinned in deede. The ground of all this geere you made the words of S. Marke, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , he began to be afraid and in great heauinesse. I obserued out of Ierom, that it is one thing to begin to be heauie (or sorrowfull) as the text saith, another thing to haue the Passion of heauinesse (or sorrow) to ouerwhelme the mind, as you would haue it. In this you say, I charge you all in vaine; and why so? because the Scripture doeth sometime vse the word (to beginne) where the continuance followeth. Had Ierom made no farder reason, then that Christ began to be afraid; and so auouched, that nothing beginning might proceede or continue, the places of Scripture heere heaped by you might haue made some shew; but Ierom

giueth a good reason of his words, that the passion of feare and sorrow might not be excessiue and dominant in the mind of Christ, because it is the sinfull corruption of our nature to be so ouerswayed with immoderate and suddaine affections, in which he could not communicate with vs. This reason you skip, and bend your selfe to proue, the Scripture vseth the wordes (he began) where the action had continuance. As though any man doubted thereof, but as well good, as bad actions must haue their beginnings, before they can haue any proceeding, or continuing; but doth that word prooue, that euery thing once begun is brought to an end, or that euery affection rising in mans nature groweth to the highest degree? if the word stand indifferent to signifie the beginning of euery action or affection, either interrupted before the end, or proceeding and continuing to the end and height thereof; then make those words nothing for your extreme confusion of feare & sorow growing to the greatest height, that might be, as you imagine. And that the word naturally signifieth a beginning in the Scriptures, without any necessitie that the action or affection should continue, though some might proceede and increase, where the Scripture testifieth so much, there can be no question.
            In the fourteenth of Luke, Christ shewing by a familiar example of a builder, how ridiculous and odious it is to begin a good thing, and not to performe it, repeateth the common mocke that followeth such vaine enterprises: This man

               , and beginning to sincke, cried; Lord saue me. And Iesus straightway stretched out his hand, and stayed him. So in many other places: Philip. 1.

                  ames and Iohn; but Christ presently called his Disciples vnto him, and by his speech repressed ambition on the one side, and indignation on the other. So Peter, when those that stood by him in the high Priests hall, charged him by his tongue to be one of Christs followers, Matth. 26. 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , he began to curse and sweare, he knew not the man. And immediatly the cocke crew, and Peter remembring the words of Iesus, went out, and wept bitterly, repenting his fault. An hundred examples might be brought, where the word is in the like sort vsed to signifie the beginning of any thing, as well without continuance as with, when the Scripture expresseth so much; but these are so cleere, that they admit no contradiction. And therefore Ieroms obseruation is verie true, and grounded on better reason than your refutation.

               The Text following doth inuincibly shew, that he did fully come to the extreamitie of astonishment, and began not onely. For did he but begin, when he swet clotted bloud trickling from his body to the ground? also when an Angell was sent from heauen to refresh him and comfort him: did he then but begin to be heauy?] Your fansies follow so fast without the Text, that they run headlong against the Text. That Christ was afraid, I doe not deny; that he came to the extremitie of astonishment, the Scriptures denie; howsoeuer you whiske it after your whifling maner, that you may seeme a man tried in all toyes. The extremitie of astonishment is neither to do nor speake any thing, but to be silent, and as it were without sense, as I haue formerly shewed. Your selfe doth so describe it: for you say, Christ was astonished, that is, ouerwhelmed, and all confounded in all the powers of his soule, and senses of his bodie. A man in this case hath no right vse of reason, vnderstanding, memory, speach, sight, or hearing for the time. Was Christ so? doe your impertinent pushes prooue any such thing? doe they not rather prooue the contrary? did not Christ speake, when he praied? did he not rebuke his Disciples for their sleepinesse, and admonish them to watch and pray, that they entered not into temptation? did he not fall to more earnest and vehement praier, when his sweat beganne to looke like bloud, which you in your learned conceit call clotted bloud? The strong cries and teares, which you mention, doe they not plainly reprooue your supposed astonishment, and cleerely confirme, that Christ had all the powers of his soule, and senses of his body in their full vse, when he thus conuerted them with such zeale and contention of mind to this great worke of our redemption? what Sadler or Shoemaker would conclude this to be the fulnesse of astonishment, which by so manifest circumstances cited by your selfe is irrefragablely refuted? and on you run, as if you would ouerbeare all the world with such witles words, and flaunting follies, which only serue to bewray the weakenesse of your owne conceites. Feare and sorow I admit in the soule of Christ, and religious of either kind in the highest degree, that mans nature is capable of. A naturall feare of death in the flesh of Christ I likewise acknowledge, but I make not these things which you meane, the effects thereof. What I receiue, and what I refuse in our Sauiours agonie, I haue so largely deliuered, that I must not spend paper to repeate all againe. Neither doth Ierom meane, that Christ had a touch of feare, and no farder, as you most fondly misconster him, and his wordes, where he saith, Christ began to be afraid; but he meaneth, Christ so farre admitted the pearcing and painefull affection of feare (for a time required in so great a cause) that it neither possessed him wholy, nor continually, to beare dominion ouer him, or to worke any corruption in him, which is vsuall in our affections. You make your selfe merie with the beginning, and neuer consider, that Ierom thereby excludeth the heigth of our inordinate affections of feare and sorow, such as you bring in when you all confound Christ in his whole humanitie, both in all the powers of his soule, and senses of his bodie.

For it is not onely false, and directly repugnant to the text, but it is extremely wicked and impious to bring that confusion, which you mention, and forgetfulnesse into all the powers of Christs soule, and senses of his body.

Satan doth transforme himselfe into an Angel of light, and falshood alwayes seeketh to put on the vizard of trueth. Is it not thankes worthie, that the sonne of God would leaue the vse and honour of his diuine glory, wherein hce was equall to his Father, and take vnto him the shape of a seruant with all the basenesse and weaknesse of our flesh, and with the shame and paine of his death on the crosse, make satisfaction for our sinnes, and by his blood redeeme vs to God, which is the emptying of himselfe expressed by the Apostle in the place abused and misapplied by you; but you must teach all this is skant worth thankes, if Christ did not suffer in soule the second death, which is the lake burning with fire and brimstone, and euen the very paines of the damned, that you might be indeede beholding vnto him? And what if another as wise as you, will say, that all which Christ suffered heere on earth, was not worth thankes, except he suffered in hell amongst the diuels, where indeede are the paines of the damned, which you haue lately deriued to the earth vpon your authoritie; shall this impietie also goe for good religion, because the more Christ suffered for vs, the more we are and ought to be beholding vnto him? we shall doe well to thinke, that we can neuer giue thankes sufficient for the least of his mercies; and not take vpon vs to determine, what recompence God must exact of his sonne for our sinnes, except he will be vniust, which is a most pestilent presumption and intrusion vpon the secret counsels and iudgements of God; but rather learne to lament our owne vnworthinesse and wickednesse, and not delight or dwell in sinne, which God so hated and abhorred, that nothing could appease his wrath against our vncleannesse, but onely the death and bloud of his owne Sonne.

               Remember your owne wordes out of Austen, that there is in some men INSIPIENS HONORIFICENTIA, a fond intent of honoring Christ. If there be any such, surely this is one point thereof, which you maintaine.] You applie Fathers, as you doe Scriptures; and call S. Austen foole, as well as all the rest of the learned and auncient pillars of Christs Church, because they reject your hellish confusion, by which you ouerwhelme all the powers of Christs soule and senses of his bodie, rather then you will yeeld him vnderstanding and remembrance in his prayers. S. Austen saith indeed of the Manichees, that were loath to confesse, Christ truely died a bodily death on the crosse, for feare of bringing him within the curse of a corporall death, since the death of mans bodie first proceeded from Gods curse against sinne; and therefore defended, that Christ seemed there to die in outward shew, but indeede did not die on the crosse; S. Austen, I say, affirmeth, that they with a foolish pretence of honour vnto Christ, denied the loue of Christ towards vs, and the trueth of Christ, who professed, that he should and would lay downe his life a ransome for many. What is this to the paines of the damned, or to the death of the soule, of which S. Austen saith,August. epist. 99.

For my part, as I loue and honour master Caluines name, and like well his resolutions, where he contented himselfe in the grounds of doctrine and discipline to ioyne with the auncient and primatiue Church of Christ; so when he leaueth them vpon some liking of his priuate deuices, I must leaue him. I so honour him, that I will not for loue to him dishonour all antiquitie, as if Christ had neuer any Church, nor faithfull or learned minister therein before master Caluine. And were it worth the while, I could easily shew many great and maine differences betwixt master Caluines conceit of hell suffered in the soule of Christ, and yours; but because it hath occasioned and hatched your amplified error of an other hell from the immediate hand of God, I will not trouble my selfe, nor the Reader with sifting or censuring that, which I am not bound to beleeue, no more then I am yours; till it be proued by more substantiall grounds, then master Caluins good liking of it.

               In another place, where I shewed from the more to the lesse, how Christ might haue (for the sodaine) the powers of his mind astonished, and yet no decay in him of faith, nor obedience nor patience: Like as there is not in a man a sleepe, or amazed with a blow on the head, hereupon you aske me scoffingly, was Christ a sleepe, or in a swoune?] Your answere was indeed drawen from the lesse, to the more; that is, from the lesser vanity and falsity, to the greater; and therefore my question, which you call a skoffe, was a sound refutation of such ignorant misapplying of things impertinent & vncoherent. For what if a man in his sleepe, or in a swoune, retaine habituall faith, obedience, and patience; doth that prooue, that Christ awaked and well aduised might pray, he knew not what, and yet haue actuall faith, obedience, and patience? If a man should babble in his sleepe, or grone in a swoune, before he recouer sense or vnderstanding, would you cal that faith or praier, though the habite of faith were then in him? no more doth that example prooue any actuall faith, obedience, or patience in Christ at the time of his often and earnest praiers in the garden, if all that while you make him all confounded in all the powers of his soule, and so astonished, that he could not, or did not remember his Fathers oft reuealed, and oft repeated will, nor his owne person nor office, who came vnto this houre of purpose to performe his Fathers will. And therefore you must get you some better patterns for the vse and acts of faith, obedience, and patience in Christes astonishment, then sleeping or swouning, or els ech Christian Reader will soone perceaue you to be worse then a sleep, when you dreame of aDefenc pag. 128. li. 26.

For it is euident, as I haue shewed out of Galen a sufficient witnesse of naturall effects and defects, that men throughly amazed with feare, neither speake nor doe any thing: yea no man is so very a stranger to nature, but he knoweth, that astonishment in the highest degree hindreth both sense, and motion outward and inward.

               For my life I cannot answere, this that followeth. The suffering of hell paines, which astonish and confound all the powers of the soule, and senses of the body, neither was nor could be meritorious with God. I deny (this) assumption. Not only all Christs paines were meritorious, but euen all his infirmities also: his wearinesse, his hunger, his sleep, and so his astonishment and amazednesse.] The sleightnesse of your answere doth prooue that, which I said, to be tru

               r, then you are ware of. For though diminution of strength, as in wearinesse; affliction of nature, as in hunger; and ligation of sense, as in sleepe; yea if you will, priuation of life, as in death; were meritorious in Christ, because the person, that was God and man, submitted himselfe to these infirmities of our nature, which no way peruerted nor hindered the inward powers or actions of Christes humane soule, yet that is no proofe, that such impressions, as depriue the soule of Christ of her proper and essentiall operations by confounding Reason, vnderstanding, will and memory, should be meritorious, because they all confound the very instruments of grace in the soule of Christ, which are requisite vnto merit. For though the person in Christ, which by nature did owe no obedience by reason it had an equality with God, was the chiefe fountaine of all Christs merits, which could not haue infinite price and valew, but that he was infinite, and no way bound, who wrought them by his humane nature; yet the instruments of merit in Christs manhood were his soule, and his body; and chiefly his soule by her vnderstanding and will alwaies p

               rfectly knowing, absolutely liking, and constantly performing by the presence and power of Gods spirit those things, which were most pleasing to God. So that the paines and infirmities, which you suppose in Christ, if they did confound and astonish all the powers of Christs soule and senses of his body (For so are the words of your assertion, and my assumption) they neither were, nor could be meritorious. In sleepe the senses of Christs body rested, which he could haue strengthened by power without sleepe, but that he willingly submitted himselfe to those infirmities of our nature for obedience to his Fathers will; yet euen then was the soule of Christ left free to diuine cogitations and visions, which could not want in the soule of Christ hauing the full and perpetuall possession and fruition of Gods grace and trueth, though he would want the power and glory prouided for him, till Gods appointed time. Christs sleepe then had no agreement with your late deuised confusion of all the powers of Christes soule; yea the praiers, speaches, and actions of Christ in the garden, if you then confound in him all vnderstanding, will, and memory, which are the powers of Christs soule, must by your doctrine be full of vanity, and rather distractions, th

               n religious and humane actions, as not proceeding from the direction of grace, apprehension of mind, and submission of will, but from a confusion of all these, which no Christian man can tell what to make of. And therefore you must either recall the confufion of all the powers of Christs soule; which you say was the extreamest and most violent, that might be, or worse consequents will follow vpon these desperate and false amplifications, then you yet see. For take once from Christes soule his humane vnderstanding and will, and place nothing but confusion in his whole humanity, or as your words are, all confusion in his whole humanity, both in all the powers of his soule and senses of his body, and tell me what

patience, obedience, or sanctity could be left, where neither vnderstanding, will, not memory were, but all confounded in the extreamest manner that might be.

               If it seeme a hard phrase, which in my former Treatise I vsed, saying. Christ at this instant became forgetfull of that which before he knew; my meaning is (and so still I speake now) he remembred not, he considered not. Which many times we vse to name forgetting, but indeed strictly and properly it is not remembring.] If you looke well to it, you haue harder phrases both in your defence and Treatise, then Christ to be forgetfull of himselfe. Which if you reuoke not, or plainly excuse not, rather by your folly not vnderstanding the force of them, then standing to iustifie them, they will prooue open impiety. I haue so often repeated them, that I am weary of so vnsauery words. And as fo

                proofes, that Christ should be thus all confounded in all the powers and senses of body and soule, you be so vsed to wilfull assertions depending only on your secret conceits, that you doe not thinke your selfe bound to prooue that you say, or to say no more in Christian Religion, then you can prooue. For what one signe or step of this great and generall confusion in the soule of Christ doe the Scriptures mention, that you should thus racke it to the extreamest & highest degree, that euer was, shall, or might be? They be well holpen vp, that haue such an heady presumer and affirmer, as you are, to fashion their faiths after your vnaduised and inconsiderate fansies: But God send you his grace to wax soberer, which is all the harme I wish you, though I like none of your pangs to be the principles of my faith.
            
               Defenc. pag. 129. li. 17. 
               Where you would wring out a contrariety in my words, as if I had said that Christ being in the depth of his astonishment, did then perfectly know that the dominion of death should not hold him: you doe me wrong, I say not so. In that place I argue from your supposition.] I haue no desire to charge you with impudency, but you wax sometimes so intolerable in your brags and shifts, that I must either betray the trueth, or tell you in plaine termes that you doe face a great deale more then you can any way fasten by iust proofe. Let this example stand in steed of many. If I heere doe you wrong, as you pretend, and you reasoned only from my supposition, let me beare the shame of it with all Christian Readers; but if it be plainely and expressely otherwise, then I pray you Sir who is the shifter and outfacer? Looke on the Page of your Treatise quoted by me, viz. Pa. 59, and see whether they be not your owne words (which I cited) in your answere to an obiection, and iustified by you out of the 10 of Marke verse 34. To an argument that Trea. pa. 59. li. 16. 
               Christ might pray, that his bodily death might not haue dominion ouer him, you answere, This is absurd to say that he praied in such feare and terror of mind against that which he perfectly knew should neuer come to him: namely that the dominion of death should hold him. Doe you confesse of yourselfe, that you speake absurdly, or doe you meane it of the obiectors, against whom you bring this as a reason; that since Christ Mar. 10. 34. 
               perfectly knew the dominion of death could not hold him, You thinke it very absurd to say he feared that? And in the page precedent doe you not againe and againe auouch the same exactnesse of knowledge in Christ at the time of his praiers? these are your owne words tripled and quadruplied to that end. Trea. pa 58. li. 30. 
               Thirdly, this prooueth that Christ knew it was Gods determinate will, in that he tearmeth it an houre, that is a time set of God for his suffering. Fourthly, because he so mightily feared it, therefore doubtlesse he knew that he was appointed to suffer it. Thus it is manifest in plaine words he praied contrary to Gods knowen will. And least you should not be constant in your manifest contradiction, doe you not insist on the same words in your defence? Defenc. pag. 99. li. 13. 
               He could not intentiuely pray against that, nor feare that, which he perfectly knew concerned him not at all. Where you giue to Christ in that extreame astonishment, which you dreame of, intentiue praier, and perfect knowledge of Gods will in some things, which againe in other things you deny vnto him. So that by your leaue you gainsay your selfe, and your denying it is as vnshame fast, as your doubling it.
            
               Defenc. pag. 129. li. 26. 
               To conclude this matter without colour of reason, you wrest a plaine text, which otherwise (as it lieth) maketh strongly against you. They are our Sauiour Christes owne words: Now is my soule troubled, and what shall I say? Father saue me from this houre: but therefore

came I vnto this houre. You say these words doe import a deliberation of two parts. But you speake against all reason, considering the nature and frame of the very words. A deliberation must needs be set interrogatiuely in both clauses. New the text is not so.] Of this place I haue spoken enough before, were it not that you challenge me with such hatefull termes of wresting a plaine text without colour of reason, because I therein follow the iudgement of Chrysostom and Epiphanius, who a man would thinke had not only colour of reason, but substance of learning to discerne the force of that speech. First the words, as well by the nature of the petition, and your owne confession, in that it is for a temporall thing; as by the supplie of the rest of the Euangelists must be conditionall, and haue a secret reseruation of Gods will, as in the like case the other Euangelists do expresse; and namely S. Marke, who sayth; Marke 14. 
               Christ prayed, if it were p

And so whether they be deliberatiue or positiue, they make nothing for your purpose, since not with resolution, but with condition, If it pleased God, Christ desired to be saued from that houre. But I wrest a plaine text, because I auouch, that the words import a deliberation of two parts, which you say must needs be set interrogatiuely in both clauses. Whence commeth this new Art of Oratory, that euery deliberation must be interrogatiue? As though a man might not doubt or deliberate either by int

                  eare the people. So the foure Lepers that sate at the entring in of the gate of Samaria, (when the dearth was there in El
                  •…
               zeus time) disputed with themselues; 2. Kings 7. 
               Why sit we heare till we die? if wee say, we will enter into the Cittie, the famine is in the Cittie, and we shall die there. And if we sit heere, we die also. Now therefore come, let vs fall into the campe of the Aramites: if they saue our liues, we shall liue; if they kill vs, we are but dead. As heere they reason with a condition, so might they haue said to the same effect by way of proposing and answering to themselues: what shall we doe to saue our liues? we will enter the city, there is the famine; we will sit still, heere is likewise death. Let vs goe to the Aramites: they will kill vs, then we are but dead; they will saue vs, then gaine we our liues. Is it not all one in this deliberation, whether we propose the parts by interrogation, condition, or proposition? In the words of our Sauiour likewise, Now is my soule troubled; and what shall I say? The answere to that patheticall question, What shall I say, might haue beene made either by interrogation; Shall I say, Father saue me from this houre? or by condition; If I say, Father saue me from this houre: or by simple supposition; I will, or I would say, Father saue me from this houre; but therefore came I vnto this houre. Which way soeuer we propose the former words, Father saue me from this houre; Christes answere by way of full resolution and conclusion, But therefore came I into this houre, doth conuince, that the former words, Father saue me from this houre, are by himselfe remoued, or denied as no part of his finall determination, though it were, or might be a part proposed in his deliberation. For either Christ must positiuely determine cleane contraries in one sentence, which were open inconstancie, and no way imaginable in the Sonne of God; or this latter must remoue the former being repugnant to the maine consent of his will, and intent of his comming. For therefore came he into this houre of mans redemption, because he would not be saued from it with mans destruction. And thus much the best and most skilfull Interpreters haue collected to be the force of the wordes following, to which Christ addeth the coniunction aduersatiue, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , which in their iudgement supposeth heere a negatiue precedent. So Chrysostom conceiueth our Sauiours words, I do not say, saue me from this houre; And why? Because the words following with an aduersatiue repugnance to the former words, doe proue not the first, but the last to be Christs full purpose.
            
               Defenc. pag. 129. li. 38. 
               Chrysostom & Epiphanius doe descant about it; trying how the text may beare such a meaning: but it can not stand being so euidently against the course of the text.] Indeed

Chrysostom and Epiphanius are not comparable to you, neither in learning nor iudgement; you make vs such new positions and principles both of reason and faith, that their Diuinitie is stale to yours: but with all learned and wise men, the yongest of the twaine will be trusted for the true sense of a text farre before such Dreamers and Deuisers as you are. The course of the text is euidently against it, you say. What course of the text? The words vsed by our Sauiour are with it: But therefore came I into this houre. What sense or meaning can this sentence haue, but that Christ purposely comming into this houre had no resolution to be deliuered from this houre? which being true, the former words, Father saue me from this houre, may shew the desire or doubt of nature inclining to that petition, but the present refusall thereof followeth expressing Christes will and purpose in putting himselfe into that houre. These words then, But therefore came I into thi
                     •…
                   houre, are in effect, not so, for therefore came I into this houre. Which the best Interpreters olde and new haue obserued in the force of Christes words. Chrysost. in Joha

                  nem. homil. 66. 
               Therefore came I into this houre, as if Christ had sayd (sayth Chrysostom) though we be moued and troubled, yet we flee not death. For I say not (thus as my resolution) Father deliuer me from this houre, but Father glorifie thy name. And Epiphanius: Epipha. li. 2. Heres. 69. 
               What shall I say? Father; speaking by way of preparation and dubitation. 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , This, sayth Christ, I will say, but therefore came I into this houre. For he came not against his will, but willingly. Theophylact: Theophylact. in 12. cap. Johannis. 
               For this cause, sayth Christ, came I into this houre, that I might suffer death for all. He teacheth vs very plainly by this, that though we be troubled and perplexed with it, yet we should not flie death for the truth. For I, sayth he, am troubled being a true man, and permit (mans) nature to shew it selfe, yet do I not say to my Father, that he should saue me from this houre, but what say I, Father glorifie thy name. The later Writers, of no meane iudgement, allow the same sense. Erasmus thus rendreth the summe of Christes words: Erasm. paraphra. in cap. 12. Johannis. 
               I finde my soule troubled for the day of my death now approching. And what shall I say? For the loue of mine owne life, shall I neglect the life of the world? By no meanes. I will applie my selfe to the will of my Father. Mans weaknesse troubled with feare of death, may say vnto him, Father, if it be possible, saue me from this instant danger of death. But Loue desirous of mans saluation, shall presently adde, Nay rarather, if it be expedient, let death, which I desired, come, for somuch as wittingly and willingly by the leading of the spirit I haue offered my selfe to die.

               This is as if Christ had sayd, Let no man thinke me as a cowardly captaine, to exhort others to patience and constance, being my selfe safe from danger. For death approcheth me, and that so cruell and bitter, that the very remembrance thereof troubleth my soule. What then shall I say, when amongst men there is no hope? To thee ô Father I turne, saue me from the houre of this terrible death. But what do I say? Euen therefore came I into this houre. What other thing then shall I aske, ô Father, but that thou shouldest glori
                     •…
                  ie thy name? Doe all these learned Interpreters wrest this text, and speake they against all reason without considering the nature and frame of the wordes, or doe they out of the very frame and force of the wordes deduce Christes resolution to be this, Father glorifie thy name, notwithstanding my former words, since I came of purpose into this houre, not to be freed from it? [The first words Defenc. pag. 129. li. 36. 
               pretend a plaine resolution, or at least a great inclining towards resolution.] If a plaine resolution, then Christ contradicteth himselfe with a plainer resolution in the end, which to affirme of the Sonne of God, aduise you, whether it be blasphemous or no. As for an inclination, since Christ made no idle deliberation, but spake out of his naturall humane affection abhorring death, that maketh wholly with my speech, affirming, that howsoeuer the sense of nature in Christ did incline to auoid death, in this debating with himselfe, yet he presently refused it by saying, But therefore came I into this houre, and fully resigned it, when he sayd, Father glorifie thy name: which resolution of his, God ratified with his owne voice from heauen, I haue glorified it and will glorifie it.

               Hence I reasoned effectually before, but no where you answere it. If Christs such suffeings in his soule were ordained of God for him, then certainly indeed he did suffer the same.]

Certainly indeed a man shall scant meet with such another, that disdaineth all mens reasons and interpretations besides his owne, and when he commeth to conclude any thing, can hardly discerne an Owle from an Eagle. Here is a profound argument made for your hell paines, that Christes soule was troubled with the foresight and remembrance of his death on the Crosse: ergo God ordained, that certainly and indeed he should suffer in his soule the paines of the damned. Children in their cradles, if they could prattle, would easily match the goodnesse of this reason; and other answer, as it needeth none, so it shall haue none for me, how effectuall soeuer this fansie seemeth vnto you.

               These affections, you say, were not likelie in him at all, much lesse to be the causes of such effects.] As though Christ had none other causes of sorow, but onely this.

Whereas I neither mention eternall damnation in all that section, nor so much as name Christ within fourtie lines of those wordes, which shew how largely enlabeia is taken. [You speake so darkly that I know not how to take you.] You double so continually that I cannot tell what to make of you: I haue in the same page, 305. whence you tooke these wordes, distinctly shewed what parts of Gods wrath, Christ might be said to feare or suffer, and in what sense, and yet you complaine of darknesse, when you shun the light, and watch for a word applied to another purpose, pretending you must needes stumble at that straw. And therefore neuer come in with any after close, what my meaning may be, if my wordes be not plaine, reprooue them; if they be, refute them, except you receiue them.

               My reason that Eulabeia heere signifieth feare properly, yea a perplexed feare, and not onely a religious deuotion, as you say, is grounded not so much on the nature of the word, as on the circumstances of the place, and the other wordes of the text.] Christ did as well naturally feare that, which he suffered, as that which he shunned; though he were heard in that onely, which he religiously shunned, and not in the rest, which he suffered. And therefore the other wordes of the text doe not inferre, that enlabeia contained all, that Christ feared; but onely that, which he religiously feared, and from which hee was freed. And where you [Defenc. pag. 131. li 23. 
               graunt the Apostle may intend this also by the nature of the word, that Christ notwitstanding all this dreadfull feare, yet declined not a iot from a most reuerend regard of obedience to God, which still he kept firme and safe:] You thinke with your mixtures to worke some maruailes. For that one and the same word in one and the same place should haue two repugnant or different significations, and the Apostle there intend them both, this is newes to all men saue to you, to whom no manner of absurdities are new. And where you would knit a dreadfull feare of euill from God, and a reuerend regard of obedience to God, both together in one word, you make Christ at one instant to decline that, which he did desire, and to desire that, which he did decline. For what he did feare, that he did decline, and what he so reuerently regarded, that he as much desired, which was obedience to God; and so by one and the same word you conceaue not onely contrary minds, but contrary matters in Christ. [li. 29. 
               To like effect this word signifieth in that place of the Acts 23. vers. 10. as the circumstances also will confirme.] We should soone haue heard of those circumstances, if any such had beene, but if you omit them as weake, I neede not entertaine them as worthy of answere. I see no such circumstances, as you speake of, much lesse any such signification of the word, as you haue framed vs out of the Apostle. Euery caution declining

any thing, feareth somewhat, which it would preuent, and so eulabeia, when it signifieth to be warie of any euill, hath a feare of that euill, lest it should happen, and therefore seeketh the best meanes to decline it.
            
               Defenc. pag. 131. li. 32. 
               Where you argue Christ was deliuered from his feare of hell torments; ergo he suffered them not, I denie your sequell. This prooueth directly the contrarie. He feared the death of the soule, ergo he did suffer it.] My sequell I thinke hath ground sufficient in nature and Scripture to make it good. When the Saints so often prayed to God to deliuer them from the dangers, which they feared, or found comming towards them, did they meane they would suffer them first to the full, and after bee losed from them; or else that they would bee freed from them, and not suffer them? I know there is a deliuerance out of the midst of troubles; and so you may defend that Christ was deliuered from hell fire, because he did not suffer it eternally: But since feare by the rules of nature is of future, and not of present euill, if Christ were heard from his feare; that is, deliuered from that which he feared, then certainly he did not suffer it. But th
                  •…
               nce you inferre directly the contrary, for li. 36. 
               that feare is of that, which is to come, as (you say) I well obserue.] Surely your sequels be like rotten rindes, they fall a sunder as soone, as they be touched. Did I auouch, that feare was of that onely, which necessarily must come, or of that, which possibly might come to our selues, or to others? Is there any man of common sense, that euer affirmed as you doe, that whatsoeuer a man feareth, must befall him? for that is your direct proofe, of which you speake, that all things feared must necessarily come to passe. Otherwise if men may feare that which is imminent, and yet be freed from it, how will it follow, that Christ really suffered, what he feared? Defenc. pag. 132. li. 2. 
               Such a manner and measure of feare, as this manifestly was, could not be but a very suffering.] Of what? of feare, or of the thing feared? feare is an affection or passion of the mind foreseeing euill, that is possible, and afflicting it selfe for the approching, or possibilitie thereof. But he that maketh no difference betwixt the feare of future euill, and the sense of present euill, confoundeth all things. Men may feare they know not what, yea they may feare, where no feare is, that is, without iust cause; but this is the weaknesse, or guiltinesse of mans mind persuing it selfe by fearing that, which they need not, or should not feare.
            
               Defenc. pag. 132. li. 5. 
               My soule is (saith Christ) full of (actuall) sorowes euen vnto death.] When you adde anything to the wordes of our Sauiour, you should take care to put nothing to them, but that which is sensible and true, since he was full of wisdome and trueth. Now this that you adde in helpe of your conceits, is neither. For sorrowes are passions, not actions of the mind; and therefore to say actuall sorrowes, hath no sense in it. If by actuall you meane present, then you exclude all future sorrowes against the plaine wordes of our Sauiour, who noteth his should continue vnto death. As for present torments inflicted on the soule of Christ by the immediate hand of God the word perilypos, doth no way reach to them, nor expresse any such thing. You may be therefore suffered to say, li. 6. 
               there is in this no doubtfull word; for that which you adde, is so absurd and senselesse, that no wise man will iudge it doubtfull. (li. 7. 
               your comparisons of fearing captiuitie, death, loosing a purse &c. are deuices vnsit for diuinitie.] I match them not with Christs sufferings good sir, but by them I shew how lewtering your Logick is, in saying a man suffereth, that he feareth; which is so farre from trueth, that euerie child may soone confute it, and well deride it. [Defenc. pag. 132. li. 12. 
               God you say, might well heare Christ two waies; Frst, by sufficient sustaining him in it; Secondly, by deliuering him out of it in due time.] Adde this interpretation then to the wordes of Christs prayers in the Garden, and what is become of your maine position, Christ prayed in plaine words contrarie to Gods knowen will? For since God did sustaine Christ in that he suffered, and in the end deliuered him with honour and glory, the cup by your constuction may bee said in both these respects to haue passed from him, and so in either sense God heard him, and deliuered him from it. But else where you are in greater earnest, that Christ could not intentiuely pray against that, nor feare that, which he most perfectly knew could by no meanes euer possibly come ne
                     •…
                  re him, namely that the dominion of death should hold him. If there

you were in sadnesse, then now you doe iest or worse, to tell vs that God might well heare Christ in that he neuer did or could pray for. That the death of the soule or body should haue dominion ouer him, was simply impossible, and Christ 
                  〈◊〉
                knew so much, as your owne words yeeld. Then neither did he, nor could he pray, by your positions, for any such thing, and consequently God did not heare him in those things for which he praied not. And so your two waies of hearing and deliuering Christ, your selfe, by your owne doctrine, ouerthrow, rather as iests, then iust deliuerances. And then doth my sequell persue you more strongly then before, that Christ must be freed from suffering that he feared, not by suffering it, since he neuer doubted and so neuer praied by your diuinity to be sustained in it, nor after suffering to be freed from it.
            
               Defenc. pag. 132. li. 15. 
               In another place you seeme to obserue a point both strange and very contrary to your selfe in saying feare is more intolerable in Christ then doubting; when you haue so often and so earnestly affirmed, that Christ feared, & for feare became astonished.] To him that neuer read leafe nor line of holy Scripture, this may make some iolly shew; but to him that can distinguish white from blacke, it will appeare to be rather an ignorant conceit in you, then a repugnant speach in me. A naturall feare of euill is incident to all mens natures by Gods ordinance in his first creating vs, and so common to Christs manhood with all men, be they good or bad. For therefore did God threaten death to Adam if he disobeyed, that both the loue of God enioied, and feare of euill (if he transgressed,) might restraine him from sinne. A religious feare of Gods greatnesse, and (in cause of committing or suffering for sinne) the trembling at the power of his wrath, is proper to the godly, wherein Christ might and did communicate with them, as being to beare the punishment of our sinne, though he were free from all sinne. A distrustfull feare, which quencheth faith and excludeth hope, is common to all the wicked, and therein Christ might not concurre with them, least he conioined with them in si

He must be more then blind, which doth not see what kind of feare I exclude from Christ: but you did cunningly to peruert my words, when you could not resist my reasons. For all your apprehensions of Gods proper wrath and fierie indignation, which you so much proclaime, if you direct them to the person of Christ, as if he conceaued, feared, or doubted any change or decrease of Gods fauour and loue towards him, or his sacrifice, then are they these verie feares, which heere I banish from Christ as vtterly blasphemous. It was therefore some skill to shift of these words with a slanderous and false crimination least they should make you breath, before you were disburdened of them, if you toke them rightly.
            
               Defenc. pag. 132. li. 19. 
               You seeke a weake aduantage in that I said eisaekonstheis may seeme to shew, that Christ was heard being in that, which he was saued from. You see I chalenge no certaine but a seeming reason from that word.] In the maine ground of our saluation and redemption, which are most certaine in the Scriptures, to impugne the doctrine there deliuered with seeming reasons, is the guise of him that would seeme a good Christian, but is none. Indeed you haue beset your selfe in your defence with store of seemings; as I

could specifie the places and points, if it were to this purpose; and I thinke your whole defence hath nothing in it but your seemings, you vse therein so few either authorities or reasons, other then your owne conceits and assertions. But vpon these seemings you set pestilent positions, slanderous imputations, and false conclusions, as euen here you both resolue, that Christ was in your hell paines; and you presume so to translate the word eisakonstheis, he was heard being in it, as if that were the true force of the Apostles words. [But your selfe maketh a stranger conclusion; ergo the actiue

               referred to God; importeth that God being in the same pains did heare him.] Yet such a conclusion, as your collection cannot auoid. For where Christ was heard, God did heare; the passiue in Christ noteth the actiue to be truely affirmed of God, that he did heare Christ. If then that word, as you boldly with your seeming reason and false translation affirme, import being in the paines of hell, it must so signifie as well in the actiue referred to God, as in the passiue applied to Christ. If you be now ashamed to heare of these vnseeming and vnsauery reasons; blot them out of your owne booke, and bestow your time better hereafter.

               Lastly, you say, but in the garden Christ neuer praied with strong cries and teares to be saued from death, that we read in the Scriptures. I hope you do
                     •…
                   not read in the Scriptures expressely at all, that thus he praied in the garden: You may soundly gather it from the Scriptures I grant. My words are not, that the Scriptures expressely name Christs teares in the garden; but that none other place nor time of Christs praier mentioned in the Euangelists, doe admit teares but the garden. For there the place being priuate, and his praiers so vehement, that his sweat was like bloud, both olde and new writers haue collected, that the Apostles words were verified in the garden, yea the sweat of Christ Bernard calleth teares, where he saith: Bernardus in Ramis Palmarum Serm. 3. 
               Christ falling into an agony, prayed the third time where he seemed to weepe, not only with his eyes, but with all the parts of his bodie, that the whole bodie of his Church might be purged with the teares of his whole body. Zinglius confesseth as much. Zinglius in Historiam Passio. 
               Non lachrymas modo oculis sed & sanguinis guttas è corpore exprimit seria & deuota oratio, vt in trepidatione Christi est cernere. Serious & deuote praier doth not onely draw teares from the eyes, but a bloudie sweate from the bodie, as we see in Christes Agonie. And surely the writer of the Epistle to the Hebrewes must either not collect this from the Scripture, but report it besides the Scripture, which is somewhat dangerous; os else by the sweate of Christes face, trickling downe to the ground, he collected, that in that in: entiue and vehement prayer, teares ran downe as fast as sweate, and ioyntly with sweate: and other sound gathering it from the Scriptures there is none. And this collection if you graunt, that the Apostle from the vehemencie of Christs prayer obserued the cause of the one to be the cause of the other, since it was not possible the face should runne with sweate through the feruencie of prayer, and not the eyes with teares; then graunt you, that it may soundly be gathered from the Scriptures, that zeale of prayer, and not heate of paine was the cause of Christs bloudy sweate.
            
               Defenc. pag. 132. li. 34. 
               The Apostle in all reason may be vnderstoode to haue respect to all the woefull times and cries of our Sauiour, as on the crosse, and in the 12. of Iohn.] There is no reason to extend the Apostles wordes to Christs praier in the 12. of Iohn: for there the Scripture doth not mention either strong cries or teares, which are the Apostles words. On the crosse he vsed a loud voice, but teares he shed none, neither was the sense of his prayer there to be freed from death, but rather to hasten his death, to which he had now wholy submitted himself according to his Fathers will. And therefore your stretching the Apostles wordes to all those times, to make Christs agonie, if you could tell how, to continue on the crosse, wanteth all reason. His paine most increased on the crosse, and his sorow rising thence could not decrease; but neither his astonishment, nor that which the Scripture calleth his agonie, accompanied with his bloodie sweate, continued on the crosse. You thinke it vnreasonable to say, that Christ on the crosse had persistance in ioy, and beheld God alwayes fauourable and faithfull vnto him, Defenc. pag. 132. li. 38.

               for the ioy set before him, endured the crosse and despised the shame (thereof.) If then there be ioy in hope, how could Christ want ioy, if he wanted not hope? and hope if you take from him, you leaue him in despaire, which is the losse of hope; which whether you will adde to the rest of your vnsound faith, I leaue it to your choice. Notwithstanding your selfe in this very booke allow to Christ on the crosse, and in his agonie by reason of the very same wordes, (which I cite page 116.) not onely Defenc. pag. 110. li. 28. & 34.

               Defenc. pag. 133. li. 16. 
               I confesse his extreame astonishment did euer quickly passe from him, yet the sense aud tast of that cup might continue longer, in such a manner and measure as he was better able by his deitie to sustaine it. Now what ill is there in these conceits, I pray you, what follie is there

in them?] As much as may be. For when you haue sought heauen and earth, sea and land to bring Christs soule within the compasse of your hell-paines, and therewith to astonish and confound all the powers of his soule, and senses of his bodie; suddainely with the speaking of, (yet) you free him from it, and still returne and remooue it, as often as you list. And when you are vrged, that hell paines continuing and increasiing on the crosse by your doctrine, there was no manner of astonishment or confusion in Christs reason or remembrance; you say the tast of the cup might continue. So that when the paines were lesse, then Christ did drinke the cup, and when they were greatest, then he did but tast the cup. Thus play you the Tapster with Christs torments, and set vp the rest of your cause on this absurd conceit of Drinking and tasting the cup; which is not only dissonant from all trueth, but repugnant to all sense. For if your hell paines were the true cause of Christs astonishment, then the cause continuing, the effect could not cease; and the cause increasing, the effect could not diminish. Where you fly for help to Christs deity, the better to enable him to sustaine the paines of the damned without astonishment, you forget that if Christ would haue vsed any diuine power to resist or represse his paine, he might easily haue suffered none. And weake you make Christs godhead, if vsing it to that end, he could not saue himselfe from confusion and forgetfullnesse; as also you put a conflict betwixt the Father and the Sonne, if he could not enable his manhood against astonishment, as well at one time as at another. Therefore this abusing Gods immediate hand to take memory from Christ, when you list, and thus pretending Christs deity to keep him in the paines of hell, and yet to free him from forgetfulnesse, shew right on what foundation you b

Neither of which can generally and iustly be verified of your hellish confusion and torments.

                  hemently against my last argument that Christ suffered not in some sort the death of the soule; first if we should speake strictly after the manner of death in the bodie, then no man is so mad or foolish as to say that any mans soule can die at all, that is, want life and sense as a dead bodie doth.] You be come now to the vpshot of all your defence and doctrin, whether the Scriptures do any where teach, that Christ died the death of the soule, or the second death for our redmption: and here shall we find nothing but an heape of words broched out of your braines, and so tempered with your conceits, that when you haue all said, you say nothing with any substance or shew of holy Scripture. You disclaime, that the soule is at any time deuoide of life and sense, as dead bodies are, as if that were ought to your purpose; but yet the death of the soule hath a resemblance and concordance with the death of the bodie, as spirituall things may haue with corporall. And therefore as the bodie being once dead wanteth all sense and motion, which are the parts or effects of life from the soule quickning the bodie, so the soule being dead to God, who is her life, hath no sense nor motion of Gods grace in this life, nor sight nor hope of glory in the life to come, but destitute of the one here

            on earth, which is grace, hath no desire nor feeling of God, and in the next world depriued of all possibilitie of glory, is subiected to eternall and intolerable miserie from the presence of God.
            
               Defenc. pag. 135. li. 24. 
               Such a death as immortall soules are subiect vnto is Gods separation from them, & this is two fold; the first death, and the second death, as the Scripture speaketh. The first is the separation of them from Gods grace, which is in this life by sinne raigning in them]. The soule loaden with sinne in this life, is not vtterly dead, so long as it retaineth any sense or motion of Gods grace. So that sorow for sinne ioyned with any desire of true repentance is a plaine signe of life in the soule, though sorrow for sinne without hope be plaine despaire and death of the soule. And therefore the soule of man finding the danger of sinne, and desiring to be deliuered from it, yet liueth whiles she apprehendeth, affecteth, or seeketh the grace of God; but if she want all sense of God by faith, and motion to God by hope and desire, she is wholy dead to God, that is void of the life of God, which is deriued from God vnto the soules of men. As for the second death of the soule, the Scriptures indeed speake thereof, but you erre groslely in this second death, the execution whereof alwayes followeth the first death as well of the bodie as of the soule, though the guiltinesse and condemnation thereof by a mans owne conscience may be found heere in this life. And therefore the second death by the open and euident wordes of the holy Ghost is called the
               Reuel. 20. 
               lake of fire, or the19. & 21. 
               lake burning with fire and brimstone, which is not in this life. And consequently your next collection, that the second death is Gods leauing them in the feeling of the most sharpe and most vehement paines inflicted by Gods iustice for sinne, is as false, as it is defectiue, not agreeing in one word with the tenor of the sacred Scriptures, which you pretend to follow.

                  5. li. 30. 
               This last kind of death is so called and named in many places of Scripture.] The second death is expresly named, but in foure places of the Scripture. The first,Reuel. 2. v. 11 
               Be thou faithfull to death, and I will giue thee the crowne of life. He that ouercommeth (the first death) shall not be hurt of the second death. The second,Reuel. 20. v. 6 
               blessed and holy is he, that hath part in first resurrection (of the soule vnto the life of grace) on such THE SECOND DEATH hath no power. The third,Ibid. v. 14. 
               Death and hell were cast into the lake of fire, THIS IS THE SECOND DEATH. The fourth,Reuel. 21. v. 8 
               The fearefull & vnbeleeuing, the abominable and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liers shall haue their part in the lake, that burneth with fire and brimstone, WHICH IS THE SECOND DEATH. Saue in these places the second death is neuer expresly named in the Scriptures; and in these most apparantly the second death followeth after the death of the bodie, and is euerlasting. And neither on Christ, who is the first resurrection vnto grace, and the second resurrection vnto glorie; nor on any of his members hath the second death any power by the plaine words of Saint Iohn. So that all your platforme is quite ouerthrowen by the direct words of the Apostle, freeing Christ and all his elect euen in this life from all power of the second death. And therefore you set your selfe in this section euidently to confront the holy Ghost, when you seeke to proue that Christ suffered the second death of the soule, as the Scripture speaketh. And besides the Scriptures, if you talke of second deaths, you may as well tell vs tales of a new world, as of an other word without the witnesse of Gods spirit. But you haue found out many places of Scripture, where this last kinde of death is so called and named.] Eight you quote by the side in your margine, but take not the paines to discusse one of them, onely you pronounce after your stately manner, that those places of Scripture prooue that, which you meane to bee the death of the soule. Now what if not one of them speake any such thing? is not your Reader sure to find you a true man of your word, when you quote eight places, and not one of them to your purpose? but this is your perpetuall course, to mistake and misuse Scriptures at your pleasure, and then to say you haue soundly prooued it. On the contrary I affirme that none of these places intend any such thing, as you imagine of your terrestiall and temporall hell, but they exactly conclude against you, that damnation is eternall, and no death of the soule, which is not euerlasting, is expressed or intended in any of those Scriptures; or in any

other, that you or your friends are able to picke out. And though it may suffice me as well to say nay, as you to say yea, yet for the Readers better resolution I will not bee grieued to run through all these places, as much as shalbe needfull.
            The first is,Ezech. 18. ver. 4. 
               the soule that 
                     •…
                  inneth, it shall die. These words may signifie either subtraction of grace in this life, which is consequent to sinne in the wicked, or exclusionEight places of Scripture abused for the temporall death of Christs soul
                     •…
                  . from glory in the next world, which is the iust and full wages of sinne. But that euery soule, which sinneth, hath felt, or shall feele in this life your temporall hell or the pains of the damned, this is a grosse error to be fathered on those words, and repugnant not onely to the trueth of this text, but euen to the sense and experience of all the Godly, and such as your selfe dare not auouch, since you qualifie your conceit in that behalfe with these words, thatDefenc. pag. 134. li. 15. 
               some in some measure are conformed with Christ in these his sufferings. But if God by Ezechiel ment your earthly hell, then absolutely all men, children not excepted, must feele in this life paines equall with the damned, for so much as they haue sinned, and deserued euerlasting damnation.
            The second is the commination, that God made to Adam,Genes. 2. ver. 17. 
               Whensoeuer thou 
                     •…
                  atest thereof, thou shalt die the death, (or) surely thou shalt die. Here are all sorts of deaths threatned, but not to be executed either on all men, nor in this present life; God reseruing to himselfe power and libertie to dispose of all mens soules according to his determinate counsell, though they should all be guiltie and liable to all kinds of death by vertue of those words vpon the transgression of the first man. This exposition the Apostle giueth when he saith,Rom. 5. 
               The offence of one (came) on all men to condemnation, which is the verifying of these words, that all men died in Adam, to wit, were subiect to death, not onely by dying the death of the bodie, which is appointed for all men, but to the guiltinesse of euerlasting death not executed on all, though deserued by all.
            The third, which is theRom. 6. Apostles conclusion, is either generally ment of all kinds of death, which came in by sinne, as the rewards and punishments thereof, and then it is nothing to your intention; or else it expresseth the full wages of sinne to be euerlasting death by opposition to eternall life mentioned in the next wordes following. For eternall life is the gift of God, as (eternall) death is the wages, (that is bothe the desert and repayment) of sinne. Take which you will, either the generall or speciall construction of death, it is no way pertinent to your purpose.
            Lesse is the fourth, that the Apostles were the2. Cor. 2. vers. 16. 
               sauour of death vnto death in them, that perished, as they were the sauour of life vnto life in them, that were saued. For the preaching of the Gospell, which the Apostle meaneth in that place, doeth not proclaime a terrestiall or temporall heauen to them that beleeue in Christ, but life eternall; and consequently neither doth it denounce a temporall death to them, which refuse Christ, but euerlasting death. And therefore there can be nothing more absurd then to conuert these places to the proofe of your temporall hell; for so you should doe the reprobate a very good turne, if you could shew, that the death threatned them for not beleeuing in Christ, were to dure but for a time, or in this life only, where your new found hell hath power and place, and no where else.
            With like successe you note for your fifth, that the2 Cor. 3. vers. 7. 
               ministration of death was glorious, the Apostle so calling the law, because it denounced death not temporall, but eternall to all transgessours. So that if the full wages of sinne be eternall death by the word of God, then did the law not denounce a temporall death due to all men by course of nature, be they good or bad, (though euen that at first entered as a part of the punishment of sinne) but euerlasting death, which is the second death, is reserued, as S. Iohn writeth, for all sorts of sinners and liers.
            Saint Iames is the sixth, who sayth,Iames 5. 
               He that conuerteth a sinner (erring from the trueth) shall saue a soule from death. If a man conuerted shall be saued from your temporall hell, which you here would intend by the death of the soule, then much more the Conuerter and he that neuer erred from the trueth shall be free from your hell; and consequently Christ was most free, who was trueth it selfe, and neuer erred. But as trueth is the way to euerlasting life, and freeth men from all bondage of sinne and

Satan, so errour and infidelitie haue another maner of death than your terrestiall hell, which you make common to Christ and some of his members; and he that is conuerted from errour or sinne shall be saued from euerlasting perdition, which indeed is the death of the soule depriuing it of all blisse and ioy for euer.
            The seuenth and eigth you take out of Saint Iohn, who sayth,1. Ioh. 5. vers. 16, 17. 
               There is sinne vnto death, for which we must not pray: But whosoeuer is borne of God, sinneth not that sinne; and so neither Christ, who was the true Sonne of God, nor any of his chosen, who are the children of God by adoption, can sinne that sinne, nor die that death, because he that is begotten of God, liueth by God, who is eternall life to all that know him, and cleaue vnto him without separation. If then the sinnes of the Elect be not vnto death, but such as we in pietie may, and in charitie must pray for; consequently the death of the soule here meant by Saint Iohn, is such as is not incident to any of the sonnes of God, and so not the temporall hell, which you communicate to Christ and his members.
            Heere are your eight places of Scriptures proouing (as you pretend) the second death of the soule, which you ascribe to Christ, in euery one of which, saue the first and second, there can be no question, but euerlasting damnation is intended, and in those two the guiltinesse of eternall death, which is due to sinne, may be comprised in the name of death; which the Apostle iustifieth, when he sayth,Rom. 5. v. 12. 
               The offence of one (came) on all men vnto condemnation, which is in effect that he sayd before, Death went ouer all men, forasmuch as all men haue sinned. But that any of these intend your temporall hell brought into this life not by snares and feares working on the soules of men, but by substance and essence; and not eternall death in hell fire with the Diuell and his Angels, you nor all your adherents shall euer be able by any ground of holy Scripture to make it appeare. And therefore your presuming it vpon the bare shew of places concluding no such thing, is a pestilent intrusion vpon the word of God, whiles you sticke not to couple your conceits, which are false and erroneous, with his vndoubted and vndefiled trueth.

               First ordinarily and commonly it belongeth only to the damned, wherewithall are the ordinarie accidents and concomitants desperation, induration, vtter darknesse &c. with perpetuitie of punishment, and that locally in HELL.] Generally and truely the Scriptures neuer vse the name of the second death, but for the lake burning with euerlasting fire, into which the Diuell and all the Reprobate shall be cast, and whatsoeuer you otherwise pretend, is your owne absurd deuice without the Scriptures, and against the Scriptures, to keepe your doctrine from open derision and detestation. And since your selfe acknowledge, that this is the ordinarie and vsuall doctrine of the Scriptures, it shalbe needfull for your Reader to hold you to that, till you fully proue your extraordinarie deuice by the same Scriptures, by which the other is euidenly confirmed, and so much openly confessed by you.

               In this sense the Fathers generally do take it, where they denie that Christ suffered the death of the soule: and so do we.] If your cause haue so little holde in the Scriptures, it hath lesse in the Fathers, who in the necessarie worke of our redemption thought it sacriledge to say any thing that was not apparently proued by the Scriptures. And as you light not on a true word, when you come to deliuer vs the mysteries of your new hell, so this is patently false, that the Fathers generally take the death of the soule for eternall damnation only, when they denie that Christ died the death of the soule. They speake as the Scriptures leade them, and confessing two deaths of the soule as the Scriptures doe, which are sinne excluding all grace, and the wages of sinne euen euerlasting damnation; they generally denie that Christ died any death of the soule, and haue for confirmation of their doctrine therein, the whole course of the sacred Scriptures concurring with them.
            
               Defenc. pag. 135. li. 37. 
               Secondly, the death of the soule, or the second death, may be extraordinarily and singularly considered, namely to imply no more but simply the very nature and essence of it.] You broach two apparent and euident vntrueths, which you make the whole foundation

of your presumptuous errour. First, that either Christ or his Elect in this life did or do suffer the very nature and essence of the second death. Next, that the Scriptures do singularly and extraordinarily reserue that kinde of second death for Christ and his members. Shew either of these by the word of God, before you make them grounds of your doctrine, or els any meane Reader may soone conceiue you meane to teach no trueth confirmed in the Scriptures, but a bolde and false deuice of your owne, which you would extraordinarily intrude vpon the word of God.

                  th proued it already. till you came to the place, where we should receiue a reasonable satisfaction; and now you are come to the place, where you should make iust and full proofe thereof, you send vs backe againe, and say you haue shewed it before. What meaneth this doubling and deceiuing of your Reader, but that you would seeme to haue many proofs, when indeed you haue none? and therefore you post vs to and fro, to seeke for that we shall neuer finde. In the 113. Page of this Defence, you went about by your miserable misconstruing of certaine wordes vsed by some of the Fathers to enforce a shew of a death on the soule of Christ; but against the haire, as there I haue proued: and therefore stand not on your former vnfortunate aduentures, but either heere make proofe by the Scriptures, that Christ died the death of the soule, or leaue prating and publishing it so confidently as you and your adherents do for the chiefe part of mans redemption. [The Scriptures and Fathers, you say, before noted, may rightly be vnderstood not to denie it in Christ.] Is this all you haue to say for the death of Christes soule, that the Scriptures and Fathers may be vnderstood not to denie it? The Scriptures must affirme it, before you can make it any point of Christian religion, or part of our reconciliation to God.Rom. 10. 
               Faith (is) by hearing, and hearing by the word of God; and not by not denying. If that be your course, to put any thing to the Creed which you list to say the Scriptures doe not denie, you may quickly haue a large Creed, containing all things which the Scriptures, abused with your figures and wrested to your fansies, shall not in expresse words, as you thinke, denie.

               Moreouer, let it be obserued: that if we had no proofes at all in Scripture for this point, yet our question is fully proued and confirmed by those other sufficient and pregnant proofs alleaged and iustified before.] Your palpable and pregnant follies are sufficiently seene before: your proofs were none but bald and false presumptions, conceiued by your selfe, though otherwise voide of all reason and authoritie: with such props you haue hitherto supported your Defence, and now you be come to the maine issue, whether the Scriptures or Fathers doe teach, that Christ for our redemption died the death of the soule, or the death of the damned, which is the second death, you would passe it ouer as a matter of no moment, and here tell vs if you had no such proofe (as indeed you haue none) yet you haue played your part before, which was to set a good face on an euill cause, and to proue iust nothing.

               For it is to be noted, that no man setteth the question in these tearmes that Christ died in his soule, neither doe we at all vse them very much in speaking of this matter.] The Scriptures themselues set that for the question. First of all, I
               1. Cor. 15. 
               deliuered vnto you (sayeth Paul) that which I receiued, how that Christ died for our sinnes according to the Scriptures. Since thenRom. 5. 
               we were reconciled to God by the death of his Sonne; and Christ is the
               Hebr: 9. 
               Mediatour of the New Testament, through death for the redemption of the transgressions in the former Testament; and where a Testament is, there must be the death of him that made the Testament. The question riseth of it selfe what death the Sonne of God died for our sinnes, by the witnesse of holy Scripture. And hitherto for these fifteene hundred yeeres and vpward the Christian world, both of learned and vnlearned, hath beleeued that the Sonne of God by the death of his bodie on the tree ransomed our sinnes, reconciled vs to God, and vtterly destroyed the kingdome of Satan; and that he neither did nor could suffer any other kinde of death, as the death of the soule, or the

            So that the reference of the Apostles words standeth thus; he offered vp praiers and supplications with strong cries and teares to him that was able to saue him from (all touch of death) and was heard (in that he prayed for,) and though he were the sonne, and god was able to keepe him vntouched of death, that is, to make him the Sauiour of the world without tasting any kind of death, yet such was Gods counsell and his owne liking, that he learned (or perfourmed) the obedience of a sonne by the things which he suffered. Whereby the Apostle teacheth vs, it was neither want of power in God, that Christ died, for God was able to haue saued the world by him without his death, neither was it lacke of fauour towards his sonne, for God HEARD him in that he asked; but to manifest in his person the perfect submission of a sonne to his father, God would haue him obedient to death, euen vnto the death of the crosse; and so make him the author of eternall saluation to all that obey him, As he obeied God his Father. Those words then, Christ offered praiers to him that was able to keep him from death, prooue not death to be the cause of Christs feare, nor the scaping therefrom to be the scope of Christes strong cries and teares; but the Apostle thereby noteth that Christ neither doubted of his Fathers power nor loue, when he praied so earnestly vnto him, but was assured of both, and enioyed both in such sort as might best stand with the honor and wisedome of God the father, and of Christ his sonne. And therefore all your collections and illations built on that false ground do

               Why then did he pray, that the cup might passe from him?] I answere, he had no need to pray for himselfe, but only for vs, who then suffered with him, and in him. What learning I cannot say, but what lewdnesse is this, to father that on me, which I fully forsake; and still to presse me with that, which I so often preuent and repell? I did not intend in my Sermons to note any by name, nor sharply to censure their sayings; but repeating as much as I saw, I gaue the best construction or mittigation to their words, that any trueth would endure.

yeelding to Christ a religious feare to decline the force of hell, and a carefull praier against the power of hell by the example of Dauid; who describing the passion of Christ in the 22 Psalme, saith expressely of his person and in his person, Psal. 22. 
               They pearced mine hands, and my feete, they part my garments among them, and cast lots on my vesture. But be not thou farre of, O Lord my strength, hast thee to help me. Deliuer my soule from the sword; my deso

               Defenc. pag. 137. li. 10. 
               Christ could not possibly feare in such wofull maner that, which he perfectly knew should neuer come nere him: but he perfectly knew that eternall death and the cup of Gods euerlasting malediction should neuer touch him. Therefore he could not by any meanes pray in such sort against it.] You refute your selfe, and not any thing which I affirmed. That Christ praied against the power and rage of hell and Satan, is plaine by Dauids words, that he praied in such wofull maner, are not my words, but yours. And yet this proposition, that Christ praied for nothing, which he perfectly knew was Gods almighty and vnchangeable decree, is not true. For Christ was most assured and most certainly knew of all thinges, whatsoeuer were decreed and appointed by God for himselfe; and yet he praied for many things, not as doubting of them, but as confessing whence he must, and did receaue them. He perfectly knew he should be glorified with the glory which he had with his Father before the world was; and yet Iohn 17. 
               he praied for it. In the former words of Dauid Christ perfectly knew, that God would saue and deliuer his soule from the Lions mouth, from the power of the Dogge, and from the hornes of the Vnicorne, and yet he earnestly praieth for it. Christes praiers then doe not proue that he feared the contrary to his petition, but that he was assured to obtaine, and by praier professed whence it came whatsoeuer he had, euen from his Father. The next assertion, which you make, is a direct contradiction to your selfe, and not to me. For if Christ in those vehement praiers had such exact and perfect knowledge of Gods counsell and loue, as heere you auouche, then was Christ in no such confusion and forgetfulnesse, as you put him in at the time of his agony to saue him from sinne. And where not foure leaues before, you made a shamefull shift to rescue your selfe from a plaine contradiction, and bobbed your Reader with a manifest fitten, that I did you wrong, Defenc. pag. 129. 
               You did argue from my supposition, that Christ was not astonished at the time of his praiers in the garden, but in his perfect memory (which I seemed to affirme, and you denied) a man may heere perceiue, that you want witte to see what hangeth together in your owne tale, or that your memory is very short to relapse so soone to the cleere crossing of your selfe againe. For heere you positiuely, frequently, and earnestly affirme that in his praiers Christ

               what was ordeined by God for him, and 12. 
               that the cup of Gods eternall malediction should neuer touch him.] So brickle are your braines, that you egerly and openly say and vnsay in the space of foure leaues; and reuerse your owne positions, wherein the Reader if he be wise, will see you more13. constant, before he credit you.

                  ies of that which is to come? Where if you meane certainly and infalliblely to come, (as you must, otherwise it prooueth nothing) the proposition is generally true neither in the wicked, nor in the godlie, and least of all in Christ himselfe. The wicked doe feare manie things, that fall not on them, yea they often feare, as Dauid saith, Psal. 53. 
               where no feare is. The godly by fearing before hand, what may come; do often preuent the comming of it. Mary was Luc. 1. afraid at the sight of the Angell, that saluted her, and yet brought he a greate blessing to her. Peter walking on the water, was Mat. 14. 
               afraid, when he saw a mighty wind, and began to sincke, but Christ presently reached forth his hand, and rebuked him for doubting. The Disciples were Luc. 24. 
               abashed and afraid at the suddaine presence of there master in the middest of them, and yet no euill was towards them. So that feare may grow as well from appearance, and opinion, when no hurt is imminent, as from the certainty of euil present, or comming. Christ taught all his Disciples to feare him, euen God; Luc. 12. 
               who after he hath killed, hath power to cast into hell. Shall we thence inferre by your diuinitie, that God will cast all the faithfull into hell, because he hath power so to doe, which they must feare? Philip. 2▪. 
               Finish your saluation with feare and trembling, saith the Apostle. Shall we therefore neuer be saued, because we must alwayes tremble and feare vnder the mightie hand of God? Vnder the same hand of God migh Christ feare and tremble, not doubting of his saluation, nor distrusting his Fathers loue, but knowing that the hand of God was Almightie, and able to impose farre greater paine on his bodie then his humane flesh was able to beare. It is therefore due to Gods power from all the faithfull, and was likewise from Christes manhoode, for men to be afrayd of the strength of Gods hand, when he ariseth to punish sinne, though when and how he will doe it, we may not, or cannot determine. And if we should graunt, that Christs flesh euen thus feared the power of Gods hand, that was able to keepe him from death, and to inflict what paine pleased him, you are no whit the nearer to your new found hell, or to your second death of Christs soule, which you labour to deriue from these words of the Apostle to the Hebrewes.
            But to let the reader see, how rashly & rudely you conclude, what you list, out of the Apostles words without any sure ground. The word, which all this while you haue taken to import a coufused and perplexed feare in Christ, hath no such signification in the Greeke tongue; and in this place of the Apostle, by the iudgement of the ancient and best learned interpreters of all ages, that are not infected with this new fansie, is taken for reuerence, or a religious feare of God. Of which signification there can be no question with any man, that is meanely learned. And albeit some fauouring your fansie, haue sough farre and neere for examples, where 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                might signifie a painefull and amazing feare, yet find they none, neither in prophane nor sacred writers, but only a carefull feare to decline euill, or a religious feare honoring God, to be the true force of that word. How prophane men vse the word, (with that I haue elsewhere sayd) this may suffice.

Infinite are the examples, that might be brought out of sacred and prophane writers for farder proofe hereof, but these are enough to shew, that Chrysostom, Photius, Oecumenius, Theophylactus, and other Graecians commenting on those words of the Apostle, did not forget the propriety of their owne tongue, when they expounded this text as declaring, that Christ was heard for the reuerend respect of God to his sonne, or for the religious submission of the sonne to his Father: and the Latin Fathers Ierom, Ambrose, Primasius, Sedulius, Bede, Haymo and others following the same translation did not erre of ignorance, but duely considered the nature and force of the Apostles words. Where then you haue made vs a stout conclusion, that Christ thus fearing could feare nothing but the death of the soule, or the second death, you cannot iustly prooue by any words heere vsed, that Christ had any feare, much lesse such a feare as you imagine; though I may safely grant a feare, and such a feare, as the Scriptures describe or expresse of Christ, and you nothing the neerer to your presumptuous conceit.

Blessed Paul heere saith, (as Ambrose writeth) that Christ offered praiers and supplications, not for any feare of (his owne) death, but for the cause of our saluation. Wherevpon in another place (Paul) saith, the bloud of Christ cried better things for vs, then the bloud of Abel. And againe, Ibidem.

               When in the garden Christ praied against that cup, which he feared; that it might passe from him, there he yeeldeth and submitteth himselfe presently to the vndergoing of it. But it were, I know not what, to saie, that Christ did euer yeeld and submit himselfe to vndergoe eternall death, or to tast the cup of gods eternall malediction. Therefore it was not this, that he feared and heere praid against.] You are somwhat idle headed to make such a stur for that, which I am farder from, then you are. At the sharpenesse of Christs bodily death, which he would not frustrate nor mitigate, and in the paines whereof he was to yeeld

more perfect obedience and patience, then all mankind besides was able to doe, the weaknesse of his humane flesh might naturally somewhat stagger: and the power of Gods hand against sinne, which might be laied on his

And yet if we admit these cries and teares to be powred forth, not for himselfe, but for vs, then might he most wofully bewaile our deserued destruction, which was no lesse then euerlasting damnation of body and soule; if he did not ransome and release vs from it. To his fathers will Christ submitted himselfe in the garden, but what he disliked in that cup which he named, and how much thereof he tasted, is knowen neither to you, nor to me, nor to any man liuing. That it was very sharp, we may iustly collect by his naturall dislike thereof, but what degrees or sorts of paines were adherent to his passion, is not for you or me to determine. What he might suffer with piety, patience, and obedience to his father, is aboue mans reach to define, but the second death or the death of the soule, if we follow the leading of the Scriptures, and not fall to deuising a new hell, and a new death of the soule to support our fansies, are things, that by no colour of Scripture can be confirmed, howsoeuer you straine and stretch the word of God to find them there.

But what a iest is this, when you should iustly prooue, and fully conclude your assertions, to fall to granting of them, whereas your graunt with me, and with any man that is wise, is not worth a grey goose quill. Howbeit these are the best buttresses of your cause, euen your owne violent conceits, that force the Scriptures to your liking. But Sir, remember you are neither Prophet, nor Apostle, and so your granting of these nouelties, may shew your owne gyddinesse, it cannot preiudice the true and vndoubted rules of the Christian faith.

                  incibly that Christ indeed suffered, (sith thus he feared) more then the meere bodily death, euen the death of the soule. For he could not I say thus feare, but he must needes know that it was to come, or might come vnto him. If he but knew that it might come vnto him, then it certainly did come vnto him at one time or another in his passion before he left the world.] Here is the prime and pride of your obseruations out of this place of the Apostle to the Hebrewes; and except a man were out of his witts, he would not reuell in this sort with such waterish and witlesse resumptions. Palpable vntrueths you call inuincible certainties, and trifles wherewith children will not be deceiued, you obtrude to the whole Church of Christ, as fortresses of their faith. Christ feared, ergo he suffered; more then a bodily death, ergo the death of the soule. What he knew might come, that certainly did come. These be such bables, that boyes in the street will deride them, and yet you conceaue and propose them as Sapientiall and soueraigne collections. But he that wilfully wandreth, thinketh no way straighter, then that he traceth, and dreamers are often delighted with empty shadowes; now if we take your owne translation, the Apostle telleth vs, that Christ was heard in that he feared, ergo he did not suffer it, and though it might come, yet because he was freed from it, certainly it came not; and many things might come more then the death of the body, and yet not the death of the soule. If then you haue no stronger meanes to conclude the death of Christs soule, then these, the simplest Reader will soone perceiue, that your reasons be as frigent, as your humours be feruent; and though there be fire in your mind, yet there is water in your mouth, for you truly conceaue, or iustly conclude nothing.
            
               Defenc. pag. 138. li. 3. 
               Sec. to the Hebrewes. Christ abolished through death him, that had the power of death, that is, the Diuell, and so deliuered all them, which for feare of death were all their life time subiect to bondage. Heere I see no reason in the world but that the Apostle by the often repeating of death, and by the naturall referring of it in one place (as it were) to the other, doth

vnderstand and signifie one and the same death altogether. But it is the death of the soule which the Diuell hath power and execution of, also the death of the soule sinnefull men were held in feare of all their life long. It followeth then (I suppose) that euen through the death of the soule, Christ abolished the Diuell, and deliuered his children.] I know not whether your eies be open, or your braines sound that you see nothing, but what pleaseth your selfe. And what if they be either so dimme or so dull, that you see not the truth, is that a reason that your ignorance or wilfulnesse must be the loadstone of our creed? with such peeuish and priuate presumption would you preuaile against Scriptures, Fathers, and the whole church of Christ, that what you doe not, or will not see, we must relinquish as false and erroneous? to let you see (if you be not blinded with preferring your fansies before the trueth of Christ,) that this is a lazie, loose, and lewd argument, which heere you make; take your owne maior or first proposition, that Christ suffered the selfe same death, which he abolished, whereof the Diuell had power and execution and whereof we were in feare (being not redeemed) all our life long; and set this for the second proposition or assumption; but it is most euident, that the Diuell had power and execution of eternall death, and to the feare of euerlasting Destruction were we subiect all the time of our life, before we were deliuered by Christ: ergo Christ suffered eternall death and damnation in hell. For he abolished that from the faithfull; and thereof the Diuell had power and execution, as also we were in feare and danger of that without the Redeemer. What say you to this conclusion grounded on your owne collection and proposition? see you the falsenesse and wickednesse thereof? and yet if your assertion be true, that Christ must redeeme vs with the same kind of death, whereof we were in feare and bondage without him, and abolish the Diuell with that verie death, whereof he had power and execution, the one is as strong as the other. But who besides you would warble thus in so waighty matters?
            True it is, that the name of death compriseth all the kinds of death, I meane of bodie, of soule, of both for euer; and this chaine of death is inseparable and ineuitable, where Christ doth not breake it. By the malice of the diuell perswading sinne, which is the losse of grace, and death of the soule in this life, came into the world the death of the bodie; that hence both body and soule might be haled to hell; though first the soule, and after the bodie, when at the last day it shall rise from the corruption of the graue to euerlasting destruction. To thinke that Christ submitted himselfe to all these sorts of death, corporall, spirituall and eternall, is most hellish blasphemie; for so he should not haue redeemed vs, but destroyed himselfe, bodie and soule foreuer. To say that Christ deliuered vs not from all these lincks of death, from spirituall death (whiles here we liue) from eternall death, after this life, and at the generall resurrection, from the power of the graue, where our bodies rot in the meane time, is heathenish impietie and heresie denying the whole force and fruit of our redemption by Christ. Since then he cleered vs from all, and yet suffered not all sorts of death, it is manifest (which is the Apostles meaning in the wordes by you cited) that by one kind of death, which in Christ was corporall, he freed vs from all power of death, heere and heereafter in bodie and soule; not preseruing our bodies, that they should not turne to dust, but restoring them after death, which is the farre more marueilous and mightie worke of God. And this is euery where so plainly witnessed in the Scriptures, and plentifully confessed by the learned and auncient fathers, that none but he that is blinder then a bat, would professe he seeth no such thing. ChristMatth 20. 
               gaue his life a ransome for many, and

               1. Peter 1.

If then the bloud of Christ clense vs from all sinne, by which the diuell and death had power ouer vs; It is most certaine, that Christ abolished sinne and Satan by suffering his bloud to be shed vnto death for the remission of sinnes, & raising himself, that is the Temple of his bodie from death into a glorious and blessed life, by which the power and kingdome of Satan, were vtterly ouerthrowen.

               Against this you haue no reason at all, but wordes and wrestings, and vaine oftentation of Fathers, none of them all denying our sense.] The reason of all reasons is against it; which is, that no man, nor Angell may adde, or alter any thing in the Christian faith, without the sure warrant of the sacred Scriptures. Rom. 10.

You talke of words and wrestings, as knowing them best, and vsing them most; and herein I am content to stand to the iudgement of the wise and indifferent Reader, whether you haue brought ought yet for the death of Christes soule, or his suffering the second death, but your owne speaches and surmises, abusing the wordes of the holy Ghost to your owne fansies without either cause or colour.
            And touching the vaine ostentation of Fathers; who, as you vaunt, deny not your sense, I brought ancient & learned writers not ignorant of the Christian faith, as being the pillars of their times, that with great perspicuitie and vehemence denied, as I doe, the death of Christs soule; and affirmed with me the death, which Christ suffered in the body of his flesh, to be a most sufficient ransome for the sinnes of the whole world. Augustins words were; August. epist. 99. 
               The same flesh in which only Christ died, rose againe by the quickning of the spirit. For that Christ was dead in soule, that is in his humane spirit, who dare

                  , since the death of the soule (in this life) is none else but sinne, from which he was altogether free? This you say denieth not your sense: and why? because you auouch the death of Christs soule, which Austen asketh who dare auouch? to say that Christ suffered the death of the soule, is with Austen an impudent and wicked presumption, and no part of the Christian faith, or of mans redemption. Austen by the death of the soule ment sinne, you will say, which you meane not. You say by your leaue, that Christ Trea. pa. 42. li. 20. 
               became defiled and hatefull to God by our sinnes; And so if pollution of sinne be the death of the soule, that kind of death you ascribe to Christ, though not for his owne sinnes, yet for ours, then made his, no lesse by guilt then by punishment, as you teach directly against the assertion of Saint Austen, who saith: August contra Fa

But you vnderstand not Austen, when he saith, there is no death of the soule (here) but sinne; he doth not thence exclude the consequents and adherents to sinne in this life, but noteth, that onely sinne doth kill the soule, because it doth separate vs from God, who is the life of the soule; and the light and grace of God departing from the soule by sinne, the soule dieth, that is looseth all her sense of God, and motion to God, by which she liueth vnto God. This with Austen, and this indeede by the word of God, is the death of the soule, which if you attribute to Christ, you incurre open and exquisite infidelitie. For your meaning therefore it maketh no great matter, if you will offer to correct our Creede you must speake as the Scriptures speake, and not deliuer

Wherein least you should vse your accustomed euasion, that the flesh of Christ compriseth as well his soule, as his bodie, Saint Austen hath wisely preuented you, in saying, the same flesh onely died, Which rose againe. Where if your learning serue you to say, that Christes soule rose againe the third day, you shall make vs a new resurrection of soules, after this life, as the Scripture doth of bodies, which were a meete deuice for such a diuine, as you are. How beit Saint Austen naming Christs soule a part from his flesh, and affirming of Christs soule, that no man (in his right wits) dare auouch Christs soule died, but onely that flesh, which rose againe; it is as cleere, as mans speech may be, that he vtterly refuseth the death of Christs soule, as an irreligious and vnchristian position, and directly teacheth this as a ground confessed in Christian religion, that Christ died in his bodie alone, which rose againe the third day, and not in his soule, which no Christian man durst auouch was euer dead.

For by this, as by infinite other places in Austen, it is euident; first, that Christ tooke not vnto him the guilt of our sinne: secondly, that hee died the death of the bodie onely: thirdly, that by that his corporall death he destroyed sinne, hell, and Satan: fourthly, that the death of the soule he could not die, because he could haue no sinne; and lastly, that he was farre from the second death, which is the eternall damnation of bodie and soule. Acknowledge these, which neuer Christian man yet refused, and we shall soone resolue all other questions. If you haue of late gotten you a faith besides this, and against this generall Creede of all Christendome, looke well to your new deuices; you may sooner be excluded from the faith, then your fansies be included in the faith.

               The word flesh, it seemeth, cannot heere in this place be vnderstood to signifie only the bodie of Christ. If that cannot be, then was S. Austen much deceiued, who out of these very words cōcluded, that Christ died in Epist. 99.

               My reason is, because wheresoeuer in the Scripture the flesh and the spirit are noted oppositely together in Christ, there the flesh signifieth alwayes the whole humanity, euen both parts thereof, the soule also, and not only the bodie.] First that rule hath no ground nor truth; and if it were addmitted, it proueth no such thing, as you would enforce. For in a case farre plainer, the name of Christ wheresoeuer it is applied to Christ liuing, I meane, saying, suffering, or doing any thing, there without all question the whole humanitie is comprised in that name, since Christes bodie without his soule could neither say, suffer, nor doe any thing. And yet were it mad diuinitie to attribute euery action and passion affirmed of Christ in the Scriptures, as well to his soule, as to his bodie. That Christ sate, that he hungred, that he did eate, that he slept, and was circumcised, buffited, whipped, and a number such like are auouched in the Scriptures of Christ liuing, that is of his whole

For the force to doe, and since to feele, is from the soule; and so in the death of the bodie, the soule is partaker with the bodie, not to lie dead and senselesse as the bodie doth, but to feele the paine of death, and suffer the separation from the bodie,

               Then Luke; where both spirit and flesh are not intended of Christ (as our obseruation requireth) but only the flesh.] Your obseruation is made to fitte S. Peters words to your fansie. For there are not many places in Scripture, where spirit and flesh are expressed and intended of the two natures of Christ, though in other places some words adioyned doe prooue him to be God, as well as man. In that of S. Luke, Christ doth not denie himselfe to be a diuine spirit, for then he were no God, since God is a Iohn 4. 
               spirit; nor to haue an humane spirit, for then he were no man; but that which they saw with their eies, he affirmed was flesh and bloud, and not any apparition in the shape of a man. And the words following, Luke 24. 
               as ye see me to haue, containe and note the other part of his humane nature, which was his soule and spirit, and consequently inferre, that he was a man, and had an humane spirit, though compassed with flesh and bones, as we haue.

               Then the Romans: where I affirme that flesh signifieth the whole manhood of Christ, according

to the which he came from Dauid, euen as well as Salomon or Nathan did, who were Dauids sonnes in their intire and perfect nature.] Whether Christs body without a soule, which was but a Carcasse, be alwaies in the Scriptures intended by the name of Christs flesh, this is not the question; there is but one place in the new Testament, where Christs flesh importeth his dead body, as when Peter saith, Christes 
               Acts 2. 
               flesh saw no corruption; but whether whatsoeuer is attributed to Christs flesh with comparison or mention of his diuine nature, doe properly agree as well to his soule as to his body, this is the thing in question betwixt you and me. That the man Christ was borne of the Virgin, and died on the Crosse, there is no doubt, but that his soule was made of the seed of Dauid, and circumcised, & crucified as well as his body, this is your error; and for this you haue no shew in the word of God, and therefore you seeke by rules of your owne making to draw it in by the heeles, when you cannot by the head. It is but a shift to saue your selfe, when you tell your Reader, that Christs whole manhood came from Dauid, as well as Salomon, or Nathan did; The point is whether Christes soule were made of the seed of Dauid, as well as his body was. That I denie, and haue the Apostle for my warrant, that men are only the Heb. 12. 
               Fathers of our bodies, and God is the immediate Father of (our) spirits. Which if it be true in all men, then Salomon and Nathan were the sonnes of Dauid, not because their soules were made of the seed of Dauid, but only their bodies; and yet since they drew as much from their father, as children by Gods ordinance do or may do, therefore were they the sonnes of Dauid. In Christ it is most sure, which the Apostle saith, that according to the fl
                     •…
                  sh he was made of the seed of Dauid. This by no meanes can be verified of his soule, howsoeuer you would slubber it vp by calling his whole manhood the sonne of Dauid, which I doe not denie. Not that his soule was made of the seed of Dauid, as was his body that is an open and an odious error; but that his flesh made of the seed of Dauid which was the Virgins body, was also quickened with a soule from God in due time, that came not out of Dauids loines. Euen so the whole man in Christ died on the Crosse, not that his soule was depriued of life, or left dead, as was his body; but that the coniunction of soule and body, which maketh the whole man, was dissolued by death, his flesh lying in the graue without corruption, and his soule remaining in the hands of God, to which it was commended.
            
               Defenc. pag. 139. 
               So likewise Christ was kinne to the lewes according to his whole humanity, as well as Paul was.] When you can shew kindred in spirits, as well as in flesh, that is deriued from parents, then say that Paul and Christ were kin to the Iewes according to their whole humanity; till you proue that, howsoeuer vse of speach may be endured which must be interpreted according to the truth, you can neuer conclude there is consanguinity betweene soules, as there is betweene bodies. And spight of your heart, if you will not maintaine vntrueths to vphold your credit, as your maner is, the Apostle teacheth you how to vnderstand those words, that as we haue fathers of our bodies, from whom our spirits come not, but immediatly from God; so kindred and consanguinity, which commeth by the parents, goeth by flesh and bloud receiued from them, and not by soules infused from God. S. Iohn leadeth you to the same rule, that men are borne of bloud, and of the will of the flesh, and so by flesh and bloud commeth kindred; God giuing soules to quicken their bodies. Wherefore the Scriptures, when they expresse kindred, they note it by flesh and bone. As when Laban said to Iacob, Thou art my 
               Gene. 29. 
               bone, and my flesh; So Iudah of Ioseph, Gene. 37. 
               he is our brother, and our flesh. So Abimelech to his mothers brethren, Iudic. 9. 
               I am your bone and your flesh. And vsualy where kindred is claimed or yeelded, the Scriptures expresse it by 2. Sam. 5. 19 
               flesh and bones, as Adam said to Eue, Gen. 2. 
               This now is bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh. So that howsoeuer you dreame or talke of the consanguinity of soules, it is like the rest of your nouelties which haue no handfast but in your head; and the exception taken by me will stand good, doe you and your adherents what you can, that in these attributes to the manhood of Christ you shall neuer prooue they properly pertaine to both parts, but to the whole conioyned, or to one part seuerally respected.

               Further, that which you bring out of the Corinthians compared with this in Peter, doth most cleerely open and confirme the same. He was crucified touching his infirmitie, but liueth by the power of God. His soule had infirmities of suffering in it, aswell as his bodie: therefore his soule also is vnderstood here that it was crucified and died, that is, according to the condition thereof.] You proue not what you promise, but pronounce what you please, which if any man will suffer you to doe, we shall soone haue a new Church, a new Faith, and all things new. Afore you pretended rules at least, though void of reason and trueth; now you bend against all rules of learning, Logicke, Grammar, and Diuinitie. For I pray you in Grammar what is 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , and 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                here vsed by the Apostle? Are the parts heere noted, that were crucified and raised to life, or the cause from which first death was suffered, and after life was recouered by our Sauiour? A man would thinke, that 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                were by or through weaknesse, euen as 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                is by or through the power of God. Christ then was crucified, not by the immediate hand of God, but by the Iewes, who could not crucifie his soule, as they did his bodie. If you know not who crucified Christ, reade the Gospell afresh, or hearken to S. Peter, who sayd to the Iewes; Act. 2. 
               Iesus of Nazaret haue ye taken by the hands of the wicked, and crucified and slaine: and proclaimed openly to the Rulers of the people, and Elders of Israel, Act. 4. 
               Be it knowen to you all and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Iesus Christ of Nazaret, whom ye haue crucified, whom God raised againe from the dead, by him this Creeple standeth whole before you. The Iewes then 1. Cor. 2. 
               crucified the Lord of glorie, who could not kill the soule but onely the bodie. Therefore they crucified onely his bodie; and other crucifiers of Christ the Scripture nameth none. How come you then against all learning and trueth to collect that Christs soule was crucified?

               Other reasons also I noted seruing well heereunto, but I omit to rehearse them againe. For it seemeth your selfe agreeth with vs in them, holding expresly that the spirit heere in Peter is the Deitie of Christ according to Austins iudgement. Now this being granted and acknowledged, how can it be likely but that the other opposite part of the flesh must needes import his whole and entire Manhood. 
               Pag. 140. li. 11. 
               Now this being so, then it followeth by the text, that Christ in his Passion was done to death both in soule and body.] Your other reasons tended after your maner to shew, that spirit in Peters words did not signifie the soule of Christ; to which I said nothing, because I therein agreed with you. Where then you conclude ouer-hastily, that therefore it signifieth the Deitie of the second person in Trinitie, the text enforceth no such thing; as that the second person in Trinitie did in the daies of Noe preach by his owne Godhead, and not by his spirit. Gene. 6. 
               The Lorde said, my spirit shall not alway strine with man, his daies shall be 120. yeeres. Which whether we take to be the wordes of the Father, or the Sonne, by the spirit there is ment the holy Ghost, which proceedeth from the Father and the Sonne, and is called the spirit of them both, and did by the tongue of Noe the Preacher of righteousnesse witnesse the iudgement of God to come by the floud vpon the wicked and disobedient world. By this power of his which is his spirit, God quickned the humane flesh

of Christ, when it was crucified and dead in the graue, and by the same spirit shall he restore and quicken all the bodies of the faithfull after they be turned to dust. And although I haue no doubt but the workes of the Trinitie towards all creatures are vndeuided, and the power of the Father is the power of the Sonne, yet when the Scriptures doe testifie, that Christes humane flesh was quickned by the spirit we must vnderstand the holy Ghost: God the Father raising his Sonne, and the Sonne raising himselfe by the spirit of sanctification, which is the power of the Father and of the Sonne. So speaketh the Apostle to the Romanes. Rom. 1. 
               Christ made of the seede of Dauid as touching the flesh, and declared to be the Sonne of God, with power through the spirit of sanctification, by the resurrection from the dead. Where his flesh made of the seede of Dauid prooueth him to be a true man, and the mightie declaration of him to be the Sonne of God sheweth his Diuine nature and glorie, which most appeared by the woonderfull works and gifts of the spirit of sanctification, powred out on all his after he was once ri

               that he, who was called the Sonne of Dauid according to the flesh was declared to be the sonne of God by the power, which was shewed from the holy Ghost after our Lord Iesus was risen from the dead. Oecumenius, Oecumenius in ca. 1. epist. ad Rom.

               the spirit of sanctification is heere taken for the holy Ghost, who giueth sanctity to men and Angels, who also fashioned, quickened and sanctified Christs manhood in the Virgins womb, of the seed of the Virgin, without the seed of man.
            
            The new writers with one consent, as Erasmus, Zuinglius, Peter Martyr, Bullinger, Musculus, Gualter, Hemmingius, Aretius, and Caluine himselfe follow the same interpretation, so that your obseruation against and after all their iudgements is misbegotte and borne out of time; and brought in of purpose to paue the way for your new found fansies, which haue no ground, but in your new made notes as much crossing probabilitie, as authoritie. Yea the obseruation wrongeth the distinction of the persons in the most blessed Trinitie, and dishonoreth rather the Deitie of the Sonne of God then aduanceth it; whiles the Sonne of God, and the spirit of holinesse, being both expresly named, you take them both for one person; and make the Sonne of God in his diuine nature to be lesse then the possessor, or giuer of life and righteousnesse, eueu a receauer of both. For in all these places where you say the name of spirit is vsed to signifie Christs Godhead, the power and worke of the holy Ghost is there intended and expressed, as that Christ was 
               Rom. 1. 
               declared to be the Sonne of God by the spirit of sanctification; and was 
               1. Tim. 3. 
               God manifested in the flesh, iustified by the spirit, as also 1. Pet. 3. 
               mortified in the flesh, but quickned by the spirit. The spirit of sanctification is the title of the holy Ghost sanctifying as well the Manhood of Christ, as his members; and the giuing thereof declareth the Sonne to be true God, whose spirit this is as well as the Fathers, and by whom the Sonne worketh as well as the Father. And where it is written, that Christ was Iustified and quickned by the spirit, if there you reade in the spirit,
               
meaning in the Deitie of Christ, then Christes Godhead receaued life and righteousnesse, which by your leaue is a speech ne allowed ne frequented in the Scriptures. For though the second person in Trinitie by his internall and eternall generation receaued all, that he hath, from the Father, who begat him, yet of this generation, which is secret, substantiall, and eternall, the Apostles speake not, when they say Christ was quickned and iustified; but the one sheweth that Christes body, which was put to death was raised againe to life by the power of his spirit: the other noteth that he was God manifested in the flesh and iustified, that is, prooued and confirmed so to be by the mightie workes and graces of Gods spirit shewed as well in his owne person, as in all his members. For that is the intent of the Apostles wordes, not that his diuine glorie was onely praised or acknowledged of men, but that the world beleeued, the Angels admired, the spirit iustified, that is most mightily and cleerely witnessed him to be God manifested in the flesh. Then hath your obseruation his full discharge, since there is no one place, where these wordes the spirit and flesh are applied to Christ to note his two natures, though his Godhead be testified and plainely prooued in most of the same places by more pregnant wordes then spirit, which is common to Angels, soules, and windes; and onely sheweth, that it is no palpable or sensible body; where the name of spirit alone in the Scriptures standing for the third person in Trinity noteth the power and grace of the holy Ghost, by which these things were wrought for Christs manhood. And in that place of Peter, on which you most depend, if you follow the Syriac translation to which your owne adherents so often appeale, the Apostles words are, Christ was dead in body, but liu
                     •…
                  d in spirit, which conuinceth first, that flesh is there taken for the body of Christ contrary to your obseruation, and that Christ still liued in spirit, which euerteth your maine conclusion intended from this place for the death of Christs soule.
            But were it, as you suppose, that flesh and spirit were ascribed to Christ to declare his two natures, the one to be corporall and humane, the other to be spirituall and diuine; how doth it follow, that euery thing affirmed of his manhood must properly agree both to body and soule? by what Logicke conclude you that? you may as well auouch that Christs soule is truely corporall or carnall, because it is comprised vnder the name of flesh, as that other attributes of the body are verified in the soule. Which if you thinke absurd, though the name of flesh by a figure of speach import the whole man, because the Scripture speaketh not of a dead, but of a liuing man: then is there lesse cause, that ech action or passion affirmed of the flesh should exactly or properly be referred to the soule, since the common vse of speach intending the whole by a part is figuratiue; and in figuratiue speaches, as where the soule or the flesh are taken for the whole man, the attributes cannot be properly restrained to ech part, no more then the names are. And euen out of those places by which you would collect death to be common to the body and soule of Christ, the auncient fathers conclude death to be proper to the body of Christ, and not common to the soule; as Austin out of Saint Peter. August.

               Heere you obiect, thus I note all the attributes of the bodie common to the soule. Nay for sooth that I doe not;] Forsooth the ground of your conclusion inferreth so much what euer your meaning is, or may be. For this you vrge, that wheresoeuer the flesh

of Christ is taken for the whole manhood of Christ, the thing affirmed of Christs flesh must be common to soule and bodie; and thence you conclude, that since Christ suffered death in his flesh by Saint Peters wordes, he must by the Scriptures 
                  •…
               e sayd to haue died as well in the soule as in the bodie. You regard no more but death to bee common to both, which of all others is not common to both, because they are seured by death; but vpon this collection it followeth, if your rule bee not false, that since through out the Scrtptures, where mention is made of Christes liuing flesh, or of his actions, or passions, the whole manhood of Christ is there vnderstoode, then consequently all those thinges so affirmed of Christ must be common to both the parts of Christs humane nature, that is as well to his soule, as to his bodie. To pretend your meaning against your speach, when you see how absurd your saying is, is a childish vanitie; if your obseruation and illation be true, this that I obiect, followeth; if those be not true, then faile you of your first purpose, that death must be common to both parts of Christes manhood. Besides the falsitie of your collection appeareth by this, that when things are attributed to Christ liuing, which are proper to the soule or bodie, and yet are ascribed to Christs person, this kind of speach is figuratiue, either because the whole is taken fot a part, or because either part hath some concurrence or reference to the actions and passions auouched of Christ. But thence you may not inferre, that all such things most properly agree to either part in Christ; that is such palpable ignorance, that you seeme not to conceiue, what a man is, or whereof he consisteth. For so you may conc
                  •…
               ude, that the soule eateth, drinketh, sleepeth, sitteth, falleth, and such like, as well as the bodie, because these things are affirmed of the person, that is of the whole man, though indeed performed by meanes of the bodie.
            More follie it is to vrge the same in death, which seuereth the soule from the bodie, and so leaueth nothing common to bodie and soule, but the generall attributes of a Creature, as to be locall, finite, and such like. For where death is the priuation of life, and the soule is the life of her bodie, what reason or sense can it haue, because man dieth, to say the losse of life must be common to the soule, which is the cause of life, as well as to the bodie, which is but the vessell, or vehicle of life. True it is, the soule by death is driuen to depart from her bodie, but so long, as she is present, there is life, and she must first be gone before death, which is the lacke of life, can seaze on the bodie. To draw this consequent then from reason, that the soule must die, when man dieth, is the part of him that vnderstandeth not what reason meaneth; except by the dying of the soule he note the departing of the soule from the bodie, in which sense the Scriptures sometimes applie the name of death to the soule, as wee shall afterwardes see.
            
               Defenc. pag. 140. li. 14. 
               This attribute of dying vnderstood in such sort and manner as the bodie properly dieth, that is to become without life and sense, I make not common to the soule.] The whole man consisting of bodie and soule, is most properly said to die, that is to be dissolued, the soule departing from the bodie; the bodie is properly said to bee dead, that is to bee void of life and sense. and if we say, the bodie dieth, as speach is often guided rather by vse then by rule, we meane the bodie beginneth to lacke sense and life, and to bee possessed by death. And though the soule cannot be void of life and sense in such sort as the bodie is, because she is the life of the bodie, yet when the soule is dead, shee is vtterly void of her life, which is God, and hath no more sense or feeling of him, then the bodie lying dead hath of the soule. How then doth it follow, that because Christ died in the flesh, or in his manhood, that his soule must be dead after her manner of dying, as well as his bodie after his sort of death? [where the whole dieth, either part, you will say, must die.] But Peter doth not say, Christ died in his whole manhood, that is your lame and blind conceit, but that Christ died in the flesh. And yet the whole manhood may die, and not both parts, because the whole is a thing conioyned of parts, and so dissolued, where they are seuered, though both parts doe not die. [the whole, you meane for euery part.] Your meaning is, not the matter, but Peters words are the thing that I stand on. Now what doe they inferre, when he saith, Christ died in the

                if in the former words of Peter, his meaning were to say, that Christes soule and bodie, as you conceaue him, were done to death; then of necessitie Christ must be quickned and restored to life, as well in his humane Soule, as in his Bodie. And this is so farre from being absurd and false, as you proclaimed it, that it is openly blasphemous otherwise to saie or thinke, that Christ was neuer made aliue in his humane soule, if once it were dead, as you collected out of Peters words. What course now take you to colour these incongruities. You ment it was absurd to say, that Christes soule was quickned, as was his bodie. Of the maner of death you speake there not a word, but onely seeke to prooue, that spirit in that place can not be taken for Christes soule, because it is most absurd and false, (as you say) that Christ was made aliue in his humane soule. How you will iangle or iuggle touching your intent, is not to this purpose; you must answere for the sense, which you would patch to Peters words. The death, which Christ suffered in his flesh by Peters assertion, was it the death of the body alone, or of both body and soule? if of the body only; then is your commentane, which corrupteth Peters words, absurd, false, and wicked. Did Peter intend to teach, that Christ died in both parts of his manhood, that is in soule as well as in bodie? then is it a necessarie trueth, and point of piety to confesse and affirme, that Chist was made aliue in his humane soule, which you say is absurd and false. Which way will your wisedome winde out of this grinne? you ment it is absurd for the soule to be quickened, as the body is. You ment as best serued your turne, but what ment Peter? if he affirmed the soule of Christ died, as you interprete him, must not his words auouch that Christes soule was made aliue, except you resolue, that Christs soule once dead was neuer quickned againe? and though you set a bold face on these contradictions, and say you are farre from them, yet ech meane Reader may soone perceaue how farre you were ouershot in them, though heere you would outface them. And where you now say, that in such a sense you doe not denie, but Christ may be said to be quickned in the spirit, what is this but to grant that now, which before you called absurd and most false.

               I hope it is cleere to reasonable men, that Christes soule according to the Scriptures phrase may be said in some sort to haue tasted & suffered death, that is the extreamest feelings of Gods wrath for sinne, and the most vehement paines of the damned, but in a singuler maner and extraordinarie vvay. And to the same reasonable men I referre it, whether you haue brought one word or syllable out of holy Scripture concluding that Christ died

the death of the soule, or the second death. The Scripture phrase you haue peruerted and distorted to your meaning, but the words are farre from inferring any such thing euen in the iudgement of the meanest. Your mittigations, In some sort, in a singular manner, and extraordinarie way, What argue they but your wresting of the Scriptures from their right sense, since no such thing is there affirmed, yea the death of the soule, and the second death in the Scriptures are such, as you dare not auouch of Christ, but with these limitations, which are no where mentioned in the Scriptures, but are houels to shroud your absurd and false doctrine from the tempest of the word of God conuincing you of impiety and heresie, if you did not thus delude the force of them? But in vaine doe you seeke for these vnsound refuges, when you be once driuen from your footing in the word of God. For you must not only prooue by the Scriptures, which you neither haue done, nor can doe, that Christ suffered the death of the soule, and the second death, as you say he did; but you must shew also where these exceptions are written of Christ, otherwise they are but shifts declining the maine and generall trueth of the Scriptures touching the death of the soule, and the second death; which can no more agree to Christ then sinne and damnation; which you may as well defend, IN A SORT, in a singular manner, and extraordinary way to be found in Christ, as the other. And therefore dally not with the word of God, and faith of Christ, your singular manner will not saue you from abusing the one, and defacing the other, except you can shew, where your assertion as well as your exceptions be written in the booke of God. As for the most vehement paines of the damned, when you take the paines to prooue any thing otherwise then by the meale of your owne mouth, you shalbe answered. The paines of the damned expressed in the Scriptures are reiection, confusion, worme of conscience, and torment of hell fire, which if by your cunning conueyance you cast vppon the soule of Christ you shall cough me a singular and extraordinary miscreant.

               Where Austen seemeth to denie that Christes soule might die, he denieth that Christ suffered any paines of damation locally in hell after his death, as it seemeth some held about his time, whom heere he laboureth to confute.] If your ignorance were not euery where patent, some man perhaps would stumble at your report: but you are growen to such a trade of outfacing, that almost you can doe nothing else. That any such opinion was held in Austens time, as you talke of, and that he laboured there to confute the same, is a maske of your making to hide your owne blemishes; Austen refelleth that as a fable in exact words, when he saith, Quis audeat dicere, who dare say so? Now if some had so held, he must haue said, some doe say so; but who dare say so, is as much as no man dareth say so. If no man durst so to say, then no man was so wicked or irreligious in Austens time as to dare say, that Christs soule died, which now is become the greatest pillar of your pater noster.

               d by Christ, and surely if he were ignorant thereof, you would not iudge him worthy to be a Curate in your Conuenticles: but shew that he, who taught so much, and wrote so much (as his works declare) euer spake word of your new-found redemption by the paines of hell suffered in the soule of Christ; or by the second death. Against it he often speaketh, when he so soundly and sincerely collecteth out of the Scriptures, that Christ died for vs the death of the body onely, and not the death of the soule. And this how could it be a true or tolerable assertion, if the Scriptures did auouch, or the church in his time had professed the death of Christs soule to be the chiefest part of our redemption for sinne, and reconciliation to God? Wherefore neuer dreame he had no necessarie cause to speake of your sense; if your sense had beene a part of the Christian faith, would any man in his right wits haue asked, as Austen doth; Who dare auouch it? He discusseth the place of S. Peter, and when he commeth to those words, Christ was quickened in the spirit, or by the spirit, he resolueth this cannot be spoken of Christs humane soule, because that, which was afterwards quickened, was first mortified, and therefore we could not say, that Christs humane spirit or soule was restored to life, except we first yeelded, that it was before subiected to death. Now that Christs soule was euer dead, who durst auouch it? The reason, why Christs soule could neuer die, he rendreth thus, for that the Scriptures acknowledge no death of the soule in any but sin and damnation, to neither of which the soule of Christ could be subiect. August. epist. 99. 
               Certè anima Christi nullo mortificata peccato, vel damnatione punita est, quibus duabus causis mors animae intelligi potest. Surely the soule of Christ was neither dead with any sin, nor punished with damnation, which are the two waies how the death of the soule may be possibly vnderstood. This collection of S. Austins out of the Scriptures touching the death of the soule is most sound, and cannot be shaken with all your shewes and shifts, talke of ordinarie and extraordinarie as long as you will. That standing good, which yet we see immooueable for all your battery, it followeth ineuitably, that Christ ne did ne could die the death of the soule, ne may any man defend it, without apparent falsity and impiety. What proofes you haue profered against S. Austins conclusion, let the Reader iudge, I must confesse my selfe very blind, if he see any; for I see none, and therefore not only S. Austins words, but his reasons out of holy Scripture stand firme, and hold you fast to the grinding stone, being no way as yet counteruailed or controled, but with your vaine speaches and most vnlearned euasions.
            
               Defenc pag. 142. li. 2. 
               Nay according to Austins owne definition of the soules dying it will easily appeare, that Christes soule may be said to haue suffered some kind of death. Mors est spiritus, deseri a Deo. The death of the soule saith he, is Gods for saking of it, but the Scripture saith, God did forsake him for a season: yea the Fathers also agree fully therevnto. Therefore by Anstins definition largely and rightly taken, Christ may be said in some sense to haue died in soule.] From your shifts you returne againe to your proofes, and neither barrell is better herring. The maior you thinke, is Austins, the minor is Christs owne words, and what, trow you, should hinder the cōclusion. This reason hath but three of your wonted flowers, I must not say faults, the maior is larger then Austen euer ment, and the minor no way matcheth it, except you quite alter the words of Christ, and the conclusion commeth nothing neere to your purpose. Examine them in order. Not euery forsaking of the soule is death, for the godly often in the Scriptures complaine (as I haue shewed) that they are forsaken of God, when yet their soules liue: but as life is repugnant to death, and God is the life of the soule, so till God haue vtterly forsaken the soule, she is not dead. Whiles she retaineth any fellowship of grace with God, who is her life, she is not dead, because she partaketh with life. As then death is the vtter priuation of life, so God must vtterly forsake the soule, before she can be pronounced to be dead; and that kind of forsaking is indeed the death of the soule in this life. So that your maior, if euer you will come neere S. Austins meaning, must be the

death of the soule is Gods vtter for saking of the same. And that thus you must conster S. Austins words, appeareth euery where by his In Psal. 70. in Iohan. tract. 47. de verbis Apost. Serm. 30. 
               comparison with the death of the bodie, which is not dead, till the soule be vtterly departed from it. For as the body which hath in it any power or presence of the soule, is not dead but liuing, so the soule, that hath any communion with God who is her life, can not be truely sayd to be dead, but as yet to haue life. Were you no Diuine, but a plaine Sophister, reason teacheth you so to vnderstand S. Austins words: for where life and death be priuatiues, as well in the soule, as in the bodie, the one hath no place, till the other be vtterly quenched. He is not blinde, that hath any sight; nor deafe that hath any hearing; the priuation vtterly excludeth the habite; neither is the soule dead, that hath any force or effect of life in her, and consequently not euerie forsaking, but onely an vtter forsaking of God is the death of the soule heere in this life.
            Your minor then should be, that Christes Soule was vtterly forsaken of God, which are not the words of Christ on the crosse, nor any way consonant to them: yea the verie entrance to that speech, when Christ saide, My God, my God, doth prooue the quite contrarie. Matth. 22. 
               God is not the God of the dead, but of the liuiug. Then directly by the plaine wordes of Scripture, when Christ said, My God, my God, his soule confessing God to be his God, was liuing, and consequently the wordes following, why hast thou forsaken me, doe net prooue the death of the soule, vnlesse you make the Sonne of God so vnwise as not to vnderstand, what he said, or so amazed, that he marked not his owne speech; which with you perchance is no absurditie, but with me it is a wicked and vnchristian impietie. Christes wordes therefore import, that he found a kinde of forsaking, but not that his soule was forsaken of the trueth, grace, or spirit of God, these be blasphemies to auouch, and no points of pietic; nor that he was vtterly or altogither forsaken, which onely is the death of the soule. And against this wresting of Christes wordes from their right sense, how many testimonies of scriptures and Fathers haue I sormerly brought? all which you  trippe ouer with a light foote, and make as though you felt them not. You haue beene told, Galat 3. 
               the iust shall liue by saith. So that if Christ wanted not faith, he could not choose but liue in soule. Againe, 1. Iohn 4.

                   thereof is life and peace. Then must you take from Christ the spirit of God with all the gifts and graces thereof, before you can depriue the soule of Christ from life. What an hellish heape of blasphemies are here before you can affirm, that Christs soule was dead according to the Scriptures, & according to Austins meaning, who herein ioineth with the Scriptures. Christ then ly

               ing in soule with perfect obedience and patience, and assuredly knowing God to be his God, & his Father, complaineth that he was left or forsaken, that is, either not deliuered from his troubles & afflictions, but left in sinners hands, to do their pleasure with him; or deuested of his power, and left through weaknesse vnto death, which should for a season seuer his soule from his bodie; or lastly lest in this shame of the crosse, & anguish of body, without any open or sensible shew or signe of Gods fauour towards him, or care for him. All these kindes of forsaking the learned and ancient Fathers acknowledge in Christ on the crosse, and other forsaking of the soule they admit none, howsoeuer you falsly pretend their full agreement.
            Come now to your conclusion, if you could euince that Christes soule was vtterly forsaken of God, and depriued of life, which you can neuer; and to offer it, will conuince you of hainous and wilfull heresie and blasphemie: yet can you conclude no more, but the death of the soule in this life, which is either ignorance or contempt of God; Hell paines you cannot inferre, nor the torments of the damned, which are the second death; and so your great flourish out of Austen for the death of Christes soule is but a

               We died a double death, therefore we must looke for a double resurrection. Christ died but one kind of death, therefore herose but one kind of resurrection. Adam died body and soule; he died to sinne, and to nature. In what day soeuer ye eat of the tree, said God, ye shall die the death. That very day Adam did not die (in which he did eat) but he then died to sinne, and long after to nature. The first is the death of the soule, the other is the death of the body. For the death of the soule is sinne or euerlasting punishment. To vs men there is a double death, and therefore we must haue a double resurrection. To Christ there was but one kinde of death, for he sinned not, and that one kinde of death was for vs. He owed no kind of death, for he was not subiect to sinne, and so not to death.

the one is soolish, the other senselesse. To this double death of ours, our Sauiour applied his single death, and to make a double resurrection in vs, he preferred and proposed his one kind of death for a Sacrament, and for a Precedent: for he was no sinner or wicked person, that he should need any renewing, as one dead in spirit, but putting on mortall flesh, and dying in that ALONE, and rising in that ALONE, he fitted that ALONE to both our (deaths) placing therein a Sacrament for our inward man, and an example for our outward.

Seeke for death in his SOVLE, IT NEVER VVAS THERE. Seeke for death in his flesh, there was it indeed. And a little after, Why doest thou maruell? Neither was Christes soule dead, nor his Godhead; ONLY HIS FLESH DIED. Neither want the same words in effect in his printed Sermons: In Iohannem tractat. 47.

                DEATH OF THE SOVLE HE DIED NOT. The death of the soule they truely deriue from the Scriptures to be either sinne, or damnation: sinne, by which men are depriued of all

grace, and so of the life of God: and damnation, which is a perpetuall reiection from all blisse, addicting the wicked to eternall and intollerable miserie in the torments of hell fire. Which of these things will this dreamer denie? will he say, that Christ died moe deaths then ONE, and as well the death of the soule, as of the bodie? So he must say, if he will vphold his new redemption by the death of Christs soule, and so he doth say: but whether there in he crosse not the full consent of Christs whole Church, I leaue it to thy censure. Will he shift, as hee hath hitherto done, with the name of flesh, that it compriseth as well the soule as the bodie, and therefore by the death of Christs flesh onely, the Fathers doe not exclude the death of Christs soule, but the death of his Godhead? they prooue indeed against the Arians, that the Sonne of God could not die in his Diuine nature, but onely in his humane flesh. And this, as we now see, is one of their maine reasons: The soule of Christ died not, nor coulde die; much lesse then his Godhead. And therefore the most of them do expresse that argument, vtterly denying that Christes soule died any kinde of death, but onely his flesh. Besides a number of them not onely expres

                  , which can not be taken for the soule, and with like zeale and truth auouch, that Christ died in his body onely. So that these three stand for cleere and sounde conclusions with all these Fathers: First, that Christ died BVT ONE KIND of death. Secondly, that HE DIED ONELY IN HIS FLESH, OR BODY; and thirdly, that THE DEATH OF THE SOVLE HE NEITHER DID, NOR COVLD DIE.

               e with the name of death, and say they ment not his kind of death? that will nothing relieue him. For first if Christ died but one kinde of death; and of his bodily death no Christian may so much as doubt, then by maine consequent out of their wordes, Christ died no death of the soule, let him take it how and which way he will. Againe, if Christ DIED ONELY IN BODY, as they likewise witnesse, then apparantly he died not any death of the soule, neither in your sense Sir Defenser nor in theirs. Lastly, what death of the soule can you shew mentioned in the Scriptures without the compasse of their diuision, that is, which is not sinne, or damnation? Of sinne the Apostles wordes are plaine.

               ertions on the maine foundations of the Diuine Scriptures. It is euident by nature, sense, and trueth, that priuatiues can not concurre at one and the same time, in one and the same subiect. For the one expelleth the other, and so can

not be found both together. Yea since the one of them cleerely remooueth the other, they can no more stand together, then may contradiction. For that which liueth, is not dead; and that which is dead, liueth not. I meane alwaies the same time, and the same part. But the soule of Christ by the manifest and manifold testimonies of holie Scripture did alwaies liue in the fulnesse of faith, of hope, of loue, of grace, of trueth, of spirit. It is euident therefore that the soule of Christ neuer died, nor could die. Which of these assertions will you encounter? that Christes soule may be aliue and dead both at one time? You would seeme the leafe before, to shunne the shame of Defenc. pag. 140. li. 25. 
               this absurditie, that Christes soule died and died not: will you now come plainely and grossely to it by auouching that Christes soule was at one and the same time LIVING AND NOT LIVING, DEAD AND NOT DEAD, that is both ALIVE AND DEAD? If you doe, there is no man in England that hath either eies or eares to see or heare, but he will reprooue you for a manifest beliar of his sense, as well as of Christs soule. Will you smoothly set yourselfe to one side, and say that Christs soule was not aliue? so many parts of life, as I haue named in the soule of Christ, so many pregnant proofes are there in holy Scripture that Christes soule was not onely liuing, but as full of life as of grace during the whole time of his passion. Neither is there any one of those things named by mee concerning the life of Christes soule, which you can take from Christ without apparent blasphemie. For if you depriue him of saith, hope, loue, grace, tru

                  th, or the spirit of God; you leaue him in Infidelitie, desperation, hatred of God, reprobation, falshood, and make him no way the Sonne of God, since they onely are the sonnes of God, who are ledde by the spirit of God. Now what shamefull and impious enormities these are, you can easily coniecture. So that of force you must confesse the soule of Christ to be liuing, and endued with all these parts and powers of the life of God, or else you must professe your selfe to be nothing lesse then a Christian. And euen the praiers which he made and obedience which he shewed in all and euerie his conflicts and agonies, prooue his soule not onely to liue, but to rest assuredly on the fauour and loue of God towards him, which are no fruites nor effects of the death of the soule, but exactly the conrrarie.
            Yet paine you thinke Christ might all this while suffer, and that most extreame; which you call the death of the soule.] Your calling sweete sower, good badde; light darknesse, and life death; changeth not the natures of the things, but conuinc

You must call things in Christ, not as pleaseth your fansie, but as the word of God directeth; and by witnesse thereof shall you neuer be able to proue, that Christs soule was dead; since thence so many sure demonstrations may be brought, that Christs soule was alwaiesIohn 1. 
               full of truth and grace, and of the Holy Ghost, not only in a greater abundance then either man or Angel hath, or can haue, but aboue all measure. And in this state if we should imagine with you, thatIohn 3. Christs soule suffred the greatest sense of torments that any creature can feele, yet this doth not inferre Christs soule to be dead, but expressely the contrary, since all paine,The soule of Christ in her greatest paines did most shew the life of patience and obedience to God. yea if it were possible, paine equall with hell it selfe suffered in this life with obedience and patience, (such as all Christs sufferings were, except you will wrappe him as well within sinning as suffering) doth conuince the soule of Christ to be rather liuing then dead; as the martyrs of Christ had their soules then most liuing in their greatest torments, when force of intolerable paine excluded their spirits from their bodies. And therefore I doe not a little maruaile how lightly you leape to determine and defend the death of Christs soule, since all paine endured with patience, obedience, and confidence, prooueth the soule to be most aliue to God-ward, euen when she departeth, as not able to sustaine the fury and violence of the torment encreasing. And heerein appeareth your notable error in calling that the death of Christs soule, which the Scripture calleth his obedience and victory. For he was Phil. 2.

            If you slide from the sense of absolute and inherent paine to the feare and horror of dereliction and desperation in the soule of Christ (for you role at your pleasure from one to another, and are constant in nothing, but in generall and doubtfull speaches, as were the first authors of this conceit;) and make that the death of the soule;No temptations without desparation kill the soule. then know you that these temptations kill not the soule, till they plant infidelity and desperation in the soule of man from which I trust you will cleere Christ, or els I m

               he trusteth in God, but they thought God had failed him in suffering him to come to that cursed kind of death, wherein they knew not the wisedome or power of God. But no Christian can be excused by ignorance, if he diminish the faith, hope, loue, patience or obedience of Christ in all his sufferings; and those not decreasing, it was no way possible for the soule of Christ to be but liuing, yea full of life & grace, how great soeuer the paines were, which he endured, or the temptations which he resisted. So that both fathers and Scriptures persue you narrowly to this straight, that Christes soule must either alwaies liue, and so your doctrine is vtterly false, which auoucheth the death of Christs soule to be the ground of our redemption; or if it died, it must die with sinne, since without sinne there is no death of the soule; and all paines and torments, that are possible in this life, if they be suffered with obedience and patience, doe rather demonstrate the life, then confirme the death of the soule, euen in the person of Christ Iesus.

               But our authorised Catechisme published by master Nowel and the homily sheweth that Christ suffered farre more sharpely then meere bodily death, euen the infinite paines of Gods wrath in his soule: which I pointed you vnto before, but you fairely leape it ouer.] You belie the one, and confute the other; and then charge me with leaping them both ouer. The homily which indeed is authorised, hath no such thing, as you report; the Catechisme, which is only approoued to be taught to children in schooles, hath more then you any way like or receaue, and yet not that, which you now defend. The sorow and paine, which the Catechisme supposeth in Christs soule, was the feare and horror of eternall death; that you not only refuse in plaine words, but refell with many reasons, as you thinke. The like you doe for Christs descent to hell, which the Catechisme confesseth to be, not the presence of Christs soule in Paradise, but an effectuall force thereof in hell, whereby the soules of the faithlesse saw their damnation to be iust, and the Diuel himselfe perceaued all his power to be destroyed and ouerthrowen. If you regard the Catechisme so highly as you pretend, why slippe you from it in these or other points at your pleasure? why obtrude you that to others as authorised, which your selfe doe not admit? indeed some men haue of late yeeres inclined to vehement and violent temptations offered to the soule of Christ in his sufferings, and some to feares and horrors euen of eternall death, as master Caluin, and the Catechisme, which you cite; but if you may be suffered to shrincke from them at your liking, neuer blame me, if I doe not preferre them before all these fathers. Howbeit to speake vprightly without wronging them, I doe not see, that either the Catechisme or master Caluin doe expressely defend the death of Christs soule, or the second death, but only the feare and horror, not of a temporall hell, as you haue distilled their infusion, but of eternall death; which you with might and maine reiect. And surely if they did contradict

the confession of all these fathers, I would adhere to the primatiue church of Christ in matters of faith, rather then to the deuices of late writers dissenting from themselues and others. But touching the death of Christes soule I see no cause to depart from them, since they define no such thing, and therefore they a

And till you leaue this contemning of ancient Fathers, and straining of later writers beyond their meaning, I for my part thinke you worthie of no charge in the church of Christ, neither of that you had, wherein you sowed as much cockle as corne, nor of that you may haue, except you change your mind; and learne to teach nothing to the people of God, but what is warranted by the word of God.

               `You say I should haue donne well to haue laied downe for a shew, which is written in Easy he laied downe his soule vnto death; Verily if I had, it would haue made some shew.] I said indeed the Prophet Esay would make a better shew for the death of Christ soule, then the Poet Terence, whom only you produced for proofe thereof: but such was then and still is your presumption, that on your bare word you will pronounce, what best pleaseth your fansie. Howbeit the words of Esay are but a shew for the death of Christes soule, since they exactly declare his bodily death to be the redemption of mankind. For when the soule in the Hebrew tongue, and in the old Testament is said to die, either by the soule are ment the vegetatiue and sensitiue powers of the soule, whereby the spirit of man is vnited to his body, and which are quenched by death; or by death is ment the distraction of the soule from the body, which violence of death is common as well to the soule thrust from her body, as to the body left without a soule. That signification of the word soule the Apostle sheweth, when he praieth, the1. Thess. 5.

When Iosephs brethren would haue slaine him, Ruben said vnto them;Genes. 37. vers. 21.

               This is as if a man should fall vpon his fellow, and kill him in the soule. And so Ieremie to Ierusalem,Iere 2. v 34. 
               In thy bosome is found the bloud of the soules of the poore innocents. Infinite places are there in the Scripture to like effect. All which declare, that the soule of man feeleth the death of the body by her departing from it; and that the Prophet Esay, when he said of Christ, He
               Esa. 53. v. 12, 
               powred forth his soule vnto death, Had no meaning but to describe Christs bodily death, in which the soule is powred out from the body, that is, wholy separated from it. The very phrase of powring forth the soule, which must needes be from the body, sheweth that the Prophet directly described the death of Christs body, by which the soule is emptied and powred out of the body, as out of a vessel replenished with it. So that heere you haue as much hold for the death of Christs soule, as you had before, which is vtterly none.

Also how resolute are you forbidding to diuert from the natiue and proper significations of words, but when the letter impugneth the grounds of Christian faith and charity.] In the Page; 167. which you quote, I neither spake of this place, nor of this word; and therefore your considering cappe was not on, when you so much mistooke my words. I know Nephesh is applied as well to beasts, who haue no soules, as to bodies once liuing, but then dead. And therefore of Nephesh I affirmed no such thing: of S. Lukes words

repeating Dauids, and exactly distinguishing the soule from the flesh in Christ, I did indeed auouch, and still doe, that we must not rashly depart from the proper significations of that and other words in the Scripture, except the letter breed some inconuenience to faith or good-maners. But what is that to this place, where though the word Nephesh be granted properly to import the soule, yet the rest sheweth it to be referred to the death of the body, because the soule is powred forth of the body by the death thereof, where before it was conteined and inclosed.

               We did iudge him as plagued, and smitten of God, but he was wounded for our transgressions. And S. Marke, when the Iewes had crucified Christ amidst two theeues, saith;Mark. 15. vers. 28. 
               Thus the Scripture was fulsilled, which saith he was counted among the wicked: Thereby noting their errour, not Christs desert. Besides it is somewhat saucily said, that Christ was accounted wicked in the righteous iudgement of God, & not by the malitious error of the Iewes. Such pleasure you take against both Scriptures and Fathers to auouch what you list, yea though it draw with it an iniurious slander to the sonne of God. The words of the Prophet, he
               vers. 9. 
               made his graue with the wicked, compared with those that solow, though he did no wickednesse; clearely conuince, that Christ was an innocent, though he were counted and vsed with malefactours; and that the Prophet neuer ment to correct Gods iudgement as corrupt, but to shew the wisedome and goodnesse of God, deliuering his Sonne to be esteemed and vsed as wicked by the wicked, and not by himselfe. Howbeit there is no necessity to referre these words to the person of God the Father, but they more fittely expresse the humility of Christ himselfe, who made his graue, that is, was content to die in the midst of two Theeues, and to be buried as they were, considering the coherence with the words precedent; which out of all question must be vnderstood of Christ himselfe. For thus they stand.vers. 8. 
               He was cut out of the land of the liuing, he was plagued for the transgression of my people.
               vers. 9. 
               He made his graue with the wicked Where no reason forceth any change of persons; and so the same person of Christ, who was cut from the land of the liuing, made his graue with the wicked.

               But chiefly considering withall, that also before he made his soule a sinne offering. Therefore you must needs graunt, that Gods word maketh Christs soule to be sacrificed for our sinne. And we desire no other death of the soule.] It is maruaile you doe not out of this place inferre, that Christs soule was made sinne, for the words are, when he shall make his soule sinne. But an offering for sinne is the vsuall signification of that word in the Scriptures, and therefore you did well in confessing so much, to saue me that labour. Christ then made his soule an offering for sinne; what deduce you out of those words? [we desire no other death of the soule.] In faith you be a sillie sacrificer, that know not a dead souleA dead soule is no sacrifice for sinne. to be no sacrifice for sinne. A dead soule is void of all things, which should please God; and so can be no sacrifice accepted for sinne.Psal. 51. 
               A troubled spirit (sorrowing for sinne) is a sacrifice to God, saith Dauid. But doth repentance kill or quicken the soule? God
               Acts 11. 
               giueth repentance vnto life, that is, he raiseth the soule first dead in sinne, by repentance vnto life.2. Cor 7. 
               Worldly sorrow causeth death, but Godly sorrow causeth repentance vnto saluation. Now saluation is not the death, but life of the soule.Hebr. 11. 
               Without faith it is impossible to please God. And the sacrifice, that shall abolish sinne, must needs please God. It must then not want faith, by which the righteous liue. Wherefore by your leaue I make the cleane contrarie conclusion out of those wordes. The soule of Christ was a sacrifice for sinne; but a dead soule is no sacrfice for sinne; the soule of Christ therefore was not dead. [Without death, you will say, there is no redemption for sinne.] Without bloud, which noteth the death of the bodie, there is no redemption for sinne; but the soule, I trust, hath no bloud to be shed. And so much the bodies of beasts offered, did prefigure, I meane the death of the bodie but not of the soule. Willing obedience, constant patience, and assured confidence in the soule of Christ submitting

it selfe to the counsell and will of his Father, was the spirituall and inward sacrifice, which Christ ioyned with the externall and bloudie sacrifice of his bodie. For hauing two parts, as all men ha

And graunt the soule were heere taken for life, what so great improper or vnused speach is that, since the soule is truely and properly the life of the body.

And since in the words of Esai, Christ powred forth his soule vnto death, there can by no learning bee more concluded out of that place, but that Christ willingly layd downe his soule to depart from that bodie, which is no way the death of the soule, as you fansie, but a plaine description of the death of Christs body. And where for your pleasure you will take it litterally, that is no proofe for the death of Christs soule, because the word soule may bee properly taken, when it is powred forth of the bodie by death; but it noteth a willing submission to death, where otherwise our soules are taken from vs, or we loose them whether we will or no, when we are left or put to death against our wils.

               Quid fecit passio, quid fecit mors, nisi corpus ab anima separauit? What did (Christs) passion, what did death, but separate (his) bodie from his soule? If the death and passion of Christ did nothing but separate Christs soule from his body; then neither Christs death nor passion preuailed to the death of his soule. And if his soule were not touched by death, then was it neuer dead: and so much Saint Austen witnesseth in the very same tractate. Ibidem. 
               Verbum non est mortuum, anima illa non est mortua. The word died not, the soule (of Christ) died not. And therefore the death of Christ, which the Scriptures euery where note, was the breathing of his soule out of his body, & not the separating of his soule from God, as you would haue it. Austins purpose in that place you little conceiue, if you make him haue but one purpose. As occasion serued he taught many things pertinent & incident to his text, which was large, euen from the 10. verse vnto the 20. of that Iohn 10. Chapter: And these words, I lay downe my soule for my sheepe, being part of his text, he had iust occasion to treate, what death Christ died for his sheepe, which was neither the death of his diety, nor the death of his soule, but only the separating of his soule from his bodie, if this make not against you, you haue good lucke, that nothing will reach you: his words refute the foolish error, which you would establish, that by the Scriptures Christ may be said to haue died the death of the soule, as well as the death of the bodie, which Austen expressely contradicteth, auouching the one, and denying the other, in as plaine speach, as any wise man can require.

               It is onely the Fathers abusiue speaking and altering the vsuall and ancient sense of words, that bred this error; their vnapt and perillous translating, that confirmed the same; and that is a thing too rife with the Fathers, yea with some of the auncient est of them, to alter and change the Authentike vse of wordes, whereby it is easie for errors and grosse mistakings to creepe in; is, or ought any good man to be so patient, or rather negligent as to heare a parrat thus prate against the whole Church of Christ in her best times next after the Apostles, and not onely to spare his folly, but to reuerence his pride?

For in substance and full effect they are euidently and generally against you and for vs. If thou thinke Christian Reader, that I charge this man vniustly with impudent facing, behold but these wordes, and say what thou thinkest of them.

It is no time heere to repeat, what is past; by that which is said, thou maist easily iudge, on which side the Fathers stand with full confession of the trueth and their faith. Bragging is boies play, where all performance wanteth. li. 24. [As for their denying that Christ died in his soule, I haue answered before.] With senselesse and shamefull shifts, that Christes soule died not as the body did, that he died not the ordinary death of the soule expressed in the Scriptures, but an extraordinary newly deuised by your selfe; and more then this in summe and substance you haue not said one word. li. 25. [Further where you bring them in many places saying by his bloud onely he redeemed vs, and he suffered onely in his body, they are abused by you woonderfully, not in their wordes but in their meaning.] You would faine change dying into suffering, and haue your Reader imagine, that I say Christes soule suffered nothing at all; but these are now so stale tricks of yours, that euery man reiecteth them as fast as I doe.

And so where you finde any Father affirme that Christ GRIEVED, FEARED OR SORROWED in soule, which are the naturall passions of mans soule common to good and badde, you looke no farder, but presently pronounce that Father maketh euidently with you.

If I haue not abused their wordes in alleaging them, as you confesse, and I assure my selfe, I haue not, but where the Printer perchance hath made some fault, which no man can auoid, (as pag. 81. August. de Trinitate li. 11. the Printer hath set for lib. 13. and some such) then haue I lesse abused their meaning; whereof I make euerie Reader iudge, and so referre my collecting to their censuring, which is no abuse.

               They striuing against Arians and such other heretikes, who would haue Christs Deitie to take part in his sufferings for our redemption; the godly auncient writers doe heereupon say, he suffered and satisfied for vs onely in his body, not excluding the proper and immediate sufferings of his spirit. Let the Authors themselues be viewed, if you thinke 1 affirme of them falsely.] Against whom they write, is not so much, as what they write, and how they confute those heretikes, whom they vndertake. The positions, which they establish out of the Scriptures against such heresies, are most to be regarded; by their proofes you shall see their purpose. To confound those misbeleeuers, that would haue the Godhead of Christ suffer in his flesh, or together with his flesh, the Fathers do soundly oppose, first that the Godhead is inuiolable, impassible, immutable, and such like properties of the Godhead. Secondly that the soule of Christ was subiect to no kind of death, neither of sinne nor damnation, which are not the death of the body, as you

wilfully, but most absurdly would wrest it: and therefore the Godhead was much more free, not onely from this death of the bodie, but from all touch of any kinde of death. Thirdly, to shew what it was in Christ that died, since neither the Deitie nor the soule of Christ could die any kinde of death, they prooue that that which died, was a mortall bodie, buried and raised againe the third day according to the Scriptures. Which accidents and attributes belonging onely to the body of Christ; It is most certaine by the sacred Scriptures that onely the body of Christ was yeelded to death for the redemption of our sinnes. These be the chiefest of their reasons, though they haue many others tending to the same issue, which whether they truely and effectually exclude the death of Christes soule from the worke of our redemption, I leaue it to their iudgement, that shall peruse the former places by me cited; or view the Fathers themselues in their full discourses. And yet a number of these Fathers in the places by me alleaged doe not refute the Arians, but handle professedly other points of our redemption & saluation: as Tertullian in his booke of the Resurrection of the flesh, Chrysostom in his Homily of drunkennesse & of the resurrection, Augustine in his 99. Epistle, & those Chapters of his fourth Booke de Trinitate, which I produced; Gregorie vpon Iob, Bernard in his Sermons to the Souldiers of the Temple, Bede in his Homilies, and Albinus in his questions: these I say doe not there take in hand to refell the Arians, but to deliuer what kinde of death Christ died to free vs from all deaths; And resolue, as we may read, that by one kinde of death, which was the death of Ch

And whether this be true or false, which I auouch, I wish no better triall then the present view of their sayings, whom now you stroke as auncient and godlie writers, but not long since you stript as fond, absurd, the peruerters of Authentike words, and occasioners of grosse errors.

To make Christes soule as impassible as his Godhead, was to make him no man; for mans soule is mutable, & subiect to affections and passions, which God is not. But what is this to the death of Christes soule, if it were an humane soule and not equall with his Deitie? or what heresie doth this confirme, if Tertullian deny Christs soule

It sufficeth then that he died, not as he was God, who can no way be subiect to death, but as he was man hauing one part mortall, which was his bodie; and he died that death, which is common to all, I meane the separating of the soule from the body; not that which is speciall to the wicked, as rei

Will you teach out of these wordes, that Christes soule was certainely mortall, because it was not his diuine substance, and that he died in soule, because he died in his humane nature, as a man, which Tertullian expoundeth to be his flesh; and likewise his death to be the laying downe of his soule, or breathing out of his spirit as the Euangelist describeth it?

I vse to set Ibidem by the side, to shew that it is a new sentence; which if the Printer omit, what wrong is done to the Reader, so long as I adde or alter nothing, as you do? He that will rightly conceiue anothers sense, must compare his words vttered in the same discourse, and belonging to the same matter. You say they are vsed more generally in their owne place, this were somewhat, if your saying were any thing worth; but if they be diuers proofes of one thing, though in place one before another, they all haue one intention, and must haue one construction. Your maner is to make what you list of euery mans wordes, my course is to shew by the wordes precedent and consequent, that I take the right sense of each Writer, not vpon the aduantage of one word wrested from the rest; but out of the whole context, to manifest the true meaning of ech mans speach. If therfore Tertullian had said, Haec mors est carnis & animae, this is the death of soule and flesh, as he saith, Haec vox est carnis & animae, this is the voice of soule and flesh, It had been worth the obiecting; and yet I must tell you, that Tertullian being of opinion, that the soule was traduced with the seed of the body, when he diuideth a man into flesh, soule, and spirit, as heere he doth, by naming all three parts; it may well be doubted, whether he spake of the substance of the soule, which is a spirit; or of the powers of sense and speach, which faile by death

and are often comprised in the name of the soule. But it is cleare by Tertullians owne words, that Christs humane spirit was not dead or forsaken, since he there vrgeth, it was committed to the fathers hands, and consequently was not forsaken, nor left to death, as the rest of Christs manhood was.Tertullianus aduersus Praxeam.

For he laid it downe, and presently died: the spirit remaining in the flesh the flesh could not die at all. The Father then left the flesh of his sonne vnto death, but he tooke Christs spirit into his hands, and so for the sonne to be forsaken, was nothing els but for his flesh to be left to death. This is Tertullians owne exposition of himselfe, howsoeuer you would dally and deceaue both your selfe and your Reader by generall or speciall, before or after.

Impassible is that, which by no possibility can admit any mutation or alteration, by force or affection, which is proper to God alone. So no part of Christs manhood was impassible. But though his soule were passible with diuers affections and impressions, how will it follow from these or any other words in Cyrill, that Christs soule died? Cyrill hath in many words shewed, which I before haue cited, that Christs soule was subiect to all humane and naturall passions or affections but without sinne or corruption; in this sense what doth it helpe you to haue the soule of Christ passible by nature, and not impassible as his godhead is? but you loue to loyter, that thus still repeat one lesson, not only besides your booke, but against your booke.

What cunning then is this, first to shift your hands of that, you can no way prooue, though you still doe and must professe it, and then to clamour at me for drawing the Fathers cleane from their intent and meaning? is this the way to credit your new Creed, by such deuices and stratagemes to intertaine the people of God, least they should see how farre you be slid from the ancient & primatiue Church of Christ? take a while but the thought of a sober man, and this pangue will soone be ouerpast. Did you not vndertake to prooue the death of Christs soule, by Scriptures, which indeed I first and most required; and haue you so donne? looke backe to your miserable mistakings and palpable peruertings of the words of the holy Ghost, and tell vs what one syllable you haue brought sounding that way? are your secrets such that they be no where reuealed in the word of God? must all faith come from thence, and is your faith exempted, that it shall haue no foundation there? are men and Angels accursed, that preach any other Gospell then was deliuered and written by Christs Apostles; and shall you be excused for deuising a new kind of redemption by the death of Christs soule no where witnessed in the Scriptures? you see how easie it were to be eloquent against you in a iust and true cause; but words must not winne the field.

               councels of Hispalis, and others; not doubting the sufficiencie of the Scriptures, but shewing the correspondencie of beleeuing and interpreting the Scriptures in all ages to haue bene the same, which they imbraced and vrged. And in all euennesse of reason, were it better to feede the people with our priuate conceits pretended out of Scripture; or to let such, as be of iudgement, vnderstand, that we frame no faith but such as in the best times hath bene collected and receiued from the grounds of holy Scripture, by the wisest and greatest men in the Church of God? your only example turning and winding the words of the holy Ghost to your owne conceits, will shew, how needfull it is not to permit euery prater to raigne ouer the Scriptures with figures and phrases at his pleasure, and thence to fetch what faith he list. If you so much reuerence the Scriptures, as you report, which were to be wished you would, why deuise you doctrine not expressed in the Scriptures? Why teach you that touching mans redemption, which is no where written in the word of God? Indeed the Scriptures are plaine in this point of all others, what death Christ died for vs, if you did not peruert them against the histories of the Euangelists and testimonies of the Apostles. Omit the description of his death so farely witnessed by the foure Euangelists, what exacter words can we haue then the Apostles, that Christ 
               Coloss. 1. 
               pacisied things in earth, and things in heauen by the bloud of his crosse, and reconciled vs, which were strangers and enemies, in the bodie of his flesh through death. Beleeue what you reade, and what you reade not in the word of God, beleeue not, and this matter is ended: but by Synecdoches without cause you put to the Scriptures, not what you read in them, but what you like best, and by Metaphores and Metonimies, you will take bodie for substance, and flesh for soule. And so where the Apostle auoucheth, that we were reconciled to God, through death in the bodie of (Christs) flesh, you tell vs, we could not be redeemed without the death of Christs soule, and the essence of the paines of the damned suffered by suddaine touches from the immediate hand of God after an extraordinarie manner. If you teach no doctrine but deliuered in the Scriptures, aband on these deuices not expressed in the Scriptures. If you content your selfe with the all sufficient word of God in matters of faith, you must relinquish the death of Christs soule and paines of the damned as no part of our redemption, since there is no such thing contained in the word of God. To me and others that beleeue, the words of Paul are sufficient, declaring this to be the very ground of the Gospell, which hee receiued and deliuered, that Christ 1. Cor. 15. 
               died for our sinnes according to the Scriptures, and that he was buried, and that hee arose the third day according to the Scriptures. Whence by a full and faire coherence I collect, that whatsoeuer died in Christ according to the Scriptures, that was buried and raised the third day according to the Scriptures. But it is more then manifest by the Scriptures, that the soule of Christ was neither buried, nor raised from death the third day, but onely his bodie. It is therefore as plaine to me by the all sufficient word of God, that the soule of Christ died not for our sinnes according to the Scripture.

               not some, nor the most, or best, but euen all, and euery one, both Churches and writers in the world, who are Protestants; & leauing none to vphold the doctrine which I deliuer, but Papists, Iesuites, and Friars, is, as I told you before, and must tell you againe, an egregious lie, so loud and leud, that all the belles in London, if they should iarre together, could not yeeld a more offensiue sound. That euery new writer speaketh of some feares, sorrowes, temptations, or painefull sufferings in the soule of Christ, neuer was, nor is, by me denied, neither doe I in my Sermons take vpon me to determine, what feares, temptations, paines and sorrowes Christ might and did suffer in his soule: onely I added, that we must beware, we diminish not his faith, hope, loue, confidence, obedience, patience, and other gifts and graces of the spirit of God in the soule of Christ, which the Scripture cleerely maketh to be without want, defect, or measure in him. Shunning those sands, I left euery man to his libertie to speake or write of Christes feares

and sorrowes, as farre as any circumstance of holy Scripture did duely enforce: but the death of the soule, the paines of hell, and of the damned, and the second death if any sought to fasten on the soule of Christ, whosoeuer they were, they did it by their owne surmises, they had no warrant for any of those in the word of God, except they tooke the paines of hell figuratiuely for great and intolerable, such as sometimes the Godly in their humane weakenesse thinke and complaine they feele or feare, though they come nothing neere the true paines of hell, which cannot be endured in this mortall life and flesh by the euidence of nature and Scripture. This being my constant course, as my Sermons printed doe apparently witnesse, what folly, what madnesse is this, so egerly and often to chalenge me for contradicting the whole world, when it is but your immoderate greedinesse or giddinesse to thinke, that everie man, who writeth any thing of the feares or sufferings of Christs soule, doth presently teach as you doe, the death of Christs soule and the substance of the most vehement paines of the damned, yea the second death to be a necessary part of our redemtion, which Christ must suffer, before he could ransome vs? To censure mens priuate opinions I take no pleasure, some men otherwise very learned and laborious, haue dipped too deepe in that die, as your selfe proue and pronounce by reiecting and reselling the horror of e

If you may thus renounce and refute the first deuise and spredders (as you thinke them) of your proper and spirituall temptations and torments in the soule of Christ; giue others leaue to receaue them no farder, then they concurre with the Scriptures, and with the primatiue church of God. I find diuers men speake diuersly, but very few and these late, that light on the death of Christs soule, and suddaine touches of the essentiall paines of the damned from the immediate hand of God, which is your fresh and new deuice: yea many that are caried away with the generall termes of Gods wrath and horror of his dreadfull iudgements against sin, no way like the death of Christs soule, and by speciall words debarre all mention of the second death in the sufferings of Christ; and those as well English, as others.

Paules Epistles, as occasion was offered, he fully deliuereth the matter and manner of our redemption to be the only sacrifice of Christs body and bloud; other propitiatory sacrifice for sinne then that he acknowledgeth none, though he ascribe

to the soule as well her sufferings, as her sacrifice. Zanchius in ca. 2. epist. ad Philip. v. 8. 
               All things prepared, which were requisite to offer the sacrifice for our sinnes, behold the Priest with his sacrifice, Christ with his body, the body I say of (him that was) God, who through voluntary obedience to his Father, and most ardent loue to vs, offered himselfe to God for a most sweet smell. And where did he offer himselfe? on the altar of the Crosse: he suffered, and died, and that on the crosse.

And touching the death of the soule, if you teach as Zanchius doth, you will presently finde it is open blasphemie to ascribe to Christ any death of the soule. Zanch

               A triple death (saith he) God threatned to Adam for disobedience; a spirituall death, which was the separation of grace, of the holy Ghost, and of originall righteousnesse from the soule and body of Adam, of which death in the Scriptures there is often mention made. This death Adam died as soone as he did eate. The second was a corporall death, whereby the soule is seuered from the bodie. To this Adam was presently (vpon his eating) made subiect; though he did not straightwayes actually die. The third is euerlasting death, which is knowen to all, & of this death Adam was forthwith made guiltie. This triple death was the punishment of his disobedience. And vpon like occasion comparing the death of the soule and of the bodie, he saith. Ibidem in ca. 2. epist. ad ephes. vers. 5. 
               There is a triple death; spirituall, (of the spirit or soule) corporall, knowen to all men; and the third is that eternall death pertaining to bodie and soule, wherewith all the wicked shall be punished in hell. These all God threatned to Adam, when he said, what hower soeuer thou shalt eate, &c. thou shalt die the death. For he straightway died in spirit (or soule); he incurred also the death of the bodie, because he became mortall; and was made guiltie of eternall death. 
               Ibid. 
               We haue rightly said death to bee the priuation of life, and so of all the actions of life consisting in the separation of bodie and soule. The like we must say of the spirituall life and death. The spirituall life is a certaine spirituall and diuine force, whereby we are mooued to spirituall and diuine actions by the presence of the holy Ghost dwelling

in vs. The holy Ghost regenerating vs in this spirituall life is as it were the soule thereof. And holy and spirituall thoughts, holy desires, holy actions both inward and outward are the operations of this spirituall life. What then is the death of the spirit? euen the priuation of the spirituall life, and consequently of all spirituall and good actions in a man destitute of the presence of the holy Ghost, which should quicken him, comming from sinne, and for sinne. 
               Ibidem. 
               What strength hath a man dead in bodie to the actions of this life? so neither can he, that is dead in spirit (or soule), do any workes of the spirituall life. Heere is a full and true description of the death of the spirit or soule of man, which if you and your friends dare attribute to Christ; then doth Zanchius fauour the death of Christs soule: but if euery peece hereof applied to Christ be euident heresie and infidelitie, then did Zanchius no way defend the death of Christes soule to be any part of our redemption; and as for the second death, he acknowledgeth none, but that which is eternall, and inflicted in hell on all the wicked.
            Much more might be brought to like effect, shewing the true and onely meane and matter of our redemption and reconciliation to be the only body and bloud of Christ yeelded vnto death for the ransome of our sinnes; but I should make a new volume, if I should stand thereon. It may suffice in the iudgement of any reasonable man to refute the slaunderous mouth of this most insolent prater, that I professe, I mislike nothing the writings and resolutions of all these learned Protestants, for as much as I haue seene and read of them, (which is as much as I could get) touching our redemption by the death of Christ; but teach the same that they taught, and in my priuate moderation could beare the words of many others, (those onely excepted who elude the plainenesse of the Scriptures, with the finenesse of their new deuices), were it not, that such hoblers, as this is, vpon such occasions will neuer leaue their fresh inuenting new meanes and causes of our redemption, till they be they know not where. Taking it therefore to be no euill way, when men of great wits and gifts begin to turne to their owne deuices, to see what the learned and auncient lights of Christes Church beleeued and deriued from the sacred Scriptures in those very points of trueth and our saluation; I haue chosen rather to shew thee, Christian Reader, the generall and continuall consent of religious and reuerend antiquitie; then to muster mens names of latter times, and by disgracing or comparing their labours or learnings, to set any man, or Church in fire. If so many learned and auncient fathers displease happilie some in respect of their priuate contrarie conceits, I haue done my duety to declare the trueth, and shewed my desire of peace, whiles I neuer ment, nor can yet bee drawen to impeach any mans name or credit, howsoeuer I thinke, that some of them swarue from the exact rule and sense of holy Scriptures in some few points, as well of doctrine as of discipline.
         
         
            
            THE SECOND PART. WHAT IS MEANT BY THIS IN THE CREED, THAT Christ descended to HADES, or Hell.
            
            I Shall not need (good Christian Reader) to spend much time or paines in this question. An article of the Creed since it is, That Christ descended into Hell; and the same deriued from the Scriptures, confessed by all Antiquitie, and confirmed by authoritie of this whole Realme, as well in the booke of Common prayer, as in the Articles of Religion ratified by Prince and Parliament, it is not for an English man directly to dispute against it; howsoeuer, retaining the words, many doubt or denie the sense thereof. I may be the shorter, for that the Refuter insisteth onely on foure reasons against the descent of Christ to the place of the damned, which our English Creed calleth Hell; and the rest, which he bringeth, is like his former labor, that is, is nothing but a bolde pronouncing of his owne conceits, and a false misconstruing of other mens sayings. His first reason is.

               If there be a good and sound generall reason in Christian faith, that Christes soule leauing his bodie, ascended vp to heauen, and there remained till his resurrection; and if there be no speciall reason of authoritie to the contrariè, that his soule now descended, th

                  n surely euerie good Christian ought to beleeue, that his soule ascended to heauen, and descended not locally into hell. But both these former parts are most true.] Not one of these parts is true, and were they (as they are not) most true; yet conclude they not your purpose. That Christes soule leauing his bodie ascended vp to heauen, is more than any Scripture expresly auoucheth. The order of our Creed leadeth vs to beleeue, that Christ rose the third day from the dead before he ascended to heauen. That he was in Paradise the same day that he died, his owne words to the penitent thiefe, This day shalt thou be with me in Paradise, may proue, if we admit them to be spoken of Christes soule and not of his Deitie, as Saint Austen and others expound them: but that Christes soule departing from his bodie, and returning to the same againe, diuerted no whither, nor spoiled powers and principalities, nor made an open shew of them, triumphing ouer them, for this there is neither good reason in the Christian faith, nor warrant in the word of God, but onely your couragious assuming any thing that may seeme to support your cause. On the other side, what reasons there are, generall or speciall, for Christes descent to hell, though you make light of them, the Church of Christ from the beginning hath receiued and professed them, not from the mouthes of men, but from the witnesse of holy Scripture, howsoeuer you turne and winde the words of the Holie Ghost to fit them to your appetite. And what so great need is there of speciall reasons of authoritie to the contrarie? Will not generall testimonies of the Scriptures serue to proue a trueth, except the speciall circumstances of time, and place, and maner be therewithall expressed.

               The analogie of faith requireth, that the head should be there where the members were, and where they remaine till their resurrection, that there he tarie till his resurrection. It seemeth also these texts will prooue it; Where I am, there also shall my seruant be. I will, that where I am, there they also shall be with me.] Did you speake of the perpetuall abode of the head and members in one and the same place of ioy and blisse at Gods appointed time, Your words had some dependance on Christes promise, saying; Iohn 12. 
               Where I am, there also shall my seruants be: but this speech of Christes is restrained to a certaine time, in which it shall be verified, as appeareth by that he sayd, Iohn 14. 
               I goe to prepare you a place, I will come againe, and receiue you vnto my selfe, that where I am, there also you may be. At his next comming he will take vs vnto himselfe, and then shall we be euer with the Lord. This is the time, when his promise shall be performed. And though the Saints dissolued are now with Christ, that is, not only receiued to rest and ioy in Christ, but also where the glory of Christ sitting at the right hand of his Father continually shineth to them, and on them with full assurance of euerlasting glory prepared for them; yet no analogie of faith, nor any words by you brought, do proue all the Saints to haue their bodies now in heauen, because Christ hath his there; or that the soules of the iust were after the speaking of these words, alwayes here on earth, where Christ was; or that all the Saints rose with him, as some did; or that when, and where Christ appeared after his resurrection, all his Saints must or did appeare with him. Much lesse is there any sequele from either, that all the soules of the righteous must or did accompanie Christes soule going to Paradise, and comming thence; so that he could not descend to Hell to triumph ouer Satan and all the power of darkenesse, but the spirits of the iust deceased must leaue Paradise, and go thither with him.

If it be so firme a promise, as you pretend, then Dauid, as well as the rest, must locally accompanie Christ whithersoeuer he went, and consequently ascend to heauen with him; which Peter vtterly denieth. And all the Fathers of Christs church had little vnderstanding of Christs words, when they generally denied, that the soules of the Saints are yet in the same place of glory where Christ is.

            Neither doe I find any Scriptures, that allow the Saints deceased the same place of glory, where Christ now is at the right hand of God in the highest heauens, till the last day come.

               Paradise; Whence we may rightly collect, that Paradise is in the third heauen. Now what number of heauens the Scripture deliuereth, is not so certaine as some men suppose. We find the whole region of the aire to be called Heauen, as where Christ nameth the Matt. 8. & 13 
               byrds of heauen, and the

               will multiply thy seed, as the starres of heauen. The third heauen, if I be not deceaued, the Scripture maketh to be the originall and proper habitation of Angels, where they were first placed, and whence they fell, that are now called Diuels. Iudae epist. vers. 6. 
               The Angels which kept not their originall, saith Iude, but left

                THEIR PROPER HABITATION, hath Godreserued in euer lasting chaines vnder darkenesse vnto the iudgement of the great day. In this celestiall Paradise, which at first was the proper mansion of Angels, as the Scripture obserueth, there was not only place for sinne, and danger of falling, as we find by experience of the reprobate angels, but after this was left an higher degree of perfection, and a greater increase of glory; as we perceaue in the elect Angels, who were confirmed in goodnesse, and aduanced to the presence of Gods throne, there to behold the face of God in the proper place of his sanctity and maiesty. Of this third heauen the booke of Iob saith; God 
               Iob. 15. 
               found no stedfastnesse in his Saints, yea the heauens are not cleane in his sight, since there he found sinne in those transgressing Angels which left their proper habitation, and pressed with pride and disobedience to the throne of God. This fault and fall the Prophet resembleth, when he saith, Esa 14. 
               How art thou fallen from heauen, ô Lucifer? Thou saidst in thine heart, I will ascend aboue the higth of the clouds, and I wilbe like the most high. * The last or highest heauen the Scripture nameth the Seat, throne, or habitation of God: which is not only holy, as whereinto Reuel. 21. 
               no vncleane thing shall enter, but is aboue all other heauens, and often called the heauen of heauens. In this is the presence of Gods throne, that is, a perpetuall and plaine reuelation of his diuine glory and maiesty, which the elect Angels alwaies behold. And heere is not only the fulnesse of

That the soules of the faithfull before the comming of Christ were in Abrahams bosome our Sauiour first deliuered, and no father, that I know, departeth from it; but where Abrahams bosome was, whether in earth or elsewhere, and whether it were a skirt of hell or no, till Christ transferred them thence to Paradise; of this some fathers diuersely thinke, and diuersely speake.

That Christ after death went to the place, where the faithfull were in expectation and desire of his comming to redeeine the world; the Fathers affirme; but that he went no whither else, or that hec went not to the place of the damned as well to discharge and release his members thence, that is from all feare and daunger thereof, as to destroy the power of the diuell ouer all his, and to triumph ouer the force and furie of Satan in his owne person, that euery knee of things vnder the earth should bow to him, as well as of things in heauen and earth, in this you vtterly mistake the consent of the Fathers, which you so much talke of; and shew that you neuer came neere the reading of them, howsoeuer you presume to affirme what you list, of them. And least I should carie the Reader without cause to rest on my word, as you would haue him doe on yours, he shall heare the Fathers speake their owne mindes, and so the better iudge of your abusing them.

            There should be no end of alleaging, if I should cite all, that speake to this purpose. These be auncient and sufficient to prooue this refuter a fabler, in affirming that the Fathers with one voice auouch Christ went no whither but where his faithfull and holy seruants were, whom the Fathers did not thinke to be in the torments of hell, nor in the place of the damned; and to shew that I teach none other sense of the Creed, then all these Fathers, and infinit others did before me. Neither can they be shifted off, as this Trifler vseth to decline them, who name Hades, that they ment the world of soules, which might be as well in heauen, or paradise, as in hell: since they speake of Christes descent after death to that place, where there was euerlasting darknesse, and amazednesse of diuels, bondage and punishment of sinners, deliuerance from destruction, an happie and mightie conquest ouer enemies, with such like circumstances, which by no meanes can agree either to Paradise or heauen, or to any other place but onely to hell, where these things are found, and no where else.
            And if new writers may be regarded, I could bring as many or moe of them of great learning and good iudgement confessing and allowing this exposition of the Creede which I follow, (that Christ descended into Hell to destroy Satans power and force ouer his, and to free them all from comming thither) as concurrent and consonant with the sacred Scriptures; and namely refelling your fansie, that Christ went no whither but where his faithfull and holy seruants were. The very Catechisme which you would seeme so much to respect, as if it were the publicke and authorised doctrine of this Realme, maketh it needfull to beleeue, that Catechism. Nowelli Gracolat. pag. 292. 
               as Christs body was (laid) in the bowels of the earth, so his soule separated from his body descended ad inferos, to the places (or spirits) below, (that is, to hell) and with all the force and efficacie of his death so pearced vnto the dead, at

The Catechisme treating of Christs descent to hell mentioned in the Creed, deliuereth this to be the sense thereof, that Christes soule separated from his body descendit ad inferos, descended vnto hell. And least we should doubt what he meaneth by inferi, he putteth inferos as a degree lower & farder then the dead, in saying Penetrauit ad mortuos, at

maketh Satan to be Princeps inferorum, the Prince of hell; Who is no chiefe ruler either in heauen or Paradise, but onlie in hell. Againe he resolueth, that together with the soule of Christ came the power & force of Christs death as well to the faithfull, which were saued by him, as to the rest iustly condemned for their vnbeliefe; and that the Diuell himselfe saw all the power of darckenesse afflicted and oppressed by Christ. More then this I do not teach; & so much the catechisme auoucheth to be part of the Christian faith, and the meaning of that article in the Creed, Christ descended into hell.

               To the words of Christ vttered to the thiefe, this daie shalt thou be with me in Paradise, I answere; they hinder not this cause. For Christ was in Paradise with the thiefe according to his diuinity, in the graue according to his body, in hell according to his soule. Howbeit there is no certaintie, how long Christ staied in hell: not long it seemeth; so that he might in soule that verie day returne from hell, and after a glorious sort enter Paradise with the thiefe. Neither hath that any more strength, that Christ commended his soule into his Fathers handes. For the soule of Christ was still in his Fathers hands, though he descended into hell. This descent was voide of forrow and shame to Christ. Where they say, there was no need of this descent, they run backe to the beginning: for how should it be needlesse, which the Scripture pronounceth Christ did, and we confesse in our Creed? We iudge it therefore needfull; first for the reprobate, that they might know he was now come, of whose comming they had so often heard, but neglected it with great contempt. Againe, Satan was perfectly to know, that this Christ whom he had tempted in the desart, and deliuered to death by the

               As Christ by his death conflicted with the enemy on the gibbet of the crosse, and ouercame him; so by his glorious descent to hell, resurrection, and ascension to heauen he executed the triumph, erecting as a monument of his victorie the ensigne of his crosse.

O death, I will be thy death; and thy destruction, O hell. And this his victory he would in a certaine maner shew vnto the diuell, that he might strike perpetuall terrors into the diuell, and take from vs all feare of (Satans) tyrannie.

There euerlasting fire did abide to vs all, that being deliuered to death by the sinne of Adam, we might in the last iudgement be deliuered to punishment and perpetuall sire.

Of the article of Christs descent to hel, I am not ignorant how diuersly learned men doe thinke. It is somewhat obscure indeed and subiect to many disputations, but yet no godly man vpon that occasion will resist or offer force to the Apostles words, (thou wilt not leaue my soule in hell) but will desire of God the vnderstanding therof, and in the meane time with a single faith cleaue to the word of trueth, although he can not cleerely perceaue the maner how that was performed.

               simply as the words sound; and let vs resolue, that the Sonne of God truely descended to hell to deliuer vs from hell, to which we were condemned for sinne in Adam; and from the power and tyrannie of the diuell, by which we were held captiue. Of which effect and fruit of Christs descent the Fathers speake; (as) Ierom, Christ descended to hell that we might ascend to heauen. And Fulgentius, The man which God assumed, descended thither, whither man separated from God by defert of sinne fell, that is to hell, where the soule of a sinner vsed to be

tormented. And Augustine. Dying for thee, I descended to hell to bring thee to Paradise; Tartara adij, vt tu in caelo regnares; I went to the place of the damned, that thou mightest raigne in heauen. Georgius Mylius in his explication of the Augustane confession.Mylius in Augustanae confessionis explicatione articulo 3. de Christo. 
               The true and proper sense of this Article is, that no metaphoricall, but a reall descent of Christ to hell must be vnderstood, whereby he descended to the lower parts of the earth, Eph. 4. vers. 9. Et ipsas Damnatorum sedes adijt; and went to the very place of the damned. The second point is, that this Article is no part of his passion and humiliation, but of his victorie and triumph.

               we aduise this matter not to be disputed, but this Article (of Christs descent to hell) to be most simply beleeued and taught. It ought to suffice vs, if we know, that Christ descended into hell, destroied hell to all beleeuers, and by him (or his descent thither) we were taken out of the power of death and Satan, from euerlasting damnation, and euen out of the iawes of hell. The maner how this was done, let vs not curiously search, but referre the (exact) knowledge heereof to an other worlde, where not onely this mysterie, but many others simply beleeued of vs in this life, shall be reuealed, which passe the reach of our blinde reason.
            
            And where some would so moderate this Article, as if it ment no more but that the force and effect of Christes death was manifested as well to the damned to exclude them from all hope, as to the faithfull to encrease their comfort; Luther sharpely, but truely, thus refuteth that fansie. Thou wilt not leaue my soule in hell. 
               Lutherus in Psal. 16. 
               The sense (heereof) is most plaine, so plentifully and diligently deliuered by the Apostles. But euen here haue men presuming all things of their wittes, begun to dispute, whether Christ were in hell as touching his soule, and the substance thereof, and what this meaneth, that he was in hell. And a great number haue dared to contradict the spirit (of God) that Christs soule was not in hell but by effect: being for sooth handsome glozers of the word of God; Thou wilt not leaue my soule, that is, the effect of my soule, in hell: Christ descended to hell, that is, he effected somewhat in hell: but despising these friuolous and impious trifles, let vs simply vnderstand the wordes of the Prophet, as they are simply spoken; and if we can not vnderstand them, let vs faithfully beleeue them. Greater is the authoritie of this Scripture, then the capacitie of all mens wittes, as Augustine saith. For the soule of Christ according to her substance truely descended to hell. To like purpose might exceeding many new writers be brought, all confessing the descent of Christes soule to the very place of the damned and of the diuels, that the trueth, force and glory of his humane soule might appeere as well to the reprobate angels and spirits vnder earth, as to the elect aboue the earth; God making the humane nature of his Sonne this recompence, that as he was despised and reproched by Satan in his instruments, so he should be adored and feared euen of all the powers of darckenesse, and wholy despose of them and their kingdome: but these may suffice the sober Reader to let him see, that I deliuer none other sense of that Article, then hath beene formerly receaued in the church of Christ with full consent, and to this day is continued in the same by many great and graue Diuines, whose iudgements I need not be ashamed to follow; though I confesse I depend not on their wordes farder then they conforme their writings to the word of God, which in this case I take to be plaine enough howsoeuer some quarrell be made to the diuers significations of Sheol and Hades, which is as easily done in other Articles of the Creed, as in this; if it were the part of a Christian to wrangle with euerie worde, that hath sundry senses or vses in the holy Scriptures.

But the soules of the faithfull are alwaies in the hand of God, whiles heere they are protected by him, and after this life receaued in rest, though they come not, as yet to be inuested with the fulnesse of heauenly glory. Yea the words properly pertaining to our Sauiours person, and condition after death, Psal 15. 
               `Thou wilt not leaue (or forsake) my soule in hell, doe shew that Christs soule was then in Gods hands, and compassed round with the power and glory of God, when hell and Satan trembled at his presence, and were both vanquished and spoiled by him. Your adding, that this sentence may be fitly applied to Christ, prooueth nothing. For though I haue no doubt but Christs soule was with farre greater honour and fauour, ioy and blisse receaued into the hands of God, to whom it was committed, then the soules of all his Saints: yet that doth not prooue his present entraunce after death into the glory of heauen, and continuance in the same, except you will say that at his resurrection, and till his Ascension his soule was out of his Fathers hands, because during that time it was on earth, and not in heauen; which were a strange position in diuinity. Sapient. 3. 
               The soules of the righteous (were) in the hands of God long before Christs comming, as the wise man witnesseth; and yet were they not in the glory of heauen, but in Abrahams bosome, as our Sauiour teacheth. And so the wise man expoundethLucae 16. himselfe, adding; Sap. 3 vers. 3. & 7. 
               No torment shall touch them, they are in peace, and in the time of their visitation they shall shine: reseruing them to a time appointed, when glory shalbe reuealed on them, though in the meane whiles their spirits were kept in rest and ioy vnder the mighty hand of God.

Happily he first caried the beleeuing Thiefe to Paradise, before he descended to hell. Damascen is of Austens mind. Damasc. in homilia de sancto sublato. 
               The same (Christ) is adored in heauen as God together with the Father and with the holy Ghost, and he as man lay in the Sepulchre with his body, and abode in hell with his soule, and gaue entrance to the thiefe into Paradise, his diuinity, which cannot be comprehended in any place, euery where accompanying him. And so is Euthymius. Euthymius in 23. ca. Lucae.

But admit the words to be ment of Christs humane soule, what reason call you this? Christs soule was in Paradise that very day that he died: ergo neither that day, nor any day els before his resurrection, his soul did or could descend to hell.

Wherein I leaue the Reader to his discretion, which of those two expositions he will embrace. Neither did I in this anouch more then Austen himselfe els where is content to yeeld. For reasoning against Felicianus the Arrian, he saith August. contra Felicianum ca. 15. 
               Seddicet aliquis, deitatis hanc, non animae Christi credimus vocem. But some will say we beleeue this (to day shalt thou be with me in Paradise) was the voice of Christs deity, and not of his soule. To which part then of the thiefe doe we take this promise was made? this day, saith Christ to the thiefe, shalt thou be with me in Paradise, whose body the common death had inclosed vntill the resurrection to come. It was then the soule of the thiefe to which Christ promised and performed this: Whereupon he concludeth Si igitur mortuo corpore ad Paradisum anima mox vocatur, quemquamne adhuc tam impium credimus, qui dicere audeat, quoniam anima seruatoris nostritriduo illo corporeae mortis apud inferos custodiae mancipetur? If then the body (of the thiefe) dying, (his) soule were presently called to Paradise, shall we thinke any man so wicked as to dare say; that the soule of our Sauiour during the three dayes, that his bodie lay dead, was held in the custodie of hell? So that though S. Austen acknowledge the other sense of Christes diuine presence in Paradise to be multo expeditior, & ab ijs omnibus ambiguitatibus liber, farre the easier and freer from all obiections; yet he doth not endure, that any man should so fasten the soule of Christ to hell for the time of his death, that Christ might not thence depart and be in Paradise, when pleased him, as well as the Thiefe, but must stay in hell, as if he were kept in custodie.

If so generall and strange a worke (as to haue all their soules out of Paradise and hell ioyned to their bodies, and their persons aliue caught vp to the iudgement seate of Christ in the aire) shall be wrought in all the sonnes of men elect and reprobate at an instant; what incredible thing is this, except to an infidell, that he which made heauen and earth with a word, should in as short time, as he saw cause, shew his humane soule to the powers of darknesse in the midst of their kingdome, and take all strength and rule from them, and lead them captiue at his pleasure? And therefore neuer calculate so curiously the distance or passage from Paradise to hell; if these things were not marueilous in mans eies, they were not meet workes for the Sonne of God; but examine soberly, whether the Scripture auouch any such presence of Christes soule in hell, and conquest ouer hell. And if that appeare, teach men to leaue the rest to the mightie hand of God; which brought the soule of his Sonne thither, in what time and maner he thought good, and might best make for his glory.

               I adde that which is cleere and certaine: yea that which your selfe rightly beleeueth and professeth with vs, though against the opinion of the Fathers, that the soules of the holie Patriarks dead before Christ were not beneath, but aboue; Not in Limbo, but with God in peace, ioy and blisse, euen in Paradise that is heauen.] Your certainties be your owne ouerhastie coniectures, neither well vnderstanding your selfe, nor others. In the places,

which you quote out of my Sermons, I say as Christ himselfe deliuered that the iust deceased were in Abrahams bosome, which the wise man calleth the hand ofOf Abrahams bosome. God: And that Abrahams bosome was vpward farre aboue hell, as appeareth by the wordes of our Sauiour; more I durst not determine. Neither did I make Abrahams bosome to be Paradise or Heauen, I had no warrant so to doe; but the place whither the soule of the thiefe was caried the day of his death, Christ calleth Paradise, which the Apostle seemeth to make a part of the third heauen. And heere were the soules of the righteous after Christes death, except you thinke that Paradise was prouided only for the penitent thiefe, which S. Austen counteth a great Epist. 9

But that the soules of the Patriarks were in heauen, that is in the glorie of gods kingdome, before the death and comming of Christ, I haue no such wordes in any of the pages which you produce. I vse not of things vnknowen to giue hastie iudgement, I leaue it to God, who hath many places of abode in his house, and desire not to search into his secrets vnreuealed in this life.

               Hence I conclude that Christes soule after his death ascended indeed, and descended not downward beneath vs heere. I heare your conclusion, but I see no premises from which you may iustly inferre so much. For though the soule of Christ might ascend after death, if we respect situation of place, in comparison of the earth; yet because the Scriptures reckon no ascending but into the glorie of heauen, (otherwise the diuels that Ephes. 2. 
               rule in the aire, should ascend, and the damned that come to iudgement, shall ascend); the Christian faith doth not say that Christ ascended before he descended. And the apostle exactly obseruing the relation and application of those two wordes vnto Christ, saith his descending was the first of the twaine, that was performed. Ephes 4. 
               This saith he, that (Christ) ascended, what is it but that he first descended into the lower parts of the earth? Otherwise if you be disposed to play with the ascending and descending of Christes person, bodie, or soule before or after death, you may finde vs many descents and ascents besides the two that are mentioned in our Creed. The Nicene Creed saith of his person, that for vs and our saluation he descended from heauen, and was incarnate by the holy Ghost of the virgine Marie; and of himselfe he saith; Iohn 6. 
               I am the liuing bread, which descended from heauen. Then after his death his soule ascended as you say, and so must descend againe before his body could be restored to life. Now the apostle saith; Christ 
               Ephes. 4. 
               descended into the lower parts of the earth, and likewise must thence ascend before his resurrection. And lastly after forty daies he ascended body and soule aboue all the heauens. Heere are sixe descents and ascents, if you list to controle the Creed; but the Christian faith following the apostle, noteth onely two, his descending to hell; or to the lower parts of the earth, and his ascending aboue all heauens; which were two materiall parts of our saluation after he tooke flesh, and profitable for vs to know. And though you stifly stand on this, that Christes soule descended not downeward beneath vs heere; Yet against the Creed, and the apostles wordes, that Christ descended to hell, and to the lower parts of the earth, no wise man will admit either your opinion or assertion, howsoeuer you thinke you can make a florish with Dauids words, who saith he was Psal. 139. 
               fashioned beneath in the earth: of which we will speake when we come to examine the force of the apostles wordes.

Touching which thus I say, without expresse and euident Scripture there is in the world no sound nor meet authoritie to disprooue our former reason or conclusion.] Your reasons raked out of the Scripture are such, that no man need to regard; they are miserable mistakings and palpable misapplyings of the Scriptures intending no such thing as you imagine; and for the contrarie they are plaine enough, and such as haue been receaued and reuerenced by all Christendom without exception, till you and some others in our age started vp with figures and

And how come you now to be so strickt in this second question, that without expresse and euident Scripture, against which you cannot so much wrangle, you will yeeld to nothing; who were so licentious in the former, that without all Scripture, and against the Scripture, you maintained a new kind of redemption by the death of Christs soule, and his su

He spoiled powers, and principalities, and made an open shew of them, leading them (as captiues) in a triumph by the vertue of his crosse, by which he had purged sinnes, and appeased the iustice of God. Could he not haue done this, without any such descent of his soule? He could, but he would be so farre humbled, that his soule should descend into that most darke and wretched place, though not there to suffer any thing, but to beginne thence his triumph ouer the power of the Diuell. And this opinion of the Fathers I dare not condemne, since it is not repugnant to the sacred Scriptures, and hath likely reasons. The consent of the Fathers when it is not contrary to the holy Scriptures hath great weight with me. There is as much difference betwixt this mans modestie and yours, as there is betweene his learning and yours. He durst not condemne the iudgement of the Fathers, because it had probable grounds, and was no way contrary to the Scriptures: you auouch they had no shew of reason from any place of Scripture. But your reward will be according: for where he is with all, and euen by your selfe reputed a sound and learned Writer; no man will take you but for an vnsound and vnlearned Boaster.

And since Christs conception, though it be an Article of our faith, yet was wrought by the holy Ghost, not as Dauids was, neither was Christs body fashioned by degrees; first in seed, then in bloud, after in flesh, as Dauid confesseth his was, but after a more strange and wonderfull manner, as the Fathers both Greeke and Latin teach; and during the time of his conception, Christ did not lead captiuity captiue; his mothers wombe can no way pertaine to the Apostles purpose in this place, howsoeuer you or some others would faine shew their deuices in making the Apostle hunt after strange and obscure metaphors out of Dauids words once vsed for good manners sake.
            
               Treat. pag. 141. 
               It seemes to me a very plaine Hebraisme, expressing tachijoth erets: which words are no where found for hell; for the graue they are found. Like to this is erets tachtith (Ezechiel. 31) where the seuerall circumstances doe plainly teach that the graue only is there ment, and the condition of death, the same sense manifestly hath another Hebrew phrase very like to this: Sheol tachijah (psal: 86) and Sheol tachath: (Esa: 14) where though many thinke hell is signified; yet surely the circumstances doe conuince that the graue only is there ment. this do I iudge, that the descēding of Christ to the lower parts of the earth may be taken truly, plainly, & as is agreeable to the Hebrew phrase, whence surely this Greeke phrase ariseth,

namely for Christs humiliation vnto the graue. Heere is your third exposition of the Apostles words, which you call a plaine demonstration, that this place speaketh neuer a word of hell, nor of Christs descending thither, but only of his graue: and if these proud and vaine bragges may goe for proofes, you will prooue any thing; but you must come backe for all this hast, and learne that trueth is not so lightly put from her holdfast, as you suppose. For setting aside your hypallages and metaphors, which are nothing to the meaning of the Apostle in this place, the ground which heere you lay, that erets tachtith, the lowest earth, and Sheol tachtijah, the lower Sheol are no where vsed for hell, but euery where for the graue, is false and full of rash resolution, directly repugnant to the trueth of the Scriptures, and the circumstances of those places, to which you appeale. And least the Reader should thinke I speake altogether out of mine owne head peremptorily and presumptuously, as you doe; he shall heare the iudgement of some of the eldest Rabbins, and others well learned in the Hebrew tongue touching these phrases, and then we will examine the circumstanccs of the texts themselues. And because I would make but one labour of manie; and the meaning of Sheoltachtijah; the lower sheol and erets tachtith the lower earth cannot well be discerned vntill we see what sheol naturally and truely signifieth, I will fir

            Sheol properly signifieth the pitts or places vnder earth where the bodies or soules of the dead are receaued to corruption or destruction, so called for that they are neuer satisfied but alwaies expect more, euer since man was adiudged to death for sin: and though in the great conceit of your owne skill you tell me, that my Defenc. pag. 152. li. 14. 
               not considering (or not caring for) the vse and manner of the Hebrew tongue causeth my mistaking as in these places, so likewise in all, or most of the rest, and causeth mine error in this maine question; Yet I hope I shall let the Reader see in the end, that proud ignorance leadeth you so rashly to resolue as you doe both of the words and places in question, and likewise of my positions.

            Neither want these Iewes that auouch Sheol, and specially the nether most Sheol to be below in the deepe of the earth, to be opposite to heauen, & to be the place of punishment for the wicked after their deaths, warrant in the sacred Scriptures to vphold these assertions. For though Sheol extend to any place vnder earth, that by Gods ordinance requireth or receaueth the bodies or soules of the dead, & in that respect to the godly it can be no more then the graue, & the losse of all things in this life consequent to the graue; & in that sense we must interprete Sheol, when it is applied to the bodies or persons of the Saints, whose soules are in rest and blisse with God, & not vnder the earth, where Sheol is: yet the ful force of that word whē it is threatned to any, or affirmed of the wicked, noteth the pit of destructiō for their soules, aswel as of corruption for their bodies, & the consequents of either; & the nethermost Sheol expressely designeth

the place of torment appointed for sinners, that die out of Gods fauour, & receaue the iust reward of their vnrighteousnesse. Prou. 15. 
               The way of life, saith Salomon, is aboue to him that knoweth to decline from Sheol, that is below. Where first it is euident, that asvers. 24. heauen is aboue, in which is true and eternall life; so Sheol, which is the pit of death for bodie and soule, is below vs, which must needes be in the earth vnder vs. This partition of celestiall, terrestriall and infernall persons and places the Apostle warranteth by this authoritie, when he saith.

               nd, wee cannot choose but see, that Sheol is not onely deepe, but the deepest place in the world; euen as heauen is the highest. To compare the wisedome of God with the graue, which is sixe foote deepe, or not so much, were most ridiculous, since we commonly digge to that depth and deeper vpon diuers occasions. And therefore Sheol is the deepest place in the earth, to which no man liuing euer pearced, to make report of the deepenesse of it. Moses confirmeth the same when he saith; Deut. 32. 
               sire shall burne to the lower Sheol, and shall eate through the earth, and inflame the foundations of the hils.
            
            As the situation of Sheol is below vnder the earth, that is in the bottome of the earth, so is it a place threatned to the soules, not onely to the bodies of the wicked, though at length it shall receaue both. Dauid putting a difference betwixt himselfe and the wicked, saith, Psal 49. 
               Like sheepe shall they be laid in Sheol, but God will red

                  eme my soule from the hand of Sheol. Dauid neuer drempt that his soule should bee in the graue, nor that the soules of the wicked should there be laid: much lesse that his bodie should be freed from the graue, more then the bodies of such as knew no God at all. Sheol then here, as in sundry other parts of Scripture, signifieth somewhat, from which the godly shalbe saued, and whereto the wicked shalbe euerlastingly adiudged. But that is not the graue, which is common to all men, good and bad. It was therefore the Sheol of soules from which Dauid hoped to be deliuered, and which the wicked shall not auoyd: And so are his very words.The Lord will deliuer my soule from
               Psal. 49. v. 15. 
               the power of Sheol. Againe the full reward of wickednesse is not the graue whereto the godly come as well as the godlesse. But Sheol is threatned in the Scriptures as the full and finall wages of all impietie, neither is there any other note or name sor hell, except metaphoricall throughout the Old Testament. Wherefore when Dauid saith, Psal. 9 v. 17. 
               sinners shall be turned to Sheol, and all nations that forget God; he doth not threaten them with that, which is generall to all Gods children, but with that, which is peculiar to all Gods enemies, which must needes be hell, and not the graue. And so much Caluine himselfe, who otherwise ouermuch vrgeth the right sense of Sheol to be the graue, confesleth to be the true meaning of this place."

               which was ambiguous, I doubted not to translate by the name of hell. For though it displease me not, that others translate it the graue, yet it is certaine, that somewhat heere is noted by the Prophet besides the common death. Otherwise he should say nothing of the wicked, that should not indifferently agree to all the faithfull. Obserue this rule, which indeed is true, that when the Scriptures threaten the wicked with Sheol, they meane not the graue, which is common to all the godly; but that Sheol, which is appointed for the wicked,

from which the faithfull shall be freed, and you may spare all your figures and phrases, wherewith you loade both your selfe and your Reader in this place to no purpose. For there is a Sheol, as Salomon noteth, that shall Prou. 1. v. 12. 
               swallow men aliue and whole, which cannot be the graue, where there lyeth but one part of man and that after his death. And since the Scripture in exact tearmes maketh a lower Sheol, which cannot be but in comparison of an higher, with what face can you elude the lower Sheol to be nothing but the graue, whereas one and the same thing cannot bee by any meanes both lower and higher in respect of it selfe? And therefore howsoeuer you could shuffle with the name of Sheol, without addition against both learning and trueth; yet to auouch the lower Sheol to be onely the graue, is onely a point of your accustomed impudencie, which regardeth neither reason nor sense, so long as you may ourface all with your priuate and witlesse fansie.
            Come now to the place of Esaie the fourteenth, where you so prem
                  •…
               rily pronounce, that whatsoeuer others thinke, the circumstances doe conuince the graue onely is there ment; and see your owne follie, if pride haue not so closed your eyes, that you can discerne nothing besides your owne dreames. In the wordes of Esaie are sundrie circumstances, which plainely prooue Sheol there not to be taken for the graue onely. The first is the situation of Sheol, which the Prophet there saith is below. Esai. 14. v. 9. 
               Sheol from below is stirred to meete thee; not meaning the dead should be then raised to life, but the Ghostes below should be mooued and affected with the suddaine fall of that mightie tyrant. It is also there opposed to heauen, as the lowest place to the highest; for where through pride the king of Babylon said in his heart, 
               vers. 13. 
               I will ascend to heauen, and exalt my throne aboue the starres of God; the Prophet replieth, vers. 15. 
               thou shalt be thrust downe to Sheol, to the sides of the lake. Secondly there are in that place attributed to them in Sheol remembrance, admirance, irrision, and speach, which by no meanes can agree to dead carcasses in the graue, but to spirits and soules in hell; neither had the dead bodie of the king of Babylon any sense, sorrow, or shame for his foule fall, which their insulting in hell against him purposed to impresse. Thirdly the cruelty, tyranny, pride, and rage of the king of Babylon against Gods people were greater then to bee requited onely with the graue, as were all other men euen the Iewes themselues that were the Seruants of God & their most religious Kings. It was therefore no way fitting for the iustice of God against his enemies, nor for his loue to his owne, to menace the oppressors & murderers of his people with no more, but only with the graue. For since God by the same prophet threatned the king of Asshur with Tophet for smiting his people, saying; Esai. 30. v. 33. 
               Tophet is prepared of old, it is euen prepared for the king, he (to wit God) hath made it deepe and wide, the burning thereof is fire, and much wood; the breath of the Lord, like a riuer of brimstone, doth kindle it: how should the graue onely be sufficient to reuenge the outrages of the king of Babylon against the Saints of God, whose citie he vtterly destroyed, and kept them groning in most miserable seruitude? Lastly where you so confidently pronounce the graue onely is there ment, a man may soone see, how little care you take in setling your sentence, since of all other things there specified, the graue is namely excepted by the Prophet, as no part of Gods threats against that proud tyrant. These are his words. Esai. 14. vers. 20. &. 19. 
               Thou shalt not be ioyned with them in the graue, because thou hast destroied thine owne land, and slaine thy people: thou art cast out of the graue, like an abominable branch, as a carcasse troden vnder feete. So that heere you are taken tardie with a plain and presumptuous contradiction to the words of the Prophet, that where he threatneth, the king of Babel for his cruell oppression shall not be partaker of a graue after his death, but be cast out as an hatefull care asse to be troden vnder foote, you in your wisedome affirme the g

                  er him, and of lying downe to sleepe.] This is all the shew, that can be made out of sixteene

verses in that Chapter describing the destruction of the king of Babylon and his issue, and yet these wordes neither doe nor must inferre the graue, which he should lacke, but the putrifying of his body, though vnburied; and his lying down to death, yet not in the graue. Neither is it to be doubted, but when his soule descended to Sheol below, his bodie was dead; the one doth not exclude, but rather include the other, except men descend aliue to hell, as we read of some in the Scriptures; otherwise the soule is first seuered from the body, before she goe to her owne place, which for the wicked is the lower Sheol.
            Thus much you might haue learned out of old and new interpreters, but that you scorne to be directed by any man farder then your owne fancie doth lead you. Of this place of Esaie Ierom thus writeth. Hiero. in 14. ca. Esaiae.

These are the treasures of rich and mightie men, which oppresse others in this life; they cary nothing hence, but a wretched conscience into the Gehenna sire, where their worme doth not die, nor the fire quench. Pellican. Pallicanus in 14. Esaiae.

Gualter. Gualterus in 14. ca. Esaiae. 
               The summe of all that shall be said (by the Prophet) is this, that the Medes should kill the king of Babylon, and his soule be cast downe to hell, among other tyrants to suffer euerlasting torments. This place hath an euident testimonie teaching vs, that soules do not die with their bodies, but are spirits immortall, and gathered into a place appointed for them; the wicked to hell, where vtter darkenesse is, and eternall weeping and gnashing of teeth.

            The words of Ezechiel 31 & 32, haue as many and the same circumstances to resute your follie, as the wordes of Esay haue, and make proofe sufficient, that those words doe not import only the Graue, as you falsely presume. First Rabbi Iehosuas and Midras Tehilim of good authority amongst the Iews, auouch (as I haue shewed) erets tachtith, the lower carth, to be the description and appellation of Hell in the Scriptures. Next, Mercer and Forster, and other famous Hebricians obserue, as also your selfe doe yeeld, that erets tachtith hath manifestly the same sense and signification with Sheol Tachath in the foureteenth of Esay, of which there is now no doubt but hell is thereby implied. Thirdly, Ezechiel purposely noteth, and so nameth the same place, where all the vncircumcised and wicked, that from the beginning were barbarous and bloudie enemies to the people of God, were gathered and receiued after this life, whereof many thousand were drowned, and otherwise depriued of their graues (except the name of graue be figuratiuely taken for death) when yet Ezechiel pointed out the place, where they were at the time that he spake these words, euen in the lower earth.

Let vs see, which of these two senses, yours or mine, best fitteth the apostles purpose: Of yours I may safely say, it hath no coherence with the wordes, nor intent of the Apostle. For these two verses, the ninth and the tenth, interposed wi

               h a parenthesis, apparantly pertaine to the verifying of Dauids wordes cited immediately before in the eight verse, that Christ ascending on high, lead captiuitie captiue. Before Christes ascending, by way of relation the Apostle putteth Christes descending; and because descending and ascending must haue contrary extreames, from which and to which the motion is made, therefore to the highest heauens, aboue which Christ ascended, Paul opposeth the lowest parts of the earth, to which Christ first descended. The end of his descending is comprised in Dauids wordes, to leade Captiuitie Captiue, which must be from the place of their chiefest strength; euen as the end of his ascending after hee had led captiuitie Captiue, was to giue gifts to men. Now these two are the greatest blessings that Christ in this life bestoweth on his Church, and in order follow one the other, as Dauid first, and after him the Apostle setteth them. For we were first to be Luk. 1. 
               deliuered from our enemies, and from the hands of all that hate vs, I meane the enemies of our soules, as Zacharie filled with the holy Ghost did prophesie we should, before we could serue him without feare in holinesse and righteousnesse, as wee ought to doe,

And full conquest ouer them Christ had none, but by rising from the dead, and treading vnder his feet all their power and strength, not onely against himselfe, but against all his. And no place fitter to dissolue and breake all their force and might then in the chiefe castle of their kingdome, which is hell seated in the lower parts of the earth. So that this exposition of the learned and auncient Fathers, which I before abundantly deliuered in their owne word
                  •…
               s, is so farre from any iust challenge, that it orderly and plainely lightneth and iustifieth the wordes of Dauid, which the Apostle there taketh vpon him to illustrate. Now in your exposition there is no such thing. For first the graue is not in the lower parts of the earth, nor opposite to the height of heauen, whither Christ ascended,

according to the Apostles wordes. Next Christ descending to his graue, was rather lead captiue of death, then shewed any conquest ouer death. Thirdly before Christ, many rose from the graue, as well aunciently raised by Elias and Elizeus, as then newly by Christ himselfe. But this conquest, which Dauid heere celebrateth, was not ouer the graue onely, but ouer hell, Satan, sinne, death, and all the power and feare of the enemie, which Christ led Captiue, leauing none vnconquered, and made an open shew of them, triumphing ouer them in his owne person; as the same Apostle elsewhere deliuereth. Therefore this place must stand for good, till you or your friends bring better helpes to vnioynt it, then your and their idle phrasiologie gainsaying the whole Church of Christ for your priuate nouelties and vanities.

You first confesse I expound the text, and then you charge me with adding to the text; as if any man could possibly expound any place of Scripture, and adde nothing to the wordes. Then were plaine reading of the text, the best expounding of it; and so should all exposition be superfluous and iniurious, as most of your expositions are. And who, besides you, so deepely doteth, as to charge an expositour with saying somewhat besides the text? but I adde it in a different letter like the text and together with the text.] I cannot expound any place of Scripture, but I must insert the wordes of the text which I expound, and ioyne them together with mine owne. The text I cite not three lines before exactly as it lieth in the apostles writings, and set by the side the quotation of the place, Ephes. 4. with a direction to the wordes alleaged by me out of the apostle. I then reason from the true meaning of the apostles wordes, who saith, that Christ first descended to the lower parts of the earth, and ascending on high lead captiuitie captiue. Whence did Christ lead captiuitie captiue, but from the lower parts of the earth? If that were the purpose of his descending, the lower parts of the earth were the place, whence he lead captiuitie (euen all his & our enemies) captiue. And so I made the conclusion of mine owne, and not a fresh allegation, as you absurdly mistake, of the Apostles words; Christ then descended into the lower parts of the earth, and thence lead captiuitie captiue; that he might fill all (places with his presence.) Where if your eies were not more then dimme, you might soone see, I quoted no text, as I did before, but declared by mine owne wordes inserted, what I gathered out of the apostles speech, as the wordes interposed in an other letter, and with two lines inclosed, (but that the Printer did sometimes forget my markes and directions) doe plainly witnesse. And to what purpose I pray you Sir in common reason were it for me to repeat a place faire and full as I doe, and within two lines after to cite the same againe with sixe wordes added, which were not in the former; except it were an exposition and no citation of the Apostles words? Wherefore your wisedome might presently haue perceaued, that the halfe circle which standeth after (places) did in my coppie stand after (presence) and that the Printer by haste or neglect brought it neerer then hee should. And those very wordes (places with his presence) you finde twice in the same section in an ordinarie letter, and cite them your selfe as an exposition and not an addition to the Apostles words.
            
               But my speech, you say, is both inconuenient and farre from the Apostles meaning.] Of that you are no fitte iudge, you must reade more, and more indifferently then you doe, before you will come neere the Apostles meaning. Your exposition, that Christ first descended into the lower parts of the earth, and (then) ascended farre aboue all heauens, onely to fill all his Church with the gifts of his spirit, which by his ascending hee promised to doe; is farre from the Apostles wordes and meaning. For in these wordes (to fill all) the apostle compriseth as well the benefits of

Christs descending as of his ascend ing. And euen by his ascending we are assured of other and greater gifts, then those which are powred on his church heere on earth for the support of his Saints in this life. Christes comming to iudgement, his raising our bodies from corruption, and conforming them to be like his glorious body, and bringing vs into the kingdome of his Father, where perfect, eternall, and celestiall ioy, blisse, and glory shall be reuealed on vs; these be waightier and excellenter gifts then the graces of this life; and yet by Christes ascending into heauen we haue a manifest interest in all these. So that though it be true, that Christ departing from vs, prouided sufficiently for vs, whilcs heere we liue, by the gifts and graces of his spirit; yet the kingdome of Christ, which cxtendeth to things, places, and persons celestiall, terrestriall; and infernall, is farre larger, then that part, which you mention, which commeth nothing neere to the fulnesse of the Apostles wordes or sense. Since then by descending to the lowest, and ascending to the highest, the apostle noteth all the places in the world, the earth not excepted, from which Christ both descended, and ascended after he had finished the worke of our redemption, and by his presence in euerie place was acknowledged, his power and dominion ouer all things in euery of these places, hell it selfe being not able to make any resistance to his person or pleasure: the sensc which I giuc to the apostlcs words, that Christ descended & ascended to fill all places with the maiestie of his presence, and might of his word, better declareth the greatnesse and largenesse of Christes kingdome now sitting in heauen, then doth the guiding of his church in the miseries and infirmities of this life, though I do not denie, but that is a woorthy part of his excellent and supereminent power. And for that application of the apostles wordes, which perhaps you finde not in your Note bookc, and so suspcct it to be the more inconuenient, Athanasius a man of more iudgement, then I or you, or any that you follow, for ought that I know, first led me to it.

Will your wisedome then learne, that the question must fit the answere, & the one be pinned at least to the other. But Christ, you say, is not named in either of those questions, who (shal or) can ascend to heauen? who (shal or) can descend to the deepe?] What thcn? are there not besides the answers, which name Christ, & so

For he that doubteth, whether Christ dying descended to the deepe, or rising ascended to heauen; vtterly frustrateth the faith, that is in Christ. The perswasion then of faith, which must be farre from moouing any such questions of Christ, prooueth those questions to pertaine to Christ. Secondly the questions themselues exactly comprise the person of Christ, and consequently, though he be not there named, yet is he there 
                  •…
               nely intended, as appeareth by the answere. For these interrogatiues, who can ascend to heauen, or who can descend to the deepe; are equiualent to these generall Negatiues,

none can ascend to heauen, and none can descend to the deepe, as is plaine by the perpetuall vse of the Scripture. 1. Cor. 4. 
               What hast thou which thou hast not receaued? 
               Psal. 34. 
               who is like to thee O Lord? 
               Esa. 53. 
               his generation who shall declare? 
               Iohn. 8. 
               which of you reproueth me of sinne? 
               Rom 8. 
               Who shall accuse the elect of God? Who shall separate vs from the loue of Christ? And a thousand like examples doe exquisitely proue these interrogatiues to be resolute and absolute Negatiues. And so Iob expoundeth them. Iob. 14. 
               Who can make cleane of vncleane? not one. If NONE can ascend to heauen, or descend to the deepe, then NOT CHRIST; and so much the Apostle expresseth, when he saith, that Christ is excluded from descending, and ascending by those questions; and in that respect all, that will be faithful must forbeare them. Then notwithstanding your exception not worth a straw, these are two maine grounds of the Christian faith, that Christ dying descended to the decpe, and rising ascended to heauen, and hee that but doubteth in his heart of either of these, by the apostles verdict emptieth and reuerseth Christs death and resurrection. And did not this latter question, (who can descend to the deepe) pertaine directly vnto Christ, who onely of all men that euer were descended to the deepe of Hell, and returned againe with safetie and glory: we might not onely iustly doubt, whoe

               e, that euer man (Christ cxcepted) did descend to the deepe (supposing now that to signifie hell, as you doe) and yet doth not our faith frustrate the death of Christ, but therein rather commend it, and exalt it, that neuer man was able to doe, as he did, that is dying, and descending to subiect hell vnder his power; and to deliuer all his from thence. So that if the deepe heere doe signifie hell, then is heere a plaine resolution of the Apostle, that Christ dying descended to hell.

Oecumenius. Oecumenius in 10. ca. Roma. 
               The Apostle referreth these things to Christ. That is, wauer not, neither say in thy mind, how did Christ descend from heauen? or did Christ being dead rise from the deepe, that is from the lowest places? cast all such thoughts out of thy mind. Theophylact. Theophylact. inca. 10. Roma. 
               Stagger not, (saith the apostle) neither doubtingly cast this in thy mind, how Christ descended from heauen, or how after death he rose from the deepe, id est, ex abditissimo & profundissimo loco, that is, from the deepest and most hidden place. Erasmus. Erasmi annotationes in 10. c. Roma. 
               Who shall ascend to heauen? that being spoken of the Law, Paul interpreteth and applieth to Christ. For that is, saith he, to draw Christ from heauen. Or who shall descend into the deepe? that is, who will beleeue the things that are spoken of hell, except he see them? this is, sayth Paul, to draw Christ backe from the dead, as though he did not descend to hell, or they desired, that in their sight he would againe descend to hell. Peter Martyr thus setteth the Apostles questions. Petr. Martyr. in 10. ca. ad Roma. 
               Who shall ascend to heauen to see whether God bee reconciled to vs by Christ? or who shall descend downe into the deepe to see euerlasting death weakned and abolished by him, that is by Christ? Bucere. Buceri interpretat. 10. ca. Roma. 
               The Apostle acknowledgeth in this question the deniall of Christ, and that he draweth Christ downe from heauen, which admitteth this doubt. It is euident that the deepe is taken pro inferis, for hell, and in this sense the Apostle seemeth to haue vsed this word the deepe, for hee addeth, that is to bring Christ backe from the dead, to wit, to account his descent to hell to be void, and his victorie ouer death and Gehenna.

For where the Apostle proposeth this last point, Who shall descend to the deepe, and returne againe, as possible onely to Christ, and to none else; by your vntidie tale; that the deepe heere signifieth the generall condition of the dead opposed to the liuing, you make the apostle a weake reasoner, or rather a plaine lyer. For could Paul at this time be ignorant, that Elias and Elizeus raised some from the generall condition of the dead, that Christ restored three from death, & Peter did the like for Tabitha? Is there not plaine testimonie giuen in the Scriptures, that through faith Hebr. 11. 
               the women receaued their dead raised to life? If this were not onely possible, but so vsuall, as the Scriptures declare, how could Paul make this actiō of descending to the deepe possible but only to Christ? wherefore I say you must be better aduised, or else you shew yourselfe in an open and impudent falshood to ruffle and reuell with the holy Ghost testifying that many haue gone to the condition of the dead opposed to the lyuing, and yet bin restored to life againe. And consequently in spite of your heart, Abyssus (the bottomles deepe) must not onely keepe his signification perpetuall in the new Testament, which is the place appointed for the diuels, but descending thither with returne must import an impossible condition to all men,

               The Apostle may (also) insinuate in this word a seeking to the deepest and fardest parts of the sea, to learne somewhere (if it might be) among all the creatures how to fulfill & keepe the law.

A pattern of your profound learning if a man would seeke, he shall need goe no farder then this Page and the next, where he shall find how ignorantly, absurdly, and vntruely you roue at the matter and meaning of Moses and Paul, and misse them both as wide as the sea is broad. For Moses speaketh no word of the depth of the sea, much lesse of seeking to all creatures, how the law of God might be fulfilled. Neither doth the Apostle exactly cite the wordes of Moses, as you imagine, but somewhat altereth them, that he may fitte them to Christ with greater effect and comfort, then Moses could vnto the law. Moses speach is faire and plaine. The Iewes, to whom he deliuered the law written, could not pretend the knowledge of Gods will to be hidde in heauen, nor farre remooued from them beyond the seas, that they should wish some would Deuter. 30. vers. 12.

               I haue set before thee life and death, blessing and cursing. Moses doth not say the performing of the law was not in heauen, nor beyond the sea: but the knowledg of the law. Otherwise you make Moses teach, that the fulfilling of the law was in their mouthes & hearts,

As for merit-mongers, of whom you say the Apostle speaketh these words, it is an idle and drowsie conceit of yours. These words doe no waies fitte presumers on their merits, for they thinke they shall ascend to heauen by their workes, they aske not who shall ascend: and in the bottom of the sea what merits can you deuise, or to what creatures there should Pharises seeke, how to fulfill the law? what bables be these to be wreathed into the Apostles words? or who but you would place all the creatures of God, either in heauen or in the bottom of the sea? If you cannot write as a diuine, speake yet as a man of common sense or vnderstanding. And all these senses, you say the Apostle may insinuate in this word. I thinke as soone all as one, but that the deepe in one, and the same sentence should signifie the graue, the bottom of the sea, and the whole state of the dead, is a flower of your field, it groweth in no wise mans garden.

But you neuer suppose, that the Printer may sometimes mistake or mis-set my directions; and that maketh you so fast to fome at mouth with my falsifying the word of God of purpose and for aduantage; where you rather lie of purpose or for aduantage, since I doe not offer there to build any thing on that word, nor so much as mention it in my collection there, which if I would haue done, Scriptures enough besides this would warrant my assertion. And what if you whet your teeth against the trueth, and the word there, of it selfe will beare this addition without any corruption, is not your time well spent, to play the Bedlom in this sort, and in the end to betray your owne ignorance and malice?

Since Sheol by the Scriptures is a place whither a man must descend, though indeed to preuent all challenge, I was content to expresse the force of the word in another letter.

But if when the words be plaine you will wrest them with figures and phrases to another purpose, then giue vs leaue if your proofes be not sound and good, to tell you that our faith relieth on the singlenesse and plainnesse of the word of God, so receaued and beleeued since Christ had a Church on earth. And though you can make shewes with diuers acceptions, and figuratiue senses of words, yet that is no reason to reuerse the trueth written. For giue me the like liberty without regard of faith and trueth, and I can shift of any word whatsoeuer in the Scriptures, yea the chiefest and mainest grounds of Religion I can elude with different significations of the same word in other places of Scriptures. This therefore, if you take not heed, is a vaine ostentation of phrasiologie, wherewith you thinke to make euery thing of any thing with your figuratiue and phrasitiue fansies.

But in neither of these two pages which you quote, doe I pawne the question on that issue, and in the 312. by you cited in your margine, I speake not a word of Sheol or Hades; so well couched are your conceits, that you cite things neither written nor ment. Pag. 155. li. 12. 
               Wee hope then when this proofe (which you aske for against your opinion) is shewed, you will correct your opinion in this point.] Your proofes I feare will be so wide from the purpose, that they will rather confirme, then conuince mine assertion of Sheól; but neuer make so deintie to bring foorth your choisest stuffe, it will be some great onset, that you make so many offers to it, before you begin.
            
               Defenc. pag. 155. li. 17. 
               Let it be considered which the Psalmist hath of this matter: What man liueth and shall not see death? shall he deliuer his soule from the hand of Sheol? Heere now the soule attributed

to euery man liuing must be properly taken, as well as in the former place. Now then it is apparant, that heere the soules of all men liuing, both good and badde (after death) are appointed to Sheol. For there is none that can possibly escape it, saith the text. Therefore in the Scripture sheôl and Hades applied to departed soules is not alwaies hell, but the condition or place as well where the iust mens soules are after death, as that where the damned are.] Heere is the Cannon that must craze the Creede, and beate downe the walles of Christes Church; but your deuices doe not deceaue mine expectation. Set aside the wordes of the Psalmist, which you violently draw to fit your dreames; there is not one true nor likely word in all this reason. First you say, The soule attributed to euery liuing man must be properly taken (you meane for his immortall spirit) as well as in the former place, where without question the soule of Christ, as after death, was seuered from his bodie. This is a foolish and false position openly impugned by the Scriptures: for the soule attributed to euery man liuing by the Scriptures importeth not only his life, which by death is dissolued and brought to Sheol, but also his senses, desires, and euen corporall affections and passions. Of this can no man doubt, that ha

                  ol, are these things applied to the life of men, which are most false of their soules once seuered from their bodies. So that no man is able to deliuer his soule from the hand of Sheol, but he must see death, as the words next before do import; but that Sheol after death shall possesse the soules of all men, there is no such thing in the Prophets words by you produced. The hand or power of Sheol, which endeth this life, sundreth the soule from the bodie, that power of Sheol shall no man escape, because it is appointed for all to die, or as it is in your allegation, to see death: but what becommeth of their soules after death, whether they be in Sheol or in Paradise, this place expresseth not. And therefore your interlacing those wordes (after death) of your owne authority besides the text, sheweth that you affirme so much, but the Psalmist sayth no such thing. And because the Reader shall plainly see, how lamely and loosely you conclude, and cleane contrarie to the direct words of the holy Ghost euen in the Psalmes, he shall heare the words of Dauid himselfe, whether his soule after death should be subiected to the power of Sheol or no. Speaking of the foolish, he sayth; Psal. 48. 
               Like sheepe they lie in Sheôl, death deuoureth them: but God will deliuer my soule from the hand (or power) of sheol: for he will receiue me. Where first is a manifest contradiction to your maine collection out of the former place, that Pag. 155. li. 29.

                  l. Secondly here is a full confirmatition of mine assertion; that whose soules God receaueth, they are not in Sheól. But God receaueth the soules of his Saints: their soules therefore are not in Sheól.
            Neither is this confession to bee found in the Psalmes alone, Salomon auoucheth the same. Prou. 23. 
               Thou shalt smite (thy child) with the rod, and shald deliuer his soule from Sheol. Then are not the soules of all men in Sheol after death, since the soule of a childe well nurtered and in time chastened shalbe deliuered from Sheol. And so shall the soules of all men, that after death liue with God. Prou. 15. 
               The way of life is on high for him that vnderstandeth to d

                  line from Sheol belowe. Life is on high, Sheol is below; the Saints then whose soules liue with God, are freed from Sheol which is below. To be in both places at once, is impossible for one and the same part of man. Then such as you graunt are in any part of heauen, can by no meanes remaine in Sheol. But the soules of the righteous are in a blessed rest with God, and as Christ promised the thiefe, that was crucified with him at least in Paradise. They be therefore not in Sheol. And as for the mirth, that you make with me and Saint Augustine, that Pag. 156. li. 9. 
               O then this point of faith is grounded on Austin, it is his

collection, (not the text without him) that serues your turne; you and your friends will neuer be able to ouermatch Saint Austins obseruation, that he neuer found in any place of Scripture Inferi (which is the word that is vsed in Latin for sheol) to be taken in any good sense and much lesse to make good proofe by the word of God, that the condition or place, in which the soules of the Saints are after death, is called sheol or hades, since as I haue sufficiently shewed, Sheol is opposite to heauen, and to euery part thereof, as the lowest and woorst place of abode to the highest and best, which things if you canne glew together you shall quit your selfe to bee your craftes master.

Is the PLACE, where soules departing hence are receaued, no POSITIVE THING with you, but a MEERE PRIVATION? who euer said so, that was not meerely depriued of his witts? the places where soules after this life are disposed, are Paradise or as you say heauen, and hell.

Who knoweth not, that such as haue ended this life may be called defuncti or mortui the deceased or dead, in that their bodies lie now in corruption, though their soules be in peace and rest with God? but what is that to the place or state in which they are after death, which the Scripture maketh to be positiue, though such a phrase-founder as you are, would haue it nothing els but priuatiue? Of Enoch and Elias, who were translated hence with their bodies liuing, it cannot be said, they are dead, because no part of them was or is subiected to death, and yet are they gone from hence to a more blessed and happie life.

               In the 49. Psalme, where all expresse circumstances doe shew that the Prophet speaketh of this death, not of hell, yet Dauid heere saith; Notwithstanding God shall deliuer my soule from the power of sheôl, (that is death or the state of death) when he shall receaue me most mightily. So Tremelius turneth it noting heere Dauids hope of the resurrection, which I thinke he hath well vnderstood in this place.] You promised to Ibid. li. 13. 
               shew euen by the Scriptures, that Sheol and Hades are more then once vsed for the generall condition of death, wherein euen iust mens soules are held, or the mansion of soules departed as well good as bad; and now you turne vs ouer to Tremelius translation, as if euery word that Tremelius said, were Scripture, whosoeuer saith nay. But first you falsifie Tremelius translation, for he doth not turne Sheol there, by death or the state of death▪
                as you set it downe, but he translateth Sheol in the 15. verse by Infernus, hell, and in the 16. which you cite, by sepulchrum the graue. And by his generall obseruation ouerthroweth your idle speculation of Sheol to be meerely and properly priuatiue. His wordes are. Scholi

The Hebrew word (Sheol) noteth in generall euerie station (not state) of the dead, (that is of so much as is dead in men) and therefore it must be applied sometimes to the graue, somtimes to hell, by Synecdoche (as to parts thereof) and sometimes to both ioyntly. Then Sheôl properly hath nothing to doe with the generall state of the dead common to good and badde, but Sheol is euery station or place vnder earth, as the graue and hell, where any part of man subiected to death is receaued. If this be Tremelius meaning, as his words import none other, then he agreeth with the rest of the Iewes and Christian Hebraicians, who auouch the same: otherwise he is deceaued, as Mercere plainly prooueth against him, and you, and all that be so minded, Mercerus in 42. ca, Genes.

               the proper and right signification of Sheôl is to signifie all places vnder earth, and not the pit or graue alone; Whereupon it is euery where opposed to heauen, which is the highest of all. Tremelius therefore maketh nothing for your conceit of Sheôl; and if he did, you are both deceaued, as I haue formerly shewed by the testimonies of many Rabbins and learned Christians, whose iudgements ouerswaie Tremelius, since neither he nor you haue any iust proofe against them, but your owne wresting the Scripture to your priuate purposes. Howbeit I see no such thing in Tremelius as you pretend, and therefore doe not charge him with any such fault.
            For your owne collection, if you ioyne it with Tremelius translation, you hatch as grosse an error touching the soules of iust men after this life, as hath beene heard of amongst Christians. For if the soules of the godly shall not be deliuered from Sheol; or, as Tremelius translateth it, from the graue till the resurrection; and as you obserue, the soule must here be taken properly, that is, for the immortall spirit which is in man; and is therefore in Sheol, because it shall not be deliuered thence till the resurrection; then are the spirits of al iust men deceased, as yet in their graues vnder earth, and there shall remaine till their bodies rise, which is fit doctrine for such a diuine as you are. You might as well conclude out of Tremelius wordes, that all the iust are damned in hell, till the resurrection. For hee thus expoundeth Dauids meaning, Christ is my deliuerer, à corruptione sepulchri, & inferni damna

Otherwise

Againe he saith, God will deliuer his soule from Sheol, ki, cúm or quia, when he shall receiue me, or because he will receiue me. Take which you will, it is plaine by the Scriptures, and by these very words of Dauid, that so soon

Lord Iesus, sayd Steuen euen as he was stoned, Acts 7.

Againe if both these parts import one sense, then the iust in Sheol are filled with sorrowes; for so are the former wordes of Dauid. And if that be true, how much hath the spirit of God deceiued vs, who bad S. Iohn write, Reuel. 14. 
               blessed are the dead, which hereafter die in the Lord: euen so saith the spirit: for they rest from their labours. But that was the spirit of trueth; and therefore the spirit of error in you sucketh these absurdities out of the Psalmes by your misconstruction of them.

Boyes meanely Catechised can soone conceiue, that death or the graue bringeth with it an end of all earthly things, from which the wicked are loth to depart, as hauing no farder nor better hope after this life; and therefore to them death is a destruction indeed,

that is a ceasing of all their pleasures, and an encreasing of all their paines. ToSheol is no destruction to the godlie. the godly, who put not their hearts to the things of this world, but desire to bee dissolued and to bee with Christ, and in comparison of his presence account all earthly things to be base, and burdenous, death is a gaine, and no destruction; because they renounced the loue of all these worldly thinges before hand, and sought for the permanent citie, whose founder is God. Wherefore to them this bodie is a burden, this life is a warefare, and this world is a desert, full of snares and pits; Wherein they wander as pilgrimes and strangers. If then to lay aside these troubles and trifles, and to be freed from all labours and dangers, and to come home to the countrcy and citie which God hath prouided for the faithfull, be in any wise mans sense a destruction, then haue you some reason to call the generall condition of death, as well to the iust as to the wicked, a destruction: but if that thought and speech be void of all religion and reason, then doe you houer in the midst betweene heauen and hell, and huddle saluation and damnation in one generall condition or state, as you call it, and when you sce what inconuenience will follow thereof, you make it nothing but a meere priuation, or an end of things past. And this you would applie as well to the person of Christ, whose soule you say was in no Sheol but this; & as to al his members, whose soules shall not be freed from this destruction and Sheol till the day of resurrection. Did you speake of the nature of death in it selfe, or as it taketh hold on the wicked, I would allow the word destruction; which if it be well vnderstood, is more then a m

To the wicked, that wedde their soules to these earthly vanities, and neglect God & his promises, the Prophets often threaten Sheol, that is the place and state, where all these thinges shal want or perish to them; but with the sheol of their bodies, which is the graue, is ioyned the sheol of their souls, which is hell, though they not regarding or not beleeuing the later, are most often threatned with the former, which they euery day saw before their eies, & so was like

Sir if you speake in earnest, these be wicked quarrels, and shew that you woulde faine shake heauen and earth to vphold your new found Sheol. Otherwise all the godly know, that God hath their ashes in sight before him, and will not mistake one earth for another, though their dust were scattered ouer all the world. And so long as he that will raise them by his mightie power, hath in so certaine number and measure the whole and euery the least dust, that came of their bodies, they lie in their graues till the time of resurrection, and their maker will not misse an haire of their head, nor a mote of their ashes; which if it be strange to you, dispute against him that created heauen and earth of nothing, and not against me, that beleeue the resurrection of mens bodies and flesh many thousand yeeres after they be turned to dust, and as you wickedly surmise, haue no being at all after they are turned to earth and wormes.

                  l.] You stumble still at the same stone, that none of those thinges can be ment of the graue, because the body rotteth and wasteth to nothing in the graue. You must leaue these falshoods, if you will but seeme to be a Diuine. The bodies of the Saints can not bee raised from their graues, if they be wasted wholy to nothing in their graues. And if you follow this argument well, whatsoeuer your name be, that by this meanes vndermine the resurrection of the dead, your wordes will broach an open heresie, though you slily vrge them to establish your new found Sheol. Wherefore I omit this desperate cauill as fighting rather against the faith, then against the name of Sheol, wherein mens bodies after death, though turned to dust, yet not to nothing, doe still remaine. Your next reason that the graue can not be called Dôr an habitation or a continuance, is idle and vtterly mistaken by you, as all the rest is. For Dôr is the time of mans life heere on earth, as well as a place of abode. And what should hinder Ezechiah to say, the time of my life is ended, or the place of mine abode heere on earth is remooued or passed away? Must it needes follow, that he shall haue a time to liue in Sheol, or a place for his soule to abide there, as you absurdly vrge; or that this habitation may not be said to be in the graue, where his body lieth knowen to God, though vnknowen to man? These be miserable shifts to hale in your priuatiue, positiue, generall, speciall, station, state, place without place, of your first found Sheôl. For where before you auouched that Sheol signified indeed 
               Pag. 157. li. 2. 
               no positiue thing properly, but a meere priuation of this life, you be now come vpon confidence of these rather riots then reasons, to resolue in plaine tearmes, that the place of blessed soules, where they see God, is 
               Pag. 160. li. 2. 
               euen that which heere is noted by the word Sheol. The place of blessed soules, where God is seene, I hope is first speciall to the godly; not generall to good and bad. Next it is positiue, and not meerely priuatiue. Thirdly it is peculiar to the soules of iust men, not imparted as yet to their whole persons. Fourthly it is not destruction, it is saluation. And lastly it is heauen, or Paradise a part of the third heauen, which you neuer thought to be Sheol. These many contrarieties you haue contriued in lesse then two leaues, hauing none other ground for all this, but onely that the dead bodies of men turned to ashes, and wasted to nothing, as you defend, can not be said to be any where, and so not in Sheol; and since there is somewhat of iust men in Sheol, as the Scriptures witnesse, it must needes be the soule; and this erroneous and perfidious position, that the body of man hath no being at al after it is turned to dust, is the sole foundation of your late made Sheol for iust mens soules.

               It is a most vaine reason, that you giue that Sheol heere is taken for hell, because death to the wicked is the passage to hell, which death Ezechiah was not neeere vnto.] I doubt not but you wilbe as bold with me, as you are with others, to corrupt or peruert euery word you light on, so you may seeme to say somewhat. My words were, that death in his owne nature was a passage to hell, as we find yet by proofe in all the wicked, though the faithfull be freed from it by the mercies of God in Christ. And therefore Ezechiah in the bitternesse of his soule might well call death the gates of hell, euen as our Sauiour said, The gates of hell should not preuaile against (his Church) though they should persue it on earth, calling sinne, error, and persecution the gates of hell, albeit in the godly they worke not so much, but in the wicked only. And in death denounced by Esaie to Ezechiah, the king did not so much feare the passage out of this life as the suddaine change of Gods fauour towards him, who not long before with a mightie hand from heauen, and by a miraculous slaughter of his enemies, saued

him and his city from the rage of Senacherib, and on the suddaine Esa. 38. 
               about that very time, as the Scripture noteth, strake him with sicknesse, and sent him word to putt his house in order, for he should die. which message the king feared was a signe of Gods displeasure against him, as iudging him vnworthy to enioy so great a deliuerance. And this might make Ezechiah, otherwise a good king, to tremble at that, which in Gods secret counsell he was not neere vnto, though in the feare and g

This comparison made betwixt the liuing and the dead, that the liuing confesle and praise God, which the dead cannot doe, belongeth in the liuing to the whole man, that is, chiefly to the soule, the maker and directer of our praiers, but associated with the body, whose parts and affections she guideth and composeth, euen as she doth the tongue to serue so good an action.

               l, as Ezechiah declared, the place therefore where the soules of the iust deceased are, is not Sheol by the scriptures, since they doe not cease to confesse and praise God. In Sheol, you say, there is no such praysing of God as on earth.] In Sheol, I say, there is no praysing of God at all. Now let vs see, to which of these two the Scriptures accord. You thought with a wrench, as your manner is, to decline the force of trueth, and make way to your fansie, but the Scriptures hold you faster then so. In the very same verse the next words are Esa. 38. v. 13. 
               They that goe downe to the pit, cannot hope (on, in, or) for thy trueth. Whosoeuer confesseth or praiseth God, must hope in the trueth of God. They can therefore no way confesle or praise God. Now the soules of the iust no question confesse and praise God. They are not therefore in the pit, which the Scriptures call Sheol. And so much you might plainly haue perceaued by the words of Salomon, if trueth had been in greater request with you, then your owne deuices. Ecclesi

But that were to prop vp error with open heresie, and as before you gaue a good push to denie the Resurrection of the flesh, by saying their bodies wasted to dust had no being at all, so by this you fairely abolish the immortality of the soule, and by consequent l

            This is your world of soules, for which you make so much worke, and whither you striue to bring the soule of Christ, defending that his soule was in your Sheol, where the Scripture saith is neither wisedome, knowledge, nor memorie.

And the proofe of all this is as pretious, as the place it selfe. For since the iust goe to Sheol as well as the wicked, and there remaine til the resurrection, the bodies of the Saints Pag. 159. li. 27.

Much to blame shall I be, if I correct not mine opinion vpon such pregnancies as these be.
            The figuratiue senses of Sheôl, as when men liuing thinke, or complaine, they are in Sheôl, or other things besides man are said to goe to Sheôl, I purposely let passe, the corruption of all earthly things returning to dust for the sinne of man, as man doth. And the feare and force of destruction persuing man in this life, if he seeke not to God for helpe, are figuratiue significations of Sheôl in the Scriptures, but deriued by resemblance from the proper significations thereof, as likewise the consoquents depending on the higher Sheôl appointed for the bodies, or on the lower prepared for the soules, that are dead, are sometimes intended by that word, and comprised in it, as adherents and accessories vnto it: These I say I omit, because we reason heere of the proper signification of Sheôl, which con

For it is well and truely acknowledged by you, that both Sheol and Hades are iust all one.] I neuer doubted but Hades in Greek was vsed by the Septuagint to expresse Sheol in Hebrew, and with them did note as well the graue, where the bodies of men lie silent and dead, as the place of punishment, whither the soules of the wicked descend: but in the new Testament where our Sauiour often and openly reuealed the place and paines of the damned, there the Euangelists and Apostles distinguishing the death of the body from the destruction of the soule, and counting the one to be but a sleepe to the godly; They separate Hades from Thanatos, and vse them diuersly, referring hades to signifie the place of torment, whither the wicked are condemned, which is hell, and expressing by Thanatos the dissolution of soule and body, saue when they speake of the death of the soule, either on earth, which is the losse of all grace, or in hell which is an exclusion from all glo

The Greeke fathers exactly follow this signification of hades for hell, which they learned from the Euangelists and Apostles. Your fitting of Dauids phrases to your owne deuices is a dangerous and deceitfull course. For you make what you will of his words, and then conclude your owne conceits out of them. Wherein if any man aske for proofes, your friends must replie with Pythagoras Scholars, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , he said the word. And you so intangle your selfe with termes, that you do not see your owne positions contradicted & confuted by your owne allegations. For where before you were peremptory that Sheol was properly a meere priuation of this life; now by misconstruing some speaches in the Scriptures you will haue life not only to be in hades, which you make all one with Sheol and death, but there to continue and abide. And when against your owne positions, and against the grounds of all reason, you haue vouched life to be in hades

which you say is death, then you turne round and would inferre, that since life cannot be in death, life there must be the soule, and so the soule must be in hades. And thus you daunce the Morrisco, that life is in hades, and life is not in hades, not knowing or not caring what you say, so you may still steppe forward, though it be ouer the shoes.

                  ers, are not spoken of dead men that are in hades, as you misconceaue, but of men yet liuing, and hauing both soule and body vnited together. And this phrase of drawing neere to Sheol or Hades, and almost dwelling there, noteth onely the danger of death approching, and readie to make an end of life, by seuering the soule from the bodie. Neither are these the wordes of the Septuagint, his life (is) in Hades, (this in me you would call a falsification of the text,) since the verbe precedent 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , his life drew neere; must be repeated, and not the verbe (is) added at your pleasure. And where the speech in Greeke his life (drew neere) in Hades, is somewhat defectiue, it must be supplied, as the former verbe requireth, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , and his life (drew neere to those) in Hades, and not with a new verbe of your deuising; specially since the Hebrew keepeth lamed prefixed before both the wordes, corruption and slayers which noteth a motion towards either, not a being in either. And yet if the Septuagint did swarue from the originall sense, as by this supplie they doe not; their authoritie is not sufficient to establish any point of doctrine not deliuered in the Authentike words of the holy Ghost. They were Iewes liuing in very corrupt times, and ignorant of the true mysteries of Christ, to which all faith must be proportioned; and therefore their wordes being not canonicall must be leuelled by the text, which they translate, or else refused as vnsound. The phrase of dwelling, in things that be contrary each to other, and so exstinguish ech the other, is as much as to bee vtterly oppressed without recouerie: though the soule may also be sayd to dwell in silence (which is the word that Dauid vseth) when it is parted from the bodie, and hath neither action, motion, nor speech, but in silent and secret maner; where as by her bodie she performeth all these things euen sensibly to the eyes and

               Againe it sufficeth for our purpose, that Hades and Sheol are often vsed euen indifferently for death, and as being in effect the same. Which also sometime wee may likewise conceaue of the Latine Inferi, which is by the translatours and other writers vsed for Sheol and Hades, though (I denie not) very dangerously and corruptly indeede.] That, which is most corrupt and ambiguous, best sufficeth your purpose, who seeke nothing but a confusion in Scriptures, Translatours, and Expositours, that you may say what you list: otherwise it doth you little good, that sometimes Sheol and Hades are vsed for death, since with the Septuagint Hades importeth the place and state of so much, as is dead, either in the wicked, as of bodie and soule; or in the godly, as of bodie alone. And so much doth the Latine word Inferi signifie with the old translator, euen places in the earth below for the dead bodies or soules; though the Latine Fathers most vsually take it for the receits of soules below the earth, to which they supposed all descended till Christs comming. How the Greeke doth sometimes render the word Sheol in Hebrew, either by Hades or Thanatos, is little to the purpose; much lesse, that Sheol and Maueth are sometimes ioyned together in the Canonicall writers, either because they agree in neuer being satisfied, or for that they are ioyned together, and the one is the way to the other. For it is death, that bringeth the good to their graues, though their soules be in rest; & the wicked to hell, when as yet their bodies be in the dust. Your determining, what is meant in ech place of Scripture, is of as much force with mee, as a feather in the aire, that flieth euery way; you can no more leaue talking, then water can running, where it hath an issue; but you are as lame in your proofes, as you be lauish in your words; you will say any thing, and prooue nothing.

If Sheol and Hades in the Scriptures be nothing but wordes, or priuations importing that men are departed this life; then happie are the wicked, that haue none other Sheol or Hades, but onely the want of this mortall and miserable life; and Atheists all this while were true beleeuers, if Moses and the Prophets threatned nothing after death but a lacke of life. And vnhappie are the godly, pag. 160. li. 2. 
               if the place of blessed soules, noted (as you say) by the word Sheôl, bee nothing else but an emptie name and a meere priuation. It were good you did a little consider with your friends, how these things agree with the Christian faith, that the STATE, CONDITION, AND PLACE of iust mens soules departed this life (for these three you containe in the name of Sheol and hades) should haue nothing in them positiue, but all priuatiue. The place of their soules I suppose to bee Paradise; and when you are in your good moodes, you make it not onely to be heauen, but aboue all the heauens, euen where Christ is at the right hand of the throne of maiestie. Their state is blessed with rest and ioy. Hath heauenly rest and blisse no positiue thing in it, but onely a priuation of this life? these be strange conceits; and yet if you will needes haue one common condition, state, and place, to good and bad, you must come to worse consequents then these. There is indeed one common condition, state, and place of the dead bodies of iust and vniust, that is, to come to corruption in their graues; but touching their soules no man besides you was euer so vnwise, as to auouch that there was one condition, state, and place of the dead; howsoeuer, now and then, some men light on generall wordes touching the dead, that require a sober and heedefull interpreter. And by what authoritie doe you call the condition and state of blessed soules a meere priuation, or a priuation at all; since to them their state is an exchange for a better life, in respect whereof this life is but a shadow of death, and the vale of miserie? Vse we to say, that men are depriued of their burdens, when they are eased of them? or depriued of their bondage, when they are freed from it? or that the hauen depriueth Sea-men of stormes? No more may wee rightly say, that the condition or state of blessed soules is any priuation, but rather a permutation of a short and wretched life (so iustly tempered for the desert of our sinnes) with a perpetuall and happie life giuen

But such is your conceited disposition, that if you may not haue a doctrine and discipline by your selfe, you loath the way of other Christian beleeuers.

               Thus the old Latin translator vseth Infernum, as commonly for Hades, so sometimes for Thanatos death, and sometimes Mors, death, for Hades. Epiphanius readeth the text, Acts 2. 24. indifferently Thanatou, or Hadou, as reckning them in effect all one.] In your last pamphlet you were at defiance with all the Fathers, Greeke and Latin, Treat. pag. 96. li. 21. 
               for abusing the wordes HADES AND INFERI to signifie Hell properly and particularly, that is, the place of the damned, or a place vnder earth, a part thereof, which the latter writers haue since named Limbus: you now are taught another lesson by some of your friends, whose fingers are in this second part of your defence, that it is more for your credit rather to peruert the meaning of ech Father, then wholy to reiect their writings. And therefore you, or they turne quite about; and now without all question the Greeke and Latin Fathers (you say) meant by Hades and Inferi, not as they did before, hell or a part thereof; but your priuatiue world of soules, and that you take vpon you to iustifie with a round and readie course, as if it were no more masterie for you to misconstrue their sayings, then the Scriptures. Notwithstanding by processe it will appeare, how much your helpers haue beguiled you, and brought you into a fooles Paradise, vpon sight of one place, with which you might wrangle, to thinke that all their testimonies were as soone auoided, or wrested to your purpose. The place of the Acts 2. 24. which the old Translator rendreth by the name of Infernus, and Epiphanius citeth sometimes with Hadou, sometimes with Thanatou, I omit till we come to the speciall handling thereof; in the meane while let vs here how well you prooue your proiect of the rest of the Fathers.

               If therefore (saith he) the Lord obserued the law of the dead, and staying vntill the third day in the lower parts of the earth, then rose in his flesh, and so ascended to his father, how should they not be confounded, who say, their inward man leauing the body heere in supercelestem ascendere locum, ascendeth to the highest place of heauen.
            
            Touching the place, where Christs soule seuered from his bodie was; as the transcriber or printer before you mistooke the word sanctorum in Irenaeus for sanctus, so you the second time corrupt the same in saying, Christ conuersed three daies where the dead (Saints) were, in steed of, Vbi erant mortui, where the dead were.

Now what hath your priuatiue Sheól and Hades to do with these words? heere are places described in the earth and vnder the earth, where if you set the soules of the Saints vntill the day of resurrection, you empty Paradise, and quite deny the Saints deceased to be in any part of heauen, since heauen is aboue and not vnder the earth.

               Tertullian doth likewise. For speaking of Inferi, which he taketh for the same that hades is, he noteth it as the place, quo vniuersa humanitas trahitur; whither all mankind must goe, and therefore of Christes going thither he saith. Because he was a man (therefore) hee died according to the Scriptures, and was buried according to the same, also heere he satisfied the common law (of nature) by following the forme of mens dying (and going) to the world of the dead.] If you should not peruert both Tertullians wordes and sense, neither would make for your purpose. And though you gain not much by corrupting the coherence of his wordes, yet are you so vsed to haue all to your liking, that you cannot hold your hand from disordering other mens speeches. Tertullian. de anima ca. 55. 
               Christ (saith Tertullian) being God, because he (was) also man, (and) died according to the Scriptures, and (was) buried according to the same; euen in this satisfied the law (by) performing the course of an humane death, (apud Inferos) in the places below. In steed of (Legi, the law) you say the common law (of nature); apud Inferos, you translate (going) to the world of the dead. These bee your fansies added to Tertullians wordes, and no parts of his purpose. In the meane while you dissemble, and therein abuse both your selfe and your Reader, that euen in that Chapter, and the sentence before, Tertullian describeth Inferi to be a place vnder the earth, whither the soules of good and bad descend after death, the good to a kind of refreshing, which is plainely Limbus so much refused by your selfe, the bad to punishment. His wordes in the fiue and fiftie Chapter, which you quote, precedent to those which you cite are these. Ibidem. 
               Nobis inferi non nuda cauositas, nec sub diualis aliqua mundi sentina creduntur, sed in fossa Terrae & in alto vastitas, & in ipsis visceribus eius abstrusa profunditas.

                   operto, & intra ipsam cauato, & inferioribus adhuc abyssis superstructo. We beleeue Inferi to be no bare hollownesse, nor any sincke vnder the world, but in the gulfe of the earth; and in the depth of vastitie, and in the very bowels of the earth an abstruse profunditie. For we reade that Christ was the three dayes of his death in the heart of the earth, that is in an inward place within the midst thereof; and couered with the earth, and hollowed within the same, and seated ouer mighty deepes below. If this be your world of the dead, let any man of vnderstanding iudge, whether this be not a plaine & euident description of that, which the latter writers called Limbus, and whether there can be any fuller delineation of it, then a place vnder the earth, and in the midst thereof, euen hollowed in the bowels of the earth, and couered with the same, hauing vnder it mighty deepes. And that in it there is as well rest for the good, as torments for the wicked. And the continuation of the very same sentence, which you guilefully bring for your world of dead, and the conclusion of both are deliuered by Tertullian in these words, (Ibidem. ca. 55. 
               if Christ did performe the course of an humanc death in places below) neither did ascend into the higth of the heauens, before he descended into the lower parts of the earth, there to make the Patriarkes and Prophets partakers of him selfe, habes regionem inferûm subterrane am credere, thou must beleeue the (place or) region of inferi to be vnder the earth. If you draw these words to your world of the dead, then are the soules of the iust neither in heauen nor in Paradise, but vnder the earth, euen in the heart or midst thereof, and there shall remaine vntill the resurrection, for so Tertullian resolueth of his inferi.
            
               Defenc pag. 163. li. 35. 
               Which yet is farder most cleerely to be seene. Lazarus apud inferos in sinu Abrahae refrigerium consecutus, Lazarus in the world of the dead enioieth comfort in Abrahams bosome, contrariewise the rich man is in the torments of fire, both of them there receauing their diuers rewards. How cleere is this that he maketh hades and inferos euen in Luke also to be nothing but the common state and world of the dead?] It is farre cleerer, that you neuer read Tertullian with indifferent care to trie the trueth of his meaning and words, but only

to abuse the Reader with a seelie shew not of his writings but of your wrestings. For there can be no directer speach to prooue, that inferi are neither heauen nor Paradise but places vnder the earth, and in the midst thereof, where bad and good, excepting onely Martyrs, are kept in rest or paine till the generall day of iudgement, then is found in these bookes of Tertullian, from which you would gather your world of the dead. For euen in the fiue and fiftie Chapter of his booke De Anima, whence you first beganne to weaue your world of the dead, he positiuely auoucheth, Tertullian

               But thou wilt say (the dead are) in Paradise, whether the Patriarkes and Prophets, that rose with our Lord, passed euen then (ab Inferis) from the places below: he answereth: How then was the region of Paradise; which is vnder the Altar, reuealed to Iohn in the spirit, to haue none other soules in it besides Martyrs? how did Perpetua the most valiant Martyr the day before her suffering, when Paradise was reuealed to her, see there onely her fellow martyrs, but because the glittering s

                  ord, that keepeth the gate of Paradise, yeeldeth to none saue to such as die in Christ, that is, as Martyrs for Christ? Tota Paradisi clauis tuus sanguis est. The only key to open Paradise, is thine owne bloud (shed in Martyrdome). So that in as plaine words, as Tertullian vseth any, Inferi are neither heauen nor Paradise, but Regio subterranea, a place (or Region) vnder earth, and in the heart of the earth; where some soules are in rest, as he thinketh, and some in torments, which if you can turne to your generall and priuatiue Hades, you shall worke wonders. That other position of his, constituimus omnem animam apud Inferos sequestrari in diem Domini; we resolue that euery soule is kept in Inferi till the day of the Lord (or of iudgement), as it is priuate to himselfe, and sauoring of Montanisme, so it is different from the rest of the Fathers, who confesse not onely Martyrs, as he doth, but all good Christians after this life to bee receiued into Paradise. This error if you be disposed, you may mainetaine with Tertullian, but you shall neuer thence establish your world of soules, which you seeke for.
            
               Defenc. pag. 164. li. 3. 
               Whereupon the learned Iunius noteth thus. Inferos Latini Patres (vt Graeci Haden) pro omni loco aut statu mortuorum dixerunt promiscué. The Latine Fathers vse Inferi (as the Greeke doe Hades) for euery place and state of the dead indifferently.] That Iunius was very learned, I doe not denie, but that learned men may be partiall, and many times addicted to their priuate collections and opihions, I would God we had not so much experience as wee haue. If Iunius meane, that Hades or Inferi were taken for euery place and state of the dead, vnder the earth, before Christes comming, Iunius wordes are very true; that many of the Fathers tooke Hades & Inferi for the place of al the dead, which they thought to be vnder the earth before Christs comming; but that they called heauen or Paradise, which are places for the Saints deceased in Christ, by the name of Inferi; or that they tooke Inferi for the state of the blessed soules since Christes resurrection, this I say neither Iunius was, nor any man liuing is able to prooue. And for Tertullians meaning, his wordes are so plaine, that neither Iunius, nor whosoeuer might or may ouerrule them. I repeated them before, the effect is this. Tertullianus de anima ca. 55. 
               Inferi, saith he, are beleeued of vs to be a vastitie in the depth of the earth; and an hidde profunditie in the bowels thereof; for we reade that Christ was the three dayes of his death in the heart of the earth, that is in the inward and middlemost receit thereof couered in the earth, and hollowed (or compassed on euery side) with the earth, and seated vpon the lower gulfes. If these words be not plaine enough, he addeth, Ibidem. 
               Habes Regionem Inferûm subterraneam credere; thou must beleeue the Region of Inferi to be vnder the earth. I shall not need many wordes to shew that Iunius obseruation out of Tertullian is not true, except you adde euery place and state of the dead vnder the earth, thereby to exclude the place and state of the blessed in heauen and in Paradise; I leaue it to the Iudgement of any man, that hath learning or vnderstanding, whether these words of Tertullian do not define and describe a certaine place vnder the earth, and within the earth, in which he thought the

soules of all men (Patriarkes and Prophets not exempted) were before Christes comming, and should bee till the resurrection, saue such as rose with Christ, or suffered Martyrdome for Christ, (for that is his exception afterward, as I haue shewed:) the good in rest, the badde in punishment. To that end he saith. Idem de Anima. cap. 58. 
               Omnes ergo animae penes inferos, inquis. Velis ac nolis, & supplicia iam ILLIC, & REFRIGERIA; habes pauperem & diuitem. Cur enim non putes animam & puniri & foueri in Inferis interim sub expectatione vtrius

                  ill you, you haue THERE alreadie both punishment and comfort, the poore man and the rich. For why should you not thinke the soule to bee punished and cherished in Inferis, in the places below, meane while vnder an expectation of either iudgement? These wordes you can alleage, and neglecting how plainly Tertullian hath taught besore, that Inferi are places in the heart of the earth, and a region vnder the earth, you wilfully change condition for regi

But this is too sensible a subuerting of Tertullians words, vnfit either for Iunius to beginne, or for you to follow. If Tertullians words were as true as they be plaine, neither side might refuse his opinion.
            Neither was Tertullian alone in this perswasion, that all departing this life before Christes death went to places below in the earth. Ireneus affirmeth almost as much.Irenaeus li. 4. c

               Ea propter Dominum in ca, quae sunt sub terra descendisse euangelizantem & illis aduentum suum. Therefore the Lord descended to the places vnder the earth to preach (or publish) euen to them his comming. And againe, Christ conuersed three dayes,Irenaeus li. 5. ca. 31. 
               where the dead were, yea where the soules of the dead were, and was in the heart of the earth, and stayed till the third day in the lower parts of the earth, where I trust you will not defend Heauen or Paradise to be. Ierom is more plaine in this point:Hieron. in 3. ca. Ecclesiastis. Salomon speaketh thus, sayth he, because before the comming of Christ, omnia ad inferos pariter ducerentur, all were caried alike to the places below. Wherefore Iacob sayth, He shall descend ad inferos, to the lower places. Et Iob pios & impios in inferno queritur retentari. And Iob complaineth that the godly and the wicked are detained in inferno, in the gulfe below. And lest you make what you list of the words Inferi & Infernus, as Iunius and some other learned men by their leaues haue done, you shall heare what Ierom himselfe sayth of them both:Idem in Ose. ca. 13. 
               Inter mortem & inferos hoc interest, betweene death and inferi this is the difference. Death is that whereby the soule is separated from the bodie. Infernus locus, in quo animae includuntur siue in refrigerio, siue in poenis. Infernus is the place in which the soules are shut vp, either in refreshing or in punishment. Now where this place was, and how long the soules of the iust stayed there, he doth not dissemble.Idem in Os
                     •…
                  . ca. 14. 
               We learne (by Esay) sayth he, that Infernus is vnder the earth. And
               Hiero in Epistol. ad Ephes. ca. 4. 
               that Infernus is in the lower part of the earth, the Psalmist witnesseth, saying: The earth opened and swallowed Dathan, and couered the congregation of Abiram. ForIdem in Ion

                  . ca. 2. 
               as the heart is in the midst of the liuing creature, so Infernus is sayd to be in the midst of the earth. And vpon these words of Salomon, There is neither thought, knowledge, nor wisdome in Infernus whither thou goest, he sayth.Idem in ca. 9. Ecclesiastis.

Note, that thou mayest beleeue Samuel also was truely in Infernus; and that before Christes comming, all, though saints, were detained vnder the law of Infernus. But that the saints after the Lords resurrection are no longer in Infernus, the Apostle witnesseth, saying: It is better to be dissolued, and to be with Christ. Now he that is with Christ, certainly is not held in Infernus. I would not repeat so much of this, which I do not acknowledge to be vndoubtedly true, were it not that you and some othe
                  •…
               s take aduantage of these sayings, (which yet you reiect as vtterly false) to establish hence your new world of soules, and that after Christs resurrection, directly repugnant to their assertions, out of whose words you would seeme to deriue your opinion. For you hold, that to this hower the soules of the iust are in hades and infernus
               
and so shalbe till the resurrection; since infernus and hades, as you beare men in hand, import no more with the Latin and Greek fathers but the condition and state of the dead in generall, whether they be in hell or in heauen. Well this may be your conceit, but no father Greek, or Latin, euer made mention of any such thing, as you would gather out of their words. That all mens soules before Christs comming, good and bad, were in places vnder the earth, the good in ease and comfort, the rest in paines and torments, this some of the fathers both Greek and Latin auouch; but that the iust still remaine now after Christs resurrection either in hades or Infernus, I find no man that auoucheth any such thing, saue only Tertullian. The first I must confesse I doe not beleeue, neither did Saint Austen before me, who learnedly and truely concluded, that Abrahams bosome mentioned by our Sauiour in the Gospell could be no part nor member of Infernus or hell; since the Scripture saith, there is a great and mighty gulfe set betweene them, so that the one can haue no accesse to the other, and the iust were aboue in comfort, whiles the wicked were below in hades, a place of torment, punished with flames of fire. But since the resurrection of Christ, no father (I still except Tertullian) affirmeth the soules of the iust to be in hades or infernus; but in Paradise, which Tertullian yeelded to none but to Martyrs, being himselfe infected with the error of Montanus, when he wrote his booke De anima, as shall most plainly appeare, though you neuer so stifly denie it. Howbeit his opinion in that was priuate, and different from the rest. For Ierom saith. Hiero. in Epitaphio Nepotiani. 
               Ante Christum Abraham apud Inferos post Christum latro in Paradiso. Before Christ Abraham was in places below: after Christ the Thiefe was in Paradise. Now the thiefe was iustly punished for his offences, and so no Martyr. Idem in Zacharia. ca. 9. And againe. The munition, to which God exh
                     •…
                  rteth the Prisoners of hope, we ought to vnderstand none other but the habitation of Paradise, to which the Thiefe first entred with the Lord. For 
               Idem tomo 3. ad Dardanum de terra viuentium. 
               this is the Land of the liuing (in which the good things of the Lord are prepared for meeke and holy men,) to which before the comming of our Lord and Sauiour in the flesh, neither Abraham, nor Isaac, nor Iacob, nor the Prophets, nor other iust men could attaine. But euen by Tertullian himselfe it is euident, that your collection out of him is vtterly false. For he excepteth martyrs out of Inferi, and placeth them in Paradise, who yet I trust are in the condition of the dead. And so by no meanes doe inferi signifie with Tertullian the place or state of good and bad indifferently, that are dead, but onely such as were, or are in places vnder the earth, who are properly and truely called inferi in respect of vs and not those that are aboue vs in heauen or Paradise, where on euery side we now confesse the Saints are, though their bodies lie yet in the dust vnder earth.
            And because Chrysostome is quoted as one of the Patrons of these pretences, I am content to let you see, that Chrysostome is abused as well as the rest. For howsoeuer Chrysostome be vehement and sometimes figuratiue in his speeches, yet shall you not be able to prooue, that he euer vseth Hades after Christes death and resurrection for the place of iust mens soules. Before that time (some of the Greeke Fathers supposing the soules of the iust to be kept vnder the earth) you may perchance finde heere and there a sentence where the iust are said to be in Hades: but you shall neuer be able to euince, that after Christes resurrection Hades is either the common condition or place of soules departed good and bad, as you and some others would seeme to obserue out of the Greeke Fathers. I speake of no more then I haue read in Greeke, but for so much as is extant of theirs, and I could get, I dare assure the Reader he shall finde my saying to be true. As for the Homilie of Chrysostome, which you cite, it can doe you no great good. The Greeke to my knowledge is not Printed, and therefore you can conclude nothing for Hades, since the Grecians haue and vse many words for Inferi besides Hades. Cyril of Ierusalem expressing in Greeke that Article of the Creed, descendit ad inferos, saith, Cyrillus Hierosolymit. catechesi. 4. 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               . Christ descended to the places below (or vnder the earth) to redeeme thence the iust. But graunt the worde Hades be vsed in that place of Chrysostome, what prooue you more then that Chrysostom was of opinion the soules of the

iust before Christes comming were not in heauen or Paradise, but in Hades vnder the earth? neither shall we need for witnesse thereof to goe any farder then the same Homilie, which you produce for your purpose. His wordes euen there are these. Chrysost. tom, 2 homil. de diuite ex Luc. 16. 
               Simulque consider andum, quod Abraham apud inferos erat. Nondum enim Christus resurrexerat, qui illum in Paradisum duceret. Antequam Christus moreretur, nemo in Paradisum conscenderat nisi Latro. And withall we must consider, that Abraham was yet (
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ) apud inferos, with those that were vnder the earth. For Christ was not yet risen; who should bring him into Paradise. Before Christ died, no man ascended to Paradise but the thiefe. No man could enter into Paradise, which Christ had shut. The thiefe was the first, that entred with Christ. The crosse of Christ (is) the key of Paradise, the crosse of Christ opened Paradise.
               Ibidem. Abraham is yet vnder the generall condition of death; though his soule be in Paradise: but Abraham is no longer in Hades, where he was before Christs comming by Chrysostoms opinion. Hades therefore is neither Paradise, nor the generall state of the dead after Christes death and resurrection; which cannot be strange to him that with any moderate paines peruseth Chrysostom.

Christ dying hell lost out of his dition (or custodie) whom before it held. Infernus (or Hades) threw of the right of his former power. And after his eloquent manner speaking in the person of Christ, hee saith amongst other things. Idem serm. 3. de Resurrect. tomo. 3. 
               I should haue left vngratefull (men) to euerlasting punishment; but mercie, I confesse, preuailed with mee. I sent not an Angel, but I my selfe came downe for thee. I suffered my selfe to bee slaine, & sic ad istos Inseros veni; and so came to these lower places. Goe out now you that are bound; rise vp yee that are wretched; breath your selues yee prisoners. Behold I shine on you as light vnwoonted, behold I breake all your cordes and chaines. Ecce Tarteareas sedes, noctemque profundam faetidumque chaos extermino. Beholde, I abolish (to you these) infernall seats, (this) darke mist, and stincking chaos. Here is Chrysostomes hades, which I trust is not the generall state nor place of all mens soules vnder Christ: specially since Chrysostom in plaine speech sayth, Christ abolished and ended all these things to them that were in hell or hades. If you stand on the Greeke word, as not expressed in Chrysostoms Latine copies; out of these Latine translations your Leaders by their leaues gathered their obseruations (for these parts of Chrysostom are not yet printed in Greeke) and therefore rightly may they berefuted by the same. But though it be no small defect, that we want as yet the most of Chrysostoms works in Greeke, neuerthelesse by part you shall perceiue what he meaneth by the word Hades wheresoeuer it is occurrent in his writings. In his homilie of the resurrection (which I before cited, lying in the New Colledge Librarie in Oxford) he hath these words: Chrysost. aduersus Ebrios & de Resurrectione. 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               . The Lord came on his crosse, and payed a death for (man) who was held of the diuell, that he might free him from the bands of hades. Where the bands of hades are those wherein man was deteined of the diuell. And elsewhere speaking of the crosse of Christ: Chrysost. in Matth.

               ruse them, that they auouch it to be a place of darkenesse, opposed to heauen and Paradise, and vnder the earth, where Diuels are keepers and tormentors of soules, and where the wicked

after this life are kept prisoners, and suffer punishments according to their deserts, & which Christ destroyed and spoiled by his descent thither, deliuering thence, that is from the feare, power, and danger thereof, all such as before or after did or should beleeue in him. And though some of these writers did happily thinke the soules of the godly deceased before Christes death were kept in a part thereof, in hope of their deliuerance thence; yet with one consent they witnesse it to be nothing lesse then heauen or Paradise, or the state of the dead common to good and bad after Christs resurrection; as likewise they teach, that Christ deliuered thence, not onely such of his elect as were dead before that time, but all the faithfull, aswell then liuing, as yet vnborne. And therefore a deliuerance thence doth not exactly conclude a locall detention and inclusion there, but a quiting and disloluing of all the right, interest, and challenge; that hell or Satan had for sinne vnto the seruants and members of Christ, whensoeuer they liued or died. Onely Tertullian is opposite to them all, who dreampt that the soules of all the faithfull, saue Martyrs, were kept in places vnder the earth, which he calleth inferi, till the generall resurrection; wherein, as in many other points deliuered in his booke de Anima, he goeth a priuate way by himselfe without and against the maine resolution of the rest of the Fathers.

That none but Martyrs are in Paradise, and all other the faithfull departing this life are in prisons and places vnder the earth till the day of iudgement, this is not onely repugnant to the Scriptures and the rest of the Fathers, but a plaine branch of Montanus heresie, which Tertullian deriueth from no grounds of holy Scripture, whence all trueth must be fet; but from certaine Reuelations & Prophesies different from the Scriptures, which Montanus and others published as made by the holy Ghost after the writing of the Scriptures; and which Tertullian in his writings coloureth with the name and pretence of the Para

               Also in that obiection of certaine Heretickes, whom he confuteth, not the true Christians, as you misconceaue. They argued thus (as you doe). In hoc Christus inferos adijt, ne nos adiremus. Christ therefore went to hell, to the end we should neuer come there. He answereth them, that it is false, that Christ went to inferos in that sense, that is, to hell. For then what difference is there between the wicked heathen and the godly Christians, if one and the same prison after death were for them both? taking it for a thing generally graunted in the Church that it were a WICKED AND HERETICALL THING to thinke, he went where the damned were, that is, into hell.] Ignorance maketh you not onely blind and bold, but presumptuous and sawcie to acquite from heresie, and condemne for heresie, whom pleaseth you. And therefore I must not thinke it strange to be chalenged by you, for a wicked and hereticall opinion, since you grosly belie the whole Church of Christ, and dippe them in the same vate of wicked and heretical things with me. You wilfully wrest and misconstrue Tertullians words smoothing him in a manifest error against the whole Church of Christ, and roling them vp with wicked heresie, that were the greatest lights of Christian religion next after the Apostles. Tertullians resolutions in this very Chapter are plaine enough to him, that is not more then blind. Tertull. de Anima. ca. 55.

Thou hast to beleeue, that the region of inferi is vnder the earth, and to push them from their opinions, who proudly enough will not thinke the soules of the faithfull to be fitte for infernall (or Iower) places: seruants aboue their Lord, and Scholers aboue their Masters, in that they skorne perhaps to haue the comfort of expecting the resurrection in Abrahams bosome. Heere Tertullian

positiuely declareth that he taketh inferi for a place or Region vnder the earth, and that such as thought not the soules of the faithfull fitte for that place till the resurrection, did proudly presume to be aboue their Lord and Master, and skorne Abrahams bosome, where the rest of the Patriarks & Prophets are kept, (as he dreameth) and so shalbe till the day of iudgement. Now whose opinion I pray you was this, that the soules of the faithfull after Christs resurrection went to Paradise, and not to places vnder the earth? was it not the maine confession of Christs Church? Tertullian then purposely refuting that opinion, what els doth he but traduce the generall persuasion of the faithfull in fauour of his new prophesie, which reserued Paradise onely for Martyrs, and in that respect abandoned all the soules of the godly dying in their beds to places vnder the earth, there to be kept till Christes comming.

This was therefore done that by the soule of the iust descending to hell the sorrows of hell might be loosed, (and) the sorrows of hell being loosed, he deliuered all the faithfull from them.

In all these (mischiefes) men were not, but because their deserts were such, that they should haue been in them, had they not been holpen (from them) they rightly say they were THENCE DELIVERED, whither they were not suffered to come, by such as deliuered them. If then they were Hereticks that vpheld this position, the best learned of the fathers in Christs Church were plainely within the compasse of heresie; and whether it be safer to forsake Tertullian in his priuate conceit of Montanisme, or to muster so many religious and Catholike writers for hereticks, let the Reader iudge.
            And what if you take your selfe by the nose before you be ware, and plunge your selfe into this wicked heresie (as you call it) farre deeper then others by alleaging and yet refusing Tertullians fansies in this place, doe you not well to be so liberall of your termes, when you must beare the greatest waight of them?

               onant to Montanus new prophesies, and repugnant to the Church of Christ; and therefore vnlesse these fathers were hereticks I am none: but you are caught like a Come with your loude ctowing, and cannot shift thence but with your owne shame. For you say, it was the obiection of 
               Defenc. pag. 164. li. 23. 
               certaine hereticks. Now if your selfe defend that, which Tertullian there

impugneth, then are you an heretick by your owne confession. First then, that Christ dying went ad inferos, that is, ad inferiora terrarum, to the lower parts of the earth, Tertullian exactly auoucheth. His words of Christ, in this very Chapter are, De Anima. ca. 55. 
               Forma humanae mortis apud inferos functus, nec ante ascendit in sublimior a caelorum, quam descendit in inferior a terrarum. He performed the manner of an humane death in the places below, neither did he ascend to the higher parts of the heauens, before he descended to the lower parts of the earth. This Tertullian bringeth as graunted on all sides: for he refuseth not that, which himselfe affirmeth. The obiection then of the heretiks, as you name them, was this; Ne nos adiremus, that we should not come thither; that is, ad regionem inferúm subterraneam, to the region of inferi vnder the earth, which is Tertullians inferi whither he thought all must come. Now make your choise, wise Sir, whether you wilbe one of the Hereticks, as you say, whom Tertullian refuteth, or hold this grosse error with Tertullian, that all the Saints saue Martyrs, after this life are in places vnder the earth, there to remaine till the day of resurrection. But this you euery where seeme to disclaime as being that Limbus, which you so much auoide. Then are you one of those hereticks, whose obiection this is, and that which argueth you to be a witt-all, aswell as an heretick of your owne calling, you haue not so much sense as to see, that you yeeld your selfe to be an heretick for defending the trueth.
            Tertullian saith, Defenc. pag. 164. li. 28. 
               it is false that Christ went to inferos, that is to hell.] You that rightly vnderstand not one word in this place of Tertullian, talke as if you were authorized not onely to contradict your owne Author, but to pronounce them all heretikes, that gainesay your absurd and ignorant follie. Tertullian in this place resolueth, that Christ dying went ad Inferos, that is ad Regionem Inferúm subterraneam; to the Region of Inferi vnder earth, for so he expoundeth himselfe; and concludeth, that all the faithfull after death (saue Martyrs) shall goe to the same Region vnder earth, and there stay till the generall refurrection. This conclusion you denie as well as I doe, and say they were Heretikes, that made that obiection. But awake out of this maze or madnesse, and see that Tertullian to strengthen the priuate opinions of Montanus in aduauncing Martyrs and none else to Paradise, impugneth the profession of the whole Church, that Christes descending to Inferi, that is to the Region vnder the earth, freed all the faithfull from comming thither. With like stupiditie you seuer the reason of this position from the position it selfe, and make that a refutation of the obiection as you call it, which is a confirmation thereof. For they which opposed the former wordes, Christ, therefore went ad inferos, to the places below, least we should come thither: brought this for a reason of their assertion. Tertull. de anima. ca. 55.

                  s idem? For what difference is there betweene Ethnicks and Christians, if they haue one and the same prison after death? You say this is Tertullians answere to them; but your head is so heauie, that you doe not perceaue this maketh for them, not against them; and so rather confirmeth then answereth their obiection. They, who made the former obiection, that Christ went to the places below, least we should come thither, neuer excepted infidels but Christians from comming to those places. If Tertullian were of the same mind, he did rather confesse, then refell their obiection. But his answere to these words commeth after, which you did not reade, or not marke. Tertull. de anima ca. 55. 
               Agnosce differentiam Ethnici & fidelis in morte, si pro Deo occumbas vt Paracletus monet, non in mollibus f

Where following not onely the fansies, but the very phrases of Montanus prophesies, as I haue formerly shewed, he maketh no difference (as touching the place) betweene Ethnicks and Christians after death, except they be Martyrs: and thereby fastneth all the faithfull, that die in their beddes, or of any sickenesse, (be it neuer so grieuous) to Inferi, the Region vnder the earth, which error was alwayes condemned by the Church of Christ.

                  ogether vndeseruedly.] Indeed if I would follow your example in drawing the Fathers wordes from their plaine and true meaning, and force them to a sense which they neuer thought, yea which they directly rerute; I might easily make the fathers say, what pleased me, as you doe. But this with me, and with all that be wise, is the peruerting, not the producing of Fathers. And therefore I did them lesse wrong to shew, where they differed amongst themselues in some secret points not fully reuealed to men in this life, then to falsifie them, and abuse them after this manner. Neither said I any worse of them, then they say of themselues, that these things are vncertaine, and no man might be offended, if they were not able to bring any setled (or assured) expositions (or resolutions) in these points, which Austin openly In Psal. 85. professed of himselfe, as I told you in that Serm. pag. 189. place which you cite. But let vs heare how you medicine these matters, and by that we shall sound the depth of your skill.
            If I would take Inferos in some places for hell, in other places for the world of the dead, and namely where the godly dead should be, all were safe you thinke: Saint Austin did no way disagree from him in those places, which I cited, which were Epistola 99. 57. de Genesi ad literam li. 12. ca. 33. de ciuitate Dei li. 20. ca. 15.

And what will you doe with that position of Austins so often repeated, and vrged as the ground of his resolution, that he neuer found Inferi in the Scriptures taken in any good signification?

               Quaeri solet, si non nisi paenalia rectè intelliguntur Inferna, quo modo animam Domini Christi piè credamus fuisse in inferno? Sed bené respondetur ideo descendisse, vt quibus oportuit subueniret. Some vse to demaund, if Inferna be rightly taken for none other but for the places of punishments (after this life) how may we safely beleeue, that the soule of the Lord Christ was (in Inferno) in hell? but it is wel answered, he descended (thither) to succour those, that were to be succoured. And so elsewhere. Idem de Genesi. ad liter. li. 12. ca. 33.

That Christs soule came euen to those places, in which sinners are tormented to deliuer them from torments, whom his iustice vnknowne to vs thought fit to deliuer, is belieued not without good cause. Austen acknowledgeth the Church belieued it in his time; howsoeuer your tongue ouerrunneth your teeth to make it a wicked & hereticall thing so to thinke. Ambrose confesseth the same.

Infernus is the place of punishments and torments, in which the rich man clothed with purple was seene, and to which the Lord descended to dimisse such, as were bound, out of prison. These I trust were no Heretikes, but if need were, and I would vse that aduantage against you, which you insisting on Tertullians error seeke against me, they would doe little lesse then prooue you to be a refuser and peruerter of the faith receiued in the Church of Christ, and professed not by them onely, but by all those Fathers, whom I Supra pa. 544. formerly cited as concurring in this cause with them. But I smile at your follie, and remit your reproches to the Readers impartiall Censure.
            
               Defenc. pag. 165. li. 10. 
               Athanasius also saying, where humane soules were held by death, there Christ brought his humane soule; meaneth nothing else, but that his soule came vnder the same condition of death, as other humane soules did: not that he went to the place of the damned. Neither must he be vnderstood after your partiall translation, when you say ex orco, out of hell, himselfe saith ex Hadou, out of the power of death.] You set your selfe to outface all the places, which I brought out of the Fathers for Christs descent to hell; and as you played your part in wrenching & wrying the words of Tertullian & Austin from their rightsense, so you continue in all the rest with like successe, thinking it enough for you to say the word, though it be neuer so false, and farre from the Fathers meaning. As first in Athanasius wordes; what double punishment was that I pray, which God threatned to Adam for sinne, in saying Athanas. de incarnatione Christi. 
               to the earthly part, earth thou art, & to earth shalt thou returne; and to the soule, thou shalt die the death; for those are Athanasius words; and what be the 
               Ibidem. 
               two places, to which man after his dissolution was condemned? Did God threaten nothing to Adam but the dissolution of bodie and soule, or did he threaten the death of the soule also after this life, which properly noteth hell, besides the death of the bodie? I trust you be not so senselesse as to say, that God for sinne threatened no more to Adam and his posteritie but onely a bodily death; for so could none of Adams off-spring by that sentence be adiudged to hell, which yet we find daily performed by Gods iustice. Then the death of mans soule threatened by God for sinne, and meant by Athanasius in those words, which you would elude, was the place of perpetuall torments, where the soule of man was truly held in death, and not the condition of the soule seuered from the bodie without respect of any consequent miserie. Therefore your maine foundation is euidently false, that Athanasius by the death of mans soule meaneth nothing els, but the soules being apart from the bodie without regard of punishment following: but in expresse words he noteth the place, Ibidem. 
               Vbi tencbatur anima humana in

morte, where the soule of man was held (captiue) in death; which spite of your heart must needes be hell. Againe according to the double death threatned for sinne, Athanasius saith,

Now in your diuinitie is any man condemned to heauen, or to Paradise? you must find vs then two places of condemnation, whither either part of man dissolued was adiudged, as his bodie to the graue, his soule to hades. So saith Athanasius in expresse words. If you

If hades be enemie and opposite to immortalitie, as you confesse out of Athanasius, then Hades is neither heauen nor Paradise, for they are both places of immortalitie; there is no death, but life in either of them.

                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , be could not be held in death. Secondly that hades was spoiled of all his power, right, and claime, to or ouer all Christs elect, and we deliuered thence; Athanasius, as well as the rest, beareth plentifull witnesse. But that Christ spoiled heauen or Paradise, where the soules of the Saints were seuered from their bodies, & brought vs thence, is not onely a false fable, but a pestilent error. Christ raising his body from the graue (by Athanasius iudgement) gaue vs hope of the resurrection of our bodies, and bringing backe his soule from hades, as not onely vntouched of any death there, but also loosing the bands

               Descending to hades Christ brought vs backe, saith Athanasius of himselfe, and of all Christs members as then not borne. Christ did not bring all the faithful of the old Testament from the condition of death, much lesse brought he the rest thence, that were not either dead or borne. We die still, and so the condition of death is common to vs after Christs resurrection as it was to the fathers before Christs death and birth; but hell hath now no right to vs, nor power ouer vs, since Christ our head conquered and spoiled Satan of all interest and chalenge to any of his members. And where you pretend, that hades is spoiled, because our soules shalbe ioined againe to our bodies at the resurrection; know you good Sir, that the separation of the soule from the bodie was to dure by Gods ordinance but for a time, as well in the wicked as in the godly, that is vntil the generall iudgement. And you that defend a resurrection and immortality as well of the wicked in hell, as of the Saints in Paradise, what reason can you giue, why the condition of the soule separated from the body is more conquered by Christ for his members, then by Satan for his partners? for that separation shall cease in both; and consequently the force of death seuering the soule from the body is spoiled aswell for the reprobate, as for the elect. Yea the continuing of the godly soules asunder from their

               Hilarie verily hath this meaning also saying, this is the law of humane necessity, that their bodies goe downe to the graue, their soules to the world of the dead, ad inferos. Which descent the Lord did not refuse that he might prooue himselfe in euery point to be true man. And 
               Pag. 166. li. 5. 
               this (for his soule to come vnder the power of death) was indeed the law of humane necessity (after the like phrase as Iustine, Irenaeus, and Tertullian also speake) but not to goe to hell.] Your head is so fraighted with falseshoods, that trueth can take no place there; and so little is your skill, though your pride be great, that you doe not know, for ought that I see, how necessity of death came into mans nature. Whiles man was free from sinne, he was free from death. Rom. 5. 
               By sinne came death. When man lost his innocencie, he lost his liberty, and fell both within the seruitude of sinne, and necessity of death. Now death being the wages of sinne reacheth aswell to the soule after this life, as to the body to be depriued of this life. Rom. 5. v. 18. 
               By one offence (came guiltinesse) on all men vnto condemnation. The law then of humane necessity for sinne (without Christ Iesus in whom we recouer liberty) is for the body to goe to corruption, and for the soule to descend to destruction, and not onely to be seuered from the body, as you would faine mistake the words of Hilarie. It is no part of humane necessity for the soule seuered from the body to ascend to heauen or to Paradise; that is the honour and fauour of our Redemption purchased by Christ our Sauiour, but necessity of death in vs, which is the reward of sinne, draweth the whole man body and soule vnto condemnation. This you might haue found to be Hilaries meaning by the words precedent, which occasioned this conclusion. Si descendero in infernum, ades. If I goe downe to hell, thou art there; Which Hilarie sheweth to be verified in Christ, by the words that you bring; meaning, that as men by sinne Hilar. in Psal. 138. 
               came to this necessitie, that their bodies lying in the graue, their soules descended to hell: So Christ the redeemer of man, refused not euen this descent to hell, ad consummationem veri hominis, to consummate true man, or to recouer and restore both parts of man, to witte, body and soule, whereof a true man consisteth. That Christ should descend to places vnseene and vnknowen to prooue himselfe a true man, what sense can this haue, since no man liuing was present to see the proofe thereof? and he that doubted, whether Christ liuing were a true man, would much more doubt, whether Christ rising in that glorious bodie, which neuer man saw before, no
                  •…
                the like, were a true man or no. I thinke therefore by your leaue, that as Christ died, not to prooue himselfe a true man, but to ransome our sinnes, so he descended to the places below, not to make proofe to vs, that he was a true man, but to worke our saluation and consummation, as elswhere the same Father

saith; Crux, mors, inferi, nostra salus est. Christs crosse, death, and descent to inferi, are parts of our saluation. And of Christ he voucheth, mortem in inferno perimens, he killed death in hell. And yet if with you we should take consummation for demonstration, which is farre fet; and say Christ re
                  •…
               used not that descent to shew himselfe a true man, it nothing hurteth me, since that burden of necessity lay on all men, for desert of sinne, till they were deliuered by Christ, to haue their bodies goe to the graue, and their soules to the place of punishment: both which Christ refused not, though he were in the one without any corruption, in the other without any condemnation, but as conquerour of both.
            Of Iustine, Irenaeus & Tertullian we haue spoken before, we shall not need to iterate your ouersights; Iustine speaketh of no law at all, Irenaeus noteth the law of the dead to be this, that they must stay a time dead before their resurrection; and Tertullian nameth the law either threatning Adam, if he sinned; or the Law of Moses punishing sinne committed by men; either of which stretcheth farder then the separation of the soule from the body. As forDefenc. pag. 166. li. 17. 
               the law of our nature, which you say is to die, and no more; you talke thereof, as if you were rather a prophane Philosopher, then anie piece of a Diuine, since this law was laid on our nature for sinne, and forceth as well our soules to hell, if we be not thence redeemed by Christ, as our bodies to the graue. That in death the whole man is dissolued, the soule separated from the body, and the bodie left voide of sense and life, what is this to your purpose? will this conclude, that the soule in heauen or in paradise, being not onely in rest, but in ioy, feeleth still the sting of death, which she felt at her parting from her body, before she tasted the life to come? Will you continue the power and sense of death euen in heauen, because the soule assured of Gods goodnesse and promise expecteth her body to be partaker of the same blisse with her, and to receaue the crowne of righteousnesse laide vp in store for all, that loue Christes comming? or if you be so venturous in fauour of your owne conceits, that you will mingle darkenesse with light, death with life, and the feare of hell with the ioy of heauen, thinke you to finde any man so vnwise, as to tread your steppes in these vnchristian deuices?

               Chrysostome and Basil likewise (with the rest of the Greekes) may be noted, how they yeeld Hades to the soules of the godly and iust men deceased remaining in ioyes.] If you speake of the time afore Christes comming, and take Hades for places vnder the earth, you may chance to finde some such thing in Chrysostome and Basil; but that either of them after Christs resurrection yeeldeth Hades to the soules of the blessed, is a manifest vntrueth.

               Also Ambrose is to be considered, who right according to all the rest, saith; Soules departed from their bodies did goe to Hades, that is to an inuisible place, which in Latin we call Infernum.] Could you alleage the Fathers wordes rightly, you might happely sometimes vnderstand them; but alwaies peruerting them as you doe, what maruell if alwaies you misse their meaning? Ambrose doth not there deliuer either his owne opinion, or the perswasion of any Christians, but speaketh of Heathen Philosophers, who knew nothing of our saluation by Christ, and of them saith.

It had beene enough for them (being Pagans) to haue said, that the soules seuered from (their) bodies went to Aides, that is to a place vnseene, which in Latine we call Infernus (hell). If you be a Pagan, we looke for none other confession at your handes; he that is ignorant of the faith, must needs be ignorant of the trueth; but if you be a Christian, you may not say as the Pagans did, that the soules of the godly, who are with Christ, goe to Hades or Infernus. Ambrose himselfe will tell you so much. Ambros. de Tobia. ca. 19. 
               In Inferno semper est, qui non ascendit ad Christum. He that ascendeth not to Christ, is alwaies in hell. As for Christes descending he saith, Idem. in Psal. 45. 
               Dominus in Infernum descendit, vt & illi, qui in Infernis erant, a perpetuis vinculis soluerentur. The Lord descended to hell, that they which were in places below, might be loosed from perpetuall chaines.

If you will place the soules of the Saints deceased in Christ below in the earth, then may you haue some hold in Ierom, that they are yet in Infernus; but if that be repugnant to the Scriptures, to the Fathers, to Ieroms expresse words, and euen to your owne positions; why vse you, or rather so openly abuse you Ieroms speech against so maine and manifest a trueth, not distinguishing the time whereof he spake, but confounding the old and new Testament together, to giue place to your lame collections?

And therefore when he proposeth the other opinion with a condition, if it may be beleeued without absurditie; euen there he retaineth his owne resolution, that Abrahams bosome was in locis à tormentis impiorum remotissimis; in places most remote from the torments of the wicked; and to beleeue otherwise were an absurditie, as he concludeth in his 99.

               Superi & Inferi, the Saints aboue, and the spirits beneath, are generally so called in regard of vs, who dwell on earth, and speake on earth, & are by position of place in the middest, that is lower then the highest, and higher then the lowest. And because vnder vs there are none liuing but those in hell, therefore Inferi, whom the Apostle calleth 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , are spirits vnder the earth, whether men or diuels. As for that other obiection out of the Psalmes, it is not onely a bubble soone blowen away, but a bable not worth the bringing. The translation of Tremelius and Iunius, to whom you most appeale for these matters, hath In Psal. 98. 
               eripiat seipsum à sepulchro; shall he saue himselfe from the graue? that is, can hee keepe himselfe that he shall not die? and where you take hold on the word soule, as if that must be either in the graue, which is absurd, or in the hand of Inferi, which is that you would haue; your hastie head doth not perceiue, that take the word SOVLE, which way you will, either for the life of man, which is an vsuall speech in the Scriptures, or for the soule properly; neither of them doth steede you a rush. For no man can preserue his life from the graue, that he shall not die; neither can any man withstand the hand or power of death, that it shall not seuer the soule from the bodie; since that is the ordinance of God against all men. Saint Austen giueth you a third sense, taking the soule there for the soule separate from the bodie, which is more then euer you would be able to prooue, and yet that maketh nothing to your purpose. August, in Psal. 88. 
               The rest of the faithfull, saith he, shall rise from the dead, and liue for euer, and not see death; and yet can they not deliuer their owne soules from the handes of hell. He which deliuered his owne soule from the hands of hell, he hath deliuered the soules of his faithfull, they cannot deliuer themselues. This S. Austen could obserue, though he regarded none of your vaine supposals.

               Fulgentius denieth not inferos to the godly deceased, nor that Christ was locally only with them in inferis. So that in saying he was where the wicked are tormented, he meaneth that in respect of the common place, which in the whole he calleth infernum.] Heere is a hole, where through your wit is wholy runne, and not your wit alone, but your religion, learning, and conscience are runne after.

Christ descended euen thither, whither man seuered from God by desert of sinne was fallen, that is to infernus, where the soule of a sinner vseth to bee tormented. What doth your wisedome answere to this? He meaneth that in respect of the common place, which in the whole hee

                  rnum.] Is there any one place common to the Saints in heauen, and to the damned in hell? You haue learned belike of Parmenides the riddle-maker, that all is one; and because the world is but one, that heauen and hell make one common place. Whether fell man, I pray you, by the desert of sinne, to heauen or to hell? not to heauen, I hope; for then man sinning should approch to Gods Throne; who, Fulgentius saith, was seuered from God. to hell then he fell: ergo Christ descended to hell by Fulgentius assertion, and that place, where the soules of sinners are wont to be tormenmented, he calleth Infernum; which if you can prooue to bee heauen, you shall doe greater wonders, then M. Hugh Broughton can doe. For he maketh but a great ditch betwixt heauen and hell. You fill vp that ditch of M. Broughtons digging, and say both hell and heauen are one place common to Saints and Diuels. For Infernus is the singular number, and by the rules of Grammer, if any rules will hold you, must note but one place, in which if both the blessed and the damned are, then heauen and hell are both but one place. Againe you farre passe M. Broughtons skill, in that he saith, they are much deceaued, who thinke hell to be below in the earth, though Saint Paul distribute all reasonable creatures subiected to Christs kingdome, into thingsPhil. 2. 
               in heauen, on earth, and vnder the earth. You change the whole site of the world, and say heauen is below. For where insernus is deriued from infra, which is below, if heauen bee called infernus, then surely heauen is below; and then must the Apostle recall his error in saying,Colos. 3. 
               seeke the things which are aboue, where Christ is sitting at the right hand of God; he should haue sayd by your doctrine, seeke the things which are below; where the soules of the wicked are tormented; for that is heauen with you. But if at your next exercise you should pray for your Auditorie to come to infernus, where the wicked are punished, I winne they would thinke you more madde, then M. Broughton is. Howbe it with this one answere you giue the lie aswell to Prophets, as Apostles. For where Dauid saith to God,Psal. 30. 
               Thou hast brought my soule out of infernus, that cannot be by your rules, since heauen and hell make but one place, and the earth being in the midst of them must needes be one place with both extreames, and haue the same name with both. So that Dauids soule wheresoeuer it was, was not out of Infernus. Againe where he saith in the person of Christ,Psal. 16. 
               Thou wilt not leaue my soule in infernus; that is false by your doctrine, who teach that Christ and all his Saints deceased are yet in a common place with the damned, the whole being called Infernus. And where before you were very angry, That I said you made ascending to be descending, and heauen to be hell; to decline the force of Fulgentius wordes, you fairely answere, that Christs descending to infernus, where the soules of sinners are tormented, was his going to heauen, because they both are but one place common to good and bad, and the whole hath one name, which is Infernus.

               As dying for vs, Christ made vs all to die with him, so loosing the sorrowes of hell, omnes fideles ab ijsdem doloribus liberauit, he deliuered all the faithfull from the same (feares and) sorrowes. Which Ambrose calleth mankinde.

               Descendens ad inferos genus humanum liberauit. Christ descending to hell deliuered (thence) mankind. With these S. Austen agreeth, and sayth: August. in Psal. 85.

                     •…
                  . Therefore Christ went euen vnto hell, that we should not remaine in hell. Austen knowing this end of Christes descending to hell, why should he not say, Christ went thither to deliuer those, Idem epistola. 99. 
               quos esse soluendos occultá nobis suá iustitia iudicabat, whom in his iustice secret to vs he thought fit to be deliuered? Since then there are so sufficient causes acknowledged by the Fathers and by Austen himselfe of Christes descent to hell, which you can not refute; what reason hath it, that his maine opinion of Christes spoiling hades and hell, approued by so many Fathers and by Councels prouinciall and generall, should be false, though in the maner thereof he did somewhat varie from the

rest? which yet I neither do, nor need grant, if we take his owne exposition elswhere; that Idem in Psal. 85. 
               there they were not, but because such were their deserts, that there they had beene, vnlesse they had beene holpen, they are rightly sayd to be deliuered from thence, whither they were not suffered to come by Christ their deliuerer.

               Inferi eo quod infra sunt, Latine appellantur, Inferi are in Latine so called, because they are below: The other: Sicut secundum corpus inferiora sunt omnia grauiora, ita secundum spiritum inferiora sunt omnia tristiora.

You against all reason, and learning contradict both these: for you say that heauen is infernus, which by force of the word must needes be below; and you bring death, which is a most grieuous thing, into heauen; though it be the highest place and state, that men can or shall haue. Besides you sticke not to alter your authors, Irenaeus, Tertullian, and Ambrose, whom you bring for your pretence; and where they talke of an innisible place or prison, you turne their wordes to an inuisible state common to good and bad. Irenaeus in that place saith nothing of Hades; Ambrose saith, the heathen were of opinion, that soules loosed from their bodies went to aides, a place not seene, which the Latines call infernus. Tertullian saith, Tertull de anima ca. 58. 
               Carcerem illum, quod Euangelium demonstrat, inferos intelligimus. That prison which the Gospell mentioneth, we vnderstand to be inferi. What is this to heauen or paradise, or to the state of blessed soules departed this life?

               By this which we confesse that the Lord descended to infernus, we must vnderstand that the Lord ioined himselfe in spirit to the spirits of the Saints deceased; that I say is added as a consequent to Christs death, and not as the proper signification of the phrase. For it were more then absurd by your leaue, that one and the same word, which he saith signifieth the graue, should properly note the burying of the body in earth below, and the ascending of the spirit to heauen on high, though in all the Saints the one is performed as well as the other.

               The Lord descended to Tartarus, but felt there no torment. The third, to which he more inclineth, Longe simplicius videbimur hunc articulum intelligere si senserimus virtutem mortis Christi dimanasse etiam ad defunctos, & his profuisse. We shall seeme farre more simply to vnderstand this article, if we thinke that the force of Christs death pearced euen to the dead, and profited them. The fourth is, Vel certe per inferos & inferna intelligimus, non locum certè destinatum impijs, sed defunctos fideles. Or els by inferi & inferna we vnderstand not the place of punishment appointed for the wicked, but the faithfull deceased. Here are all foure senses. He liketh best, that the vertue and force of Christs death descended and was shewed both to the blessed and to the damned; as Saint PeterIbidem.

If by Christs spirit he ment Christs soule, he expressely refuteh your conceits. If he mean, the force of Christs diuine spirit descended, he hath Athanasius, Cyril, and others opposite against him.

               . Neither in any wise may we say, that the Godhead of the only begotten was brought from (hades or) the dennes vnder the earth: for that was not worthy of woondering, if the Sonne of God were not left in hades. Exactly they teach, that the Deitie of Christ, or his diuine spirit could by no meanes be sayd to descend to hades, or to returne from thence, but it must be verified of his humane soule, which reuealed it selfe, and the vertue of his death as well to the damned, as to the blessed.

And so doth Hades with the septuagint, who alwaies render Sheôl by that word. Now the graue or state of the dead (the one being an exposition of the other) reacheth not to the Soules of the godly (which are not in their graues) but to their bodies; and hath in it corruption, silence, obliuion and priuation of all things in this life, from which the graue excludeth them, be they neuer so blessed. And so that rest, which Lauatere nameth, is not the ioy of heauen; but rest from the labours of this life, which our bodies attaine in the graue, specially when the Soule enioyeth her eternall and happie rest; which the wicked want, that are adiudged to the place of torments.

words abused by Pagans to ignorant and false apprehensions, yet retaine they such sense of those words, as the trueth of God prescribeth, and not as Pagans and Idolaters imagined. And to whom did the Apostles speake in thisActs 2. place which you cite, to prophane and heathen men, or to Iewes, that were well acquainted with Moses and the Prophets, though they were borne in diuers places of the world, and vnderstood the languages of many other nations? the Scripture saith euen of this multitude then assembled to heare the Apostles speake with diuers tongues;Acts 2. v. 5. 
               There were dwelling at Ierusalem Iewes, men Religious, (or fearing God) of euerie nation vnder heauen. Els to what end did Peter alleage to them the Prophets Ioel and Dauid, if they knew the writings of neither? but that whole Sermon of Peters prooueth, that they were familiarly conuersant in the Scriptures; and therefore the Apostles speaking strange languages so tempered their wordes and sense, as men trained vp in Moses might wel vnderstand their meaning. And when the Apostles spake or wrot in other tongues besides the Hebrew, trow you they retained the same sense and vnderstanding in euery word, that the Pagans did, who knew nothing of Christ? how many words are there, which the writings of the Euangelists and Apostles turne from their generall and vsuall signification amongst the heathen, to expresse things proper to Christian religion? shall Euangelium, fides, spiritus, ecclesia, episcopus, diaconus, presbyter, martyr, diabolus, and many such import no more with Christians then they did with Pagans? who euer was so blind, that euer read any thing? Hades then the apostles might & did vse for a place vnder earth, where the wicked after this life were tormented; so far they agreed with the vse of the word formerly receaued: but where vnbeleeuers thought the soules of the godly were likewise in the same place vnder the earth, tho gh in more rest or in some pleasures, such as naturall men could deuice; the Apostles and Euangelists instructed no doubt by their Master, and by his example correcting that error, named the place, where the soules of the faithfull were receaued after death,Luke 23.

So that your great Masters of the Greeke tongue, if euer you saw them or read thē, exactly resolue against you, that your hades pandocheus, whither all goe both good and bad, is vnder the earth, and so can no way be proportioned to heauen or paradise, which are farre aboue the starres of heauen, and are habitations of light and blisse; where your hades of the blessed, in the opinion of Pagans and Christians, was a place of darkenesse, though mixed with ease and comfort as they supposed. And touching the Latin Inferi, of which you seeme to make such account by pretence of Ciceroes words, but without all cause; I replie with the words of Lactantius, whom the Christians called their Cicero.I actant. de falsa religion. li. 2. ca. 2. 
               Nihil terra inferius, & humilius, nisi mors & inferi. Nothing is lower and baser then the earth, but death and inferi. And because Hen: Iac: is become of late so deuoute a Patrone of Ciceroes, that he may not suffer his Paganish errors to be reprooued; and is angrie that any man taketh his beedleship from him, let him read but the next chapter of Lactantius against Cicero by name, and he shall see what honour is to be yeelded to heathen Idolaters against the trueth.

               a place of torments. Your selfe all this while haue maintained Hades to be a place as well of rest as of punishment; that is of both at least. And would you now with a Poeticall fiction or comparison strike out all, that you and others haue said, and appoint punishments not in, but vnder Hades? Poets haue their speciall fansies of Tartarus, and therein agree not one with another. Hesiode saith;Hesiod. in Theogoni

               Virgil. Aeneid. 6. 
               Tartarus ipse bis patet in praeceps tantum. Tartarus is twice as deepe, as heauen is high. And though Homer were blind, yet he neuer intended to make Tartarus no part, but the lowest parte of Hades. And therefore he placed it deepe vnder the higher hades, where dead bodies are, which Hesiode called the earth. For Hades is common as well to the bodies buried, as to the soules receiued vnder the earth. And therfore your citing Sophocles and Aeschylus vsing Hades for the graue, where our bodies rest, is an answere to that which you bring out of Homer, and an heaping vp of matter no way pertinent to your purpose. For thinke you that the graue hath no limitation of place? why then are you so copious in things not doubted, & wholy speechles

               Hades was the Ruler or place of soules, that were beneath vnder the earth, were they in rest, or in paine. How is this repugnant either to my selfe, or to the trueth? (Defenc. pag. 174. li. 20. 
               You make a strange answer, that Christian Religion will assure, this place must needs bee hell. What that place where some good mens soules deceased are in rest? Is this hell? Is it hell in Christian Religion? who then will henceforth care for hell, if some soules haue rest and pleasures in hell?] Know you not who rideth you, when you breake your spurres on a bench, and thinke you be on horse-backe? That hades is beneath vnder the earth, as the Pagans confessed, and must needs be hell, (since Christian religion acknowledgeth no place vnder the earth for soules deceased, besides hell) I auouched: what then? what fault findeth your mastership therewith? are any there in rest, you aske? The Pagans so drempt; and therefore I say, with them it was so; that is, they supposed it to be so; but Christian Religion, I replied, assureth vs, there is no place vnder the earth for soules, but only hel. Where are now your quicke & thicke punctilioes & easie hell that you so plea withall? The Pagans were of that minde, if you list to be one of them, you may hope for rest in hell: but Christian religion, to which I appealed, assureth vs that it is a place of torment. Cannot your heauy head discerne, when I report and refute Pagans opinions, and when I propose points of Christian religion?
            
               Defenc. pag. 174. li. 24. 
               But you say also, that those heathen Greeks did thinke this place of soules was vnder the earth. It is true they thought so indeed: and it was their error.] Then haue you all this while out-faced the trueth, when you deriued from them a world of soules without limitation of place; and your exposition of the Creed according to their sense must needs inferre, that Christes soule after death descended vnder the earth, for there is hades by the maine consent of the heathen Greekes, as you now confesse. And if you

place heauen or paradise (where the soules of the righteous now are) vnder the earth to vphold your Greeke conceits; you shall deserue a garland in your new made hades, but I dare promise you no rest in your heauen vnder earth, except you restore it to the place where God set it, that is aboue vs, and not beneath vs.
            That Hades was the proper name of a person, and secondly of the place, Pag. 175. li. 2. 
               this is not materiall, nor to any purpose: 
               Pag. 174. li. 34. 
               yet it is questionlesse vtterly vntrue.] Is it vtterly vntrue, that the Pagan Poets (for of them I speake) tooke Hades chiefly for the ruler of the dead, and in that respect called his kingdome vnder the earth, also Hades? I omit what Diodorus Siculus reporteth as well of antiquitie as of the Poets, that they tooke Diodorus Siculus li. 5.

               , this is the opinion of the most and the wisest. Yea Zoroastres himselfe was of that opinion, who liued some thousands of yeeres before the battell of Troy, as Plutarke writeth, and is taken for Cham the sonne of Noah by our Historiographers.Plinij natural. hist. li. 3. ca. 10. Plinie maketh him elder then Moses by many thousands of yeeres. Shew me now as auncient testimonies, that the place was called Hades, as I shew you, that the person was so named, and I will yeeld. If you can not, prate not so presumptuously, that questionlesse this is vtterly vntrue.
            
            To my assertion, there is no one place in trueth common to all soules departed this life, but some are in heauen, and some are in hell, you answer: Defenc pag 175. li. 17. 
               yet neuerthelesse As they are some where within the compasse of the created world, so are they in a common place.
               The whole created world is hades with the defender. This As doth so haunt you, that you can doe nothing without it. As they are in the created world, so they are in one common place. Then hell and heauen with you make but one place, and consequently Christ sitting at the right hand of God, is with all the elect angels in the same place with the diuell and the damned; and we liuing heere on earth since we are in the created world, are both in the same place with Christ, & also in the same place with the damned. Such new Cosmographie well becommeth your new Diuinitie; without such misshapen Asses you are not able to open your mouth. But if this be your best defence for your new found Hades, your Reader I trust will be better aduised, before he will be in the same place or minde with you. The Scriptures teach vs to distinguish places according to their names giuen them by God himselfe, as heauen, earth and hell, and not to make all one common place, or world of soules which you haue newly created.
            
               Pag. 175. li. 22. 
               We stand not so much on this, that by hades must be vnderstood any one place common to all the dead, but the state and condition of death among the dead.] All this while you haue beene prouing, that hades is an inuisible place, and so doth Ambrosse expound it, aïdes is a place not seene, which we call Hell; now you can not tell how to bring heauen and hell (which are so farre distant asunder) to be one common place, you would faine reduce them to one common state or condition of death, when the Scriptures euery where make them opposite, ascribing light and life to the one, and darkenesse and death to the other. But you haue found one common condition of death in both, which is to want their bodies.] What say you then to Elias, who was caried vp to heauen or to Paradise aliue, and neuer died? Are he and the rest, who rose from their graues with Christ, in the common condition of death? What say you to Core, Dathan

Abiram, and their company, who descended aliue to hades; are they free from the condition of death in hades, because they haue their bodies? Meere priuations are no conditions or states. And therefore to want their bodies for a time either in heauen or in hell, maketh no common estate to both, no more than that they are all soules, and contained in some certaine limitation of place, which nothing touch their condition or state: otherwise the damned in hell and the blessed in heauen shall alwayes haue one common state and condition, because they shall eternally be fastned to their places, and shall haue their soules vnited to their bodies; and shall remember things past, and such like; which yet do not performe one common estate or condition to both, since they shall haue so many contraries to make them differ, euen as now they haue; though degrees of ioy and paine shall then increase.

               esteemed indeed a part of his dominion to be hell properly, but a part also to be the region of the happie.] This is like the rest of your trueths. Did the Pagans know or acknowledge none other heauen but hades? Did euer man so write or speake, that had read but one leafe of prose or Poetrie? neuer read you what Cicero citeth out of Ennius?Cicero Tuscul

               Quid totum propè coelum, nonne humano genere completum est? The whole heauen is it not almost replenished with mankind? Homer and the rest of the Greeke Poets were not ignorant hereof, nor silent herein. Of Hercules Homer sayth;

The Greeke Poets then were not ignorant of heauen aboue, when they sent most men departing this life to Hades beneath; but they had heard somewhat of that diuine sentence, which adiudged mankind for sinne to death both of body and Soule, and thereupon, as there manner is to multiply their owne fansies and fables, they placed all mortall men in Hades below; and yet allowed the better sort of men some ease and comfort; though they neuer brought them to heauen, except they thought them the sonnes of some God. What is this to the true heauen; which is the glorious seate of God, and the euerlasting habitation of his Angels and Saints? Why yoke you Gods trueth with Poeticall fables and humane fansies, as if the one were not onely a meet paterne for the other, but the same place with the other? How commeth hades to be al one with the created world, and so not only men liuing are in hades, but Saints and Angels, yea Christ himselfe is still in hades, since neither he nor they are without the compasse of the created world? So large is your predicament of hades, that the whole world is scant wide enough for it.
            After this you reade vs a lecture of more than two leaues, howDefenc. pag. 176. li. 23. 
               the Apostles taught the trueth of the Gospell with the very words of the heathens; and as you make rules for their speech at your pleasure, so you take paines to bring no authour, for all that you say, besides your selfe. I haue heard so many of your trifling and wandering discourses, that I am starke wearie with reading them; and if it haue no better weight than your word, you may keepe your winde, and saue your labour. Who doubteth, but the Holy Ghost might and did correct as well the words as errours of the heathens, and reduced both their eares and hearts to the vnderstanding and imbracing of the Gospell? Wherefore such words as Infidels abused and defiled with their wicked imaginations, the Apostles of Christ restrained and applied to expresse the trueth, thereby teaching the heathen to keepe their words and leaue their errours, and not

framing the Gospel to the prophane sense or vse of their speech. What conclude you hence for hades? That the Apostles retained the erroneous sense of that word, and made it worse than the Pagans did? For the heathen vsed that word for places vnder the earth, where soules after this life were kept; and you would haue the Apostles vse it for Heauen and Paradise, where the soules of the righteous are, as well as for hell where the damned are. Leaue therefore your idle vagaries; the Apostles vsed the word hades for the places vnder the earth, where soules were detained, as the heathen did: but in this they redressed the Pagans conceits, that they as naturall men dreamed of bodily pleasures in hades, which the Scriptures make a place of torment with perpetuall fire. Put this correction to the Poets opinion of hades, as touching the condition of soules thither adiudged, and I see no danger in the vse of hades for hell, since the Pagans by that word intended the places vnder earth, where the wicked after this life were punished.

               A Philosopher will rarely and sometime perhaps note the aire by Tartarus; yet vsually and in a manner alwayes they ment hell by it. Yet Peter not Canonizing their dreames of hell, notwithstanding signifieth hell indeed by that worde of theirs according to the common vse thereof.] Though the Poets vse not Tartarus, as often as they doe Hades, for the receite of soules after death; yet it is false, which you say, that in a manner alwayes they ment (the dungeon of) hell by it; It is an vsuall phrase among the Poets for the place, where soules were bestowed after death, as Hades is. Pindarus expressing the inconstancie of mans life saith:Apud Plutar. de consolations ad Apollonium.

And where you say, Peter signifieth hell indeed by that word, you may meete with many that will tell you, Saint Peter there calleth the aire aboutTartarus taken for the aire ouer vs. & aboue the earth by that name, as well as the places vnder the earth; and that in respect of the light, which the reprobate Angels did before enioy in heauen, this world may iustly be called darkenesse.

               Let vs not doubt but the sinfull Angels were cast into this aeriall mist about the earth, as into a prison, (according to the Apostles faith), kept to be punished in iudgement.

               Defenc. pag. 178. li. 28. 
               The very naturall Etymologie of the word according to the Grammar doth properly signifie VNSEENE or not seene any more in this world: topos aides an vnseene place as Plato calleth it. Where note it cannot bee referred to the estate of Angels, but of them that had once a visible and ordinarie being and conuersation heere in this world.] You hang this geere together with hookes. Hades you say is properly, not seene any more in this world; yet it is tópos áides, an vnseene place, as Plato calleth it. You haue gotten you three starting holes vnder the couert of Hades, the place vnseene, the person not seene any more in this world, the state inuisible: but you hide your selfe so vnhandsomely in them, that when you thinke your selfe most inuisible, all the world may see your open follie. Was the place of Hades euer seene in this world? I trust not. Then Hades is topos aides a place, which neuer man liuing saw; for a man must bee dead before he can come to

that place. You graunt the Grammaticall Etymologie of the word Hades is to signifie a place vnseene, as Plato calleth it. How come you then to applie this to the person or state, not seene any more in this world, by which you would exclude Angels from being in hades? It is euident that the Poets made Hades a person, and supplie

               , Hades the God with the blacke lockes of haire. Was this ruler of the places below, which is the diuell, euer aliue with vs in this world? If he neuer had no visible state in this life, and yet is properly and originally called Hades, as I haue shewed before, then Hades is that, which was neuer seene in this world; and doth agree as well to Angels (for all your noting) as to diuels, if it import no more, but that which is vnseene of vs. But who warranteth this interpretation besides your selfe? Let aïdes stand for vnseene; how prooue you, as you conceiue, that it inferreth a state once seene in this world, and now by death vnseene? I say, vnseene applied to hades, is neuer seene of any man liuing, and not as you wrest it, now no longer seene. And so your Etymologie maketh nothing for you. And what if hades deriued from aïdes signifie that place where nothing can be seene for lacke of light, doe you not finely strip your Reader with an vnseene sleite, as you thinke; but indeed with a sensible deluding of the trueth? peruse your masters of the Greeke tongue, and tell mee whether the

            (The Apostles Defenc pag. 180. li. 30. 
               tooke the word Gehenna from the Hebrewes, and vsed it properly for hell. Therefore they need not alter hades for that purpose; for which they had another proper word. Christ speaking to the Iewes vsed the word Gehenna for hell fire, which they best vnderstood; and Saint Iames writing to the Iewes dispersed saith, The tongue is inflamed of Gehenna. But the rest of the Apostles, that instructed the Gentiles, neuerGehenna not vsed in speaking to the Gentiles. vsed that word, which the heathen at that time did not vnderstand; but where occasion so required, they retained the word hades, and applied it to the place of torment, and to the ruler thereof, which things were not strange to the Gentiles. Since then the Euangelist and Apostles neuer ment to confirme or continue the erroneous fansies of the Pagans, and yet vsed their words; it is euident they vnderstood so much by these wordes, as was not repugnant to the Christian faith. Now hades with the Pagans was a place vnder the earth, where the wicked after this life were punished. This was agreeable to the trueth, and for that cause the Apostles retained that sense and force of the word. That the soules of the iust were also kept vnder the earth in rest and ease; this was the error of the heathen; though both Iewes and Christians lighted afterwardes on that fansie. This the Apostles doe not ratifie in vsing the word hades, for that it was not consonant to the grounds of true religion, from which they neuer ment to depart by vsing any wordes accustomed among the heathen. And as the Gentiles, before they beleeued, vsed hades for the chiefe ruler of those Infernall places, so doth Saint Iohn not refuse to attribute that name to the diuell in his Reuelation. And so without your conceits or discourses we haue shortly and plainely the cause and course why and how the Canonicall writers concurred with the Grecians in vsing the word hades, and yet corrected their error. Howbeit I thinke the Apostles had chiefe respect

to the Septuagint, who translating the Hebrew into Greeke (then rife in many learned mens handes) and expressing there the sense of Sheôl, vsed Hades, for the death of the bodie in the graue, and for the death of the soule in hell: after whose example the sacred writers of the new Testament speaking of the wicked, or ioyning death with hades, note what hades is besides the death of the bodie, which they intend by Thanatos. And therefore though Hades in the old Testament import the places of death for bodie and soule, I meane the graue, and hell; yet throughout the new Testament that word being alwayes opposed to heauen, applied to the wicked, or connexed with other wordes that signifie the death of the bodie, it must of force be taken for the power and place that killeth the soules of all men approching it, except onely Christs, to whom all powers and principalities in heauen and earth and hell were and are submitted and subiected.
            
               Defenc. pag. 181. li. 17. 
               Hitherto wee haue tried the nature and vse of Hades, and haue found it to bee not properly hell, as you auouch; no, not when it is applied to soules of men deceased. And therefore also that it cannot be so vnderstood in Acts 2.27. where it is applied to Christs soule after he was dead: which yet is the onely place you haue to pretend.] Hitherto you haue prated, what pleased you, and proued nothing; and notwithstanding your vaine euasions meere priuations, inuincible conditions, and plaine visible contradictions, Hades is found by the full consent of Christian and heathen writers to bee a place vnder the earth and in darkenesse; where the soules of the dead adiudged to that place were and are detained vnder the Dominion of the Diuell, though the Pagans in their wandering from their trueth, imagined him to be a God, and dreampt of earthly pleasures there, to comfort their deiected spirits against the terror of death. And since Christs soule was not left in hades after death, as appeareth, Acts 2.31. what haue you, or any man liuing to say, why Christs descent to Hades, that is (as the Gospell expoundeth this word) to the 
               Lucae. 16. 
               place of torment, (of which it was impossible for him to be held, or to bee therewith touched,) should not bee iustly grounded on this place? [wee may
               Defenc. pag. 181. li. 27. 
               simply take hades for the inuisible state or place of the deceased.] If for the place, then for heauen, where you say Christes soule was after death. And would Christ so greatly reioice that his soule should not be left in heauen? [Ibidem li. 31. 
               Otherwise we may take it simply for deaths force and power, supplying also the same wordes eis ton topon, or tên chôran hadou, in that place where the power and strength of death preuaileth and holdeth the deceased
               How the defender wauereth about Hades. 
               soules from their bodies.] You haue so many senses, that you haue neuer a good. First you tooke hades for a state or place, and then you supplied it, as indeed you must, with topon or choran, a place or region. And so your sense went round like a wheele. Thou wilt not leaue my soule in the place of place, or state which is not seene; that is not in heauen. Now you renew your strength to take better hold; and saie, Thou wilt not leaue my soule to the place of deaths power. Where we must note, that heauen (for there was Christes soule, as you grant) is by you appointed to be the place of deaths power, and so you haue brought vs the strength and power of death and darknesse preuailing in heauen, and euen on Christes soule. [Ibidem li. 35. 
               This is the world of the dead implying nothing else but an estate opposite to our visible state in this world.] Are the places or states of heauen and hell nothing, but an opposition to our visible estate in this world? There are bodies both in heauen and in hell by the consent of the best Diuines, new and old. How then is their state opposite to our visible state? Moses and Elias were seene talking with Christ in the mount. What place will you appoint for them since they were visible? And if the world of the dead be nothing else but an estate opposite to our visible estate, then Christ after his resurrection relapsed often to hades, & to the world of the dead; for he was inuisible to all men as long as he staied on earth, but when and where he was pleased to shew himselfe. And if that be true which you your selfe doe say, that l 
               in very deed hades hath properly but a priuatiue
               Defenc. pag. 17.8 li. 35. 
               sense, and not any thing positiue in it, then your additions of place and region be repugnant to the nature of hades, except you can bring vs a place and region of meere priuations, in which is nothing positiue; and consequently your varieties and expositions

of hades be meere illusions, and haue nothing in them but lies and mockeries. For hades is a place below in the earth, and darke by condition, as wherein nothing is seene, as both Christians and Pagans affirme. Hades therefore is no mecre priuation. If the soule of Christ then after death were in hades, it was not at the same time in heauen, for heauen is opposite throughout the Scriptures to hades; and your owne common and inuisible place of both is a priuate and palpable errour of your owne.
            
               Defenc. pag. 182. li. 1. li. 10. 
               Last of all we may take Hades heere by a prosopopaea conceauing it to be (as it were) some person of vnresistable power taking away & withholding from hence all mens soules departed. This last way is not the vnlikeliest.] You haue created vs new places of meere priuations, which neuer were, now you take vpon you to create some new persons of vnresistable power; and all this you confesse is your conceauing and drawing Saint Lukes wordes whither you list. But what hath the Christian faith to doe with these monstrous and impious conceits of yours? For euen here, where you speake of Christ, you conceaue as it were, some person of vnresistable power, which you call hades, that did and doth take his and all mens soules from hence. Had hades any power ouer Christ, which he could not resist? Will you beginne to play the Manichee in conceauing a power of euill vnresistable to the Sonne of God? and why runne you hunting after strange senses and significations of the word hades, when you haue the same Canonicall writer whose wordes you would interpret, expounding this very word in the Gospel, which he likewise wrote, as well as he did the Acts of the Apostles? The 
               Luk. 16. vers. 23. 
               place of torment, where the rich man was punished after death, Saint Luke in his Gospell expresly calleth 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , hades. Would you wish any better expositor of Saint Lukes wordes, then Saint Luke himselfe, who telleth you that he calleth the place of torment for the wicked after this life by the name of Hades? Put his owne exposition to his owne words, and you may soone see the trueth; if you haue not sworne to resist it. Thou wilt not leaue my soule in hades, that is the place of torment for the wicked. Against this exposition, though it be Saint Lukes, you bend your wittes; and though you feare no shadowes, as you told vs euen now, hauing hades for your helper, yet you catch after shadowes, and cannot see the light of trueth, you beate your braines so much about figures and phrases, which haue no warrant but in your slender conceit and slipperie tongue. Howbeit let vs heere them, since you rest so assured of them.
            
               Defenc. pag. 182. li. 13. 
               You obiect we must not make a figuratiue sense but where manifest need is. Heere is no need of a figuratiue sense: therefore heere ought to be no sigure to be supposed. I answer: First we graunt your conclusion. Whether of the two former waies we take hades, there is simply no figure at all therein.] If you take hades for the place, where soules after this life are kept in darknesse and destruction vnder the earth, you make no figure indeed by the verdict of holy Scriptures; else, take it how you will, it is a figure, or a meere fiction of yours, which is woorse then a figure. For since hades by your confession is originally the place, where nothing is seene, if you take hades either for the state of soules in that place, or for the power, or person of him who is ruler of that place, you do neither of these without a figure. As for the priuation of this life, which must vsually be precedent before a man can goe to that place, because it is a place for the dead and not for the liuing, (some onely excepted, who descended to hades aliue); That is a passage to the place or state of hades, it is not the place or state of it selfe, since either of these is positiue and not meerely priuatiue, and expresseth the condition of soules receaued in that place, and not onely the want of this life. As for one common place or state of all soules deceased, this is your vnwise fansie, which hath no ground either in diuinity or humane learning, by reason you take the forsaking and lacking of this life, for a state or place of men departed, in which no man staieth; but is presently caried by angels good or badde, to the places of receit, where they remaine in ioy or paine, according to the difference of their mansions, which are either heauen or hell.
            
               Defenc. pag. 182. li. 18. 
               Then your owne sense of hell in this place is cleane ouerthrowen by your selfe. For whensoeuer Hades or Sheól doe signifie hell, it is indeed by a figure Synecdoche, where the whole

is set for a part, which I haue prooued at large before, and particularly by Tremellius a sufficient man for his Hebrew skill.] Of Sheol Tremellius speaketh, of Hades he saith nothing; and his rule concerneth the vse of that word in the old Testament, where Sheol importeth both the graue and hell, he speaketh not of the new Testament, where hades is distinguished in manifest wordes from Thanatos, death; and is by Saint Iohn made consequent after death. Since then hades in Saint Lukes wordes is a different thing from the death of Christes flesh, which was not left in corruption, and a place appointed for the soules adiudged to torments after this life, as appeareth by his Gospell; I make no figure in these wordes, Thou wilt not leaue my soule in hell, for all your large brags and weake proofes. And yet when I spake of no figuratiue sense, I thereby excluded all metaphoricall significations of the word hades, and not Synecdoche which admitteth the sense to be proper as well in a part as in the whole.
            
               Defenc. pag 182. li. 24. 
               Thirdly it seemeth conuenient, and also likelie to take hades heere by a Prosopopaea after our third sense before noted. Which kinde of figure supposeth as it were a person of that thing which otherwise the word properly signifieth.] He that careth for no trueth, may new cast the Scriptures into what sense he will by emptie figures. To take the place for the persons possessing it, is not vnusuall in the Scriptures. And so S. Iohn saith, Reuel. 20. 
               Hades (shall be) cast into the lake of fire, meaning the diuell and his angels, and not your emphaticall power of death. But this is nothing to Saint Lukes words, thou wilt not leaue my soule in hades, since it can haue no sense, that Christes soule should not be left in the diuell. The rest of the places, which heere you repeate, and apply them with seeming to your senses, we shall haue occasion after to rippe vp: there we shall speake farder of them. In the meane space you will prooue without figures, that in the words of Saint Luke expressing Dauids sentence, pag. 182. li. 38. 
               there ought of necessitie to be vnderstoode a figuratiue sense. 
               & pag. 183. li. 1. 
               For take them literally (as I doe) and they impugne the grounds of faith and charitie, which is sufficient to cause a figuratiue sense in the Scriptures.] I maruell all this while, that hauing so sound exceptions against the literall sense, as you talke of, you spend so much time in trifles, and let the maine matters alone. This is woorth the hearing if you can performe what you promise: otherwise a mountaine doth hatch a mouse, which the prouerbe telleth you will mooue laughter. But how doth the sense, which I giue, impugne faith and charitie?
            
               Defenc. pag. 183. li. 5. 
               Verily this your sense implyeth by the way and consequently, that a good and sinnelesse man (yea the best that euer was) woorthie of Paradise and the highest heauens, yet after death did goe to hell. And further that being in heauen, yet staied not there (as you say) but immediately came out againe to goe to hell. Againe that an humane soule being in the depth of hell, yet should feele no paines; and that being locally in hell, it should come out thence also: What can be more against the generall rules of the Scriptures then these things?] You haue laboured heard, and caught a herring. With much a doe you haue found at length, that Christ was a good man; he is more beholding to you now then afore, when you told vs, he was all defiled, accursed, and hatefull to God for and with our sinnes. Your leasure did not serue you to thinke, that he was also the true and eternall Sonne of God; and therefore no force of death or hell could preuaile on his body or soule, farder then he was willing for the declaration of his humilitie, and manifestation of his power and glorie. Is it against your faith and charitie, that Phil. 2. 
               all knees of those in heauen and earth, and hell, should stoupe and bow to the humane nature of the sonne of God? Is your Creed so crazed, that you can not beleeue that Christ rising 
               Coloss. 2. 
               spoiled Principalities and powers, and made an open shew of them; triumphing ouer them in his owne person? Is grace so farre gone from you, that you may not endure to heare that Christ Ephes. 4. 
               descended first into the lower parts of the earth, and then ascended (againe) on hie, and ledde captiuitie captiue, and gaue gifts to men, whereof deliuerance and freedome from all power and danger of hell and Satan were not the last nor least? But he was a man you say, though a good man, and therefore you thinke he must be subiected to the same straights, that other mortall and sinnefull men are, to feele paines in hell, and not to come out from thence.] This, which you call faith, is infidelitie

against the Sonne of God, whiles you seeke to tie him with the same chaines of darknesse and weakenesse, wherewith wicked and sinnefull men are tied, that are adiudged to euerlasting damnation. To be condemned to hell is for misbeleeuers and misliuers; to destroy the power and strength of hell was meete only for the manhood of the Sonne of God. That he felt no paines there, and returned thence, were the smallest parts of his glorious triumph ouer hell and Satan. It was impossible as Peter teacheth, that the paines of death or hell should take hold on him, and his soule could not be left there. As for comming out of heauen to goe to hell to subdue and destroy the same, what more inconuenience is in that, then in comming from heauen to the graue, there to take vp his body, when he restored it to life? that wicked men condemned to hell cannot come thence, nor find ease there, I find it testified in the parable of the rich man and Lazarus; that the Sonne of God in his humane soule could not goe thither without abiding there for euer, and suffering the paines of hell as well as others; I find no such grounds in all the Scriptures. He saith of himselfe,Reuel. 1. 
               I haue the keies of hell and of death; that is all power and command ouer them. He had power then not onely to free himselfe from your faithlesse doubts and dangers in hell, but to free all his elect from thence, and to1. Co

                  . 15. 
               subiect all things, and enemies (and so the strength and rage of hell and Satan) vnder his feet. If the trueth of God bind you to beleene, that an Angell comming downe from heauen, cast the Dwell into the bottomlesse pit, and there bound him, and loosed him, as he was prescribed; doth not your faith serue you to confesse, that all power in heauen and in earth, and much more in hell, was giuen vnto Christ; and that as well ouer rebellious Diuels, as obedient Angels, who adored him when he was brought into the world, and serued him the time that he was in the world, and are not stronger then his humane nature, but receaue power from him as being personally God and Man? these be the grounds not of faith, but of ignorance, which faile vnder your feete, and shew that you build on Sand, which hath no force, when it commeth to be sifted.
            From the grounds of faith, which are none, you come to the circumstances of the place it selfe, and say, they are all against me; but I that hitherto haue tried you so false conceited in euery thing, will not trust you to be true-tonged in this, whatsoeuer you pretend.Sermo. pag. 169. li. 10. 
               These wordes (of Dauid) thou wilt not leaue my soule in hades, nor suffer thine holy one to see corruption; I said, conteined a speciall prerogatiue verified in none, but in the true Messias and Sauiour of the world. To this you replie, [Defenc. pag. 183. li. 25. 
               I denie it, heere is no such prerogatiue mentioned.] It is all one skill in you to denic trueths, and affirme falsehoodes: you cannot doe the one without the other. And heere your fansies thrung so fast one on another, that they thrust ech other out of doores. [The maine scope of Saint Peters purpose in this place you doe not, or will not vnderstand, and on that error you build the rest of your reasons, which are all erroneous like the roote whence they come. Saint Peter, you say,Defenc. pag. 18. li. 37. & 17. 
               intending onely in all this speach to shew the Iewes, that this Iesus whom they had slame was not now dead, but risen againe, plainely graunteth all this matter of Dauid, as well as of Christ.] Heere are two monstrous falseshoods, on which all the rest of your running reasons are setled. It had been to small purpose for Peter to prooue to the Iewes, that Christ by them slaine was raised from the graue and restored to life, if there he had rested, or intended that onely as you stifly auouch: what could he by this haue inferred more touching Christ, then any man might likewise of Lazarus, whom Christ raised from the graue? This therefore was not Peters scope, he had an higher and farder reach in that long Sermon of his, which he throughly expresseth afterward, and that was: Therefore let all the house of Israel know for a suertie, that God

               hath made him both LORD AND CHRIST, this Iesus (I say) whom ye haue crucified. To conclude this, Peter doth not reason so weakely, as you imagine; Christs soule is ioined againe to his body, though they crucified him; ergo, Christ is the true Messias and Sauiour of the world. This were like one of your reasons, which haue nor head nor taile. But Peter endued with the holy Ghost, reasoned verie truely and sufficiently, and in effect thus. The prophesie of Dauid which neuer was nor could be fulfilled

in any, no not in Dauid himselfe, but onely in the Messias, that his soule should not be left in hades, nor his flesh see corruption, is fulfilled in Christ, whom you crucified: he is risen Lord of all his enemies in his owne person, the sorrowes of death being losed before him; he is ascended vp to heauen, as Dauid likewise foretold of him, and there sitteth at the right hand of God, vntill all his enemies in the rest of his members be made his footstoole; and thence hath he shed forth this, which you now see and heare, euen the promise of the holy Ghost receaued of the Father for all his. Know ye therefore for a suertie, that God hath made him both Lord ouer all in heauen, earth, and hell; and Christ, euen the annointed Sauiour of all his elect. Against this illation neither all the miscreants in earth, nor all the Diuels in hell can open their mouths. Where first we may see, that Peter resteth more on the manner and power of Christs resurrection, then simply on this, that his soule was reunited to his body, from which by death it was seuered. Secondly, he bringeth the words of Dauid to shew, that either part of the Messias submitted to death for the time, was to returne againe to life with greater glory; the flesh free from all corruption, the soule superiour to all destruction. Thirdly, that these things neither were, nor could be verified in Dauid, since Dauid saw corruption, as his sepulchre prooued remaining to that day, and Dauid was not as then ascended to heauen, much lesse made Lord ouer all his enemies.

               Heere is no such prerogatiue mentioned.] If this were common to Christ with Dauid and others of the faithfull, how could Peter hence conclude, that this was not spoken of Dauid but onely of the Messias? Againe if this were no prerogatiue, what need was there, that Dauid should be a Prophet by speciall reuelation to know this much? and that which Dauid knew, was not onely this that Christ should rise to life againe, but the words are, thatAct. 2. v. 30. 
               God would raise vp Christ (after death) to set him on his throne; that is, to giue him an euerlasting kingdome, euen all power in heauen and earth, subiecting all his enemies vnder his feet. So that simply to rise from death was no prerogatiue, nor proper to Christ; but to rise Lord ouer all, death and hell not excepted, this was peculiar to Christ, and not common to him with Dauid; and therefore must needes be a speciall priuiledge to the manhood of Christ, which is expressed chiefly in these words, Thou wilt not forsake my soule in hades, but bring me thence conquerer of all mine enemies.

               You adde, no flesh (dead) was euer free from corruption but onely Christes, what then? ergo his soule was in hell?] Why winch you, where no man toucheth you? doth any man say Christes soule was in hell, because his flesh saw no corruption, or rather that Dauids wordes are as plaine and peculiar to Christ in the one, that Christes soule was not forsaken in hell; as in the other, that God would not suffer his flesh to see corruption? and both being affirmed of Christ by way of speciall prerogatiue, why should not both be likewise performed in Christ? [li. 38. 
               were not some being dead raised to life againe, before their flesh putrified?] The promise of God to Christ, that his flesh should not seeChristes flesh could not putrifie. corruption, doth not onely assure a speedie resurrection, but an impossibilitie, that any corruption could preuaile against his flesh: since the returne of his flesh to dust, to which all others are iudged, would bee the dissolution of his person, for the time, which by no meanes might befall him, his Godhead being vnited vnto flesh, and not vnto dust. In these words therefore of Dauid, the soule and bodie of Christ were appointed to be superiour to all contrarie powers, that is the soule to hell, the flesh to the graue; and from both was Christ to rise as subduer of both, that he might sit on his heauenly Throne, as Lord ouer all, not by promise onely as before, but by proofe also, as appeared in his resurrection. And yet so many dayes, as Christ did, lyeth no man in his graue without some taint of corruption, which in Christ was vtterly none.

Againe, hades in the new Testament is neuer taken for the death of the bodie, since it is annexed to bodily death, as a consequent after it: and so your acception of it is repugnant to the trueth of the Scriptures. And where you will at no time haue Hades taken for Paradise, Heauen, or Hell, as here you pretend; when you thereby note the place of soules deceased, meane you they are neither in Heauen, Paradise, nor Hell? are you not a wise man to talke so much of an inuisible place; and when you come to the point, you will haue it no place at all? but you referre it alwayes to the generall state of the dead, and no farder immediately.] An inuisible place you referre immediately to no place, and thus when you will be frantike or foolish, words shall loose their proper and plaine signification, and containe no more then pleaseth you. Shew vs a place, where soules deceased are besides Paradise, Heauen, and Hell; and wee will graunt, you may exclude these three by some pretence, when you spake of the place of hades: but if you cannot, then topos aides, a place vnseene, which you haue so much bowled at, will be a place in spite of your heart, and that immediately; and consequently will bee Paradise, Heauen, or Hell, whatsoeuer you presume or dreame to the contrarie.

               The text saith, God raised him vp, loosing the sorrowes of death; because it was impossible for him to be holden fast of it. Will you conclude from hence: ergo there were present sorrowes
               How Christ loosed the sorrowes of death. 
               in the place where Christ was? there is no strength in this reason.] There is more strength in it, then either you will acknowledge, or can answere. The sorrowes of bodily death are all dissolued by the separating of the soule from the bodie. Then after death there are no sorrowes of bodily death. But God raised vp Christ, loosing the sorrowes of (Hades or) death. The sorrowes of death (by Peters wordes) were then loosed, when Christ was raised, because it was not possible for him to be held thereof. So that this pertaineth nothing to the sorrowes, which he felt dying; they ended all with death; but the sorrowes of an other death, euen of death in hell, were loosed when he was raised, because it was not possible for that kind of death to take hold on him. Your two or three things, wherewith you would shift of the Apostles wordes, doe you no good. That God 
               li 32. 
               loosed death from him, are not the Apostles wordes; you make a gloze vpon your owne wordes, and not vpon the Apostles. Such libertie you take to change the text to serue your turne. The next is farder of from the reference of Peters words. God loosed the sorrowes of death (or Hades) at Christs rising, that is say you, because his death had beene most painefull, before his Soule was seuered from his body. So Peter talketh of Christs rising, and you wrest it to Christs dying on the Crosse. And here your hebraisme will not steede you. For God did not loose the sorrowfull death of Christ on the Crosse at his rising, but at his dying. And therefore you are wider of, then you were before. Thus then it followeth euen by the Text, that there were sorrowes in Hades, where Christ was, but they could not take hold of him. The sorrowes of Hades must needes be the sorrowes in Hades: otherwise if they were not in Hades, they were not the sorowes of Hades. As the ioyes of heauen are in heauen; so the sorrowes of Hades must be in Hades, where Christ was, and not where Christ was not.

Kratcisthai hath many significations, amongst others itWhat Kratcisthai signifie signifieth to touch, to take, to hold; and in the the new Testament it is specially obserued by those, that are learned, that it signifieth, prehendere or tenere, to take, or to hold.

[If he were in them, I thinke he should haue felt them.] The Scripture saith his soule was not left

               , in (the place of) Hades: it speaketh not there of the sorrowes of Hades, as if Christ were not forsaken in them. But God, as Peter saith, loosed them, when he raised Christ; that is, hee made Christ the subduer and dissoluer of them at his resurrection. [li. 27.

Thus he readeth, solutis doloribus Inferni, quia impossibile erat teneri cum in illis: God raised vp Christ loosing the sorrowes of hell, because it was impossible he should be held in them. But the text hath loosing the sorowes of death, seeing it was impossible he should be holden fast, or strongly holden of it. Seeing therefore he fayled in expressing the text, no maruaile if his collection from it were wide.] He that neuer saw water but the Themes, will thinke there is none other Sea. You neuer looke neither to the diuerse readings, nor significations of wordes in the new Testament, and that maketh you so hastely to pronounce, that Ibidem li. 33. 
               Austins collection hath no ground nor reason in the text, but is wholly disprooued by it. Austen followed the auncient and receiued translation of the Church in his time, and missed not so much, as you imagine. For that Text hath two readings, some bookes hauing Thanátou death,Many Greeke copies haue the sorrowes of Hades. some hauing Hadou, which the old translator calleth infernum, the places below, or hell. Peruse the new Testament in Greeke of the larger volume printed by Robert Steuen at Paris Anno 1550. and see whether he put not Hadou ouer right this place in the margine, as standing yet in many copies. The Greeke Bible printed at Frankford, Anno 1596. consesseth the like varietie of reading. Athanasius vseth sometimes Athanas. in passion. & crucem Domini. 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

and loosed the sorrowes deshiul (of Shool which Saint Luke calleth hades) because it was impossible he should be detained bashiul, (in Sheol or hades). The Arabicke translator doth the like. He retaineth in the same verse the word

               God raised him vp, and scattered the sorrowes of perditien, because it was not possible that he should be cōquered of perdition. Where Iunius plainly yeeldeth, that this word in Arabicke answereth the Greeke word f

            You quarrell also with the translation, which Austen followed, for saying, in illis in

                them; though that be the right intent of the text; and you sticke not to straine Peters words to what higth you list. So that you keepe the words, and alter the sense; and Austen keepeth the sense, though he vary somewhat from the words. For that was loosed, of which it was impossible Christ should be held, and euen therefore was it to be loosed, because he could not be held therein. But the sorrowes of death or hell were loosed. It was therefore impossible Christ should be held of them; I meane of the sorrowes of either. The sense then is rightly and aptly taken, though the plurall be put in stood of the singular; and Caluin himselfe in respect of the sense retaineth that change, though the words doe somewhat differ from the text.

               In this sense Peter saith, Christ rose, the sorowes of death being loosed,

                  a quibus impossibile erat ipsum tenert, of which (sorrowes) it was impossible he should be held. Now if you or any man els can find vs those sorrowes after Christs bodily death, we are readie to heare you, for they were loosed, when Christ was raised: but if you cannot, as in vaine you haue profered to doe, then must the words be expounded, that though the soule of Christ after death were in hades, euen in the place of torment, where it was not left nor forsaken; yet the sorowes thereof could not touch him, but he loosed and scattered them, when he was raised to immortality, and heauenly power and glory.

               Quamobrem teneamus firmissimè, quod fides habet fundatissima authoritate sirmata, quia Christus mortuus est secundum Scripturas, & quia sepultus est, & quia resurrexit tertia die secundum Scripturas & cetera quae de illo testatissima veritate conscripta sunt. In quibus etiam hoc est, quod apud inferos fuit, solutis eorum doloribus, quibus eum erat impossibile teneri. Wherefore let vs most firmely hold that, which our faith hath being confirmed by most grounded authority, as that Christ died according to the Scriptures, and was buried, and rose the third day according to the Scriptures, and the rest of those things, which are written of him in trueth most cleerely testified. Amongst which this is also one point, that he was in hell, and loosed the sorrowes thereof, of which it was impossible he should be held. This is such a resolution, that if you were soberly minded, and not phantastically conceited, as well in doctrine as in Discipline, you would beware how you crossed the faith of the whole Church without more pregnant and euident matter, then you haue any; and not thinke it enough to shift with Poeticall fansies, metaphoricall senses, and palpable contrarieties, and falsities, such as few men would fall into besides your selfe. And as for the exposition of Peters wordes, which Austen leaueth indifferent, if it dislike any man; that concerneth the place of Peters first Epistle the third Chapter, beginning at the 18. verse, How Christ in spirit went, and preached vnto the spirits in prison, who were disobedient in the daies of Noe: Which was the question proposed to him by Euodius, to whom he wrote his 99. Epistle. And of that he saith.Ibidem epistola 99. 
               Consider yet, least happely all that which Peter speaketh of spirits closed in prison, which beleeued not in the daies of Noe, omnino ad inferos non pertineat, sed ad illa potius tempora, quorum formam ad haec tempora transtulit: pertaine not at all to hell, but to those times, which Peter compareth with these times. And after large discoursing how that comparison might stand, he concludeth with your words. This exposition of Peters words, if it dislike any, or doe not satisfie, quaerat ea
               In fine epistolae 99. 
               secundum Inferos intelligere, let him seeke (in Gods Name) how to fit the things (there written) to them in hell. So that his exposition subiected to other mens liking, did not concerne hell at all, nor Christs preaching there, but the preaching of repentance in the daies of Noah by the spirit of Christ; and if any man liked not that exposition of Peters words, he might seeke how to make Peters words agree with things done in hell, if he could tell how to performe it.

               Moe circumstances of this text (Acts 2.) do make affirmatiuely for vs: first Peter plainly graunteth all this matter of Dauid, as wel as of Christ.] But that I am well acquainted with your pertinacie, I should muze at this insolencie. Peter doth exactly proue, that this prophesie was neuer verified in Dauid, because Dauids flesh saw corruption, as was euident by hisActs 2. v. 29. 
               Sepulchre remaining with them to that day. Since then it was not true of Dauids person, that he saw no corruption; he spake this as aIbid. ver. 30. 
               Prophet, knowing that God had sworne to raise vp Christ concerning the flesh, to set him vpon his throne. You may doe well to leaue this outfacing Scriptures and Fathers, it may seeme a shift for a time, but it will end with your shame. [Defenc pag. 186. li. 24. 
               By the whole text it is euident Peter had no reason nor purpose to speake to the Iewes of Christes soule being in hell.] If you may be iudge, Peter shall say nothing, but what hitteth your hand right. It is more then plainHow Christ must rise from the dead. by the whole purport of Peters speech, that he ment to prooue Christ to be raised vp as Lord of all his enemies, and Sauiour of all that obey him. To rise simply from death, was not sufficient to shew the eternitie and soueraigntie of Christs kingdome; but he must be raised as the only Lord, that should sit on Dauids throne, and haue all things in heauen, earth, and hell, subiected vnto him. From our enemies if hee could not deliuer vs, he could be no Sauiour of ours: he must therefore tread them all vnder his feete, when he rose from death, before we could hope to be freed from them by his force. And to this end Peter expresly maketh mention, that God scattered the sorrowes of death and hell before him, when he raised him vp, that all the faithfull might be assured, as Christ conquered and destroied the diuell in his owne person, when he rose from the graue, so he could and would doe the like for all his members by freeing them from the power of Hades, and conforming them to his death and

resurrection. This God had promised to his people by his Prophet, saying: Oseae 13. 
               I will
               The Iewes were promised their Messias should conquer hell. 
               redeeme them from the hand of hell, I will deliuer them from death. O death, I will be thy death. O hell, I will be thy destruction. Repentance is hid from mine eies. This Dauid foretold the Messias should performe, in that his soule should not be forsaken (that is, left destitute of power or honour) no not in hell. Of this deliuerance from their enemies, and from the handes of all that hated them, 
               Lucae 1. 
               spake the Prophets, that were from the beginning of the worlde. This was the oath, that God sware to Abraham, that they being deliuered out of the handes of their enimies, should serue him without feare, of sinne, death, or hell. This the Iewes beleeued, and expected in the Messias; and therefore neither were they, (I meane the elect among them) so Defenc. pag. 186. li 33. 
               ignorant, vnbeleeuing, and stubborne, as you pretend, three thousand being conuerted with this one Sermon: neither was this so strange and vncouth a thing, as you imagine, being so often promised and prophesied vnto them: Neither did Peter intend onely Christes resurrection, as you suppose, his chiefe scope being to shew them the strength and height of Christs heauenly kingdome.

How many points of faith are not subiect to sense? Christes sitting at the right hande of God in glorie, will you not beleeue, because it is not subiect to sense, and without an example of the like, and no figure foreshadowing any such matter? Of Christes ascending to heauen, and his returne to iudge the quicke and the dead, haue you any examples or figures in the whole law? and yet it is no such hard matter to proportion our deliuerance from hell and Satan to the bondage of Israell in Egypt, and the ouerwhelming of Pharoh and all his host in the bottom of the redde sea. The like might be said of Sampsons death, who being weake and bound slew all his enemies; of Dauid, and Goliah, of Daniell in the Lyons denne without harme, of Ionas lying in the Whales bellie, and such like, which though in all things they match not Christs conquest ouer Satan, and the destruction of him and his kingdome, as no figures can do, yet are they resemblances of that which you so much dissemble. Howbeit, as I said, of Christes birth, buriall, descending to Hades, rising, ascending, sitting in heauen, and comming to iudge, the law did not yeeld any expresse and visible figures, as it did of his death and sacrifice.

               We haue seene that Hades hath no such meaning in the Acts; which yet is the only place whereon you build. This were sufficient to end this argument: but yet it shall be good to trie whether any where hades properly signifieth hell. Verily it doth so signifie no where at all in the Scriptures. Yet I graunt it is and ought to be translated hell in two places, Matth. 16. v. 18. Luk. 16. v. 23. not that the word it selfe doth necessarily signifie hell, but because the circumstances heere doe require that meaning as the fittest and best for these particular purposes.] We haue seene you beate your braines about Hades to make it any thing rather then tha tindeed it is both by the generall opinion of all Pagan Poets, and by the constant assertion of all the Greeke Fathers. We haue also seene you turne & winde your selfe, you know not whither; sometimes to haue it the place for soules departed this world, sometimes the state of such soules; sometimes the power of death, and sometimes the priuation of this life; and so to crosse and controle your owne conceits, that you could not tell where to set foote without falling. Now as he that is blinde, maketh no difference betwixt day and night, no more doth your wilfull, yet witlesse imagination perceaue any distance betwixt trueth and falshood. And hauing held your owne so well, that no shifting or shuffling can make you ashamed, you will now proceed to a farder triall of other texts of Scriptures, to see whether you can outface them with your fansies and figures, as you haue done them that be already ouerpast. I make no doubt, but if you may sit sole Iudge in your owne cause, you will quickly pronounceHow hades is vsed in the new Testament. for your selfe; but if you must prooue as well as pronounce, you will make as many errors in your proceedings, as there be holes in a sieue. Howbeit you grant, that in

               two places of the new Testament Hades is and ought to be translated hell, not for that the word of it self doth so necessarily signifie, but because the circumstances require that meaning. Which is as much as if you said, there are two places in the new Testament, where hades is & must be taken for hel; neither can you with all your sleights & shifts auoid the same; the circumstances of the text so euidently demonstrate, the Euangelists tooke hades for hell. This by your leaue is some preiudice to your cause, and a bridle to your boldnesse, that the holy Ghost doth twice in the Gospels by your owne confession vse hades for hell: and why he doth not vse it in that sense in other places, there is no impediment, but your proud will and waste wordes. Saint Luke is so cleere, as no exception can be taken to it, that Luke. 16. 
               Hades is the place of torment after this life; and not one common place for all in paine and rest, with nothing but a ditch betwixt them. So likewise Christ promised, Matth. 16. 
               the gates of hades should not preuaile against his Church; where if you defend, that the godly shall not haue their soules separated from their bodies by death, and yet hell may preuaile against their soules, you maintaine two as manifest lies, as a man may vtter. Spite of your hart therefore, Hades must signifie hell in the 16. of Saint Matthewes Gospell; and so it doth in all other places of the new Testament, though the circumstances of ech place be not so pregnant as these are. And though in the old Testament Zuinglius & Mollerus obserue, The gates of Sheol, and Hades with the Septuagint, may signifie the danger of death approching, when it is referred to the godly, yet Hades in the new Testament neuer signifieth the death of the body, but it is a thing distinguished from it, and consequent to it, as Saint Iohn in plaine words doth witnesse. his name, that sate on the pale horse, was Death, and Hades followed after him (or close to him.)

               The worthie Master Bucer noteth well saying; Diues non simpliciter scribitur esse in hade, sed in gehenna quia in torment is & flammis. The rich is not said to be simply in hades, but also in hell: because he is said to be in fierie torments.] Master Bucere I honor for his learning and Religion, yet not so, that all his words are Gospell, or that I receaue him afore or against all the Fathers. And by his leaue in this place his wordes are out of square. He saith, The Rich man is not simply written to be in Hades; but if mine eyes were matches, when I read Saint Lukes Gospell last, it cannot be more simply written then it is there. Luke. 16.

               , And in Hades, lifting vp his eyes. Now what place Hades is, the Euangelist expresseth, when he saith; being in torments. Had Hades beene vsed alone without explication, men might and would haue questioned this, as they doe other places, where Hades is vsed alone. But Luke noting afterward, what manner of place Hades is, euen a place of Torment, he prooueth exactly that Hades alone without any addition ioyned to it is vsed for hell in the new Testament. [Will you Pag. ibid. 8. 
               conclude from this, as you doe about Abyssus? In the Reuelation and in Luke Abyssus is vsed to signifie Hell. Therefore it signifieth Hell in the Romanes, or therefore euery where properly it signifieth Hell.] If Abyslus be the bottomelesse pit properly, andAbyssus in the new Testament is hell. hell be so called both in the Gospell and in the Reuelation; and no reason can be giuen, why either the graue, or the Sea should properly be called bottomelesse; then since figures are not to be brought into the Scriptures but vpon necessitie, you must shew vs more necessitie, then hitherto you haue done, why hell may not be vnderstood in that place, or else we must cleaue to the naturall sense of the word, and leaue your figures, till you can better fasten them. That Abyssus may metaphorically be applied to other things, I neuer denied; but in Saint Pauls words to the Romans you must shew vs a pit, that properly is bottomlesse and opposite to heauen; and to which Christ descended, before you can exclude hell as not ment by the Apostle in that place. But of this I haue spoken before, whither I referre you for fuller answere Ibid. li. 11. 
               death sometimes is the 2 death, ergo, it is so Acts 2. 24.] The sorrowes of the first death end with this life, and in the graue there is neither sorrow nor sense. But the sorrowes of that death, which Peter ment, were loosed at Christs rising to life. Those were therefore the sorrowes of another death, which must be the second death, which were loosed and scattered with Christs resurrection. Againe the text hath there a double reading;

               death or hades. Then that death must be vnderstood, which is in hades, and not the sorrowes and paines, which are in this life; since hades by your owne confession is a state opposite to the world. Thirdly, the loosing of the sorrows of that death which Peter there intended, prooueth Christ to be Lord of all. But a simple rising vnto life againe prooueth no such thing. That therefore was neither pertinent nor sufficient for Peters purpose.

               Next let vs consider, and thou Capernaum; which art lift vp to heauen, shalt be brought downe to hades, to destruction. I say hades heere is not hell; but the destruction of Capernaum the city. Christ threatneth the city it selfe with destruction, and razing out from the face of the earth, which he meaneth by hades. The inhabitants the wicked people thereof he threatneth with damnation in hell.] A graue and wise construction. Christ threatneth the stones and timber of the city with hades for not hearing his word, and regarding his miracles. In the 20 verse of this very chapter, where it is said, Matth. 11. vers. 20. 
               Christ began to vpbraid the cities (whereof Capernaum was one) because they repented not; of whom spake Christ of the men, or of the wals of those cities? it may be you will find out repentance for stones; but our Sauiour nameth the place for the persons, which is as vsuall in the Scriptures, as any thing may be. Matth. 23. vers 37. 
               Ierusalem, Ierusalem, which killest the Prophets, and stonest those, that be sent vnto thee. Christ speaketh not there of the housen, but of the Inhabitants. So doth he heere; for neither were the stones of this city capable of repentance, nor exalted vp to heauen, nor intelligent of Christs words or works, nor punishable at the day of iudgement; all which things Christ heere ascribeth to Capernaum. Then if the stones of Capernaum were not exalted to heauen, they were not threatned by Christ, to be depressed downe to hades. And so hades heere was not threatned to the place, but to the persons. Now the persons by your owne confession, and by the righteous iudgement of Christ, were threatned with damnation in hell. Hades then in these words of Christ doth exactly signifie hell, and implieth as much as followeth in the next verse; It shalbe easier for the land of Sodom in the day of iudgement, then for thee; Which is likewise spoken to the city, though ment of the vnbeleeuers there. Now if we make the former words interrogatiue, as some Greek copies haue them, and the Latin translator putteth them, And thou Capernaum wilt thou be exalted to heauen? You must giue will to stones, as well as sense, before these wordes can agree to the city it selfe. The Gospell of Saint Matthew translated into the Hebrew tongue long before Saint Ieroms time, (if it were not written in Hebrew by the Euangelist himselfe, as Ierom thinketh,) thus expresseth the words of our Sauiour.Hiero. de scriptur.

And if that which you haue said all this while, haue any trueth in it, that hades is the priuation of this life or power of death; had the stones of Capernaum euer any life, that they might be depriued of it, and come vnder the power of death?

destruction in steede of perfection. The like wrong you offer to Plutarke, whose name you abuse without either word or syllable sounding towards your intent, as if you ment to ouerthrow the whole world to enlarge your hades.

               Thus it seemeth Moses also vseth Sheol, when he saith men, women, children and cattell aliue, yea houses and riches went to Sheol.] If Moses had sayd so, calling that vast and deepe gulfe of the earth, into which the tents and stuffe of Corah and his companieThe defender proueth Moses and Dauid to haue a Sheol for sheepe and cattell. fell, Sheol; yet vnlesse you can prooue, that the citie of Capernaum was in like sort swallowed vp (housen and implements aswell as men) in the same deepe gulfe of the earth, Moses Sheol maketh nothing for the ruine and destruction of cities, where the buildings thereof fall to the ground, and lie on the ground, as in decayes they doc. But though you were both with Plato and Plutarke, thinking it no sinne to father your fansies on them, you may not doe the like with Moses without more blame then you will willingly beare. Moses hath no such wordes, that houses and riches went to Sheol, but they were swallowed vp in the cleft of the earth, as well as the rest; yet nothing went to Sheol, saue what was liuing, because the Scripture saith, they descended aliue to Sheol. Now if you can proue tents and houshold-stuffe to be aliue, you may chance to say somewhat, though not much, for your destroying Hades; but if that be false and absurd, then haue you no words in Moses to proue that riches went to Sheol or Hades. The words of Moses are plaine enough, and exclude as well your cattell, as your cofers from Hades. Nnmb. 16. vers. 30. 
               If the earth open her mouth, and swallow them; and all that they haue, and they descend aliue to Sheol, you shall know that these men haue prouoked the Lord. Themselues descended aliue to Sheol, the rest was swallowed vp by the earth. vers 31.

               And they descended, and all (the men) that pertained to them, aliue to Sheol. Who pertained to them, the Scripture expresseth before, namely their wiues, their children, and their families. All their goods were swallowed vp in the gulfe of the earth, but of the men that were liuing and belonging to them, and not of their cattell, the Scripture saith; they descended aliue to Sheol.
            
            That they had any cattell at this time saue for sacrifices, it cannot be prooued: they did eate no flesh of beasts, nor 6.

               It seemeth, & this may be; and yet with these you patch vp your predicament of Hades to containe all things, euen stones, cattell, and sheepe. But hath this any seeming worth the speaking of, that because Dauid saith of the wicked, like sheepe they lie in Sheol; you should conclude, ergo there be sheep in Sheol? you need not feare my turning of this to the worst, I cannot well turne it to worse, then it is. The wise man

saith, Ecclesiast. 4. 
               be not like a Lion in thine owne house. Doth that inferre euery man to haue Lions in his house? Psal. 28. 
               Thy children, saith the Psalmist, shalbe like oliue plants round about thy table. Hath euery good man therefore Oliue plants about his table? The wicked be in Sheol like sheepe; that is, either Matth. 22. 
               bound hand and foote, and cast into vtter darkenesse, as sheepe are bound by all foure, when they are prepared for the slaughter; or voide of reason and vnable to helpe themselues like sheepe. That the word Sheol standeth next to sheepe in the Hebrew, and the verbe commeth after, Like sheepe in Sheol shall they be put; is the occasion, but no iustification of your error; since the verbe (they shall be laid or put) hath no sense at all, except you repeate Sheol with the preposition after it, and say; they shalbe laid in Sheol like sheepe. So that vnlesse you will bee more then like a sheepe, you must leaue this kind of collecting.
            Your quoting of the Prophet Abacuk, and of the Prouerbes to shew that all things are in Hades, because neither Hades nor death can bee satisfied, is much like your sheepe in Sheol. Doe proud men couet chaulke and chibols, because in the same verseThe defenders most absurd proofes for his Sheol of all things. it is said, they can be no more satisfied, then death and Sheol? I winne not; but rather as death and Sheol cannot be satisfied with bodies, and soules of men, which are things by them desired and receiued, no more can the proud oppressour be satisfied with the spoiles of many countries, but seeketh Abac. 2. v. 5. 
               to gather vnto him all nations, and to heape vnto him all people, euen as death and Sheol doe. The place of the Prouerbes, which you bring, ioyneth with Sheol

               a barren wombe; and the earth, which cannot bee satisfied with water. And thence you can no more conclude, that all kind of creatures are in Sheol, then that they are in a womans wombe, which is barren. And but that I see men loose their wits, aswell as their senses in Hades, I should much maruaile, what were become of yours all this while, that speake not onely so impertinently and vntowardly, but so absurdly and ridiculously, that men will stoppe their eares for very shame, if you will not stoppe your mouth.

               Yet we must comeneerer. You alleage two friuilous proofes of sheols signifying hell: viz. when it hath opposition to beauen, and situation as the lowest. For the situation of hell it is a secret, which Gods word hath not reuealed at all. Neither ought we to determine, as you very rashly doe, if hell be any where, there can be no doubt, but it must be in the lower parts of the earth.] You, that haue ranged so farre both from the trueth, and from the matter in question, had need at length come somewhat neerer. The proofes produced by me, that Sheol, when it is opposed to heauen, or described to be in the lowest parts of the earth, importeth hell, are not so friuolous as your follie maketh them, they are grounded on better and surer rules of holy Scriptures, then are your toyes of birds, and beastes in Hades. And first touching the place of hell below in the earth, which you labour to crosse as much as you can; though I before haue shewed the constant opinion of old and new writers, yet can I be content to reason it farder with you, because you and your friends are deuising new hels and heauens, euen as you are hammering of a new Hades. That hell is

Being a place, it must be either in heauen aboue vs, or in earth beneath vs, except you will coyne vs a new Creede and say, God is creator of heauen, & earth, and of hell also, which is neither in heauen nor in earth. But you may not controle the Creede, except you will also correct the Scriptures. For that diuision of the created world into heauen and earth is witnessed in infinite Esa. 37. Iere.

               You know the Apostle mentioneth the Aire, and that on high, as being the place of diuels. Notwithstanding farre be it from me to affirme, that hell certainely is not beneath. Yet your pretended Scriptures are meerely forced to prooue it.] Your are lighted iust on Master Broughtons argument, whose folly hath filled many sheetes afore, and now all his Religion, learning and reasons are emptied in the fourth part of one poore printed sheete of the lesser size of paper. Onely in this he shewed some witte, that he foresaw of such brainesicke stuffe, the least would be the best. But doe you vnderstand (for he is not worthy an answere, who can frame himselfe to nothing but to rage and riddles) that, which the Psalmist saith of the elect Angels; God shall giue his 
               Psal. 91. 
               Angels charge ouer thee, to keepe thee in all thy waies? or which the Apostle saith, Heb. 1. 
               They are all ministring spirits sent foorth for their sakes, which shall be heires of Saluation? Doth this prooue there are no Angels in heauen? I troe not. Their office is here to attend and defend the faithfull, and yet heauen is the place of their habitation, whither they repaire with vnspeakeable celeritie, when their speciall seruice is finished. So the diuels haue hell appointed for the place of their condemnation, and thither they cary, and there they torment the wicked, as also they are commaunded to the deepe, and chained there at Gods becke; notwithstanding some of them are by Gods wisedome and patience permitted to wander in the ayre, and compasse the earth, to tempt the wicked, to trie the godly, to shew their power vpon the creatures, and bewray their malice against the Church of God. Wherefore the ayre and earth are the places of their seeing and assaulting vs, but hell is their home, to be remanded thither vpon any the least occasion, when pleaseth God. The griefe, terror, and torment of their inward confusion, obscuration, malediction, and condemnation they alwaies beare about

them, and within them; being no way freed or eased of that, wheresoeuer they goe; but they are often spared from the place of torment, which is the deepe, that they feare and shun, and yet know they must all thither at last to be terribly and eternally plagued and punished there for all their hatefull impieties and villanies. They therefore (during the time of our warfare & conflict with them,) gouerne the

Then if the wicked dead or aliue descend to this vast deepe and vnknowen gulfe in the earth, whither go they I pray you; to the graue, or to hell? To goe aliue to the graue were somewhat strange, and yet the graue is no deepe nor vnknowen gulfe: but to descend aliue or dead to the bottom of the earth were more stranger, if hell be not ment by that gulfe in the earth. And if no more be ment by descending aliue to Sheol, then to fall aliue into a cleft of the earth & there to die: the terrible iudgement of God executed on Core and his companie for their rebellion, in the sight of all Israell, is vtterly cluded, since to fall into a deepe well or Cole-pit, and there to die, is as great a punishment as they suffered, and is a descending aliue to Sheol, as theirs was.

               Euery opposition betweene Shammaijm the heauens or skies and Sheol doth not signifie the opposition betweene heauen and hell. Shammaijm thus placed signifieth the skies, not the very place of Gods heauenly glory in the presence of God, which in English we call heauen.] When Sheol is opposed is opposed in the Scriptures to Shammaijm, the ground of the oppositionWhy the heauens are compared with hell in the Scriptures. is either the heigth of the one, and the depth of the other; or the glory and felicitie in the one, and destruction and miserie in the other. In those three places, Iob 11. vers. 8. Psal. 139. vers. 8. Amos 9. vers. 2. the perfection, presence, and power of God are expressed to be higher then Shammaijm, and deeper then Sheol. Now doth your religion serue you to restraine any of these three to the skies and the graue, and not to make them superior to the highest heauen, and deeper then the lowest Sheol? Shammaijm, you say, is the skie, as well as the heauen of the blessed. Shammaijm is the ayre also, where birds flie; as well as the skies. Doe you therefore thinke it a meete comparison for the presence or power of God, to say that, if you clime to the top of an high steeple, which standeth in the ayre, the hand of God can reach you there? as though it were enough for the perfection, presence, and power of God to reach to the skies, and you were skant resolued, whether you should graunt it to stretch any farder. But though you cauill with Hades, quarrell not with God. His perfection, presence and power are infinite aboue the highest heauen, and beneath the deepest Sheol; yea these comparisons do not match him, but leade vs to those places, where the most wonderfull workes of God are, to which no man liuing can ascend or descend; much lesse can we search or attaine to the heigth or depth of him or his perfection, presence, or power. And this is so plainely comprised in those places, that none but an

irreligious and impious conceiter will doubt thereof. Iob. 11.

If God be then in the highest, in the lowest, and in the midst; whither can we flee from him, who is euery where? all places being here contained, the highest heauens are not omitted. The Prophet Amos hath the like both purpose and partition, where God assureth Israel, they cannot decline his hand, whither soeuer they could or would goe; whether Amos 9. to heauen on high, to Sheol below, to the bredth of the mountaines, or to the depth of the Sea. If out of his diuision you exclude hell or heauen, as places whither Gods hand can not reach, doe you not with your impertinent Sophistrie broch vs a manifest heresie? wherefore Shammaijm here is any or euery part of heauen, euen as the earth is diuided by bredth and depth, into the hils, the Seas, and Sheol vnderneath, which is here conuinced to be in the earth, because God saith; though they digge into Sheol; teaching vs that the lowest Sheol is in the earth, which onely can be digged, and not either in water or aire, which can not be digged.
            As for the 14 of Esay, from which Christ deriued his threatning to Capernaum as resembling the pride and deseruing the punishment of the king of Babel; the words there are so direct for Shammaijm to be the highest heauen, euen the place of Gods throne, that you thought best to skippe it ouer with a false translation, and not to trouble your selfe any farder. The pride of the King of Babylon, is there thus expressed. Esa. 14. v. 13. 
               Thou saidst in thine heart, I will ascend to heauen, and will exalt my Throne aboue the starres of God. 
               14. 
               I will ascend aboue the higth of the clouds, and wilbe like the most highest.
               15.
            
            
               But thou shall be drawen downe to Sheol; euen to the sides (or lowest parts) of the pit. Shammaijm comprising three regions at least; the clouds, the starres, the place of Gods throne; the king of Babylon in his proud ambition said, he would ascend aboue the higth of the clouds, aboue the starres of God, and would exalt his throne like to the most highest. I hope Shammaijm here, to which the king of Babylon would ascend, was neither the clouds nor the starres (they both are by name excluded:) and consequently not the skies, as you fasly translate the Prophets words; but it was the resemblance of Gods throne, and the place of his glory, to which that proud tyrant aspired. Neither ment he there to be one of Gods Saints, as you would childishly chalenge your opponent, but what place of glory others get at Gods hands by obedience and humility he would in his arrogant heart assume vnto himselfe with rebellion and emulation of Gods greatnesse; euen as Adam and Eue neuer ment to be Saints, when they accepted the Diuels offer, Genes. 3. 
               ye shalbe as Gods, but desired no longer to be subiect to God, and sought to get a similitude, if not an equality with God. So did the King of Babel affect to be like the most highest; though he were fardest from it of all others. For the Prophet doth not in these words expresse, what the king of Babylon was indeed, but what his arrogant spirit conceaued in thinking there was no God greater then himselfe. This monstrous pride of his being the higth of all impiety and blasphemie, what reward in your conscience was it worthy to haue? a plaine no being any longer amongst the liuing? which you say Daniel affirmeth of Pag. 189. li. 22. 
               the Messias; or a iudgement proportionable to his wickednesse, that is to be cast downe to the bottom of hell, for exalting himselfe to the top of heauen?

sight and shame of his folly: and so if you ioine the vtter and eternall destruction of his person and his pride, you agnise Sheol to be hell, as I doe; and haue not the witte to see, that when a man is taken hence to that terrible and intolerable vengeance, all worldlie things first faile him, and the remembrance of his forme: plenty and glory augmenteth the griefe of his present penurie and misery. Els how auoide you contradiction as well to the trueth, as to your selfe in your two signification of Sheol? Sheol opposed to Shammaijm, you say Pag. 190. li. 4

The Scripture mentioneth the lower Sheol indeed, so called in respect of the higher, which is the graue, common to the bodies of good and bad. Other Sheols in the earth the Scripture knoweth none. Now for whom is this lower gulfe in the earth prouided? for men? or for oxen and sheepe? which you were placing there euen now by warrant pretended from Moses and the Psalmist, but that you fouly mistooke the words of both. When God openeth the earth to swallow vp men, and all that belongeth to them, as he did to the rebels in the wildernesse, he hath roome enough in the earth to couer and close that, which doth not descend to Sheol, without your vast and deepe gulfe. If you confesse this vast and deepe gulfe in the earth, to serue for wicked men after death, then come you neerer to the Scriptures, but as neere to hell. For Dauid saying vnto God;" Thou hast deliuered my soule from

               Her guests are in the depth of Sheól. Moses telleth you, Deut. 32. 
               The sire of Gods wrath burneth to the lower Sheól. In the lower Sheol then are the soules of the wicked, and fire there burning for them. If your vast and deepe gulfe in the earth be all one with this, we know the place to be hell and the vse thereof the punishment of the wicked. If it differ from this, you must tell vs by the word of God, wherefore it serueth. For that a vast and deepe gulfe in the earth should be nothing els, but an abolishing of Pag. 190. li. 9. 
               any visible creatures hence or that this should be the most proper sense of Sheol, and your vast and deepe gulfe a resemblance thereof, this hath neither top nor toe. If Sheol be properly nothing but a priuation, how can it be a vast and deepe gulfe in the earth, or what proportion or similitude hath the one with the other? These are therefore nothing but your fictions imagined of your owne braine to delude the Scriptures, and to auoide the lower Sheol indeed, which is the place of torment for the damned.
            How Capernaum was exalted to heauen, whether in her owne proud conceit after the example of the king of Babylon, of whom Esaie speaketh; or whether Christ ment, that by reason of his often preaching and working miracles amongst them, the kingdome of God was in the midst of them, but not receaued nor regarded by them, which some thinke to be the meaning of this place: I stand indifferent, so long as we keepe Sheol opposite to heauen, I meane not to the clouds, nor to the skies, as you would shift the matter, but to the place aboue, where the way of life is, and the brightnesse of Gods glorie, that thereby we may conceaue in the lower sheol darknesse and death for euer, euen as in the higher sheol, both are for the time. Prouerb 15. 
               The way of life, saith Salomon, is on high; (neither in the clouds nor starres, but in the seat of the blessed, euen in heauen) to him that declineth Sheol below. Where speaking of eternall life, (since bodily life is heere on earth) he warneth vs, that eternall death is in sheol below. The rest of your stuffe is not woorth the sticking at. For what if God by Ieremie threatned Babylon, that though Ier. 51. v. 58. 
               her walles were thicke, and her gates high, the one should be broken, and the other burned: and though she should mount vp to heauen by raising her walles neuer so high, yet her destroyers should come from God: Doth this being spoken of the walles and gates, which should be razed, prooue that her walles and gates should descend to Sheol? Where hath the prophet any such words of the walles, gates, or buildings of Babylon? And for you to expound Sheol by what you

list, is a larger commission, then I know any you haue. I haue no doubt, but walles and gates cannot reach vnto the clouds, much lesse to the starres, and therefore heauen applied to them standeth for that which riseth on high in the aire; but that the pride of the king of Babel, lifted it selfe aboue the clouds and starres; I haue prooued by the plaine report of the Prophet, against which no exception can be taken.

Heere it is referred to the destruction of the whole and intire persons of men taken away by death out of this world.] What is now become of your world of soules, which you so often vrged as properly signified by hades? What is become of your vast and deepe gulfe in the earth; which sheol and hades did import, as yon told vs but euen now? Nay, what is become of your destruction of stones, and their descending to Hades. which you said was threatned to Capernaum? Are all these out of date, and in euerie new place must you be forced to frame vs a new Hades? You will rest somewhere at last, if it be possible for your vnquiet head to haue or like any rest. Well now then hades is the

               destruction of the whole person of man taken out of this world by death. And why should not hades heere be taken for hell? [The whole scope and drift of the Apostle heere, is to speake of the resurrection of the bodie, and you graunt it.] What then? The Saints receauing their bodies endued with immortalitie, may they not reioice in their deliuerance from corruption, and insult, as hauing then the full victorie, ouer hell and death? li. 24. 
               Our full deliuerance from hell and from Satan is obtained in this life, as it is written, we being deliuered from our enemies, and from the handes of all that hate vs.] We are so deliuered from their hands or power, (which is all one) that we shall not need to feare them; but we are not yet actually freed from their snares, since we daily must pray, not to be ledde (or left) into temptation; neither are all our enemies yet fully destroied; since as the Apostle saith; 1. Cor. 15. vers. 26. 
               the last enemie, that shall be destroied, is death. If all Christes enemies were put vnder his and our feete, he should no longer raigne as Redeemer and Sauiour of his Church; vers. 25.

And yet were all things granted which you intend, it helpeth you not one whit: for may not the saints giue thankes for all euen then, when all is fully finished, though part be before perfourmed? And may they not iustly reioice against all the power of Satan, I meane sinne, hell, and death, when the last enemie is in sight conquered, though they be formerly freed from sinne, and fully deliuered from the danger and feare of hell?

               Your speech is very bad and scandalous, where you say the bodies of the Saints lying in their graues, are in the diuels walke. 
               Pag. 189. li. 31. 
               For then the graues, where bodies lie senselesse, are a part of hell properly taken.] You told vs euen now, that the aire on high was the place of diuels, & thinke you much that vpon occasion I should say the graues vnder the earth are within Satans walke? The booke of Iob saith, Iob. 1. 
               Satan compasseth the earth, and walketh in it. And Peter confirmeth the same, saying, He 
               1. Peter. 5. 
               walketh about, seeking whom he may deuoure. So that the diuels walke (for all your saying) is farre larger then hell. And if our Lord and master most truely said of the woman, which was crooked, and could not lift vp herselfe in any wise, that Luke 13. 
               Satan had bound that daughter of Abraham, lo, eighteene yeeres; may not the dead bodies of Abrahams children be in Satans walk, as well as their liuing bodies be in Satans bands?

               vnder the power of death, whereof the Diuell hath the rule by the Apostles doctrine? [Pa. 191. li. 28. 
               we being heere truely iustified by Gods grace are fully freed, and deliuered from all the power of our enemies.] Are we so fully freed, that we can neither sinne, nor die? or are sinne and death no parts of Satans power? When I speake of a full conquest ouer hell and death, in both parts of man, soule and bodie, which is not performed before the bodie rise to glorie; you turne it, as if I professed our redemption from hell to be imperfect till the last day. And when I mention with Saint Paul the redemption of our bodies from corruption, which shall not be

before the resurrection; you would inferre thereupon, if you could tell how, that the bodies of the Saints Pag 192. li. 1. 
               remaine subiect to the power of hell, to the curse of the law, and to the claime of Satan. Thus you runne on, like a riotous spaniel, chalenging vpon euery foote, but finding nothing. With like wit and trueth you inferre vpon my wordes, where I say the death of the body was inflicted on mankind as part of the wages of sinne, that therefore Pag. 192. li. 3. 
               the godly must pay a part of their owne redemption and satisfaction for sinne; and then Christ was not our onely and absolute redeemer. But which way doth this follow, can you tell? punishment for sinne is in our persons neither redemption, nor satisfaction for sinne; in Christs person it was both. Know you not the difference betwixt Christs person and ours?
            
               li. 9. 
               But I say pa. 216. that the bodies of the dead Saints are in the possession of hell, and in the handfact of hell.] In wresting and wrangling is all your grace. Where some auncient writers seeme to say, that Christ deliuered Serm. pag. 216. 
               some of the Saints out of the present possession of hell; all the defence (I said) that could any way be made out of the Scriptures to excuse this, was to take hell improperly for the sting and wound of bodily death, which Satan the ruler of hell procured to man by sinne. For sinne, death, and corruption are the workes of the Diuell, which Christ came to dissolue. Wisdom. 1. 2. 
               God made not death, as the wiseman obserueth, but created man without corruption; and through the enuie of the Diuell came death into the world. This then being one of the wounds, which Satan through sinne gaue vnto our first father and all his ofspring, this is not perfectly cured, but with the resurrection of our bodies to eternall life, though the poyson of this wound bee in the meane time allayed, and the danger secured. And thus, whiles I seeke to mitigate other mens wordes, and to extenuate the name and power of hell, vnderstanding thereby nothing but the dissolution of mans life, and corruption of mans bodie, which Satan occasioned by sinne; you make the Reader beleeue, I take the name of hell properly for the power and right, that hell hath ouer the bodies of the wicked, and teach, that the Saints are not deliuered from hell, till their bodies rise from death, which when you list you can find to bee refuted elswhere by me; and therefore to be no part of my meaning heere.
            How death is an enemie, which must be destroyed, aswell as sinne and hell, we neede not your commentarie; except it were stoared with better Diuinitie. It hindreth the Saints. you graunt, Pag. 192. li. 22. 
               from enioying their appointed felicitie, yet as a peaceable and quiet stop. Ascribe you this peace and quietnesse to their bodies voide of life and sense, or to their soules staied from the full fruition of eternall glorie by that meanes? And troeThe Saint in heauen most eanestly desire their bodies. you, the soules of the Saints be well and quietly content to lacke their appointed felicitie? not at all to desire it, or not earnestly to pray for it; were plainly to loath it, and not obediently to expect it. Wherefore they exceedingly affect, and instantly pray for the destruction of this enemie, that keepeth their bodies in dishonour and corruption, and hindereth their spirits from enioying that glorie, which shalbe reucaled in the last time; which appeareth by their vehement prayer in the Reuelation; Reuelat. 6. 
               how long, O Lord, holy and true, doest thou not iudge, and auenge our bloud on them, that dwell on the earth? Where they in heauen seeke not reuenge on them, for whom they prayed in earth, but they expresse their continuall and ardent desire for that day, when they shall be wholy conformed to Christ their head. And when they are willed to rest for a season, they gladly submit themselues to the will and wisedome of God; but meane while they hate death, as an hinderer of that blisse and ioy, which they so much loue and long for; and shall no doubt reioyce exceedingly, when this last enemie is swallowed vp in victorie, as the rest were before. But let death be an enemie which way you will, how doth this conclude, that Hades here (1. Corinth. 15.) in no sort signifieth hell?

               The very text seemeth thus to expound it selfe, saying, where is thy sting O Hades? the sting of death is sinne. Where the later seemeth a direct exposition of the former, noting these two wordes, (Hades and death) as Synonymas for one thing, being applied to men.] When you talke of the text of holy Scripture, you should not leaue the wordes, that are extant

And least you should thinke, as you doe, that the old translator, who very scrupulously keepeth the word Infernum for Hades through out the Bible, did heere translate it by death, you shall see that Eusebius lighted on a Greeke copie, where the word Thanatos, death, was twice repeated, and the parts changed as they stand in the Latine.

In this diuersitie of reading and relating the Apostles wordes, it is eche mans duetie not to runne which way he will, though perhaps he may bring some one president for his purpose, but to hold that for the true and Authenticke text, to which most copies and writers agree. And therefore since your exposition of hades & death to be Synonymas, dependeth vpon your priuate changing the order of the apostles words, I see no need to make any answere to it, specially when as the Latin translator might, and no doubt did light on such a copie, as Eusebius did, which had the word, Thanatos, death, twice in that place. Otherwise it could not be that he, who was ouer diligent in all other places, would be so negligent in this.

For sinne, which the Apostle heere calleth the sting of death, did not onely sting Adam and his ofspring with the death of the body, but also with the death of the soule: (the wages of sinne being death in all parts of man, and in all places of his abode); and therefore sinne of his owne nature and force, till it be pardoned by Christ, is the sting no lesse of hell, as in all the wicked; then of bodily death, as in all the Saints. And heere by the way the Reader may obserue, that for aduantage you are content to make bodily death in the Saints the sting of sinne, which I trust is as much, as the punishment of sinne, since it stingeth vnto death.

Looke on the Apostles reasons and comparisons in this whole chapter, and if any one of them naturall or theologicall, agree to the resurrection of the wicked, then let the Reader thinke you haue some vnderstanding of this place, which now is vtterly none. 1.

               Thanks be to God, which hath giuen vs victory through our Lord Iesus Christ. How farre are these things from all communion of the wicked? though hell at that day shalbe increased and aduanced, (as you call it) with the bodies of all the wicked, yet may the godly Saints (of whom the Apostle speaketh) most iustly reioice against hell and death, as being now swallowed vp in victory, that is, vtterly defeated of all force to kill the body any more, or to stay the soule any longer by meanes of death from her crowne of glory. For the victory which God will giue vs through Christ our Lord against hell and death, is not yet full, till our soules and bodies be brought to eternall blisse. And were it possible (which is not) that the soules of the Saints could for euer enioie the rest and blisse, which now they haue without their bodies; euen in this want of one halfe, Satan should still haue some victory ouer them, that is, ouer their bodies, though not ouer their soules. Wherefore the victory is then full, when both parts of man are freed from all things, that hinder their heauenly inheritance. And this the best interpreters confesse. Peter Martyr,Peter Martyr in 1.

               The Apostle declareth, that the victory ouer sinne death and hell is gotten by the might and merits, not of the saints, but of Christ, to whom the saints must yeeld all glory, praise, and thanks. And this explanation hath very excellent degrees. First

to the second death: the second is sinne, which is the force of death and hell. For by sinne came death. The third is the law, the strength of sinne. The law being then taken away, the force of sinne decaieth; sinne being abolished, the power of death ceaseth; death being disarmed hell is ouerthrowen. Hyperius,Hyperius in 1. Corinth. 15. 
               If death shall then haue no more rule, it followeth that neither hell shall preuaile against the godly. For this must be vnderstood of them, since the wicked shall not be deliuered from the power of hell. In these words, ô death where is thy sting? ô hell where is thy victory? either God, as conquerer; or the saints, as giuing the praise of the conquest to God, in a sort reproch death and hell, with the losse of their power and strength. And very aptly is death put first, and then hell. For men die before they be cast into hell, in which the wicked tast the second or eternall death. Moe might be brought; but with wise men there can be no question, that the Saints at the last day being then fully freed from all their enemies, may giue thanks to God for the victory purchased by Christ against them all, hell and Satan not excepted.

               Also we are to note that the Apostle heere plainely alludeth to that of Hoseah. O Sheol, o kingdome of death, I wilbe thy destruction, not ô hell. The Prophet speaketh this to comfort Israel in their captiuity against their continuall destruction, and raizings out of this world.] You will soone brest other men, that will beard the Apostle in this matter so boldly as you doe. Indeed you and some others thinke it a glory to take part with the Iewes contradicting all that the Euangelists & Apostles alleage out of the law and the Prophets touching Christ and his kingdome; and you vouchsafe to yeeld to the holy Ghost speaking in them, no more skill or vnderstanding of the old Testament, but to allude to it, and as it were to play with it, when the true literall sense of most places, as you thinke, is farre from that, which they intend. But this Iudaizing, whiles you would seeme, more then others, to smatch of a little Hebrew, I for my part detest; and professe to the world, I take that euery where to be the true and direct meaning of Moses and the Prophets, which Christ and his Apostles collect from their words.

Wherefore except you will haue the holy Ghost to speake contradictions, as your manner is, you must acknowledge, that amidst the fearefull troubles, destructions, and desolations then and afore denounced by the Prophet against the whole kingdome of Israel, God doth comfort his elect amongst them, that whatsoeuer became of their bodies in this affliction approching, he had his time, when he would vtterly destroy the power of all their enemies, not onely freeing them by death from tyrants and persecutors, but sauing them from death and hell by his annointed Messias, who should be a death to death, and a destruction to hell. And as this was the greatest comfort and onely hope, that Gods children in their miseries could expect or desire; so the Apostle keepeth right the Prophets meaning, and sheweth the time, when all this shalbe performed; that is, when all teares shalbe wiped from the eies of Gods elect; and all their enemies sinne, death, and hell troden vnder their feete. In this comfort and promise, as hell was the chiefest enemy, so, of all others, that must be conteined within the limits of Gods assurance, and their deliuerance. In vaine are all other promises of grace, whiles that enemy standeth vnuanquished. And therefore as we most needed, so God most promised, and Christ most performed the destruction of hell aboue and afore the death of the body, which you so much talke of, and

from which you giue to the reprobate a resurrection, as well as to the godly, which is but a cold comfort to him, that duely considereth it.

               Next we come to the Reuelation. First I haue the keyes of Hades (that is of destruction or of the kingdome of death) and of death. Or we may take them as two words for o

                   and the same thing. That is both of them for death. What shew of reason haue you to bring in here Christs power ouer the damned soules in hell? because there is mention else where of the key of hell; therefore the key of Hades here is the same. What colour of reason is there in this? Euen so much as you can not resist. For if it be certaine, which the Scripture confirmeth, that Christ hath the keyes of both, that is as well of hell as of death; and gate them both by submitting himselfe to death; And Hades in the new TestamentHow Hades is vsed in the Reuelation. is taken for hell, as hitherto we haue seene; and euen with Saint Iohn the writer of this Reuelation it is a different thing from death; what can Hades be here but hell? That Christ by his obedience vnto death had all power in heauen, and earth, and hell giuen him, the Apostle is very plaine.Philip. 2. 
               Christ became obedient to the death, euen the death of the Crosse. Wherefore (or for which cause) God highly exalted him, and gaue him a Name aboue euery name, that at the name of Iesus euery knee of those in heauen, on earth, and vnder the earth should bow, and euery tongue confesse, that Iesus is the Lord. As he himselfe also witnessed, when he said, after his resurrection,Matth. 28. 
               all power in heauen and earth (that is, in all places and ouer all things created) is giuen vnto me. Since then without question Christ had the keyes as well of death and hell, as of heauen; and so that sense of his words is most true; let vs see which of our expositions hath best reason. When Iohn for feare fell as dead at Christs feete, would Christ to comfort Iohn in that plight, say no more but that he
               Pag. 193. li. 36. 
               himselfe was once dead, and now aliue, and had power to die no more, as you expound Christs words? how could this strengthen or restore Iohn, that was euen dead for feare? or did Christ rather encourage Iohn not to feare without cause, seeing he himselfe not onely was risen from the dead, but had all power ouer death and hell, that is the keyes of both to dispose of ech mans life and Soule at his pleasure? when therefore Christ, that had all power of life and death, Saluation and damnation laid his right hand on Iohn to protect him, and bad him not feare, but write the things, which he saw; had not Iohn iust cause to cast away all feare, and cheerefully to obey the voice of him, that was so able and ready to rescue him from all feare and danger whatsoeuer?
            Christs power ouer death, you will say, was enough to preserue Iohns life, and therefore mention of the key of hell was superfluous. Iohn was to see, and write the things, that were, and after should be in heauen, earth and hell, as is euident in his Reuelations: yea the opening and shutting of the bottomelesse pit, the chaining of Satan there, the comming of the Locusts and the beast from thence, and the lake of fire and brimstone euerlastingly burning there, and who should be throwen into it, were to be reuealed vnto him. Lest therefore the sight of these things should amaze Iohn, or the reporting of them should want credit with vs, Christ did professe, which is most true, that he had the keyes, that is all power euen ouer these secret and fearefull places; so that Iohn should neither shrinke at the vision, nor we distrust the Relation of them. And though my reason of mentioning here the keyes of hell be such, as you shall neuer counteruaile; yet doe I not runne proudly and peremptorily, as you doe, in mine owne conceits; I haue the iudgement of the best Interpreters, old and new, that haue intermedled with the opening of these reuelations. Andreas Arch Bishop of the same Caesaria, that Saint Basil was, and within 600. yeeres after Christ, though you skornfully reiect him, as you doe that venerable writer Bede; expounding these words of Christ,

Christ hath the supreme gouernment of the house or kingdome of God; to quicken whom he will, and to draw them from hell and damnation; and whom he will damne, with his iust iudgement to destroy.

But though you play with Saint Iohns visions, you haue no warrant to mistake Saint Iohns words, and to muster your owne errors vnder his colours. Saint Iohn doth not say, that power was giuen to death and Hades to kill with the sword, with famine, and with death, as you dreame; but Saint Iohn hauing represented the sword, or warre by the red horse verse 4. and famine by the blacke horse, verse 5. and all sorts of diseases and pestilences by the pale horse, verse 8. he saith, power was giuen to them, that is, to the riders on these three horses to kill the fourth of the earth with warre, hunger, and sicknesse. And because these three come not one after another, but when God is greatly prouoked with the haynous sinnes, and impenitent harts of men; therefore Hades, hell, is said to come after the third, in respect that the rebellions of men against God are ripe for hell, when no plagues can conuert them from their wicked waies. This the auncient Expositor in Austens works obserueth. Hell followeth after.

You tosse these termes, as Souldiers do pikes, and then you say, there is no absurditie in them. You haue beene squaring & rounding of Hades, sometimes for the vnseene place of soules, sometimes for the meere priuation of this life, sometimes for the world of the dead in generall, which compriseth the soules & bodies of all that be dead, be they good or bad; somtimes also for the power, dominion, and kingdome of death, which you enlarge aswel to heauen, where the Saints are; as to hell, where the damned are; Now which of all these shall be cast into hell? not the place: for then not onely hell shall be cast into hell, which you say soundeth senselesle in your eares, but heauen also, which is most senselesse in mine: not the world of the dead; for so should the bodies and soules of all the Saints be throwen into hell fire, which I trust you dare not endure. Perhaps your meere priuations shall be euerlastingly punished in hell, the danger is not great for them, since nothing can be no where, nor feele no paine, and so not in hell. But after many deuices and aduices, you say, the power and dominion of death shall be cast into hell. That shall vtterly cease at the resurrection, when all soules are ioyned to their bodies againe. How then shall that, which wholy and finally ceaseth, be cast into hell? You meane it shall beePag. 195. li. 1.

Happy were the damned, both men and spirits, if they might be cast into this new hell of yours, that is vtterly and eternally be abolished. But these be mockeries in themselues, and falsities against the Christian faith. That which is cast into the lake of fire, shall there euerlastingly burne, and not consume, but dure in perpetuall torment. Shall your dominion of bodily death euerlastingly burne in hell? And shall it also feele the force of that fire? You must then make Hades a person; for besides persons nothing shalbe cast into hell fire. And if it be a person, it must be a diuell, or a man; except you will find out a place for it amongst your sheepe and cattell, that you sent aliue to Hell. But such childish and peeuish deuices are not worth the refuting. The Reader may see, what it is for men to forsake the learned and sound expositions and assertions of auncient Fathers, and betake themselues to their fresh and new fansies, of which thy cannot tell what to make, nor how to speake.

is affixed to the place and torments there, from which they shall not stirre, as now they doe, whiles the iustice of God doth suffer them to vphold and encrease their kingdome here on earth. And where you vouch of your hades, that it shall at the last day of iudgement be throwen into hell, that is eternally be abolished; as you conceaue and deriue your Hades, that day shall enlarge it more then euer before, and so continue it so reuer. For all visible creatures in heauen and earth (saue men) shall after that day haue no more any being at all; yea the first heauen, and the first earth (shall) passe away, and there (shall be) no more any sea; which will greatly enrich your generall Hades, that containeth thePag. 183. li. 25. 29. 
               destruction of vnreasonable things; and the perishing of visible creatures from hence, as the proper Etymologie thereof admitteth. Nay if thePag 178. li 28. 
               very naturall Etymologie of the word according to Grammar doe properly signifie, NOT SEENE ANY MORE IN THIS WORLD, as you affirme it doth; then all, both good and bad, be they in heauen or hell, shall after the day of iudgement be properly and euerlastingly in Hades. For they shall neuer be seene any more in this world, whose1. Cor. 7. 
               figure passeth away without returning, and giueth place for euer to the world to come. And this your Hades, which you would cast into hell there to bee for euer abolished, shall by the naturall Etymologie, and proper signification thereof, confessed and vrged by your selfe, not only continue in hell and in heauen, but comprise them both, seeing the Citizens of either shall not be seene any more in this world.

               Lastly heere is shewed the most generall and vniuersall rendring vp of all the dead whatsoeuer to iudgement. But hell plainly hath not all the dead. Therefore death and Hades doe not heere properly signifie the diuell and Hell.] When you say, heere is shewed the vniuersall rendring vp of all the dead whatsoeuer to iudgement, If you meane this of death & hades, that they rendred vp all the dead, that came to iudgement; you vouch a manifest vntrueth repugnant to the very wordes of Saint Iohn going next before, for thus his wordes stand.Reuel. 20. v. 13. 
               And the sea gaue vp her dead, which were in her, and death and Hades deliuered vp the dead, which were in them. So that all the dead were not rendred to iudgement by death and Hades, the Sea had part by Saint Iohns owne speech; and therefore death and Hades heere doe not signifie the Dominion of death, which reacheth to the sea, aswell as to the earth. Againe Saint Iohn in the twelfth verse,Reuel. 20. v. 12. 
               saw the dead both great and small stand before God. And in the thirteenth he addeth, the 13. 
               Sea also gaue vp her dead, and death and hell deliuered vp the dead which were in them. Hee saw then some dead stand before God, which neither the Sea, nor hades deliuered. And since Paul telleth vs, that the1 Thess. 4. v. 16. 
               dead in Christ shall rise first; and God will bring them, which sleepe in Iesus, with him (to iudgement); what hindreth, but the dead in the twelfth of Saint Iohn may be the elect, and the rest be deliuered vp from the deepe of the Sea, and of Hades, as is mentioned in the thirteenth verse? If you like not this, shew vs a reason, why the earth is here ouerskipt, in which are the most of the dead bodies both of good & bad, (vnlesse it were because no doubt was of the earth in refunding her dead) and we will make you a playner explication of these parts, which now seeme somewhat doubtfull. Howbeit death and Hades cannot stand for one and the selfe same thing, as you would haue them, since the holy Ghost applieth the plurall number to them, and maketh them places (not phrases) to containe the dead in them; by saying, death and Hades gaue vp the dead, which were in them. Words haue no dead in them, but places haue; which because S. Iohn maketh to bee plurall, death and Hades cannot here be taken for one thing.
            Neither were those writers, whom you reiect, so inconsiderate as not easily to wipe away the force of your faint reasons. Bede vpon these words, the Sea, death, and hell, gaue vp their dead, saith,Beda in cap. 20. Apocalyp. 
               Iohn signifieth the bodies shalbe gathered from the earth, and their soules from their (seuerall) places. The good vnder the name of death, which suffered onelie the dissolution of their bodies, and no (farder) punishment: the euill he designeth by the name of hell. Andreas Caesariensis taketh the Sea for the earth, as Bede doth; either because they thought the earth should then be plaine like the sea, as Sibylla prophesied,August. de Ciuitate Dei. lib. 18. cap.

The Latines call it infernus, because the place of the damned is thought to be somewhere in the earth beneath vs, as it is said in the 16 of Numbers, they descended aliue to hell, and the earth couered them.
            
            Thus haue we for your pleasure runne ouer all the places of the new Testament,Why hades doth signifie hell in the new Testament. where hades is vsed; and for ought we see, or you say, find the plaine and perpetuall vse of hades to signifie hell; and not any such priuations, destructions, conditions, and dominions of bodily death, as you dreame of. And as for the circumstances of the places, they all concurre exactly and directly with this signification of hades, which I obserue; notwithstanding your Cabbinet of conceits, that hades shall designe you know not what, where, nor when. The reasons of my obseruations are manifest. For where throughout the old Testament with the Septuagint hades doth alwaies import the pit for dead bodies or soules: that is, the graue common to good and bad, or hell peculiar to the soules of the reprobate, with the consequents of either; and the writers

of the new purposely distinguish 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                
               death from hades, and mention death expressely, that is, by name or by description, in euery of those places, where hades is found in the new Testament, saue in Christs threatning of Capernaum, in which it is opposed to heauen, as fardest distant from it, and most repugnant to it: It is a plaine & true rule in mine opinion, that the Euangelists and Apostles euery where by Hades intended hell, and none of your wandring, or stragling fansies. Besides the Greeke Fathers with one consent vse Hades after the direction of the Canonicall writers, for a place of darknesse vnder the earth, prouided to receaue and detaine the Soules of men. And in this sense neither the Scriptures nor the Fathers departed much from the auncient and true vse of the word amongst heathen and prophane Authors; sauing that the Pagans made it common to the Soules of iust and vniust, which the Scriptures neuer doe, and the Fathers vtterly refuse after Christs Resurrection, whatsoeuer they doe before. Since then Hades by the manifest exposition of Saint Luke in his Gospell, is the place of torment, where the wicked after death are punished; and the same Euangelist expresseth Dauids meaning to be this, that Christs Soule after death was not left or forsaken in Hades; what cause or reason hath any man to denie that Christ dying descended to hell; there to spoyle powers and principalities, and thence to leade Captiuitie Captiue, that as he ascended to the highest heauens, there to sit superiour to all the Elect Angels, so he first descended to the bottomlesse deepe, there to subiect the Reprobate Angels vnto his humane nature, and to dissolue the power and sorrowes of hell, of which it was impossible he should be held.

               Here we must consider a maine obiection of yours, euen those words of our common Creed, he descended into hell; originally it is he descended into Hades, and in truth this is all you haue to alleadge for your opinion: but I answere two waies: first admitting, then denying the Authoritie of these words in our common Creede.] You haue seene by this time what I haue to alleadge; for that which I defend may besafely conceiued of the Creed. The words themselues, he descended to Hades, haue euident warrant in the holy Scriptures, and Peter exactly concludeth out of Dauids words, that Christs 
               Acts. 2. v 31. 
               Soule was not left in Hades. What Hades is with S. Luke the writer of the Acts, we likewise haue seene. It is euen the place, where the wicked are tormented after death. Put these together, and tell me what they want of Christes descending into hell before he rose from the dead. The words in English, he descended into hell; are confirmed by the publike authoritie of this Realme, as well in the Booke of common praier, as in the Articles of Religion agreed on by the Conuocation, and ratified by Act of Parliament. So that all your euasions & elusions of the priuation, condition, and dominion of death to be ment thereby are vtterly reiected and condemned by generall and full consent of Prince, Pastours & people within this Realme; and Christs descent to hell after death hath beene constantly and continually professed and beleeued in the Church of England euer since the Gospell was here established. What you haue said against it, I leaue to the Readers wise and indifferent iudgement, who wil easily tell you, you must bring better sluffe then either phrases or fansies before the common Creede may be thus reiected and despised.

               You enioyne vs three Rules to be exactly and precisely kept in the expounding of these words; Namely, 1. distinction of Matter. 2. consequence of order. 3. proprietie of words. Might not those godly men (thinke you) misse in some such circumstances, although the Scripture cannot?] The first compilers of the Creede meaning shortly, orderly, and plainly to deliuer the summe of the Christian faith, as touching the three persons in Trinitie, and the chiefest blessings which God bestoweth on his Church in this life and the next by Iesus Christ our Lord, might not with any discretion in so briefe and compendious assume of Christian Religon proposed to the simple and vulgar sort of all ages and sexes, vse either any needlesse repetition, disordered confusion, or obscure inuolution of things requisite to our Saluation. To these Rules agree all that haue expounded the Creede in the Church of Christ to this very day, saue your selfe, and such as haue opened you the gap to these innouations. And these Rules allowed do cleane cast your exposition out of doores. For where it is most plainly said that Christ died,
               
and was buried; which words no plow-man, woman, nor child of reasonable yeeres can mistake; you after Christs buriall come in with a darke and figuratiue phrase of descending to Hades, which in effect you confesse is no more but what was said before in knowen and open speech, that Christ died. And this obscure and strange circumlocution of death you will haue to be an Article of your faith, as if euery Christian creature were bound vpon danger of his saluation to vnderstand what Sheol or Hades doth signifie in the Greeke and Hebrew Tongues; which is a position meete for such a Diuine as you are. Your exposition therefore is repugnant to all three Rules. For it is a superfluous, vnorderly, & enigmaticall iteration of that which was before expressed in due place with as plaine and easie wordes, as any might be spoken by the tongue of man. Now with what Arguments you or any man liuing (Hu. Bro. not excepted,) can prooue that Hebrew or Greeke phrases are Articles of Religion, and must be conceaued and beleeued of all men before they can be saued, as yet I doe not vnderstand. And this is the miserie of your cause, that not onely you haue no word in Latine, English, nor in any tongue else answerable to your Sheol or Hades, but when you come to lay open your owne phrases, the exposition is more ridiculous then the Translation. For by Christs descending to Hades, which you call the power, dominion and kingdome of death, you meane no more, but that Christs Soule seuered from his Body went to heauen to the rest of the blessed Soules there. And here I report me to him that will vouchsafe to read your 196. & 197. pages, whether you haue any thing there but store of phrases, extending, intending, enlarging, amplifying the name, power, and dominion of death; which when all is done and said, amounteth to this much, that Christes soule seuered by death from his body submitted it selfe to the base and low condition of the dead, by taking the paines to goe to heauen to the rest of the Saints there. This is all in effect that your Periphrasis and Emphasis moriendi doe containe; and the great fall or whole casting downe of Christes person, which you so Rhetorically set out with termes of the broadest and longest size, hath nothing in it, but only this, that his soule after death which dissolued his person, ascended to the societie of the blessed soules in heauen. The rest is your emphaticall and paraphrasticall vanitie swelling with wordes, and shrinking in sense; which needeth none other refutation but sober obseruation, that when two sides are spent, nothing is said; but you are where you began. For would you not varie so many phrases as you doe, tending all to expresse one thing; but seeke a little to shew vs what matter is contained in them, you should soone see what labour you haue lost in this Carrecke of words, which you haue newly brought vs home.

               Your meere and simple death, which you say is nothing els but the going asunder of the soule from the body, hath of necessitie thus much in it. It is the separation of the soule from the body, which is the cause of life in the body, It is the dissolution of the person, which consisteth of body and soule: It is the priuation of life which endeth with the departingWhat things the death of the bodie doth import. of the soule: It is the continuing of death, since possibly there is no regresse from the priuation to the habite without the mightie hand of God working aboue nature. For the soule departing neuer returneth, till God commaund, by whose word heauen and earth were made. What now after death becommeth of both parts of man, is no hard matter to conceaue. Salomon saith, Ecclesiast. 1
                     •…
                  
                
               Dust (meaning flesh, first made of dust) returneth to earth as it was, and the spirit, to God that gaue it; by him to be disposed and adiudged to ioy or paine, as pleaseth him. The body then goeth to corruption, the soule receaueth iudgement, where it shall remaine in hell or heauen, till the bodie be restored againe, which shall be at the last day. Descending to hades after death cannot be verified of the whole person of man, but in respect of the parts. Referred to the body, it is as much as buried and laide in the place, where it shall putrifie and returne to dust. Applied to the soule, it must signifie the place to which the soule is caried, which I say must be vnder earth, since heauen is neuer called by that name, nor expressed by that word, either in the Scriptures, or in any other sacred or prophane writers. The power and dominion of death, which you so much speake of, is

nothing else but Gods ordinance, that from death there is no returne to life till hee appoint. If then there be no dominion nor kingdome of death preuailing or ruling in heauen, where the soules of the Saints are without their bodies, then Christ in ascending to heauen descended not to Hades. Againe with what trueth can you auouch Christes soule came vnder the full Pag. 196. li. 33. 
               power and dominion of death, since death had no power ouer the bodie or soule of Christ longer or farder then he himselfe would permit; and his soule free from all bands and paines of death, destroied the dominion and kingdome of death, to which it was alwaies superiour and neuer subiect, but onely that he might shew himselfe with greater power to be conquerer of death rather in rising from the dead, then in declining the force of death, as if he were not able after death and in death, to dissolue the dominion and power of death? Wherefore your exaggerating the power and dominion of death OVER THE SOVLE of Christ, and that IN HEAVEN; whither you graunt Christes soule went after death, is not onely a vaine and idle flourish, but a poisoned and pestilent doctrine, if you take not heed to it; since no power of death, but Christes will to shew himselfe Lord of life and death, either seuered his soule from his bodie, or bestowed his soule in any place after death, or detained him in the condition of death; but he was free to die when he would, and rise from death when he would, which euerteth all power and dominion of death ouer him, how much soeuer in wastefull wordes you auouch the contrarie.
            Touching the proprietie of wordes, that you say is as true as the rest. For Hades hath no such Defenc. pag. 197. li. 28. 
               natiue and proper sense, as you talke of, but exactly and directly (when it is referred to a place and not to a person) signifieth a place of darknesse where nothing can be seene, as with one consent Heathen and Christian writers acknowledge. And the word descending after death, which you must applie to the soule ascending to heauen, you childishly change into the li. 35.

Where againe you incurre the same sands, that you did before in affirming Christ was held and subdued of death for the time, which is plainly false doctrine, since he would abide that time in death, least any should thinke him not truely dead, but was neuer vnder the power and dominion of death. And as for Ibid. li. 4. 
               lying held in death, that phrase is strangely referred to the soule of Christ, which ascended to the third heauen with more honour and ioy, then it receaued in this life heere on earth. What Ruffine saith, is not much to be regarded; if we beleeue S. In Apologia aduersus Ruffin

Where he saith, the diuine nature descended to death, he speaketh not of the soule, but of the godhead of Christ: which words by your leaue require a sober interpretation; and yet in respect of the diuine glory, the phrase of descending vnto death signifieth Christes submission to die, not his descent after death.

               If any thinke this to be somewhat figuratiue, yet is it verely so familiar and easie to all

people, as that other word in the Creede is, he sitteth at the right hand of God, yea it is farre easier.] When you can diue deepe into your owne fansies, you thinke them as familiar to all others, as to your selfe. If this were so easie and readie with the simpler sort, as you make it, me thinkes it should not so much trouble you to expresse it rightly. But you varie so often, and say nothing in the end, that your hearers can hardly sound the bottome of your Hades. That God hath no handes as we haue, this eueryWhat is meant by sitting at Gods right hand. meane Christian doth or should know. Since then this similitude is taken from men, and with them it is not strange to put those on their right hand, whom they will honour and aduance, it is easie for the simple to learne that Christes sitting at the right hand of God is as much as his sitting in glorie and Maiesty with God; which though they cannot presently perceiue how great it is, yet may they readily cōceaue what the meaning thereof is. In your descending to Hades it is nothing so. Your inconstancy and varietie in expounding that phrase is a proofe what difficultie there is in it; and your predicament of twelue parts at the end of your booke is a laborinth long enough for simple Christians to loose themselues therein. Though therefore your deuices be familiar to your selfe, who night and day dreame thereof, yet that maketh them no whit the easier to the simple; who can quickely apprehend that Christ was content to die for their sinnes, and to be buried for the more certaine triall of death, and to haue his soule bestowed where pleased himselfe, till his resurrection, when he raised himselfe from death as the vanquisher and commaunder of death, and of the whole power and Dominion of Satan, death and hell: but that Christe soule after death descended to Hades, that is to the generall indefinite condition and Dominion of death without any mention of the place, where it abode; this is more like one of Aristotles Metaphysicall abstracts, then any part of the Christian faith.

               Heerein all the later, famous and godly restoarers of religion in a manner doe ioyne with vs; as Master Bucer, P. Martyr, Bullingere, Oleuian. &c. yea master Caluine liked this also well enough, though yet he seemeth to leane more to another sense.] If you meane, those learned men were of opiniō, that descending to Sheol (which the Septuagint cal hades) referred to the bodies or liues of good or bad, did in the old Testament signifie their going to the graue, I am of the same opinion with them, I haue not once nor twice professed as much: but if any of them did thinke, as none of them doe, that Sheol in the Hebrew tongue, or in the Scriptures importeth not hell, but onely the graue, I must haue leaue to dissent from such as be of that mind. Howbeit neither Peter Martyr, nor Bullingere, nor Bucer, nor Oleuian, nor Caluine are of that mind, notwithstanding they diuersely expound this Article. What Caluine thinketh of Christes suffering hell paines, is not to this purpose; but most certainely hee taketh Hades in the Creede for hell, and for the paines thereof. Of the rest, excepting Oleuian, I haue spoken before: and Oleuians reasons to prefer his sense before all other senses of this Article are very weake; and not worthy a man of his learning. He layeth this for theOleuians conectures are but weake. maine ground thereof (which is not graunted, and cannot be prooued) That this Article, of Christes descending to Hades was Christs extreamest and lowest humiliation, and no part of his exaltation. Which way will you, or Oleuian prooue that? and yet this is the onely cause, why he would haue Hades signifie the ignominious state of Christes bodie in the graue, where he lay oppressed, and as it were swallowed vp of death. But Oleuians suppositiō, that certainly Peter in the second of the Acts spake of Christs extreamest humiliation, and deriued it from Dauids wordes, is vtterly void of all iust proofe. For Peter proposeth the manner and power of Christes resurrection. Now that was no part of Christes humiliation. Againe the words, which Peter citeth out of Dauid, argue rather the singular prerogatiue, which Christ had ouer death aboue Dauid and others, that his flesh saw no corruption, nor his soule was for saken in hell; which things whatsoeuer their meaning be, sound rather to Christs honor and Soueraignitie, then to his abasement and humilitie. Thirdly Oleuian referreth this to the basenesse of the graue; where I hope Christes soule was not. And if you make heauen or Paradise, where Christes soule was, the lowest abasement that Christ could suffer, you will

proue a mad merrie diuine. Lastly where Oleuian would haue the shame of the graue to be the victorie of those hellish paines, which he supposeth Christ suffered on the crosse, call you that the victory of hell ouer Christs soule, when it ascendeth with honour and blisse to heauen and the society of all the Saints? These things must hang better together before I can be induced to admit them, whosoeuer offereth them: though I make it as lawfull for me to refuse Oleuians coniectures, as he maketh it for himselfe to leaue all the Fathers, and the reformed churches of the Augustane confession expounding that article of the Creed, as I doe.

Your weake and seely proofes taking hold of the Pagans error, that thought good and bad after death were vnder the earth in Plutoes kingdome, whom they called hades, will neuer conuince our English translation to be partiall or false.

               This clause of Christs descending to hades or to infernum is new or lately put into our vulgar Creed called the Apostles Creed. Ruffinus witnesseth (who liued about fiue hundred yeeres after Christ) that it was not at all in the Creed in his time.] You mistake euery thing that you meddle with. Ruffine liued in Ieroms time, and wrote against him, which was within 400 yeeres after Christ; and saith the Church of Rome, and (some) Churches of the East had not those words (he descended to hell) in their Creeds. Whence you most vntruely conclude, li. 13. 
               There was no such article as this, nor any such words any where in the Creed for the space of 500 yeeres after Christ. To clap in fiue hundred for fower, and the whole world for some Churches of the East, are small matters with you, respecting how els where you intrude vpon others; but this is more hast then good speed, what your Author doth not say, to supplie of your owne. [Will you say Ruffine lieth? or can you bring to the contrary any proofe? I thinke not, yea I am sure, you cannot.] Whatsoeuer I say, Ruffine saith; you doe little better then lie. For in that exposition of the Creed, which you cite, he setteth downe this for a part of the Creed, Ruffimus in Symbolum Apostolorum. 
               Crucisixus sub Pontio Pilato, descendit ad inferna. Crucified vnder Pontius Pilate, he descended to hell. And therefore out of his report to inferre, there were not any such words any where in the Creed, for the space of 500 yeeres after Christ, is to bring your owne witnesse to

That this clause was not conteined in the Creed of some Churches, may well be confessed; that it was no where receaued and professed as a part of the Creed for 500 yeeres after Christ, is a manifest vntrueth, though Ruffine had said it, which yet he doth not. Cyrill Bishop of Ierusalem 360. yeeres after Christ repeating and expounding ten points of the Creed for the better remembance of those, that were baptised, after the crucifying, and burying of Christ, and before his resurrection rehearseth this as one of the ten, Cyrill.

               This Erasmus may seeme to haue some colour for his coniecture, that about Thomas Aquinas his time they might (peraduenture) be put into the Creede.] You can haue no colour for your error in mistaking Erasmus words. Could not Erasmus, being a man of that learning and reading which he was, tell whether this Article were in the Creed before Aquinas time or no? and could Aquinas so easily put this clause into all the Creedes that were vsed amongst Christians throughout the world? Innocentius the third, aboue 60. yeeres before Aquinas, expressing the mysteries of their masse, setteth downe the twelue parts of the Apostles Creede, and this for the fift Article, Innocent 3. de mysterijs Missae. li 2. cap. 15. 
               Descendit ad Inferna, tertia die resurrexit a mortuis. He descended to Hell, and rose the third day from the dead. The same Innocentius in his great Laterane Councell proposing the Catholike faith, as he calleth it, putteth downe this for a part thereof. Concil. lateranens. sub Innocent. 3. cap. 1. de fide Catholica. 
               Descendit ad Inferos, resurrexit a mortuis. Sed descendit in anima, resurrexit in carne. Christ descended to hell, and rose from the dead: but he descended in Soule, and rose with his flesh. Of this could not Erasmus be ignorant, since it was openly published to all mens eyes in the Decretals of Gregorie: li. 1. Tit. 1. de summa Trinitate & fide Catholica cap. 1. Erasmus therefore had no such meaning, that Thomas Aquinas was the first, that added this clause to the Creede, as you and others much mistake his words; but doubteth whether Aquinas in commenting on the Creede expounded that Article, or no. And that appeareth by his next words cleane contrarie to your conceite, which you neuer tooke the paines to view. Eras. in Symbolum Catechesi. 4. 
               Nonnulla suspitio est, hanc particulam ab alio adiectam, velhoc argumento, quod non est suo loco. There is some suspition, that this part (he descended to hell) was added (to Thomas exposition of the Creede) by some other, euen for this reason, because it is not put in his due place. For where he maketh the Resurrection to be the third article, the descent to hel he maketh the fourth: vnles happely he thought, that Christ returning from death to life descended to hell both in Body and Soule. Erasmus

saith no such thing, that Aquinas was the first, who added this Article to the Creede; but he would seeme to suspect, that Thomas did not accept this as a part of the Creede in his time, for that he doth not set it in the right place, where it should be, but putteth it after the Resurrection. Howbeit Erasmus might haue suspected, that some other had changed Aquinas order, as well as augmented Aquinas worke. For it is euident, that Aquinas in his summe of Diuinitie acknowledgeth that Article (of Christs descent to hell) 9 & 28. to come from the Apostles, and numbereth it in theAquinas 2. 2. quest. 1. Articulo. 4. place before the Resurrection of Christ from the dead. And this reason he giueth, why it was not mentioned in the Creedes of the Fathers, because no heresie was then risen about that point, and therefore they still presupposed it as foredetermined in the Apostles Creede. And yet there want not Councels and Fathers declaring and confirming this to be a part of the Catholike and Christian faith. The Councell of Orleance kept in the 46. yeere of Charles the great, in the profession of their faith, say thus. Synod. Arelaten sub Carolo. ca. 1. 
               Descendit ad Inferos, he descended to hell to deliuer the Saints, which there were held, deuictóque mortis Imperio, and subduing the kingdome of death, rose againe: concluding also thus: this is the faith of the Catholike Church, this confession we keepe and hold. The Councell of Foroiulij otherwise called Aquileia, (in which Citie Ruffinus, that expoundeth the Creede, was a Presbyter) made this exposition of the Creede in the time of Carolus Martellus, and Pipine his Sonne, Father to Charles the great.

               This most sincere puritie of the Catholike faith we will all degrees of the Church distinctly to learne and commit to memorie, it a vt ne vnus quidem apex intermittatur vel augeatur, so that not one the least point of it be omitted or encreased. The 4. Councell of Toledo in the time of Sisenandus King of Spaine, about 630. yeeres after Christ, made the same profession word for word, which the Councell of Orleance did after imitate. Concilium Toleta. 4 cap. 10. 
               Christ descended to hell to deliuer the Saints, which there were held, and subduing the kingdome of death rose againe. Venantius Bishop of Poictiers in France, that dedicated some of his poems to Gregorie the first, commenting on the Apostles Creede distinctly rehearsed the Article, Venantius in Symbolum Aposto. 
               descendit ad Infernum, he descended to hell, among the rest; and saith farder of it; but descending to hell Christ suffered no iniurie, for that he did it in respect of (his) mercie. As if a King should enter a prison, not to be there held himselfe, but to loose such as were guiltie.

               We can not see but that whensoeuer, whosoeuer put it first into this place, they signified thereby, it seemeth, that Christ went to Limbus a place vnder the earth, where they imagined the blessed Patriarkes rested.] When this clause was first inserted into the Creede, no man can directly pronounce. Some places had it not for a time, and some had it aunciently transmitted from the first founders of their Churches; which being duely considered by the rest, that wanted it, and the Article on euery side confessed to be true, it was at length generally receaued throughout the Church, not as a thing newly deuised by themselues, but formerly commended to many Churches euen from their first erection [Pag. 199. li. 32. 
               Thaddeus, Ignatius, and Athanasius haue these very words: yet say they not any where that they were in that set forme of the Apostles Creede, which we now haue.] If Thaddeus deliuered it to the Church of Edessa at the first preaching of the faith vnto them, and they kept a record thereof in the publike monuments of their Citie to the time of Eusebius; why should it not be counted and calle a part of the Apostles Creede, that is, of the short and plaine forme of the faith deliuered to the people, when they first receaued the Gospell of Christ? And how should Ignatius, Athanasius, and all the auncient Fathers both Greeke and Latine throughout the world light on the same words in effect, & agnise them for a point of Christian faith, if sundry Churches had not retained that Article in the Summarie confession of their faith euen from the beginning? Ruffine alleageth truely these words, descendit ad Inferna,

               but not out of any example of the Apostles Creede, yea he expresly denyeth it to be therein

any where at that time.] Cyrill and Chrysostom expound these words as parts of the common Creede receaued in their Churches, and called Apostolike, because it was descended from the Apostles times. Ruffine doth the like for the Church of Aquileia, where he was a Presbyter; he setteth downe these words as a part of the common Creede, which he expoundeth, and nameth Apostolike. And here for triall of your truth and modestie, (if you know what those things meane) I referre my selfe to the printed Copies of Cyprians and Ieroms works, (where this exposition is extant,) whether these words, crucifixus sub Pontio Pilato, & sepultus, descendit ad Inferna, He was crucified vnder Pontius Pilate, and buried, he descended to hell: be not expresly set downe as a part of the Creede, which Ruffine expoundeth and calleth Apostolike. The Copies printed at Bafile by Frobenius, and at Lyons by Gryphius, 1537; at Basile by Heruagius 1540; at Antuerpe by Crinitus, and at Paris by Stephan Petit. 1541; seuer these words with an halfe moone from Ruffinus explication, as they doe the rest of the Creede. Those printed at Rome by Paulus Manutius, 1563; at Antuerpe by Stelsius 1561; by Peter Bellerus 1589; and by Iohn de Preux 1593. at Paris by Sebastian Niuellius 1603. distinguish them by greater or different letters from the rest. So that your denying them to be part of the Creede, which Ruffine bringeth for Apostolike, is a manifest mentirie.
            
            As you peruert Ruffines wordes, so you doe his meaning. For he doth not say, that Christes descent to hell was all one with his buriall; but where the Churche of Rome with some others wanted those wordes, he descended to hell; yet with them the effect thereof was contained in the word, buried. And no maruaile, that the Church of Rome (for that he chiefly noteth by the Latin word, sepultus) extended the word buriall to hell; since they did, and to this day doe follow the olde Latine translation of the Bible Luke 16. where it is written, the rich man was buried in hell. It was an easie matter therefore for them by Christs buriall to vnderstand his descent to hell, since as they thought, they found the word so farre extended in the Scriptures. And graunt that Ruffine and others of the auncients (as you affirme) did thinke it consequent as an effect to Christs buriall, that his soule did descend to hell; what prooue you by this, but against your selfe, that such as had not those wordes expressed in their Creede, yet retained the sense and meaning of them in that they were perswaded, this was the law of humane necessitie, without Christ, that as mens bodies were buried, so their soules descended to hell; which descent Christ refused not to restore men, as Hilarie and others auouch. This you say was Ruffines owne meaning, who [Defenc. pag. 200. li. 24. 
               going about to proue by the Scripture that Christ descended to Infernum, sheweth that he meaneth his death hereby & his buriall.] I suppose few men will trust you, hauing tried you false so often. Ruffine going about to prooue by the Scripture of the old Testament, that euery part of Christes passion and his resurrection was fore-shewed in the law and the Prophets, plainely distinguisheth his death, buriall, and descent to Hell. For Christs death he saith;Ruffinus in expositione Symboli Apost. What Ruffinus meaneth by Christs descent to hell. 
               spiritum post haec scribitur reddidisse; after this it is written, that hee gaue vp the Ghost. This was fore spoken by the Prophet saying; into thy handes I commend my spirit. Sepultus quo
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   perhibetur. He is then said to be buried. For which he alleageth a place of Ieremie, and addeth. Euidentissima haec Sepulturae eius indicia propheticis vocibus designata sunt, accipe tamen & alia. These most manifest signes of his buriall are expressed in the Prophets speeches, and yet thou shalt haue other. Where he alleageth three other places of Scripture; how fitly to his purpose, I need not pronounce. Then commeth he to Christes descent to hell, and saith; Sed & quód in Infernum descendit, euidenter praenunciatur in Psalmis. That also he descended to hell, is evidently fore told in the Psalmes. Now whether his places bee aptly cited or no, is not to the question, though you make that your whole aduantage. For first, they be as aptly cited, as the rest. Next they haue euery one of them somewhat more in Rusfines apprehension, then of Christes buriall. For hee standeth not onely on those wordes, the dust and corruption of death, but hee fastneth most on the words of descending and bringing downe in limum profundi, to the mire of the deepe. Which things though you flurt at, as waighing light in your eyes, it is

certaine, he intended thereby more then the graue as is euident by his owne wordes. For citing the place of Peter thus. In which (spirit) Christ descended to preach to the spirits inclosed in prison which were incredulous in the dayes of Noe, he addeth, in quo quid operis eger
                     •…
                  m in Inferno, declaratur; in which it is declared, what Christ did in hell. In the graue I trust Christ did nothing. In Paradise he did not preach to those, that were in prison (& disobedient) in the dayes of Noe. Since then this end of Christs descent to hell is expressed by Ruffinus, and this could not bee done either in the graue, where nothing can be done; or in heauen, where these disobedients were not in prison: It is cleere that Ruffinus had no such meaning, as you make him by Christes descent to intend no more but his death and buriall.

               He holdeth indeed that Christ went downe to Infernum, that is to Limbus patrum, as an opinion then common among them, and worthie (as he thought) to be beleeued.] If hee ment this, as you now confesse; then he ment more by Christes descending to Infernum then Christes death and buriall. And so by your owne mouth you are conuinced of a lie fathered on Ruffinus against both his words & meaning. And yet I find no such expresse mention or description of Limbus in Ruffines words, as you would seeme to impose vpon him. He mentioneth Christs conquest ouer hell;

buriall, and going downe into his graue: as you acknowledge that hades many times may well signifie.] With the septuagint, that were Iewes, (and translated the old TestamentHades with Ignatius is not the graue. out of Hebrew into Greeke almost 300. yeeres before Christes birth) I said indeed Hades stood aswell for the graue as for hell, euen as the Pagans also did vse it: but the Euangelists and Apostles retaining a difference betweene Thanatos, death, and Hades, take Hades for hell, and neuer for the graue: whose example the Greeke Diuines doe follow; and therefore Hades with them doth not signifie the graue, but the place where the wicked are tormented after death, as it doth in the Gospell of S. Luke. Secondly the wordes of Ignatius agree not with that in Matthew, by which you would expound them. For Matthew saith,Matth. 27. 
               the graues did open (at Christs death) and manie bodies of the Saints, that slept, arose; and comming out of their graues,

               the first fruits, andColos. 1. 
               first borne from the dead. And therefore Ignatius did not speake this of Christes resurrection, but of his ascension, euen as Thaddeus did in the selfe same sort.Euseb. Eccle. hist. li. 1. ca. 13.

               other wordes besides; If you meane in the same sentence, there was no cause nor need he should; if you meane in the same place, it is not true: for the next sentence sauc one is this.Ignat. epist. ad Trallianos. 
               The day before the Sabbaoth at the third houre Christ receaued sentence of condemnation from Pilate, at the sixt houre he was crucified, at the ninth he breathed out his spirit, and before the Sunne-set he was laid in his graue. The Sabbaoth day he staied vnder the earth in his graue; and at the dawning of the Lords day he rose from the dead. But that Ignatius wordes can not be verified of Christes buriall, is euident by the very purport of the wordes themselues, he descended to hades alone, saith Ignatius. To his graue Christ descended not alone. Those that were crucified with him, were buried at the same time with him. Besides he descended alone, is as much as of his owne accord, and by his own force, no man helping, or accompanying him; which was not the manner of his buriall. For his bodie was buried by others, and could not of it selfe descend to the graue. His descending to hades was a voluntarie action, euen as his ascending from it was; which in a dead bodie no man can imagine. Lastly the wall neuer broken before, can not be vnderstood of the graue, since from the graue some others rose long before the death and birth of Christ, as is plaine by the storie of him, that was2. Kings 13. 
               cast dead into Eliseus graue, and ofIohn 11. 
               Lazarus.
            
            Faine you would slubber vp these things, but they hang in your teeth, and will not goe downe. [The power of the graue, or the strength of death, which remained indeed from the beginning of the world as a mightie wall not broken downe, was now (you say) by Christes death vtterly ouercome and dissolued.] In this answer you inclose three vntrueths. First,The wall of hades neuer broken but by Christ. Christ neuer descended into the power of the graue, nor strength of death, as you conceaue; they had no power or dominion ouer him, he breathed out his owne soule at his owne pleasure; to be resumed againe when pleased himselfe; though for the proofe of his death to be true and vnfained, hee was content his body should lie in the graue till the third day. Againe, the power of the graue or strength of death was no wall vnbroken from the foundation of the world. Many rose from the dead before Christ, and some were translated, thatHeb. 11. v. 5. 
               they should not see death. Thirdly, it is not yet, as you affirme, vtterly ouer come and dissolued. For the bodies of the Saints are vnder it, and so shall be till the last day; when the wicked shall rise from their graues aswell as the Saints, though not to heauenly blisse, as they shall. Besides this, the words as well of Ignatius, as these of Thaddeus, must be performed betweene Christs descent to hades and his resurrection. For so Eusebius reporteth the wordes of Thaddeus.Eusebij hist. li. 1. cap. 13. 
               Christ descended to hades, and brake the wall neuer broken before since the world began. And rose againe, and raised the dead, which had slept from the beginning. Hades then hath a partition, which neuer man brake, as Abraham told the rich man: Onely

               it the power of Christs resurrection, you say, was before them, by which onely they rose againe. But both Ignatius and Thaddens say, it was neuer broken before the time, that Christ descended to hades. They therefore doe not meane the graue, as you doe. If you say, the graue was a partition to stay men from heauen till Christ was risen, then were not the soules of the Saints in heauen, whose bodies were in the graue, which is repugnant to your owne position. So that the graue, neither hindering the body from life, nor the soule from heauen before Christs comming, was not the wall vnbroken till Christs descent to hades, of which these auncient writers speake. Our resurrection was purchased by Christs death, and openly confirmed, and assured to vs by Christs resurrection; but since it shall not be performed vnto vs till the last day, this wall is not vet actually broken downe to all Christs elect, no more then death is abolished to them, which is the last enemy, that shalbe destroied, but is not yet sub

Neither doth the Apostle call Christ the first fruits of the dead, (as you intend) because others, who rose from the graue before Christ, did rise by the vertue and power of his resurrection: you commit heerein a double error. Christ was truely the first, that euer rose from death to an immortall and celestiall life, and the power and force of his resurrection bringeth not men backe to a mortall and miserable life in this world, but to be conformed to his glorious body, that is, to incorruption and immortality.

               Thus I vnderstand your Thaddeus, also Athanasius in his Creed (as it seemeth most

               reasonably and necessarily) because they expresse neither his death nor his buriall at all in any other words saue these, he descended to hades. You runne so fast on your owne conceits, that you see not what you passe by. Hath Thaddeus no words touching Christs death? what make you then of these scant a line before;Euseb. hist. li. 1. ca. 13.

And though the Creed, prouided for the simpler sort, distinguisheth Christs crucifying, death, buriall, and descent to hell; yet what need is there, that the learned euery time they talke of Christs crosse or death, should number all these seuerally and orderly as they stand in the Creed? crucifying is enough to note his death, for they crucified him vnto death. Christs buriall had in it no more but the certainty of his death, and by Gods prouidence the vigilanc

               e of his enemies, that his body should not be thought to be stolen away by his owne Disciples. Other moment or matter of our redemption there was none in Christs buriall. The goodly words, with which you would feed vs, that in the graue he came vnder the power, strength, dominion, and kingdome of death, are rather variations for a nouice, then any points of sensible doctrine for a diuine. So that Athanasius expressing Christs suffering for our saluation, his descending to hades, and rising the third day from the dead, fully compriseth all the principall works, which Christ performed for our saluation from his crosse to his resurrection. Now what Athanasius meaneth by hades, since his works are extant in Greeke, we shall not need to depend on your partiall coniectures. We haue many plaine and perspicuous places, which deliuer his sense and meaning vnto vs. I haue shewed before, which I must not so often repeat, that Athanasius maketh two places of condemnation, whither man after death was adiudged for sinne:Athanas. de

               The bodie (of Christ) went to the graue, the soule to hades: these places being diuided with a great distance: and the graue receauing the presence of his body, (for there was his body present) and hades receiuing his (humane) spirit. Thinke you this to be plaine enough, that Christs descent to hades was not his buriall, where his body lay; but the going of his soule to hades, whither man was condemned for sinne, and which Athanasius saith, The Diuell kept as the onely place of his strength? The enemie saith he, fallen from heauen, remoued from the earth, expelled from the ayre;

Is the death of Christ none of his maine works for our Redemption? finde you now, that his buriall may be omitted, and yet the Creede not be imperfect? These things, good Sir, are implyed as consequent or antecedent to the parts expressed. For if Christ did rise the third day, he rose from the Graue, where he had lien three daies; and buried he was not, before he was dead. As also he rose not but from the dead. Wherefore in his resurrection are both his death and his buriall comprised. Besides he suffered vnto death. Which things were all plainly proposed to the simple in their Creede called Aposto like, but not in the Creedes concluded by the learned Pastours in their Councels. The same course kept the Greeke and Latin Fathers, sometimes expressing Christs death, buriall, and descent to hell: sometimes omitting some of them, as the cause required.

               Galat. 2. 
               Cephas, Peter & Bar-Ionas, and Acts 1. Iudas the brother of Iames Matthew calleth Matth. 10. 
               Lebbeus and Thaddeus. Matthew was also called Mark. 2. 
               Leui. It was a thing most vsuall with the Iewes to haue two or mo names, as appeareth in the genealogie of Christ rehearsed by Matthew and Luke, who vse many wordes in that Catalogue, no where recorded in other Scriptures. And since Thom in Hebrew, whence Thomas commeth, doth signifie no more but a Twinne, which name is common to both the brethren borne at one time; it must needs be that Thomas then had an other name to distinguish him frō his brother. This therfore is no iust exception, to discredit that auncient Record with a thing most vsuall among the Iewes. Againe with the Syria

               brother of Iames: how great reason then is it to excuse the men of Edessa, that were ignorant of the Hebrew tongue, and altogether vnacquainted with the Scriptures at that time, when this was written; if they put he for Iod, which letters are often permuted the one for the other? howbeit, as I first said, I see no ground of any iust challenge in this, that the record, which is auncient, importeth Thomas to be called Iudas in the place where he liued and died farre from Iewrie, which was a thing very common among the Iewes in their owne countrie: or Thomas to be called a Iew, and thereby to distinguish him from others that were not Iewes.

                  h to be mistaken in the Syrian writing for Thaddeus one of the twelue Apostles.] This is rather an error in you to thinke, that none were called Apostles but the twelue, orMore Apostles then twelue. that Apostle doth not sometimes signifie a Messenger. Christ himself is called the

               transforming themselues into the apostles of Christ, not that they affirmed thēselues to be of the twelue, (for Paul himselfe was none of them) but they pretended to be sent of Christ, when they were not. And so Christ meant when he said to the Angel of Ephesus,Reuel. 2. 
               Thou hast examined them which say they are Apostles, & are not; that is which say, I sent them, when I did not. Now the Syriack writer taking knowledge, that Thomas was Eusebij li. 1. ca. 13.

               Defenc. pag. 203. li. 18. 
               Further this counterfeit Thaddeus was content to receaue (and did receaue) euen from a king himselfe and also (as it seemeth) from one of his nobles Adoration and worship. Whereas the true seruants of Christ Peter and the Angel refused vtterly the same in such very maner offered vnto them by meaner persons in respect of state. Therefore this Thaddeus was some false Apostle; and came not by Christs sending.] By this reason, if it were any thing worth, you may prooue many Patriarkes and Prophets to be idolaters, and aswell receiuers, as giuers of that adoration, which you suppose is due to God alone. Omit, that the word 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                heere vsed, is with Suidas and Phauorinus as much as 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                to approch or draw neere to a man: and that Budeus obserueth it in the eccleasticall historie to be taken for a reuerend salutation; and so the King approched, or reuerently saluted Thaddeus; let it stand for bowing the bodie, which is a signe of reuerence or submission in the Scriptures; what inferre you thence? that the King, beholding the face of Thaddeus at his entrance in to shine with a strange and diuine brightnes, did him reuerence contrarie to the custome of Kings, which receaue from others, and giue not reuerence to others? If you thinke this word, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , he bowed himselfe to Thaddeus, is more then the godly may yeelde to men, or take from men; you foolishly deceaue your selfe. Of Abraham the Scripture saith, that speaking with the Hittites for a place to bury his dead, vpon their gentle and friendly answere,
            
            
               Genes. 23. vers. 7. 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , hee bowed himselfe to the people of the Land. Of Iacob when he met his Brother Esau, the Scripture saith, Genes. 33. 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ; he bowed himselfe to the earth seauen times: So Ibid. vers. 7. & 6. 
               Leah and her children, Rachel and Ioseph, Iacobs maides and their children, euery troupe of them, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                
               bowed themselues to Esau. Moses said to Pharoh, Exod. 11. 
               all these (thy) seruants shall come downe to me, 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , and shall bow them selues to me. So afterward Moses went out to 
               Exod. 18.

                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , and gently or reuerently saluted him. Infinite are the places in Scripture, where the word is vsed in that sense; and noteth the dutifull, friendly, or fauorable respect had to Superiours, Equals, and Inferiours by bowing the Body. Now whether it were meete for a King gently to intreate, or reuerently to receaue the Messenger of Christ, directed to him to cure him selfe of his sicknesse in this life, and to giue him assurance of eternall life, being no subiect of his, but a stranger sent vnto him; this is all that can be doubted. Wherein though I be most willing to reserue to Princes, not onely their Soueraigntie ouer their Subiects, but their dignitie towards strangers, yet see I no cause, but when they receaue any speciall graces or blessings of God by the hands of men not subiected to them, they should adore the giuer, which is God; and acknowledge the bringer.

               Nathan the Prophet: which if it wholy pertained to God, could not be giuen to men nor Angels without danger of Idolatrie. But the deuotion of the hart ioyned with the submission of the body, and testified thereby, is adoration due to God alone; and differeth much from ciuill curtesie and duetie reserued for Magistrates, friends, and strangers. Since then there is no such thing reported of Thaddeus, that the King fell at his feete, why compare you these examples together, which are so farre distant ech from other? of Abdus the Sonne of Abdus it is said, that hauing the goute, (and therefore not able to stand) Eusebij li. 1. ca. 13. 
               he fell at the feet of Thaddeus, and with praiers & laying on of hands was healed. Where perchance you will mislike, that Abdus was suffered to kneele, whiles praiers were said ouer him; & hands imposed on him, that he might recou

            Now what if this were profered to Thaddeus, doth that prooue, he therefore accepted

it? had he written the Storie of himselfe, it had beene his duetie,

               ot onely to refuse that, which was vnlawfull, (if it were more then was permitted to the seruants of Christ, which we doe not know) but to witnesse his refusall. But others not then well acquainted with Christian Religion being the writers thereof, how easily might they report the one, and omit the other? Looke to the Story of Daniell, and see whether he doth not say of him selfe, that Daniel. 2. vers. 46. 
               King Nabnchad-nezzar fell vpon his face, 
               
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , and bowed himselfe to Daniell, and willed them to offer Sacrifice, and sweete odours vnto him. This the King profered by Daniels owne confession and though we doe not doubt but Den

               el refused it, and otherwise aduised the king; yet there is no such thing recorded in the Text. Hence if you will conclude Daniel to be a false Prophet, you shall shew your selfe to be a rash, false and wicked teacher: but if you will excuse him, because he was one that feared God, and knew his duty, though there be no mention made of his deniall; what spleene mooueth you to condemne Thaddeus, being not him selfe the writer of the Storie, and one that was not onely trained vp in Moses Law, but a Disciple of Christs, and sent by him to preach, and which more is, endued with the power of the holy Ghost to heale the sicke, to plant the Gospell, and conuert nations vnto the faith?

               Fourthly, I doe not see how it can possibly be true which this Thaddeus saith, that Christ ascended vp to his Father with a great multitude; seeing the Scripture sheweth how after fortie dayes he ascended in all their sights alone vp to heauen.] Might Christ doe nothing, but he must first acquaint you with it, that you take so straight a view, who went vp to heauen with him?

               ascending on high, led captiuitie captiue. Who knoweth how farre, or how many? that he ascended to his Father with a multitude, may be referred either to Angels, or men. If all the Angels adored him, when he came into the world; what did they, when he ascended to heauen? Nazianzene saith,

Christ was caried vp by the handes of the Angels when he ascended to heauen not that he should haue fallen, if he had not beene stayed by Angels; but that they might serue their King. And touching men, why might not Thaddeus speake this of those, that were raised out of their graues, when Christ rose from the dead, since they were partakers of Christs resurrection, why should they be reiected from his ascension? They rose from the dead, not to die againe, much lesse to bee left wandring on the earth. Ascend before Christ they could not, he was in all things as the head to haue the preeminence. Then must they ascend with him, or after him; neither of which is expresly mentioned in the Scriptures.

               contradicted by the Church of Rome not to be Pauls. Eusebius report is the truer, because the Churches of Syria did not receiue the second Epistle of Peter, nor the second and third of Iohn, nor the Epistle of Iude, nor the Apocalypse; as appeareth to this day by the translation of the new Testament into their tongue, which wanteth all these bookes, as no approoued parts of Scripture. The like might be sayd for the Churches of Arabia. Will you hence conclude, that these parts of Scripture were not Apostolike, or that we neede not receaue them now, because they were formerly doubted of? The Creede we doe not vrge, as vndoubtedly written by all the Apostles, for then it must needes be Canonicall Scripture; but we vrge it as the best and perfectest forme of faith, which was deliuered to the Christians at the first planting of the Gospell by the direction and agreement of the Apostles, and kept and professed in some of the most famous places; which when the Church of Christ had well considered and examined, she receiued and preferred before all others. Now that this forme of faith, which we haue, was both in auncient times, and diuers places preserued and professed as comming from the first erectors of the Churches; you haue seene the testimonies of Cyrill for Ierusalem, of Chrysostome for Antioche, of Austen for Africa, of Ruffine for Aquileia, of Venantius for Poyctiers: and this very Article, he descended to hell, is by them witnessed to haue beene then in their Creedes: of whom no doubt can be made, saue of Austen onely, because he sometimes repeateth the Creede without that clause, which yet he confesseth to be a maine point of the Christian faith.
            That in all places they did varie from this forme, though you pretend the names of Ignatius, Irenaeus, Iustine, Tertullian, Origen, &c. yet they prooue no such thing. These Fathers do often, as learned discoursers, enlarge the parts of the Creed; & somtimes, as short comprisers of it, they contract the summe thereof into fewer wordes: but yetTwelue parts of the Creed. the most, and most famous churches had from the beginning a briefe collection of the Christian faith deliuered to the simple people to be learned and said by heart, before they could be baptized. Of this doe many learned and auncient Fathers beare witnesse.Ambros. serm. 38.

                  , Yet the summe aud effect of the tradition (or faith deliuered) is one and the same. Neither doe the Churches in Germany otherwise beleeue or otherwise teach, nor those in Spaine, nor those in Fraunce, nor those in the East, nor those in Egypt, nor those in Africke, nor those in the middest of the world. So that all the churches in the world had one and the same tradition and rule of faith; and though the wordes in some places did differ, yet in sense they agreed, and the chiefer the churches were, the more was their care to preserue this Creed not written, as Ierom and others confesse, but deliuered and receaued by hart euen from the Apostles and their Disciples.

               Our third reason is: if there be no certaine benefit to the godly by Christs going to hell, then doubtlesse he went not thither. But there is no certaine benefit to the godly by Christs going to hell. Therefore doubtlesse he went not thither.] You profere vs reasons very seldome, but when you push them forth, they want all things that should support them. Your maior heere hath no force in it, your minor hath no trueth; and so your conclusion is like a forward bud, that shrincketh before it bloweth. That Christ should triumph ouer powers and principal

               ies, and all knees of those in heauen, earth, and hell bow vnto him, was aswell for his soueraignty, as for our safety. Your maior then must haue both those parts in it, that if Christs descent thither were neither for his glory not our good, then was it needlesse. But it was both. He was to rise superiour to all his and our enemies, that as in the crosse he submitted his life to the rage & fury of Satan & his members, so when he rose he might be made Lord ouer heauen, earth and hell. It was therefore his right to haue the keyes of death and hell, wherby Satans kingdom aswell in hell as in earth should be subiected to the power of his humane nature, which could not be but beneficiall for vs, whose redeemer and Sauiour he was. Againe what need is there that you should know the depth of Gods counsels, and reason of Christs doings in euery thing, as though you were to take an account of him, what cause he had to doe, as he did? If the Scripture beare witnesse, that Christs soule was not left in hell, though we could not discerne the precise purpose of his descent thither, we may not therefore reiect it as superfluous. But what say you to those two maine points expressed in Scripture; the destroying of Satan, and deliuering of vs from feare of death, which Christ performed by his death? [Pag 206. li. 11. 
               The benefits all and euery one, (which you euery where rehearse) I most vnfeinedly and religiously beleeue: but what is this to his locall being in hell?] You acknowledge the words, but not the deeds of Christs destroying and spoiling Satan, through, but not after his death: and so in name, but not in proofe you make him Lord ouer hell, as where he neuer shewed the power and prerogatiue of his humane nature, but onely by taking his body from the graue. Now this doth not answere the reall and actuall subduing of Satans strength and kingdome mentioned in the Scriptures with so magnificent and euident words, as the Apostle vseth; that Christ led captiuity captiue, and made an open shew of powers and principalities, and triumphed ouer them in his owne person. You call these Pag. 2

               blasts of vanity, because I say they were performed on euery part of Satans kingdome, and euen in the place where his chiefest strength and power was, which was hell: but your replies are rather beesoms of infidelity, which would sweepe away whatsoeuer the Apostle saith of Christs most glorious triumph ouer Satan and his whole kingdome, with the taking of his flesh out of the graue, where it lay dead; and ascribe no more to Christs conquest ouer death and hell, then you doe to all the faithfull, when they shalbe raised from the earth to the fruition of eternall life. This I say is not sufficient in Christs person. For he must not onelie be free himselfe, and the freer of all his from death and hell, but all infernall places and powers were to stoope to him, as Lord of all, when God would bring him to the glory of his resurrection.

               This conquest, you say, Christ purchased by his Passion, but hee did not execute it till his resurrection. If hee executed nothing till his resurrection, and purchased all by his Passion, then he did nothing in hell. For his resurrection was distinctly after his supposed being in hell.] The Apostles wordes are plaine, that Christes crosse was his humiliation. Christ 
               Philip. 2. 
               humbled himselfe being obedient to death, euen the death of the crosse. Then Christes Passion and death were parts of his debasing, and not his triumphing ouer death or hell. After death must his triumph beginne, and not before, nor at the time of his breathing out his soule: but when the time of his resurrection came, God loosed the sorrowes of death before his humane soule, which was not left destitute of glory & soueraintie in hell, and raised his bodie from the graue, restoring him to life as the subduer and

Lord of all his enemies, that is as well of hell as of death. You would calculate the minutes, and see what distance of time there was betwixt the returne of Christes soule from hell, and the raising of his bodie from the graue; but this is like the rest of your vanities, to be more then audacious in blasing your owne deuises, and curious in searching Gods secrets reserued to himselfe. What time the soule of Christ ascended to Paradise, or descended to hell, we doe not know; we must leaue that to God; it sufficeth vs, that Christes Soule by the witnesse of holy Scripture was not lest in hell, nor his flesh in the graue, but both restored to life as conquerers of death and hell.Christs resurrection sheweth his conquest ouer hell and death.

               I would willingly beleeue you, but alas who sayth so besides your selfe; or onely such as can tell no better then you.] If auncient Fathers and later writers, if prouinciall & generall Councels did not professe the same that I doe, you might beleeue as you list; but if they all concurre, that this is testified in the Scriptures, which you labour to elude with phrases and figures; then pitie your selfe as stretching and shrinking the Scriptures at your pleasure; pitie not me, who haue the maine consent of all ages, and Christian assemblies (from the Apostles to this very time, wherein we liue) to interpret the wordes of the holy Ghost, as I doe; and to make Christes subduing of hell consequent to his death and precedent to his resurrection. Neither can the Apostles wordes, (that Ch

This Conquest we both beleue; neither may we much differ aboutChrists manhoode must conquere hell. the time, since it must be through his death, and so after he was dead, and before his resurrection; the manner is all that is questioned, which you say was without any presence of his humane soule, and consequently must be referred to his diuine nature.

And since this conquest ouer hell was reall in proofe, not verball in claime; speciall to Christes person, not generall to all his members; and performed after Christes death, not by Christes diuine, but by his humane nature; this must needs be referred to Christes soule; which might descend to hell, and must before it could shew it selfe vanquisher of hell; and not to his bodie, which lay dead in the graue, and could neither ascend nor descend till it was restored to life. You make Christ Lord ouer hell, because he kept himselfe from thence; but so were all the faithfull, whose soules were not inclosed in hell; whom yet the Scriptures make not Lords ouer death and hell, but deliuered from both. There must be a conquest peculiar to Christ, whereby he did take all power from them, and reserued it to himselfe, and rose from death, as hauing the keyes of both. The particular manner whereof in time and other such circumstances, though the Scriptures do not expresse, yet must not the general be doubted, because the Scriptures witnesse, that Christs soule was not left, nor for saken in hell of Gods diuine power and presence, but thence returned as conquerer of all Satans power and Dominion.

To which if you will adde, which is the true intent of all those places, that Christ was to rise a perfect conquerer of death and hell you shall make so many proofes that Christ conquered both before and with his resurrection, and by no meanes after it. For his resurrection was manifest proofe, that neither his soule was forsaken in hel, nor his flesh left to see corruption in the graue; and therefore both hell and death were perfectly subdued, when he ioined againe his soule to his body, and aduanced them both to an immortall and celestiall life.

Against whose soule and body since neither destruction nor corruption could preuaile it was not possible, but he should rise vanquisher and Lord of death and hell. And where you thinke it absurd, that one part of Christ, (his soule) should gloriously triumph, the other, (his body) ALL THIS WHILE lying in humiliation; the time was not so long, as you would haue it seeme; since these things were done in that shortnesse and neerenesse of

And euen according to your owne conceit, if the soule were in heauen all the while, that the body lay dead in the graue; did not the exaltation of the soule in heauen begin a good while before the body, which the third day was restored to life, and till that time lay senselesse in the dishonor and dominion of the graue, as you conceaue? And is this so strange a thing with you in Christian religion, that Christs soule should enioy honor, blisse, and glory before the body, when the soules of the faithfull so many hundred yeeres before their bodies are partakers of heauenly ioy?

And therefore your strong likelihoods, as you call them, are childish conceits and distrusts of Christs power and habilitie to performe his victory. Like to these are those other points which you aske. Pag. 208. li. 15. 
               Why might not one part of Christ haue sufficed in his sufferings, righteousnesse & obedience (which Apollinaris an heretick affirmed,) as well as that one part serued to triumph for vs in hell?] Christ suffered for vs in this life, where body and soule were ioyned together in suffering and meriting; but he conquered hell by death, that is after death, when the Soule was yet seuered from the Body. What Apollinaris the Heretick affirmed, you vnderstand not, if you thinke he did hold that the Soule of Christ did suffer or merite for vs: his heresie was, that Christ had no humane Soule, but his Deitie did mooue and rule his body in steede of a Soule. Next you aske, [Pag. 208. li. 18. 
               Why the body ouer comming corruption in the graue, which I call a part of Satans kingdome, did not thereby destroy the whole kingdome of Satan, and so saue our Soules, that Christ might not haue needed to haue come to hell for that purpose?] He that hath nought else to doing, may intend to aske such idle questions. Why God would haue the flesh of his Sonne by resisting corruption in the graue to assure our bodies of incorruption; and his Soule by subduing hell, to free our Soules from the power and feare of hell; you were best aske him a reason, whose will is the rule of all things: but since we were in danger and feare of both deaths, least the one should lead vs to the other, which was most to be feared; what reason can you bring against the Counsell and wisdome of God confirming vs against the power of death and hell, by the conquest of both parts of Christs manhoode ouer both his and our enemies? You would otherwise haue ordered our safetie and indemnitie, from death and hell, if your aduise had been asked; but nourish these impieties at home in your bosome; blaze them not so busily to the world, as if you would beleeue nothing till you saw

a reason thereof that fitted your fansie. What God might haue done, is not for you nor me to aske; what improportion or discohaerence with the Christian faith is there in this, that the power of Christs Soule and Body superiour to hell and to the graue, should assure our Bodies and Soules the victorie ouer both in such sort and at such time, as God hath appointed?

               If they meane, that Christs flesh being in the graue and his soule being in hell did seuerally and distinctly saue our flesh and our soules, then how will you be reconciled to them, who doe denie that point? You would faine put downe Fulgentius, Athanasius, and others; as if they did not vnderstand the first points of their Catechisme, that the ioynt Redemption of our Soules and Bodies was obtained by the ioynt-sufferings of Christ in Soule and Body on the Crosse; but yet since we are to die, when our Soules shall be seuered from our bodies; to assure vs that our Soules are freed by the merits of his passion from the danger of hell, and our bodies shall be raised from the dust of the earth, why might it not please the Sonne of God by the presence of his body in the graue without corruption to confirme the Resurrection of our bodies from corruption, and by the presence of his Soule in hell, subduing the power and kingdome of Satan, to strengthen our faith, that our Soules seuered from our bodies shall be free from all danger and feare of hell, which he hath conquered in his owne person, and whereof he hath taken the keyes into his hands, as him selfe affirmeth? This was no new sauing of our Soules and bodies, as you suppose; but rather the securing of vs by his example, that our Soules and bodies seuered by death, shall be subiected to neither, but be reserued to eternall life, that we may be partakers of his victorie.

               Further, why was it needefull, that an actuall presence of his manhoode should be in hell, seeing indeede it is certaine, that the whole actuall triumph of Christ ouer Satan proceedeth not of the proper vertue of the manhood, but only from the vertue & power of the Godhead of Christ? Conflict between the godhead of Christ & Satan there neither was, nor mightChrists manhood was to conquere though by power of his Godhead. be any: but as by Adams disobedience Satan gained vs into his possession, so by the obedience of Christs manhood euen to the death, Satan lost vs out of his power and dominion. Neither might the Deitie of Christ through death be made Lord ouer all his enemies, except you will touch on a trick of Arianisme; but the manhoode of Christ for his submission vnto death receiued the keyes of death & hell, and power to dispose of Satans kingdome at his pleasure. Now had not those Infernall powers been subiected to the Soule of Christ after death, how should it haue appeared that his manhood, not his godhead, had the conquest ouer Satans strongest holds, and that the keves of death and hell were resigned vnto him? for since the Scripture beareth witnesse, that his Soule was not for saken in hell, that is not there left destitute of his diuine power & glory, what resistance could be made, that he should not returne thence the Lord and Ruler of all his enemies, whereof hell and Satan were the chiefest?

And from dust to restore them, sheweth greater power in Christ then to preserue them from dust.

This indeed was one of the causes, euen to secure vs by his conquest, that hee hath the keyes of death and hell; and therefore we shall not need to feare either, since both are wholy subiected and submitted to his power, though he stay the time prefixed by his father, when we shall be partakers of his victorie ouer death at the end of the world, as we are ouer hell at our departing hence; assuring vs in this life by faith in him, that we neede not feare either death or hell, both which he hath conquered.

               I made this argument in my former Treatise; that Christes descending into hell (if euer he did so) could not be iudged any part of his exaltation or glorification. To which your reply is, I know not whether more strange or skornefull. But you resolue that these words, hee descended to hell, importeth his exaltation and triumph.] This argument was drawen from your imagination taking vpon you to dispose of the parts of the Creede as best pleased you, which because I reiected, as wanting all warrant besides your owne note booke, you interpret it to be a strange and skornefull answere. Howbeit there is no strangenesse in mine answere, but to him that neuer peeped farder then in his owne shell. The Fathers with one consent referre that clause to Christs Conquest ouer hell. Christ

               When in Christs presence hell being broken open, captiuitie was captiuated, his conquering soule presented to the sight of his Father, returned to her bodie without delay. Epiphanius. Epiphanius in 80. heresium. anacephalaiosi.

               Reddunt Inferna victorem. Hell restored him a conquerer; and whiles his bodie lay in the graue, his soule triumphed ouer hell. The Councels prouinciall and generall do the like, Concilium Toleta. 4. ca. 10. & Arelatens. ca. 1. 
               Christ descended to hell, & deuicto mortis imperio, and subduing the kingdome of death, rose the third day. Euen as the generall Councels of Ephesus and Constantinople say. Yea the later writers, as Innocent. de mysterijsmissae. li. 2. ca. 50. 
               Innocentius, 
               Durand. in rationali. diuinorum li. 4. rub. de Symbolo. 
               Durandus, and others ioyne this clause with Christs resurrection, and make them both but one Article of our faith, as descendit ad inferna, tertia die resurrexit, he descended to hell, and rose the third day, they set for the fift Article of the Creede; euen as that auncient writer among Saint Austens Appendix de diuersis sermo. 42. workes did before them. So that neither Elder, nor later writers ioyne with you in this conceit of yours; that Christes descent to hell was the lowest part of his humiliation; they directly professe it to be the first part of his exaltation, and a preamble to his resurrection. And where you thinke it much, that his descending should belong to his exaltation, not the place, but the purpose of his descent maketh that alteration. The Scripture saith. 1. Thess. 4. ver. 16. 
               The Lord himselfe shall descend from heauen with a shoute and with the trumpet of God, when he shall come to iudge the quicke and dead: and yet that descent shall be the greatest part of his glorie.
            
               Defenc. pag. 209. li. 12. 
               You skoffe at me for the like, as if I had said his descending was ascending, and heauen was Hell. But herein you affirmevntruely. First I say though his soule leauing his bodie ascended, yet this is not meant by that phrase, he descended to Hades. Secondly, I neuer sayd that Hades signified heauen, although some in Hades are in heauen. Thirdly, much lesse did I euer say that hell is heauen.] The interpretation, which you made of the Article, Christ descended to hell, I sayd had none other matter of faith in it (except you thought the Church in her Creede went to varying of phrases) but that Christs soule ascended to heauen. For where Hades in the Creede must signifie not a priuation, nor a generall and indefinite condition, (as if Christ went some whither, yet no man knew whither) but a determined place, whither Christs soule after death repaired; that place of force must be heauen or hell. And since by no meanes you will haue Christs soule descend to hell, as the whole Church hath hitherto receaued and beleeued, you must acknowledge the meaning of that Article to be, that Christs soule ascended to heauen: and so

whether you will or no, if that be the effect and intent of those wordes in the Creede, descending must be taken for ascending, and hell for heauen. This is not meant, you say, by that phrase.] It is one of your skilles to bring Articles of the Creede to be phrases, as if the Apostles and their followers, which were the first planters of Churches, had ment to teach the simple people not principles of faith, but certaine Greeke or Hebrew phrases. He that will suffer you to turne his faith into a phrase, let him take heed that insteed of heauen he light not on hel, which is one of your chiefe phrases. [But you neuer said that Hades signified heauen. You may saue this from a lie, if you be not he that wrote this part of your booke; as by the crossing and changing of your owne assertions it is euident to euery wise man, you did not: but otherwise, if the quoting of other mens authoritie to prooue Hades to be heauen, may conuince you to be of that mind with them, whom you cite for that purpose; you haue most plainely auouched hades to import and containe heauen. Whose words are these, I pray you, in your Treatise? Treat. pag. 97. li. 28. 
               This most singular place sheweth, that Hades with them is not properly for hell, but for the world of the dead; and SOMETIMES AS NAMELY HEERE EVEN FOR HEAVEN. So in the next page. Pag. 98. li. 6.

               That of the Councels, how Christ rose againe hauing spoiled hell, I easily yeeld; seeing that prooueth not his locall being there. Then first you yeeld, that Hades with all these generall Councels signifieth hell. Next you yeeld that hell was spoyled by Christ before he rose; for he rose hauing spoyled hell. Thirdly you yeeld, that this was done by Christes manhood, since his Godhead can be said in no wise to rise from the dead; and consequently by his soule, since he spoiled hell before he rose, when yet his bodie was dead in the graue. There remaineth no more but this question, whether the soule of Christdid this absent from the place, or present in the place, which was spoiled. And since the scriptures auouch, that Christs soule was in Hades, which was spoiled; as these three generall Councels assirme; it is without question, that Christes soule present in hell, spoiled hell before his resurrection, and so returned to his bodie; which is the very point you all this while denied, and with so much lost labour impugned. And least this cause should depend on your slipper turnes and returnes, we must vnderstand, that not only the generall Councell of Acta conc

So that what sense Cyrill had in these wordes, the same did the Councell of Ephesus follow, Cyrill himselfe there sitting, and declaring his owne meaning. Yea the Treatises of Cyrill expounding these wordes are inserted into the Acts of the Councell of Ephesus, which the Councels of Chalcedon and Constantinople doe fully approoue. Now what Cyrill meant by spoiling hades, appeareth in these words. Cyrill de recta fide ad Reginas li. 2. ca. quòd Christus in virtute patris resurrexit à mort

               The same I affirme of that Allegory in Luke; which sheweth Christs ouercomming, binding and spoiling of Satan indeed: but not by his locall being in hell. Christ expressely applieth it to his dispossessing of Diuels out of mens bodies. I did not alleage this parable to prooue Christs going to hell in soule after death, but to shew what parts Christs conquest ouer hell and Satan must haue; to wit, that he must subdue, bind, and spoile Satan, before his conquest ouer Satan, could be perfect. Other places of Scripture applied these parts to Christs rising from the dead, and spoiling the kingdome of Satan; for this parable it did suffice, that these things heere mentioned must be fully performed by Christ, before he did fully conquere Satan. Now that these things were throughly performed by Christ, whiles he liued on earth, is repugnant to the Scriptures. For so Christ should neuer haue died, since death was a part of Satans power, which Christ was to spoile. It is therefore certaine, that Christs ouermastering of Satan began here on earth, when he cast him out from such as were possessed, but Christs conquest ouer Satan, had not his sull and complete higth, no not in his owne person, till he rose from the dead, and ascended to heauen, leading captiuity captiue. That therefore it began before Christs death, I doe not denie; but that it was not finished till his resurrection and ascension, the Scriptures auouch. Christ saith Origen, Origen li. 5. in ca. 6. ad.

               hauing bound the strong man, and by his crosse conquered him, went euen to his house, to the house of death, and into hell; and thence tooke his goods, that is, the soules, which he possessed. And this was that, which he spake by a Parable in the Gospell, saying: Who can enter a strong mans house, and spoile his goods, except he first bind the strong man? So Ierom. Hiero in ca. 12. Matthe

               The Apostle to the Ephesians the 4. (where he speaketh of Christs triumph, and saith, he led captiuity captiue, that is, he led the Diuel captiue, and triumphed ouer him) doth not there say, this triumph was made on the crosse, but then performed (that is perfected) when Christ ascended to heauen. Christ then obteined it on the Crosse, but performed it afterwards. 
               Ibidem. 
               Of euill spirits subdued and spoiled, the Sonne of God triumphed. Whither pertaineth that parable of Christs, when a strong man keepeth his house (his goods are in peace) but when a stronger then he commeth vpon him, he taketh his spoiles from him.

               Where you charge me in the end arrogantly and absurdly to falsisie the Synod of this Realme, it is but what your selfe doth in effect. I said our Synod corrected King Edwards Synod. You acknowledge and professe that in the later words of that former Synod now left

out are three things that cannot be iustified by the Scriptures.] If a man would hire you, you cannot leaue this outfacing and falsifying, no not, when you goe about to cleare your selfe of it, which whether it be absurd or arrogant, I leaue to the Reader. Our Synod, you said, corrected King Edwards Synod.] Said you no more? did you not lustily conclude; Treatis pag. 172. 
               Therefore our Synod renounceth apparantly this sense of the Creed, that Christ descended to the hell of the damned? Now that is nothing so; they thought not good in this Article of the Creed to expresse more then was aunciently set downe for the people to beleeue: but they doe not reiect as false, whatsoeuer they omit of the later words of King Edwards Synod. For so they should reiect this also for false, that Christs body lay in the graue till his resurrection, which I trust no Christian man doubteth. Three things I said there were, which the later Synod might conceaue to be conteined in the former, that could not be iustified by the Scriptures; and in that respect they might leaue out those later words, not cutting of, putting out, or casting away (as you ruffle in your termes) euery thing there mentioned, for so they should cast away aswell the buriall of Christs body, as the presence of his soule in hell, but refraining to confirme those later words, both because there was somewhat amisse in them, and they would not impose more on the people to beleeue, then was at first comprised in their Creed; as also for that they would not establish this to be the right and vndoubted sense of Peters words, that Christ in soule preached to the spirits in hell.

                  arge these words of King Edwards Synod with two points, which are not in them.

In me you would make this a great matter so to misreport the words of a Synod, which indeed saith nothing hereof.] Were there no more but this in the words of that Synod, that the preaching of Christ to the spirits in hell is set downThe things misliked in king Edwards synod. there as the sole cause of his descent thither; or that this sense of S. Peters words is imposed on all men by their authority to be beleeued: either of these was reason sufficient to omit those later words of King Edwards Synod. But if we rightly looke into the manner and purpose of their speach, we shall easily see, that I wrong them not. For by those words they ment to shew the places, where Christs soule and body did abide, after they were seuered, vntill the resurrection.

               with the spirits in prison or hell, and preached to them, as the place of Peter doth witnesse. To say, that the soule of Christ dismissed from his body, was not at all in the place, where the spirits of the iust were, had been repugnant to Peters words in the next Chapter; if we grant as they did, by these words of Peter, that Christ preached to the dead. For there it is said, The Gospell (that is, the glad tidings of Redemption performed) was preached to the dead. Which could not be to the wicked, since the Gospell was not preached vnto thē, but the iustnesse of their condemnation rather published vnto them. Since then as they tooke S. Peters words, Christ preached to both the iust and vniust, and by their Article, declaring where Christ abode after death, no more is expressed, but that Christ was with the spirits in prison and hell, and preached vnto them; How can it in any reasonable mans iudgement be auoided, but that their words implie, the iust were in prison and in hell, where Christ preached? Neither was this so strange a thing in those daies, since many hundred yeeres before it was receaued in most mens mouths and minds, that the iust deceased before Christs death were in the same place (called hell) with the wicked, though not in the same paines; and many of the Fathers directly affirme no lesse. Seing then themselues in their words make no difference betwixt the iust and vniust; and generally auouch, that Christs soule was with the spirits in hell, and preached to them, by warrant of Peters words, who saith, The Gospell was preached to the dead; What reason had I to wrest their words to any other sense then that, which I saw currant in many fathers before them, whose steps, by the generall purport of their words they seemed to follow? And how iustly might the later Synod refuse those words of theirs, which were either so dangerons,

or so doubtfull, that they might not safely be retained?

               It is well that you renounce that of Peter (by Austens direction) as making not at all for any locall being of Christ in hell. But yet herein your selfe openly refuseth the mind of all your Predecessors, yea of our later Synode, if they beleeued as you vrge they did. For if they liked Christs locall being in hel, they misliked not the applying of that in Peter thereunto: as by Master Nowels Catechisme may appeare.] It is true, that I refrained to bring those places of Peter, because Saint Austen, though he strongly hold Christs descent to hell to be a part of the Christian faith, yet he perceaued and confessed these places might haue an other sense, and nothing touch Christs descent to hell. Your illation, that if the Synode liked Christs locall being in hell, they misliked not the applying of that in Peter thereunto, is like the rest of your collections. As if Saint Austen did not like the one, and yet mislike the other. Notwithstanding there is difference betwixt liking a quotation as some way pertinent to the cause, and proposing the same as a part of Christian Religion for all men of necessitie to imbrace. The Synode might doe the one, and yet not the other; and so iustly leaue out that clause of the former Synode, though Peters words in their opinions might haue some such intent. Neither doe I preiudice any man to like or alleadge that place of Peter for this purpose, since I bind no man to my priuate exposition of the Scriptures; but rather stand on those places which haue the full consent of all antiquitie to pertaine directly to this matter. Yet this is no barre, but many auncient Fathers did vse that place of Peter to prooue Christs descent to hell, as Athanas. episi a

There is no doubt, but Austens sense hath some difficulties and must haue some open additions to the text, before it will agree therewith; as by which he went, and preached to (those that now are) spirits in prison (and were) once disobedient in the daies of Noah. Againe, neither wicked men liuing on earth, are called

               spirits, by the course of the Scriptures; neither were the despisers of Noahs preaching then in prison, when he preached. Besides that Peter heere purposely speaking of the death of Christ, verse 18. persueth the consequents thereof in order, as his descent to the spirits in prison vers. 19. his resurrection, vers. 21. his ascension and sitting on the right hand of God vers. 22. The impediment to the former sense is, that they onely are mentioned, which were disobedient in the daies of Noah; where if we make the former words to be generall, in which he went, and preached to the spirits in prison, and the next speciall, as the point between may entend, (and) to the disobedient in the daies of Noah; or if this example be produced as the most famous, wherein the whole and first world was drowned; and so likest to the time of preaching the Gospell, the contempt whereof should bring destruction on the second world and the iust be saued by water, (as Noah was) through the resurrection of Christ; that impediment is likewise remooued. Howbeit I leaue it indifferent to euery man to follow, what sense he liketh best, the rather for that many old and new interpreters referre these words of Peter, that Christ preached to the spirits in prison, and
