although a fault by me is committed
in making you patronesse of so slender a
peece without your knowledge, yet hoping vpon
your honourable curtesie, which rather respecteth
the mind of the giuer, than the worthinesse
of the gift; & poizing the giuers desire to please
and zeale to profit, more than the quality of the
offense, I doo assure my selfe to be remitted of
the trespasse; which maketh me thinke
my trauell not onelie sweet, but

            PAsse forth my Booke into the hands
            and view of sundrie men:
            Humble thy selfe, declare thy name
            who thee thus clad, and when.
            And blush not at the frumps of some,
            ne feare at others frowne:
            More rich thou art in thred-bare cote,
            than some in silken gowne.
            And giue them all to vnderstand,
            from whence thou first didst spring,
            How thou wast fostred in the breast
            and bosome of a king.
            And so (perhaps) some worthie wight
            will shape thee rich araie,
            And set thee foorth as thou deseru'st
            with costlie iewels gaie.
            Behaue thy selfe in such good fort,
            if possiblie maie bee,
            That eu'rie one may thee embrace,
            and wish well vnto mee.

            halfe naked though I bee,
            Or not attird so gallantlie,
            as you desire to see.
            Yet this from me your selues assure,
            such substance here to find,
            As shall bring hope vnto the hart,
            and comfort to the mind.
            Oft vnder short and simple weed,
            such vertue may be found,
            As vnder pall of purple hew
            that traileth on the ground.
            I being good, am not the woorse,
            though clothing mine be bad,
            He that bestowd the same on me,
            aid giue the best he had.
            In whose behalfe I humblie praie,
            and for my selfe also,
            You would vouch safe to mend those faults,

                     Wee wander heere in wildernesse,
                     and euerie day doo fall.
                  
                  
                     Sweet Iesu, come and visit mee,
                     my heauie soule make glad,
                     Which now through sinne in prison lies,
                     all heauie, sicke, and sad.
                  
                  
                     
                     Good Iesu, with thy presence set
                     my soule at libertie,
                     And for thy bitter passion sake,
                     haue mercie now on mee: Amen.
                     
                  
                  
                     O Iesu, oft it greeueth mee,
                     and troubleth sore my mind,
                     That I so weake and fraile am found,
                     to wander with the blind.
                  
                  
                     O Iesu deare, thou lasting light,
                     whose brightnesse doth excell,
                     The clearnes of thy beams send downe,
                     within my heart to dwell.
                  
                  
                     O Iesu, quicken thou my soule,
                     that it may cleaue to thee,
                     And for thy painefull passion sake,
                     haue mercie now on mee: Amen.
                     
                  
                  
                     O Iesu, grant I may resigne
                     my selfe vnto thy will,
                     And that I may my selfe forsake,
                     and cleaue vnto thee still.
                  
                  
                     O Iesu, grant that I may haue
                     of ioie and inward peace,
                     And of the paines I haue deseru'd,
                     Good Iesu me release.
                  
                  
                     Sweet Iesu, giue me inward ioie,
                     my soule to feed on thee,
                     
                        
And for thy tender mercies sake,
                     haue mercie Lord on mee: Amen.
                     
                  
                  
                     O Iesu sweet, I knowe I am,
                     but vanitie and sin,
                     Vnconstant as the wind that blowes,
                     and euer so haue bin.
                  
                  
                     Whereof then Iesu may I brag?
                     or what haue I to say?
                     Shall I of men seeke to bee prais'd?
                     or yet extold for ay?
                  
                  
                     No Iesu sweet, the true praise is,
                     for to be prais'd of thee;
                     Wherfore, good Iesu, weigh my case,
                     and mercie haue on mee: Amen.
                     
                  
                  
                     O Iesu, thou my glorie art,
                     in thee will I reioice,
                     And not, good Iesu, in my selfe,
                     nor yet in that mans voice,
                  
                  
                     That worldlie honour may mee giue,
                     to set mee vp on hie:
                     To rule among the sonnes of men,
                     and sit in dignitie.
                  
                  
                     These are but shadowes to compare,
                     to glorie that's with thee;
                     Sweet Iesu, for thy glorie sake,
                     haue mercie now on mee: Amen.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     O Iesu, heere in earth we liue,
                     and soone deceiued are
                     With vaine delights ye world doth yeeld;
                     wherein we runne too farre.
                  
                  
                     But yet, sweet Iesu, if I could
                     behold my selfe right well,
                     I should, good Iesu; plainelie see,
                     and thereby trulie tell,
                  
                  
                     The troubles that are falne on mee,
                     were for offending thee;
                     For which offense I pardon craue,
                     haue mercie Lord on mee: Amen.
                     
                  
                  
                     O Iesu Christ, vnder whose power,
                     is both the sea and land:
                     Arise and helpe, me to defend,
                     by power of thy strong hand,
                  
                  
                     From such as lurke and lie in wait,
                     and seeke to doo me wrong:
                     Sweet Iesu, see how weake I am,
                     and how that they be strong.
                  
                  
                     Iesu, make hast and come with speed,
                     my trust is all in thee,
                     And therefore Iesu, helpe me now,
                     and mercie haue on mee: Amen.
                     
                  
                  
                     O Iesu, comfort mine exile,
                     asswage my dole and greefe,
                     
                        
With thee to bee is my desire,
                     mine onelie cheefe releefe.
                  
                  
                     Iesu, the pleasures of this world,
                     they may not long indure;
                     And he that puts his trust therein,
                     shall find them all vnsure.
                  
                  
                     Sweet Iesu, grant that I may haue
                     mine onelie ioie in thee;
                     And for thy bloudie passion sake,
                     haue mercie now on mee: Amen.
                     
                  
                  
                     O Iesu Christ, that hast mee made,
                     and with thy bloud mee bought:
                     Suffer mee not to be condemn'd,
                     whom thou hast made of nought.
                  
                  
                     O Iesu mild, in time of need
                     thy mercie doo bestowe,
                     And in thy iustice iudge mee not,
                     nor doo thy rigor showe.
                  
                  
                     O Iesu, in extremitie,
                     I doo appeale to thee;
                     Wherefore sith that I trust in thee,
                     haue mercie now on mee: Amen.
                     
                  
                  
                     O Iesu sweet, for heauenlie things
                     I often seeke to find,
                     But then affections of the world
                     doo backeward plucke my mind.
                  
                  
                     
                     Againe, I seeke for to subdue
                     th'affections that doo rise,
                     But to my spirit they will not be
                     subiect in anie wise.
                  
                  
                     Thus Iesu meeke, thou seest I striue,
                     and all to bee with thee,
                     Wherefore good Iesu make mee strong,
                     and mercie haue on mee: Amen.
                     
                  
                  
                     O Iesu, many times I praie,
                     and call vpon thy name;
                     When that my heart is farre away,
                     alas I more to blame.
                  
                  
                     And that good Iesu coms to mind,
                     that custome often brought,
                     Whereby the praiers that I make,
                     be vaine and turne to nought.
                  
                  
                     Sweet Iesu, pardon and forgiue,
                     when I so praie to thee,
                     And for thy endlesse mercie sake,
                     haue mercie Lord on mee: Amen.
                     
                  
                  
                     O Iesu, be not long away,
                     nor in thy wrath depart,
                     But mortifie that flesh desires,
                     and lighten thou my hart:
                  
                  
                     Send foorth the burning flames of loue,
                     cleane to consume for ay;
                     
                        
The cloudie fansies of my mind,
                     which trouble me alway.
                  
                  
                     Good Iesu, gather all the powers
                     of my poore soule to thee;
                     And make me to refuse the world,
                     and mercie haue on me: Amen.
                     
                  
                  
                     O Iesu mild, thine eare bow downe,
                     and ponder my desire;
                     Deale not with me as I deserue,
                     to punish in thine ire:
                  
                  
                     But me defend, ô Iesu meeke,
                     through mercie great of thine,
                     From dangers such as may befall
                     this sinfull soule of mine.
                  
                  
                     O Iesu, hide not now thy face,
                     from him that calles on thee;
                     But Iesu, for thy bitter death,
                     haue mercie now on mee: Amen.
                     
                  
                  
                     O Iesu sweet, with mercie now
                     reforme that is amisse,
                     And with the strength of thy great grace,
                     send light where darknesse is.
                  
                  
                     Good Iesu, from my secret faults,
                     doo make me cleane and bright,
                     And from presumptuous sins, ô Lord,
                     defend me through thy might.
                  
                  
                     
                     Good Iesu, cast my youthfull sinnes
                     behind thy backe to bee;
                     And for thy tender mercie sake,
                     haue mercie now on mee: Amen.
                     
                  
                  
                     O Iesu, shut not vp my soule
                     with those that run astraie,
                     But let the shadow of thy wings,
                     my soule protect alwaie.
                  
                  
                     Good Iesu, turne thee vnto me,
                     and cleanse me from my sin,
                     Sweet Iesu Christ, doo not behold,
                     how wicked I haue bin:
                  
                  
                     But thinke vpon thy mercies great,
                     though I vnworthie bee;
                     And for thy pain
                           •
                        full passion sake,
                     haue mercie now on mee: Amen.
                     
                  
                  
                     O Iesu sweet, giue me an hart,
                     that is contrite and pure,
                     A bodie chast, that humble is,
                     and constant to endure.
                  
                  
                     A mind that is with heauenlie ioies
                     replete through thy great grace,
                     A soule likewise to magnifie
                     thy praise in eu'rie place.
                  
                  
                     O Iesu, for thy mercie sake,

                     omnipotent be all:
                     And yet not three omnipotents,
                     but one beleeue we shall.
                  
                  
                     The Father God, the Sonne is God,
                     the holie Ghost also:
                     And yet three Gods we shall not say,
                     of Gods but one, no mo.
                  
                  
                     The Father Lord, the Sonne is Lord,
                     and holie Ghost is Lord:
                     Yet not three Lords, but one in three,
                     and three in one accord.
                  
                  
                     For like as we compelled be,
                     by Christian veritie,
                     Ech person of them to confesse,
                     both God and Lord to bee:
                  
                  
                     
                     So are we by the same forbid,
                     in anie wise to saie,
                     Three Gods to be, or yet three Lords,
                     but three in one alwaie.
                  
                  
                     The Father is not created,
                     begot, nor made of none:
                     The Sonne ne made nor created,
                     begot of him alone.
                  
                  
                     The holie Ghost is from them both,
                     ne made, create, nor got;
                     But from the father and the sonne
                     proceeding had, we wot.
                  
                  
                     So then there is of fathers one,
                     not fathers three, we see:
                     One sonne, not three: and so likewise,
                     one holie Ghost to bee.
                  
                  
                     And in this holie Trinitie,
                     is none more great than other:
                     But that the whole three persons be
                     coequall altogither.
                  
                  
                     So that in all, as foresaid is,
                     the Vnitie in three,
                     And Trinitie in Vnitie,
                     ought worshipped to bee.
                  
                  
                     Yet furthermore, it needefull is
                     vnto saluation,
                     That we beleeue of lesus Christ
                     the incarnation.
                  
                  
                     
                     The right faith is, that we beleeue,
                     and with one mouth foorth-show,
                     That Iesus Christ the sonne of God,
                     is God and man also.
                  
                  
                     God of his Father substance is,
                     begot ere world was wrought,
                     And man, by flesh and bloud he tooke,
                     of hir who foorth him brought.
                  
                  
                     Both perfect God, and perfect Man,
                     is he without diuiding:
                     And of a reasonable soule,
                     and humane flesh abiding.
                  
                  
                     He to the Father equall is,
                     touching his Deitie:
                     But he is lesse than Father is,
                     by his humanitie.
                  
                  
                     Who though he be both God and man,
                     yet one is he, not twaine:
                     That is to saie, one Iesus Christ,
                     for euer to remaine.
                  
                  
                     One, not by turning Godhead his
                     into the flesh we see:
                     But taking manhood into God,
                     by power of Deitie.
                  
                  
                     One, yet not by confusion
                     of this his substance sure:
                     But by Vnitie of person,
                     which euer shall endure.
                  
                  
                     
                     For as the reasonable soule
                     and flesh one man dooth make:
                     So God and man is but one Christ,
                     which suffered for our sake.
                  
                  
                     And then descended into hell,
                     the third day rose againe:
                     From death to life, thus hath he done,
                     mankind to rid from paine.
                  
                  
                     And after this ascended he

                     a rightfull iudge to bee:
                     To iudge the liuing and the dead,
                     as he their woorks shall see.
                  
                  
                     At whose descending all shall rise,
                     in twinkling of an eie:
                     And with this flesh shall him behold,
                     in throne of Maiestie.
                  
                  
                     Then they that haue done righteouslie,

                     And what is this compassion then,

                     Our fathers old the same haue felt,

                     Our fathers were conceiu'd in sinne,

                     compassion haue on mee.
                     Ponder, ô God, my harts desire,
                     most humblie doo I craue;
                     And doo away all my misdeeds,
                     and so compassion haue.

                     whose number is vnknowne,
                     Thou didst vouchsafe to drawe to thee,
                     and make them all thine owne:
                     So now vouchsafe, most gentle God,

                     LIke as the guiltie prisoner stands,
                     before the iudge so tride,
                     With quaking breath, & shiuering limbs,

                     And guiltie crie to thee my iudge,
                     and now hold vp my hand.
                     Nothing haue I to plead for life,
                     no goodnesse is in mee:
                     Of sinne, deceit, and wickednesse,

                     Condemn'd am I to endlesse paine,

                     his head becrown'd with thorne,
                     His bodie naild on crosse of tree,
                     his hart with speare was torne.
                     Thus all his bloud he shed,
                     to death his life made thrall,
                     To pacifie his fathers wrath,
                     procur'd by Adams fall.
                     He died, and was buried,
                     descended downe to hell,
                     From death to life he rose againe,
                     he loued vs so well.
                     When fortie daies were come,
                     to heauen ascended hee,
                     In sight from men of Galilie,
                     in faith to vs that bee.
                     
                        From whence I doo beleeue,
                     he shall againe descend,
                     To iudge all flesh, and of the world
                     to make a finall end.
                     The dead from graue shall rise,
                     the quicke shall changed bee,
                     And eu'rie eie shall face to face
                     behold his Maiestie.
                     By grace who hath done well,
                     with him in heauen shall raigne:
                     By sinne who hath done wickedlie,
                     in euerlasting paine.

beginning, and without ending.
                  
                      O Thou sonne of God, which
art the word of the father, and

second person in Trinitie; I doo
likewise beleeue, confesse, and acknowledge
thee to be of the father,
without beginning, before all
worlds, neither made nor created,
but begotten, and art equall
with the father in power, might,
glorie, maiestie, and deitie, and to
be as thy father is, the fountaine
and well-spring of all wisedome,
grace, and mercie.
                  O Thou God the holie Ghost,
and third person in Trinitie,
which art with the father and the
sonne, the giuer of all comfort,
vertue and goodnesse; I doo also
beleeue, confesse, and acknowledge
thee, to be of the father and
of the sonne, neither made, nor
created, nor begotten, but from
God the father, and from God the
sonne proceeding, equall with the
father and the sonne, without beginning

of time, and without end,
in like power, might, glorie, maiestie,
and deitie as is the father and
the sonne, all three in one, and one
in three, one verie GOD euerlasting,
not three Gods euerlasting,
of one essence or being, euer perdurable
or during, without measure,
not changeable, almightie,
one substance, and in one nature
simple.
                  
                      I Doo beleeue, confesse, and acknowledge
ech one of your persons
to be equall to the other, in
all maner of perfection; and ech
one person to be omnipotent or
almightie, and to be one beginning
of all things; and that togither
you made & created all creatures,
visibles & inuisibles, spirituals
and corporals; and that, by almightie
vertue, from the beginning
of time, you three togither

did create (and that of nothing) the
creature angelike, and the worldlie
nature; and then you made
man common to the first two natures:
for man is of bodie corporall,
and of soule spirituall.
                  ALso I doo beleeue, confesse,
and acknowledge, that thou
the father art one other, and thou
the sonne art one other, and thou
the holie Ghost art one other. For
thou, ô father, maiest not be the
sonne, nor the holie Ghost; nor
thou, ô sonne, maiest not be the father,
nor the holie Ghost; nor thou
ô holie Ghost, maiest not be the
father, nor the sonne: but to you
three persons is one being, and
one nature common, the which is
the beginning of all things; and
out of this beginning there is no
beginning.
                  
                     
                      ANd I beleeue, confesse, and
acknowledge, that thou, ô
father, art no greater, nor of greater
power than is the sonne, nor
than is the holie Ghost. For the
vnitie of your diuine being is equall
or alike togither: for such as
thou art, ô father; such art thou, ô
sonne, and such art thou, ô holie
Ghost. And thus thou holie and
blessed Trinitie art one God, the
first beginning, without beginning,
fountaine of all mercie,
grace, goodnesse, and vertue, which
by thy knowledge dooest knowe
all things present, and to be hereafter.
                  
                      ANd further I doo confesse, acknowledge,
and stedfastlie
beleeue, that thou, ô sonne of God
art without beginning, coëternall
with GOD the father, and with
God the holie Ghost. And by the

whole consent of you three in one,
and one in three, and by the ouershadowing
of the holie Ghost,
thou, ô holie and most blessed
sonne of God, didst enter into the
wombe of the most vnspotted amongst
women, the blessed virgine
Marie, in whom was no blemish
of sinne after the salutation
of the angell Gabriel, when she
had by the working of the holie
Ghost, answered these words of
meeknesse; Behold and see, I am
the handmaid of the Lord, be it
vnto me according to thy word.
                  THus thou blessed sonne of 
God diddest not forsake or
leaue thy Godhead, but didst take
flesh or manhead of the blessed
virgine vnto thy Godhead, being
still perfect God with the father
in Godhead, and perfect man also.
In which manhead thou wert

lesse than the father, but yet equall
with the father touching thy deitie
or Godhead: as after thy most
blessed natiuitie thou didst prooue
in thy humanitie to bee perfect
God.
                  
                      FOR without anie teacher or
schoolemaister, thou hadst all
perfect knowledge of sciences &
learning. Thou changedst water
into wine. Thou gauest sight to
the man borne blind. Thou openlie
saidst to the Iewes and Pharisies;
I which speake to you, am the
beginning. Thou feddest manie
thousands of people with a few
loaues of bread, and with a few fishes.
The wind and sea obeied at
thy commandement. Thou raisedst
Lazarus from death vnto
life, which was foure daies dead,
and stinking in his graue. In this,
ô God, and in manie more excellent

miracles, thou didst shew thy
selfe to be perfect God.
                  ANd also thou didst shew thy 
selfe to be perfect man: for
thou didst eate, drinke, and sleepe,
and so tookest increase of nature,
as man dooth. Thou weptst, thou
fastedst, thou sufferedst all the miseries
of man, sin onelie excepted.
                  IT also well pleased thee to fulfill,
to performe, and to accomplish
all the words and saiengs of
the holie patriarchs and prophets,
which they had vttered and spoken
of thee, long time before thou
tookest our humane nature vpon
thee. And so to fulfill the prophesies,
thou sufferedst that thine humane
nature should be betraied
and taken, by the kissing of thine
vnkind disciple Iudas.
                  
                     
                      THou also suffredst cruell persecutions
of the Iewes, & after
maine punishments they blasphemed
thee, and cried vpon Pilate
to haue thee crucified; and so
vnder Ponce Pilate thou didst suffer
to be crucified, and vpon the
crosse didst die, touching thy humanitie;
and after wast thou taken
downe, buried, and by the power
and might of thy deitie descendedst
into hell, according to
the scripture.
                  
                      ANd I beleeue (notwithstanding
that thy sepulchre was
made fast and sealed, & also watched
and kept by certeine soldiers
therevnto appointed) that the
third daie, by thy Godhead or diuine
power, thou didst arise in thy
humanitie. And fortie daies after
thou didst ascend into heauen, in
the sight of men of Galile, and in

faith vnto vs that be; where thou
doost remaine perfect GOD and
perfect man, sitting on the right
hand of the father, from whence
thou shalt come and iudge both
the liuing and the dead. By the
dead I vnderstand the bodie which
is mortall, and by the liuing I vnderstand
the soule which is spirituall
and immortall.
                  ANd also I acknowledge, confesse,
and stedfastlie beleeue,
that I shall, among all thy reasonable
creatures, arise from death to
life, and with them shall stand and
behold thy diuine maiestie face to
face; thou sitting in the throne of
thine eternall iudgement. And
thine elect, and those whom thou
hast shewed mercie vpon, shall be
seuered from the wicked reprobates,
as lambes from woolues;
the saued sort vpon thy right hand,

and the other vpon thy left, where
we shall all receiue our last and finall
iudgement. The which iudgment,
ô Lord, I doo most humblie
beseech thee may be vnto me, not
after my sinnes and wickednesse;
but according vnto thy great and
vnspeakable mercies.
                  Grant this, ô thou most holie
and blessed father of heauen, which
art with the sonne, and with the
holie Ghost, the worlds creator;
and haue mercie vpon me, haue
mercie vpon me.
                  Grant this, ô thou most holie
and blessed Iesu, the onelie sonne
of God, the worlds Sauiour and
redeemer; and haue mercie vpon
me, haue mercie vpon me.
                  Grant this, ô thou most blessed
and holie Ghost, which art togither
with the father & the sonne,
the worlds comforter; and haue
mercie vpon me, haue mercie vpon

me.
                  Grant this, ô thou most holie,
most blessed, most glorious and euerlasting
Trinitie; and haue mercie
vpon me, haue mercie vpon
me, haue mercie vpon
me, Amen.
                  
               
               
                  A praier for the Queenes
most excellent Maiestie.
                  
                     O Almightie and
mercifull GOD,
creator & gouernour
of all things,
whose strength is
euerie where, and
whose power is infinite; which as
thou euer art omnipotent, and in

all thy works most gratious and
ouer maruellous; so vnto vs thy
poore seruants, grant we humblie
beseech thee, that ELIZABETH
our gratious QVEENE, and next
vnder thee here on earth our gouernour,
may long liue, and lead a
healthfull, quiet, and peaceable
life. And if, ô Lord, at anie time the
wicked, through malice shall conspire
and gather themselues togither
against thee, and hir thine
annointed; wee hartilie beseech
thee, either with speed to conuert
and turne their harts, or ouerthrowe
their force, and bring their
deuises to naught. And although,
ô Lord, that we, through our manifold
sinnes and wickednesse, doo
not deserue to haue so good and so
excellent a Iewell to rule & reigne
ouer vs; yet, good Lord, we hartilie
praie thy diuine maiestie, to
behold the great and vnspeakable

miseries, which the losse of so
pretious a Pearle may bring vpon
vs and our posteritie, and to auert
the same. This, ô Lord, we doo
humblie craue of thee, that wee
may long time enioie hir; or else
that we, who faithfullie doo loue
hir, may with hir be dissolued,
according to thy good
will and gratious
pleasure, Amen.
                  
               
               
                  
                  A praier to be said of euerie
true Christian before the
receiuing of the holie
Communion.
                  
                     O Most sweet louer of
al mankind, Lord &
Sauior Iesu, I humblie
beseech thee
for thy bitter passion
sake to remoue from me pride,
enuie, and detraction, yea wrath,
malice and impatiencie, and all
other sicknesses & diseases of the
soule. And plant, good Lord, in my
hart and mind true meekenesse,
charitie, patience, chastitie, temperance,
and modestie, with all
such other vertues, medicines, and

preseruatiues vnto the soule. And
mortisie in me, good Lord, all vncleane
motions, carnall desires,
and inordinate affections: and reuiue
in me the loue of vertues, and
the perpetuall exercises thereof;
so that in this time and all times I
may woorthilie receiue this holie
and blessed sacrament, vnto thine
honour and glorie, and my soules
endlesse ioie and comfort.
                  O Lord, I knowe and doo confesse
here before thy diuine maiestie,
that I am vnwoorthie, and verie
much vnwoorthie, & most vnwoorthie,
through my manifold
sinnes and wickednes to licke the
crums that fall from thy table: but
notwithstanding I knowe as well
againe, and so doo I in hart and
mind stedfastlie beleeue, and the
same doo acknowledge in mouth
and word, that thou my Lord God
art omnipotent and almightie,

and so maiest by thy power infinite,
if it so please thy maiestie to
make me woorthie and acceptable
to sit at thy table, and there to
taste and feed of the most pure
and heauenlie viands: for thou
alone, ô Lord, maiest and canst iustifie
a sinner, and of a vile, foule,
and filthie wretch, make a cleane,
white, and pleasant person.
                  Therefore gratious Lord, I beseech
thy woorthie maiestie for thy
almightie power, which I firmelie
and stedfastlie beleeue; and for
thine infinite and endlesse wisedome,
which I boldlie confesse;
and for thine excellent goodnesse
and truth, wherein I fullie hope
and trust; and for all this togither
as one: frame me and make me
woorthie and acceptable vnto thy
godlie presence, and grant me forgiuenesse
of all my sinnes, and the
feruent flame of thy loue, that I

may now at this time receiue this
holie sacrament with puritie of
hart, and cleanesse of conscience,
with spirituall gladnesse and heauenlie
ioie.
                  O most mercifull Sauiour Iesu,
I humblie beseech thee, for this holie
mysterie of thy blessed bodie
and bloud, wherewith we vnwoorthie
wretches be continuallie fed,
and dailie washed, clensed, sanctified,
and made holie, and so partakers
of thy most high diuinitie:
grant me, Lord, and giue me the
pretious garment of innocencie,
with such furniture of other ornaments
thervnto according, as best
may please thy gratious goodnes,
wherewith I may (as in my wedding
vesture) in a good and cleane
conscience approch vnto thy presence;
so that this celestiall & heauenlie
sacrament receiued, may
be vnto me health and saluation

of soule and bodie, vnto life euerlasting,
Amen.
                  
               
               
                  A praier to be said of euerie
true Christian after the
receiuing of the holie
Communion.
                  
                     IN most humble, most
lowlie, and most hartie
maner, with most
due reuerence I thank
thee, good Lord, most holie father,
and euerlasting God, that by the
bountie of thy mercifull grace
wouldest vouchsafe thus to refresh
and feed my soule through
faith with the benefits of the death
and passion of thy sonne our Lord
God, and Sauior Iesu Christ. And
I beseech thine infinite goodnesse,
that this the sacrament of thy deth
and passion, which I most vnwoorthie
wretch haue now receiued,

come neuer hereafter in iudgement
& condemnation vnto me
for mine euilles, merits, and deseruings;
but rather, good Lord,
it may come vnto the profit and
comfort of my bodie, and vnto
the saluation of my soule vnto the
life euerlasting, Amen.
                  
               
               
                  A godlie praier to be said
before the preaching
of the word.
                  
                     NEither is hee that
planteth, neither he
that watereth anie
thing at al, but thou
ô Lord, that giuest
the increase. Increase we beseech
thee the seed of thy word, and
cause it to fructisie an hundred
fold. Open our eies, that we may
see the woonderfull things conteined
in thy lawe. Incline our harts

to thy testimonies, and not vnto
vanities. Euermore bee on our
right hand, and perfect the worke
that thou hast begun among vs.
Beare our most gratious ELIZABETH
in thine owne bosome,
and set thine eies alwaies vpon
hir for good: let the spirit of knowledge
and holines remaine in hir
ministers; blesse hir Councellers
with wisedome and discretion; hir
Nobles with fortitude and courage;
hir Iudges with iustice and
mercie; hir Magistrates with diligence
and faithfulnes; hir People
with feare and perfect obedience,
that we may all with one mind
and one mouth saie with the prophet;
He that is mightie hath
doon for vs great things,
and holie is his
name, Amen.
                  
               
               
                  
                  A praier necessarie to bee
said at all times.
                  
                     O Bountifull IESV, ô
sweet sauior, ô Christ
the Sonne of GOD,
haue pitie vpon mee,
mercifullie heare mee, and despise
not my praiers. Thou hast created
me of nothing: thou hast redeemed
me from the bondage of sin,
death, and hell, neither with gold
nor siluer, but with thy most pretious
bodie once offered vpon the
crosse, and thine owne bloud shed
once for all, for my ransome: therfore
cast mee not awaie, whome
thou by thy great wisedome hast
made; despise me not, whom thou
hast redeemed with such a pretious
treasure: nor let my wickednesse
destroie that which thy goodnesse
hath builded. Now whilest I
liue, ô Iesu, haue mercie on mee:

for if I die out of thy fauour, it will
be too late afterward to call for thy
mercie. Whilest I haue time to repent,
looke vpon me with thy mercifull
eies, as thou didst vouchsafe
to looke vpon Peter thine Apostle,
that I may bewaile my sinfull
life, obteine thy fauour, and die
therin. I reknowledge, that if thou
shouldest deale with mee according
to verie iustice, I haue deserued
euerlasting death. Therefore I
appeale to thy high throne of mercie,
trusting to obteine Gods fauour,
not for my merits, but for thy
merits, ô Iesu, who hast giuen thy
selfe an acceptable sacrifice to thy
father, to appease his wrath, and to
bring all sinners (truelie repenting
and amending their euill life) into
his fauour againe. Accept mee, ô
Lord, among the number of them
that shall bee saued. Forgiue mee
my sinnes, giue me grace to lead a

godlie and innocent life, grant me
thy heauenlie wisedome, inspire
my hart with 
                        •
                     aith, hope, and charitie;
giue me grace to be humble
in prosperitie, patient in aduersitie,
obedient to my rulers, faithfull
vnto them that trus
                        •••••
                     , dealing
truelie with all men, to liue chastlie
in wedlocke, to abhorre adulterie,
fornication, and all vncleannes:
to doo good after my power
vnto all men, to hurt no man, that
thy name may be glorified in mee
during this present life, and that I
afterward may obteine euerlasting
life, through thy mercie,
and the merits of
thy passion, Amen.
