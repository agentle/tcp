               THe Quenes Maiestie perceiueth that notwithstandyng her commaundement lately publyshed for the ceassyng of certaine vayne and vntrue reportes touchyng a decrye of monyes, yet the same continue styll, appoyntyng the same to be done from one market day to another, wherof arryseth great trouble amongste the people, and increase of the prices of all maner thynges both forrayne and naturall, and speciallye of grayne and other victuell: and for that her Maiestie thinketh that aswell some simple people of doubtfulnesse and without euyll meanyng do geue occasion to the continuaunce of the sayde rumours, as the greedy and cursed sorte do to make an vnordinate gayne of their wares, grayne, bestiall, and other victuell, thinkyng nothyng enough for their vnsatiable and mercifull greedines. For remedy thereof both to content the one, and to refourme the other, her Maiestie doth
