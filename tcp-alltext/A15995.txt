               THe Prophets / as they
were al taught / steredvp / and
thrusted forth of one
spirit to preche and wryte
the worde of the Lorde: so
folowd they al one threde
and lyne tending vnto one ende / euen our
sauiour Jesus Christe the parfait some &
ful conclusion of al the lawe & Prophets.
So that whoso in reding the lawe & Prophets /

with grete frute / he recheth & resteth graciously
vpon the same marke that al the
Prophets did shote at / euē vpon him that

Vpon this gloriouse and sauing signe to
be agayn said (as Simcon tolde Mary ye
virgen his mother Luke ii.) the two testamentis
also loked with cōtrarye aspectis / 
the olde beholding him to come / ye new

those two sufficient witnesses Moses &
Helyas / the one representing the lawe and
the tother the Prophetis / when Cryste
transfigured himself / bothe concluding &
consenting with Cryst / in that they talked
togither wt him expressing his ende whiche

For whom els aftir that gloriouse sight
and cōmunication did his disciples there
se but onely Jesus left alone? What so euer
therfore Cryste did / or suffred / as touchīg
the benefit & forme of our redempcion / the
lawe and Prophetis tolde it al before. So
that the talking togither of Moses & Helias
with Cryste declared the lawe & Prophets
to consent & agree bothe vpō Cryste

in him. Whiche thinge to confirme / the
voice of the father was there herde out of
the cloude sayng. This is my dere beloued
sone / for whose sake I am peased & set

at one with man: him therfore / se that ye
hear. Obserue diligētly (good Cristen reder)
the vehemēce & pieth of this pronowne
Ipsum / when the father cōmanded vs
sainge: Ipsum audite: him se yt ye hear.

            Cryste therfore to shewe himselfe that lyuely
fountayn of perpetual waters plentuously
springingforth into lyfe euerlastinge
vnto al that drinke / that is to saye / beleue
in him / sate him downe once ful
wery to reste himselfe vpon the wel bring
whiche Jacob longe before had digged:
euermore seking an occasion to insinuate

and offer himselfe a sufficient refrigery &
sauiour for synners / what tyme he opened
himselfe vnto that sinful Samaritane
womā telling hir: that who so drinke of
the water which I shal geue him / he shal
neuermore thirste &c. That is / who so beleue
in Cryste / shal neuer desyer any other
mean / sauiour / counforter & refressher: but
shal fynde & fele God the father one alone
for al sufficient through the grace and
merits of his sone our sauiour Criste: In
him onely to glory & reioyse as this Prophete
cōmandeth vs.Jere. ix. Whiche glory who
so once taste & fele / he wil not onely geue
it to no nother as in Isaie is shewed:Isa. 41. but
he will trēble and quake to hear this greuouse
complaint and heuy manasshing of
God almighty by the mouthe of Jeremy
saying:Jere. ii. My peple haue caste me awaye

Fle frō oute of ye middes of Babylon & let
euery man saue himself / let noman dissemble
nor holde his tongue at hir wikednes.
For verely Babylon whiche is Rome is
as wyked & sinful as it is reported & descrybed / 
as al her vngodly lyuing & deceaitful
dedis openly testifye & declare her.
            But to speke of the iestis and prease of
Jeremye / ye shal knowe that these his sermons
declare of how highe a spirit & feruent
faithe he was: but his chaunce (as
be the chaunces of all trwe prechers before
the worlde) was moste miserable and
hard / as one of those that preched the worde
of the Lorde God bothe prudently & cō
               stantly
vnto his dethe / nothing abasshed
at the threateningis of the vngodly kinges
and preistis that raigned in his later
dayes. Whiche constancy / moste cōmendable
in any precher coude not come but of a
perfait and ferme faithe in God. Whiche
faith being present / a non the herte of the
precher is endwed and strengthened with
all vertwe & goodnes.
                  
                     •
                  ebr. 11. For faith wil haue
ye victory and ouercome al perels. But yet
was his lyffe troublouse / for that the plages / 

burdens / and that miserable captiuite / 
whiche hte Prophetis all threatened
before to come / it was his chaunce to se
them / and to be partaker of the perellouse
payns / & heuye destruccion whiche he also
prophecyed vnto them himselfe / and not
onely suffred this greuouse temptacion / butJere. 4

was also violently caried captiue of
his enymes into Egypte / aftir that Juda
and Jerusalem were all destroyde & caried
captiues into Babylon / yet was his doctrine
& sermons all this troublouse tyme
both godly / louing / faithful and prudēt / For
he exhorted them swetely and louingly / he
rebuked sharply and ernestly / & preched
euermore as faithfully & constantly.
So that if we beholde his faithfullnes / he
is feruēt. If we consyder his erudicion
and doctrine / he shyneth. If we loke vpon
his prudence / it is right sauourye & well
ceasoned. If we beholde his godlynes / he
excedeth. And as for his constancye / it is
inuincible & beareth a waye al ye victory.
            With howe depe sighis sorowed he the
bakfallinge of the peple frome their God?
What lamentacions made he for that he
had so longe with so grete perel preched to
them al in vayne / & also for the captiuite
of the peple & miserable destruccion of Jerusalem?

what goodly comparisons & sensible
similitudes brought he in / when he
preched to perswade & call the peple to repentance?
As when he preched the destruccion
of the cyte in Tophet / where to laye ye
thinge more manifest and present at their
eyes / he smote the two erthen pitsherdis to

gither breking them al to pieses before
his audience / saing. Thus saith ye Lorde
of powers. Euen thus shal I alto breake
and destroye this peple and cite lyke as a
potter breketh a vessel whiche maye neuer
more be restored. This did he to fere and to
moue them to repentāce. For that oratour
and precher perswadeth moste vehemētly
whiche helpeth his oracion wt conuenient
iestures / apte similitudes & moste present
affectis. So that in the Prophetis sermōs
there is no siche hardnes & difficultye as
some men complayneth of / except ye sloughisshe
& sleapye reder nothinge excercysing
himselfe in readinge diligently & reuerently
the holy scriptures bringe it with
him / and so himselfe be the very cause why
he bringeth awaye so lytel frute in reding
them. The Prophetis be the expowners
& declarers of the lawe & not ye obscurers
and derkeners there of:Pet. 1. they be as Peter
saithe the light set vp in a derke place vnto

whiche he exhorteth vs diligently to

in hande to declare & proue / they neuer
leue it vntyl they haue so often / so many
wayes and wt so many sensible similitudes
& apte cōparisons set it forthe yt euery

            Jolias / the laste good kinge of Juda / raigned
.xxxi. yere. He had these .iii. wiked
sones / Joachas / Joakim / and Zedechias.
The story beginneth the .xxii. chapiter of
the fowerth boke of the kinges and cōtinweth
vnto the ende of the boke. Jeremy
begane to preche in the .xiii yere of Josias / 
so continewing vnder him .xviii. yere.
Aftir Josias / raigned Joachas / & that
but .iii. moneths / and then was he led captiue
into Egypt. Then raigned his brother
Joakim .xi. yere / and then was led captiue
vnto Babylon. Aftir him raigned
this Joakims sone called Joachin or Jeconias

.iii. moneths and .x. dayes / and was
led also captiue vnto Babylon. Then last
of al was Zedechias the thirde sone of Josias

Well (sayd the lorde to me) thou seist right

               THen was the worde of the lorde shewed
vnto me / cōmanding me thus.
Go and krye into the eares of Jerusalem / sayng.
Thus saith the lorde. I cannot forget
the / especially when I remembre my

mercifull couenāt with the / and agen the
goodnes of thy yougthe. I cannot forget
thy true loue in mariage / wherby thou folowed s
                     •
                  me
thorow the deserte / a londe vnlaboured
& vnsowne. Thou waste once an
holy Israel before the lorde / euē the firste
frutes of hys felde: so that whoso had denoured
the they had displeased him: & mischefe
shuld haue fallen vpō thē / sayd the
lorde. Hear ye therfore the worde of the lorde / 
bothe yow that be of the house of Jacob
and all the familye of the house of Israel.
Thus saith the lorde vnto you: What faute
or fraude fownd your fathers in me / to
go so farre backe frome / and to be made so
vayne as to folowe lyes? nether yet once
to thinke / where haue we lefte the lorde / that
led vs owt of the lande of Egypt / that
brought vs thorow that desert / thorou a
wylde lande harbourles / a terrible baron
lande where we sawe but dethe / thorow a
lande which no man passed by / and in the
which noman dwelled. And when I had
brought you vnto that fatte lande of Carmelus
to take your plesure of hir frutes
& commodites: you went your wayes and
defyled my lande / & made myne heretage
abominable. And euen the priestis / they do
not once remembre me sayng: where is the

lorde? The lerned in the lawe / they know
me not. And as for the pastours / they synne
agenst me. The prophetes they preache
al for Baal his profit / and ar gone aftir
ydols wich cannot helpe them. Wherfore
I am vtterly constrayned to cōtende in
iugemēt bothe with you & your childerne
saith the lorde. For go your wayes vnto
the eylandis of Cethim / & beholde: sende

                  e their
goddis? albeit in very dede / they be no goddis.
But my peple hath castawaye their
glory for an Idole that cānot help thē. For
this thinge therfore: Oh heauens / be ye
astouned / be ye a frayd and meruellously
amased saith the lorde. For two grete offences
hath my peple cōmitted. They haue
forsakē me / euen the very lyuely fountayne
of perpetual waters: and digged
them vp pittis al to troden & brokē which
may holde no waters. Is Israel a bōde slaue / 
or rather the good mānis sonne of the
house? And wherfore thē is he gon into a
proie? Wherfore rore they vpō him like lyons?
They haue brought their lande into
a wildernes: Their cites ar so thron downe
& brent / that no man may inhabit thē.

For theffeminat childerne of Memphes &
Thanneos haue polluted the / euen vp vnto
thy nek. Hapened it not thus vnto the
for that thou forsokest the lorde thy god
euen then whan he wolde haue directed the

do in the waye to Egypte? To drīke trowbled
waters? Or what makest thou in the
waye to Assyrye? to drinke the waters of
the floude? Thy nowne malice shal reproue
the: and thy nowne bakslydinge from
God shal condemne the: that thou maist
know and vnderstande how perniciouse &
perelouse a thinge it is that thou hast forsaken
the lorde thy God / dreding him nothing
at al saith the lorde God of powrs:
when euen from the beginning I broke of
thy yoke and thy bondes / for that thou
complaynedst and praydst me to make an
ende of thy bondage. But for al this / yet

abused vpon euery highe hil and vnder

But thou hast playd the harlet with many

Be conuerted thou bakslyder

into Zion. And I shal geue you herdemen
aftir my nowne minde which shal fede
you with doctryne and wysedome. And
whan you shall be encreased and multiplyed

the arke of the lordis couenaūt shal no more
be spokē of nor mynded / no menciō more
shalbe made therof: for it shal no more

be visited nor honourd with oblaciō. Thē
shal they cal Jerusalem the seat of the lorde / &
al the gētiles shalbe gathered vnto
it for the name of the lorde which shalbe
geuen to Jerusalem. Nether shal they folow

to fall backe frome to any other godds.
But as the womā breketh hir promyse to

Lorde. Wherfore the noyse of the childern
of Israel shalbe herde al aboute wailing

is let slippe and cometh forthe of

And I sayd: Ah lorde god / haste thou

house of Israel and Juda hath caste me
awaye vnfaithfully / saith the Lorde / sayng:
It is not he that is God. Nether shal
there come siche afflicciō vpō vs. Swerde
and honger we shal not se. Wherfore these
Prophetis shal go their wayes into the
wynde. And he that shulde preache shall
not come amonge them. Euen thus shal it
be dealt with thē. Wherfore thus speketh
the lorde god of powrs. Sith ye speake
this worde: Lo I shal turne my wordes
whiche thou speakest with thy mouth into
fyer / and this peple into wode / that it
maye deuoure them. Beholde I shal bringe
vpon you a nacion from a farre (o house
of Israel saith the lorde) a stronge boystiouse
nacion an olde nacion whose tongue
thou shalt not knowe nor vnderstāde
what they saye. Their quyuers shalbe
thy present graue: for al they ar ful mightye.
This naciō shal eatup thy corne & foode:
they shal eat thy sonnes and daughters:
they shal deuoure thy flockes & droues.
They shal eatup thy vyneyardis &
figges. And bete downe thy defensed cytes
with swerde in whō thou trustedst moste
cheifly: and yet thus than wil I not ceasse
nor make an ende with you saith the
lorde. And whan they shal saye: wherfore

shal our lorde God do al this vnto vs?
               Thou shalt answer thē. Because that lyke
as ye haue forsakē me and serued strā
                  ge
gods in your owne lande: euen so shal
ye serue strange gods stil in a strāge lande.
Shewe this to the house of Jacob / and
preche it in Juda sayng: Hear (I pray the)
this thing thou folesshe and hertlesse peple.
ye haue eyes but yese not / and ears
but ye heare not. Wil ye not dread me
saith the lorde? Wil ye not feare my face / 
which haue pinnedyn the sea with sandes:
ye & that with this lawe to / that she
shal neuer passe ouer them? She maketh
a face with grete vehemence / but yet she
maye not: She swelleth vp into her highe
waues / but yet she breaketh not her lawe.
But this peple hath a faithles & rebellious
herte. They are fallen backe and
gone their wayes so farre / that they thinke
not once in their hertes. Let vs yet feare
the lorde our God whiche geueth vs
rayne in tyme / and ceasonable showers
for our profit / preseruing vs our corne
according to the duwe order of the year.
your own wikednesses haue turned these
thinges from you. And your synnes haue
depryued you this grete commodite.
For in my peple ther ar fownde the vngodly

which bende snares preuely / & waite
to destroye men and to take them. And
as the nette is ful of birdes / so ar their
houses ful of goodis gotē with dissaight.
And hereof ryse their stoutenes & riches:
hereof ar they magnifyed / made so fatte
and ful of tresure. Also they haue offended
me with the moste greuous crymes.
They ministre not the lawe. The cause of
the fatherlesse they expede it not. The pore
mannis wronge / in iugement they delyuer
not. Shal I not be auenged of these
thingis saith the lorde? And shulde I not
take veneaunce of what so euer lyke vnto
this? Thingis to be woundred at and
gretely to be fered ar nowe done in this
lande. The Prophetis preche lyes / and
the Preistis obaye and reioyse in them.
And my peple haue grete plesure in these
thinges. But what shal come of this at
the laste? Verely / euen this.

This is the cyte that muste be

vexacion. As the cesterne kepeth & encreseth
hir colde waters / euen so nouresheth
this cyte hir malice. Thefte and iniury
ar harde in hir. Sorowe & woundes
ar euer in my sight. Be thou rather nourtred

thus saith the Lorde of powers. The reā

I speke and testifie myselfe that he wolde

that they may not receyue my worde.
For lo / the worde of the lorde is put of
them in the place of obprobrye and shame / 
they set naught by it but reuyle it.
               But Lorde I am so repleynesshed and laden
with thy fury that I labour in great
sufferaunce. Haue done at once therfore
and power it forthe vpon the childerne in
the stretis and also vpon the companye of
the yongemen. For the man with his wyfe / 
and tholdemā withe the bederede shalbe
taken / and their houses shalbe translated

lorde: because that from the leest of them
vnto the gretest euery man is geuen to couetousnes / 
and frome Prophete to preist
euery one doeth dissaightfully and lyingly.
But yet in the meā ceason / to put my

their breache and destrucciō with this lye / 
preaching peace peace / whā ther is no peace
at al. Wherfore / they shalbe ashamed
because they haue cōmitted abominaciō:
what sayd I? Ashamed? When they ar paste

al shame & withe oute al feare. Wherfore
they shal fall amonge the slayne / &
in tharticle of my visitaciō they shal come

saith the Lorde. Comeforth vnto the ways.
Consyder and serchout the pathe euerlasting:
that yet if this waye be good and
right / ye mought walke theryn & fynde
reste for yoursouls. But they saye / we wil
not walke theryn. yet sayd the Lorde. And
I shal set ouerseers ouer you: Gyue hede
therfore / especially vnto the voyce of the
trompet. But they saye / we wilnot geue
hede. Wherfore / hear ye gentyles / and se
ye folke gathrede togither what I haue
ordined for them. And thou erthe hear also / 
I shal bringe a greuouse plage vpon
this peple / euen the frute of their owne
counsels. For they obayed not my wordis
nor my lawe / but aborred them and casted
them awaye. For what entent bringe ye
encense fro Gaba? and this good fragrā
                  te

displease me / and your sacrifices
delight me nothing at al. Wherfore thus
saith the Lorde. Beholde I shal sende a

togither one with another shal perisshe.

Also thus saith the lorde. Beholde a
populose multitude shal come frō the northe
partes / and a grete nacion shalbe steredup
from the coostis of therthe armed
with bowe and bokeler / a naciō bothe boystuouse

of our enymes shal occupye al places.
               Girde the therfore with sak / oh daughter

take the to moorning as it were for
thy onely dere beloued sonne / & lamēte as

for in the twīkling of an eye / this destroyer
shalbe vpon you: whom I haue set vpō
my peple as a tryeroute of metal to trye
them & to disclose their wayes. For they
ar forsakers of me and traytours. They
honte aftyr filthy lucre / they ar brasse &

blower of the fyer with the belows shal
faynte / the leade shal fayle: the tryer oute
of the syluer shal trye in vayne / for they
ar worse then worthy to be melted. Wherfore
they shalbe called forboden and reproued

               THis is the worde geuen vnto Jeremye
from the Lorde sayng. Stande
vp in the gates of the house of the lorde / &
preache this sermone with a lowde voyce

the Lorde. Thus saith the Lorde of
powers the God of Israel. Amend your
wayes & coūsels / & I shal make you to inhabit
this place. Put not your confidence
in the wordes of lyers sayng. The temple
of the Lorde / the temple of the Lorde / 
the temple of the Lorde is here. For if ye
amende and redresse your ways & counsels / 
& do righte to euery man / if ye do no
wronge to the stranger / to the fatherlesse

blode in this place / if you folow not strā

gods into your owne destrucciō: I shal
cause you to inhabit this place in the lande

which I gaue your fathers from age to
age. But lo / ye truste in deceaitful counsel
& lyīg wordes which shal not profit you.
For whan ye haue walked altogither in
thefte / murder / adultery and periury: whā
ye haue offred to Baal and folowed strā
                  ge
gods / ye and euen vnknown gods / thē
at laste ye come and stande before me in

ye saye / we be absolued / ye although we
had committed al these abominacions.
               Think ye that this house which beareth
my name is made a denne of theues? And
these thinges ar not done preuely but opē
                  ly

Silo / to the which I gaue my name some

malice of my peple Israel. Now therfore
because ye haue committed al these dedis
saith the Lorde. Notwithstāding yet I rose
fulerly continually warninge you in
tyme / I spake but ye wolde not hear / I called

I gaue you and your fathers euen as
I did to Silo. And I shal caste you oute of

make no intercession to me. For in nowyse
wil I heare the. Seist thou not what they
do in the cites of Juda and without Jerusalem?
The childern gather stickes & their
fathers set them on fyer. And their wyues
strewe & sprinkle their flower to make
fyne cakes for the quene of heuē.The

                     one. Ouer
this yet they offred to false gods to angre
me / albeit ther is no siche affecte in me / saith
the lorde / ought they not yet rather
tobe a shamed of their owne selues? Wher
fore thus saith the lorde God. Beholde
my wrath & indignacion shalbe powerdforth
vpō this place / vpon mā and beast / vpon
the trees of the felde and vpon the
frutes of therthe: & it shal so brenne that
noman may quenche it. Thus saith the
lorde of powrs / the God of Israel / ye ioyne
& heap togither your brente sacrifices
with your slayne beastis to be offred / but
eat you the flesshe your selfe / for as for
me I spake nothing of these vnto your fathers:
how miche lesse thā was it my mynde / whan
I brought the oute of the lande
of Egypte to commande these ceremones

of brente sacrifyces and oblaciōs as my
chefe and firste precepts? But this was
the substance of my fyrste precepte.Ex de. x Hear
& obaye my voice / and I shalbe your god / and
ye shalbe my peple / this condiciō added / 
that ye walke in all my wayes whiche
I shal commande you for your helthe.
But they obayed not nether gaue eare / but
walked aftir the lustes and craftye
counsels of their owne shrewd hertis / and
became frowarde and nothing towarde / 
ye and that euen from the same daye that
your fathers wente oute of Egypte vnto
this daye. And I sente them my seruātis / al
the Prophetis rysinge & busely warninge
them in tyme / but they listened not
to me / nor yet once enclined their ears: but
hardened their prowde neckes and became
farre worse than their fathers. And thou
thyselfe now to / shalt also speke vnto thē
al these wordes: but they shalnot geue eare
vnto the: thou shalt cal them / but they
shal not answere. Wherfore thou shalt
saye vnto thē. This is the peple that hereth
not the voice of their lorde god / nether
receiueth his discipline. Faith is gone &
banesshed from their mouthes. Therfore
clipof the heares of thy heade & caste them
a waye / take the to moorning thoroute al

the londe. For the Lorde wilcaste awaye
and scater the generaciō with whom he is
angre. The Childern of Juda haue done
euil in my sight saith the Lorde. They haue
setvp their owne abominacions in my
house named aftir my name and so polluted
it. And they haue builded an auter
at Topheth which is the vale of Benhinnom
to brenne their sonnes and daughters
in the fyer / which thing I neuer commāded
nor mynded. Wherfore behold the
tyme shal come saith the lorde / whā it shal
nomore be called Tophet or vale Benhinnom:
but the vase of the slayne. For they
shalbe buryed in Tophet because they can
get no nother place: and the carkases of
this peple shalbe meat for fowles of the
ayer and for wylde beasts of the erthe / &
ther shalbe to nomā to chaar thē a waye.
I shal make a vacacion of the voyce of
gladnes and of the voyce of ioye / of the
voyce of brydegrome and brydewyfe frō
the cites of Juda / and the region of Jerusalem.
For the lande shalbe lefte desolate
with out inhabitours.

               AT this tyme saith the lorde: they shal

of Juda / and the bones of hir rulers / the
bones of Preistis and Prophetis and of
the cytesens of Jerusalem / oute of their sepulchres:
and shal laye them abrode before
the sone / mone and all the company
of the starres / whom they loued / whom
they serued / aftir whom they wente / whō
they sought and worshipte. They shalnot
be gatherdup nor buryed / but lye stil lyke

lefte of this wiked generacion shal desyer
rather to dye than to lyue. Whersoeuer
they shal become as I shal scater thē / 
they shalbe but (as ye wolde saye) a left
reamnant saith the lorde of powrs. Also
this shalt thou saye vnto them. That
thus saith the Lorde: Do men so fall that
they neuer aryse vp a gene? Are they so
auerted that they wil be neuer conuerted?
How is it than that this peple and Jerusalem
be auerted so steifly for euer?
               Their stourdines encreaseth / they wilnot
be conuerted. For I haue behelde them
and herkened / but there is not one that
once thinketh on this / not one repentith
him of his synnes sayng / what haue I
done? Or wherfore haue I done thus?
               Euery one aftir that he was once auerted /

runneth neaing into bataile. The storke
knoweth hir apoynted tyme / the turtle / the

know not the tyme of the vengeaunce of

saye. It is we that ar the wyse / it is we
that haue the lawe of the lorde? se therfor
they ar but very lyes which the false pē
                  ne

and be taken / for lo / they haue throne a

than can ther remayn in them? Wherfore
I shal geue their wyues to strāgers / and
their feldes to their destroyers: for

lyers. But in the mean ceason they heal
the breache & affliccion of my peple powdering
it with this lye sayng: There shal
be peace / there shalbe peace / whan ther
is none at all. Fygh for shame / they committe
abominable and shameful dedes &
ar past al shame. Wherfore they shall fall
among the dede carkases and shal come
downe togither in the daye of their visitacion
saith the lorde. I shal cause them to
be gathered vp and taken awaye saith the

Lorde. Lyke as ther is not a grape lefte
in the vyne / nor a figge on the figtre / and
as leaues ar fallen a waye / euen so shal
I cause them to be caryed awaye captiued
while they be at their wittes ende saing:
Come and let vs go into some stronge cytes / 
and let vs abyde there with sylence.
For our Lorde God hath put vs to sylence
and geuen vs to drynke water mengled
with gall because we synned agenst him.
We loked for peace / but there came no good:
we taryed and waited for the tyme of

Than shal the neaing and noyse of their
horse be herde from Dan. At the noyse of
their harnes and armed horse men al the

is in it / bothe cytes & dwellers in thē. And
ouer this yet shal I sende into among thē
kokatrices and serpents whom they may
not charme / and they shal stinge you saith
the lorde. I am oppressed with sorowe / and
heuynes holdeth my herte. For lo / the lowde
voice of the daughter which is my peple

Is not the Lorde in Zion? Is not hir
kinge in hir? Wherevnto the Lorde shal
answere. Wherfore haue they angred me

with their karuē images and strange vanites?
Haruest is paste. Somer is done / &
we ar yet miserable and vnhappye. I am
sory for thaffliccion of the daughter my

that they be thus brent vp / that noman
passe thorow them / that their is not herde
one worde of any possessour / and that
the byrdes of the ayer with the beasts
ar caryed and gone fro thence. And euen
very Jerusalem shal I bringe into an heape
of stones and dragons dēnes. And the
cytes of Juda shal I make desolate withoute
any inhabitour. What mortal man

is sowyse as to vnderstāde these thingis?
or to whom hath the lorde tolde forth these
by mouthe? sayng: Wherfor perisshest
o lande? wherfore art thou so brentvp and
made lyke a deserte / that nomā maye passe
thorow the? Euē the lorde therfore him
selfe tolde it them that forsoke his lawe
which he gaue them / and yet they receyued
it not / nor lyued aftir it: but folowed
the craftynes of their owne shrewed hartis
& went aftir goddes as their fathers
taught them. Wherfore euen thus (I tell
you) saith the Lorde of powers the God
of Israel. Beholde I shal fede this peple
with anxt / and geue them gall to drinke:
I shal scater them into amōg the naciōs / whom
nether they nor their fathers knowe.
I shal sende the swerde among them
persecuting vntil I haue consumed them.
Also thus sayd the Lorde of powers. Se
that ye call mourners and sende for the
wyse women to come spedely that they
might singe our moorninge songes / that
the teares might fall from our eyes / and
water our chekis. For the lamentable
voyce of Zion apereth yet stil / euen thus
to be harde. How ar we destroyd? How miserably
ar we cōfounded? we muste forsake
our owne contrye / for our owne tabernacles

cast vs forthe. But yet heare the
worde of the lorde / o ye women / & let your
eares hear the worde of his mouthe / that
ye might teache your daughters / & eche
of them their neghbours this lamentable
moorning. Deth is clymen yn at our windows
and hathe pearsed thorow our houses
destroying our childerne before our
dores and our younge ons in the streates.
But tel thou them / that thus saith the lorde.
Mennis carkases shal fall lyke donge
vpon the face of the felde / and lyke grasse
aftyr the sythe / nomā to gather them vp.
And tel thē that he saith thus to. Let not
the wyse glorye in his owne wysedome / nor
the grete mā in his power / nether the
ryche in his riches. But he that will glorye / 
let him glory in this / that he hathe
vnderstanding & knowleg of me / me. For
it is I that am the Lorde / which do mercy / equyte
and rightuousnes vpon therthe.
Wherfore in these thīgis I delight chefely
saith the Lorde. Beholde the tyme shal
come saith the Lorde / that I wil viset euery
circuncised nacion: as the Egypcion / the

               ¶The .x. Chapiter.
               HEre the sermone of the Lorde whiche
he sendeth vnto you oh house of
Israel / sayng thus. Be not lerned
aftir the wayes of the gentyles / nether
fear ye at the sygnes of the skye or heuen
whiche the gentyles feare. For the rytes
and lawes of the gentyles ar very vanite.
They wil go cut downe a tre frome the
wode and fasshion it withe the handis &
axe of the artificer / than is it made gaye
with golde or syluer / and fastened with
hamers and naylis that it moue not nor
go not a waye. It standeth as stiffe as the
palme tre / it speketh not / it gothe not / but
is borne onely. Be not a frayd of siche
thingis: for they may do nether good nor
harme. But vnto the (oh Lorde) none is
lyke / thou ar grete / and grete is the name
of thy power.
                     
                        〈…〉
                     . Who ought not to feare
the? Or what kinge among al nacions
ought not to obaye the? For amonge al
the wyse of the gentyles / and in al their
kingdomes / none is lyke the. They ar al
a lyke / vnlerned and vnwyse. All their

crafte and coning is but vanite. Syluer
is brought hither from Tharsis / and beten
forth into thinne plates. And golde
is brought from Ophir and beaten into
the worke of the crafte man by the hande
of the caster and cled with byse and purple.
Siche is the worke of al their wittye
men togither. But the Lorde is the very
God / the lyuing God and kinge euerlasting.
He being angrye the erthe trēbleth:
his indignacion no peple may beare. But
as touchinge these Idols thus shal ye reporte
by them. They ar goddes whiche
made nether heuen nor erthe. They shal
perisshe therfore as wel from therthe as
from these thingis which ar vnder this
skye. But as concerning this our God / ye
shal saye. He hath made the erthe by
hys power / & finesshed the rownde worlde
by his wysedome / and stretched forth
the heuens by his vnderstanding / at his
voyce miche water runneth togither in
the ayer / clowdes ar lyfted vp from the
extreme partes of therthe.Psal. cxxxv

                   He turneth
thonder into rayne / and ledeth forthe the
wyndes out of their secrete places. Euery
man is made a fole of his owne wisdome.
Euery man may be ashamed that

casteth an ymage. For it is but a vayne
thinge that he so melteth and bloweth togither / 
& clene withoute lyfe. These vayne
craftismen with their workis worthy
to be skorned so fondely framed and ornowernde / 
shal perisshe al to gither in the tyme
of their visitaciō. Siche is not Jacobs
lot / but it is he that hath fasshioned al thī
                  ges.
And Israel is the met rodde of his heretage / 
whose name is the lorde of powers.
Take away a non fro my sight thy
filthenes which yet sittest in so strōge holdes.
For thus saith the Lorde. Beholde I
shal castoute thinhabitours of this lande / 
al at this tyme / and so vexe them that
they nomore appere. Ah lasse / how greuouse
is my affliccion? how sorowful is my
plage? For I bear this heuines and rekē
it as my nowne. My tabernacle is destroied
and al my lynes broken in sondre. My
childerne ar gone fro me / and appere nomore.
Now is ther nomā to bende my tente / 
or rear vp my skinnes. For full folesshly
haue the herdemen done in that they
sought not the lorde: whervpon al their
flockes also haue done vnwysely & be scatred
awaye. Lo the rumour of the hoste is
present / and a grete vprore cometh frō the
northe to turne the cytes of Juda into a

wildernes and into dennes for dragons.
I know verely (Lorde) that it lyeth not in
mannis power to directe and rule his owne
wayes / nor yet to make perfite his owne
steapes and his goinge. Thou therfore
(Lorde) shalt amende vs in equyte / & not
in thy wrathe: leste thou bringe vs vnto
naught. Powr forth rather thy wrath
vpon the haithen that knowe the not / and
vpon the generacions that cal not vpon
thy name / and that namely for this cause / 
that they haue eatenvp / deuoured / and
cōsumed Jacob / & extincte his brightnes.

               HEar ye the wordis of this his couenaunt / 
and speke vnto al Juda & to

thou namely shalt saye vnto them. Thus
saith the Lorde God of Israel: Cursed be
euery man that obaye not the wordis of

and greuouse seruitute / sayng: Obaye

I swore to your fathers / to geue thē this
lande flowing with mylke & honey / as

I answerde sayng: Oh Lorde it is trwe.
And then ye Lorde sayd to me agen. Preache

                  e about Jerusalem / sayng: Hear the

thē oute of the lande of Egypte vnto this
daye warnīg thē intyme saīg. Lystē to my

folowed ye croked thoughtis of their owne

of this couenāt vpō thē which I gaue thē
to fulfill & they fulfilled it not. Ouer this
the lorde yet sayd to me. There is foūdoute
a cōiuraciō in all Juda & in the cytesens
of Jerusalem. They ar returned vnto the
synnes of their fore fathers whiche forsoke
to heare my wordis. And euē so do these
men folow strāge goddis to worship thē.
The house of Israel and Juda hath made
voyde my couenāt which I smit with their
fathers. Wherfore thus saith the Lorde.
Beholde I shal bringe forth a plage vpō

hear you. Thē shal the cytes of Juda with
the cytesens of Jerusalē go & crye vpō their
goddis whō they worshipt / but in no maner
wyse maye they helpe thē in tyme of
their miserable adfliccion. For loke how
many cytes / so many gods hadst thou oh
Juda / & acording to the nowmber of the
streatis of Jerusalem / thou settedst vp shameful
auters / auters vpon whom thou
brēst thy offeringis euē vnto Baal. Thou
therfore praye not for this peple / nether
bid prayse nor prayer for thē. For whan
thou shalt cry to me I shal not hear them
in their afflicciō. Wherfor (oh my best beloued
Israel) cōmittest thou in my house so
many synnes? as thoughe the holytheir beasts sacrificed & of fred vp is called holy flesshe. flesshe
might take awaye thy sinnes namely
which haste so roioysed in thy nowne my

but now / the cōtrary fame wyde spred / he
wil burne the in the fyer & destroye thy brā
                  ches.
For the lorde of powrs which plāted
ye hath ordined a plage for the (oh house of
Israel & house of Juda) for the euel that ye
haue done prouoking him to wrathe with
the worship done to Baal. These thinges
oh lorde (thou teaching me) I vnderstode / when
thou shewedst me their counsels: but

I lyke a meke lombe was apoynted to be
slayne / knowing nothing that they had
taken their counsel thus agenst me: saying
let vs corrupt his brede on the tree / &
so banysshe him from the company of the
lyuing that euen the very mencion of his
name might be odiouse and loothsome.
               Thou therfore / lorde of powrs / rightuouse
iuge sercher oute of raynes and hertis:
I beseche the that I might se vēgeāce taken
on them. For vnto the I committe my

spake the lorde vpon the cytesens of Anathot
which sought to make an ende of me / sayng:
Preache to vs nomore in the name
of the lorde / except thou wilt dye in our

powrs. Beholde / I shal viset you / your

and your sonnes and daughters shal dye
for honger / so that none be lefte. For I
shall bring a plage vpon the citesens of

               ALso thus saith the Lorde vnto me.
               Go and bye the a brode synen girdle:
and girde it aboute they raynes / but let
it not come in any water. Than I gote
me this girdle as the Lorde bad me and
put it aboute my raynes. Aftyr this / the
Lorde spake to me agene. Take the
girdle which thou haste bought the / and
put it aboute thy loynes / and ryse / and
go thy waye to Euphrates and hyde it
there in an hole of the rok. Then I wente
and hid it as the Lorde commanded me.

And it happened that longe aftir this / the
lorde sayd vnto me. Aryse and haste
the to Euphrates / and take oute thy girdle
which I cōmanded to be there hid. Thē
I wente forth to Euphrates / and digged
oute my girdle / and toke it awaye from
the place where I-hid it. And lo the girdle
was rotē / so that it wolde serue to no vse.
Then spake the Lorde to me these wordis.
Thus saith the lorde. Euē aftir this maner
fhal I destroye the pryde and gloriouse
fame of Juda and Jerusalem with swerde.
This peple is fulcursed & maliciouse.
They wilnot hear my wordis / they folow

                  ge
gods whom of they worshipt & fildowne
before them: wherfore they shalbe lyke
this girdle which is profitable for nothing.
For euen as the girdle cleueth to a
mannis raynes / so had I glued to me al
the house of Israel and all the house of Juda
saith the Lorde / to be my peple to haue
a grete name / to be honourable and cleare / but
they obeyed me not. Thou shalt tel
them therfore this ridel. Thus saith the
lorde God of Israel. Euery wyne potte is
filled with wyne. Here shal they anon
answer. Can we not know this / that euery
wyne pot maye be filled wyth wyne?

Than shalt thou tel them. Thus saith the
lorde. Beholde I shal fil al thinhabitours
of this lande and euē the kinges that sitte
in the seate of Dauid / Priestes & Prophetes
to / & al the citesens of Jerusalem
with dronkenes / and thruste them downe

nor spare / nor haue mercy / to thentente I
wolde destroye them. Obaye / geue eare / &
be not proude / for it is the Lorde that speketh.
Geue ye therfore glorye to your lorde
God before he withdrawe his light / and
ere your fete stomble in derkenes at
the hil. For than if ye loke for lyght he
shal turne it into deadly derkenes. And if
ye wilnot here this secrete monition / Or this prophecy my
herte shal wepe with yn me for your stobourne
pryde / I shal lamēt greuously / teares
shal drope down fro my eyes / for the
flocke of the Lorde shalbe led awaye captyue.

Al Juda shalbe led away captiue so that

I shal therfore disperse you lyke stubble

Ah Lorde God / beholde / the Prophetis

shalbe consumed with swerde and

shalt thou saye to them: I shal wepe daye
& night neuer ceasing because the daughter
of my peple shalbe destroyed with greuouse
adfliccion and made anende of with
so grete a plage. For go I forth into the
felde: lo / al shalbe kouerd with the slayne
with swerde: enter I into the cyte / I shal se
al storuen for honger. But bothe Prophetis

and for the tyme of cure / and lo ther

For we (Lorde) knolege our vngodlynes / and

answerde. If thou turnest ageyn I shal
restore the to my seruice. And whan thou
shalt deuyde the preciouse from the vyle / 
thou shalt be as my nowne mouthe. They

shalbe turned to the / but beware thou turnest
not awaye fro me vnto them. For I
shal set the agenste this peple lyke a stronge
brason wall. They shal fight therfore
agenst the / but they shal not winne the.
               For I wil be with the to saue and delyuer

and take the oute of cruel handis.
            
            
               ¶The .xvi. Chapiter.
               THe worde of the Lorde was geuē me
on this maner saing. Take no wyfe
nor bringeforth no chyldern in this place.
For thus saith the Lorde vpon the childerne
borne in this place & vpon the motherne
that bringe them forthe and fathers
that begete thē in this lande. They shal
dye a full bitter and paynful dethe. They
shal not be moorned for / nor buryed / but
lye still vpon donghillis on therte. They
shalbe consumed with swerde and hōger / 
& their carions shalbe meate for the fowles
of the ayer and beastis of the erthe.
Also thus spake the Lorde. Come not at
their comen festis or at their comen moorningis
and lamentacions. For I haue taken
awaye my peace from this peple saith
the Lorde / ye bothe my fauour & mercye.
And bothe olde and yonge shal dye in this

lande and not be buryd: ther shal noman
clippe or shaue his head for them. They
shal not viseteche other in tyme of moorning
to coūfort thē for ye dead / nother drinke
with eche other of ye cuppe of consolaciō
to take awaye the heuines for their father
and mother. Come not in their feste houses
to sitdown with them at meat and drinke.
For thus saith ye Lorde of powrs / ye God of
Israel. Lo I shal take frō this place (your
selues loking on & lyuing) ye voyce of ioy
& mirth / the voice of brydegrome & spouse.
Wherfore whan thou shalt shewe this peple
al these wordis / and they shal aske the
agene: wherfore hathe the Lorde decreed
all these grete mischeues to fall vpon vs?
or what is our wykednes and sin that we
committed agenst our Lorde God? Thou
shalt answer: Because your fathers haue
forsaken me (saith the Lorde) and folowed
strange gods whom they worshipt & fyll
downe before / forsaking me & keping not
my lawe. And you haue excedid thungodlynes
of your fathers in your owne sinnes:
For euery one of you folowe the deuellishe
thoughtis of his owne shrewd
herte & obayeth me nothing at all. Wherfore
I shal caste you oute of this lande into
a lande vnknowne both to you & your

fathers: & there shal ye serue strāge gods
daye and night: where I shal haue no cō
                  passion
vpon you. Wherfore / beholde / 
the dayes ar come saith the Lorde / that it
shal no more be sayd. The Lorde lyueth
that brought the chyldern of Israel oute
of the lande of Egypt: but it shalbe sayd / 
the Lorde lyuethe whiche hath brought
the chyldern of Israel oute of the northe
easte lande / and from euery region whother
I casted them forthe. For I shal bring
them agene vnto their owne lande which
I gaue their fathers. Beholde I shal sende
them many fysshers / saith the Lorde / 
which shal ketche them vp: and aftir that
I shal sende many honters to honte them
oute of euery mountayne and hill / and
also forthe of euery hole in the rockes.
For my eyes ar bente vpō all their wayes / 
and they cannot be hidde fro my face / 
nor their sinnes kouerd fro my sighte. ye
& that aftir I haue fully rewarded thē for
their iniquytes & sinnes wherwith they
haue defyled my lande / that is to saye / for
their abominable stinkīg Idols wherwith
they replenesshed my heretage. Oh Lorde
my strēgth / my might / & my refuge in tyme
of tribulacion / yet shal ye gētylis come
to ye from ye costes of ye erthe sayng. Suerly

our fathers cleued to lyes / ful vayne ar
Idols / and no profit is ther in them. For
shuld a man make him goddis of thē whō
it is impossible to be goddis? Wherfore / se
I shal teache them nowe agayn saith the
Lorde: & make my powr & strength known
vnto thē / so that they shal knowe that my
name isthe Lorde. Jehouah.

               YOur syn (o trybe of Juda) muste be

Wherfore I shal layeforthe al your

whō ye worshipt thorowt all your regiō.
And ye shal also be blotted oute of your
heretage which I gaue you. And I shal
caste you vnder the bondage of your enymes
in an vnknowne lande: for ye haue
put fyer vnto my furye whiche shal burne

Cursed be the man that trusteth in

gothe from the Lorde. For he shalbe lyke

the fearne that groweth in the deserte / 
neuer to se the goodnes to come / but shal

and shal flowresshe with grene leaues: &
whan the drowght shal dryvp and waste

nor ceasse from bringing forth hir frute.
               Of al thingis lyuinge / man hath the moste
disceaightful harte vnable to be serehed:
who then shal knowe it? euen I the
lorde bothe ensercher of herte & espyerout
of raynes to rewarde euery man aftir his

of his counsellis. He maketh him a neste / 
but hatcheth no eggis that gatherth goodis
wrongefully. In the middis of his lyfe
he muste leaue them / and laste of all be
fownde a fole. But thou Lorde / whole
seate is moste noblest / highest and aunciaunt:
which dwellest in the place of our
holy reste / thou arte the hope of Israel. All
that forsake the / ar confounded. All bakflyders
from the / ar writen in the erthe &

not in heuen. For they sorsake the Lorde / 
euen ye well of euerlasting waters. Heale
me Lorde / & I shalbe holl. Saue me Lorde / 
& I shalbe salfe: for thou arte my prayse.
For lo / these men saye vnto me. Where is
the worde of ye Lorde? let it comeforth (I
praye ye) Whiles I me selfe was now leading
the flok in thy pathes / I constrayned
noman violently / nor yet coueted I any
mannis dethe as thou wel knowest. But
my wordes were right in thy sight oh lorde.
Be not fearful vnto me / for thou arte
he in whō I hope whā any perelis present.
Let my persuers be confounded / & let not
me be confoūded. Let thē be afrayde & not
me be afrayde. Thou shalt bringe a troublouse
tyme vpō thē / & destroye thē with a
great destrucciō. Forthermore / thus sayd
the Lorde vnto me. Go & stāde in ye. gate of
ye peple / for whose cause ye kinges of Juda
come yn & oute / & in al ye gatis of Jerusalem / 
sayng vnto thē. Hear ye worde of the
Lorde ye kinges of Juda / with all Juda &
all the cytesens of Jerusalem which passe
thorow these gatis. Thus cōmandeth the
Lorde. Take hede to your selues leste ye
take vp your burdens in ye Sabbat daye / 
to bringe them in thorowe these gatis.
Nether karye ye oute of your houses any

burdēs in ye Sabbat daye. Nor do you any

cōmaunded your fathers albeit they obayed
me not nor gaue eare: but rather hardened
their stiffe neckes to thentent they
wolde not be reclaymed & receyue my disciplyne.
But you / if ye will hearme (saith
ye Lorde) & not carye in your burdens thorow
ye gatis of this cyte in ye Sabbat daye

               ¶The .xviii. Chapiter.
               THe sermon of the Lorde shewed vnto
Jeremye / saying: Aryse & go downe
into the potters house: that I myght there
certyfye the more of my mynde. And whā
I came vnto the potters house: I fownde
him making his worke vpō a whele. And
that vessel which he ofayned out of claye
broke vnder ye hādis of this potter: which
then (his mynde changed) made a nother
vessel therof as it semed him beste for his
purpose. And here thā the Lorde spake vnto
me. May not Jeuen as this potter / do
vnto you (o house of Israel) saith the Lorde?
Lo / ye be in my hande oh house of Israel / 
euen as the claye is in the hande of
the potter. Anon as I haue determined to
pluck vp by the rotes / to destroye & to cut
awaye any nacion or kingdom / and if yt
same nacion wil returne from their malice / 
vpon which I begane nowe to take my
counsel: by and by it repenteth me of ye plage
which I determyned to caste vpon thē.
And agen / and as I am purposed to buylde
and to plante any nacion or kingdom:
& the same folke wil do euyl in my sight / 
and not hear my voyce / by and by it repē
                  teth
me of that goodnes wherby I purposed
to edyfye and to encrese thē. Wherfore

(I praye the) tell all Juda and euery cytesen
of Jerusalem. Thus saith the Lorde.
Beholde I am deuysing a plage and will
conspire agenste you: Turne ye therfore
euery man from his owne euyl wayes / &
both do & thinke well. But here shal they
saye▪ Let these wordis passe / for as for
vs / we will walke aftir our owne mynde / 
and we wil euery man do aftir the luste of
our owne herte. Wherfore thus sayd the
Lorde. Enquyre (I praye ye) among the
gentyles if any man hath committed any
siche lyke abominacions as hath Israel ye
virgen done / and that so greuously. May
the snowe that lyeth melting vpon ye rockis
of Libanus fayle the feldis? Or the
vaynes of springes euē from the botome
be so takē awaye that they flowe nomore
forthe to water and to make plentuouse?
And yet my peple hath forgoten me: In somich
that they brenne & offer vnto vayne
Idols: & in folowing their owne wayes
ar: fwarued and wandred frō the lawful
comen waye: & ar gone a waye by an vntroden
priuate pathe. For the which thinge / 
they haue geuen vp their lande into a
perpetual desolaciō and outehissinge. So
that euery man passinge thorowe / may be
woundresly astonned / and shake his head.

I shal therfore scater them in the sight of
their enymes with a contrary skorching
este wynde. And whan their destruccion is
at hande / I shal turne my backe to them / 
and not my face. And than they sayde:
Come and let vs go and conspire agenste
Jeremye. We be the Priestis to whom the
lawe is committed that it perisshe not.
               And ye be the elders endewed with wysedome.
We be the Prophetes that neuer ar
withoute the worde of the Lorde. Let vs
(I saye) than go and kutoute his tonge / 
that we be nomore cōstrayned to hear his
sermons. Attende vnto me (Oh Lorde) and
heare the noyse of my aduersares. Is not
euil for good reqcquyted me while they
digge this pitte for me? Remember how. I
stode before the to speke the best for them / 
and to turne thy wrathe from thē. Nowe
therfore betake their chyldern into honger / 
and caste them agenste the violence
of swerde. Let their wyues be chyldelesse
and housbandlesse / their housbandis put
to dethe / and the yongemen slayne with
swerde in batayle. Let oute cryes aryse
frō their houses / theues breaking yn vpō
them vnwares: For they haue digged a
pitte to take me / and layed a preuey snare
for my fete. But thou knowst all their coū
                  sel

bente to slaye me. Be not therfore merciful
to their myschief / nether suffre thou
their sinnes to be puttoute of thy sight:
but let them fall gyltye conuicte before
the. These thingis shalt thou do to them
in tyme of thy furiouse indignacion.

               ALso thus sayd the Lorde to Jeremye.
Go and bye the an erthen pitsherde:
and bringe forth the elders of the peple
and of the Priestis into the vale ofTophet Gehena al one. Ben
hinnon which is withoute the gate where
al the potsherdis be scatered And preache
me there these sermons which I shal tell
the. Thus (I saye) thou shalt preache.
Hear the worde of the Lorde ye rulers of
Juda and cytesens of Jerusalem. These
thingis commaundeth the Lorde of powers
ye God of Israel. Beholde I shal bringe
a scourge and affliccion vpon this place:
which who soeuer heareth / a non his eares
shal glowe: and that euē because they
haue forsakē me / & defyled this place offering
their brente sacrifices vnto straunge
goddis: whō nother they theirselues / nor
their fathers knowe / nor yet the kinges of
Juda. And haue filled this place with the
blode of innocentis. For they bylte Baal

an auter to burne their childerne into asacrifice
for Baal. Which thinge as for me / 
I neuer cōmanded nor spake of / nor neuer
thought it. Wherfore / beholde / the tyme
shal come (saith the Lorde) that this place
be nomore called Thopheth or vale of Bē
                  hinnon / 
but the vale of slaughter. For I
shal slaye the senatours of Juda and Jerusalem
in this place and smyte thē downe
with swerde in the sight of their emnes
which seke their lyfe. And I shal geue their
cariōs meat to the foules of the aier & bestis
of the erthe. Also I shal make this cyte
desolate and hilled at: so that euery mā
that passeth by it / may be a stonned & hysse
vpon hir grete plage. And I shal cause
them to eate their owne chylders flesshe:
ye / and one shal eat a nother in the besege
& distresse wheryn their emnes with sich
as seke their lyues shal holde thē harde / 
and thou shalt al to breake this pitsherd
before these men which shalbe there present
with the / sayng vnto them. Thus
saith the Lorde of powers. Euē thus shal
I alto breake and destroy this peple & cyte / 
lyke as a potter breketh a vessel which
can neuer more be repayrede. And in Thopheth
shal they be buryed / because they
haue no nother place to burye them in.

Also thus shal I do to this place & to the
inhabitours therof saith the Lorde / for I
shal make the cyte lyke Thophet. For the
houses of Jerusalem / & the houses of the
kinges of Juda ar polluted euē as is this
place Thophet / because that all the houses
in whose parlers they burned incense
vnto al the companey of the starres & planetis
were pollated / & they with out any
stoppe offred vnto straunge goddis. Aftir
this / Jeremye came frō Thophet whither
the Lorde had sente him to prophecye and
preche: and stode in the fore courte of the
tēple sayng vnto al the peple. Thus saith
the Lorde of powers ye God of Israel. Beholde

               FOrthermore thus spake the Lorde. Go
thy wayes downe into ye kingis house
of Juda: & there speke this sermone saynge:

Heare the worde of the Lorde o kinge
of Juda which sittest in ye seat of Dauid.
Hear (I saye) both thou / thy seruāts & peple
whiche iette so prowdely thorow these
gatis. Thus cōmandeth the Lorde. Obserue
equite and rightuousnes / & auenge
the spoiled from the power of the wronge
doer. The straunger / the fatherlesse / and
wedewe / see thou moleste not / hurt / nor
robbe: nother shede ye innocent blode in
this place. And if ye obserue these thingis
constantly: the kingis which shal sitte in
the seat of Dauid / shal go thorow the gates
of this house / and be caryed in charyets
and vpon horse / both they / their seruants / 
and their peple. But if thou obseruest
not these precepts: I swere by my
nownselfe (saith the Lorde) that this house
shalbe desolate. For euen thus hath the
Lorde spokē vpō the house of Juda. Thou
arte the head euen as is Galaad in Libano:
but if I bringe not the & thy cytes into
a deserte / yt they be not inhabited.neuer truste me. the forme of his othe in ye scripture. For
I shal apoynte forth / & sende into ye a destroyer
with is weapens to cutdowne thy
chosen Cedres & caste thē into ye fyer. And
whā any other naciō shal passe forby this
cyte: one shal saye to another: wherfor hathe
ye Lorde done thus vnto this grete cite
                     •
                  
                  
Thā it shalbe answerde: euē because they
forsoke & despysed the couenaunt of their

moorne yet not for him: but wepe sore for
him now going a waye: For this mā shal
neuer come ageyn / nor yet se his owne natiue
lande. For thus saith the Lorde vpon
Sellumotherwyse called Joachas now led captyuein to Egypt the sone of Josias kinge of Juda
raigning aftir Josias his father. He that
is goneforth of this regiō / shal neuermore
returne. For he shal dye in the same place / 
into whiche he is ledde captiue & neuermore

his house by iniurye and wronge &
setteth vp his parlers and chaumbers by
fraude and violence / which maketh his
owne neighbour to serue him for naught / not
geuinge him his rewarde for his labour.
Thus thinketh he with himselfe. I
wil buyld me a large house & costely chaū
                  bres.
He cutteth him forth windowes / beames
and grounsels of Cedre & paynteth
them with reade. Thinkest thou nowe to
raigne / whan with thy cedre buyldingis
thou prouokest me to enuye and to be auē
                  ged?
Did not thy father in his trwe and
iuste labour eat & drinke & prospered wel?
Whiles he auenged the cause of the poore

oppressed / he prospered wel: which thinge / whereof

the Lorde vpō Joakim sone of Josias kinge

I will not heare: this verely was thy maner
euē frō thy yougth / that thou woldest
not obaye my voyce. All thy pastors shal
be ruled and blown awaye of the winde / 
and thy louers shalbe caryed awaye
into captiuite: and than verely thou shalt
be shamed and confounded for thy grete
wykednes and malice / which yet dwellest
in Libano & nestelest in the Cedres. How

grete shal thy sorowful sighes be whan
this ruyne shal fall vpon the lyke panges
vpon the traueler of chylde?Jechonias is called Joachin. As verely
as I lyue (saith the Lorde) though Jechonias
the sone of Joakim kinge of Juda be
the signet whiche I weare on mi right hande:
yet shal I pluk him of from hence: & betake
the into the handis of them that seke
thy lyfe / into the power of them whose face
thou fearest / euem into the hande of Nebuchadrezar
kinge of Babylon / & into the
handis of the Caldes. And shal translate
the and thy mother that bore the into a
strange lande / where ye were not borne / but
ye shal dye in it. And into this lande / whither
ye shal so sore desyer to returne / shal
ye neuer come agene. This man Jechonias / 
shalbe plucked & torne in peses lyke
a cōtemptible grauen image / which for
al his costely aparel / yet pleaseth he nomā
wherfore he shalbe baneshed / both he & his

But oh erthe / erthe / erthe: hear the worde
of the Lorde. Thus saith the Lorde.
Bill me this man barain to be emōge the

               UVo be the herdemen that destroye

Wherfore this commaundement sendeth
the Lorde God of Israel vnto the herdemen
that shulde gouerne my peple. ye

ye loke not vpon them. Wherfore I shal
loke vpō your wyked counsels & studyes

the tyme shal come saith the Lorde / that
I wil stere vp that rightuouse. Budde
or braunche of Dauid to raigne and to
execute his offyce prudently in restoring
equite and rightwysnes in the erthe.
               In his dayes Juda shalbe saued and Israel
shal dwel suer. And this is the name
that men shal cal him by / euen the Lorde / our

shal come saith the Lorde / that men shal
nomore swere. As verely as the Lorde

lyuith whiche led the childern of Israel
oute of the lande of Egypte / but as verely
as the Lorde lyueth which hath ledforth
and brought agene the sead of the
house of Israel from the northe este lande:
and from al the regions into whiche I
had dispersed thē / to dwel in their owne
lande. Wo be to the Prophetis also. My
herte is alto broken / al my bones ar shyured
in sondre. I am lyke a dronken man
troubled with wyne: for feare of the Lorde
and his holy worde. For therthe is ful
of aduouterers / wherfore it is now come / yt
she being a cursed & aborred / shal waile:
& hir plesante feldis of the deserte shalbe
withred vp: For the lyuinge of these men
is euel / & their powr contrarye to the holy
worde. Both Prophet and Prieste ar polluted
and be filthy ipocrytes / and their
maliciouse wykednes is espyed euē in my
house saith ye lorde. Wherfore their waye
shalbe slybery / and ful of stomblinge stones
in derkenes at which they shal stomble
and fall: for I shal bringe a plage vpō
them / euen the day of their visitaciō / saith
the Lorde. The same foleshnes which I
sawe amonge the Prophetis of Samarye
wherby they preched for Baalis profite
& decyued my peple of Israel: I haue now

shulde neuer returne from their wykednes
Thei al with their cytesens ar vnto
me lyke Sodome & the cytesens of Gomorre.
Wherfore thus saith the Lorde of powers
vpon the Prophetis. Beholde I shal
fede them with wormewode and geue thez
to drinke water mengled with gall. For
oute of the Prophetis of Jerusalem ar
brokenforth the contagious spottis of al

Figges do I se / of which some be very

vnto you al his seruantis / euen his Prophetes

yet ye obayed not / nor once inclined your

Turne ye agene euery man from his owne

and ye shal inhabit the lande which
the Lorde gaue you and your fathers frome
age to age. And go not your wayes
aftir strange goddis to serue them and to
fall downe before them: Anger me not
with the workis of your owne handis:
and I shal not scourge you. But ye herde
me not saith the Lorde: for ye angred me
with the workis of your handis / but not
vnpunesshed. Wherfor thus sayd the Lorde
of powers. Because ye herde not my
wordis / therfore beholde / I shal sende and
call vpon you all the nacions of the northe

also kinge of Babylon my
seruante / and shal bringe them vpon this
lande / & vpō the inhabitours therof / and

shal vtterly destroye them. I shal bringe
them into a deserte / into an hissing and
perpetual desolacion. And I shal take
from them the voyce of gladnes and solace / 
the voyce of the brydegrome and spouse / 
the voyce of men oynted and hanged
ful of swete & fresshe flowers to bere the
lightis. And al this lande shalbe turned
into a deserte & wildernes. And they shal

serue the forsayd nacions and the kynge
of Babylon .lxx. yearis. And whan these
lxx. yearis be fulfilled: I shal also viset ye

lande also of the Caldeis / and bringe
thē togither into a perpetual wildernes.
And I shal bringe vpon that lande al my
wordis which I haue decreed agenst it / euē
al that be writen in this boke whiche
Jeremy prophecied agenst al the gentiles.
For euen they to shalbe bond seruants to
many nacions and grete kinges. For I
shal rewarde them aftir their sinnes and
workis of their owne handis. Thus therfore
spake the Lorde God of Israel vnto

firste of al I gaue euen Jerusalem hirselfe
and the cites of Juda / hir kinges & princes
to drinke therof / to bringe them into a
deserte and wyldernes / into an hissinge &

execrable curse / euen as we see vnto this

to drinke therof / as Pharao kinge of Egypte / his

The Lorde shal thondre from aboue / and

He shal thonder with grete noyse frō his
kingis haule. The lowde noyse lyke the
grape gatherers shal come before vpon
al thin habitours of therthe: and the sowne
shalbe brought vnto the vttermost costes
of therthe. For the Lorde wil sitte in
iugement vpon the naciōs & declare him
self the iuge of al maner men liuing to betake
the vngodly vnto the swerde / saith
the Lorde. For thus saith the Lorde of
powers. Beholde / a miserable calamite
shal go thorowe the gentyles one aftir

stered vp from diuerse costes of therthe / &
ye swerde shal krepe thorowe with slaughter
in that daye from one coste of therthe
to the tother. Noman shalbe moorned for
non gatherde vp / noman buried: but lyke

donge shal they lye vpon ye face of therthe.
Howle oute oh ye pastours & crye / bespriene
your selue with asshes oh ye rāmes &

slaughter & downe tredinge is fulfilled: &
ye shal faldowne togither lyke costely byral
vessels made to cōtayne daintes. There
shalbe no waye to fle for the pastours / for
the rammes of the flocke shal not escape.
Than shal the pastours crye oute / &
the rāmes of the flocke shal howle. For
the Lorde shal waste & consume their pastures.
And their best feldis shal lye dead
with out noyse / for the furye of the Lordis
wrathe. They shal forsake their foldes
weping and roringe lyke lyons. For
their lande shalbe desolate for his indignacion

geuen you / hearing the sermons of my
seruants the Prophetis whom I sende

If you (I saye) obaye not: I shal make this
same house like vnto Sylo: and euen thissame
cite shal I caste into a contumeliouse
curse to be aborred of al the nacions of the
erthe. And the Priestis and Leuits with
al the peple herde Jeremy preching these
sermons in the house of the Lorde. Wherfore
whan Jeremy had made an ende of
al that the Lorde commanded him to preche
vnto the peple: the Priestis / Prophetis
and al the peple did set holde vpon him
and toke him saing. Thou muste dye.
Wherfore prechedst thou as thoughe the
Lorde had cōmanded the / that it shuld hapen
vnto this house as it did once to Sylo / and
that this cite shulde be destroyed that
noman shulde inhabit it? And whan al
the peple were gathered to gither in the
temple aboute Jeremye / the rumour of

this mater came vnto the chefe rulers of
Juda / which a non camvp from the kinges
palace vnto the house of the Lorde: &
sate downe to gither before the newe dore
of the temple. Than came the Priestis and
Prophetis vnto the rulers and to al the
peple saynge these wordis This man is
giltye dethe / for he preched agenst this cite / 
as he ye haue herde with your eares.
Than sayd Jeremye vnto al the rulers &
to al the peple / these wordes. The Lorde
sente me to preche agenste this house and
this cyte al that ye haue herde. Nowe therfore
amende your lyuinge & your thoughtis / 
and obaye the voice of your Lorde
God: and than it shal forthinke the Lorde
God of thafflicciō / whiche he hath decreed
agenste you. And as for me / lo I am in
your handis / do with me what semeth to
you right & good. But yet this one thinge
I assuer you / that if ye kill me / ye shal
make your selues / this cite / and the citesens
therof gilty my innocent blode. For
this I ensuer you: the Lorde hath sente me
to you to preache into your eares al these
sermons. Than sayd the Princes and all
the peple vnto the Priestis and Prophetis:
ye can fynde no cause of dethe in this
man / sith he preched vnto vs in the name / 

of our Lorde. Also the elders of the
lande rose vp to gither sayng vnto the hole
company of the peple on this maner.
Micheas Morastith / was a Prophete in
the dayes of Ezechias kinge of Juda: and
this Micheas sayd to al the folke of Juda.
Thus saith the Lorde of powers. Zion
shalbe ploughed vp lyke a felde: and Jerusalem
shalbe turned into an heape of
stones: And the hill where the house of ye
Lorde standeth into an highe wode. And
yet notwithstandinge this sermone / did
nether Ezechias kinge of Juda nor yet
the comen peple go once aboute to slaye
him?This presidēt ye priestes brouht forthagēst Jeremy nothīg consydering that Vrias was vniustly slayn. But did they not rather reuerently
feare the Lorde / and prayd him to turne
a waye his wrathe? Wher vpon it forthinked
him of the plage which he had decreed
vpon them. And shal we nowe committe
so grete a cryme agenste our selues?
But yet was there a nother that preached
constantly in the name of the Lorde / called
Vrias the sone of Semee of Cariathiearim
which preched agenst this cite
and lande in al poyntis euen aftir the sermons
of Jeremye: And kinge Joachim
with al the grete men and rulers herde
his sermons: wher vpon the kinge sought

to kil him. But whan Vrias herde of it / he
feared and fled into Egypte. Then sent
kinge Joachim officers into Egypte as
Elnathan the sone of Achbor with certayne
sergeants with him which led Vrias
oute of Egypte / and brought him to
kinge Joachim / whiche slewe him with
his swerde / and caste his carkas into the
comen place of other malefactours. But
as for Jeremye is holpen of Ahikam the
sone of Saphan / that he be not geuen into
the handis of the peple to be slayne.
These thingis were done of the Lorde / 
to Jeremye / in the beginninge of the raigne
of Joachim sone of Josias kinge of
Juda.

               ¶The .xxvii. Chapiter.
               
                  
Thus spake the Lorde vnto me. Make
the kolers and chaynes fet for thy
necke / & sende them to the kinge of Edom / to
the kinge of Moab / to the kinge of the
childerne of Ammon / to the kinge of Tyre / 
to the kinge of Zidon / & that by thambassiadours
that be now come to Jerusalem
to Zedechias kinge of Juda / cōmaunding
them to bere these messages vnto their
maisters. Thus commaundeth you ye Lorde
of powers and God of Israel / that ye
tel your maisters thus. I am he that made
the erthe / man and beast which ar vpon ye
face of ye erth thorow my grete pour and
forthstretched arme: & geuen it vnto him
whom it hath pleased me. And nowe shal
I geue vp al these regions into the power
of my seruāt Nebuchadnezar kinge of Babylon.
I shal geue him also the beastis of
the felde to do him seruice: And al natiōs
shal serue him / and his sone & his neuye.
Many natiōs and grete kingis shal serue
him (I saye) vntil thetyme of destruccion tyme also of the
same lande be come to. And that nacion or
kingdome which wilnot serue Nebuchadnezer
kinge of Babylon / nor wilnot put
their neckis vnder the yoke of the kinge
of Babylon / I shal viset euen the same nacion
with swerde honger & pestelence vntil

I haue consumed them in his handis saith
the Lorde. Wherfore se that ye hear not
your prophetes / dyuines / dreame sayers / 
sorcerers / charmers / whiche tel you: ye
shal not serue the kinge of Babylon. For
they preache you lyes / to sende you a waye
farre from your lande: and that I shulde
expel you that ye might perisshe. But the
nacion that wil put his necke vnder the
yoke of the kinge of Babylon and serue
him: them shal I leue stil vpon their own
lande / saith the Lorde: and they shal replenisshe
it and inhabit it / ye and euen vnto
Zedechias kinge of Juda haue I tolde ye same
thing in euery poynt sayng. Put your
neckes vnder the yoke of the kinge of Babylon / 
and serue him and his peple / that
al youers might be salfe. Wherfore shuldeye
be slayne / bothe thou and thy peple
with swerde / honger / and pestelence? as ye
Lorde hath decreed it vpon what so euer
nacion it be / that refuseth to serue the kinge
of Babylon. And yet I tel you agene.
Hear not the sermōs of the Prophetis prechinge
and sayng vnto you. Serue not the
kinge of Babylon: for they preche you but
a lye. Nether did I sende them / saith the
Lorde / although they be so bolde to preche
lyes in my name / that I shuld the soner caste

you forthe to perisshe with these men
that thus preche vnto you. Also I spake
vnto the preistis & to al this peple thus.
This cōmandeth the Lorde. Hear not the
wordis of ye prophetis preching you these
thingis. Beholde / the Iwel
                     •
                  s of the house
of the Lorde shalbe brought agene shortly
from Babylon: For thy preache you
but a lye / hear them not / but serue ye kinge
of Babylon that ye may abyde salfe.
Wherfore shulde this cite be brought into
a wyldernes? And if they wil nedis be
proued trwe Prophetis & the worde of the
Lorde to be cōmitted vnto thim: let them
make intercession (I beseche you) before
the Lorde of powers that the reamnaunte
of ye iues & vessels of ye lordis house / of ye
kingis house of Juda / & of Jerusalem come
not to Babylon to. For thus spake ye lorde
of powers as towchinge ye pylers / ye lauer
& the socketis withe other vessels & Iwels
yet lefte in this cite: which Nebuchadnezar
kinge of Babylon toke not a waye / whan
he caried awaye Jechonias ye sone of Joachim
kinge of Juda / from Jerusalem to Babylon
with al the rulers of Juda and Jerusalem.
Thus (I saye) spake the Lorde
of powers euen the God of Israel as concerninge
the reste of these vessels & iuels

both of the house of the Lorde and of the
kingis house of Juda and of Jerusalem.
They shalbe translated to Babylon there
to continwe til I shal viset them agene
(sathe the Corde) and then shal I restore
and bringe them agene into this same
place.
            
            
               ¶The .xxviii. Chapiter.
               IT came so to passe / That in the four
the year of Zedechias kinge of Juda / the
fiste moneth: Ananias the sone of
Azur / Prophete of Gabaon / spake vnto
me in the house of the Lorde in the presence
of the preistis and of al the peple saynge.
Thus sayd the Lorde of powers the God
of Israel. I haue broken in peises the yoke
of the kinge of Babylon. So that aftir .ii.
year / I shal restore into thissame place al
the vessels & iuels of the house of the Lorde:
Which Nebuchadnezar kinge of Babylon
toke oute of this place and translated
into Babylon. ye / and euen Jechonias sone
of Joachim kinge of Juda with al the
captiues of Juda which ar led to Babylon / 
I shal bringe agene vnto this place / saith
the Lorde. For I shal breke the kinge
of Babylonis yoke. Then Jeremy ye Prophete
answerde the prophete Anamas befor
the priestis and al the peple standing

by them in the house of the Lorde. And the
Prophete Jeremie sayd Amen / the Lorde
mought it so do / and make thy prophecie
to stande / in restoringe the iuels of the lordis
house and al the captiues from Babylon
into this place. Nethelesse yet hear
what I shal saye to the in the presens of al
this peple. The Prophetis which were before
vs in al tymes paste / bothe ouer many
regions and great kingdoms / propheciyng
other batail / calamite / pestilence / or
peace / were proued trwe in this one
thing / that ye Lorde doutles had sent thez:
if the thinge came so to passe / whiche the
prophete had tolde them before. And Anamas
the Prophet toke a chayne from the
Prophete Jeremies necke and alto broke
it in pieses / sayng on this maner / al the peple
hearing it. Thus saith the Lorde.
               Euen thus shal I breke the yoke of Nebuchadnezar
kinge of Babylon with in these
.ii. years from the nek of euery nacion.
And here Jeremy went his wayes home.
But the worde of the Lorde was shewed
him aftir Ananias the Prophete had broken
the chayne from ye Prophet Jeremyes
necke on this maner. Go and tel Ananias
these wordes. Thus saith the Lorde. Ananias / 
thou hast broken cheynes of wode / 

but for thē / Jeremye thou / shalt make agene
chaynes of yerne. For thus saith ye Lorde
of powers the God of Israel. I shal laye
a yoke of yerne vpon al these naciōs that
they shal serue Nebuchadnezar kinge of
Babylon / that shal they. And euen the
beastis of ye felde shal I betake vnto him / so
shal I. Than sayd the Prophete Jeremy
vnto ye Prophete Ananias. Hear (I beseche
the) Ananias. The Lorde sente the
not: but thou goist a boute to bringe this
peple into a vayne and false hope. Wherfore
thus saith the Lorde. Beholde / I shal
sende ye therfore: but whither? verely euen
frō the face of the erthe. For withyn this
same year shalt thou be dead. For ful emnyously
and despightfully hast thou spoken
agenste ye Lorde. And so Ananias dyed
the same year in the seuenth monethe.
            
            
               ¶The argument of this .xxix. Chapiter.
Ther arose certayn false Prophetis amonge
the captynes in Babylon / whiche promised
themselues liberty to retourne aftir Ananias
his saing with in two year: but these false Prophetis
Jeremye confutethe.
               THese ar the wordes of ye pistle which
the prophete Jeremy sent from Jerusalem
vnto ye men in captiuite: both to the
elders / priestes / prophets / & to ye peple also

whom Nebuchadnezar had led a waye to

               Whom Zedechias kinge of Juda sent to
Babylon to Nebuchadnezar kinge of Babylon:
the pistel (I saye) cōtayning these
wordis. Thus saith ye Lorde of powers ye
God of Israel vnto al the captiues that ar led
from Jerusalem to Babylon. Buyld ye
houses to dwel in / plante gardens & hortyardis
to eate their frutes / marye wyues
to bringforth sonnes & daughters: ye / and
geue your sonnes & your daughters housbandes
that they maye bringforthe sonnes
& daughters / & encrease there gretely.
Studye in nowyse to be fewe in nowmber
But study for ye prosperouse peace of ye same
cite wheryn ye be holdē captiue & praye

ye god of Israel. Let not ye prophetes wt your

lyes in my name. I sent thē not saith ye lorde.
But thus saith ye Lorde. Whan ye haue

fulfilled .lxx. years in Babylon / I shal viset

not my set purposes decreed vpon you / saith
ye Lorde. They ar coūsels of holsom

haue a fresshe a better hope. ye shal crye

ye Lorde / & restore you into thissame

touching this / where ye saye the lorde
to haue stered vp Prophets in Babylon.
Thus saith ye Lorde / both as concerninge

al ye peple yt inhabit this cite / with
your brothern yt ar not yet gone with you

they obayed not my cōmandements (saith

saithe the Lorde. And al you in captiuite / whom
I sente from Jerusalem to Babylon / 
hear the worde of the Lorde. Thus
saith the Lorde of powrs the God of Israel / 
as concerninge Ahab the sone of Colie / 
and Zedekia sone of Maasie whiche
prophecy lyes vnto you in my name. Beholde / 
I shal geue them into the handis of
Nebuchadnezar kīge of Babylon to slaye
them before your faces. And al the captiues
of Juda whiche ar in Babylon shall

me for my sinnes committed in

               ¶The .xxxii. Chapiter
               THe sermone of the Lorde / shewed to
Jeremye the .x. year of Zedechias
kinge of Juda: whiche was the .xviii. year
of Nebuchadrezar. Than the hoste of the
kinge of Babylon layd sege to Jerusalem.
And Jeremy the Prophete was in holde
in the vtter warde which was at the kinges
house of Juda: wheryn Zedechias kinge
of Juda had caste him / because he prophecyed
thus. Thus saith ye Lorde: Lo / I
shal geue vp this cite into the handis of
the kinge of Babylon / and he shal take it.
And kinge Zedechias shal not escape the
handis of the Chaldes: but douteles shal
be delyuerde into the handis of the kinge
of Babylon / which shal speak with him
mouthe to mouthe / and shal beholde eche
other face to face. And Zedechias shalbe
led to Babylon / there to cōtinew til I viset
him / saith the Lorde. But if thou wilt
nedis fight agēste the Caldes: thou shalt
fight infortunatly: Vnto the which accusacion / 
Jeremy thus answerde. It was
the Lorde that spake vnto me on this maner:
Lo Hananeel the sone of Sellum thy

eames sone shal come to the / desyering ye to
redeme for thy selfe the felde whiche lyeth
in Anathot / because it pertayneth to the
to bye it agene by ye reason thou arte nexte
of kinne. Than came Hananeel my eames
sone acording to the sayng of ye Lorde
vnto me into the vtterwarde of the presone / 
sayng :
I praye ye bye my felde which
is in Anathot in the Lande of Beniamin:
for it is thy right by the reason of nexte
of our kin. Redeme it therfore I praye the.
I know al this to be done by the Lordis
commandement / wherfore I bought this
felde of Hananeel my eames sone which
dwelled at Anathot. And I wayed him
forth his money euen .vii. sicles and .x.
peses of syluer. And the writing made and
sealed and witnes called to / I wayd forthe
the money in the skoles: and receiued
the copye wherby I chalenged and posseded
it. Aftir this was it sealed acording
to the forme of the lawe and dewe order / and
rehersed with the copye therof. And I
delyuerd this copye wherby I held it vnto
Baruch ye sonne of Nerie / sonne of Mahasie
(Hananeel my eames sonne being
present before ye witnesses whose names
were writē in ye instrumēt wherby I helde
it) al ye Iwes at laste being by whiche sate

aboute vs in the sayd warde: cōmanding
this Baruch before them on this maner.
This is ye Lorde of powers plesure ye God
of Israel / yt thou receyuest this instrument
sealed wt this copye / & put it into an erthē
potte yt it maye continew longe. For thus
hath ye Lorde of powers / ye God of Israel
decreed: That ye houses / feldes / & vynyardis
in this lande / shalbe possessed agein.
Wherfor I made my prayer to ye Lorde aftyr
ye delyueraūce of this instrument vnto
Baruch the sone of Neerie on this maner
sayng: Ah lorde God: lo thou art he yt made
heuē & erthe by thy mighty power & highe
strēgth & nothing is harde or of difficulty
vnto ye. Thou doist mercy vpō thousandis / 
thou rewardest ye wikednes of the
fathers into the bosoms of their childern
which ar borne aftir thē. Thou art yt great
& mighty God / whose name is ye Lorde of
powers / great in counsel and infinite in
thought. Thy eyen beholde al the wayes
of man to rewarde euery man for his owne
wayes & for ye frutes of his inuenciōs.
Which hast done signes & wondres in the
lande of Egypte / as we wel knowe euen
vnto this daye / as wel vpō this same Israel
as vpō these mē to magnifye thy name
as it is right great vnto this daye. And

thou leddest forth Israel thy peple oute of
ye lande of Egypt wt signes & woūders / wt
a mighty hande / a forthstretched arme &
great power. And gauest thē thissame lande / 
as thou haddest sworne to their fathers
to geue them a lande flowing wt mylke &
honey. But whā they were come & had posseded
it: they obayed not thy voyce / nor
walked not in thy lawe: but what so euer
thou cōmandest them to do / yt they did not.
wherfore al these affliccions & plages ar
come vpō thē Lo they come wt bulwarkis
euē vnto this cite to take it / whiche ouercome
withe swerde / hōger / and pestelence / shalbe
delyuerd vp into ye handes of the
Chaldeis whiche euen nowe fight so sore
agēst it. And what so euer thou hast sayd / it
shal come to passe / for lo / al thinges ar
present vnto ye. And yet / thou Lorde God
notwithstāding / cōmādest me sayng: chalenge
ye thy felde / ye money payd before witnes / whā
ye cyte in ye meā ceason must come
into ye hādis of ye Cal
                     •
                  es? Thā came ye worde
of ye lorde to me. Lo / I am ye lorde God of
al thinges lyuīge: is ther any thing harde
vnto me? Wherfor thus cōmanderh ye lorde.
Lo / I shal betake this cite into ye power
of ye Caldes & into ye nower of Nebuchadrezar
kinge of Babylō which shal take it.

For the Chaldes shal come & fight agenst
this cyte and set fyer on it / and it shalbe
burned with the houses in whose parlers
they burned sacrifices to Baal / and offred
to strange Gods / that they might the more
prouoke me to anger. For whan ye childerne
of Israel and Juda had done al maner
of synne in my sight euen fro their
yeugth. What els was it that they dyd
than prouoked me onely by the workis of
their owne handis / saith ye lorde? Or what
els was this cyte / than a prouoking stocke
of my wrathe fro the daye that it was
bylded vnto this present hower? In whiche
hower / I shal wel worthely take it a
waye frome oute of my sight for the synnes
of the chylderne of Israel and Juda / whiche
they committed to anger me / both
they their selues / their kinges / their rulers / 
their priestes / their Prophetes / al Juda / &
the cytesens of Jerusalem. They turned
their backes and not their face to me / whan
I taught them & warned them in tyme:
nether gaue they eare to receyue my disciplyne.
They did set their idolls in ye house
consecrated vnto my name to pollute it.
They bylded highe places for Baal in
ye vale of Benhinnon their to consecrate
and to geue their sonnes and daughters

euen to Moloch: which thinge I neuer cō
                  manded
them / nether did it euer touche my
mynde / that I wolde thus drawe Juda into
syn to committe these abominacions.
Ouer this yet agein spake the Lorde God
of Israel / as concerning this cyte whiche
(euen yourselues being present) shalbe
geuen vp into the hande of the kinge of
Babylon / the cyte (I say) first ouercomen
with swerde / honger and pestelence.
Lo I shal gather them from al the regiōs
into whiche I had dispersed them in my
wrathe / furye / and great indignacion / and
shal bring them into this same place / where
they shal dwel suer. They shal be my peple / 
and I their God. And I shal geue them
one herte / and one waye that they mought
feare me at al tymes. Which thinge shal
profit them & their childerne aftir them.
               Also I shal smyte an euerlasting couenāt
with them / that I wil neuer cease to do
them good / that I wil geue my feare into
their hertis / that they fall not fro me / that
I shal delyght in doing them good / ye and
that I shal plante them in this lande in
very truthe with al my herte and with al
my soule. For thus sayd ye Lorde / lyke as
I haue brought vpon this peple al this
great affliccion: euen so shal I bringe vpō
                  
them ageine al maner of goodnes which
I haue layd vp for them. And their feldis
shalbe possessed in this lande / which ye
graūte now worthely to bedesolated & for
saken of man & beast / & to be brought into
the handis of ye Caldes. The feldis (I tell
you) shalbe bought with money / instrumentis
wryten ther vpon and sealed before
witnes in the lande of Beniamin & rowndaboute
Jerusalem / thorowout the cytes
in the deserte. For I shal bringe ageyn
their captiuite / saith the Lorde.
            
            
               ¶The .xxxiii. Chapiter.
               AGeyne / the worde of God came vnto
Jeremye / whyle he was yet in holde
in the vtter warde / on this maner. Thus
saith ye Lorde which bringeth his worde to
passe / the Lorde which accomplessheth his
thoughtis and purposes / euen he whose
name is the Lorde. Thou cryedst vnto me / and
I answerde the / aud I expowned the
great and highe thinges which were vnknowne
vnto you. Thus (I saye) saith
the Lorde God of Israel as concerninge
the houses of this cyte & the kingis houses
of Juda to be thronedowne with ordinaunce
and weapen / the caldes now coming
vpon to wonne it / fillinge these houses
with mennis caryons / whom I shal

smyte in my wrath & furye / my face turned
awaye fro this cyte for the multitude
of their malice. Lo / I shal close vp their
woundes & heale them. I shal open them
the tresure of peace and faithfulnes: And
I shal suerly bryng ageyne Juda and Israel
and restore them as they were before.
And I shal pourge them frome al heir wykednes
committed agenst me / and parden
al their synnes done so spyght fully agenst
me: wherby I shal get me a blessed & glad
name into my prayse and glorye amonge
al the naciōs of therthe whiche shal hear
of al my goodnes shewed vpon them. For
they shal feare and be astoned to se howe
great goodnes and peace I shal bestow on
them so louingly. Also thus saith ye Lorde.
And ageyne / there shalbe herde in this place
whiche ye saye also shalbe turned into
a wildernes / so that nether man nor beast
shalbe in it / and in the cyte of Juda / & withoute
Jerusalem / whiche also shalbe desolate
/ so that nother man nor beast inhabit
them / ther shalbe herde (I saye) ye voyce of
men makinge myrthe ioye & solace / euen
the voyce of the brydegrome wt his spouse / 
& the voyce of men singinge. Magnifye
ye the Lorde of powers: for right good is
the Lorde whose mercy endureth for euer.

Ther shalbe herde the voyce of men knowleging
God with giftis in the Lordis
house. For I shal restore ye captiuite of this
lande into their olde state saith the Lorde.
Thus saith the Lorde of powers. Ther
shalbe ageyn in this region nowe desolate
man and beste and in al hir cytes / in the
cytes of the mountayns / of the playnes / 
& in the deserte / herdemēnis lodges kepinge
their flockes: In the lande of Beniamin / 
in the felde of Jerusalem / & in the cytes
of Juda / the flockes shalbe noumbred
agene vnder the handis of ye teller / saith
the Lorde. Beholde the dayes shal come
saith the Lorde / that I shal performe this
goodnes whiche I haue promysed to the
house of Israel & Juda. In these dayes & in
that tyme / I shal bringforthe yt rightuouse
budde of Dauid which shal do equyte
& rightuousnes vpon the erthe.Cryste is that rightwyse budde. In these
dayes Juda shalbe made salfe / & Jerusalem
shaldwel suerly. And he shalbe called
in hir / euen thus. The Lorde our rightwisnes.
For euen thus promyseth God. The
sead of Dauid shalnot be withoute a man
to sitte in the kinges seat of the house of
Israel. The preistis also & the Leuites shal
not lak a man to offer before me sacrifices
to burne the sacrifice / ministringe & offeringe

the slayne offeraunces euery daye.
Also the worde of the Lorde was shewed
to Jeremye on this maner. If it be possible
my couenant to be broken which I haue
smyten with the daye & night: so that nother
ye daye nor ye night folowe not in their
tyme: so is it impossible my couenaunt to
be voyde whiche I haue made wt Dauid
my seruant: & so not to haue a sonne raigninge
in his seat. And euen lykewyse shalnot
my seruice lake Leuite and Preiste.Cryste was of ye sead of Dauid bothe preste & m

                     chisedech.
               
               For as the starres of heuen cannot be
nowbred / nor the sea sandes mesured / euen
so shal I encrease the sead of my seruant
Dauid / my Leuites and ministres. Ouer
this yet came the worde of ye Lorde ageyn
to Jeremy thus. Vnderstandest thou not
what this peple saith? Ther be two kynredis
(say they) whom ye Lorde hath chosen / 
and euen these same bothe hath he caste
awaye (for to this is my peple brought
that they beleue themselues neuer to come
in togither withe the gentyles) wherfore
thus saith ye Lorde. If I haue not smitten
a bargē with ye day & night. If I haue not
geuen lawes to ye heuen & erthe: the sead of
Jacob & Dauid my seruant now shal I caste
awaye / so that I receyue not of his ysswe
to be princes ouer the sead of Abraham / 

Isaac and Jacob. For I shal repayer
their fall and be merciful vnto them.

               THe sermone which was shewed of ye
Lorde vnto Jeremy (whan Nebuchadrezar
kinge of Babylon / with al his
hoste gatherd from al ye regions of his lande / that
were vnder his impery / and al his
peple made bataile agenste Jerusalem & hir
cytes borderinge aboute hir) one this maner.
Thus commandeth the Corde God of
Israel. Go and speke to Zedechias kinge
of Juda / & tel him: Thus saith the Lorde.
Lo / I shal betake this cyte into the hande
of the kinge of Babylon / whiche shal set
fyer vpon it: & thou thy selfe shalt not escape
his hande / but be led captiue & delyuerde
into his power. Thy eyen shal beholde
the present face of ye kinge of Babylon / 
& he shal speke vnto the / mouthe to mouthe:
& than shalt thou come to Babylon.
But yet hear the worde of the Lorde (Zedechias
kinge of Juda) Thus ye Lorde telleth
the. That thou shalt not be slayne with
swerde / but thou shalt dye in peace. For
they shal burne ye in the fyer / as they brente
thy fathers ye kinges thy predicessours.
And shal geue the thy moorning tuwne / 
sayng. Ah Master. For this counsel haue

I taken saith the Lorde. And the Prophete
Jeremy spake vnto Zedechie kinge of Juda
al these sermōs at Jerusalem / whan the
kinge of Babylons hoste layd sege to Jerusalem
and to al the other cytes of Juda
that were lefte / as to lachis and Azecham

And agreyng to this lawe / they obayed &

Also ye shal nether plante nor possede

               ¶The .xxxvi. Chapiter.
               THe fowerth yere of Joachim the sonne
of Josias kinge of Juda: thus did
the Lorde his worde vnto Jeremy sayng.
Take the a grete boke and wryte therin
al the sermons whiche I haue spoken vnto
the to be preched vnto Israel / Juda / and to
al nacions: sence I begane to fpeke with
the in the raygne of Josias / vnto this present
daye: If paraduenture yet the house
of Juda hearing / al these affliccions
wiche I purpose to do to them / turne euery
man from his euil waye / & I forgeue them
their wykednes and synne. Then Jeremy
called to him Baruch the sone of Nerie:
And Baruch did wryte in the boke / at the

mouthe of Jeremy al the sermons of the
Lorde spoken vnto Jeremy. And Jeremy
commanded Baruch sayng. It is not suer
for me to come into the house of the Lorde.
Go thou therfore / and rede this boke wryten
of my mouthe / the very wordis of the
Lorde / al the peple hearing it in the daye
of the faste / and al Juda hearing it to / ye
& euen vnto them to that ar comen hither
from their cytes shalt thou rede thē. If paraduenture
they wil submitte their prayers
vnto the presence of ye Lorde / & so returne
euery man from his euelwaye. For grete
is the wrathe & indignacion ordened of
God for this peple. Then did Baruch the
sone of Nerie to his powr al that Jeremy
the Prophet commanded him reding of the
boke the sermons of the Lorde / in the house
of the Lorde. And this was done the fyfte
yere of Joachim sone of Josias kinge
of Juda in the nyenthe moneth whan they
commanded al the peple to faste to pease
the Lorde:It wa
                        •

                      byr. as wet the peple of Jerusalem
as them that came thither frome the other
cytes. Then did Baruch rede on the boke / 
Jeremyes sermōs at the house of the Lorde / 
standing in the vestry of Gamarie sone
of Saphan the scrybe: whiche vestry is
by the ouer vestry before the newe dore

of the temple / al the peple hering them.
And when Micheas / sone of Gamarie the
sone of Saphan had herde al the sermons
of the Lorde oute of the boke: He wente
downe to the kinges house vnto the scrybes
counting house. For ther sate the rulers / 
Elisama scrybe / Dalias sone of Semei / 
Elnathan the sone of Achbori / Gamarias
sone of Saphan / Zedechias sone
of Hanany with al the rulers. And Micheas
tolde them al the sermons whiche
he had herde of Baruch red out of the boke / 
al the peple hearing. And al the rulers
sente Jehudi the sone of Nathany sone of
Salamy sone of Chusi vnto Baruch on
message saynge. Take the boke in thy hande
where vpon thou reddist / the peple hering
the / and come thy wais with me.
               Then toke Baruch the sone of Nery the
boke in his hande and came to them. And
they sayd vnto him. Sit downe (I pray
the) and rede / and let vs here them.
               And Baruch red them / they herkening thervnto:
And when they had herde al these
sermons / they wer astonned one gasyng
vpon a nother / sayng vnto Baruch / verely
we shal shewe ye kinge al these wordis.
And they asked Baruch thus. Tel vs I
pray ye how thow wrotest al these sermons

of his mouthe? Whom Baruch answerde:
he spake thē to me with his owne mouthe / 
whiche I alone being wt him receiued with
my penne into this boke. Then sayd ye rulers
vnto Baruch. Go & hyde ye with Jeremy
so that noman knowe where you be.
And these rulers went in to ye courte to the
kinge leuing ye boke in Elisams ye scrybis
studye / & tolde al the sermōs vnto the kingis
presence. Then sente ye kinge one Jehudi
to fetche ye boke: whiche brought frome
Elisams the scrybis study: and Jehudi
had red it / bothe the kinge himselfe & al the
rulers present hering it. The kinge then
abode in his wynter house: for it was
then nouembyr / and ther was a grete fyer
before him: And whan Jehudi had red
thre or fower leues / the boke was cut
in pesis with a penne knyfe and caste into
the fyer vpon the harthe tyl al the boke
was brente vp: notwithstandinge yet
in the mene ceason / they nether fered nor
cut their clothes / nother the kinge himselfe
nor his seruantis when they had herde
al these sermons. But Elnathan / Dalias / 
and Gamarias made intercession to
the kinge that the boke shulde not haue
had ben brente / but he herde them not:

but cōmanded Jerachmiel the sone of Hameleche / 
Sarie the sone of Ezriel and Salamie
sone of Achdiel to take Baruch / yt
wrote it / & Jeremy the Prophete to. But
the Lorde had hid them. Than came the
worde of the Lorde to Jeremy / aftir the
kinge had brēte the boke with the sermōs
which Baruch had writen at the mouthe
of Jeremy. The worde of the Lorde came
to Jeremy on this maner. yet agene take
the a nother boke / & wryte in it al the forsayde
sermons whiche wer in the boke before:
whiche Joachim kinge of Juda brē
                  te:
And tell Joachim kinge of Juda. Thus
saith the Lorde: Thou hast brente this boke / 
thus reuoluinge in thy mynde. For
what entent haste thou wryten in it this
mater: that the kinge of Babylon shal come
& subuerte this lande? & that he shulde
leue it desolate bothe man & beast? Wherfore
the Lorde saith as concerning Joachim
kinge of Juda. There shal non of his
stocke sit in the sete of Dauid. His carkase
shal be caste agenste the heat of the daye &
colde of the night. And I shal loke vpō the
wikednes both of him / of his sede / & of his
seruantis: and bringe vpon them & the inhabitours
of Jerusalem and vpon al Juda / 
al that grete affliccion whiche I tolde

thē before / al beit they herde me not. Then
Jeremy toke a nother boke / and gaue it to
Baruch the scrybe sone of Nery / whiche
wrote in it at Jeremyes mouthe al ye sermons
of the same boke that Joachim kinge
of Juda had brente: moreouer there were
added vnto them moo then before.
            
            
               ¶The .xxxvii. Chapiter.
               ZEdechias the sone of Josias / made
kinge of Nebuchadrezar kinge of
Babylon / raigned ouer the lande of Juda / in
the stede of Jechonias sone of Joachim
sone of Joachim. But nether he / nor his
seruātis / nor the peple of the lande obayd
the sermons of the Lorde whiche he spake
by Jeremy ye Prophet. Nethelesse yet was
kinge Zedechias fayne to sende Jehuchal
sone of Selemy and Zephaniam sone of
Maasy Prieste vnto the Prophet Jeremy / 
that they shulde say to him. Praye for vs
vnto our Lorde God we beseche the. For
Jeremy wente frely amonge the peple / not
yet put in preson. But nowe was Pharaous
hoste come out of Egypte: whō when
ye Caldeis nowe layng sege to Jerusalem
perceiued / they went bake from the cite.
And then was the worde of God shewed
vnto Jeremy the Prophet on this maner:
Thus saith the Lorde God of Israel: These

thing is shal ye answer the kinge of Juda
whiche sente you to enquyre it of me.
Beholde Pharaous hoste whiche came
forthe to helpe you / shal turne home agen
into Egypte: and the Caldes shal come
hither agen / and wyn and take this cyte
and set fyer on it: For so saith the Lorde:
Let it not synke in to your hertis to thinke
thus. Now ar the Caldes douteles gone
awaye from vs. For I ensuer you they
shal come agene. For albe it / ye had slayne
al ye Caldes hoste yt fightith yet agenste
you / so that very fewe of them / & that
wounded to / had ben yet lefte eche man
in his tente / yet shulde these ryse & burne
vp this cyte. And when the Caldes hoste
was remoued frome Jerusalem for fere
of the Egypcians hoste: Jeremy went
oute of Jerusalem to go vnto the lande
of Beniamin to set an order among his
kynsfolke. And when he came to the gate
called Beniamins gate / ther was a certayn
man / chief of the warde or watche
called Jerias sone of Selemy the sone of
Hanany / whiche toke him imputing vnto
him that he wolde haue slipte from them
to the Caldes. Which thing Jeremy sayd
was false / sayng I entended no thing lesse
then to fle to the Caldes. Whom Jerias

wolde not beleue: but toke Jeremy and led
him vnto the rulers. And the rulers being
angry with Jeremy / beit him & thrusted
him into presone at Jonathan the scrybs
house: for this man was the leiftenant of
the presone. And so was Jeremy let downe
into a depe dongē and there layed in stockis
a longe ceason. Then sente kinge Zedechias
& called him forth to him asking
him secretely at home in his house sayng:
Thinkest thou yt this besegynge of this
cyte now in doing is done of the Lorde?
And Jeremy answerde: ye. adding also / yt
thou shalt be delyuerde into the handis of
the kinge of Babylon. And ouer this / Jeremy
sayd vnto kinge Zedechias: What
haue I offended ether the / or thy seruantis / 
or this peple that ye haue thus caste
me into presone? Where be your Prophetis
that tolde you: the kinge of Babylon
shuld not come agenst you / nor yet once in
to this lande? Now therfore herken my
lorde the kinge / hear my peticion I beseche
your fauour / that ye commande me
no more to be led agen to the howse of Jonathan
the scrybe / leste I there dye. Then
kinge Zedechias commanded Jeremy the
Prophete to be shutte but in ye fore entry

of the presone / and to be geuen him euery
daye a lytel cake of brede withe oute any
other soden or rosted mete till al the brede
in the cyte were consumed. Then ther laye
Jeremy in the entre of the presone.
            
            
               ¶The .xxxviii. Chapiter.
               THen Saphathias sone of Mathan / 
Godolias sone of Phashur / Juchal
sone of Salamie / and Passhur sone of Malechy
the rulers / vnderstonding Jeremyes
sermōs spoken vnto the peple in this sence:
Thus saith the Lorde / who so euer shal
abyde styll in this cyte / shal dye ether wt
swerde / or honger / or pestelence. But whoso
go forthe vnto ye Caldes shal lyue & saue
thēselfe fynding their lyfe as a proye.
For thus sayd the Lorde. This cyte shalbe
geuen vp in to the handis of the kinge of
Babylon whiche shal take it. Wherfore
these rulers sayd vnto the kinge: let this
man be put to dethe we praye you. For by
this meanes he bothe slacketh the handis
of the soudyers and discourageth the men
now redy to fyght lefte in this cyte / & discorageth
al the peple whyle he precheth
siche maner sermons. For he nether seketh
peace for the peple but rather dethe.
Than answerde kinge Zedechias. Lo he
is in your handis / for your kinge may

not denye you any siche thinge. Then toke
they Jeremy & caste him into the dongē
of Malchy the sone of Hamalech whiche
before was in the fore entrye of ye preson.
And they lete downe Jeremy wt ropes into
a dongen wher was no water but myer.
And Jeremy was rolled & set faste in the
myer. And when Abdemeleche ye Ethyope / a
gelded man & offycer in ye kingis house
herde that they had caste Jeremy into this
doungen / he wente frō the kingis place &
spake to the kinge whiche then chaunced
to sit in iugemēt in Beniamyns gate / these
wordis: Lorde my kinge / it is not rightwysely
done yt these men haue done to Jeremy
ye Prophete in that they haue caste
him in to this dongen / for he shal storue in
this same place for honger / sith ther is no
brede lefte in ye cyte. Then the kinge bode
this Addemelech thethiope sayng: Take
we the frō hēce at thy plesure xxx. men / &
pluck vp the Prophete Jeremy from oute
of the dongen ere he dye. Then toke Abdemelech
these men with him / and wente to
Hamalechis house / where vnder an aumbry
he gote olde clowtis and raggis / and
lete them downe to Jeremy with cordis
into the dongen. And Abdemelech ye Ethiope
called to Jeremy bidding him put these

rotē clowtis vnder his arme holis betwene
the rope and his bodye. And Jeremy so
did / and then they lifted hem vp and drewe
him oute of the dongen / and then he abode
still in the fore entrye of the presone. Thā
sent kinge Zedechias and called the Prophete
Jeremy before him vnto the thyrde
warde whiche was by the house of ye Lorde.
And ye kinge sayd to Jeremy. I will aske
the a thinge / so yt thou hydest nothing
fro me. And Jeremy answerde Zedechias.
If I tel it the / thow wylt suerly slay me.
And if I geue ye coūsel / thou shalt not here
me. Then kinge Zedechias made an othe
secretly to Jeremy in these wordis. As verely
as the Lorde lyueth / euen he whiche
hathe made vs these soules: I swere that
I wyl not slaye the: nether wyl I delyuer
the into the handis of these men that thirste
for thy lyfe. Than sayd Jeremy vnto
Zedechas. Euē thus saith the lorde God
of powers ye God of Israel: If thou go forthe
at once with oute any stoppe yelding
thy selfe vnto the princes of the kinge of
Babylon: thou shalt saue thy lyfe: & this
cyte shal not be brente vp wt fyer / & thou
shalt be salfe wt al thy house. But if thou
wilt not fle to ye kinge of Babylons prynces:
this cyte shalbe geuen vp into ye handis

of ye Caldes which shal set fyer on it.
And thou thy selfe shalt not escape their
handis. Thā sayd Zedechias to Jeremy.
I fere these iwes which ar fled al redy to ye
Caldes lest I be betrayd into their hādis
and they laught me to scorne. Jeremy answerde / 
they shalnot betraye ye. Beleue (I
praye ye) the voice of the Lorde which I tell
the / & thou shalt be wel ynoughe and haue
thy lyfe. But if thou refusest vtterly to go
for the: euē this thing hathe ye Lorde shewed
me. Lo / al ye women lefte in ye kingis
house of Juda / shal go forthe to ye princes
of the kinge of Babylon: For they are persuaded
ye thou ar deceyued in yt thou trustest
so miche ye men whiche haue ruled the.
They / in whom thou didist put al thy truste / 
haue set thy fete faste in ye myer to leue
ye be hynde. Wherfore / al thy wyues with
their chyldern wyl fle to the Caldes: and
thou shalt not escape their handis. For
thou shalt be takē captyue in ye kīge of Babylons
hādis / & thy cyte brēt vp. Thē sayd
Zedechias vnto Jeremy. Let nomā knowe
these thingis / & thou shalt not dye. But
if ye rulers perceyue yt I haue comoned wt
ye / & so come to ye / sayng: Tell vs (we praye
the) what wordis thou haddist wt the kinge / 
hid nothing frō vs / & we wilnot slaye ye
                  
asking what the kinge sayd to the: thou
shalt answer thez: I made my supplicacion
vnto him / sithe I am thus caste awaye / prayng
the kinge that I might nomore be
ledde agen to Jonathas his house leste I
there dye: Then came the rulers to Jeremy
asking him / & he tolde them al as the king
had commanded him. Whom as sone as
he had thus answerde / they helde their peace.
For they knewe nothing of the mater.
Then abode Jeremy still in then trye of the
presone vntil ye same daye that Jerusalem
was taken. And al this was done whyle
Jerusalem was in beseging and taking.

Thus saith the Lorde of powrs ye god
of Israel. Beholde I shal bringe to passe
my purpose right sharpe suerly & nothing
plesaunt whiche I haue decreed vpon this

Vndowted I shal preserue the

a proye vnto thyselfe because thou doist
truste in me saithe the Lorde.
            
            
               
               
                  ¶The argument of the .xl. Chapiter.
                  This Chapi. with certayn other folowing
declare the miserable ende of the cite nowe taken
and the peple ouercome. For the vngraciouse
reamnant wer so tossed aboute and discorded
amonge them selues one betrayng a
nother: that the prophecy of Moses as the lorde
thretened them was now verifyed on thē / euen
this: That they shulde be ouercome and
led captyue into their enymes lande: he wolde
persecute them still with swerde.
               
               ¶The .xl. Chapiter.
               HOw the Lorde dealt withe Jeremy
aftir that Nabuzar Adan archeiftē
of the hoste had delyuerd him from
Ra
                     •
                  a / whither he had led him bownde
amōg al the other captynes of Jer
                     •
                  salem
and Juda. This Nabuzaradan called Jeremy
vnto him sayng. Thy Lorde God testifyed
fermely this same calamite to fal
vpon this place: wherfore the Lorde hath
brought it vpō them & fynesshed it accordīge
to his worde / because ye sinned agēst
the Lorde & obayed not his voyce: Wherfore
this mysery is chaunced vnto you.
               Now therfore / lo: I loose thy bondis whiche
ar now vpō thy handis: and if it please
the to go with me to Babylon / come: for
I wil chourisshe the & se thou wantest nothinge.
And if it lyke the not to go wt me:

me: abyde here stil. Beholde al this lande
is at thy plesure / dwel in it where it lyke
the best / and it lyke the not to dwela brode
alone: go dwel with Gedolias sone of
Ahicam sone of Saphan whom the kinge
of Babylon hath made gouerner ouer the
cite of Juda / and abyde with him amonge
the peple / or els wher so euer it please the.
And the archeiften of the hoste gaue him
mete and drinke and rewardis & lete him
go. Then wente Jeremy vnto Gedoliam
sone of Ahikā vnto Masphat / and dwelt
with him among the other peple lefte in
the lande. And when it came to the ears of
al the pety capitayns in Juda dispe
                     •
                  sed
with their felowes thorow the felds that
the kinge of Babylon had made Gedoliā
son of Ahikam ruler of the lande / and that
men women and chyldern with the pore
men of the lande whiche wer not led captyue
to Babylon / al shuld be vnder his
dominion: they came to Gedoliam in Masphat.
Ther came Ismael the sone of Nathanie / 
Johanna and Jonathan sonnes of
Care / Saraias son of Thanhumeth / and
the sonnes of Ephai the Netophathite / Zemeias
sone of Maachathi with their
felaws. And Gedolias sone of Ahikam
sone of Saphan swore both to them and

to their felows in this maner. Fere not to
serue the Caldes / dwel ye stil in this lande / and
serue the kinge of Babylon / & ye
shal prosper. For I meselfe lo / dwel in Masphat
to gouerne and be hed in the Caldeis
name to answere & to contente who so cometh
vnto vs. Go ye therfore and gather
your grapis to make wyne / gather yn
your whete / corne / and oyle / and lay it vp
in your garners / & dwel stil in your towns
whiche ye holde. Then al the Iwes being
among the Moabites and Ammonitis in
Idumea & in al these regions vnderstanding
that the kinge of Babylon had geuē
Gedoliā sone of Ahikam sone of Saphan
to be ruler of the reamnant left in Juda
retourned from euery place whither they
had fled before / and came into the lande
of Juda vnto Gedoliam in Masphat and
gatherd grapis and grete plently of corne.
Then came Johanna the sone of Caree
and al the pety capitayns dispersed thorow
the region vnto Gedolias in Masphat
sayng vnto him: knowst thou not
howe Baalis kinge of Ammon hath sent
Ismael sone of Nathany to slaye the? And
yet Gedolias beleued them not. And Johanna
sone of Lare sayd vnto Gedolias
preuyly in Masphat these wordis: Wilt

thou that I go and slaye Ismael sone of
Nathanie so yt none be aware of it? wherfore
shulde he slaye the and the Iwes also
whiche be gatherd vnto the / to scater thē
awaye and so the reste of Juda vtterly to
perysshe? And Gedolias sone of Ahikam
sayd vnto Johanna sone of Cart. Se thou
doist it not / for they be but lyes that ar
tolde of Ismael.
            
            
               ¶The .xli. Chapiter.
               IN the seuēth moneth came Ismael ye
sone of Nathanie sone of Elisame / whiche
was of the kingis blode wt
the gretest aboute the kinge & with x. mo
of their conspyred complices vnto Gedolias
sone of Ahikam in Masphat where
they sate downe to meate altogither. And
Ismael the sone of Nathany start vp with
his .x. conspyred complices that were wt
him / and smote Gedolias sone of Ahikam
sone of Saphan with his swerde. And so
slew they him whom ye king of Babylon
had made ruler of the lande. And Ismael
also slew al ye Iwes that were with Gedolias
in Masphat and the Chaldes ther
lefte to assiste him. And it came to passe yt
the nexte daye folowing the deth of Gedolias
whiche yet was kept secrete: ther
came certain men frome Sichem / frō Silo

and Samary .lxxx. in nowmber their
heads clipped / their clothes cutte al sadde
& kareful bringing giftes & sense in their
handis to offer them vp in the house of ye
Lorde. And Ismael the sone of Nathany
goyng forthe of Masphat met them comynge
a grete pase wepinge. And when
he met them / he sayd: Go your ways to
Gedoliam sone of Ahikā. And whē they
were comen into the mids of the cite: Ismael
sone of Nathany with his coniured
slew them by the middis of the dyke or lake.
And amōge these .lxxx. mē: there werten
that sayd to Ismael: slay vs not / for
we haue tresur in the fel
                     •
                  e / bothe whete / barley / 
oyle and honey. Then he spared
them / and slew them not with their brothern.
And the lake into whiche Ismael
threw the bodyes of the slayne whom he
slew for Gedolias sake / was ye same whiche
kinge Asa made for fere of Baase kinge
of Israel / ye same lake Ismael filled withe
the carkasis. And he led away captiue
al ye reste of ye peple / as the kinges daughters
wt al the peple lefte in Masphat: ouer
whom Nebuzaradan tharehieften had set
Gedolias ruler. And Ismael toke thē al &
went his waye to go to the Ammonitis.
Then Johanna the sone of Caree & al the

pety capitayns ouer the cōpany hering al
this mischiefe that Ismael had done / toke
al their company and wēt forthe to fight
with Ismael sone of Nathany / and fownde
him at ye waters of Rabim whiche arin
Gabaon. And when al the peple led captyue
with Ismael sawe Johan the sone of
Caree with al these pety capitayns and
their company / they wer glad. There
brought they agen al the peple that Ismael
had caryed frō Masphat / whiche retourned / 
came to Johan ye sone of Caree. But Ismael
escaped with .viii. of his cōiured frō
the face of Johan / & wente to thāmonitis.
Then Johan sone of Caree & al his capitayns / 
toke al this reste of the peple whō
they reskewed & toke from Ismael caried
fro Masphat aftir the dethe of Godolias / whiche
were men valeaūt in batail / their
wyues / chyldern and geldedmen whom
they brought agen from Gabaon / & went
& sate downe in Geruth Chimham which
place is by Bethlehē / entending so to goforthe
into Egypte for fere ef the Caldes / whom
they fered for this cause / that Ismael
had slayne Gedolias sone of Ahikā / whō
the kinge of Babylon had made ruler
and ouerseer of the lande.

               THen came al these gonerners / as
Johan sone of Caree / Jezanias sone
of Hosie & al the peple from the
leste to the moste sayng vnto Jeremy the
Prophete. Here our peticion (we beseche ye)
that is / pray for vs vnto thy Lorde God
for al this remnaunt here lefte of so many / 
which ar now very fewe (as thou
seist vs) that thy Lorde God wolde shew
vs what waye we mought go / and what

answerde. I haue he

                  de you effectuouly.
Lo / I shal pray vnto your Lorde God according
to your desyer. And what so euer
the Lorde answer you / I shal shew it you / hyding
nothinge from you. Then sayd
these men vnto Jeremy. The Lorde of trouthe
and faithe be our witnes / if we do not
aftir euery worde which thy Lorde God
shal answer concerninge vs / be it good
or yll. The voice of our Lorde God vnto
whom we sende the / we shal here: that we
mought prosper if we obaye the voyce of
our Lorde God. Aftir x. dayes the worde
of the Lorde came to Jeremy. And then he
called Johan the sone of Caree and al the
headis of the cōpany that wer with him / with
al the peple from ye leste vnto the moste
& tolde them. Thus spake ye Lorde God

of Israel vnto whō ye sente me to laye forth
your prayers before him. If ye wyl dwel
stil in this lande / I shal encrese you & not
destroye you / plante you / and not pluck / you
vp by the rotis. For I am wel apayed
and peased as towching the affliccion whiche
I decreed vpon you. Fere nomore the
kinge of Babylon / whom ye yet fere / and
nede not saith the Lorde. For I shalbe withe
you to saue and delyuer you from his

you & bringe you agen in to your owne
lande. But if ye wilnot set your myndis
at reste to dwel stil in this lande / not abaying
the voyce of your Lorde God / sayng
let vs not abyde here / but go into ye lande
of Egypte / where we shal se no warre nor
here of any pealis to batayl / nor suffer
any honger / ther let vs dwel. Wherfore
here the worde of the Lorde ye reamnant
of Juda. Thus spake the Lorde of powers
the God of Israel. If ye be ful bente to go
into Egypte / ther to be in exyle: it shal come
to passe that the swerde whiche ye now
fere shal ouer take you in Egypte: and the
honger that ye here fere / shal cleue vpon
you euen into Egypte / there to dye. For
as many as shal sette their faces fermely
bente thitherwarde there to case their

exyle or banishment / shal dye withe swerde
honger and pes
                     •
                  elence. Ther shal not
one of them escape the plage whiche I shal
bringe vpon them. For thus saith the lorde
of powers the God of Israel. Lyke as
my wrathe and furye did flowforthe vpon
the inhabitours of Jerusalem: euen so
shal it flowforthe ouer you if ye go into
Egypte. For ye shalbe an execracion / a
wondering stocke / detested / reuyled & in
obprobry to men / neuer more to se this lande
agene. It is the Lorde that biddeth you
(Oh reamnaunt of Juda) that ye go not
into Egypte / and that ye forget not what
he hath testifyed vnto you this daye. For
ye shulde trappe your owne selues. For ye
sent me to your Lorde God sayng. Praye
our Lorde God for vs: And what so ouer
our Lorde God answere / tel vs: and we
will do it. Nowe therfore haue I shewed
you the voyce of your Lorde God: for the
whiche thinge he hathe sente me vnto
you: and yet wil ye not obaye. Be ye suer
therfore to dye withe swerde / honger and
pestilence in that same place whiche delyte
you so gretely to fle vnto.

               ANd aftir that Jeremy had lefte preching
to al the peple / al these wordis

sent him to them: Azarias sone of Holy / &
Johan sone of Caree with al that heady
presumptuouse peple sayd vnto Jeremy.
Thou lyest vnto vs: nether hath our

we go not into Egypte to dwel there.
But Baruch the sone of Nery hath let the
slip among vs to betraye & delyuer vs into

captiue to Babylon there to slaye vs.
And this Johan ye sone of Caree with al
the captins of the hoste and al the peple / obayd
not ye lordis wordis that they shulde
dwel stil in the lande of Juda. Then toke
Johan sone of Caree & al the cheiftens

of Juda which wer nowe come to gither
agen from al the nacions amonge
whom they had benscatred / to dwel agene

lefte with Gedoliam sone of Ahikam sone
of Saphan: They toke also Jeremy ye Prophete

Pharos house in Thaphnis in ye sight of

saith the Lorde of powers the God of Israel.
Beholde I shal sende & cal hither Nebuchadrezar

& set his trone vpō these stones which
I haue hid / which shal bende his tente
ouer them. For he shal come and plage the
lande of Egypte: some with slaughter / some
with captiuite / & some with swerde: he
shal set fyer on the temples of the Goddis
of Egypte and burne them vp / and holde
their godis captiue. And ye lande of Egypt
aftir this shal clothe hirselfe as the herdeman
putteth on his clothes to get him
hence in peace. Also he shal alto breke the
pilers of the temple of the sonne in Egypt
and the temples of the Gods of Egypte / he

               THe sermon shewed vnto Jeremye / vpon
al the Jews yt dwelt in Egypt
in Migdalo / in Thaphna / in Memphi & in

the lande of patheres on this maner.
Thus saith the Lorde of powers the God
of Israel ye haue sene al ye miserable calamite
whiche I brought vpon Jerusalem
& vpon al the cytes of Juda how they be
desolate vnto this daye no man dwelling
in them / & that euen for their sinnes whiche
they committed prouoking my wrathe
whyle they wente and kindled their fyers
worshipping strange gods / whiche nether
they their selues knewe / nor yet you / nor
your fathers. Albeit yet I sent them al my
seruātis the Prophetis erly rysing continually
sendinge and mou
                     •
                  sshing in tyme
sayng. Se (I praye you) that ye committe
not this abominacion whiche I aborre so
gretely / and yet they obayd not / nor once
moued their ears to them / to go from their
myscheife nomore to kindle their fyers before
these strāge gods. Wherfore my hotte
indignacion & wrathe was kindled & burned
vp their cytes & feldis wt the stretis of
Jerusalem: and so were they made desolate
& forsaken as ye maye se euen this daye.
Now therfor saith ye Lorde of powers the
God of Israel. Wherfore do ye so grete wykednes
agenst your owne selues to spill
your men & womē soukelingis & infantis
of Juda / so that ye shal at laste leue none

a lyue while ye prouoke me to anger with
ye workis of your owne handis kindlinge
lyghtis vnto strange Gods in ye lande of
Egypte into whiche ye ar gone to dwel in
to be clene cut awaye / execrable / accursed
& ignominiouse among al ye naciōs of ye erthe.
Remember ye not ye synnes of your fathers?
ye synnes of ye kingis of Juda / & of
their wyues? your owne synnes & your
wyues? which ye cōmitted in ye lande of Juda
both in the felde & stretis of Jerusalem?
And yet be ye not sorye or humbled vnto
this daye / ye fere not / ye walke not in my
lawe and preceptis which I gaue bothe to
you / & your fathers. Werfore thus saith ye
Lorde of powers ye God of Israel Beholde
I am fermely decreod to scourge you & to
pluckup al Juda by ye rotes: & take ye reamnaunt
of Juda ye bente their faces so stifeneckedly
to enter into Egypt / ther to dwel
& take their plesures. And they shalbe al
wasted awaye / they shalbe al smyten downe
in ye lande of Egypt / & consumed with
swerde & honger. Frome the leste to ye gretest
shal they dye with swerde & honger.
They shalbe an execracion / aborred / wondred
at / curssed and into obprobrye. For I
shal so vyset thinhabitours of ye lande of
egypt / as I haue visited Jerusalem wt swerd

honger and pestelence / that of al the remnaunt
of Juda whiche went into Egypt
there to dwel / shalbe none lefte salfe to returne
into ye lande of Juda / although their
myndes was to come agene: yet shal ther
none returne but siche as shal fle & escape.
Then al these men whiche wer preuye to
their wyues sacryfiyng vnto strāge gods
and al the women ther present in the hole
multitude / and al the peple to / that ther
dwelled in Egypte in the cyte of patheres / answerd
Jeremy on this maner. The sermone
whiche thou madist vnto vs in the
name of the Lorde / in nomaner wyse wil
we receyue / but we wil do what so euer
goith forthe of owr owne mouthe / whether
it be sacrifising vnto the quene of heuen / 
or offering any other oblacion / lyke
as both we & our fathers haue done before
vs / as wel our kingis & rulers bothe
in the cytes of Juda / as wel with oute as
with in Jerusalem. For then had we plenty
of foode / then wer we happye and sawe
no plagis. But as sone as we ceassed frō
sacrificing to the quene of heuen & from
geuing hir gyftis: we were nedy of al
thingis & consumed with swerde & honger.
And laste of al: when we women did sacrifice
to ye quene of heuen geuing hir giftis:

did we then make hir kake brede housbandlesse / 
and offred to hir lyquet sacryfices
to prouoke hir to anger? Then sayd Jeremy
vnto al the peple / to men and women
and al the comens that answerd him on
this maner. Remembred not the Lorde / the
facrifices whiche ye offred in the cytes of
Juda and Jerusalem both with in & with
oute / bothe you and your fathers / bothe
your kingis and rulers and the peple of ye
lande? Did he not reuolue them in his minde?
And the Lorde coude suffer no lenger
your maliciouse thoughtis and abominaciōs
which ye committed. Was not your
lande therfore made desolate / forsaken &
so detestable that no man may dwel in it
vnto this daye? And euen for this cause / that
ye sacrificed and synned agenst the
Lorde / not obaing his voice yt ye mought
haue had walked in his lawe / his ordinā
                  cis / 
& testimonis / for these causes / I saye / these
afflicciōs & plages came vpon you / as
this daye wel witnesseth. Morouer Jeremy
added vnto al the peple and al the

Egypte. For thus saith the Lorde of powrs
the God of Israel / you & your wyues
haue spoken ye thinge with your mouthes

whiche ye haue accomplesshed with your

God lyueth. For I shalbe their watche mā
to scourge & not to defend thē yt they might
reste. And al Juda shalbe cōsumed whiche
is in ye lande of Egypte wt swerde & honger
tyl they be clene gone. And they yt shal
escape ye swerde shal returne from Egypte
vnto ye lande of Juda: but these shalbe very
fewe. And ye remnaūt of Juda comē into

shal knowe whose wordis abyde moste certayne

this for a tokē amōge you. That I wil vyset

the Lorde:Exode xv. For it is he verely / 
that is gloriously to be
magnifyed. Horse and man / hathe

He is the God of my fathers / & euen

Jehouah is his name: Pharaous chariettis
and hoste hathe he casten downe into

            His ioylye chosen capytayns ar drowned
in the redde sea / the depe waters haue
ouerwhelmed them / they sanke downe vnto
the botome lyke stones.
            Thy righthāde oh Lorde is grete & gloriouse
in strength: Thy righthande Lorde
hathe thrusted downe the enemye.
            To thy grete glory haste thou destroyed

thyne aduersaryes: thou sentst forthe thy
wrathe / & it consumed them lyke stobble.
            Withe the brethe of thyne anger ye waters
rāne togither on heapis: so that ye bare
botome was sene / the flowing flowd
stodevp as faste as a rocke. And the botō

folow and take them / I shal deuyde oute
the spoyle / and satisfye my plesure vpon
them / I shal draw out my swerde and my
hande shal slaye them.
            But thou didist but blowe with thy brethe / 
& the sea ranne ouer them: They sanke
down lyk led vnder ye vehemēt waters.
            Who emonge the goddis is lyke vnto ye
oh Lorde? Who maye be compared vnto
the in power and myght? who is lyke vnto
the in magnificence and holynes? who
is lyke the in reuerent fere / to be praysed
doing so wondreful miracles?
            Thou stretchedst forth thy righthande / and
the sea swelowed them yn.
            But in thy mercye hast thou ledde forthe
thy peple whom thou delyueredst: and
wt thy mighty power hast thou brought
them vnto thy holy habitacion.
            Whiche thing when the gentyles herde

panges fill vpon the Philistens.

with fear / trembling came vpō
the mighty Moabitis / and al the hertes
of thin habitours of Canaan melted for
fear and sanke a waye lyke water.
            Let anxt and fear fall vpon them thorow
the grete might of thyne arme / that
them be as still as stones whyle thy peple
passe thorowe / oh Lorde: whyle this peple
passe thorow / whom thou haste goten into
