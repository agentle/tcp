                     BEloved Brethren, publick and private ſalutations are Chriſtian duties impoſed upon all men by the holy Apoſtle S. Paul, the time or frequency thereof unlimited: Wherefore my ſelf, even now upon the putting forth of theſe my enſuing works, by that precept am taught, and do hereby ſend you a ſalutation, greeting you in the name of the Almighty, giving you thanks for the loving ſociety I have found and reſpectively enjoyed amongſt you, for fourty years paſt and more, till this preſent.
                  As alſo for your good likings and well approvings of

my former works and editions yet extant with you; namely, my Surgeons Mate and Viaticum, which now reviſed, I have here (with my other works) again publiſhed; which were by me penned in my love to you, for the uſe of the younger ſort of Surgeons, your ſervants; who when they had received their firſt rudiments from you as Apprentices; yet nevertheleſſe (as might be conceived) were wanting of ſome further helps for their proficiencies in Art, to the leading them on in knowledge; as namely, firſt to know the office and duties of a Surgeons Mate, which my ſelf firſt penned and publiſhed, for their inſtructions; and having therein propoſed unto them the method of a Surgeons Cheſt, and alſo opened to their view the compoſure and order of the firſt methodical Surgeons Cheſt, for their further incouragement in way of Art, I then gave them a help to the ſaid Surgeons Cheſt; namely, I publiſhed for them a Viaticum (a book ſo called) in Anno 1628. for their journeying, after which (as followeth) I have explained unto them ſuch other documents as may be preſumed that by their diligent endeavours and careful putting them in practice, they may in ſhort time become good proficients in military and domeſtick Surgery; men fit and able for the ſervice of his Majeſtie, and the Common-wealth, in their Science, upon all occaſions,
                  And moreover, for as much as that contagious and noyſome diſeaſe of the Plague hath of late yeares ſpread it ſelf into many parts of this Kingdome▪ which▪ though now ceaſed, may return at Gods pleaſure▪ none knoweth how ſoon; my ſelf, as ſome of you know, having in my younger daies lived in France, Germany, Polonia, and other forreign parts, for divers years together, where, for want of better and beneficial imployments. I was forced for my maintenance to follow the practice of the cure of the Plague: and having emboldened my ſelf thereby, ever as in an aſſured hope, that God who had called me to profeſſe the myſterie of healing, would

ſurely protect me therein; I perſiſted in my endeavors, and having kept my Papers of receipts and experiments together, which I made in the cure of that dreadfull diſeaſe, at my return for England I begun and practiſed in London the cure thereof; firſt, in the year of the great Plague at the firſt entrance of King James of bleſſed memorie, and left not the Citie when the diſeaſe was at the higheſt; neither then did I omit to viſit and cure any that deſired my help, and ever ſince in ſome ſort I have been helpful to the curing thereof: neither will I deſiſt from affording my medicine to the diſeaſed, whileſt God ſpares me life and ability. And further, I have here for future publick good, although by my own dear experience, ſearched into the ſupernatural and dreadful cauſes, ſymptomes, criſis, and cures thereof; the particulars of all which I have in one of the following Treatiſes publiſhed, to the help of my younger brethren; nothing doubting but that ſome of them will by their better educations and further experiences therein, furniſh the following Ages with better documents then my ſlenderneſſe can unfold: In the mean time, ſince that for this fourty years laſt paſt, no Surgeon of our Nation hath publiſhed any book of the true practice of Surgery, to benefit the younger ſort, theſe my mean Treatiſes onely excepted, I deſire you to accept of my good will inſtead of good deeds, at the leaſt not to reject it, till better comes in place by ſucceſſion of time.
                  And ſo not omitting the continuance of my good affection to all my brethren, the ſons and ſucceſſours of Aeſculapius profeſſed Surgeons, I commend you to the tuition of the moſt Higheſt, reſting ſtill yours in brotherly affection,

                  THE PREFACE.
                  
                     Benevolent Reader,
                  
                  
                     CHriftian dutie inciteth every man to extol Gods great mercies towards mankind, and namely, (which is the ſcope of this enſuing Treatiſe) for his bleſſing concerning the gift of healing, and for the originall or firſt finders out of the Science. In the arguing whereof, many ancient and modern Writers have taken great pains in ſearching out and deſcribing (for memories ſake) unto poſteritie, who were the firſt diſcoverers of that noble Science or Myſtery of the healing mans body; but not without ſeverall and different opinions, and ſtrong contradict
                        •
                     ons: Yet, giving venerable and due reſpect unto all, I will crave leave for my ſelf to think and believe that the originall foundation of Medicine proceeded from God alone; being more then ſufficiently explained ſo to be by Moſes that divine Hiſtoriographer, in his ſacred Hiſtory of the firſt creation of heaven and earth: For he witneſſeth that before man was created, all herbs and plants ſprang out of the bowels of the earth, with their infinite varieties of flowers and ſeeds, with different odours, ſapours, colours and forms, endued (no doubt) with many and great vertues, Solu
                           •
                         expraeſcientia Dei, onely of the fore-knowledge of God. Wherefore to attribute ſo great excellencies, ſo many wayes in uſe for the health and wel-being of mankind, to any other than to the divine bounty of God alone, would ſeem (in my apprehenſion) not much leſſe than blaſphemy; for it could never be, that humane reaſon could have found out the knowledge and vertues of theſe things, unleſſe God himſelf by his ſecret preſcience had ſhewed them to man.
                  For God, the Architector of the world, when in the beginning he created Adam, and inſpired him with the ſpirit of life, made him not onely a living creature, but alſo indued him with ſuch underſtanding, that he knew the natures, the forces, the proper faculties, virtues, and dangerous effects of al things which the ſaid univerſal world then contained or produced: ſo that the glory of the invention of the myſtery of healing of mans body, came from God himſelf, and may not be ſo much undervalued as to be aſcribed to humane ingenuitie. Yet nevertheleſſe (under favonr) we may ſo far venture to conceive, that theThe gift of healing is no leſſe then one of the gifts of the H. Ghoſt. ſame gift of God, namely the gift of healing, might by his holy Spirit be, and was tranſcendent ſucceſſively on thoſe whom he had preordained, and choſen unto the medicinall function, to the end that

they might be the better enabled to ſearch out and apply wholſome medicines in due ſeaſon, according as they were inſpired or taught; for all excellent knowledge commeth from above: and this opinion is alſo aſſented unto by holy Scriptures in ſundry places.
                  But withall, complying with our Anceſtors as much as may be, touching the firſt generall profeſſors of this art of Medicine; The moſt Writers affirm the Grecians were the firſt that tooke upon them to profeſſe the art of Medicine, and they likewiſe utter ſpeeches to the ſame effect, affirming Apollo to be the firſt Inventor of Medicine; and by Apollo, it is ſuggeſted, that they either underſtood the Sunne, which through the penetrating heat thereof, produceth, comforteth, tempereth and cheriſheth all creatures as well animall, and vegetable, as minerall: Or they meant, under that name of Apollo, ſome Noble man, who was inſtigated thereunto through an excellent and divine power (no doubt by Gods fore-knowledge) and alſo endued with learning and diligence in that noble art of Medicine, who performed ſome excellent cures: alluding whereunto, Ovid ſpeaketh thus of Apollo,
                     
                        Inventum medicinae meum eſt, opifexque per orbem,
                        Dicta est herbarum ſubiecta potentia nobis.
                     
                  
                  
                     Medicines Inventor and Artiſt I
                     Through the maſſie orbe am ſtil'd to be:
                     Fame this attributes to my Deity,
                     That force of Plants are ſubject unto me.
                  
                  And after Apollo the ſucceeding Inventor is ſaid to be Aeſculapius, which ome Writers ſtile to be his ſonne, brought up in learning by him, who did ſomewhat more ſet forth and poliſh this Art, being as then rude and ruſtick, and therefore he was reputed as one of the gods. Not long after thoſe times (as Writers report) did flouriſh Chyron, termed the Centaure, who alſo excelled in the knowledge of the medicinall plants.
                  This Aeſculapius (as other ancient Hiſtories witneſſe) had two ſonnes, viz. Podalyrius and Machaon, who followed their Fathers ſteps, and profeſſed the art of Medicine, and cured the wounded ſouldiers in the Trojan Wars; and theſe chiefly practiſed that part of healing which is now called Surgery. After them the knowledge of the art of Medicine grealy increaſed, though for a time it was in a hereditary way left by them to their poſteritie; and through their ſtudie and diligence was that part called Phyſick which cureth inward diſeaſes, alſo by a more prudent and diligent ſearch found out.
                  And further, authors witneſſe, that out of this moſt learned Aeſculapius his Stock, did ſpring Hippocrates, begot by Heraclida in the Ile of Ch
                           •
                        os, Prince of all the Phyſicians that ever were before him, who perfected the art or myſtery of Medicine or healing, and digeſted it into a method in the Greek tongue. And after him ſix hundred yeares followed Galen, a man not only exquiſite in the knowledge of Medicines,

but alſo in many other ſciences. And what was left in the writings of Hippocrates obſcure and intricate, Galen faithfully interpred and illuſtrated it, and put it into many Volumes, and eſtabliſhed univerſal precepts, and methodical rules, and reduced the Science into a more perfect Art.
                  And further, we read in Hiſtories, in the infancie of this art, that it was a cuſtome amongſt the Babylonians and Aſſyrians, who then were very ignorant in the art of healing, to appoint the ſick languiſhing people to be carried and laid in Porches and Galleries, or to carry them into the Market places and croſſe Streets, that paſſengers might counſell and exhort them to thoſe things, by which they might eſchue the like diſeaſes, or had known ſome to be recovered: and it was not lawfull for any one to paſſe by the ſick with ſilence, but he muſt utter ſome words of comfort at the leaſt.
                  
                     Strabo alſo (a Greek Writer) witneſſeth, that it was of old a cuſtome amongſt the Grecians for the ſick to betake themſelves unto the Epida
                           •
                        rian Temple of Aeſculapius, that ſleeping there, they might be admoniſhed by the gods in a dream what was good for their healths: and being freed from their diſeaſes, they cauſed thoſe remedies, by which they were recovered, to be written in Tables, and faſtned to the poſts of the Temple. Such was the zeal and ſuperſtitious blindneſs of the heathen people in former ages, and the ceremonies which they performed in a grateful remembrance for future times.
                  Alſo Hippocrates is reported to have copied out all thoſe things, and ſo from them firſt to have amended the medicinall art. And it is likewiſe by the ancients reported, that brute creatures have bin much conducible to the firſt finding out of ſome particulars in this art: ſo that man not only from man, but alſo from brute beaſts and birds, hath learned many good things, which by them have been demonſtrated, as namely, the vertues of divers herbs, by which they did preſerve themſelves from diſeaſes, through the mere inſtinct of nature, (as the blindneſs of the young Swallowes is ſaid to be removed by the herb Celedona, &c.)
                  Seeing therefore ſo great and ſo many good helps have concurred together to the perfection of this excellent art of Medicine, for the health and wel-being of mankind, who then needs to doubt thereof, or may ſay that it did not proceed, as from the beginning, de praeſcientia Dei? ſeeing that man, the moſt noble of all the creatures of God, and for whoſe ſake all other earthly creatures were created, receiveth ſuch unſpeakable comforts thereby: which cauſed Herophilus heretofore to term the medicinall Science to be the hand of God: for (ſaith he) as we having got a fall, do with our ſtretched-out hand endevour to free our ſelves out of that dirt or pit we were fallen into; even ſo we, being at the point of death by the aſſaults of ſickneſſe, do ſuccour our ſelves by the ſalutiferous remedies of good Medicines, and do thereby, as it were, draw our ſelves out of the jaws of death; ſo as Homer, the Prince of the Greek Poets, doth affirm in his verſes, that one good man that can heal well, is more worth then divers other men

ignorant in that art: for what perſon is, or can be more neceſſary, or more uſefull in any Common-wealth or place, then the expert Artiſt, skilfull in the divine ſcience of healing? which Science bringeth a man in favour with men of all degrees, yea, to be acceptable to Princes Kings and Emperors, being both profitable and commodious every where to Prince and people for the preſerving of health, and repelling of diſeaſes from them and their ſubjects, which alſo gaineth to himſelf honour and riches: for, as Hiſtories record, unto Hippocrates by King Abderas (for healing of Democritus his madneſſe) was given an extraordinary great reward; and moreover the heathen nation, men, women and children, gathered themſelves together, and in a triumphant manner proclaimed him (with aloud voice) to be the ſaving god, and honoured him with the name of Pater Patriae, the father of their Countrey. And the Athenians, becauſe he had freed Athens from the peſtilence, celebrated playes with triumphant pomp to his honour, placing on his head a crown of gold weighing a thouſand crownes, and honoured him with the great magnificence of a King; and likewiſe built him a ſtatue for a perpetuall eternizing of his wiſedome and learning.
                  It is alſo reported by ancient Writers, that one Eraſiſtratus, Ariſtotles nephew, received by a voluntary contriburion from King Ptolomie, an hundred talents of gold, as a reward, for that he reftored his ſonne to health from a deſperate diſeaſe: and likewiſe, that Auguſtus the Emperor appointed rich ſtatues to be ſet up to the honour of Antonius Muſa: and that one Quintus Stertinius received yearly for about 50. years together, out of the Emperors treaſury at Rome, twelve thouſand crowns for his great skill in the myſtery of healing: and that if any ſick perſon of ſort did call him out of the Citie for his advice, he did pay him 50. crownes a day for his skill. Moreover, it is ſaid, that for curing Pope Honorius the third, he every moneth received foure hundred crownes out of the Treaſurie of Rome.
                  
                  Ancient Hiſtories make mention, that in former times the moſt noble and honourable perſonages (yea, Kings and Princes) were greatly delighted in the ſtudy thereof, eſteeming themſelves much graced and dignified thereby; and thereupon, being greedy of getting renown, have given plants denominations from their own names, as Gentian from Gentins King of the Aſſyrians; Lyſimachia, an Engliſh water-willow, from Lyſimachus King of the Macedonians; the compoſition of Mithridate from Mithridates King of Pontus and Bythinia; the herb Achillea from Achilles; Centauri from Chyron the Centaure; Arthemaſia from Caria Queen pf Arthemaſia. And further, Writers do affirm, Attalus King of Pergamus, Solomon King of the Jewes, Evax King of the Arabians, and Iuba King of the Moores, with infinite more (too long to recite) did as it were burn with a deſire of learning the medicinall art, ſome in the herball part, others in the ſearching the vertues of drugs, others of minerals, and did alſo write and compoſe whole volumes in that Myſterie, for the benefit of poſteritie yet extant; wherein are contained infinite ſalutiferous Antidotes, by the

mixture of many ſimples into one medicine.
                  And whereas there hath been a queſtion amongſt ſome of the Ancients, by what name they may moſt properly call the Artiſt; the more learned ſort are juſtly ſtiled by the title of Phyſicians, and the more experienced ſort are called Chirurgions, or Surgeons; by means whereof, ſometimes there hath grown difference and offence, which I doe adviſe each diſcreet Surgeon to avoid, and that they give the Phyſician his due honour and precedence, compariſons being odious and unmannerly amongſt good men. Alſo the Artiſt of old, before the art was diſtinguiſhed, was called amongſt the Grecians Iatros, and amongſt the Latines, Medicus, and in our countries ancient language, by report, he was termed a Leech: and all thoſe denominations ſignifie no other thing but one and the ſame, viz. A curer of diſeaſes, ſickneſſes, wounds, apoſtmues, ulcers, &c.
                  
                  And whereas all men may judge ſuch infirmities cannnt be cured without fit inſtruments, which are firſt and chiefly by the hand of man, (who doth make ready fit medicaments and applications) to be adminiſtred to the foreſaid diſeaſes in due order and time: The firſt inſtrumental part of Medicine was, and is, that which both the ancient and later writers term Chirurgia, or the Handy part of healing.
                  The ſecond is Dieta: a ſpecial inſtrument to cure, without which neither wounds, apoſtumes, ulcerations, nor tumors againſt nature (as Hippocrates and Galen do affirm) can well be cured; for that diet muſt be preſcribed according to the temperature of the body, and nature of the wounded part: and Galen alſo preſcribeth a diet for thoſe that have ulcerations, whether cancrous or otherwiſe proceeding. Wherefore I conceive him to be no juſt and charitable Judge, that denieth this inſtrument, namely diet, to belong to a Chirurgion as well as to a Phyſician: for that reaſon and experience both do allow and approve thereof, as an unlimitable inſtrument, fine quibus eſſe nequit. And whereas Galen ſaith, in lib. 3. De methodo medendi, all arts are grounded upon experience and reaſon: if any one can declare, either by experience or reaſon, a way how to cure ulcers, tumors, wounds, fiſtulaes and other like diſeaſes incident to mans body, as the French Pox, the Plague &c. the cures of which diſeaſes by ſtatute Lawes are appointed to Surgeons, and to do it without the uſe of diet, and other both inward and outward helps, which theſe learned men (as Hippocrates and Galen) uſed, and have with no ſmall labour found out by reaſon and experience, then I will eaſily yield, and be glad to learn, and will not onely learn, but highly extol it: but if on the contrary, no man can ſhew me any other way to heal the former recited diſeaſes; then I ſee no juſt hinderance, but that each true Artiſt, being legally a Surgeon expert, may and ought freely to make uſe of diet to perform his cures.
                  The third general inſtrument uſed in the curing of diſeaſes, is Pharmacum, in Latine, Medicamentum, or Medicine, granted to be of ſeveral ſorts. Each man will conceive that medicine is a principal part of healing and curing of ſores, diſeaſes and ſickneſſes: for who is he that

can cure a wound, a tumor, an ulcer, yea, but an ague with his hand onely, without fitting medicines? Surely no man: Then it muſt neceſſarily follow, that Chyrurgia, Dieta, & Pharmacum, viz. Surgery Diet and Medicines (I mean both outward and inward) are unſeparable companions, and therefore all to be uſed in the
                        •
                      art of curing mans body; and that in the perſon of one man, and why not in the Surgeon that practiſeth in military occaſions, as in ſhips and camps more eſpecially? where neither his Majeſtie nor the Merchant alloweth Phyſicians nor Apothecaries any place, and there the whole ſcope of healing the bodies of the braveſt and moſt valiant warriours and hardie Sea-men, are upon all occaſions wholly referred to the skill of the Surgeon. Wherefore it were a very ungodly thing, and in reaſon moſt unjuſt, to forbid a Surgeon to learn all, or any thing that concerneth his calling: and all thoſe that are of opinion to hinder a Surgeon from uſing outward and inward medicines, have quite miſconſtrued Hippocrates and Gale

                        , ſhewing themſelv's enemies to art, reaſon, and true experience, for that it is manifeſt, each of theſe aforeſaid three branches of healing, do mightily further the other, to make the Surgeons cures perfect; for by theſe three together, and not by any one of them ſimp ly of it ſelf and alone, we may boldly conclude to have healed well and honeſtly, and as we ſhould do.
                  I have, I confeſs, too long inſiſted upon this argument, but the cauſe is, there be ſome at this day that do indeavor to ſever the inſtruments of healing aſunder, againſt the publick good, for their own private lucre, and would have inward medicine practiſed onely by themſelves, and confine the Surgeon onely to outward medicine, and outward healing, as one Tragus an ancient Writer maketh mention, affirming, that there were certain ſorts of men in his dayes which did uſe the art of curing ſeverally; namely, ſome by inward medicines onely, and ſome by outward, and ſome by diet onely, every one according to his education and profeſſion of curing: all theſe three contending, and each one affirming his way the beſt; in concluſion, their errours were confuted by Hippocrates, who gave to each of them (as learned Writers affirm) a patient to cure, whom all of them endeavouring to recover, failed in their performance: notwithſtanding, afterward by the wiſedome and skill of Hippocrates, they all were reconciled and united; for he, having well weighed and conſidered each of their weakneſſes and errours, willed them apart to ſet down how long time he, or they would take, to cure his or their appointed diſeaſed patients; whereupon he and the reſt agreed on a ſet time; which being expired, Hippocrates found that although each Artiſt had ſhewed his utmoſt skill, yet their patients were not accordingly cured. Hereupon he with much mildneſſe and kind perſwaſions (as is recorded) ſo appeaſed and inſtructed them, that each of them by the very ſame means and medicines they formerly took, being all uſed together to each party, quickly and perfectly cured their ſeverall patients. Whereby alſo it is manifeſt, that it is not juſt nor ſafe for the Common-wealth, neither can it be approved, that the beſt of the antient Fathers in Phyſick

and Surgery did, or indeed could divide or ſeparate theſe three parts of healing.

But as concerning worthy Artiſts, viz. Surgeons apprpoed by the Lawes of the Realme, they ought to be free to exerciſe their art▪ and the ſame Author concludes with Mr. Gales compariſon (who was a late good Writer in Surgery) which upon the like difference he then made of a Shipwright and a Carpenter, who were both of neceſſitie to uſe one and the ſame inſtruments to perform their ſeverall works withall: even ſo muſt every honeſt Artiſt, legally bred in the art of medicine, be tolerated to practiſe, by what title ſoever you pleaſe to call him. Then, if ſo, he muſt by conſequence have the free uſe of all ſuch inſtruments and means as may beſt and with moſt eaſe perfect what he intends, to wit, the cure of mans body: for although the Carpenter may ſay unto the Shipwright, Thou art not to uſe the a

For that all theſe tools appertain, and are proper to me for my art, and I cannot build without them; even ſo might the other make a like fair anſwer, and ſay, They are alſo as proper for my Art, and without them I cannot build. In like manner might the Joyner and other Tradeſmen ſay. And no leſſe may it be ſaid of the art of medicine: for whether he be called Phyſician, Surgeon or Le

Now here in all conſcience the Surgeon is to be admitted to ſhew his utmoſt skill for healing mens infirmities, without danger of any Law, if he be a man lawfully called as aforeſaid, to the exerciſe thereof: otherwiſe it were very unreaſonable that the Surgeon alone ſhould be preſſed out of the healing of his Majeſties ſubjects, where no Phyſician nor Apothecary is admitted to adviſe, aſſiſt or direct him, and yet to practiſe ſhould be held unlawfull for him, when he performeth his beſt in any action or part of healing for his patients good. But God be thanked, there are both ancient and modern good Laws, Orders and Ordinances, which do manifeſtly enable a Surgeon to exerciſe his ſcience, and to breed up ſervants to be expert therein, for the better continuance of the art, and for the future encreaſe of good and able Surgeons, for the ſervice of his Majeſtie, and the Common-wealth. And to manifeſt the ſame, his Highneſs not onely alloweth the uſe of inward and phyſical drugs and medicines to the Surgeons for his own ſervice, but is further gratiouſly pleaſed (out of his own Coffers) to pay for them, as elſewhere in this Treatiſe more at large will appear.
                  Thus much in generall by way of Preface. Now the Author in this following Treatiſe deſires to excuſe himſelf, by way of Apologie, to the Chirurgicall Reader, for his over▪forwardneſſe in the unfolding to the vulgar what he hath hereafter done by his explaining of a Surgeons Cheſt; which he never intended, untill (nolens v

Which credit and weightie charge, ſo neerly concerning the lives of their

ſervants repoſed in him, inſtigated him to imploy all his endeavours to anſwer their ſo great truſt impoſed on him: For the effecting whereof, hee had no way better to recompence them, then by reducing their Surgeons Cheſts, with all the particulars thereof, into an order and method, which was never undertaken before by any, although very requiſite: but being once done▪ it would not onely benefit them, but alſo be a perpetual good for the ſervice of his Majeſtie, and the Common-wealth:

And although it well might be conceived divers of them in knowledge otherwiſe exceeded him, yet nevertheleſs in the true uſe of new medicine, how good ſoever, which he had intruded upon them, not being within their owne former breeding and practice, he was obliged alſo to inſtruct them in the uſes and dangers incident by miſtakes, (fit to be foreſeene) and that by writing. As alſo he was further tied (for his owne reputation ſake) to performe the ſame in ſome methodicall and plaine way.
                  And becauſe untill that time no Writer (that he could poſſibly finde out) had ever handled or written any thing worthie of note of that ſubject, namely, of the methodicall compoſure of a militarie Surgeons Cheſt; he was put upon the toyle and ſtudie of new inventions, for the fit compoſure of medicines and inſtruments, and that without the helpe of Authours, yea, and without the help of the Surgeons themſelves, that were to uſe the ſaid Cheſts, who (eſpecially the more ignorant ſort of them) for their own private ends, and in part to cover their imperfections and abſurdities, forcibly withſtood him. Yet notwithſtanding all ſuch diſcouragements, after he perceived in himſelf any hope or abilitie of effecting the worke, he

proceeded on with courage, being confident of the goodneſſe and uſefulneſſe thereof, for the preſerving of mens lives and limbes; and would alſo in time to come prove profitable both

                     or the ſervice of his Maieſtie, and the whole Common-wealth, as at this day is manifeſt.
                  For this Work hath already turned the whole compoſure of the Surgeons Cheſt into its own forme and method, both plain and eaſie, being free from all exceptions of abſurd fraud or colluſion, and alſo free from the former obſcure, imperfect and ridiculous errours, and impertinent intruſions, whereby every unworthy ignorant impoſtor (as under a vizzard of hidden skill▪ made uſe of the art of Surgery, and thereby put up whatſoever they pleaſed into their Cheſts, under pr

                     tence of extraordinarie skill, great ſecrets, unvaluable, unſearchable, and not to be prized treaſures, (which long time they had concealed) but being ſearched into, appeared for the moſt part faulty, fraudulent, and full of poore blinde ignorance: whereby, as is ſaid, divers unskilful perſons intruded themſelves, not onely to be entertained into the Merchants beſt ſhips, but alſo into his Majeſties ſervice, yea, and that into his beſt ſhips, as great Surgeons, without either judgement, ſound medicines, or once viewing of any their proviſions, and without examining any their abilities in their callings; making their abbettors believe that thoſe which ſought to view their Surgeons Cheſts, came but to learn ſome of their (no) skill, or for ſome of their (leſſe) money at the faireſt.
                  Finally, though the worſt might ſeem never ſo commodious, yet not onely to ſuch as before are rehearſed, but even to Sea-Surgeons in generall, it ſeemed harſh and unreaſon

                     ble; and namely (wherein in part they were to be excuſed) for that their exceptions had a good ſhew of reaſon, in that they held it not fit that one Surgeon ſhould make ready a Cheſt for another Surgeon, and the abſent Surgeon not verſed in the practice of the things made and appointed for his uſe: and this was held not onely unjuſt, but ridiculous; and that juſtly, had not inſtructions, namely, the Surgeons Mate been written. And it hath ſince been obſerved (the inſtructions being put forth) that the ſame abſent Surgeons, after better informing themſelves (by the Authors direction ſet forth in Print) of the integritie and innocent way thereof, with the fairneſſe of the Worke alſo, and the utilitie of the ſaid Treatiſe, have commended it, and approved thereof: ſo that by a few yeares practice of the younger ſort of Surgeons, it is now brought into common uſe and generall good liking; ſo that it hath gotten credit, and it is with all Surgeons common in uſe, yea, even in his Majeſties ſervice, being firſt made uſe of in the Rochell Expedition, and the Author then having the charge of preſſing, furniſhing, and ordering of his Highneſſe whole Navic and Land ſervices, with Surgeons, and Surgeons Mates, with all their proviſions.
                  This preſent Work, being now the third Edition, as it were of the

method of the Surgeons Cheſt, the Authour entreats (as the former hath had) may receive a charitable Conſtruction upon the egreſſe thereof▪ and albeit the benevolent Reader no doubt) may ſee and apprehend divers e
                        •
                     rours and meane paſſages therein, (diſcovering thereby the Authours many weakneſſes) yet that he of his clemency would either amend them, or in love cover them, conſidering that Facilius eſt inventis addere, quam nova invenire.
                  
                  And further, if any Reader of his own calling, condemne or contemne him, for ſo farre explaining the hidden myſteries of the art to the Vulgar, ſaying, By your rules every young youth may proceed, not onely to furniſh, but alſo to make ſome uſe of a Surgeons Cheſt, though he never truely ſerved for it; The which the Authour will confeſſe to be an errour and weakneſſe in him, and therefore craveth pardon; but withall (for his defence) alledgeth, That he had an earneſt deſire by ſuch an errour to doe a publike good, not onely for the benefit of every worthy young Surgeon but chiefly, and indeed for the Common-weal, and ſafetie of the lives and limbs of many of his Maieſties loving ſubiects:

                        Quia non nobis ſolum nati ſumus:

                  Now, unleſs the Surgeons Cheſt had been reduced into a method, could one Surgeon at ſea well have ſucceeded another in the uſe of a practice unknown unto him? For by death all mens thoughts periſh, and ſo doth every mans private inventions and practiſes; and by conſequence, his death might have produced much dammage upon (otherwiſe) a hopefull deſigne, the want whereof many a worthie and valiant ſea-man, by lamentable experien
                        •
                     e hath felt, before the Surgeons Cheſt was thus digeſted; becauſe then every unworthie Surgeon (how weak, as is ſaid, or deficient ſoever) had power, if he pleaſed, to practiſe, to the diſhonour of God, the ſcandall of that moſt laudable Myſterie of healing, and the great danger of mens lives, procured by their ignorance and errour: for things known may be indged of, but unknown things ſtand by hazzard and chance:
Cognita judicio conſtant, incognita caſu.
                  
                  Likewiſe the explaining thereof hath not onely much enriched the Profeſſion of the Apothecaries, by undertaking the making, ſelling at their Shoppes, and tranſporting beyond the Seas, of many Chirurgeons Cheſts, for perſons (unknown to them) inhabiting in forreigne parts; but alſo enabled them at their pleaſures to have for ſale, and for his Maieſties ſervices, complete, (or in part) Chirurgeons Cheſts ever readi

                  And laſtly, it hath divers wayes brought advantage and good to the whole Societie of Surgeons; in ſo much that his Majeſtie, by the Lords of his Highneſſe moſt Honourable Privie Councell, hath taken notice thereof, and, obſerving the utilitie that it produceth to the Common-wealth for the ſaving of the lives and limbes of his Highneſſe ſubjects in time of Warre, hath been graciouſly pleaſed to allow a free benevolence, out of his Coffers, towards the ſame, for all ſhips imployed in his ſervice: which allowance was never granted before by any of his Highneſſe noble Progenitours, the Kings or Queens of England: the particulars and order of which allowances, more at large appear in the Preface of the Authours Viaticum herewith imprinted, unto which for brevitie, he referreth the Reader; hoping theſe his indeavours will be well accepted of the judicious and better diſpoſed ſort of Readers. As for the reſt he regardeth not: and the rather, for that he is haſting to the grave, where envie hath no power: And on the other ſide, hee is not ignorant, that a large broode of pregnant wits, fraughted with Jeeres, (and good ones as they terme them, ſuch as theſe times afford) will ſnarle, though themſelves either cannot, or (be it ſpoken in the beſt ſenſe) will not ſpare time from their pleaſures or profits to advantage others; yet are they ſo ſharpe of wit, and can ſo well diſpute, and ſo wiſely reaſon, that they will eaſily make

Their words ſeeming as Oracles to their own applauders, in whoſe Opinion they onely have the keyes of Art at their girdles. But to any ſuch, I ſay as one of the learned lately did to the like;

                  Some have already accuſed the Authour to have loſt time in writing of the Cures of divers diſeaſes, farre better written of by others. Which although he cannot deny, but that the accuſation is Juſt, yet anſwereth, That if each Surgeons Mate had experience, with a Librarie, and iudgement to uſe it, his labours were then in vain and idle: and to ſuch as have theſe helps, or that perfection, the Authour intends not theſe his labours; and to that partie in particular, he anſwereth, That if one wiſe man in former ages hath commended and well approved of another in writing

both of one and the ſame ſubject, he conceiveth it is as eaſie for one foole in this age to wink at anothers faults and weakneſſes, eſpecially in ſuch fooles as have neither wit nor will to write better. As for wiſe men they will judge like themſelves: but who can ſatisfie a fool? And ſo he concludes, with theſe following verſes, taken out of a German Writer, as a loving anſwer to all ſuch as ſhall hereafter find fault with his Book:

                     THE OFFICE AND DƲTIE OF THE SURGEONS MATE.
                  
                  
                     HAving an intent to ſet down Inſtructions for Surgeons Mates, out of my love to them, I thought it meet in a word or two to put them in mind alſo of their duties. The office & dutie of a Surgeons Mate, may (in my opinion) well be divided into three parts, whereof the firſt concerneth his dutie to God, who ſeeth not as man ſeeth, and who is the ſearcher of the heart, and knoweth mens thoughts long before, whom if he and I have the grace to honour with our whole hearts and fear, he wil direct our waies aright.
                  The ſecond dutie of the Surgeons Mate, is concerning the chief Surgeon, towards whom he muſt be carefull to behave himſelf wiſely, lovingly and diligently: and in many reſpects he is obliged to his▪ Mate as the wife to her husband; for he ought to be to him in every point readie to obey his reaſonable will, I mean onely in things concerning his calling, dutifull, diligent, willing, carefull, ſecret, and loving, yea, and to ſhew his love in covering his Mates weakneſs: he ought alſo to be gentle, and kind in ſpeech and actions towards all: pitifull to them that are diſeaſed, and diligent in miniſtring to them ſuch fitting remedies as he ſhall receive, or be directed to give from his Mate; but none without his order, for that his Mates order, I mean the Surgeons order, is his diſcharge or warrant, whatever happen: yet let

him privately lend his beſt adviſe to his Mate, the prime Surgeon, upon every needfull occaſion, kindly, ſubmiſſively and lovingly, ever as under correction; for if compariſons or oppoſition take place betwixt them, it is not onely dangerous to all the ſhips company, but alſo a diſgrace to themſelves, and a great ſcandal to their calling: for avoyding which, it is fit that the yonger obey the elder, and beware of the contrary, leſt it be repented too late. S. Paul adviſeth ſervants to obey froward Maſters, ſo I adviſe Surgeons Mates to do the like to froward Surgeons: for it ſheweth no excellent thing in a yong man to pleaſe an honeſt quiet man, but to live in love with an ambitious, or otherwiſe a froward vicious man, ſheweth wiſdom in the ſufferer. I would not ſo ſtand upon this point, but that my experience hath known too much the great harm that hath enſued by the diſſention of the Surgeon and his Mate in Iong voyages, the which with diſcretion and love might have bin prevented, if but one of them both had bin wiſe. The Surgeons Mate ought alſo daily to viſit the Cabins of men, to ſee who hath any ſickneſſe or imperfection: alſo to have ready againſt occaſion lint made, Plaiſters ſpred, splints armed, Needles prepared for ſtitching wounds, Rowlers and Boulſters, Dorſels, Tents, Buttons, Caps, Pledgents, Tape, rowling needles, and threed prepared, and each other needful thing for his calling, ready in their convenient places, fitted againſt occaſion be. Likewiſe his care muſt be to keep all the inſtruments of the Cheſt, and of his own Box, clean from ruſting, and to ſet his Lancets and Raſors as oft as need is. It may be he wil ſay to himſelf, it is a baſe office, belonging to meer Barbers and Grinders, I never gave any mind to it, &c. But let me friendly tell the Surgeons Mate, it is the credit of a yong Artiſt to take a vein ſmoothly and neatly, as alſo to ſhave well is praiſe-worthy: wherefore I wiſh him to practiſe to do it, and to be ever learning; for I am ſure he ſhall never know half he ought to know, though he do his beſt.
                  
                     
Thirdly, if he enter into conſideration wherefore he goeth to Sea, and hazzardeth his life. I ſuppoſe it is to gain, or he is unwiſe: if to gain, the chief gain he can intend, being a Mate, is knowledge in his calling. Then let him conſider wiſely how he may beſt apply himſelf to effect ſuch gains, namely by obſerving the whole paſſages of the diſeaſed people, conſidering both when they began to be ſick, as near as he can, the cauſes thereof, what hath been applied either inwardly or outwardly, what operation the medicine had, and ſo of every diſeaſed perſon, and every medicine given; and to keep a Journall in writing of the daily paſſages of the voyage in that kind, and that as well of the unſucceſſive applications, as of the ſucceſsive, he ſhall find great benefit in both: Likewiſe what alterations of operations he findeth in each medicine, and what medicines keep their force longeſt, and what periſh ſooneſt; alſo what varietie the climate cauſeth, of the Doſes as well of the laxative as opiate Medicines: I heartily wiſh each Surgeons Mate were carefull in theſe points. Another good way for him to learn is, to read much, I mean in Chyrurgery and Phyſick, and well to conſider and bear in mind what he reads, that as he hath need of the help of his Books, he may again find the thing he once read, which will turn much to his profit: for otherwiſe what uſe hath a man of reading, if he forget it preſently? If a Surgeons Mate ſpend his time wiſely in the premiſes, he may do good ſervice to God, his Countrie, and himſelf, and the benefit will be his, namely, Gods favour, preferment, credit and reputation in the world will be gained thereby, which will bring abundance of good things with it, which God grant for his mercie ſake. And were it not that I have intended this plain Treatiſe wholy to the Surgeons Mate, I would in a word or two put the young Sea-Surgeon himſelf in mind of his charge, by admoniſhing him of ſome errors too groſſe, which I have obſerved to have been committed by ſome, that he might avoid the like in himſelf.
                  
                     
The firſt errour ſome yong Surgeons are poſſeſt with, from which infinite others grow, is the want of the ſervice of God, the example whereof to their Mates is very infectious; and this bringeth with it a blaſpheming the name of the Almightie, a general deboiſt and baſe kind of habit on them, ready for all unprofitable, idle, and unſeemly actions, and unapt for to proſecute any good thing, either in their callings, or otherwiſe: and if they ſeem to be any thing, it is in boſting and brave phraſes, cenſuring other men in many things, but not perceiving their own wretchedneſs at all. Being given and dedicated to the Pot and tobacco-pipe in ſuch an unreaſonable meaſure, that thereby they become in themſelves baſe, deſpiſing vertue and commending vice; and to their Mates they ſhew themſelves moſt unkind, keeping that little knowledge they have from them, not inſtructing them at all in their Science, and holding them in more baſe ſubiection then their maſters ever did in their apprentiſhip. Alſo of a proud laſie diſpoſition commanding them (without due inſtructions) to do the whole buſineſs, when indeed themſelves ought to put their hands even to thoſe parts of Surgery which they eſteem baſeſt; for the moſt lamentable diſeaſes of poor men require the moſt care of the Surgeon, as for example, the ulcerations and ſlidings downof Ani or the Arſ-gut, which ſome in diſdaining to do their office of fomenting, comforting and reſtoring thereof to the due place, moſt inhumanely have cut it off, when with as good a conſcience they might have cut their Patients his throat: and the ſame I ſay to him that is negligent, and ſuffereth ſuch to periſh in their infirmities, without doing his utmoſt diligence. I could name ſome of the parties who have much diſgraced themſelves and the noble Science: but I will be charitable, hoping they will amend; and conclude with an old Grammer verſ, worthy the remembrance of al men;
Foelix quem faciunt aliena pericula cautum.

                  TO THE CHIRƲRGICALL READER.
                  
                     Loving Brethren,
                  
                  
                     IF you pleaſe to take notice thereof, within this Volume, you may eaſily diſcover the Surgeons Cheſt three times to be repeated; or rather three ſeverall proportions or explainings of a Surgeons Cheſt, or of Surgery proviſions for Military uſes: The firſt whereof puts the Reader onely in mind, by way of inference, of particular Medicines, Inſtruments, and other materials and needfull additaments, uſefull for a Surgeons Cheſt, for Sea or Land, to be provided with▪ as alſo ſuch neceſſaries as by the ſhip Barbers are fit to be had in readineſſe. In the ſecond view of the Surgery Cheſt, is deſcribed (and as it were ſet open to be viewed) a Cheſt fitted for a great Ship upon a long Voyage for Sea ſervice; as ſuppoſe for an Eaſt India Voyage. And wherein this ſecond is not ſufficiently explained, the firſt (if you pleaſe to repair unto it) ſhall give you further ſatisfaction. As for the third proportion, it is a Surgeons Cheſt epitomized, or a ſparing proportion, as ſuppoſe chiefly ordained for the curing of wounds either with Gun-ſhot or other caſualties, and accidents in his Majeſties ſervice for a Voyage on a ſudden, to ſerve upon or near our own Coaſt, where additions (if occaſion be) cannot be wanting in every Port Town. Unto all which proportions as each occaſion of uſe ſhall urge, relation may be had, in regard each one of them differ in many and divers reſpects from the other. In which my indeavours, if any of the more ſharp witted ſparks of the time, I mean any of my younger brethren, ſhall ſhew his greater skill, and ſay, I can yet adde many more needfull particulars, which the Author hath in his neſcience omitted; as an acute verball youth did not long ſince in my hearing, he not knowing me to be the Author: to whom I made a ſhort, though it may be not a reſpective anſwer, that a fool could doe as much. For who that hath wit, and is expert in Surgery, can be ignorant, that all medicines that Art hath ever deviſed or invented from the beginning of times for the health of mankind, or can any way be produced for the healing of the bodies of men, the ſame may be found uſefull in a Surgeons Cheſt; whether the medicine

be compoſed by a Chymicall, Methodicall, or Empericall Surgeon, and whether made of an Animall, Vegetable, or a Minerall ſubſtance, the Artiſt may doubtleſſe make good uſe thereof for Sea or Land ſervice in his Cheſt: but nevertheleſſe, the Author by way of introduction held it fitteſt for him to expreſſe partem pro toto, a part for the whole, (Nam verbum ſat ſapienti) leaving juſt libertie, with room ſufficient, for ſucceeding times to ſhew their inventions and excellencies, as alluding to the wiſe ſaying of Hippocrates in his firſt and ſecond Aphoriſmes, Vita brevis eſt: Mans life is ſhort, Ars long
                           •
                         eſt, Art is long. In which regard the diſcreet young Artiſt, that hath time enough before him, is hereby deſired to forbear his cenſure of the weak endeavours of the Author, untill he have effected a better of his own, and more uſefull in Surgery, for the Common-wealth.

I adviſe the Surgeons Mate not to be too forward, or too raſh, but to take good advice, namely, if the Patient may by any better way receive health, that he forbear inciſion, if not, let him proceed in the name of God. But note well, that this inſtrument is far leſſe uſed amongſt diſcreet Artiſts of our time,Inciſion by cauſtick medicines. then it was in former ages: for it was ever accuſtomed to be at hand for the opening of any Apoſtume ſuppurated, many of which now are farre more conveniently done by cauſtick medicines.

To conclude, one of each kinde may ſerve for one Cheſt, ſo they be ſharp and fitly grownd, and not too thinne edged.

In Germany it is a principall proof-piece of Maſter-ſhip in Surgerie, for a young man to take a baſe and ordinary knife, and to fit it to ſhave a beard; and alſo to make a Launcet himſelf which will enter ſmoothly: and it is a very great commendation in a young Artiſt to have ſharp and clean inſtruments of all ſorts, and to keep them ſo, and chiefly Raſours and Launcets; and it is as great a grace to young Artiſts to have good Raſours and Launcets, and the contrary may do great hurt. Wherefore I adviſe each young Artiſt to be practiſing often with the worſt of his knives and Launcets, till he be able to make them ſerviceable.
                     
                        Negligence blame-worthy. But I find that pride and ſlothfulneſs hath taken ſuch hold of many young Artiſts, that they diſdain and neglect the meaneſt parts of their calling, as things of too baſe account for them, which indeed are as behovefull often times as thoſe which ſeem of more conſequence. I ſhall never for my part account him a fit Sea-Surgeon, which cannot, or will not amend his Launcets and Raſours, which I hold to be an eſpeciall credit to him, and no leſſe advantage to his Patient. Thus much at this time of the uſe of the Raſour.

For we ſee daily many grievous Fractures healed without it, and many more would be if no ſuch inſtruments were; ſince the perfect uſe thereof is not every mans work, neither in every Fracture (as I have ſaid) needfull to be uſed, becauſe of many dangers attending the unskilfull or untimely uſeAn advertiſement whether the Trapan i

And further, if that the flux will not be ftaied by an ordinary kind of reſtrictive, then take the ſtronger reſtrictive powder which in due place is to be mentioned.

I have my ſelf with a ſhort carving knife twiſe made as good a ſhift as if I had had a Trapan ready, and thereby cured two dangerous fractures, by cutting as much of the Cranium away, as that the contuſed blood had only vent. The Germane Surgeons uſe no Trapan, that ever I could ſee in my eight years living among them, though they both ſpeak and write of it.

Moreover, many are very weak and unfit to hold in their bodies any ſuch medicine, except you with ſome tow, clout, or the like, wil hold it in, they can take no benefit by a Gliſter: wherefore in ſuch a caſe, you muſt be ful of humanity and Chriſtian commiſeration; not to be fine fingered, ſqueamiſh, or diſdainful, but conſider your brother by your ſelf. Concerning the ſubſtance of a Gliſter, the quantity to be given, and other neceſſary obſervations, of that kind, in the Chapters of the cure of the Flix and Scurvy I have written; to which place I refer the well diſpoſed Surgeons Mate: & look what for brevities ſake I have omitted, the young practitioner muſt as I have done before him, either by reading, inquiring, or practiſing, and ſometimes even by erring finde it out: and if he know more then my ſelf, thank God for it, and let him impart ſome to others, and not ſcorn this; for to ſuch I write it not, but to the young and willing learner. Some may marvel, I multiply ſo many words concerning the Glister Siringe, and forget to mention the Gliſter bag and Pipe, ſoThis Siringe is preferred before the Gliſter B

To which I anſwer; this work is cleanlier for the Surgeon, eaſier for the Patient, and may be delivered with greater of leſſer force, as the Artiſt pleaſeth; and this inſtrument will laſt when the other will ſtink and putrifie: and yet I deny not the other to be good, but not to be truſted to at Sea.
                     Thus much of the Gliſter Siringe.
                     
                  
                  
                     Of the ſmall Siringe.
                     IT might ſeem a thing vain to mention inſtructions herein: for what Barbers boy is not practiſed in the uſe of the ſmall Siringe? Truely few, and yet many Maſters to my knowledge erre groſſely in the true

Firſt therefore obſerve that when you uſe a Siringe, let it be clean; that it be ſmooth at the end for galling; that it be even armed with tow; that it go not by jumps nor too ſtiff; & that you carry a ſteady & even hand in delivering it, & force it not over ſtrongly, except upon great reaſon. And if the grief be in the paſſage of the yard, as in caſe of Gonorrea, oftentimes there are excoriations, then in the putting in the Siringe it is needful to reſt thy arms in the delivery thereof on the Patient his thighes, he ſitting ſomewhat high, or ſtanding bowing forwards, andHow to uſe this Siringe in the yard. ſtrive not to fill the Siringe too full at once, for then thou canſt not eaſily and ſteadily reach it to deliver it: and the firſt time thou preſenteſt it thou mayeſt if thou pleaſe make ſhort work, and deliver it betwixt glans and praeputium, that is, betwixt the skin and the head of the yard, holding the forepart of the praeputium cloſe together, if it may be held together, which ſerveth only to waſh without the paſſage. The ſecond timeHow to deliver an Injection. deliver into the paſſage ſo far as well thou canſt reach; namely, to the end of the Pipe, if without great pain thou canſt effect it, reſting thy arms, at it is ſaid, and holding with the one hand the yard (as it were) in the midſt thereof or behind the former part of the pipe of the Siring; namely, not meerly to the head of the yard, nor ſtraining nor preſſing thy hand too hard, only that the water injected may be kept in; for by that holding of the left hand cloſe, the water being artificially put in, wil come to the neck of the bladder; which done keep it ſo in till thy Siringe being drawn out, can be filled once again, and deliver it as the other was, without removing the hand that holdeth; & that ſecond time, the water will come into a bladder; and obſerving duely this form of injection, thou ſhalt caſt in as much water as thou pleaſe into the bladderErrors in injecting manifeſted. without pain, with onely an ordinary Siringe; whereas caſting it in and holding the praeputium cloſe as is uſual, aſſure thy ſelf the water will never come at the neck of the bladder, nor further then the pipe is put in; whereas often the defect is in the neck of the bladder, and thy medicine cometh not there. Alſo, let not thy medicine be too hot which thou injecteſt, for that is dangerous, and cold is alſo bad; ſo hot as piſſe isMercurial injections to be rejected. the true temper, or a little warmer. Beware alſo of Mercurial lotions, I mean any which have Mercury ſublimate, precipitate, or otherwiſe prepared in them, for though they have good qualities, yet they are (uponThe evils the caſe. my knowledg and experience) dangerous, uſed by way of injection into the yard; for they wil utterly alter and overthrow the natural faculty of the yard, and will offend the erection of Virga, and ſo calcine the ſame, that it ſhall become impotent to his natural work, I know it, and yet they may be with good ſucceſſe uſed in curing malignant ulcers twixt glans & praeputium, or elſe-where upon the yard, as daily uſe of them declareth. Concerning Lotions or Injections, they ſhall, God willing, in another place be mentioned. Alſo, concerning the general uſes ofInjections not proper onely to the yard. The neceſſity of the Siringe. the Siringe, they are not alone limited to Virga or the yard, nor to venereal cauſes onely; but they are alſo of eſpecial good uſe in wounds, ulcers & fiſtulaes; as alſo for griefs in the mouth and throat, and may not therefore be omitted in the Surgeons Cheſt: wherefore I

                     Of the Catheter, together with wax lights to ſearch the conduit of the bladder.
                     
                        The uſe. THe Catheter may well be numbred one amongſt the needfull inſtruments in the Surgeons Cheſt; for if obſtructions happen, either in the paſſage of the urine, or neck of the bladder, through ſlime, gravell, the ſtone, or like accident, which by the artificiall uſe of a ſiringe cannot be removed, then is this needfull inſtrument to be uſed, as alſo to make ſearch for the ſtone in the bladder.
                     
                        How to uſe it. If therefore there be occaſion to uſe it, put it in gently as followeth, namely with the crooked or dependent part thereof downward, ſo farre as it will be put in, being firſt anointed with a little oyle of Almonds, or ſome freſh greaſe, or oyle for want of the firſt rehearſed; and being put in as farre as you can without much force, then feele by the roote of the yard neare the fundament with thy fore finger, anointed with butter or oyle (or the middle finger of the other hand) where the end of the Catheter reſteth or beareth out, then put in the Catheter yet further towards the fundament, preſſing or bearing down, as it were, a little the lower part of the ſaid inſtrument with thy upper hand which ſtayeth the Catheter, then (together with the help of the lower finger of the other hand) turn the Catheter upwards, putting it alſo withall forward a little, and it will ſlip into the bladder; then draw out the inner wyer, and the urine will come forth, ſtill keeping the inſtrument carefully within the bladder till all be runne out that gently will come without forcing. Moreover, you may by putting in the firſt or longeſt finger into

                        The uſe. THe ſearching candle is chiefly to be uſed when there is a caruncle or ulceration in the necke of the bladder, or paſſage of the urine, and then it is uſed both to finde out the place where the ſaid grief is, and alſo to bring apt medicines to the place grieved; but that work requireth good deliberation well to effect it: for an expert workman may eaſily erre herein, except he take good regard. Wherefore when by the candle you haveThe right end of the candle is to find out the grieved place, and right paſſage thereunto. found the certaine place of the griefe, which is commonly done by the ſtoppes or ſtayes which the ſaid candle findeth in the paſſage, bee carefull to obſerve the juſt length to the further end of the ſaid ſtoppe or place agrieved, and there if you marke your candle well, you ſhall by the ſame perceive the full length and breadth of the diſeaſe: then upon the ſaid light or candle, faſten your medicine which you intend to heale theThe time when the medicine is to be applied. griefe with; as namely, if the diſeaſe be a kinde of ſpungie fleſh, as often

Thus much for this time concerning the Catheter and ſearching candles.
                     Theſe former recited inſtruments may be placed on the Cheſt-lid, except the Gliſter pot. Their neceſſarie uſes being brieflie touched, it reſts now to ſpeake next of certain other Chirurgicall inſtruments and neceſſaries pertaining to Chirurgerie.

                     Of the Plaiſter-box, and what belongeth thereto: And firſt of the Emplaisters.
                     THe Plaiſter-box ought to contain, at the leaſt, three kindes of ſeverall Emplaiſters: as namely,
                     
                        What Emplaiſters the Plaiſter-box ſhould have at all times readie. Emplast.

                     For want of Diachalcitheos, Emplast. De minio may ſerve.
                     The uſes of the Inſtruments due to the Plaiſter-box follow next, and are theſe,
                     
                        Speculum linguae.
                        Flegme.

                        Forceps.
                        
                           
Spatula.
                        Probes.
                        Stitching needles and quill.
                        Launcet.
                        Barras pipe.

                        Uvula ſpoon.
                     
                     There belongeth to the Surgeons Mate a carefull and eſpeciall reſpect to be had concerning Sciſſers; namely, that he have at the leaſt two pair of good Sciſſers for to cut hair, that they be well grownd, and keptSurgeons ignorant of the true uſe and keeping Sciſſers and plaiſter-box, unworthy name and place. clean; as alſo in his plaiſter-box one pair, and that they be at all times kept well. The manner of uſing them were loſt labour to be taught any Surgeons Mate: for if he be therein unskilful, he is unworthy of his place. Wherefore I onely recite them for remembrance ſake, and likewiſe for order, having already ſpoken ſomewhat of the ſeveral uſes of each one of the recited inſtruments.
                  
                  
                     Of the Forceps.
                     
                        The uſe, THe Forceps are onely uſed to take off medicines from diſeaſes, or ſometimes to take out a ſpill, a hair, or a looſe bone, or ought elſe which is offenſive, from a wound, or to draw out ought that may by chance come into the ear, noſtrils, the mouth, or throat, to the danger of the Patient. Wherefore it is an inſtrument of continual uſe, and hath many offices in Chirurgery.
                  
                  
                     Of the Spatula.
                     THe uſe or abuſe of the Spatula, as it hath his office to take out an unguent and ſpread it on lint, can do no offence to the Patient greatly. Wherefore I will pretermit to loſe time in declaring ought thereof.
                  
                  
                     Of the Probe.
                     
                        The uſe. THe Probe hath already been mentioned in another place; but the ſmall Probe, being a neceſſary meerly belonging to the plaiſter box, ſerveth not onely for the aforeſaid uſes, but alſo to cleanſe wounds, ulcers, fiſtulaes, &c. and is a very neceſſary inſtrument which cannot wellThe abuſe of this Inſtrument. be miſſed: but there is much abuſe of this inſtrument oftentimes by making probation (as the phraſe is;) for ſome, to ſhew a wound deep, having gotten once within the cutis, will, by thruſting it ſometimes betwixt the coats of the muſcles, ſometimes otherwiſe, ignorantly either indangerNote. the part, and thereby occaſion evil accidents to follow, or otherwiſe break the coat of a veine or artery, to the overthrow of the patient, or his great hazzard.
                  
                  
                     
                     Of the ſtitching quill, and ſtitching needles.
                     THe ſtitching quill, and ſtitching needles, have their due place in the plaiſter box: wherefore that they may be the more ready on a ſuddain, as occaſion is offered, forget not to have at the leaſt three readyHow many needles needful Of what ſiezes. Inſtructions for ſtitching. needles well armed and pointed of ſeveral ſiezes, I mean threded with ſtrong coloured ſilk, well waxed: and when you ſtitch, beware you draw not the orifice awry, oblique or deformed, but that you have great reſpect to the true beauty and former comlineſſe of the wounded part, neither let your ſtitches be too near one unto another, neither tie your ſilk too cloſe, which will occaſion the ſtitches to break before their time; for nature will not be forced. Alſo when you would ſtitch a wound, let the hole of your ſtitching quill not be forgotten to be ſet to the one ſide of the lips or ſides of the wound which you intend to pierce, ſo that it may give a ſtay to the part when it is to be pierced through with the needle; and it muſt be juſt ſo placed, that the needle piercing through the wound, may alſo come within the ſaid hole; which drawn through, take away your quill, and ſet it ſo to the other ſide. Sometimes alſo it happeneth in ſtitching the ſides, that the ſides of the wound lie ſo near each to the other, that both ſides may at one time be taken up without drawing out the needle at all: in ſuch a caſe the ſtitcing quill mentioned is not to be removed from▪ the firſt place. A double coloured ſilk is beſt to ſtitch with, being waxed, next that, thred will ſerve. It is alſo convenient to wax the thred or ſilk, or to uſe ſome emplaiſter to rub it with in place of wax. Note alſo, that rolling needles be put into the ſaid ſtitching quill to be ready: alſo thred to ſow rolles together for making the readier and more convenient Ligature in wounds and ulcers, as occaſion is. There is alſo a form of dry ſtitching of new wounds, which at this time I omit for brevities ſake. Thus much of the ſtitching quill, and ſtitching needles.
                  
                  
                     Of the Launcet.
                     ALthough at the firſt it might be imagined that little were to be ſpoken to the Surgeons Mate concerning the Launcet, for without queſtion each Surgeons Mate knoweth a Launcet as well as my ſelf; yet when I conſider the weakneſſe of young men concerning the true uſe, and the abuſes of the ſame, and that I call to mind how many good men daily hazzard, if not loſe their lives by the undiſcreet uſe thereof▪ I am at a pauſe with my ſelf, to conſider in theſe few lines I have to write, what I might ſay for to furniſh the Surgeons Mate with beſt and moſt needfulInſtructions concerning the Launcet. admonitions in feweſt words. Firſt therefore, methinks, it is not amiſſe to adviſe him, that he carry with him at the leaſt ſix of the beſt ſort, beſides ſix more common ones, for an eaſt Indie voyage: that he oyl them, or anoint then with Axungie, and ſo wrap them in oylie clouts, that they ruſt not: and that he onely bring forth into the aire one at once. Alſo that he have ready convenient bands to tie the arme; a

band made of woſted gartering is the beſt, or of a ſtrong fine liſt; for allConcerning blood-letting neceſſary admonitions. bands made of ſilk or linnen, will ſlide back. Let him remember alſo that he tie not two knots upon the band, for that requireth too much trouble in giving the veine vent: if he uſe a wollen band, one ſliding boe-knot will ſerve, which is eaſie to be looſned or faſtened, where you would cauſe it to bleed more or leſſe. Note alſo, that the band be turned twice about the arme ere you tie it: alſo that this knot lie aloft on the top of the arme, and on the outſide of the elbow, and not too near the joynt or the place where the veine is to be opened: that he never open a veine but firſt he have ready a band and bolſter to make it up again: thatOf the Launces points. Of the veine opened. his launcets be not too ſpear pointed, I mean ſmall pointed: for the broadeſt pointed Launcets make the beſt work: likewiſe that orifice be large, not deep, yet not overlarge, for it is overlarge when the blood tumbleth out without a ſtream, for that ſpendeth too much the ſpirits, and it is alſo too narrow when the ſtream is ſmall, and the veine is puffed up with wind. Note alſo, that if your Patient incline to faintneſſeOf faintniſſe in blood-letting with a remedy. or ſwounding, you cauſe him betimes to thruſt his longeſt finger of the other hand into his throat, and a little provoke himſelf to caſting, it helpeth preſently; let him reiterate the ſame work if occaſion be.

I have ſeen the like once done by an ignorant blood-letter: wherefore remember it, but rather bend him with one arme forewards, and with your other hand ſtop very cloſe his mouth and noſtrels, and in very ſhort time you ſhall perceive wind to come, and it will gather to his mouth, and he will ſtrive for breath, then let go your hand, and all is well; and as often as he fainteth do ſo. This is a ſafe courſe, which with good ſucceſſe I have uſed from my youth to this day.
                     
                        The quantity of blood to be taken away at ſea. Further note, that at ſea, eſpecially where freſh food or good nouriſhment is not at hand, it is good to be ſparing in the quantity of blood to be taken away, and rather often take blood away, then too much at once, except blood abound too much; which is not eaſily judged by every young Artiſt. For ſometimes the party is idle-headed by diſtemper of the blood, which by cooling broths and julips ought rather to be tempered; providing alſo, that he have the benefit of nature, I mean a looſe body,Remedies for idleneſſe in the head through diſtemperature of blood. Phlebotomie not ealwayes to be uſed. or be provoked thereto by art; and by this means rather ſeek to cure, then by raſh Pplebotomy; for you muſt conſider that in the blood conſiſteth the life of man: wherefore, be not raſh in that work; and as is ſaid, hold ever this rule, that if the Patient neither on the day thou wouldeſt open a vain, nor on the day before we have had a ſtoole, that thou attempt not to let him blood before firſt he hath had one ſtoole procuredObſerve well. Of the vains to be opened. him at the leaſt, if not more; which is ſooneſt and ſafeſt done by a ſuppoſitory: the next ſafeſt and better way is by a gliſter. The veines commonly opened are ſix in number; namely, one in the forehead, one under the tongue, three in the arm, and one in the foot: The three in the arm are moſt in uſe, whoſe names are Cephalica the uppermoſt, or head vain, ſo called of the Greek word Cephale, which ſignifieth a head, and

is commonly opened in all griefs of the head where it can be taken, in want whereof, it is almoſt as good to take the middle veine.
                     The next is the median or the middle veine, it is the ſecond principall vein, which is generally taken as indifferent for the whole body.
                     
                        Aſpecial obſervation concerning the liver vein. The third is the Baſilica, or the liver vein, being the loweſt in the arm, and more reſpecteth the liver then the two former. But hold this general rule, that if thou intend the opening of a vein to help the liver, and that the liver vein will not be well taken, then take the median vein; for thou muſt know that all veins have their original in the liver. Some arms have but one fair vein appearing; then it followeth of neceſſity, thou muſt take that: for many learned Phyſicians are of opinion, that generally the fulleſt vein in the arm is beſt and fitteſt to be taken, except ſome ſpecial cauſe alter their minds: for their words are often quae majus turget, majus urget, which may be engliſhed, the vein which ſheweth moſt, is moſt faulty.

THis Inſtrument thus named, doubtleſſe was by a Surgeon borrowed at firſt from ſome Gold or Silver-ſmith, and never paid him again; for the Gold ſmiths uſe it daily, and cannot perform their works without a Burras Pipe, but the Surgeons make other uſe thereof, (namely, for the moſt part) to retain corroding powders in, as Vitrioll, burnt Allom praecipitate; and ſuch other cauſtick medicines, which well uſed perform very much in healing; So alſo their abuſe bringethThe danger of the abuſe of it. ſhame to the Artiſt, and often unrecoverable damage to the Patient.

But I would adviſe the Surgeons Mate not to uſe any corroding medicine at all in new or freſh wounds, but

let the fleſh grow as proud as it will, the ground being clear from whence it groweth, namely, if it be from a wound wherein is no putrified bones, and if ſo be that the wound be full of fleſh, and then will not cicatrize, a little burned Allom or Vitrioll, will doe well, and then to your former dreſsing again, remembring that each third or fourth dreſsing be merely drie lint, you ſhall find good therein; and if you onely take lint and wet it in a Coperas water, and let it dry again, and lay that lint drie upon the proud fleſh, ſometimes for a dreſsing or two, and then againe to your former method, doubt not but it will without pain verie well cicatrize any new wound: I write this, for that by the unskillfulneſs, yea,Surgeons wilfulneſs as well as unskilfulnes blame-worthy. and ſometimes by the idleneſs of evill minded and baſe Empericks, I have ſeen men lamed by the needleſs uſe of cauſtick medicines, even in ſlight wounds; to which, if an old wife had openly applied her one ſalve for all ſores, no ſuch thing had happened: yet I am not ſo ſimple to denie the juſt uſe of ſuch noble medicines in wounds, ulcers, and fiſtulaes, or otherwiſe where need is; but I onely here adviſe the young Artiſt,Note. that he may not be too raſh in the uſe of them, and likewiſe doe adviſe him, that having uſed them once, he firſt pauſe again at the leaſt eight dayes, namely, till the firſt Esker be fallen, and certain daies after, ere he uſe any cauſtick powder again; for with the uſe of corroding medicines,Two evils to be avoided. one immediately after another, many Ulcers are made more painfull and rebellious then they were, and the bones ſometimes made foule which were otherwiſe clean; which fault is too frequent now adaies: and amongſt many groſſe faults daily committed by unexpert Empericks, this one is to be lamented, namely, the uſe of keeping open penetrating wounds too forcibly and too long by the uſe of hard tents, armed with cauſtick powders, whereby nature can make no true unition, but is forced into much diſorder; which I wiſh young men to make a conſcience of, and to be carefull not to erre in that kind.

                     Thus much of thoſe neceſſaries which properly deſerve the names of inſtruments in the Surgeons Cheſt. Now a word or two of ſuch other Appendixes, which in their kind are as neceſſarie as the former.
                  
                  
                     
                     The Cupping-glaſſes or Ventoſes.
                     
                        The uſe is divers. THere are many neceſſarie works in Surgery performed by Cupping-glaſſes, namely, ſometimes they are uſed to ſet upon a Bubo or botch to bring it forward, and therein they are very good. Sometimes alſo to ſet in the nodell, and on the upper part of the ſhoulder-blades, to draw back humours which oppreſſe the head, the eyes, or teeth: or againſt Lethargie, or on the thighes againſt aches or pains there; or for the cure of the Sciatica, they are very good; or ſometimes to draw bloud and ſpirits toThe end why they are ſet without ſcarifying. Why with ſcarifying. a member withered or benummed: in all theſe and divers more griefs the Cupping-glaſſes are very needfull. Sometimes alſo they are ſet without ſcarifying onely to attract humours to the place. Another time (it may be) in other caſes they are uſed with ſcarifying, to take away bloud and choler, which offendeth the part▪ Some ſet them on withThe divers ſetting of them.

Hold your Cupping-glaſses over the flame a little, and then clap it quickly on the place whileſt yet the ſteame of the light is in it, and it will be faſt, and draw hard; but you muſt have your Cups fit, and not too wide for the place you would ſet them on, or elſe they will not take any hold. Further, when you perceive they have drawn well, which by the blackneſs and riſing of the skin you may ſaſilyScarification muſt be light, and ſudden, and with a Lanncet. ſee, then (if you hold it fitting) you may lightly and quickly ſcarifie it with a fine Launcet, which truely is the beſt and profitableſt inſtrument for that uſe; and then wetting your Cupping-glaſses againe, with the flame onely of the candle, ſet them on where they ſtood before, ſettingWhen to take the cupping-glaſſes away. What to be done after they be taken away. Deep ſcarifying evil. as many cups, and drawing as much bloud as you ſee good: and when no more bloud will come, and that you thinke it time to take them away, which is known by a yellow water which cometh at the laſt; then (I ſay) it is time to waſh the places with faire water where the cups ſtood, and drie them with a ſpunge or cloth, and onely anoint them with Ung. Album once, and they will bee whole. The overdeep ſcarifying it, is not onely dangerous, but alſo painfull, and not art-like: for if you note well the cutis, it hath many capillar veines in it; yea, and ſome great veines, and is porous, ſo that the Artiſt may by force draw humiditie ſufficient from farre, if ſo occaſion bee to uſe their utmoſt force. Large and with cups are fitteſt on the thighes, leſſer on the arms, and the leaſt for the hands or feet.

                     Of the Blood Poringers.
                     
                        The quantity of blood. Imitation with out diſcretion is idle. Blood poringers neceſſary. BLood Poringers are neceſſary at Sea, to be the more certain of the quantity of blood which is let; for ſince the blood of man is ſo precious, it is to be well weighed what quantity is taken. And although the German Surgeons, do ever let blood into a baſon, yet I hold it not good for the Surgeons Mate to imitate firſt, except he be of good judgement indeed, to judge of the quantity. The blood Poringers, which are made for that purpoſe being full, hold juſt three ounces, andThe conſtitution of the body is to be regarded in Phlebotomy. ſomewhat more▪ For my own practice I hold this courſe; if one chance to come to me of himſelf, or by advice of a Phyſician to be let blood, though he have a ſtrong body, I never take from him more then two poringers, and a half at the moſt, but often leſſe. If the party be not ſtrong, except it be in caſe of a Pleuriſie, or ſome like urgent cauſe, I take leſſe. For in that work except my reaſon give me good ſatisfaction to do the contrary, I will rather offeud in too little, then in too muchToo little rather then too much blood is to be taken away. taking of blood away; for I have ſeen much hurt to have enſued by great quantity of blood taken away at one time: 7. or 8. ounces I hold a ſtrong body may bear to loſe, having good nouriſhment to recover it again, and that without harm: but if you grow to ten ounces, you may many wayes do harm in the body, except your warrant be good. I ſpeak not this to diſcourage young Surgeons from a work ſo behovefull, but admoniſh them to warineſſe in a point ſo dangerous.

                        The uſe. THe Dyet Pot is not alone to be uſed in caſes of dyet drink, ſeething for the pox, and not otherwiſe; for as a learned Doctor upon occaſion lately reaſoned, there is difference betwixt the Dyet and a Dyet, though in both kinds there is even. Quot homines, tot ſententiae, ſo many men, ſo many minds. Wherefore concerning deſcriptions, of ſeveral Dyet drinks for the pox, I will refer the Surgeons Mate to other Authors: for in truth I muſt defer that point till fitter oppertunity; I mean till I write touching the cure of that diſeaſe. And yet (methinks) to ſpeak ſomewhatA docoction for the Calenture. of a drink is the caſe of the Calenture, or any other unnatural hot fever, to be made at Sea to qualifie the heat of the blood, were not amiſſe; which may be done as followeth.

                     Of Weight and Scales.
                     VVEights and Scales are neceſſary things, often times lightly regarded, and yet how many mens lives hang in the ballance, it is plain enough. For Sea-Surgeons familiarly give Stibium by the grain,The uſe is divers. namely, from 4. to 8. grains, yea and to 12. grains by your leave, when in truth few of them have waights and Scales which can weigh one grain.A great fault in weights and ſcales. It is a dangerous thing for a Surgeon at Sea, to be unprovided of neat weights and Scales which will turn with half a grain: for how can they give either Laudanum Paracelſi, Stibium, or other Chimical medicines

ſafely, or almoſt any medicine inward without ſmall weights and Scales? Wherefore two pair of weights and Scales, are very needful for the Surgeons Cheſt; namely one for ounces, and another for grains; for larger Scales the ſhip is furniſhed. It is alſo to be underſtood here, for inſtruction of children in Art, that xvi. ounces, make aA direction i

                     Of the Cloſe-ſtoole, with the Paile of Braſſe, and the Bricks.
                     ALthough I know before hand, that I am to undergo many witty and Eloquent flouts from young gallants of my own profeſſion, for mentioning ſo baſe an inſtrument to belong to the Surgeons charge, as this laſt mentioned Cloſe-ſtoole, with his appurtenances, yet let themMean things ſometimes are of great moment. know, that neither can my book bluſh; neither ſhall my ſelf, I hope, have cauſe; for I nothing doubt to yeeld each honeſt young Artiſt a ſufficient reaſon for to ſatisfie him herein: and (in a word) my reaſon for appointing to each ſhip, bound for the Eaſt-Indies, at the leaſt one of theſe, is becauſe the bloody, or other flixes, are ſo dangerous diſeaſes, and ſo deadly amongſt our men, that I hold it my duty to adviſe even the goodNone worthy to be reputed

                        The uſe of the Cloſe-ſtool. The need of it is great. Alſo one eſpecial reaſon, why I have appointed it, is, that a poor weak man in his extremities, ſhould not continually go to the ſhrouds, or beak-head to eaſe himſelf; nor by noyſome to his fellowes, but might by the help of his Mate through this mean inſtrument find comfort in his moſt pitiful diſtreſſe; whoſe miſeries I heartily compaſſionate. Wherefore, I admoniſh the Surgeons Mate in general, in the fear of God, not to be fine fingered, ſlothful, ſcornful to uſe every kind of good manualObſerve this, thou haſt acon

But I am not ignorant, that there is uſe for twenty cloſe-ſtooles at once, in ſome one ſhip, which work the Cooper and Carpenter ſhould take care of.

                     The Military Surgeon.
                     SIr, I like well your motion, and here at the ſigne of the mouth you may be accommodated, for I long to come to the opening of the riddle, with alſo your imparting to me your collections, experiences, and inſtructions, ariſing thereby in military ſervice according to your formerſtrupoſition.
                  
                  
                     The Authour.
                     BRother Surgeon, I am ready to anſwer your deſire, and that as brief as poſſible; for we are come to the period, here you ſee the choice materialls, before us the wine and the Tobacco the latter, of which unfold the riddle, if you deſire the pipe of Tobacco, take it as your ſhare and the ſubject of the riddle; the operative part whereof is but ſmoake, and therefore ſmoake it to the purpoſe, and I will anſwer you in the good liquour which finiſheth the firſt end of our meeting: namely, for the unfolding of the riddle being finiſhed: Now I doe intend to fall upon a briefe declaring to you, of ſome medicinall uſes of the ſo long ſpoken of

pipe of good ſmoake, by ſetting forth the giving of it Gliſterwife in a fume to a Patient reverſed in the Iliaca paſsio, wherein it excelleth, as alſo for many other obſtructions, gripings, tortions, Iliacal, and other diſtempers of the bowels.
                     And firſt for the time and manner of the giving thereof, it is beſt to be given if occaſion be by tortions, after a former ordinary Gliſter hath been given; that hath emptied the great gut called Inteſtinum rectum, for ſo it may have the freer place by inflation, to force up the fume thereof, for the opening the obſtructed parts, for the better effecting whereof, if the Artiſt that adminiſtreth the fumous Gliſter put the pipe prepared into the fundament as far as it will or can goe, with the firſt ſhort pipe ſcrewed to it, and depending thereon; remembring ere he put the pipe into the patients body, he put a thinne piece of a wet bladder, or oyled paper, or a fine ragge onely on over the head, I mean or over the holes of the ſaid Gliſter pipe, the which pipe being ſo armed put into the body to the utmoſt, that it may be paſſed in without offence, the Artiſt being firſt ready with his pipe, prepared either of ſmoake lighted, or of powder put into the ſocket or appointe

                     The Gliſter Inſtrument, fit for the exact giving of a vaporous, fumous, or dry Gliſter, ought to confiſt of ſeven parts, in order to be put together (hereafter explained) which in their order and places effected, the fumous medicine by inflation is to be driven up to the agrieved part if poſſible, but howſoever it ought to be put up and to be diſcharged into the Inteſtinum rectum; which is a ſafe and beneficiall courſe, eſpecially when the infirmity is in that gut (as is ſaid:) This excellent inſtrument hath a double ſcope in his office of healing, the one way in the delivering into the body by inflation, any torrified or dry powdred medicaments in their powders, the other in delivering thereinto any vaporous medicaments as is ſaid, and namely, the vapours of Tobacco, of Nutmegs, Anni-ſeed, Colts-foot, Bay-berries, Mi

But the Artiſt muſt in this manner of curing obſerve ſome generall rules, with alſo ſome caveats in the adminiſtring of Gliſters by inflation, whether they be fumous or materiall ſubſtances; namely, firſt note, that if they be intended for dry medicines or fumes, that they bee given into the body, where looſeneſs of the belly by a fluxe or otherwiſe hath proceeded; whereby the Inteſtinum rectum, may be hoped to be empty, the better to receive with effect the dry or vaporative medicine, that it be not impediated by hard excrements, but ſuppoſe it bee, and that there be no other preventions ready then as aforeſaid, the uſe of an oyled paper or wet bladder will doe well, which ſo put up, and the inſtrument ſomewhat

drawback, and then by inflation or blowing it in with fitting continued force, it will effect thy deſire.
                     Much more might be added of the facilitie, pleaſure, and benefit, of this infaſive device if time would give leave, but the whole work of my Treatiſes, being almoſt printed off before I had reſolved to explain this inflatious piece of Art, forceth me to uſe all brevity therein, where I had intended the proſecution thereof further, namely, by ſome device of Art to have ordered the parts of the Inſtruments, ſo that a man might have given himſelf a Gliſter in that was, which I will not queſtion, one or another will finde out; and no doubt will adde to this invention: yea, and queſtionleſſe will invent other good offices that it may be fit for, although perhaps will not willingly publiſh it, which I leave to the time unfolder, finiſher and the conſumer of all things.
                     Concerning the parts of this inſtrument, as well in their particulars as alſo in their compoſure, or ready, being put together and fitted to be uſed in one as followeth.

                                 1 The firſt is the Gliſter pipe which ought to be in length ordinarie, or according to Art, a greater and a leſſer as the preſent occaſion may urge.

                                 3 The third is the elbow piece ſcrewed into the one ſide of the upper part of the gliſter pipe, ſtanding Byas, or a ſcant, being framed ſo to ſtand, and that part ought to be in length two inches and a half, or near three inches, but not full three.
                                 4 The fourth is a ſtraight pipe of eight inches long in all; all conſiſting of foure particular parts, if devided or devidable; namely, the long or fiſtula.
                                 5 The fourth of the ſeven is a piece of Ivory ſcrewed and fixed into that lower fiſtula or pipe, that containeth the ſilver or other metaline part thereof.
                                 6 The next is the ſilver bole or cup within the ſaid Ivory head, and containeth the fumous medicine, being to be accounted the ſixth part.
                                 7 And the ſeventh part is the cover ſcrewed on the head thereof, being full of holes for the better inflation of the ſmoak, all which rightly conjoyned, maketh one entire inſtrument, which may iuſtly be named fistula fumoſum.

                     Emplaſtrum ſtipticum Paracelſi.
                     
                        THis compoſition, deviſed by the famous Philoſophers Philippus, Theophrastus, and Paracelſus, excelleth in the cure of piercing wounds and ſtabs; as alſo in the cure of all dangerous wounds whatſoever: it hath the precedence as well for contuſed as inciſed wounds; for it aſſwageth pain, defendeth from accidents, diſcuſſeth, mollifieth, attracteth, incarneth, digeſteth, and conſolidates, and is alſo good for an old ach proceeding of a cold cauſe. It is further eſpecially good for ulcers on the leggs, or elſewhere in any part of the body: it is of temperament warm, and very comfortable.
                     For approbation whereof you may ſee Paracelſus his own words, which I have here inſerted.
                     Hoc Emplaſtrum eſt magis vertutis divinae quam humanae. Valet ad omnes plagas, novas & antiquas. Abſtergit, mundificat, carnem bonam generat, conſolidat ex fundo plus una ſeptimana, quam ali
                           •
                        d quodcunque in menſe, nec permittit fieri aliquam putrefactionem & corruptionem, nec malam carnem generat. Valet omnibus nervis inciſis, ut conquaſſatis & muſculis. Valet omnibus inflaturis, abſtrabit ferrum & lignum, & plumbum de plaga, eidem ſuppoſitum. Valet contra omnes morſuras cujuſcunque morſurae beſtiae venenoſae, & puncturas Serpentis; maturat, ſanat omne generatum cujuſcunque Apoſtumatis, ſuperpoſitum. Valet in membris generationis ſi ibi fuerit corruptio. Valet contra Cancrum, fiſtulas, contra ignem perſicum; ſedat dolores cujuſcunque plagae. Haec Theophraſt Bombaſt.
                  
                  
                     Diachilon magnum cum gummis.
                     THis Emplaiſter diſſolveth, maturateth, and mollifieth hardneſſes, and is principally good in Apoſtumes: it is of temperament warm,

and moiſt. It was firſt deviſed by a certain Artiſt named Serapis. Avicenna (as ſome think) invented it; but others judge that Meſues was the inventor thereof.
                  
                  
                     Diachilon parvum.
                     THis Emplaiſter is very good to diſſolve ſchirras, tumours of the liver, ſpleen, reins, belly, or elſewhere; it is wholly compoſed of mollifying and diſcuſſing ingredients; it ſerveth generally for hot or cold cauſes, but chiefly for hot: For I hold it to be of temperament cold, the rather, by reaſon of the much Litharge in it, which, if a mineral may be called▪either hot or cold Litharge, cold it is without queſtion. It was deviſed by Meſues.
                     
                  
                  
                     Diacalcitheos.
                     THis Emplaſter mitigateth pain; it is a good defenſative againſt all venemous humours, and will very well induce a cicatrice in wounds and ulcers: alſo it hath an eſpecial good quality to aſſwage the pain in the ſmall of the back, proceeding from diſtempered kidnies, by hot cauſes, aſwell concerning the ſtone, and gravel, as in the Gonorrea: and diſſolved or relented with oyl of roſes or elders, or of linſeed, it is a very good medicine to heal burnings, and ſcaldings. It was deviſed firſt by Galenus: of temperament it is cooling and drying.

                     THis is a very ancient compoſition, but aſcribed chiefly to Nicolaus an ancient Writer as Author thereof: it is of quality anodine, attracting, mollifying, and comforting; aſſwageth pains in the gout proceeding of a cold cauſe, and is good in cold Aches, and by that attracting vertue it hath, it draweth out vapors per por os cutis, or the ſweat vents in the skin, whereby it often unladeth the body of vicious and noiſome humors, which otherwiſe might indanger the Patient: of temperament it is hot and moiſt, &c.

ſecret, and the beſt thing I ever knew in curing kybed heels and chilblains: it is of temperament hot and moiſt, and was deviſed by Meſues.
                     
                  
                  
                     Emplaſtrum de lapide calaminari, or Griſium.
                     THis Emplaſter (I may ſpeak of my own experience) is a good healer of ulcers which are hard to be cicatrized, and hath an eſpecial vertue in curing of buboes, as well venereal as peſtilential: It is alſo the beſt incarnative of all the Plaſters that ever I uſed.
                  
                  
                     Emplaſtrum de Minio.
                     THis Minium-plaſter is a good diſcuſſer of hot humors, a good ſwager of pains, mollifieth well, repelleth ſomewhat, and is very commodiouſly uſed upon wounds and ulcers, to further good healing: it induceth alſo a good cicatrice. In the tumour of ſcr

                           tum, or rather of the Teſticles, called Hernia humoralis, commonly following the ſudden ſtopping of Gonorrae, it is a very convenient anodine and diſcuſſing Plaſter. This Emplaſter likewiſe is very good to aſſwage pain, in any caſe, where ſafely an anodine Emplaſter is required; as namely, in contuſed or diſtorted joynts: onely note, that this Emplaſtrum de Minio is meant of the compoſition ſet down by that reverent Maſter Galle in his Diſpenſatory, for I make mine according to his deſcription.
                  
                  
                     Emplaſtrum calidum.
                     THis Emplaſtrum ſtomachi or calidum, is a compoſition deſcribed by Johannes Jacobus Weckerus, under that name, pag. 953. of his Diſpenſatory: it is onely uſed where a comforting Emplaſter of a very warm temperament is required: it is a needful Emplaſter of a very warm temperament is required: it is a needful Emplaſter in the Surgeons Cheſt; for it comforteth much the liver or ſtomack debilitated by cold humours, and helpeth well digeſtion; yet in want thereof Paracelſus Plaſter, though not ſo fitly, may ſerve.

                        THis unguent doth digeſt and incarn wounds and ulcers; and will alſo prepare and bring to ſuppuration an Apoſtume either hot or cold, being ſomewhat thick ſpread on towe or leather and applyed thereto: it alſo mitigateth the pain and pulſation thereof, and is likewiſe very fitly mixed either with praecipitate, Unguentum Egyptiacum, or the like medicine, the more eaſily and better to mundifie and cleanſe an ulcer: this unguent is of temperament warm, and it is aſcribed to have been deviſed by Galen: it is alſo good for burnings and ſcaldings.

                     THis unguent ſerveth well to cleanſe and ſcowre ulcers and fiſtula's, and to make a good ground to healing: it is of temperament hot and dry: it was deviſed by Avicen; named Apoſtolorum, for that it conſiſteth of twelve ſeveral ingredients joyned into one body.

                     Vnguentum Egyptiacum.
                     THis unguent ſerveth to ſcowre; it mundifieth all rotten foul ulcers, and is beſt to be put into the grief ſcalding hot, for then the uſual pain and corroſion it procureth will be quickly paſt: in like manner it is to be uſed in any venemous wounds, made either with poyſoned ſhot,

or bitten with mad dogs, or any other venemous creature, or great contuſed wounds, wherein, for preventing them from fear of a Gangreen, it excelleth. It ſerveth alſo well to be uſed alone, or mixed with any lotion for ulcers of the mouth and throat, eſpecially in the ſcurvie. This unguent drieth vehemently, and is abſterſive: it is of temperament hot and dry, and was deviſed by Meſues.

                     THis unguent is very good to cool and heal any hot moiſt puſtles: it cureth excoriations of the skin in any place, but chiefly in the yard betwixt glans and praeputium: it alſo healeth burnings and ſcaldings very well, and is good to be applyed to any painfull ulcer; for it aſſwageth pain, and healeth well. It was invented by Avicen: it is of temperament cold, anodine, mollificative, and attractive, and therefore of very good conſequence in the Surgeons Cheſt.

                     THis unguent is good to heal painful ulcers in any part of the body, eſpecially of the yard, or betwixt glans and praeputium, as alſo any fretting or painful ulcers of the leggs, or elſewhere. I have found it good before all other unguents in ulcers of the yard; indeed againſt virulent, painfull and corroſive ulcers, ſcarce a better compoſition is known: in Noli me tangere in the face, I have had good experience of it; and in many other occaſions I have found it a very uſeful unguent: of temperament it is cold and dry. Nicolaus Alexandrinus was the Author of it.

                     THis is uſed againſt inflammations, Ignem ſacrum, and all hot pains of the head: it aſſwageth the pains of the liver, kidnies, and belly, proceeding of heat, and hath vertue to corroborate. It was invented by Meſues.

Of temperament this unguent is cold and dry: it is ſubject to divide it ſelf, namely, the Oyl, Litharge, and Vinegar aſunder; which if it be wrought together again will be as good as at the firſt: and if it be over dry, add vinegar and oyl thereto, and it will be as good as ever.
                  
                  
                     Unguentum Populeum.
                     THis ſerveth well to aſſwage the pains of the Sourvy; by anointing the parts grieved there with. I may juſtly ſay, upon the experience of divers skilful Surgeons, and my own alſo, that as well in hot as in cold countries, it hath been found ſo exceeding comfortable and behoveful, that ſcarce any compoſition of an Unguent in the Surgeons Cheſt may compare with it: which ſome may think is a very abſurd affirmation in reaſon, but that experience will have it ſo. It is good alſo to annoint the Temples, to provoke reſt in hot fevers; as alſo the palms of the hands and ſoles of the feet. It is likewiſe good to be applyed for ſwaging of pain in any part of the body, and being applyed cold upon a Plegent where you have laid any corroſive, it eaſeth the dolour of the cauſtick medicine. Of temperament it is cold and moiſt; it was deviſed by Nicolaus.

It is a linament of ancient uſe amongſt our countrey Surgeons, and good: but I find it not mentioned in ancient Writers; in want whereof uſe Tripharmacon, or an infuſion of Vinegar and Litharge: namely, ℞ Litharge of gold in powder ℥ 4. wine Vinegar lib i. mix them well, and boil them very gently a little on the fire, and the Vinegar will become ſweet as ſugar, and very anodine: foment the grief therewith, and you ſhall find preſent eaſe to the party. Or take Populeum and unguentum album mixed, and apply it on ſoft cap-paper, firſt being well rubbed with your hand to make it ſo: or take Diacalcithios or Minium plaſter, and mix it with Linſeed-oyl, or oyl of Elders, till it be a gentle unguent, and ſo apply it: or Tripharmacon alone will do well: alſo Honey alone is a good medicine.

Where I write the compoſitions of my medicines in general, that alſo ſhall be expreſſed. In want of this compoſition, the Vng. album, either alone, or mixed with Tripharmacon, will do very well; which if it be too hard or dry, you may mix oyl of Roſes or Linſeed with it: and for want of this, you may take Diacalcithios or Minium mixed or relented with

any of the ſaid oyles, or any other fitting oyl, as oyl olive ſimple: alſo unguentum Baſilicon is very good in burnings and ſcaldings.

                     THe compoſition of this Unguent is recited in the cure of the Scurvy. I have had the practice thereof, and found it very good to attenuate groſſe tumors of the Scurvy, to aſſwge the pains of them, and by the uſe thereof to diſſolve ſuch tumors. I uſe this Unguent in cold cauſes, and in want thereof, ung: Martiatum, or Oleum Laurini, or Dialthea: but in hot griefs and very painful I uſe Populeum.

                     THis Unguent Nicolas an ancient writer ſeemeth to be the Author of. It is profitable againſt pains of the breaſt proceeding of a cold cauſe, and againſt the Pleuriſie: it warmeth, mollifieth, and comforteth all the parts of the body, which are evil diſpoſed through cold infirmities: it is alſo good againſt ſtiffneſſe and pains of the joynts in the Scurvy.

                     THis unguent is a ſure Balſame for wounds of any ſort, or in any part of the body, either penetrating or not penetrating; in wounds penetrating either inject it warm, or pour it into the wound. Alſo upon any occaſion, it is to be drunk ʒ i. or ii. at once, or for a doſe. It healeth wounds within the body. Alſo it healeth burnings and ſcaldings without any ſcar.

                     Vnguentum de Mercurio.
                     I Have elſe-where ſaid, and it is too much apparent, that for healing and killing, Mercury hath no fellow; and where I recite Mercury in any of my inſtructions, you muſt underſtand me Quick-ſilver, for ſo it is truly ſtiled by the Learned, and not without good reaſon. This Unguent, joyne with it what other ingredients you pleaſe, yet if Mercury be one, it will ſhew his valour in deſpight of the reſt, though it have 20. for one odds againſt it; ſo puiſſant is that volatile and excellent ſpirit of his, which (I may boldly ſay) could truly never be tamed: and yet many worthy medicines are made thereof, which in their ſeveral places I mean to explain as I ſhall have time, God willing. You may make this Unguent of Dialthea, oleum Laurini. ana lib. ſs. Mercurius vivus, or quick-ſilver ℥ ii. oleum ſpice or Tereb. If you have them, ana ℥ ſs.

and if you ſee cauſe in very cold bodies you may add of Euphorbium in powder ʒ ii. This unguent is good to provoke a flux. You may make it of one of theſe unguents alone for need. But I wiſh not the Surgeon to carry any of this unguent ready made to the Eaſt-Indies; for the Quickſilver (it is to be feared) will fall to the bottome: but if he will needs have it ready made, let him add to the compoſition, wax, a ſufficient quantity; but it muſt be made as followeth. The wax and unguent muſt be melted together, which being yet warm, ℞ Terebinthinae clarae ℥ i. being put into the bottome of the woodden bowle, or braſſe baſon, not a pewter baſon; and ſtirring it ſo long till all the Quick-ſilver be clean loſt, and turned into a blew ſalve, no more to be ſeen; then by little and little mix it with the former, and being almoſt coagulated (I mean almoſt clean cold, neither liquid through heat, nor altogether cold) work the Terebinthinae with the Mercury altogether ſtrongly till it be cold. You muſt uſe it cold, and neither let the Patient himſelf chafe it in till it be warm, or (which is better) let the Patient ſtand before the fire and chafe it in. But note, he which anointeth other therewith, if he uſe it too often, let him put a bladder on his hands; for the often uſe thereof cauſeth many evils. This unguent hath as many vertues as vices, and as many vices as vertues: a whole week may be eaſily ſpent, with good profit to the Reader, in waiting of Mercury: I heartily wiſh ſome learned and worthy man would take in hand truly to anatomize that ſubject: I am perſwaded, yea, and know well, he might thereby ſave the lives of many an innocent ſoul, who with great infamy periſh through the inordinate uſe of this unguent; notwithſtanding the medicine is good. But I refer the Surgeons Mate, for the uſe of this unguent, to Mr. Clowes his book of Surgery.
                     But concerning the ordinary uſes thereof, if you anoint the joynts therewith, it killeth the itch; but if you anoint too plentifully it provoketh a flux, ſometimes upward, ſometimes downward. If you anoint the ſeams of his ſhirt which is lowſie therewith, it driveth away all the lice: the ſame it doth to the lice of the eye-browes and ſecret parts, wherewith many are troubled. Alſo for the pils it is a very good medicine; I uſe it in that caſe, firſt to purge the Patient, and after to anoint him with Vnguentum album, wherein Quick-ſilver is mixed; namely, of the unguentum ℥ i. of Mercury 
                        ʒ i. miſce, and anoint therewith daily three times, and keep the place very warm.

                     I Cannot but reverence the Author of this precious plain Linament; whoſe deſert is highly to be eſteemed of by the Commonwealth: for it is as ſufficient a Balm for new wounds, eſpecially in the head, as that a better can ſcarce be found out by art. It doth all the intentions of healing a wound in the head meerly of it ſelf, the flux being ſtayed: For it digeſteth, mundifieth, incarneth, and cicatrizeth, it defendeth from accidents, and is very anodine: it may alſo fitly be applyed to painfull ulcers and fiſtula's upon occaſion. The Author or manifeſter

of this Linament was Franciſcus Arceus, as is manifeſt by a ſmall treatiſe of his, tranſlated by Mr. John Read a Surgeon: It is of temperament hot and moiſt.

                     THis unguent is numbred amongſt the four hot unguents. It profiteth generally againſt all cold affects of the outward parts of the body: it much warmeth and comforreth the ſinewes: it is good againſt convulſions and cramps: it is good to anoint the ridg-bone of the back, and the parts near the kidnies againſt the pains thereof: and alſo to anoint the ſtomack and belly upon any cold grief: it is good to anoint the body of them which have the quartane fever, the falling ſickneſſe, the pains of the joynts: and alſo it is good to be uſed as a Morbus ointment (according to the common phraſe) adding the due quantity of Mercury thereto; which I account to be of Quick-ſilver ℥ii. to the unguent lib. i. But I find it will not retain his vertues above one year, as witneſſeth Johannes Jacobus Weckerus: wherefore I forbear this compoſition in the Surgeons Cheſt.

                     THis unguent, as it is compoſed of many ingredients, ſo it is ſaid to be effectual for many griefs: for (ſaith the Author) it diſcuſſeth cold cauſes in the head, ſinewes, and joynts: it removeth pain from the breaſt and ſtomack proceeding from colds: it prevaileth aganſt convulſions: it helpeth the reſolution of the ſinewes, dead palſie, and them that are troubled with the Sciatica or hip-gout, the gout in the hands, feet, and other joynts of the body: it mollifieth hard puſcles and tumors in the fleſh: it aſſwageth the hard ſwellings of the liver and ſpleen; eaſeth the pain in the ſmall guts; it cureth the ach in the reins. It hath his name (as Salaritanus ſaith) of Martianus; or as Ma

                     IT is called Axungia, of anointing the Axle-tree, to make the wheeles turn eaſier about, for which cauſe many uſe it to this day. It is liquid, flowing like oyl with warmeth: it hath a lenifying and anodine quality, and therefore it is not unprofitably uſed for mitigation of ſharp humours, aſſwaging of pain, healing of burnings with fire, and very fitly mixed with Cataplaſmes appointed for thoſe effects.

                     THis Axungia is of a hot nature, doth aſſwage aches, reſolveth and mollifieth hard tumours in any part of the body. And by experience

is found very good, adminiſtred in Gliſters, to heal the excoriations of the Inteſtinum rectum; for it is anodine and very ſanative. The manner to uſe it, is ſomewhat touched in ſome other my inſtructions elſewhere.

As for burnings and ſcaldings, it cureth them without ſcar, and is very good to heal ulcers of the ears; and (ſaith Dioſcorides) drunk with water is wholeſome for the belly and ſtomack (it helpeth ſuch as are pained in the kidnies and bladder.

                  Of the vertues and uſes of ſundry Cordial waters.

                     THis Water needeth no man to deſcribe his vertues, being a thing ſo common and ancient in uſe, compoſed by that learned Phyſitian of worthy memory ſo named. Experience hath found it to be a notable cordial water for comforting the head and heart, yea, and all the principal faculties of the body, both animal, vital, and natural, if it be truly prepared: and of this there needeth no queſtion, if you will but believe the ſeller thereof.

                     THis is the tincture and chief eſſence (drawn by the ſpirit of wine, from the rindes of Limons) which is a great reſtorative to mans nature, and a precious Cordial, which not onely aromatizeth the ſtomack, but much ſtrengthneth the feebled ſpirits, and is as an healing balſame to all the inward parts of the body, and doth open obſtructions and break the wind in the ſtomack exceedingly. Juyce of Limons is touched elſewhere in the cure of Scurvy.
                  
                  
                     Roſemary Water.
                     THis is a great comforter of the brain, ſharpneth the ſight, helpeth the weakneſſe of the ſtomack, preſerveth from vomiting, is very good againſt the diſeaſe Dyſentery, or the bloody flix (the cauſe proceeding of cold) either drunk, or three ſpoonfuls taken in a Gliſter, when you are ready to adminiſter the ſame. It hath very many other good properties too long here to recite.
                  
                  
                     Saſſafras Water.
                     THe ſpirit of this precious root is a great opener, of all obſtructions or ſtoppings in the body; namely, of the liver, the lungs, the kidnies, and of the ſpleen: and therby it is found by many experiences excellent againſt the Scurvy, the French diſeaſe, and the yellow jaundiſe; it is an approved remedy alſo againſt cold fevers, and the dropſie, or for thoſe which are inclining thereto; for it provoketh urine and ſweat, in a very mild and natural manner, and driveth out many diſeaſes by the pores of the skin. It hath infinite more vertues aſcribed

unto it: the beſt of theſe roots grow in Virginia. You may read Monardus of the vertues of this root more at large in his Treatiſe of New Spain.

                     THis water, as the former, and alſo thoſe which follow, have all their ſubſtances from the Spirit of wine, and muſt therefore, being truly ſo made, retain the manifold good vertues thereof: and beſides, having therein the whole vertues of the Aniſe-ſeeds, it is found very excellent againſt wind in the ſtomack or elſe-where in the body, and againſt Aſma, the Tiſick and ſhortneſſe of breath: it alſo breaketh flegme, and warmeth the ſtomack.

                     NO water whatſoever more gratefull to the ſtomack, then is Wormwood water truly compoſed; for it is as balſame thereto. It conſumeth and breaketh wind mightily, killeth the worms, whereunto our Nation are ſubject in the Eaſt-Indies, hindereth vomiting, provoketh appetite, is very good againſt pains in the head proceeding of a cold cauſe, and is very Cordial

                     THis water hath a great reſpect to the heart, for of all other but the former, no herb is eſteemed more Cordial then this, and is of a grateful ſmell and taſt; yet I hold it more proper to women then men, for it much reſpecteth the infirmities of the Mother, and is, in the times of their pains, very comfortable to take a little of it for the ſafer and ſooner provoking of ſpeedy delivery.

                           s Benedictus Water, doth eaſe the pain of the head, confirmeth the memory, cureth a quartane, provoketh ſweat, and comforteth the vital ſpirits.
                  
                  
                     
                     The Concluſion.
                     AL theſe waters and ſpirits rehearſed, though in themſelves they be good, yet if any of the beſt of them be abuſed, and immoderately taken, they may as ſoon do harm as profit: I adviſe therefore no man to make a common uſe of them, or any of them, which hath a young able body, and may have a good diet at his pleaſure: for they are chiefly to be uſed at ſea, where mens bodies (by variety of the venemous vapours and evil diſpoſitions of the aire, or unkind diet) are in hazzard; or where there is a weak ſtomack, evil digeſtion, with a loathing diſpoſition to meat, evil appetite, and too much looſneſſe of the belly; alſo where by extream heat and ſweat, the ſpirits of the body are exhauſted and ſpent, or where (through the extream cold of the ſame) the body is much annoyed and endangered: In all theſe, and infinite more evils incident to mens bodies abroad and at home theſe precious liquors miniſter preſent comfort. They alſo are very behoveful to aged people after their meats to help digeſtion, or them which have weak ſtomacks, or that are of ſad and melancholy diſpoſitions; for it muſt not be denied, that wine comforteth the heart of man; and theſe waters having their original and whole force from the ſpirit or life of the wine, do thereby exhilarate mans heart, and give him courage, as well as cure his infirmities.
                     If therefore theſe waters be truly made, they ought alſo to be ſtrong of the ſpirit of wine, otherwiſe they will not keep long good, neither are they profitable nor wholſome, and being good, one ſpoonful at one time is ſufficient, or two ſpoonfuls at the moſt, for the preſerving of health: they are beſt to be taken faſting, one hour or two after dinner, and laſt at night, either alone, or with beere or wine; ſome make a toſte faſting, and drop the ſame full of cordial water and ſo eat it, and that is very good.
                     In gripings of the guts, collick or flixes of the belly, proceeding of cold cauſes or much crudity, three ſpoonfuls or four may be uſed at once in a Glifter; but you muſt not boil it therein, onely put it in when it is ready to be adminiſtred; for if you do otherwiſe, the ſpirit will evaporate and be of no force.

                     FOr this water, if you deſire the compoſition thereof, I refer you to the Author; namely, Gabrielus Falopius, in his Treatiſe De Morbo Gallico: but hereafter I mean to ſet down ſome ſeveral compoſitions thereof; for the Author hath divers.
                     It is a water proper, and is made chiefly of Mercury ſublimed, I ſay chiefly, for that though the other things for quantity be ten for one, yet ſublimed Mercury will carry no cools, but will ever ſhew his valour in healing or ſpoiling: I put not this compoſition ready made into any Surgeons Cheſt, but rather leave the ingredients, and let the diſcreet Surgeon make it to pleaſe himſelf; for if I my ſelf ſhould find ſuch a compoſition made by any, I ſhould much fear to uſe of it, and ſo I wiſh the Surgeons Mate to do in all Mercurial Lotions; but rather let him uſe ſuch other good Lotions, as are ſet down in the cure of the Scurvy; unto any of which he may add ſublimate, and term it if he pleaſe, Aqu

                     THis Green water (which is held a maxime by ſome Surgeons) hath his tincture from Viridi or Aeris, and likewiſe his aſtringent taſt and vertue. His chief uſe is concerning the cures of Opthalmiae in the eyes, and alſo againſt divers rheumes, or diſtillations of humours troubling the eyes, guttatim or drop-wiſe adminſtred; for the deſcription whereof, I refer the Reader to the reſt of my compoſitions, where they ſhall be found together; but I uſe in place thereof Lapis medicamentoſ

                     Verjuice.
                     VErviſe or Verjuice, made of the juyce of Crabs, is a good cooling medicine to be given in drinks againſt burning fevers; it helps digeſtion, cauſeth appetite, reliſheth well meats and drinks, and is cordial, familiar, and pleaſing to the taſt; but it will not live above one year in good force at Sea, yet I give way to the putting it into the Cheſt, for that it is often deſired by Surgeons.
                  
                  
                     Lotion.
                     THis word Lotion, is a general phraſe with many Surgeons, as if there were no difference in Lotions, whereas their differences are infinite: but here I will uſe it as the vulgar ſort do. A Lotion compounded of vulnerary hearbs gathered in their prime, and decocted with allumen and mel in aqua pura, I confeſſe may retain a name general as wellas any one outward medicine I know; for if well prepared, good uſe may be made thereof; as namely, it is all in all to be uſed as an injection generally for griefs of the yard, aſwell within the paſſage as alſo 'twixt glans and praeputium, and in Gonorrea; which though it cannot cure the diſeaſe, yet it healeth the excoriations thereof, and ſtrengtheneth well the parts; and ſo doth it in all exulceratious of the ſame, remembring, that if you uſe it within the paſſage of the yard, if you find it be too tart of the Allom, you mix it with Plaintane-water if you have it, or for want thereof with fair water. Note that the firſt time you begin injection, it be very gently done, then you may fortifie it as you ſee cauſe; namely, give it of it ſelf, or with the addition of a little well dulcified Mercury where occaſion is, but that warily; namely, ſeldom or never within the paſſage, 'but twixt glans and praeputium daily (if you will) upon juſt occaſion; and adminiſter no Lotion within the paſſage of Virga cold, but warm ever. Further it hath the prime place, for a Catholick medicine in exulcerations and excoriations of the mouth and throat, both in Town and Country, and is become in ſuch caſes every old wives medicine: I have touched it in the cure of the Scurvy, wherefore here for brevities ſake, I crave pardon: Onely, let me tell the Surgeons Mate, that in want of ſuch a Lotion, though it be not in all points anſwerable thereto, yet he may make a good Lotion at ſea of freſh water, Allome, and Hony, provided he be wary not to be too plentiful of the Allome.
                  
                  
                     
                     Lixivium forte.
                     THis is to be underſtood of capital lees, a very neceſſary medicine to be at hand in the Surgeons Cheſt, to mollifie the liquid or white cauſtick when it groweth dry, and alſo if need be, by decoction perſe to make up a lapis infernalis, as ſome term it, or a hard cauſtick ſtone: the liquid cauſtick is made onely of unſlaked lime and ſtrong Capital lees, by decoction together to the thickneſſe of an unguent, and when occaſion of application thereof is, lay on the grief a Minium, or ſome other cleaving Emplaſter, with a hole cut therein, ſo big as there ſhall be occaſion to make an orifice, and ſpread thick the white cauſtick thereon, and ſo let it remain at the leaſt two hours, having a care to defend the ſame, that it do not ſpread any further at all.
                     The cauſtick ſtone if you boil it to a juſt conſiſtence, and having put it out (being yet warm) ſmooth it over with an iron ſplatter, and then with a knife cut it into pieces, ſo you ſhall have it ready to make inciſion after your own will; for any cauſtick laid on an Apoſtume may ſpread further and broader then you will, to the dammage of the Patient, but this kind of cauſtick you may hold in your hand wrapped in ſome clout or piece of plaiſter ſpread, and ſo you may rule it at your own deſire, and yet it maketh greater ſpeed with leſſe pain then the other. Somewhat of this manner of inciſion I have mentioned in the cure of Apoſtumes, and elſewhere, to which I refer you.

                     VNderſtand that vinegar of Roſes is, or ought to be vinegar of wine firſt, and then by the inſuſion of choice read roſe-leaves, it becomes the more fragrant and cordial, ſo that it is the better to aromatize the ſtomack, and to refreſh nature weakned, and againſt the fainting and great weakneſſe of the ſpirits, wherein the tincture of roſes hath a great vertue comfortative.
                     Yet let not the Surgeons Mate be diſcouraged though he have not Acetum roſarum, for acetum vini, or wine vinegar, will ſerve well in place thereof; and yet 'tis better if you have Roſe-water to infuſe therein upon occaſion of uſing the odour thereof; or for to be applied to the ſtomack againſt vomiting, or imbecillity of the ſame. In other caſes the one may ſtand for the other very well, as alſo for thoſe griefs.
                  
                  
                     Acetum vini.
                     VVIne Vinegar helpeth the unnatural ſwellings of the belly, as alſo cureth the fluxes of the ſtomack, the parts grieved being fomented

therewith: it ſtayeth the inordinate menſtrual fluxes, the region of the liver or the bearing parts fomented therewith warm; namely with ſtupes wet therein. It is good againſt vomiting, the ſtomack outwardly fomented with warm ſtupes wet therein: It alſo diſcuſſeth and diſſipateth violent hot tumors in their beginnings; yea, even thoſe which are named Panaritiae, or, as ſome term them, fellons. Good wine-vinegar excelleth, uſed in Cataplaſmes, as alſo in ſomentations, where anodine Medicines are to be uſed, provided the place be not excoriated; as namely, in Hernia humorali. With bean-meal, and oyl of Roſes, it is a preſent help being well applied, with apt truſſings, and good care had. In the falling down of the fundament it is approved good, ſometimes with wine uſed warm to foment the part withall; as alſo to be caſt on bricks to receive the fume thereof. In the hot Gout, and in all inflammations, as the Roſe, or Ignis ſacer, or (as ſome call it) Saint Antonies fire, by way of fomentation with wine vinegar, it is a precious help; as alſo made into a ſirrupe with honey, then termed Oximel; or with Sugar, then termed Oxiſaccatum; it is very convenient to a weak ſtomack; for it cauſeth appetite, and is a help to digeſtion, given ℥ i. or ℥ ii. at once, for it cutteth away flegme and refreſheth nature, and corroborateth the ſtomack; alſo by way of a Gar geriſme, it is an approved remedy againſt Squinantia anginae, or any of the ſudden inflammations of Collumelle, or the Amygdales of the throat; and if Roſes be put therein, it is good for all the aforeſaid uſes, yet more, better, and maketh the vinegar much more Cordial: It is very queſtionable, whether wine vinegar be of temperament hot or cold, conſidering the different effects thereof, for I ſhould not doubt to give reaſonable content to any unpartial Artiſt, that it doth both the effects of a hot and cold medicine, proving it both by authority and practice to be hot and cold; yea, even by Galen himſelf, Teſie cap. 6. lib. prim. ſimpl: med. & cap. 20. ejuſdem lib.

                     SPirit of wine of all vegetables is the moſt precious thing; it is the trueſt of all Cordials: the particular vertues whereof, to be duly handled, would fill a great Volume; It is called, as is ſaid, Spiritus vini, quaſi Spiritus vitae; and the ſacred Scriptures teſtifie that wine makes glad the heart of man, wherefore there needs no further argument to expreſſe it to be a true Cordial. It is odoriferous and of a pleaſant taſt: It extracteth out Tinctures from every medicinal ſubject,
                     It preſerveth the body from putrefaction, and in every cold oppreſſion of Nature it is a true helper; for the cough, and all diſtillations of rheumes and fluxes, it is a perfect help: It comforteth the ſtomack, and provoketh appetite.
                     It helpeth thoſe which are thick of hearing, one drop daily put into the ear.
                     It preſerveth a man in health, if every morning and evening he take certain drops thereof; and defendeth the body that taketh it, from the oppreſſion of infectious aires, and (being ſick) almoſt in any diſeaſe, it may ſafely be given as a true reſtorative medicine. All ſorts of

the Cordial ſtrong waters recited, for ſo much as they contain of ſpirit of wine in them, as is ſaid, become thereby (if not otherwiſe Cordial indeed; for take from them the ſpirit of wine they contain, and the remainder is not worth the room in a glaſſe. Much might here to good purpoſe be taught of the true uſe of the Spirit of wine for the cure of wounds, ulcers, fiſtula's, and many other infirmities, if time would ſerve, which for brevities ſake, I purpoſely pretermit at this time.
                  
                  
                     Spirit of Vitriol.

                     Spirit of Terebinthine.
                     THis ſpirit of Terebinthine is a ſubtile, volatile, pure, and a Chryſtalline ſpirit exttacted from Terebinthina, which how much the more noble the ſubject is, ſo much the more excellent will the ſpirit be. It hath many precious vertues medicinable contained in it; for it is wholly combuſtible, penetrative, of a warming and comforting faculty: it is a good menſtrum to draw Tinctures by, either from vegetable or minerall medicines, and chiefly it is to extract the Tincture from Sulphur, which Tincture is a ſingular good medicine many wayes, as in his proper place I mean to touch. This ſaid ſpirit is a true balſame in the cure of all new wounds, eſpecially of the ſinewes. It comforteth all the ſinewie parts of the body afflicted with any cold impreſſion, as convulſions, the Scurvy, or the like. It provoketh urine very well if 10. or 12. drops be taken in wine faſting, and drives out gravel and the ſtone. It is alſo good to conſolidate any inward wound penetrating into the body, a few drops thereof daily drunk. It is a fit addition for any Unguent ſerving for a cold diſeaſe to amend the warming force thereof, and to cauſe it to penetrate the better. It hath many other ſingular good uſes, which for brevitie I muſt paſſe over.
                  
                  
                     The white Cauſtick.
                     THis kind of Cauſtick taketh his vertue from the vegetable ſalt it contains, and may well be carried in the Cheſt, for that it will laſt well an Eaſt-India Voyage, with (ſome times) the addition of a little capital lees, as need ſhall require; namely, when it groweth too hard. It is altogether as ſafe and ſure as the Cauſtick ſtone, but not ſo ſwift in working, neither ſo well to be ruled; for it will often ſpread three times as wide as it is intended, if it be not warily prevented: which thing is dangerous to the Patient, and diſgraceful to the Artiſt. Wherefore if I had capital lees I would rather boyle up the Cauſtick ſtone; but then again, except the Surgeons Mate know the true height of boyling it, and can cut it into pieces one half inch long (as is ſaid) and with

one of the ſaid pieces held in his one hand can perforate the apoſtume, otherwiſe it is all one with the former white Cauſticks for being laid on, it will become liquid as the other. It is not ſufficiently ſafe to cut a hole, (as the uſe is) in a ſpread emplaſter, of the bigneſſe he would have his orifice, and ſo lay it on, and cover it with a like emplaſter; for that this courſe cannot hinder the ſpreading thereof; but if he will work ſurely after that faſhion, I mean with any potential cauſtick medicine, let him cut from a roll of ſome ſoft emplaſter that will cleave well, a piece of one ounce in weight, or thereabout, and make of it two long rolles, laying one on each ſide the place of the apoſtume appointed to be pierced, bringing them at each end together, for the ends of a cauſtick inciſion ought to be narrow, and the middeſt broad, if it be artificial; at leaſt twice as long as broad is a good form, and rather more. Regard alſo that your inciſion be made (as near as may be) according to the length of the fibres and muſcles, and alwayes that it be ſo made, that one end be more dependent then the other: But in Bubo's of the emunctories, it will ſeldom fall out ſo, for that you are conſtrained to follow the form of the tumour, which commonly lieth thwart, chiefly in venereal Bubo's in inguine, or the groine. Likewiſe if the tumour be full, and the Patient in great pain, you ſhall do him great eaſe by piercing the Esker in the middeſt, ſo ſoon as it is made, to diſcharge ſome of the matter. But note this as a general rule, never preſſe out the matter too forcibly, nor take too much at once out. For howſoever you may juſtly alledge and conceive, it is putrid and offenſive matter; yet know, it containeth natural colour, and ſome ſpirits, and any ſudden evacuation thereof will weaken and perhaps overthrow your Patient. Wherefore except ſome extraordinary cauſe urge you thereto, force not much matter from a ſuppurated Apoſtume, but leave that work to nature onely, and hinder not the due courſe thereof, by the fooliſh uſe of ſtopping the orifice with a tent; for ſo thou ſhalt become an enemy to thy Patient, and not onely hinder his natural help (far above thy artificial help) but alſo uncharitably thou wilt choke him up in his own excrements; which beware of. And for the furthering the fall of an Esker in an Apoſtume, where nature hath a breathing, it is meer folly, as I have ſaid in other place. The longer it lyeth on, the better I like the work, and if you would uſe all the art you can, you cannot keep on an Esker at your will: wherefore forget that work till it be done to thy hand.
                     I have much (in my good will) to write of this ſubject, namely, of the manner of preparation, keeping, and ſundry ſorts of applycation of the ſame cauſtick, and divers other neceſſary inſtructions of the ſeveral uſes of the ſame medicine in divers parts of Chirurgery, as well as in the opening of tumours, but my haſt calleth me to the next: Wherefore at this time I crave pardon.

                     THeſe three ſeveral names of oyles, or different medicines, according to that Intend in the Surgeons Cheſt, are but one and the ſame medicine. A better balme then which, to heal new wounds, the Surgeons Mate need not deſire to learn or know. Some Writers call it by the name of Oleum Hipericonis cum gummis, ſome, Oleum Aparici, ſome, Balm Artificial. The compoſition whereof (with the reſt) ſhall follow.
                     It is beſt to be uſed in wounds, as hot as the Patient can endure it, and for the firſt time rather hotter. It is a ſure medicine for all venemous wounds, all bitings of mad doggs, or of venemous worms, very hot applyed, and the parts about anointed therewith warm; remembring in all venemous griefs a Cordial is alſo requiſite. In my own practice it is almoſt all the unctious medicine I ever uſe, for the curing of wounds and contuſions; and I never repented my ſelf of the uſe thereof. In piercing wounds and ſtabs it is a medicine a Surgeon may well relye on; it will not diſgrace him. It is a very comfortable medicine againſt all pains, aches, and witherings of the outward limbs proceeding of cold cauſes, uſing it warm with good friction, and a plaiſter of Burgundy pitch ſpread on leather and applyed thereon; or rather Empl. Stipticum Paracelſi.

                     Extract. Catholicon purgans.
                     THis extract is a laxative medicine (being drawn from the moſt excellent of vegetable laxative ingredients) fitting to be ever ready at hand in a Surgeons Cheſt, or elſe where in Surgery. The doſe is ſmall, namely, 15. grains at the moſt: the taſt pleaſant, not nauſeous nor bitter at all; neither cauſing tortions, nor gripings in the bowells: It is a medicine that will keep good for ſeven years without putrefaction, the vertues whereof have been by the Author (for many years well experienced) both at Sea and Land approved of. Now for that it is the honour of every expert Artiſt, Cito, tutè, & jucundè ſanare; that is, quickly, ſafely, and pleaſantly to perform his ſcope in the comforting and curing of his patient, I have therefore thought fit to recommend the uſe hereof to the Surgeon, to be practiſed by him, as well in military, as Domeſtick occaſions.
                     
                        
And this medicine that here I commend to the reader, anſwereth fitly thoſe fornamed attributes, by reaſon of his gentle and eaſie operation in ſafe purging per ſeceſſum, or downward; It exceedeth other purgatives therein, the doſe being duly obſerved; for it purgeth the head, the ſtomack, the belly and liver of all groſſe offending humours, either flegmatick, cholerick, or melancholy; alſo it purgeth watty and ſlimy humours, and taketh away the chollick or gripings of the bowels; and withall, it comforteth the ſtomack; yea, any child, or woman with child, may ſafely take hereof. It is beſt to be taken faſting in a morning, and to eat in three hours after the receipt thereof, onely the party may take drink, or rather (which were beſt) warm broth, or in want thereof poſſet drink, or beer for a need ſomewhat warmed; and the party that taketh it; were beſt he keep within his Chamber, and not to ſleep in the time of the working of the medicines; but if he goeth out, urged by his neceſſities, being careful to keep himſelf warm he is in no danger thereby, although I confeſſe to keep in were better.
                     And whereas Paracelſus ſaith, that every good laxative medicine, ought to contain in general three operations or faculties as proper to it; namely, Firſt, that it purge nature without offence of danger; Secondly, that it ſtrengthen nature being debilitated or weakned; Thirdly, that it do comfort nature; yet the ſaid Author is of opinion, and that juſtly, that the excellency of purgative medicines is not alwayes to be judged of by the numbers of ſtools it provoketh, but much more for the Artanum thereof, or hidden ſpecifical power it hath in the curing and rooting out of diſeaſes, although they be inveterate.
                     And moreover this medicine is very ſafe to be given in caſes of the plague, or ſmall pox, where, and when, by advice a purge is fitting to be given.

                     THis conpoſition was heretofore appointed by the Doctors of the Phyſitions Colledge in London, as a thing very requiſite, for that the price ſhould be reſonable for the poorer ſort, the ingredients thereof being nevertheleſſe Cordial, and yet ſuch as are eaſie to get. It may be uſed well in place of Mithridate: and in truth I had rather put

my ſelf upon it, as a good Cordial, being freſh made, then upon the Mithridate we buy from beyond the Seas; for it is by the Hollanders ſo uncharitably ſophisticated that a man may fear to take it in his need: my ſelf chanced in Holland into the houſe of a Bore (as they term him) to lodge, who lived by making of Mithridate and Treakel, he confeſſed to me, his Mithridate had but nine ſimples in it: he had alſo pewter boxes marked ſo artificially as no man could diſcover them to be other then right Venice ones.
                     I have appointed to the Surgeons Cheſt ſome of the Species of the London Treakel ready powdered and dry, that the diligent Surgeon at his will may compoſe a London Treakel at Sea; namely, by taking hony ℥ iii. and of this powder ℥ i. and heat them together, ſtirring them well till all be incorporated, and give it as need ſhall require.

                     THis Diateſſeron is an ancient compoſition deviſed by the ancient Grecians, and had beginning from Avicen, and Meſues. or one of them; and according to the Greek word ſo named, for that it is made of four ſimples, viz. Gentian roots, Bay-berries, Myrrha, and Ariſtolachia rotanda, four precious and very Cordial ſimples, full of medicinable vertues. And for that I would have it kept in time of need, I have thought meet to have ready powdred the ſaid 4. ſimples together to be compoſed into a Treakel as occaſion ſhall move thee. Onely note this, that to one ounce of the ſaid ſpecies ℥ 3. of hony is to be added, and well mixed on the fire, and ſo it is ready for uſe. By ſome Writers this compoſition is called Theriaca ad pauperem, the poor mans Treakel.
                     The vertues of Diateſſeron are ſaid to be as follow.
                     It is good againſt poyſon drunken, and againſt the bitings of venemous beaſts or worms. It is alſo good againſt all the cold affects of the brain, as convulſions, reſolutions of the ſinews, morbum Comitialem, the Spaſme or Cramp, the inflation of the ventricle or ſtomack, againſt defect of concoction therein, and againſt venemous wounds both inwardly drunk, and outwardly applied. Alſo it openeth the obſtructions of the liver and ſpleen, thereby preſerveth the body from the diſeaſe called Cachexia or ſtomacace, which is the Scurvy.

But the cauſe why I have not appointed this good compoſion, nor any of the three laſt mentioned Philoniums to the Surgeons Cheſt (though I know them to be good medicines) is, becauſe they will not keep an Eaſt-India voyage; and Laudanum opiale Paracelſi is ſufficient for ought the other can do: Wherefore I reſt ſatisfied therewith.

is not alwayes by ſuch light cordials and gentle laxatives removed: their doſe agreeth with that of Pilulae Aureae, they are very ſtomachal, for they refreſh much the ſtomack, and in any oppreſſions of the ſtomack where gentle purging is required, they excell.

Oſwaldus Crollius, a moſt learned late Writer, hath ſet down this onely purge for the cure of the Podagra, giving it this breif commendation. It purgeth ſafely and gently all podagrical defluctions: and in truth, whoſoever ſhall have occaſion of the uſe thereof, will have cauſe to commend it, and knowing it, will find ſmall need of Pulvis Hollandicus or Pulvis ſanctus, whoſe doſe at ſea muſt be at the leaſt two drames, being nauſeous and unſavoury, whereas ʒ ſs. of this will do as much with great facility, and without tortions or gripings of the guts, which other compoſitions cauſe. I uſe to give it to ſtrong bodies in white wine, to weaker in ſack; but at ſea for a need it may be given in fair water, and ſome ſirupe to help the taſt thereof, which neveretheleſſe is not ungrateful of it ſelf.

                  OF WOƲNDS.
                  
                     A Wound is a recent ſolution of a continuity; or a diviſion of that which was knit together, without putrefaction; andDefinition of a wound. is common as well to the ſoft and organick parts, as alſo to the harder: it may (though ſeldom it doth) ariſe from an internal cauſe, as the malice of bad humours; but more commonly it comes from an external cauſe, namely, by the violence of ſome inſtrument. For which cauſe a wound is ſaid to differ in his denomination: for ſometimes it is called a thruſt or punction, which is made by ſtabbing with any thing ſharp pointed, as a Dagger, Rapier, or theThe divers appellations of wounds. like: ſometimes it is named a Contuſion, when by a weighty thing offending (as timber) falling down, or violently caſt down (as a ſtone) the fleſh is bruiſed and broken: ſometimes alſo it hath the appellation of Inciſion, or inciſed wound, for that it is done by an edged inſtrument, as a knife or ſword. And theſe wounds are either ſimple or compound: the ſimple are onely in the upper skin or fleſh, without detriment or loſſe of ſubſtance, which alſo have their ſeveral ſpecies or kinds, becauſe of their divers forms; ſome being greater or ſmaller, profound or ſuperficial, long or little, ſtreight, round or crooked, of a facile cure, of difficile, or mortal. And for the ſounder judgment and better cure of all wounds, (which are either external, or internal and penetrating) there are ſeveral ſignes (of ancient tradition) with much diligence to be had in remembrance, which daily practice alſo verifieth.
                  The ſeveral differences of all external wounds are diſcerned by ſight or handling.
                  
                     The places of internall wounds. Thoſe which are termed internal and penetrating wounds, are either in the head, breaſt, or inferiour venter, and are diſcovered likewiſe by ſight, by feeling, or by ſearching with an inſtrument into them.
                  The hurt or ruption of the membranes or brain is accompanied with ſneeſing, vomitting, bleeding at the noſe or eares▪ raving and the like: but if the ſubſtance of the brain be hurt, thoſe ſignes are encreaſed, and a bilious or ſharp vomitting is ſeen; alſo a fever, dull underſtanding, with alteration of favour and countenance do enſue; ſtupidity alſo and dumbneſſe ſignifie the brain contuſed.
                  The breaſt is obſerved to be wounded and penetrated, when aire commeth forth of the wound, or when the perſon ſick hath in his mouth a ſenſe of the things applied to his grief.
                  It appeareth that the lungs are hurt, if the reſpiration be difficult, a

a ratling ſound in breathing be heard, and the excrement which is voided from the mouth be ſpumous, pale, and crude.
                  The Pericranium hurt hath ſometimes ſudden and often ſwounding for a ſign, though ſome nevertheleſſe having the Penicranium wounded or contuſed, have no evil ſymptomes extraordinary to other mean wounds of other parts.
                  The Heart wounded hath the refrigeration of all the parts, extinction of natural heat, and death attending thereon.
                  If the great Veins and Arteries in the breaſt be offended, and immoderate flux of blood, defection of vertue in all the faculties, a cold and an unſavoury ſweat doth enſue, and death within a few hours.
                  The ſolution of continuity in the ſinewie parts of the Diaphragma, cauſeth convulſion, difficile reſpiration, an acute fever, raving, and death: but if the fleſhy part onely be agrieved, it is capable of remedies, and ſuffereth not ſuch dangerous ſymptomes.
                  If the recurrent Nerves be wounded, there followeth loſſe of ſpeech immediate motion and ſenſe alſo is ſuppreſſed, and that without recovery.
                  In the wounds of the Liver appear vomiting, bloody dejections, much pain, a continual fever; and if they be deep, fainting, reſolution of the ſpirits, cold ſweat and death follow,
                  The Spleen offended is as the Liver affected, ſave that the ſymptoms are in the right ſide, the other in the left.
                  The Ventricle is demonſtrated to be wounded by the voiding of chylus, frequent vomiting, ſwounding, fainting, and death.
                  When the excrements are retained in the belly, and iſſue out of the wound very unſavoury and putrefied, and hot by the natural place, it is plain that the inteſtines are hurt,
                  The ſign of the Reins or Kidnies wounded, is the ſuppreſſion of urine which cauſeth a ſore pain in the groine and teſticles, with inflation or ſwelling even to death.
                  The accidents of the Bladder offended are one with the reines, unleſſe the ſinewie parts thereof be grieved, and then diſtention of the belly, piſſing of blood, vomiting, voiding of urine at the wound, ſuppreſſion of the faculties, doting, and death follow.
                  When Spinae Medulla, or the Marrow of the back bone is hurt, there followeth the reſolution of the ſinewes (which hindereth the function of the ſenſe and motion) voluntary evacuation of excrements appear, and for the moſt part death is the immediate concluſion.
                  The ſolution of a Veine is known by blood of red colour and thick ſubſtance.
                  The teſtimony of an Artery hurt, is blood ſomewhat yellow, ſubtie, thin, hot, beating and leaping, or violently iſſuing, and as it were by jumps.
                  The Tendons, Membranes, and Ligaments wounded or inciſed, bring the ſame ſymptomes as the Nerves do.
                  
                     The Cure.
                     
                        Wherein the cure of wounds in general doth conſiſt. THe Cure of wounds is either by the help of nature or medicine: if by nature, the ſtrife is at an end, the Artiſt may ſave a labour: if

by medicine their cure conſiſteth both in the reduction of parts diſjoyned and diſlocated to union, and in conſolidation and true conglutination of them: therefore it ſhall be neceſſary to conſider, that if any thing hinder conſolidation it be removed: that reduct on be rightly and skilfully wrought, leſt the parts adjoyned fall into relaps, and that the ſubſtance of the part with his natural temperament be conſerved: and laſtly, that the ſymptoms be prevented, and carefully cured as they ariſe.
                     The firſt intention in curing of wounds is to take away whatſoever is beſides nature, as Iron, wood, lead, or ought elſe with fit inſtruments, and that without pain (if it may be) to the diſeaſed, that conſolidation may the better be effected. In wounds▪ of the head, to take away the hair, or what elſe might ſeem to hinder the good application of medicines to the grief, is the firſt part. Strive alſo to ſet well the veins and nerves diſplaced, that the beauty and due office of the member be not diminiſhed, and that it may conglutinate the eaſier, and being united, keep them ſo by Ligature, future, and other due and artificial means.
                     It is requiſite alſo that the natural temperament of the part be carefully preſerved: and that is done by a certain carefull regiment of the body, which is univerſal or particular.
                     The univerſal regiment conſiſteth in purging medicines, as Potions, Gliſters, a ſober and frugal dyet, abſtinence from wine, venery, and all kinds of meats which may move or attenuate humours, and moderate uſe of good nouriſhing ſuſtenance, all which helps the poor Sea-man is not capable of in long voyages.
                     The particular Regiment is in remedies which confirm and ſtrengthen the natural heat of the member debilitated, and which hinder and avert fluxion: ſuch are Unguentum Nutritum diapalma, I mean Diacalſithios diſſolved in Oyl of Roſes, Ceratum Refrigerans, Roſat. Meſſue. Ungu. de minio, or the like.
                     The general accidents moſt to be feared that affect the wounded are Haim rrea, dolour, tumour intemperature, a fever, faintneſſe of the heart, convulſions, ſpecially where a ſinew is wounded.
                     
                        The cure of Ha morrea. 
                        Haimorrea, or flux of blood is ſtayed by medicaments aſtringent, fitted and applyed with convenient future or ligature; and ſometimes by medicines cauſtik, either actual or potential, touched in the Treatiſe of amputation or diſmembring.
                     A Tumour is an unnatural increaſe, exceeding the natural ſtate in the body, and inducing an offence of the actions of the ſame, the cure whereof is touched elſewhere.
                     Intemperature is either over much heat or cold, & his remedy is by oppoſites, as namely, to too hot imtemperature (apply a cold medicament &c.
                     The intemperature of the Liver chiefly conſiſteth in oppilation or debility of the faculties thereof, and is helped chiefly by wholſome nutriment: the lamentable want whereof at Sea, is the cauſe of many the grievous obſtructions, and other evil effects in Seamens bodies: ſo that ofttimes a good Artiſt ſhall not be able to heal a mean excoriation.
                     The Accidents common to the wounded heart, as is ſaid, are ſwounding, palpitation thereof, a hot burning fever, and many other.
                     
                        
                        Syncope is a ſolution of the ſpirits which forſake the heart, whoſe remedy is Cordials, if God have appointed life.
                     A Fever is a heat in the heart more then natural, infuſed and diſperſed through the whole body, whoſe cure is by purging, bleeding, and good government.
                     A convulſion is a dangerous diſeaſe of the brain, which often-times is a fore-runner or a meſſenger of death.
                     The diſeaſes in the brain are either in the membranes, ſubſtance, or ventricles, and paſſages thereof; whoſe ſpecies and ſymptoms are many, and for the moſt part very dangerous, and of difficult cure: For if the ſubſtance of the brain be offended, the functions thereof are impedited, whence proceedeth doting, melancholly, fooliſhneſſe, ſlothfulneſſe, Lithargie, frenzie, madneſſe, loſſe of memory, deadiſh ſleep, giddineſſe, apoplexie, Paralyſis, and divers other like accidents formerly recited. And if the ventricles of the brain be wounded, then the motions and ſenſes thereof be grieved. Wherefore for the better cure of theſe wounds in the brain, deſiccation and cicatrization in due time is needful, either by ſimple medicaments, (as Spiritus vini, b

                        Divers Accidents will have divers medicaments. And as you ſee the accidents of the wounded are divers, ſo the remedies are not all alike: but ſome are general, others more peculiar
                     Thoſe that are onely in the skin or fleſh have no difficile cure: for oft-times Nature with ſome eaſie remedy, or a Ligature onely doth help them: but thoſe that are compound, offending many parts, need a methodical and convenient order of curation, which is divers, as is ſaid, according to the diverſity of the parts affected: for if contuſion or ruption be onely of the fleſh under the skin, there is required conſolidation by eaſie comfortation, and deſiccation; and no ſuppuration, which is effected onely by nouriſhing and preſerving the natural heat or humidity of the member, as in other wounds.
                     But a contuſed wound, if it be be great, requireth purging Gliſters, potions, or pils, phelbotomie, a wholſome dyet, perfect evacuation of the humour that commeth from the veins, and ſuppuration of the contuſed and livid fleſh; which two laſt, are affected at the firſt by mean remedies; as oyl of roſes and mirtles, & ſometimes by a Paracelſus plaiſter. It will deſire alſo ſuppurating medicines, fitting the greatneſſe and nature of the contuſion. It may be healed in the manner of an apoſtume; and if putrefaction be feard, the uſe of a good Lixivium, of cupping Glaſſes, and light ſcarification, is moſt neceſſary, that the humour about to putrifie may be evacuated, ſo ſhall the wound be better cured: but when the wound ſhall be with loſſe of ſubſtance, then let thy endeavour be (by renovation and regeneration of the ſubſtance diminiſhed, or the intemperatureAnother note for the removing of that which is beſides nature in a wound. carefully by convenient digeſtive medicines to produce laudable quitture, and that the part affected be kept in his natural temperament and faculty, for thereby it doth concoct & digeſt the matter flowing unto it; as alſo conſider diligently the excrements of the wounds, their ſubſtance,

                        How to cure venomous wounds, which are either internal or external. The cure of wounds cauſed through the biting of venomous beaſts (as mad doggs, ſcorpions, vipers, ſerpents, bees, fiſhes, waſpes, hornets, ſwine, or other the like, is performed firſt by taking away that which is virulent, extracting, diſſipating and conſuming the poyſon; which work requireth internal as well as external medicaments. The internal muſt be ſuch as comfort and confirm the parts diſeaſed (as Theriaca, Aurum vitae, Confectio Alkermes, Bole Armenick, Conſerve of Borage, Bugloſſe, Roſemary flowers, and the like) that ſo the virulent vapour may be aboliſhed, which otherwiſe will infect the whole body. The external muſt alſo intend to extinguiſh the venomous vapour (and ſuch are cupping glaſſes and ſcarification, alſo all hot medicaments attracting, as Galbanum, Ammoniacum, Bdellium, Emplaiſtrum Diachilon and divinum, a fomentation made with the herb Dragon and Mugwort boiled in wine, Triacle, Garlick, Onions, Fimus columbinus, and the like) which being done, the cure ſhall be after the manner of other wounds of the ſame magnitude: but in mine own practice, I heat Balm artificial feething het, and apply it for the firſt dreſſing, if I fear venome: and if I fear a Gangreen, I uſe Aegyptiacum as hot as may be, and over the wound I apply a Lixivium: ſlender and wholeſome dyet is alſo good, that may neither increaſe melancholy, nor heat much the blood; and abſtain from bleeding, unleſſe the noble parts be tainted, & then thou maiſt not ſafely purge, but rather ſweat, which is beſt known when the animal faculties are offended.
                     
                        The cure of wounds in the arteries. The wounds in the Veins and Arteries, bring with them commonly a flux of blood, which to ſtay is a ſpecial buſineſſe, conſiſting chiefly of aſtringent remedies, good application, future, ligature of a vein or artery, if it may be done conveniently, and ſometimes cauſtick medicaments; yea, inciſion, phlebotomy, the uſe of cupping glaſſes and ligature on the parts oppoſite; which three laſt are not alwayes to be preſumed upon as ſafe courſes, but upon need, if ſo be the vein or artery wounded be great: many things are of force put in practice, which otherwiſe ſeem very harſh.

Now after that the flux of blood is ſtayed, let the ſick party be contained in a place neither too hot nor too cold, and dark, ſpeaking little, that the cure may be accompliſhed with more eaſe to the patient.

But if pain and inflammation be in ſuch wounds neer to an article or joynt, apply a cataplaſme made of bread crums, with the juyce of Hyoſchyami, or cool herbs, or Ung. nutritum, populeon album, or ſome of thoſe, that the burning heat may be extinguiſhed; or of oat-meal ſodden in water with a little oyl: But if convulſion happen to a ſinew wounded or pricked, cut off all the ſinew, for if the nerve ſhall be wholly abſciſed, leſſer ſymptomes, through impotency and deprivation of action enſue, then if the middle or any part be wounded: the cure (and note it) is not ſo ſafe to ſew it up together, as ſome think, becauſe his adunation is uncertain.
                     
                        The cure of a nerve contuſed. If a ſinew be contuſed without any wound, let it be corroborated by medicaments ſtrengthening and aſtringent. The cure of the wounds of the head is not alwayes to be preſumed upon, though ſmall, nor yet deſpaired of, though great. Conſider therefore diligently whether the brain it ſelf be hurt or no; if the brain be offended, it is to be known partly by the inflammation, dolour, apoſtumation, retraction, convulſion or deprivation of the functions of the ſenſes, and death alſo is ſuſpected preſently, or within a few dayes to follow: and if the palſie poſſeſſe the oppoſite part, it being ſound and whole, it is doubtful, and the ſympathie of parts will cauſe oft-times an abſceſſe in the Liver and Meſſenterium, and an intemperature of the vitall faculty, with a continual fever and death. It ſhall therefore be neceſſary for the

wiſe artiſt to know the manner of the hurt, that he may wiſely prognoſticate the danger: for if only the Pericran. be hurt by inciſion, without any contuſion, and far from the commiſſures or ſeames, it is not dangerous at all to be cured, and the cure to be wrought, is as in other wounds: but if it be much wounded by punction or contuſion, and ſymptoms ariſe with a tumour in the head, then dilatation is needfull, that the contuſed blood which is between the Cranium and the Pericranium may be extracted; and let it be quickly done, ſo ſhal the ſymptoms ceaſe and the cure will be eaſie: but and if the offence of the Pericranium be in the ſuture or ſeam, it is more dangerous, becauſe the brain doth ſympathize with it. If the Fibres paſſing through the ſutures of the Pericranium from Dura mater be wounded or contuſed, it exceeds the other in danger; therefore to reſiſt putrefaction, let the wound be mundified: and if no fracture of the bone be (the wound appearing only in the fleſh, without any offence of the Pericranium) the cure ſhall be as in other wounds.

Sometimes there is onely a depreſſion and then a levatory inſtrument wil excuſe the uſe of a trapan, and take away the ſpils and fragments which are upon the membrane & the blood alſo which ſhal iſſue out upon the ſame may by a ſpunge be taken away: keep it likwiſe from cold, and of a temperate heat, and the place hurt being well cleanſed, poure mel roſarum warm into the wound, or 2 parts of hony, and one part of oyl or ſyrup of drie roſes, or common hony with turpentine, with the yolk of an eg, which are remedies mundifying, and grateful to the membranes, and ought to be applied warm, but above all others the linament of Arceus is the chiefeſt balſom for wounds in the head. The general remedies for wounds of the head muſt neither overmuch refrigerate, nor overmuch calefie, but be of a moderate or temperate calour. The general manner to proceed to the cure of the wounds in the head, is as followeth.

and ready to do wondrous help in the cure of the head. For the ſecond application, have ready of the noble linament of Arceus, never ſufficiently commended, and being ſomewhat hotter then the partie would willingly bear it, annoint the wound therewith in each place, with a little ſoft lint on a Probes end, leaving the ſaid lint therein, and with plegents of lint drie fil up the orifice, & after anointing about the edges of the grief, apply a plaiſter, either of Emplaſt. Betonicae, Stipticum Paracelſi, Minium, Mellilote. or Diacalſitheos. In want of Arceus linament you may take oleum roſarum, and mel roſarum, which are not much inferior to the former, being warm applied; ſome uſe therewith alſo a digeſtive of Turpentine, and the yolk of an eg well mixed, ana alike quantitie, wherewith they ſpread plegents, and then dip them in the warm mel and oyl mentioned, and ſo apply them, which is very good and the moſt ancient practice in curing wounds of the head.
                     In want of oyl of Roſes oyl of Olive will do wel, and common hony for mel roſarum, though not ſo well: and if cauſe be, ſome Artiſts mix ſpirit of wine, or good aqua vitae with the former medicine, and it comforteth wel the brain, and very much furthereth good and ſpeedy healing: good bowlſtring, and ligatu re doe much avail to the cure of the head: alſo it is good to keep the partie lying and in a dark place, till the greateſt danger of accidents be paſt, remembring withall that the overſtrict keeping him in, may alſo be very offenſive to the ſick.
                     Let good diet ſtrictly be obſerved, if occaſion be, and the uſe of Gliſters likewiſe upon good reaſons is alſo to be approved; and it is good to open the Cephalike vain if the brain have been long uncovered, or yield a ſpumous white and thick excrement, which ſeems to be a portion of the ſubſtance of the brain: likewiſe to purge the body, mundifie the wound, and corroborate the brain with Cordials, and fomenttations fitting, the chiefeſt is good wine and hony to foment with; but I ſeldome uſe any Fomentations my ſelf, having cured divers Fractures in the Cranium without any Fomentations at all; for the uſe of them at Sea, I know is troubleſome and dangerous, except greatDiligent obſervation of the accidents of a wound required. cauſe. Be careful alſo to obſerve the danger of thewound, according to the accidents thereof; for if it be little and ſuperficial, it is cured as an other wound, but if it pierce the ſecond table, it muſt not be paſſed lightly over; for if you be occaſioned to uſe the Trapan, it is to be applied the third, fourth, or fifth day after the hurt at the fartheſt; but the choice of the day is not material, as ſome ſuppoſe, where there is apparant neceſſitie, except on the day of the full of the Moon, and then there is danger more then at other times, but neceſſitie hath no rules,
                     The cure of wounds in the face, would if it were poſſible be done without a cicatrice, but that cannot be performed without a drie ſtitch with alſo a moſt artificial, & convenient binding the lips of the wound together with alſo a ſure natural balm: wherefore I will not ſtand to teach the drie ſtitch here, for it is not proper at ſea, it fits the land bettet. In the work of ſuture or ſtitching, take heed that the skin and fleſh be not overthick which you take up with your needle, and let not your ſtitches be too cloſe. A true ligature of the face is ſomewhat

difficult to be performed, becauſe of the cavities thereof, which are to be filled with linnen clothes, or tow, or lint, the better to keep the ligature to the wound.
                     
                        Where ligature is needfull. The Noſe and Eare wounded require good and carefull ligature, and Emplaſters that will cleave faſt to the grief.
                     The wounds of the eyes are dangerous by reaſon of their affinity, as well with the Pericranium as the other Membranes of the brain, ſo that they are for the moſt part full of bitter pain, cauſing loſſe of ſight: wherefore by Gliſters, bloud letting, cupping Glaſſes, Purgations, and ſober diet, the accidents are to be ſtayed. The medicines outwardly which I have uſed ever with good ſucceſſe, are the artificial Balm with fine lint warm applied on the eye lids, and a Paracelſus plaſter over that, and therewith I have done great cures in wounds of the eyes; but I never dropt any medicine into the eye it ſelf.

                     The cures of the arm are ſometimes dangerous, chiefly if the bone, and ligaments, or the muſcles with veins and nervs be inciſed thwart; let the remedies therefore be ſuch, as are proper and agreeable to the nerves; as namely, the artificiall Balm very warm applied, and a Paracelſus plaſter with ligature fitting.
                     But if the hands be wounded, and the tendous ligaments, and ſinewie parts thereof offended, divers abſceſſes in many places, with Inflammations appear ſometimes, and exceeding ſore: Sometimes pains ariſe, which may occaſion the uſe of purgations, blood-letting, anodine medicaments, and a ſpare wholſome diet.

                     The wounds of the Thorax external, ſuffer to be covered with fleſh and to be healed as other wounds; but wounds that penetrate the inward patts are dangerous; namely, if any great quantitie of bloud lie in the capacitie of the Thorax, which cannot be evacuated by the wound; but if it can be evacuated there is hope, otherwiſe it is deſperate▪ Alſo, if the blood may be extracted, and no internall part ſeem hurt, heal up the wound and be careful the aire get not into it; but if the external orifice be litle, and the internal great, and wide, the Membrane being burſt, and a rib uncovered, as it oft times falleth out, it is to be judged incurable, and a Fiſtula will remain their continually. And if the former part of the Thorax be ſtrook thorow even to the latter, but not thorow both, if the wound be little and ſlender there is ſome hope of cure, otherwiſe not, but it is commonly paſt cure, yet neglect not thy duty, nor deſpair, for God is merciful: Let thy cure be

                     The Knee wounds alſo are cured as▪ other ſinewie parts wounded are. The ancle, foot, and ſole thereof wounded are hard of cure, becauſe there are many bones, ligaments, tendons, and finewie parts among them: they are alſo placed in the loweſt part of the body, and therefore are ſubject to defluction of humours.

The compoſition of which wounds for the moſt part conſiſts of loſs of ſubſtance, contuſion, fraction of many ſinewie fibres, veins, arteries, membranes and bones; yea, often ſhivered into divers pieces, being inThe divers form ofwounds by Gunſhot. form different, as ſome round, narrow, and wide, and in figure cuniculous, triangular, quadrangular, fiſtulous, &c. at the firſt bringing with them no Hemorrhea or flux of blood, although the veins be broken & open, the blood returning back through the fearful violence of the ſtrok. The firſt curative intention of theſe wounds is dilatation, where by the enemy to nature may by an open orifice be expeld. The ſymptoms of ſuch wounds are Hemorrea, furtive, or a ſtealing flux of blood trickling out by little and little, Gangrene unawares aſſaulting the part: alſo apoſtumation, dolour, and the like. Wherefore as an entrance to the cure, let an univerſall regiment of the ſick be carefully obſerved,

namely, that as much as is poſſible he uſe wholſome aliments, ſuch as reſiſt putrefaction (as ſowre and tart things) and which are grateful to the vital faculties: and when he eateth, let it be ſparing and often: let him drink very little wine. If you fear venemous vapours may be gathered, give him of good Mithridate, Venice Triacle 
                        ʒ ſs. or Diateſſeron 
                        ʒ ſs. Theſe rules at Sea are not ſo well to be obſerved as at Land; wherefore let the Sea-Surgeon therein do his beſt: let his ordinary drink be Ptiſans, or Barley water: conceal from him the magnitude of his wound, keep him looſe onely with Gliſters, or ſuppoſitories, let him blood if need be, and yet but a little, leſt poyſon or venome ſetled in the outward parts, be thereby drawn in back into the more noble parts: and abſtain to give him remedies calefying the humour, eſpecially at the firſt.
                     In theſe wounds often appear exudations of clammy humours, ſuppoſed by ſome to proceed from membranes, and ſinowie Ligaments bruiſed and broken, being changed from ſound to unnaturall and vicious: thoſe humours are to be evacuated, or their dangers prevented by good alterative remedies; namely, abſterſive medicines, as a good Lixivium, or by ſuppurative, mundificative, and deſiccative things having faculty of confirming and ſtrengthening the parts affected. Therefore the fear of a Gangreen being taken away, ſuppuration muſt be intended in the fleſh contuſed, but if in the parts contuſed there be a vicious humour, and the fleſh about do putrifie, in ſuch caſes it is convenient to help ſuppuration with all ſpeed.
                     But firſt of all let a good Alexipharmacon or Preſervative againſt poyſon be given the ſick, if you ſee cauſe; namely, a little Venice Triacle other Triacle on the point of as knife, if it be right and good: but if you do fear the vertue thereof to be doubtful, as often it is, give it diſſolved in ſpirit of wine, Cinamon water, or good aquavitae, whereunto add certain drops of Oyl of Vitriol, for it exceedingly reſiſteth putrefaction. You may for a need give Mithridate, London Triacle, or Diateſſeron alone: or if the party be of a cold conſtitution, then give him Diatrion piperion (or good Roſa ſolis a little. And if he be ſtrong, after he is dreſſed, you may lay him to bed to ſweat, and procure: him thereto by a doſe of Diaphoreticon given in Triacle or Mithridate, regarding, as is ſaid, that the ſick have the benefit of a natural open body; yet not many laxative ſtools for fear of danger: Let care alſo be had of his dyet, as is ſaid, ſo much as the time and place can permit. Which effected, in the next place conſider by the view, of the wound, what manner of local medicaments are moſt fit. And for the firſt intention of curing, it were fit the Surgeon at Sea were never wanting of a good Lixivium, to foment the parts percuſſed or contuſed; let it be ſuch a Lixivium as I have deſcribed in the cure of Fractures, but ſomewhat ſharper; to which for brevity I referr the Surgeons Mate. Alſo have ready Ung. Aegyptiacum, and the Cauſtick ſtone, if it may be: alſo the Artificial Balm, Oyl of Vitriol, a good Reſtrictive powder, good Ligatures of all ſorts, ſtitching needles ready, with all other fit inſtruments not far off if occaſion ſhould be, as tents, ſplints, dorſels, ſpunges, clowts,

rollers, tape, tow, lint, plaiſters ready ſpread, and the like, that when an occaſion happeneth, he might be ready to perform his duty.
                     The moſt notable differences I have ever obſerved betwixt wounds made with Gunſhot, and other contuſed wounds, is onely a furrive Hemorrage, and a dangerous diſpoſition to a Gangreen; which two accidents warily prevented, the cure of ſuch wounds differ nothing from ordinary wounds contuſed.

For dangerous wounds, Oyl of Terebinthine is very good; but Venice Terebinthine alone is much better; and common Terebinthine is not to be deſpiſed; and no more is the ordinary Digestive of Terebinthine and the yolk of an egg, of each a like quantity well mixed together.
                     And yet I would not doubt at all without all theſe recited medicines, to find ſufficient healing medicines in the Surgeons Cheſt for double the occaſion that can be imagined, which if time would permit me, I would write of.
                     
                        Directions how to prevent putrefaction to great wounds incident by

                            Gunſhot. And whereas putrefaction, as is mentioned, alwayes attendeth great wounds made with Gunſhot, all care in time is to be had to prevent the ſame. Let therefore your firſt local application, if you fear putrefaction be Unguentum Egyptiacum mixed with Wine or Sp. Vini, or alone; being alſo very hot injected into the wound, or applied on lint. And if you fear it will require yet more exſiccation or cauterization, add ſome bumt Vitriol, and foment ſomewhat the outward parts of the grief with a hot Lixivium, and apply a hot ſtupe wet in the Lixivium, and wrung out round about the member: but if the outward parts about the wound be altered in colour, or grow either ſtinking or inſenſible, make ſcarification and foment well with ſtrong hot Lixivium, and inject thereof into the wound very hot; and after ſuch fomentation, ſcarification, and injection uſed, as is ſaid, then if you yet ſee cauſe, you may uſe the former mentioned Egyptiacum, with a hot ſtupe, and remove not that dreſſing without extraordinary cauſe, I mean the Egyptiacum, in leſſe then 48. hours, but rather, if you have cauſed a good Esker. The next dreſſing after the Esker procured by the former dreſſing, it is likely you ſhall find digeſtion though imperfect, namely, durty and foul, and the wound will alſo be very tender and ſenſible, and ſubject to alteration by the ayre, if care be not had. Wherefore all things for your next intention of application being firſt ready, ere the wound be opened make a very ſhort dreſſing, and of as gentle medicines as may be. I have uſed an Arceus Linament warm, and with ſoft lint applyed, and the edges or parts neer the wound anointed therewith, and gently filled the wound with lint, then over that a Paracelſus plaiſter, and moreover a large hot ſtupe wet in a good Lixivium, and wrung out, with alſo convenient, ſoft, and

warm Ligature, which is a great help to healing.
                     The third dreſſing, I would leave Arceus Linament, and betake me to the Artificial Balme; which Balme I would apply warm, anointing the parts about therewith; applying alſo thereto ſome good emollient, diſcuſſing, anodine plaiſter; as namely, Paracelſus plaiſter I hold chief; next that I hold Emp. Betonica deſcribed by Arceus; then Diacalfithios, Minium, Gratia Dei, or Mellilote, any of which, as thy diſcretion and ſtore affords, is proper. The reſt of the Cure I refer to be proceeded in with balm and plaiſters, as is ſaid, in ordinary form: and if any looſe bones be, remove them: onely force none out before their time without great cauſe: if no bones be imagined, ſtrive not to keep the wound open, neither keep any hard tents wirhin the wound open. Many by a cuſtome keep tents to the bo, ome of the grief ſo long, till they make the diſeaſe incurable: you need not be too vigilant in keeping new wounds too long open; for the fear of putrefaction being once put away, and digeſtion procured, and no bones to come out, the ſooner you can heal, the ſafer. Many Surgeons alſo have a groſſe cuſtome of arming tents, as they term it, with precipitated Mercury, or other the like Cauſtick medicines, and put them into wounds to mundifie, and alſo the better to digeſt them, as they imagine; but I may boldly affirm, that (as is ſaid) if neither fear of a Grangrene be, neither broken bones to be taken out, there is no cauſe of any Cauſtick medicines to applyed for the curing of a new wound at no time. And I find by practice plain, that Cauſtick medicaments within ulcers or fiſtula's have no other uſe but to take away a callous ſubſtance commonly in them, to alter the viciouſneſſe of the humour, and diſpoſe the grief to a good healing; which healing after followeth chiefly by the benefit of nature, together with gentle and ſanative applications, for (ſubl

                        An admonition to Surgeons. It is a ſhamefull errour of many fooliſh Empericks ſtill to be too buſie with Cauſtick medicines: for how apparent is it that thereby they lame many, through ignorance? They will not ſee a wound incarn and red, and good fleſh to grow, but ſtraight they ſlander it of pride, and call it proud fleſh, like their own, and then muſt at the faireſt Precipitate, or Vitriolburnt go to work; yea, though the Patient be lame for it, or at the leaſt the grief put back again. Truely the abuſe of good Cauſtick medicines, bringeth much ſlander to the Art of Surgery. In the cure of Ulcers and fiſtula's and elſe where, I have noted down my opinion of the true uſe of Cauſtick medicines, to which I refer the Reader.
                     If therefore wounds happen with Gunſhot, which give no cauſe to fear a Grangrene, then begin the firſt dreſſing with Balm Artificial very hot applyed, the next dreſſing reaſonable hot, and ſo to the end of the cure, uſing emplaisters and Ligatures convenient.

                  The Cure of Apoſtumes.
                  Firſt what an Apoſtume is.
                  
                     The Definition of an Apoſtume. 
                     AN Apoſtume is a tumour compoſed of three kinds of diſeaſes, as Avieen affirmeth, namely, Intemperature, Incommoderation, and Solution of continuity, all gathered into one magnitude: and Tagaltius in his inſtitutions affirmeth, every tumour againſt nature is an Apoſtume: The differences of tumours are many, and are by many learned Writers handled at large, of which my leiſure will not permit me now to write.
                  
                     The times of an Apoſtume are four. The times of Apoſtumes are alſo at large handled learnedly by Mr. Gale, Johannes de Vigo, Ambroſe à Paris, and divers other good Writers, and are noted to be in number four, as namely, Beginning, Augmentation, State, and Declination.
                  
                     What the begining of an Apoſtume is. A good rule. The beginning of an Apoſtume is noted to be the firſt collection of humors, extraordinarily intruding into any one part of the body, at which time with the Chirurgions care, the proceeding of the diſeaſe is eaſily hindered, according to that old Poetical verſe, Principiis ob
                           ••
                        a, &c. The next time of an Apoſtume is the Augmentation, when the diſeaſe hath taken root, and is not ſo well to be put back, neither is it alwaies neceſſary nor ſafe to attempt it: for it may be nature hath determined to ſend it out, and this ſecond decree or time of an Apoſtume is ſometimes known by heat, and pulſation increaſeth a diſtemper generally of the body, and an inclining to a feaver, eſpecially if the Apoſtume be hot, or have malignity therein: but the augmentation of cold Apoſtumes have often no other ſigns notable: but onely an appearance of increaſe, without any other diſtemper of the body for a long time together.
                  
                     what the ſtate of an Apoſtume is, and the ſigns thereof. The third time or degree, which is the ſtate or ripeneſſe of the grief is well to be known divers waies, as namely, the Apoſtume by this time is come to perfect maturity, and the pain is either wholly or partly aſſwaged, and the matter being neer the skin, each child in Chirurgery may judge what is next in Art to follow, by the beating out and diſcolouring of the skin, for uſually it is diſcoloured blacker, or is very ſoft, and if the Apoſtume lye deep by feeling, you ſhall alſo ſenſibly perceive whether there be perfection of maturation or no, alſo by depreſſing the cutis a little with your finger.

                     The fourth time of an Apoſtume. The declination of Apoſtumes, I cannot ſtand to amplifie, but I refer you, as before, to Mr. Galles Inſtitution of a Chirurgion, as alſo to Johannes Vigo, and other good writers, for a more ample doctrine in that point, onely note that when the tumour or apoſtume is ripe, mine opinion is rather it be opened by a potential cauſtick medicine, then by actual inciſion, when it may be as conveniently effected, and that for many good reaſons, and one ſufficient reaſon in mine opinion is, if you uſe inciſion, you muſt needs put in tents doſſels, or the like with medicines, to keep open the orifice, and alſo to enlarge it, which doing you ſtop the paſſage of natures true evacuation twixt each dreſſing, offending the parts adjacent, and hinder the unition of the diſjoyned parts, againſt conſcience, detracting good healing: yea, and thereby hazard divers evil accidents to follow, as fiſtulaes, &c. fromCauſtick inciſion commended. all which by cauſtick inciſion you are freed, and fear not at all the application of a convenient potential cauſtick medicine in due time and place, eſpecially the impoſtume being ripe, and the skin thin, for you can pierce no further then thorow the cutis, though you would▪ for being onely thorow the skin, the matter will choak your cauſtick or corraſive medicine; neither doubt at all, that your work ſhall ſucceed otherwiſe then well, for nature will provide remedy ſpeedily, eaſily and ſafely to heal your patient: provided you be alſo careful to uſe your endeavour with good warm medicines duly applyed, and with alſo the uſe of good ligature, which is one principall good help, good diet and other reaſonable means likewiſe had, for I have ever obſerved in my practiſe, that a hot tumour in any outward part of the body, growing either by repletion, obſtruction, fever, or by the evil diſpoſition of the bloud, for the moſt part: yea, even in peſtilential and venemous Fevers in good bodies, not being pocky nor too too old, are eaſily healed by any underſtanding Artiſt, that can joyn reaſon and experience together, many ſeveral wayes, namely for one, if you perceive a beginning, or

                      of humours together in any part of the body, conſider what might be the cauſe thereof as near as you can: if you find it to be fulneſſe of the body, or coſtiveneſſe, you have divers preſent remedies that way to flye unto,Laxative Medicines fitting. 
                     viz. at the firſt make the Patient a ſuppoſitory, then give him a glyſter if need be, and a Laxative medicine, alſo according as you ſhall ſee cauſe, regarding the quality and quantity of the humour abounding: but remember where the body is coſtive, you were beſt to begin, as is ſaid, with a ſuppoſitory firſt, and that having cauſed one ſtoole, proceed with a purge, if you ſee further cauſe, or a glyſter, for often onely one ſuppoſitory doth what you require: alſo good fomentations that may by the pores of the skin help to breathe ſome part

of the matter, will do well, and ſo the reſt by diſcuſſing and mollifying medicines the eaſier be cured. If the grief begin in the head or throat you may uſe phlebotomy either under the tongue, on the forehead, or on the arm in the head vein, or median vein: but if you perceive that by emptying the body artificially, and cooling the blood with convenient medicines, as alſo anſwerable ſlender diet, and opening a vein, that the collected peccant humours will not be diſcuſſed nor put back, then may you proceed to attraction and ſuppuration as you ſee cauſe; for it were moſt groſſe to ſeek to detain that which Nature hath reſolved to caſt forth: wherefore if you ſee cauſe to bring forward any Apoſtume, you may then conſider by the quality thereof what courſe to take, namely, by attractive, alterative or ſuppurative Medicines; as touching attractive medicines, good attractives at Sea to be had are Gum Elemni of it ſelf, ſpread on lether, and

                        elſus Plaiſters applyed thick ſpread, the place firſt anointed with oyl of Lillies, will do well. But where time and place is convenient in my opinion, a mean Cataplaſme warm and thick applyed ſuppurateth beſt and eaſieſt, viz. make a decoction of Althaea roots or Line ſeeds, and the cauſe being cold, add Fenigreek a little to this decoction, adde Bean or Barley meal, oyl of Camomil, Dill and Lillies of each a ſmall quantity, Dialthaea a little, or Axungia porcina, and apply it warm, and ſhift it twice in 24 houres. Or ℞ flowers of Camomil, Mellilote and of Elders an a M. ss, Wormwood, M. ss, Althaea roots bruiſed ℥ss, make a decoction thereof in fair water a ſufficient quantity, adding of Bean meal, or Barley meal M. j. and being boyled into a due form of a Cataplaſme, adde oyl of Camomil or Dill ℥iiij. Axungia porcina ℥ij. In want of ſome one of theſe flowers another for need will ſerve, and if none of them were to be had, yet there is many other meaner helps to bring forward an Apoſtume, which time will not now permit me to rehearſe. When you have an intent to bring any tumour to ſuppuration, you muſt neither purge nor bleed your Patient, neither appoint him a thin dyet. When you would an Apoſtume ſhould go back, if it be above the navil in the breaſt, back, or head, then let your purging Medicines be ſuch as purge downward onely, but if it be below the navil, or in the arms, or legs, vomitive Medicines do beſt, except ſome eſpecial hinderances, as Aſthma or the like: And to thoſe uſes none are ſo effectual as thoſe which are of Mercury truly prepared, for that they do not only duly evacuate, but alſo divert and draw back the humours from the place offended

which in truth is a great help to nature. Alſo blood letting where occaſion is; may be uſed for diverting and mitigating a ſtubborn diſeaſe, but after the uſe of Mercurial purges it is held of many not to be good to open a vein, of which opinion I am, without extraordinary reaſon urge the contrary. And further if you intend to repel an Apoſtume you may make uſe of this following Cataplaſme of Bean meal, or wheat meal boyled with water and vinegar a convenient quantity that it be not over ſharp, adding a little Terebinthine and very warm apply it, with alſo good cloſe ligature, and ſhift, renuing the medicine every ſixth or eight hours, but obſerving as it is rehearſed, that to repel an Apoſtume ſlender diet with convenient evacuation of the belly, and Phlebotomy are as principals to be uſed. Alſo a ſafe Cataplaſme to repel an Apoſtume in the beginning is, ℞ farina fabarum or Bean flower and caſtle ſope, ana ℥j. wine vineger as much as will ſuffice, boyl theſe one quarter of an hour together, and you may mix a little water with the vinegar for fear it break the skin, and apply it warm. Note further, that to an Apoſtume broken by a cauſticke I commonly uſe no other thing then unguentum baſilicon warm, from the firſt to the end of the cure, or my artificial balm which I much rather commend upon my long experience, except ſome dreſſings now and then I apply to it onely dry lint, and if nature be not beneficial to incarn and help healing to my deſire, I uſe a gentle abſterfive medicine, namely a little precipitate mixed with the ſaid baſilicon or elſe unguentum Aegytiacum very hot, but that only for one dreſſing & one time, and then to my former courſe again for certain daies together, namely, till the Esker be faln, and at the leaſt three dreſſings after, which if it give me not good content in hope of amendment, then I proceed further one degree, namely, I uſe for one dreſſing of oleum ſulphuris per campanam, or oleum Vitrioli, with which I onely touch the Ulcer within: I alſo give a purge, thereupon if the Patient be ſtrong, and then to my old form again, till nauure be at reſt, I mean as is ſaid, till the Eskar be clean gone, and yet five or ſix daies further: but if then I ſee it be ſtill ſtubborn, I proceed to the next ſtep or degree, and crave help from my honeſt old friend Mercury who if he fail me judiciouſly applied, then I confeſs I am almoſt to ſeek, but he ſeldom failed me performance, if my Patient were not the cauſe, the diſeaſe being by Art curable. The mercurial medicine I moſt uſe in ſuch caſes you ſhal find to be rehearſed in the cures of Fiſtulaes and Ulcers.
                  If an Apoſtume be opened by a cauſtick medicine the Apoſtume of it ſelf being concavous, I mean having a great hollowneſs, going deep this way or that way, ſtrive you not at all, either with tents, plegents, or dorſſels to fil the ſaid concavities, and to divide the parts aſunder which deſire unition, but only dreſs the outward or ſuperficial part with warm baſilicon, artificial Balm or the like convenient medicine, putting it a little within the entrance of the orifice of the Apoſtume upon a little lint on the end of thy Probe, until the firſt, ſecond, and third dreſſing after the opening be paſt, and if thou have any of thy Cataplaſme remaining with which thou didſt ripen the Apoſtume, apply the ſame very warm, if not, apply ſome good

Emplaſter over it, anointing it with balm artificial, and tpplying daily thereto a good balm or baſilicon warm, and fear not if thou make thy applications warm, and uſe good rowling and boulſtring which is a principal part of the belly where thou ſeeſt cauſe, but thou ſhalt heal comforably, onely forget not if occaſion be, that ſometime thou make injection into the concavity of the Apoſtume with ſome fitting mundificative or abſterſive medicament, namely, with a fitting Lotion it will do well, but uſe it warm, and charge it not often with it, not at all except great cauſe, yet upon due occaſion if an Apoſtume turn to a moiſt watry concavous Ulcer, thou maiſt then add to thy Lotion Aegyptiacum, but be not too buſie with ſuch medicines.

For many Chirurgions never think they have played the workmen till indeed they have made work: Some by errour for want of judgment, others for baſe lucres ſake, prolonging and aggravating with things not onely contrary, but alſo dangerous to nature oftentimes, laying bare the bones, and by fouling them with their cauſtick medicines when there is no need, preſaging wickedly before hand upon unperfect grounds, bones to be foul, when to their ſhames they have made them ſo themſelves, as is ſaid, either for want of honeſty, or want of true judgment to conſider: wanting charitable and Chriſtian reaſons, or not being capable what the benefit and force of Nature is able to effect▪ whereas if they would proceed mildly, and with ſleight Medicines they might oftentimes effect far more then they do, or can. Nam natura paucis contenta, & ſublatâ causâ tollitur effectus: Nature is content with ſmall things, and the cauſe removed the accidents or effects ceaſe. I wiſh rather a Chirurgion ſhould heal gently, yea though he ſhould hazard the breaking out again of the grief, which will not eaſily be if he rationally follow the precedent method, rather then by keeping the the grief open long to give occaſion of deformity, lameneſſe, loſſe of limbs, fiſtulaes or the like, which very many in the height of their great conceited skill procure; which were it but onely the guilt of conſcience, if they feared God, they ſhould not dare to do. Theſe and the like groſſe errours, unexcuſable before God and man, have brought to the Art a ſcandal, and a ſenſible feeling of want upon many vertuous Profeſſours hereof, ſo that the guilty and unguilty are cenſured both alike by the common ſort, and the one ſmarteth for the others fault. But thoſe which for gain or otherwiſe will prolong the health of thoſe that commit their lives, or limbs to their mercy, or approve of it, the Lord pay them ten fold as much to their ſhame: and ſo for this time I conclude concerning Apoſtumes, onely let me give thee this caveat concerning Precipitate Mercury, or of any kind of Turbith mineral, uſe them not much near any bare bones without very great judgment, for they will black the bones, neither uſe any of them in any new wounds, as is ſaid, for if you do, they are very apt to procure lameneſſe, or ſhrinking of the finewes. All ſwift healing in new wounds I eſteem beſt, yea without any cauſtick medicines at all if it may be, which the Artiſt need not doubt of where neither bones broken, nor other juſt thing of like kind hindreth the work. Thus much concerning the general curing of tumours, to the praiſe of God.
               
               
                  
                  Of the Cure of 
                        Ʋlcers, and Fiſtulaes.
                  
                  
                     FOr, haſte I have mixed Ulcers and Fiſtulaes together, for that they are of affinity in ſhew and cure: whoſe ſeveral definitions I alſo forbear for want of time, and enter into the Cure at the firſt. Wherefore note as followeth. If you chance to have in Cure an Apoſtume, that by the malignity of the humours, or other evil diſpoſition of the body changeth it ſelf into a rebellious Ulcer, concavous, fiſtulaes, or into any the like height of malignity; or that ſuch an Vlcer come to thy hand

                  Firſt, therefore entring into due conſideration of the age and ſtrength of the Patient, with other reaſonable reſpects had, give him a doſe of ℈ ij. or ʒ j. of pulvis Arthreticus, and 3 daies after of Aurum vitae a doſe, viz. grains 8. which he ſhall take whileſt he is yet in bed, and cover him warm, and yet but ordinarily, and it will cauſe him gently to ſweat ſome 2 or 3 houres: then let him wipe himſelf and riſe, and after noon he will feel himſelf very much refreſhed. Then the next day, or two daies after, apply to the Ulcer a little Aqua benedicta, that it may come to the bottom, and into each part of the Ulcer, namely with a little lint on the end of a Probe wet only therein, and ſo leave the linte ſticking in the mouth of the orifice for two daies, dreſſing it only with oyl of Roſes till the Esker remove, with alſo a Minium plaiſter over it, this will cauſe ſome pain, and produce a ſtrong Esker, which being fallen, fill the orifice full with dry lint, for the firſt and ſecond dreſſing, putting the ſame very gently in; for it will beSecond dreſſing. exceeding tender. I am of opinion that it is mere idleneſſe to apply any medicine ſuddenly to provoke the fall of an Esker, as I have mentioned elſewhere. For I dare affirm it furthereth nothing good healing: for when the time of nature is come, it will fall without thy help, thou canſt not keep it on. And I hold it as a hopeful ſign of good healing, when the Esker is ſlow in removing. Wherefore the thirdThird dreſſing. dreſſing after the natural fall of the Esker, having for two dreſſings, as is ſaid, uſed only dry lint, take of the white Aquilla laxativa a little, I mean 3 or 4 grains, and mix with it Plantain or fair water, or an ordinary Lotion, onely that it be as a very thin Unguent, and wet well the wound therewith warmed, and fill it with dry lint, and give the party

in to drink of Aquilla vitae 4 grains upon the point of a knife. This will cauſe him to vomit, and make a ſtrong diverſion of the humours, and then proceed in the cure with drying ordinary medicines, namely dry lint onely ſome 4 dreſſings, and ſome one dreſſing now and then, withFourth dreſſing. a little Aquilla Laxativa upon any lint, onely to touch the Ulcer within: this cauſeth no pain at all, or little ſome dreſſings. Alſo I apply Baſilicon, either alone warm, or ſometimes mixed with a little of the powder of Aquilla Laxativa ſtrewed thereon. And when I uſe this dreſſing, I let the dreſſing remain for 24 houres at the leaſt, and then to my dry lint again: and perhaps if I perceive the Ulcer or Fiſtula to have any other ſecret cavities, and ſee that it be not fully touched in the bottom, I uſe once more my Aqua benedicta, and give a ſecond vomit of Aquilla vita.
                  
                  
                     Other Rules for the finiſhing of the Cure. Alſo I obſerve it for good in the concluſion of each ſure cure, to give ſuch a vomit, where the ſtrength of the Patient will bear it. Furthermore I preſcribe the Patient a ſtrict drying dyet, where I ſee good cauſe, not otherwiſe. But remember this principal rule, that what day he either taketh vomiting, purging, or ſweating medicine, that the ſame day he forbear his dyet drink. Further beware that you preſcribe not over ſlender diet to him which is already pinched with weak diet, either at Sea or Land: or whoſe diet is of bad nourſhment, as too oftentimes it happeneth amongſt poor Seafaring men in long Voyages. Thus uſing this afore preſcribed medicine judiciouſly, you may cure any pockie Fistula, or inveterated Ulcer whatſoever, if they by Art are curable. And for any pockie Ulcer on the virga, I mean either upon glans, or praputium, or 'twixt both, only touch it but once with the aforeſaid Aqus benedicta, and give the party one doſe of the Aquilla vitae, and without queſtion you ſhall cure it afterwards as if it were a green wound, but remember it will cauſe Virga to tumifie ſometimes much, but be not afraid, for by the uſe of Lotions mixed with Plantane or fair water daily warm, and caſt it in twixt Glans and Praeputium, it will ſoon amend. It cureth alſo any warts of the virga by onely touching them, and that if they be touched but very gently: for it is a ſtrong medicine, and procureth ſome pain, but not in warts, yet honeſt it is and ſure, for it will not fail: and if once you acquaint your ſelves with the parts thereof, you will never afterward uſe Troſſes of minium nor Mercury ſublimate again; and yet let me ſpeak my Conſcience, both Troſſes of minium and Mercury ſublimate are worthy Medicines, their whole force and healing vertue being indeed onely the quick-ſilver and ſpirits of ſalt, and no other thing, whoſe companion was never found out for healing and killing. I have often cured deſperate Ulcers, yea and Fiſtulaes with Troſſes of Minium, as alſo ſometimes with onely a Tent made of Mercury ſublimated, and put into the orifice. And how excellent it is inwardly given being truly prepared, I will for this time forbear to ſpeak, till I write of the preparation of ſuch medicines, as I have here divulged under ſtrange names. Thus much of Ulcers and Fiſtulaes to God his glory, and the help of the weaker ſort of young Practitioners.
                  
               
               
                  
                  The Cure of Fractures.
                  
                     THE firſt Intention in the Cure of Fractures is performed by reſtoring the bones disjoyned, and taking away any looſe pieces or fragments of bones if any be.
                  The ſecond Intention is performed by keeping the parts together, namely, the ends of the bones formerly diſplaced and fractured by violence.
                  The third Intention to be done, is the curing of the wounds or contuſions incident to fractured bones.
                  The fourth, to prevent or remove the accidents.
                  The firſt part of this work, namely, the reſtoring, or rather bringing to their places, the fractured ends of the bones, is performed by extention, and a skilfull and ready hand touching the extention: let it be done paulatim, by little and little, as the tearm is, with even hands,The firſt work. not by jumps or on the ſudden, and yet with as much force as is requiſite, namely, till the Artiſt ſtanding by with his hands upon the grief, perceive he is able to ſet the ends of the bones into their place; which done, it is then required that they be kept ſo.
                  The ſecond curative intention of Fractures, is performed by keeping the ends of their bones placed in their right forme and place.
                  This part is chiefly done by good Ligature, wherein I am willing to impart to young Artiſts my practiſe in curing Fractures in the thighes and legges, and underſtand I uſe no rowlers at all, but clowts, ſplints armed and tape, my reaſon is, it is a great diſeaſe and diſquiet to my Patient, yea though I have two aſſiſtants to hold the member to come ſo oft about the member as to rowle it, and endangereth much the disjoynting of the bones again, and cauſeth pain.
                  And it is manifeſt that in ſimple Fractures, the placing of the bones and keeping them ſo, is the moſt work of the Cure, and nothing cureth a fractured bone ſo much as reſt: wherefore when a bone is newly placed, and ſhall be troubled much with lifting and rowling, it cannot but hinder unition, and procure ſome accidents offenſive, my form of Ligatures in Fractures is to have next the member one fourdouble clowt in length, I mean above and below the Fracture, ſo long that the ends of the ſplints I intend to uſe, may have a reſting place on the clowt. And if I intend to cure the Patient by a Lixivium, I apply it on this ſaid clowt, appointing the medicine ever to be next to the grief, then I have another like great cloth to come over that again under the ſplints, which being cloſe and ſmooth

brought about the member, I then put under the firſt ſplint of a good bredth and length well armed with tow, and under that I lay foure or five ſtrong tapes, then I tie one of the ſaid tapes gently, and thurſt all the reſt of the ſplints under the ſame tape, namely ſo many as may compaſſe the fractured member, lying cloſe, but with ſome ſmall diſtance, that they touch not one another, then I tie the reſt of the tapes, drawing them cloſe, till the partie fenſibly ſeel them to bear in all places, the ſplints I appoint commonly ſo long as the member can bear without galling or troubling the next joynt: theſe things ſo done, if either the legge or thigh be fractured, I appoint him juncks, as ſome terme them, namely bents rowled up in canvaſſe to come above his knee, and down to the foot, yea, though onely the legge be fractured, it is fit theſe bundles of junckes be as thick, and thicker then the member fractured, for that they may defend it in bed from wrong, and they are gently to be bound to the member, that they may turn with it if occaſion be; to theſe junckes alſo a cloth may be faſtned, which may be brought under the foot to ſtay the ſame up, to his due poſition, which is a great eaſe to the patient, and beleeve me, if once you be but perfect in this form of Ligature, you will never deſire a rowler in the Cure of fracture: I uſed rowlers till I ſaw the fufficiency of this form of binding, which now I deſire not to change.
                  
                     The Cure. The third intention is the Cure, wherein the inward and outward courſe of the Cure is to be conſidered of. Touching the regiment of the body: concerning ſuſtenance at Sea, the Patient need to have it no thinner then the Saylers ordinary, and touching medicine let him have the benefit of Nature, that is onely every day, or the ſecond day, a naturall ſtool or an artificial help by ſuppoſitories or glyſters, if there be great neceſſitie not otherwiſe; and if a Fever happen, give him a barley water, with a little oyle of Vitrioll therein, and if that help uot, open a vein on the contrarie ſide, and if you fear putrifaction of humours, give him a little Diateſſeron, Triacle or Mithridate, or the like, if he complain much of the pain, ſearch the cauſe, namely, ſee that the ends of the bones lie right, and that the ſplints gall him not, alſo that there be no wrinckles in the clouts applied,The ingredients of a reſtrictive, the manner of compoſing it. and that it be not too hard or too ſoft bound, all theſe things duely conſidered. The Medicines I uſe are as followeth, either I uſe a reſtrictive ſtuffe, which is as followeth.

                  Theſe all made into fine powder, and mixed with the yolkes and whites of two egges together, if they may be had, adding wine vineger, and mixed as much as will ſerve to make this medicine into the form of a Cataplaſme, and in want of egges uſe water and vineger onely ſo much as is needfull, alſo if Comfry roots be not to be had or Thus; they may be forborne, you may in their places for need,

though not ſo very well uſe Bean-meal, I have done very well many times, onely with Allum, Bole, Egs, water and vineger, though Bean flower is alſo very good or Wheat flower, and as for the medicine called Lapis Zabuloſus here recited, it is a medicine found out in the Arch-Duke of Brandenburg his Countrey, named in the Germane Tongue, Bc in broucke, which in our language is a broken bone, being in ſubſtance like chalk and in form like a bone, ſome pieces like ribs, other like fingers, others like legs or armes, bones of nature ſo growing. This medicine I know to excell many other in healing Fractures both outwardly applied in Cataplaſmes, and inwardly taken daily the quantitie of ʒj in fine powder in wine, beere, or water, the patient faſting for two houres after the taking thereof. In great Fractures the Germane Chirurgions, preſcribe this aforeſaid medicine dayly to be taken for twentie foure dayes, if they ſee cauſe ſo long to uſe it: The other form of application to Fractures uſed and commendable, as I have ſaid, and from which I am digreſſed is a good ſtrong Lixivium made with freſh water and aſhes till it be ſlipperie, namely, let the water be made ſeething hot ere the aſhes be put in, adding if th ey be ready, or may be had in the Ship theſe hearbs following: St. Johns wort, Wormwood, Centaury, Roſemary, Sage, Camomile and Mellilote flowers, or at the leaſt ſome of them, alſo you may adde Lupines thereto: but howſoever though there be no herbs, adde ſalt good ſtore when it is cleared, but not before; and then though you have neither hearbs nor lupines, it will be of good force, for it is the vegetable ſalt in the aſhes, which is the beſt healer, the next beſt is the minerall or Sea-ſalt, wet the clowts rehearſed therein, and wring them out hard, and apply them ſmooth, cloſe and hot about the member binding it ſo up: this ſecond form is eſteemed of moſt Artiſts the ſafer, for avoyding Gangrenes, which fractures are much incident unto by reaſon of great ſtore of contuſed bloud gathered, that can hardly be diſcuſſed on the inſtant, which thereby cauſeth obſtructions, whereupon followeth inflammation and pain, and conſequently a Gangrene, and ſurely the firſt is not inferiour to this: for by the means of the Allum and the Vineger it ſwageth pain, tempereth well the parts, and yet repelleth and diſcuſſeth the bloud gathered, and being once baked to, it fortifieth mightily the member, by ſticking cloſe and hard to it, I have uſed it long without repcntance, and the other ſometime: but for that it helpeth of it ſelf to keep the member to his ſtraightneſſe, I the rather uſe it.

                  Theſe things ready, I mean the one or the other form, ſuppoſe then the greater foſſill or bone of the leg were fractured, make true extention (as is ſaid) that both ends of the bones meet together, namely, let one ſtrong man take the one end of the fractured limbe, and another the other end, thy ſelf ſtanding free, and let them draw out the member, directly when thou art ready, and not before, neither by jumps, but leiſurely and together: likewiſe if they bear their hands too high or too low in drawing, they cauſe great pain to the Patient,How to know when the

the member is returned to his former beautie again: but alſo by it much of the pain is eaſed, for it is a ſure rule, if the pain abate not, all is not well: The bone, I ſay, firſt well reduced, bring your ſtuffe formerly rehearſed and put it under the leg, the parties that extended, not forſaking their hold, and lap it about ſmooth and cloſe as you can, without wrinckles, lumps or ſeams, and that the ends may alſo fold ſmooth one over the other, wrapping it double and ſmooth over the ſhin bone▪ the cauſe why I uſe to fold it double on the ſhin bone, leaving it there to be opened, is that if it chance there be a wound it may be dreſſed the better without undoing all: but if no wound be, yet it fortifieth the bone the better, by the doubleneſſe thereof being ſmooth, then lay your next cloth broader and longer then the firſt, over the firſt, being wet in water and vineger if there be cauſe, and wrung out. Let the ſecond cloth, I fay, as alſo the firſt, be longer then the ſplints, that the ends of the ſplints may reſt thereon, and not on the bare leg, placing the ſplints in their order about the leg, till you have compaſſed the leg, laying them (as is ſaid) not too cloſe together, that they ride not one over another, neither touch each other, nor come upon the ioynts, remembring to put all your tapes under together, in number it were fit to have five or ſixe, namely, two on each end, and two for the midſt: Alſo if there be a wound, you muſt ſo order the matter, that you may daily apply to the wound neceſſary medicines, whereas otherwiſe if there be no great cauſe, namely, through much pain or the like, you may well forbear ſix daies, or ten daies, provided that you ſee the leg be ſtraight and well laid in an even poſition or form; and that it may lye the ſafer, it were good to be provided with the afor eſaid bundles of reeds or bents, as thick as the leg or thicker, to come from the foot, and one hand breadth over the knee, which ſhould be wound and wrapped in canvaſſe, and bound to each ſide of the leg artificially with four long tapes, and at Sea you may take for a ſhift two billets bumbaſted with a little Ocum wrapt in an old piece of a ſail. Further in Fractures with a wound, if you uſe unctions and liquid things, as oyles; you hazard putrifaction of the bone and apoſtumation: herein alſo great care muſt be had, that the legge muſt be kept ſteddy, for diſquiet therein will bring apoſtumation, and mortification, and death alſo: beware likewiſe of over hard binding, for it bringeth aſtoniſhment and hazard of a ſudden Gangrene and death, it is a generall fault of divers young Chirurgions, for many think they have never bound hard enough, and yet too looſe is a fault, but eaſily may be amended, and I adviſe thee to look to thy Patient often, that his ſplints gale him not, for that bringeth▪ want of reſt, and divers evill accidents depending thereupon, I ſpeak this of my own experience, not to my praiſe: let him have no wine except he be weak, let him once in two daies by Nature and Art have a ſtoole, holding theſe rules with little trouble it is hard for him that will be careful to cure any Fracture: for indeed as is mentioned, the bone reſtored, reſt is the chiefeſt medicine to cure a Fracture, yea, it will effect it almoſt without medicine, the member being onely artificially bound, and ſplinted orderly;

the inward medicines for Fractures I ſay need not to be many, onely give him in beere dayly, in wine or water, as thy diſcretion ſhall move thee, the mentioned Lapis Zabuloſus

                  Concerning the Cure of Diſlocations.
                  
                  
                     ALthough I have ſeen divers skilfull men perform good works in Diſlocations, and reade ſomewhat, and for many yeares practiſed my ſelf, yet know I not in this part of Chirurgerie by words to deſcribe ought to the purpoſe, which might ſerve at all aſſayes, or upon all occaſions for the help of young men, for as much as ſo many unexpected obſervations and ſtrange occurrents happen in and by Diſlocations, as would aske much time to explaine or but to touch all, yet in a word or two, I hold it not unfit to adviſe them ſomewhat

concerning Luxations or Diſlocations. Firſt, therefore it is a generall rule that you muſt uſe extention almoſt to every Diſlocation, eſpecially in the ſhoulder, in the huckle bone, in the knee, and in the ankle, for I may boldly ſay, where the Artiſt findeth a member longer then his due form, he ſhall hardly do good on it, namely if it proceed by evill diſpoſition of nature, or that by the abundance of vicious or viſcous humors it have extended it ſelf, or that it have been over much extended and thereby is longer. Extention is therefore to be carefully made, Imean as I have ſaid in the Cure of Fractures, not on the ſuddain, nor too forcible, but yet with ſtrong and ſteddy hands, for in the extention is exceeding great reſpect to be taken, and it is the principall work, yea, and much Charitie is to be uſed therein, for too farre extending weakneth much, if not overthroweth the true uſe of the member, even ſo too little extended, produceth not the effect intended, I mean it ſerveth not to reſtore the bone Diſlocated; even ſo the extenders raiſing their hands too high, or putting them down too low, hinder the comming of the bone into his due place, and cauſe greater pain to the partie: furthermore, itCertain Rules for the cure of Diſlocations. were good when the Artiſt taketh view of a member Diſlocated, that the other ſide were alſo uncovered, that thereby the true forme and ſituation of the diſeaſed limme, being well regarded, and compared together with the whole joynt, the better judgement, and truer indication might be taken: I mean if one ſhoulder or elbow be out of joynt, let the Artiſt make bare the other ſide alſo, for that there is often great difference in the naturall proportion or ſituation of mens joynts: having therefore firſt viewed, and then alſo ſufficiently extended, and the form of the other ſide alſo, as is ſaid, ſeen and kept in remembrance t then ſeek to reduce or place the bone by thoſe means, which in thy own reaſon ſeem fitteſt conſidering and well weighing the natural form, and true ſituation of the Diſlocated bone, as is ſaid, which in truth is unpoſſible in my opinion by letters to explain: this done, for the moſt part, yea, and in very great Diſlocations, the work thou maiſt account is done, and the fear at an end.
                  My ſelf have ſet divers ſtrong mens bones, I mean the ſhoulder bones chiefly, which have done labour the ſame day, nevertheleſſe I denie not but it is good and very neceſſarie to apply to the place things diſcuſſing, anodine, and mollificative as reaſon ſhall induce the Artiſt unto: you may therefore anoint the place with oyle of Roſes, Camomill, Dill, or Earth-worms as you ſhall ſee fitteſt, and apply thereon a Plaſter of diacolon diccalſiteos, Paracelſus plaſter or the like and ſo rowle and bind up the member artificially as ſhall be moſt fit, and let it have reſt: if thou fear furrher accidents, thou maiſt alſo give the partie ſome laxative. The bone I have ſaid is never truely reſtored, if the pain continue. Again, if there be a great tumour in the place diſlocated, ſo that thou canſt not therefore well reduce the bone, then maiſt thou lay the partie to reſt, and the member alſo to as good reſt as thou canſt, and by things mollifying, and diſcuſſing ſeek to aſſwage the tumour, in which caſe a good Lixivium deſcribed in

the Cure of Fractures were good to foment it withall, or a good Cataplaſme made of Oat-meal and Linſeeds boyled in beere or water, with a little oyle of Elders would doe very well, but take this for a rule that if thou be called to any diſlocation where a tumour is, if it be but a tumour of one, or two, or three dayes gathering, attempt thy beſt to reduce the bone notwithſtanding the tumour: for if by extention and pains taking thou canſt get the bone into his place, thou needeſt not to fear the tumour, for it will quickly be gone: whereas on the other ſide if by thy other applications thou canſt not in reaſonable time diſſolve the tumour, a callow or ſtrange ſubſtance may be fixed in the place that thou ſhalt never be able to diſſolve, alſo the Ligaments and heads of the Muſcles will be grown hard and ſhrunk, and thou maieſt fear a lameneſſe and withering willThe ſooner extention is wrought the better. follow to that member: wherefore with a carefull conſideration ſeek to reduce any bone, the ſooner the better.
                  I uſe an inſtrument in diſlocations which I learned the practiſe of in Polonia whileſt I lived there, which I call by the name of a Commander, for that rightly placed and uſed it will ſurely command; and I have uſed that one ſelf ſame inſtrument to the ſhoulder, wriſt, Huckles bone knee, and ankle with good ſucceſſe. I may truly ſay I have ſet with it above 500. joynts at times, and never once repented me of the uſe therefore: and to ſhew thee how I uſe it mark a little my words, for I muſt be brief: If I ſee juſt cauſe of the uſe thereof and with my own hands and ſome others to help me I cannot without much pain to my patient bring the diſlocated bone to his ſeat, if this diſlocation, I ſay, be in his ſhoulder, I place the button of the inſtrument being ſomewhat flat on both ſides, not round, juſt into the armpit, or hollow place, I mean under the upper round end of the adjutory bone, or betwixt the ſaid bone and the body, and directly under the Os humeralis, or O

It were alſo good that the Inſtrument, I mean the wooden Commander, were juſt of height with the partie, I mean from the place where it is to be placed to the ground, but becauſe that cannot alwayes be expected, let the partie diſeaſed ſtand in that order, or ſo under ſet the inſtrument that it may fall out ſo: and underſtand further, that the partie forany bone of the arm diſlocated muſt be ſtanding whileſt it is placing. And for the thigh, knee, or ankle lying. Having placed, tied, and faſtned the parts together, as is ſaid, let one

                  And when thou wilt uſe it to the huckle bone, note the button on the top muſt be taken off, and a cuſhion bound on the place thereof; the party muſt alſo be ſo placed lying, that his huckle bone, thigh and leg muſt hang over the beds feet free from the bed, or ſo laid on a table, that all thoſe parts may be free, and his leg below the knee muſt be gently bound to the Commander, as is ſaid of the arm: In all this work neat ligature, true extention and a carefull induſtrious hand muſt perform the buſineſſe, and practice muſt be the mean; for my ſelf I have no time to amplifie further: this which is ſaid is practiſe, for the which if thou find profit by it, give God the praiſe.

Note alſo it is convenient if the occaſion of diſmembring grow by reaſon of a Gangrene the body of the party and ſpirits not waſted before with long ſickneſſe, to let go ſome reaſonable quantity of blood in diſmembring, becauſe it is ſuppoſed to be venomous, but

in a ſpent weak body, who hath had a long pining diſeaſe, preſerve his blood and ſpirits as careful as if they were thine own, and yet remembring this one rule, which all the London Hoſpital Chirurgions hold, there is more hope in a weak ſpent body, then in a full body: note further, that if the legg be taken off above the knee, there is the more danger, alſo there is great care to be had to the great vein and artery, namely, that thou take them up, and pierce them thorow, and make ſtrong ligature about them, which muſt be ſpeedily done, if thou canſt do it: but at firſt I fear thou wilt miſs, yet be not diſcouraged, nor ſtand too long to ſeek them, but go on with like hope: Alſo if the occaſion of diſmembring proceed of a Gangrene, by reaſon of an inward cauſe, it were requiſite to take the member off four fingers above the Gangrene at the Leaſt, if the member will bear it, and let the Patient have ſome cordial potion: furthermore in diſmembring, where there be two bones, as namely in the leg, it is not amiſs to ſet the Saw firſt on the outward part of the leg, that both the bones might be cut at once, for the leſſe thou ſhalt ſhake the member, the better and the more eaſe to the Patient: moreover concerning the ſecondThe compoſition of M.

                        THis lamentable diſeaſe, which hath ſo long and ſo fiercely aſſailed Saylers and Sea-men of all ſorts more then Landmen; It is ſtrange in ſo many ages past, that no one Chirurgeon of our countrey men, hath out of his experience taken in hand ſincerely to ſet down to poſterities, the true cauſes, ſignes and cure thereof, neither left any inſtructions, caveats or experiences for the prevention or cure of the ſame, yet it may be ſome may ſay the cure thereof is common, and we have in our own countrey here many excellent remedies generally known, as namely, Scurvy-graſſe, Horſe-Reddiſh roots, Naſturtia Aquatica, Worm-wood, Sorrel, and many other good means: the truth is we have ſo, but mark how far they extend onely to the Cure of thoſe which live at home, or elſe it may be ſaid, they alſo help ſome Sea-men returned from far, who by the natural diſpoſition of the freſh air and amendment of diet, nature her ſelf in effect doth the Cure without other helps, as daily it is ſeen.
                     This thing therefore being ſo, what ſhould I ſpend my time in teaching that Method, or thoſe medicines to the Chirurgions Mate, which will not be had at Sea, neither if they could be had, will ſuffice for the Cure thereof, where the diſeaſe raingneth fiercely?
                     
                        This Treatiſe moſt concerneth Sea-men. Having therefore very ſmall time, I muſt conſtrain my ſelf to go briefely to the buſineſſe in hand, namely, to enform the Chirurgions Mate how he ſhould demean himſelf to comfort his Patients at Sea in that moſt dangerous diſeaſe, neither will I here ſtrive to give the curious Reader other content then this, that if he like it not, let him amend it himſelf, which I ſhould heartily rejoyce to ſee any good man do, knowing mine own weakneſs. A learned Treatiſe befits not my Pen, and to declare thoſe good medicines, which cannot be had at Sea, is but time lost.
                  
                  
                     
                     What the Diſeaſe called the Scurvy is.
                     
                        Definition of the Scurvy, and the nature thereof. 
                        THE Scurvy is a diſeaſe of the ſpleen, whereby it is ſometimes wholly ſtopped, ſometimes onely diſtempered, ſometimes alſo appearing with hard Scyrros, ſwellings, beginning and ſhewing themſelves in divers parts of the body, but more particularly on the thighes and leggs, cauſing them to ſeem of a Leady colour, the ſharpneſſe of which infectious humor oft offendeth the mouth and gummes of the diſeaſed, and cauſeth the fleſh thereof to rot and ſtink.
                  
                  
                     The names of the Diſeaſe.
                     
                        The divers appellations thereof. THe Scurvy is called of ſome Cathexia univerſalis, of other Sceletyrbe, and of ſome Stomacacen, it is a Chronical diſeaſe, not ſimple but compound of many other diſeaſes.
                  
                  
                     The cauſes of the Diſeaſe.
                     FIrſt the Diſeaſe comes, as is ſaid, by obſtructions of the ſpleen, and by the thickneſſe of the humour, not the multitude.
                     Some judicious Writers do affirm this ſickneſſe to come by the multitude of Melancholike humors gathered in Vena Porta, by which it is ſaid the Milt doth draw unto it Melancholly humors, and ſo tranſporteth it from the Milt into the Ventricle.
                     But truly the cauſes of this diſeaſe are ſo infinite and unſearchable, as they far paſs my capacity to ſearch them all out; ſome men conceive this diſeaſe happeneth to Sea-men onely, through long being at Sea without touch at land, as it is ſeen in Eaſt India voyages; our men have it betwixt England, and the Cape de bon ſpera
                              •

The chief cauſe whereof is the continuance of ſalt diet, either fiſh or fleſh, as pork and the like, which is not to be avoided at ſea, as I ſuppoſe by the wit of man; another cauſe is want of ſufficient nouriſhing food, and of ſweet water, and alſo for want of Aqua vita, wine, beer, or other good water to comfort and warm their ſtomackes, which by contrary winds men are two much incident unto in long voiages, howſoever the Marchants are careful, provident, and bountiful in that point.
                     
                        
An other cauſe of this diſeaſe to the ordinary ſort of poor men, is want of freſh apparel to ſhift them with, which indeed amongſt poor Sailers, eſpecially a ſort of them that are careleſſe and lazy of diſpoſition is too frequent, partly alſo by the not keeping their apparel ſweet and dry, and the not cleanſing and keeping their Cabins ſweet, this alſo ingendreth and increaſeth the infection. Some charge Bisket as a cauſe of the Scurvy, but I am not of their opinion: Some ſay inordinate watchings are cauſe therſeof: Some ſay extream labour wanting due nouriſhment: Some alſo affirm cares and grief to be ſome cauſe thereof, others affirm the very heat of the

                         true that they which have all the helps which can be had for mony, and take as much care as men can deviſe are even by the evil diſpoſition of the aire, and the courſe of nature, ſtrook with a Scurvy, yea and die thereof at ſea and land both: yet this giveth no warrant to the Surgeon, or his Mate to leave their duties unperformed, for the bloods of thoſe men which either by their wilfulneſſe or ſlothfulneſſe periſh under their charge will ſurely be required at their hands.
                     But it is plain that this grief is a lazie foul diſeaſe with obſtructions of the liver, or ſpleen, or of both; as alſo it appeareth that the head is much diſeaſed, and that there is great obſtructions in the brain, for that the eyes not onely look evil coloured, but alſo the gummes putrifie, and the teeth grow looſe, and all the ſinewy parts of the body bear their part in the diſeaſe, for the ſhrinking and withering of the ſinews with the great pains the party hath, declareth no leſſe.
                  
                  
                     Of the Scurvy or Scorbutum the ſignes.
                     
                        THe ſignes of the Scurvy are many, as namely, a general lazineſs and evil diſpoſition of all the faculties and parts of the body, ſaving the ſtomack and the appetite, which oftentimes is greater then ordinary with them a long time.
                     A diſcolouring of the skin as if it were fouler then ordinary, with ſpots darker coloured then the reſt, and ſometimes alſo darkiſh blew ſpots.
                     A fever at ſea commonly ends in the Scurvy, wherefore by the way beware of too large purging▪ or phlebotomy, which increaſe oft the grief, and make it incurable: I ſpeak this becauſe I have noted there is a fault in young Surgeons of forwardneſſe in taking too much blood at Sea.
                     Alſo itching or aking of the limbs are ſignes of the grief.
                     Sometimes the legs falling away, and drying the calves of the legs growing hard and dry, as alſo immoderate ſwellings of the

legs: alſo the legs and thlghes diſcoloured into frekels, or ſpots of a durty brown ſad colour much like the colour of a gangrenated or mortified member.
                     Stinking of the breath.
                     Great obſtructions of the liver, or ſpleen, or both, and in the exerciſing of the bodyes, their limbs and their ſpirit failing them.
                     Shortneſſe and difficulty of breathing, eſpecially when they move themſelves, but lying ſtill finde little grief or pain.
                     Their eyes of a leady colour, or like dark violets.
                     Great ſwellings in the face, legs, and over all the body; paleneſs, or a foul pale colour in the face. Swellings of the gums, rottenneſs of the ſame, with the iſſuing of much filthy blood and other ſtinking corruption thence, looſeneſs of the teeth: Alſo ſome are troubled with an extream coſtiveneſſe, that for 14. dayes together they go not to ſtool once, wherefore the Chirurgion is conſtrained with an Inſtrument to take out the excrements to avoid death, after which extreme coſtiveneſſe often followeth a great flux of blood, and a painful: alſo many have ſtoppings of the urine, or at leaſt making leſſe water in two dayes then the party drinketh in one day.
                     A coldneſſe and ſtiffeneſſe of the ſinewy parts, chiefly of the legs.
                     Some alſo have their Muſcles, yea and ſinews of their thighes, arms, and legs, ſo waſted away, that there ſeemeth to be left only theCertain ſignes of the Scurvy by the dead opened, diſcovered. skin covering the bones.
                     Alſo it is manifeſt that divers of thoſe which have been opened after death, have had their Livers utterly rotted.
                     Others have had their Livers ſwoln to an exceeding greatneſſe, ſome the Spleen extreamly ſwoln, others have been full of water, others their Lungs putrified and ſtunk whilſt they have lived, theſe and divers other ſigns, too many for to be mentioned here, do afflict poor Sea-men, which often are paſt mans help, in ſuch place and time as they happen, the Cure whereof reſteth only in the hands of the Almighty. And yet to any man of judgement it may ſeem a wonder how a poor miſerable man, coming on Land from a long Voyage even at the point of death, namely, ſwoln ſometimes to an unreaſonable greatneſſe not able to lift a leg over a ſtraw, nor ſcarce to breath by reaſon of ſtrong obſtruction, yet in a few daies ſhall receive the fulneſſe of former health, yea with little or no medicine at all.
                     The Cure of this diſeaſe, as a famous Writer named Johannes Echthius in a Treatiſe De Scorbuto affirmeth, conſiſteth chiefly in four things, namely, in opening obſtructions, evacuating the offending humors, in altering the property of them, and in comforting and corroborating the parts late diſeaſed.
                     
                        Remedies touching the Scurvy. 
                        Johannes Vierius another famous writer aſcribeth the whole cure of the Scurvy to the herb Spoon-wort. One Olivar as a Sweden writer, in his fifteenth book, and fifty one Chapter, intreating of this grief attributeth the whole cure thereof to be in Abſinthi

And whereas the firſt part of this Cure is in the opening of obſtructions, it is therefore fit in the beginning of the grief to give a lenitive glyſter, then the next day if the party be ſtrong open a vein, but beware, as is ſaid, of taking too much blood away at once, eſpecially where the Liver is weak or ſtopped, and where men want good nutriment, for many evils enſue thereby. The next day following his bleeding if he can bear it, and if that his diſeaſe be with a ſwelling or fulneſſe, give him a doſs of the pills of Euphorbium or otherwiſe of pibula ruffi, or of Cambogia, and make him ſome comfortable ſpoon meat, ſuch as you can make at ſea; namely, an Oatmeal caudle would not be amiſs of a little beer or wine, with the yolk of an egge, and a little Sugar made warm and given him to drink, or any comfortable broth made with Currants and other fruit, or Spices moderately taken▪ or with Sugar, or as the Ship can afford, a Barley water for his ordinary drink were not amiſs, with ſome few drops of Cinnamon water therein, and alſo ſome juice or Syrupe of Lemons therein, or a few drops of oyl of Vitriol, and ſome Sugar, and give him in his drink by way of infuſion, dryed Wormwood good ſtore, for it is very wholeſome.
                     Further the Chirurgion or his Mate muſt not fail to perſwade the Governor or Purſer in all places where they touch in the Indies and may have it, to provide themſelves of juice of Oranges, limes, or lemons, and at Banthame of Tamarinds: Alſo ſometime though a man be well, a comfortable caudle made with ſome Wine, Spices, Sugar, and the yolk of an egge were very good; for theſe are helps in that caſe as well to prevent the diſeaſe, as alſo to help it when it comes.

The uſe of the juice of Lemmons is a precious medicine and well tried, being ſound and good, let it have the chief place, for it will deſerve it, the uſe whereof is: It is to be taken each morning, two or three ſpoonfuls, and faſt after it two hours, and if you add one ſpoonfull of Aqua vitae thereto to a cold ſtomack, it is the better. Alſo if you take a little thereof at night it is good to mixe therewith ſome ſugar, or to take of the ſyrup thereof is not amiſſe. Further note it is good to be put into each purge you give in that diſeaſe. Some Chirurgeons alſo give of this juice daily to the men in health as a preſervative,The iuice of Lemmons a good preſervative. which courſe is good if they have ſtore, or otherwiſe it were beſt to keep it for need. I dare not write how good a ſauce it is at meat, leſt the chief in the ſhips waſte it in their great Cabins to ſave vineger. In want whereof uſe of the juice of Limes, Oranges, or Citrons, or the pulp of Tamarinds: and in want of all theſe uſe oyl of Vitriol as many drops as may make a cup of beere, water, or rather wine if it may be had, only a very little as it were ſower, to which you may alſo adde ſugar if you pleaſe, or ſome ſyrups, according to your ſtore and the neceſſitie of that diſeaſe, for of my experience I can affirm that good oyl of Vitriol is an eſpecial good medicine in the cure of the Scurvie, as alſo in many other griefs▪ the which in another place is noted. Further a decoction of Bisket, and therein Almonds ground, adding Cinamon and Roſe-water a little, and ſome ſugar, were very comfortable now and then to be taken to refreſh the ſtomack. And as touching the Tamarinds brought from the Indies they are to be eaten of themſelves as the ſubſtance of them is, namely, to eat them as you would prunes, and being made into conſerves, eat them as other conſerves, on the point of a knife ſucking out the ſubſtance, and putting forth the ſtalkes or ſtones thereof; ſome diſſolve them in wine or water, and work out the ſubſtance of them therein, and caſt away the reſt, taking onely that which is pure: one may uſe this medicine ſo oft as he pleaſe without danger or harm, onely if he fear a flux of the belly, or have a weakneſs in the reines, let him not eat too much of the Tamarinds. Alſo theTamarinds muſt be uſed ſparingly if a flux be feared. Elect. Diatr

Green Ginger is alſo very good to comfort the ſtomack, and ſo are all ſorts of Myrabolans Condite, and alſo all ſorts of ſtrong Cordial waters, but chiefly good Roſaſolis and good Wormwood water, yea, and very good Aqua vitae helpeth well, Currants and Reyſons of the Sun are likewiſe very good.
                     Alſo all kinds of Spices moderately taken are good, and ſo is good wine a very good preſerver of the body from this diſeaſe, with alſo the continuance of freſh diet, which is hard to be gotten at ſea, the exceſſe of which good things is as dangerous.
                     The principall Laxative medicine which I would adviſe in this caſe is pills of Euphorbium wherewith the body being ſwoln and watry, you may at your pleaſure make evacuation thereof: theſe purge alſo by urine very well the doſſe being ʒ
                        ss, or at the moſt ℈ij. Theſe are the fitter for that diſeaſe, becauſe they purge not alone water, but alſo by their great warmth, they comfort and warm the ſtomack and intrals.
                     
                        A caveat for the doſe. Theſe I adviſe the Chirurgions Mate to uſe, as it is ſaid, where the body aboundeth with overmuch cold and crude humiditie, but let your doſſe alwayes reſpect the ſtrength of the patient, for any ſtrong purging is not good in the Scurvy: all ſudden and ſtrong evacuations are to be avoided. Alſo Aquilla Laxative is a very good purge in this caſe, namely eight or ten grains thereof taken in a cup of wine. It cureth alſo all worms of the body, and killeth them whereſoever they be. But if the ſtomack onely be oppreſſed with the grief in this diſeaſe, I firſt give a doſe of pills called Pillule Ruffi, namely ʒj. you ſhall find them to be very good.
                     Note further, that if any doſe or any whole maſſe of pills in the Cheſt, ſuch time as you would adminiſter them be grown too hard, then you may diſſolve them with any ſyrup you have, or with good honey a very little, namely one onely drop will ſerve to diſſolve oneHow to compoſe them in a fit conſiſtence if they be overſoft. doſe at once, if the maſſe prove too liquid, you may roll it in ſome of the Pulvis Arthreticus till it be hard enough.

                     Furthermore, if you ſee cauſe, certain dayes after you have given of any your former Laxatives, you may give a ſweat to the patient in hisTo ſweat is an other ſingular remedie.

Alſo the ſweating in moiſt bathes I confeſſe to be good medicines in this caſe, though not well to be performed at Sea for the ordinary men. And whereas one accident dangerous in this diſeaſe is extreme Coſtiveneſſe as is mentioned, with alſo ſtopping of Vrine: the remedies for the Coſtiveneſſe, is firſt that you attempt to move the belly by a lenitive glyſter as is ſaid, made rather of a ſlimy decoction or medicine which might leave no ſharp Aſtringent or deſiccative qualitie behind it, yea though it purge not much, for the ſharp Purgers after their working cauſe often a more Coſtiveneſſe then was before, or by

Furthermore, it ſometime happeneth, that by the long remaining of the excrements in the Longanum, the gut is either excoriated, or at the leaſt inflamed.

                  Concerning the Fluxes of the Belly.
                  THe principal Fluxes of the belly by a common conſent of divers ancient Writers, are chiefly referred to three kinds, namely:

                     What Leienteria is. 
                     Leientaria is diſtinguiſhed to be that Fluxe which either paſſeth the ſuſtenance taken, wholly digeſted, and that without any blood at all, and without great pain, or as it were half digeſted.

Wherefore young Artiſts that profeſſe to fear the Almightie, ought to be compaſſionate to the meaneſt creature in this diſeaſe, as they would others ſhould do to them in the like caſe, and not even otherwiſe.
                     
                        Petrus Bayerius an ancient learned Writer, alledging Galen in his ſecond book, de locis affectis, defineth this diſeaſe as followeth: It is, ſaith he, tearmed Dyſenterium, whereas varietie of ſubſtances are ſent out with the excrement, producing excoriation with dolour and pain, as if ſomewhat were ſhaven from the ſmall guts, and that ſhaven, ſaithAdmonition to young Artiſts. he, proceedeth from the choler and turneth to ulceration of the guts and is compleat in two weeks, or proceedeth of a glaſſie coloured ſubſtance, and hath its termination in foure weeks: or proceedeth of a Melancholy humour, and is in perfection in forty daies: firſt beginneth the fluxe, then followeth the excoriation, &c. But to trouble the Reader much, or my ſelf with long definitions, either of the cauſes or ſignes of this diſeaſe, my leiſure will not permit me, and the rather will I not inſiſt thereon, for that in reading I find divers learned and reverend Writers that have entred into long diſcourſes of the ſignes and cauſes of this grief, preſcribing divers methodical rules; and yetAmbiguity impertinent. they conclude of the cure of Dyſentery, for the moſt part of them with a kind of Emperical form of curing, namely, ſome reciting one, ſome another medicine for the general cure of this diſeaſe: many of

them ending without any rational, or methodical form at all, which argueth in my opinion that it is impoſſible either to finde out all the cauſes thereof, or to preſcribe any one true form for the general cure of the ſame, but the diſcreet Chirurgion muſt be armed with judgement in theſe following principles; namely, that if he perceive it to proceed by fulneſs of bloud or humours, to ſeek the health of the Patient by ſundry the moſt rational and fitteſt evacuations; as namely,Adviſe to the Art

Further, I adviſe the younger Artiſts not to ſtrive to ſtay a Flux, as is ſaid in a full body, till nature be firſt unburthened, partly by the diſeaſe, and partly by medicines fit.

                     CERTAIN SIGNES, PROGNOſtications, and inſtructions which I hope will not be unprofitable for YOUTH concerning Fluxes
                     
                     
                        The ſigns preceding the flux. 
                        THe Signs of the diſeaſe are alwaies manifeſt of themſelves, the ſigns, afore-running or demonſtrating of the inſtant diſeaſe are theſe following: Pain and torture of the inteſtines, or ventricle. Galen teſtifieth cap. 2. locorum affectorum, in the very beginning of a Flux, ſaith he, ſharp choler is ſent forth, wringings, and as it were off-ſcouring, or off-ſhavings of the inteſtines appear, then after there followeth a little blood, and then beginneth the diſeaſe Dyſentery, and by the relation of the Patient it will often appear if the pain be above or below the Navil. A painful ſlow expulſion of the excrements of the belly with ſmall fragments bloody and fatty do argue the higher inteſtines to be affected, but if the grief be lower, a pain below theThe excrements in fragments and fat therewith. Navil ſhall torment the Patient, then you ſhall ſee much fatneſſe with fragments, and thoſe fragments of the lower inteſtines will be more groſſe and leſſe mingled with the excrements. A Dyſentery ſlaying popularly and killing many, may be adjudged contagious, and is thought to follow a peſtilential conſtitution, and if in the times of a general infection by the diſeaſe Dyſentery, or Lientery, a white Flux called Diarrhaea with Tenaſmus appear in the Patient, that party a little after ſhall be afflicted with the Dyſentery. The Ulcers of of the ſmall inteſtines are more dangerous then the ulcers ofthe greater.
                     Difficulty of the inteſtines, if it proceed from a black choler is held mortal: Aph. 24. Sect. 4.
                     
                        Mortal ſigns in the Dyſentery. Long difficulties of the inteſtines, hunger and wearineſſe are evil ſignes, and it is ſo much the worſe if it be with a fever:

                     Every Flux eſpecially if it be Dyſenterial, happening after a long ſickneſſe is mortal, but chiefly if it be ſudden, becauſe it argueth a ſudden corruption of humours and great debility.
                     A Flux drawing to a languiſhing dropfie is mortal.
                     
                        
If in a Dyſenteria a blew blew ſpot appear behind the ear, the Patient ſhall dye,
                     The Fluxes that are from the beginning wateriſh, and afterwards like an unguent, are evil.
                     In all Fluxes of the belly, and in all other diſeaſes, of weakneſſe of the appetite, inconſtancy of the minde, heavineſſe in ſleep, imbecility of the legs, a hoarſe and barking voice, a weak pulſe, beating often, pains over the whole body, chiefly about the belly, blackneſſe of the face, or of a deadly or leady colour, and coldneſſe in all the extreme parts: theſeafore-ſaid ſigns foretel evil, but the ſigns contrary to theſe aforeſaid are healthful.
                     The Hicket after an immoderate flux of the belly is mortal.
                     
                        A good ſign. Belching following a Flux of the belly is good, becauſe it is a ſign that nature hath received, or again begun concoction.
                     
                        A bad ſign. A flux of the belly which is not appeaſed by fit remedies, is pernitious.
                     A peſtilent flux of the belly beginning with lienteria Dearrheae, or Tenaſmus is worſe in children then in ancient men, as experience teacheth.
                     If that by the difficulty of the Inteſtines, the excrements come forth like peeces of fleſh, it is a deadly ſign, Aph. 26. Sect. 4.
                     
                        Another good ſign. In fluxes of the belly, changes of the excrements is a principal good ſign, unleſſe the change be made worſer, Aph. 14. Sect. 2.
                     In perturbations of the belly and voluntary vomiting, if ſuch things are purged thereby that ought to be purged, it is good: but otherwiſe the contrary, Aph. 25. Sect. Aph. 3, Sect. 4.
                     A Dyſentery which proceeds from yellow choler is not altogether mortal, as Galen affirmeth in his ſecond book of natural faculties thatGeneral rules for the cure of the flux. many are cured of it. Lientery after Dyſentery is mortal: theſe Canons following belong to the particular cure of any flux of the belly.
                     
                         No flux of the belly before the fourth day if the Patient be ſtrong, is to be reſtrained.
                     
                         The ulcers of the higher inteſtines are to be cured with medicines taken at the mouth, but thoſe of the lower with Glyſters chiefly: and if ulcers be in both, then are they to be cured both waies.
                     
                         To ſuch as cure a Dyſentery, let aſtringent things be given before other meats, that they may the better be retained.
                     
                         Hot ſtiptick things are good in fluxes proceeding of a cold cauſe: And on the contrary, if the concocting faculty ſhall be weak, the uſe of hot things is likewiſe good.
                     
                         If there be a cough with flux of the belly, the Patient ſhall abſtain from all ſharp ſtiptick things.
                     
                         Sweating medicines and frications with oyl of Camomil and Dill, by opening the pores, and plucking back the matter to the oppoſite part are good in fluxes.
                     
                         Cupping-glaſſes ſaith Avicene applyed four hours to the belly ſtay the fluxes of the belly.
                     
                        
                         All ſtiptick fruits by the counſel of Avicene are to be avoided in fluxes of the belly, notwithſtanding Cheſtnuts hurt not, as the ſame Author affirmeth.
                     
                         Sleep among other things is good for a flux, and ſo is any quietneſſe and reſt good unleſſe the flux proceed from ſome Catarrhe or rheume.

                     There are ſome alſo which judge the Dyſenteria and the Tenaſmus by motion of the pulſe, that the patient hath a fever if the pulſe be moved ſwift; yet it ſeems to me the contrary, although there is an over heating or boyling in the blood by reaſon of the hot humors, the great motion of the body, want of ſleep and abſtinence: yet with the flux onely ſtayed, the fever hath an end.

                  Of Laudanum, Opiat Paracelſi, and the Vertues thereof.
                  
                     THere are many diſeaſes which can hardly be cured without Anodine medicines, therefore in the Cure of ſuch diſeaſes, I mean where want of reſt through extream pain or other, the great diſquiet of nature doth foretel an imminent danger of death, if reſt be not ſpeedily procured, in all ſuch caſes Anodine medicines may doubtleſs with great reaſon and good warrant be inwardly given. To procure therefore ſafe and quiet reſt, ſheweth great skill in the Artiſt, and to the Patient is more precious in his grievous infirmitie then much treaſure, but in no one infirmitie have ſuch medicine more ſhewed their admirable vertues, then that noble medicineThe chief vertue of Laudanum. called Laudanum Opiat Paracelſi hath done in the cure of that lamentable diſeaſe called Dyſenterie, or the bloudy Fluxe, as witneſſeth divers of our Nation coming from the Eaſt Indies upon good proofe, as alſo being no leſſe approved of, not onely by ancient and modern Writers, but by every expert Chirurgion coming from thoſe countries of their own, too many experiences thereof have been made.
                  The vertues of this precious Anodine to be, I mean here recited, as they are noted and ſet down very learnedly by that famous Writer Oſwaldus Crollius, late Phyſitian to Matthias the third Emperour ofOzwaldus

                         of the vertues of Laudanum. Germany in his book called Bazilica Chymica, and not by him onely, but alſo by divers good Authors of credit, which have written of the ſame medicine before, which vertues being very many, may ſeem almoſt incredible, though many of them my ſelf am witneſs of to be true, out of my daily practiſe onely; they are meant by the true compoſition, according as Theophraſtus Paracelſus hath preſcribed it, and is the ſame compoſition which the ſaid Writer mentioneth.

                           Ozwaldus concerning Laudanum. THis Laudable medicine (ſaith Ozwaldus Crollius) deſerveth rightly his name, although thou call it Laudanum, for in all ſharp pains whatſoever hot or cold within the body or without the body, yea, even when through extreamitie of pain, the parties are at deaths doore, or almoſt mad with the vehemencie of the ſame, this precious medicine giveth eaſe preſently, yea and quiet ſleep, and thatLaudanum more effic

                         by a ſuppoſitorie, or a gliſter were better: in the collick with Mintwater, it eaſeth the gripings forthwith. In the pains and gravel of the kidnies, likewiſe it giveth preſent eaſe. In the pluriſie it preſently and ſafely giveth eaſe. In pains of the joints it is verie good. In the ſtaying of rheumes, as tooth-ache and other like defluxions in the beginnings, it is a ſingular good medicine, as namely in the toothache, diſſolve foure graines thereof in Plantane water, and put it into the eare on the aking ſide, and take three grains into the body, and lie to reſt, it is a ſure help. In all fluxes of the belly, whether they proceed of ſharp or ſlipperie humours, or whatſoever elſe offending cauſe taken with maſtick, Terra Sigillata, fine Bole, or with any other appropriate good medicine, it is exceeding ſure, for it fortifieth the other medicines, and doubleth their forces, adding his own alſo thereto. In extream watchings and want of reſt, either inwardly or outwardly taken, it is profitable if outwardly you would uſe it, take foure or ſix grains, with three drops of oyl of Nutmeggs, which is preſſed out mixed together, and binde it in two little clouts, and put it into the noſtrils, it will marvellouſly aſſwage pains in the head, and cauſe quiet reſt. In the extream bleedings of the noſe called Hemoragie, it is an approved ſecret, that ſixteen grains thereof divided into two pils, and thruſt up into the noſtrils, into each noſtril one part, helpeth the ſame. In all kinds of Fevers it is good to be given with water of Worm-wood, or pill-wiſe alone, and if the heat remain after ſixe houres, you may give it the ſecond time, and after that again in like time ſafely, not exceeding the doſe: yet let your own experience lead you, that where you ſee three grains will not cauſe reſt, in the next potion you give one grain more, and ſo increaſe paulatim, but increaſe not but upon good deliberation.
                     In burning Fevers it aſſwageth thirſt, and provoketh ſleep chiefly in thoſe Fevers, in which the partie ſeemeth to have ſome ſhew of reſt, with tedious dreams and ſlumbrings mixed.
                     In the diſeaſe called Aſthma, and in the Tyſick, if it be uſed in water of Hyſſope, it will preſerve the diſeaſed Patient a long time.
                     It conſerveth the natural heat, ſtrengthneth the ſpirits, repaireth ſtrength loſt: It is alſo effectual to be given to melancholy people which are void of reaſon, and are troubled with the paſſions of the heart. It is likewiſe uſed with good effect againſt vomiting, and the Hickcock proceeding of wind, faintneſſe, or debilitie of the Ventricle.
                     In the ſuperfluous defluxions of the excremental or menſtrual bloud, it is an excellent remedy with Crocus Martis, or red coral.
                     In phrenſies and madneſſe, both in wardly and outwardly it is good mixed with Aqua vitae, and the temples anointed therewith.
                     In the falling ſickneſſe with ſpirit of Vitriol, or the quinteſſence of Camphire, with alſo oyle of Almonds, it is uſually taken. The doſe of this opiate medicine, is two, or three, or foure grains, if there be looſneſſe of the belly, as is rehearſed, it worketh much the better. Note

that in ſome parts of the world this medicine in the mentioned doſe will doe no eaſe, wherefore when you finde that by experience, in the next Patient give more, but not to the ſame Patient without great reaſon. It is beſt given in any occaſion accompanied with waters orThe beſt way to adminiſter it. other medicines which are moſt appropriate to the diſeaſes, land parts diſeaſed, and yet may very well be given alone in a pill, which I willingly do, for that the Patient then is leaſt troubled with the taſte thereof.
                     
                        A caution remarkable. But beware you uſe not this medicine to any, which are feeble through a great cough being oppreſſed with tough phlegme and ſhortneſſe of breath, for there it is not good: if the diſeaſe be violent, as I have ſaid, one doſe may be given after another, with ſix houres at the leaſt diſtance, very ſafely, but Ozwaldus Crollius ſaith, within foure houres, as is ſaid in the Cure of Dyſentery.
                     
                        The cauſe of this deſcription of Laudanum. In a word this Laudanum paſſeth all other medicines in the cure of Dyſentery, for which cauſe I have publiſhed it to the benefit of the younger fort of Chirurgions, which adventure their lives toward the Eaſt Indies; I know it is preſumption in my ſelf and deſerves blame, that I ſhould handle medicines of this nature ſo copiouſly, for which I crave pardon from that grave and learned Societie of Phyſitians of London, whom of right I ought to reverence and doe: excuſing my ſelf that I have done it merely for the benefit of young Sea-Chirurgions in the remote parts of the world, where they otherwiſe have uſed Opium in common, without underſtanding the danger or doſe thereof, to the loſſe of many mens lives. It behoveth young men to be carefull to carry with them ſuch ballance, as the beam will turn at one half of a grain, with weights and grains fitting, and to keep them warily and alwayes ready at hand for all occaſions, for he is an unworthy Chirurgion, which is at any▪time unready with ſuch needfull inſtruments.

                     The juice of Hioſcyami, or Henbane with the extract of Opium mingled, together with the ſpirit of wine, whereinto they are extracted before, is to be evaporated from them ere that they be mixed with

the reſt of the ingrediences. Alſo the opium and juice of Henbane muſt be digeſted in Chymical manner for a moneth at the leaſt, that thereby their ſulphurous, venemous, and dangerous vapours they have may be well corrected, which vapours have a yellowiſh froth or ſcumme ſeen in the ſuperficial parts of them, and are very obnoxious and dangerous, which I thought not amiſſe to adviſe the ſtudious and induſtrious Chymiſt of.

This Medicine though it would put many that profeſſe much knowledge in the Art of the Apothecarie to their trumps truely to prepare it, yet to an artiſt which is a true preparer of Medicines it is plain and pleaſant to be done, and once done, it is for his whole life a ſure medicine, and will do the work-maſter credit that uſeth it.
                     I have the rather explained this medicine for that ſo many groſſe and dangerous compoſitions are daily hatched up, and uttered abroad for currant under the name of Laudanum Paracelſi opiati, to the extream hazard of the lives of very many, and to the great prejudice of the Common-wealth, from the danger whereof God deliver each honeſt Chriſtian. And for that the younger ſort of Artiſts ſhould not eaſily be deceived with falſe compoſitions, though I confeſs it is

                        Marks to diſcern the falſe from the true Laudanum. not poſſible to eſpie ſome cunning deceits which may paſſe in farre plainer compoſitions then this is, yet take theſe few notes following when you would buy it, for remembrances. Firſt note, that the medicine is falſ, if it be uneven, I mean if it have any courſe or groſſe thing in it, ſo that it will not all clearly diſſolve as a juice of Liquorice well made will.
                     
                        Notes of the true Laudanum. For this is an infallible rule, extracts are the pure parts of things, and will wholly diſſolve, or be diſſolved. Further note, that if either honie or ſugar be found in the medicine, it is falſe.
                     Alſo if it be more liquid then the ordinarie bals of Liquorice made up in London, it is falſe or fooliſhly made, and will not keep.
                     Alſo if it retain the lothſome ſmell of Opium, it is not to be truſted.
                     Alſo if it be not merely of one colour, ſo that you ſee nothing of the ingredients appear at all, it cannot be good.
                     For aſſure thy ſelf this compoſition truely made muſt be ſmooth, and well ſmelling, of ſuch an indifferent hardneſſe, that without additions you may roule it into pils, and is not greatly ponderous or heavie, but it is of an unpleaſant taſte, I muſt tell thee, and therefore I uſe to give it, as I have ſaid, in a pill, except neceſſitie by weakneſſe of the Patient when he cannot ſwallow a pill, urge the contrary, or that I uſe it in outward griefs, as to othache, &c.

                  Collica paſsio.
                  
                     The pain deſcribed. 
                     COllica paſsio is called in Engliſh the Collick, and it is called a paſſion, becauſe the pain therefore is ſo great and vehement, that many times the patient deſireth rather to die then to live in that vehement pain. This diſeaſe hath his name of a gut called Colon, and happeneth very often when the excrements are retained beyond their naturall times and cuſtomes.
                  
                     How it happeneth. This infirmitie is engendred of ventorſitie, or wind in the gut Colon, and cannot get out, ſometimes it proceedeth of colerick humours, and untemperate heat which drieth up excrements, and hindereth the due evacuation: alſo it cometh ſometimes of cold and drie diſtemperatures with increaſe of fatneſſe, making ſtrict the paſſages of evacuation of the excrements, and weakneth the expulſive faculties. Alſo this pain proceedeth ſometimes from the humours of the ſtomack, gathering wind from the liver and milt, ſometimes from the reins of ſuch as have the ſtone. Alſo from an Apoſtume in the wombe, and ſometimes it proceedeth from all the parts of the whole body of man, as in fevers, where the humors are expelled from the veins to the guts, and proceedeth of hot and drie, or cold and drie diſtemperatures but never of moiſt, as ſaith Dom. Leo.
                  
                  
                     Signes.
                     
                        Vomiting a ſign. THe ſignes or tokens of this paſſion are both generall and ſpeciall. Generall ſignes are vomiting, lothing of meats, great pain, retention of the excrements, unreſt, grief or pain in the fore-part ofCoſtiveneſſe a ſign. the belly, conſtipation ſo great, that it will go neither upward nor downward.
                     The ſpeciall or proper accidents that do alwayes accompany the Collick are continuall thirſt, vomiting of choler, watchings, by looſeContinual thirſt. or cholerick, excrements, a ſtraining or wringing pain, though not long enduring, and young perſons in the Sommer are moſt ſubject to a looſe collick: but the tokens or ſignes of the ſtate of a cold body in old age, are ſlothfulneſſe and lazineſſe, much deſire after groſſe and cold meats, rawneſſe Nauſea, or queſineſſe of the ſtomack, ready to caſt, but cannot, Pituoſitie or ſlimie vomits, little thirſt, the pain more remiſſe but longer continuing. Rumbling of the belly, deſiringBeware of cold drink. to drink cold water, or ſmall drink. Longing after all manner of fruits, and white meats. The pain changing from place

to place, and the feces to ſwimme being put in water and very many ſuch like ſignes too tedious to trouble the Chirurgions mate withal atAuthority. this time. Avicenna ſaith, that amongſt outward ſigns of this diſeaſe, if the patient ſick of the Collick have certaine ſmall whelks or puſhes ariſing upon his belly, about the bigneſſe of a bean, ulcerating and continuing above two dayes, it is a ſigne the patient will die of the diſeaſe: Alſo when the Chollick doth not give place to Glyſters, Foments, Motions Cataplaſmes, and ſuch like good remedies: you2. Authority.
                         may then with Galen 12. Methodi Medendi, judg that biting humours doe poſſeſſe the tunicles of the guts, but if the diſeaſe yeeld or give way thereto, then the matter of the diſeaſe is contained in the cavity or hollowneſſe of the guts.
                     The Collick ſtill continuing with vomiting, cold ſweats, often ſobbing or the hicket, and not giving way to remedies adminiſtred, is deadly.
                     A peſtilentiall Collick, or contagious Collick, doth almoſt alway kill.
                     A Collick with feces voyding ſlimy ſubſtances, though an Apoſtume be in the greateſt guts, yet it is curable.
                     The Collick proceeding of winde is eaſily cured. An eaſie or good breathing, or taking breath is a good ſigne in the patient that he may be cured, but difficult breathing ſheweth the contrary.
                  
                  
                     The Cure.
                     
                        Method of the cure. THe manner of curing the Collick is effected by renewing and taking away the cauſe, and then the paine vaniſheth: But to remove the cauſe, many things are to be put in practiſe; as preparing the humours by evacuation, remiſſion and reſolution, all which require ſome long time, and therefore other meanes are firſt to be uſed to take away the paine, or at leaſt to mitigate the ſame withAnodines firſt. Anodine medicines, and the due application of convenient helps of warme and moiſt temperatures, which not helping, you muſt againeNecrotical medicines if need. have recourſe to Necroticall and Stupifying things, which indeed are not to be uſed, but in great extremities to give the patient ſome preſent eaſe.
                     Anodine medicines are to be adminſtred ſo well inwardly as outwardly; as firſt inwardly, namely in glyſters conſiſting of moiſt and fat ſubſtance, as the decoction of Camomill, Dill, Linſeed, Mellilot, Mallowes, Hollihock, Fenigreek, Bayberies, or ſome of theſe, with one ounce of the new extract of Caſsia, and ſome ſuger, with Linſeed oyle and butter adminiſtred. Outwardly, theſe are to be applyed, either Unctions, Cataplaſmes, Fomentations, Baths, or ſome ſuch like convenient medicines, as time and place beſt fitteth.
                     But if theſe ſhould not help, then in great extremities, you are to flie yet againe to Necroticall or ſtupifying medicines, as namely Landanum Paracelſi, which exceedeth all Necroticis: or Philonium Romanum is alſo a good medicine; theſe are onely to be uſed in cauſes proceeding

of heat, and never of cold cauſes; for in cold cauſes that were rather to confirm the diſeaſe, and yet in the judging whether the cauſe be hot or cold, ſometimes a good Artiſt deceives himſelf. If the Collick come of winde, then you muſt apply warm reſolving medicines, I mean diſſolving and diſperſing medicines.
                  
                  
                     Notes to be conſidered of by the Chirurgion in the beginning tf the Cure of the Collick.
                     
                         FIrſt, whilſt the meat is yet in the crude gut, I mean before it be digeſtedA caveat. and turned into excrement, no looſing medicines are to be adminiſtred, but rather a ſmall and ſpare dyet, and in the beginning to begin with mollifying glyſters, and then afterwards to proceed with more ſharp and ſtronger. But before all things, if the Patient have a full ſtomack, and withal queaſie, after a glyſter, then a vomit is principallyGlyſters and vomits. to be adminiſtred.
                     
                         Secondly, Repletion or overfulneſſe, as well as too much faſting is to be avoided.
                     
                         Thirdly, no Agarick is to be uſed in any of your medicines for the Collick, becauſe that cleaveth to the guts, and moſt bringeth terrible pain and tortions, yet Stokinus a learned Germane Writer, dothBeware of Agaricum. highly extol the ſame to be put in Glyſters to give it preſent eaſe.
                     
                         Fourthly, you muſt by cordials have a care to preſerve the Liver, Heart, and Head, leaſt they be hurt or offended by the vapours, andA caveat. over-much heat of the oyntments, cataplaſms, and fomentations which are uſually applyed to the parts agrieved.
                     
                         Fifthly, in the beginning over vehement warmings are to be avoided,A ſecond caveat. eſpecially, if the Collick proceed of the dry feces; for thereby they be the more dryed▪
                     
                     
                         Sixthly, cold water is to be avoided, and not any waies to be permitted to be uſed to quench thirſt withal, but rather let the patient uſe ſome ſtewed prunes, Julip of Violets, conſerves, and ſuch like; or a barly water, with a few drops of oyl of Vitriol and ſome licoras are good.
                     
                        Specifical remedies. Specifical things that cure the collick are very many, as horſe-dung drunk in wine, hares-dung or hen-dung drunk in Oxicratium, where ſuch may be had. Alſo the powder of Harts-horn, corral, cockel-ſhels burnt, or ſwines hoofs burnt or Calcined till they be white, and ſuch like, according to the diverſity of the cauſes. Further in the particular cures of this diſeaſe, there are very many things obſerved by the learned Phyſitians, according to the diverſity of the cauſes, which were too much to trouble the Chirurgions Mate withal at this preſent as the ayre, dyet, and divers other good helps to the cure of this grief, which cannot be obſerved at ſea, onely fiſh and water-fouls are to be avoided as much as may be.
                     
                        The Cure. To cure the Collick which cometh by means of the feces remaining, and being dried up, which happeneth moſt commonly at the ſea

in long voyages, and eſpecially in hot countries: there are three ſundry intentions to be obſerved.
                     The firſt, to mollifie the feces, and ſupple the guts.
                     Secondly, in Evacuating, to diſcharge the belly.
                     Thirdly, to remove or take away the cauſe of exſiccation, or drying up of the feces or excrements.
                     The firſt is performed with glyſters made of common oyl or butter, with the decoction of Mallows, Violets, Beets, &c, and by drinking oyl of ſweet almonds, or a decoction of Polypodium.
                     
                     The ſecond thing which doth bring forth the mollified feces or excrements is Caſsia fistula or Manna, or Diaphenicon, or Hiera, or ſharp glyſters.
                     The third intention curative, if it could be attained to at Sea, were to remove firſt the external cauſes of the diſeaſe; as over-warm ayre, over-ſalted dry meats, and ſmall quantity of food, faſting, watching, melancholy, and the like, inwardly to help the weakneſſe of the expulſive faculty, with Treakle, Mithridate, Conſerva roſarum, or the like cordial helps, helping alſo the expulſive faculty with glyſters and ſuch like good things: For further inward remedies you may uſe the aforeſaid glyſters, or half a drachme or ʒj. of Sulphur vivum drunk in warm wine, and the belly well covered with warm clothes helpeth ſomewhat.
                     Item, Carraway ſeeds made warm in wine, but not boyled therein, being drunk helpeth.
                     Item, a glyſter made of Sope and Honey is a preſent remedy.
                     Item, a bag ſtuffed with bran, and made very warm ſprinkled a little with vineger, and applyed to the belly is good.
                     Item, Goats milk, or other milk, boyled with honey, and applyed to the belly with a ſpunge, or cloth warm, in manner of a foment, healeth the Collick, and driveth away worms, and ceaſeth the pain.
                     Item, the gall of a bullock, Salgem, Aloes, common oyl, ana partes equales, mingle them and make an oyntment thereof, wherewith annoint the fundament before the fire, that looſeth the belly, and bringeth forth the hard feces.
                  
               
               
                  Tenaſmus.
                  
                     The definition of Tenaſmus. 
                     TEnaſmus or Tenaſmus, as Hippocrates calleth in his ſixth Aphoriſme and in the ſeventh book, is a diſeaſe, of extention, or ſtraining out of the right gut called inteſtinum rectum, being oppilate or ſtopped, and of ſome Engliſh writers it is called Coſtiveneſſe. This diſeaſe as Galen ſaith in his ſecond book De methodo medendi, is when a man hath an extraordinary provocation, luſt or deſire, and a vehement ſtraining to go to the ſtool, but cannot void any thing at all, except ſometimes ſome ſmall quantity of ſlymy matter, which now and then is mixed with blood or a bloody ſubſtance, and the extraordinary deſire of emptying or going to the ſtool ceaſing.
                  
                     
                     The cauſes of Tenaſmus outward and inward. Outward as Cold. Heat. Drought. A corrupt asire. Bathing in cold w

                        ter. Necrotical ointments. Inwardly as ſalt humours. This diſeaſe preceedeth of divers cauſes and accidents, both outwardly, and inwardly.
                  Outwardly by cold, coming accidentally to the hinder parts, arſegut, as the long ſitting upon a cold ſtone, upon iron, a boord, upon the cold ground, or any hard thing, whereby the Sphincture or round muſcle compaſſing the ſtraight gut is preſſed or bruiſed. It cometh alſo by intemperate heat, and drought, and corruptneſſe of the ayre and weather: ſometimes by long bathing in cold water, and ſometimes by much uſing narcotial oyntments, and ſuch like. Alſo inwardly this diſeaſe proceedeth of ſalt biting humours abounding throughout the whole body of man: alſo by means of ſome hot or cold impoſtume, or after a Dyſentery or Flux, whereas ſome cholerick matter remaineth behinde in the right-gut yet unevacuated. And ſometimes too happeneth here in our Countrey, as ſome Engliſh Writers affirm, by little drinking of Beer or Ale, and ſometimes it cometh by drinkingToo much drinking of wine. Nature of Tenaſmus. too much wine, and by eating of coſtive meates, and ſuperabundance of choler aduſt. This diſeaſe is of the nature, or diſpoſition of a Dyſentery or Flux, but that the Dyſentery paineth the Patient with greivous tortions through all the guts, but Tenaſmus paineth the Patient uſually in the right gut onely, as appeareth by Galen in his third book De cauſis Symptomat. And Trajanus in his ſixth Chapter, andGal. de cauſis & ſympt. lib. 3. Trajan. cap. 8. lib. 6. The ſigns of Tenaſmus.

In Tenaſmus the pain doth not aſcend ſo high as the navel, but is chiefly felt with heat, pricking, and burning with a deſire of emptying in the end of the ſphincture, the excrements being of a yellowiſh colourAnother ſign. in young men (like their ſtarching now adayes) but in old perſons the excrements are of a more pituos, ſlimie and bloodie ſubſtance.

                        Tenaſmus is cured by taking away the cauſes thereof, from whence it doth proceed; as if it come by outward cold, then let there be applyed to the Oſe pecken, and hippes warm, reſolving fomentations and applications, as bags of millium with ſalt, being roſted or fried, or ſacks with bran ſodden in wine, or water, and ſo applyed as hot as may be ſuffered, and the fundament and parts anointed with oyles of Rew, Lillies, Bayes, Vnguentum martiatum, and ſuch like: Alexander in his ſixth Chap. and eight book ſaith, Tenaſmus is cured with foments of Fenigreek and the roots of Altheae, being boyled and injected into the belly, and alſo the Patients hinder parts well ſuffumigated with the ſame decoction, the Patient being compaſſed about cloſe with clothes, and ſo ſet over it, and then the fundament afterward annointed with oyl of Roſes, freſh butter, or gooſe greaſe, with wax diſſolved, Bears and Capons greaſe, and ſuch like.

                     The Cauſes.
                     
                        Cauſes of the falling of the fundament. THe cauſes of this grief are too many to be named, the ſign thereof is manifeſt, that it is a reſolution or a relaxation of the muſcles of thoſe parts: whereby the gut ſlippeth or ſlideth down lower then the natural place thereof, namely, out of the body.
                     The cure of this grief is for the moſt part ſhort, and likewiſe if

It is cured as followeth, namely, at the firſt going out, uſe no other remedy then a warm ſoft clout and thy hands, and gently return it into his due place, and let the party after it is reduced, ſit on a hot board, or have a very hot napkin doubled and applied to his fundament, and another to his belly: but whereas this diſeaſe for theThe cure if it proceed of the fluxes of the belly. moſt part proceedeth from the fluxes of the belly, in ſuch caſes you muſt proceed to the cure of ſuch fluxes of the belly, and that effected you ſhall hear no more of this accident; but if it uſually fall out, it isThe cure if it uſeth often to fall down. the more dangerous, then you may proceed as followeth▪ ſet the party over a cloſe ſtoole, and fume the place as warm as he can ſuffer it, with a fume of Thus, Maſtick, amber, roſin or pitch, or any one of theſe, and being fumed well and very warm, beſtrew the gut fallen down with Album Gracum well powdered and fine, for this is precious, though a homely medicine, but therewith this diſeaſe is cured, and many other infirmities alſo; but there is a great care to be had to the powdering and well ſearſing of the ſame, for that it is often full of ſharp pieces of bones very dangerous: I ſay therefore this beingThe putting of it up. carefully prepared, and applied with warm ſoft clouts and warmedThe Patients help required. hands put it up, and let the party as it were endeavour to draw in his breath in the doing thereof, for it will with eaſe be brought up: and being thus put up, into his place, it falleth not eaſily out again; the ſame effect hath burned Harts horn powdred, or any other hard bones burned into white powder, are very good, powder of Gall-apples or Gals is thereto a good medicine ſtrewed on as the former; Pomegranate Pils powdred doth the like, and Balauſties or Sumach is alſo good, being powdred and ſtrewed thereon.

                  A Treatiſe of Salt in general: And firſt of the Antiquity thereof.
                  
                     Salt ſure in vegetables. 
                     SAlt was created with the world in the beginning, for that it is eaſy to be proved, that neither herb, bud, nor tree whatſoever groweth, which containeth not in it ſelfe a proper and peculiar Salt, which is eaſily and apparently by Art to be ſeparated from the other ſubſtances thereof, andHealth from ſalt by Gods providence. through the wonderful providence of our Almighty Creator, each Salt hath ſome needful vertue contained in it for the benefit of his creatures. A further teſtimony of his Antiquity, the Sea which tooke his beginning, asScriptures teſtifie The Sea and all creatures containe ſalt. Scriptures teſtify, before mankind doth produce the ſubſtance thereof being wholly ſalt. And not onely the Sea, but alſo all other creatures of God whatſoever under the whole heavens, whether they do conſiſt of Animal, Vegetable or Mineral parts, cannot, nor ever did ſubſiſt without a natural inbred ſalt in them, whoſe nouriſhment and increaſe proceedeth from the earth, water, or ayre, where the ſaid creature breedeth and groweth. Therefore ſince it challengeth a place with the moſt ancient and firſt creation of all things, I need uſe no more demonſtrations, but conclude that the Antiquity thereof, is undeniable, and as cleere, as the Sun-ſhine is at midday: thus much of the Antiquity thereof.
                  
                     Of the kinds and differences of Salt.
                     TO intreat of all the kinds and differences of Salt, is a worke ſo difficult and long, that no man whatſoever in the whole time ofFrivolous to write of all ſalts. this ſhort life, can make ſufficient relation thereof, wherefore to avoid tediouſneſſe, I will take a ſhorter courſe: namely, I meane to doe ſomething therein, and leave the reſt for others of better capacity, that ſhall come after. Note therefore that there are three kinds ofThree kinds of ſalt. Salts in general, to wit, animal Salt, Vegetable Salt, and mineral Salt and ere I digreſſe or go any further, let me interpret my ſelfe in plaine tearmes, to young practitioners in Art, whom alone I deſire to benefit.
                     The animal ſalt is underſtood to be that ſalt which proceedethThe three ſals explained. from creatures that bear life, and have ſenſe and feeling, or moving whatſoever, under which are comprehended all beaſts, fiſh, fowl, and

worme, &c. under the name of vegetable ſalts, are comprehended the ſalts of trees and herbs, and whatſoever elſe may grow by ſowing or planting, or any other induſtry of man, as well the ſeed as the fruit or the plant it ſelfe, or any part thereof. And under the name of mineral ſalt is comprehended the ſalts of all metals, as of Saturn, Juter, Mars, Sol, Venus, Mercurius, or Luna: as alſo the ſalts of all ſtones, with alſo all earths and their juyces and extractions, as likewiſe all other Mineral and Terreſtrial ſalts whatſoever, without name.
                     Thus much in briefe for explaining the three principal kinds of Salts, each of which have a three-fold ſeveral ſubſtance contained in them, viz. A volatile ſalt, a fixed ſalt, and a Caput mortuum, named alſo Terra Damnata, otherwiſe it may be tearmed to containe a Flegme, a ſpirit, an oyle which againe is called, Sal, Sulphur, and Mercury, each dividable plainly and eaſily by Art: Some may here object, that they will draw more then three ſubſtances, each being a good medicine from any one ſubject, either Animal, Vegetable or Mineral, as for an inſtance from Mercury, you may extract infinite ſeveral medicines, inwardly, and outwardly ſerviceable, as namely you may have from Mercury Laxative, Vomitive, Diaphoretick Diaureticke, cordial, preſervative, and ſundry other needful medicines to be miniſtred with great ſafety and comfort to the diſeaſed, as elſewhere of Mercury is noted: which ſpeech may ſeeme very ſtrange toAnſwer. ſome that all theſe, yea and many more varieties and diverſities are found in any one Mineral: but though one ſubſtance make many medicines, yet it confoundeth nothing the tria principia, for every medicine is not one principal, neither is there any principal tied toSalts good in meats, are of three ſorts. to make but one medicine. But to returne being digreſſed, I ſay the kinds of Mineral ſalts uſed at tables, and for ſeaſoning meats, are to be eſteemed three in number: one kind is the Bay or Sea ſalt, dried meerely from ſalt Sea water by the heat of the Sunne. The ſecond ſort is that ſalt which we have from the Sea coſt, or from ſalt Springs at home, made by decoction. The third is the ſalt that groweth concrete, bard and pure in the bowels of the earthſuch is the Sal Gemmae, and this laſt is held the beſt, both in meat and medicine, it is in colour like Cheyſtal tranſparent and groweth in great quantity, in Polonia, neer the Citie Cracovia, my ſelf having gathered of it in the Mines there.

                        The neceſſity of ſalt in all things. NO one thing which the Almighty Creator hath made for mans uſe, excelleth Salt: as well for the ſundry and moſt neceſſary uſes it hath, as alſo for the abundant vertues thereof, without the which, nothing which is created under the Sunne, as is ſaid, could ſubſiſt in his kind, beauty or vigor: as for example, man the excellenteſt of Gods creatures without ſalt preſently putrifieth, or at the leaſt fallethExample▪

                         affirm the ſame bloud to be ſalt. I think none will deny it, but if any will be ſo ſimple or obſtinate, then let him taſte his owne urine, and there queſtionleſſe he need not doubt to find it ſalt: but without contradiction, the whole maſſe of mans body is full of ſalt: and if thou wilt not by all this reaſon be perſwaded to beleeve it, then ſearch artificially, and thou ſhalt find, yea two kinds of ſalt in mans bloud, and ſo in all other creatures which beare life and have bloud as well as man, namely, a Volative ſalt, and fixed ſalt, which ſalt I ſay wanting in the body, that living creature which wanteth, it preſently putrifieth.Certain evils befalling man wanting ſalt. Some alſo we ſee that by a ſalt rheume in there eyes loſe their ſights, ſome by a ſharp ſaltneſſe in the urine, dangerous accidents enſue: ſome fall into the Scurvy, ſome have the Dropſie, ſome the Leproſie, with infinite other the like offences hapning by the diſtemper or want of the Animal ſalt: the examples are very common, Nihil ſale & ſole corporibus hominum utilius, ſaith Paracelſus; nothing is more profitableSalt preſerveth from putrefaction. for mans body, then the Sunne and ſalt. It is the moſt precious Balſam for mans life in health, it maintaineth health and keepeth mans food from putrefaction in ſickneſſe, ſores and aches, few medicines to be compared to it: Mineral ſalt being brought to an examen in the fire, firſt from it is by Art exhauſted a thin Mineral Phlegma, called the Mercury or fleagme thereof: which paſt, then there ariſeth a moſt fragrant ſpirit which openeth Mineral bodies, aud breaketh up gold and ſilver to make them potable, or otherwiſe according to the will of the diſcreet Artiſt, in which ſpirits is comprehended the chiefe medicine: the reſidence whereof containeth the fixed ſalt, and the feces therof: the feces are meerely good for no uſe at all, that I know, and therefore of Chymiſts are called Terra Damnata. Paracelſus ſpeaking of the neceſſary uſes of common Mineral ſalt affirmeth it to be the true Correcter of all kinds of meats, and ſaith further, that meat, though being of meane nutriment, yet if it be well ſalted nouriſheth much: for he is of opinion, that whatſoever meat is either eaten without ſalt, or but meanly ſalted, turneth for the moſt part to the offence of man, and breedeth diſeaſes, as the falling ſickneſſeSalt helpeth digeſtion, and comforteth. and other great griefs: for, ſaith he, ſalt mightily helpeth digeſtion, and concoction, and likewiſe comforteth all the faculties of mans body, it is the Balſam of the earth, whereby mens bodies areSalt the Palſamum of the earth. preſerved alive, and ſo of all creatures which containe bloud in them, yea and all inſenſible creatures alſo, as Vegetables and Minerals have their peculiar ſalt, which keepeth them in their vigor and ſtrength from common putrefaction. Joſephus Quercitanus affirmeth ſalt to be a ſpur to all medicines, both outward and inward, with which it is mixed, ſtining them up and quickning them, the better to performe their offices, and the longer to retaine their vertues, by preſerving them from outward putrefaction of the ayre.
                  
                  
                     Temperature of Salt in general.
                     
                        The temperament of common Salt. COmmon ſalt by the moſt opinions of the learned writers is hot and dry, ſome affirme in the ſecond degree, ſome in the third, this

being ſpoken concerning common ſalt as it is uſed in meat and medicine without any further preparation: but let no man attribute to all ſalts one temperament, which I ſuppoſe none which is diſcreet will, becauſe then he ſhould miſtake himſelfe; for without all contradiction,Divers Salts diverſly qualified. no temperature can be named, but ſome ſalt may eaſily be proved of the ſame temperature, wherefore it is ſaid concerning ordinary ſalts for meat uſed, whether they come from ſea, or from ſalt water by decoction, or from the ground without mans Art as ſalt Gemm doth, or from the ſalt ſprings within the land, as our Worceſter-ſhire ſalt doth: yet all thoſe have no manifeſt differences in their temperature, but may be ſaid to be hot and dry, and yet according to the ſtrength of them they may one exceede another more or leſſe in degree.
                     But ſalt Peeter which is of excellent uſe for medicine, as alſo for very many needful occaſions otherwiſe whoſe ſubſtance and qualityThe quality of Salt-Peeter. are wonderful being conſidered, yet it is apparent that the temperament thereof is cold by the effects, for it doth coole the violent boyling of the bloud, no otherwiſe then if a man ſhould coole fire with water, and yet his chiefeſt ſubſtance is ſpiritual, volatile, andThe ſubſtance of Salt-Peeter. combuſtible, if it be pure: but in truth all minerals ſhew themſelves in operation to be ſpecifical, and not truly to be diſtinguiſhed by their heat or cold: and as for the ſpirit of common ſalt the medicinal effects thereof are cooling the bloud, quenching thirſt, corroborating and refreſhing the ſtomack, &c. the taſt thereof being almoſt like the oyle of Vitriol, or rather like good juice of Lemmons
                     Further, the ſalts of animal and vegetable creatures may very well be ſaid to have their ſeveral temperaments and differences, each according to his one kind, as the ſalt of wormwood is eſteemed hot and dry like the hearb, and ſo of many other hearbs in like manner may be underſtood.

                     COmmon ſea-ſalt, boyled in the ſtrongeſt beer to the conſumption of three parts of the ſame beer, and being made ſalt as brine, is an excellent bath to eaſe the pains of the gout, as my ſelfe have provedGood for the Gout. often.

                     Moreover, there is an ordinary Lixivium, made by expert Chirurgions, for the healing Ulcers, which is Mundificative, Abſterſive, Diſcuſſive, and very Sanative, performing much in Chirurgery, the chiefe ingrediences whereof is vegetable and mineral ſalts made by decoction with vulnerary herbs in faire water to a juſt conſiſtence:The vertues of this Lixivium. this Lixivium in Tumors, Ulcers, Fractures, Diſlocations, as alſo in great Contuſions, Obſtructions, Gangrenes, and many other like infirmities, is a very good and ready medicine, the deſcription whereof is ſet downe in the cure of fractures.

Alſo the cauſticke ſtone, called commonly Lapis Infernalis, is no other thing, then meerely a vegetable ſalt, the virtues and making whereof, is not proper in this place to be ſpoken of, but ſhall in another place be mentioned. Thus much at this time concerning common ſalt.
                  
                  
                     Of Vitriol or Copperas in General: And firſt what is Vitriol.
                     
                        VItriol called in Latine, Calcanthum, in Engliſh Copperas or Vitriol, but more commonly called Copperas, is a mineral ſalt which for the worth and Vertues thereof doth farre excel many other kinds of ſalts, ſo that not without great reaſon, that worthy Theophraſtus Pvracelſus, who had truly anatomized that ſalt, affirmed and often repeated that the fourth part of Phyſick was contained in this Mineral ſalt, from whence the ſame author alſo, not unfitly, doth compareA compariſon between Copperas and wood. it to wood, of which divers formes may be formed, and divers inſtruments alſo may be made for divers operations and effects, for out of this ſalt many ſubſtances may be extracted and prepared, and many good medicines may be compounded, quite contrary in operation, and utterly diſagreeing in effects from each other; as for example, outThe divers vertues of Copperas both inward and outward. of this Mineral ſalt, medicines of great efficacy may be made, as well in purging as alſo ſudoriferous or diaphoreticks, Cordials, Anodines, Narcotick, Stupefactive, Stipticke, Corroſive, Abſterſive, Repercuſſive, Mundificative, and Sanative medicines, as alſo againſt the Epilepſie, or falling ſickneſſe and ſuffocations of the Matrix, good medicines are to be prepared thereof, and how theſe or ſome of them may be made by Art, and of their vertues, as time ſhall ſerve, by Gods helpe I have determined briefly to declare heareafter.
                     But I confeſſe I am not able to diſcover the fourth part of the great vertues of this worthy ſalt, for I daily meet with ſome new medicine therein worth the noting.
                  
                  
                     Of the different kinds Of Vitriol.
                     
                        VItriol or Copperas we may have in England of ſix, or at the leaſt of five kinds, namely Vitriolum veneris, or Copperas made of Copper, which in diſeaſes of the head farre exceedeth others

as writers affirme, and this kind may eaſily be prepared and cheape, as hereafter ſhall be ſet downe.
                     The next thereto in vertue is that kind of Copperas which grows in Hungaria, which to my knowledg we cannot well have in England, though ſome will affirme they have of it.
                     The third ſort of Copperas that is praiſed is the Roman Vitriol or Copperas, in a place whereof we doe buy a kind of blew Copperas in London, which is not the true Roman Vitriol.
                     The fourth kind is brought from Goſler, a Towne in Germany neere to the City of Brunſwich.
                     The fifth kind is commonly brought from Dansk and is ſomewhat yellowiſh.
                     The ſixth and laſt, or worſt, is our owne common Engliſh Copperas. Theſe are all the ſorts ordinarily to be bought.
                     
                        Copperas of divers Colours. Though indeed many waies, and of many colours copperas may be made, yea and of many ſubſtances, as well from mineral ſtones as earthes, which if time would ſerve, and that it were to the purpoſe ſhould be further ſhewed; but to be ſhort the Copperas I would chuſe for my uſe, is that which cometh from Goſler in Germany, it is to be had in London, and is not dear, and ſufficiently good to draw a ſpirit or oyle from, or to make any medicine for inward uſes, but for outward ordinary uſes, the common ſort of Copperas will ſerve well, and ſo it will do reaſonable well for oyl, but not yeeld ſo much.
                     
                        What Copperas for outward uſes beſt. Note that the beſt Copperas as is ſaid, is made of Copper, or of the Mineral of copper. Note further, that all copper and braſſe will wholly be converted into Copperas, yea and turne againe into his owne firſt ſubſtance, namely into copper or braſſe againe, though with loſſe. Alſo iron and ſilver will make good Copperas, ſo will divers ſorts of ſtones and earths be converted into good Copperas, and ſprings neere copper mines, they doe make Copperas of, much after the manner that ſalt-peeter is made.
                  
                  
                     The way to make Vitriolum Veneris or Copperas of Copper, is as follweth.
                     ℞ THin plates, or rather filings of Copper, what quantity you pleaſe, and Brimſtone of each a like quantity, powder the Brimſtone, and mix it with the Copper, put theſe into an earthen pan unglazed, and place them in a char-coale fire in a Chimny, and let them gently heat together till the Brimſtone take fire. Then with an iron ſtirre it a little to and fro till all the Brimſtone be conſumed: then take it from the fire, and being cold caſt it into a gallon or leſſe quantity of fair water, and it will make the water green, and in taft like Copperas; poure off that green water, filter and keep it, and ſet the ſame Copper to be made dry againe on the fire, which done, mixe it with more Brimſtone, and burne it, and quench it as before, continuing ſuch worke, till all the Copper be conſumed and turned into a pleaſant blew or green water: then mix and boyl the waters till half

or more be conſumed, and ſet them to cool, and being cold, if it beA note of the true height of dection. ſufficiently boyled, you ſhall find Copperas therein; if not boyle it more, and the Copperas will appear: then take away the ſaid Copperas which you find, and lay it to dry, and boyl the remainder of the water againe, and there will be more Copperas: take ſtill the Copperas each time out, laying it to dry, and doing ſo till all be made into Copperas. This is the beſt kind of Copperas, it is in colour of a pleaſant blew, and is eaſily to be made, and will yeeld a good quantity, namely, one pound of Copper, if it be artificially prepared, will make three pounds of Copperas.
                  
                  
                     Of Phlegma Vitriol, or of the firſt water drawn from Copperas.
                     
                        The rules in this worke. 
                        PHlegma Vitrioli is made as followeth: ℞. Copperas, put it into an Alimbecke and place it according to Art in the higheſt degree of B.

M. will be exhauſted, provided you fill your Alimbeck but two third parts full of Copperas, when ye put it to diſtill.The vertues of Plegma Vitrioli. This liquor as Angelus Salus a late Italian writer affirmeth, is good againſt paines of the head, proceeding from heat, namely the doſe being two drachmes taken faſting for certaine dayes together. It ſwageth alſo the burning and boyling of the bloud. It ſtrengtheneth all the bowels. It confirmeth the braine weakened with ſuperfluous heat by the daily uſe thereof in the Spring time, the ſtomack being purged a little before. Alſo it maketh a moiſt braine temperate This firſt medicine of Copperas was by the Ancients not known: my ſelf I muſt confeſſe have made no great uſe of this medicine, onely I have uſed it as a cooling water againſt the heat of the ſtomack, and ſometimesThe Author his experience thereof. have found it good, as alſo to foment warme with it for any ſudden inflammation in any outward part of the body due Evacuation firſt conſidered of. The ſaid Author aſcribeth many more vertues to this firſt Phelgma, or water of Copperas, which, for that I would be loth to waſte time I will not trouble the Reader with.
                  
                  
                     Of the preparation of the ſecond water of Vitriol, commonly called Spirit of Vitriol.
                     
                        Rules in the work. THis firſt recited water being well rectified, ſeparated, and kept apart: then take the glaſſe, Alembeck mentioned, containing the Vitriol, from out of the B. M. and place it in Arena, or a furnace with ſand according to Art, the Vitriol within being firſt made into fine powder, and diſtil it therein ſo long till all the reſt of the Humidity ſhall be drawne from it which the B. M. had no force to exhale. This ſecond water, you ſhall perceive to be a cleere and odoriferous water, onely remember that thou force not the water over ſtrongly, but doe it by a gentle fire.
                     
                        The effects. This liquor is good to purge the reines: it appeaſeth inward fretting

and gnawing pains, taking one drachme thereof in the morning faſting with fleſh broth.
                     It alſo cauſeth ſtore of urine, and moderately provoketh ſweat. It ceaſeth the inflammations proceeding of blows or ſtripes taken in warm broth, and mitigateth the pain thereof, but if your fire be too ſtrong, your liquor will come over ſo ſtrong, that your doſe muſt not exceed ℈j. at the moſt: wherefore be wary thereof, for a goodA Cau

                            and how it is made. VVHite Coperas is eaſily made of other kinds of Copperas, it is generally called Vitriol, or white Vitriol in Engliſh, as if it were worthy a higher or more particular name, or reſpect, when in truth, as white wax is made of yellow wax, by the bleaking it in the ayr, and waſhing it oft: ſo is white Coperas made of green Coperas,White Copera▪s weaker then green. and is thereby, in my conceit, the weaker, onely the ſuperfluous humidity is thereby evaporated, and it begetteth a new kind and ſhape, in all lotions it may ſerve in place of the other kinds of Coperas, but to draw ſpirits from, it is weaker then any other coperas that I know The vertues thereof, for the eyes excel any other medicine..
                     The chief uſes I have made there of, is for Collyriums or lotions for the infirmities of the eyes, namely againſt itchings, akings, ſmartings, defluxions, and ophthalmia's of the eyes, wherein I find it to exceed either Lapis Calaminaris, Tutia, or Camphire. The ſalt thereof maketh alſo a ſingular vomitive medicine, which I firſt learned out ofThe Salt is vnmitive. the daily practiſe of that worthy and famous Phyſician Dr. Peter Turner dwelling in St. Hellens, who highly commended it to me, and I have found it worthy his commendations in many great infirmities, the doſe is from ℈ ss. to ℥ ss and ʒ jj. it is ſafely given.

                        The kinds. FOr want of time I here come to the laſt medicine of Vitriol ere I have touched the fourth part. This Colkethor is of two different kinds, the one is from the feces of Aqua fortis, and the other from copperas, after the ſtrong oyle is extracted from it.

Thus for this time I conclude of Coperas.

                  OF SƲLPHƲR.
                  
                     Sulphur is taken in general three manner of waies 
                     
                        SUlphur is generaly taken for every fatty, oylie, or any way combuſtible part of any creature, whether it be Animal, Vegetable, or Mineral, namely, in animal it comprehends Adeps, Axungia, Pinguedo, and what elſe is combuſtible. In Vegetables it includes Roſine, Terebinthine, Gum, Oyl, Wax, Vinum Ardens, or Aqua vitae. Touching Minerals or Metals, it includes all ſorts of Bitumens, with alſo the oyles of Metals, as of Gold, Silver, Iron, or any other, together with all ſorts of Brimſtone. Alſo it comprehends all ſorts of Minral ſalts, I mean their oyles, as the oyl of Vitriol, ofA ſpecial obſervation. Example. A general rule. Allom, or of common ſalt, &c. And further it is to be conſidered, that every Animal, vegetable, or Mineral ſubſtance whatſoever, is ſaid to contain his own pec liar and different Sulphur, as for example in wine or beer, or any other liquid thing Vegetable, that ſpiritual part which is combuſtible, though it be liquid, is termed the Sulphur thereof, viz. Aqua vitae is the Sulphurous part of Wine, and ſo alſo of Beer is to be underſtood.
                  
                     Of Sulphur in particular.
                     
                        What it is. 
                        SVlphur in particular is that uſual Sulphur or Brimſtone which with us is common, of which Artiſts make divers exellent medicines, viz: Flos, Oleum, Lac, Arcanum, and Balſamum Sulphuris, as alſo Eſſentia Sulphuris, with many other profitable preparations.
                     
                        The divers appellations of Sulphur. This Sulphur or Brimſtone is tearmed the Balſome of the Earth, of ſome others it is tearmed a Mineral Terbinthine, of other ſome a Roſin or Gum of the earth, and is plentiful in all the world, for if youThe plenty of Sulphur. but note for one mean inſtance, the Sea-coles, as we term them, which we burn, even they are full of Brimſtone, whereby they kindle ſo ſoon, and burn ſo noyſome, that were they not burned in Chimnies, none could live and indure their Sulphurous fume. As alſo the Turfs in ſome places uſed for fuel, and generally all the earth is repleniſhed with Brimſtone.
                     
                        
Moreover note, that there is no M ttal, whatſoever it be, as is ſaid, but contains a natural Sulphur in it, othe rwiſe it were no Metal, forSulpher tht Father of Metals in truth many of the ancient Writers do affirm that Sulphur is the Father of all Metals, and notwithſtanding all Metals contain a part of Brimſtone or Sulphur in them; yet we ſee Sulphur or Brimſtone alſo to be an ordinary ſubſtance of it ſelf without the help of any Metal to it. Further it is apparent that Sulphur or Brimſtome is of many different kinds as is ſaid, and thus much briefly of Sulphur or Brimſtone.

                     A word or two touching the foure Elements. The foure Elements are Fire, Aire, Water, and Earth. But the diviſion which the Chymiſts of theſe times plead for touching the Elements, Joſephus Quercitanus expreſſeth in theſe words following: ſaith he, The whole world isThe whole world contained in two globes. What is comprehended in the ſuperiour Globe. What the inſeriour containeth. divided into two Globes, to wit, into the ſuperiour Heaven, which is Aetheriall and Aery, and into the inferiour Globe which containeth the Water, and the Earth. The ſuperiour Globe which is Aetheriall, hath in it fire, lightning, and brightneſſe, and this fiery Heaven is one formall and eſſentiall Element; the water and earth are the other two Elements▪ ſo he concludes, there is but three, and with him all the Chymiſts of latter times ſubſcribe, affirming that number moſt perfect which agreeth with the everlaſting Trinitie.
                     
                        Paracelſus in a Treatiſe of his, called Meteorum, cap. 1. mentioning the difference betwixt foure and three Elements, hath theſe words. Touching fire; ſaith he, fire which is eſteemed▪ one of the foure Elemente, can ſtand with no reaſon ſo to be: but as touching the Earth, the Water, and the Aire, they are truly Elements; for they give Element 
                           •
                        o man, but as touching fire, it giveth no Element, it hath no part in the breeding of man-kind, for it is well poſſible for a man to be bred, and to live without fire; but neither without aire, water, nor earth can man live, for in truth from the heavens, by help of the other two Elements doth proceed Summer and Winter, cold and heat, and all nouriſhment and increaſe whatſoever without the help of fire. Therefore are the heavens the fourth Element, yea and the firſt, for the ſacred Word ſheweth us that in the beginning God made Heaven and Earth, ſhewing that Heaven was the firſt made, and in the outward heavens are included the water and earth, which▪ ſaith Paracelſus, may be compared to wine contained in a veſſel, for wine is not gathered and prepared without a veſſel firſt had and ready, proving alſo many wayes that the fire is included within the Element of Aire, and is no Element of it ſelf. To prove the like opinion, touching the foure Elements, I could rehearſe the names of many famous Writers if I had leiſure, and that the occaſion were worth it, but the queſtion little concerneth the cure of diſeaſes by young Chirurgions, wherefore I will conclude this point my ſelf, intending neither to quarrel for to prove three, nor four, let there be four or three, either of both ſhall contentme.
                  
               
               
                  
                  Certain Fragments concerning Chirurgerie and Alchymie.
                  
                  
                     To the Chirurgicall Reader.
                     
                        LOving Reader, I held it not altogether impertinent to acquaint thee as by the way with ſome cuſtomes which I have obſerved concerning Chirurgions in forraign parts in my younger dayes travels, and chiefly in the Germane Empire, as touching their manner of allowing or approving of Chirurgions in thoſe parts, if by accident any young Artiſt ſhould affect to make trial by travel thither for his better experience, as I my ſelf have done, he may take notice hereby for his inſtruction.
                     
                        Imprimis, their orders there generally are, that every City, Town Corporte, or place priviledged, hath a conſtant rule, as by ancient tradition of the allowing of onely an uſuall accuſtomed number of Chirurgions thereunto appertaining, ſo that for one inſtance if the Citie of Hamburge hath twelve Chirurgions belonging thereto, although a thouſand pound ſhould be tendered in any way to produce a freedome for a thirteenth Chirurgion, it could not prevail, nor would be taken there; as likewiſe generally it is ſo all over Germany, and each Chirurgion is bred and muſt be a Barber, and ſo are all Barber Chirurgions; and if any one die, his Office, Art, and place reſts in the power or diſpoſing of his wife, to the uſe of her and hers, ſo that who ſo marrieth her, or compoundeth with her, of what Nation or Countrey ſoever he be that ſhall exerciſe the place, it is alike provided he be brought in by the widdow, as her husband or agent for her, he is capable of a place void, having firſt made his maſter-piece, and performed ſome Manuall exerciſes uſuall with them in his art of Chirurgerie, thereby to give a ſufficient teſtimony to the world of his anſwerable skill in his Art or Science, as namely, either by grinding, and ſetting a delicate lancet, and therewith opening ſeverall veins ſmoothly, for the more manifeſt effecting whereof to the brethren of his calling, one will lend him his vein, namely, one on the thumb, one on the foot, and one on the arme, one other on the forehead, as alſo by the neat and exact making an artificial Emplaſter, Vnguent, or the like: which done, being by reſt of the Maſters of the Citie approved of, and ſome other rites and ceremonies anſwering to his calling by him performed, according to the cuſtome of the place that he intendeth to reſide in, he is then being

eſteemed a Regular perſon, and alſo having made the Brotherhood of the place and himſelf well drunk once, twice, or thrice, he is, I ſay, (ipſo ſ

But our cuſtomes are different from theirs, and are far better, namely, our Company of Chirurgions of the Citie of London, in the Hall of the Society, have a more commendable cuſtome, for we not onely examine Chirurgions, and try their skils in that way, as being of ancient time uſed and practiſed amongſt us, but alſo we have profitable, learned and experienced Lectures read amongſt us, having two laudable ends and effects in them, the one in teſtifying their own, I mean the Readers ſufficiencies; the other in ſeaſoning and inſtructing of their auditours, namely, the younger ſort of practitioners in the Art they profeſſe: and yet they have a third good end, namely, they ſerve for the publick good of the whole Common-wealth, by training up, and breeding of able Chirurgions upon all occaſions.

And of theſe our laudable cuſtomes and exerciſes in our Hall, my ſelf have been both an eye and eare witneſſe to divers worthy Artiſts at their Lectures there, that have ſhewed themſelves Maſters indeed in their Arts to their due commendations (Virtus landatur ab illis) as alſo at the Lectures of divers learned Doctors in that place: but as for my ſelf, although I have there as I may not deny exerciſes by publick reading of Lectures in my turn and place, yet my ambition at the higheſt hath been openly to deliver my ſelf to the world to the Chirurgions Mate, as aſpiring to ſoar no higher, (Ne ſutor ultra crepidam.) In which being, firſt I have explained to the world a Modell of the Military Chirurgions cheſt, with the inſtruments and medicines fitting thereunto, as elſewhere is recited, thereby to intimate to the younger Chirurgions in ſome ſort how they may make uſe of them in all publick ſervices for the better performance of their duties in their callings, upon all military occaſions, for the more ſpeedy curing of ſuch infirmities as Sea-men and Souldiers are moſt incident unto, and having finiſhed my intent therein, at the intreaty of ſome of my good friends, I thought it fit, though in brief, to write ſomewhat by way of addition to my former edition of Sal, Sulphur and Mercury, and, namely, how they are made the more known and uſeful unto us by the Chymick art, or the art of Alchymie which the Chirurgions ought to be verſed in, and which in brief is thus defined.

                     Secunda definitio.
                     
                        Oſwaldus Crollius Alchymia eſt ars perficiendi magiſterii & eſſentias pur as & miſtas, ſeparato corpore extrahendi.
                  
                  
                     A ſecond definition thereof
                     Alchymie is an Art which produceth magiſterial, and eſſential medicines from mixed bodies.
                  
                  
                     The parts of Alchymie.
                     
                        Libanius. The parts thereof by ancient Writers are accounted two, namely,

                           Encheriae,
                           Alchymiae.
                        
                     
                     
                        Encheriae is ſaid to be that part which performeth the operative parts of the Art.
                     
                        Alchymiae is tearmed the mixing and finiſhing part of the ſaid Science.
                  
                  
                     Of the antiquary, the firſt inventers, and worthineſſe of the excellent Art of Alchymy.
                     IT is recorded by ancient Writers that the firſt inventer thereof was Tubal Cain, ſpoken of in the holy Scriptures, who as ſome Writers ſay, was called Vulcan, Is enim primus in metallurgia laboraſſe ſcribitur. That he did firſt of all men work in Metals, which is within the ſcope of Alchymie, and not the leaſt part thereof.
                     After him as Records witneſſe, Hermes alſo called Mercurius Triſmegistus, an Egyptian king, was a worthy Inventer or founder of Alchymie, being famous in his daies for the tranſmutation of metals, whereby certain inſtrumental parts belonging to the hidden myſtery of Alchymie bear their names, that is to ſay, Vas Hermetis, Pellicanus Hermetis, Sigillum Hermetis, &c. This Hermes as is ſaid by Huſius an ancient writer lived king of Egypt about the year of the world 2646. ſo alſo in the learned Meſues works is mentioned Pill. Hermat. Hiera Hermetis, &c.
                     The Art of it ſelf is alſo called Ars Hermetis, and for the tranſmutation of metals that is alſo underſtood with Gebreus Mauritanus to have proceeded from Hermes, the which in this work the Author intends not at all to handle, but onely of the inventers of this Art: ſome writers ſay, the Arabians, and others the Perſians, are thought to be

the firſt that have prepared metals fit for medicines, and alſo have practiſed the diſtlling of Liquors: whence Avicen of Sanſano is ſaid to have ſtudied Alchymie, and he maketh mention of Sublimation and precipitation. Alſo many other Princes and Philoſophers moved thereunto no doubt de preſcientia Dei, eſteemed themſelves exceedingly graced by the works they performed in that Art for the curing of many infirmities.
                     Amongſt which one of the moſt famous and ſo moſt truly worthy was that excellent Philoſopher for art and experience Philippus Theofraſtus Bombast, otherwiſe named Paracelſus, who deſcended from a princely family in high Germany, in the countrey or Province of Helvetia commonly called Switherland; upon whoſe monument, to his perpetual fame is ingraven the verſes following.

                           Divinus tali eſt Paracelſus in arte mon archa,
                           Secula cui ſimilem nulla tulere virum.
                        
And whoſe engraven Motto was:
Alterius non ſit qui ſuus eſſe poteſt.
And Bazillius Valentinus ſeconded him, who having his lights from the former exceedingly beautified the Chymick Art, by compoſing medicines of unſpeakable worth to future ages, far exceeding their worthy predeceſſors as is manifeſt; for what compariſon can there be betwixt medicines made of vegetables, decocted, contunded or mixed how artificial ſoever, if compared with Elixers, Quinteſſences, Tinctors, and like extracts of price, which are not onely dureable for many yeers without change, eaſie and pleaſant to be received into mans body in his greateſt weakneſſe, but alſo they excel all Galeniſtical compoſitions for the eradicating inveterate maladies, as experience more then ſufficiently manifeſteth. For example, ſuppoſe a ſweat provoking medicine were to be uſed of four, ſix, or eight grains, being a Diaphoretick of gold, or ſuppoſe but of Sulphur in or with a fitting vehicle given, as, namely, in a little Mithridate, Conſerve of Roſes, that by cauſing a gentle ſweat would extinguiſh a peſtilential fever: were it not far eaſier for the ſick to receive into his body then a decoction made of ſudorifick herbs, as Carduus Angelica, or Centaury with Mithridate and ſyrups juſtly compoſed, as in that form is uſual, or that an Extract being a Catholicon purgans ten or fifteen grains whereof being extracted from a vegetable, which without any offenſive nauſeous taſte, or bitterneſſe at all, doth work effectually to the deſire of the Artiſt, ſuppoſe you it ſhall not be as much to the reputation of the Artiſt, and to the content and profit of the patient, as if he had taken a doſe of Diaphenicon, or confectio Hamech, with the uſual additaments of decoctions or ſyrups thereunto as vehicles added.
                     Or that a doſe of a Panchiagagon of 20. grains be not far more grateful to a ſick ſtomack, then an ounce of Diacatholicon de ſucc. Roſarum,
                        
                        Confectio Hamech, or the like, it being daily manifeſt that the very ſight of large doſes of medicines, although good, are nauſeous, and abhorred of the weak ſtomack, yea that many Patients will endure the diſeaſe rather then the medicine; whereas on the contrary true prepared Chymick medicines are not onely grateful to be received into the body, but alſo, as is ſaid, far excel the others in vertue and potent operation: and whereas the Chirurgion cannot at all times adviſe with the learned Phyſician, as fitting and moſt requiſite he ſhould in caſes of Phyſick, where ſuch may be had for the health of his patient, as namely, the Chirurgion being at Sea, and upon long Voiages, or at land in the Camp or Countrey, where learned advice cannot readily be had, they have eſpecial reaſon if they be men provident to be furniſhed with ſuch medicines as are ſmall of doſe, and light of portage, being alſo ſuch as do not putrifie, nor in one year change their accuſtomed natures and vertues, no nor in any Voiage how long ſoever: all which Chymick medicaments do well perform, yea though they be carried in ſhips and paſſe the line more then once.
                     Whereas few medicines made of Vegetables that are in common practiſe, though ſound from the Apothecaries ſhops, will be found ſerviceable upon juſt occaſion if they go but a ſix monethes voyage, as daily experience ſheweth, and as the Reader may eaſily conceive: wherefore then how needful, precious, and how truly valuable ſuch medicines be, let any indifferent perſon judge, that being truly made, duely adminiſtred, and their doſes and uſes obſerved and known.
                  
                  
                     A further explanation of Alchymy containing a diviſion of Natures whole works into three parts, viz. Animal, Vegetable and Mineral.
                     
                        OSwaldus Crollius a learned writer, as alſo Beguinus, and divers others with him of that ſort do affirm that tota natura inferior ſub Sole in tres partes dividitur, viz. Animalia, Vegetabilia, & Mineralia. The whole inferior work of Nature under the Sun is divided into theſe three principles, viz. into Animal, Vegetable, and Mineral creatures. The Animal Creatures are termed or ſaid to be all whatſoever containeth life: the Vegetable creatures are tearmed or meant to be all that which groweth. And under the Mineral part is included all metals, ſtones, minerals, and whatſoever it be that neither vegetateth, upon the upper face of the earth, nor liveth:and from each of theſe three, by learned Authors is taught, and by experience is found out, that there is again a threefold ſubſtance to be extracted, and perfectly to be made apparent in every of theſe creatures; and theſe threefold ſubſtances are called Sal, Sulphur, and Mercury: and beginning with the laſt firſt, their further definitions follow.
                  
                  
                     
                     A brief definition of Mercury.
                     
                        MErcury is a liquid ſubſtance ſower, or ſharp, volatile, penetrable, ayrie, and moſt pure, from which all nouriſhment proceedeth, as alſo all ſenſe, motion, ſtrength, and colour, and the keeping back old age from man, chiefly next the divine operations of God reſteth therein, and it agreeth well with the elements of aire and water; for to the former it is ſubject upon every offered occaſion to vaniſh into the ſoft aire: to the latter, in that it is very difficultly contained in any ſtraight or certain bound, but eaſily in a vaſte or wide capacitie. Likewiſe there are that define Mercury to be a liquid ſubſtance, that is Eger, Porous, alwaies moveable, often mutable, and ea
                           •
                        ily penetrable, and a body that is moſt pure and heavenly, moſt ſubtile, and of a lively and ſpiritual ſubſtance, being the food of life, and yet a ſhape, that is alſo moſt mutable, concerning his ſeveral ſhapes of all other creatures; whereupon Phalopius tearmeth Mercury, Miraculum naturae mundo, The miracle of Nature in the world. In which definition, if the Reader may ſuppoſe I ſpeak this of the vulgar Mercury, viz. Quick-ſilver, and the wonderful Imps of his production, he takes me off too ſhort by figure. Wherefore I here conclude the definition of Mercury, and paſſe to Sulphur.
                     
                  
                  
                     A brief definition of Sulpur.
                     
                        SVlphur by the ancient Writers is ſaid to be the balſam of Nature, it is ſweet, oyly, and clammy, preſerving the natural heat of the body, being the inſtrumental cauſe of all ſtrength, of all increaſing or generation, of all tranſmutation, and the fountain and well-ſpring of all ſents both ſweet and ſtinking: and it is compared unto fire, by reaſon of the flame which it eaſily gathers, as other gummy and oyly bodies do, and this one thing is proper to it, that it hath force of making fit and conglutinating the greateſt contraries; and Beguinus a famous late writer, giveth an example thereof: For, ſaith he, thou can
                           •
                        t never make a fit clay with water and fand, unleſſe thou mingle Lyme or ſome other conglutinating body with it, ſo neither fleeting Mercury, nor fixed Sal, can by any means be forced into one ſubſtance, and framed into one body, but by a band and fetter of Sulphur, which participates through the clammy and viſcous ſubſtance thereof with both the natures of Sal and Mercury, and ſo joyneth them into one, to wit, it maketh a true accord betwixt the dryneſſe of Sal and the moyſtneſſe of Mercury, by the thickneſſe and viſcouſneſſe of Sulphur, and ſo conjoyneth them both joyntly into one body, neither may this Sulph
                              •
                           r be taken to be meerly Brimſtone, but rather which in truth it is the fatty and combuftible parts of the body, or ſubſtance from which it is drawn, be it of what quality ſoever.
                  
                  
                     
                     A brief definition of Salt.
                     SAlt hath a body that is drie, ſavourie, and bitter, defending both the mixed and unmixed parts from putrefaction; it exceedeth in the faculties of diſſolving, and diſcuſſing, coagulating, evacuating, and ſcowring; and yet from Salt is all the vertue of the two laſt recited principles borrowed, with their taſtes, and infinite other excellent properties it have, ſo as the analogie of it anſwereth the earth, not becauſe it is merely cold and drie, for in truth Minerals generally have no certain temperaments, nor can be confined truly under the attributes, hot, cold, dry, or moiſt, for that a Mineral is an elementarie body that is of it ſelf firm and fixed; and therefore for his operative excellencie is unſearchable, ſpecifical, and incomprehenſible, not to be limited or ſubjugated to any one temperament, neither to be comprehended within humane capacitie. This may ſeem unto the Reader but a ſtrange Paradox, except by a plainer definition it be explained, as namely, whether that the Salt here mentioned is 
                           •
                        eally Salt, ſuch as is commonly uſed for ſalting meat, and alſo to declare that Sulphur is really Brimſtone, and that Mercury hath the name of Quick▪ſilver generally: Unto all which I anſwer, They are; And yet as is ſaid, they are not merely ſo, 
                           •

                     A briefe Chymicall Narration concerning the ſeven principle Metals, denominated according to the ſeven Planets.

                        ient Philoſophers Chvmiſts alſo have aſcribed to each of theſe ſeven metals, or rather to the medicines made of them, a certain ſpecificall or

more peculiar operative power, or facultie in the curing of the diſeaſes of ſome one part of mans body more then of another, and namely, unto Sol or Gold and his medicine, is aſcribed a ſpecificall facultie or hidden vertue, more exquiſite in the cures of the diſeaſe of the heart, unto Luna or Silver, the cures of the infirmities of the head, and chiefly of the brain are aſcribed; and to Jupiter or Tin, is referred the help of the diſeaſes of the Lungs, unto Mercury, or Quick-ſilver, is aſcribed an eſpeciall priviledge in the cures of the diſeaſe of the Liver; unto Saturn or Lead, is appointed the healing of the infirmities of the Spleen; Mars or Iron, is ſaid to cure the griefe of the Kidneyes beſt, and unto Venus or Copper, is left to heale the defects of the Genitals, and this is not onely ſo eſteemed, but alſo practiſed accordingly, and that by Authoritie of many famous Writers ratified, as of Joſephus Quercitanus, Tho. Muffetus, Jacobus Swinglerus, and very many other worthy Authors in that Art, the number of which it would be tedious to repeat, in regard that all and each of theſe Minerals have their ſeverall medicines proceeding, or made out of them, which although they all doe n

I fear I may trouble your patience in dwelling too long upon this falſe fellow Mercury, whom fully to diſcover with all his miraculous effects, eſpecially if I ſhould unfold all his perfidious cluſions and treacheries againſt the poore Patients that are under his dominion, that onely ſubject would fill a large Volume, and yet I muſt ever confeſs, as I have ſaid elſewhere, I have found him my good friend many times at a pinch▪ yet let no Artiſt that truely feareth God be too bold with him: for that Mercury (under the Roſe be it ſpoken) is a cruel Man-ſlaier, and hath wounded, defamed, yea, and murthered thouſands in corners, yea and doth play the Devil daily both in Citie and Countrie; and that under a vizard of vertue, yea and ſometimes under the Roſe doth it Cum privilegio Magiſtra

For it is then too late to call to mind whether Art or Nature were too blame, or by which the errour proceeded: for, under favour be it ſpoken, ſometimes it is caſt upon the knave Mercury▪
                         which then he ever retorts it upon the Impoſer: and he the Impoſtor, like a jugler, blames poore Venus with the cauſe, but how true God knoweth▪ yet ſhe, prettie poore ſhamefaſt ſoul, being amazed and abaſhed, knowing her ſelfe to be a ſinner, yet conceiving it unmercifull

that her ſweet lover and friend ſhould die by the cruell hand of a murtherer Mercury, for a little ſweet pleaſure; ſhe hath no wit to lay it where truely it ſhould be, but plead Ignoramus, conceiving yet dares not ſay that ſome of the greater Planets, as Sol, or Luna, by their gliddering ſhews wrought with ſome body that perhaps ignorantly put that Idol Mercury by Vulcans means, to play the Dragon. And ſo no more of that, Foelix quem faciunt aliena pericula cautum, &c. leaving ſuggeſtions and conceits, and may be's.
                     We will again to our intended ſcope, namely, to ſpeak of better things, concerning the ſecrets of the Art, and leaving the errours of Impoſtors with all their baſe and dangerous eluſions and abuſes, and proceed to the information of the well diſpoſed younger artiſts. And in this place conſidering that Mercury is appointed and appropriated, as formerly is expreſſed, to the cure of the diſeaſes of the Liver. I cannot but put the Reader in minde to admire the exceeding deep wiſedomeProv. 7. 6. to the end. of that moſt prudent King Solomon, as appeareth in the Proverbs, in his deſcription of the whoriſh woman, who after his ſetting forth of her dangerous wiles and cunning inticements for the intrapping of the fooliſh young man, he thus concludes: The young man goeth after her as an Oxe to the ſlaughter, or as a fool to the ſtocks, till a dart ſtrike through his Liver; or as a bird haſteth to the ſnare, not knowing it is for his life: and concludes, her houſe is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death. In which attributes of Mercuvie, as aforeſaid, to the healing of the Liver, it ſeems to me Mercury is as it were by God and Natures appointment prefigured and enjoyned for the healing of the fooliſh young man that had the dart ſtrucken through his Liver; for I am confident that dart was by Solomon meant the contagious diſeaſe of the French pox, which by coitu vel contact

                           , the poor fool gained by his folly from the whoriſh woman; for that the learned and expert artiſt, not onely by the pulſe and the urine, but by the complaint of the Patient, yea and by his very countenance may gather his diſeaſe, and that Solomons Dart hath ſtricken his Liver even with the pox. For in the perfect cure whereof, the Liver is firſt to be rectified, for the which work I had almoſt ſaid Mercury is beyond compariſon, if he be well guided by the experienced artiſt: But if otherwiſe, Mercury is a Dragon, who for healing and killing hath no fellow, as I formerly have denoted more then once. And whereas it is vulgarly alledged that Chymick medicines prepared of Minerals, and namely of Mercury, are dangerous and deadly, it is not denied but that they are ſo, if that by art (purū ab impuro) the pure from the impure be not ſeparated; but this advantage the true Chymiſt ſaith he hath, that in the preparing of his medicines he can take the pure from the impure. Whereas even by the books of Hippocrates, Galen, Diaſcorides, and very many of the moſt reverend ancient Writers it is manifeſt, witneſſe Antidotarium Mirſpitium, and many other works and diſpenſatories which teſtifie that they themſelves have not at all, ſo much as undertaken to ſeparate purum ab impuro, but have made and adminiſtred many Minerall medicines being of crude and unpurified

ſubſtances amongſt the reſt. Bondeletius uſed to give crude Mercury in pills to robuſt bodies to kill worms, and for the pox: and Crato a famous Phyſitian to three Emperors, is ſaid to have uſed to adminiſter Zinabrium for the giddineſſe of the head. Julius Alexandrinus, Matthrolus and Geſnerus, theſe all uſed to give crude Copperas in Fluxes, as witneſſe Beguinus, and Falopius uſed crude filings of Iron in menſtruous obſtructions, alſo in the Jaundiſe; and crude Sulphur in the effects of the Lungs. The premiſes therefore conſidered, judge then if the true prepared Chymick medicines given with judgement be not far more noble and worthy in themſelves then they aforeſaid, and the rather to be embraced, in that it is daily manifeſt, that the Galeniſtical preparations of vegetable medicaments fail much in their aſcribed or preſcribed vertues, eſpecially with our Sea Chirurgions, as is ſaid in forraign parts, to the danger, yea and to the loſſe of many of their Patients; yet not in the leaſt excuſing of the abuſes by falſe prepared Chymick medicines, and the harm they produce by their unskilful preparations, and the abſurd adminiſtration of them, alluding whereunto divers worthy and famous Writers have mentioned caveats, and namely, Laurentius Hofmanes, a learned German Chymiſt in his book entituled De vero uſ

                        An Hiſtory. A falſe Chymick medicine prepared unduely, and ſo given (ſaith he) may not unfitly be compared to certain dangerous ſubtil Rats in India, which by nature do watch the Crocodile of thoſe parts, which uſually ſleeps with his mouth wide open, and theſe Rats being ſmooth and ſoft in their entrance, do not awake the poor Crocodile at all, but go in at his mouth very ſmoothly, and eaſily without troubling him by taſte, touch, or ſmell; yet nevertheleſſe, after they are got quietly into his bowels, forthwith they with their divelliſh ſharp ſmall teeth, begin to bite the poor Crocodile, and in a ſmall time they do ſo corrode his entrals, that they make their own way out at their pleaſure, by the killing the poor creature, and that if not immediately, yet by a languiſhing deadly diſeaſe, they perform their divelliſh end by perforating his entrals, and ſo that improvident creature dyeth.
                     The occaſion of the aforeſaid Author, his alledging this compariſon, proceeded by reaſon ſuch an Indian Rat, or rather in truth by a falſe Mineral medicine put into the body of a Brother of his, as he affirmed, which very ſmoothly went in at his mouth, but within a ſhort time had cruelly effected the killing of the party. Alſo to the ſame purpoſe, one Foreſtus of Paris a learned Writer affirmeth upon his knowledge, that thouſands of people in that city, have dyed by taking of dangerous, & not well prepared Mineral, & for the moſt part Mercurial medicines, and one Crato an ancient Writer alſo affirmeth, that he kept a note of above eighty perſons, which to his knowledge had been killed abſolutely in one year in the City where he dwelt, by one Impoſtor, and that by the onely giving of Turbith Mineral,

and yet of theſe but very few, but become or ſeemed for a moneth or two, to have been well cured of their diſeaſes, and yet after a ſmall time they languiſhed away and dyed, ſome of Conſumptions, others of more fearful accidents by that moſt peſtiferous Indian Rat, be it for Sal, Sulphur, or Mercury, unduly prepared.
                     And Cardanus, an ancient worthy Writer, reporteth of a woman ſometime his Patient, who dying of a vehement pain in her head, after the receiving of divers Mercurial medicines, which being dead; himſelf took out ℥ij. of crude Mercury, from within her ſcull.
                     And he alſo relateth of another, who after a Mercurial unction taken, vomited up Argentum vivum in drops at the mouth and dyed thereof, and my ſelf in Saint Bartholomews Hoſpital having been there a Chirurgion 23. years, have obſerved very many, to have moſt pitifully been abuſed that way by Empericks, fooliſh women, and by baſe Impoſtors, who after in ſhort time have dyed by bad Chymick medicines.
                     It is reported of Cardanus, that in his time he would ſay, he was confident, that if he might have for every man, woman, and childe, that precipitate had killed, the value of one ſhilling, he ſhould be richer then any living man, in the City where he lived.
                     And Andreas Libavius, doth report of a certain Medicaſter of his time, which gave his Patient two pils of Mercury, of the firſt he fell into an Apoplexy, and of the ſecond into a Lethargy, and ſo dyed immediately.
                     He alſo ſpeaketh of another, who had the winde Collick, unto whom a Barber gave three Mercurial pils, who purged thereby continually until he dyed.

                     I fram'd and laid aſide:
                     Intending youths which leiſure have,
                     might view what I have tride.
                  
                  
                     And as occaſion them ſhould leade,
                     might ſearch, yea find and know
                     The principles which follow here,
                     from which great treaſures flow.
                  
                  
                     Three principles the Chymiſts hold,
                     each creature doth contain,
                     And four the Methodiſts have taught,
                     and learnedly maintain.
                  
                  
                     Three muſt I needs confeſſe I find,
                     confirmed all by reaſon:
                     And yet from four to vary ought,
                     I doubt 'tis petty treaſon.
                  
                  
                     Upon this Theame two ſchollers might
                     well ſeven years good time ſpend:
                     Continuing ſtill in argument,

                     Wherefore ambiguouſly to wade,
                     within a ſea of ſtrife,
                     I like it not for fear of knocks,
                     I love a quiet life.
                  
                  
                     All worthy Artiſts I adore,
                     and duty binds me ſo:
                     Yea thankfully Ile learn of each,
                     the thing I do not know.
                  
                  
                     
                     And ere Ile ſeem once to contend,
                     my will ſhall be ſo even:
                     I know there's three, I yeeld there's four,
                     to make the ſum up ſeven.
                  
                  
                     But will you know why Chymiſts call
                     their principles but three?
                     With heavenly number it agrees,
                     from all Eternitie.
                  
                  
                     A Trinitie in Deitie,
                     moſt ſacred and mo&;st ſure:
                     All ſhould confeſſe in unity
                     is, was, and ſhall endure.
                  
                  
                     From which, as from a perfect guide,
                     each man his work ſhould frame,
                     And in his converſation true,
                     alwaies reſpect the ſame.
                  
                  
                     In honour of which Deitie,
                     true Chymiſts daily find
                     A tripart ſubſtance for to be
                     of all things following kind.
                  
                  
                     Which in the earthly ſphear are found,
                     each one in his degree.
                     And theſe by Artiſts ſtiled are
                     Sal, Sulphur, Mercurie.
                  
                  
                     Who calling unto reckoning all
                     that Animals do ſeem,
                     Of Vegetables in their kinds,
                     they make no ſmall eſteem.
                  
                  
                     Likewiſe from minerals each one,
                     great medicines they derive:
                     Which do root out inveterate griefs,
                     and keep men long alive.
                  
                  
                     The Mercury that's volatile,
                     the Sulphur burnes like fire:
                     The Sal in fundo to remain,
                     as Chriſtal's their deſire.
                  
                  
                     Each of theſe three to three again,
                     the Artiſt can produce,
                     Which done and joyn'd the medicines pure,
                     and fit for each good uſe.
                  
                  
                     
                     Thus have I in one Period
                     anatomized plain:
                     True medicines how thou mayſt prepare,
                     if thou wilt take the pain.
                  
                  
                     But if that any further ſeek,
                     in true Philoſophie:
                     The Minerals fix and pure to make,
                     that is no work for me.
                  
                  
                     I to my Latchet will return,
                     and reſt me in a mean:
                     Good medicines onely to prepare,
                     I hold ſufficient gain.
                  
                  
                     And unto young men that have mind,
                     in Alchymie to venture:
                     Ile ſhew them to the Labyrinth,
                     which who ſo liſt may enter.
                  
                  
                     Foul hands and face he muſt not ſcorn,
                     if ought good he would find:
                     With coales and fime to be beſmeer'd,
                     it is the Chymiſt kind.
                  
                  
                     The trowel, brick, with hammer oft,
                     and ſhovel he muſt uſe,
                     The cliffes, the tongs, and bellowes eke,
                     he no way may refuſe.
                  
                  
                     His grates of iron he muſt fit,
                     his rings to cut his glaſſe:
                     With pots of iron, braſſe or clay,
                     his furnace he muſt paſſe.
                  
                  
                     The Retort and the Alembick ſafe,
                     with lute he muſt defend:
                     And vaprous ventils have in care,
                     thoſe muſt he often mend.
                  
                  
                     And why, in vain he makes a fire,
                     which cannot rule the ſame:
                     For therein reſteth all the Art,
                     the pleaſure, gain, and fame.
                  
                  
                     Yet that's not all he ought to know,
                     that would a Chymiſt be.
                     A thouſand things are yet behind,
                     as he ſhall find and ſee.
                  
                  
                     
                     But he that takes delight in ought,
                     regardeth not the pain:
                     So he may have the thing he ſeeks,
                     although it be but vain.
                  
                  
                     A Chymiſt that would duly work,
                     muſt readily define
                     The characters, which he ſhall read,
                     and ſpels of ancient time.
                  
                  
                     Each Mineral he ought to know
                     his malice, force, and might,
                     Or he may ſoon beſhrew himſelf,
                     if he miſtake the right.
                  
                  
                     The twelve ſigns of the Zodiack,
                     he ought to know by heart,
                     Conjunction, Oppoſition too
                     of Planets, though in part.
                  
                  
                     The Sextile, Trine, and Quadrile eke,
                     the Dragons head and tail,
                     The Planets orders how they raign,
                     and where their force may fail.
                  
                  
                     In termes of Art, which divers are,
                     inſtructed he muſt be,
                     Amalmagate, alcolizate,
                     and cohobate muſt be.
                  
                  
                     To calcine and for to cement,
                     to circulate alſo,
                     To colliquate, coagulate,
                     and congelate, I trow.
                  
                  
                     To colorate, to corrodate,
                     conglutinate likewiſe:
                     Coagmentate, coadunate,
                     whereby to win the prize.
                  
                  
                     Sometime digeſtion needful is,
                     and deliquation too,
                     Divaporation is a work,
                     the Chymiſt wiſe muſt do.
                  
                  
                     Where diſtillations do prevail,
                     Diſtraction takes the head,
                     Then by Elaboration,
                     wiſe men may be miſlead.
                  
                  
                     
                     Election needful is in all,
                     evaporation too,
                     Expreſſion and extraction are
                     two things that he muſt doe.
                  
                  
                     In exhaltations he muſt ſtrive,
                     and Ebullitions make,
                     His fermentation oftentimes
                     will cauſe him to awake.
                  
                  
                     His filterations many are,
                     his fumigations eke,
                     And moſt in his fixations,
                     the good man is to ſeek.
                  
                  
                     Gradations then are thought upon,
                     and granalation more,
                     Incorporation hath his time,
                     Igniſion pincheth ſore.
                  
                  
                     And Levigation hath his place,
                     and Liquefaction uſe:
                     Then to Lutation have a care,
                     therein be no abuſe.
                  
                  
                     For all mortification
                     can do, or elſe can ſay,
                     I hope multiplication,
                     the coſt and pains will pay.
                  
                  
                     He ſuffers Maſaration,
                     and Maturation both,
                     Embracing putrifaction foul,
                     which many a man would loth.
                  
                  
                     Precipitation was forgot,
                     purgation goeth before,
                     And by projection he ſhall find,
                     if he be rich or poor.
                  
                  
                     But if his hopes yet chance to fail,
                     Reduction thought upon,
                     Reſtrinction, Reverberation,
                     and Reſolution ſtrong.
                  
                  
                     Then Repurgations often had,
                     with Segregations fine,
                     Some Sublimations duly us'd,
                     may well become the time.
                  
                  
                     
                     Stratifigations in due place,
                     Solutions eke in time.
                     Subduction never wanting is,
                     a Chymiſt to define.
                  
                  
                     Of Torrefactions he hath ſtore,
                     Vivifications hope,
                     But finds vitrification,
                     or vani
                           •••
                         all in ſmoke.
                  
                  
                     What ſhall I ſay? this is not all,
                     the Chymiſt muſt abide
                     This Labyrinth out, his glaſſe then breaks,
                     his patience there is tride.
                  
                  
                     Yet grant to this although t'were more,
                     there's no man ever knew,
                     A work ſo ſlight and cheap as this,
                     ſuch rare effects to ſhew.
                  
                  
                     In gaining health to ſick and ſore,
                     preſerving men from woe:
                     Yea ſundry waies expelling griefs,
                     which in mans body grow.
                  
                  
                     By true Elixirs of much price,
                     by Quinteſſenſes high,
                     And many famous medicines more,
                     which I for haſte paſſe by.
                  
                  
                     Though once a Galleniſt ill led,
                     devis'd a ſlanderous rime,
                     Which he in Latin verſe put forth,
                     I know not well the time.
                  
                  
                     And this it was that followeth next,
                     which if it prove a lie,
                     Ile no way ſeem him to excuſe,
                     you have't as cheap as I.
                  
                  
                     Alchymia eſt ars ſine arte,
                     cujus ſubjectum eſt pars cum parte,
                     Proprium ejus probè mentiri,

                     But leſt I ſhould be deemed one,
                     'mongſt birds that file their neſt,
                     Ile leave this doubtful verſe as 'tis,

                     Common it is with Chymiſts true,

                     Fearing all will be ſpent in ſmoke,

                     A noyſe domeſtick ſhrill I hear,
                     and I dare ſtay no longer:
                     Good friends adieu till further time,
                     I muſt obey the ſtronger.

                     Maturation is exaltation of a ſubſtance, rude and crude to that which is mature and perfect.
                  
                     Miſtion is ſuch a compoſition of bodies, as inceration, incorporation, colliquation, and contuſion do declare.
                  
                     Mollition is the beginning of liquation, yet ſome things are mollified (as cornu cervi, Corral, Ivory, Ungulae, &c.) which cannot liquate.
                  
                     
                     Multiplication by projection, is of a body amalgamated from 7. to 10. from 10. to 50. from 50. to 100. &c. according to the force and quantity of the tincture.
                  
                     Mundiſication is the purgation of any matter by few or many operations from that which is ſordid and vicious, that onely the moſt excellent may be admitted to the work in hand.
                  
                     Nutrition is the permiſtion of humidity by little and little, for the alteration of the quality of the medicament.
                  
                     Precipitation is when bodies corroded by Aqua fortis, or Aqua Regia, and diſſolved into water, Salt Armoniack or Mercury caſt upon them, either by the abſtraction of the corroding vapour, are reverberated into Calx, they are made perfect medicines.
                  
                     Probation is the examination of any matter, whereby we diſcern what is excellent and perfect, and what corrupt.
                  
                     Projection is an exaltation chiefly in Metals, by a medicine caſt upon them, which will ſuddenly penetrate and transfigurate them, giving them another tincture.
                  
                     Prolectation is extraction by attenuation of ſubtil parts, ſo that by the inclination of their rarified nature, they may be altred from the more groſſe parts.
                  
                     Purgation like to ſeparation, is the clarification of impure liquor, having a thick ſedement and ſpume by decoction.
                  
                     Putrifaction is the reſolution of a mixt body by a natural putritude in calido humido, or fimo equino, &c. whereby it may be made more excellent.
                  
                     Quartation is the ſeparation of Gold and Silver mixt together, by four unequal parts.
                  
                     Quinta eſſentia is an abſolute, pure and well-digeſted medicine drawn from any ſubſtance, either animal, vegetable, or mineral.
                  
                     Raſion is the ſcraping or paring of a thing, either for expurgation of that which is unprofitable, or for eaſier pulverization.
                  
                     Reduction common to many operations doth reſtore a thing changed to his former eſtate and condition.
                  
                     Repurgation is, whereby metals and other ſubſtances are purged from ſuper fluities of another nature, adhering to them.
                  
                     Reſolution (the way to moſt excellent operations of Alchymie, cauſing both elements and coeleſtial eſſences to ſeparate from their elementary compoſition) of things commixt, is when they part one with another.
                  
                     Reſtinction is a gradation, whereby metals or the like, candified by fire, are reſtinguiſhed in liquor of exaltation, and thereby made more noble, by how much a more excellent tincture and gloſſe is ſet upon them.
                  
                     Reverberation is ignition reducing bodies (the fire quick reverberating and reflecting) into a very ſubtil Calk.
                  
                     Section is the cutting of things great into leſſer parts, for the preſent occaſion.
                  
                     Segregation is the ſolution of that which was whole and perfect into parts divided, which flow not together as colliquables diſſolved.
                  
                     Separation is, whereby parts diſtracted are ſeparated every one alike having his ſeveral being in himſelf.
                  
                     
                     Siccation is the drying up of excremental humidity in bodies, before the fire, Sun, in the ſhade, or the like convenient place.
                  
                     Solution, a principal part of Chymical practice, whereby the incorporation of things coagulated, is diſſolved and attenuated.
                  
                     Subduction is an abſtraction of juyces, oyles, and other liquid matters downward by percolation, filteration, and the like.
                  
                     Sublimation is when that which is extracted is driven to the ſublime part of the veſſel, and there ſubſiſteth, or when as between that which is ſublimed, and the dead head an aëry ſpace doth intercede.
                  
                     Subtiliation is diſſolution, ſeparating the ſubtil parts from the groſſe.
                  
                     Stratification, or ſtratum ſuperſtratum well known to Chymiſts, and uſed in cementation, is ſtrewing of corroding powder, or the like, upon plates of metal by courſe.
                  
                     Torrefaction like ſiccation, but more violent, is an operation drying ſpeedily, parching and ſcorching that which is to be dryed before, or over the fire.
                  
                     Tranſmutation is the mutation of a thing in ſubſtance, colour, or quality.
                  
                     Tranſudation is, when in deſcenſory diſtillation, the eſſence provoked, ſweateth through, and is carried guttatim into the receiver.
                  
                     Vitrification is Combuſtion, converting Calk and Cineres into tranſparant glaſſe.
                  
                     Uſtion is a preparation of things for eaſier pulverization, mutation of colour, faculty, &c. by burning them in a crucible, or in the fire.

                     Gentle Reader,
                  
                  
                     I Had intended much more in my love to young men, to have written by way of inſtruction, namely, a Diſpenſatory touching the precedent particulars, with ſomewhat alſo concerning the Cure of the French Diſeaſe, with ſymptomes thereof, namely, the Gonorea, the Bubo venerea, the Hernia Humoralis, &c. But time hath overtaken me, ſo that now I am forced to conclude, having run through the cares of ſixty nine years; old age being an enemy to ſtudy, for my ſight being weakned, my memory much impaired, and my capacity utterly unable to perform ſo hard a task, which will ask both large time, and much ſtudy to fulfil, and other occaſions beſt known to my ſelf, and ſome ſpeciall reaſons elſewhere expreſſed in my precedent and ſubſequent work, to which I refer you, for the further ſatisfaction; I reſt ready to do good ſo long as the Almighty pleaſeth willing to be,
                  
                     Thine in the Lord, J. W.
                  
                  FINIS.
               
            
         
         
            
               
                  
                  
                  VIATICUM, BEING THE PATH-VVAY TO THE Surgeons Cheſt. Containing, Chirurgical Inſtructions for the younger ſort of Surgeons, imployed in the Service of his Majeſtie, or for the COMMON-WEALTH upon any occaſion whatſoever. Intended chiefely for the better curing of Wounds made by GUNSHOT.

                  The PREFACE.
                  
                  
                     LOving Brethren, for as much as in times of war, as well as of peace, men of our calling ſhould be ready Ad omne quare, for the ſervice of their King and Countrey: We and our Countrey have been long happy in a bleſſed peace; and yet even now having rumors of warre, it is not amiſſe to be prepared for the contrary: Wherefore from the wiſe heathen Philoſopher, let us all learn as followeth (Jam tua res agitur, para cum proximus ardet:) Our neighbouring Nations are and have been long in combuſtion; it is therefore wiſedome for us to be ready, and the rather we ought to take it into our better conſideration, becauſe at the firſt compoſing and writing hereof, namely in Iuly, 1626. when as I publiſhed it, there were then, and now are rumours of Warres, and our Company of Barber Surgeons were then commanded by His Majeſties Authoritie forthwith to provide ſixeteen of the beſt Surgeons as the then time afforded for his eſpecial ſervice by Land, ſuch as were men moſt expert in the healing of wounds made with Gunne-ſhot; and generally for the moſt part, by reaſon of that long and happy peace that our Nation had enioyed, many good Surgeons being put to it at the firſt, were likely to have been found ſomewhat to ſeek therein; how much more then our younger men? wherefore the charge of providing, preparing, and fitting His Maieſties whole ſervice by land and ſea, being by his Highneſs referred to our Corporation & our Company, having for that time made choice of my ſelfe, and deputed me to the worke, I held my ſelfe in conſcience and dutie tied to do ſomewhat,

although I confes it was little, to the better enabling and encouraging of younger men unto their duties in that point. But here under favour I muſt deſire pardon for a little digreſſion; namely, that before my entrance unto any further diſcourſe, I acquaint the yonger ſort of Surgeons my Brethren with thoſe eſpecial favours, which it then pleaſed our moſt gracious King Charles, to beſtow upon our Corporation in particular above and beyond his ever bleſſed Anceſtors, for the good of his Souldiers and Sea-men, and our encouragements thereby, to animate and inable us the more heartfully to ſerve him: And namely.
                  Firſt his Highneſs was graciouſly pleaſed, when alſo he increaſed the ſea-mens wages, to augment the monthly wages of each Surgeon and Surgeons Mate in his ſervice by ſea and land, to above a third penny from former cuſtom; namely from nineteen ſhillings four pence a moneth to thirty ſhillings. He hath alſo bin graciouſly pleaſed to give a free benevolence to the Surgeons in all his ſea ſervices, which never was given them by any of the former Kings nor Queens of this land before as followeth, viz. To all Surgions that ſerve in his Highneſs own ſhips, I mean towards the furniſhing of their Surgions Cheſts with Phyſical drugs and medicaments, I ſay for each of them ten pounds; and to each Merchants ſhip five pounds, and to each Newcaſtle-ſhip or Colliarsſhip ſerving in his Highneſs his affairs three pounds. And, nevertheleſs all the Surgions in his Highneſs ſervice have as formerly by the head of all men that are in pay in any of his ſhips or land-ſervice two pence of each man by the moneth: And for the ſurgeons in his Land ſervice, he alloweth to the Surgeon Major of the whole Camp five ſhillings a day; and for his two Mates or ſervants four ſhillings a day. Alſo his Majeſtie alloweth to each Surgion two ſhillings and ſix pence the day, which is three pounds and fifteen ſhillings the moneth, and to each Mate three pound a moneth, and more over allowed, and gave to each Surgeon appointed to 250. men, a ſurgery

Cheſt of 17. pounds valew free of account: And moreover his Majeſtie alloweth to the Surgeon Major a ſtore Cheſt or Magazeen Cheſt of 48. pounds value, for a ſupply to furniſh upon all wants and occaſions: And His Highneſs was yet further well pleaſed to give authority unto the Maſters and Governors of our Society, for to have the making, compounding, fitting, and ordering of all the medicines, as well Phyſicall as Chirurgicall, together with all other proviſions belonging to the Surgeons cheſt. And further His Highneſs hath referred to the ancient Maſters and the Governours of our Society, the preſſing of all Surgeons and Surgeons Mates or ſervants to Surgeons and Barbers; with alſo the taking up of any inſtruments, cheſts, or ready made medicines in His Highneſs name for his ſervice, if occaſion be not otherwiſe. Theſe favours and priviledges our Corporation have received from His Highneſs, together with a new Charter, wherein he hath likewiſe gratiouſly been pleaſed to confirm all our priviledges formerly granted unto us; and hath given us divers new priviledges for the better ſubſiſtance of our ſaid Corporation in future times; as alſo we had never been denied as formerly, to have monies impreſted before hand, for the providing a cheſt with ſurgery Inſtruments and ſalves. In regard whereof, and for that Surgeons ſhould with the better courage be inſtigated faithfully to perform their duties; I have preſumed in this Preface to explain His Highneſs former favors, as aforeſaid, whereby our younger bretheren may from age to age the better keep it in remembrance; and to that end I have alſo further under favor I hope without offence, preſumed to ſet down the effect of the order of the then Lords of his Highneſs moſt honourable Privie Councell, with the day and yeare in which ſome of the recited priviledges were granted and ordered, as alſo in part the form and order how his Maieſties Officers of his Navie have interpreted, diſpenſed, and diſpoſed of his Maieſties ſaid free gift, according to the ſeverall burthens, rankes and orders of the ſhips of His Highneſs his Navy reſpectively, which are as followeth.

                  The Preface.
                  The day of the grants of the aforeſaid order touching benevolences, was to my beſt remembrance the 10 of July, 1626. at White-hall, by the Lords of h

                     s Majeſties Privy Councel, being then by them ordered to be paid unto the Maſters and Wardens of the Surgeons, ever from time to time before hand, and upon all ſervices for his Highneſſe; and for the better performance thereof, the ſaid Noble Lords were pleaſed to pray the Lord Treaſurer to take knowledge thereof, and to cauſe the monies accordingly to be forthwith iſſued as aforeſaid, as for a ſupply for the providing of Phyſical drugs and medicaments. And further the ſaid Honourable Lords were then pleaſed to order, that all ſuch other monies as uſually had been allowed by way of impreſt to any Surgeons in His Majeſties ſervice, towards the providing and further fitting of their Surgery-Cheſts, ſhould together with the former monies be likewiſe paid into the hands of the ſaid Maſters and Wardens, ever for the time being in dew time and before hand; who for the better effecting of the intents and ſervice aforeſaid, were ordered to ſee the ſaid monies faithfully and frugally beſtowed, and ſhould for the ſurer performance of it, orderly have the making, ordering, fitting, and compounding of all the medicines, as well phyſical as chirurgical; as alſo all other proviſions belonging to a Surgeons Cheſt; or to appoint ſuch others for the effecting the work, as they ſhould at their perils anſwer for their faithful performances: All which Cheſts and proviſions whatſoever therein ſo fitted and provided as aforeſaid, being ready, the Maſter and Wardens are by the ſaid order commanded to ſee every of them to be ſafely delivered under lock and key, unto His Majeſties officers whom it may concern at Tower-wharfe; that all things therein provided and incloſed might the ſafelier come on board the ſhips, for which they are deſigned: All which allowances, Injunctions, Priviledges and Commands, were then by the ſaid moſt Honourable Lords thought fit to be for ever hereafter continued to all ſhips or Fleets in his Highneſſe future ſervices, as is more plainly manifeſt by the ſaid order; the which no doubt is extant, and unto which if occaſion require, relation may be had.
                  Thus loving Brethren, having acquainted you with theſe his Majeſties favours unto our Corporation, it followeth in my duty that I ſhould acquaint the younger ſort of Surgeons with the uſe of the Surgeons Cheſt, I mean the medicines in this Viaticum contained; in ſome methodical manner, according to the inſuing expreſſions of the following Treatiſe, were it not that time haſtens me to an end, before I begin: Yet nevertheleſſe I have ſhrained of time to lend the yonger ſort a word or two in this Viaticum, not to al as a Teacher, but as a loving remembrance to the elder, which I pray you to peruſe as you have occaſion. And ſo in Gods name without painting of phraſes or collecting of great Authours for my

                     ouchers; my Method you know by the plainneſſe of the ſtile; the which Method is no other then the old beaten Path-way of all Surgeons, wherein each Artiſt ought to be experienced. And If any Artiſt

by forgetfulneſſe erre, deſire to informe his memorie: And as for the younger ſort, I know it is Charitie to ſhew them, for they have need, and ought to-deſire and ſeeke knowledge, according to an old Doctrine of that ſweet Lillie, in his Grammatical inſtructions, videlicet.
                  
                  
                     Qui dubitat, qui ſaepe rogat, mea dicta tenebit;
                     Is qui nil dubitaet, nil capit inde boni.
                  
                  In Engliſh to this effect.
                  
                     Who doubts, enquires, and knowledge ſeeks, doth Lillies rules make good;
                     Whileſt he that's wiſe in his own conceit, puts on the Idiots hood.
                  
                  And to conclude, I well knowing you could not alwayes have the advice of the grave and learned Artiſts at hand, in militarie affairs, I therefore preſumed to the utmoſt of my latchet, hereby to afford you my following helps, which I hope by the friendly Reader will, if he want better, be taken in friendly part.

                     AFTER extraction of unnatural things, forced into the wound with the Bullet, which ought with all circumſpection, care, and poſſible eaſe to the patient, to be effected for fear of hurting the offended Arteries, veins, and nerves, &c. And alſo all ſuch fractured bones greater or leſſe broken by force of the bullet, be taken out; I ſay of allDraw not fractured bones out at the firſt, without caution. ſuch of them, as may without danger of Life or Limb be immediatly removed for the firſt dreſſing; wherein note, that a fractured bone, though wholy divided from the greater fixed part thereof, is not as by a general rule alwayes to be cut or forced out at the firſt dreſſing, except it doth apparantly endanger a Gangrena, or other feareful accidents, by pricking of Nerves or the like; for by amoving it, a Flux mayTarry if you may while nature helps. be induced, or ſome other offence, but you ſhould do well rather to forbear ſuch bones for the firſt dreſſing at the leaſt, and until nature, or other juſt reaſons in the true Art of healing doe compel, and to proceed to the dreſſing.
                  In the more ſimple ſort of Gun-ſhot wound, as followeth, I mean in wounds, where no Gangrena may be ſuſpected, neither immediate Flux, nor furtive hemorrhage, dreſſe the Patient either with Artificial Balme, or Oleum Hypericon: cum Gummis de Apericij, Oleum Cattulorum,
                     Balm in the Cheſt. or Arceus Linament, or one of theſe, and apply it warme, and ſomwhat

warmer then the Patient would willingly ſuffer it, and cover the wound with an Emp. of mellilot ſtiptic: Paracelſi, Minium, or any other goodEmpl ſitting.

And for one particular, obſerve that in Gun-ſhot wounds, almoſt in all dreſſings, the ſpirit of wine doth well with ſome of the aforeſaid balmes, until the wound be well mundified at the leaſt.

Then at the next dreſſing, if Fluxes, hinder not, have ready,) if it may be (white wine and honey, for a fomentation, or faire water, and Mel for neceſſity, if better cannot be had, and with a little Aqua vitae added, if you thinke fit, with ſtupes, very warme, foment the wounded part a pretty ſpace, then apply until full digeſtion one of the a forenamed Balms, warm, or with the ordinary digeſtive of Terebinth, vitellum ovorum &c. and cover it with an emplaiſter, and embrocate the part about, with Oleum Roſarum Camom.

And if accidents chance not, the Surgeons Method may be to proceed as in all contuſed wounds, onely as is ſaid, I adviſe the Surgeon to make uſe of pure Aqua vitae, or rather ſpirit of Wine, with Aegyptiacum, where he findeth not a juſt cauſe to the contrary.

                     COnceale from the Patient the great danger of the wound, except juſt cauſe urge thee to acquaint him with it.
                  
                     Fomentation. Fomentations are very good medicines in wounds with Gun-ſhot, but foment not at any time, except you can have convenient fire at hand, and let ever your Fomentations be very warme applyed.
                  Foment not too long at any one time, neither uſe it but upon urgent occaſions.
                  Embrocate often, if no Gangrena be at hand, whether you have fire or not. Embrocation.
                  
                  Let all your Vehicles for your Medicines, as tents, dorſels, plegents, &c. be ſoft and pleaſing to your Patients, as much as in true Art may be, and cram not the wound too full at any time, eſpecially Wounds inciſed for hindring unition of parts.
                  Alſo, if you can conveniently come to the work, inlarge not, eſpeciallyInlarging of Wounds. in contuſed wounds, where danger may be feared, otherwiſe doe it warily; obſerving that you doe it not to thwart any member, neither any Veine, Artery, Nerve or Muſcle, as neare as you can poſſible.
                  
                     Gun-ſhot wounds over compound. No wound of Gun-ſhot can be ſaid to be a ſimple wound, neither ever was there any Artiſt, that could truely ſay, that he healed any gun-ſhot wound by the firſt intention of Vnition, without due ſuppuration, no nor any contuſed wound whatſoever; for the compoſition of Gun-ſhot wounds, are ever real and very ſubſtantial; witneſſe the poore patient, where Fibres, Nerves, Membranes, Veines, Arteries, Bones, & quid non, ſuffer together ſo, that ſuch wounds, in their recency they reſemble Vlcers rather then wounds; and the differences of theſe from other contuſed wounds is, That other contuſedDifference of contuſed wounds. Wounds for the moſt part ſuffer but by way of contuſion onely, and theſe by contuſion and dilaceration, if not fraction of bones &c. whereby all the whole member ſuffereth together, and alſo the parts adjacent, and that in a high degree.
                  If diſcolouring bliſtering or other apparent ſhewes of a Gangrena appeare, give the patient a Diaphoreticke cordial, then ſcarify gently at the firſt, and deeply afterwards as cauſe ſhall urge, and have ready a Lixivium made of water and aſhes, to the height of an ordinary Lee that women uſe to drive bucks with, and put a reaſonable quantity of common Salt into it, and when it is cleared, if you have hearbs, as

                     Scordium, wormewood, Centaury, Hypericon, Camomil, Melilot, or the like or Lupnies, make uſe of them according to Art, it will be much the better, if not, uſe it without, and apply it very warme, with ſtupes, often ſhifted, and wrung out, and if that cannot be had, uſe ſalt water for a fomentation very warm, rather then want a medicine: Aqua vitae is alſo precious in all Lixiviums againſt Gangrens, but you muſt boyle the Aqua vitae without errour, for the ſpirits will evaporate and the vertue reſteth in them.
                  Obſerve in great lacerated wounds, as followeth, viz. If you find by the wound, the one halfe of the member to be taken away, there is no hope to ſave on the reſt, but you are rather to make preſent Amputation,Iuſt cauſe of amputation. eſpecially if the patient upon information of his danger be willing, for that the reſt is contuſed, and muſt therefore admit by conſequent, ſome loſſe of ſubſtance, by ſuppuration ever in a contuſed wound, and then the remaining part can doe no ſervice to the body but will much indanger the life of the patient, by the expence of blood and ſpirits in the ſtriving to ſave it, and be but a hindrance: and I dare ſay, that if but halfe any member be taken away, with the fracture of the bone, it is impoſſible to ſave the reſt of it on, to do any ſervice▪ If you have haemorrage, I mean bleeding, or furtive bleeding, or weeping of veines or arteries, in your worke, ſearch for the vein or artery that bleedeth or gleeteth; and try if you can make ligature on it, if you cannot, make ligature, which ſeldome or never you can in Gunſhot wounds, then apply to the end of the veine that weepeth an actual cautery, a ſmall one will ſerve, but apply it like it ſelfe very hot, and apply it not all over the wound, onely to that veine, if you can, that bleedeth, you may if the flux be not great, uſe burning hot Egyptiacum, upon a button of lint dipt, and quickly and neatly brought to the place, whilſt it is hot, and then well boulſtred.
                  
                     Actual Cautery. But a ſmall actual cautery is the ſafer, and maketh better worke, or the Surgeon may uſe reſtrictive powder, adding thereto burnt VitriolReſtrictive Powder. a little or burnt allum, and precipitate mixed which maketh a ſtrong eſkar, and often reſtraineth a great Flux, being applied thereon artificially, onely precipitate will ſurely make bones ſoul in contuſed wounds, for which cauſe I affect it not.
                  
                     To take heed of an old error. But ever take heed to avoid the old received error of unwiſe practitioners, whoſe uſe is to cram the wounds, be they inciſed wounds or contuſed wounds, as is ſaid, ful of bole or reſtringent powder, or ſome other ſtuffe, and then thruſt in pledgents or dorſels into each corner of the wound, yea ſometimes forgetting to take all out at the next dreſſing, yet think they have done all workman like, and very artificially not conſidering the harm, that often enſueth thereby. I dare ſay, that in contuſed wounds of Gunſhot, by ſuch errors, they force and draw a Gangrena, if not death thereby, by hindering natural unition, by obſtructing the parts, and grieving the patient, in keeping the woundded parts from healing. It is a ſafe and fair way at the firſt dreſſing, ever to ſtrive to joyn together the parts of all recent wounds, and unite the wounded parts if it may be with this caution, to order that fit

breathing be left to evacuate the peccant humours, whereof there is ſmall feare in lacerated wounds, and then to apply apt and fitting aſtringent medicaments outwardly over all, together with apt and due ligature; and by that courſe to ſtay a fluxe, but in contuſed and lacerated wounds of Gunſhot, the Surgion hath not that benefit, but muſt truſt to other helps not ſo ready, namely, as is ſaid in the leſſer wounds, to very warme Balmes, aſtringent defenſatives, and good ligature, and in greater wounds, to cauſtick medicaments, Cauteries and forcible helps to repel fluxes, &c.
                  But in the Surgeon his careful deſire to reſtraine fluxes, let him everA Caveat. beware of over hard ligature, as much as is poſſible, which is alſo a common dangerous error, and certainely draweth on evill accidents, as Plegmon Gangrena, &c. as daily experience telleth.
                  Likewiſe one the other ſide, over-ſlack binding is alſo bad, due, comly and ſmooth ligature, with the due compoſing the parts wounded with ſoft and ſmooth boulſtring, greatly honoreth the Artiſt and cureth the patient almoſt as much as the medicines doe.
                  Obſerve alſo, that you put never one Cauſtick or Eſcarotick medicine after another too ſoone, namely, not until the firſt eskarre hath beene gone at the leaſt three daies. If in a contuſed wound of Gunſhot any ſlough or putrid part, as proceeding from the heads of the muſkets, arteries, veines, or the like, appeare in a contuſed wound which needeth an Eſcaroticke medicine, and the Surgeon doe deſire to cleanſe that part, let him uſe an artificial Cauſtick medicine, namely, hot Egyptiacum, or an actual Cautery, if you can apply it onely in that place, and not all over the wound, for in truth the uſe of them is very good in contuſed wounds made by Gunſhot; and yetOver drying medicines dangerous. you are to conſider, that as too much gleeting, weeping or experience of humidity from wounds of gunſhot is dangerous many wayes, ſo too much uſe of drying medicaments in wounds made with Gunſhot, is no leſſe dangerous by ſtopping the pores and repelling the peccant humours, by reaſon of the contuſed blood collected, being choaked in the wound, aptly indangering a Gangrena, and other deadly accidents incident thereunto.
                  
                     Adviſe touching the general regiment of wounded men. Now a word or two in want of the grave Phyſician, how the young Surgion may in part demean himſelfe being put to it, for the more happy performance of the cures made with Gunſhot, which are very much regulated by the government of the Patient, touching his dyet, as alſo in the careful keeping his body in temper from muchDyet. coſtiveneſſe, and alſo to ſtay in ordinate fluxes, thereby to prevent accidents, as Feavers, &c.

the Surgeons cheſt affordeth viz. If the patient before his wound had not a looſe body, let the Surgeon give him a Suppoſitory or Glyſter, and if he ſeem diſpoſed to a fever, though he hath bled by his wound, yet if his ſtrength be anſwerable, open a veine on the contrary ſide ofSuppoſi

Barly-water, viz.

                  I conceive it will be needleſſe to urge a courſe for a ſparing dyet for Souldiers, or Sea-men at Sea, for I feare gluttony will not be their ſinne. But if fulneſſe of body be a hindrance, the Surgeon hath meanes to evacuate, as for a vomit by Stibium, the infuſion of 4 graines, if ſuch a medicine be thought fitting, as in able bodyes may be borne, or by laxatives, as Confectio Hamech, ſix drams for a doſe, Diaphenicon or Diacatholicon, the doſe to an able body is a full ounce.Pills.

                  Likewiſe in fluxes of the belly, accompanied with crude nauſeouſneſſe of the ſtomach, as alſo againſt venemous or peſtilential infection of the blood, there is in the cheſt Phylonium Perſicum, of which the Patient may take from one ſcruple to halfe a dram, and to one dram ſafely in a reaſonable body, and this is a ſafe medicine, which cauſeth reſt and corroborateth the ſtomach, and mightily prevaileth to ſtay a flux of the belly, and doth alſo correct venemous and maligne humors, and is therefore very fit to be uſed in fluxes that be contagious or peſtilential, after ſome fitting evacuation if occaſion be. What I here write, it is of mine owne practice, you may take it on my word for truth, for you ſhall find it to be ſo, if with due caution you make uſe of them.

                  And to waſh and cool the mouth in feavers, I often take fair water, foure ounces, of Roſe water halfe a ſpoonefull, a little ſirrup of Violets, or Mel for a need, and a few drops of Wine Vinegar, or Oximel, or Oyle of Vitriol a few drops onely to make the Medicine tart, I mean the Lotion. I have bin taxed that my proportion hath not ſufficient medicines contained therein for wounds of Gunſhot, but if any pleaſe to look into the particulars, and well conſider them, he will find that the whole ſcope of the Surgeons Cheſt, is of purpoſe contrived to that end, and that there is not any one Medicine therein,A true Ideſcription of a wound with Gun ſhot at the firſt view. but upon the main, or upon the by, tendeth that way: for a wound of Gunſhot at the firſt view repreſenteth a wound, an ulcer, a Fiſtula, yea and ſometimes a fracture, and a diſlocation, and by accidents calleth unto it a feaver, an Apoſtume, a Gangren, & quid non, yea without Gods Mercy joyned, and the great care of the diſcreet Surgeon, death followeth. Judge then if ought be in the Surgeons Cheſt, which in ſuch a wound upon ſome occaſion may not be found uſeful.
                  And for an inſtance, the Cheſt containeth for the firſt intention curative of burnings with Gun-powder, Vng. populeon, Album triapharm

Vpon the 24 of Iuly 1628, I tooke off two members, being both legs, whereof one above the knee, with one ounce and a half of the powder to both, and had a fourth part

                  And if all what is ſaid, with alſo the help of Phlebotomy, ligature, actual and potential cauteries, will not ſuffice, then I am I confeſſe miſtaken.
                  
                     Common practice. Note in burnings with Gun-powder, that if the face or hand be burned, I have found it beſt from the firſt to the laſt, namely, to the end of the cure, to uſe Vng. Album, either mixed with Populeon, or withA note in the cure of burnings in the face. Linſeed Oyle, or Vng. Diapomphol. is fully as good made into a very thin linament, and warme, laid on the face with a feather and no clouts at all, nor ought elſe to cover the face, this healeth excoriation s or ſcorchings beſt▪ or that the Surgeon take Ceruſe, grown'd in a mortar, with linſeed oyle, and apply it as the former, I have approved it to be very good. Tripharmac. is alſo very good ſo uſed.
                  I ſpeak but now of honey for burnings, and who ſhall prove it ſhall find it ſafe to take out the fire, and after to heale the grief, but is ſomwhat more paineful then ſome other medicines are, it is onely once a day to be applied upon brown paper, the paper being firſt rubbed ſoft, and the Medicine ſpread thereon, and in that manner applyed, it healeth without any ſcarre very quickly. Alſo Mel Saponis and all other medicines appropriate may be applyed upon paper at Sea, partly for ſparing Linnen.
                  
                     Of the knowledg of weights and meaſures. Moreover, I find a great weakneſſe in younger Surgeons, that I have juſt occaſion to queſtion, in that their Maſters that bred them have not taught them thetrue knowledge of our uſual weights and meaſures, but chiefly they fail in their weights, which doth bring great danger to their poor patients, whoſe lives hang dangerouſly in the balance by a grain too much given, where the Surgeon knoweth not how many graines are in a ſcruple, or in a dram, no nor ſcarce, that there is a weight ſo called: wherefore young Surgeons note as followeth. The Phyſitians, Surgeons, and Apothecaries, have two ſorts of weights in uſe, namely Troy-weights, which likewiſe are the Gold-ſmiths weights, and that containeth twelve ounces to the pound, and Haber-de pois weights, which containeth 16 ounces to the pound, and is that common weight which the Grocers and all other tradeſ-men uſe, and indeed which we moſt uſe, for though my ſelfe ſometimes buy Muſks, Civet, or Amber-greece, and other forts of Drugs, by Troy-weight, yet I diſpence and adminiſter all by Haber-de pois, which is 16 ounces to the pound▪ ſo much I will onely for brevity ſake ſpeak thereof.
                  A pound of Haber-de pois weight hath 16 ounces, an ounce hath 8 Drams, a Dram hath three ſcruples, a ſcruple hath twenty graines, and by that accompt a dram hath two graines, and a full grain of Barley is a reaſonable Grain, and a pepper Corn or wheat Corn may be uſed.
                  And our meaſures agreeing with our weights moſt uſual are as followeth, a wine Gallon of water containeth 8 pound, a pottle 4 pound, a quart 2 pound, a pint 1 pound, and of ordinary ſallet oyles, 7 pound and a half is accounted a Gallon.

                  OF all other neceſſaries in the Surgeons Cheſt, I confeſſe my deficiencie there in; for I ought to have had dryed hearbes of all ſorts fitting, ſome ſtore: but I pray you accept of my excuſe. For at the Edition of this Ex temp
                           •
                        re, I had Surgeons Cheſts and parts of Cheſts, 60 at once to prepare, and had but ten dayes reſpit admitted me to make and to fit them all; and yet notwithſtanding, the ſaid Cheſts contained herbs of divers ſorts, as alſo Bean and Barly-meal, Linſeed, Fenugreeke, Camomile flowers, Cuminſeed, Fennel ſeed, and divers other things, that are helps that way. But what ſhall I ſay? To ſome fooliſh, contentious, vain-glorious perſons, my beſt things fall too ſhort for them; but to benevolent underſtanding Artiſts, they can make and find many wayes and helps of fitting things in a Ship, and not alwayes charge the Surgeons Cheſt. Viz. If my ſelfe were at Sea, and put to it, I would find waſt crums of Biſket, and I would boyle them in Ship-Beer, and with ſome fat of the Beefe Kettles, or of the Porke Kettle, I would make up a ſuppurative, Cataplaſme; and if it had not a fit conſiſtence or body, I would deale with the ſteward for a little Meale, or take ſome of my owne ſtores, and according to my ſtore, enrich that with other helps from the Cheſt: And if I need a diſcutient Cataplaſme, and the Cheſt had not to help me to my will, being put to it, I would, as I ſaid, make my ground of the Medicine to be of crums of Biſket, or of ſoft bread decocted in Beer; adding, when it had well ſod, Vineger and honey, a fit quantity: theſe things, with other rationall additions, according to ſeveral occaſions, doe much comfort the weak patient, and alſo grace the Artiſt: Nam fruſtra fit per plura quod fieri poteſt per pauciora.
                  
                  And to put young Surgeons in mind, what other Suppurative Medicines are in the Surgeons Cheſt, there are either Unguents, Oyles, or Emplaſtick Medicaments divers, which my time will not admit me to informe you of, though I confeſſe I ſhould adviſe young men in their neceſſities. But to be ſhort, they ſhall find Vnguent Baſilicon ſpread thick and applyed to an Apoſtume, doth well help to ſuppurate; and the better, if the griefe were firſt embrocated with ſome Oleum Lili

                        rum, Lini, or the like: and you ſhall find, that Arceus Linament is right good to ſuppurate a tumor, and likewiſe Empl. Meliloti: and who knoweth not, that Ship-pitch and a little fat mixed ripeneth a tumor, duly applyed; or Pix Graeca, with fat or turpentine; and divers other the like good things may be found, where the diſcreet Surgeon is put to his ſhifts. But no more of that; for whereas Bees may ſuck Honey, even there Spiders will convert a plain ſtile into Poyſon and Gall.

                     Take a new earthen pot of almoſt a Gallon and a half, put the water into the pot, and thereunto put the Allom and the Copperas, then powder the tartar, and put that in alſo, and then have ready the other ingrediences in powder, put them in by little and little, ſtirring them very well, until all be incorporated, and without ſeething keepe the Medicine on the fire till it be hard, and if you cannot make it hard enough in that manner ſo that being cold, it will powder, then put it into ſome dreppin Pan, or the like, and into an oven, when the bread is drawn, and it will be hard, then being cold powder it and keep it to your uſe, for it will not decay, nor alter his Vertue in many years.
                     And when you would uſe it for a defenſative, take of this powder, about halfe an ounce of Poſca, I meane water and Vinegar mixed, foure ounces, put the powder therein which will almoſt melt, then dip clouts therein, and apply them. This medicine with moderation uſed, is a true and excellent defenſative, and a very anodine.
                     Alſo it healeth all itchings, ſmartings, gaulings, or any Eriſipelas or other excoriations ſpeedily and ſafely, and dryeth it mightily, preventeth from accidents, either in great wounds, or fractures and being in ſmall quantity uſed with faire water to ulcers, it cleanſeth them well and healeth them.
                     And if you have whites of egges, mixed with a Poſca, it▪ were the better, or in fractures with yolkes and whites together it is very good, onely let the care of the Surgeon be, that he apply it in his true nature, namely as a defenſative in fit time and touching the reſt of the uſes thereof, he may preſume he hath a very good Medicine, and ſo for this time I take my leave.

                  A Deſcription of the Trafine, and the neceſſary uſes thereof, eſpecially for Military occaſions for young Surgeons.
                  
                     HAving had ſufficient tryals of the facility and of the Trafine, I have thought fit to commend it and the uſe thereof, for the future, to the younger Artiſt, upon ſome of their requeſts, not detracting ought from the worthineſſe, and due commendations of the Author of the Trapan, concerning that excellent invention, yet by way of addition to my former Edition, I thought fit here to deſcribe the Trafine, it being an Inſtrument of my own compoſing, which experience will ſhew, is more compendious, and of more facility in the uſe thereof, for young practicioners in Surgery then is the Trapan, the which Inſtrument, although it may be ſaid to be derivative or Epitomy of or from the Trapan; yet well obſerved, it performeth as much as the Trapan in every degree and more, and for that it was ſo faſhioned, and firſt practiſed by my ſelfe, I thought fit to put the name of a Trafine upon it (a tribus finibus) from the three ends thereof, each being of ſeveral uſes, and being as it may appeare triangular or three cornered, each corner there of performing the part it ſeemeth to undertake, ſo that it fully ſupplyeth and maketh good all the uſes of a Trapan, with the one end, and that with more facility as is ſaid, and ſafely then the Trapan doth, or can doe, and it ſupplyeth with the ſecond end all the uſes of a ſmooth Levatory, and ſupplyeth the neceſſity of a Jagged or toothed Levatory, with the third end, the ſaid Levatories being all neceſſary adjutors in helping to make and finiſh the Trafine or (tres finis (and who ſo ſhall pleaſe to make a judicial experience thereof, not being prejudicated, will find that it far exceedeth the Trapan in all his uſes; in the compendious and ſafe performance of the workes, as well of the two Levatories, as of a Trapan recited which the former can no way be ſaid to be.
                  Secondly, the Trapan cannot be well managed without both the hands of the Artiſt viz. the one for the work of eroſion by the Artificial motion thereof in turning it ever round for the better penetrating of the Cranium, the other hand muſt be uſed to keep it ſteddy upon the affected part, and yet the upper part of the Inſtrument, muſt nevertheleſſe, as of neceſſity reſt upon the Surgeons breſt, yea and the Surgeon muſt for that purpoſe order his body in a fit poſture; and further yet, the Surgeon muſt have a ſecond man for an aſſiſtant of neceſſity, that muſt be imployed to ſtay the Patients head, whereas

with this Inſtrument (I meane the Trafine) the whole worke is performed by the two hands of the Surgeon onely, with farre more dexterity and quicker, then with the Trapan as is ſaid, yea, and that with much more comfort, both to the patient and to the Artiſt, as the practice therewith will plainely ſhew: and againe, there is no ſuch danger attending that Inſtrumentas doth the Trapan; for the heads of the Trafine are made all taper, to wit, wider above then beneath, and alſo cut both wayes, and cannot therefore eaſily be ſaid to offend the (Dura Mater) by an error to be ſuggeſted, to happen in the uſe thereof, without ſtupid ignorance in the Artiſt.
                  Thirdly, the Trapan of old had ever the heads as wide above as beneath, which heads were many wayes both very dangerous and uncertaine, eſpecially when the Inſtrument by turning round, had cleane pierced through the Cranium, and thereby after the ſame head had fully perforated the Cranium round, it was very apt on the ſuddaine to ſlip downe upon the (Dura Mater) by error and improvidence of the Artiſt, either upon oblivion or omiſſion divers wayes, as namely for one, if the Artiſt did not truly, equally, and ſtrongly faſten the ſmall ſcrew, being an iron or rather a ſteele pin, that ſtayeth and faſteneth the ſaid head of the Trapan, which the Artiſt pierceth with for the gaging thereof, either by haſt, which though otherwiſe he might adjudged a careful Surgeon, yet upon his eager proceeding on his work, might unhappily be omitted, and even that ſmall error might cauſe danger to the life of the Patient, and ſometimes proved the irrecoverable cauſe of his death; whereas this Inſtrument, the Trafine, hath all the heads thereof made taper, as is ſaid, namely wider above then below, piercing every way alike, and therefore there needeth no rule or gager, eſpecially in the being performed without turning it round about, but is done by the onely moving or agitating of the hand to and fro, yea with the onely moving of the wriſt of the hand, and which is another manifeſt benefit thereof, it can goe no lower then it is, by agitating and extreame preſſing urged, and when it hath penetrated through it, for the moſt part detaineth and bringeth forth the peece of the bone with it, and putteth the Patient to no paine nor danger thereby, no nor colour of danger or paine at all.
                  Fourthly, by reaſon that the Traſines taper heads are made and framed, to cut every way alike, as is ſaid, the work is eaſier and ſooner performed therewith, then with the Trapan, as by the proving it upon a Calves head you eaſily ſhall make the experience, provided as is fitting in the time of piercing, you ſometimes take out the Inſtrument, and wipe the teeth thereof that it furre not too much, and thereby hinder the due penetration: alſo thereby you eaſily may conſider how farre you have penetrated, and what remaineth unpierced, that you may doe what is juſt in the work of penetration and no more.
                  Yet I will never deny, but doe acknowledge that the Trapan hath deſerved great praiſes from former ages, for that it hath been an Inſtrument

that hath preſerved many a man, woman and childs life, from the eminent danger of death, and whereby they have bin reſtored to good and perfect health againe, and if that any by omiſſion or error in the uſe thereof have dyed, they are at reſt by it; and if the younger Artiſt doe by his experience, find that this my addition deſerve ought, let God have the prayſe in his mercies to weak men, for the comfort they find thereby in their wofull diſtreſſes, and as for this my Addition of invention, I muſt confeſſe is not much, onely good will, for all men may well conceive, that it is more eaſy to add to another mans invention, then to invent a new thing of his owne.
                  The next obſervation conſiderable in the fitting of the Trafine duely to the work is, for the regulating the center or point of this orbe or circumference, I meane of this Trafine head, it is firſt to be well conſidered, that the pin thereunto belonging being placed truly in the center be artificially made of good ſteel, and that it be triangular, alſo that it be ſharp each way well pointed, and ſtand faſt in the Inſtrument, and alſo that it ſtand no lower, but alwayes ſomewhat higher then the circumferent teeth of the head of that Inſtrument doe, for becauſe the ſaid pinne in the center guideth the circumferent tooth-head-ſaw, to the beginning of the work, and in the agitating and moving of the Trafine with the hand to and fro in this work, the ſaid pin may firſt take hold, ere the teeth of the Inſtrument touch the ſcull, for that the ſaid pin is not onely appointed as a rule and guide, but alſo as the ſtay to the work, which done, namely, when the tooth head orbe or ſaw, hath taken hold round, then the ſooner the better the Artiſt is to take up the Inſtrument, to wipe and cleanſe the teeth thereof, and draw out the ſaid pin in the center, the which he may no wayes omit; which done he is by the agitation of his hand onely to and fro to pierce, and having pierced as it were halfe through, he is againe to take up his Inſtrument and cleanſe it, and then againe to proceed in piercing by the motion of the hand to and fro, until he have in all parts gone through the Cranium, which if he diligently regard in the tender obſervant motion of his owne hands, I mean he that pierceth ſhall ſenſibly feel when the bone is penetrated through on each part, which conſidered, then drawing off his Inſtrument, he ſhall find the peece of the Cranium ſo removed, fixed within the head of his Inſtrument as is ſaid.
                  But note nevertheleſſe, there is great care to be taken by the Artiſt in the manner of the piercing and taking out the peece of the fractured bone divers wayes.
                  And firſt let him be ſure, ever to place the broding head of the Inſtrument that pierceth, ſo that the triangular pin in the center thereof be ſet upon a firme part of the Cranium or ſcull, yet alwayes provided it be near the fractured part thereof as may be.
                  Secondly the Artiſt is to conſider, that as he which pierceth the Cranium with a ſmall ſtreight head, ſuch as the Trapans were accuſtomed to have as is ſaid by the giving way of the ſmall ſcrew that faſtneth

the head of the Trapan, the Patients life may be indangered, namely if the Cranium being throwly pierced, the Inſtrument caſually ſhould ſlip down upon the (Dura Mater,) as my ſelfe to my grief once ſaw: even in like manner he that uſeth a ragged taperhead of a Trafine, how ſafe ſoever, may be guilty of indangering his Patient, if he be not careful in the manner of his piercing, namely, that after the Inſtrument hath taken hold round with the teeth, if he either leave the pin untaken out, the ſaid pin being longer then the teeth of the Inſtrument, he may wound the Panicle (Dura Mater) before the peice intended to be taken out, be pierced through in each part, or that he do not at the leaſt twice or thrice in the time of his piercing the Cranium, take up and cleanſe the teeth of the Inſtrument with a clout thereby as it were to miſtruſt himſelf, as fearing whether it have in all parts pierced through or not, or how much, or in which part he is wanting for feare of going too deep, otherwiſe he may kill his patient ere he doth find or perceive he is through, for a work ſo ſeldome uſed, and the errors thereof being of ſo dangerous a conſequent, the Artiſt, although otherwiſe diſcreet, by omiſſion, oblivion, or other improvidence be wanting in ſome obſervation, highly worthy of regard; wherefore it behoveth him to ſuſpect himſelfe and be cautious, for that a man can never be too wary in ſuch a buſineſſe; for although the piece every way may be pierced and removed out of his place, yea, and contained within the Trafine head, yea, and ſtick in the fame, yet the Artiſt may by his hand be miſtaken, and think it not to be through, for that the Inſtrument ſticketh as firmely, and as faſt in the place, when the piece is out and within the Orbe of the Trafine, as it did ere it was divided, and as if it had not gone through: hereby if the Artiſt obſerve not his intermiſſions, by forbearing now and then his piercing, as is ſaid, and ſometimes view his worke, and cleanſe the teeth of the Inſtrument ere it be through, he is ſubject to goe too deep, and wound the (D
                           •••
                         Mater) by the continued motion of his hand, notwithſtanding the piece of the Cranium is compleatly removed, and reſ
                        •
                     eth within the head of the ſaid Inſtrument: wherefore all theſe obſervations, as I conceive, under favor, are but neceſſary for the young Artiſt to have in regard, Nam nimis cautla non nocet: To be exceeding wary is not hurtful.
                  And further, let the Artiſt be ſure that his Trafine be truly made of good ſteele, I meane the head of the pin or center, and the ends of the levatories, and that the pin ſtand faſt on, and directly in the middeſt of the head thereof, namely in the true center of the Inſtrument, and alſo that the Artiſt have three heads of ſeveral ſizes in readineſſe by him is likewiſe very fitting, with alſo an Inſtrument called a Lenticular at hand, to cleanſe away all ſmall ſhivers and raſpings of bones, juſtly proceeding in the operation of exciſion, as alſo for the removing whatſoever elſe may ſeeme by conſequence to offend the Dura Mater, or that way elſe might hinder healing.
                  
                     
And further, I adviſe that every young Artiſt take ſome convenient time before hand, to make tryal of his Trafine, as is ſaid, upon a Calveshead, or the like ſubject, before he put it in practice upon a man, for a good Surgeon may erre, even in a ſmall omiſſion in ſuch a buſineſſe to his grief and reproach, if he be not exceeding cautious; and for that cauſe I adviſe every young Surgeon (as is ſaid) to ſuſpect himſelf, and warily to conſider that the precious life of man ſo dependeth upon the care, wiſdome, and artificial skill of the Surgeon in his work, as that upon a ſmall omiſſion or errour of forgetfulneſſe, or but a very little miſtake, a man is in a moment ſlain by art, for want of art, when it will be too late for the Artiſt within himſelf, to ruminate of the things that moſt conduced to the miſchief; and upon all occaſions, or omiſſions whatſoever befalling the Artiſt, let him ever be fearful and careful of entring too deep, for fear of wounding, or but ſcratching of the (Dura Mater) for thoſe tranſgreſſions often produce fearfull accidents and deadly.
                  Again, as in ſpeaking elſe-where of the uſe of the Trapan I have mentioned, let every Artiſt be very well adviſed and fully reſolved of the juſt neceſſity of the uſe of the Trapan, and ſo of this Inſtrument, before he attempt to uſe it, and not lightly upon ſuggeſtions, or for vain oſtentation ſake, nor above all, for baſe lucres ſake, to put his patient upon the uſe of either of them, for that it is apparent, many great concuſſions, depreſſions, yea and ſome fractures are cured without any ſuch Inſtrument; I have ſometimes alſo obſerved, that young Surgeons upon a raſhneſſe of their opinion, and now and then, for fooliſh vain glory and oſtentation ſake, have been overforward in that point, of putting themſelves upon the work of piercing the Cranium, not attending the true time of nature, and by waiting to ſee what ſhe can or will perform of her ſelf, as in truth he ought to do, for that the Surgeon being natures hand-maid, not her guide, ought judiciouſly to attend her Criſis, and to procced by the adviſes of ancient grave Artiſts, that are experienced Surgeons in thoſe works; for ſometimes there are dangerous ſymptomes that ceaſe, without the uſe of the Trapan or Trafine, by making of a wound, or by the onely competent enlarging of the wound, in which work it is good to be very ſure in the making inciſion upon the head, that he do well divide the Pericranium ſo far as he intends to ſet his Trafine, at the leaſt whereſoever there is cauſe of enlarging or inciſing any would of the head for the Trafine, or otherwiſe for the onely dividing that Membrane, is in many caſes ſufficient, and ſerveth inſtead of the intended work of piercing the Cranium: and further touching inciſion obſerve, that as too ſmall inciſion is not good, that the Surgeon ever have regard to preſerve the beauty of nature as much as may be; as ſuppoſe it were in any part of the face, to make too large an inciſion there, eſpecially when it falleth out to be near the temporal muſcles, or on the forehead.
                  Now a word or two more, and an end of that buſineſſe, concerning the Trafine, and I will conclude, there is yet a neceſſary Inſtrument, which of a kind of neceſſity, ought to be at hand whenſoever the Trafine is put to work, for that there may be unexpectedly uſe of it, and it is as formerly

named a Lenticular, or a cleanſer, which immediately after the eroding part of the Trafine, hath performed his fitting office and is removed: this Lenticular or ſmoother, being a little warmed, is to be put into the wound, where the eroding part ſtood, and with a gentle ſenſible hand to be paſſed to and fro upon that moſt tender panicle, I mean the (Dura Mater) thereby to bring away any ſmall eroſions, ſcrapings, duſt, ſpills of bones, or what elſe ſoever might be imagined, could give offence to that moſt ſenſible and noble Panicle.
                  This, with the premiſes well had in regard, I leave the young Artiſt to Gods bleſſing, and conclude this Chapter with a loving admonition to the younger ſort of my brethren, for their imitations; that like as our bleſſed Saviour ſaid to his Diſciples, in his ſpiritual Diſcipline to them, when he ſent them forth into the world, to preach the glad tydings of ſalvation, he admoniſhed them, and no doubt infuſed power ſufficient into them, to be wiſe as Serpents, and innocent or harmleſſe as Doves, and withal, willed them to beware of men; and even the like premonition do I give to my Brechren of the younger ſort, concerning the great ttuſt of the precious lives and limbs of men, referred to their skill, truſt, and care, and namely, that they with the utmoſt that in them is, and even as they would anſwer it before their living God, who ſeeth not as men ſee, that with innocent hearts, they without any ſiniſter ends, truly and faithfully perform their charge, in healing thoſe whom they take into cure, and charge, and that in the obedience, and in the fear of God, their innocence may appear before God, and be witneſſed by their Works.

                  THE PREFACE.
                  
                     Courteous Reader,
                  
                  
                     Such is Gods manifest miraculous hand in his various and unſearchable wayes of afflicting Mankind in that moſt noyſome diſeaſe of the Peſtilence, that it is not onely wonderful, but alſo impoſsible for the wit of any man, how wiſe or learned ſoever he may esteem himſelf, or by others be eſteemed, to give a ſufficient reaſon, with alſo a general and methodical Cure for that moſt contagious, noyſome, and killing diſeaſe of the Peſtilence, for that it is apparent it paſſeth mans wit to comprehend or to avoid the moſt ſubtile invaſions and aſſaults thereof, as having in it (aliquid divinum) to be conſidered of, it being one of the three great and terrible Arrowes of the Almighty, whereby according to his Divine Will he hath uſually cut off ſinners from off the Earth almoſt in all Ages, and in all Nations, as we may gather, and is at large read in holy Scriptures, and in the Writings of good men, and daily experience declares no leſſe; all which, for brevity, I will omit here to repeat.
                  And his moſt uſual great and fearful Arrowes declared, are Wars, Famine, and Peftilence; and the moſt merciful of theſe three, which the Prophet David choſe, was the Peſtilence: which, although his mighty, fearful, and terrible hand be in it; yet for as much as his mercy is exceeding great, yea, over all his works, and that he hath not forbidden, but given us leave, with underſtanding, and ſome judgment, to make uſe of all lawful means to preſerve our frail bodies in health by all our best endeavour, ſo long as we truſt chiefly on his mercy, in the uſe of the means.
                  In regard whereof, I weighing with my ſelf how juſt and needful a thing it is at all times, but chiefly in contagious times, for all men, eſpecially for men of my calling, to ſhew their endavours for the help not onely of themſelves, but alſo of their Chriſtian Brethren, as well by directions as by preſervative and curative Medicines; I eſteemed it not amiſſe, by this following weak Treatiſe, to ſhew forth the fruits of my many years experience, touching the general knowledge of this diſeaſe, as alſo the beſt means I had experienced both for the preventing and curing of the ſame, when and where occaſion may be offered, either Domeſtick, Marine, or Military. And firſt, as by the way, take it into your conſideration, that this diſeaſe holdeth not one certain rule, figure, nor order in ſeizing on mans body, no, nor in one and the ſame houſe or family; neither are men generally taken ſick alike, no, nor directly, as in other times of the Plague they have been, but each time of Contagion hath different aſſaults, and difference in the ſymptomes. For in Anno 1625. we had many ſignes contrary to the Plagues in other times; yea, and many did dye daily, without any ſigns or marks on their bodies at all: and alſo ſometimes, as is too manifeſt, the Plague beginneth in

Winter, and that as well with us as with our neighbour Nations, as namely, Germany, France, the Low-Countries, and other parts of the world it hath done: whereas for the moſt part, heretofore the Plague with us hath begun in Summer, and was commonly moſt fierce, predominate, and untractable to Medicines in the heat of Summer, and chiefly in Harveſt, which is the unſeaſonable time that we do uſually call the Canicular or Dog-dayes.
                  But the ſickneſſe of the yea
                        •
                     , 1636. held not that rule, but encreaſed in ſome Townes in Winter: wherefore ſince it is evident, that the Almighty hath the ordering thereof, and calleth us unto him, as is ſaid, by extraordinary formes, when, where, and how he pleaſeth;
                  Let us with unfained humility of heart proſtrate our ſelves with true repentance and hearty prayers, ſhewing lively fraits thereof in a Chriſtian converſation; and then, without all question, his Rod will be taken away from us and our Land, and alſo I adviſe all ſuch as it may or ſhall concern, to repair unto ſuch good means and learned Counſel, as at the inſtant may be had, for the preſerviug of their lives, and for the curing this fearful diſeaſe, and that without dangerous preſumption, by delayes, over-much timorouſneſſe, or fearing, for in both theſe extremities we offend God and our neighbours.
                  And know, that all fleſh is ſubject to this diſeaſe, for it ſpareth no age, ſex, nor degree of Mankind whatſoever.
                  And amongſt many evils, this one great miſery attends it, and is incident to the vulgar people ſick of this diſeaſe, that when the diſeaſe reigneth, the Learned and moſt skilful men, together with the beſt Divines and most able men of eſtate, which with their relief ſhould comfort and adminiſter unto them both ſpiritual and bodily comforts, as alſo many of their moſt neer and chiefeſt friends, are wanting and fled, and in their places ſpring up unworthy, unskilful, impudent, yea, and vagrant wretches, as I may term ſome of them, that in ſuch times uſually take npon them impudently the charge of many good mens lives; who alſo then are incident to be committed to the hands of wicked and unskilful Nurſes, and I had almost ſaid mercileſſe Keepers, which make their caſes yet more lamentable: of which, my ſelf have had full experience, when I had the diſeaſe.
                  And for as much as in thoſe times very many of the chiefeſt Traders of our Citizens of London, as alſo of other remote parts of the Countrey, flye from the City, which commonly ſet the poor on work, the caſe of the poorer ſort is made yet more miſerable: all which miſeries, with many more attending this noyſome diſeaſe, is no way to be diverted from mankind, but by the tender mercy of God: So that each man for himſelf and his neighbour, eſpecially in ſuch times, is juſtly obliged to call unto God, and ſay, Lord have mercy upon us: And ſo in brief, I conclude my Preface.
               
            
            
               
                  DE PESTE, OR The Plague.
               
                  And firſt what the Plague is.
                  
                     The definition of the Plague. 
                     THe Plague is a diſeaſe venomous and contagious, loathſome, noyſome, fearful, and hateful to Mankind, yea, and deadly for the moſt part, being accompanied with variety of grievous ſores, as Carbuncles, Botches, Blaynes, and alſo producing ſpots and diſcolourings of the skin, by Ancient Writers called Peſtities, and vulgarly with us, although unproperly, called Gods token, for that the peſtilential Bubo and Carbuncle are by far more manifeſt ſigns of the Plague then the ſpots are, for that the like ſpots are ſeen in fevers, which cannot truly be called peſtilential.
                  The Diſeaſe may fitly be called, (Flagellum Dei pro pe
                           •
                        catis mundi,) The rod of God for the ſins of the world; and even the word, Plague, if derived from the Latine word Plaga, which is a wound, a ſtripe, a ſtroke or a hurt, is a juſt definition of this horrid diſeaſe, for who ſo hath this diſeaſe, he is wounded, he is plagued, he is ſtrucken▪ yea, and that by the Almighty. In brief, it is a killing diſeaſe, fearful to Mankind, for that at unawares, it ſeiſeth upon, invadeth and poſſeſſeth mans body, as well ſleeping as waking, and being once entred in, it produceth divers fearful and deadly accidents, and that with great celerity: ſo as Theophraſtus Paracelſus, amongſt others a learned Writer, deſcribing this diſeaſe, calleth it (Baſiliſcus elementorum) alluding it to that (Baſiliſcus
                     The Plague compared to a Baſilisk. 
                     Olymphi) who as the Latine Maxime hath it, Solo viſu interficit hominem, onely by his ſight killeth mankind, but, faith he, with a limitation, as not ſimply done, Actualiter per ſe, & per ſpeci
                           •
                        m viſibilem, not by the act it

ſelf, and viſible ſpecies of the creature, but by reaſon of the aqueous and humid ſubſtance thereof.
                  Moreover, the body of the Creature, being as the Author affirmeth very porous and hollow; there are ſent out of it ſuch vapours, as infect the ayr, which infected ayr, ſo ſoon as it is drawn into mans body, it doth immediately kill him; in like manner, this Monſter in mankind, the Plague, killeth thoſe whom it breatheth upon, ſo that no man can account himſelf ſafe, the diſeaſe proceeding from the influence of the Heavens, as many of the moſt learned Writers teſtifie it doth, ſo that by their great diſtemperatures, the ayr being poyſoned and infected, which we are enforced to receive into the ſecret cloſets of our bodies, which undoubtedly hath its original, De Praeſcientia Dei.
                  
                  What ſafety have we then, or what can be a more fearful enemy to mankind then l▪eſtilential Vapours, which ſeize upon mankind as a Thief, and invade him at unawares, which lurk in every corner of the houſe, yea in his moſt ſecret chambers, threatning to take away his life when he leaſt miſtruſts, yea when he is in his quiet ſleep, as is ſaid? ſuch is this horrid diſeaſe, from the which God of his infinite Mercy deliver us and our land.
               
               
                  Of the parts of Mans body, that this Diſeaſe chiefly invadeth.
                  
                     Of the parts of man moſt ſubject to infection. The parts of the body of man that this Diſeaſe chiefly delighteth to invade or ſeize upon, are the three principall and moſt noble parts of man, viz, the Animal, vital, and the natural faculties which have theirThree parts eſpecially. ſeveral ſeats in the brain, the heart, and the liver, upon one or all theſe principal parts, this infection uſeth to take hold, and being on entred therein, as it were in a moment of time, it ſurpriſeth, ſubjugateth, captivateth, yea and triumpheth over the whole body of man, and over all the faculties thereof, to his utter ruine and deſtruction, if God be not the more merciful unto him in his preſervation; and howſoever, as it is ſaid, that the diſeaſe chiefly doth ſeize upon the three principal parts of mans body aforenamed, yet having firſt ſo done, it feareth not to ſhew his ſubtil fury all over the body, and ſets its mark every where, without order or control.
               
               
                  Whether the Plague may be called a Feaver or not.
                  There hath been much diſpute amongſt ancient Writers, whether the Plague be a Fever or no, by reaſon of the ſubtility and unequality thereof, but for what I can gather by my experience, I am out of doubt,The Plague a Fever. that he which hath the plague is not without a Fever▪ neither is he ever freed from the danger of that Fever, untill one, or more then one Criſis happen, for untill either Botch, Carbuncle, Blayne or Spots, called peſtities, do manifeſt themſelves, no juſt indication can be had what will become of the patient, but that he is alwayes in expectation of Death, the diſtemper continuing.
                  
                     
But if upon production of any the former Symptomes, a digeſtion in nature follow (as is ſaid) namely the Feaver ceaſe, the ſicke perſon take moderate reſt, a Botch come to good ſuppurati
                        •

                     nindigeſted quitture,Symtones of recovery. with mitigation of the dolour, or that the Blaynes drying and withering by Gods mercy, through cordial Diaphoreticks or the like, that a chearfulneſſe in the ſicke appeare, or but ſome one of theſe good ſignes ſhewing it ſelfe in a favourable manner, there is great hope, and the fear is almoſt paſt.
                  And let no man ſo much flatter himſelfe, in his owne coneir, in the time of contagion, when he perceiveth the ayre to be manifeſtly infected, the diſeaſe being popular, as to think with himſelfe that becauſe the Diſeaſe perhaps at the firſt, beginneth ſlowly, and the diſtemper yet dull and not much outwardly apparent upon the patient, that he hath no feaver nor danger, and that he may take time till the next day to conſider wheather he will uſe remedies or no, let no wiſe man ſo preſume, for I have ſeene very many ſtrucken even at the heart, when the diſeaſe could not be adjudged dangerous, neither by the pulſe, urine, nor any other certaine indicateon, ſave onely by the complaint of the patient, who under favour in that diſeaſe, is not alwayes ſenſible of his own danger; and againe, how many have at the very firſt, an apparent fierce Feaver, which can no way be removed, but by ſome of the former wayes of digeſtion, or by Death, whereby it is manifeſt, the Plague is never without a Feaver, and ſo all men will adjudge it, that either have had it, or that have followed the cure thereof in others.
               
               
                  Of the ſupernatural cauſes of this Diſeaſe.
                  
                     The firſt cauſe Six. The material cauſes thereof, as is already declared, are in part, and in the prime place eſteemed to be our ſinnes, which draw Gods wrath upon us, as witneſſe the Prophet Amos, where he ſaith, Shall there be evill in a City, and the Lord hath not done it? &c. Whereby we may juſtly gather, that when the Almighty will ſhew him ſelfe in his fury, againſt duſt and aſhes, he can put the Hoaſt of Heaven in his order to fight againſt us, in which caſe we have no way to eſcape his judgment, but by Prayer, or unfained Repentance, and as for all other natural or efficient cauſes, they have as their ſubordinated dependances and effects from the former, and are conſtellated, put on, and put off by Divine Providence, viz. ex Praeſcientia Dei By the fore-knowledge of God.
                  Nam aſtraregunt homines, regit & aſtra Deus.
                  As the Poets ſay; and the very Heathens conclude no leſſe, that the ſtarres govern mans body, and God governs the ſtarres; and alſo experience tells us, that when any of the foure ſeaſons of the yeare prove unnatural, mens bodies accordingly become unnatural, as ſometimes by peſtilential diſeaſes▪ wherefore to multiply words further of

the primitive cauſes of this diſeaſe, were but to detract good time, and the truth thereof is manifeſt to all men, in that this furious diſeaſe as it were diſdaines any generall Method or order of cure, after mans intention as it is ſaid, when it is in Rage.
                  
                     Quicquid facimus mortale genus,
                     Quicquid patimur, venit ab alt

                  Which may be thus Engliſhed.
                  That whatſover man doth, or whatſoever man ſuffereth, all proceedeth from above.
               
               
                  Of the natural cauſes of the Plagues by the judgment of the moſt ancient and moderne Writers.
                  The terreſtrial cauſes thereof, are by common conſent of moſt writers, as followeth: Venemous and ſtincking vapors ariſing from Fens,The cauſes of the Plague. ſtanding ponds or pooles, Ditches, Lakes, Dunghils, Sinckes, Channels, Vaults, or the like, as alſo uncleane ſlaughter-houſes of Beaſts, dead carkaſſes of men, as in time of Warre, and of ſtincking fiſh, fowl, or any thing that hath contained life, and is putrid, as alſo more particularly in great Cities, as in London, the unclean keeping of houſes, Lanes, Allies, and ſtreets, from thoſe recited and the like infectious venemous vapors, by warmth of the Sun exhaled, are apt and able to infect the living bodies of men, and thereby to produce the Plague, which once produced, is too apt by infection to ſpread it ſelfe,The corruption of the Ayre a cauſe. and become popular, as experiene too much ſheweth: and as by corrupt meats and drinkes, mens bodies are corrupted and infected, even ſo by corrupt ayre (as I have ſaid) which we can no way avoid, to draw into the ſecreteſt parts of our bodies; the ſpirits are likewiſe infected and poyſoned, to the production both of ſickneſſe and death (if God be not the more merciful unto us) for where the diſeaſe once beginneth, there are many unhappy evils incident, as cauſes conducing toWant of food a cauſe. the increaſe thereof; beſides Vapors, and one not of the leaſt is, it bringeth ſcarcity of food with it, and that brings emptineſſe of the belly, and where emptineſſe is, there evill aire is not wanting, and that aboundeth too much with the poorer ſort; and alſo where food is wanting, all kinds of food, how infectious or pernitious ſoever, is uſed in neceſſity, namely all raw fruits, as plums, peaches, yea muſty Corn, and many things of far wilder condition, and ſo by conſequent, lack of food, is a great cauſe of the increaſe of the Plague, ſo that in theV
                           •
                        wholſome food a cauſe. ſickneſſe time, it is by experience dayly found, that far more of the poorer fort uſually have dyed, then of the richer; for where emptineſſe and unwholſome food is in uſe, as is repeated, there the corrupt ayre doth the moſt harme.
                  And likewiſe genreally obſerve, that where war is for the moſt part, there is famine, and thoſe two conclude to make up a third evill, namely

the peſtilence which God be praiſed we have bin long freed from the two firſt. Thus much in brief of the Terreſtrial cauſes of the Plague.
               
               
                  Of the precedent and accidentall ſignes of the Plague.
                  
                  The precedent and accidential fignes notable in the Diſeaſe of the Plague, are various and uncertaine, becauſe in truth they are ſeldome in any one perſon as in another, but to ſpeak, as of the moſt general firſt appearance of the Plague, it beginneth cold, and with pain in the head and ſtomach, and ſometimes in the backe, and if ſo, then it is commonly taken for an Ague, and therefore at firſt little feared.
                  Again, ſome begin to complain of pain in the backe, and ſuch kinds of beginning, are more generally hopeful of healing then, when it beginneth hot (in my opinion) in ſome alſo it beginneth hot, with pain and giddineſſe of the head, and pain in the ſtomach: others at the firſt ſtroak or touch, find a general diſcouragement and weakneſſe over all the whole body, others at the firſt being taken in the head, their ſenſes are ſtupified and dulled: in others it beginneth with a raging and fierce fevour, ſo that their countenance is changed, their ſpeech fayling, or fainting, their eyes ſtrangely turning to and fro, in a feareful manner.
                  Again, others complaine of an extraordinary pain, with extreame heat inward in the ſtomach and intrals, when the outward parts are chil and cold, and ready to ſhake: again, ſome in the beginning complain of great thirſt; others complain of ſhortneſſe of breath, and paine in breathing; others ſwelling and ſoreneſſe of their throats which being ſought into, no cauſe appeareth: Others have the Almonds or Glandules of their throat much ſwelled and inflamed.
                  Alſo many are taken with great defire to ſleep, and with frequent yawnings, and it is unſafe, in my judgment, to permit ſuch to ſleep before a Diaphoretick or ſweating Medicine have by the patient bin taken, and that it hath breathed out ſome of the venemous vapours by ſweat, with keeping them waking, till the medicine have wrought his effect.
                  Others are ſubject to great watchfulneſſe, and commonly thoſe are in their ſlumbers oppreſſed with grievous and fearful dreames and fantaſies. Others it beginneth with ſweatings, with pain of the back, and a ſtinking of the breath, and ſuch are ever of very doubtful cure, and in my opinion ſuch have inward Carbuncles. Others have ſwellings in the breſt, ſome alſo have loſſe of appetite, evill digeſtion, and faintneſſe, and ſome are troubled with deep hickcoks and hollow belchings.
                  Others from the beginning to the end of their ſickneſſe, and till death, have neither ſwelling ſores nor ſpots▪ alſo upon ſome at firſt there appeare diverſe ſpots of a duſkiſh colour, their countenance of an unequal aſpect, the one cheek red the other pale: Others with ſweat drops on their noſes, a fierce countenance with grinding of the teeth.
                  
                     
And to be briefe, touching ſignes, and accidents in this moſt feareful diſeaſe, I perſwade my ſelfe, that no man can ſpeak of anyNo ſymptome of any diſeaſe, but is incident to the infected of the Plague. terrible ſymptome, ſigne, or indication of any diſeaſe whatſoever, that hath befallen any man, but that the like hath been ſeen and obſerved in ſome one perſon, or more ſick of the Plague: for the fierceneſſe thereof in ſome perſons, forceth Hemorrhage both from the greater and leſſer veines; and ſome it afflicteth with a Diſſenteria, Diarraea, Lienteria, all theſe from the belly; and from the head, it produceth Apoplexia, Paralyſis, Lythergi, Vertigo Mania, with diverſe other ſymptomes alſo from the throat, Squinancia, Angina, &c. Alſo obſtructions of the bowels, retention of Urine, Colica and Iliaca Paſsio Singultus, Gangrena, Convulſions, Contractions of Nerves and what not, this fierce diſeaſe produceth to devoure poore mankind by: and ſurely, for that cauſe I am perſwaded it is vulgarly called the ſickneſſe, as comprehending and including all other ſickneſſe in it ſelfe.
               
               
                  Accidental ſignes, which in this diſeaſe commonly preſage death to the partie, are theſe that follow.
                  
                     Signes that preſage death. Namely, when the Patient is poſſeſſed with ſounding and faintings, with cold and clammie ſweats, often changing of the countenance, vomiting of ſlimie, ſharp, and ill-coloured flegme, either greeniſh, yellowiſh, blackiſh, or bloud-coloured ſanies; or avoiding of Excrements diſordered, and diſcoloured, either fattie, blackiſh, unctious, or unnaturally, ſtinking, Convulſions, Contractions, of the Nerves, graveling and pidling with the fingers, plucking up the Bedclothes; a ſudden flux of the belly of ſtinking matter, of ruſtie or greeniſh colour; a ſudden going back of an Apoſtume, Carbuncle, or Bubo; alſo when the Patient is inſenſible of the departure of his Urine, and Excrements.
                  And yet to Gods glory I here affirme, that notwithſtanding the aforeſaid ſignes, or ſome one of them, I have ſeene, I ſay, ſome one or more of the afore-named ſymptomes appear, and that the ſicke hath even in mans judgment bin as at the point of death; and yet nevertheleſſe, by breathing of a Veine, or giving of a good Diaphoretick Cordial, the partie hath bin recovered, and lived. Wherefore I would adviſe the diſcreet Surgeon, that dare adventure his perſon in ſuch caſes, not to leave doing of good to his Patient by all rationall adminiſtrations and applications, ſo long as life appeareth.
                  
                     The convenience of thė cure. And one comfort is to the Patient and Surgeon in this diſeaſe before and beyond all others, that having once overcome the Feaver ſo that the bleſſing of health but appeareth, by appetite and competent reſt, or the like cheareful fignes: no ſores heal faſter then Peſtilential Sores doe. And yet per contra, I have alſo had too much experience in the curing of the diſeaſed of the Plague, that it is generally the ungratefulneſſe recompenſed of all other diſeaſes,

to the poore and hardie Surgeon: Namely, fot that he when he hath recovered his Patient, for the moſt part is loathed, ſhunned, and avoided, not onely of his Friends and Patients, but for his hazard, coſt, and care, is ſo under-valued, that ſometime, but for preſumingThe inconvenience. to tell his Patients, after he hath recovered them, that they had the Plague, he hazardeth the future loſſe of their favours, yea, and ſometimes, under favour, hath his owne houſe ſhut up, to make him amends withall.
                  Wherefore ſuch ungratefulneſſe hath made me, in my old age, to call to mind the motto of Paracelſus, that moſt famous Artiſt, formerly repeated.
                  Alterius non ſit, qui ſuus eſt poteſt;
                  Let him not be anothers, that can be his owne.
                  And yet I confeſſe, I neither can nor will refraine in one good way, or another, to be doing good in my calling, by Medicines or Advice, both in general and particular, in that or any other diſeaſe, ſo long as God doth give me life and health, with ſtrength thereunto, maugre the ingratitude of the unworthieſt ſort of them.
                  Quia nos non nobis nati ſumus;
                  Becauſe we were not bome for our ſelves.
                  And it is juſt and laudable for every worthy Surgeon to be knowne, by walking fairely and blameleſſe in his Calling, and namely, by doing good at all ſeaſons, although with ſome perſonall hazard now and then, for that he is therefore ordained by the Almightie to be ever ready, ad omne quare, upon every occaſion; which who ſo truly obſerveth, ſhall be bleſſed.
                  For to this end every Artiſt, yea and every Chriſtian man is ordained, and alſo commanded by the holy Apoſtle S. Paul, in theſe words, to doe good, and diſtribute; Forget not, for with ſuch ſacrifice the Lord is well pleaſed: and S. Iames ſaith, that it is true Religion, to viſit the Fatherleſſe and widow in their adverſities, &c. And even the excellencie of the Calling of Surgeons ſhould incite them to zeale where they can, as well without reward as for reward, where poverty is, and need requireth.
               
               
                  
                  Of the three chief and moſt principal outward ſignes or indications of this Diſeaſe, vulgarly called the Plague: and of a fourth.
                  THere are onely but three moſt notable certaine externalThree certaine ſignes of the Plague. ſignes of the Plague apparent to all, and thoſe faile not to teſtify the truth of the diſeaſe: and by thoſe, each old Wife by her experience, may maintaine her report of the diſeaſe, as amply and well as the skilfulleſt Doctor, in times of contagion; and they are as followeth.
                  
                     Of the firſt outward ſigne of the Plague.
                     
                        IMprimis, the Bubo Peſtilentialis; which, as I may ever juſtly affirmThe 
                              •
                           i

                           ſt ſigne Bubo. of mine own experience, was to me the happy Botch, ſent upon my own body by Gods mercy, and was the ſparing of my life; for I had it twice, namely, at two ſeveral Plague-times, in my Groyne.
                     Theſe Buboes, Boyles▪ or Peſtilential Botches commonly happenThe firſt place where the Plague ſhewes it ſelfe. in the Emunctories, ſincks, or cleanſing parts of the body, as the Artiſt tearmes them, and ſeldome elſewhere (if they be peſtilential) namely, they come in the glandulous parts, under or behind theThe Brain. care, if the Brain be oppreſſed, which is the place by which the Brain, if Nature be able, driveth out and diſchargeth her ſelfe of the Venome or poyſoned Infection, which otherwiſe would kill the animal ſpirits, and by that, the whole body alſo.
                     
                        The ſecond place. Or it cometh ſub axillis, under the arme-holes, as it is uſually called, where alſo are certain ſmall Glandules, or Kernels; and to thatThe Heart. part the heart ſendeth out the venemous vapours, or offending matter, either by force of Nature, or Art which ſuddenly groweth there to an Impoſtume, Botch, or Boyle.
                     
                        The third place. The third and laſt place, where commonly a Peſtilential Bubo commeth, is in the Groine, which the Artiſt calleth Inguen; where,The Liver. when the Liver is oppreſſed, and Nature ſtrong, ſhe ſendeth forth the diſeaſe or Botch thither, and that is the third part where the Botch appeareth: And, as by the way, to the Artiſts of the younger ſort a word two of my practicall obſervations, by way of diſtinguiſhing the difference betwixt the Venereal and Peſtilential Bubo; wherein a young Artiſt may be miſtaken, to his prejudice.
                     
                        
Wherefore let the Artiſt obſerve, as common practice ſheweth, that the Venereal Bubo, although it ever appear in the Groyn, it is ſlower in his progreſſe then the peſtilential Bubo is, for the Peſtilential commeth for the moſt part with a Feaver: and although the Venereal ſometimes in his augmentation in younger perſons hath a 
                           •
                        mal feaver for a day or two, when it is almoſt at ſtate, it being alwayes thwart upon the dependant part of the Belly, called Imus venter, or the lower belly, namely in Inguen upon or over Os pubis; But the Peſtilential Bubo or boyl commeth ever furiouſly on, and as in a rage of a Feaver, and as being in haſte, ſometimes it lighteth on or near Inguen thwart, but more often lower upon the thigh, pointing downeward with one end, the upper and towards the belly, being commonly the biggeſt or the fulleſt part of the Bubo, the whole thigh being alſo inflamed, which if it doth not hold, ever to come right in the place where the venereall Botch doth as is ſaid, but as neer the Emunctories as it may, yet
                     Howſoever by the fury and uncertaine ſeat therof, the peſtilential is ever to be knowne from the venereal, and the more certaine by his furious comming, or when the Plague raigneth, and it happeneth to children, which cannot be ſaid to be venereal, and yet nevertheleſſe, even in contagious times, a venereal Bubo is not to be forbidden by any Surgeon to happen, if his Patient pleaſe to have it ſo.
                     But to conclude this poynt, the diſcreet Surgeon at the firſt ſight, the other forenamed circumſtances well weighed, may eaſily know to make a true diſtinction ſufficiently, if he be a man of judgment: and thus much of the firſt outward ſigne of the Plague, viz. The Bubo, Botch, or peſtilential Boyle.
                  
                  
                     Of the ſecond outward ſign of the Plague.
                     
                     THe ſecond outward ſigne in the Diſeaſe, is the moſt fierce burning Carbuncle called Anthrax, or the burning coale, which happeneth his & ubique, namely in every part of mans body, without order, rule, or controule, within the body, as well as without,The ſecond ſign Anthrax.
                         and at the firſt appearance thereof (if viſible) it doth appear commonly inflamed and hard, and 
                           〈◊〉
                         the middeſt thereof, with a burning pain afflicting the ſick, like to burning fire, yea and will ſometimes bliſter even with the ardent Fervour thereof, and in othersThe effcte of it. it will itch very much, which if it be ſcratched, there will come forth a ſharp reddiſh yellowiſh, or ſometimes a duſky coloured Ichor.
                     
                     
                        The deſcription of it. And to ſome again, the paine is ſo fierce and great, that the Patient will grow to to be mad with extremity thereof.
                     
                        
                        The deſcription of it. The ſhape or figure of this Diſeaſe is moſt commonly ſomewhat round▪ and the colour uncertaine, according to the predomination of the humour infected or infecting, or ſometimes it is pale, though the party be in a feavour, ſometimes reddiſh, ſometmies black or purple, or greeniſh, and the two laſt colours are moſt feareful, and this diſeaſe▪ is ſeldome healed, without ſo much loſſe of the muſculous fleſh and ſkin, as it taketh firſt hold of, in what part ſoever it happen, except by ſweating medicines in the beginning of the diſeaſe, the fury thereof be changed; but it is a very good ſigne of life when it ſeparateth it ſelfe ſo, that the Fever ceaſe, for the Carbuncle commeth ſeldome or never to ſuppuration as doth the Bubo: But it will admit ſeparation, and come to a kind of unperfect digeſtion many times, and after wil come to fall out as a gangrenated part doth, where Nature is ſtrong, and it uſually will ſeparate and come away in one intire piece from the ſound, but if it grow black and ſeparate not, nor any circular digeſtion be, and the Feaver abate not, then it may befeared Death is at hand, for little hope of recovery is in the Patient.
                     
                        The danger of it. And againe if it appeare greeniſh, the party commonly dyeth; alſo you ſhall ſee ſome Carbuncles ſmooth as glaſſe, and of a blacke ſhining colour, not unlike pitch, with intollerable paine, and the member whereon they are fixed, will be ponderous and unwildy to move to and fro, and ſeeming to the patient, as if it were heavily overburthened, or as though it ſuffered by hard ligature, and I have ſeen Patients that have had Carbuncles within the body, whereof one hath been within the ſtomach, and ſome have it in their liver, and ther principal parts, but ſuch live not many dayes. I have taken out the whole eye from one, by a Carbuncle ſeated therein, who recovered, and from another the halfe noſe, from another the halfe of the beard, with alſo the lippe whereon it grew, which of it ſelfe fell off by ſeparation, and from the third, one of his teſticles, I mean one of his ſtones, with the purſe and all, and that man was with the halfe of his Scrotum, living at the writing hereof, as in my other Treatiſe elſewhere is mentioned. Thus much of the ſecond principal ſigne or apparant Demonſtration of the Plague, namely the Carbuncle.
                  
                  
                     Of the Blaine.
                     
                        The third ſigne a Peſtilential Blain. THe third manifeſt and demonſtrative ſigne of this Diſeaſe is the Peſtilential Blain, whereof ſome infected have many, and divers have not one: and this Diſeaſe is a painful angry puſh, ſomewhat like the ſmall pock, but yet in colour more red orThe deſcripion of it. cloudy, ſeldome tranſparent, as a ſmall pock uſually is, but farre more paineful: ſome have them ſomewhat leſſe, ſome bigger, with a ſmall head, of an angry blew or reddiſh colour, ſometimes of a lead colour,

and ſomewhat hard or fleſhy, and as it were growing upon a large root, or ſtool, this Diſeaſe is found in every part of the body, but this Blain ſeldome killeth, or hindreth the cure of the diſeaſed, but it rather ſerves for a demonſtrative ſign of the Diſeaſe, then otherwiſe, and helpeth to breathe out the venome, as I gather. For if by vertue from above, or of good Medicines, or by ſtrength of nature, the feavourThe cauſe of it. be overcome, the Blain dryeth away, and requireth no other cure: For, as I conceive, it only proceeds (ex ebullitione Sanguinis Venenoſi) of the ebullition or boyling of venemous blood, which being thruſt out, either by the immediate work of God, or Art, or Nature, health eaſily followeth, and the blains vaniſh, unleſſe by natures weakneſſe, or through the undue uſe or want of Phlebotomy, or of purging medicines, or for want of following the cure, by Diaphoretick medicaments in ſeaſon, the venome be repelled from the ſupe

                        ficies to the centre, as too oft in the cure of that diſeaſe it happeneth, and in ſuch a caſe, eminent death is to be feared: And ſo I conclude of the third notable ſign, the Blayn.
                  
                  
                     Of the Marks, or ſpots, commonly, though neither properly, nor alwaies truly called, Gods Tokens.
                     
                     
                        The fourth ſign, Gods tokens. The fourth apparent outward ſign of the plague, is the markes or ſpots appearing upon the skin, uſually called Gods tokens, but not as being ever certain tokens of the peſtilence, and ſo of death to the patient, as vulgarly they are taken to be, by ignorant peopleOf the ignorantly miſtaking them. in their unexpert conjectures and opinions, for that it is daily manifeſt, many have ſpots of ſeveral formes and colours, when venomous feavours reign, and yet have not the Plague: and again, many have ſuſpitious and fearful ſpots, which the vulgar term Gods tokens, and recover, and live many yeares after▪ my ſelf have cured not a few in that kind▪ that are now, to Gods glory, living; theſe ſpots are upon ſome bodies like Flea-bitings, in others larger, in ſome again as big as a penny.
                     
                        Of the ſeveral colours. In ſome bodies there are very many, and ſometimes they are like freckles, and they are moſt commonly found upon the breaſt, and ſometimes upon the back, arms, and legs of the patients; they are in ſome of a colour blewiſh, or of a ſad red, and ſome are like lead-colour, and others purple, ſome are of a pale-blew, and theſe ſpots are ever without pain: but the very appearance of any ſpots, to any in the Plague, cauſe ſudden fear to the Patient; which, though the markes be inſenſible, yet through ſudden fear, they produce faintings,Their effects cauſed by fear. ſwoundings, trembling of the heart, and death following thereupon, although neither the Patient feel pain, as is ſaid, neither alwayes

the Artiſt can judge, by reaſon he ſeeth juſt cauſe of ſudden death to his Patient, the reaſon being ſecret with God, as inwardly afflicting maukind, de Praeſcientia Dei, namely of the fore-knowledge of God: So much of the marks, ſpots, or tokens, in ſome appearing, in the Diſeaſe of the Plague.
                  
               
               
                  Certain Caveats by way of Advice, for the preventing of the Sickneſſe.
                  AMongſt which Citò, Longè, Tardè, are by many good Writers preſcribed and much inſiſted upon, as in the firſt place, andFlight an uncertain remedy. their meanings are, that people fly quickly, fly farre, and tarry long from the danger of the infected ayr, where it reigneth. And I deny not but they are good rules; but even they, daily experience ſheweth, are alſo moſt uncertain, Quia Deus ubique eſt, for our God is every where, and returneth ſome home (I will not ſay with a vengeance) neither can all men make uſe of thoſe rules, how good ſoever, neither is it fit that all men ſhould flee, for many reaſons too long to be inſiſted upon.
                  And let him that flyeth, for the firſt, whereſoever he lives, beware of provoking God, by ſurfeiting, either by fulneſſe of eating or drinking, even in the beſt aire, how good ſoever the Meat or Drink be; for fulneſſe in contagious times menaceth danger.

                     Seaſonable times to be obſerved. Alſo beware of being abroad too early or too late, in times of contagion, and obſerve a good cuſtome with your own body: do not ſuffer your body to be too coſtive, or over-much bound; neither is itHow to order the body in time of infection. ſafe, to keep a mans body daily in purging, no, nor in daily looſeneſſe, for extream looſeneſſe is not good, nor ſafe, in contagious times: neither bleed but by good advice (if it may be had,) neither before nor after the time of the Sickneſſe, for that fearfull dangers enſue often by unadviſed bleeding or purging in contagious times; for thereby, in ſeeking to avoid danger, contagious and venomous vapours are often drawn from the ſuperficies, or outward parts of the body, to the Centre; and namely, to the Liver, Heart, or Brain, or to one of them.

                  Beware alſo that no man that hath any Peſtilential tumor or riſing, be it Botch, Carbuncle, or Blain, doe open a vein without very ſound advice, nor purge, and if he doe want ſuch advice, then let the veine be opened on that ſide he moſt complaineth of, and not otherwiſe, as he tendereth the patients life: it is alſo good not to be thinne clad in contagious times, for that the ſickneſſe, with the moſt beginneth cold, neither to lye too cold in bed, ſweating is far ſafer for any man in health, for preventing diſeaſes, then quakings.
                  Alſo beware of too violent excerciſes in ſuch times, for taking of ſudden cold, and beware of all provocations to the extremity of feare, care, anger, grief, watching, extremity of Venus luſt, or extremity of heat or cold, and alſo of delaying of helpe in due time, which hath coſt many a man deare, as elſewhere hath been certified.

                  A Caveat concerning fuming of Houſes, Chambers, or Garments, with Brimſtone.
                  THis one Caveat I deſire the Reader to take notice of, and to be warned, touching a groſſe Error by many uſed in their Fumes for Houſes or Apparell, which I have often obſerved; namely by the burning of Brimſtone to fume Houſes and Apparel with; which, in my opinion, as well they might preſcribe the fuming with Cinaber, Mercury, Arſenick, Rialger, or Antimony; for I am ſure, and can maintaine it, that the vapors are all venemous and deadly the one as well as the other.
                  
                     The Fume of Brimſtone dangerous. And I can ſpeak it of practiſe and proofe, that I my ſelfe have ſeen killed Cocks, Hens, and diverſe other Birds and living creatures, as Bees, Gnats, Flyes, &c. with the onely ſmoake of Brimſtone; and upon good grounds, I will not let to ſhew any man the practiſe for his learning: and that it moſt artificially killeth Fleas, Flyes, Lice, Gnats, and Bees, I need not prove.
                  Wherefore beware of it, for the fume of Brimſtone is venemous and deadly, I know it; and that it is an enemy to the Brain and will quickly confound the animal faculties. My ſelfe have bin from my youth delighted in Alchymy, and have opened the bodies of diverſe Minerals and farmiliarly of Sal, Sulphure, and Mercury, to my no ſmall coſt, and now and then ſome danger; and therefore I wiſh all wiſe men to beware of them: But if any one will teach his Neighbour the practiſe of fuming his Houſe with Brimſtone, let him firſt fume his owne Bed-chamber well with it certaine nights together, and ſhut his doore, the Roome being filled with fume, and goe to bed; or any ſmall Roome that is cloſe, where he would have the true force of the fume, then brag how he likes it, it perhaps may coſt him too dear.
                  
                     
And for his apparell, if it be either of wooll, or Silke, or of Linnen, it will ſurely doe hurt to it, as well by rotting them, as by ſtaining them.
                  There are ſome parts of the world, where there are great Mynes and mighty Mountaines of brimſtone perpetually burning: and it is affirmed, and for truth obſerved, that no Man, Beaſt, Bird, nor other living creature can live neere them, nor within the compaſſe of the vapor of them. Therefore I believe the author of the invention of fuming with Brimſtone, can never be able to make it good; that the vapors of Brimſtone are ſafe, nor ſo much as friendly to the life of man: witneſſe all the workers in like ſulphurous Metals, whoſe very countenance will witneſſe, that though the ſubſtances of Metals, are moſt ſerviceble to be uſed, yet their ſulphurous, Mercurial, and Arſenical vapors of them are often proved to be moſt deadly; yet will I not deny, but that Brimſtone is many wayes medicinable, and ſo is Quick-ſilver, to be taken into mans body, duly adminiſtred and prepared artificially; but not their crude vapors, by way of fuming. Thus much of Brimſtone, by way of fuming Houſes or Apparel.

                     Alſo the ſmelling unto Oyl of Amber is very good; I mean not Ambergreece, for that were too dear for the meaner ſort, and not ſo well warranted by authority, for that uſe: But of that Amber which in Latine is called Succinum, and is that whereof Beades are made, and is gathered in the Seas, in Pruſsia, in the Eaſt Countreys; I ſay, the Oyl of ſuch Amber, whereof ſome is white, ſome is yellow: But that of the white is more excellent, and precious. If a Spunge, or anyThe vertue of the Oyl of white Amber. other fit thing be wet in Vineger, and certain drops of the ſaid Oyl added; or onely a dry Spunge, and certain drops of this Oyl dropped into the Spunge, and put into a Box, and ſmelled unto it, it preſerveth from any infectious ayr, and comforteth the animal faculties of the body exceedingly, and is likewiſe good againſt Apoplexies, and other Cephalick diſeaſes. It being held one of the moſt precious remedies againſt the Plague of all other, and is not dear to be bought: And the ſame Oyl, one, two, or three drops taken faſting, either in white Wine, or Beer, is a very excellent Preſervative againſt the Plague.

                  Keep this as your life, above all worldly treaſure, take of it alwaies warm, both morning and evening a ſpoonful or two, if you be already infected, and ſweat thereupon; if not, a ſpoonful a day is ſufficient, half a ſpoonful in the morning, and half a ſpoonfull at night, all the Plague time: under God truſt to this, for there was never man, woman, nor child, that this deceived.
                  This is not onely for the common Plague, which is called the Sickneſſe, but for the ſmall Pox, Meazles, and Surfeits, and divers other diſeaſes.
                  This Medicine, as you may read, is praiſed to the full, and no doubt may well deſerve praiſe; and yet were I to put my life upon a medicine, I would not chooſe the aforeſaid Medicine for many reaſons. Firſt, that the compoſition thereof is uncertain, namely by penniworths, and the Angelica water doubtful whether it be of it ſelf ſimple, or drawn of Wine, the Treacle not declared whether common or no: and further, in my judgment, take it in the beſt ſenſe, the compoſition is rude, and too hot, fitter rather to inflame, then cure. But yet I leave it for them that have tryed it, or that liſt to try it, to make it up, and uſe it in the Name of God, who giveth his bleſſings beyond meaſure to mean things.

Limoniorum, qua. ſa. eſt.
                  
                  The Doſe of this, is at the moſt ʒ. j. ſe. But for that it hath an unpleaſing taſte unto ſome delicate palates, when I have it ready, I uſe to take thereof ʒ. ſe. and of Ther. Diateſſaron, or London Treacle,

And I know alſo it reſiſteth putrefaction, in the very nature thereof.
                  Wherefore, in my opinion, if it were not in ſome who apparantly have a fervent burning Feaver, where reaſon it ſelf would adviſe me to forbear Wine, I would uſe Wine before either Angelica, Carduus, Dragon-Water, or any of the like kindes, in the caſe of the Plague, as I have divers times elſewhere recited.

is for that they ſuffer not the body of man to putrefie, for Myrrhe, as Galen, Avicen, and many other ancient Writers affirm, and experience ſheweth them, reſiſteth putrefaction, ſo that a dead corps preſerved in Myrrhe, neither altereth nor ſtinketh in a long ſeaſon; and alſoAloes, its vertue. 
                        Aloes hath an excellent quality in purging Choler, and comforting and corroborating the Ventricle, and in preſerving it from putrefying: and Saffron by the conſent of all the Learned is a true cordial medicine; and, as Avicen teſtifieth, it never altereth humours to the worſt, but refreſheth, amendeth, and purifieth the putrid, and conveyeth with it other medicines to the comfort of the heart, and other principall parts of the body.
                     And one Johannes Hartmannus an ancient reverend Writer, in his Treatiſe of the Peſtilence, writeth in commendations of theſe Pills, theſe very words following:
                     Non immerito his Pillulis magnam adhibeo fidem, in ſeptem conſtitutionibus Peſtilentialibus, quas tempore meo vidi, nemo ipſis uſus, Peſte interiit.
                     In Engliſh thus:
                     Not unworthily do I put great truſt in theſe Pills, for ſeven ſeaſons of the Plague, which my ſelf in my time ſaw, there was not one man dyed that uſed them, meaning the ſaid Pills; and the quantity preſcribed by the ſame Authour, to be taken by way of preſervative, as is recited, was 20 grains, which is about the weight of 3 d. and I my ſelf upon my own experience affirm, that in curing the diſeaſe where a purge is required, there is no purgation within my practice, ſafer nor ſurer then this Pill is, and to purge, the doſe is ʒ j. which although I confeſſe in ſome bodies it purgeth but ſlowly, yet in the diſeaſe of the Plague generally it is moſt requiſite and ſafe, to be very ſparing, and indeed well adviſed in giving way to any purging medicines at all.
                  
                  
                     A good ſafe medicine, for any whoſe complaints begin with a fulneſſe in their ſtomach, with nauſeouſneſſe and deſire to vomit.
                     BEing taken, the firſt day that a man findeth himſelf ſo to be infected, and to ſuch the medicine hath at once taking perfectly cured many; and it is a medicine which my ſelf would as ſoon take at the firſt as any medicine, if I felt my body upon fulneſſe diſeaſed, for it purgeth away the venom, both upwards and downwards, before nature be overcome thereby: but I muſt crave your pardon to deliver the medicine in Latine; for that I hold it not fit for any to undertake the making or preparing of the ingrediences thereof, for the avoiding danger, but the diſcreet, faithful and underſtanding Surgeon or Apothecary.

Give this whole quantity to a ſtrong man at once: but I hold it beſt, at the time of the taking of it, that he lye on his bed in his clothes, I mean, till the Medicine have done working, and that he drink warm Poſſet-drink after each Vomiting: and then, and not before, if he find himſelf not well, let him go to his naked bed, and faſting, take a nap, (if he can) and then when he awaketh, give him ſome ſmall Cordial, as namely, ʒ. j. of Mithridate, or of Diateſſaron, or of London Treacle, in Poſſet drink, and gently provoke him to be in a ſweating manner, not to ſweat too ſtrongly, and that for three or four hours. Which done, there may be given him a cup of Beer, with a toſte, if he deſire to drink, and give him to eat ſome light digeſting food, and I doubt not but he will do well very quickly.
                     But this kind of cure is onely for the beginning of the diſeaſe, and to be given, as is ſaid, to a full body, which hath a complaint of fulneſſe of his ſtomach.

                  The precedent Caveat touching purging Medicines Engliſhed, is in effect as followeth.
                  ONe Petrus Sibyllenius, a learned Phyſician of his time, in his Treatiſe De Peste doth write touching the uſe of Catharticke or purging Medicines, in the caſe of the Plague, as followeth, and reciteth his reaſons and authority for the ſame in theſe words.
                  
                     Solutives forbidden in the cure of the Plague. Concerning the opinion which ſome Phyſicians hold, that ſolutive and purging Medicaments are convenient in the beginning of this moſt ſharp ſickneſſe, the Plague, and that the venemous humour is to be driven out of the bodies infected with the Plague, by their force and heat: The cenſures of Galen and Avicen, by ſtrong arguments, are repugnant to their opinions. And Hippocrates confirmeth their anthorities in his L b. 4. de Dieta, or of Diet, which is to be uſed in ſharp ſickneſſes; where he ſaith, when in any ſharp ſickneſſe the opening of a Vein or ſolutive Medicaments are neceſſary, the Vein is firſt to be opened. And Avenſoar in the Lib. 3. de Theiſir ſaith, beforeBut in our Climate that Rule is not in g

                        od, but is liſt to fit occaſion and due time. any purgation be, he would adviſe that a general evacuation might be made; meaning, that letting blood is fit to be done. And becauſe, ſaith he, the uſe of laxative and purging Medicaments are ill, hurtfull, and dangerous to the body, by reaſon of many evident caſes; therefore he likewiſe condemneth the errour of the unlearned and barbarous Phyſicians and Mountebanks of his times, which would drive away the cauſe of the diſeaſe by violent purging Medicines, as namely with Mercurius praecipitate, which red powder they call falſly a precious Cathartick or purging Medicine; which having a great force of heat in them, they do draw forcibly and ſwiftly both the blood and humours which are in the Veines, and do drive them out, to the prejudice of Nature: by which commiſſion, Nature which governeth the body, is diſabled, ſtupified, and beaten down in her endeavour, touching her Criſis, her working and contending with the poyſonous vapours, ſo as for the moſt part it hapneth, that thereupon proceedeth a ſymptomatical expulſion, which is not far from death it ſelf. And therefore ſuch Medicines are not fit to be uſed in the beginning of the ſickneſſe, namely, the Plague. Moreover, all purging Medicaments draw the humours to the inward parts, that is, from the ſuperficies or outward parts to the centre of the body, which is the heart, and the effects follow deadly; for in venemous diſeaſes, the venomeought to be driven from the centre to the outwards: therefore Cathartick or purging Medicines being miniſtred in the beginning of this ſickneſſe, do more hurt then good. And in this further is to be added, that ſuch purging Medicines as are ſo ſtrong and ſharp, are eſteemed to be venemous of themſelves, and there is no venome or poyſon to be put to poyſon; for every ſuch thing as is added to his like, as the general Rule ſaith, maketh that more ſuch.
                  
                     
The Major is proved by Joh. Meſues de conſolatione Medicinarum, where he ſaith, that all laxative Medicines are of the ſort of venemous things, whoſe exceſſe nature cannot endure: therefore in time of the Plague, the diſeaſed bodies are not to be made empty by purgations,The Office of a Phyſician. ſeeing that a Phyſician is called, by reaſon of his office and Learning which he profeſſeth, a Miniſter, a keeper, and an imitator of Nature.
                  
                     The help of Nature in the Plague. Nature in the Plague, endeavours as much as in her is, to expel the venome to the ſuperficies of the body: Therefore a Phyſician ought to follow the tract of Nature according to the Aphoriſme of Hippocrates, 21. Lib. 1. Aphoriſ. Where Nature aymes his courſe, thither it behoves the Phyſician to intend his Artificial help.
                  
                     A reaſon of the danger of laxative Medicines. And becauſe Cathartick means, by their innate force and cruelty, do overthrow Nature, the ruler of the whole body, which alſo is made weak, by reaſon of the ſharpneſſe and force of the Plague, Nature is to be preſerved, and no laxative Medicine to be given.
               
               
                  Of variety of particulars for Brothes to be made for the ſick, according to mens ſeveral abilities, or neceſsities, and as the time and place hath to be added more, or in part forborn, upon each just occaſion.
                  
                     Of herbs convenient for Brothes. ANd firſt, for herbs fitteſt to be uſed in Brothes in this diſeaſe, they are Bugloſſe, Borage, Endive, Succory, Strawberry leaves, Marigolds, Parſely, Betony, Violet leaves, Sorrel, Wood-Sorrel, Plantane, any of theſe are very good, and ſo is Roſemary and Tyme, ſo that you take not too much of any of them, remembring alſo for the ſeaſoning and reliſhing of Brothes, as alſo for Sawce, you may ſafely make uſe of Sugar, Cynamon, Currants, Citrons, Oranges, Limons, juice of Limons, ripe and unripe Grapes, preſerved Barberries, Cherries, and Prunes, Wine Vineger, Verjuice, Mace, Cloves, Nutmegs, Saffron, and Wine, if occaſion be, to refreſh the ſpirits; for, as I have ſaid, I eſteem it far above any the ſimple waters of hearbs for a Vehicle, in the diſeaſe of the Plague.
                  
                     Neceſſary meats to be boyled in Broth. Alſo you may make your Brothes either of a Cock, orrather of a Cock Chicken, or of Mutton or Veal, or for the meaner ſort, of what elſe their means will reach unto; for many things that be held unſavoury, nauſeous, yea, and dangerous to the dainty, are found to be very conveniene, wholeſome, comfortable and precious to the poorer ſort; as Garlick, Leekes, Onions, Chyves, Wormwood, Centory, Angelica, Bay-berries, Gentian, and divers others, whoſe taſtes are harſh.

                  And in want of China roots, take the double part of Sarſaparilla, and in want of that, a large cruſt of the beſt bread of Wheat, for the poorer ſort; this alſo is good to contemperate the blood after ſweating: and further, it is of ancient Writers eſteemed, as a very good Cordial medicine, to give the party the quantity of a drach. or ʒ. i. ſ. of the fineſt Bolus Armen. in a cup of white Wine, with half a ſpoonful of Roſewater, and a little Sugar if you pleaſe; and in want thereof, give it in poſſet drink.

                  Alſo the juyce of Lemons or Oranges, wrung into the poſſet drink, is likewiſe very good, and the beſt of all to make it tart, and not over ſour, therewith, is a little oyl of Vitriol; for that no medicine is ſoOyl of Vitriol.

                        The Doſe of it. Keep this cloſe covered, and give for a preſervative the quantity of a Nutmeg; but by way of cure to provoke ſweat, give as much as a Walnut thereof, and ſweat well upon it: this is an approved good Medicine, and not much unſavoury to be taken, if it be truly made.
                     But if any perſon, for the unſavourineſſe of a medicine, will refuſe help, let him forbear, and expect, and take of what followes: and further note, that it will not be amiſſe, as I have ſaid, that after any cordial medicine be ſwallowed down without liquor, that a cup of good wine be given; or in want of it, warm Poſſet-Drink, or Beer.

                     Meanes to provoke ſweat. And if the Patient be unapt to ſweat, let Bottles of very hot water be filled, and put to his one ſide, and at his feet; or hot Bricks, ſomewhat quenched wirh water, and then wrapped with wet clothes, and layd to his ſide and feet, covering as well his face as any other part, leaving him but a ſufficient breathing place onely; and be ſure he ſweat lying on the one ſide, and not on his back: and he muſt be very careful to lye ſtill, and keep his armes in bed all the time of his ſweating; or that he have warm ſleeves to defend them from cold,

                  For thoſe which do take a good Cordial, that cauſeth ſweat at the very firſt, ſeldome have any outward Sores or markes at all; and if they have, they are light, ſmall, and eaſily healed: and when you find the danger of the perſon paſt, or venome of the ſickneſſe is ſpent, and the party chearful; then, and not before, may you, having

good advice, purge; but I hold it ſafer to forbear Laxatives even then alſo.
                  
                     A note of the danger of purging. For you muſt note, that if you purge, if there be any venomoús quality in the body at all left, as is ſaid, you draw it to the centre of the body, namely, to the heart, and ſo double the danger; and for the reſt of the cure, no man can preſcribe what in each body ſhall be fitting by any one general rule, for that one perſon is ſeldome taken as another, in that fearful diſeaſe.
                  Onely take this one thing for a rule of comfort in general, that this diſeaſe commonly is ſwift, and is ſhort, and doth begin and end in a moneth commonly at the utmoſt; for it is termed but the diſeaſe of one Moon: if the party be likely to live, and the danger of death for the time over, no Apoſtumes, Boyles, or Sores whatſoever do healOf the ſudden care of the Plague. faſter, nor ſooner, then thoſe of that diſeaſe of the Plague do, when the fury of the Feaver is once paſt. For the diſeaſe is a Feaver, like to a furious ſtorm, ſhort and terrible; but the fury once over, it is the calmeſt of all contagious diſeaſes whatſoever, and the eaſieſt to be healed, far better then the French Pox.
                  And moreover, note one thing elſewhere mentioned; in all cordial Medicines and Julips, there is not a ſafer nor better thing to reſiſt the putrefaction and venom, to comfort the head and the ſtomach, andOf the good uſe and danger of Oyl of Vitriol.
                      to quench thirſt, then is Oyl of Vitriol, ſo you uſe it warily; but you muſt be very wary, that to one draught of Drink, or Julip, you put not above four, or rather but three drops; and uſing it but a very little at a time, you may uſe it the oftner, and the ſafer: otherwiſe, there is ſome danger therein.
                  
                     The choyce of it. You ſhall know the goodneſſe of this Oyl, by the clearneſſe thereof, and by the weight thereof, for if it be as clear as Rock-water, and ponderous almoſt as Lead, then is it very good. By my will, I would never give any Purge, nor any Cordial without it, if I could have it; for I have found it, by much practice to be very precious.
                  Alſo, if you do take the quantity of one ounce of conſerve of Roſes, and about eight ſmall or ſingle drops of Oyl of Vitriol, and mix them exceeding well▪ and give the Patient a little thereof to eat, or at the leaſt to keep in his mouth now and then, in the time of his ſickneſſe, it is exceeding cooling and comfortable for him, and quencheth thirſt ſingular well.
                  
                     The vertue of Salt of Wormwood. And you ſhall find much the more profit in it, if you adde Salt of Wormwood thereto (as is ſaid elſewhere) either one Scruple, or half a Drachme for a Doſe, according to the ſtrength of the ſick, and vehemencyThe Doſe. of the diſeaſe; for it mightily encreaſeth the force of the other Medicine, in provoking of ſweat, and refreſheth the ſpirits. Sal-Niter is alſo good, if the diſeaſe proceed of a not cauſe, a like Doſe given.
                  
                     Things to be obſerved by the attenders of the ſick. And note further, one obſervation generally to be had in mind by the attenders of the ſick, that they give the Patients leave ever freely to put their arms out of the bed both night and day, except in the times

of ſweating; and to that end, be careful to provide them Waſtcoats, Sleeves, or, at the leaſt, the legs of old Hoſe, or any mean thing to the poorer ſort, to keep their arms warm.
                  For my ſelf know by experience of my own body, when I had the Plague, and ſo ſince of many others that have been under my cure, how comfortable a freedom it is for a ſick man to have leave to ſpread and caſt out his arms; and how uncomfortable a thraldome and impriſonment it is for a poor weak man, by his Keeper, to be forced to keep his arms in the bed, or in any one certain poſition: Wherefore the attenders of the ſick ought to have judgment and commiſeration, I mean, a fellow-feeling of the infirmities of the ſick, and chiefly, in this moſt fierce diſeaſe of the Plague.
                  
                      Note alſo, that in Summer, when the Sickneſſe beginneth hot or burning, in the Drinks that you give your Patients, whether Antidotes or Cordials, that you ever uſe Wine Vineger a ſpoonful or two, where you do not uſe Oyl of Vitriol; but if you have oyl of Vitriol, it far exceedeth Vineger, as is often ſaid.
                  
                      Alſo note eſpecially, in the houſe where a Child is infected, that great care be had to keep the Children from him: for there is a farre greater ſympathetical danger betwixt Children, then betwixt Men and Women; which daily experience ſheweth.
                  
                      Note alſo, that for Infants and tender Women, Andromach. or Venice Treacle is a good Medicine, as it is made, by the view and order of the Colledge of Phyſicians of London; and in want of it, which my ſelf would as ſoon take, good London Treacle, if it be alſo truly made, according to the preſcription, and by the view of the ſaid Reverend Doctours of the Colledge of London: I hold it a moſt fit Medicine;The Doſe of Theriac. Andromach, to a child. and the rather, for that it is of taſte eaſie to be taken in: but the quantity at a time to be taken of it, muſt be as is ſaid: to the ſtrongeſt may ſafely be given, ʒ. ij. which is about the weight of eighteen pence in money at a time; and to a Child, about 3 pence, or 6 pence, or 9 pence weight, according to their ſeveral ages and capacities: and alſo, if you can, and that you have convenience, it is good that you remove the ſick Patient ſometimes from one Bed to another, where convenience, means, and ability is; and that you uſe ſprinkling the Rooms with Wine Vineger ſometimes, as is ſaid, where it may be had.
               
               
                  
                  Of ſuch Dyet as is fitting for the ſick of the Plague to take.
                  FIrſt note, that a very ſparing Dyet in general is the moſt fir, if the Patients have full bodies, but in this diſeaſe, commonly all appetite is forgotten with the Patient: yet when you find, that the danger of death by the diſeaſe is over, and that the Patient amendeth, then good refreſhing and nouriſhing food is beſt, uſing it ſparingly.
                  
                     Fitting meats to be eaten by the ſick. And firſt, for the delicate, and they which may have it, let them in the Name of God eat Pheaſant, Partridge, Quail, Chickens, Rabbits, Capons, Veal, Lamb, or Mutton; any of theſe are very good, taken with moderation. And ſo are all field-Birds, which are uſed to be eaten, excepting thoſe which live upon the Water, as the Swan,Unfitting meats. Gooſe, Duck, Plover, Wigion, &c. Alſo generally the moſt kind of freſh-Water Fiſh may well be eaten of, except the Eel, the Tench,Meats forbidden. and the Salmon: Playce, Flounders, Whitings, Soles, Smelts, and ſuch like, are good, moderately taken; alſo Pearch, Roch, Stone, Gudgeons, Breames, Trouts. Freſh Beefe and Pork are excepted againſt; and I think it fit to avoid it, where there is no want of other things. But on the contrary, where there is ſcarcity, let thy ability be thy guide; and in the Name of God, in want of others, let none be ſo unwiſe to refuſe Beef, nor the Broth or pottage thereof, for experience ſufficiently approveth them good; neither egges poached, nor ſoft ſodden; no, nor Bread and Butter, when their ſtomachs will bear it; for theſe all nouriſh well, very moderately taken.
                  And remember, that if your Patient begin to amend of his diſeaſe, and that his appetite grow, deny him not competent food in a ſparing manner, and let him have, as neer as may be, that which is of light digeſtion, and not too much at once, but give it him often.
                  For underſtand, that after once the maſſe of blood hath been corrupted, and that Nature, by Gods mercy, with the help of good meanes, hath again gotten the upper hand, the body will require good nouriſhment, and often to be ſupplyed.
                  The uſe of Verjuyce is very wholeſome in the diſeaſe with Meats, and alſo in Poſſets, where inward heat is, and thirſt withal, but not where cold is: and the uſe of Gooſe-berries, of unripe grapes, Preſerved Cherries, Prunes, ſowre Pomegranates, and the like, are very good, as is elſe-where mentioned; and no leſſe good is the uſe of Oranges, Lemons, Pome-Citrons, and Pomegranates.
               
               
                  
                  The cure of Angina Mendoſa, or a falſe Squinancy, being a ſpecies of a contagious touch, happening when the Plague reigneth.
                  Being a pain in the Neck, or lower parts of Gula, or of the Muſcles of the Neck and Throat, in which ſickneſſe there is generally ſmall or no External nor Internal appearance, although there ſometime is in both, and therefore is called Angina Mendoſa.
                  
                  
                     Phlebotomy needful. MAny begin the diſeaſe of the Plague with the aforeſaid complaint, for which one good remedy is Phlebotomy at the firſt, not under the tongue onely in that caſe; for that if you do it, ſufficeth not in ſo fierce a diſeaſe, but that you muſt alſo be forced to open a vein in the arm: Wherefore let the Surgeon, if he be urged thereunto, take the fulleſt vein of the arm of that ſide, which the pain or complaint inclineth moſt unto, but concerning general evacuation by Phlebotomy, in Peſtilential Feavours, never do it when any indication of a Criſis, by the diſeaſe appeareth, for fear of offence; and if ſo be that one ſide ſuffer not more then another, then take it on the right arm, and take a reaſonable good quantity of blood, namely fromThe quantity of blood to be taken. a man, 6 or 8 ounces, or ten ounces; not more, for fear of dejecting the ſpirits, and a leſſer proportion to a weaker Patient, and make a reaſonable large orifice, which in ſuch a caſe is beſt, and if after apparent need be, which ſeldome is, open the veines under the tongue: but howſoever I would begin with the arm.

Of the uſe of Phlebotomy in the aforeſaid diſeaſe, I have had experience oftentimes this yeere, and even upon my own Son, who being in a violent burning Feavour, with an Angina Mendoſa, and being very unwilling to be let blood under the tongue, firſt for fear of loſſe of time, I cauſed to give him a ſuppofitory; then after within 
                        •
                     three houres I gave him a Cordial Diaphoretick, Gr. 8. of Aurum vitae, which he did ſweat upon for three or almoſt four houres very plentifully, and was ſomewhat revived, and reaſonable chearful, nevertheleſſe he ſtill finding a great fulneſſe of blood, entreated me to open a vein for him in the Arm, the which I did, and took from him, as I conceived, ten ounces of blood, he being of a full able body, and about twenty yeeres of age, and without any more medicines, or time of complaint, by Gods mercy, he came to his perfect health again the ſecond day from the beginning of his deſeaſe.
                  And I may truly to Gods glory affirm, that in this yeere, 1638, I have cured very many of Feavours, with alſo complaints of ſwellings in their throats, meerly by that Diaphoretick of Gold, of my own practice, called Aurum vitae, and that with onely one doſe given, and no more, and the parties became thereby perfectly whole the very next day, without the taking any other Medicine, and by the ſame medicine, and onely by the once giving, I alſo have healed very many of the Plague in one day, whereof ſome had riſings of tumours, which by their once ſweating, ſpent without further care.
               
               
                  Outward Medicines for the aſſwaging of the pains of the Head, in the ſick of the Plague.

                  Of outward Medicines to be cured in the curing of the Symptomes of this Diſeaſe, to draw forward a Bubo, or Carbuncle.
                  
                     By living fowls. IN the beginning of the comming forth of a Bubo or Carbuncle, take a Cock, a Hen, a Pigeon, or a Chicken alive, pull it bare about the rumpe, and vent, then ſtrew a little ſalt thin upon the Botch, then bind the Birds legs and wings as eaſily as may be, and let her ſit thereon, I mean the Botch, until ſhe dye; then let her be buried, and take another, and uſe her as the former, untill three or four be killed thereon; and it hath been by experience found, that when all the venome is drawn out, the laſt bird will live, if it be not hurt by plucking or binding; which done, then apply ſome attractive remedie to

draw it forward; in which cupping▪glaſſes, with and without ſcarification, as occaſion ſhall require, are convenient and good to bring forward a Bubo.
                  
                  
                     By Horſe-leeches And Horſe-leeches are alſo very good to be ſet on the place; and if the Leeches will take, it is a good ſign of health: for which purpoſe, if you wet the Botch with a little fair water and Sugar warmed, and ſomewhat wiped off again, they will take the better.
                  
                     By Pigeons dung prepared. Alſo Pigeons dung warmed, and made into a Cataplaſme or Poultis, with a little Swines Fat and Turpentine mixed, and very warm applyed twice a day, or Hens dung in the like manner prepared, are very good attractive Medicines, in that diſeaſe.
                  
                     By live Fiſhes applyed. 
                     Paracelſus much commendeth the application of any like Fiſh to a Bubo, for the drawing out the venom, the Fiſh being living, then ſuddenly ſlit open, and put to the Bubo, where it may be had, as namely, either a Tench, a Carpe, Pike, Roche, or Peach, three or four Fiſhes one after another, each kept three or four hours on the place; and afterwards ſome good attractive Cataplaſme applyed thereunto, as namely, one of the hearb Scabious.
                  
                     A good Emplaſter for the firſt, to ripen and to break a Bubo.

                     Another more forcible drawing Medicine, to draw out a Bubo or Carbuncle.
                     TAke the hearb Crowes-foot, made into a Cataplaſme or Poultis, onely by bruſing it very ſoft with a Peſtle in a Clout, and applying it, it is ſingular good to draw it forward; but it will draw forceably, and bliſter the skin: Alſo Muſtard-ſeed and Pigeons dung well beaten together, with a little Swines fat mixed, and very warm applyed, do vehemently heat and attract forward a Botch or Carbuncle.
                  
                  
                     A Cataplaſme for a Carbuncle, very milde, Anodine, and very effectual.
                     
                        Receit of Cataplaſmes. TAke Plantane leaves, or roots in want of leaves, a good quantity, ſhred them very ſmall, then bruiſe them very well, and ſtrain out the juice, and with crums of houſehold leavened Bread, boyled in the

aforeſaid juice, or in the juice of Sorrel, is as good; make a Cataplaſme thereof, adding in the boyling ſome Barrowes greaſe, and apply it very warm to the place, and ſhift it three or four times a day, it ſwageth mightily the pain, and draweth unto it and yet evaporateth the venome mightily: and the ſame doth the juice of Scabious done, or the herbe Scabious ſtamped and boyled in new milk with crums of Bread. Provided alwayes, that in the making up thereof, or of any ſuppurating Cataplaſme, you forget not to put ſome fatneſſe to it, as Oyl of Lillies, Camomile, or roſes, or at the leaſt Butter or Swines fat for a need: any one of theſe are good, and may ſerve; but the firſt is beſt, and ſo the next: and be ever ſure to apply all Poulteſes very warm.

OF the greater Comfrey hacked and beaten and boyled in Milk, with crums of Bread, to a Cataplaſme; then add a little Butter and a few Pruines boyled therein, taking out their ſtones: the which Medicine doth ſpeedily digeſt and ſuppurate a Bubo.

                        Rec. A Great Onion, and having made a hole in the top thereof, and part of the Onion taken out and filled with Mithridate, or Treacle, and roſted in embers, let it be very warm applyed to the Botch, and uſe it in form of a Cataplaſme, it is a very exceellent Anodine, ſwaging great pain, and proper for the diſeaſe, to draw forth the venemous humours, as alſo utterly to quench the maligne power thereof.
                     I will here conclude touching outward applications in the cure of the Plague, having at large elſewhere often recited, that concerning allThe concluſion of the Treatiſe. the accidents pertaining to that noyſome diſeaſe of the Plague, as Buboes, Carbuncles, and Blains, that the Peſtilential Fever being once removed, all thoſe ſymptomes do heal far ſooner then any other Boyles or Sores do: for the effecting whereof, the Reader hath in this Treatiſe many good ſoveraign Medicines, diverſe of them of the Author his own long experience, whereon the Surgeon may rely, if God pleaſe to be merciful to the Patient, in adding his bleſſing to them: to the which end, let the Surgeon and the ſick joyntly together, and each for himſelf, call upon God for a bleſſing upon the means, and doubtleſſe he will hear, and have mercy: for in truth,

                           Ni Deus addiderit vireſque infunderet herbis,
                           Quid prodefl ditamus vel panacea juvat?
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                  The Epilogue, or Concluſive part of this Treatiſe: Wherein the Author relateth, of his own ſufficient experience, yet one Antidote more, for the whole Cure of the Plague; being a Cordial Pouder made of Gold, and by him called Aurum vitae; whereon, by Gods mercy, the Patient may rely, as upon a ſafe Antidote.
                  
                  A Cordiall Antidote, called Aurum vitae.
                  
                  THis Medicine, at one onely time given, taketh away the Peſtilentiall Feaver, and thereby cureth the Plague, that the Patient is oftentimes well the next day, it being given upon the firſt day of the Patients complaint, with the obſervation of certain eaſie rules hereafter preſcribed, concerning the order of adminiſtring thereof, and it is an eaſie and ſafe Medicine, inſomuch that any infant, although it ſuck upon the mothers breaſts, may ſafely take it, yea, and eaſily may be induced to receive it into the body, for that it is of a very ſmall Doſe, and is without any offence in taſte or ſmell to any: alſo, it may ſafely be given to any woman that is great with childe, whereof divers trials have been had, with ſafetie and comfort.
                  
                     The Doſe of Aurum vitae.
                      The doſe or quantitie ſufficient thereof for a man or woman to take at any one time, is but eight grains; and by that proportion, any diſcreet perſon may gather what may be given to any younger perſon: viz. A childe of two full yeares old, may ſafely take two grains; and a child at foure or five years old, may take three grains; and one about eight years old, may take foure grains; one of foureteen years, or thereabouts, may take fixe grains; and one of eighteen, nineteen, twentie years old, or more, may ſafely take the full of eight grains.
                  
                     The effects of it. And note, that this Medicine performeth its operation onely by Sweat, which is the trueſt and ſafeſt way of the enterance upon that Cure (for the moſt part) and alſo it doth it without any moving the body either upwards or downwards; namely, it cauſeth no Vomits nor Stooles, neither is it at all nauſeous to the ſtomach, nor any wayes cauſing extraordinary thirſt nor faintneſſe, as ſome, yea, and moſt of other Minerall Diaphoreticks doe: But, on the contrarie, the Patient, when his ſweating is over, ſhall manifeſtly feele cherefulneſſe, as being much refreſhed thereby, with alſo an abatemant of his pains, and his Feaver will utterly be gone at the onely once taking thereof.
                  
                     
                     The order in adminiſtring of Aurum vitae.
                      Neither ſhall the Patient need to be over-burthened with too many Clothes, to force him or her to ſweat, for the Medicine of it ſelf ſufficiently performeth that duty; onely he may be ordered to have ſomewhat more to cover him, then the ordinary Coverings he uſually lyeth under; and the Room likewiſe ought to be kept very warm, with a good fire therein, for that cold aire in time of ſweating is obnoxtious and dangerous.
                  
                     Of the continuance of its vertue. And further, this Medicine may be kept ſeven whole years, and longer, if be; for it being truly prepared of Gold, is permanent above other medicines, and it loſeth not his vertue as vegetable Medicines do: but as Gold, that moſt excellent Mineral, excelleth all other Minerals in price and true value; even ſo doth the truely prepared Medicines thereof as far exceed all other Mineral Medicines in their vertues, as well in the preſerving and defending mans body from diſeaſes, as alſo in curing their infirmities, when by Gods permiſſion they ſeize upon the bodies of men.
                  And whereas other Mineral Diaphoreticks commonly work two wayes at once, namely, both by Sweat, and alſo by Vomit, whereby they firecely diſtract the Patient, and produce fearful ſymptomes, as if Death it ſelf were at hand, by the oppreſſing Nature in too violent expulſions at one time; yea, often times by a third, viz, by purging alſo downward. But this moſt truly ſafe and eaſie ſweating

Medicine performeth as much as it promiſeth pleaſantly and without rigour, or nauſeous offence, as well in the Plague, as alſo in other contagious diſeaſes, where Nature ſtriveth to thruſt out her venemous enemy per poras cutis, or by the ſweatholes; and that courſe of curing, is of all other the ſafeſt, in a contagious diſeaſe, at the firſt entrance, which then conſiſteth rather of poyſonous vapours, then of putrifaction of humours; in which regard, the aforeſaid courſe is ſafeſt: for it is a fearful courſe, yea, and a deſperate one, to purge in the beginning of this moſt contagious diſeaſe.
                  
                     For Agues or Fevers that are contagious▪
                      This Medicine is alſo approved good to be given in the beginning of any contagious Ague or Fever, hot or cold; and for the moſt part, it cureth it at once giving, whether it appear to be Tertian, Quartane, Quotidian, or intermittent Ague.
                  
                     The courſe to be held in the taking of this Antidote.
                     FIrſt, the Patient is to be demanded, if he had any ſtool that day,Nam mora trahit periculum. or the day before, and if yea, all is well, if otherwiſe, let him have onely a Suppoſitory, that may move him once: and when he hath had one ſtool thereby, proceed without any delay to the adminiſtring of the Antidote, for delayes are dangerous. Wherefore, without any further protraction of time, goe on to take the antidote.
                     
                        
And the party that taketh it ought to lye in his warm bed, fitted with ſufficient coverings, before he take it in, then let him take his medicine, either mixed with ſome cordial thing, as a little Mithridate, ture Treacle, conſerve of Roſes, or Quinces, or give it onely mixed with the pap of an apple, and ſo it is eaſieſt taken in by infants, as I ſuppoſe, for it needs no addition at all, to add vertue to it, onely the addition chiefly ſerves, as a vehicle to carry the Medicine without waſting into the ſtomack, for that it is a powder ſmall in quantity, and therefore ſubject to be waſted in taking.
                     
                        Neceſſaries to be provided before the taking Alſo the party that is to take it, muſt have ready made before hand, an ordinary poſſet drink, of Ale and milk, to the quantity of a quart, very warm, and when he hath taken in his medicine, ſhortly after let him drink a reaſonable full draught of his poſſet, well warmed, and then lying on the one ſide, let him be warm covered head, face and all, leaving full breathing ſcope, and ſo in Gods name let him lye ſtill, and ſweat gently, if he can bear it 3 or 4 hours, were beſt, and ever as he thriſteth, let him freely take warm poſſet drink, which were beſt to be given him in ſome Cruet, or ſpout pot, that he take no aire, raiſing himſelf up in drinking, and when he hath performed his due ſweating, let him be wiped dry, and ſhifted, aud then give the patient ſome warm broth.
                     And the next day he may by Gods mercy ſafely, as for himſelf, go abroad, but for the day of his ſweating, let him keep within, and give him food competent, in a ſparing quantity, ſuch as is of a light digeſtion: and deny him not drink, ſo that it be ſomwhat warm at the fire.
                     Thus much for thoſe which take the medicine within 24 hours of the firſt conplaint.
                     
                        Item, unto ſuch as the diſeaſe hath taken greater hold of, namely that before the receipt of the aforeſaid medicine or Antidote, the patient have outward tumors, as Botches, Carbuncles, or Blains not yet broken, nor ripe, if he take the medicine as aforeſaid, and ſweat well upon it, the venome of the ſores, ſhall through Gods mercy, be ſo evaporated by his ſweating, that they ſhall decline of themſelves, and not at all come forward, and if any after do break, as being formerly ſuppurated, before the medicine took place, they ſhall as ordinary boyles, eaſily and quickly heal, with every mean medicine.
                     
                        Of two or three times taking if the diſeaſe require. And notwithſtanding, generally, one ſweating ſerveth, yet nevertheleſſe, if occaſion be, the patient may ſafely take a ſecond doſe, or proportion, yea and a third without danger, as diverſe have done; and ſo he may be the more confident of anſwerable ſucceſſe, namely, of the full and ſafe recovery of his perfect health, by Gods mercy: nevertheleſſe, if he find his deſire by the firſt, of reaſonable health, let him not take a ſecond, and if by a ſecond, not a third.
                     
                        
When any perſon, deſirous to take the benefit of the aforeſaid medicine, having an Ague, or Fever, with paroxiſmes or fits, let him not take the medicine in the time of the fit, but one full hour before the fit, and rathermore, but if the Fever be continual, give it at any time in manner aforeſaid, although the patient be in diſtemper, and burning, for if he take it, and his burning change into ſweating, which the vertue of this Medicine uſually produceth, the fear of death in the Patient, is half over.
                     And further of a truth I can affirm, that I have cured ſome by this laſt mentioned antidote, that had the peſtilence, or ſpots of the Plague, vulgarly called Gods Tokens upon them, and are yet living witneſſes.
                     And whereas our bleſſed Saviour, as appeareth in the Holy Scriptures, by a Parable declareth, that a certain man gave to ſundry of his ſervants, Talents to trade or occupy with, to one more, to another leſſe, and afterwards (as He might juſtly do) He exacted an account from each of them, highly blaming that ſervant who had not profited his Maſter by his Talent, but had hid it in the ground.
                     Alſo, in another place He ſheweth his diſlike of lighting a Candle and puting it under a buſhel, adviſing us rather to put it on a Candleſtick, that it may give light to others.
                     And further, we are commanded not to forget to do good, and to diſtribute, and that whileſt we have time.
                     All which precepts, together conſidered, I eſteemed it my duty (as commanded) to imploy my ſhort talent of healing, which God hath lent me, to the utmoſt for his Glory, and the good of others; and for that reaſon, as in part I have thought fit here following to publiſh by teſtimony, what good the aforeſaid antidote hath done already, onely in Weſtminſter and Northampton, not accounting at all whom without teſtimony it hath healed, which hath bin very many, more then by teſtimony is fitting for me to produce.

that fearful Diſeaſe, all which Perſons recovered, and not one of all them that hath taken the ſaid Pills, dyed, (thanks be given to Almighty God) neither can we do leſſe, then publiſh the great skill, judgment, and charity of the ſaid Iohn Woodall, by whoſe induſtry and care, this Antidote hath wrought ſo good effect, and did beſtow them freely, without one penny of recompence for the ſame.

                        Good Sir,
                     
                     WHereas about the beginning of July laſt, when our Town of Northampton was much viſited with the Sickneſſe, you ſent me a Cordial Powder, of eight Grains to the Doſe, for the Cure of the Plague, deſiring from me an account of the operation thereof; I thought fit to ſignifie unto you, that I have found it exceeding good for the ſaid Diſeaſe, farre above my expectation, having adminiſtred the ſaid Powder to the parties hereunder named, and divers others, too long to recite.
                     And firſt, I gave it to one Symonds ſon, a Plummer, who was dangerouſly ſick of the Plague, and by once taking of that powder, was perfectly cured.
                     His Mother preſently after falling ſick of the Plague, and in great danger, was cured by taking it twice.
                     Likewiſe to one Brownes daughter, her Father and Mother being dead of the Plague, and ſhe her ſelf dangerouſly ſick, and prayed for in the Church, who by once taking of it was perfectly cured.
                     Alſo one Widow Allets Maid, her daughter being dead before of the Plague, and the Maid dangerouſly ſick, by the taking of one Pill was cured and well the very next day.
                     Alſo I gave one Pill to a Boy of James Fairnes, and it cured him.
                     Likewiſe, I gave one Pill to one Good-Wife Jackſon, a very old woman, and ſhe was cured therewith.
                     Likewiſe, to one Brownes Wife I gave a Pill, and ſhe was cured therewith.
                     
                        
Likewiſe, to a Child of one Taubots I gave a Pill, and he was cured therewith.
                     Likewiſe, I gave a Pill to one Miſtris Huickſmans daughter, and ſhe was well cured thereby.
                     And to a Maid of M. Hills, who had a putrid Feavour, and was cured thereby.
                     Likewiſe, to one Miſtris Coopers ſon I gave one Pill, who was cured of the Plague thereby the very next day.
                     Likewiſe, to M. Smiths daughter, being very ſick of the Plague twice, and was twice made well the next day following.
                     Likewiſe, to one Spooners daughter, being ſick of the Plague, and ſhe was made well the next day.
                     And to a Child of one Packwoods I gave a Pill, being ſick of a putrid Feavour, who voided Worms of above half a yard long, and was cured.
                     To one Goody Smith, a Maulſters Wife, I gave two Pills, ſhe being very ſick of the Plague; by the firſt, ſhe had a Swelling appeared; and the next day I gave her another of the ſame Pills, which provoked her again to ſweat, whereupon the Swelling vaniſht away, and ſhe became thereby perfectly cured.
                     I could recite divers other Cures in like manner by your Powder performed, but for troubling you with tedious repetitions: Wherefore I will thus conclude in the commendations thereof; that I adminiſtred it unto many, and of all thoſe I gave it unto, that either had the Plague, or any contagious or putrid Feavours, it cured them, and none that took it dyed under my Cure,
                     
                        Yours to be commanded, William Wyly.

                      his laſt Edition mentioned; the Author deſires to be excuſed for his omiſsion therein, for that ſince that firſt Edition there hath been, by Authority of his Majeſtie, a publike Diſpenſatory put forth, called Pharmacopeia Londinenſis, containing all ſuch Medicines as the learned Doctors of the Colledge have ſelected, as fitteſt for their practiſes in London: in which learned Work, moſt of the Medicines by me in this Treatiſe mentioned, are to be found very truly and exactly ſet down the Compoſitions of them; to which, he is now, as neceſsitated, forced to refer the Reader: and yet in this Treatiſe the Author hath preſumed to explain divers good Receipts. But the Work being on the ſudden to ſay, (aut nunc aut nunquam) haſted to the Preſſe, there could be no alteration admitted, neither time for addition. But nevertheleſſe, for the preſcribed Antidote, called Aurum Vitae, the Authour will be ready, whilest God permits him life, and as alſo he hopeth that his Poſterity after him will not fail to prepare and have ready the ſaid Antidote, for any perſon that ſhall pleaſe to make uſe of it, ready prepared, put up, and ſealed, at ſuch reaſonable rates, as no private man can afford to make it ſo cheap, although he knew the Work: and ſo he taketh leave, committing the Benevolent Reader to Gods protection.

                     Courteous Reader,
                  
                  
                     HAving in part ingaged my ſelf by promiſe to my good Friends, before the Edition of this my work, to explain to the World, amongst other parts of Surgery, the manner of Amputating or cutting off, of putrid members, in the mortified part: I after conſidered with my ſelf, that I could not properly proceed therein, except by the defining of a Gangrene, in the firſt place, becauſe a Gangrene is ever the fore runner of a Sphacelus, and the material cauſe of Amputation, either in the general body of Man, or in any the particular parts thereof, and from the which, no Animal creature, no not Man himſelf can decline from.
                  Ab initio ſtatutum eſt omnibus ſemel mori.
                  For from the beginning, all men are constituted once to dye, and yet there is an interim for each man, of not being in health, neither really dead, but quafi moriens, vel ſemi mortuus, dying, or half dying. In the which i

It may proceed either from great hemorrage mentioned, that is, exceeding effuſion of blood and ſpirits, or by a diſtemper of the four humours, proceeding either by

                     The third Definition of Gangrena. A Gangrene is a partial mortification of a member, commonly by reaſon of a phlegmon, it may be ſaid to be partial in that the part affected, ſo long as the member is not throughly dead, but hath in it ſelf ſtill a ſenſe and feeling of pain, and therefore not altogether deſperate, although yet it be tending to mortification, and ſo unleſſe there be ſome ſudden help in the ſtaying thereof, it will ſoon turn to a total and perfect mortification, after which it may no more be tearmed a Gangrene, but is called of the Grecians (Sphacelus) 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , becauſe of the extinction ofSphacelus. the natural heat therein, and of the Latines it is called (Sideratio)
                     Sideratio. a totall and perfect putrefaction, and moreover of the later Writers (Esthiomenon) in that it is ſo ſudden piercing and penetrating untoEſthiomenon. the bone, and doth as it were overcome the whole man, ſo as again it may be concluded, that the difference between a Gangrene and Sphacelus, as is ſaid, is; a Gangrene is truly tearmed an unperfectDif. in Gang. & Sphacel. mortification in the fleſhy parts onely, but Sphacelus is a perfect and total privation of ſenſe, being a mortification,

not only of the fleſhy parts, but alſo of the nervous parts, even unto the very bone, yea, and of the bone it ſelf alſo. The cauſes of a Gangrene
                     Cauſx Gangr. by ſome learned Writers are reduced to three; the firſt, is when as a member cannot receive the vital ſpirits proper or natural due to it from the heart by the Arteries, by reaſon of a diſſolution in the mixture or harmony of the member, cauſed externally by extreame frigidity, as ſometimes it chanceth to be in a very cold and ſharp Winter, alſo by the inconſiderate and too too immoderate and raſh refrigeration of a Phlegmon, as alſo extreame calidity, as by ſcalding Liquor, or through ſome poyſonous diſpoſition in nature, inveſted in the parts affected, all or any of which do or may ſufficiently extinguiſh the natural heat thereof; if wholeſome remedies in time be not applyed, a Gangrene may juſtly be expected to follow.
                  Another cauſe is, when as the vitall ſpirits in any member are obſtructed, ſuffocated, and finally extinguiſhed, by reaſon of ſome obdurate, ſchirrous hardneſſe and conſtipation of the Veines, arteries or pores of the skin, as in venemous or peſtilential Apoſtumes or Carbuncles is often ſeen, ſo that little or none of the venemous matter conteined in the Apoſtume or venemous tumour, can be digeſted or receive diſcuſſion, nor be brought to ſuppuration by apt Medicines, whereby Nature being above her ſtrength oppreſſed, and Art not ſufficiently ſuccouring, a Gangrene is produced.
                  Another cauſe may be by extreame ſtrong ligature, through the indiſcretion of unworthily termed Artiſts, or of unexpert Artiſts, as too often is manifeſt, and ſometimes by compreſſions, or other interceptions of blood or ſpirits, by which the vital ſpirits ſhould be tranſported to the member grieved.
                  The ſignes of a Gangrene, are theſe; an extinction of the livelySign of Gangr. colour which was in the precedent Phlegmon, grievous pain and continual pulſation in the diſeaſed part, apparent by the Arteries, being at the firſt very ſenſible, but afterwards declining their due force, the part agrieved ſeeming for the moſt part, in colour to be blackiſh, blewiſh, or of a duskie or livid colour, yea, ſometime putrid, and being opened, a filthy Ichor and of an unſavoury ſmell proceeding from it. Thus much of the ſigns.

                     Phlebotomy uſefull. And if you perceive further occaſion, you may reiterate the uſe of any of them: and further, you may not omit the uſe of Phlebotomy, ſcarrification and application of Ventoſes, Leeches or Veſicatories upon or nigh the part affected, and according to the Patient his ſtrength, let him blood moderately: and obſerve, that in ſcarrification regard is to be had, concerning the gangrenated part, whether it penetrate or be ſuperficial, and ſo accordingly is ſcarrification to be uſed: as for the application of Leeches, it may be done upon any part thereto adjoyning, or upon the part affected it ſelf: and further note, that if a Gangrene follow a contuſion, for the moſt part it proceeds either by the vehemency of the contuſion, whereby eruption of the capillar veins, yea, and the larger veins alſo, blood is forced into the Muſcles confuſedly, as by the Echymoſis may appear of the evil diſpoſition of the Patient; or it may alſo proceed for want of a Surgeon to apply fit and artificial applications in due time: not ſeldome, under favour, by overhard ligature.
                  But if the Gangrene appear to have proceeded by inanition, that caſe is pitiful, and the cure very doubtful; but nevertheleſſe, where it ſo falleth out, all nutritive and comfortative remedies are to be appointed, as namely, if it proceed of cold either in froſt, or by want of due and ſufficient food, conſideration is to be had by adding warmth of food and rayment, with cordial and comfortive remedies: alſo the Artiſt muſt truly inform himſelf, whether this diſeaſe be a Gangrene, or a Sphacelus, whether a partial or a total privation and mortification, with the utter loſſe of the ſenſe of the fleſhy and nervous parts; and if he find ſenſe in the parts, there is life and hope.
                  
                     Rulis to be obſerved if the Gangrene is cauſed by venomous diſeaſes. But ſuppoſe a Gangrene proceeds of a venomous cauſe, as many times it doth, and namely, in time of contagion, as of Carbuncles in the Plague, the ſmall Pox, or by other malignant Feavers, when as the Artiſt may neither purge his Patient, nor open a vein ſafely, but with

fear, except he may be well warranted, either by good and grave advice of the expert, where ſuch may be had; in want of which, the Artiſt ought to ſearch by authority of the moſt ancient Writers, that he can come at, for the avoiding of the eminent danger of death, to enſue upon his Patient, and to go warily in the want of better advice:What to be obſerved if it be cauſed by fulneſſ

                     viz. If the grief proceed of fulneſſe, which ſeldome it doth at Sea, or in Camps, then his firſt rule in Art muſt be, as is ſaid, that a thin dyet and cooling be preſcribed his Patient, and that he be admitted no wine nor ſtrong drink: alſo that he may be appointed ſome cooling Julep to be made him, namely, if the Patient be in Ship or Camp, he is there confined and conſtrained to the Surgeons Cheſt, and then let the Surgeon examine his proviſions; and if he find he have any cooling waters and Syrups fitting thereunto, he may proceed to take as followeth:

                  A Definition of Sphacelus, and the cure thereof from ſome ancient Writers, to ſhew the Reader their opinions and judgments thereof, for that ſome Artists have grounded their judgments, that their relations are according to good practice; and therefore are to be imitated.
                  A Sphacelus, ſaith Falopius, and likewiſe Fabritius, is an affect of a part already utterly mortified, and therefore not to be cured but by amputation, that the whole body come not to corruption thereby,Extremum genus morbi requirit extrema remedia. and this abſciſſion is not done without great danger of death: for often, even in the inſtant act of amputation, the Patient dyeth by the profuſion of blood and ſpirits, wherefore the ſtrength of the ſick is to be conſidered: and Cornelius Celſus alledgeth, Cap. 25.The opinion of Celſus concerning Sphacelus.
                      lib. 5. that in his time they uſed to take off the Sphacelated member, by cutting the fleſh round about unto the bone, in the whole part, near the rotten or ſphacelated part, and cutting ever in the live fleſh, not leaving any of the mortified fleſh untaken away; further Celſus (ſayAnother way of amputation. they) doth admoniſh us in this work, that the skin and alſo the fleſh, be brought and drawn upwards, that the bone may be the better covered by ſome of the ſaid part, in the healing of the ſtump; but the ſame Authour confeſſeth alſo, that by ſuch abſciſſion cauſing exceeding pain, with over-large effuſion of blood and ſpirits, death uſually followeth: therefore to avoid hemorrage, they muſt preſently uſe actual Cauteries to burn the parts adjacent, in which may be conjectured, how cruel that courſe is to the Patient, and uncomfortable; and prepare the upper part thick enough, to be a firm cover to the veſſels.
                  But after himſelf not approving that courſe, he ſaith, that he took another way of curing, which as he ſaid, happily ſucceeded; by which work no profuſion of blood hapned, becauſe no blood floweth from a mortified part, neither is grief moved therein; but leſt the corruption ſhould ſpread it ſelf further, (ſaith the ſaid Authour) I burned the putrefied part, remaining every where with red-hot Irons, that were heavy and well burnt, untill the Patient did feel the heat of the fire, and that he ſuffered ſome ſmall pain; and the rather they did it, they write, becauſe the ſame operation is very profitable, and therefore burned ever ſome of the ſound fleſh alſo, becauſe the putrefaction is beſt to be drawn out by a red-hot Iron, as I ſuppoſe, ſaith he, which is apparent to the eye, for the humours are apparently ſeen to boyl about the Iron; and likewiſe the weakneſſe of the parts conſidered by burning, it is fortified, the adjacent parts being freed from many noxious humours thereby, ſo that the weak part receiveth ſtrength, and within a few dayes begins to ſeparate the living from the dead part, and

ſo afterwards the dead part falls off, and the living part is conſerved. And this manner in my judgment, ſaith Fabritius, is beſt; but this Authour conceiveth Fabritius to be but a relater, not a true practiſer of the aforeſaid courſe in amputation, for that that work is ſo terrible and cruel nevertheleſſe.

                  An Introduction to amputation, but chiefly for the mortified place.
                  LOving Reader, the general opinion of the moſt ancient, as alſo of the modern Writers, yea, and of the beſt Artiſts with us, at this preſent living, as farre as I can gather or conceive, is, that the fafeſt and beſt way for the cure of ſphacelated or putrid dead members, is to amputate them in the ſound part, and not in the putrid; and their general reaſons are, to prevent that none of the putrid, venemous or gangrenated blood, or ſpirits ſhould remain untaken away,Enſe recidendum eſt, ne pars ſincera trahatur. for fear it ſhould infect the ſound, and ſo conſequently confound the whole maſſe of the blood and ſpirits, and to conclude, kill the whole body; but the horrid pain the patient thereby ſuſteineth, with alſo the great uncertainty of his life, after his extream ſufferings, cauſed me ever to miſlike my own works therein, yea, although the ſucceſſe, for the moſt part, was anſwerable to my deſire.
                  And I further confeſſe, tradition tooke place with me in the Hoſpital of S. Bartholomews, in part, where I was, as is ſaid, a Surgeon, for many years, yea, and that in my whole practice there, as alſo with the reſt of the Surgeons, my partners, untill after, reading ſomeFruſtrà fit per plura, quod fieri poteſt per pauciora. ancient Authors, I conceived; that I might in ſome caſes ſave a mans life, by amputating in the ſphacelated part: notwith ſtanding the general vate and tenent aforeſaid, to the contrary; whereupon by accident, about the year 1617. having a fit Patient, which had a mortified leg, and was as feeble and weak, as poſſible a living creature might, be inſomuch I was of opinion, upon the firſt view of him, that Natures third was at hand ſpun out in him, ſo that it was even ſinne and pitty for me to hinder natures courſe, or to ſhorten her courſe, in haſting it with violent Art, and namely by diſmembring him in the whole part, who had not blood and ſpirits in ſuch a caſe, according to the word, to keep life and ſoul together, but by conſequent, he muſt dye in the very act; and therefore I confeſſe, I intended the Patient ſhould dye by Nature, rather then to be killed by Art, ever eſteeming it a great ſin to take away a limb from any creature, but with ſome good hope thereby to preſerve his life: But again conſidering Chriſtian duty, and that I was tyed to do my beſt, to preſerve life, to the utmoſt in my power, I conceived there might be peradventure yet ſome ſmall hope of life, if I could without pain to the weak Patient, or loſſe of blood, ridde away his rotten member; ſo I in ſhort concluded to take it off in the dead place, which as all men may conceive, I without pain quickly effected, and by Gods mercy, the next day, I found

that my poor Patient, after the loathſome ſtinck of his putrid limb was removed from him, he began to chear up, and ſo after, from day to day was refreſhed more and more, and nature as it were rejoyced, even as a tree refreſheth after the dead boughs are pruned off, ſo my poor Patient grew more and more luſty and chearful; and to conclude, in the ſpace of 10. weekes, he was perfectly healed, and being then ſound and luſty, gave thanks to the Governour of the Hoſpital, in full payment of his cure, and ſo departed from the Hoſpital upon a leg of wood, he then being fair and fat, and very formal; the which bleſſing of health to the poor man, and light of knowledge, by that experience to me, did put me in mind of my duty in juſt thankfulneſſe to God, and alſo it animated me further to proceed in the like practice upon many others, which ſince that time, I have with good ſucceſſe, to Gods glory, in the ſame manner well healed; I then alſo began with my ſelf to conſider, and as it were to queſtion the reaſon, why this latter Age of ours, conſiſting of more pregnant wits then former Ages, and that by good reaſon their judgments ſhould in Art farre exceed the former, as having had the experience, light, knowledge, and examples from all the precedent Ages; I ſay, I wondred they ſhould ſo clean have loſt, or omitted and paſſed by ſo worthy a work of practice as the aforeſaid was, it being of ſuch good conſequence in a Common-wealth, and to let dye in oblivion, yea, and not only ſo, but alſo to brand it with pittiful inhibitions, and conjectured ſlanders, and unfeaſableneſſe, for I cannot ſee how any man can juſtly averre a rule, to be ſo punctual, or ſo generally abſolute, that it may admit no exception, for even this ſo ancient and great a rule, I hope the Reader will acknowledge is confuted, or anon will fully be by apparent practice, and common experience, (as namely) one way, if the Reader do but call to mind the workes of Gale, a late worthy Writer, he may find that he affirmes, and by ſound arguments well maintaines, that wounds made by Gun-ſhot were not venemous, as divers ancient Writers formerly had affirmed; and if ſo, how ſtands it then, that the amputation of ſphacelated members, proceeding by Wounds made with Gun-ſhot, not venemous, that the amputation of ſuch performed in the wounded or mortified parts, ſhould of themſelves be ſo poyſonous or venemous, that the whole body ſhould ſuffer thereby? but I ſuppoſe one ſhould affirm it were ſo, yet the contrary by true, and yet viſible practice, is apparent, and to be proved, yea, and further by good practice, amputation in the mortified part, is experienced to be good practice in more venemous caſes, then inFor example. Gun-ſhot: for my ſelf diſmembred a young man of a leg, in the putrid part, the mortification proceeding by a violent peſtilential Feavour, which many juſtly deemed to be venemous, far beyond a wound made by Gun-ſhot, yea, even venemous in the higheſt degree, and yet that legge being ſo taken off, the venemous diſpoſition thereof did ceaſe, and did not offend at all, but the Patient was quickly healed, and if the caſe be cleared by experience, that the venome from a mortified member, in the Plague; returneth not to hurt the Body, though

ſuch a member be abſciſſed in the mortified part, in caſe of the Plague, how then can it well ſtand, that the aforeſaid general rule holds true,
Enſe recidendum eſt, ne pars ſincera trahatur?
                  
                  And yet further I deſire to inſtance to the Reader, a caſe that will, as I conceive, ſatisfie him fully; but if not all men, yet at the leaſt, every underſtanding Artiſt, that mortified fleſh left on upon amputation, or otherwiſe let remain, without amputating, untill nature being ſtrong of her ſelf, have caſt it off, doth no way indanger the life ofMortified fleſh not preſently h

                  And I my ſelf may truly ſay, have from more then a hundred perſons, cut off from ſome a legge, yea, both the legges, a hand, a foot, a toe or toes, an arm, a finger, &c. of ſuch rotten members, being all diſmembred in the rotten part, of which not one hath dyed in the cure, neither hath the mortification ſpread it ſelf any further at all, many of which, if occaſion were, I could produce, at this time of penning this relation, I dare affirm twenty for living witneſſes, and alſo I have had ſometimes old folkes, and young children, which onely by weakneſſe, and for want of food competent, deficiency in nature, as aforeſaid, their limbs have gangrenated, and ſome of theſe, if no help had bin at hand, would have fallen off, yea, and of ſome my ſelf have pinched off fingers, and ſawed aſunder the greater bones, when all the fleſh was by nature ſeparated, rotted, and fallen away of it ſelf, and yet that rotten, ſtincking, or cadaverous part, did no way infect the ſound, otherwiſe then by the ſtinck, and the truth hereof each Artiſt in practice may not deny, and can fairly witneſſe; then if granted, away with the conjectural ſuppoſition, that the ſphacelated part hath any property active, or faculty in it ſelf, to corrupt otherwiſe then each other cadaverous thing hath, namely, by his Fetour, in want of being removed, it may noyſomly be offenſive, but not to the height, as to kill the Patient: And yet I will believe per contra, that neither the one nor the other way of amputation, no not with all the art of man can ſave from the grave, by any amputation in

ſome caſes, which, although by all men muſt be granted, yet the practice of amputating in the putrid part muſt be held good: as for example, which I trouble your patience with, about 14. yeares paſt, there was a Miniſter, named M. Poston, a Reader in the Chappel ofFor example. 
                     Suttons Hoſpital, in London, who had a corn upon one of his little toes, that troubled him, he being otherwiſe at that time in perfect health, and himſelf at evening going to bed, pared the ſaid corn with his penknife, that it bled a little, as he himſelf ſaid, but within a few houres after, his toe pained him very much, and grew to be inflamed; in the morning his foot was wholly diſcoloured, and gangrenated, and the Patient, with the violent fiercencſſe of a ſudden Feaver, by the pain then upon him, was wholly diſtracted, and in a delirium, which continued till the next day at night, and then he dyed: and this man was immediately before that accident, a man in perfect health, and of an extraordinary great ſtrength of body, yea, and wanted not the learned advice of the Phyſician; onely he had a full corpulent body, and was a very large feeder; ſo that to ſuch a patient, ſo fiercely viſited, I cannot conceive how any amputation, of what ſort ſoever, could have ſuccoured to have ſaved his life, for that in my opinion, the whole maſſe of the blood and ſpirits, were tainted and ſubjugated by an exceeding fear, before help could take place: many other reaſons I have elſewhere inſtanced of impoſſibilities, or unfitneſſe in my judgement to injoyn any Artiſt to obſerve any one particular way, courſe or order of amputation, for that the occaſions of the Gangrenes, ſo much do differ, onely as elſewhere is recited for the facility thereof, and for the ſaving of blood and ſpirits, I have thought fit to commend to your conſideration this new method, as to the diſcretion of the Artiſt ſhall be eſteemed fit.
                  Alſo I have obſerved, that in ſurfeited delicate bodies of great perſonages, ſuch as are over-pomper'd with pleaſure, eaſe, and fulneſſe, if by any way or accidents ſuch happen to have a Gangrene, ſeldome one of them eſcapeth death, eſpecially if they be ancient, and have the dropſie, or Scorbute, and on the contrary, amongſt thoſe which are weak, poor, indigent and miſerable people, which have bin by long continued ulcers, fiſtulaes, or other grievous maladies ſpent to extream weakneſſe, although ſeeming half dead before the work begin, ſcarce two of ten dye amongſt them, upon amputation, if the work be judiciouſly, and in a fit way and time performed; for I by practice have often obſerved, that where an infirmity hath pulled down a Patient low, and almoſt paſt hope of recovery, eſpecially if the diſeaſe proceeded by any outward violence, that ſuch bodies have bin by my experience found to be generally moſt hopeful of recovery, either by amputation in the one or the other kind, as the occaſion will moſt fitteſt bear; and on the contrary, perſons that are to be diſmembred in full ſtrength, if it be to be acted in the ſound part, bear a far greater venture of their lives, then the miſerable dejected wretches do, as aforeſaid, except it can be effected in the putrid part.
                  
                     
And one obſervation more, to be by all men had in regard; namely, that our God in Naturehath created in mans body ſuch a ſtrong antipathie betwixt the living and the dead parts thereof, that when by any violence in Nature, either by diſtemperature from within, teſtified by Feavours Peſtilential, or others, or by the outward violence of Engines of Warre, or other incident miſchances, as by Fractures, Contuſions, &c. whereby one part or limb of mans body becommeth ſphacelated and dead before the other▪ it is manifeſt, that the living parts do as it were, either in fear or diſdain of the dead parts, or for ſome other ſecret cauſe in Nature, (though not without great pain and grief) notably withdraw themſelves each from the other, as in diſdain, leaving neither warmth, not at all any comfort, motion, nor ſenſe, either by blood or ſpirits, or ought elſe moving in the dead Veines, Nerves, nor Arteries, neither any ſenſe in the Perioſtcon, that ſenſible Panicle that covereth the bones; but as by a compariſon of a Snail may in part be explained, they wholly withdraw themſelves: for the Snail having, by the vertue of natural warmth, ſtretched her ſelf out of her ſhell, either for her neceſſity, nouriſhment, or delight, in a moment apprehending cold, or danger, retyres into her ſhell, and with all her force, by her own ſlime, ſhuts her ſelf cloſe up again, and ſo reſts her ſelf in a ſuppoſed ſafety, with her no doubt content; even ſo all the living inſtruments, faculties, or veſſels of Nature, as in a nauſeous diſdain, contempt, or fear of the dead parts, forſake the ſphacelated parts, and leave them utterly deſperate and impotent, and by vertue of the Radical Balſam of Nature contracts and ſhrowds her relict living parts, as Artiſts may judge by the mortified toes of children; but much the better, where Art is at hand to aid Nature, ſo that thereby the dead parts become as a noyſome and heavy burthen to the living parts: ſo as if you wound the ſphacelated part, it is not onely ſenſeleſſe, but alſo it is without blood or ſpirits at all, neither doth blood or humours run any more, nor ſo much as move in the ſphacelated or putrid Veines at all; and whileſt lively Nature is (as aforeſaid) ſhutting her dead enemy out of her living doores, by ſtopping up all the breaches, that ſhe may hold the relict of her own, if animal Art have not the charity to take her dead enemy from her: yet vital agility, aſſiſted by natural motion and will, in his due time doth efficiate what fairly can be expected, for the aſſiſting of Nature, and ſupplying all defects proceeding ex intemperie; all which excellent offices in Nature, no queſtion, proceed de praeſciencia Dei.

                  FOr brevity ſake, in this place, I will not ſpend time to write of the general diſeaſes, cauſes, or reaſons, that might urge the amputation of any member, having elſewhere written ſomewhat thereof; onely my intent, for the preſent, is to aquaint the younger ſort with my long experienced practice, for the manner of diſmembring in a mortified part, where juſt cauſe is offered: having undertakeen it meerly for the publique good, by informing the younger ſort of Surgeons, as well for their incouragements in the ſafe and warrantable putting in practice my pactical Method therein, as alſo to ſhew and fore warn them from being over-much miſ-led, in the inſiſting upon old errours and traditions of their Maſters, Patrons, and Predeceſſours, too punctually; As for example:

                        aſe put betwixt two Surgeons. Suppoſe the younger Surgeon in conſultation with his Friend or Brother Surgeon, by way of asking advice, ſhould put the caſe and ſay; I have a Patient that hath the toes of his feet putrefied, fiſtulated, and many wayes perforated with foul bones therein, ſo that it is unſound even almoſt to the joynts of the ankle, or the like, and I have endeavoured by Art, and with advice the beſt I can, to heal him, and cannot prevail in the Cure: Wherefore, ſince the toes of the foot cannot be cured, the reſt of the foot, as unprofitable, were, as I ſuppoſe, beſt to be taken away, and no leſſe of the legge alſo; for it will be but a hinderance to the Patient, conſidering that he cannot ſtand thereon, and is full of grievous pain; I will therefore conclude, according to cuſtome, to take all off a little below the Gartering place, leaving a fit room for the ſtilt, to reſt the body upon: The which his ſaid friend admitteth of, as good practice; and ſo he proceedeth to the work, as being a rational and fair courſe, and warrantable. If the reſt of his ſuggeſtion or indications be anſwerableThe Chirurgical caſe anſwered and admitted. unto the aforeſaid allegation, the work is doubtleſſe good; and ſo I my ſelf would heretofore have done, untill my practice taught me better things: but now, by my own practice, which I much rather would ground on, then upon (ipſe dixit) I take a ſhorter courſe:

For, if the bones of the toes of the feet onely were foul, fiſtulated, &c. as is ſuggeſted, yea, and therefore incurable, for ſo ſtands the ſuggeſtion, as being ſo by reaſon of ſome great contuſion, wound, or ulcer, or otherwiſe, as aforeſaid, with divers fragments of foul bones in them, or the like; I would not proceed as afor
                        •
                     ſaid, if the Patient were mine, and he or ſhe otherwiſe of a good habit of body, the joynts of the ankle it ſelf not being fiſtulated, nor plainly corrupted: but rather I would take off the foot, I mean the toes onely, before theA note of practiſe put. joynts of the ankle, and ſpare the joynt of the ankle, and that with a fitting Inſtrument made for the purpoſe, with good hope to effect the cure, and to ſave the joynt, to the great joy and good ſervice of the Patient: for I would ſave him a part of the foot to ſtand upon; yea, and if to ſtand on, I dare ſay, to go on in a reaſonable manner: the which I have more then once put in practice, and effected with good ſucceſſe: but on the other ſide, if that the joynt of the ankle be diſeaſed, ſo that this my way will not take good effect, then I will yield the foot is not to be ſaved, by reaſon of the aforeſaid defects thereof;A yeelding to the firſt propoſition. and then in ſuch a caſe I will give way, and ſay, that the whole legge is beſt to be taken away, as aforeſaid, and it is an artificiall courſe and good practice: Yet (under favour) let me put the Reader in mind of another rationall good Method, which were a farre better courſe then to take away a guiltleſſe ſound legge, if any other means were found, and the practice of our times had experienced and approved thereof; & it is a modern practiſe frequently practiced in the Eaſt-Indies, as it hath
                        An Eaſt-India practiſe.
                      been credibly reported to me by ſundry credible Surgeons, who having ſpent ſome time in travell there, have related it to me, namely, that they have ſeen divers perſons, who having formerly had their feet chopped off at the ankles, by cenſure of their Countrey Lawes, for treſpaſſes committed, and the ſaid men have been cured by their own Countrey Surgeons, and after have pue their ſtumpes into large Canes or rcedes, which they tearm Bamboes, being ſtuffed with Cotton Wooll, or the like, and they all their lives after have been imployed to runne of Etrands, and get their livings as before, notwithſtanding the want of feet, though, as I conceive, not with former like ſpeed: which hath put a longing deſire in me, I confeſſe, having had opportunity above ſome others, to have tryed the experience in the Hoſpital, but a fit ſubject hath not preſented it ſelf to me for a tryal: for I have, I confeſſe, ever been tender in that point, and loath to put any one Patient againſt his own free-will, upon new inventions, by beginning new practice upon him, making an unwilling perſon the firſt example; every Patient in ſuch a caſe having juſt freedome to chuſe his way: although, on the other ſide, a Patient fit for ſuch a tryal of Art ought to be one, who by a violent contuſion, as of a wound made by Gun-ſhot, or ſome other violence, as a violent bruiſe by an intolerable weight had ſpoyled the foot and ankle, and not any one whoſe diſeaſe proceeded from any evill habit in the blood, as in a body having Struma, or ſcrupulous tumours, for there is ſmall hope in ſuch, for their ſtumps will not heal ſound to bear their bodies.
                  
                     
                     It is unjuſt in nature, that any member being ſound, ſhould ſuffer for an unſound one. For I confeſſe, I eſteem it very unjuſt in Nature, rhat any one part of a ſound member ſhould ſuffer and be taken off for the fault or defect of another, being ſound and blameleſſe, eſpecially when any better or other comfort can poſſibly be found. As for example, for the offence or diſeaſe of the toes, let onely the toes ſuffer, and no more of the members of the body be loſt, if it may ſo be: and for the offence of the foot and joynt thereof, if it be intolerable by exceeding pain, and therefore not to be ſuſtained, it is juſt, that ſo much be amputated as deſerveth expulſion, and not, as is ſaid, to take away a ſound and blameleſſe legge, when it is innocent and free from fault, errour, or diſeaſe: for the nobleneſſe of each member of mansOf the excellen

Secondly, I had one Thomas Brown, about Anno 1619. a Sayler, who had received a great wound by Gun-ſhot at Sea upon the right legge, the greater FoſſelsA biſlory for an example. thereof being broken in ſunder, ſo that the ſhot had carried away two inches of the ſaid bone in length, together with the lacerating the muſcles, nerves, Artcries, Veines, &c. whereby it was ſo contuſed, lacerated and torn aſunder, with alſo ſo much loſſe of ſubſtance, that nature could not bear to heat that member to be any way ſerviceable for ought; beſides, there had followed upon the wound ſo great and intolerable hemorrage or expence of blood and ſpirits, that the member mort fied by reaſon of the former great evacuations and contuſions, neither could nature in that Patient poſſibly have born a diſmembringLoſſe of blood cauſeth Gangrena. in a whole part, without eminent danger of preſent death, and ſo was the eſtate and caſe of this Patient before he came by me to be cured in Saint Bartholomews Hoſpital; wherefore conſidering well his moſt deſperate eſtate, I reſolved to make a ſecond experience of him, and did take off the wounded legge in the lacerated dead part, wherein I conceive (as afore-ſaid) all men of judgment will eaſily be of opinion, that the Patient by that work was without danger of death or pain, and without loſſe of any drop of blood, and I healed this patient by Gods mercy in five moneths, and he had been by the half ſooner whole, had not he loſt ſo exceeding much blood and ſpirits by his wounds, as afore-ſaid; and this Patient was living at the writing hereof, being many yeares after the amputation, the method of which cure, with the manner of amputating thereof, ſhall (God aſſiſting me) hereafter be ſet down.
                  
                     
                     Another example. The next I took off in the mortified place, was one Thomas Hog, a ſhippe-Carpenter, a Scotchman, who alſo was living at the writing hereof; this man at his labour aboard the ſhippe, ſtanding ſtoutly at his work, at the ſtraining of a Cable as it was running out of the bits of the ſhip (as the Sea-men terme it) the Cable tooke hold of his legge, cloſe by the ankle, and forceably bruiſed in peices, not onely the veines, arteries, and nerves, with the ſofter parts, but brake alſo the bones in ſunder with extream violence, inſomuch, as by reaſon of the want of a Surgeon preſent to dreſſe him, by great effuſion of blood and ſpirits, the legge mortified the next day, and he after that fell unto my part in the Hoſpital to be cured, the which being emboldened by the good ſucceſſe of the two former, I took off his legge alſo in the mortified part, as I did the other, and made a perfect cure thereof in three moneths, and he followed the trade of a ſhip-Carpenter at the writing hereof.
                  
                     Another example. Alſo two yeares after, I cured an Apprentice of one Maſter Goddard an Upholſter at the ſign of the Crown in the Poultry in London, named John Harding, in his Maſters houſe, who after a fierce peſtilential Feavour, had his right legge mortified in bed as he lay, and I took it off in the mortified part, at, or near the gartering place, which by the ancient uſe of Art of our times, muſt have been taken off in a ſound place, notwithſtanding the great feebleneſſe of the Patient at that time, and his eminent danger of death, he being extream feeble, and at the point of death, in which caſe to have taken it off in the ſound part, he doubtleſſe would have dyed under my hand, but by Gods mercy he lived divers yeares after, and went moſt neatly on an Artificial legge not eaſily diſcovered.

fingers, as is ſaid, all in one morning without pain, terrour or of any loſſe of blood unto her, in the taking them off, and made her perfectly whole in a very ſhort time, namely, within three moneths, ſo merciful is our God unto us vile creatures, when we are moſt unworthy of ſuch his mercies: ſhe is at the inſtant writing hereof alſo living.
                  Now with your friendly patience, onely one example more, I will trouble you with, namely, of the cure of a mortification proceeding of a Carbuncle in a Feavour Peſtilential by me performed, and IA hiſ

                  The work was of a certain Stationer, then dwelling in Pauls Church-yard (whoſe name I conceal,) for that at the writing hereof he lived, and it was performed upon his Teſticles, who in the Plague-time, that was Auno 1612. as I remember, or about that time, by a Carbuncle, that by Gods hand ſeized upon one of his Teſticles, and namely upon the left Teſticle, that it became wholly mortified with the halfe of the Scroton, or the purſe of the Cod, in briefe, I tooke and cut away the ſaid left Teſticle, or ſtone, whichAn amputation of a Teſticle with the half of the Scrotum. was wholly mortified with the halfe of the Scroton, or the purſe of the ſame ſtone in the mortified place, and healed him perfectly whole in five weekes and leſſe, and after the loſſe of that his one ſtone, or Teſticle, he married and had divers children, and I verily believe they were my Patient his own, and by him begotten on his wife.
                  Let theſe inſtances ſuffice; and now having preſumed of the friendly Reader, by my former digreſſions, I have reſolved with my ſelf, though I confeſſe in a mean ſtile, to put forth theſe inſtructions, being as is ſaid, for the benefit of poſterities, as I conceive, and namely, that when my bones are at reſt, upon fair and reaſonable grounds, any diſcreet Artiſt may boldly attempt, and doubtleſſe perform the like practice, for that I am confidently perſwaded, it will be a means for the ſaving and preſerving the lives of many worthy and valiant Souldiers, and other brave hardy Sea-men, eſpecially in time of Warres, from which God of his mercy protect our Countrey.
               
               
                  
                  Certain Rules to be had in regard before diſmembring be taken in hand, either inſound or mortified parts.
                  Caveats before abſciſsion.
                  FIrſt, amputation or diſmembring of any man whatſoever, is neverThe firſt rule. to be undertaken by any Artiſt without judicious preconſideration, nor without the advice of other expert Surgeons, firſt had and obtained, as I have ſaid, yea, and of thoſe of the beſt judgments in practice, where ſuch may be had.
                  
                     The ſecond rule. Secondly, diſmembring or amputation is not to be put off nor delayed where neceſſity requireth not to ſtay for the beſt advice; yet let me thus far explain my ſelf, that the moſt mortifications, yea, and few extempted, may ſtay for advice, if the Artiſt do take his juſt time for it.
                  
                     The third rule. Thirdly I adviſe that no Artiſt attempt to undertake the work of taking away any member from any perſon, but by the deſire and with the good will and full conſent of the ſaid perſon firſt had, If the ſaid patient have his perfect ſenſes, and be of years and judgment, but if want be thereof, let the patients friends and kindred be adviſed with concerning it, and give conſent thereto, yea, and deſire it, for I counſel all young Surgeons to be exceeding modeſt and ſparing, in puttingA Caveat in amputation, not to do it but by conſent and intreaty of the patient. forwards themſelves, and their Patients to the dangerous work of amputation, or moving them at all thereunto, eſpecially where it is to be acted upon the whole skinne, leſt peradventure it be afterwards ſaid, it might have been ſaved on, had not the Surgeon been overforward for his gain: for no little, though for the moſt part unjuſt reproach and ſcandal falleth upon the Surgeon, by ſuch his improvident forwardneſſe.
                  Fourthly, the work of diſmembring ought not to be done nor attemptedThe fourth rule. by any, who have not firſt, either done the like, or at the le

                     The fifth rule of preparation to amputation. Fifthly, before any begin to make the inciſion, he ought to have all the materials fit for ſuch a work ready and at hand (as elſewhere I have adviſed) and namely, both Inſtruments, Ligatures,

Medicines, and all other additaments, which are aſſiſtant in the work.
                  
                     The ſixth rule. Sixthly, the amputation once reſolved upon, and all things being ready for the work, let the Surgeon with all his aſſiſtants and friends, not forget before the beginning of the work, heartily to call upon God for a bleſſing upon their endeavours, and let the Patient the day before, have notice given him, that he alſo may take time to prepare himſelf with true reſolution of ſoul and body, to undergoe the work, as being never performed without danger of death, but more eſpecially, if it be to be done in ſound parts, which done, then let the Surgeon prepare himſelf as aforeſaid, with alſo his helpers, namely at the leaſt five perſons beſides himſelf, as for example,Five perſons to aſſiſt the Surgeon in amputation. one to ſit behind the Patient to hold him, a ſecond for a holder, who by the Surgeon muſt be inſtructed faſt to ſtand before him, and to beſtride the limb to be amputated; and to amplect the member; and a third to hold and ſtay the lower end of the diſeaſed member to be taken off; a fourth to bring and receive back the ſharp inſtruments, a fifth to attend to deliver the Artiſt his Needles, and Buttons, reſtrictive rollers, boulſters, bladder, with other additaments and ſervices, and ſo ſoon as poſſible may be, to ſtay with the palme of his hand the Medicines applyed to the end of the abſciſſed ſtump, that being the duty of the fifth helper, and the ſixth is the Artiſt himſelf that diſmembreth▪ for ſix and not fewer, are a fit number, and that with the leaſt to theThe manner of amputating expreſſed. work of taking off a legge or an arm, if it be to be done in the whole or ſound part, or for the taking off of a member proceeding by a wound by Gun-ſhot, done in the lacerated, not totally mortified part; but for the taking off of a member in the mortified part, three perſons as aſſiſtants may ſerve, or two for a need, namely one to hold the upper part, the other the lower end, and the third to abſciſſe, namely the Surgeon. It followeth now, that I proceed to explain according to my opinion, in what caſes a member may be taken off in a mortified part, with as good hope, and more to preſerve the life of the Patient, then if it were taken off in the ſound part.

Firſt, in frozen members, and all that come of extream cold, it may be done very ſafelyalſo, in all mortifications of members by Feavours whatſoever, the Feavour being firſt cured, yea, although they were peſtilential, I ſpeak this of long and true experience, and therefore I conceive, I may without diſparagement omit the producing or repetition of the ancient Writers, for witneſſes, or warrants in ought for me in any ſuch works, as I have manifeſtly and often performed in the parts mortified.
                  Alſo amputation may be done ſafely in all ſuch mortifications as proceed by contuſions, as alſo in all mortified members proce ding by wounds made with Gun-ſhot, where a mortified place is circular, or more then ſeem circular, and that with comfort and good hope of the ſaving of life, to the languiſhing Patient, as

by any other way. And as touching the poor Souldier and Seaman, after that he hath ſuffered terrible and unſpakeable pain, as alſo great loſſe of blood and ſpirits by his wounds, it were then pity of all pities, if any other remedy could be had or thought of, to wound him a new in the whole part, and thereby to endanger him, yea, and ten to one to kill him by Art, namely, by artificial amputation, to deprive him of that national relict, poor blood and feeble ſpirits yet reſerved within him, meerly to hold life and ſoul together, whereof by conſequent the ſaid ſmall portion of relict blood and ſpirits, being taken away, he muſt needs periſh, yea, even as may be feared in the very act of amputation, the contrary being a wonder, Quaſi unum è multis.

Alſo amputation in the mortified parts may be done in mortifications that proceed by hemorrage in any wounds whatſoever that can be named, if the patient be otherwiſe curable by any art of amputation, he is then ſafer and more eaſier cured by this way. Alſo in all mortifications that proceed by over-hard ligatures, or by the violence of ſcaldings and burnings, or by the extremity of corroſive medicines immoderately, or unskilfully applyed.

                  Alſo mortifications happening by fractures or diſlocations of legges, or armes, fingers, or toes, as alſo in all caſes happening, and proceeding by ſtarving, namely, for want of food, weakneſſe and debility of nature, either of children or of old folks, the patient having no preſent Feavour at the time of the diſmembring, neither being in a Delirium, beſides many other mortifications for btevity omitted.

And although generally this knowledge and practice ſerveth well in times of peace, yet it ſerveth moſt fitly in times of warre, yea, and at all times, for ſuch Surgeons as are imployed in military affaires, by Sea or Land, that they might take notice thereof, and alſo inable themſelves to make uſe of this manner of practice where occaſion is offered, for the comfort, and more hopeful preſerving the lives of the valiant Souldiers, and brave hardy Sea-men, as I have ſaid, who for the honour and defence of our King and Countrey,

very often are put to encounter with their, and our enemies, to their no ſmall perils and grievous ſufferings by fearful wounds made with Gun-ſhot, and other fierce engines of warre, and by the accidental harmes, ſuccouring them, whereby they ſuffer great effuſion of blood and ſpirits by their wounds, ſo that thereby together with the want of good lodging and comfortable nouriſhment, which to ſuch good fellowes, is for the moſt part, but very mean and ſcant, eſpecially in ſhips and Camps, their wounds, after their moſt pittiful endurings and languiſhings, as aforeſaid, commonly end in a Gangrena, which granted, all men may eaſily then judge, how heavenly a thing, and above all meaſure comfortable it is to the deſpairing patient, if his life may be preſerved and prolonged, and he ſafely healed without the loſſe of any blood or ſpirits at all, or any pain in the act of amputation; and here as by the way I deſire to put to the Chirurgica

The ſecond might alledge, that theA ſecond ſuppoſition anſwered. former ſuppoſition granted, namely, that if the wounded member would be a burthen, I therefore before the abiding of the time, either of digeſtion or putrefaction of the aforeſaid wounded parts, would whileſt my Patient were yet in ſtrength, for preventing Feavers, furtive fluxes, and other fearful accidents incident to ſuch great wounds as Gangrene, ſince I ſee the member is like though ſaved in part, yet will be unſerviceable and an eye-ſore, and burthen, I will immediately take it off in the wounded and lacerated

part, before that woful Criſis of Gangrene ſeize upon my patient, which commonly is accompanied with a Feavour, and expence of vital ſpirits, and death waiteth at the dore.
                  The third pleadeth in this manner following, and ſaith the formerThe third ſuppoſition anſwered. ſuppoſition granted, yet for my patient, although his wounds received be deſperate, as formerly is ſuggeſted, it would be held great raſhneſſe and unadviſed cruelty in me, if I ſhould but offer to take off this member, eſpecially in the wounded part, ye

But yet let theThe reſolution. young Artiſt take this note from me, that when he apparently ſeeth that a limb cannot be ſaved without amputation, that whileſt his patient is yet in ſtrength, as afore is expreſſed, that he do his duty: firſt to ſhew the patient his opinion, grounded upon Art and good reaſon, and if his patient give way to it, then in the Name of God, the ſooner he taketh it off, he better; but if the patient do not approve of the motion, good reaſons tbeing given him, the errour reſts in him but if he conſent to the work, let him take it off in the wounded part, although it be not wholly gangrenated circular, regarding that memorable old verſe:

                  And further, let the underſtanding Artiſt conſider, as followeth, that if the bullet have taken away one full third part of a legge, or arm, in the circumference thereof, with the breach of both the bones, the great contuſion and laceration conſidered with, alſo the loſſe of blood and ſpirits thereby happening, it may be feared juſtly that the limb although the party live, will hardly or never be ſaved; but howſoever, it will be no way ſerviceable, being done by a contuſed wound lacerated, ſo that if ever it be healed, the wound muſt come to ſuppuration, and thereby to digeſtion, ſo that by that reaſon ſome part more▪ will be ſpent and loſt by quitture, and by conſequent, if by the part taken away, the part contuſed ſo fall out that the half limb, with the office and vigour thereof be loſt, or come away by the juſt courſe of Art in the healing, ſcarce one often ſcape with life, by reaſon of the pain and great expence of blood and ſpirits incident, as is ſaid, and by reaſon of the long continuance of the griefe, ſo that it falleth out, that for the moſt part, Nature is tyred out, and the Patient dyeth in Maraſmus or hecticke, and ſuch an end is more to be feared at Sea, where want of fitting nouriſhment

is, then at Land. So much I held fit to expreſſe of my experience and opinion, for young Artiſts to ruminate on.

Another inhibition is, when an amputation is to be done, and there is no mortified place to do it in, which in the moſt happeneth; and then, in ſuch a caſe, the Reader will grant the expert Surgeon is freely admitted to chuſe his place, ſo that he chuſe it ſecundum Artem, according to Art, and ſo proceed; and ſuch occaſions are very frequent, as namely for one, when the occaſions of diſmembring proceed from corroſive, putrid, or fiſtulous Ulcers in Joynts, or by foul bones, or by fractured bones, or by diſlocated bones, or members diſtorted, or otherwiſe, by diſeaſes incurable and unſufferable, when and whereas no mortified place can fitting be found, the Surgeon then muſt be left to take the convenienteſt whole place.
                  
                     A third inhibition. Another inhibition generally is, when an occaſion hapneth in a putrid body, where Gangrenous and livid ſpots, or otherwiſe diſcoloured ſpots happen here and there, to and fro, upon the body, preſaging a hidden and venomous humour, or violence, or otherwiſe deficiency in Nature from within him. Gangrenes do proceed (de abdita cauſa Naturae) by occult cauſes in Nature, or when a diſſolution in the harmony of Nature manifeſtly appeareth to be at hand, or when Peſtilential or Carbunculous ſpots happen upon a Patient, which many times mortifie even to the bone; and yet ſuch Peſtilential Gangrenous ſpots after ſeparate of themſelves, and the Patient liveth and is healed, for that often in ſuch caſes the patients receive an ordinary Cure, which my eyes have ſeen more then one ſo eſcape, and cured in the Plague time; and many other occaſions may hinder ſuch amputations, which are not now in the apprehenſion of my memory to unfold.
                  
                     
Onely I deſire, that younger Artiſts would obſerve to hold the general rule in wounds made with Gun-ſhot, formerly touched; namely, that they foreſee where they cannot ſave a Limb to be ſerviceable, that they, with the approbation of the Patient, and likewiſe byAdvice for younger Artiſts in the cure of Gun-ſhot, by amputation. good advice, they take it away in time, whileſt Nature is in her ſtrength: and if they have a fit mortified place, then to do it there if poſſibly they can; and the rather, becauſe there the work is in part done to their hand; not regarding, though the ſtump fall out ſomewhat too long, for that the Patient hath the Artiſt ready ever when he pleaſe, in ſuch caſes as need ſhall require. But grant the amputation be to be acted in the one way or the other, yet the Artiſt may not be wanting of cauterizing Buttons, at the leaſt of one, at any amputation, leſt having need on the ſudden, and unexpected, there be occaſion of the uſe of one of them, and by their want he loſe the Patient by improvidence, called had-I-wiſt.
                  But even now, me thinks, I hear one of the hotter ſort of my younger Brethren ſay, Will this old nan never have done, and ſhew us his Riddle? I have almoſt tyred my ſelf out with his circumlocutions: Why doth he not conclude, and come to the matter, after his long proceſſe? Wherefore, leſt he ſhould grow too much impatient, I will endeavour in ſome weak meaſure to pacifie him, and fall upon the buſineſſe promiſed. In which I conceive, and hope the friendly Reader may gather, and charitably think, that the ſcope of my precedent narrations to amputation at this time, is not altogether unprofitable, and impertinent to the matter in hand, although perhaps adjudged tedious; and namely, were it but onely for to introduct the younger Artiſt, and embolden him to the practice: that when I come to the point of the operation it ſelf, he may be the readier for the acting thereof; for, in truth, the method will be ſhort: ſo that a few words will ſuffice to expreſſe it, and a few inſtruments or medicaments for the efficiating thereof.
                  
                     Directions for the amputating Surgeon. Wherefore, for the firſt work of amputating in the putrid part, let the Surgeon have at hand at the leaſt two or three miniſters or ſervants beſides himſelf, to aſſiſt him in the work, as is heretofore ſaid: and as for Medicines for the firſt dreſſing, let him have ready a good fomentation, being an artificial, ſtrong, well fitted Lixivium, that may have faculty abſterſive, deſiccative, and almoſt cauſtick, but not ſo ſharp, that it corrode the hands of the fomentor; let him alſo be provided with fit ligature, and with large woollen ſtupes, alſo with fitting boulſtring and convenient bandage: then let him further have ready for inſtruments, a fit amputating Serra, a Catling and a good ſmall inciſion Knife, a good pair of ſtrong Scizars, and three or four cauterizing inſtruments, ſuch as in their places ſhall be deſcribed: and when he proceedeth to the effecting of the inciſion, let one of the aſſiſtants take the upper part of the member, holding it in both his hands reaſonable faſt and ſteddy, I mean the whole part thereof, ſomewhat neer unto the unſound part, and let the other helper hold the

part, I mean the putrid part to be abſciſſed in his hand, each party holding reaſonable hard and ſteddy to the work, whileſt the Surgeon himſelf firſt by circumciſing divide the putrid fleſh from the bone, doing it ſomewhat neer the quick part, but not too neer it, about one inch-full from the quick part, as may be imagined, will do well, that with the Serra he may come without fear to divide the bone or bones aſunder, where he is ſure they are ſphacelated, and that carefully firſt, having regard to make his inciſion wiſely and ſecurely in the inſenſible part, as is ſaid, not touching any quick part at all with his ſharp inſtruments, neither with the one nor the other; which he may the certainer obſerve to do, if with a Needle he enquire cautiouſly. Let him alſo divide betwixt the bones the putrid members or parts there being, leſt by lacerating or tearing with the teeth of the Serra he offend; which done, let the Artiſt amputate the bones.
                  And as for the reſt of the work, the putrid fleſh being (as is ſaid) divided, and bones being abſciſſed and ſo removed, there will be admitted deliberation ſufficient, with full time to conſider what is next to be done; the which will be, as in order, for diminution of the remaining excremental part, by abſciſſion or uſtion, one or both, to remove, for the firſt, as much more thereof as ſafely you may from the ſtump, with not being over-ſolicitous in taking all at one time: for in truth it matters not much▪ neither doth it any thing haſten the work of healing, that all be at the firſt removed; but rather, it may bring terrour and danger to the Patient, to be too buſie or too forward; which by all means ſhould be avoided, for fear of inducing of a Feavour: onely it will not be amiſſe, at the firſt dreſſing, by cautery ſuperficially to run over the putrid fleſh, and alſo therewith to heat the end of the bone or bones abſciſſed; and alſo after that, with a good Lixivium ſatis calidum with ſtupes well to foment not onely the ſphacelated wounded parts, but alſo the parts adjacent, with ſufferable full warmth, for the ſpace of half an houre; not at all uſing any ſcarification in this whole work, for that it will bring terrour and needleſſe pain, and be fruitleſſe: which done, leave very warm woollen ſtupes upon the part; and ſo well bound up, finiſh that dreſſing.
                  Then the next work, namely, at the ſecond dreſſing, will be onely the reiterating of the Artificial former actions and application, ever (as aforeſaid) very warm fomenting, being ſomewhat hot, and the Medicine ever ſtill ready on the fire, and for the mortified part, onely to be applyed with a ſcalding hot ſmall Map, of purpoſe made, or a Spunge, and that with ſeveral and often ſhiftings and reiteratings for half an hour, or longer; provided, you diſcourage not the Patient, by ſcalding or excoriating the whole parts next adjacent at all: in which time, it will alſo be very neceſſary, that you have ready one or more of the cauterizing Buttons hot, to apply betwixt the fomentings; as alſo not omitting, if occaſion ſerve, with Scizers or otherwiſe, to be clearing any inſenſible ſloughs from the wounded

part: and forget not, at each dreſſing, with a Button to heat the end of the bone, untill the Patient be ſenſible of the heat, and no longer; the Buttons being of ſuch formes, as hereafter in their places ſhall be deſcribed; whereby the reſt of the putrid fleſh may by degrees be conſumed, eroded, abſciſſed, and fret away, as is ſaid.
                  But in this work, let not the younger Artiſt preſume, in a work ofA Caution. ſuper erogation, or over-excellency, to be too buſie to ſcorch, ſcarifie, or excoriate the ſenſible part, in preſſing to take away all what is putrid from the quick fleſh, nor to cut or divide betwixt the quick and the dead fleſh, for fear of awakening of a ſleeping dogge; neither to provoke pain to the Patient at all, as neer as he can, further then what of neceſſity ſhall accede in fomenting, whereby to miniſter a full and ſufficient warmth to the whole parts, and no more; neither by extream hot ſtupes, in fomenting the living part too too hot, as is ſaid, nor by cauterizing ſo long, untill over-much pain be provoked: onely let all the operations and applications for the dreſſings, from time to time, be very gentle, mild, and pleaſing, as may be poſſible, to the Patient, but eſpecially for the firſt dreſſing, that without any great ſenſible pain the Surgeon may come ſomewhat neer the ſenſible and living parts, ever mildly eroding, clipping, and abſcinding onely the corrupt fleſh, and giving a lively warmth to Nature; and in this manner proceed thrice, if you ſee fitting, or at the leaſt twice for every twenty four houres, or as in deſcretion the diſcreet Artiſt pleaſe, and ſo for three dayes and nights together in this work, or as long or ſhort a time as cauſe ſhall offer: And you ſhall not need to uſe any cauterizing Buttons at all, after the firſt putrid fleſh is eroded, onely one, and that at each dreſſing you may uſe ſomewhat hot unto the remaining dead end of the bone, therewith to cauſe the ſaid end of the remaining abſciſſed bone to ſcale the ſooner: but after the ſecond or third dreſſing, it will be fit to conſider to apply ſome Unguent foveant and digeſtive very warm.
                  And as for further documents touching artificial proceeding in this Cure, I may as a ſuperfluous thing, and frivolous, forbear any further narration to the diſcreet young Artiſt or Scholar in Surgery, for that the reſt of the Cure will no way differ from the ordiuary way of the Cure of other ordinary Ulcers, but will be healed with much celerity and comfort, through Gods Favour, both to the Surgeon and Patient. And for the bone, fear it not; for by the onely heating the mortified end thereof, it will ſcale off by that time the Ulcer be healed, and that with fleſh incarnated upon the living part of it admirably, and will in fitting time ſiccatrize, and be perfectly whole, if the Surgeon will have patience with poor Nature in her weakneſſe to forbear, and not be too buſie, eſpecially with Mineral Medicines; all which I leave to the diſcretion of each underſtanding Artiſt: onely once more with this Caveat, as by reiteration, that for the end of the ſtump, after that it hath ſcaled, that the Surgeon be ſure to uſe no Mineral Medicine at all, as precipitate Vitriol, nor

any other, neither mixed with Baſilicon, nor otherwiſe, but with gentle and ordinary Digeſtives, Mundificatives, Incarnatives, and the like gentle Deſiccatives, or at the utmoſt, Parum Aluminis Usti, if need be: for that by experience I know, that Mineral Medicines, as they help to ſcale a bone, ſo they will ſurely help to defile even the ſame bone again and again, and ſo make long work upon work; the which is foul and hatefull for any Artiſt to be guilty of, that profeſſeth to fear God; yea, and it is abominable to be wittingly tainted with that Devilliſh crime: for, let reproach and many evill Curſes ever attend upon that Surgeon, which willingly prolongeth healing; for which many an innocent Artiſt dayly ſtands accuſed unjuſtly thereof: which guilt I adviſe all the Sonnes and ſucceſſo
                        •
                     s of Aeſculapius may avoid, even as they fear God, and deſire a bleſſing from him upon their Labours.
                  
                     The concluſion. And now to conclude, concerning amputation aforeſaid, ſee it be done in requiſite time: For the omitting thereof, untill the blood and ſpirits be too much ſpent, maketh often the ſucceſſe of the work doubtfull and deſperate, eſpecially where it is to be acted upon the whole part: for in truth, when the languiſhing Patient ſhall truly ſay, Deficit animus; it will be too late for the Artiſt to anſwer, Jam venio And ſo I will take my leave at this preſent, concerning the manual part of the work, in amputating in a mortified place: and for the doing of it in the whole part, I referre the Reader to what I have formerly, in my firſt Edition, in the Surgeons Mate explained, which, together with this Poſt-ſcript, I conceive may ſatisfie any indifferent Reader.
                  Onely one obſervation more, as in charity to the Patient and the young Surgeon, I thought fit to aquaint the young Surgeon with what my experience ſhewed me, and that is; That after any amputation either in the ſound or mortified part, the firſt eskers or cadaverous ſloughesbeing removed, and the Ulcers reaſonably digeſted, mondified, and ſomewhat incarnate, the Patient uſeth ever to be exceeding ſenſible, and grievouſly tender, and alſo fleſh is ſubject on the ſudden to grow over-faſt, and the ſtump is ſubject to turn cancrous, or at the leaſt very dolorous: For remedy whereof, I uſe for one dreſſing, to have Pledgents of fine towe made ready beforehand, ſo much as will cover the whole Ulcer; and having ordinary good ſtrong Unguent. Aegyptiacum, without ſublimate, ſeething hot in a ſmall flat Pewter or Stone diſh, dip the pledgents therein, being very exceeding hot, and ſuddenly applyed ſo hot to the Ulcer, and bound with another thick pledgent to keep it warm, bind it up, and dreſſe it no more in 48▪ houres; and for the next dreſſing, cover the Ulcer onely with ſoft Lint; and likewiſe in all other dreſſings, provide by thick pledgents of towe ever to keep the ſtump very warm: and that one onely dreſſing, as aforeſaid, of Aegyptiacum, will wholly take away the tenderneſſe, and very much conduce to true healing; which a fourtnight after, if need be, may be reiterated.
                  
                     
And as touching amputation to be performed in the mortified place, for that the curing differs nothing from that in common uſe for the healing of Ulcers in general (as is ſaid) therefore if the diſcreet Artiſt have a ſtrong and fit Lixivium, a good Aegyptiacum, a Digeſtive, a Mundificative, an Incarnative, and a Deſiccative or Sigillative Unguent, and according to Art, and in their ſeaſons, make uſe of each of them; he is then fitted for the work. And for the firſt, he may prepare his Lixivium as followeth, if he pleaſe, and have not one of his own experience.

Moreover, there are to be prepared ready: 1. Cauterizing Buttons, ſuch as are following hereafter deſcribed, for the eroding and fretting away of the putrid, Cadaverous, or ſphacelated remainer after abſciſſion of the firſt part, and theſe cauterizing Buttons ought to be thicker then others, namely, more ponderous then thoſe, which uſually Surgeons uſe to cauterize the end of one or two veins or arteries, which being otherwiſe not ſo ſerviceable for this kind of amputation or operation, of which it were requiſite, that two or three were laid into the fire privately, to be hot, to do ſuch needful ſervices, as that work of diſmembring requires, namely, they being hot, are to cauterize or crode (as is ſaid) the putrid fleſh.
                  Alſo it is as fitting to have in readineſſe the other inſtruments common in all amputation, viz. A well fitted ſaw, a diſmembring knife, and inciſion knife, or a ſharp inſtrument, fit to divide and cleanſe betwixt the bones, &c. Not forgetting likewiſe the other fit materials, amongſt the reſt, as ſtupes, and rollers, all which it ought to be the Surgeons own care, to be ſure to ſee ready, that no one thing be wanting at the inſtant, and not to truſt to his aſſiſtants, leſt to his grief and reproach, he be wanting of ſome one or more of them in his neceſſity.
               
               
                  LOving Brethren, if the meanneſſe of my ſtile, the weakneſſe of my aged memory, capacity, or what elſe ſoever herein, is not anſwerable to thy expectation, from me, yet take it in good part, I pray thee, as proceeding from a Friend, who, if his Talent could have afforded better, would willingly have imparted it to thee. The former was the fruits of my Youth; This, ſuch as the weakneſſe of Old Age can afford. The publick good acceptance of the former, hath purchaſed the latter.
                  Vale in Chriſto.
               
               
                  
                  Concerning the Inſtruments for Amputation in the ſphacelated part.
                  BEnevolent Spectator, here enſuing to thy view, are deciphered the Inſtruments moſt uſeful for the Manual operations of ſeverall Amputations in the ſphacelated parts of members, which being for memory ſake, onely deſcribed to the expert Artiſt, he will eaſily conjecture and reſolve in Art, according to each preſent occaſion, which of them to make uſe of, and which to omit: all of them tending to the ſcope of a reſolved abſciſsion, by ablating impurum à puro, the unpure from the pure, for the better perfecting the warrantable ſcope of the ſtudious Artiſt, in efficiating the ſame, that he may make a cure thereof, although detractors and depravers of that excellent myſtery of healing, maliciouſly make a by-word, or word of reproach againſt Surgeons, of making a cure; yet I will hope, if it be for the ſaving of the precious life of his miſerable Patient, the making of a perfect cure, will have a fair conſtruction from good men: yea, although it be to be performed as indeed it muſt be, part by abſciſsion, aduſtion, cauterization, by eroſion, or Serra, or how elſe ſoever the work may be ſafeſt, and ſureſt, and more artificially efficiated. All and every of which apparent particulars, in their due turns, times and orders, are to be made uſe of, which to deſcribe in each particular, or more thereof then is heretofore related, would be but tedious for me, and frivolous for the Artiſt, who joyning his reaſon and experience with the reading my precedent Relation, will doubtleſs, by Gods favourable permiſsion, make a ſound cure of his Patient: maugre the ſcandal of detractors, in the abuſe of that honeſt phraſe, to the reproach and unjuſt vilifying of many an honeſt well deſerving Surgeon. I end with an old Phraſe,
