            LIke as the almightie eternall God, thre in perſonnes and one in ſubſtaunce, of his tendre mercye and loue, not onely created man at the beginnyng after his owne ſymilytude and lykeneſſe, but alſo wh

This doth God alway afore he puniſhe and plage the worlde. This (I ſaye) hath bene the propertie of God ſens the beginnyng, as the ſtoryes and prophecies of all the holy Byble do teſtifye. And though we had no writyng of Gods actes in tymes paſte, yet hath he practiſed this ſame his wonderfull worke of mercye vpon vs. So that lyke as we

And ſome (thankes be vnto him therfore) hath he brought out of darkenes into his wonderfull light, and out of the deuyls ſeruyce, into the kyngdome of his deare ſonne.
            But alas and wo to this vnthankeful worlde. For lyke as a great nombre that be in priſon of Satan, wyl not come furth when thei are called and the dore ſet open, but go on ſtyll ſtomblyng in darkenes, whan the lanterne of light is offred them: Euen ſo if any playe a wyſe mans part, &Thei that folowe goddes worde, are laughed to ſcorne. do as he is warned by Goddes worde, he ſhall haue a ſorte of apyſhe people, a nombre of deſertes and ſcornefull mockers, whiche, becauſe the man wyll not daunce in the deuyls morys with them, nor kepe theyr companye in the bondage of ſynne and vice, neither runne with thē vnto like confuſyon (as S. Peter calleth it) laugh him to ſcorne, and bleare out theyr tonges at him, euen lyke fooles and cockescombes of the worlde. And lyke as whan a

Cor. i. worlde. The Apoſtle ſayth, that the preachyng or worde of Chryſtes croſſe, is foliſhenes to them that periſhe, and that the thyng whiche appertayneth to the ſpirite

                  . Cor. ii. of God, is folyſhenes to a carnally mynded man. Wherby lyke as we may learne that it is no newe thing to be mocked and ſtared vpon for holdyng with the doctrine that maketh ſo muche of Chriſtes death, and the true worſhippyng of God in the ſpirit. Euen ſo may we ſe (to the ſyngular comfort of our conſcience) that no manne mocketh vs for it, but ſuche as periſh and

               fort and conſolacion.
            But becauſe the worlde is angrye with vs for oure fayth, and geueth vs ſo euyl reporte for teachyng it. It ſhalbe expedient for vs to declare what fayth is, and what fayth we meane, when we make mē
               cion therof. Fyrſt becauſe we may not deſcribe it after oure owne iudgement, we wyll rehearſe the wordes of the Apoſtle, whiche writyng to the Hebrewes, ſayethWhat fayth is after this maner: Fayth is a ſubſtance of thynges to be hoped for, an euidence (or certayntie) of thynges whiche do not appeare. By the whiche diffinicion, it is manyfeſt, that when we ſet furth or teache this fayth, we meane no vayne fayth, no falſe opinion of fayth, no fonde ymaginacion of fayth, no deade fayth,

                thinges that are not ſene. This faith then is the iuſtrument, wherby we fele and are certayne of heauenly thynges, that oure corporall eye can not ſe.
            Nowe becauſe none other vertue can ſo apprehende the mercy of god, nor certifye vs ſo effectually of oure ſaluacion,

as this liuyng fayth doeth, therfore hath the ſcripture imputed oure iuſtification before God, onely vnto fayth among all other vertues: Not without other vertues folowyng, but without any other worke or deede iuſtifiyng.
            This is the fayth of Chriſt, whiche allAd Romanos. Gala. Ephe. Jaco. ii the ſcripture ſpeaketh of. This is the fayth that ſaint Paul preacheth to iuſtifye in the ſight of God, as ſainct James teacheth, that workes iuſtifye in the ſight of menne, and that it is but a dead fayth whiche hath no workes. This is the faythHebre. xi. Ro. xiiii. without the whiche it is impoſſile to pleaſe God, and of the whiche whatſoeur proceadeth not, is ſynne. This is theActes .xv. i. Peter. v Gala. v. fayth wherby God purifieth our heartes, and whoſe ende is ſaluacion. This is the fayth that worketh by charitie or godly loue, and is of value before God. This is the fayth wherby the holy fathers whiche were afore Chriſtes in

            This then is no newefangled fayth▪ no ſtraunge fayth, no fayth inuented by mannes brayne, but euen the ſame that

Gods holy ſpirite teacheth in the infallyble trueth of his ſcripture, and that Adam Abel, Enoch and all the other ſeruauntes of God were ſaued in. Why do men therfore either call it a newe fangled fayth, or reporte euyll of vs, for ſettyng it furth: Why? I feare me this is one cauſe: The olde fayth that all thoſe ſeruauntes of God had whō the Apoſtle nameth in the eleuenth chapiter to the Hebrewes, and a lyfe and cōuerſacion ioyned vnto it, whiche was riche and ful of all good workes.

Not that it is euyl to teache or talke of the true olde ſayth, but this I ſay, becauſe that (accordyng to the doctryne of ſainct James)Jaco. i. they are but diſceyuers of them ſelues, that are not doers of Gods worde aſwell as hearers therof. And through ſuche ſlender receiuyng of Chriſtes holy goſpell, it is nowe come to paſſe, that like as we haue nede of ſuche an Apoſtle as was holy S.

For whan he deuyſed the creacyon of man, and the tyme was nowe come, whych his godly wyſdome and prouydence had ordeyned, he fyrſte of all appoynted a wonderfull lodgynge for man and garnyſhed the ſame yet muche more wonderfully. At the begynnynge (whan the goodly and cleare lyghte was made) the Lord prepared the inſtrumentes which he afterwarde ſundred one from another, and ordeyned euery one to ſome purpoſe.

Hym alſo endewedThe treatiō of mā. he aboue all other creatures, and created hym after hys owne ymage. He made hym of body and ſoule, whych ſhuld haue endured for euer, yf he had not fallen into ſynne. Nowe hath he afrayle bodye, and an immortall euerlaſtynge ſoule. But the fyrſt man made he altogether parfecte and wythout blemyſhe, ſo that verelye he was called the ymage of God not wythoute cauſe. The Lorde alſo was not ſuffyſed in garnyſhynge the erathe golye, but fyrſt alſo buylded vpon the erth, a ſpecyall garden of pleaſure, euen a paradyſe: and therin he ſet man hys deare beloued creature. And for aſmuche as he beyng ſoThe creaciō of the woman. litary and alone, coulde not conueniently dwell wythout a make, he appoynted him firſt to plante and kepe the gardē of pleaſure, and prouyded for hym a wyfe, euen out of the bones of hys owne bodye, that ſhe myght be the mans helpe. Thus wolde the goodneſſe of God fynyſhe and make man perfecte, to the intent that he ſhoulde lacke nothynge, whyche ſerued to a ryght wholſome, and perfecte lyfe.
               Therefore was it equall, that man whyche was endewed wyth reaſō and hye vnderſtandynge, ſhulde ſhewe thankefulneſſe and obedyence vnto God, for ſuche hye gyftes. Yee God hym ſelfe (whyche is not only good, but alſo ryghteous) requyreth

And thus thoughte he to helpe hym ſelfe to Goddes maieſtye, by another meanes, rather then by God, and ſo to repayre hys neceſſyte whyche he thought he had. And ſo wyth infydelyte, vnfaythfulneſſe, diſobedyēce and vnthank fulneſſe, he wroughte lyfe, and dyed the deathe: that is, he offended agaynſte God, and fell in to the puniſhment of euerlaſtinge dampnacyon: Yee he made hym ſelfe bonde vnto the Deuyll, whome he was ſo dyligent to beleue, to folowe, and to ſerue: Contrarywyſe he forſoke God, and ſo came he vtterly in to the bondage of the Deuell and darkneſſe.

Who is it now, which ſeyth not here in, all that is written in the hole ſcripture, of beleue, of loue and innocencye: that is to ſaye, of a Chriſten lyfe and fayth?

Notwythſtādyng leaueth hym not vtterly comfortles, but prouideth him a garment, & comforteth hym wyth frēdly wordes, and then fyrſte ſendeth hym awaye from hym Euen thus doth God the father of heauē alſo. For fyrſt he clotheth Adam and Eue agaynſt the froſt and tempeſt of wether, in aſmuche as (by the meanes of ſynne) the wether, the erth, the ayre, and all creatures, were nomore ſo ſubiecte, tame and obedient vnto man, as they were afore the fall. Therfore euen now at thys preſente tyme what ſoeuer inconuenience

& harme is in the good creatures of God, it commeth by the meanes of oure ſynnes. Afterwarde doth the Lorde comforte the myſerable wretched man wyth verye louynge wordes after thys maner: Beholde. Adam is become lyke one of vs,Gene. iii. or: lo, Adam ſhalbe as one of vs, and it ſhall happē vnto hym as to one of vs, and he ſhall know good and euyll.

                  he here vnto Adam, that he ſhall knowe or haue experience of good and euyll. That is to ſay, that vpon erth he muſt fele proſperite and aduerſite, miſery and trouble, ſower and ſwete, and muſte ſuffer neceſſite, payne and afflyction. Yet in all thys, muſt he be conſtant & pacient, for aſmuch as nothynge ſhall happen vnto hym, ſaueCōforte & paciēce in Chriſt. euen the ſame that ſhall happen to one of thē. And he meaneth the ſonne our Lorde Jeſu Chriſt the ſecond perſonne in the holy Trinite. With thys hys paſſyon & thorow the ſame doth he comforte Adam. As though he wolde ſaye: let the payne ſorow and trouble whych thou muſt ſuffer vpon erth, not vexe the, and conſidre that one of vs alſo ſhall take vpon him the kynde and nature of man, and that the ſerpent (as it is ſayde afore) ſhall treade hym on the hele that is to ſaye, he ſhall dye, he ſhalbe oppreſt, and haue muche aſſlyction & trouble, all the dayes of hys lyfe. In the ſame meanyng alſo dyd the holy Apoſtle Peter ſay: Chryſt ſuffred for our ſakes, and gaue vs

an enſample, that we ſhulde folowe hym, and go in hys foteſteppesi. Pet. ii.
               
               Out of all this is it eaſy to vnderſtande, what fayth and knowlege Adam hadAdams fayth of our lord Chriſt. Namely, that he knew in hym very godheade and manhede, and that he ſaw in fayth hys paſſiō and croſſe afarre of, Moreouer, that the paſſion of Chriſt ones do

Secondly, that it is to our lyuynge, an enſample, at the which we ought to lerne pacience in aduerſite, and dayly to dye from all euyll. And here to now ſerue all doctrines of pacience, of bearyng of the croſſe, of deſpiſyng the worlde, & mortifienge or putting of the olde Adam, which thyng is conteyned and wyth many & godly wordes handled thorow out the prophetes and apoſtles. As for Adam, and Eue, they lacked none of theſe thynges, thoughe they had not the matter in wryttyng. For God ſpake it all to them hym ſelfe, and wrote it in theyr hartes. Morouer our fyrſte elders had no church, rytes nor ceremonies, ſaue onely the bodely offryng, a repreſentacion of the ſacrificyng of Chriſte, and exerciſes or tokens of thankfulneſſe. For how ſhulde Cain & Abel els haue knowne any thyng of ſacrifice, yf they had not receaued the ſame at the cuſtome of their father? Who wyth hys wyfe Eua the mother of vs all, was ſaued by none other worke or merite of mā, but onely thorow

and in the bleſſed ſede of oure Lorde Jeſu Chriſte.

               SUche faith in chriſt Jeſu as we now haue ſpoken of, dyd the holy father Adam (no doute) teache hys chyldrē: that they alſo myghte plante in to theyr chyldren the promes of god, his mercy and deuyce concernynge the Meſſias or Sauioure, that was for to come. And truly Abell had ſuche a notable fayth in god, that the holy Apoſtle Paul wrote of hym after thys maner. Thorowe faytheHebre. xi. dyd Abell offre a greater ſacrifice thē dyd Cain & therby opteyned he wytneſſe that he was ryghteous. For god bare recorde to hys gyftes. In aſmuche then as it can not be denyed, but that all they whych are iuſt & ryghteous, he made ryghteous thorow the bleſſed ſede. And Abell was iuſtifyed. It foloweth that he was made ryghteous thorow fayth in Jeſus Chryſte. InSacrifice was a token o
                        •
                      thankfulneſſe. that he dyd ſacrifice, it is a token & frute of a hart that was thankfull and feared God. It was no ſuche interpryſe, that he wolde clenſe and make hym ſelfe accepte vnto God thorow that outward ſacrifice For certayne it is, that no outward oblacion purifieth man wythin. But the grace of god graunted vnto vs thorowe Jeſus

Chriſt / purifieth vs a right. And the out, warde ſacrifices of the olde fathers, beſyde that they were tokens of thankfulneſſe prayſe and magnifyenge of God, as it is ſayde afore were figures of the onely perpetuall ſacrifice of our ſauiour Chriſte And in this behalfe they were euē aſmoche as ſacramentes of thinges to come. Thus alſo and in lyke vnderſtondynge haue oure firſt fathers done ſacrifice, as hereafter it ſhall folow more largely

He was alſo innocent▪ veriuous and frendly, and folowed not hys owne tentacions. And for thys faithes ſake dyd hys ſacrifice pleaſe God: but Caines pleaſed hym not for hys hert was not right with God: he was a diſſembler, gredye & vnfaithfull perſonne which ſet hys hert and mynde vpon erthlye thynges, allwaye deſpyſinge.

For Cain alſo exhorted he from hys purpoſe & ſayd Thou nedeſte not to arme the becauſe of thy brother, for thou haſte none occaſyon to be angry wyth hym. For yf thou doeſte ryght, thou ſhalte fynde it, and haue ioye therof, but yf thou doeſt not ryght, then is thy mysfortune, ſynne and treſpace opon and thou ſhalte ſhame & deſtroye thy ſelfe.

Therfore became he alſo an enſample of the immortalite of the ſoule and reſurrection of the bodye, and that all goddes ſeruauntes ſhalbe ſaued after thys lyfe. For thus ſayeth the ſcripture. And in aſmuche as he aplyed hym ſelfe toGeneſi. v. walke after god, god toke hym away and he was nomore ſene. The holye Apoſtle Paule alſo in the, xi, chapter to the Hebrees ſpeakethe very excellently of Enochs fayth, ſo that no man may doute, but that he had reſpecte to the bleſſed ſede, & pleaſed god thorow Chriſt.
               Moreouer, the enemyte betwene the children of god and of man (that is the yſſue of the ſerpent) grew euer more and more: ſo that on the one ſyde the multitude of god increaſed, & on the other ſyde the multitude of the deuyll. Jet at the laſt, the multitude of the wycked was greateſt▪
               
               For whan the chyldren of god wyth helde not them ſelues from the chyldren of the worlde▪ but toke wyues and huſbandes amonge them, they begat roughe people, which had no fayth at all, and lyued only after theyr owne luſte and tentatiō, forgat

God vtterly, and regarded not the hundreth & twentye yeares which God gaue them to amende. Therfore was God conſtrayned,the wrath of God vpon the wycked. ſo to puniſhe the vnfaithfull worlde ones, that all poſterities vnto the ende of the worlde myght haue a terrible enſaple of the iuſt wrath of God: whereby they myght lerne, how vngodlyneſſe & vnrighteouſneſſe diſpleaſeth God. Thus the Lorde brought the floude vpon all the erth, oaerthrew all that ſtode vp, and deſtroyed euery thynge that had lyfe, whan the worlde had ſtonde now a thouſande, ſire hundreth and ſixe and fyftye yeare, For ſo many yeares fynde we in the fi

Now yf we reken the yeares of the olde fathers in the fifth chapter vntyll Adam, we ſhal fynde the forſayde ſumme. And thus the yſſne of the ſerpent had an ende, and all vngodly and vn righteous lyuynge was myghtely ſuppreſt and deſtroyed of God,
               And in thys horrible deſtruction of the vngodly, was faithfull Noe ſaued (he beynge the eight (and preſerwed in the Arke thorow the grace and mercy of God Here oure holy true Chriſtē faith had the victory and triumphed. For Noe was of oure fayth, euen of the ſede of God, & put hys truſt in the bleſſed ſede oure Lorde Jeſus. Yee the Arke or ſhyppe of Noe was a figure of Chriſt, as we maye eaſely vnderſtande by the wordes of ſaynt Peter.

Noe alſo was he, with whome God firſt renued the couenaūt made with Adam. For it is but 
                     •
                  one couenaunt onely euen the foreſayde promeſſe & ende made by God vnto Adam. Howe beit the ſame couenaunte was afterwarde at certayne tymes renewed by reaſon of certayne occaſions. Here myght Noe haue thoughte that all the worlde and all men ſhuld vtterley haue bene vndone, for as moche as the Lorde ſayde: I am determyned to deſtroye all fleſh. Therfore immediatly he addeth moreouer and ſayeth: But with the will I ſet vp my couenaunt, that is to ſaye, what ſoeuer pertayneth to my couenaunt, and what I haue promyſed Adā already, the ſame wyll I ſurely and conſtantly make good: and thoughe I nowe deſtroye the worlde, yet wyll I perfourme my trueth thorow the. For I wyll preſerue the alyue, that the bleſſed ſede promyſed afore, maye here after be borne of the in hys generation. To thys dyd Noe truſt, &The ſacrifice of Noe. was preſerued of God thorow Chriſt. Moreouer whan he was come out of the Arke, he dyd ſacryfice, and therby declared the thankfulneſſe of hys hert and beleue, how that he knew that he had all good of hod, which ſhuld alſo geue him a ſede, that with ſacrificinge of him ſelf ſhuld recōcyle pacifie god. For thus ſaieth the ſcripture
               
                  Noe buylded an altare vnto the Lorde,Gene. viii and toke of all maner of cleane beaſtes & foules, and offred brent ſacrifice vnto the Lorde: and the Lorde ſmelled the ſwete ſauou

Wherby euery man maye lerne and ſe, that the ſwete ſmel of the outward ſacrifice of Noe, dyd not chefely pacifye God, and was pleaſaunt: but rather that thorow the bodely ſacrifice, was figured the ſacrifice of Chriſt, and for hys ſake was he mercifull vnto the worlde. ForMath. iii. ouer Chriſt he ſayd at Jordan whā Chriſt was baptyſed: Thys is my deare beloued ſonne, in whome I am pacified or reconcyled.

The firſt pertayneth to mariage and bringynge vp of chyldren, in the whiche is comprehended all, that is written concernyng nurtour, clenlyneſſe and temperaunce, of care and bryngynge vp of chyldren in the feare of God, vertue, obedience and lerninge. The ſeconde forbybddeth violence and diſeate, namely, that no man ſhall eate bloude. For it is a figuratyue precepte, commaundynge, that no man get hys lyuynge by

murthur, by oppreſſyng the poore, by vſury, by extorcion, by falſhode and diſceate. Moreouer all thynges lyuynge were ſubdued vnto hym, and all meates were permitted hym. In concluſion, what ſoeuer concerned to loue God and their neyghboure, the ſame is here renewed vnto Noe and his chyldren, and requyred of them.
               Of Noe came afterwarde all people, yea amonge hys thre ſonnes Japhet SemThorowe Noe was the world replenſhed and Cham he had both the ſede of God & of the froward ſerpent, that is, ſoche as had reſpecte vnto God, and them alſo that regarded the deuell.

               By this is it good to vnderſtande, that our holy Chriſten faith is elder then anye other. For here maye we ſe clearly, that after a thouſand and certayne hundreth yeares (almooſt in the eight hundreth or nyneThe faith of the heithē is ydolatry and worſhyppynge of ymages▪ Gene. x

For curſed Cham was the begynnynge of the Egipciās, and Nimroth the vngodly extorcioner and tyraūte was the firſt founder of the kingdome of Babilon, which kyngdome with the buyldinge of a mightie tower, ſet forth his pryde.

the hande of God declared it ſelfe immedyatly, as it is red in the eleuenthe chapter of Geneſis. Summa, in the generation of Cham had the ſerpent great power: howebeit in the poſterite of Japhet alſo (of whome the Almaynes come) and in the poſterite of Sem, he had hys yſ

               Of the progenie of Sem were borne Abrahā, Iſaat, and Jacob. Gene. xi. And as it is ſayd afore, the ſyncere fayth was ſomewhat darkyned in Caldea: therfore dyd God call Abraham out from the ydolatrie, and renewed wyth hym the old true Chriſten fayth begonne wyth Adam, and ſayde. Geneſis .xii. Get the out of thy coū

Thys dothe Paull declare in the iii. to the Galathiaus, and ſayeth. In thy ſede whyche is Chriſte. Therfore was the ſame now an other renewyng of the promeſſe of Chriſte the bleſſed ſede. For fyrſt whā he promiſed vnto Adam, afterwarde was the promes renewed wyth Noe, and now wyth Abraham. And al thys now is but one promes, one ſauioure, and one fayth. Abrahā alſo beleued in Jeſus chriſtAbrahās fayth. and was ſaued by fayth. For Jeſus chriſt ſayeth hym ſelfe in the eyghte Charter of

Johan. Abraham ſawe my daye, and reioyſed. What is now the daye of Chryſte but the clearneſſe of ye holy goſpell? This lyght had he not bodely, but ſawe it wyth the eyes of fayth, and the ſame made hym ioyfull and ſaued hym. For Chryſte is the true ioye of troubled conſciences. Thus became Abraham the father of all faythfull beleuers. Roma. iiii. And yf we beleue and do as Abrahā dyd, then are we Abrahams chyldren, and ſhall reſt wyth him in hys boſome, euē in the kyngdome of God Luke .xiii. xvi. xix. Mat. viii. Paull alſo to the Galathians in the .iii. chapter ſayeth: Yf ye be Chryſtes, then are ye Abrahams ſede, and heyres accordynge to the promes Out of thys fayth in Chriſt, dyd Abrahā Chriſtē workes, For with a good wyl leftAbrahās Chriſten workes. he hys own natyue countre, all ydols and all ymages: all myſfortune honger & miſerye toke he paciently: he was not harde agagynſt Loth hys neuye, but ioparde his body and lyfe for the oppreſſed: he was liberall, mercyfull, & harberous: he prayed feruēty vnto God for the poore ſynners: he ſuffred oppreſion violence & wronge, and for Gods ſake alſo he thought to ſacrifice and offre vp hys own mooſt dearly beloued ſonne Iſaac.

                  Here alſo is it manifeſt, that our holyThe faith of the Jewes. faith is elder then the Jewiſh faith. For the Jewes do boaſte them ſelues of the Circumciſion, and becauſe they are called Jewes and Iſrael, and that the lawe the preſthode and the gods ſeruyce was geuen vnto them And yet Gene xv. and .xvii. and Roma. iiii. is it euydent, that Abrahā was gods frende and iuſtified or made righteous, or euer he was circūcyſed. For whan he was circuncyſed, he was. 99. yeare old Gene. xvii. Nowe was the promes made vnto hym many yeares afore. The ſcripture alſo ſayeth planely: Abraham beleued God, & the ſame was coūted vnto him for righteouſneſſe. Geneſi. xv. So was it many yeares after, or euer Iſrael & Juda was borne, of whome they haue taken their name The lawe alſo was geuen. 430 yeares after the promes, as Paull madeHow olde the Chriſtſten fayth is. the rekenynge. Gala. iii. It foloweth therfore that oure chriſten fayth is. 2048. yeares elder then the Circūciſion, and. 2449. yeare elder then the lawe, the preſthode & ceremonies of the Jewes. For from Adam vnto the floud, were. 1656. yeares. And frō the floude vntill the departynge of Abraham out of Caldea. 363. yeares. From that tyme are rekened. 430. yeares vntyll the departynge of Iſrael out of Egipte. And on the. 50. daye after the departinge, was the lawe geuen vnto Iſrael vpon mounte Sina, Exo. 19. 20. And after certayn dayes was the preſthode & ceremonies appoynted them. Where as God then made a couenaunt

with Abrahā, whan he ordeyned the circunciſion, It ſerueth more to the cō
                  firmacion of oure holy chriſten faith, then to the mayntenaunce of the Jewiſh ceremonyes.
               Iſaac and Jacob were Abraham chyldren,The faith of Iſaac & Jacob. not onely after the fleſh, but alſo after the ſprete. For they had the fayth of their father and graundfather Abraham, put their truſt onely in god thorow Jeſus Chriſt, and lyued a ſober & vertuos lyfe. Of thys doth the ſcripture beare them recorde thorow out: Jea Jacob, whome the Lorde alſo called otherwyſe Iſraell (of whome afterward all the people of God receaued the name Iſrael) had many vyſions of the Lorde Chriſt as with the ladderGe. xxviii that ſtode vpon the erth, the toppe reachynge to heauē, on the which the angels of god wente vp and downe. For herewithJacob ſawe, that chriſt onely is the waye to heauen. was repreſented vnto hym the Lord Jeſus, whiche is the waye vnto heauē, the trueth and lyfe, without whome no man commeth vnto the father. Upon the viſion of Jacob ſayeth he alſo hym ſelfe. Joh. i. Uerely Iſaye vnto you: hēce forth ſhall ye ſe the heauen open, and the aungels of god goynge vp and downe vpon the ſonne of man. And ſo conſtant was Jacob in remembryng the ſame, that afterward at the commaundement of the Lorde, he ſet vp in the ſame place an altare, no dout (as it is ſayde afore) for a figure of the croſſe and ſacrifice of Chriſt. and there honoured he and worſhipped the Lorde, he

commaunded all hys people alſo, that they ſhulde forſake ſtraunge goddes, and geue him the ydols that they had brought with them out of Meſopotamia, & he buryed them vnder an Oke that ſtode beſyde Sichem, Gene. xxxv. And whan he wolde now dye, he prophecied very clearly of the lord Chriſte, how he ſhulde be borne out of the kynred of Juda, and that he ſhuld be born the ſame tyme that the kyngdome ſhulde be taken from Juda. Whiche thyng alſo came to pas in Herodes tyme. For in the xxxii. yeare of the raygne of Herode, was Chriſte borne at Bethleē in Jewry. Wher of the wordes of Jacob are theſe: The ſceptre ſhall not be taken awaye from Juda, ner a ruler from hys fete, tyll Schilo come (that is to ſaye, the ſauioure, and he in whome all nations ſhalbe bleſſed) and the people ſhall fall vnto hym. This ſtedThe faith of Joſeph faſt fayth of Jacob dyd Joſeph folow alſo which mortified hys owne fleſh, declared patience in aduerſite & preſon, and exercyſed great iuſtice and equyte in hys gouernaunce. He was a figure of oure Lord Jeſus Chriſte, who alſo beynge folde of hys owne vnto the Heythen, preſerued hys brethren alyue. So that from the begynnyng of the worlde vntyll the death of Joſeph, the righte Chriſten fayth endured. 2300. yea res. And thus all holy patriarkes before the lawe, were ſaued, not thorowe the lawe, ner by their owne ſtrength and deſeruynge, but▪ thorowe the bleſſed ſede oure Lorde Jeſus Chriſt,

For the whiche cauſe alſo they were ſore oppreſt a longe ſeaſon, howbeit there remayned yet many excellent men, whiche kepte ſtyll the olde faith and hated the abhominations of the Egiptians.

Now can no man deſyre to ſuffre with Chriſte, except he haue know lege of Chriſtes ſufferynge. Therfore Moſes in the myddes of all perſecution had know lege of Chriſte, & the fayth in Chriſte. So is there no doute, but moo vertuous people had thys true fayth, whiche were all oppreſſed and vexed in Egypte, lyke as

afterwarde the right faithfwll beleuers were ſomwhat more perſecuted: as amōg the Heythen in the tymeof the Judges and kynges of Juda and Iſrael: vnder kynge Antiochus: vnder the Emperous. Nero: Traianus / Domitianus / Maximianꝰ / Julianus and other. As for the vnbeleuers / they in ſuche myſerable tymeys receaued the reward of theyr vnthankfulneſſe, diſobedience, ydolatrie, and blaſphemye.
               But whan the appoynted tyme came whych god had forſene and opened vnto Abraham. Gene. xv. he brought the people of Iſraell by Moſes out of Egypt, wyth and thorowe great wonders and tokens. By the whych he fyrſt declared hys power then hys louyng kyndneſſe and mercy towarde hys owne, and hys terrible iuſtice and vengeaunce agaynſte hys enemyes: Wherby all the worlde myghte knowe, that there was none other iuſt & true god ſaue the God of Iſraell, in whoſe hande onely conſiſte all thynges, whyche alſo of hys mere mercy preſerueth hys owne, and wyth ryght indgement rewardeth hys enemyes. Specially thys is mooſte wonderfull, that in thys great buſyneſſe & worke he hath ſo myghtely ſet forth the redemption perfourmed by oure Lorde Jeſus Chryſte, yea and expreſſed it to be a very myghty redemption. For the ſame nyght (whan they ſhulde departe awaye and beThe Eaſter lambe dyſpatched in the mornyng) the Lord commaunded them to kyll a lambe, and wyth the bloud therof to ſprinkle the dores and

poſtes of the houſe. So whan the aungell that in the ſame night ſlew the fyrſt borne of the Egyptians, ſawe the bloude, he ſhuld do no harme, and ſley no man therin. Exo, xii. Now te ſtifyeth Paul .i. Cor. v that Chriſt Jeſus is our Eſter lambe and paſſeouer▪ So ſayeth S. Johā. Beholde, the lambe of God, whyche taketh awaye the ſynne of the worlde. Therefore were not the Iſraelytes ſpared becauſe of the bloud of beaſtes, but for the bloudes ſake of the bleſſed ſede that was promyſed for to come. And thus the whole delyueraūce out of Egypt was a figure of the true redemption, by the whych we are delyuered from the power of the deuell & from euerlaſtynge death thorow Jeſus Chriſte, and brought into the lande of promes, euen to eternall ioye and ſaluation, whyche God promyſed vnto our fathers Adā, Noe, Abraham, Iſaac, and Jacob.
               Now whan the Lorde had caried hys people out of Egipt, and brought thē thorow the reed ſee drye ſhode, and had drowned Pharao wyth all hys people, he commaunded hys folke to prepare and clenſe thē ſelues at moūt Sina. For he wold binde hymſelfe vnto them, receaue them as hys owne people, and gaue them hys lawThe genynge of the lawe. and ordynaūce. Which thing he alſo dyd and appoynted hys law himſelfe, ſpake it wyth hys owne mouth, and wrote it with hys owne fyngers in two tables of ſtone. In the one & fyrſt table he ordeyned foure commaundementes, concernynge the wor

ſhippe and loue of God: Namely, that weThe fyrſt table. ſhulde take hym onely for the true & right God, and none els beſyde or excepte hym: That we ſhuld worſhip and honoure hym onely, and in no wyſe to haue anye other God, cōforte nor hope.

And that we ſhuld halow the Sabbath daye. In the other table ordeyned he ſixe commaundementes concerninge man. And lyke as the ſoure firſt are comprehended in theſe wordes: Thou ſhalt loue the Lord thy God with all thy hert. &c. Euen ſo are the ſixe conteyned in theſe wo

oughte that was not afore in the worlde, but rather renewed the olde: and the lawe that he hytherto had wryttē in the hartes of holy men, now whā the people had gotten them ſtony hartes, he wrote the ſame in tables of ſtone. For that we oughte to worſhyppe and ſerue God onely, and haue none other goddes, the ſame dyd the holy fathers ſo beleue & kepe, that all theyr cōuerſacion & doyng beareth recorde therof.

For manifeſt is the chaiſt acte of Joſeph, which wolde not touch hys maiſtersThe lawe written in ſtone was fylled afore. wyfe, nor deſyre her. Wherfore in theſe commaundementes is nothynge written or requyred, that was not alſo requyred of the fathers afore the lawe, & perfourmed thorow true fayth in Chriſte. The Lorde therfore beganne no new thyng with his people, whan he delyuered them the tables of the law: Onely he wolde brynge in to a ſhorte ſumme and ſet in wrytynge, all the lawe that the feathers had (but not together ner comprehended in a ſumme) to the intent that they ſhuld the leſſe be forgotten of the people, which thorow their dwellynge in Egipte amonge ydolaters & falſe beleuers, were brought in to ſore offence and ſlaunder. Thys muſt now be rectified agayne after thys maner. As for all the lawes and ordinances, whiche afterward were added vnto theſe two tables, they were not ioyned ther vnto as principall lawes, but as by lawes, for the declaracion and better vnderſtondynge of the ten chapters or commaundementes. For the perfecte ſumme of all lawes, the very righte rule of godlyneſſe, of god ſeruyce, of righteouſneſſe, of good and euell conuerſacion, is comprehended already in the two tables.

Hitherto is it declared and promyſed vnto the holy fathers, that they ſhal be ſaued thorow the bleſſed ſede out of the very grace of God, and for none of their owne deſeruinges: but now are written lawes which commaunde and forbyd vs, as though we thorow oure owne workes and deſeruinge (as namely yf we kepe theſe commaundementes) ſhulde be ſaued and accepte vnto God. Where is nowe Chriſt Where is the faith of the Patriarkes? Here is nothinge heard of faith, but moche, yee onely of workes?
               Anſwere. This obiection hath diſceauedAnſwere, many, that they haue had no right opinion and faith of the grace of God & oure righteous making. Therfore wyl we now geue no anſwere out of our ſelues, but ſet forth holy Paul, & let hym anſwere, that the anſwere maye be the more ſure, & the better eſtemed. Paul in the .iii. chapter to the Galathians wryteth after this maner Deare brethren, I will ſpeake after the maner of men, whan a mans teſtament is confirmed, no man doth lightely regarde or deſpyſe it, ner addeth oughte therto. Now were the promiſes made vnto Abraham and to hys ſede, He ſayeth not: In the ſedes, as in many, but as in one: And in thy ſede, which is Chriſt. All theſe are Pauls wordes, and the meanyng of them is: For aſmoche as the teſtamentes or wor

kes of men, are of ſuche reputacion in the worlde, that whan they are made, ordeyned and confyrmed, no man darre adde oughte to them, or mynyſhe any thyng frō them, but euery man muſte let them be as they are of them ſelues: It is muche more reaſon that gods Teſtamēt or bequeſt remayneGods Teſtament. ſtyll, and that nothyng be added to it, or taken from it. Now dyd God make a teſtament or bequeſt wyth Abrahā and promiſed hym therin, that he woulde geue hym a ſede, in whom he & hys childrē ſhuld be ſaued. And the ſame ſaluatiō dyd he expreſly appoynte in one, and not in many. Wherfore we muſt adde nothynge vnto gods bequeſt, ſeyng he hath promyſed vs ſaluation in Chriſt only, and not in many (that is to ſaye, in no creature, not in our owne power and workes of the law) nether muſt we thinke, that the law was afterwarde added to the intent as thoughe Chryſte were not able to ſaue vs, or as though we myghte opteyne ſaluation by oure owne workes oute of the lawe. For thus foloweth it in Paull word to word: Thys teſtamēt, I ſaye) whych afore was confyrmed to Chriſtward, is not dyſanulled or made of none effecte by the Lawe (whyche was geuen beyonde foure hundreth yeares ther after). For yf the enheritaunce be gotten by the Lawe, then is it not geuen by the promes. But God gaue it frely vnto Abraham by promes. Theſe are Pauls wordes, out of the which euery man maye vnderſtande, that to the generacion

of man, ſaluacyon is geuen onelySaluatiō
                   o
                     •
                   the grace of God thorowe the promes, and thorow no deſeruyng at all. And that the law of the promes (that is to ſaye, the bequeſt and Teſtamēt of god) is nothing mynyſhed, but that the ſumme remayneth wythout blemiſhe, namely, that ſaluacion is geuen vs frely.
               But here myght one aſke: Seyng thatObiectiō. the ſaluation is clearly ynough expreſſed afore the law, and is aſcribed onely vnto the grace of God, why woulde God then adde the lawe? why was he not contente wyth the Teſtament alone? Therfore folowethAnſwere, it nowe in Paull. Why then ſerueth the lawe? It was added bycauſe of tranſgreſſion, tyll the ſede came that was promiſed. Theſe are Pauls wordes whyche are thus to be vnderſtande. The lawe was not geuen becauſe of the promes to make it of none effecte, and to teache that men are ſaued by workes, and not thorow the grace and free lyberalyte of God: but it was geuen becauſe of tranſgreſſion that is to ſaye, becauſe that the people of God in Egypte hadde tranſgreſſed thewhy the lawe was geuen. waye and truethe of theyr Fathers, and knewe nomore what was ſynne, ryghte or vnryghte, wherein ſtode ſaluacion or dampnation: for they were corrupte thorowe the longe dwellynge amonge the Ydolaters of Egypte. Therfore dyd God ordeyne them the Lawe, oute of the whyche they myghte lerne the wyll of God, what Synne, ryghte or vnryghte is,

and to know them ſelues, to go in to them ſelues, and to conſydre, how that the holy workes wyche God requyreth, are not in theyr owne power, for the whych cauſe all the worlde haue greate nede of a mediatoure. And thus the lawe was geuen to furthur the promes, namely that we thorowe the lawe myghte be led onely vnto Chryſte. For thus folowethe it in Pauls wordes. And it was geuen of Aungels by the hande of the mediatoure. A mediatour is not a Mediatour of one onely, but god is one. Is the lawe then agaynſte the promyſes of God? God forbyd. Howbeit yf there had bene geuen a law whych coulde haue geuen lyfe, then no doute ryghteouſnes ſhulde come of the law. But the ſcripture hath ſhutte vp all vnder ſynne, that the promiſe ſhoulde come by the faythe on Jeſus Chryſte, geuen vnto them that beleue. Before fayth came (that is to ſay, Jeſus Chriſt in whome we beloue) we were kepte and ſhutte vp vnder the lawe, vnto the fayth whyche ſhulde afterwarde be declared. Thus was the lawe oure ſcolemaſter vnto Chryſt, that we myght be made ryghteous by fayth. &c. By theſe wordes of Paul may euery man vnderſtande now for what cauſe the lawe was geuen, and howe it is not contrary to the promes of the foreſayd ſede, but rather bryngeth vs from oure ſelues and from all creatures only vnto Jeſus Chriſt. The law therfore confyrmeth the fyrſte promes concernyng, the bleſſed ſede, & teacheth that we opteyne

all ſaluacion in hym onely. Howbeit it isThe lawe is the rule to lyue by alſo a rule of oure lyfe, enfourmynge vs what we ought to do, and what we ought to leaue vndone. Yet on oure ſyde is all vnfruteful, where faith is not. But where faith is, it ceaſſeth not thorowe loue to worke good accordynge to the law: all honoure, and prayſe beynge referred vnto God, to men nothyng but vnperfectneſſe.
               God alſo amonge hys people wrought many thynges, wherby he ſet the cauſe of Jeſus Chriſte clearly a fore the eyes of the people, as it is expreſſed afore by the lande of the Paſſeouer. Lykewyſe is it where as Moſes hanged vp as ſerpent in the wilderneſſe, that al they whiche were ſtonge and poyſoned of ſerpentes, ſhuld beholde the braſen ſerpent hangynge, & not dye, but be ſaued alyue. Where as doutleſſe the outward beholdynge of the braſen ſerpent, ſaued not them that were poyſoned: but it was God, whiche wolde ſo declare, that hys ſonne ſhulde be hanged vpon a croſſe, to the intent that euery one whiche were poyſoned and defyled by the olde ſerpente and ſynne, ſhulde beleue in the ſonne of god, and lyue in hym. For ſo is it written, Sapien. xvi. They had a token of healthThe braſen ſerpēt accordinge to the commaundemente. For who ſo conuerted, was not made whole by the outwarde thynge whiche he ſawe, but (by the) whiche art the reſtorer of health & Sauiour of all. And yet ſaieth Chriſt more clearly. Joh. iii. And lyke as Moſes ſet vp the ſerpent in the wilderneſſe euē ſo muſt

the ſonne of man belifte vp, that whoſoeuer beleueth in hym, ſhulde not periſhe, but haue eternall lyfe.
               And as touchyng thys, the holy Apoſtle Paul bringeth in another ſentence .i. Cor. x. and ſayeth: Brethren, I wolde not haue you ignoraunt of thys, that oure fathers were all vnder the cloude, and all paſſed thorow the ſee, and were all baptiſed vnderChriſte is the rock. Moſes in the cloude and in the ſee, and dyd all eate one ſpirituall meate, & dronke of one ſpirituall drynke. But they dranke all of the ſpirituall rocke, that folowed thē which rocke was Chriſt.
               Beſydes thys, yf we conſidre the declaratiō of the lawes of the firſt table (which teacheth how we ſhall behaue oure ſelues right towarde God, to loue, worſhyppe & honoure hym, to ſerue hym and to cleue onely vnto hym) we ſhall fynde in the ſame fyrſt table, the whole cauſe of Chriſt. For all that afterward was ordeyned and appoynted concernynge the tabernacle, the preſthode and the oblations, parteyneth to the ſumme of the firſt table, for aſmocheQueſtion as the ſcripture and the mouthe of God calleth it hys lawe, precepte, commaundement, vſe and ſtatute, ordinaunce and ſeruyce, And yf thou aſke: howe can god whiche is a ſprete, be ſerued without, warde▪ viſible, and fleſhly thynges, as the foreſayde ceremonyes of the Jewes are? I anſwere: Suche outwarde rytes of the peopleAnſwere. of God were ſacramentes and tokens of heauenly inuiſible good thynges, andwere

not the heauenly ryches them ſelues. Wherfore, they nether ſerued ner pleaſed God, that vſed and dyd ſoche ſeruyce without fayth and lyftinge vp of the mynde. But they that put their truſt in God cleuynge onely vnto hym, and lyftinge vp their hertes hygher, and remayned not in the vyſible thynge, thoſe pleaſed god. WhereOne altar what it ſignified. as they had but one altare and one place appoynted where they ſhuld do ſacrifice It ſignified the croſſe of oure Lorde Jeſus Chriſte, and that he ſhulde be offred vp but ones (and that in one place) for the ſyn ne of the worlde. Therfore where as the hye preſt alſo euery yeare wente in to the inwarde tabernacle with bloude, It ſignified, that oure Lorde Jeſus ſhulde come in to thys worlde, and ſhed hys bloud ones for all, to forgeue and clenſe our ſynnes▪ and ſo to aſcende vnto heauen, Yee all obletions and all ſheddinges of bloud in the ſacrifices of the olde fathers, ſignified the death of oure Lorde Jeſus Chriſte. NoNote this well thynge was clenſed amonge them with out bloud, whiche ſignifieth, that all the pourgynge of oure vnclenneſſe is done by the bloude of Jeſus Chriſte. And all the yreſthode whiche was ordeyned for to teache, to praye and make interceſſion, to offre and do ſacrifice, repreſented the office of oure Lorde Chriſte: Whiche came in to thys worlde, to teach vs the trueth & righteouſnes: Then to offre hymſelfe to the father for our ſynnes, and after the ſacrifice done, to ryſe vp agayn frōdeath, to aſcēde

               Out of all thys is it eaſye to vnderſtōd,Why the ceremonies of the law were geuen. howe that theſe rytes & ceremonies of the fathers, were ſacramentes, and geuen to the people of god, Not that they with the lettre and outwarde viſyble, and corporall thynge ſhulde ſufficiently ſerue God whiche is a ſprete, but that they ſhuld lift vp their myndes aboue the ſame to the ſpirituall thynges, pondrynge the mercy of God: out of the whiche he beynge moued, is become gracious vnto vs. And whan he might haue damned vs for oure ſynnes and myſdedes, he ſpared vs for hys ſonnes ſake, whome he gaue vnto death, and hys innocent death hath he accepted for our ſynnes.

In the fyrſte verſe Dauid knowlegeth the perſonnes in the holy Trinite, the godheade alſo and the eternall kyngdome of Chriſte.

Lorde. Now is it certayne and vndenyable, that he which ſpeaketh, & he to whomought is ſpoken, are not one, but two perſonnes. Yet is ther but one Lorde and god, and they both (the father that ſpeaketh, and the ſonne to whome is ſpoken) are the Lord, therfore are they one, of one ſubſtaunce and beynge, they very true god.
               Nether is the ſonne leſſe then the father, There can alſo none be a father, except he haue a ſonne or a chylde. Now is the euer laſtyng father God, therfore is the ſonne alſo euerlaſtynge. There is alſo but one onely euerlaſtinge without begynnynge. Both the father and the ſonne are eternal without begynnynge, therfore are they one onely true God with the holy gooſte. Lyke as Johan alſo ſayeth: In the begynnynge (that is to ſaye, from euerlaſtinge) was the worde, and the worde was with God, and the worde was god. And immediatly therafter ſayeth he, that the worde is Jeſus Chriſte our Lorde. For it foloweth.The faith of Dauid in Chriſte The worde became fleſhe. Therfore doth Dauid alſo call the ſonne of god ſpecially hys Lorde, ſayenge: The Lorde ſayde vnto my Lorde. And therfore calleth he Chriſte hys Lorde, becauſe he confeſſeth and beleueth, that he is hys very naturall Lorde and god, as Thomas alſo dyd knowlege: My lord and my god. Joh. xx. Afterwarde calleth he hym hys Lorde, becauſe that after the nature of man, he ſhulde be borne out of hys loynes. For thorow out all the ſcripture is our Lorde, Jeſus

called the ſōne of Dauid. And thus bothe Dauid knowlege two natures in Chriſt, the nature of God and the nature of man.

And lyke as a kynge ouercommeth hys enemyes wyth a battayle, and couereth the whole playne wyth deed bodyes, viſiteth alſo and ſmyteth the head of the warre, & the head cycie of the enemies.

is then any thynge iuſtructe in the Prophetes, hathe no doute conſydred thys in the new teſtamēt, that the apoſtles proue all theyr doctrine of the Lorde Jeſu, out of the lawe and the Prophetes.

               Of the kyngdom of Chriſt, in the which he hym ſelfe alone is kynge, all the world beynge ſubiecte vnto hym, declarynge hys dominion and royall maieſtye, wrytteth Eſaye thus in the ſeconde Chapter. And it ſhall come to paſſe in the laſt tyme, that the hyll of the houſe of the Lorde ſhall be

exalted vpon the hyght of mountaynes aboue all litſ

                   hylles, and all nacions ſhall come together vnto hym, the people ſhall go to him, and ſaye: Come let vs go vp to the mount of the Lorde, euen to the houſe of the God of Jacob, that he maye ſhew vs hys waye, and we wyll walke in hys pathes. For the lawe ſhall come forth frō Sion, and the worde of God from Hieruſalem. In the .vii. of Daniel it is writtē thus: I ſawe a / viſion in the nyght, and beholde there came one in the cloudes of heauen like the ſonne of man, which came to the olde aged, and they brought hymThe kingdome of Chriſt. before hys preſence. And he gaue hym power, glorie, and the kyngdome, and all people, nacions and tonges muſt ſerue him: his power is an euerlaſtyng power, which ſhall not be taken from hys, & hys kyngdome ſhall not periſhe. Eſaye ſayeth in the .ixii. capter: And the Heythen ſhall ſe thy righteouſneſſe, & all kynges thyne honoure, and he ſhall call the by a newe name (O Syon) and the mou

               Of the death and paſſion of Chriſt ſpeaketh Daniel in the .ix. chapter afterThe deth of Chriſt. this maner. And after two and ſixtye wekes ſhall Chriſt be ſlayn & put to death and yet ſhall they haue no true teſtimonye, that he is giltye of death. Eſaye in the .l. chapter ſayeth thus, The Lorde God opened myne eare, and I refuſed it not, nether wente I bacwarde, I gaue my body to the ſmiters, and my chekes to the nyppers, and my face haue I not turned from theyr ſhamefull intreatinge and ſpittynge vpon me. The Lorde God alſo ſhall help me, therfore ſhall I not be confounded. And therfore haue I hardened my face lyke a flynt ſtone, and am ſure, that I ſhall not be confounded. In the liii. chapter there is writtē of Chriſt after this maner, He ſhall haue nether bewtye ner fayrneſſe, we ſhall loke vpon him, but we ſhall haue no deſyre vnto hym.
               
                  He is deſpyſed and contēned of mē, a mā of trouble, and one that hath had experience of infirmyte. He is ſo deſpyſed, that we ſhall hyde our faces from him. and haue hym in no eſtimation. And yet hath he borne oure vnperfectneſſes, and felt oure ſorowes. We alſo thought, that he ſhulde be wounded, ſmy

                  ten and puniſhed of God. But he was wounded for our ſynnes, and ſlayne for oure wyckedneſſe ſake. And the puniſhment wherby we haue peace, is layed vpon him, and thorow his woundes are we made whole. All we haue gone aſtraye lyke ſhepe, euery one of vs hath had reſpecte vnto hys owne waye, and the Lorde hath layed all our ſynnes vpon hym. Uiolence and wrong was done vnto hym, he hath bene euell. intreated. & yet opened he not his mouth. He ſhall be led as a beeſt to be ſlayen, and as a ſhepe domme before the ſherers, ſo ſhall he not open hys mouth. &c. The whole chapter deſcrybeth all the cauſe of Chriſte ſo clearly, that holy Hierome ſayd not in vayne, Eſaye is not onely a Prophet, but alſo an Euangeliſt, zachary deſcrybethThe ſacrifice of Chriſte. the preſthode and ſacrificie of Chriſt and teſtifieth, that with the ſame onely oblacion he hath opteyned grace for all ſynnes, and therfore ſeuē (that is to ſaye, all) eyes ſhall haue reſpecte vnto him, and ſhall ſeke peace & reſt of theyr conſciences in hym, and ſhall fynde it.

In the which teſtimony the holy Apoſtle Peter had a ſpeciall reſpecte to the prophecye of Daniel: whiche dyd not onely recorde the paſſion & glory of Chriſt, but alſo poynted to the tyme, in the which Chriſt ſhuld come. For lyke as God in the greateſt parels, daungers and alteracions, hath alwaye renewed & more clearly expreſſed hys promes conceruyng the bleſſed ſede: as in the tyme of Noe, whan the worlde was deſtroyed: in the tyme of Abraham, whan God wolde prepare hym ſelfe a new people, in the tyme of Moſes, whā God receaued his people and caryed them out of Egipte, to bringe them in to the lande of Canaan, in the tyme of Dauid, whan all thynges ſtode ſo well, and it muſt nedes be auoyded, leſte any man ſhulde thynke Dauid were the bleſſed ſede, Before the captiuite of Babylon alſo, and in the tyme of the prophetes

which (as it is ſayde afore) preached and wrote, that no man ſhulde doute in gods promes, as who ſaye they were geuen vp and caſt a waye, though the temple were broken, the cytye brent, & though the people (of whome Chriſt ſhuld be borne) were led awaye in to captiuite. Euen ſo nowe alſo in the captiuite: whan the faythfull might all mooſt haue thought, that the promes of God concernynge Meſſia, were cleane gone, Euen than dyd God ſhewe hys ſeruaunt Daniel a more cleare viſion of Chriſt, after thys maner, The peopleA prophecye tolde vnto Daniell. ſhalbe let go agayne out of captiuite, and ſhall come home to Hieruſalē, buylde the temple and cytie agayne, but with a ſore tyme.

Yet wyl I adde a ſhorte inſtructiō concernynge the tyme of grace, & perfourminge of all promiſes, and I wyll declare, that God now alſo thorow the appearinge of his ſonne, wolde bringe in to the worlde and ſet forth, none other religion, none other faith, nether anye other ſaluacion, then euen the ſame which was ſhowed to the olde fathers, Sauynge that now all thinges are more euydent, more clerly practiſed accompliſhed, fulfilled and perfourmed, for the whych cauſe alſo all figures, ſacrifices and ceremonies do ceaſſe. ForThe olde teſtament is not to be refuſed in Chriſt is all perfection. Yet ſhall we not therfore caſt awaye the olde Teſtament (as ſome ignoraunt, vnlerned and foolyſh people do) but haue it in greater reputacion, for aſmuch as we know now

thorowe Chriſt, what euery thinge ſignifieth, & wherfore euery thinge was thus & thus ordeyned, vſed, & ſpokē, Now ſhall euery man fyrſt haue a corage to reade the lawe and the prophetes, whā he ſeyth wher vpon euery thyng goeth. And thus alſo at the begynnyng dyd the holy apoſtles preach Chriſt vnto the Jewes out of the lawe and the prophetes, as it is oft tymes mencioned in the actes of the Apoſtles.

               In the .xlii. yeare of the empyre of Auguſtus, after the begynning of the world 3974. yeares was Jeſus chriſt the bleſſed & promiſed ſede, borne of the vndefyled virgin and mayde Mary, at Bethleem in the lande of Jewrye. And though he as a very man was wrapped to clothes, and

layed in the cryb, yet apeareth the angell of the Lord in greate clearneſſe vnto the ſhepherdes, and ſayeth, Feare ye not, beholde I bryng you tidinges of great ioy, which ſhall happen vnto all people. For this daye is borne vnto you the ſauyoure euen Chriſt the lord in the citie of Dauid The firſt newes and tydinges of the commyngeTidinges of Chriſtes birth of our Lord Jeſꝰ Chriſt, muſt the angell brynge and geue, to the intent that it mighte be the more accepte of all the worlde. All the holy men from the begynnynge of the worlde, dyd hytherto longe ſore after the promyſed ſede. Therfore ſaieth the aungell now, that he bringeth them tydinges of great ioye, no doubte to them that were gone, deed, & paſt, to them alſo that now lyued, & to them that were to come afterward. The ioye is this, that Jeſus Chriſt the ſauiour is borne, euē the promiſed ſede, whiche ſhulde ſaue all the world from the power of the deuell, clēſe them from ſynne, and delyuer them from damnacion. Therfore ſayeth the aungell moreouer, Which ſhal happen vnto all people. For vnto Abraham it was ſayd, In thy ſede ſhall all nactons of the erth be bleſſed. The ſame (ſayeth the angell) is borne in the citie of Dauid, euen out of Dauids kynred, out of the whiche the prophetes teſtified that he ſhulde be borne, whiche prophetes alſo for the ſame cauſe called him Dauid and the bloſſome of Dauid.The grace of God And this is now the grace of God, that where as we poore ſynners belōged

vnto death, and were in the deuels bōdes he ſente his ſonne to lowſe and delyuer vs out of captiue, This is the new Teſtament. For Hieremy alſo teſtifieth he

               This full and perfecte forgeueneſſe is not therfore called the newe Teſtamente, as though their had bene no remiſſion of ſynnes promes made longe afore vnto the fathers, is now confirmed and renewed and the old figures that repreſented the ſame are abrogate.

                  e, For the holy gooſt dyd not endew them with a newe

doctryne, but it that the Lord had taught them out of the lawe and the prophetes, the ſame dyd he bringe to their remembraunce and illucidate all thinges, & prynted them more clearly in ther hertes. For ſo ſayeth the. Lorde in the goſpell: The conforter euen the holy goſt, whom theJoh. xiiii. father wyll ſende in my name, he ſhall teache you all thinges and bringe all thynges to youre remembraunce that I haud ſayde vnto you, Therfore ſo longe as the Lorde was with them, and tolde them all the matter of hys paſſion, they were ſorye and coulde not beare awaye all that he ſayd vnto them But after that he was taken vp frome the erth in to heauen, he ſent the holy gooſt, euen him, whome the prophetes alſo had before, & that led them into all Chriſten veryte.
               So whan they were endowed with the holy gooſte, they beganne (accordige to the Lordes commaundemente to preach in all the world / the foreſayde matter of ſaluacion purged, and obteyned onely by Chriſt and gotten by true faith For he had ſayde: Go your waye in to all the world and preach the goſpell vnto all creaturesMar. xvi. Who ſo beleueth and is baptiſed (ſhalbe ſaued &c. And therwith comprendeth he both the poyntes whiche the Apoſtles vſed and practiſed (euen the preachyng of the faith in Jeſus Chriſt, and of the miniſtracion of the ſacramentes, And how the Apoſtles doctryne was it is manifeſt out of the Actes of the Apoſtles: But ſhortly

and in a ſumme, they preached amendement of lyfe. and remiſſion of ſynnes thorow Jeſus Chriſt: That is to ſaye, howe that the whole generacion of man laye in the dominion of the deuel and in ye bondes of ſynne curſed and damned: but God had mercy on vs all, & ſente his ſoone in to this worlde, to dye, and with hys death to reſtore vs vnto lyfe and to waſh vs with his bloude, that who ſo euer beleueth in hym, ſhulde not periſh, but haue eternall lyfe. All this declared they out of the lawe and the prophetes & proued, that, Jeſus Chriſt whome they preached, is the bleſſed ſede promiſed vnto the fathers. Who ſo is deſyrous to haue a perfecte enſample of this declaracion, he fyndeth two ſermons of the famous Apoſtles Peter and Paul, the one in the Actes of the Apoſtles the ſecōde chapter, the other in the. xiii, chap. There doth the holy Apoſtle open the miſtery of our holy faith, very excellently declaringe it from the tyme of Abraham vnto Dauid & from him vnto Jhon the baptiſt. There vpon ſheweth he, how Chriſt ſuffred, dyed was buried, and roſe agayne from death.Act, xiii. All this confirmeth he with the ſcriptures of the prophetes. At the laſt he concludeth the ſermon after this maner: Be it kowen vnto you therfore ye men and brethren, that thorowe Jeſus is preached vnto you forgeueneſſe of ſynnes, and that by hym all they that beleue, are iuſtified from all thynges, from the which ye coulde not be iuſtified by the lawe of Moſes.

And whan Paull poynted them agayne to the true ordinaunce and right vſe, he taketh the ſymple wordes & inſtitucion of Jeſu Chriſt without anye more addicion, and layeth thoſe before them, commaundeth them to folowe the ſame, and holdeth him therwith well content .i. Corinth. xi. And thus dyd the holy Apoſtles gather together all Heythē and people, thorow the preachinge of the goſpell and myniſtracion of the ſacramentes in the church, whoſe heade is Chriſt, in whom they are buylded and preſerued. Morouer they dyd not layed them ſoreThe Apoſtles dyd not ouer charge the people with ceremonies. with any ceremonies. For in the Actes of the Apoſtles the .ii. chap where as a perfecte ſhappe of a right Chriſten congregacion is deſcrybed, we haue fyrſt the 
                     •
                  eudinge of the Apoſtles, amonge whom Peter dyd fyrſt preach the goſpell: that is to ſaye, repentaunce and forgeueneſſe of ſynnes in Chriſt Jeſu. Then baptiſed he thē that were become the people of God. Afterward foloweth it, that they whych were become Chriſten, contynued in the doctryne of the Apoſtles, in prayer, in breakinge of the bred, & in the foloſhippe: Here are the ryght ſubſtanciall poyntes of the Criſten church ſufficiently expreſſed: the doctryne of amendment of lyfe & remiſſion of ſynnes, baptyme, the contynuynge

and increaſyng in Chriſtes doctrine, prayer, the holy ſupper of the Lorde and the feloſhyppe, that is loue, kyndneſſe and workes of mercy.
               Now where as Act. xv. it is ordeynedThe Apoſtles wolde not offende the weake. that the Heythen ſhoulde eate no bloude nor ſtrangled, it endured but for a tyme, and theyr meanyng was therby to a voyde offendynge of the weake. Otherwyſe haue the Apoſtles euery where (ſpecially Paul) very exneſtly exhorted men, to contynue by the doctrine that was ſhewed & delyuered thē, and to be at a poynte in thē ſelues to auoyde ſuche lernynge as was new and brought vp by men, becauſe they leade mē farre frō the trueth, as we fynde Colloſ. ii. Philip. iii. i. Timoth. iiii. vi. and Titum. i. And thus is it manifeſt, that the apoſtles taught al natiōs no newer ſtrauge thyng, but euen the ſame that they had receyued of the Lorde.
