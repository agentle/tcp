            A Replication to that lewde aunſwere, which Fryer Iohn Frauncis (of the Minimes Order in Nigeon nigh vnto Paris in Fraunce) hath made to a Letter, that his Mother cauſed to be written, and ſent to him out of England, in August. 1585. Wherevnto is annexed an aunſwere, to that which the ſame Fryer hath written to his father and mother: in defence, and to the prayſe of that Religion, which he dooth nowe profeſſe: and to the diſprayſe and defacing of that Religion, which is nowe profeſſed in Englande. Whereof the Fryer himſelfe was a Scholler and profeſſor, vntill the yeere 1583. which was the 18. yeere of hys age. (⸪)

            To all ſuch Gentlemen, as beeing Engliſh borne, haue Romyſh hartes, and doo fauoure the Romiſh Catholicke Religion: and eſpecially, ſuch amongſt them as doo inhabite in the Counties of Suſſex and Hampshyre, and about London.
            
            
               WYſhing well to the Common weale of my nature Country, and to the Churche of Chriſt in this our Engliſh nation. I haue in my younger daies taken ſome paynes, & haue béene at ſome charges (and yet am) in the education of ſome ſuch young Schollers, as haue ſéemed to bée likely to prooue profitable members, in this Church, or Common weale of Englande. Amongſt whome, one Samuell Debnam was one. Hys Father and Mother are yet lyuing, and doo by theyr honeſt labor ſuſtayne theyr owne bodies, and according to theyr hability, they doo help to reléeue the impotent and néedy. This Samuell was theyr eldeſt and firſt borne Sonne, and their hope was that he ſhould haue béene the ſtaffe of their age. And becauſe the mother was my ſeruaunt in the time of her virginity, my wyfe became Godmother to that young babe, and (as the cuſtome of the Church is) vndertooke for him at the Fountaine of Regeneration: which mooued both her and mée to haue (together with his naturall Parents) an eſpeciall care for his good education. Hee proſpered in learning, and was like in time, to haue prooued a profitable member of the Engliſhe Common weale. Yea ſome gifts that he had receiued from God, ſéemed to be ſomewhat rare in one of hys yéeres: and that did puſ
                  •
               e him vp and make him proude. I did then beginne to feare, that which is nowe come to paſſe. For (as Syrach hath written Chap. 10,) Initium ſuperbiae hominis, apoſtatare a Deo: quoniam ab eo qui fecit illum, receſſit cor eius. The beginning of mans pride, is to fall away from GOD: for his hart is departed from him that hath made him. This pryde was it that cauſed him to harken to ſuch amongſt you, as firſt enticed him to forſake his Parents, and other fréendes, in ſo vndutiful manner as he did, on Monday▪ which was the eyght day of Apryll. 1583. In aunſwering Letters that his Mother cauſed to bee written to him the 28. day of Auguſt, 1585. Hée wryteth that he was lodged not farre from London, the ſame night that he ſtept away from hys Father and her: and ſhortly

after, hée was (as he ſayth) conueyghed by night, a myle of from London, where hée ſtayed thrée weekes. And on May day in the Morning, carely, hée was ſette on horſebacke, and conueighed into Suffer, and ſo into Hampſhyre, where he had maintenaunce tyll the Euen of S. James the Apoſtle. &c. At his departing from London, good Gentlemen (as he termeth them) gaue him money, to the value of forty or fyftie ſhillinges, to bring him ouer the Seas. By theſe thinges it appeareth manifeſtly, howe vnfréendly you popyſh Gentlemen are, to the Crowne and Common weale of Englande. Can you worke any greater diſpleaſure, to the Crowne & Common weale of England: then to robbe them both of the younge frye, that is likely to bée the continuance of this, and the beginning of the next generation? This youth, béeing about the age of eightéene yéeres, was meete to bée imployed to that kinde of life, wherin he might haue béene moſte like to doo beſt ſeruice to God, his Prince and his natiue Countrey. But ſée what you haue doone▪ you haue cauſed him to be reconciled to the Romiſh Catholicke Churche▪ which is to bée a ſworne enemy, to the Crowne and Common weale of thys his, and your natiue Country. You haue robbed our Prince of her Subiect, and ſeruice that ſhe might and ought to haue had of him, as of one borne with in her dominions. You haue robbed a poore father and mother of theyr ſonne and onely childe: the ſtaffe of theyr age, theyr greateſt treaſure in this world, theyr onely hope of poſterity, and of that gyft of God, which by natural Order hath béene moſt pleaſaunt and delectable to them, and ſhould haue béene moſt profitable, you haue robbed mée, and the reſt that haue taken paynes, and haue beſtowed of our goods vpon him▪ in the nouriſhing and bringing of him vp, to that eſtate wherein you found him: and in making him able to doo ſome ſeruice in the Common weale of our Country: you haue (I ſay) robbed vs of all this, & of that hope which wée had to ſée him a profitable member of the Church of Chriſt in England. you haue robbed hym of that benefit, which a naturall Engliſh man, may▪ and ought to enioye within the Engliſh dominions. yea, & as much as in you may bée: you haue robbed him of that inheritaunce, which Chriſt Jeſus hath bought for him, for you haue perſwaded him, that not Chriſt Jeſus, but the Romiſh Antichriſt, is the way that leadeth into that inheritance. you haue taught him to leaue the ſtudy of the ſcriptures, and not to looke vppon. or to giue credite vnto thoſe wrytinges, that men of ſounde iudgement haue left behinde them, concerning the true interpretation of the ſcriptures, but to beléeue all that the Romyſh Catholicke Church beléeueth▪ holdeth, and teacheth: although he doo neither knowe what the beléefe of that Church is, neither howe it may bée warrented or defended by the ſcriptures, when it is knowne yea, although it doo ſurpaſſe and excell mans vnderſtanding: yet it muſte be beléeued, onely becauſe the Romyſh Catholicke Church dooth beléeue it.

As to make and worſhip Images, to call vppon Angels and ſaints, to repoſe truſt in the worthines of his owne workes, to make himſelfe a Mediator in ſuffering for the ſinnes of his Parents and Country men, to haue an opinion of holines, in refrayning the vſe of Gods good creatures, which are all holy, and to be receiued with thankes to God for the vſe of them, to kiſſe and worſhippe the Reliques of ſaynts, to beléeue the reall preſence of Chriſtes bodie in the Sacrament of the Altare, to make that Sacrament a ſacrifice propi

               iatorie for the ſinnes of the quicke and the deade. &c. To conclude, if the Romyſh Catholicke Church doo teach it, he muſt beléeue it, although both reaſon and ſcripture doo denye it. Into this miſerable blindnes▪ you haue (by your allurements and perſwaſions) brought many youthes, that myght, and were like to haue doone, good ſeruice to God and theyr Prince, in theyr natiue Countrey. you haue cauſed them to ſhake of, all duetifull obedience to God, to theyr Country, to theyr Prince, to theyr parents, and to all that haue béene theyr foſterers and bringers vp, in learning, and in religious exerciſes. you haue plunged them into the puddle of all popyſh ſuperſtition, and counterfayted religion. you haue ſtolen them from our Captaine Chriſt, and made them ſouldiours to fyght againſt Chriſt, vnder the banner of that Antichriſt of Rome. Thus your proſelite hath reported, in the diſcourſe of hys peregrination: that he was in Rhemes in Fraunce, 17. monthes together in company with two hundreth Engliſh men (almoſt) & lacked nothing: which argueth, that ſome good portion of your patrimony, is ſpent in the maintenaunce of ſuch Engliſh youthes, as you haue conueighed thether, and to other places beyond the Seas.
            I wyll charge you no furder. Take héede to your ſelues in time. Conſider that there is a God, that ſéeth your dooinges, and knoweth your intents. He wil not ſuffer ſuch dooings vnpuniſhed for euer. If you think that the religion that is now allowed of in this Realme, by law, be not Catholicke, ſéeke your reſolution at the hands of ſuch as are learned in the tongues, in the liberal artes, in the writings of auncient fathers, and in the ſcriptures, and are your Countrymen, & occupied in the ſeruice of God, & this our cōmon country. Such are able, and wil be ready to conferre with you, and by their knowledge in the ſcriptures, Doctors, artes and tongues, to ſatiſfy you: and vndoubtedly, if you wyll humbly craue it of God, ye ſhall bee ſatiſfyed. Remember your duetye towardes GOD, your duety towardes your prince, your duety towardes your Country and Countrymen.

Helpe to bring home againe ſuch as by your meanes haue béene occaſioned to ſtray from Chriſtes fold in this our natiue ſoyle.

Honour thy father in déede and in ſpéeche, and in all patience, that bleſſing from God may come vpon thée &c.

To followe their precepts and examples of life, & patientlie to take correction at their handes, and to make continuall and hartie praiers to God for them. To relieue and nouriſh them, in caſe they ſhould fal into pouerty or decay. And in all points by ſhewing your ſelfe an obedient and good child, to mooue them to be louing and good to you. All this you confeſſed in my Church before many witneſſes, which ſhall in the day of iudgment be a teſtimonie againſt you, to condemne you of wilfull Apoſtacie, and a witnes to diſcharge your father and mother, (and all others that haue had the education of you) of all maner negligence, in enſtructing you in the knowledge of your duety, both towards God, and towards man.

               You write furthermore vnto me, that you haue made great enquirie after me. I know it well. I was in feare great enough by reaſon of that enquirie, as long as I was in Englande, although (that God be thanked) I haue, though hardly, eſcaped your handes.

               In theſe wordes you make knowne to as many as ſhall reade this your anſwer, both the dutiful care that your good parents

had to preſerue you (their wicked ſonne) from deſtruction bothe of body and ſoule: and alſo your owne wilfull determination, to caſte your ſelfe headlong into that Gulfe of perdition, that you are nowe fallen into. Yea, and that you are of that number that Eſay ye Prophet bewayleth, when he writeth thus in the 5. chap, V aequidicitis malum bonum, & bonum malum: ponentes tenebras lucem, & lucem tenebras, ponentes amarum in dulce, & dulce in amarum. Alas for them that call euill good, and good euill. Affirming darknes to be light, and light to be darkneſſe, turning ſower into ſwéete, and ſwéete into ſower. The bright ſhining light of the knowledge of ye truth, which dooth nowe ſhine in England, you call the darknes of ignorance and errour: and the hellike darknes of Poperie, wherein you doo nowe wander, groping after the way of Saluation, you call light, ſhewing your ſelfe to be one of them that are noted by our Engliſh Prouerbe. They that be in hell, doo perſwade themſelues, that there is none other heauen. Moreouer you ſay thus.

               You heard that I was at Rhemes: it is verie certaine, I was there, the reaſon alſo wherefore I writt not vnto you, was partly the ſcarſitie of meſſengers, and partlie other thinges, which here I can not well rehearſe. Againe, I could not write vnto you conueniently, becauſe I doubted whether you were aliue or dead.

               The report of your béeing at Rhemes, you ſay was true, which argueth yt it was rather ye lacke of good wyl in you, to comfort your ſorrowfull parents by your duetifull Letters, then the lacke of meſſengers that ſtayed your penne. What the other lets were, which héere you can not well rehearſe: I hope you will tell vs at ſome other time more conuenient, and when it ſhall not bee ſo daungerous for you, as nowe it is. And béeing by theſe Letters (that you confeſſe you haue receiued) certifyed that your Parents are lyuing, that doubt that you ſpake of can no longer bee any let at all.

As your father, your mother, my ſelfe, my wife (your Godmother) Maſter Moncaſter, ſometime your Schoolemaſter, Maſter Fielde, Maſter Doctor Fulke, maſter Paule Swallow, and many moe that were your Mecaenates in Cambridge: and howe happeneth it, that all theſe be nowe blotted out of your Cataloge of fréends?

               As for my brother Aaron, I beſeeche our Lord & ſauior Ieſus Chriſt by the merits of his bitter death and paſſion, to haue mercy vpon his ſoule, as alſo vpon yours, and to ſaue you all at the day of iudgement.

               I doo like well of this your charitable wiſhe: and doo wiſhe the like ſaluation to you, and to all the reſt of your newe fréends. But now you doo vſe a ſpéech by the figure Apoſtrophe. And thus you write in the margine of your Letters.
            
            
               
               The Fryar.
               Brother Aaron, leaue the Religion wherein you were at my departure from you: and if that you can by anie meanes come on this ſide the ſeas, come to Paris in Fraunce, and aſke after the Minimes Fryers at Nigeon, ſo ſhall you finde me. If that you come to me, leaue your naughty Religion, & care for no more. And counſell alſo my father and mother, to do as you do (or as I hope wyll doo.)
            
            
               Crowley.
               This goſtlie counſel that you giue to your brother Aaron, and doo wiſh that he ſhould giue ye ſame to your father and mother, will not (I hope) be followed in haſte. That Religion that you call naughtie, and will your Brother Aaron to leaue: ſhall (I hope) be prooued in this my diſcourſe, the right Religion of Chriſte, and your Romaine Religion, méere Antichristian. Now to put your mother out of doubt, that you are her ſonne Sammuell in déede, you wryte thus.
            
            
               The Fryar.
               And foraſmuch as you haue written to me, that you will not giue credite to word of mouth, or to written Letters, except that I write your name (being my mother) and the place of my birth, let theſe ſuffice to ſet your hart at reſt. I was borne (as you haue tolde me) in Eſſex, brought vp and nouriſhed (in hereſye) in London, or in the ſuburbs. Your name is Catharine Maipeston▪
                   by reaſon of mariage, you are called Catherine Debnam. I had a brother named Nathanaell (as you told me) and he is dead being an infant. Moſes and Tobias are alſo dead, with both my ſiſters Abigael, & Christian, (vpon whoſe ſoules Chriſt Ieſus haue mercy.) Aaron was a liue whē I departed from you, vnto whom, as alſo vnto you my mother & to my father John Debnam, I beſeeche Chriſt giue life euerlaſting. Thus much for the anſwere of that Letter which you ſent me, written (as I thinke) by Maſter Kings man the Scriuener.
            
            
               Crowley.
               The carefull hart of your mother, deſired certaine knowledge of the caſe of her fugitiue ſon: ſuppoſing it had not béene poſſible for a nie natural ſon, being a liue, in anie part of ye known world, to hide himſelfe ſo long from ſo louing a mother as ſhe hath béene to you: and therefore ſhe wiſhed to be certified in ſuch ſorte, as nowe ſhe is by theſe your Letters. But ſir, the conſideration of duety towards your mother, ſhould haue mooued you to haue vſed more duetifull

ſpéeches then you haue doone in this parte of your aunſwere. Set your hart at reſt, ſauoureth of contempt of that perſonne that you write vnto (whom God commandeth you to honour) and of an obſtinate purpoſe and determination, neuer to haue anie ſuch regard vnto her, as chriſtian children ought to haue vnto their Parents, ſo long as they ſhall be in this tranſitorie life. It ſéemeth to me that you haue forgotten all that you learned in the Schoole of Chriſt, and haue learned a newe leſſon in the Phariſaicall Schoole at Rhemes: that is (as it maie be thought) to ſhake of all curteſye, both in ſpéeche and behauiour towards Parents, and curriſhly to anſwere Corban. Mark.
                   7. You were borne in Eſſex: but will you know by what occaſion? Your father and mother dwelt then in the ſuburbs of London: but the houſe that they then had, was not furniſhed with things néedefull for a woman in the trauell of childe, and therefore your Grandmother being a Mydwife, tooke your mother home to her houſe at Waltam in Eſſex. And yt as I ſuppoſe by Gods prouidence, that the babe that then was borne, might rightly be termed an Eſſex Calfe, and that our Engliſh Prouerbiall ſpéeche might rightlie be applied vnto him (As wyſe as Waltams Calfe that ranne nine miles to ſucke a Bull▪) You heard tell of the Popes Bull that Felton fyxed to the Biſhop of Londons gates, and like a Waltams Calfe you ranne to Rhemes, and (by your owne confeſſion) would haue runne to Rome, if you had not béene letted, by I knowe not what meane, but by Gods prouidence I am aſſured, that your follie might the more eaſilie bee made knowne vnto vs out of Fraunce, and that you may in ſhorter ſpace, and with leſſe daunger returne to England againe when God ſhall open your eyes, and let you ſée, howe vnwiſelie and like a Waltams Calfe you haue dealt. You were brought vp and nouriſhed you ſay, in Hereſie, in London, or in the Suburbs thereof. As touching this hereſie, that you ſay you were brought vp and nouriſhed in: I ſay with S. Paule Acts. 24.

                  ct which men call hereſie, I do humbly ſerue the God of my fathers: beléeuing all that is written in

the Law and the Prophets: hauing hope in God, which hope euen they themſelues doo looke for, that a reſurrection ſhalbe, bothe of the iuſt and of the wicked. And héerein I my ſelfe doo endeuoure, to haue alwaies a conſcience, both towards God, and towards men. This is that hereſie that you were brought vp and nouriſhed in, in London, and in the Suburbs therof. But I pray you (good maſter Fryer Iohn) was S. Paule an Hereticke? Are your father and mother Heretickes? Was Robert Smith, that firſt taught you to knowe Letters (and is nowe gone to God) an Heretike? Am I an Heretike that firſt taught you to knowe the Rules of Grammer, and taught you and fedde you at mine owne charges, more then ſeauen yéeres firſt and laſt? Are all our Rulers, and wee of the Engliſh nation Heretikes, and our whole kingdome hereticall, becauſe we refuſe to fall downe with you, and worſhip the purple whore of Rome, that rideth vpon the Roſe coloured beaſte? When God ſhall make your gréene witt ryper, and your fléeting iudgment déeper, I hope you iuyll recant that raſh ſaying of yours. I was brought vp and nouriſhed in hereſie. Your mothers Surre name before mariage, you miſtake, for ſhe was not daughter to Maipeſton but to Myllis, and is now by marriage called Catherine Debnam. Your brethren and ſiſters, were as you haue written: and are all departed thys lyfe, ſauing onely Aaron. And as many as know you, haue iuſt cauſe to wyſh, that as you were the firſt borne, ſo you had béene the firſt buried. But God hath otherwiſe appointed it? we doo therefore refer all to his will, béeing well aſſured that the ende ſhall be to his glory, although (we feare) to your euerlaſting confuſion. But what meane you to craue mercy for the ſoules of your brethren and ſiſters departed? doo you thinke that God tooke them out of this miſerable life ſo ſpéedilie, that he might caſt them into your holy father the Popes ſcalding houſe, which you call Purgatorie? Did you neuer reade the wordes written in the 3. Chap. of Wiſedome, I uſtorum animae in man
                        •
                      Dei ſu

                     t: et non tanget illos tormentùm mortis. The ſoules of the righteous are in the hand of God, and the torment of death ſhall not touch them. Againe in the fourth Chap. I ustus autem ſi morte praeoccupatus fuerit: in refrigerio erit. If the iuſt perſon ſhall be preuented by death, he ſhalbe in a place of refreſhing. And againe in the ſame Chap▪ 
                  Raptus est, ne malicia mutaret intellectūm eius: aut ne fictio deciperet animamillius. He was taken away violently, leaſte mallice

ſhould change his vnderſtanding, or leaſt counterfeited holines ſhold deceiue his ſoule. If you will conſider well, thoſe ſayings of yt wyſe man, you ſhall haue cauſe to thinke, that your brethren and ſiſters departed, are not in ſuch caſe now, that they ſhould ſtand in néede of greater mercy, then Chriſt Jeſus hath already ſhewed vnto them. But more of this: when I ſhall come to ſpeake of theſe wordes of yours. You ſay that we are fooles to pray for the deade. Your Brother Aaron (you ſay) was liuing at that time when you did ſo vnduetifullie depart from your mother (but he is nowe dead) to whom as to your Father and mother, you béeſéeche Chriſt to giue life euerlaſting. A good and charitable petition. I wyſh the ſame to you, and to all others whatſoeuer: knowing that none can haue euerlaſting life, otherwiſe then by Gods frée gyft, thorowe Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. But your ſelfe and men of your ſorte, may not acknowledge anie ſuch free gyft, for that you doo (by your often and long prayers, your holines and auſterity of life, and your continuall faſtinges, and often ſcourging of your ſelues with your holie whyppes) deſerue this life euerlaſting, both for your ſelues and for others. So that you are become ſauiours of your ſelues, & of as many as doo (or will) beléeue as you doo, & teache others to beléeue. And thus you conclude your anſwer to the Letter which your mother ſent you, written (as you think) by Maſter Kings man, the Scriuner. As touching ye writer of that Letter, your coniecture is right. You procéede and ſay.
            
            
               Fryar.
               I am now to certify you, of my ſtate, welfare, & abyding, & how I am likely to liue. Firſt of al therfore, I beſeech Ieſus Chriſt giue you the grace of his holie ſpirit, vnto the intēt, that this which I write, may be to his honor, to your cōuerſiō, & your ſouls health.

               Wee ſhall nowe bee certified of your eſtate, welfare &c. You beſéeche Jeſus Chriſte to giue the grace of his holye ſpirit to your mother &c. I hope ſhe hath already receiued ſo large a meaſure of that holy ſpirite, yt whatſoeuer you haue, or ſhall write, ſhall not be able to remooue her from that foundation whereon ſhée is builded: which is the Rocke Chriſt, & that notwithſtanding anie aſſaults that you can make, ſhe ſhall remaine ſtill ſetled vppon that Rocke, to her ſoules health. And that your writings and mine together, ſhalbe to the honor of Chriſt Jeſus, either in your returning againe from your Apostacie, or els in your vtter confuſion.
               Nowe you enter into your diſcourſe concerning your departing,

your trauell and dangers, that you endured and eſcaped, before you were brought to this bleſſed reſt wherein you nowe remaine: the manner and holines of the life that you leade there, and haue vowed and ſo purpoſe to leade, ſo long as GOD ſhall giue you life vppon earth. Laſt of all, you vſe an earneſt, and (as you think) a pithie Oration, to mooue your mother to be at deſtance with that Religion that ſhe nowe holdeth, and with all the teachers thereof: As Crowley, and the reſt: to burne her Bookes of Sermons, to vſe the Engliſh Bible no more, to goe no more to the Sermons of Proteſtants, but to praie to our bleſſed Ladie, and to hang her faith vpon her ſon Samuels ſléeue. And thus your diſcourſe beginneth.
            
            
               The Fryar.
               My departure from you, was vpon the Monday (as I remember) after Lowe Sundaie, in the after noone. That night I was lodged, not farre from London. Two or three nights after that, I went by night a mile from London. The Saterday before that I departed from you, I went to ſhrift, (as wee call it in Englande) or in other words, I was at confeſſion, in a place, where I confeſſed my ſins to a Prieſt, who gaue me abſolution & penaunce. The Mondaie after that, I departed from you, vnder pretence of the Hebrewe Leſſon, which the miſchieuous Hereticke Barber taught me: The Fridaie after that, I went by night a mile from London, where I remained in great feare, the ſpace of two or three weekes. There I heard the firſt maſſe that euer I hearde.
            
            
               Crovvley.
               Concerning the time of your departing from your mother, your going to ſhrift the Saterdaie before, your lodging ſo nighe London for the ſpace of two or thrée nights after your departing, your going by night a mile of from London, your tarrying there for the ſpace of thrée wéekes in great feare, and hearing the firſt maſſe that euer you hearde the Fridaie after you were gon from your mother, I muſt paſſe ouer, as matter more to be muſed at, then to bee entreated of in this my diſcourſe. But this ſéemeth ſomething ſtraunge to me, that your ghoſtlie father would abſolue you before he had giuen you penance. By like he was ſome vnſkilfull penitancer, or els you being yet but a Nouice in Popery, haue vſed the Fygure Hyſteron Proteron in making the report. I perceiue that I my ſelfe, was at your age a much more ſkilfull Papiſt then you bée, and was much more able to defende Popery then you are, or are like to bee. In poprie Contrition and confeſſion goe before ſatiſfaction,

and both muſt be voluntarie, full and vnfained, and then the ghoſtly father, & the ghoſtly childe muſt agrée vpon penance. For no Popiſhe ghoſtly father, will or may enioyne his ghoſtlie childe▪ any other or greater penance, then himſelf will acknowledge yt he is centented to take and to do. And this ſéemeth to me yet more ſtrange, that hauing confeſſed your ſinnes, and receiued abſolution and penance, & béeing reconſiled on the Saterdaie, you could be partaker of our Communion, on the next daie, in companie of your mother▪ whoſe prayers (as you haue ſaid before) are nothing worth, becauſe ſhée is not of that ſocietie that you were by that ghoſtlie father receiued into.
               Haue Papiſtes nowe ſuch a priuiledge, that they may ſimul
                        •
                     re & diſſimulare: counterfait and diſſemble at their pleaſure? Chriſt hath ſaid thus. Whoſoeuer ſhall denie me before men. I will deny him before my heauenlie father, and before all his holie Angelles. You haue not therefore taken vp your Croſſe to followe Chriſt (as you ſéeme to be perſwaded that you haue doone) but you haue diſſembled with Chriſt and Chriſtians, that you might with leſſe daunger of bodie 
                     ••
                  ippe from them, and followe Antichriſt. If I might talke with you mouth to mouth, I would deſire to know of you, what manner of ſinnes they were that you confeſſed to that Prieſte your ghoſtlie Father. I ſuppoſe they were not the ſtubburneſſes & points of diſobedience that you from time to time haue vſed in all your behauiour towards your father and mother, and all other your Gouernors and betters. Neither can I thinke, that they were the ſubtill ſleights that you haue vſed, in deceiuing your father and mother, me, and your Godmother my wife, & others your Tutors, freends, and fellowes, or the falſe lyes that you haue made, and ſ
                     •
                  outlie faced out, when due proofe of that which you had doone coulde not be made. You know what I meane. If you were preſent. I woulde be more plaine and plentifull in ſpéeches, then in writing I doo thinke if méete to bée. To be briefe. I can not thinke that you confeſſed the tranſgreſſion of anie one of the Commanndements of God. But that you had béene at the Sermons of the proteſtant Preachers, and had heard them, and taken the notes of them, and had framed your ſelfe in ſome points to follow them, although in very déede but verie little. Yea, and that you had not holden & defended to the vtter moſt of your power, the Romiſh Catholike Religion, but had willinglie heard and read, and ſometimes your ſelfe vttered, vnreuerent

ſpéeches both by word and by writing, to the derogation of that high dignitie of your moſt holie Father the Popes holines, Gods Vicar vpon earth, and the vniuerſall head of the vniuerſall Catholique Church of Chriſt. Yea and in derogation of that holye Order that you your ſelfe doo now profeſſe. If I had béene with you when you made that confeſſion of your ſinnes. I coulde haue put you in mind of that Engliſh Enterlude that you wrote, whē you laſt dwelt in my houſe, wherein you appointed my little kinſman to play one parte in the habite of a Fryer, with this ſpéeche. Deus hic, Deus hic, and God be héere, is not this an holie ſpéech for a Fryer▪ You confeſſed I thinke, that you neuer tooke aſhes on Aſhewenſday, nor beare Palme on Palme Sondaie, nor crept to the croſſe on good Fridaie, nor faſted on the Ember daies, nor on anie ſaints vigill, nor yet on anie Friday in the whole yéere. But I feare mee you did forget that blaſphemy that in your forenamed Enterlude, in that part that you appointed for your fellowe John Goughe, in theſe wordes, to be ſpoken in the perſon of the mother of Chriſt, in the derogation of the Popes dooings, in that he tooke vppon him to alter the Calender of the yéere. The words are theſe.
               
                  What meaneth this fooliſh man to prate?
                  Nowe ſurelie I maruaile much.
                  What dooth him cauſe this wiſe to chat,
                  As though there were none ſuch?
                  As he himſelfe throughout the world,
                  Upon him ſo doth take:
                  As though that he the heauens and earth,
                  And eke the ſea did make.
                  Hee changeth my byrth day,
                  And wyll my child bed rule at his will:
                  Which he ſhall neuer bring to paſſe,
                  Whilſt world remaineth ſtyll.
               
               If you did in your ſhrift forget theſe wordes of blaſphemy, breathed out againſt your holie father, the Popes holines: your confeſſion that you then made was vnperfecte, and ſo all that then was doone, not woorth a drye Walnut. Yea and although you did not forget to confeſſe it, yet if the Prieſt your ghoſtlie Father, that gaue

you abſolution, had not a more large Commiſſion, then commonlie your holie father vſeth to giue to ſuch ſingle ſoled ſir Johns as they be, which in theſe daies come from Rome, he hadde no power to abſolue you for ſo horrible a ſinne, committed againſt your holie Fathers owne perſonne, his triple crowne and dignitie. No remedie you muſt to Rome, for that abſolution that you haue already receiued, is not worth the leaneſt 
                     •

But to let theſe things paſſe, till you and I ſhall méete together againe, I would gladly knowe wherein you can note Barber to be ſo miſchieuous an hereticke. Is it becauſe hée taught you a Leſſon of the Hebrewe tongue? or was it becauſe hee did it gratis, and tooke no reward of your father for his paines taken therein. Surely his meaning was good to you wardes, and that reward that you render vnto him nowe, ſaueureth of too too great ingratitude. A vice that all honeſt men doo abhorre.

               The Fryaer.
               From thence I departed vpon May day, earely in the morning on hor
                     •
                  backe toward Suſſex. I was in Suſſex and Hampſhire three monthes. Good Gentlemen gaue mee, when I departed from London, fortie or fyftie ſhillings to come ouer Seas. The danger was ſo great, and the examinations at the Sea ſhore ſo ſtraight, that I knewe not what to dog. Againe, other letts I had, that I could not take ſhipping, vntill the ende of lulie welnere. All this whyle (I thanke God) I wanted nothing: neither apparrell, meate nor drinke, nor money. Vpon S. Iames euen, I tooke ſhipping at mydnight, with a Gentleman, a good Catholicke, or as you would terme him, a Papiſt, I being a Papiſt with him. So we two Papiſtes tooke ſhipping at Arundell Hauen in Suſſex, to goe to Rome. We were in great hazard of our liues vpon the Seas, from Sunday night, vntill wedneſday afternoone. At what time wee arriued bothe in Fraunce, at Diepe in Normandie. From Diepe wee came to Roane in Normand
                     •
                  e, where I ſtayed a fortnight. After that I came to Paris, (the cheefeſt Cittie in Fraunce) from thence to Rhemes, where I ſtayed a tweluemonth and aboue. So I trauelled in Fraunce, before I came to an abyding place, welnere foureſcore leagues: that is to ſay, eightſcore miles almoſt. Being at Rhemes, I went, (or at the leaſt I ſhould haue gone) euerie day to the morning maſſe. After which maſſe, our cuſtome was to breake our faſte, and after that to goe ſtudie. I was in the Engliſh Colledge at Rhemes, where wee were welnere two hundred Engliſh men. I liued there paſſing well, as concerning meate, drinke, and other neceſſities▪

               By this diſcourſe of your peregrination, it appeareth, that Antichriſt hath his fréendes amongſt Engliſh men, bothe in, and about London, and alſo abroade in other partes of ye Realme, and in Fraunce alſo. Good Gentlemen you ſay, (you ſhoulde haue ſayd, villanous Traytors) gaue you money to come ouer the Seas. Other, (whether Gentlemen or Yeomen, you ſay not) ſette you on horſebacke on May day, earely in the morning, and ſo like mē that bare more good wyll to Autichriſt of Italie, then to Chriſt. and hys annointed Deputy in England: conueighed you into Suſſex, and Hampſhyre, where men of like fidelity towards God, & our Prince and Countrey, miniſtred vnto you all thinges neceſſary, ſo that the young Romiſh traytor, and fugitiue ſonne, that like a moſt rebellious Childe, had robbed his father and mother, of that helpe and cō
                  fort,

that both by the Lawe of God and of nature, all Parents ſhould haue at the hands of their ſonnes and daughters, is amongſt them ſo maintained, that for the ſpace almoſt of thrée monthes, hee lacketh neither meate, drinke, nor money. After all this, a Gentleman, a good Catholicke, a Papiſt (you ſay) with your ſelfe, a Papiſt alſo▪ (a payre of Italian Pygions) tooke ſhypping on S. James euen at midnight &c. If the Quéenes Maieſties Officers in Arundell, had borne ſo good wyll to her maieſtie and Countrey as by oath and alegiance they ſhould haue doone, your good Catholike Gentleman and you ſhould haue béene brought backe againe to London, and not haue béene in ſuch hazarde of your liues at the Sea, as you ſay you were, from Sunday night, till wedneſday after noone. But God wyll be reuenged vpon ſuch brybing Officers, as can looke thorow their fingers, and ſuffer ſuch good Catholicke Gentlemen as you and your guyde were, to paſſe without examination, contrarie to their oathe and alegiance to their Prince and Countrey. Well, you eſcaped that hazarde of your liues, and arriued bothe in Fraunce, at Diepe, &c: Your trauell was great, from Diepe to Roane, from Roane to Paris, from Paris to Rhemes, where you ſtayed twelue month and more &c. Sée how much wiſer you be then Waltams Calfe, that ranne nine miles after a Bull to ſucke him. You ſay, that you ran welnere fourſcore leagues, that is almoſt eightſcore myles. And what other cauſe had you, then ſuch as may rightlie bee ſayde to bee the deſire to ſucke a Bull? At Rhemes (you ſay) you were excéeding well, and lacked no neceſſities (you ſhould haue ſayde, neceſſaries) being accompanied with two hundreth Engliſhmen▪ welnie. There you did goe (or at the leaſt ſhould haue gone) to the morning maſſe euerie day. Héere you giue me ſome occaſion to call to minde that ſaying, Coelum non animum mutant, qui trans mare currunt. They that runne ouer the Sea, doo not change their minde but the ayre. You haue alwayes loued your cowche ſo well, that you coulde not be the firſt that ſhoulde ariſe in the morning. And when you were in Cambridge, it was noted to be a great faulte in you, that you would oftentimes pretende ſicknes, and the griefe of your Rupture, ſo that you could not aryſe to the morning exerciſe, but to dinner you coulde come. So I muſt thinke, that though you did in Rhemes, ſléepe out your morrow maſſe, yet you would not be found ſlacke at breakfaſt, or (at the leaſt) at dinner▪ And this might bee ſome cauſe

that you were not ſo well liked of in the Colledge at Rhemes, for ſuch as were ſtudious there, muſt ſée that your running witt coulde not ſetle if ſelfe to any graue ſtudie. And therefore it was your beſt way to depart thence, and to hide your ſelfe in a Fryers Cowle. I remember a ſpéeche that Table players doo vſe, when ſuch a chaunce riſeth on the dice that they can not play to any aduauntage, the partie, that did caſte the chaunce vſeth to ſaye, it is naught. The other that playeth with him vſeth to anſwere thus, Then make a Fryer of it. This ſpéeche was commenly vſed in Englande, when the Orders of Fryers were in as high eſtimation in Englande, as they are newe in Fraunce. It did ſpring vp of that cuſtome yt was then common amongſt Engliſh men. as it is newe in Fraunce and other Countreyes where the Orders of Friers be. An idle Lubber that wyll not endure any honeſt labour, wyll make ſhift to créepe into the habite of a Fryer, wherein he may loyter, and be fedde by the laboure of other men, and by the ſweat of other mens faces. Of this more ſhalbe ſayd, when I haue occaſion to write of your maner of entring into the profeſſion of your S. Franncis Order. You procéede in your diſcourſe, and thus you ſay:
            
            
               The Fryer.
               When I had for the ſpace of ſixteene of ſeuenteene monthes dwelt in Rhemes, I longed verie much to goe to Rome in Italie, to the Engliſh Colledge that our holy father, the Popes holines, maintained there, for the conuerſion of our miſerable Countrey. To Rome alſo I had gone, if God of his wonderfull grace and mercie, had not otherwiſe and in better ſort prepared for me. In the meane ſeaſon, I went to viſite Churches, to heare maſſes, to kyſſe Saints Reliques, to pray to God for you and for our Countrey in Fry
                     •
                  ies, and Monaſteries. I liked very well the Gray Fryers, the Auguſtine Fryars, the Blacke Fryers, otherwiſe called Carmelites, the white Fryers, and other ſorts of Religion, as alſo the Charterhouſe Monkes, the Blacke Monkes and others. Whilſt that I dyd thus take pleaſure in viſiting Fryeties & Abbies, Nunneries & ſuch other deuout places: it pleaſed God to touch my hard hart, and to mollifie it with the teares of deuotion. To be briefe, I toke in mind to leaue ſtudie, and to forſake the life of a Scholler, which I ledde at the Engliſh Colledge, and to make my ſelfe a Fryer or a Monke, as others did. I ſought therefore by all meanes poſſible▪ of mine owne free will, no man conſtrayning me, to leaue the worlde or worldlye

thinges, and be a Religious man. I knewe not whether it were beſt for me to be a Charterhouſe Monke, or a Minime Fryer. Which Fririe of Minimes, is an extreme ſtraight kind of life, as afterward you ſhall heare.

               Your ſickle witte appeareth ſtill more and more. You were verie well (you ſay) in the Colledge at Rhemes: yet after ſeauentéene monthes aboade there, you longed verie much to goe to Rome in Italie, by like ye exerciſe of learning in Rhemes, was greater then your idle head could away with, and therefore you longed ſo greatlie to goe to Rome, in hope to finde a more idle life there. To goe from place to place, from Frierie to Frierie, from the Nunnes to the Munckes, to heare maſſe, and to kiſſe the Reliques of Saintes, was a iollye idle life. But I pray you, are you aſſured that the Reliques that you kiſſed were the Reliques of Saintes? When the Reliques that were in Churches in Englande, came into the hands of them that could and would conſider them with indifferent eyes▪ I my ſelfe ſawe one bone, that had a Label of parchment faſtened to it, wherein was written. ▪
                  Os ſancti Bartholomei, A bone of S. Bartholomew. But when this bone was wel viewed, it was found to be the ſhoulder bone of a young Pig, the broade and thinne part thereof beeing pared of with a knife, as did moſte plainely appeare. In the Abbay of Hayles, a Relique was kept, which was ſaid to be the blood of Chriſt, but when the Pyx (wherin it was kept) was opened, it was found to be a matter like very fine ſande, or a liquid Gumme of a ſanguine coloure. I my ſelfe (being then but young) did ſée and reade the Hiſtory of the bringing of that ſuppoſed blood thether, which Hiſtorie was written in a Table faſt by the entring into that Chappell where the Relique was kept. The hiſtory was ſo doubtfull, that euen then I beganne to doubt of the trueth thereof. For in the Hiſtory it was not plainelie affirmed to be a portion of the bloode that iſhued out of the bodye of Chriſt, but either a portion of that blood, or els of blood that iſhueed out of a crucifix that was found in the houſe of a Jewe in Jeruſalem, and ſet-vp on the Mount of Caluerie in deriſion, into ye ſide whereof, blinde Longius, was cauſed to thruſt his Speare, whereby great plenty of bloode did iſhue, and was reſerued by ſuch as were preſent. &c. The Nayles that faſtened our Sauiour to the Croſſe, were in number but thrée, and they came all to the handes

of Conſtantine the Emperour, by his mother Helena. He cauſed one of them to be wrought into the byt of his brydle, that hée ſhould vſe in the warres, another in the Coone of his Helmet, to faſten his plume of Feathers in, and the third he caried alwayes about him, and being in daunger in a ſtorme on the Adrian Sea, he caſt it in to the Sea to ſtay the rage thereof. This is written by Romaine Catholikes, wherefore you muſt not denie it to be true. Now conſider with your ſelfe, whether you haue béene borne in hande that you haue kiſſed any of thoſe nayles or not. I coulde ſay ſomething of our Ladies milke, her gloues, her ſmocke, her heayre, &c. Of the breade that was left at Chriſtes laſt ſupper, of the I ſe that was frozen in that night wherein he was borne &c. Well, why
                     •
                  ſt you were thus occupyed, your hard hart was mollified with the teares of deuotion. You ſhould haue ſayd, of ſuperſtition, & deſire to leade a loyterers life. You determined to leaue ye life of a Scholer (which in verie déede you could neuer delight in) becauſe you might not be idle in that kinde of life, and ſought by all meanes poſſible to obtaine the habite of Religion, and at the laſt you obtained a Minimes habite.
            
            
               The Fryar.
               I came (you ſay) from Rhemes to Paris, to aſke the habite of a Religious man, from thence I returned (ſay you) to Rhemes. Whether after that I came, I was receiued with other two Engliſhmē into the Frierie, in which we ſtayed for the ſpace of a moneth. After which terme, one of vs was receiued, the other two, whereof I was one, being ſent to the Engliſh Colledge, there to ſtay till ſome other occaſion might fall out. Three weekes beeing paſſed, I was ſent to a Cittie in Loraine, called Verdun, eyght and forty miles diſtant from Rhemes. Since which my departure from the Engliſh Colledge. I ſawe no more Rhemes. Beeing at Verdun, the Prouinciall of Lyons, (or as he may be called, after the termes of Religion, which in Catholicke time were vſed in England) the chiefe Pryor of Lyons, tooke me with him and paid my charges, from the foreſayde Cittie of Verdun to Lyons in Fraunce, which are a hundred leagues, that is to ſay, two hundred miles. Being there arriued, after a fortnights ende▪ I was weeded with a Fryers weede. Then my ſofe linnen ſhy

                  ts, were turned into rough wollen ſhyrts, my blacke Scholerlike garments, into a browne gowne, with large fleeues as the Gray Fryers haue. My

hatte was turned into a Fryers hood. So I being chaunged in garments, began alſo to change my life. I liued ſo at Lyons the ſpace of twelue month a Nouice, to ſee if I could abide the hardneſſe of life that was there neceſſarie to be ab

                  dden. At the twelue month ende, I liked well of all thinges, and the Fryers lyked well of me. So I made my profeſſion, the ſixt day of Ianuary, in the yeere of our Lord. 1586. two yeeres and a halfe after I departed frō you▪ I made as I ſay my profeſſion, that is to ſay, I made a ſolemne vow or promiſe vnto God, to hue all the dayes of my life in this world a Fryer. And furthermore, I vowed chaſtitie, nere to haue wyfe, pou

                  tie, to be poore, to haue nothing, not ſo much as the garments on my backe for mine owne. And alſo obedience, to be obedient to the Pryor, and to my ſuperiors. The Order whereof I am, is called the Order of S. Frauncis of Paula. It was neuer yet in Englande, but we hope it ſhall ſhortly be. We are called Minimes, in french, bone homes, that is in Engliſh, good men, although we be not worthy of the name, (for no man is good, except God) yet by reaſon of our hardnes of life, and of the vertuous behauiour of our brethren we are ſo called.

               Sée howe intollerable trauell this Waltams Calfe endureth, in following after that Bull whom he deſireth ſo greatly to ſucke. He poſteth from Rhemes to Paris, and to Rhemes againe, from thence to Verdun in Loraine, from thence to Lyons in France and there he was inueſted or wéeded as he termeth it, with a Fryers wéede, which he calleth the habite of a Religious man. Thys man hath forgotten that Chriſtian men are Religious men, and that there is no Religion comparable to the Chriſtian Religion. He doth not conſider, that the reſt which are called Religious are but ſuperſtitious, and not Religious in déede. In that ſuperſticious wéede he continueth twelue monthes: and then he made hys profeſſion▪ He hath forgotten that profeſſion that his Godfathers and his Godmother made in his name in ye Church of Wal

                   Haue nothing to doo with the vnprofitable works of darknes but rather rebuke them. For it is a filthy thing, euen to ſpeake of thoſe things or actions, that are wrought of thē in ſecret. Craue of God his holy ſpirite to direct you in ye right vnderſtanding of theſe wordes, according to the councell of the Apoſtle S. Iames, Chap. 1. If any of you doo lacke wiſedome, let him aſke it of God, which giueth to all men indifferently &c. Yea, and conſider the wordes of the Apoſtle Paule to the Romanes. Chap. 1. Mutauerunt gloriam incorruptibilis Dei, in ſimilitudinem corruptibilis hominis, & volucrum & quadrupedum & ſerpentium. Propter quod tradidit illos Deus in deſideria cordis eorum, in immunditiam, vt contumelijs afficerent corpora ſua in ſemetipſis: qui commutauerunt veritatem Dei in mendacium, et coluerunt et ſeruierunt creaturae, potius quàm creatori, qui est benedictus in ſecula. Amen. They haue turned the glorye of the incorruptible God. in to the ſimilitude of a corruptible man, and of flying fowles, and of fourefooted beaſtes, and of créeping ſerpents. Wherefore God gaue them ouer vnto their owne harts deſire, into vncleanneſſe, that they might defile their owne bodies, euen in thē
                  ſelues: which had chaunged the truth of God into a lye, and had worſhipped and ſerued the creature, more then the creator, which is bleſſed for euer, Amen. Conſider (I ſay) theſe words of the Apoſtle Paule, with the reſt that follow. Propterea tradidit illos Deus, in paſſiones ignominiae. Nam faeminae eorum, immutauerunt naturalem vſum, in eum vſum quiest contra naturam. Similiter autem & maſculi, relicto naturali vſu faeminae, exarſerunt in deſiderijs ſuis in inuicem, maſculi in maſculos, turpitudinem operantes, & mercedem (quam oportuit) erroris ſui, in ſemetipſis recipientes &c. Wherefore, God gaue them ouer to ſhamefull luſtes. For theyr women chaunged theyr naturall vſe into that which is contrary to nature. In like manner the men alſo, leauing the naturall vſe of the woman, burned in their luſtes or filthy deſires, one towards an other, men with men wrought filthines, receiuing in themſelues the rewarde of theyr error, which (in Gods iuſtice) was due vnto them. Conſider (Samuell) I pray thee, euen in the tender bowels of Chriſt Jeſus, in

whom I doo yet loue thée, and do hope (by the helpe of his ſpirite) to winne thée to him againe. Conſider I ſay, theſe wordes of the Apoſtle. And vndoubtedlie thou ſhalt ſée, that, that Romiſh Churche, which calleth herſelfe Catholike, is héerein plainly painted out. Haue they not chaunged, and doo they not ſtill chaunge, the glory of the incorruptible God, into the ſimilitude of a corruptible manne. When they haue ſet forth, and doo ſtill ſet forth, the maieſty of God to the viewe of mans eye, by the Image of an olde man, made of Tymber, ſtone, or other matter, or wrought by ye cunning of Painters or Embrotherers? Doth not Eſay the Prophet deride theſe dooings, both in the forty and in the foure & forty Chapters of hys booke? And doth not the Prophet Dauid deride thē in ye Pſalme; 115. after the Hebrews account, but after your account 113. The auncient interpreters of the Scriptures, doo with one conſent condemne the making and hauing of the Image of the diuine maieſty. And yet that Romiſh Catholike Church, dare ſtill make it, haue it in their Churches, and fall downe before it. Hath not God in Exo. 20. Expreſly forbidden the making and worſhipping of all manner of Images? And howe dare any man make, or worſhipp them, or ſay that, that Church is Chriſtes Church, that doth both make thē, worſhip them, and perſecute thoſe Chriſtians that refuſe to doo as they doo? Waie well the words of the Apoſtle, when he ſayth. That for this cauſe, (that is, for turning his glorye into the ſimilitude of a corruptible man) God hath giuen them ouer to theyr owne harts deſire
                     •
                   &c. Theyr women haue turned the naturall vſe into yt which is contrary to nature: and the men hauing left the naturall vſe of the woman (as you ſay you haue vowed to doo) haue burned in deſire one towards an other, and men haue wrought filthines wyth men.
               When GOD opened the hart of King Henry the eyght, and gaue him ſome ſight of the truth, he cauſed the Monkes, the Fryers, and the Nunnes that then were in his Realme to bee examined, and by due and politike examination, they were found to haue doone, euen as S. Paule writeth héere. And when God ſhall open the eyes of that Noble Prince that nowe raigneth in Fraunce, or the eyes of ſome Noble Prince that héereafter ſhall haue the gouernment of that noble Realme of Fraunce, wherein you nowe liue, vndoubtedly, your ſecrete filthines will bee founde out, and

your hypocrits viſoures will be plucked of your faces, & you coates of counterfeited holines, will be plucked of your backs, and you wyl be turned abroade into the worlde (as our Hypocrites were in the daies of our King Henrie) that you may learne to laboure, and hy your owne laboure to eate your owne breade, and not to be fedde anie longer by the labours of other men. Thus much I haue thought méete to write, concerning the firſt part of your vowe, which is, to liue in wyneles chaſtity.
               The ſecond part of your vowe, is pouertie. To be poore, to haue nothing, not ſo much as the Garments on your back for your own. This part of your vowe, was altogether néedeles. For ſince you were borne, you neuer gaue your ſelfe to any ſuch exerciſe, that you might be able thereby to haue anie thing of your owne. But you haue béene fedde and clothed, and in all points ſuſtayned, by the labours of your poore father and mother, and other that haue hoped to ſee a better proofe of you then nowe is ſeene, and therefore extended their fréendlie liberalitie to you. But now you ſay you haue not one fréend in all Englande, or at the leaſt way, amongſt vs that bare all the burden of your education▪ and bringing vppe, euen vnto that time, wherein you did verie vnduetifully giue vs the ſlip, not once bidding vs farewell. They therefore that haue nowe caught you, doo not knowe what a Jewell they ſhall haue of you, for it is like enough, that after they ſhall haue beſtowed enough & too much vpon you, you will render vnto them ſuch thankes as you haue rendred vnto vs. It ſhalbe good for them therefore in time to looke vppon, and to folow that Rule that S. Paule wyſhed the Theſſalonians to follow. 2. Theſ. 3. Si quis non vult operari, nec manducet. If any man will not worke, let him not eate. But you will aunſwere me and ſay: We doo laboure, for we riſe euerie night at midnight, and we ſing Mattins before the bleſſed Sacrament of the Alter, we ariſe againe at ſixe of the clocke in the morning, and we ſing two or thrée high maſſes euerie day. &c. But let me tell you what I haue hearde reported concerning Frauncis, of whom the Gray Friers doo holde. That Frauncis was (as the report goeth) a good man, and gaue himſelfe to ſore laboure, in repayring of high waies that were decayed in the Countrey where he dwelt. And on a time as he was at his laboure, a companie of tall fellowes that had beene théeues, and were condemned to be hanged, were by the Officers

brought that way towards the Gallowſe to bee executed. When Frauncis ſawe them, he was moued with pittie, and beſought the Officers to ſtaie the execution whilſt hee might goe to the King, (who lay then not farre off) and begge their pardon, and ſo it was doone. When Frauncis had obtained pardon for theſe men, hee clothed them in ſuch apparell as the Gray Fryers doo nowe weare, and girded thoſe Garments to them, with the halters wherewyth they ſhould haue béene hanged. The Garment is very commodious, for it is long and large, and may be tucked vp ſhort, & let down to the foote, as occaſion ſhall ſerue, and require for the commodity of the wearer of it. It hath a hoode that may hang on the backe, and not be any let in labour, and when néede is, it may couer and defend the head and face from the iniuries of the wether. Theſe men being thus apparailed, fell to their laboure luſtily, & in ſhort ſpace, brought their maſters worke to ſuch forwardnes, that hee thought méete to trauaile into ſome other part of the Countrey, to ſée where other decayed high wayes were, that he might kéepe his newe men and himſelfe in worke ſtill. But to be briefe, he was from them ſo long, that they hauing finiſhed the worke that he left them in, had gotten them a houſe in the next Towne, and had perſwaded the people thereof, that by ryſing at midnight, and making of continuall prayers vnto God for that people that ſhoulde ſéede and maintayne them without laboure, they ſhould be much more beneficiall to the Common weale, then they could be by any ſore laboure of their bodies in emending the high wayes that ſhould be decaied. But when Frauncis came, and found them thus occupied, hee vtterly miſliked with them, and ſayd vnto them. Théeues I found you, and theeues I leaue you. And ſo departing from them, he would haue no more to doo with them. If this be not true, then blame them that haue made this report of Frauncis, whom the Gray Fryers take for their Patron. If it be true, then you may ſée what beginning the Order of the Gray Friers had, and howe acceptable that ryſing at midnight and ſinging of Mattens and maſſes was to that Frauncis, of whoſe holines the Gray Fryers doo make ſo great bragges. And ſo by good conſequence, what account good and wiſe men ſhold make of the great paines that you and your Brethren doo take, in your ryſing and ſinging both by day and by night. Whether thys Frauncis were your Frauncis of Paula or not, I leaue to be diſcuſſed

by your ſelfe, with the helpe of the chiefe Pryor, or Prouintiall of your Order, at your beſt leaſure. Thus much for the ſecond part of your vowe.
               The third part of your vowe, or (as you doo terme it) your third vowe was obedience, to be obedient to the Pryor, and to your ſuperiors. If you had conſidered well of that triple vowe that was made for you in Baptiſme, and your ſelfe confirmed, when you anſwered me in my Church at Creplegate in London, I thinke you would haue thought this newe triple vowe, altogether vnneceſſarie: except you meant to reuoke your firſt triple vowe made to GOD, and in ſtéede thereof to make a newe triple vow to man. For what haue you vowed héere (in ſubſtance) that was not vowed before in your firſt triple vowe? Except this onely, that you vowe nowe to liue without a wiſe, ſo long as you ſhall liue: which is not in your power to performe, neither haue you the example of anie Patriarke, Prophet or Apoſtle that made this vowe, or taught anie other to make it, nor yet any promiſe of aſſiſtance at Gods hand in the performance of it▪ You promiſed in the firſt vow

You promiſed alſo obedience to your Prince, and to all in authority vnder your Prince &c. but that vowe you haue vtterly renounced, and are now ſhrewded vnder the ſhield of Antichriſt, and holde by an immunitie, wherby you are exempted from the power of all Princes, and doo owe obedience to none, but to that great Antichriſt and your graund Pryor, and ſuch ſuperiors as be of that ſort.

But heare what you may reade in the booke of VViſedome, Chap. 5. where it is written, that the damned in the latter day, bewayling their fooliſhnes, ſhall ſpeake theſe words.

               Thus farre goeth your merginall note.
               To this note of yours, I ſay thus. There is good cauſe to moue you to thinke, that we doo think that you are fooles: for you can not but know, that we doo know, that there is no wiſedome in thē that doo ſo waſte the good creatures of God, as you doo, that waxe which you doo burne in the day light, when there is no vſe of that artificiall light, becauſe the naturall light, dooth then ſerue the turne of euery creature that néedeth▪ ye vſe of light. And that madnes of yours is ſo much the greater, for that you ſet thoſe lightes before ſtocks and ſtones, that are faſhioned like men and women, and haue the forme of eyes, but not ye ſence of ſight.

in the Pſalme. 115. Doth account you no wiſer then thoſe ſtocks and ſtones be, when he ſayth thus. They that make them, are like vnto them, and ſo are all they that repoſe truſt in them. You ſay, that your other Ceremonies doo cauſe vs to thinke that you are fooles, and your Religion folly. In truth you coniecture right. For wee know that no wiſe man in the world, would vſe ſuch Ceremonies as you doo, nor profeſſe ſuch a Religion, wherin there is (in maner) nothing but méere madnes: As I hope I ſhall make manifeſt to al wiſemen, in my diſcourſe vpon the ſeuerall points thereof.

Euen as when the Lorde had ſayd: Bleſſed are they that ſuffer perſecution, except hee hadde added for righteouſnes, he ſhould haue meant, not thē alone which are crowned for their ſuffering in the Lord, but them alſo that are puniſhed by iuſt lawes. Wherefore, if you doo thinke, that theſe words that are written, doo appertaine vnto you: ſhewe firſt whether you be righteous, or no. And in ye ſame place it foloweth thus. In déede you haue amongſt you righteouſneſſes yt you brag of, great matters, as ye deuiding of Chriſt, the cutting off, of the Sacraments of Chriſt, yt for ſaking of the peace of Chriſt, war againſt ye mēbers of Chriſt, accuſations againſt the ſpouſe of Chriſte, & the denying of the promiſes of Chriſt▪ Theſe are your righteouſneſſes, for which forſooth, you ſhall ſtand in great conſtancie. Thus farre Auguſtine.
               
               Nowe, if I may be ſo bolde with you, let me ſée whether theſe latter words of S. Auſten may not be rightly applied vnto you Minime Fryers, and ſuch other Religious perſonnes. Doo you not deuide Chriſt, when you aſcribe your ſaluation, part
                     •
                  y to faith in him, and partly to your owne workes, and to the merits of Saints? and when, in the Office of mediation, you ioyne with him his bleſſed mother, and ſuch other as liued holily in this tranſitory life? Do you not cutt off the Sacraments of Chriſt? and after a ſort you abrogate

them, when you miniſter Baptiſme to belles, Churches, and Churchyardes, and ſhyppes, which you call the hallowing of theſe thinges, and when in your con
                     •
                  urations, you chriſten Cattes and ſuch other creatures to deceiue the deuill withall, when you haue promiſed to giue him a chriſtened creature? And when you teache that in the Sacrament of the body and blood of Chriſt, there remaineth no ſubſtance of bread and wyne, and ſo you make it no Sacrament. For (as you once learned, and did openly confeſſe in my Church) euery Sacrament muſt conſiſt of two parts, that is, both of earthly and of heauenly matter, and not of the one matter onely? And when you giue it that newe name, calling it the Sacrament of the Altare, and when you doo reſerue it, hanging it ouer your Altar, carrying it abroade to ſhew it to the people, teaching them to fail downe and worſhip it, and ſo make an Idoll of it? Yea when in your maſſe you make a ſacrifice of it, for ye ſins both of the liuing & of the dead? yea and in ſtormes & tempeſtious wether, you make it a bugge to feare the deuill withall. And whē you teache that the peace of mens conſciences, muſt not bee ſtayed vppon the fayth in Chriſt onely: but vppon the worthines of the workes that are wrought by men, doo ye not forſake the peace of Chriſte? Yea when you holde, ſome of Frauncis (as you & the Gray Fryers doo) ſome of Auſtine, as the Auguſtine Fryers doo, ſome of Dominicke, as the Dominicane Fryers doo: ſome of Marye, as the Carmelite or whyte Fryers doo: and ſome of Jeſus, as the newe founde Jeſuites doo. And to bee briefe, all the rable of your Religious: doo ye not all forſake that peace that GOD hath giuen in his peace maker Chriſt, and ſéeke it in them whoſe Religions you profeſſe, whoſe rules you followe, and whoſe names you beare? Dyd not S. Paule blame the Corinthians, for that they forſaking this peace of Chriſt, would hold one of Cephas, another of Apollo, another of Paule, another of Chriſt? Were you baptiſed in the name of Paule? ſayth he. Was Paule Cru
                     •
                  ified for you? I feare me you be rebaptiſed: For what meaneth the chaunging of your name? In your firſt baptiſme, you were called Samuell, and by your Fathers progeny Debnam, and by your profeſſion a Chriſtian. But now you muſt be called Iohn Frauncis. And what meaneth this, but that the name of Frauncis, hath blotted out both the name of Debnam, and the name Chriſtian alſo.
               
                  If ſerche ſhalbe made in the Regiſter that is kept in the Parriſh Church of Waltam, it wyll be ſound there, that one Samuell Debnam was baptiſed there: and not Iohn Frauncis. So that Samuell Debnam is the Chriſtian, and Iohn Frauncis is the Fryer. Iudge you whether of theſe is likely to be founde in Gods Regiſter, which is called the booke of life. If Chriſt bee that life, then they are written in the booke of life that be Chriſtians, If Frauncis be not that life, then are not they written in the booke of life which be Franciſcans, and ſo of all other your Popiſh Religious. Be not deceiued therefore Samuell. The Corinthians whom Paule rebuked, did vndoubtedly thinke as you doo. That is, that holding of Cephas, Apollo, and Paule: they did not forſake ye peace of Chriſt. For ſo (I am aſſured) you thinke, that hauing profeſſed the Religion of Frauncis, you haue not forſaken the Religion of Chriſt. And yet Paule doth charge them as men, that in their dooinges gaue occaſion to him to conceiue this opinion of them, that they were become Cephaſians, Apollianiſtes, and Pauliſts, and not Chriſtians. Take héede Samuell, our aduerſary the deuyll is ſubtyll, and doth oftentimes ſhewe himſelfe in the likenes of an Angell of light. You haue (I thinke) read the ſixt Chapter of Saint Iohns Reuelations. And you either haue or may reade, the godlie and learned interpretations, that godly learned men haue made, concerning the foure horſes therein mentioned. The firſte being white, doth prefigure the time that was begunne, when this Reuelation was ſhewed to Iohn, and did continue all his dayes, and hath continued euer ſince, and ſhall continue euen to the ende: although not ſo generallie, and ſo apparantlie as at the firſt. Thys white horſe is gone forth, and is not returned again, but goeth forth ſtill whether ſoeuer his rider will direct him. And his ryder dooth with his arrowes ſtrike the harts of ſuch as he wyll conquere and make ſubiecte vnto him. And thus hee goeth foorth ſtill conquering, that he might ouercome and conquere. The ſeconde horſe beeing redde, doth ſignifie the time of bloodie perſecution (which was alſo begunne, when this Reuelation was ſhewed to the ſeruaunt of Ieſus Chriſt, bleſſed S. Iohn. And his ryder had power giuen him to take pea
                     •
                  e from the earth▪ and he had a great ſword giuen him alſo. Whereby were ſignified the tenne bloodie perſecutions that folowed immediatly after the white horſe was gone foorth and had conquered

many. And thoſe bloody perfecutions were executed by that great ſword the Romane Monarchie. The third horſe was black▪ whereby was ſignified the time of ignorance, that beganne againe after the perſecution was ſtaied, (but not ended, for it continueth to this day, and ſo ſhall it continue euen to the ende.) The rider that rydde on this horſe, had a Ballance in his hand, wherwith he wayed Gods Lawes, and mens inuentions, and déemed them to bee of like waight: and héereof ſprong all thoſe horrible hereſies, that euer ſince haue, and doo ſtill trouble the Church, and eſpecially that Pelagian hereſie, that your ſort doo ſtill maintaine, and the making of mens inuentions equall with Gods lawe, yea rather proferring them before Gods lawes: but wine and Oyle that rider might not hurt. That is, he had no power to corrupt the text, either of the old or newe Teſtament. The fourth horſe was pale, and ſignified the time that followed immediatly after this time of déepe ignoraunce, and doth continue to this day, wherein great ſwa

                  mes of pale Hypocrites (euē ſuch as you haue profeſſed to bee & to continue to your liues ende) haue béene and are▪ ſtill bredde. The ryder of this horſe is death, and hell followeth after him. Take héede therefore, your way is not the way of life, but of death. They that will follow ſuch blinde guydes, ſhall fall into the pyt with them. You are they that ſhall ſay in the laſt day: We haue

For you bee they that haue diſtreſſed ſuch as God hath (by the mediation of hys Sonne) diſcharged of ſinne, and ſo iuſtified them in his ſight, you haue tolde them, that except they ſhall puniſh themſelues as you doo your ſelues▪ they can not be ſaued.

                  me. The promiſes of Chriſt you denie, in that you ſay, that not euery one that beléeueth and is baptiſed ſhall be ſaued, no not though they make their beléefe knowne vnto men by their obedience to Chriſt, in folowing the Rule that he hath preſcribed, and endeuouring to doo as their heauenly Father hath commaunded. But he that wyll be ſaued, muſt liue in obedience to your holy father, the Popes holines. Thus much for ye applying of thoſe words vnto you, and other Popiſh Religious, that Saint Auſten wrote againſt the Donatiſtes.
               
               Nowe to the Rule of your Religion, which is, (as you ſay) neuer to eate fleſh &c. In his firſt Epiſtle to the Corinthians, and the 8. Chapter, S. Pauls writeth thus. Eſca autem, nos non commenda

                      Deo. Meate doth not make vs more acceptable to God. Neither are we the better if we eate, nor the worſe if we eate not. And againe, in the ſixt of the ſame Epiſtle. Eſca ventri▪ & venter eſcis. Hunc & has deſtruet Dens. Meats is appointed for the belly, and the belly for the meate, but God wyll deſtroy both the one and the other. By theſe places and diuers other, it appeareth that Chriſtians haue liberty to vſe all Gods good creatures, and that they are not the better or more acceptable in Gods ſight. When they doo vſe them, nor leſſe acceptable when they refuſe the vſe of them, except the refuſall doo procéede of an opinion of ſome holines or vnholines in the vſe or refuſall of them. If you féede not to fill your bellyes, but to ſuſtaine nature, with thankes to God for his creatures, you doo well. But you are i

It is the moderate vſe of Gods creatures, and our thanks giuen to him for them, that doo make our eating or abſtayning, acceptable vnto him. Your eating but once in a day, from the day of All ſaintes, to Chriſtmas day, and from Shro
                     ••
                   ſunday to Eaſter (which you call

faſting) is nothing. For you may eate as much at one meale, as might ſuffice you at two or thrée. The like is to be thought of all your wedneſdayes faſtings, for they are but a diuerſity in eating or féeding. Your refrayning the touching of money, may be thought to be a toy to mocke an Ape with all. And your ryſing at mydnight, may be oppoſite to your ſléeping at noone. You ſay, that you doo at midnight ſing your Mattins before the bleſſed Sacrament of the Altar, the precious bodie and blood of our Lord and Sauiour Chriſt which is there kept ouer the high Altar. What pleaſure you doo, or can doo to that Sacramēt, by ſinging your Mattins before it, I can not vnderſtand: for I think it can not heare any one word that you doo either ſing or ſay, and ſo it can not be delighted with the hermonie of your muſicke. I put you in minde of theſe thinges, becauſe your greateſt Clerkes haue written, that Chriſt is not in that bleſſed Sacrament of yours, with his dementions and liniaments of bodie, neither with his Organs of ſences: but meruailouſly, & with out the diſtinction of parts. I thinke therefore, that in the cold wether, it were more wiſedome for you to kéepe your ſelues warme in your beddes, that when you be waking, you may ſing and make melodie in your harts to God: then to riſe out of your bedds, and ſit quyuering and quaking in your wyde and cold Quyer, to pleaſure him with muſicke, that hath not one eare to heare your harmonie. For vndoubtedly, you can not but wyſh that you had doone, before you haue well begunne. And what thankes can you looke for at the handes of that Sacrament that you ſing your Mattins before? And in the hotte or warme wether, I thinke it ſhoulde be more profitable for you, to be in your ſtudies (if you haue any) at a conuenient houre, endeuouring to learne the meaning of ye Prophete in thoſe Pſalmes that you vſe to ſing in your Mattins (for the moſt parte) without vnderſtanding. Well, you ſing two or thrée high maſſes euery day. I thinke you miſtake your termes. For in ſuch Churches as yours, there is but one high maſſe, whether it be ſayde or ſonge, the other (though they be ſonge) are not called high maſſes, for they are not that maſſe that is appointed for that day, but of our Lady, of S. George, of S. Dionice, S. Frauncis, or ſome other. But what maſſes ſoeuer you ſing or ſay, the moe the worſſe, and the fewer the better. For the beſt is but Idolatry, der

               The Fryar.
               Wee lye in our clothes in bedde, without ſheetes, and yet we keepe our ſelues cleane. We goe to bedde at 8▪ a clock, and riſe at halfe an hower paſt a leuen. We returne to our bedd at halfe an houre paſt 2, or moſt commonlie at three, and riſe againe at ſixe. When we haue doone (or when any one of vs hath doone a miſſe) he that hath offended muſt doo penaunce. Our penaunces are to faſt bread and water, to ſit and dine vpon the earth, to kiſſe our bretherens (the Fryers) feete, to whyp our ſelues the ſpace of halfe a quarter of an houre, more or leſſe, according as the cheefe father thinketh good. we dare not ſpeak one to another in the night time, except neceſſity cōſtraine vs. We dare not ſtrike one another, in ieſt or in earneſt. Our whips are made, ſome of whyp corde the length of mine arme, with long knots cūningly wrought. Other of our whyps are made of yron chaines, ſuch as women are wont to hang their keyes vpon. Other haue their whips with ſiluer pins, to the intent that the backe canker not. My whyp is made of whypcorde. I had another made of the foreſaid chaines, which I haue vſed manie times. I haue (be it ſpoken to the honor of God) whipt my ſelfe often times: I think forty times & aboue. In which whipping, as I feele often times extreame paine, ſo alſo I haue heauenly cōſolations, in ſo much that it is an eaſie thing with me now, to giue my ſelf 400. ſtripes at once before that I leaue. (God knoweth I lye not) when we whip our ſelues, either for deuotion ſake, in remembraunce of the bitter paſſion of our Sauiour, or els when wee whyp our ſelues for penaunce, we doo put of our garments to the reynes of our backe, and turne our hood aſide, ſo that our backe, armes and ſhoulders are naked, being ſo naked, with a diſcipline (as we call it) or a whip in our hande, one of the Fryers beginneth the 50. Pſalme of Dauid, ſaying: Miſerere mei Deus, ſecundum magnam miſericordiam tuam. And all the while that he ſayeth the Pſalme, the other whippeth himſelfe. In the meane ſeaſon, whilſt that one doth ſay the foreſaid pſalme. I haue giuen my ſelfe for deuotion ſake (becauſe that Chriſt was whipped for me) foure hundred ſtripes. Euery Friday, from our Ladies day in Lent, to May day, I whip my ſelfe for your ſake. And I pray for you, vnto the intēt that it may pleaſe God to turn your harts, & ſaue your ſouls.

               Procéeding in the declaration of the ſtraightnes of your life▪ you ſay that you lie in your clothes in bed without ſhéetes▪ and yet you kéepe your ſelues cleane. It may be ſo, for you haue leaſure enough to knacke your créepers, when they begin to moleſt you, and Sta
                     ••
                  ſacre, is a ſoueraine thing to deſtroy that cattell that is accuſtomed to bréede in the beddes and boſomes of ſuch laſye Lubbers, as doo accuſtome themſelues to lye in their clothes. If it bée a point of holines to lye in bedde without ſhéetes, then are the common ſort of people in diuers parts in England as holy as you, for they neuer lie in any, & yet they putt of their clothes when they goe to bedde. And I my ſelfe hauing béene in ſome of thoſe parts of the Realme, haue taken ſuch lodging as the Country vſeth, but I haue not lyen in my clothes as you ſay that you doo. I doo know by that little experience that I haue had therein, that after a man is acuſtomed for ſome ſpace to lie in blankets, he will choſe rather to continue that kind of lodging then to change it. But let this matter paſſe, for a Louſe bredde in blankets, is not more holye then that Louſe that is bredd in ſhéetes. And this Epitheten louſie, hath bene thought méete for a Fryer euer ſince I could remember. You ſay that you got to bedde at eight of the clocke. &c. I know diuers Artificers in London (and I think ſuch may be found in Paris alſo) that labouring ſore all the day long, doo not ſléepe before eleuen of the clocke, and yet ryſe againe at foure or fyue at the furdeſt, ſo yt they ſléepe not aboue 6▪ howres in one night, where as by your own confeſſion, you doo commonlie ſléepe 7▪ houres, and doo no labour at all, but loyter all the day long. The Religion therefore of thoſe labouring Artificers, is (in that point) ſtraighter then yours. When you doo (or when anie of you dooth) a miſſe: hee that hath offended muſt doo penaunce. If this be true, thē muſt you all doo penaunce euerie day. For as the Pſalmiſt ſaith. 19. Delicta quis intelligit? Who can be able to tell how oft he offendeth? And Salomon ſaith, Prouerb. 24. Septies cadet iustus (And as your ſort doo reade his words) Septies in die cadet iuſtus. The righteous perſon ſhall fall ſeauen times in a day. But I am ſure, your meaning is not of ſuch offences as Salomon ſpeaketh of. That is, of déedes that are doone, words that are ſpoken, and thoughts that are conceiued contrary to Gods commaundements: but your meaning is, of offences cōmitted againſt the Rules of your Religion. As when you luſt or long after anie

kind of fleſhe, when you be ſlacke in aryſing to ſing your Mattins before your bleſſed Sacrament of the Altar, when being drowſye, you ſinge not luſtilie, when you paſſe by anie of your Idoles, and doo not dowke lowe enough to them, when you lowte not lowe enough to your Prior, and other your auncients in Religion, when you thinke not ſo reuerently of euery point of your Religion as you haue béene taught to doo, when you behaue not your ſelfe ſo deuoutlie in ſinging your Mattins and high maſſes as you ſhould doo, when you ſpeake to anie of your fellowe Fryers, either at dinner or at ſupper, or in the night, and when you thinke well of, or wiſhe well, to anie of thoſe Heretickes, that haue had the bringing vpp of you, and haue béene too carefull for you. I coniecture that theſe bee the miſdéedes that you muſt doo penaunce for. As for the breaking of Gods commaundements, that is no offence amongſt Minime Fryers. Well, you ſay that your penaunces are to faſt breade and water. &c. By this I coniecture that your common drinke is wine. Manie honeſt men that laboure ſore, haue water for their common drink. I haue heard of an Abbot in England, that inioined his horſe ſuch penaunce, becauſe he felt him too luſtie & ſturring vnder hym. Syrra (ſaid the Abbot to his horſekéeper) ſée that you giue not thys horſe any thing for the ſpace of theſe tenne dayes, but onely breade and water. Was not this great pennance for the poore horſe to endure thinke you? The quality and quantity of your bread may bee ſuch, that it ſhall rather be a pleaſure then a puniſhment to bee put to that pennaunce. But graunt that your breade which you eate when you be put to penanuce, be ſuch as King Achab commaunded to be giuen to Michaeas the Prophet. 3. Reg. 22. The bread of tribulation, and the water of ſorrow: Yet what a ſatiſfaction is this, for ſo haynous an offence, as the tranſgreſſion of the leaſte of Gods commandements. Adam was inioyned much greater penaunce thē this, and much longer time then for the ſpace of one day. For it was ſayd to him by God himſelf. In the ſweat of thy face thou ſhalt eate thy breade, all the daies of thy life, till thou ſhalt be turned againe into the earth. &c. And yet all this penaunce could not ſatiſfy for that one ſinne that he committed, when he taſted of the forbidfruite. Yea although all his poſterity euen vnto this day, had doone, and we & our poſteritie ſhould doo, ſuch penaunce as you ſpeake of, continually, euen to the end of the world: yet all this long penaunce

could not reuerſe this ſentence, pronounced by God himſelfe. Morte morier

                     s. Thou ſhalt die the death. Onely the death of him, in whom there neuer was any ſinne, is ſufficient to ſatiſfy for all ſinne. Your dyning vpon the earth with bread and water: the kyſſing of your brethren the Friers féete, the whipping of your ſelues for the ſpace of halfe a quarter of an howre, more or leſſe, at the diſcretion of the chéefe father, may be ſome outward ſigne of inward ſorrow conceiued for ſome offence committed, and ſome argument of deteſtation thereof inwardly in the heart▪ But an Hipocrite may doo as much as all this, and yet delight in his wickednes ſtill. Reade the 58. Chapter of Eſaies propheſies. Nunquid tale est 
                        •
                     eiunium quod elegi? per diem affligere hominem animam ſuam? &c. Is this the faſt that I haue choſen (ſaith the Lord, by the Prophet) for a man to afflicte his owne ſoule for the ſpace of a day? to bowe downe the heade like a Bulruſh? to lye in ſackcloth? wylt thou call this a faſt and a day acceptable to the lorde? &c.
               But when the chéefe father himſelfe ſhall offende, who ſhall moderate his whippings. I hope you wyl reſolue me in that doubt at your next comming into England. &c. You dare not ſpeake one to another in the night. &c. Your whips are made of whipcorde. &c. Your ſilence is not to be miſliked if it be voide of ſuperſtition. That your whyps are made, ſome of one matter, and ſome of another, is not much materiall. But the lacke of ſuch a hand to vſe the whips as our Bedles in Bridewell haue, is the cauſe that you laye on ſo manie hundreds at one time, and féele ſuch heauenly conſolation, after you haue laid ſo many hundred laſhes vpon your owne backes. If you long to be well whipped for your ſinnes, or in the remembrance of the bitter paſſion of our Sauiour, make a ſteppe ouer the Seas into England, and come to our Bridewell, you ſhall finde a good fellowe there, that will giue you foure laſhes with his whypp that ſhall be more worth then any foure hundreth of thoſe laſhes that euer you gaue your ſelfe, with any one of thoſe whippes that you haue vſed. Well, I will deſcant no longer vpon your apyſhe whypping. Whippe your ſelfe ſtill euery Fryday from our Ladye day in Lent, till May day, for your

purchaſe our peace is fallen vppon him. And by his woundes and ſtripes we are made whole. Wee néede no ſuch mediators as the Minime Fryers are. And except you doo in your prayers begge a better thinge for vs, then turning of our hearts from the loue and beléefe of the Goſpell of Chriſt, to the loue and beléefe of Antichriſtian popery, I pray you make your prayers for thoſe fréends that you haue on that ſide the ſeas, for you haue ſayd before, yt amongſt vs you haue not one fréende.
            
            
               The Fryer.
               This is (ſay you) the life that I leade, and that I am likely to leade: in faſting and praying, in penaunce and payne, and great trauell. This life I haue choſen to ſerue God in, no man lyuing compelling me: of my owne free wyll I tooke it vppon me. Many there were that did what they could to hinder me, vſing manie meanes to put it out of my head, yet haue I gone forward. Peraduenture you will aske me the cauſe, why I haue taken vpon mee this life. I aunſwere you, for my ſinnes and for yours. VVhy was our bleſſed Sauiour borne in a ſtable of horſes, without pompe & vanitie? VVhy was he circumciſed & his bloode drawn? why did he trauell from place to place, from Cittie to Cittie, from Village to Village, preaching, praying, faſting, healing the ſicke, & working miracles? VVhy did he ſweate his precious bloode, when hee prayed in the Mountaine of Olyues? VVhy was hee betrayed by the traytor Iudas, bound with chaynes, mocked and ſcorned, ſpyt vppon and whypped, ſtroken vppon the face, crowned wyth thornes, & hanged vpon the Croſſe by thoſe merciles Iewes? what was the cauſe why holy Saint Iohn Baptiſt, eate nothing but locuſtes and wyld honny, being apparaled in hayre? All theſe paynes both of our Sauiour Chriſt and of his forerunner, were they not for our ſinnes? Coulde not our bleſſed Sauiour with his word redeeme our ſoules that were damned to hell fyre, by the diſobedience of our firſt father Adam, as well as he created them by hys worde? Our ſinnes then were the cauſe of the paſſion of our Sauiour, for if we had not ſinned, he had neuer died. Conſider thys I pray you, if another ſuffer for my ſinnes, ſhall not I my ſelfe ſuffer?
            
            
               Crovvley.
               The life that you leade, and are likely to leade, is hypocriticall, damnable and deuilliſh▪ Hypocriticall, becauſe it conſiſteth all together in outward ſhewes of holines, whereas when it

is layd open, there is none other thing to be founde in it, then ſuch as is to be founde in the graues of dead men, as our Sauiour ſawe to be in ye liues of the Phariſeis. Math. 23. Damnable it is. For that it is Antichriſtian. And deuilliſh: for that it ſauoureth nothing of that heauenlie wiſedome that is from aboue, comming down from the father of lights, but it is earthlie, and beaſtly, and diabolicall, as bleſſed Iames hath writtē Epiſtle Chap. 3. This life you haue choſen fréelie, and of your owne accorde, and could by no meanes be ſtayed from it: that therein you might ſerue (not God, but) Gods ſworne enemie, the Antichriſt of Rome. You imagine that wee wyll aſke you wherefore you haue made this choiſe: you anſwere, for your owne ſinnes and ours. Oh thou child of the deuill, full of all guyle and diſceite: dareſt thou ſhoulder Chriſt, and thruſt thy ſelfe into the office of mediation, which belongeth onelie to Chriſte? canſt thou (wretched Frier) ſatiſfie to God, bothe for thine owne ſinnes and for ours? This blaſphemie of thine hath enforced mee, to vſe thée in ſpéeches as S. Paule vſed the Sorcerer Elymas at Paphus. Acts. 13. But to make your matter good: You aſke why Chriſte our Sauior would be borne, circumciſed &c. As though all thoſe actions of his, had béene but examples for vs to follow. Some of theſe actions of his, were in ſome ſort examples for vs to followe: but if we ſhall take vpon vs (as you doo) to folow them all, or any of them, with purpoſe to redéeme thereby, either our owne ſinnes, or ye ſins of other, either in the whole or in parte: we ſhal bee but Apyſhe, as you be, and blaſphemous in that wee take vppon vs that which belongeth to that one onelie mediatour betwixte God and man, euen the man Ieſus Chriſt.
               Take héede leaſt that fall vpon thée (Fryer Iohn Francis) which fell vpon Elymas, reade Acts. 13. And yet furder to adde more authoritie to your owne dooing. You aſke of vs, why holy S. Iohn Baptiſt did eate nothing but Locuſtes and wyld honnye. &c. And your concluſion is▪ that all this was for our ſinnes, euen as the ſufferings of our Sauiour Chriſt were. Thus you make many mediatours, where God hath made but one. 1. Tim. 2. But héere you vſe a ſtrange point of Logicke, concluding very ſtrangely: vpon an As ſtrange an Aſſertion. Could not our bleſſed Sauiour (ſay you) as well by his word redéeme our damned ſoules, as he did by his worde create them? Which manner of ſpéech dooth import as much

as if you ſhould ſay, no man can or dare open his mouth to deny it, for it is a truth confeſſed of all men. But what doo you inferre vppon this? Therefore our ſinnes were the cauſe of the paſſion of our Sauiour. If you ſhould make this argument in the Schooles in Lutecia: the Sorboniſ
                     •
                  s would hyſſe you out of their Schooles. The Diuines alſo would tell you, that the premiſſes are not yet graunted, although your graund Pryor, and your holy father the Popes holines, would ſoothe you in it. The Diuines doo (by a generall conſent) ſay, that becauſe the burden of ſinne, and the damnation due vnto it, is ſo great and horrible in the ſight of GOD, that the wrath of God for ſinne, could not otherwiſe be appeaſed, nor his iuſtice ſatiſfyed, then by the cruell and bloodie death of that man that neuer had ſinned, neither was by any meanes ſpotted or defyled with ſinne, and therefore had not any way deſerued to die. And heerevpon they conclude, that of neceſſitie, the onely begotten ſonne of God, in whome there coulde be no ſinne, muſt take mans nature of the ſubſtaunce of a bleſſed virgine, prepared before of GOD for that purpoſe, that the nature of man taken of her ſubſtaunce, might not haue in it any part of mans ſinne, and that, that ſonne of God, béeing both God and man, might die in his mans nature, that blooddie death that mans ſinne had deſerued, and ſo Gods wrath myght be appeaſed, and his iuſtice ſatiſfyed, which could neuer haue béene brought to paſſe by any other meane. Héereof wee may conclude, that in ſome ſort our ſinnes were the cauſe of the death of our Sauiour Chriſt. This leſſon you had once learned, and did repeate it openlie in my Church at Creplegate of London, in the preſence and hearing of a great multitude of Chriſtians, which conceiued no ſmall hope, that you béeing borne of ſuch Chriſtian Parents (as you were) and brought vp vnder ſuch maſters, as had ſo inſtructed you in Chriſtian Religion, that beeing but of tender yeeres, you were ſo perfect in the principles of that our Religion, woulde haue prooued an excellent Miniſter in the houſe of God, to the great ioye of ſuch as had béene at charge in your education, and to the furthering of Chriſtes glory in the Realme of Englande, your natiue Countrey. But ſée howe 
                     •
                  athan hath bewitched you. You are nowe become apyſſing potte in the Chamber of Antichriſt. Thys commeth of thy pryde, Samuell, GOD gaue thée good gyfts, that thou ſhouldeſt haue vſed them to his glory, but thou haſt pryded thy ſelfe

in them, and haſt euery way abuſed them, and art fallen into the handes of God (which is a thing moſt horrible Heb. 10.) The Lord for his mercie ſake open the eyes of thyne vnderſtanding, that thou maiſt ſée the greatnes of thine owne miſery, and acknowledge the great fault of thine Apoſtacie, and craue helpe at the hande of our heauenlie Father, whoſe mercy is as great as him ſelfe, and is alwaies ready to receiue euery Prodigall ſonne that returneth home againe vnto him, and ſéeketh after euery ſheepe that is gon aſtray. Returne therefore Samuell, returne to our heauenly Father. Be no longer called by that hypocriticall name of Fryer Iohn Frauncis. Thy name Samuell, which was giuen to thée in thy Baptiſme, is not yet blotted out of our heauenly Fathers Regiſter: neyther ſhall be before the day of thy departing out of this life. Return in time, ſéeke God whilſt he may be founde, call vppon him whylſt he is at hande, and hath his cares open to heare all ſuch as call vpon him faithfully. Make not ſo light a matter of ſinne, as to thinke that Iohn Baptiſtes féeding vpon Locuſts and wylde honney, &c. could be any helpe to take away anie part of the damnation due to our ſinnes. Be aſhamed of that fonde perſwaſion that mooued you to ſay thus. Conſider this (I pray you) If another ſuffer for my ſinnes: ſhall not I my ſelfe ſuffer? You ſéeme to be perſwaded, that of neceſſity we muſt ſuffer for our owne ſinnes, becauſe Chriſt hath ſuffered for them alreadie. Whereas (in verie déede) the contrarye is moſt true. Becauſe Chriſte hath already ſuffered for our ſinnes, therefore we néede not to ſuffer for them. For his ſuffering for our ſinnes is ſufficient, and is a full ſatiſfaction for the ſins of ye whole worlde. And there remaineth nothing to be doone by vs, but onelye by faith to take the benefite of that his ſuffering, and to ſhewe our ſelues thankfull to him, for that it hath pleaſed him to ſuffer for vs, and by his ſuffering to reſtore vs to the fauour of the heauenly maieſty againe. Which thankes we render when wee mortifye our fleſhlie affections, and make our bodies

hath ſuffered for your ſins▪ you are by his ſuffering redéemed from your ſinnes, and from euer laſting damnation, due to your ſinnes, and by his reſurrection iuſtified, and made righteous in the ſight of the heauenly Maieſty, and diſcharged of your ſinnes paſt for euer. Rom. 4. And when you ſhall by the frailty of your fleſh fal and commit ſinne: follow the counſell of Chriſtes déere Diſciple Iohn, that wrote the hiſtory of the Goſpell, and thoſe thrée Epiſtles that are called Canonicall. In the ſecond Chapter of the firſt of thoſe thrée Epiſtles, he writeth thus. My little babes, I writ thus vnto you▪ that you ſhould not ſinne: but if anie man doo ſinne, we haue an Aduocate with God the Father, euen Chriſte Ieſus the righteous, he is the obtainer of mercy for our ſinnes. The words of Iohn in the Latine are theſe Ipſe eſt propitiatio. I thinke I can not tranſlate them better for the vnderſtanding of the meaning by the Engliſhe Reader, then as I haue, that is: He is the obtayner of mercy for our ſinnes. We néede not therfore to ſéeke for a ghoſtly father, that may heare our confeſſion, and giue vs penaunce and abſolution. Chriſt hath alreadie ſuffered penaunce for our ſinnes, and hath abſolued vs. We néede not to runne to Rome for pardon. For GOD hath alreadie pardoned all our ſinnes paſt and repented, becauſe we beléeue that promiſe of pardon, that he hath made in the death and blood ſhedding of his onelie begotten ſonne, our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt. And when we ſinne by frailtie, wee haue an open way in vnto the mercie ſeate of God, by and through our Sauiour Chriſt, who is the way, the truth and the life. Iohn. 14.

               We reade in the fift of Leuiticus: how our Lorde commaunded the children of Iſraell to doo penaunce, when they had committed any offence. Iudg. 21. Vniuerſus Iſrael valde doluit, egitque poenitentiam, ſuper hoc quod fiebat. All the Children of Iſraell were very ſorry, and they did penaunce for that which they hadde doone. Holie Iob, in the 24.

Let this therefore ſuffice to ſhewe you, that in vaine I haue not taken vpon me this kinde of life, the which I haue therefore ſpecified, at large vnto you: becauſe you deſired ſo earneſtlie, to knowe howe I am likelie to lyue.
            
            
               Crovvley.
               Héere you haue heaped together a nūber of Scriptures, to a farre other ende, then they were at the firſt written. That is to prooue that you were moued by thoſe Scriptures, to make choyſe of that Religion wherein you liue, and that otherwiſe you coulde not eſcape the heauy wrathe of GOD, and ſo conſequently, that who ſoeuer will eſcape Gods wrath muſt doo as you doo. And firſt you ſay, we reade in the 5. Chapter of Leuiticus &c. In this place of Leuiticus▪ there is not one word that may rightly be applyed to your purpoſe, as ſhall (I hope) plainelie appeare, euen to your ſelfe, if you can with indifferent iudgment reade that which heere followeth.
               And firſt I muſt admoniſh you of one point of peniſhe ſuperſtition, that ſheweth it ſelfe in all that be of your ſorte, as often as you haue occaſion to tranſlate into Engliſh, this Latine word Dominus. For ſuperſticiouſly (as I take it) you ad vnto it the English of the Latine Pronowne Noſter. Yea, though there be in the circūſtance of the text, nothing to be founde that might giue you any occaſion ſo to doo. As in this place of Leuiticus, you haue no occaſion at al to ſay: Our Lord God commaunded the Children of Iſraell. &c. For

the commaundements that are written in that Chapter, are gyuen by Moſes, by whom the Lord God of Iſraell did ſpeake to the children of Iſraell. And Moſes ſpeaking to them in the name of that Lorde that bidde him ſpeake vnto them, dooth not vſe any ſpéeche that may bee rightly tranſlated into Engliſh, Our Lord. For thus he ſaith in the place that you cite. Anima quae iurauerit, & protulerit labijs ſuis, vt vel male faceret, vel bene: et id ipſum iuramento & ſermone firmauerit, oblita
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      postea intellexerit delictum ſuum: agat poenitentis am propeccato, & offerat. &c. A ſoule that hath ſworne, and hath vttered with his lippes, that he will doo either euill or well, and hath confirmed the ſame by an oath and by ſpéeche, and hauing forgotten the ſame, ſhall afterwarde vnderſtande his falt: let him repent for his ſinne, and offer a ſhée Lambe, or a ſhée Goale of the flockes, and the Prieſt ſhall pray for that forgetfulnes or ignoraunce, and for that mans ſinne. &c. What is héere written that might mooue you to ſay, that our Lord commaunded the children of Iſraell to doo penaunce when they had committed any offence? I muſt admoniſhe you alſo of your fault, in tranſlating continually penaunce, in ſtéede of repentaunce. For as (commonly) when the Latine word Dominus is vſed in the Scriptures, it dooth ſignifie that mighty Lorde which is Lorde of all, & is not to be reſtrained by anie Pronowne, from that Generall ſignification, as to ſay, my Lord, our Lorde, or their Lord, becauſe he is not onely, mine, ours, or theirs, but the Lord of all: Euen ſo the worde Poenitentia is not to be drawne to an outward ſhewe of repentaunce onely, which may be called penaunce, and may be as well in Hypocrites, as in ſuch as be penitent in déede. The Grecians (as you knowe, I thinke) doo name it by a name, that by interpretation doth ſignifie, Poſt factum ſapere. To bée late wiſe, as in Engliſh we vſe to terme it, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , is, whē a man remembreth himſelfe better then he did when hee tooke in hand an action, wherewith he beginneth to miſlike after the déede is doone. As in your preſent caſe, it may be, and I hope it wyll ſhortlie come to paſſe, that you returning to your former minde, wyll miſlike with your diſobedient manner of departing from your naturall Parents, and with your diſloyall leauing of your natiue Countrey, and ſo repent that you haue bound your ſelfe by a vowe to liue a Minime Fryer all the dayes of your life, which is to be vnprofitable, bothe to your Parents and Countrey, directly contrarye

to the Lawes both of God and of nature. If it ſhall pleaſe GOD to worke this 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   in you, you muſt, (if you will doo well) return to that firſt vowe which was made for you when you were baptiſed, and leaue the latter vow, repenting that euer you were ſo mad as to make it, béeing (as it is) ſo contrary to that vowe which you firſt made in your Baptiſme, and profeſſed afterwardes before ſo manie witneſſes. Follow not the example of Herod & ether, which making vowes did wickedly, but more wickedly in the perſorming of thoſe vowes. Math. 14. Judg. 11. Acts. 23. Wée knowe what your maiſters of Rhemes, either haue taught, or can teache you touching this matter. If you be determined, and will not hearken to better aduice, we can but wyſhe you well, and ſorrowe to ſée your wilfull follye.
               But to returne to the place of Leuiticus the fift Chapter, which you alledge: if you will looke into the Hebrew text, you ſhall finde no ſuch worde as you ſéeme to take holde vppon. The worde that is vſed there, can not ſignifie to doo penaunce: but doth ſignifie, that he may confeſſe that wherin he hath ſinned, or offended. This place therefore, ſerueth nothing for your purpoſe. The next place that you alledge, is out of the 21. of the Judges. 
                     Ʋniuerſus Iſrael valde doluit, & poenitentiam egit, ſuper hoc quod fiebat, ſay you, but that tranſlation, that is beſt allowed by men of your ſort, hath it thus. Super interfectione vnius tribus ex Iſrael. Howe can you then tranſlate it thus into Engliſh. All the people of Iſrael were very ſorry, and they did penaunce for that which they had doone? But if you will looke into the Hebrewe text, you ſhall find that you ſhould haue ſayd thus. The people ſorowed for the Beniamits, becauſe the Lord had made a breache in the tribes or kindreds of Iſraell. The thyrd place is out of Job. Chap. 24. Dedit ei Deus locum poenitentiae. God of his wonderfull mercy, gaue man place to doo penaunce. You vſe a Pariphraſis in this tranſlation, to make the place more forcible for your purpoſe. But thus you ſhould haue tranſlated it. God gaue him place of repentaunce. But if the Hebrewe text be of any credite with you, you wyll ſay thus. Dabit ei fidutiam, & immitetur, & oculi eius ſuper vias eorum. Which may be thus Engliſhed, out of this Hebrewe like Latine. Though God doo giue him boldnes, and he doth truſt therein, yet his eyes be vpon their wayes. Howe is it poſſible to picke any matter out of this text, whereby your whypping

penaunce may be vnderpropped? But this text doth rather miniſter matter againſt you. For it ſayth, that although you bee bolde, and doo truſt to you hypocriticall penaunce, yet God doth ſtil beholde your wayes. Your hypocriſie that deceiueth men, can not deceiue him. The fourth place that you alledge is (as you ſay) out of Salomons Sapientiae. 11. But if you wil giue credit to S. Hierom, that booke is Pſeudepigraphus. That is (if you vnderſtand not that worde) it hath a wrong tytle, in that it is called the Wiſedome of Salomon. Thus writeth S. Hierome, In praefatione in libros Salomonis. Nonnulli ſcriptorum veterum, hunceſse Iudaei Philonis affirmant.
                   Some of the auncient wryters doo affryme, that this is the worke of Philo the Jewe. Yea and he ſaith that the very ſtile thereof doth ſauour of the Greeke eloquence. I note this, becauſe you Romaine Catholickes, doo make all the Bookes that are founde in the Byble of like authoritie.
               But nowe to the words of the place alledged. Diſſimulas peccata hominum, propter poenitentiam. Thou (O Lord) doſt diſſemble the ſinnes and iniquities of men, vnto the intent that they may doo penaunce. In the Gréeke it is, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , that is, ad poenitentiam. To repentance. The circumſtaunce of the text giueth, that God béeing mercifull to all creatures, doth not alwayes make it knowne to men that he knoweth the ſins of men, for he doth not puniſh them in haſte, but he giueth them time & ſpace to remember themſelues better, and to repent, before he take in hande to puniſh them. Thys repentance is an harty ſorowe for the ſinne paſt, and a full purpoſe and earneſt endeuoure to walke in a new way in the time to come. And as for penaunce to be doone for ſatiſfaction, is altogether vnneceſſarie, for Chriſt Jeſus hath diſcharged that matter already. But if he had not, the penaunce that we could ſuffer could not help vs. Your fyft place is taken out of Eccleſiaſticus. 2, Chapter. If the Gréeke text were not out of credite with you Rhemiſts, & Romiſh Catholickes, it might ſuffice foraunſwere to this place, to ſay ſhew it in the Gréeke, and then we wyll ſay, you haue ſayde ſomewhat. But Si poenitentiam non egerimus, is▪ not founde in the Gréeke, neyther doth the circumſtance of the place require, nor yet well ſuffer it. For thus hath Sirach written there: Qui timent Dominum, custodiunt mandata illius: et patientiam habcbunt vſque ad inſpectionem illius, dicentes. (Si poenitentiam non egerimus) I ncidemus in manus Domini,
                  
                  & non in manus hominum. Secundum enim magnitudinem ipſius, ſic & miſericordia illius cum ipſo eſt. They that feare the Lorde, doo kéepe his commaundements, and will haue patience till they may beholde him, ſaying: We will fall into the hands of the Lord, and not into the handes of men. For according to the greatnes of himſelfe, ſo is his mercie with him. Héere I haue left out, (if we wyll not, or if we ſhall not repent) and yet is the ſentence of Syrach perfect and the ſence good. And in the Gréeke it is thus. They that feare the Lord, will ſéeke to be accepted of him. And they that loue him, will be filled with the Lawe. They that feare the Lord, wyll prepare their harts, and will humble theyr ſoules in his ſight. Wée wyll fall into the handes of God, and not into the handes of men. For as is the greatnes of himſelfe, ſo is his mercy alſo.
               A man might aſke héere, what néede there is of this ſentence, Si poenitentiam non egerimus: If we repent not, or as you wyll haue it, if wée doo not penaunce. But let it be euen as you haue it in your common tranſlation, and procéede as you doo, ſaying: And what is this? To fall into the handes of our Lord. You anſwere Horrandū
                     est (ſaith S. Paule. 10. ad Hebraeos incidere. &c. It is an horrible thing to fall into the hands of our liuing God. Yet had I rather falt into his handes, then into the pawes of our aduerſary the deuill. I thinke your Romaine Catholickes will not like well wyth you, for that you ioyne the Epitheton (liuing) with God, although you doo quallifye it by adding the Pronowne Noster, or Our. But let them deale with you for that. I would fayne knowe of you, howe you can fall into the handes of the lyuing God, in ſuch ſort as S. Paule meaneth of in theſe wordes to the Hebrewes: and yet eſcape the pawes of the deuill. S. Paule ſpeaketh there of ſuch as doo reproche the ſpirite of Grace, as your ſelfe haue doone in theſe wrytings. And are (I feare me) fallen into the hands of the liuing God, who in iuſtice hath deliuered you into ye pawes of the deuill, whom he maketh his Executioner: and at his good pleaſure, he can, and (when you ſhall 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   that is, repent) vndoubtedly he wyll, rydde you out of thoſe pawes of the deuill againe. Your ſixt place is taken out of Ieremie. 31. Conuertiſti me, & egi poenitentiam. Thou haſt con
                  
                     •
                  erted me (O Lord) and I haue doone penaunce. It is ſome gréefe to me to conſider the great blindnes that you are fallen into. The Prophet Ieremie doth (in theſe wordes that you cite, and in thoſe words that goe immediatly before, and that doo follow immediatly

after) propheſie, or ſhe we before hand, that in time then to come, the people of the kingdome of the tenne trybes or kindreds of Iſraell, (whom he calleth Ephraim, becauſe their firſt king Iereboam was an Ephramite) ſhould be conuerted and turned, from theyr Idolatrous, heathiniſh, and falſe Religion, to embrace the true Religion of God, from which they were fallen in the dayes of the wicked Kinges, that had raigned in that kingdome of Iſraell or Ephraim, and were for that Apoſtacie, conquered by the Aſſyrians, and the remnant of them carryed into ſtrange landes, farre off. Of thys conuerting or turning of the poſterity of this people, the Prophet Ieremie dooth write after this manner. Audiens audiui Ephraim tranſ
                        •
                     igrantem (or as it is in the Hebrewe) plangentem. Castigaſtime Domine, et eruditus ſum (or as it is in the Hebrew) castigatus ſum, quaſi iteuencus indomitus. Conuerte me & conuertar: quiatu Dominus Deus meus. Poſtquam enim conuertistime, egi poenitentiaem: & poſtquam ostendistimihi, per cuſſi femur meum. Confuſus ſum, & erubui quoniam ſustinui opprobrium adoleſcentiae meae. &c. I haue in verye déede (ſayth the Lorde) heard Ephraim, flytting out of his Country (or as the Hebrewe hath it) making great or pittifull lamentation. ſaying after this manner) O Lord, thou haſt corrected mee, and I am thereby inſtructed (or as the Hebrewe hath it) I am chaſtened like an vntamed Bullocke. Doo thou turne me, and then I ſhall bée turned, for thou art the Lord my God. And after thou haddeſt turned me: I repented And after thou diddeſt ſhe we vnto me (that is after thou diddeſt let me ſée the filthines of myne owne life) I dyd ſtrike my thigh. I was confounded, I was aſhamed, for I did beare the reproche of mine owne youth. Is not Ephraim a ſonne that I eſtéeme much off? Is he not a Ladde in whom I am delighted? For ſince I haue ſpoken of him: I will ſtill remēber him. And therfore, the bowels of my compaſſion are mooued towardes him, and in pittie I wyll haue compaſſion vpon him, ſayth the Lord. The due conſideration of theſe wordes might haue moued you, to doo the contrary, of that which you ſay, you were by them mooued to doo.
               Ephraim had forſaken the right Religion of GOD, and hee had embraced the Religion of Baall▪ which was a wrong Religion, he had forſaken the precepts, and commaundements of God, and embraced the precents and commaundements of men. He had refuſed to hearken to the voyces of the true Prophets of God: and had gyuen eare to the Prophets of Baal, which were falſe Prophets. Hée

had left of to walke in thoſe right and high wayes, that the Lorde had taught his own people to walk in, & he had choſē thē to walk in by waies, ſuch as ye Lord forbad his people to walk in. And haue not you doone ye like? You were baptiſed in the right faith of Chriſt Jeſus, which your Godfathers & your Godmother confeſſed, at ye time of your baptiſing, and deſired (for you) that you might be baptiſed in that Fayth, which they did then confeſſe: And you were baptiſed in that fayth, and were named Samuel. But nowe, you are called John Frauncis (as your ſelfe haue written) and therefore, I feare you haue renounced your firſt Baptiſme, and haue béene rebaptized in the Romyſh Catholike fayth: profeſſing and promiſing to beléeue and to doo, all that, that Antichriſtian Church teacheth and commaundeth. You were brought vp in the knowledge of your duety towards God, and your duety towards man: but nowe you call that knowledge hereſie, and ſuch as haue béene your inſtructors therein heretikes. You haue, and doo ſtyll refuſe to heare the voyce of the Preachers of the Goſpell of Chriſt, which are the true Prophets of this time: and your eares are open to the voyces of the preachers of popyſh ceremonies, fayned and falſe miracles, and all manner deuiſes of men, which are the falſe prophets of this time. You haue left the way of truth, wherein God requireth his owne people to walke, ſeruing him in ſpirite and truth, that is, in true holines & righteouſnes: and you haue choſen to walke in by waies, euen ſuch as the Lord hath forbidden his people to walk in. Namely the hearing of maſſes, and therein, gyuing diuine honour to creatures, that is, to bread and wine therein vſed, and holden vp and ſhewed, that they may be worſhipped by ſuch as be preſent. In kyſſing the Reliques of Saints, in the ſuperſticious refrayning of the vſe of Gods good creatures, wherein God hath giuen liberty to all men, that will reuerently vſe them, and be thankfull to him for them. In making inuocations and prayers to Angels, & to deade men, ſuch as be called Saints, not knowing whether they can hear you, or whether they can helpe you or no. In praying for the deade, not knowing whether they doo ſtand in néede of your praiers or no. Yea not knowing whether your prayers, may profite them or no. In honouring God and hys Saints by Images, directly contrary to hys expreſſe commaundement: Thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelfe any grauen Image. &c. In vowing, & performing the vow of wyueleſſe

chaſtitie, and yet with this cauſion. Si non castè, tamen cautè. If not chaſtlie, yet warily. In performing the vowe of wilfull pouertie: and yet enioy all thinges neceſſary in great plenty. In taking vpon you ye yoke of obedience to ſuch as God hath not commandèd you to obey: but ſhaking of that yoke of obedience, that God hath layd vpon all mens neckes. Namely, to naturall Parents, Princes and al maner of Gouerners. In dooing penaunce (as you terme it) by faſting bread and water, by dyuing vpon the earth, by whypping your ſelfe, with a diſcipline of whypcords, or chaynes of wyar, or with pynnes of ſiluer, taking vpon you by theſe meanes to redéeme your owne ſinnes, and the ſinnes of others alſo. And ſo conſequently, entruding your ſelfe into the Office of Chriſt, which is to be the onelie mediatour betwixt God and man, and the onely propitiator to obtaine mercy for the ſinnes of the world. If you had conſidered theſe words of Ieremie, aright and as you ſhoulde haue doone, applying them to your ſelfe (as I hope nowe you wyll doo) then you would haue cryed with Ephraim (as I hope you will nowe crye) Turne me, and I ſhalbe turned, for thou art the Lord my God. And when the Lord ſhall turne you, as I hope he will at the laſt turne you, ſo that you ſhall from the bottome of your harte repent, that euer you left the highe way of righteouſnes, to walke in theſe by wayes of wickednes: you will not (as you terme it) do penaunce, in whypping your ſelfe with your diſcipline (as you call your whip wherwith you haue giuē your ſelf ſo many hundred laſſhes) but you will ſubmit your ſelfe vnder the mightie, and mercifull hand of our heauenlie father, to be chaſtined at his hande, according to his good pleaſure, that by his fatherly corrections, you may be brought to ſée the greatnes of your owne folly, wherein you haue walked. And ſo with Ephraim, ſtrike your ſelfe on the thigh, and ſay: I am confounded and aſhamed. I haue borne the rebuke of my youth. And then vndoubtedly the Lord wil ſay of you, as he did of Ephraim. Is not Samuel a ſonne that I make greate account of? Is he not a ladde in whom I am delighted? Sith I haue ſpoken of him, I wyll ſtill remember him. And therefore the bowels of my mercy are bent towardes him. In pitty and compaſſyon I wyll haue mercie vpon him. Which God graunt for his mercy ſake. Amen.
               If you wyll not receiue this charitable admonition, and receiue

againe and loue that trueth, from which you haue for a time béene turned away, and haue loued lyes more then the truth, yea and haue indéede hated the trueth and loued lyes: I feare me that the threatning of the Apoſtle. 2. Theſ. 2. wyll be fulfilled in you. Ideo mittet illis Dens. &c. God will therefore ſende vpon them the ſtrength of error, that they may giue credite to lyes, that all they may be condemned that haue not beléeued the trueth, but haue had pleaſure in iniquity. Thys is ye horrible falling into the handes of the lyuing God that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of. Heb. 10. From which the Lord for his mercy ſake deliuer both you and me. Amen.
               You procéede in your purpoſe, and thus you ſay. But goe furder, and you ſhall heare our Sauiour himſelfe, by his owne mouth, calling vs to penaunce, in the 13. Chapter of S. Luke, ſaying: Sinon feceritis poenitentiam: omnes ſimul peribitis. If you wyll not doo penaunce, you ſhall perriſh altogether. And héere you vſe an exclamation. O what a dolefull ſentence: you ſhall periſh altogether. Let vs therefore cry with the Prophet Ieremie. &c. as before. But ſée howe you are deceiued, by giuing credite to ſuch notes as you haue receiued at the hands of your Rhemiſts, and Romiſh Catholickes. I can not thinke that your ſelfe reading the wordes in Luke, the 13. Chapter, would haue ſet downe ſimul for ſimiliter: as in thys your wryting you doo, and doo deſcant vpon it, noting the horriblenes of the ſentence, and ſo conſequently, the neceſſity of dooing penaunce, to as many as be not willing to periſh together. The wordes that the Euangeliſt writeth, were ſpoken by our Sauior himſelfe. The occaſion was, a report made vnto him, of the crueltye that Pilate vſed towards certaine of the Galileans. Doo you think (ſayth our Sauiour) that theſe Galileans were greater ſinners, then the reſt of the Galileans were: I tell you no. But except you haue repentance, you ſhal all in like maner periſh. And heere one other thing wherein your notes haue deceiued you. The text hath thus. Sed niſi poenitentiam habueritis. But except you haue repentaunce. And you following your notes (as I ſuppoſe, for I can hardlie be perſwaded, that ſéeing the text, you would ſo mangle it) doo ſet it downe thus. Sinon feceritis poenitentiam: If you doo not penaunce, you ſhall periſh altogether. I would wyſhe you therefore, to take good héede henceforth, how you truſt the iudgment of thys Romiſh Catholike Church, that maketh no conſcience thus to

mangle the wordes of Chriſt himſelfe, reported by his holy Euangeliſtes. But hetherto, you ſhewe your ſelfe to be perſwaded, that you haue not without iuſt cauſe taken vpon you the life of a Minime Fryer. But howe well you haue prooued this, by thoſe Scriptures that you haue (for that purpoſe) alledged: I think your ſelfe doo nowe ſée, and are aſhamed that euer you tooke this enterpriſe in hande.
               Thus much for aunſwere to that long diſcourſe that you haue made, concerning your departing from your parents, and the maner thereof. Your long and labourſome trauell in Fraunce, before you could créepe into the habite (or wéede as you terme it) of a Minime Fryer, and howe you behaued your ſelfe in all that wearyſome trauaile. And laſt of all, howe happy a man you thinke your ſelfe to be, for that you are now wéeded (as you▪ terme it) with that wéede, and haue ſo played the part of a Nouice▪ that lyking, and being well liked of the Fryers of that Order, you are nowe a profeſſed Fryer, and haue changed your name, and are no more called Samuell Debnam, but Fryer John Frauncis, and therefore likelie ſo to liue during your naturall life.
               But nowe we haue another Crowe to pull. You haue made a meruailous inuectiue againſt our Religion, with an earneſt and pithy exhortation to your Parents, to forſake both our Religion and vs alſo. And laſt of all, a very Chriſtian inſtruction (as you ſéeme to be perſwaded) but indéede a very Antichriſtian direction, howe they may and ought to behaue themſelues, in this caſe wherin they doo nowe liue, and are likely to continue. And thus you enter into this excellent péece of worke.
            
            
               The Fryar.
               Nowe, as concerning your Religion (whoſe foundation is the deuill of hell, hys Miniſters beeing, Tyndall, Fryth, Luther, Caluine, Beze, Zuinglius, Phillip Melanthon, Bucer Phagius, Oecolampaduts, and Berengarius, with others his Miniſters, in England & els where. As Crovvley, Barber, Doue, Chark, Novvell, Mollins, Trippe, and the reſt, whoſe harts God turne, or cutt ſhort theyr liues, to more ſpeedy conuerſion of our poore Countrey. Theſe are they of whom the holy Apoſtle Saint Iohn ſpeaketh of in his firſt Epiſtle Chap. 2. Ex nobis prodierunt, ſednon erant ex nobis: nam ſi fuiſsent ex nobis permanſiſſent vtique nobiſcum. That is to ſay, they came from vs, but they were not of our company

or ſociety. For if ſo be that they had beene of our company, they had certainly ſtayed with vs. It is euident that they came from vs, as not liking our kind of life. Some came from vs by reaſon of pryde, otherſome, by reaſon of deuilliſh ſuggeſtions. Againe, others becauſe theyr heades were full of fantaſies, as the heade or Maſter Fielde is, Who (yf the report that goeth of hym be true) is able to forge, euery halfe houre, a newe Religion. Luther was an Augustine Fryer: who after that he had left his Order, beganne hereſie. Caluin was a Cannon Reguler, and Berengarius was an Archdeacon. Whoſe liues and deathes, as alſo the lyues and deathes of the other Captaine Proteſtantes, if you knew thorowly, you would (as I hope) not onely wonder at their wilines, but alſo leaue their folly. But mine intention, is not at this preſent to write theyr behauiours, which (God wylling) ſhall be publiſhed in another page. Mine intention is onely, by the grace of God, to withdrawe and turne your hartes, from the beleefe of thoſe damnable hereſies which you holde, which I beſeeche God that I may performe for his names ſake.
            
            
               Crowley.
               I would gladly ſtay my penne, from blotting my paper with bitter or opprobrious wordes, but (alas) I can not, for the fire of zeale towards Gods glory, is ſo kindled in myne harte, that I can not hold in, ſuch ſpéeches as this blaſphemer deſerueth. The ſpéeches ſhall (I hope) be ſuch, and ſo vttered: that euen the blaſphemer himſelfe ſhalbe enforced to confeſſe, that the wryter ſéeketh nothing leſſe, then the priuate reuenge of ye priuate wrong that is doone vnto himſelfe. The open wronge that is doone to Chriſt, and to his bleſſed name and Religion, is it that mooueth me to ſay (to this boy Fryer) as the Apoſtle Paule ſayd to Elymas the Sorcerer. Acts. 13. O thou child of the deuill, full of all guyle and diſceitfulnes: thou enemy of all righteouſnes, dooſt thou not ceaſe to peruert the right waies of the Lorde? Take héede (thou blaſphemer) of that which followeth in that text. Dareſt thou ſay, that the deuil of hel, is the foundation of Chriſtes Religion? Thou calleſt it our Religion, becauſe we profeſſe it: and we acknowledg that in that meaning, it is ours indéede, & we are not aſhamed of it. But in thy meaning, we deny it to be ours, for wee are not the Authors of it. It is a reuerent feare and loue towards the maieſtie of God, which the holy ſpirit of Chriſt hath wrought in our

harts: whereby we are mooued to ſéeke to knowe his wyll, and to ſerue him according to his wyll. The foundation of this Religion, is the Law of God, and the Goſpell of Chriſt. For the Lawe dooth worke in vs feare, and the Goſpell worketh loue. By the lawe, we are ſeruants, but by the Goſpell we are children, that is, adoptiue ſonnes and daughters, of God himſelfe, and inheritors of hys kingdome, and heyres annexed with Jeſus Chriſt, his onely begotten Sonne. This Law did God himſelfe wryte, firſt in the hart of the firſt man, in his firſt creation, and after in Tables of ſtone, and deliuered the ſame to Moſes, as his eſpeciall and choſen Miniſter, that by his miniſtration, it might bee made knowne to his people, the poſteritie of Abraham, Iſaac, and Iacob. And the ſame Law, is by the finger of God written in our harts in our regeneration or newe byrth, wherein we are borne from aboue, by water, and by the holy Ghoſt: hauing receiued the ſpirite of Chriſt, which crieth in our harts to the heauenly maieſty, Abba Pater, Father, father. The Goſpell alſo, was firſt preached to the firſt man, and to the firſt woman, when God himſelfe ſaid thus to the Serpent. I wyll p

This Goſpell was a gladde tydings to the firſt mā and his wife, and they both beléeued it, and by that beléefe, were they diſcharged of the ſinne which they hadde committed, in taſting of the forbidden fruite, which S. Paul calleth Juſtifying. And continuing in this beléefe, they had this promiſed ſéede. Chriſt, their continuall Aduocate as we haue, ſo that, ſo oft as they did by f

                     us ab origine mundi: That Lambe that hath béene ſlayne, euen from the beginning of the world. Apo. 13. This Goſpell was continually preached, both before the Lawe written in Tables of ſtone, and alſo vnder that Law, by Sacrifice, as by ſhaddowes and figures. Heb. 10▪ as alſo by the miniſtry of the Prophets. But when Chriſt Jeſus, which is this promiſed ſéede came: he preached this Goſpell in his owne perſon firſt moſt plainlie, amongſt them that were his owne peculier people. And afterward he preached it amongſt the nations of the world, by the miniſtry of his Apoſtles or meſſengers. And thus the knowledge

heere of came to al Nations of the world. Amongſt whom the Grecians thought good to call this Goſpell (which in our olde Engliſhe was named Gods ſpeale, that is to ſay, Gods word) by the name Euaggelion, which name doth by interpretation ſignify, Gladde tydings. This Goſpell or Glad tydings (ſo called becauſe it dooth aſſure vs of frée pardon, and full forgiuenes of all our ſinnes by the onely mediation of our onely Mediator, Chriſt Jeſus) is that Goſpell that Chriſt Jeſus doth ſtyll preache amongſt vs by the miniſtry of them, whom you call Heretickes. Howe dare you now ſay that the foundation of our Religion is the deuill of hell? Is the deuill of hell, the Lawe and the Goſpell? But (for your recreation, as it may ſéeme) it hath pleaſed you to vſe the figure Parentheſis, and therein to ſet downe a long Regiſter of the names of ſuch as you call the deuils miniſters, to whom you wyſh, either conuerſion, or els ſpéedy diſpatch out of thys life. This petition may wée (with greater and more Chriſtian loue, both towards you and our Countrey) craue at Gods hand for you, and for all your ſocietye. You ſette downe our names very diſorderly, euen as they came to your troubled memory, or as ſome man had gathered them, and deliuered them to you in ſome torne péece of paper. It may be, that neither you, nor anie that hath giuen you inſtructions, did at any time knowe many of them whom you name, nor reade any thing written by them. And yet (like a bolde blinde Bayarde) you promiſe to write and publiſh their behauiours in another Page. You may (perhaps) doo if: but with as ſmall commendation; and as great ſhame, as others haue doone before you. It is written to our comfort, that if ſuch as you, did call the good man of the houſe Belzebub: howe much more will ſuch call them of the houſholde ſo? It is one good ſigne that we be of the houſholde of Chriſte, when we be for Chriſtes cauſe, called as Chriſt himſelfe was, and by ſuch as called him ſo. Math▪
                   10. The Phareſies, (your Aunceſtors in hipocriſy) ſhamed not to ſay vnto him, euen to his face. Do not we ſay well, in that we ſay thus. Thou art a Samaritan, and haſt a deuill. Iohn. 8. And ſhall we thinke much that you backbite vs, and in your ſlaunderous Lybels charge vs, with crimes, which you are not able to prooue, more then the Phareſies could prooue that Chriſt was a Samaritane, and had a deuill. For mine owne part (ſyr boy Fryer) make what report you dare, (better experience

you haue not had of any, for you haue béene in my houſe, and at my charges, a long ſeauen yéeres) but take héede that your pen ſcribble no lye, in the report that you ſhall make of mee: for if you doo, I wyll (if GOD gyue life and hability) ſo paynt you wyth my penſell, as you neuer painted your naked backe wyth your hipocrites diſcipline or whyp.
               You apply vnto vs the ſaying of the holy Apoſtle S. Iohn, the firſt Epiſtle. Chapter. 2. Ex nobis prodierunt. &c. If you be (as you ſay you are) a Papiſt of the ſociety of Papiſts: then you apply that ſaying rightly to vs ſo farre forth, as that you ſay that wee came forth from you, and were not of you. But if that ſociety of which you meane, be the Catholicke Church, whereof ye Church of Rome that was in S. Iohns time was a principall member: then that ſaying of S. Iohn can not be rightly applyed vnto vs, but to you. For not we, but you, are gone out from them, & were not of them. And we are gone out from you, and were not of you, for you are Antichriſtians, and we are Chriſtians, as thoſe Romaine were in the dayes of S. Iohn. But wyll you ſée what S. Iohn ſaith in the ſame Epiſtle. Cap. 4. Hée doth there teache you howe to knowe Antichriſt, and ſo conſequently Antichriſtians. Omnis ſpiritus qui ſoluit Ieſum, ex Deo non est, & hic est Antichristus, de quo audistis quoniam venit, & iam nunc in mundo est. Euery ſpirite that loſeth or diſſolueth Jeſus, or the Sauiour, (for ſo dooth the name Jeſus ſignify) is not of God, and the ſame is Antechriſt, of whom you haue heard that he commeth, and he is euen nowe in the worlde. Who be they that may be ſayd to loſe or diſſolue Jeſus, (which is the Sauiour) but they which doo as you doo. That is, aſſcribe one part of your ſaluation to Jeſus Chriſt, and another to your owne workes and merites? If you can find any better interpretation of this place, let vs at your leaſure ſée it. If not, leaue your diſſoluing of Jeſus, and ioyne with vs in aſcribing your whole ſaluation to the mediation of Jeſus Chriſt as we doo. But perhaps, you wyll héere 
                     •
                  lée from your olde allowed tranſlation, and for an aduantage take holde of the Gréeke text, which is thus. Euery ſpirite that denyeth, or doth not confeſſe, that Jeſus is come in the fleſh, is not of God, &c. But what can that helpe your cauſe? Jeſus Chriſte came in the fleſh, that he might treade the wine preſſe of Gods wrath, alone, and not to haue any one to helpe him. Eſay. 63. Hee came in

the fleſh, that he might be wounded for our iniquities, broken for our great and wicked ſinnes, that the correction wherby we might be reconciled myght fall vpon him, that we might bée made whole by the brwſing of his ſtripes. Eſay. 53. Agayne, S. Paule. 1. Tim: 1. Thys is a true ſaying, and méete to be receiued of all men, that Chriſt Jeſus came into this world to ſaue ſinners. And in Math. 1. Hée ſhall ſaue his people from their ſinnes. And in S. Iohns Goſpell. 1. Beholde him that taketh away the ſinnes of the worlde. By all theſe places it is plaine, that whoſoeuer aſcribeth any parte of our ſaluation, to any other then to Chriſt Jeſus alone, denyeth him to bée come in the fleſh, and is of that Antichriſt that S. Iohn ſpeaketh of. 1. Epiſtle. 4. You are therefore Antichriſtians, and we are for good cauſe come from you, becauſe we were not Antichriſtians, and therefore not of you. We are returned to that Romiſh Catholicke Church that was in Johns time, from whom you came out, becauſe you were not of them And we doo now beléeue, as they beléeued then. They beléeued then, that there is but one God that hath made all creatures, and him they glorifyed in the vſe of hys creatures, and they gaue thankes to hym alone for thoſe creatures, and ſtudyed to ſerue him onely, in ſpyrite, and and with ſpiritual ſeruice, fléeing from the example of the Heathen Nations, that preſumed to counterfayte his maieſtie by Images. Rom. 1. And ſo doo wée. They beléeued and confeſſed that all men are ſinners, and that man can not iuſtify himſelfe before God, becauſe no man can ſo kéepe the Lawe but that his own conſcience ſhall condemne him as a tranſgreſſor: & therefore, they dyd cleaue to the mercy of God, and ſo doo we. They beléeued that they were iuſtified (that is, diſcharged of their ſinnes) fréely by fayth, wythout the déedes of the Law: and yet they thought themſelues bound to doo all that God had and ſhould make them able to doo in obſeruing and fulfilling the Law: and ſo doo we. Rom. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. They beléeued that God making choyſe of them, had in mercy made them his owne children by adoption, inheritours of his kingdome, and heyres annexed with his onely begotten ſonne Chriſt Jeſus, and héere of they were aſſured by the ſpirit of Chriſt, which was gyuen to them, and cried in their harts Abba Pater, Father, Father: and ſo doo we. They beléeued, that this election and choyſe was made, in the fore knowledge and purpoſe of GOD, before them

ſelues were, and ſo conſequently, before they eyther had or coulde doo, good or euill: and ſo doo we. Rom. 9. They beléeued, that as they were by frée mercy of God. adopted, predeſtinated, called, iuſtified, and acquitted of their ſinnes, and in Gods predeſtination glorifyed, and made like to the Image of his onely begotten ſonne Chriſt Jeſus. Rom. 8. So their duety was to be carefull to leade a righteous life before men, and not be bolde to commit ſinne, (becauſe God had in mercy diſcharged them of ſin) but to liue in awe, and a reuerent childlike feare of his iuſtice, as they that would ſhewe themſelues continually thankfull for his mercy, in making their owne bodies a Sacrifice to God, lyuing holy and acceptable vnto God, as theyr reaſonable ſeruing of God. Rom. 10. 11. 12. And euen ſo doo wée. They beléeued that theyr duety was to ſubmytte themſelues, to all ſuch as God had ſette ouer them in authoritye, and to obey them, not onelie for feare of puniſhment, but for conſcience ſake alſo, knowing that whoſoeuer reſiſteth power, reſiſteth the ordinaunce of GOD, and doth purchaſe to himſelfe damnation. And they beléeued that their duety was to giue euery man his owne, and to vſe louing behauiour towards all men, knowing that loue is the fulfilling of the Lawe. And that béeing baptiſed they had put vpon themſelues Chriſt, and ought to walke and continue their liues in honeſty, not making prouiſion for the fleſhe, to ſatiſfy the luſtes thereof. Rom. 13. and euen ſo doo we. They beléeued, that although God had gyuen them liberty in the vſe of al his creatures: yet their duety was to haue a continuall regarde to the infirmitie of their brethren
                     ••
                   and not to vſe any of thoſe creatures to the offence of any of them. Rom. 14. 15. and euen ſo doo we. They beléeued, that they, together with all other Chriſtians els where, in any part of the worlde, were fellowe members of one bodye in Chriſt, and vnder Chriſt alone, acknowledging no vniuerſal heade of that body but onely Chriſt Jeſus alone. Rom. 12. And euen ſo doo we.
               Thus you may ſée, that we are not departed from the Catholicke Romaine Church, which was in the time of S. Iohn, but from you, that departed from them, more then 1000. yéeres before this day. You put many of Gods creatures in the place of God, in repoſing truſt in them, in calling vpon them and crauing helpe at theyr handes, in rendring thankes vnto them, in honouring them,

in and by their Images, in ſeruing thē, and in conſecrating daies, Temples and Altars to their honour. You preſume vppon your owne power, as they that are able, either to fulfill the Law, or els hauing broken the Lawe, to ſatiſfie to God for your ſinne in breaking the Lawe, and to that end you faſt from fleſh, you goe and lye woolwarde, you riſe at midnight, you ſing mattins and maſſes, you whyp your ſelues with your diſciplines or whyps, not following therein any commaundement of God, or example of good man. For where hath God commaunded men to refrayne the neceſſary and honeſt vſe of his good creatures? And where hath he commanded men to be their owne formentors? What one man or woman can you name, amongſt the Patriarks, the Prophets, or Apoſtles, that formented themſelues, as you doo torment your ſelues, if your owne report be true? In the Lawe we reade, that if a man had deſerued to be chaſtiſed with ſtrypes, and were condemned by the Judge to be chaſtiſed: yet the number of ſtripes might not in anie caſe excéede the number of fortie. Deut. 25. Chap. But you ſay that euery Frydaie, from our Ladie day in Lent, to May day, you doo whyp your ſelfe for your Parents ſake, & doo gyue your ſelfe 400. ſtripes at euerie time (as I thinke) for you ſay it is an eaſye thing with you nowe, ſo to doo. Well, whyp on ſtill, till you ſhal heare me ſay: whoe. And if you ſhall not haue whipping chéere enough at Nigeon in Fraunce, ſteppe ouer the water into Englande, and at your requeſt, I wyll helpe you to ſome of our whypping chéere in Bridewel, where one laſhe that our whypping Bedles doo giue, is worth a whole hundred of yours in Nigeon.
               
               But to returne to our purpoſe. You ſay that we came from you, not lyking your kinde of life. It is very true, and ſo long as you leade ſuch a kinde of life as you doo, which is hypocriticall, wee minde neuer to returne to you againe. But where you doo charge vs with pryde, deuilliſh ſuggeſtions, and heades full of fantaſies, I muſt vſe an Engliſh prouerbiall ſpéeche, and ſay: Take your ſelfe by the noſe, and ſaie foole I haue caught thée. The harts of thoſe men that you ſpeake of, and are departed this life, were well knowne vnto God, & ſo are ours that doo yet remaine in this vale of miſery. We ſhall be all iudged one day, by him that will iudge iuſtlie. And what art thou that iudgeſt another mans ſeruaunt? But héere (by the way) I muſt tell you of your ingratitude towards

M. Fyelde, whoſe purſe, penne and hand, haue béene helping to you, ſo that if you had regarded either chriſtian duety or charitie, yea or ciuile honeſtie, you would not haue ſo harkened to a falſe report, that you would haue noted him before all others, for coyning of ſo manie newe Religions, where he neuer coyned any. Staie your ſtile therefore (I aduiſe you, yet once againe) and peſter not that page that you threaten to publiſh, with lyes, eyther learned by report, or caſt in your owne moulde. For if you doo: But hauing ended your long Parentheſis, you goe on with your matter, and ſaie thus: My intent is onelie. &c. A peſtilent intention. To withdrawe & turne the harts of your father & mother from the beléefe of the Goſpell of Chriſt: (the word of ſaluation that is graffed into vs, and is ſufficient to ſaue our ſoules) which you moſt blaſphemouſlie call damnable hereſie. And for habilitie to bring this intended miſcheefe to paſſe: thou (moſte vile wretch) dareſt open thy moſt blaſphemous mouth, to craue helpe at hys hande, that in iuſtice, may (yea muſt) and I doubt not, ſhortlye wyll, confounde thée and all ſuch as thou art.
               But nowe you goe luſtily about your buſines, and you gyue ſo fierce an aſſault, euen at the firſt, that you ſéeme to be perſwaded, that you are in poſſeſſion of the Forte, before you come in place where you may plant your batterie: yea and before you haue, or doo know how to come by, anie ſuch péeces of Ordinaunce, as may be able to batter the walles and make them ſaltable. You ſay thus (to your Parents, I trow, for your Letters are directed to them.)
            
            
               The Fryar.
               You ſay, that we are fooles to pray for the deade you denie good workes to be meritorious of our ſaluation, affyrming that by faith onely we are iuſtified. And which is moſt horrible, deteſtable, and abhominable. You vnſhamefaſtly, and moſt irreuerently, deny the reall preſence, of the moſte precious bodye and blood of our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, to be in the bleſſed Sacrament of the Altare. You ſay that there be but two Sacraments. An hereſye condemned long a goe. Many other opinions, not onelie fooliſh, but alſo execrable, and damnable you holde, which leade you the right way to eternall damnation in hell fire.

               Héere is a meruailous péece of Ordinaunce. Who could hope that a poore Showmaker and his wife, altogether vnlettered and vnlearned, and therefore naked and vnarmed, and

vnprepared to withſtand ſo puiſſaunt an aſſaltant, as Frier John Frauncis is: ſhould not at the firſt ſummons, come foorth, euen with Halters about their necks, and offer the keyes of their Forte to this valiant Captaine, and ſubmit themſelues to his mercy. Yea where ſhall we finde one amongſt the learned on the Proteſtants parte, that dare encounter with this monſtrous Golias, that hath ſo boldly defied the whole Armie of Iſraell? But leaſt Frier John ſhould thinke that I write Ironice, I wil ſtaie my ſtile for a ſpace, that I may ſée how this couragious Captaine wyll enforce hys ſo ſharpe an aſſault.
            
            
               The Fryar.
               For the firſt, (ſayth he) that is to ſay prayers for the dead: becauſe you admit not the words which the holy Docters of the Catholike Church haue ſpoken: I wyll turne you to the Byble it ſelfe. Which if you dare either plainly deny, or interprete falſely: you are nowe no longer heretickes, but playne Infidels. Looke therefore I beſeeche you, in the 12. Chapter of the ſeconde booke of Machabees, towards the ende of the Chapter, you ſhall there finde, howe a Captayne of the Iewiſh Armie, named Iudas, made a collection of money to be offered at Ieruſalem, for the ſinnes of thoſe Souldiours, which for a good and iuſt quarrell, were ſlayne in battaile. Furdermore, if you wyll take the paynes to reade the latter words of the ſame Chapter, you ſhall finde the concluſion of the ſame Chapter to be this. Sancta ergo, et ſalubris est cogitatio, pro defunctis exorare, vt a peccatis ſoluantur. It is (ſayth he) therefore, a holy, and a wholſome thought, to pray for the dead, that they may be releaſed from their ſinnes. Tell me not nowe (I pray you) a tale of a tubbe, with a quote in the margnet, ſaying: That the foreſayd place of holy Scripture, was not written by the holy Ghoſt. For if ſo be that you be come to that point, as to belye the holy. Scripture, well may it be ſayde of you, which is written by holye Eſay, in his booke of prophecies. Chap. 6. Aure audietis, et non intelligetis. You ſhal heare with your eares, but you ſhall not vnderſtande. Seeing you ſhall ſee, & ſhall not perceiue, for your harts are hardened. Wyth your eares you haue heard vnwillingly, and you haue bent downewardes your eye ſight, leaſt you ſhoulde peraduenture ſee with your eyes, heare wyth your eares, and vnderſtand with your harts, and ſo being conuerted, God ſhould heale you.

               In vewing the Forte of our fayth, you ſéeme to haue determined to batter foure of the eſpeciall Bulworkes thereof. Namely, the denyall of Prayers for the dead. The denial of works to be meritorious of ſaluation. The denyall of the reall preſence of the body and blood of Chriſt in the bleſſed Sacrament of the Altar. And the denying that there be any moe Sacramēts then two. To batter theſe Bulworkes, you will not bring any Ordinaunce taken out of the Storchouſe of the holie Fathers, but you wyll vſe that great forcible Ordinaunce, that is to be had in the Storehouſe of the holye Bible: and therewith you wil batter and beate down the ſtrongeſt parts of our Forte of Faith. Againſt the firſt Bulworke, you plant a péece of Ordinaunce taken out of the 12. Chap. of the ſeconde booke of Machabees. Againſt the ſeconde Bulworke, 2. péeces of Ordinaunce, one taken out of the Epiſtle of S. Iames, and the other out of the 25. Chapter of S. Mathewes Goſpell. Againſt the third, you doo plant foure péeces of Ordinaunce, one taken out of the 26. Chap. of S. Mathew, one other taken out of the 14. Chapter of S. Marke, the third out of the 22. of S. Luke. and the fourth you take out of the ſixt Chap. of S. Iohns Goſpell. But againſt the fourth Bulworke. you bring no Ordinaunce at all, neither out of the Storehouſe of the Bible, nor out of the Storehouſe of the holie Doctors of the Catholicke Church. Onely you ſay, that it is an hereſie condemned long ago.
               But let vs ſée, of what force theſe péeces of Ordinaunce be. The firſt ſéemeth a farre off, to be a double Cannon of great force. But at hand, it is founde to be but a ſillie Baſe, emboſſed and made great, by cunning clowting together of Paſte made of paper, in the forme of a double Cannon, with the colour of Braſſe cunningly layde vpon it. Who would not thinke that this were a Cannon of great force, when he ſhall heare the Captaine himſelfe ſay. I will turne you to the Bible it ſelfe? which if you dare either deny. &c. you ſhalbe no longer Heretickes, but plaine Infidels. Looke I beſéeche you. &c. A Captaine of the Jewiſh Armie made a collection &c. Yea, and the latter wordes of the Chapter, are theſe. Sancta ergo & ſalubris est cogitatio. &c. And tell me not nowe (I pray you) a tale of a tubbe. &c. Yea and laſt of all, well may it be ſaide of you, Aure audietis & non intelligetis &c. But let vs drawe néerer to this terrible péece of Ordinaunce, that we may ſée of what force it

is. Firſt, becauſe Fryer John dooth charge vs, that we admitt not the words which the holy Doctors of the Catholicke Church haue ſpoken: I require him to reade that which S. Ierome hath written, in his preface vpon the bookes of Salomon, immediatly after thoſe wordes that I put you in minde of when I anſwered to that ſentence that you alledged out of the booke of Wiſedome, Chap. 11. S. Ierome writeth thus. Sicut ergo Judeth, & Tobiae, & Machabeorum libros, legit quidem Eccleſia, ſed eos inter canonicas ſcripturas non recipit, ſic & baec duo volumina legat, ad edificationem plebis: non ad authoritatem eccleſiasticorum dogmatum confirmandam. Euen as the Church dooth (indéede) reade the bookes of Iudith and Tobias, and of the Machabees, but dooth not receiue them amongſt ye Canonicall Scriptures, euen ſo ſhe may reade theſe two bookes (meaning the booke of Wiſedome and Eccleſiaſticus) to the edifying of the people, but not for the confirming of Eccleſiaſticall doctrine. Loe (Maſter Frier John) one of the holie Doctors of the Catholicke Church, hath tolde you, that this Scripture was not written by the holie Ghoſt, and yet I trowe you will not ſay that he hath tolde you a tale of a tubbe, nor that he hath belyed the holy Ghoſt, or that the ſaying of the holie Eſay, may be well applied vnto him. But if your ſelfe would vouchſafe to reade the laſt lynes of this ſeconde Booke of Machabees, I thinke you woulde not thinke this booke to be of ſuch authority as hetherto, you haue in theſe writings ſéemed to thinke. For in the wordes written in thoſe lynes, the author or writer of this booke, dooth ſhewe himſelf to be in doubt whether he haue doone ſo well as himſelfe wiſhed to doo: and in caſe he haue not doone ſo well, he craueth pardon of his Readers, and vſeth a ſimilitude to perſwade him to pardon him. Which is a thing all together vnſéemely to be doone by the holie Ghoſte. Yea I ſuppoſe your ſelfe woulde account it blaſphemie, in him that wold ſay, that the holy Ghoſt may doubt whether ought that he doth bée well doone or not. And if you will take the paines to reade the latter part of the 14. Chapter of this booke, you ſhall finde there a great commendation giuen to one Razias, for that he murthered himſelfe, which commendation could not come from ye holy Ghoſt. For ſuch murder is not onelie contrarie to the expreſſe commaundement of GOD, but it is contrarie to nature alſo. Yea, and I doo yet thinke, that though you doo thinke, that you doo deſerue much

at Gods hande by whypping your ſelfe with your diſcipline (as your ſelfe doo report) yet you are not perſwaded that you ſhoulde deſerue more, if either by whipping your ſelfe or otherwiſe, you ſhoulde kill your ſelfe.
               Moreouer, if your ſelfe be not of that number that Eſay the Prophet ſpeaketh of in the ſixt Chapter of his booke (cited by your ſelfe) then there is hope that you will not ſticke to reade, & weigh the circumſtaunces of the place in the 12. of this ſecond booke of the Machabees, that you doo ſo much vrge vs with. In the text that goeth immediatlie before that, which you doo beſéeche vs to looke vpon: the Hiſtorian hath ſaide, that after the Armie of Gorsias was by the mighty power of God put to flight, Iudas (hauing gathered his Army together) came to the Cittie Odolla. And when the ſeauenth day was come, and they were purified according to the cuſtome, they did in the ſame place ſpende the time of the Sabaothe. And the next day following, Iudas came with his company to take vp the dead bodies of them that were ſlaine, and to bury thē with their fathers, in the buriall places that belonged to them. And they founde vnder the garments of them that were flayne, certain of the gifts that had béene offered to the Idolles that were at Iamnia, from which the Lawe commaunded the Iewes to abſtaine. It was therefore made manifeſt to all men, that this was the cauſe wherefore they were ſlayne. The whole company did therefore commende the iuſt iudgment of the Lord, which had made manifeſt the déedes that had béene hidde and kept in ſecrete. And ſo they gaue themſelues to prayer, and beſought God that the fault which was committed might be blotted out of memory. But the moſte valiant man Iudas, exhorted the people to kéepe themſelues wythout ſinne, hauing euen before their eyes, thoſe things that had happened for the ſinnes of thoſe that were ſlayne. And hauing ended his Collation, he ſent to Jeruſalem, xii. thouſande drachmas of ſiluer, that ſacrifice might be offered for the ſinnes of them that were deade.
               Thus farre goeth the report of that which was doone by Iudas that Captaine of the Jewiſh Armie that you ſpeake of. I haue taken this text out of the tranſlation that is allowed by the decrée of the Tridentine Councell, which tranſlation, you may not diſalow of, for if you doo: you ſhalbe amongſt them that the fathers of that

Counſell haue Anathematized. Take héede therefore, that you haue not offended already, in that you haue ſaid, that the Captain made a Collection, where your text ſayth, facta collatione. I know that our tranſlators that haue tranſlated into the Engliſh, haue ſayd as you haue doone. Hauing made a collection of monye, ſent it to Jeruſalem. &c. In the Gréeke, the ſence is vncertaine, and hardlie can there any perfect ſence be gathered in this place. And this one thing I muſt note, that where this vulgare tranſlation hath twelue thouſande Drachmas, the Gréeke hath but two thouſande Drachmas, which together with the reſt of the circumſtaunces of the text, doo cauſe me to thinke, that Iudas néeded not to make any collection of mony to be ſent to Jeruſalem. For the ſumme béeing no greater, he might very well ſpare it out of his owne treaſure (as it may be ſuppoſed.) Hauing therefore ended that Collation or concion which he made to his whole company of Souldiers that then were about him, (wherein he exhorted them, to conſider of that which had happened, and to take warning thereby, to bee carefull to kéepe themſelues from ſinne, leaſt the like ſhoulde fall vpon them alſo) he ſent that ſumme of mony to Jeruſalem, that Sacrifice might be offered there for the ſinnes of them that were deade. Slayne (as you ſay) for a good and a iuſt quarrell, but the Hiſtorie ſaith, that the iuſt iudgment of the Lorde was executed vppon them, for that they had ſtolen and hidde vnder theyr Garments, thinges that hadde béene offered to thoſe Idolles that were at Iamnia, which was by the Lawe forbidden to be doone. But what? would you haue vs to think (as it may ſéeme you doo think) that Iudas Machabeus (béeing a man ſo preciſe in obſeruing ye law of God, as in this Hiſtory it appeareth that he was) would cauſe any newe kinde of Sacrifice to bée deuiſed, or that he would cauſe any of thoſe Sacrifices that Moſes had by Gods direction commanded to be offered, to be vſed for any other purpoſe, then for thoſe purpoſes that God himſelfe had ordeyned them for? If you wyll reade the whole Leuiticall Lawe throughout, you ſhall not finde that euer God did commaunde any ſacrifice to be offered for ſinne other then that which is called a ſinne offering: and was to be offered for penitent ſinners, in ſuch ſort as the Law preſcribeth, which was, in the preſence of the penitent ſinner himſelfe, laying hys hand vpon the heade of the ſacrificed beaſt, thereby ſignifying that

it was he that had deſerued that death, which the innocent beaſt
                     •
                   was then and there to ſuffer. The Sacrifice therefore which Iudas would haue to be offered at Jeruſalem, muſt néedes be of that kind which was called a peace offering, and was to be vſed for the pacifying of Gods wrath, which ſhould at anytime, by any occ
                     ••••

                   of the people for any offence committed amongſt them. Iuda
                     •
                   therefore conſidering that GOD might in Juſtice (as oftentimes he had doone) viſite the ſinne of the Fathers vpon the children, euen to the third and fourth generation, in them that in committing wylling and wilfull ſinne, had ſhewed themſelues to be haters of his Maieſtie: feared leaſt this iuſt iudgment ſhoulde be executed vpon ſuch as remained yet aliue, and were of the poſterity of them that were already ſlayne, for the wickednes that they had committed. The wryter of the Hiſtorie therefore hath doone great wrong to Iudas, in that which he addeth to the ende of this hyſtory, bearing his Readers in hand, that Iudas meant to redéeme by Sacrifice, the 
                     •
                  inne that the ſlayne had committed, and to teache, that to pray for the dead that they may be releaſed of their ſinnes, is a holy and an holeſome cogitation. You muſt therefore prooue by other ſcriptures, more authentiall then this Scripture is, that you are wiſe in that you pray for the dead: otherwiſe we muſt ſay, as you ſay we doo ſay, that you are fooles in déede. And perſiſting in that opinion that you holde▪ concerning the making of prayers for the dead, you will proue your ſelues to be wilfull fooles.
               Thus you may (if you will) ſée of howe ſmall force that péece of Ordinance is, that you haue brought out of the Storehouſe of the Bible, pla
                     •
                  ting it againſt that Bulwork of the Forte of our faith, wherein we ſtande at defence, denying that it is either neceſſary, lawfull, or méete for Chriſtians, to make any prayers to God, for the ſoules of them that are departed this life. And heerein we followe the example of the Patriakes, Prophets, Chriſt Jeſus, hys Apoſtles, and the continuall vſage of Gods people, both before the Lawe written, vnder the Law, and vnder Chriſt, euen vnto thys day. If you, or any of your maſters, haue ought to ſay, out of your generall Counſelles, out of your Schoole Doctors▪ out of the corruption of Doctors (otherwiſe godly) or out of vſages that haue ſprong vp in the time of déepe ignorance: let it be ſet foorth at your

leaſure: and you ſhall haue aunſwere (by the helpe of GOD) as other your prediceſſors in Popery haue had. We doo not denie but you may ſay much, but by the rule of the auncient Fathers, what ſoeuer ſhalbe affirmed, and not approued by the authority of the Canonicall Scriptures, may as eaſily be denyed, as it is affyrmed. Yea, S. Auſten woulde haue no credite, furder then he ſhould prooue by the holy Scriptures, all that he ſhould affirme.
               The ſeconde Bulworke, wherein we ſtande at defence, is, that we deny good workes to be meritorious to ſaluation: affyrming that by faith onely we are iuſtified. Againſt this, you bring two battery péeces out of the Storehouſe of the Byble. One of them is the Epiſtle of the holye Apoſtle S. Iames. And the other is, the wordes of our Sauiour Jeſus Chriſte, written by the Euangeliſt S. Mathew▪
                   Chapter. 25. Both theſe bee double Cannons of great force. But hauing planted them againſt our Forte, and hauing gyuen fire to them with purpoſe to ſhake downe our walles, they recoyle in ſuch ſorte, that your ſelfe are in greater danger to be hurt by the ſhooting of them off, then we (againſt whom yee haue bent them) are. For what haue you in the Epiſtle of S. Iames▪
                   that you doo thinke may annoy vs, or ſhake any part of our Forte? I ſuppoſe that you cannot finde any words in that Epiſtle, that are more forcible then theſe are. Quid proderit fratres mei, ſi fidem quis dicat ſe habere: operra autem non habeat? nunquid poterit fides ſaluare eum? What ſhall it auayle (my brethren) if a man ſhoulde ſay that he hath fayth, and yet hath no workes? doo ye think that faith can ſaue him? And againe. Sic et fides, ſi non habeat opera, mortua est in ſemetipſa. Euen ſo faith alſo, if it haue not workes, it is dead in it ſelfe. And againe. Abraham pater noster, nōne ex operibus iustificatus eſt: offerens filium ſuum Iſaac ſuper altare? Abraham our Father, was he not iuſtified by workes, when he offered Iſaac his ſonne vpon the Altare? And againe. 
                     Ʋidetis, quoniam ex operibus iustificatur homo: et non ex fide tantum. You ſée, that man is made righteous by workes, and not by faith onely. Iames. Chap. 2. I am ſure that theſe be the places that you your ſelfe would picke out of S. Iames Epiſtle, as ſentences that in your iudgement doo make moſt againſt that which we beléeue and confeſſe, which is. That workes be not meritorious to ſaluation. Nowe let vs conſider of theſe ſentences, that we may ſée whether they be likely to make againſt

vs, or againſt you. For the firſt, we ſay (as S. Iames doth) that if a man ſhall ſay that he hath faith, & yet hath no déedes, that ſaying ſhall profite him nothing at all. For although hee doo ſay that he hath fayth, yet he hath i
                     •
                   not indéede. For faith can no more be without good works, then a good trée can be without good fruite. The good trée is neuer without good

                   or Potentià. that is, either in acte or in power. Euen ſo faith, is neuer without good workes, but hath them in power euen when ſhee ſéemeth to be moſt barren and vnfruitfull, and when occaſion ſerueth, ſhee bringeth them foorth, that all men may ſée them, and be aſſured that ſhe is the ſame faith that S. Paul wrote of to the Galathians. Fides qu

               To the ſeconde ſentence, we ſay as S. Iames doth alſo. That is, that fayth which hath no workes, is deade in it ſelfe. Men of your ſorte, can ſometimes take holde vpon diſtinctions, when they hope to haue any aduantage thereby againſt vs, but in the vnderſtanding of the meaning of S. Iames in this place, they can not ſee any diſtinction of fayth at all. No not though the text doo giue them neuer ſo great occaſion to vſe a diſtinction. Your Schoolemen can tell you, that Fides is Triplex. Fayth is of thrée ſortes. Historica, Ciuili

                  p his ſonne Iſaac vpon the Altare.: ſo that nowe he was made righteous before men, as he was before righteous before God in that he beléeued, and was aſſured of the performance of that promiſe that God had made vnto him. Thys fayth is alwayes linked with loue, and worketh by loue, as S. Paule wryteth in the fifte Chapter to the Galathians: and is therefore all in all (as S. Paule wryteth there) and without it, nothing can auayle vs. When we therefore doo ſay that wee are iuſtified by Faith onely, our meaning is, that onely Faith is the meane, wherby we doo apprehend the righteouſnes of Chriſt, which is by the frée gyft of GOD beſtowed vpon ſuch as be faythfull, according to that which S. Paule wryteth 1. Cor. 1. Exipſo autem vos estis in Christo Ieſu
                        •
                      qui factus est nobis ſapientia a Deo, & Iustitia, & ſanctificatio, & redemptio. And by him are you in Chriſt Jeſus, whom God hath made, our wiſedome, our righteouſnes, our ſanctification and redemption. Hauing this righteouſnes, which is in Chriſte, we are in him righteous before God. But lacking this righteouſnes (which without this Faith, we can not haue) neyther Ciuill nor Hiſtoricall fayth can helpe vs. For by them, we can be but righteous before men. The Ciuill fayth can bring forth none other righteouſnes then that which is Ciuill, and ſo make vs ſuch as the Philoſophers were, and no better. And by the Hiſtoricall fayth, we can not be better then are the deuils, in whom that faith bringeth forth, an horrible feare of iudgment, which muſt néedes be ioyned wyth hatred. So that they which haue none other fayth but that, muſt néedes hate God, as the deuill doth. We doo therefore conclude with S. Iames, that man is iuſtified by workes, and not by fayth onely. By workes was Abraham iuſtified before men, when his fayth had brought forth her fruite, which was obedience to the commaundement (Take thy ſonne Iſaac. &c.) which obedience ſprang out of that Fayth that S. Paul wrote of, Rom. 4. Qui contra ſpem, in ſpem credidit, which beléeued in hope, euen contrarye to hope. Thus was Abraham made righteous before men (as S. Paul hath written) and was declared▪ and made knowne to men by hys obedience, which was the good fruite that his good Fayth brought forth. If you lyſt to appoſe your ſelfe againſt S. Paule you may, and in the ende haue the foyle. S. Iames doth not, but

meaneth to mooue Chriſtians, not to make an account of any other fayth, then that which worketh by loue. We will hold with Saint Iames, and not oppoſe our ſelues againſt S. Paul with you. Wée doo ſée that theſe two Apoſtles, being ledde by one ſpirit of Chriſt, agrée in one. Although Paule doo ſay: Arbitramur enim, iustificari hominem per fidem, ſine operibus legis. We ſuppoſe that man is iuſtified by Fayth, without the déedes of the Law. Rom 3. And the other ſayth. 
                     Ʋidetis, quoniam ex operibus iustificatur homo, & non ex fide tantum. You ſée that man is iuſtified by works, and not by faith onely. Iames. 2. Wée doo rather chooſe to be anathematized of your holy father, the Popes holines, and of all thoſe fathers that were gathered together in the Tridentine Councell, then of father Paul, (whoſe holines doth ſurmount the holines of your holy father, the Popes holines.) Father Paul hath written thus in his Epiſtle to the Galathians. Chap. 1. Licet nos, aut Angelus de coelo euangelizet vobis praeterquam quod euangelizauimus vobis: Anathemaſit. Although I my ſelfe, or an Angel from heauen, ſhould preache vnto you anie other Goſpell, then that which I haue preached vnto you: holde him accurſed. The Goſpell that S. Paul had preached to the Galathians and others, was (and is) the Gladtydings of frée iuſtification or diſcharge of all their ſinnes, onely by the mediation of our onely Mediator, our Lord & Sauior Jeſus Chriſt. Take héede (Fryer John) that you be not within the reache of this Anathematization, if you be, 4000. whyſkes with your whip, wil not bruſhe it away from your naked and ſcuruie ſhoulders. I terme them ſcuruy, becauſe I ſuppoſe, that whipping your ſelfe ſo often and ſo ſore (as in your Letters you haue reported) the ſkynne of your ſhoulders and backe can not be without ſkabbes.
               Well, let vs nowe conſider your other péece of Ordinaunce, which is a part of the xxv. Chapter of S. Mathewes Goſpel. Firſt you haue ſayd thus.

               As concerning your opinion, that by fayth onelye we are iuſtified: I referre you to the Epiſtle of the holye Apoſtle S. Iames, as alſo to thoſe words of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, written in the Goſpell after S. Mathew, Cap. xxv. Where it is written, that our bleſſed Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, in the latter day giuing the finall and euerlaſting ſentence (as well vnto the ſaued as vnto the damned) ſhall vtter theſe wordes. Venite benedicti patris mei
                  
                  &c. That is to ſay. Come ye bleſſed of my father, and poſſeſſe the kingdome prepared for you, from the beginning of the worlde. Nowe, hauing ſpoken theſe wordes, he ſheweth the cauſe of thys ioyfull ſentence. For (ſayth he) when I was hungry, you fed mee, when I was a thyrſt, you gaue me to drinke, when I was naked ye clothed me: but what are theſe things if they be not good works? Therefore, and by this place of Scripture, good workes are meritorious to our Saluation. Reade likewiſe (I pray you) the ſecond Chapter of the Epiſtle of S. Paule to the Remaines, a little way of from the beginning. You ſhall there finde, howe God will reward all men according to their workes. The ſame alſo, if you wyll ſearch, you ſhall find, in the xvi. Chap. of S. Mathew, and in many other places of the Scripture. I doo not conclude by theſe partes of the Newe teſtament, that by good workes onely wee are ſaued, but mine intention is to proue, that neither by faith without good workes, nor by good workes without fayth, we are iuſtified or ſaued.

                     a puniuntur: & illi etiamſi mille talia fecerint, per gratiam tamen coronantur. Gratiaenam
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      omnino illa benignitas est: vt pro rebus minimis, & viliſſimis, coeleſte regnum, & tantus honor tribuatur. That is to ſay. For theſe cauſes therefore, both the one ſort, are without iniury puniſhed, and although the other ſort haue doone a thouſand ſuch workes, yet it is by frée mercy that they are crowned. For that bountifulneſſe whereby the kingdome of heauen, and ſo great an honor is gyuen, for the ſmalleſt and moſt vils thinges, is altogether of frée mercy.

Thus hath Chryſoſtome wrytten, as the concluſion of all that hée hath written before in commendation of thoſe that feede the hungry, giue drinke to the thirſty, clothe the naked. &c. and in diſcommendation of them that leaue thoſe workes vndoone. The one ſort (ſayth he) that is (they which leaue thoſe works vndoone) are iuſtlie puniſhed: And the other are crowned, and yet not for the worthines of the workes, although they worke them neuer ſo often: but that bountifull liberality, (wherby the kingdome of heauen, and that great honour of being crowned in that kingdome, are gyuen, for ſo ſmall and vile matters as our workes are) commeth altogether of Gods frée mercy, and not of any worthines, that eyther is or can be in vs, or in any workes that we can worke. This Chryſoſtome is (not onely in this part of his wrytings, but in all his workes) a very earneſt mayntainer of the merites of good workes, and yet ſée howe he co
                     〈…〉
                  udeth. In this concluſion▪ he ioyneth with vs, and we ioyne with him.
               We holde, that good workes, ſuch as GOD hath commaunded, and prepared for vs to walke in, are acceptable in the ſight of God, and that God doth and wyll reward them both in this lyfe, and alſo in the life to come. And we craue of GOD that we may kéepe ſtill in minde the wordes of the Apoſtle. Heb. 13. To doo good and to diſtribute, forget not, for with ſuch ſacrifices God is well pleaſed. Yea, we craue of God, that we doo neuer forget the ſaying of the Apoſtle Paule to Timothe. 1. Chap. 4. Exerce teipſum ad pietatem, nam corporalis exercitatio, ad modicum vtilis eſt: p
                        •
                     etas autem ad omnia vtilis eſt. Promiſſionem habens vitae quae nunc est, & futurae. Exerciſe thy ſelfe to godlines (ſaith S. Paul) for bodily exerciſe, is profitable but to a ſmall matter, but godlines is profitable to all thinges. Hauing a promiſe of the life that nowe is, and of the lyfe that ſhall be. Thys we holde, this we teache, and this we are willing to practiſe. And for a further explanation of the meaning of Chryſoſtomes concluſion aboue mentioned: marke (I pray you) what he wryteth in his 53. Homelie, to the people of Antioche. Omnia quae f
                        •
                     cimus, agimus debitum implentes: proper hoc & ipſe dicebat. Cum omnia feceritis dicite, quia inutiles ſerui ſumus: quae enim debebamus facere, fecimus. I gitur, ſiue charitatem exhibuerimus, ſiue dederimus pecun
                        •
                     asegenis, debitum implemus: non tantum quoniam a beneficijs ipſe cepit, verum & quoniam ipſius bona distribuimus, ſi cuncta
                  
                  erog
                        •
                     mus. All that we doo (ſayth Chryſoſtome) we doo, as ſatiſfying or paying our debt: wherefore he himſelfe alſo (that is Chriſt) did ſay. When you ſhall haue doone all, ſay thus, We are vnprofitable ſeruaunts, for we haue doone thoſe thinges that we ought to doo. Therefore, whether we ſhall ſhewe charity, or whether wée ſhall giue money to the néedy, we doo diſcharge our debt, not onely becauſe he did firſt beginne to beſtowe benefites vpon vs, but alſo becauſe we doo but diſtribute his goods, although we beſtow al that we haue. No man can write more plainly or pithily, for confirmation of that which we holde concerning the meriting by workes, then thys Chryſoſtome hath doone in theſe two places. Thus you may ſée, if you be wylling to ſée, that the holy Doctors of the Catholicke Church, are not ſo contrary to vs in iudgment, as you haue perſwaded your ſelfe that they be: but when their works bée thorowly reade, and the ſcope an purpoſe of their wrytings, thorowly weyghed and conſidered▪ they are found to be of a iudgment contrary to yours, and be of one iudgment with vs. You alledge theſe wordes of our Sauiour Chriſt, as a declaration of the cauſe of our ſaluation. For you ſay, hauing ſpoken theſe words, Venite benedicti patris m
                        •
                     i. &c. Come ye bleſſed of my Father &c. He ſheweth the cauſe of this ioyfull ſentence &c. If you had ſayde, he ſheweth a cauſe your ſpéeche might haue béene ſuffered. For our féeding of the hungry, giuing of drinke to the thyrſty, clothing of the naked, our harbouring of the harbourleſſe. &c. are a cauſe of thys ioyfull ſentence. For they are Cauſa ſine qua non. A cauſe wythout which this ioyfull ſentence ſhall not be pronounced. To them onelie that haue doone theſe déedes, it ſhalbe ſayd. Come ye bleſſed of my father &c. But ſith you ſay he ſheweth the cauſe, your meaning muſt be, that theſe workes are the efficient cauſe of this ioyful ſentence. Which meaning is contrary to the definition or deſcription of an efficient cauſe: which is▪ 
                  A quo primo fit motus. That is, The thing that maketh the firſt moouing. That is to ſay, the thing that doth principally or chéefely worke ye making of another thing. And the efficient cauſe in giuing of this ioyfull ſentence, is by S. Chryſoſtome affirmed to be the frée mercy of God. For in hys 80. Homely vpon Mathew (whereof I haue made mention) he ſayth: Per gratiam tamen coronantur: Gratiae namque omnino illa benignitas est. Although they in whoſe fauour this ioyfull ſentence ſhalbe gyuen,

haue doone a thouſande ſuch workes, yet they ſhalbe crowned through frée mercie: for that bountifull liberality, is altogether of frée mercy. When you haue ſaid he ſheweth the cauſe, you ſay, that he ſayth thus. For when I was hungry, you fedde me, when I was thirſty ye gaue me to drink, whē I was naked, you clothed me: but what are theſe thinges, if they be not good workes? Therfore, and by thys place of Scripture, good workes are meritorious to our ſaluation. If you coulde prooue, or if we would yéelde vnto you, that theſe good workes were the efficient cauſe of the giuing of this ioyfull ſentence (which neither is confeſſed by vs, nor can be prooued by you,) then might your concluſion be allowed of, in the Schooles amongſt Schollers. But ſéeing that all men which haue knowledge to diſcerne one cauſe from another, muſt néedes confeſſe, that theſe workes be but Cauſa ſine qua non▪
                   A cauſe without which that ioyfull ſentence ſhall not be giuen: your argument is as good as this argument is▪ 
                  Baculus stat in angulo. Ergo Deus non eſt in coelo. The ſtaffe ſtandeth in the corner: Therfore God is not in Heauen.
               From this place of S. Mathewes Goſpell, you ſende vs to the ſeconde Chapter of S. Paule to the Romaines, a little way of from the beginning of that Chapter, where you ſay we ſhall finde, howe GOD wyll rewarde all men according to their workes. And you ſay furder, that if we will ſearche, we ſhall finde the ſame moſt euidently, in the xvi. of S. Mathewes Goſpell, and in many other places of holie Scripture. You might very well haue ſpared this laboure. For we knewe before you were borne, that, both in thoſe places that you name, and in many other places of holy ſcriptures, it appeareth euidently, that God will giue vnto all men (or as you terme it, rewarde all men) according to their works. But what can you conclude vpon this? Shall we therefore ſay that workes are the efficient cauſe of our ſaluation? your ſelfe doo deny it. For you ſay thus. I doo not conclude by theſe parts of the New Teſtament, that by good workes onely we are ſaued: but mine intention is to prooue, that neither by faith without good workes, nor by good workes without faith, we are iuſtified or ſaued. Héere you haue flatly denied, that which you haue before, as flatly affyrmed. For before you haue ſayd, that our Sauiour Chriſt ſheweth the cauſe of the ioyfull ſentence, which he ſhall giue when he ſhal ſay:

Come ye bleſſed of my Father. &c. Wherein you affirme (as before I haue prooued) that the good workes that our Sauiour maketh rehearſall of, are the efficient cauſe of gyuing that ſentence, and ſo by good conſequence of our iuſtification or ſaluation. And nowe you ſay that you conclude not ſo, but that good workes and faith together, are the efficient cauſe of our iuſtification or ſaluation. For ſo men of your ſorte doo meane, by that manner of ſpéeche, that you doo vſe héere, when you ſay, by workes or by fayth.
               But we haue another meaning of that ſpéeche, as I will (by Gods helpe) let you vnderſtand. When S. Paul ſayth thus. Rom. 3. Arbitramur enim iuſtificars hominem per fidem, ſine operibus legis. We ſuppoſe that man is iuſtified by faith without the déedes of the Lawe. His meaning is, that faith is the inſtrument yt God vſeth in making vs righteous. Gods frée mercy is the efficient cauſe, and our faith is the inſtrumentall cauſe of our iuſtification. So that God dooth make vs righteous, by that fayth that himſelfe hath wrought in vs by the word of his Goſpell, which is, Virtus Dei in ſalutem omni credenti. Rom.
                   1. The power of God, to ſaluatition, to euery one that beléeueth.
               Thus we may ſée that the word of the Goſpell, is the inſtrument that God vſeth in making vs faithfull, and faith is the inſtrument whereby he maketh vs righteous. Fdes ex auditu: auditus autem per verbum Chriſti. Rom.
                   10. Fayth commeth by hearing, and hearing commeth by the worde of Chriſt (or as the Gréeke hath it, of God.) So that the worde that is preached, and the Preacher that preacheth, are Gods outward inſtruments, which he vſeth in working fayth in the hartes of the hearers. And in this meaning S. Paul writeth thus to Timothe. 1. Tim. 4. Attende tibi & doctrinae inſta in illis. Hoc enim faciens: et teipſum ſalum facies, et eos qui te audiunt. Take héede to thy ſelfe, and vnto doctrine: be inſtant or earneſt therein: for in dooing this thing, thou ſhalt ſaue thy ſelfe, and them that heare thée. Héere we ſée that Timothe being careful in looking to hys owne lyfe, and to the ſoundnes of his doctrine, and being earneſtly bent to teache both by good example of life, and by ſownde doctrine, is by S. Paule ſayd to be, the ſauiour of himſelfe and of them that heare him. And yet it is manifeſt, that he was neither the ſauiour of himſelfe, nor of any other, but an inſtrument that God vſed in working ſaluation, both in himſelfe and in other. Becauſe that by his carefull diligence in looking to his owne lyfe

and ſowndnes of doctrine, and by his earneſtnes in preaching the ſame, fayth was begunne, and increaſed in his hearers, and continued and confirmed in himſelfe. Which fayth, both in him & in his hearers, layd holde vpon, and heldfaſt ye mercifull promiſe of God, made in the mediation of the onely Mediator betwixt GOD and man, euen the man Chriſt Ieſus our Lorde. 1. Tim. 1. And ſo bothe Timothe, hys hearers, and all the reſt, that haue béene, are, or ſhalbée by Gods good meanes made faithful, are by Gods frée mercy ſaued: according to the ſaying of the Apoſtle to the Epheſians. Cha. 2. Gratia enim estis ſaluati per fidem: et hoc non ex vobis. Dei enim donum est: non ex operibus, vt nequis glorietur. Ipſius enim ſumus factura, creati in Christo Ieſu ad opera bona, quae preparauit Deus, vt in illis ambulemus. By Grace are you ſaued, through fayth, and that not of your ſelues, for it is Gods gyft: not of workes leaſt any man ſhoulde boaſte. For we are hys workmanſhyppe, created in Chriſt Ieſus vnto good workes, which God hath prepared, that we ſhoulde walke in them. And to the Rom. 9. Chapter. The Apoſtle ſayth thus. Non volentis ne
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      currentis: ſed miſerentis est dei. It ſtandeth neyther in mans willing, nor in mans running, but in the mercy of God. It ſéemeth to me a ſtrange thing, that any man (profeſſing the Religion of Chriſt) dare conclude (as you doo) ſo directly contrary to the expreſſe wordes of the Apoſtle Paule. You ſay in your concluſion, we are iuſtified or ſaued, by fayth & good works together. S. Paule ſayth. Wée ſuppoſe that man is iuſtified by fayth without the déedes of the Lawe. Nowe, if you can teil vs of any déedes, yt are of more force to make vs righteous before God, then the déedes that God hath commaunded in his Law: then haue you ſayd ſomewhat, although but a little. For thoſe déedes muſt bée déedes commaunded of men, whereof the Prophet Eſay writeth thus. Chap. 29. Theyr feare towards me was taught by the precepts of men: therefore, beholde, I wyll take in hand to worke a ſtrange worke, that ſhall be a miracle, and an aſtoniſhment to this people: For wyſemen ſhall looſe their wiſedome, and vnderſtanding ſhalbe hydde from the prudent. I would wyſh you to weighe well theſe wordes of the Prophet Eſay, and to conſider whether they be not already verified in you, and in men of your ſorte. Conſider alſo what our ſauiour Chriſt addeth to theſe wordes. Mat. 15. In vayne doo they worſhip me, teaching the doctrines and commaundements of men. Whereby we are admoniſhed, that it is

but loſt labour, for a man to goe about to be made righteous before God, by ſuch workes, as men doo or can deuiſe and commaund. S. Paule to the Ephe. 2. ſayth: That through fayth wee are ſaued by frée mercie, and that not of our ſelues. For it is the gyft of GOD, and commeth not of workes, leaſt any man might haue any occaſion to boaſt: and how dare any man conclude (as you doo) that faith and works coupled together, may make vs righteous before God. I doo therfore conclude, according to ye true meaning of the wordes of our ſauiour Chriſt, the Prophet Eſay, and the Apoſtle Paul, that neither the workes that God hath commaunded, nor the workes that men haue deuiſed, or can deuiſe and commaund, yea or ye faith that God hath, dooth or ſhall worke in the harts of men, either bée, or can be, the efficient cauſe of mans righteouſnes or ſaluation. But the frée mercy of God onely, is the alone efficient cauſe, that hath wrought, doth and ſhall worke, ſaluation in the faithful onelie▪ and in none other. In whom he himſelfe worketh faith, that by that fayth they may laie hold vpon, & holde faſt that ſaluation, that in frée mercy, he doth, and will fréely beſtowe vpon them▪ And ſurder I conclude, that though the workes that GOD hath prepared for the faithfull to walke in, neither be, nor can be, the efficient cauſe of ſaluation, yet they are Cauſa ſine qua non: that is, a cauſe that muſt be founde in them, to whom it ſhalbe ſayde. Come yee bleſſed of my Father &c. ſo that they that ſhall heare that ioyfull ſentence, muſt hunger and thirſt after righteouſnes of life, all the dayes of their life. And vſe that faith that GOD hath wrought in them, in laying holde vpon, and holding faſt, that righteouſnes that God hath in frée mercy beſtowed fréely vpon them, hauing a continuall care to ſhewe themſelues thankfull to him for the ſame, by walking in thoſe good workes that hee hath prepared for them to walke in.
               Nowe for the meaning of thoſe places that you direct vs vnto, namely, the 2. to the Romans, the 16. of S. Mathew, and many other, wherin we may by ſearch find, how God will reward al men according to their works: I ſay thus. I could by ye knowledg that God hath giuen me, anſwere you ſufficiently. Yet becauſe my wordes be of ſmall credite with you, I wyll aunſwere you by the wordes of a holy father of the Catholicke Church, whoſe wordes (I hope) you will admit, and giue credite to them (although▪ as I

coniecture, you be not much acquainted with them) S. Auguſtine writeth thus. Quod est ergo meritum hominis ante gratiam, quo merito accipiat gratiam: cum omne meritum nostrū, non in nobis faciat niſi gratia. Et cum Deus coronat merita noſtra, nihil aliud coronet, quam munera ſua? What is the merite of man before, whereby he may receiue grace: ſéeing that nothing but grace dooth worke in vs all our merite? And when God doth crowne our merits, he crowneth none other thing but his owne gifts? Thus writeth S. Augustine Tom. 2. Epiſtola. 105. And againe in his 7. Tom. in the 7. Chap▪ter of his booke De gratia & libero arbitrio, he wryteth thus. Si ergo Dei dona ſunt bona merita tua: non Deus coronat merita tua, tanquā merita tua, ſed tanquam dona ſua. That is, If therefore thy good merites be the gyfts of God, then dooth not God crowne thy merites as thy merites, but as his owne gifts. And agayne in hys eyght Tome. vpon the Pſalme, 98. Exaltate dominum Deum noſtrū. Verè exaltate, Benè exaltate. Laudemus & exaltemus, qui fecit ipſam iustitiam quam habemus, ipſe in nobis fecit. Quis enim in nobis fecit ipſam iustitiam: niſi qui nos iustificauit? De Christo autem dictum est: qui iuſtificat impium. Nos ergo impij, ille iuſtificator: quando et ipſam iuſtitiam ipſe in nobis fecit, qua illi placeamus, vt ad dextram nos ponat, et non ad ſinistram, vt dicat ad dextram poſitis, venite benedicti patris mei, percipite regnum quod vobis paratum eſt, ab initio mundi, non autem ponat ad ſinistram inter eos quibus dicturus eſt. Ite in ignem aeternum, qui paratus est diabolo & angelis eius. Qui in nobis coronaturus est, non merita nostra, ſed dona ſua: quantum debet exaltari? That is to ſay: Gyue great prayſe to the Lord our GOD. Gyue him great praiſes indéede. Praiſe him aright. Let vs lawde and prayſe him, which hath made that righteouſnes that we haue. He hath wrought it in vs. For who hath wrought in vs that righteouſnes, but he that hath iuſtified vs? And it is ſayde of Chriſt, that he iuſtifieth the vngodly▪ We therefore are the vngodly, and he is the iuſtifier: ſéeing that he hath wrought in vs that righteouſnes, whereby we might pleaſe him, ſo that he might place vs at his right hand and not at his left hand, that he might ſay vnto vs being placed at his right hand: Come ye bleſſed of my father, receiue the Kingdome that was prepared for you, from the beginning of the worlde.
               
                  Not that he might ſette vs at his left hand, amongſt thē to whom he ſhall ſay: Goe into fire euerlaſting, which was prepared for the deuill and hys angels. Howe greatly ought he to be prayſed, that ſhall crowne in vs, not our merites, but his owne gyfts? Againe, the ſame Auſten, writeth thus in the ſame Tome, vpon ye Pſalme 102. Qui in nobis victi ſumus, in illo vicimus. Ergo coronatte, quia dona ſua coronat, non merita tua. We that in our ſelues are ouercome, haue in him gotten the victory. He crowneth thée therfore, becauſe he crowneth not thy merites, but his owne gifts. But to put you out of all doubt, concerning ye meaning of al thoſe places yt you ſend vs to, ſée what ſaint Auſten writeth in his forenamed Epiſtle. 105. Stipendium, inquit peccati, mors. Rectè stipendium, quia debetur, quia digne retribuitur, quia merito redditur. Deindè, ne iustitia de human
                        •
                      ſe extolleret bono merito, ſicut humanum meritum malum non dubitatur eſse peccatum, non a contrario retulit dicens: stipendium iustitiae vita aeterna, ſed gratià, inquit, Dei vita aeterna. Et haec ne praeter mediatorem aliqua alia via quaereretur, adiecit, in Christo Ieſu Domino nostro. Tanquam diceret, Audito quòd stipendium peccati ſit mors, quid te disponis extollere? O humana, non iustitia, ſed nomine iustitiae planè ſuperbia, quid te disponis extollere, & contrariam morti vitam aeternam tanquam debitum stipendium flagitare? Cui debetur vita aeterna, vera iuſtitia eſt. Si autem vera iuſtitia est, ex te non est. De ſurſum est, deſcendens a Patre luminum, et haberes eam (ſi tamen habes eam) profectò accepiſti. Quid enim habes quod non accepisti? Quapropter, O homo, ſi accepturus es vitam aeternam: iustitiae quidem stipendum est: ſed tibi gratia eſt, cui gratia est & ipſa iustitia. Tibi enim tanquam debita redderetur: ſi ex te tibi eſſet iustitia, cui debetur. That is to ſay: Death (ſayth he) is the hyre that is due for ſinne▪ It is rightly called a ſtipend or wages, becauſe it is due, becauſe it is worthily payde, becauſe it is payd as a thinge deſerued. Moreouer, that righteouſnes might not extoll it ſelfe for the good deſeruing of man: he hath not ſhewed, that as no man doubteth ſinne to be the euill deſert of man, ſo on the contrary he ſayth not, that life euerlaſting is the hyre or wages of righteouſnes, but he ſaith, life euerlaſting is ye frée mercy of God. And (leaſt ſome other way beſide ye Mediator ſhould be ſought for) he addeth theſe wordes. In Chriſt Ieſus our Lorde. As though he ſhould ſay, why dooſt thou prepare to extoll thy ſelfe, when thou heareſt that death is the reward

or wages due to ſinne? Oh thou humane (not iuſtice or righteouſnes, but in very déede, pryde, vnder the name of Iuſtice) why dooſt thou prepare to extoll thy ſelfe, and to require or clayme, as a ſtypende due vnto thée, that euerlaſting life, which is contrary to death? That righteouſnes whervnto life euerlaſting is due, is that which is the true and right iuſtice. And if it bee the right iuſtice, then it commeth not of thée It is from aboue, and commeth down from the Father of lights, that thou mighteſt haue it. And yet if thou haſt it, vndoubtedly thou haſt receiued it. For what haſt thou that yu haſt not receiued? Wherefore (O yu man) if thou ſhalt receiue eternall life, it is in déede the wages or hyre of Iuſtice, but vnto thée it is frée mercy, vnto whom, euen iuſtice, or righteouſnes it ſelfe, is frée mercy. And if thou haddeſt of thy ſelfe, righteouſnes, wherevnto it is due, then ſhoulde it be giuen to thée, euen as béeing due vnto thée.
               If I were not perſwaded that theſe words of ſaint Auſten are ſufficiēt to perſwade any reaſonable mā, that life euerlaſting, neither is nor can be deſerued (eyther in whole or in parte) by anye workes that haue béene, or can be wrought by man: I coulde (and would cite many moe ſayings of thys holy Father, as effectuall as theſe, and tending as fully to this purpoſe, and ſome like ſentences out of the wrytings of other holy fathers alſo. But I am aſſured, that although it be a thing impoſſible to perſwade ſome of your ſorte, yet theſe, and ſuch ſentences of this holy father, ſhall ſtoppe the mouthes of you all, when you ſhall come in preſence of ſuch as doo know them, and be able to vrge them, againſt that filthy doctrine of humayne merites, that is ſo ſtoutly maintained by you.
               But nowe to conclude thys matter, let me mooue one queſtion to you, which you may aunſwere at your leaſure. If all were true that you haue written, touching the cauſe of that ioyfull ſentence that our Sauiour ſhall giue in the laſt day. Come yee bleſſed &c. For when I was hungry you fedde mee, when I was a thirſt you gaue me to drinke, when I was naked you clothed me. &c. I pray you what ſhall be ſayde then to you that are Minime Fryers, and all others that are altogether vnable eyther to féede or clothe others, or themſelues? ſhall not the contrarye ſentence (trowe you) be gyuen agaynſt ſuch? Goe ye curſed into euerlaſting fire, prepared for the deuill and his angels. For I was hungry▪
                  
and you fedde me not. I was thirſty, and you gaue mee no drinke. I was naked and you clothed mee not. &c. Beléeue me (Fryer John) if thoſe wordes that you cite out of the 25. of ſaynt Mathewe, ſhould meane, as by your writing you ſéeme to vnderſtand thē: the caſe of you, & of al ſuch, as doo either by vow or otherwiſe, make thēſelues vnable to doo thoſe good workes yt you ſpeake of, ſhalbe very hard. Your voluntary vowe wil not then excuſe you. In the 7. Chap. of S. Mathew, our ſauiour Chriſt ſayth. Diſcedite a me omnes qui operamini iniquitatem. Depart from me all ye yt worke iniquity: and doo not you worke iniquity. When you (hauing receiued from God good gifts, by the vſe whereof you might be able to féede and clothe your ſelfe, and to helpe to féede and cloth others) haue bounde your ſelfe by a vowe, to leade ſuch a kynde of life, that of neceſſity, you muſt either be fedde and clad by others, or els periſh by the lacke of thinges neceſſary? Doo not you worke iniquity, when you doo not onely robbe your naturall Parents, your Prince and Countrey, of that helpe that both by the Lawe of nature, and by the Lawes of God and of your Country, all theſe ought to haue at your hands: but alſo of that reléefe, helpe and ſeruice, which all theſe might and ought to haue out of the labours of others, but are (by your hypocriticall meanes) drawne from them that you may be thereby maintained in idlenes? I knowe, that ſuch as haue not ſuch gifts▪ or be by any meanes naturall, or caſuall (as we may terme it) made vnable, both to helpe other & themſelues, muſt be ſuſtayned by the labour of others: and ſhall not be reiected, as they that doo not féede and clothe Chriſt in his members, but yet ſo that they haue mercifull hartes, and doo pitty the caſe of the néedy, when they ſhall ſée them in miſery. But this is not your caſe. Take héede to your ſelfe in time (Fryer John) for I feare there is no place in heauen for purgatory Fryers.
               And thus much for that great double Cannon, that you haue brought out of the 25. of ſaynt Mathewes Goſpell, with the reſte that you haue tolde vs of, and we haue viewed and ſéene. The recoyle of them hath hurte you much more then the ſhott hath anoyeo vs. Nowe let vs ſée, what great Ordinaunce you haue bent agaynſt that Bulworke of ours, wherein we ſtande and denie the reall preſence of Chriſt, in the bleſſed Sacrament of the Altare. Thus you ſay.

                  y, concerning the reall preſence, in the bleſſed Sacrament of the Altare: Looke I pray you in the xxvi. of S. Mathewe, where theſe wordes are written. Caenantibus autem eis, accepit Ieſus panem et benedixit, ac fregit, deditque diſcipulis ſuis, & ai
                        •
                     . Accipite▪ & commedite. Hoc est corpus meum &c. That is to ſay, why leſt the reſt were at Supper: Ieſus tooke breade, bleſſed it, and brake it, and gaue it to his Diſciples and ſaide. Take and eate, this is my body. The ſame altogether we reade in the 14. Chapter of the Goſpell of S. Marke, ſauing onely that he ſayth: Sumite hoc est corpus meum, where as the foreſayd Euangeliſt ſayth Accipite & commedite. Agayne, in the 22. Chapter of S. Luke, we reade the ſame, in wordes as it ſ
                     •
                  emeth more plaine, then the before written words are. For hee ſayth, Accepto pane, gratias egit, et fregit, 
                        •
                     t dedit illis diceus. Hoc est corpus meum, quod pro vobis datur: Similiter & calicem postquam caenauit dicens. Hic est calix nouum Testamentum in ſanguine meo, qui pro uobis fundetur. The Engliſh of theſe Latine wordes is thys. Ieſus Chriſt hauing taken bread, gaue thankes and brake it, & gaue it to his diſciples ſaying. This is my body. In like manner alſo, the chalice, after that he had ſ
                     •
                  pped, ſaying: This chalice is the newe Teſtament in my blood, which ſhalbe ſhedde for you. Or as Saint Marke in his Goſpell ſayth: Accepto calice. &c. That is to ſay, Hauing taken the chalice, he gaue it to his diſciples ſaying. Thys is my bloud of the Newe teſtament, which ſhalbe ſhed for many. Thus you ſee, howe that all the three Euangeliſts agree in thys poynt: howe that our bleſſed Sauiour, gaue to his diſciples in hys laſt ſupper, his moſt precious body and bloude. I haue not ſhewed this vnto you by the ſavings of holie doctors, but by the wordes of our Sauiour himſelfe, vnto the intent that you may beleue me. We reade in the 6. Chapter of the Goſpell after S. Iohn, how that our Sauiour endeuouring to bring the hard harted Iewes vnto the knowledge of his diuinitie, ſpake theſe wordes. I am the bread of life, which came downe from heauen. If any body eate of this breade, he ſhall liue for euer: and the bread which I wil giue, is my fleſh for the life of this worlde. Againe in the ſame Chapter. If you eate not the fleſh of the ſonne of man, and drinke hys bloude, ye ſhall not haue life in you. Verely, verely, I ſay vnto you, he that eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my bloud, ſhall haue

lyfe euerlaſting: and I wyll rayſe him vp from death in the latter day. You ſay the contrary nowe, you make God a lyer, you ſay that he gaue them not his body, but onely breade, which is fully contrary to the foreſayd texts of Scripture.

               Theſe foure double Cannons, that this valiant Captayne (Frier John) hath planted againſt ye Forte of our faith, are of excéeding great force, but he hath ſo ouercharged them, that when he ſhall put fire to them, they muſt of neceſſitie recoyle with ſuch force, that the Captaine with all his company, are like to bée in verie great daunger. For off, they will not goe againſt our Forte: and breake they can not. Yea, we are in good hope, that we ſhall haue ſuch ayde at the hands of S. Auſten and his companie, that this great Ordinaunce ſhalbe turned againſt the whole Armie of the Romiſh Catholickes, and ſhotte of ſo freſhlye, that they ſhall hardlie eſcape the loſſe of the Romane honour for euer. And firſt let vs ſée what may be doone with the firſt of theſe Cannons, called Caenātibus autem eis. &c. Whylſt that the reſt were at ſupper. &c. S. Auſten in that booke that he wrote agaynſt Adimantus, and in the 12. Chapter of that booke, wryteth thus. Non enim dominus dubitauit dicere,

                     i. The Lord (ſayth S. Austen) did not doubt to ſay, this is my bodie: when he gaue the ſigne of his body. If there were no more but this one place of S. Auſten: it might ſuffice for the turning about of theſe foure péeces of Ordinaunce, and the making of them ready to be ſhot off againſt Frier John and his fellowes. For the force of them all conſiſteth in this one aſſertion. When our Sauiour Chriſt tooke breade, and gaue thankes (or bleſſed) and brake it, and gaue it to his Diſciples, ſaying: Take, eate, this is my bodie. He did deliuer vnto thoſe Diſciples his owne body. And when he did after ſupper take the Cuppe (or Chalice) ſaying, thys Chalice is the Newe teſtament in my bloud. &c. He did deliuer hys owne blo
                     •
                  d. Which thing S Auſten denieth, when he ſaith. The Lorde doubted not to ſaie, this is my bodie, when he deliuered the ſigne of his body. For the ſigne, and the thing ſignified are Diſparata, thinges ſeperated the one from the other. The thing therefore that is the ſigne of another thing, can not (by anie meanes) be that thing whereof it is a ſigne. As the Ju
                     •
                  e or other matter, that is hanged out to be a ſigne of Wyne to be ſolde, can in no caſe be

ſaide to be that Wine that is to be ſolde, but a ſigne thereof onely. Yea though wine indéede, were ſetforth to be a ſigne of wyne to be ſolde: or breade indéede were ſet forth to be a ſigne of bread to bee ſolde: yet that wine and that breade could not rightly be ſayd, to be the ſame wyne or bread, that is to be ſolde, whereof that wyne or breade ſo ſet forth is but a ſigne. And yet, neither S. Auſten nor we, doo denie, but that the name of the thing ſignified by a Sacrament, may be giuen to the Sacrament, becauſe Sacraments haue a certaine ſimilitude of thoſe thinges whereof they be ſacraments. S. Auſten writing to Bonifacius▪ Epiſtola. 23. ſaith thus. Si enim Sacramenta, quandam ſimilitudinem earum rerum quarum ſacramenta ſunt, non haberent: omnino ſacramenta non eſſent. Ex hac autem ſimilitudine▪ plerumque etiam ipſarum rerum nomina accipiunt. Sicut ergo ſecundū quendā modū, ſacramentū corporis Christi, corpus Chriſti eſt, et ſacramētū ſanguinis Christi, ſanguis Chriſt
                        •

                        •
                     ita ſacramentū fidei fides eſt &c. If ſacraments had not a certaine ſimilitude of thoſe thinges whereof they be Sacraments: they were indéede no Sacraments. And of the ſame ſimilitude, they doo, for the moſt parte take alſo the names of thoſe thinges, whereof they be ſacraments. Therefore, as after a certaine manner, the ſacrament of the body of Chriſt is the body of Chriſt, and the Sacrament of the bloude of Chriſt, is the bloud of Chriſt: euen ſo, the ſacrament of fayth is fayth &c. Thus you may ſée, and as I thinke, you doo ſée, that theſe words, This is my body, doo not proue any other preſence of Chriſt in the Sacrament, then that which may be called ſacramentall, myſticall, heauenly, and ſpirituall. And to make this matter more plaine vnto you: I wyll let you ſée certaine places of Scripture, where the like ſpéeche is vſed, and in the like meaning. Ezechiell the Prophet, is commaunded to ſhaue of the hayre of his heade and beard, to deuide it into thrée equall partes &c. As it is written in the fi

                  ▪ &c. By the circumſtaunce of this text, it is manifeſt, that the meaning of that ſentence (This is Jeruſalem) was not, that the dooing of thoſe thinges that there were doone, was the Ci

                  ereticke Proteſtants, that in denying the Reall preſence in the bleſſed ſacrament of the Altare, they make God a lyer. We denie not, but doo confeſſe, that the breade

and the wyne in the Sacrament of the body and bloude of Chriſte, are the body and bloud of Chriſt, euen as the Paſcall Lambe was the paſſing by of the Lorde, as the Rocke in the Wyldernes was Chriſt, (Petraerat Christus▪
                   The Rocke was Chriſt, ſaith Saint Paule. 1. Cor. 10) and as the ſeauen ſtarres (ſpoken of in the firſte of the Reuelations of S. Iohn) are the ſeauen Angels of the ſeauen Congregations. And as ye ſeauen golden candleſticks are ye ſeauen Congregations. Yea we ſay with ſaynt Paul. 1. Cor. 10. Calix benedixionis cui benedicimus: nonne communicatio ſanguinis Christi est? Panis quem frangimus: nonne participatiò corporis Domini eſt? The Cuppe (or as you call it, the Chalice) that we bleſſe: is it not the Communion of the blood of Chriſt? The bread that we breake is it not the partaking of the bodye of the Lord? Quoniam vnus panis, & vnum corpus multi ſumus. Omnes quidem de vno pane, & de vno calice participamus. For we being many, are but one loafe of breade, and one body. And we doo all take part of one loafe of bread and of one cuppe. If you therefore would deny, that the Sacramentall cuppe is the Communion of the blood of Chriſt, or that the ſacramentall breade is the partaking of the bodie of the Lorde: we would ſay that you doo lie, and doo make the Apoſtle Paule a lyar, and ſo conſequently▪ God himſelfe, for the ſpéeche that Paule vſeth, is not his, but Gods that ſpake in him. We doo beléeue, that the body and bloud of Chriſt, are giuen, taken, eaten, and drunken of the faithfull in the Lords ſupper, after a heauenlie and ſpiritual manner: but yet verily and indéede. Yea, and that faith is ye meane whereby the bodie and bloud of Chriſt are receiued in the Supper. All this we beléeue and confeſſe: and your ſelfe (Frier John) had once learned this, and did confeſſe it in my Church without Creplegate of London, before many witneſſes. You doo vs open wrong therefore, in that you ſay that we make God a lyer, and ſay that he gaue not his body to his diſciples, but bread onely, which is fully contrarie to the foreſaid texts of Scripture. And as touching the ſentences that you cite out of the ſixt Chapter of S. Iohn, we acknowledge Chriſt to be that bread that came downe from heauen. And that whoſoeuer ſhall eate of that bread ſhall liue for euer. And he that eate

                   That is to ſay. Your Fathers did eate Manna and are deade: not becauſe Manna was an euill thing, but becauſe they did not eate it aright. This is the bread that came downe from heauen. Manna did ſignifie this breade. The Lordes Altare did ſignifie thys breade. Thoſe thinges were Sacraments: in ſignes they be dyuers,

but in the thing that is ſignified they are alike. Gyue care to the Apoſtle. For he ſayth, Brethren, I would not haue you ignorant, that all our Fathers were vnder the Clowde, and that they did all paſſe thorow the Sea, and that they were all baptized by Moſes, in the clowde, and in the Sea, and that they did all eate one and the ſame ſpirituall meate. The ſame ſpirituall meate indéede, for the corporall was another, for they did eate Manna, and we an other thing: but the ſpirituall was the ſame that we doo eate. But theſe were our Fathers, not theirs. They to whom we are like, not they to whom they were like. And hée addeth to this. And they did all drinke of one ſpirituall drinke, but in the viſible kind, they did drinke one thing and we another, and yet ſignifying the ſelf
                     •
                   ſame thing in ſpirituall vertue. But howe was it the ſame drink? They dranke (ſayth he) of ye ſpirituall Rocke that followed them, and that Rocke was Chriſt. Hence was the bread, and hence was the drinke. In a ſigne, the Rocke is Chriſt, but Chriſt indéede, is in the word and in the fleſh.
               Can any man wryte or ſpeake more plainly on our ſide in this matter, then S. Auſten hath doone in theſe wordes that I haue héere 
                     •
                  ited? Doth he not plainly affirme, that the Manna was to the faithfull Fathers in the wilder

                  es, euen the ſelfe ſame thyng that the ſacramentall breade in the Lordes ſupper is to vs nowe? And that the Rocke in the Wildernes, was vnto them, the ſame thing that the cuppe in the Lords ſupper is vnto vs nowe? And what? wyll you haue vs to grant you a reall preſence of Chriſtes bodie and bloode in the Manna and in the Rocke? And howe can you then require vs to grant it, in the ſacramentall bread & wine? S. Auſten ſayth, that they and we differ not in the thing ſignified, although we differ in the ſignes. Theyr ſignes were Manna and the Rocke, or water that iſhewed out of the Rocke, and our ſignes are the Breade and the Cuppe, or the wyne vſed in the Lords ſupper. But the ſpirituall meate and drinke, that both they and wee doo eate and drinke, is the very body and bloud of Chriſt, that innocent Lambe that hath béene ſlaine for the ſinnes of the world, euen from the beginning of the world. And to giue vs occaſion to conſider, that not euery one that receiueth the Sacrament, dooth alſo receiue the body and bloud of Chriſt. S. Auſten ſayth thus. O

He that eateth my fleſh and drinketh my bloode, dwelleth in me and I in him. To eate that meate (therefore) and to drinke that drinke, is this. For a man to dwell in Chriſt, and to haue Chriſt dwelling in him. And héereby it appeareth, that who ſo dwelleth not in Chriſt, neither hath Chriſte dwelling in him, the ſame (no doubt) doth neither 
                     •
                  ate his fleſhe (ſpiritually) nor drinke his bloude, although he doo, fleſhly and viſibly, preſſe with his téeth, the Sacrament of the body and bloude of Chriſt: but rather he dooth eate and drinke the Sacrament of ſo excellent a thing, to be a condemnation vnto him ſelf.
               Thus you may ſée (Maſter Fryer John) how raſhly you haue written, in that you haue ſayd thus. If any bodye eate of this breade (meaning I am ſure of that Sacrament that is kept ouer your high altar) he ſhall liue for euer. And the bread that I wyll giue is my fleſhe, for the life of this worlde. You ſay, If any body eate of this breade &c. S. Auſten ſayth. No body but ſuch as dwell in Chriſt, and haue Chriſt dwelling in them, eyther doo or can eate the fleſh of Chriſt, but doo by the receiuing of the Sacrament of ſo excellent a thing, eate and drinke to their owne condemnation. Nowe, I leaue you, to try this matter with S. Auſten. If you can entreate him to recant: ſo it is. If not, your beſt way is, to recant your ſelfe. And yet one other ſentence of S. Auſten in the ſame treatice vpon Iohn. Nonne buccella dominica, venenum fuit Iudae? & tamen accepit, & cum accepit, inimicus in eum intrauit: non quia malum accepit, ſed quia bonum, male malus accepit
                     ▪
                   Was not the Lords ſoppe, a poyſonne to Iudas? and yet he receiued it, and when hee receiued it, the enimie entred into him: not becauſe he receiued

an euill thing, but becauſe he being euill, did receiue a good thing, after an euill ſorte. Much more might be ſaide to this effect: but I leaue you as I ſayd before.
               As touching the other ſentence that you cite out of this ſixt of S. Iohn, which is thus. If you doo not eate the fl

It is therefore a figure, commaunding that we ſhould be partakers of the Lordes paſſion or ſuffering, and that we ſhould ſwéetely, and profitably, laie vp in memory, that his fleſh was crucified & wounded for vs. Immediatly before theſe wordes, S. Auguſtine hath written thus, Si praeceptiua locutio eſt, aut flagitium aut facinus vetans, 
                        •

                        •
                     : aut vtilitatem aut beneficentiam vetare figurata eſt. If the ſpéeche be a commaundement, that forbiddeth an heynous or horrible fact, or that commaundeth profitablenes or beneficence, then the ſpéeche is not figuratiue. But if it be a ſpéeche that ſéemeth to commaunde an heynous or horrible fact: or to forbidde profitablenes or beneficence, then it is a figuratiue ſpéeche.
               By this Rule, all theſe places that you haue alledged out of the 26. of ſ. Mathew. The 14. of ſ. Mark The 22. of ſ. Luke, & the 6. of S. Iohn, are ſiguratiue ſpéeches For vnderſtanding them after the Letter, as you doo: they ſéeme to commaund an heynous and horrible fact▪ that is. To eate the fleſhe, and to drinke the bloude of a man. But taking them for figuratiue ſpéeches (as we doo, and as they are indéede) they doo commaunde a very profitable thing, that is, (as S. Auſten hath ſaide) to be partakers of the paſſ

                  s, and out of the wrytings of ſome others, more auncient, and ſome not ſo auncient. Firſt, S. Auſten wryting vpon the 98. Pſalme, ſayth thus: Spiritualiter intelligite quod locutus ſum. Non hoc corpus quod videtis manducaturi estis, et bibituri illum ſanguinem, quem fuſuri ſunt qui me crucifigent. Sacramentum aliquod vobis commendaui: ſpiritualiter intellectum viuificabit vos. Underſtande ſpiritually, that which I haue ſpoken. You ſhall not eate that bodie which you doo ſée: neither ſhal ye drink that bloud, which ſhall be ſhedde by them that ſhall crucifie me. I haue commended vnto you a certaine Sacrament, which being ſpirituallye vnderſtanded, will quicken you.
               
                  Baſilus Magnus (ſomewhat more auncient then Auſten) dooth ſhewe himſelfe to be of this minde. That whatſoeuer may be reallie preſent, in moe places at once then one, is no creature, but is God in nature. To prooue the holy Ghoſt to be God, he wryteth thus: De ſpiritu ſancto. Cap. 22.

The Angell that ſtoode before Cornelius, was not at the ſame time with Phillip alſo. Neither did he, that from the Altare ſpake vnto Zacharie, at the ſame time occupie his owne place and order in heauen. But we beléeue, that the holy Ghoſt did at one time, worke in Abacuc and in Daniell, béeing in Babilon. And it is ſayde that he was with Ieremie in the dungion, and with Ezechiell in Chobar. Baſill thought this ſufficient to prooue the holy Ghoſt to be God. And ſhall not we thinke then, that you affyrming, the body of Chriſt to be really preſent in the ſacrament, doo affyrme it to be God, becauſe it is preſent in ſo many places at once, and ſo deny i
                     •
                   to be a creature? But ſée what another Father (more auncient then Baſill) dooth ſaye to thys matter.
               
                  Origen wryting vpon the 25. Chapter of S. Mathewe, ſayth thus: Secundum hanc diuinitatis ſuae naturam, non peregrinatur, ſed peregrinatur ſecundum dispenſationem corporis quod ſuſcepit. As touching this his diuine nature, he is not gone into a ſtrange Countrey, but concerning the diſpoſition of that bodie which he hath taken vpon him, he is gone into a ſtrange Countrey.
               S. Auſten, wryting to Dardanus. Epiſtola. 57. ſayth thus. Cauendum est enim, ne ita diuinitatem aſtruamus hominis, vt veritatem corporis auferamus. For we muſt take héede that we doo not ſo ſet vp the diuinitie of the manhoode, that we take away the truth of the bodie. Theſe wordes of ſaint Auſten are plaine enough, and yet to make them more plaine, he addeth.

               In his 30. treatice vpon ſaynt Iohns Goſpell, S. Auguſtine wryteth thus, Corpus domini in quo reſurrexit, in vno loco eſſe oportet: veritas eius vbi

                      diffuſa est. The Lordes bodye wherein he aroſe, muſt be in one place: but hys trueth is ſpread abroad in euery place.
               S. Ambros alſo▪ wryting vppon ſaynt Lukes Goſpell, hath theſe wordes, Lib. 10. capit▪ 24. Quae ſurſum ſunt ſapite, non quae ſuper
                  
                  terram. Ergo non ſupra terram, nec in terra, nec ſecundum carnem te quaerere debemus, ſi volumus inuenire. Sauoure thoſe thinges that are aboue, and not thoſe things that are on earth. If we therefore, wyil finde him, we muſt not ſéeke him vpon the earth, nor in the earth, nor after the manner of fleſh.
               
                  Cyrill alſo, who being in the dayes of ſaynt Ambros Biſhoppe of Alexandria, wryteth vpon the Goſpell of ſaynt Iohn, and ſayeth thus: Lib. 6. capit. 14. Et ſi Christus corporis ſui praeſentiam hinc ſub duxit, mai state tamen diuinitatis ſemper adest, ſicut ipſe, a diſcipulis abiturus policetur. Ecce ego vobiſcum ſum omnibus diebus, vſ
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      ad conſummationem ſoeculi. Although Chriſt haue conueighed hence the preſence of his body: yet is he alwayes preſent by the maieſtie of his diuinity, euen as when hee was departing from hys Diſciples he promiſed. Beholde I am with you euery day, euen to the ende of the worlde.
               S. Gregorie alſo, in his 21. Homelie, writeth thus. Chriſtus nō eſt hic, per praeſentiam carnis: qui tamen nuſquam deest, per praeſentiam maiestatis. Chriſt (ſayth he) is not héere, by the preſence of hys fleſh: which notwithſtanding, is abſent from no place, by the preſence of hys maieſtie.
               
                  Fulgentius alſo, in his ſeconde booke, Ad tranſimundum regem writeth thus. Chriſtus vnus, idem

                      ſecundum humanam ſubstantiam, abſens coelo, cum eſset in terra, & derelinquens terram cum aſcendiſſet in coelum. Chriſt is but one, and the ſame is placible, man of man, which is of hys Father GOD, that can not be meaſured. One and the ſame as touching his humane ſubſtaunce, was abſent from heauen when he was on earth, and leauing the earth when he aſcended into heauen. The laſt of theſe wryters hetherto cited, lyued within 500. yéeres after Chriſtes aſcention.
               Conſider, I pray you, the places that I haue héere ſet downe in wryting, taken out of the moſt auncient, learned, and godly writinges that theſe Fathers haue left behinde them. And be no longer ledde by ſuch as firſt ſeduced you, and doo ſtil beare you in hand that all the auncient Fathers did beléeue and teach ſuch a reall preſence of Chriſt Ieſus to be in the Sacrament of the Altare, as they haue taught you to beléeue: and that al we that doo deny that there is any ſuch reall preſence of Chriſt in that Sacrament, doo make

God a lyar, and doo holde an hereſie, moſt horrible, deteſtable, and abhominable. Where as in very déede, we doo beléeue and teache, the true, auncient, Catholicke, and Apoſtolicke fayth, concerning the true vſe of the Sacrament of the body and bloude of our Sauiour Chriſt. And that which they doo holde and teache, is ſchiſmaticall, deuilliſh, and damnable. Come out from amongſt them, hearken no more to them, they are falſe Prophets, deſtruction hangeth ouer their heads, and hell gapeth for them. They robbe Chriſte of his glory. They rob Chriſtians of their greateſt comfort. They ſuppreſſe and holde vnder true Religion. They ſette vp and maintaine Idolatry and ſuperſtition. And to ſpeake all in one worde: they vpholde Antichriſt and his whole kingdome.
               But to returne to our purpoſe. You ſay that we ſay, that there be but two Sacraments, an hereſie condemned long agoe. But you tell vs not when, where, nor by whom. Therefore as we haue ſayd, ſo we doo ſay, and ſo we wyll ſay (by Gods helpe) til you can prooue the contrary: that Chriſt hath ordeined but two ſacramēts to be vſed by Chriſtians. Your ſaying, that it is an hereſie condemned long agoe, is but a flaſhe of falſe fire giuen to a péece of Ordinaunce vncharged, and therefore can not hurt the Bulwork wherin we ſtande, and doo denie that Chriſt hath ordeined any moe ſacraments then two, namely: Baptiſme and the ſupper of ye Lord. In his thyrd booke of Chriſtian doctrine, and in the 9. Chap. there of, S. Auſten wryteth thus concerning this matter. Hoc verò tempore posteaquam reſurrectione domini nostri Ieſu Chriſti, manifeſtiſſimum iudicium nostrae libertatis illuxit, nec eorum quidem ſignorum quae iam intelligimus, operatione graui onerati ſumus: ſed quaedam pauca pro multis, cadem

                      cum percipit, quo referantur imbutus agnoſcit, vt ea non carnali ſeruitate, ſed ſpirituali potius libertate veneretur. Vt enim litteram ſequi, et ſigna pro rebus quae ijs ſignificantur accipere, ſeruilis infirmitatis est: ita inutiliter ſigna interpretari, male vagantie erroris est. But in theſe dayes, ſith by the reſurrection of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, a moſt manifeſt ſigne (or ſhewe) of our liberty hath appeared: wee are not loaden with the heauye working of thoſe ſignes that we doo already vnderſtande. But in ſtéede of many, the

Lorde and the Apoſtolicke diſcipline hath giuen vnto vs, a certain ſmall number, and the ſame very eaſie to be doone, and moſt excellent in ſignification, and moſt pure in obſeruation: as is the Sacrament of Baptiſme, and the celebration of the body and bloud of the Lorde, which euery man that is inſtructed, doth when hee receiueth them, knowe to what ende they are referred, that he may reuerence them, not in a carnall ſeruitude, but rather in a ſpirituall liberty. For, euen as, to followe the Letter, and to take the ſignes, for thoſe thinges that be ſignified by them, is a poynt of ſeruile infirmity, euen ſo to enterpret ye ſignes vnprofitably, is a point of error that wandreth euill fauouredly, or wickedly.
               In theſe wordes of S. Auſten, we haue occaſion to note two thinges eſpecially. One is, that hee did not knowe of moe Sacraments then two, inſtituted by our Sauiour Chriſt, and commaunded by him and his Apoſtles to be vſed in his Church. The other is, that it is a poynt of fleſhly ſeruitude, and not of Chriſtian liberty, for a man to follow the letter, or litterall ſence, in thoſe ſpéeches in the Scriptures, that doo concerne thoſe two Sacraments, in ſuch ſorte that he wyll take the ſignes that are ſpoken of, for the thinges ſignified by them. A man may meruell, that any of your ſorte, that knoweth theſe words of S. Auſten: can allowe him for a Catholicke, and yet condemne vs, as Heretickes in thys poynt, wherein we doo both affyrme and denie, euen as he hath doone manye hundrethes of yéeres before vs.
               But let vs ſée yet, one other place of S. Auſten. In an Epiſtle that he wrote to one Ianuarius, which is in number 118. S. Auſten wryteth thus. Primò ita

Ʋnde ſacramentis numero pauciſſimis, obſeruatione facillimis, ſignificatione praestantiſſimis, ſocietatem noui populi colligauit: ſicuti est baptiſmus, trinitatis nomine conſecratus, communio corporis & ſanguinis ipſius, & ſi quid aliud in canonicis ſcripturis commendatur, exceptis ijs quae ſeruitutem populi veteris, pro congruentia cordis illorum, & prophetici temporis onerabāt, quae et in quin
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      libris Moſis leguntur. Fyrſt of all therefore, my wyll is, that you ſhoulde vnderſtande, what the chéefe poynt of thys diſputation is. That is, that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, hath (as himſelfe ſpeaketh in the Goſpell) made vs ſubiecte to his owne

eaſie yoke, and light burden. Whereby he hath ſyed together the ſociety of the newe people, with Sacraments that are feweſt in number, eaſieſt in obſeruing, and moſt excellent in ſignification, as is Baptiſme, conſecrated in the name of the Trinity, and ye communion of his body and bloud, and if there by any other ſacrament that is in the Canonicall Scriptures commended, except thoſe ſacraments, which did encreaſe the weight of bondage of the olde people, as was méete for theyr hartes, and for the propheticall time, and which are reade in the fiue Bookes of Moſes.
               
               In theſe wordes of S. Auſten, we haue occaſion to note, that his meaning was to certifie Ianuarius (to whom he wrote this Epiſtle) of that thing which our Lord Ieſus Chriſt taught, in that which ſtandeth written in the eleuenth of ſaynt Mathewes Goſpell: concerning the eaſines of the yoke, and the lightnes of the burden, that Chriſt Ieſus hath layde vpon Chriſtians. And for the explaning of hys meaning: he ſayth that our Sacraments are very fewe in number, very eaſie to be obſerued, and moſt excellent in ſignification. And hee nameth onely Baptiſme and the ſupper of the Lorde, which he calleth (as we commonly doo) the communion of the body and bloode of our Sauiour Chriſt. And furder, hee referreth him to the Canonicall ſcriptures, as aduiſing him to receiue no moe Sacraments, then he ſhall finde to be commended in them. And leaſt he might take occaſion by thoſe words, to thinke that Chriſtians ought to be circumciſed, and to obſerue the ſacrifices and ceremonies of Moſes Lawe: he excepteth all ſuch Sacraments, as were layde vpon the people of the olde Lawe, by any thing that is wrytten in any of the fiue bookes of Moſes. So that, by theſe wordes of thys learned Father ſaynt Auſten, it appeareth (as by the other afore rehearſed) that he was not perſwaded, that Chriſt Ieſus our Lord, hath layde vpon vs Chriſtians, that heauye burden of ſeauen Sacraments, which your holy father the Pope, layeth vpon you, and vpon all hys Antichriſtian flocke. Confirmation, Order, Repentance, or (as you call it) Penaunce, Matrimonie, and the Viſitation of the ſicke (which you call Extreme vnction) we vſe, as good, profitable, and neceſſary vſages in the Church of Chriſt, but not as Sacraments: becauſe it appeareth not in any Canonicall ſcripture, that Chriſt our ſauiour hath inſtituted them, and commaunded them to be vſed as ſacraments.

Neyther doo they agree with that definition or deſcription of a ſacrament, which is commonly allowed of amongſt the learned▪ and is thus. A Sacrament is an outwarde and viſible ſigne, repreſenting an inwarde, inuiſible ſpirituall grace, ordeyned by Chryſte himſelfe, to teſtify Gods good wyll and bountifulnes towards vs, through the ſame Chriſt our ſauiour, by which Gods promiſes, touching forgiuenes of ſinnes, & eternall ſaluation, giuen through Chriſt, are (as it were) ſealed, and the trueth of them, is more certainly confirmed in our hartes. To thys definition or deſcription onely Baptiſme, and the Lords ſupper doo agrée: therefore they onely, are properly to be called ſacraments. Otherwyſe, a ſigne of a holy thing may be called a ſacrament. But in that large ſignification of the worde ſacrament, there be not onely ſeauen ſacraments, but ſeauenty times ſeauen ſacraments. And in that meaning we deny not, but that there may be in euery one of theſe other fiue, which you call ſacraments, moe ſacraments then one or two. But I can not meruell enough at this one thinge, that men of your ſorte, can eſtéeme ſo highly of Matrimonie, as to make it a ſacrament of ſuch excellencie, and yet bynde all your holieſt Catholickes by a ſolemne vowe, neuer to vſe it, or to take any benefite by it. Yea, I meruell that you can account matrimony ſo holy a thing as a ſacrament, and yet maryed perſons ſo vnholy, that if any of them ſhall come into any of your moſt holy Cloyſters, the walles and floores thereof muſt be waſhed, as thinges polluted, by the preſence of thoſe marryed perſons. Howeſoeuer therefore, by whom ſoeuer, or whereſoeuer, that which wee holde concerning two ſacraments onely, hath béene condemned for hereſie: we doo ſtyll holde it, and minde ſtyll to holde it for right Religion, tyll Fryer Iohn, and hys fraternitie, can and ſhall by the Cannonicall ſcriptures prooue it hereſye, and ſaynt Auguſtine an Hereticke.
               Nowe you enter into your exhortatorie Oration, which you make to your Father and Mother eſpecially: But it may bee thought that your meaning is, that thys exhortation ſhoulde bee made generall. For your Father and Mother, muſt haue help in the reading and waying of thoſe matters that are cōterned in thys exhortation. I wyll therefore doo you thys pleaſure (if I can) for olde acquaintance. You ſhall haue this excellent Oration of yours publiſhed in print, with all the reſt that you haue (in theſe your

Letters) written to your father and mother, that all your fréendes on thys ſide the Seas (if any ſuch be) & all your vndoubted fréends of the Engliſh Nation, as well in Fraunce as in Italie, or els where in any part of the knowne worlde, may know the depth of that diuinitie that dropped out of your penne, when you wrote thoſe Letters in Nigeon. But I will be ſo bolde with you (mine olde Scholler) as to publiſh thys mine aunſwere together with theſe your Letters, with this admonition. Reade all: or reade nothing. Hoping that you and your complices, wyll doo as much vpon my admonition, as I haue doone vpon yours: which is thus. Reade it thorowe, or begin it not. Thys admonition you haue ſet downe in the margin of your Letters ſeauentéene times. Perſwading your ſelfe (by all likelihoode) that we dare not reade any thing written by a Papiſt: more then many of your ſorte dare reade any thing that is written by a Proteſtant. But you muſt vnderſtande, that we are not vnder ſuch vowes as you are. Wée are encouraged by the Apoſtle Paule, to trie all thinges, and commaunded by him to holde faſt that which is good. Omnia probate, quod bonum est tenete. Try all thinges: holdfaſt that which is good. 1. Theſ. 5. Yea, we are of that ſorte that our Sauiour Chriſt ſpake of Marci vltimo. In the laſt Chapter of ſaint Markes Goſpell. Si mortiferum quid biberint, non eis nocebit. If they ſhall drinke any deadly poyſon, it ſhall not hurt them. Wee haue receiued before hande, a Treacle, which is of ſuch vertue, that none of your popyſh poyſons can hurt vs. We doo therefore, (and by Gods helpe wee wyll) reade all your bookes, if we may haue them. Yea, we wyll ſo reade them, and anſwere them, that you ſhall haue cauſe to wiſh that you had neuer written them. Wee doo not vſe to condemne mens wrytinges before we haue reade them, wayed and conſidered them, and founde them ſuch as are méete to be condemned. If you had doone ſo, you woulde neuer haue condemned for hereticks, ſo many as in theſe your Letters you haue condemned by name: and yet it may be thought, that you neuer reade any one lyne, written by ſome of them. I hope you will doo as much for mee as I haue doone for you, that is, reade theſe my wrytings, way and conſider them, and confute them if you can, and let that which you ſhall doo, be made publique to the worlde. But to returne to our purpoſe, your Oration beginneth thus.

               Looke to your ſelues (I pray you) beleeue our holy mother, the Catholicke Church. Rowle your ſelues vp & down in her bleſſed lappe. Leaue your Sermons heretical: goe no more vnto them. Ryſe not ſo earlie in the morning as you were wont to doo, to damne your ſelfe body and ſoule. Goe no more (I ſay) to thoſe Sermons of Crowley, Barber, Fielde and the reſt. Burne your bookes of Sermons, with all other your bokes in which are hereſies. Be not aſhamed of the name of a Papiſt. Goe to cōfeſſion, confeſſe your ſinnes to a Prieſt. Leaue this worlde that is ſo diſceitfull and ſtick vnto God. &c.
            
            
               Crovvley.
               Héere is an heape of Patheticall ſpéeches, powred out (as it were) of a Veſſell full of feruent zeale towardes your poore parents and all others, that be in ſuch miſerable caſe, as you ſéeme to ſuppoſe that they are in. You wyſhe them to looke to them ſelues, as though you ſawe them in preſent perrill and danger of deſtruction. There be ſeauen thinges that you require them to doo, whereby they may eſcape that great daunger which hangeth ouer their heads.
               The firſt is, to beléeue your holie mother the Catholick Church, and to rowle themſelues vp and downe in her bleſſed lapp. If that Catholick Church (that beléeueth, confeſſeth, & profeſſeth, that fayth and Religion that Chriſt Ieſus taught in his owne perſon, & commaunded to be taught Catholicklie, throughout the whole world, by his Apoſtles and meſſengers) be that holie mother of yours that you ſpeake of: then will your Father and Mother, and all other that you wyſhe ſhoulde be moued by your ſpéeches, gladly doo that which you wiſhe them to doo. Yea they doo it alreadie, & haue doone it euer ſince God gaue them knowledge of that mother. And they doo ſtill begge of God, that they may continue rowling vppe and downe in her bleſſed lap, all the dayes that they ſhall continue in this tranſitory life. Yea, and they doo conſtantly beléeue all that ſhe hath taught, or dooth teache: and they doo dailie craue of God, that they may be made able to beléeue, and boldly confeſſe all that ſhe ſhall teache, ſo long as they ſhalbe liuing on this earth. If thys be your meaning, they doo moſt hartily thank you for your fréendly and chriſtian admonition. But it ſéemeth to me, that the holie mother that you ſpeake of, is another, whom men of your ſort call the Romiſh Catholicke Church. Your father and mother, (Iohn and Catherine Debnam) and as manie as be of one mind with them:

doo vtterlie refuſe that mother, becauſe ſhe vſeth to teache manye moe falſe lyes, then true leſſons. They dare not rowle themſelues vp and downe in her lap, becauſe ſhe is not ye chaſte ſpouſe of Chriſt Ieſus, but that arrant whore of Babilon, that murdereth the chyldren & ſaints of God Our mother hath told vs, that our father hath commanded vs, to beléeue in one God onely, which beeing thrée in perſon, is but one in ſubſtance, eſſence & power: but your mother teacheth you to beléeue in manie Gods. For ſhe teacheth you to cal vpon Angels and ſaints, and what is that other, then to teache you to beléeue in them? For, ſ. paule writeth thus in his Epiſtle to the Romans. Cha. 10. Quomodo inuocabunt, in quē non crediderunt? How ſhall they cal vpon him, in whom they haue not beleued? Our mother hath told vs, that our father hath forbidden vs, to make to our ſelues anie grauen Images, or the likenes of any thing that is in heauen aboue, or in the earth benethe. &c. But your mother teacheth you, to make the Images of men & of Angelles, yea and of God himſelfe (whom neuer man could ſée) and to ſet them vppe in your Churches, to burne Incence vnto them, to ſet light before them, to offer gifts vnto them, to fal downe before them, and to make prayers before them, all which is directly contrary to our heauenly fathers commaundement. Our mother hath tolde vs, that our father hath forbidden vs to take his name in vaine, and that he hath commaunded vs to ſweare by him onely, and not by anie other: But your mother teacheth you to ſweare by your idolatrous maſſe, by your ſaints, and by the Images of your ſaints, and to profane the bleſſed name of God, in making your ſuperſtitious vowes, and in all your exorciſmes, & coniurations. Our mother hath told vs that our fathers will is, that we ſhould ſpende the Saboth day holilie, and not to profane it in anie condition. But your mother telleth you, that you may daunce, dallie and ſporte and plaie, bayt Bulles and Beares, and giue your ſelues to all other paſtimes on the Sabothe daie, ſo that you diſpatche your Idolatrous ſeruice in your Churches, either before or after, but you muſt in any caſe take heede, that you giue not your ſelf to any good exerciſe in that day. Our mother telleth vs, that our fathers pleaſure is, that we ſhold ſhew due obedience, to ſuch as are in any reſpect our fathers or mothers, and yt we ought to honor them, and be of duetiful behauiour towards them, yea, and (if néede ſhal ſo require) to ayde ſuccor and reléeue them, in ſuch meaſure as GOD ſhall make vs able.

But your mother teacheth you to ſay Corban, as the Phareſyes taught theyr Schollers, when our Sauiour Chriſt was amongſt them.
               Let your olde Father and Mother, (Iohn and Catherine Debnam) ſterue in England, by reaſon that being aged and impotent, they can not by laboure procure thinges néedefull, as in youth they did, and fedde both themſelues and you, with the reſt of theyr chyldren: Theyr ſonne Samuell muſt (if he will hearken to his new mother of Rome) liue ſtill in Fraunce, béeing fedde and ſuſtayned by the labour of others, and write to his Father and Mother (bee their caſe neuer ſo harde) that he muſt faſt and pray, and whippe himſelfe for their ſinnes, and obſerue the Rule of a bonehome all the dayes of his life, and not come ouer into England, and lay hys laſie limmes to any honeſt laboure, whereby he may eate his own breade, and helpe to féede the féeble bodies of his decayed Father and Mother, or doo any honeſt ſeruice in the Common weale of hys Countrey. Yea that mother of his telleth him, that he is exempted from all ſecular power, and ſo ſequeſtred from the world, that he may not imploy himſelfe, or ſuffer himſelfe to be imployed, in dooing any good therein.
               Our Mother hath tolde vs▪ that we may not ſhedde any mans bloud, for who ſo ſhall doo ſo, ſhall haue his bloude ſhedde by man. But your mother telleth you, that if you can ſhed the bloud euen of Princes that be Proteſtants, you ſhall thereby purchaſe forgiuenes of all your ſinnes, and be canonized for a ſaint, and haue your name written in the Popes Calender, yea and you ſhall be called vppon in the Letanie, amongſt ſuch as the Pope alloweth of for ſaints: Sancte Samuele Iohannes Franciſce, or a pro nobis. O holye Samuell Iohn Frauncis: pray for vs. Our mother hath told vs, that our fathers wyll is, that we ſhould kéepe our bodies vndefiled by adulterie or fornication, and that he wyll deſtroy them that ſhal defile his Temple (which is the body of euery Chriſtian) eyther by fornication or adultery, and therefore he would haue all men and women that haue not chaſte mindes in chaſt bodies, to match them ſelues in chaſte mariage. But your mother hath taught you to vowe a wiueles lyfe, net knowing whether God wyll make you able to performe that vowe or not. So that although you ſhall burne in concupiſcence neuer ſo much, yet mary you may not, to

kéepe your body vndefiled, for you haue forſworne that remedye, which is the onely remedie that God hath appointed. Our mother hath tolde vs, that our father hath forbidde vs to ſteale, or to take anie thing that doth not by ſome iuſt title belong to vs, eyther by force or by fraude: But your mother teacheth you to robbe God of his glory, yea, and to challenge and clayme to your ſelf, that which belongeth onely to him, as the appoynting of a mediator, and the meanes of mediation, for the obtayning of pardon, and forgiuenes of ſinnes: which you aſſigne to Angels and ſaints, and to maſſyng Prieſtes, and to your ſelues, and to al other merite mongers. Perſwading the poore and ſimple people that wyll harken vnto you, that by your auſteritie of life, your going and lying woolwarde, your ryſing at midnight, your ſinging, your ſaying, your faſting, your praying, and by your whypping and ſcourging, theyr ſinnes ſhalbe forgiuen, becauſe they féede and mayntain you in idlenes by their fore labours, and thus you robbe and ſpoile them of the fruite of their labours, vnder pretence of long prayers, and ſuch other hipocriticall workes, as the Phareſies did, Mathew. 23. But our mother hath tolde vs, and we beléeue it, that our father hath made his onely begotten ſonne Chriſt Ieſus, our onely Mediatory: yea, and the onelie mediator betwixt him and all mankinde. 1. Tim. 2.
               Our mother hath tolde vs, that our father hath forbidden vs to beare falſe witnes againſt any man: But your mother teacheth you to belye all ſuch as ſhe calleth Proteſtants, and to ſay of all ſuch, (as you haue in theſe your Letters written) that they are the deuills miniſters, and that their life is ſuch, that if it were knowne to the ſimple Chriſtians, they would not onely wonder at their wilines, but alſo forſake theyr folly. Whereas that which you call theyr folly, is heauenly wiſedome, and that which you call wilines in them, is ſimple and true dealing.
               Our mother hath tolde vs, that our heauenly father woulde not that we ſhould luſt after any thing, that belongeth to our neighbour: But your mother hath taught you to luſt after the kingdom of England (which belongeth not to you that be fugitiues and Rebels) & to haue your Order of Frauncis of Paula to be ſetled there. Yea, it ſéemeth that you are more then halfe aſſured that it ſhalbe ſo: For you wryte that you hope, that it ſhall ſhortly be in Englande. I feare me therefore, that fugitiue, or Rebell, is too good a

name for you, ſith you ſéeme to be ranke Traytors indéede. Well, I wold wiſh you to hearkē no lōger to your Romiſh mother, leaſt ſhe bring you at the laſt to preache at our Tyburne. A méete place for ſuch to preache in, as being Engliſh borne, haue Romiſh harts. We dare not rowle our ſelues vp and downe in the lappe of ſuch a mother. We will not forſake that mother, that hetherto hath taught vs, and doth ſtill teache vs, to feare, honour, and loue our heauenlie Father, and to frame our liues according to his will. In her lap we wyll rowle our ſelues vp and downe, as hetherto wee haue doone, and craue at Gods hands that we may doo ſo ſtyll, and encreaſe in loue toward our heauenly father, and towardes her. Her wordes we doo beléeue, and her words we doo hope we ſhal beléeue, ſo long as we ſhall liue here: for they are the words of truth, and words that teache nothing but the will of our heauenly Father, which is the God of truth.
               The Sermons which you call hereticall: your father & mother neither may nor will leaue. For they are the plentifull pappes of that louing mother, in whoſe lap they doo rowle themſelues. And out of thoſe pappes they and all others that doo rowle themſelues, together with them, in that mothers lap, doo ſucke that milke that S. Peter writeth of. 1. Pet. 2. which nouriſheth to ſaluation. They will not therefore leaue thoſe dugges, but will hange ſtill vppon them. Your mother of Rome hath not ſo ſwéete, ſo pleaſant, nor ſo healthſome milke in her withered dugges. Her milke is poyſon to the children of God: wherefore our mothers children will none of it, neither will they leaue of going to thoſe Sermons, where they may ſucke ſo much good and healthfull Milke as may ſuffice them.
               You aduiſe your mother not to riſe ſo earelie in the morning, as ſhe hath béene accuſtomed to doo, to damne herſelfe body and ſoule. Goe no more (you ſaie) to thoſe Sermōs of Crowly, Barber, Field, and the reſt. So that, to riſe in the morning to heare the Goſpell of Chriſt preached, is in the iudgment of men of your ſort, to damne both bodie and ſoule. But if your mothers dwelling were in Paris, as it is in London, and ſhee woulde riſe at midnight, and goe to Nigeon, to heare Frier John and his fellowes ſinging theyr mattins before their bleſſed ſacrament of the Altar: thē ſhe ſhould be accounted the holyeſt Matrone in all Paris. Yea her ghoſtlye Father would aſſure her, that the place which the bleſſed Virgine

Marie doth nowe poſſeſſe in the kingdome of heauen, were meane enough (yea too meane) for her. But eſpeciallie, if ſhe did not vſe to come emptie handed, but bring with her, either a bottle of the beſt Wine, or a bagge of the beſt Nuttes, or a good quantity of the beſt Figges or Reyſons, or Almons, or any other fruites, as the times of the yéere ſhould yéelde: for Minime Friers may eate all manner of fruites, when they be giuen vnto them, as Frier John himſelfe hath written.
               But doo ye not ſée (Sir Frier John) howe this parte of your exhortation, rebowndeth vpon your ſelfe. Riſe not at midnight to damne your ſelfe bodie and ſoule. Goe not, I ſaie, to ſing your Mattins before your bleſſed Sacrament of the Altare, which neyther dooth nor can heare you. Take no ſuch daily paynes as you doo, in ſinging your high maſſes, which can not profite you, but ſhall condemne you to hell fire (if you repent not) for all that you doo therein is Idolatrie, and falſe worſhippyng of God. Yea, it is the ſetting vp of an Idole in the place of God, and the giuing of Gods honour to an Idole. Returne againe therefore into Englande, and accompanie your aged mother to the places, where ſhe and you together, may heare the doctrine of ſaluation preached by Crowley, Barber, Fielde, and other. In which exerciſe, your mother attayned to the knowledge of Chriſt, euen in the daies of her virginity▪ when as yet Frier John was not Samuell Debnam. She is not builded vpon ſande or grauell: but vpon the firme Rocke Chriſte Ieſu
                     •
                  , and therefore, it is not the vayne blaſte of your Friarlike cloquence that can remooue her.
               You wiſhe her to burne her bookes of Sermons, and other bookes that haue hereſie in them. If ſhe haue any ſuch bookes (as I thinke ſhe hath not) I would wyſh her to doo as you bidde her, but if her bookes be no worſe then I doo thinke them to be, I hope ſhe wyll make greater account of them, then you wil her to make. Your maſſe bookes, your Gradalles, your Legends, your Manualles, your Portiſes, your Proceſſioners, and your Hymnalles, your Pontificalles, and your Decretalles, with the reſt of your popiſh Vtenſiles: are méeter matter to be ſacrificed in fire to Vulcan, then are thoſe bookes of your mothers, which you will her to burn. You ſay furder to her▪ Be not aſhamed of ye name of a Papiſt Goe to cōfeſſion, confeſſe your ſins to a prieſt: this is as much as to

Be not aſhamed of the name of a Traytor. For euery one that (being an Engliſh man, or woman) is a right Papiſt, ſuch a one as you bragge that your ſelfe are: the ſame is a ranke Traytor to the Prince and ſtate of the Realme of England. You haue therefore a Traytors hart towards your Prince and Country, that can wyſh your mother not to be aſhamed of the name of a Papiſt. Your mother hath learned of Ieſus Syracke, not to be ſo lauiſh of ſpéeche, as to open her ſecrete ſinnes, either to fréende or to foe. If the Prieſt that you would haue to confeſſe her ſinnes to, be neither her fréend nor her foe: then perhaps ſhe may be perſwaded to tell him ſomewhat. Syracke. 19
               But wyll you ſée, what opininion S. Auſten hath conceiued of theſe ghoſtly fathers that you ſpeake of. Quid mihi ergo est cum hominibus, vt audiant confeſſiones meas: quaſi ipſi ſanaturi ſint omnes lāguores meos? Curioſum genus▪ ad cognoſcendam vitam alienam deſidioſum ad corrigendam ſuam. Quid a me quaerunt audire qui ſim: qui nolunt a te audire qui ſint? Et vnde ſciunt, cum a meipſo de meipſo audiunt: an verum dicam? quandoquidem nemo ſcit hominum, quid agatur in homine, niſi ſpiritus hominis qui in ipſo eſt? Auguſtinus confeſſionum, libri. 10. cap. 3. What haue I to doo with men yt they ſhould heare my confeſſions: as though they ſhould heale all my langors? A kinde of men curious to knowe the life of another man, but ſlack to amende their owne. Why doo they ſéeke to heare what manner of man I am: which are not wylling to heare thée declare what manner of men themſelues be. And when they doo heare me make report of my ſelfe, howe doo they knowe whether I doo ſay true or not? For no man doth knowe what is doone in man, but the ſpirite of man which is in him. Auſten, in the 10. booke of his confeſſions, the 3. Chapter.
               I hope you wyll not blame your mother, though ſhe followe not your counſell, ſith both S. Auſten and Ieſus Syracke haue aduiſed her to doo the contrary. She doth confeſſe her ſinnes to God euery day, becauſe ſhe is aſſured, that he doth knowe when ſhe ſpeaketh trueth. And that he is able to pardon and to forgiue her ſins, and that being vnfaynedly penitent for her ſinnes, he doth and wyll pardon, forgiue and forget her ſinnes, according to the ſaying of the Prophet Ezechiel. Chap. 18, At what time ſoeuer a ſinner ſhall repent him of his ſinnes from the bottome of his hart, I will

put all his wickednes out of my remembraunce.
               Your mother, and all we Proteſtants, are and wilbe ready to doo as ſaint Iames teacheth in his 5. Epiſtle, where he ſayth thus: Confeſſe your ſinnes one to another. When we haue treſpaſſed one againſt another, we acknowledge our faultes one to another. We aſke forgiuenes one of another. We ſatiſfie & make a mendes one to another, if our habilitie will ſtretch ſo far: if not▪ we know that God wyll require no more of vs, then hee will make vs able to doo. And as touching faults that are committed againſt vs, wée forgiue them, as Chriſt hath commaunded and taught vs. Yea, though our brother ſhall treſpaſſe againſt vs ſeauen times in a daie, and ſhall ſaie ſeauen times in a day, it repenteth me: we forgiue, becauſe we knowe that otherwiſe our heauenly father wyll not forgiue vs. And when the horrour of our ſinne, is ſo great before our eyes, that we can not otherwiſe be ſatiſfied, and aſſured of forgiuenes at Gods hande, but by ſuch comfort, as ſome that wee thinke to be of more knowledge, and of better life then we knowe our ſelues to be of, can miniſter vnto vs: then we make choyſe of ſome ſuch one as can certifie vs indéede, by the mercifull promiſes of God contained in the holie Scriptures▪ made to peniſēt ſinners, and not by popiſh penaunce enioyned, and popiſh abſolution pronounced, by vertue of anie power giuen by that moſt holy Father of yours, the Romiſh Antichriſt. Wée are not ſo madde as you were, when you hauing taſted of the ſwéete mylke that our Mother, the true Catholicke and Apoſtolicke Church did miniſter vnto vs, by her pappes that ſhe offered to vs, at the Spittle in Eaſter wéeke, 1583. woulde on the Saterday following (as your ſelfe doo write) runne into a corner, like a Waltams Calfe, ſéeking to bee ſatiſfied with the mylke of a Bull. Giuing credite to a falſe forſworne Traytor, that (without all manner of proofe) told you, that all the healthful milke that you had ſucked before, was poyſon, and that if you would finde milke that might féede you to euerlaſting life, you muſt runne to Rhemes, or to Rome, for there it is to bee had, and not els where. But I hope you will remember your ſelfe better, and returne to your firſt fayth, from which you are for a whyle fallen, that ryſing againe you may confirme others, & ſtay them from the like horrible fall.
               You wyſhe your mother to leaue this worlde that is ſo diſceitful,

and to ſticke vnto God. So ſhe did before you were borne, and doth ſtill, & ſo purpoſeth to continue all the daies of her life: though ſhe minde not to ſhake of the yoke of duetie towards her huſband, (your father) and profeſſe herſelfe a Nunne, as you haue profeſſed your ſelfe a Fryer, and haue ſhaken of the yoke of duetifull obedience to her and to your aged Father, and to the Common weale of your Countrey, that hath nouriſhed you vp, whervnto you doo by naturall order, owe a third part of that ſeruice that GOD hath made you able to doo. Your mother knewe, before ſhe did knowe you, that this worlde is diſceitfull, and therefore, ſhee neuer did repoſe any truſt in it. She hath learned to liue in the worlde, and not to be of the worlde, neither to ſerue the worlde, but to ſerue him that made her and the worlde, giuing his creatures to her and others his children in the world, for whoſe cauſe he hath made all his creatures that are in this worlde. And ſhe hath learned to be thankfull to God, for the vſe of his creatures in the world, and not to be in loue with thys worlde, or with anie thing in it, but to haue her affection ſtyll fixed vpon that other worlde, where ſhee is aſſured that ſhe ſhall for euer dwell with him, that hath made both this and that world. She is not ſo madde as to thinke that there is none other way to heauen, but thorowe Rome gates. She knoweth that Chriſt Ieſus is the way, the trueth, and the life: and not the Pope, nor your Frauncis, nor any other father of your n

                  we founde Religions.
               Although you ſay that your Religions are auncient, and ours newe, yet ſhe knoweth that yours are new, and ours is auncient. And although you charge vs with many Religions, yet ſhe knoweth that our Religion is but one, and yours is manifolde. You haue written, that your Order is called the Order of S. Frauncis of Paula: what that Frauncis was, or in what time he liued, I can not finde in any Hiſtory. Sabellicus, and other Hiſtorians haue noted, that about 400. yéeres paſt, there liued in Italie, one Franciſcus Aſiſias, a man of ſinguler vertue (as they reporte) and that this man beganne a newe Order of Fryers, whom he named Minors. And after that, he inſtituted an other Order, whom▪ he called Pauperes, or poore Friers. There ſpronge from him a thyrde Order alſo, which were called Poenitentes, or repenting Friers. By all likelihoode, your Order is of that ſort of Fryers. But let it be

of which you luſt to make it, it can not be of ſuch antiquit
                     •
                  , that you may compare with vs. We hold not of anie of them that you name Captaine Proteſtants. We are not Caluiniſts, we are not Zwynglians, we are not Lutherans, Wickliffians, nor Huſſians: yea, we holde neyther of Apollo, of Peter, nor of Paule: but wee holde of Chriſt onely, and are and wylbe called Chriſtians. You are and wilbe called Minimes, Franciſcans, Dominickes, Minorites, Carmelites, Benedictines, Augustines, Barnardines, and I knowe not what. And by a common name, you wylbe called Papiſts.
               Your popiſh Religion beganne, when the Popes did firſt take vppon them the high dignitie of vniuerſall Byſhops, and heades of the vniuerſall Church of Chriſt, which was about 610. yéeres after the Aſcention of our Sauiour Chriſt, not full 1000. yéeres before this day. At which time, Bonifacins the third of that name, was ordeyned the high and vniuerſall Biſhop. But our Religion beganne in Adam, and continued in the poſterity of Sethe, euen tyll the incarnation of Chriſt, and was by him made Catholicke, to bée vniuerſally receiued of all Nations. And that Religion onelie doo we holde and profeſſe. And in this Religion were you baptized amongſt vs. And this Religion did you once profeſſe, before many witneſſes. I would therefore wyſh you to leaue your newe Religion, and profeſſe your olde Religion againe, repenting vnfainedly your Apoſtacie, and crauing forgiuenes at our heauenly fathers handes, who is alwayes more ready to graunt vs pardon, then we can be to craue it. So ſhall you ſhewe your ſelfe to doo, as you wyſh your mother to doo: that is, you ſhall leaue the worlde, and worldly deuiſes, and cleaue vnto God alone, as your mother and al vnfained Proteſtants doo. You procéede, and ſay thus.
            
            
               The Fryer.
               Beleeue me if you wyll: I know as wel as you, the hereſies of Caluine and Luther, and could peraduentnre, haue defended them, better then you can. And therefore, knowing their opinions, and ſeeing that they were moſte falſe and damnable, contrary to all holeſome doctrine, and to the Scripture it ſelfe: I was by reaſon of thys conſtrained to leaue them, and to make my ſelfe a Papiſt. For truſt me if you wyll, when ye ſhall yeelde your ſoules to God, your bodies returning to the earthe, you wyll then tell me another tale. You would then if you could,

bewayle your ſinnes, but you ſhall not be able &c.
            
            
               Crowley.
               If we wyll beléeue you, we may. But for my parte I can hardly beléeue, that eyther you did then, or doo nowe, knowe the doctrines that Luther and Caluine taught, which you call hereſies, ſo well as your Father and mother both did then and doo now knowe them. But be it that you did: yet without peraduenture, you were neuer able to defende them halfe ſo well, as they bothe could and can. For if you had béene of ſuch habilitie to defend our Religion, as your Father and mother were then, and be now alſo, vndoubtedly, you coulde neuer haue béene ſo ſoone vanquiſhed as you were, by ſo weake aduerſaries, as by all likelihoode you had. But it ſéemeth that you had no outward aduerſary at all, but the ſpirit of Arrogancie onely that lurked within you, and mooued you to preſume vpon your ſelfe, and to take vppon you to iudge of the doctrine of others, before you had any knowledge of doctrine your ſelfe. But we muſt beleeue you (if wee luſt) when you ſay that you did knowe theyr opinions, & did ſée that they were moſte falſe, and abhominable, and contrary to all holeſome doctrine, and to the Scripture it ſelfe: and by reaſon of thys, you were conſtrained to leaue them, and to make your ſelfe a Papiſt. A meruailous matter (more to be muſed at then to be beléeued) that ſo young a man as Samuell Debnam was, in Anno. 1583. (at which time he was not Fryer John Frauncis) ſhoulde haue in that little corps of his, all holeſome learning, and ſuch a knowledge of Scriptures, that he was able to affyrme for truth, that the opinions that Caluine and Luther helde, are contrary both to all holeſome doctrine, and to the Scripture it ſelfe. And yet I dare affyrme for trueth, that this profounde Clarke, did neuer (before that time, wherein hee ſayth he was enforced to make himſelfe a Papyſt) reade any one worke thorowe, that either Caluine or Luther haue written. Yea, and as I thinke, I may be bolde to affyrme, that this proſounde Diuine, had at that time, as little knowledge of that doctrine which he calleth ſounde: as any young Grammarian, eyther hath or can haue of the déepeſt miſteries of Diuinitie. For I knowe, that before that time he neuer gaue himſelfe to any graue ſtudy. neyther dyd he gyue himſelfe to any manner of orderly reading. But his whole time (in manner) was ſpent in toying and tryfling, and for ye moſt parte in idlenes, and vayne playing. And in the Scriptures, hee

coulde haue none other knowledge, then ſuch as he might attayne vnto, either by hearing in the Churches (where he neuer vſed to hearken attentiuely) or els by reading in my houſe, at the times of myne ordinary dinners and ſuppers, vnto which exerciſe I did employe him, as I did other young boyes, that I kept in my houſe, as I kept him. And yet ſée howe he taketh vppon him, to condemne for moſt falſe, damnable, and contrary to all holeſome doctrine, yea and to the Scripture it ſelfe, the opinions that thoſe two excellent men (John Caluine and Martine Luther) helde and taught, and haue left behinde them in wryting to the viewe of all poſteritye. Arroganting to himſelfe, the full and perfect knowledge, as well of the Scriptures, as of all humane Doctrines, both good and bad. Yea▪ (by thoſe ſpéeches that he vſeth) he would ſeeme to haue read and wayed, both the one and the other, and to haue conferred the one with the other, as one very deſirous to haue founde them agreeable, the one to the other. But the falſhode of that which hee then fauoured, was ſo great and damnable, and the contrariety to all holeſome doctrine, and to the Scripture it ſelf, ſo manifeſt: that although 
                     •
                  ore agaynſt his wyll, he was conſtrayned to leaue the doctrine and profeſſyon of a Proteſtant, and to make himſelfe a Papyſt. Yea, by the wordes that he addeth, he ſeemeth to be perſwaded, that except he had doone ſo, he muſt of neceſſity, haue periſhed euerlaſtingly▪ For thus he ſayth.
               Truſt me (if you wyll) when yee ſhall yéelde your ſoules to God &c. You wyll tell me another tale: you woulde then yf you coulde &c. But you ſhall not be able. Would not a man (that readeth theſe wordes) thinke that thys young Fryer, hath as much knowledge as is poſſible for a man to haue? And yet when he is opened, and thorowly ſearched, there is not one crumme of knowledge founde in him. Undoubtedly, it was but a viſion in ſléepe, that deceiued him. He dreamed that he knewe the opinions, that he wryteth of: and that he compared them with all holeſome doctrine, and with the Scripture, and founde them, as he reporteth. But when he ſhall awake out of hys dreame (for as yet, hee lyeth ſno
                     •
                  ing and ſnorting, in his déepe ſléepe of wylfull ignorance) then he ſhalbe that caſe that the poore begger was in, which awaking out of hys ſleepe, ſought after money, but founde not one croſſe of Coyne about him, notwithſtanding, that in his ſléepe he dreamed

that he had more bagges of Golde then he was able to beare. Hee vttered certayne ſpéeches amongſt his companions, whylſt he was in my houſe, before he tooke his iourney into Fraunce, which wordes doo ſauour of ſuch a Dreame. What wyll you ſay (ſayth this dreamer) when you ſhall ſée me preache at Paules Croſſe? And agayne. I wyll ſée Rome before I bee a yéere elder. Theſe ſpéeches agree with that deſire that he had to creepe into the wéede of a Minime Fryer. No man coulde diſwade him from it. By all likelihoode he had hearde that diuers Friers of S. Frauncis Order, haue béene made Popes of Rome. As Sabellicus the Hyſtorian noteth, that before his time, fiue Franciſcane Fryers hadde beene made Popes. Enneadis▪
                   9. Libro. 6. And I knowe the courage of Fryer Iohn Frauncis to be ſuch: that though his perſonne be but little, yet hys heade would holde vp the triple Crowne. And although there haue béene many bloudy beaſts that haue worne that crowne, yet I thinke that amongſt them all, there hath not beene one more bloudy, then thys little vermine woulde be, if he myght once change his Minimes hoode for a triple Crowne. But to returne to our matter. He procéedeth with hys exhortation to hys Father and mother, and thus he ſayth.
            
            
               The Fryar.
               I haue hearde my mother ſay, that in the olde tyme, the people were more deuoute then nowe they be. Nowe, if ſo be that, you be nowe gouerned by God, and the Papiſts in olde time were gouerned by the deuill, you muſt needes confeſſe, that the deuill is better able to make men deuout then God is, for becauſe that by your owne confeſſyon, the Papiſts were more deuout in the olde time, then the Proteſtants are nowe.
            
            
               Crowley.
               Thys is a poynt of déepe Diuinity, and of as cunning Sophiſtry. Fryer Iohns Mother did once ſay ſo, therefore of neceſſity it muſt needes be ſo. But it may be, that Fryers of your Order haue a Priuiledge, whereby they may frame arguments, that ſhall conclude neither in Mode nor in Figure: and yet no man may denie, either the argument or any part thereof. I haue hearde it reported, that once there was a Pope, that would ſéeme to be a better Latiniſt then he was indéede, and therfore he would nowe and then be talking a little Latine, though hee did oftentimes reache Priſcian a blowe. But on a time, there was one preſent, that hearing him make default in not obſeruing the Rules of

Grammer in his ſpéeche: thought good wyth due reuerence to admoniſh him, ſaying: It may pleaſe your holines to pardon my boldnes▪ As I take it, your holines hath broken Priſcians heade. The Pope anſwered, and ſayd: As I haue ſpoken ſo ſhall it bée, in deſpight of Priſcian, and all the Grammarians in the worlde. Nowe, if that holy Father, or any other amongſt your holy fathers of Rome, haue graunted you as large a liberty in framing Arguments, as that holy Father himſelfe vſed in ſpeaking Latine, then you may maintayne your argument for good amongſt Papiſtes, but amongſt Proteſtants it wyll neuer be allowed for good. The meaning of your mothers wordes, is as much as if ſhee ſhould ſay thus. The people were more addicted to Religion, in the olde time then they be nowe, but the Religion that then was in vre, is a corrupted and vnpure Religion, and the Religion that now is in vſe is more ſincere and pure. The people therefore are more addicted to embrace a corrupted Religion, then that which is more pure. Thys argument hath ſome ſence in it. And this ſaying is according to that ſaying of our Sauiour Chriſt. Iohn. 3. Lyght is come into the worlde, and men haue loued darknes more then light. Nowe, if you ſhoulde enforce theſe words againſt the Apoſtle, and others that were the Schollers of Chriſt, you ſhoulde doo them great wrong, for they were not of that ſorte of men, that loued darknes more then light, for they were choſen out of ye world, and had theyr myndes renued, and as they were renued, they loued light and hated darknes, that is, ignoraunce and wickednes of lyfe, which is the fruite of ignoraunce and darknes. Euen ſo, you doo open wrong to the Proteſtants, in that you enforce your mothers ſpéeche agaynſt them, concluding that of neceſſity they muſt confeſſe, that eyther they be gouerned by the deuill: or els that the deuill is better able to worke deuotion in men, the God himſelfe is. Thys concluſion followeth not vpon the Premiſſes. For although men generally, haue not ſo great deuotion to the true Religion that is nowe in vſe, as generally they had to that Religion, that was in vſe in the time of ignoraunce: yet ſuch as be now vnfayned Chriſtians, euen ſuch as men of your ſorte doo vſe to call Proteſtants, haue nowe as greate deuotion to the right Religion, as euer the Papyſts had to theyr vayne ſuperſtition, or as you (Maſter Fryer John) haue nowe to that ſolery yt you haue nowe

profeſſed in Nigeon.
               
               The ryght Proteſtant, is the right Chriſtian, and hath receiued the ſpyrite of Chriſt (as all that belong to Chriſt haue doone. Rom. 8.) and is gouerned and ledde by that ſpyrite, which ſpirite worketh in him▪ a feruent deuotion to ſerue God, in ſpyrit & in trueth, that is in true holines and righteouſ
                     •
                  es. The ryght Papyſt, is the ryght Antichriſtian, and hath receiued the ſpirite of Antichriſt, and is gouerned and ledd
                     •
                   by that ſpyrite, becauſe he hath gyuen ouer himſelfe to be ledde by that ſpyrite, forſaking ye ſpirit of truth. 2. Theſ. 2. I conclude therefore, that your concluſion that you infer vpon thoſe wordes that you haue hearde your mother ſpeake, concerning the deuotion of the people in the olde time, is a fonde fryarlike concluſion, and toucheth not vs any thing at all. We know that our God is in heauen, and that he can doo what hee wyll doo, and hath doone what he woulde doo, both in heauen, in earth, and in hell, and in all deepe places. As for the deuill, we knowe hym to be but a ſl
                     •
                  ue to our God. And that of himſelfe, he hath no power at all. For all power belongeth to God. Pſal. 62 And we knowe that deuotion, is a good gyft, and therefore commeth from GOD, who is the gyuer of all good gyfts, and that no good gyft doth, or can come from the deuill. That therefore, which you call deuotion, and is wrought in you Papiſts by ye ſpyrit of Antichriſt (which is the deuill) is no deuotion indeede, but a méere ſuperſtition, and a ſuperſtitious zeale to falſe Religion. And thus much for aunſwere to that matter. You procéede and you ſay thus▪

Whoſoeuer loueth Father or mother, Brother or ſiſter, ſonne or daughter, landes or goods, yea or his owne ſoule more then me, he is not worthy to be my diſciple.

Such care for our ſoules health, as becommeth Chriſtians, wée haue had, haue ſtil, and we doo not doubt but we ſhall haue, ſo long as we ſhall liue in thys tranſitory eſtate. The ſaying of our bleſſed Lorde and Sauiour, we forget not, We loue not Father, mother,

ſonne, daughter, landes, goods, no nor our owne ſoules more then we loue him. Yea we loue none of theſe otherwiſe then in him, and for his cauſe. And yet doo we not thinke our ſelues worthy to be his Schollers. But hys holy ſpirite which he hath gyuen vs, doth inwardly in our harts aſſure vs, yt in mercy hee hath accepted of vs, & made vs not onely his Schollers, but alſo his ſons and daughters by adoption, inheritours of his owne kingdom, and heyres annexed with hys onely begotten ſonne, Chriſt Ieſus. And therefore, we doo not in our dangers flée from him (as you Papiſts doo, ſéeking helpe in creatures) but we flée to him, as obedient children to a louing Father, and we cry Abbapater, Father, Father, But let vs ſée what followeth in your exhortation.

               Beleeue me, I pray you, I am your ſonne. Beleeue not them that flatter you before your face, and behind your back laugh you to ſcorne. If your hart be turned (as I beſeeche God it may be) if you can not finde a Prieſt to heare your confeſſyon, & to reconcile you, and make you a member of the holy Church, at the leaſt wiſe burne your bookes hereticall, vſe not the Englyſh Bible, goe no more to the Proteſtants Sermons, buy a payre of Beades, and pray to our bleſſed Ladye to helpe you, and wyſh in your hart that you had a Prieſt to confeſſe you, and wiſh ſo as often as you can, but ſpecially when you fall ſicke, or that you are like to die. Purpoſe ſtedfaſtly, if you coulde conueniently, to confeſſe your ſinnes, and to goe to ſhryft? &c.

               When you woulde perſwade your Mother to burne her Bookes, you put her in minde of thys ſaying of our Sauiour Chriſte: Whoſoeuer loueth father or mother. &c. But nowe, when you laboure to drawe her from Chriſt to Antichriſt, ſhe muſt beléeue you, for you are her ſonne. A pretie point of Rhethorike, and very rhethoricallie applyed. If your behauiour had béene ſuch towards your mother, that ſhe might haue had thereby ſome cauſe to thinke, that you beare a childlike affection towardes her: or if you had in theſe your Letters, ſought by humble and dutifull ſpéeches, to winne agayne that fauour, which by vnduetifull behauiour you haue loſt: then it might haue ſtande with ſome reaſon, that you require her to giue credite to you (her naturall ſon) rather then to any other, ſuch as you ſpeake of. But ſith you neyther haue nor can purge your ſelfe of that déepe diſſimulation that

you vſed, at and before you ſlipped away from her, neither of that vndutifull behauiour that hath béene in you towardes her, in all the time of your abſence, and is ſtill: I can not ſhinke that you were well aduiſed, when you woulde vſe that way to perſwade. For what mother can beléeue any word that is ſpoken or written by that ſonne, that would hipocritically accompany her to the Sermons at Eaſter, and with his penne take notes of them: and yet on the Saterdaie following, woulde goe ſecretely to a Romiſhe ghoſtlie Father, and be by him reconciled to the Romiſh Catholick Church, promiſing to be an enemie, yea a mortall enemie all the reſt of his life daies, to the doctrine which he had ſo latelie hearde, and in outward ſhewe ſéemed to haue allowed of? yea and what credite can you hope to haue at her handes, in whoſe company, you receiued (I feare me to your owne condemnation) the holy Supper of the Lord, the next day after you had béene reconciled to that Antichriſtian Church of Rome? And how can you hope, that your mother will beléeue you, that making haſte to be gone from her, on the Munday in the after noone, pretended to goe to heare that Hebrewe Lecture, that the miſchieuous Hereticke Ba
                        •

And doo you think that you (lying ſo nigh London the two firſt nights, after your departing from your mother, and three wéekes after that, within one mile of London, and hearing what ſearche was made for you, by your carefull parents and other fréendes, would not ſhewe your ſelfe to that ſorowfull mother, but ſuffer her to continue ſtill in that remediles care, not onelie during the ſpace of thrée monthes, which was the time that you continued in Englande, before you could paſſe ouer the Seas: but alſo, euen to the ende almoſt of thrée yéeres, continuing in Fraunce, would neuer make your place and caſe knowne to your mother, or anie of your fré
                     •
                  ndes in England) can haue anie ſuch credite with this mother of yours, as in theſe wordes of yours you ſéeme to make account of? If your Mother will hearken to you, ſhe may giue no credite to thē that flatter her to her face, but laugh her to ſcorne behinde her back. And I pray you, can there be any that hath or coulde deale ſo with her more then you haue doone? Can any man thinke that you did not laugh in your ſléeue, when you heard that your father and mother made ſuch enquirie and ſearch after you, and yet coulde not méete wyth

you? and could anie flatter your mother to her face, more then you did all yt Eaſter time before you departed? There is no cauſe there fore, why ſhe ſhould either giue leſſe credite to any, then to you, or diſtruſt any more then you. If her hart be turned from Chriſte to Antichriſt (as you doo craue of God it may be) then ſhe muſt ſéeke for a prieſt, to heare her confeſſion & reco
                     •
                  cile her, and make her a member of ye holy Church, but though ſhe can find no ſuch prieſt, yet ſhe muſt (if ſhe wil folow your aduice) burn her hereticall bookes, & vſe the Engliſh Bible no more, and refrain going to ye Proteſtants Sermons. To pleaſure your mother in this caſe, you might haue doone very well, to haue written to her, where and howe ſhe might

                  inde one of theſe reconciling prieſts, and by what token ſhe might know a right reconciling prieſte, frō a coſening knaue, leaſt hoping to be made a member of ye holy Church, ſhe might be admitted into the ſociety and felowſhip of coſoning mates, that haue no authority from your Antichriſt of Rome, and ſo ſhoulde ſhe be in worſe caſe then now ſhe is, or that you doo now ſuppoſe her to be. For hauing forſaken God (as you doo aduice her to doo) ſhe ſhould not be receiued of Antichriſt, and ſo ſhould ſhe be as a maſterles hownde, that ſmelleth to euerie mans garment, and neuer findeth any that will accept of his ſeruice. And where as you wiſhe her in any caſe to burne her hereticall bookes, you might haue doone wel to direct her to places & perſons, where, and by whoſe meanes ſhee might come by ſuch bookes yt you doo allow for Catholick. &c. But in that which followeth, it appeareth what your meaning is. For ſhe may neyther vſe the Bible in Engliſh, nor heare the Proteſtants preache, neither doo you direct her which way ſhe may take, to come where ſhe may heare Catholick preachers. Your meaning therfore muſt néedes be, to bring her into the darke dungion of ignoraunce, which men̄ of your ſort doo vſe to call the mother of deuotion & obedience. And this your meaning is opened in theſe words following. Buy a paire of Beades. &c. What man or woman, that hath any maner glimmering of Chriſtian knowledge, can like of that manner of praying yt they doo vſe, which pray vpon Beades? Firſt, they perſwade thēſelues that they pray to our Lady. And ſo doo you exhorte your mother to doo, for you ſay. Bie a paire of beades, and pray our bleſſed Ladie to help you. But can you perſwade your ſelfe, that you pray to our bleſſed Ladye, when you ſaye. Our Father

which art in heauen. &c. And hayle Mary full of grace. &c. And I beléeue in GOD the Father. &c? There is not one petition in the Lordes prayer, that may anie way be thought to bee a petition made to that bleſſed Virgin: except you can imagine that ſhee is that Father which ſéeth in ſecrete, to whom our Sauiour Chriſte commaunded hys Schollers to pray, when hee taught them howe they ſhoulde pray, ſaying: When you pray you ſhall ſay. Our Father, which art in Heauen. &c And in that ſalutation which the Angell Gabriell vſed to the bleſſed Virgine, there is not one word of petition or prayer, made eyther to her or to any other. And as for the Créede, it is a confeſſyon of beléefe, wherein are contayned the ſpeciall Articles of the Chriſtian fayth: but there is not one worde therein that can be, by any meanes wreſted, to ſerue for petition or prayer. Nowe, the order of your praying vpon Beades is thus.
               Fyrſt you ſay one Pater noſter. Then, the Aue Maria tenne times, and then one Pater noſter, and agayne, the Aue Maria ten times: and ſo forth, tyll you haue rehearſed the Pater noster fiue times, and the Aue Maria fyftie times. And then you rehearſe Credo in Deum Patrem, once. And this is the order of your praying vpon Beades. And when you haue gone ouer your Beades three times, in this order: then you haue ſayd our Ladies Pſalter (as you doo terme it) I meruaile yt you did not aduiſe your Mother to forget the Lords Prayer and the Creede, that ſhe hath learned in the Engliſhe tongue, and learne the Pater noster, the Aue Maria, and the Credo in Deum, in the Latine tongue. For our Engliſhe Prayers can not agrée with your Italian Beades. Neither is it poſſible, for that perſon to be deuout, in that kind of deuotion, that is not ſo ignoraunt, that he vnderſtandeth not one word of ye prayers that he vſeth. I meruayle therefore, that you which doo vnderſtand the Latine tongue, can be ſo blinded, that you can allowe of that manner of praying. I feare me, that you haue ſo prouoked God to wrathe, by your wylfull Apoſtacie, that in iuſtice he hath ſo blinded your vnderſtanding, that you take darknes for light, and ignoraunce for knowledge: the deuill for God, and GOD for the deuill. And then is your caſe moſt miſerable, as ſayth the Prophet Eſay. V ae qui dicitis bonum malum & malum bonum. &c. Eſay. 5. Woe is vnto you, or alas for you, that doo ſay that good is euil, and

that euyll is good. If thys be your caſe, I doo not hope, that thys which I nowe doo, or that can be doone by any other, can helpe any thing at all to drawe you out of your darke dungion of ignorance. But hoping better of you, and that though my laboure coulde not profite you, yet ſome other may bee profited thereby. I haue thought good to make thys matter as plaine as I can, that the manifeſt truth, may (if it be poſſible) preuayle with you, and bring you backe agayne to your former happy eſtate, wherein you were once, and ſéemed to be ſetled therein. If that can not bee, yet I hope this labour of mine may be a meane to ſtay ſome ſuch as you were from running headlong after you into that pytte of deſtruction that you are fallen into.
               You teache your mother to craue helpe at the handes of the bleſſed virgin, that was neuer able to helpe her ſelfe. Shee her ſelfe ſayth, That her ſpyrite reioyced in God her Sauiour: and woulde you that your mother ſhoulde nowe put that bleſſed virgin (whom God hath ſaued) in the place of that God that ſaued her, by crauing that helpe at her handes, which can not be had at the handes of any, but of God himſelfe? Your mother had learned (before ſhée bare you) that it is God that draweth the Infants out of theyr mothers wombe, and that it is he that ſuſtaineth them whylſt they hang vpon their mothers dugges. Pſalm. 22. And when ſhe trauelled of Chylde, ſhe called vpon him, and not vpon the bleſſed virgin. And whence came thys calling vppon the bleſſed Virgin in that caſe, but from the cuſtome of the Heathen women, which beeing perſwaded that the Moone hath a naturall dominion in moyſt matters, called vppon her vnder the name of Iuno lucina. And when Chriſtians beganne to declyne from that perfection of Chriſtian knowledge that had beene taught by the Apoſtles, and theyr immediate ſucceſſors: Chriſtian women thought they ſhould not doo amiſſe, to put the bleſſed mother of our Sauiour Chriſt, in ye place of this Iuno, and ſo they fel to calling vpon her, in their peril in the trauayle of Childbyrth. And wyll you bring your mother backe agayne to this ſuperſtition?
               If you wyll giue any credite to ſaint Auguſtine, hee wyll fell you, that the bleſſed Virgin dooth neyther require nor allow of anie ſuch honour to be giuen vnto her. In his Booke intituled of true Religion, and in the laſt Chapter thereof, hee wryteth thus.

                  raue helpe at her handes, as you exhorte your mother to doo: is to put her in the place of God, by giuing Gods honour to her, and ſo making an Idole of her. If it be not lawful to beléeue in her, then is it not lawfull to pray to her. For the Apoſtle ſaith: Quomodo inuocabūt in quem non crediderunt. Howe ſhall they call vpon him, in whom they haue not beléeued? Rom. 10. The Prophet Dauid, in the Pſalme 50. ſpeaking in the perſonne of GOD, ſayeth: Call vppon mee in the day of thy trouble, I wyll deliuer thee, and thou ſhalt glorifie mée. The ſame Prophete ſayth, Pſalme, 145 The Lorde is harde at hande, with euerie one that calleth vppon him: with euerie one that calleth vpon him faithfully. In another Pſalme, the ſame Prophete ſayth thus, ſpeaking in the perſon of GOD. I am the Lorde thy God, which brought thee out of the lande of Egypt: open thy mouth wyde, and I wyll fill it.
               By opening the mouth, is there meant, the crauing at Gods

handes by prayer, which the people of GOD are there commanded to vſe. Pſalme. 81. Aſſuring themſelues to receiue at his hands as much as they doo or can aſke.
               If you would marke well the Pſalmes that you vſe to ſing in your midnight Mattins, you ſhoulde finde in them many ſuch encouragements to call vppon GOD, but not one worde to encourage you, to call vpon any creature, be the ſame neuer ſo excellent or holy. Yea, if you ſhall reade the whole Scriptures thorow, from the firſt word in Geneſis, to the laſte in the Reu

Yea, you ſhall not finde any one example in any holy man, that hath fledde from GOD, to ſeeke helpe at the handes of creatures at anie time.

O yee Heauens (ſayth the Lord) bée aſtoniſhed at this thing, & yee Gates thereof be ye greatly abaſhed. For my people haue committed two euills. They haue forſaken me, which am the Fountaine of lyuing water, and they haue dygged Ceaſternes for themſelues, Ceaſternes that can not holde Water. Heere the Prophet leremie diſprooueth the people of Iuda for two euills. And hee dooth it in the perſonne of God himſelfe.
               One of thoſe euils is, the forſaking of him, the Fountayne of liuing water, as you teache your mother to doo, when you will her to burne her Bookes, and to leaue the vſe of the Engliſhe Byble. The other euill is, the dygging of Ceaſterns, that can not holde any water. This euill you feache your mother to commit, when you wyll her to buy a payre of Beades, and to pray our bleſſed Ladie to helpe her. Although that bleſſed virgin bee a moſt excellent creature, yet ſhe is but a creature, and therefore but a broken Ceaſterne in compariſon of GOD, which is the Fountaine of lyuing Water.
               
                  They therefore that ſéeke helpe at her hande, doo but dygge a broken Ceſterne, for ſhe could neuer helpe her ſelfe, as before I haue moſt plainely prooued, much leſſe can ſhe helpe them that flée from God, and ſéeke helpe at her hande. The ſentences of Scripture that I haue before cited, doo moſt manifeſtly proue, that there is no cauſe that may giue vs occaſion to flée from God, to ſéeke help at the handes of any other.
               He is almighty, able to helpe in euery neede. Hee is mercifull, and readie to helpe in all diſtreſſes. He is faithfull, and hath promiſed to helpe ſuch as call vpon him faythfully. He knoweth our caſe, and néedeth not any Memoranſor to put him in minde of our caſe. He hath a prouident and fatherly care for vs, ſo that he letteth no occaſion ſlyppe, but taketh euery occaſion to doo vs good. And would you wyſh your mother, to forſake thys ſo mighty, ſo mercifull, ſo faythfull, and ſo prouident a father, and to gyue herſelfe to the ſeruice of hys daughter, in whom none of theſe thinges be, otherwyſe then by participation from thys father, in whom the fulnes of all theſe things remayneth? God forbid. Remember your ſelfe better (Samuell) and make haſte home againe. Tarry no longer in that Dungeon of darknes in Nigeon. Take againe that fruition of the light of the Goſpell, that once you did enioye in Englande. Shake of thoſe chaynes of ignoraunce, wherein ſathan hath ſo bywrapped you: and embrace againe with vs, the fréedome of knowledge, which the almighty GOD hath ſo plentifully beſtowed vpon Englande. But let vs conſider, that which is next in your exhortation.

And ſhe muſt purpoſe ſtedfaſtly, to confeſſe her ſinnes and to goe to ſhryft, if ſhee could conueniently. Of ſuch Prieſtes, as you would haue your mother to wyſhe for, I haue before written ſufficiently.

Holy ſhee is not, becauſe ſhe renounceth that holines that is fréely giuen in Chriſt, and cleaueth to an holines, that ſhe imagineth to be in her owne workes, wherein no holines at all, either is or can be before God. The caſe of this Romaine Church, is as euill, or worſe then the caſe of the Church of the Jewes was, when they béeing ignorant of the righteouſnes of God, ſought to eſtabliſh their owne right

vppe and aduaunce their owne holines (which is no holines indeede) and ſo are not, neither can be ſubiecte to that holines that God giueth in Chriſt: and ſo by good conſequence▪ there is in them no holines at all. Catholicke that Romaine Church is not: for that ſhe holdeth not that fayth, which Chriſt in his owne perſon taught in Jeruſalem, and in other parts of the lande of Iewrie, and at the time of his Aſcention into heauen, commaunded his Apoſtles to teache Catholickly, that is, all the worlde ouer, according to the ſignification of the worde Catholicè. That is Catholickly, or vniuerſally. In his owne perſonne our Sauiour Chriſt did preache this fayth, as appeareth in the firſt Chapter of S. Marke. Postquā autem tradi

Repent, and beléeue the Goſpell. To beléeue the Goſpell, is that fayth which is called Catholicke. And whoſoeuer beléeueth the Goſpell, is a Catholicke. And on the contrary, he that beléeueth not the Goſpell, is no Catholicke. To beléeue the Goſpell, is to b
                     •
                  léeue Gods word. For in our olde Engliſhe ſpéeche, Gods worde was called Gods ſpeale: and nowe (corruptly) we doo call it Goſpell. This Goſpell (or Gods ſpeale) is that promiſe that GOD made firſte to Adam, the firſte man: when he promiſed that the womans ſéede ſhoulde breake the Serpentes heade. Gen. 3. This promiſe was renued to Abraham, when GOD ſayd to him: In thy ſéede ſhall all the Nations of the earth bee bleſſed. Gen. 22. And this Goſpell, is by the Grecians called Euangelion, which worde dooth (by interpretation) ſignifie a gladde tydinges. This Glad tydings dyd our Sauiour declare, firſt to the loſt ſhéepe of the houſe of Iſraell, both in his owne perſonne, and by the miniſterie of his Apoſtles. And at ye time of his aſcending into heauen: he gaue commaundement to thoſe Apoſtles, to declare the ſame Catholickly, (that is to ſay, generally) all the worlde ouer. For thus he ſayd vnto them then. Euntes in mundnm vniuerſum, praedicate Euangelium omni creaturae. Goe into all the world, and preach the Goſpell to euery creature. Vnderſtanding by creatures, all Nations and ſortes of men. By thys meanes, thys Goſpell or Gladde tydinges (which at the firſt was made knowne but to few,

in compariſon of all) was made knowne to the whole worlde, and was therefore called Catholicke. And when in the primitiue time of the preaching of thys Goſpell, certayne fantaſticall heades beganne to teache doctrines contrary to thys Catholick doctrine, and to drawe diſciples after them: then the Fathers that held & taught thys doctrine, called themſelues Catholicks, and thoſe other Schiſmatickes, and Heretickes.
               The firſt Romyſh Chriſtians, were right Catholicks, as appeareth by that Epiſtle that the Apoſtle Paule wrote to them, and ſo the Chriſtians of that Cittie continued many yéeres after ſaynt Paules time, as appeareth in the Hiſtories of the Church. But for the ſpace of a thouſande yéeres laſt paſt (almoſt) that Church, that hath béene, and is in Rome, hath béene, and is ſtyll, ſchiſmaticall: and therefore the name Catholick is no méete name for that Romyſhe Church. They denie the frée iuſtification by fayth, which S. Paule taught the firſt Romyſh Chryſtians, and they belee

                   Church, which you call Apoſtolick, doth, and for theſe 1000. yéeres laſt paſt (almoſte) hath doone, and ſtill pretendeth to doo, the contrary to all theſe thinges. I conclude therefor
                     •
                  , that ſhee is not Apoſtolicke, but Apoſtatate: and therefore all thynges that ſhee beléeueth, are to bée ſuſpected, and not to be receiued, till they ſhalbée throughly tryed, and founde to bée Apoſtolicke. But now you wyll growe to a concluſion, and thus you ſay.
            
            
               The Fryar.
               To be breefe. Say euery day theſe wordes. O ſweete Ieſus. &c.
            
            
               Crovvley.
               In your concluſion, wherein you are bréefe: you giue me occaſion, to be longer then willingly I would. You preſcribe your mother an order of proteſtation and prayer, which ſhee muſt vſe euery day, if ſhe hope to be accepted amongſt the Romiſh Catholicks.
               It beginneth very well, for thus ſhe muſt ſay: O ſwéete Ieſus. But in the next wordes, you teache her to flée from Ieſus, and to be at defiaunce with him. For ſhe muſt ſay thus: I doo ſtedfaſtly beléeue all that my ſonne Samuell beléeueth. Which is as much as if ſhe ſhoulde ſay thus. Farwell ſwéete Ieſus: I wil no longer depende vpon thée. For my ſwéete ſonne Samuell, hath commaunded me to depende vppon hym. I may no longer beléeue as thou haſt taught me: but I muſt, and wyll beléeue all that my ſonne Samuell beléeueth. Thou haſte taught me to beléeue, that whoſoeuer beléeueth and is baptiſed, ſhalbe ſaued. Mar. 16. But my ſonne Samuell ſaith, that except I confeſſe my ſinnes to a Prieſt, and be by him abſolued, and reconciled to the Romyſh Catholicke Churche, I ſhall bee damned both body and ſoule, and I am ſure hée woulde not ſay it, except hee dyd beléeue it. O ſwéete Ieſus, thou haſte called mee, and haſte ſayde vnto mée amongſt other, Come vnto mée all yee that laboure, and be heauy laden, and I wyll refreſhe you. Take my yoke vppon you: and learne of mée, for I am méeke and humble of harte, and you ſhall finde reſt vnto your ſoules: for my yoke is pleaſaunt, and my burden is lyghte. Mathew. 11.
               But my ſonne Samuell beléeueth, that euery man and woman muſt ſuffer for theyr owne ſinnes: and therefore hee goeth and lyeth woolwarde, hée refrayneth the eating of fleſhe, and of

al white meates, he riſeth euery night at midnight, he doth ſcourge himſelfe naked often times: yea, he gyueth himſelfe 400. ſtrypes at one time. Yea, fearing to fall into the handes of the liuing God (which is horrible) hée hath for ſaken the world (as he ſayth) and the life of a Scholler, and hath made himſelfe a Minime Fryer, chooſing rather that way to fall into the hands of GOD, then (liuing as his Father and I doo) to fall into the pawes of the deuill. His ghoſtly father hath tolde him, (and he doth beléeue it) yt though thou dooſt cal him, and offer to take the heauy burden of ſinne from him: yet it is neceſſary that he doo penaunce in hys owne perſon, & by that penaunce he do redéeme his owne ſoule. And although thou haſt bydden him bowe downe hys necke vnder thy yoke, & take thy burden vppon his backe, aſſuring him that thy yoke is eaſie, and thy burden light, and that in thus dooing he ſhall finde reſt to hys ſoule: yet if he wyll finde that reſt indéede, hee muſt of neceſſitye take the yoke and burden of S. Frauncis vppon his necke and ſhoulders, and doo penaunce all the dayes of hys life, according to the rule of S. Frauncis Order.
               O ſwéete Ieſus, beare with me, I muſt beléeue all this, for my ſonne Samuell dooth beléeue it, and hath wylled mee to ſay euery day, that I doo beléeue all that hee dooth beléeue. O ſwéete Ieſus thou haſt ſayde, Let ſuch as hath eares to heare, hearken. Math. 13. And thy holy Apoſtle Iames hath ſayde: Be ſwyft to heare. Iam. 1. And thine Apoſtle Paule ſayth, that fayth commeth by hearing. Rom. 10: But my ſonne Samuell, wylleth me to leaue my early ryſing, and goe no more to the Lectures and Sermons of Crowly, Barber, and Fielde, or of any other Proteſtants, for hee ſayth that they are the deuills Miniſters, and that the deuill of 
                     •
                  ell is the foundation of that Religion, that they doo teache. And I muſt beléeue that this is true, if I wyll beléeue all that my ſonne Samuell doth beléeue.
               But my conſcience telleth me (O ſwéete Ieſus) that thou art that Rocke on which Crowley, Barber, Fyelde, and the reſte that bée the Proteſtant Preachers doo builde: and I thynke that I doo plainely ſée, that they doo not builde vppon thée, eyther ſtraw or ſtubble, but Gold, Syluer, and ſuch other matter, that can not be conſumed by the force of the fire of Gods ſpirit, which

in hys good time wyll trye, all that men haue builded vpon thée, which art that foundation that all the builders which wyll buylde the Temple of GOD, muſt needes builde vppon, becauſe there is none other foundation to builde vppon. 1. Cor. 3.
               O ſwéete Ieſus, thou haſte commaunded mee to ſearche the Scriptures. Iob. 5. And thy holy Euangeliſt ſaynt Luke reporteth, that in Berroaea, ſuch as receiued the doctrine of the Goſpell gladly, dyd ſearche the Scriptures daily. Acts. 17. But my ſonne Samuell forbyddeth mée the vſe of the Byble in Engliſh. And hée knoweth that I vnderſtande none other language. Hys meaning therefore muſt needes bée, to forbydde that which thou hath commaunded. O ſwéete Ieſus, ſuffer mée not to be ſeduced by my ſonne Samuels flattering and hypocriticall ſpéeches. Hée teacheth mée, to beſeeche thee to bée mercifull to mée, a moſt wretched ſinner, for thy name ſake. A better leſſon then this, no man can teache.
               O ſwéete Lorde Ieſus, doo thou imprint thys leſſon in my harte, that I doo neuer forgette it. And worke thou in my hart by thy holye ſpyrite, that I may haue a ready good will, dayly to vſe it. But alas, he beléeueth that thy bleſſed Mother Mary, is able to helpe ſuch as call vppon her, and therefore, hée teacheth me to pray vnto her to helpe mée: But thou haſt taught me a leſſon contrary to that. When you pray, you ſhall ſay: O our Father which art in heauen, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy wyll be doone in earth, as it is in heauen. &c.
               
               O ſwéete Ieſus, let me neuer forgette that forme of prayer. Gyue mée grace (I beſéeche thee) to vſe it nyght and day, to craue continuallye, at the handes of thy heauenly Father, which through thee is become my heauenlye Father, all thoſe thyngs that in that forme of Prayer thou haſte taught mee to craue. Let mee not ſo hearken to my Sonne Samuell, as that following hys counſell, I ſhoulde doo contrary to thy commaundements. Bleſſed Lorde Ieſus, I doo knowe that thy bleſſed mother, is a moſt bleſſed creature. But thou, with thy Father and the holye Ghoſte, art her Creator and mine, and the Creator of all creatures. Wée muſt ſay of her, as the Prophette Eſay ſayde of Abraham, Iſaac, and Iacob▪
                  
               
               
                  
                  Abraham neuer knewe vs, Iſraell is ignoraunt of our caſe, but thou art our Father, thou art our deliuerer. Eſay. 63.
               Thinkeſt thou (oh thou blynde Fryer Iohn) that thy mother that bare thee, is ſo blinded with affection towardes thee, that ſhee wyll turne her backe vppon Chriſte Ieſus to follow thee? Thou teacheſt her to vſe daily a forme of prayer, which in the firſt words is ſwéeter then honnie, to the taſte of a faithfull Chriſtian, but in all the wordes that followe, it is full of moſt peſtilent and deadlye poyſon. She wyll none of it therefore. She wyll pray to the heauenly Father, in ſuch ſorte as Chriſt Ieſus the ſonne of God hath taught her, and not to creatures as thou dooſt exhort her. Though ſhe coulde, yet ſhe wyll not goe to ſhryft, to make confeſſyen of her ſinnes to a Prieſt. Shée knoweth who it is, againſt whome ſhée hath ſinned. To him alone ſhe wyll confeſſe all her ſecrete ſinnes. At his handes onely ſhe wyl aſke forgiuenes of her ſinnes, becauſe ſhe knoweth that he onely is able to forgiue them. And when ſhe ſhall ſinne againſt men, ſhe wyll confeſſe thoſe ſinnes to thoſe men agaynſt whom ſhe ſhall committe them. Shee will doo all that ſhée ſhall bee able to doo, in making ſatiſfaction to them. Shée wyll craue forgiuenes at their handes, and beſéeche them to pray to GOD for her, that ſhe may obtaine forgiuenes at hys handes alſo.
               The bleſſed body and bloude of our Lorde and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſte, ſhée will receiue, as often as ſhée may: but not after ſo bloudy a manner as you imagine that you doo. Shee hath learned to receiue an outwarde Sacrament into her mouth and ſtomache, and by fayth, to receyue ſpirituallie into her ſoule, the thing that is ſignified by that outwarde Sacrament. Shée knoweth, that if ſhée dwell in Chriſte, and haue Chriſt dwelling in her: ſhée dooth at the Lordes Table, receiue, eate, and drinke, the Lordes bodye and bloude, in the Sacrament exhibited to her, and to the reſte of the faithfull. But if ſhée ſhoulde intrude herſelfe into the companye of Chriſtians, not dwelling in Chriſt, neyther hauing Chriſte dwelling in her: ſhe knoweth that though ſhe ſhoulde receiue the Sacramentall breade, and drinke the Sacramentall wyne neuer ſo often, yet ſhée ſhoulde neither eate the bodye nor drinke the bloude of Chriſte, but the Sacrament of ſo excellent a thing, to her owne condemnation. August, in ſermone de Sacramentis fidelium.
               
               
                  
                  Feria. 2. Paſchae. Thys is the iudgment of ſaynt Auguſtine in hys Sermon that he made of the Sacraments of the faythfull, the ſeconde day of Eaſter.
               And (Fryer Iohn) I muſt aduiſe you to call to remembraunce that dealing of yours, when you preſumed to bée partaker of the Sacrament of the body and bloude of Chriſte, in company wyth your mother, the morrowe after you hadde béene at ſhryfte, and were (as your ſelfe haue in theſe your Letters confeſſed) reconciled to the Romiſh Catholicke Church. If Chriſte did then dwell in you: vndoubtedly, bothe Chriſt and Antichriſt may dwell together, which is knowne to bée a thing impoſſible. You were reconciled to Antichriſt, therefore hée dwelt in you, and not Chriſt. You preſumed with Iudas, to eate the Lordes breade, againſt ye Lord, as Iudas did, when he had before bounde himſelfe by promiſe (for money) to deliuer the Lorde into the handes of the high Prieſtes and Elders of the people.
               Euen ſo had you compacted with your new fréendes, and made promiſe to forſake the Proteſtants Religion (as you terme it) and to embrace the Romiſh Catholicke Religion, during the whole time of your tranſitory life. And howe durſt you then thruſt your ſelfe into our Communion the next day after you hadde made thys promiſe to your ghoſtly father, that had béene the meane and inſtrument of your reconciliation: and ſo diſſemble both wyth your newe and your olde fréendes, as a Newter, or Iacke on both ſides? But it may be that your ghoſtly Father had ſome large Commiſſion from the holy father of Rome, to diſſpence in ſuch caſes: For ſuch doo account our Sacrament, to bée but a péece of breade, and a cuppe of wyne, and that therefore, there is no danger in the receiuing of it in ſuch manner as you did then receiue it. But that diſpenſation can not helpe you: for it was Panis Domini, the Lords breade, as well to you, as that other was to Iudas. And you receiued it Contra Dominum. againſt the Lord, as Iudas did, euen to your owne condemnation, becauſe you made no difference of the Lordes body. To your mother (and to other, the faithfull that dyd at that time receiue that Sacrament) it was Panis Dominus. The breade which is the Lorde, and it did nouriſhe them to euerlaſting life, although it were to you a condemnation.
               But haſting to an ende of your exhortation, and ſo of the whole

matter, you thought méete to impart to your mother in theſe your Letters: you ſay thus, as followeth.

               If you be perſecuted, reioyce with S. Paule in your perſecutions: remembring that ſentence which our Lorde hath ſpoken, ſaying: VVhoſoeuer wyll come after me, let hym deny himſelfe, let him take vp hys Croſſe and follow me. Saint Paule ſayth, that the Paſſions and tribulations of thys world, are not worthy of that glory, which GOD wyll gyue vs. Thus I commend you to God. From our Fryery at Nigeon, a myle from Paris, the ſeauenteene day of Marche. 1586. Your ſonne, carefull for your ſoules health: Fryer Iohn Frauncis. And then you write thus in the margine.

               Crowley.
               To comfort your Mother againſt perſecution, you put her in minde of the words of our Sauiour Chriſt, in the ninth Chapter of Luke. And of the wordes of S. Paule in the 8. to the Romaines. I hope ſhée wyll remember theſe ſentences, when you ſhall come into Englande (as you ſay your hope is ſhortly to doo) and ſhall there ſette vp that Order of Bone homes, which you haue profeſſed, and bée an Inquiſitor there: that ſhee may ſtande conſtantlie to the profeſſyon of that auncient, Catholike, and Apoſtolick fayth, which ſhée hath by hearing learned, and by the aſſyſtaunce of Gods ſpirite profeſſed and practized, before, and euer ſince ſhe bare you: a babe of whom ſhée hoped to haue had ſuch ioy as naturall Parents doo naturally hope to haue in their naturall Children. But nowe that you are degenerated, and become an Apoſtata, forſaking that right Religion, wherein you were baptized and Catechized: ſhée hath iuſt cauſe to wyſh, that ſhe had neuer nouriſhed you with the milke of her breaſts (if the Lords will hadde béene ſo) but rather that her wombe hadde béene your graue. It is true as you ſay, that whoſoeuer will come after Chriſt, muſt take vppe theyr Croſſe and followe him. It is true alſo, that the paſſyons and tribulations of thys worlde, are not woorthye of that glory which GOD wyll giue vnto vs. But ſir, if your mother ſhould hearken to you, and by going to ſhrift and hearing of

maſſes, and profeſſing of Popery, pull ſuch a Croſſe vpon herſelfe, as they doo beare, which willingly and wittingly doo put thēſelues into the danger of ye iuſt Lawes of our Country: ſhe ſhould beare a heauy Croſſe indéede, but not after Chriſt. For not Chriſt, but Antichriſt calleth men and women, from their due allegiaunce to Princes, and diſpenſeth with thē for their lawfull othes of faythfull obedience, which they haue taken to be true to theyr princes. The paſſyons & tribulations that your Seminary men, and ſuch as follow them doo ſuffer, are not perſecutions, but iuſt executions, euen ſuch as GOD commaunded to be executed vpon falſe Prophets and Idolators. Deu. 13.
               If you may haue your wiſhed hope, I doubt not but you wyll put both your Father and mother, and all others that haue béene your foſterers, to their tryall: for yeeare become an hungry whelpe of that bloudie▪ Butchers curre, that ruleth in Rome, and thyrſteth after the bloude of the Engliſh Nation. But that God, that hath the hartes of all Princes in his hande, wil (I hope) worke ſo in the hart of that Noble Prince that nowe raygneth, in that noble Realme of Fraunce, or in the hart of ſome of hys ſurceſſors, that all the Romyſh rabble, ſhall by them be rowſed out of theyr dennes, as in the dayes of our noble King Henry the eight, they that then were in England were rowſed. And then that hope of yours will be at an ende.
               But ſir, what meane you by thys, that you ſay that God wyll gyue vs that glorie, whereof the paſſions and tribulations that wée ſuffer héere are not worthy. Howe ſtandeth this, with that which you haue written before, by occaſion of the wordes of our Sauiour, in the xxv. of S. Mathewe, where you ſay that the féeding of the hungry, &c. are the cauſe of that ioyfull ſentence. Come ye bleſſed of my Father. &c. For there you ſay, that thys glorye is due to thoſe and ſuch like workes, and nowe you affyrme that it is Gods gyft. God wyll giue it, ſay you. Mendacem memorem eſse oportet. A lyer muſt not bée forgetfull. You lyed before, but now you affyrme the trueth.
               For that glorye which you ſpeake of, is indéede the frée gyfte of GOD, through Ieſus Chriſte our LORDE: and canne not bée deſerued either by our working, or by our ſuffering.

And that was the meaning of the Apoſtle. Our workes, though they be neuer ſo many, neu
                     •
                  r ſo good, neuer ſo orderly doone: yet can they not be worthy of that glory. Our paſſyons and tribulations, although they be neuer ſo greate, neuer ſo vndeſerued, yet they can not bee woorthy of that glory, which GOD hath prepared for them that loue him.
               And thus you commende your Parents to GOD, in as courteous manner as you ſaluted them at the firſte. That is, euen as though they had béene ſome of your companions and not your Parents. Such is the Arrogancy of Fryer Iohn Frauncis. But yet hée is the ſonne of thoſe (ouermeane) Parents, and careful for their ſoules health. It were well, if you had a care for your owne ſoules health, which you can not haue, ſo long as you haue no care to doo any duety, either to your naturall Parents, or to your natiue Country, or to any others, to whom you doo owe duety, both by the Lawe of GOD and of nature.
               You haue renounced that obedience that GOD hath commaunded all naturall Children and Subiects to ſhewe towardes theyr naturall Parents and Princes: and you haue choſen a new obedience, and vowed to obſerue that. Your Pryor and your Subpriors in the Minimes Religion muſt be obeyed. The holye Father the Pope, muſt haue his commaundements obſerued. You may not doo that which GOD commaundeth to bée doone, except the ſame be commaunded by your holy Father the Pope, the Pryor, and your Subpriors. If the Popes holines, your father Pryor, and your Subpriors commande any thing: that you may, and muſt doo, and you may not mooue any queſtion at all, whether God haue not commaunded the contrary. Yea though you know that GOD hath forbidden the dooing of it: yet you muſt néedes doo it, for you haue vowed obedience. &c. You know that GOD hath forbidden the worſhypping of Images, and all vſe of Imagry in the exerciſe of Religion. Exo. 20. And yet you muſt néedes haue them and worſhip them, becauſe they to whome you haue vowed obedience▪ doo commaund it. Chriſt hath ſayd, Patrem nolite vocare vobis ſuper terram: vnus est enim Pater vester qui in coelis est. Call no man your Father vpon earth, for one is your Father which is in heauen. 
                     Mat.
                   23. But you muſt haue a moſt holy father, which is the Popes holines. And he muſt bée called Papa. That is Pater
