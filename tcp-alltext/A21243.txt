1558.
            
               Psal. 21.
Qui timetis dominū, laudate eū
            
            
               Psal. 65.
Qui terribilis in consilijs
super filios hominū.
         
      
      
         
            
            
            To the ghestes.
            
               THE chefe part
of your chere
is, that ye are
welcum all.
            A woord with
your fauours,
I would say, & that is this.
It is a maner after meat, no
lesse auncient then commendable,
to haue a grace to be
sayd, ear water be gyuen:
which, though it more aptly
perchaūce appertein to sum
of these Clerkes, that haue
vouchsafed to be here with
vs this day, then vnto me.
Yet forasmuch as with my
self I haue conceiued a farre
further cause of thankes giuyng

to God, then peraduenture
sum of them haue, I wil
with your pacience take the
office vpon me. And say: that
since it hath pleased Gods
mightie mercy, to haue calld
vnto his grace, our late
Quene, a Ladie that of her
owne inclinacion, wisht all
for the best, and would (I beleue)
euen so haue wrought:
wear it not that she had been
so miserably seduced, and so
pitiously abused, by certaine
euill and moste vngodly persons
of her spirituall counsaill
about her. Who first forced
her to alter religion, then
fecht in forrein powrs ouer
vs, of the late kyng here, and
that wicked vsurper ye Pope.
After that, pluct away her

lādes and reuenues, brought
her into warres, lones, and
subsidies: and ended at last
with the lamentable losse of
Callis. Suche was the thrift
of their ghostly gouernemēt,
suche was the proffites of
those prelates aduises about
her, these hath been the frutes
of their Catholik counsaill.
That what was thear
leaft of our vtter vndooyng,
but onely to be ouer run by
the Spaniard or Frenchmā?
After whiche thei bothe gaped,
and onely thus disapointed
by God.
            But since (as I said) that
it hath pleased his almighty
Maiestie, now thus to haue
calld her to his mercie (as
mooste humbly I beseche his

highnesse he haue) whearby
Quene Elizabeth our moste
gracious Sooueraign is cū
               men
to her iust enheritaunce
and kyngdom, thus to reign
ouer vs. I Prince (as ye wot
all) of no mingled blood, of
Spaniard or straunger, but
borne mere Englishe here amongst
vs, and therfore most
naturall vnto vs. Of educaciō,
brought vp and instruct
in al vertuous qualitees and
Godly learnynge, specially
(that may be moste cumfort
and ioy to vs all) in the sincere
knowlege and folowing
of Gods holly woord. Of naturall
inclinacion, so Godly
disposed as without reuenge
she paciently suffred so moch
malice and wrōges. Of wisedome

so ware, as she maie
shun the inconueniences and
follies that her sister fell in.
Of circumspection (we maie
trust) so wise and politike, as
she may straitly stay back,
the daungerous rashnes, of
those deuaunt currours that
run before lawes, and seuearly
kepe short the wicked kinde
of libertines that passe for no
lawe, but will make their belefe,
and liue as thei list. Of
mercie so gracious toward
her commōs, as her highnes
pitifully regardyng the daū
               gerous
estate of bothe body &
solle, that the Spiritualty
of this Ream, hath of late
brought thē in, may vouchsafe
to set sum Godly and
charitable order, for restraint

and reformacion of their extreme
outrages and abominacions.
            Whose Pride hath been
soche as first amoong all degrees
of men, thei knue neither
make nor felow, but
still striuyng for soueraintee
haue with might and main,
endeuoured to cast of all yoke
of obedience to their Prince,
contēding to kepe that estate
vnder them, and to sweare
them selues subiectes vnto a
Bisshop. To contemne nobilitee,
and to be the onely sooueraignes
them selues. The
callyng in and settyng vp, of
their patrone the Pope (contrary
to their naturall ligeaunce
and former othes) The
chekmate of his faithfull minister,

our coosin the Cardnall,
and the importable arrogācie
of all the residue beside,
what els hath it shewed?
            Their Auarice so insaciable,
as thei helde them not cō
               tent
so farforth miserably to
haue insensate & dudled their
Prince (alas poore woman)
as at one chop to make her
gyue away a fifty thousand
pound and better yerely, frō
the enheritaūce of her croun
vnto them, and many a thousande
after, vnto those idell
hipocrites biside: but euen at
one self and same Parliamēt
to cause her craue a subsidie,
when she had doon. In the
graūt whearof on their part,
it is worthy to be noted, the
pure honestie and great wisedome

of these men. That
whear the Lordes and Commons,
like good faithful and
true meanyng subiectes, did
freely and sinceerly, for good
will to their Prince, and relief
of the State, made their
graunt therof vnto the kyng
and Quene, her heires and
successours: Our Clergie of a
further forecast, could woork
with a caution, and graunt
it no further, then vnto the
Kyng and Quene onely (like
as vnder that tenour, was
ye oother subsidie thei passed)
Wise men I warrant you,
lads of circumspection, and
verè filii huius saeculi:
               Luke. xvi. That
as Christ saith, ar alwaies
more wise in their generacion,
then the childrē of light.

What good hart thei bare toward
their Quenes successour:
though we wear not in
their Conuocacion amoong
them, yet by this and oother,
we may gyue a good gesse.
            And yet this great profusion
of their Prince, did so
smalli serue their hūgri guts
as like storuen tikes, yt wear
neuer contēt with more then
inough, at all their collacions,
assembles, and sermons,
neuer lind yellyng and yalpyng,
in pursuit of their
pray: Restore, Restore. These
deuout deacons, nothyng regarded
how sum for long seruice
& trauail abrode, while
thei sat at home. Sum for
sheddyng his blud, in defence
of his princes cause and cuntrey,

while thei with safetie
al careles in their cabains in
luxe & leudnes, did saile in a
sure porte. Sum sellyng his
aunciēt patrimonie, for purchase
of these landes, while
thei must haue all by gift a
gods name. Thei nothing regardyng
I say, what iniurie
to thousandes, what vndoinges
to most mē, what daūger
of vprore & tumult through
out the hole reame, and what
a weakenyng to the State,
should therby arise: and then
by that meanes, what a gap
opened to the enemie, to run
in as he list, and ruin vs all,
(whiche thyng sum thynk
thei little forced for, so thei
might haue had their purpose)
that wot not I in deed,

but this wot I well: that wt 
none of these matters wear
thei mooued a whit, but still
held on their cry, Restore, Restore.
And that ye may be the
surer, thei mēt nothing more
then how to haue all, & that
with al hast. After that their
Pope, this sedicious Poule
the fourth, that now is, had
sent hither his Bulles and
his thunderbolts, for that
cause and oother, and yet little
restored (bicause the world
in deed would not so be faced
out of their liuelod) Sundrie
of our Prelates, like hardie
champions of the Churche,
stacke not a whit themselues,
to thrust Lordes out of their
landes, and picked quarels to
their lawfull possessiōs. Well

let nobilitee consider the case
as thei list, but as sum think
if Cleargie cum ones more
to be the Masters again,
thei will teach them a school
point. But how trow ye in
time, would these douty diuines
haue delt with poor
men, that grue so presumtuous,
and durst without law
be so bold with their betters?
            And (now to ye purpose afore)
though by sum men it
wear wisely told them. Why
restoryng is made now, and
ye can be content: for, from
the temporaltie those possessions
cam: & now, allthough
not so cheaply as ye had thē,
yet ar thei thither sum restored
again. Tut, tut, that
was none aunswere to them

for thei call nothyng restored,
but that is giuen them a
gods name. And then (hardely)
a good kinde of peple for
the common welth haue we
of them, that haue a capacitee
thus stil to take of vs, and
neuer to giue vs. Marie, as
nedefull may we count them
amoong vs, as amoōg gamners,
is ten and fowr for a
Christmas box, that in smal
processe of play (if the banks
be not the bigger) is like to
rob all ye boord. It was tyme
in deed for princes aforetyme
to stay them with Statutes
of Premunire & Mortmain
which they yet now (takyng
aduauntage vpon the tyme
that serued them) like the popes
true squiers, and for the

liberty of his churche (as thei
terme it) haue woon (I warraunt
you) to be set at large,
and if it wool hold. Moche adoo
God wot, haue thei made
for this restoryng, but if God
send vs ones a world, whearin
we maie mete with them
on an euen groūd, so as with
pacience and indifferencie, it
maie be quietly reasoned:
whither by lawe politike &
diuine, that tēporall possessions,
maie more aptly square
with the estate of Princes,
lordes and laifee, then with
the office of bisshops and abbots
and profession of Preesthod:
I beleue then it shall easely
be found, and fall out ful
well: that as the Princes benignitee,
maie vouchsafe thē
               
sum tithes or pensions: euen
so as for landes and temporall
possessions, thei shall
haue as mooch as thei may
be born vnto, and as our Sauiour
Christ appointed out
for them, and as his holly Appostles
had, whose successours
thei say thei be. And
whē that day cums (as with
Gods grace it may shortly ful
wel) then shall we crie as fast
for our Prince, as thei haue
doon for themselues, vpon a
better ground, & with a more
equitee Restore Restore. Thei
haue set vs a saūple, that we
must not be silent, if occasion
may serue. That if to say
trueth, thei be not better sum
oother way prouided for, so
as thei may be curteisly vnburdened

of their great cares
and study, whiche nedefully
now thei take poor solles, about
keping of their courtes,
lookyng to their fines, considering
of emprouments, harkenyng
to their best proffers,
aduisyng vpon new leaces,
scanning of old couenaunts,
consultyng vpon sum sutes
of proffit with the prince, aduise
with their learned counsaill
for matters in lawe, exchaunges
of their Lordships
and landes for the better, cō
               moditees
of fisshyngs, sales
of Woods, prouision of houshold,
storyng of pastures and
shepegates, regard to their
game in parkes, bildyng of
Palaces, amplifiyng their
sees & estates, maintenaunce

of their Churches liberties,
and sooch oother infinite of
troobles biside, whearwith
thei are now so continually
combred alas: Let vs neuer
trust after at their hādes, either
more vertuous example
of liuing, more contentacion
with their more thā inough,
more charitee to their euen
christen, looue to their cuntree,
or els any firmer obedience
to their Prince. And as
for sinceer Religiō: how may
we euer look, for to haue gods
woord truly taught vs of thē
that by meanes of their possessions,
are so tied to the
world? What a mockery is it,
bothe to God and man, that
vnder Popeholly professiō of
wilfull poouerty, Penaunce

or praier, thus to wallter &
wallow in worldly welth, of
a thre or four thousand poūd
a yere? Under semblaunce of
shepherds, with shepe hook
of siluer, and surcote of raynes,
to rule ouer all men, and
to reign as Princes? Under
name of humilitee, to liue in
luxe and excesse, of wine and
spices, and costly garments,
and train of houshold, and all
kinde of affluence biside, able
to compare, or rather excede
any Lorde in the land? That
if thei would be in dede, as
their would seem to be: Why
leaue thei their charge? Why
beare thei office of so greate
gaine and fee, and leaue
their cure vnserued? How
thynke they that they may

not be spared out of Princes
Courtes? Why will thei be
calld Lordes? Why haue thei
sooch ample possessions? Why
maintein thei a forrein Bisshops
powr aboou their own
princes, and that in her own
lād? why rob thei their prince
and empouerish their cuntree
by sendyng that gold ouer,
for their first frutes and
ootherwise to the Pope, that
is due to their Prince? And
why abide our Religious in
bowres of sooch sumpt & easment,
and so ny to good tounes?
Christ taught the young
man, that perfection was in
Vade,
               Mat. xix. 
               vende, & da, and not in
mane, acquire, accumula. why
get thei not into desertes, or
desolate places, as holly Ierom

and Polle Hermit, & diuers
oother did? That if their
deuocion to God warde, and
contempt of the world, wear
so feruent as thei make for.
            Why tary thei at home? Why
doo thei not Ire & praedicare,
hye them to Hūgarie, and toward
Turkey, or into the partes
whear Christ is contemned,
orels vnknowen? Dout
to be cared for, thei should
nede to haue none, since gods
goodnes prouideth for ye birdes
of the ayr,Mat. xvi. that neither
sowe nor reap: how mooch
the rather will he prouide for
them that doo his commaū
               dements,
and trust in hym?
Death or violence should
thei not haue cause to drede,
since (as thei well wot) no

pour can hurt them, whoom
Gods pour sheeldeth, no violēce
empair, y• Gods might defēdeth.
That if in case for our
Master Christ, & his holly
doctrine, and for the confirming
of them thei had woon
thei should be drawen to it:Ioan. x.
then like as a good shepherd
giueth his solle for his Shepes
sakes,Mat. x. and he that leeseth
his life that way for a while,
winneth his life an oother
way for euer. Euē so (O lord)
how sure is theirs all redy,
the kingdom of heauen that
suffer smart and persecucion
for rightuousnesse sake?Mat. v. But
(shall I tell you) thei ar wise
men I warraunt you, they
will tary at home & (if tyme
serue them) call for more lād,

thei haue a nerer way to heauen,
with more eas and lesse
pein, & that by many a mile.
            Now, as touchyug their
malice, that hath been so despiteful
and cankerd, that biside
their deuelish malignitee
toward all good men, thei
haue not spared opēly ī their
sermons, co slaūder and raile
at their own late naturall
Princes: that noble king Hē
               ry,
and that vertuous Kyng
Edward: callyng them heretikes,
scismatikes, or what
vile name els their rancour
could deuise. Put them quite
out of their beades biddyng
and beadrolles (whither I ly,
look in the bisshops Iniuncions)
and not so ceasyng: haue
hatefully procured, vtterly to

be defaced the toomb of the
tone, and could neuer afoord
any cost to be doon on y• toother.
To the entēt to make of
thē, either no mētiō, but slaū
               derous:
orels (if thei might)
to haue put them both quite
out of all memori. Nay, what
may we say, if thear wear amoong
them (without horrour
and trembling, alas can
I skant reherse it) that could
enter into meditacion & practise,
so farfoorth to haue prophaned
the hurtles corpses
of those sacred princes (Gods
holly anointed, the Masters,
the makers, and sooueraigns
to them all) as to haue pluct
them out of their toombes, to
haue burnt their bones? O
merciful god what impietee,

what malice matchable wt
these mens? What malignitee
cōparable with these spites
of the spirituallty?
            Their doctrine again, so
fals, so wicked, so blasphemous
against GOD and all
goodnes, and thearwith so
inconstāt, specially inducing
errour and blindenes: as thei
haue not stuck to enforce &
procure vs, to a greater obedience
vnto a forren Bisshop
(whom ones yet thei themselues
exploded, preached, &
sware out of doores) thāvnto
their own naturall Sooueraign:
to that Archapostata
the Pope (I meane) then to
their liege Prince. Forbad vs
our Bibles, and commaūded
vs beades. Pluct away our

praiers, and forced vs to talk
to God in a straunge lāgage.
Thei took gods book, his holly
testamēts out of churches,
thei wiped out his woord, &
stack vp images without caution
of idolatrie. Cōdemned
their Mariages, and taught
that hoordoom amoong thē
is more sufferable, thā sacred
matrimonie. Which doctrine
in deed, like feruēt followers
of their own laws, thei haue
stoutly expressed in their order
of liuyng. And haue bisily
taught, diligētly preached,
earnestly written, solemnly
sworne, fully and hoolly at
one tyme in those pointes:
whiche within a little while
after, as thei sawe oportunitee
to serue thē. O mercifull

               
                  〈1 page duplicate〉
               
               
               
                  〈1 page duplicate〉
               
               
God, how soon forsook thei?
Makyng no bones moste impudently,
so open, so often, to
cant, incant, outcant, discāt,
and recant: And like moste
vile curres, to turne to their
vomit. To the vtter destruction
of bothe body and solle
(in as moche as in thē lay) of
many thousand of the poor
Christen flock. Against their
own teachyng, their sincere
preachyng, their godly writyng,
their sacred othes: yea,
and that is most execrable
bothe before God and man,
against allmightie God hym
self, and his holly doctrine,
and against their own cōsciences
(if we may thynke thei
haue any conscience at all).
For as it seemes, thei haue

shewed plain sign, that thei
beleeue thear is none oother
Godhed, but their kingdoom
in this world, none oother
life after, but only this here.
            For maintenanuce yet of
this their wicked, inconstant
& recanted doctrine, O mighty
GOD, what malice is it
that thei haue not shewed?
What mischefe haue thei left
vn put in praictise? What
kinde of cruelty vnattempted?
What tyranne vnexecuted?
First, as soon as euer thei
had felt, how easy the Prince
was to be seduced by them,
and to be brought to their
lure: straight by & by, against
lawe and cōscience, the poor
maried ministers, thei put
out of their benefices, cōpeld

them to forsake cuntrie, wife
and children, draue thē to distresse
of vndooyng & beggerie,
& onely forsooth, bicause
thei wear maried: which neuertheles,
by the lawes of ye
ream was then sufferable,
and by themselues also assented
vnto: by the auncient popish
lawes permitted, & with
the lawes of God directly agreyng
(as out of saint Polle
and oother Scripture, thei
had often told vs in sermons
themselues) thei yet persecuted
them from place to place,
orels to be reconciled a Gods
name, & to recant: and confesse
them selues knaues, &
call their wiues hoores. Thā
procured thei commissiōs for
heresie, in which as thei had

pluct in diuers of nobilitee
amoōg them, for face of their
dooynges: and as thear wear
sundry biside, of wisedoom &
woorship, that by pollicy had
insinuat themselues, for mitigacion
of matters, and for
fence to their frendes: euen so
a woonder was it to see sum
oother again, of our great
Iusticers & learned men (that
would not sit out) how wickedly
and willingly thei becam
their rackers & tormentours,
and what matters by
the omnipotēcie of that commission,
thei durst enterprise
to deal withall, and wt what
corrupcion & briberie, thei
did execute thesame commissiō.
That surely it was commonly
thought (I am sory to

say it) to haue crept into fauour,
or if the bisshop had bid
them: For their partes, they
would little haue stuck to
haue made Ione Moon a
Martyr, and Iames Ellis a
Saint. But (as thei said) for
sooch a commission, thei wear
a great deel meter, then thei
that sat still. Then gat this
our Clergie Proclamacions,
vnder great paines for Bookes,
whiche as thei wear of
matter moste true & Godly,
and of doctrine sincere (yea,
and though of their oun making)
so wear thei sureliest remembred,
& soonest forbiddē.
And bicause thei would be
sure,Anno. v. Richardi. 2. ii. Henri. 4. ii. Henri. 5. yet none estate should eskape
them, thei renued those
thre catholik statutes for heresy,

that thearby if nede be,
thei might conuent all kinde
of men before them alone as
thei list. And in these matters
me thynkes I weare
mooch to blame if I did not a
little remember ye, of the catholike
seruice and pollecies
prelantine of that blessed bisshop
stout Steuē of Winchester.
Who, as his fatherhode
cōsidred, how mooch it should
be for his fame & honour at
Room, though wear it neuer
so mooch agaynst his Book
De vera obedientia, & against
his oth & his honesty at home
to haue y• hole praise to bring
in y• pope again. How mooch
it shoold be for his glorie,
though neuer so mooch vnfittyng
for his degree: to

reign and rule ouer lords, &
triumph like a tyraunt, how
mooch for his proffit & pōpe
(wherin bi his will he woold
excede all mē) though nothīg
at all for his pastorall professiō:
to haue sooch abostdaūce
of reuenewes, by landes & office
and oother fetches beside.
He brought the Queene
to that poynt that after appoyntment
of parliament
the writ her letters to shriues
for choise of good Catholiks,
a Gods name: himself biside
commendyng many, and in a
maner by name, commaunding
sum to serue for y• turne
as he thought best. Whearby
he still placed in y• hous right
many: That if any biside, wt
wisedoom & reuerēce had told

his tale frākly, after the auncient
liberty of the place, and
haply detected the mischefs
of the matters that this prelat
preferred: then was he by
and by sent for, and sought
for, and fetcht vp in post: and
sure to haue pict to hym, one
quarel or oother, whearby he
should be shopt vp for sunburnyng:
or ootherwise punisht,
that he and all oother
might haue warnyng, what
matters thei talkt in, & teach
them from thensfoorth, how
thei stick & be stiff, in pointes
with the Prelacie. Had not
this Postle mooch wrong of
the peple in Kyng Henries
dais trowe ye, that euer did
count hym & call hym a papist?
Well, he is as one said,

               Mortuus & sepultus, descendit
ad inferna. I will say the
lesse of hym. God haue mercy
of his solle, if he be in state to
be praied for. But if it had
pleased God, I would he had
liued, to haue seen this season:
that ones more at Polles
crosse to the peple, as afore
that to Kyng Henry, he
mought haue recāted again.
His Catholicalitie, was so
well skild in the feat, that I
dout not, he would haue
set sooch a sāple to the rest of
our Prelats, as thei would
neuer stick to follow a pace.
And whear, for these letters,
& stop of free speech, all contrary
to the lawes of the lād,
he was authour wt his Sooueraign
of those so fowl and

vnlike sum examples, as euer
Prince amoong vs here shewed
to her subiects, and in
deed tendyng to mooch toward
oppression & tyranny:
Euen so biside many inconueniences,
that els might
thearby arise, this might she
be sure to be one: that, The
laws that ar forced, will neuer
endure. But as for those

they or go they, he plaid his
part kindly, to bring them to
passe. And after al this, what
ment they, what ment they
may we gesse, by the forcyng
of y• late statute of Armour?
But only (as the wisest could
deciphre) bicause hauyng colour
to haue armour themselues,
vnder name of quā
               titee,

thei might take to them
as mooch as thei list. So yt if
nede wear, when thei saw
tyme, thei might strengthen
their matters hereafter, as
well wt Polles bloody sword
as thei haue doon allready
with Peters coūterfet key of
theirs. That if their prouisiō
may plainly appere, it shall
well be seen (I dare warrant)
thei ar furnisht at full: and
haue a great dele more, then
for men of the church, or likely
by thē to be kept for a good
purpose. Now then, their popely
Iniunctiōs, their homly
Homelies, who can not but
with extreme woonder, be
merueilously amased to consider,
with what impudencie
and tyrannie, thei thrust forward

their abhominable impities:
read them aduisedly,
confer them with scriptures,
and with sincere religiō, nay
with their own former teachings:
then shall ye see how
shamfully thei haue discouered
themselues, and bewraid
their own wickednes. Bye
them, bye those precious pā
               phlets
I pray, thei ar woorth
the moony, and it wear but
to look on, and laugh at their
foolish gloses, & detestable deuises.
Well, thus beginnyng
with the ministers: as for oother,
sum thei threatned, sum
thei cursed, sum thei put out
of office & liuyng, to sum procured
thei y• Princes displeasure,
to sum, banishmēt, sum
whipt thei their own hands,

sum kept they in their colehous,
sum cast thei into
prison. And thear (O GOD)
sum maimed thei with torture,
sum lamed thei with ierns,
sum famisht they with
hūger, sum burnt thei in the
hands with candell, sum pined
thei away wt ill kepyng:
And from thens again, sum
heaued thei to hangyng, sum
trapt thei with treasons, so
that none shaped free, that
thei could catch in their clouches:
if thei did but ones talk
of that doctrine, that thei before
tyme had taught them,
and woold not recant, and be
as wicked as thei. And yet to,
how vnmercifully, how cruelly,
how tyrānously delt thei
with that good & vertuous

prelat doctour Crāmer archbishop
of Canterbery? Whō
thei themselues vaūted they
made to recant, & set it out
solēnly in print, and yet soon
after (see the charitee of their
church) stack not a whit most
tyrauntly, against their own
lawes to burne hym. Wear it
mete trow ye, that after repentaunce
of their fautes,
by their own examples, they
shoold be so serued thēselues?

               But now further: for any
mā to talke of this their wickednes,
to stand by Gods

that thei before so long tyme

this forfoorth was starke heresy.
For strait, quick, & seuear

preached, sworne, & taught
them. Mercifull GOD, was
thear euer vncharitee, hate,
vngodlines, malice, crueltie,
or tyrānie, able to be cōpaard
wt this of theirs? But as thei
sawe that their market grew
great, & had not help inough
as thei woold, to cut yt throtes
of the sely shepe, so fast as
thei had procured them to be
brought to their boochery: a

and a full charitable fetch

woork had thei, and that was
this. Thei procured the shriues,
to sit present with them
at the conuiction of those,

to cōdemne for heretiks.
That as the prelate had ones
pronounced his sentence vpō

charged to see execucion of

he not tary for any warraūt

made thei a riddaūce of their

            And why, & why, I pray ye,
all these their merueilous
persecutions, cruelties, & tyrānies?
But onely (as I said)
for the self same doctrine that
thei afore had taught vs thē
               selues.
For who taught vs to
take the Pope, to be a wicked
vsurper vpō vs? Who taught
vs, that by scripture & Gods
lawe, preesthod must be subiect
vnto Princehod, and not
Princes to Preests? Who
taught vs, that it stāds moste

with Gods lawe, the Prince
to be Sooueraign of all, and
supreme hed of the church of
that land, whearof he is lord,
and not of a forrein preest or
potentate? Who taught vs,
that the same Supremitee,
stands not vpon the qualitee
or kynde of the person, but vpon
the state of Princehod?
Who taught vs, that it is no
more repugnaunt to Gods
law, vnder one hed we shoold
haue seuerall Churches of
England & Ireland, and yet
bothe as membres to the vniuersall,
& true Catholik
church of all christen, whearof
Christ is the hed: then it
was that saint Ihon in his
ApocalipsCap. primo. shoold write vnto
the Churches of Ephesus

and Smyrna, and to the rest
of the seuen Churches in
Asie? who taught vs that the
Popes pour at the best, was
no better then a Bisshops in
his own dioces? Who taught
vs that Thomas Becket was
no saint but a deuell, no true
subiect, but a false traitour,
that did disobey, & contend
with his Prince, and took
part with the Pope. And yet

blessed bisshops, ye Popes execurioners,
haue been soch as
we haue neded (if we mought)
so to pray still: I report me to
you. Who made it allwais
one chefe part of their matter
in pulpits, still to shew
vs of his intollerable arrogancie
and abuse of Princes,
of his tyranny, war, quarelling,
auarice, apostasie, simony,
sacrilege, hoordome, buggary,
sodomie, malice, pride,
poysonyngs, and all kindes
of wickednes & abhominacions
biside, so continually exercised
by hym, & all his hole
holly cōpany his Cardnalls

his dispensacions, his pardons
& bulles, wear but false
trumperie, wicked for hym

to giue, & folly for vs to receiue,
and vtterly dānable for
any to trust in? Who taught
vs, that scripture neuer made
neuer mencion of Purgatory
after this life, or if thear
wear any sooch peines: yet
wear thei not redimable by
the Popes pardons, by monkes
masses, or preests penypraiers?
Who taught vs, y• it
was metest for vs to haue y•
lawe, that we all professed,
and to haue diuine seruice in
that langage, that we best
knue? Who taught vs, that
sacraments wear euer moste
frutefully ministred in that
toong, that the peple best vnderstood?
and specially those
whearby we made any coouenaunt
or promise to God,

or receiued any cūfort of his
mercy & goodnes: as Baptim
Matrimonie, and the holly
Communiō. Who taught vs
to pluck images out of churches
for dout of idolatrie?
Who taught vs to make our
praiers, not to our Lady, or any
oother bisaints, but onely
to GOD? whose mercy by
promis was sooch as woold

best help vs. Who taught vs,

Who preached vnto vs
what parcialitee, what sacrilege
it was, in ministraciō
of the holly Sacrament, to
receiue it themselues in both
kindes, and to defraude the
laitee of the one halfe, ootherwise
then it was ordeyned,Bibite ex hoc omnes. Mat. xxvi. Ioan. vi. and against our sauiour

taught vs, that as it was a
moste Christen cumfort vnto
the woorthy receiuour: euen
so was it neither to be kept
in boxes for dout of corrupcion,
nor to be hangd vp for
woorship, for aduoiding Idolatrie?
Who the deuell so mā

& minst it amoong vs, as
not content with the old doctrine

of our aunciēt fathers:
that it was Gods body in
foorm of bread: but must wt
the mischefe, enter into fine
siftyngs, questions, & quidditees,
of substaunce, nature,
qualitee, quātitee, dimensiō,
realitee, accidence, relacion,
action, passion, and all the elenchs
I wene of Logik biside?
Who sent out their Iniunctions,
& made their visitacions
to be suer to see that
their teachings might accordingly
be coōd, as thei had bisily
taught thē? Who taught
vs all this, and ten tymes
more then I haue layser to
tell, or ye to here: and now cā
recāt it euery whit? who I sai
who, and who I pray ye? Mary
who but euē thei and thei

of their cote. Our Bisshops,
our suffragans, our doctours
our deanes, our deacons, our
parsons, our vicars, our chaplens,
our hedge preests & all,
whearof many yet aliue both
quick and queathyng. But if
thei will now (as thei can euer
full well) vnsay and forswear
ech for hymself, that
thei wear none of thē: whear
then a Gods name, becā they
in all that hole season of
scisme and wicked tyme? (as
thei terme it) Whear hid thei
their heds y• we hard not of
thē, when thei shoold rathest
haue shewed themselues, and
haue vttred their learnyng?
Whear was then their true,
their auncient, their vniuersall
& catholik doctrine? (as

thei call it) Whear was their
conscience, their conscience
alas, to suffer so many Christen
solles to be mistaught, &
led to the deuell (as thei say)
and thei to stand by, and say
neuer a woord? Whear was
then their foritude of mynde
and trooble for Christ, whear
by we might haue knowne
thei had been hizzē? How remembred
thei, or els past vpō
the promise of Christ, that he
woold acknowlege that parson
before his father in heauen,Math. 
                     •
                  
               
yt confesseth hym before
men: like as he will vtterly
deny him before his father in
heauē, yt hath denied him here
before men? whear was then
that desire to truth, constancie
of beleefe, and contemt of

the world, that still thei now
foūd, inthose poor simple solles,
that daily alas thei slue?
That sory I am, my tale is so
true, not a whit amoōg them
all. But when thei had thus
liberally preached & taught a
toside, & recanted a toother,
and amased the poor peple,
with this their moste pernicious
inconstancie, and confusion
of doctrine: then soon
after so to persecute thē, prison
them, torment them, rak
them, hak them, hang them,
and burn them? O mercifull
GOD, O heauen, O earth.
Was thear euer vncharitee
like to this of theirs? Euer
slaughter so vnnaturall, for
their own doctrine, to kill
their own cuntree mē? Euer

tyranny so cruell for the teachers,
to slea their own disciples,
for cūnyng of their own
lessōs thei gaue thē? and send
thē bothe body & solle, vtterly
to the deuell (if their tale be
now true) & giue thē no leasure,
either to learne better
of oother, nor take time with
thē to teach them better thē
selues? O terrible Godhed,
how fear thei not flies, fleas,
vermen, frogs, pestilence, plages,
serpents, venoms, water,
fire, tempests, swalloyng of
earth, ruin of houses, falshod

ar thei not troobled with the
terrible cry of the solles (as
Scripture tels them) of the
peple thei haue slain for the
woord of GOD,Apccal. vi. and for the
witnes thei bare, whiche solles

lye vnder the auter, & crie
out vnto ye Lorde with loude
voice for vengeaunce vpon

these straunge, terrible, and
hurtfull tēpests? whearby as
Gods displeasure might be
apparaunt vnto all men, euē
so his wrathe to be feared of
them chefely, as chefely deseruyng
the same?
            O how great cause haue
we again to magnifie, extolle
and hartely to acknowledge

either to despise or to dout on.

(seeming to thē sumwhat to
slacken the reines of his rule,
castyng bridell in their necks
whearby thei might at their
wills, take the bit in their
teeth, & run the race thei best
liked) can set vp a Prince,
whoom thei might abuse as
thei list. And thearby might
plainly disclose their affectiō
how little it was toward his
diuine Maiestie, how mooch
toward their own worldly estate,
their ambicion to reign
and contencion for Sooueraigntee,
their indissoluble
leag with the Papacie, their
obedience to the Pope, their
hipocriticall hartes and dissemblyng
with princes, their
contēpt of Gods woord in respect

of goods gettyng, their
extreme vncharitee their crueltie
& tyranny toward their
euen Christen, all whiche afore
tyme with countenaūce
dissembled, and contentacion
counterfet, thei coold kepe so
coouert.Gods might His immesurable
might again sooch, that (as
we see) in a momēt, can ouerturne
all their foundacions
and bildyngs, seeme thei neuer
so depely cast, & so strongly
reared: It cā call the mighty
from the seat,Luke. i. and aduaūce
thearvnto the meke: It can
regard the humblenes of his
handmaid, & cause her calld
blessed frō age to age amoōg
all naciōs. It can encline the
hart of the Prince, to harken
after his lawes, and euen in

the same to goouerne his peple.
It can make the stiff necked
to boowe, be thei neuer
so sturdy and stubborne.
            And here wt his most benign
mercy sooch,Gods mercy. as allthough
for our moste vnwoorthy demerites
(for I sai not, yt we ar
fautles) we haue been sumwhat
touched with daunger
by one meanes and mischefe
by anoother, of forrein
goouernment: with extraordinary
taxes, with war, with
sicknes, with seductiō of doctrine
and tiranny: yet his benignitee
neuer forgettyng y•
tender affection he beareth,
toward the flock of those his
shepe, that gladly here his
voyce:Luke. xi. and y• promis he made
that if we aske it shalbe giuē
               
vs, if we seke we shall finde,
if we knock it shall be opened
vnto vs.Math. xi. And will refresh all
them that cum vnto hym &
ar in pein & pressed with
burden: and hath accordynly
(as we see) thus graciously
vouchsafed ye same his mercy
vpō vs. Whiche since it hath
pleased his Maiestie so benignly
to shew vs: Let not vs
then so soon forgettyng the
same & our selues, be redy to
reuenge, & be (as thei wear)
celeres ad effundendum sanguinem.
But rather (partly
deterred by the daunger of
pein, that for our vncharitee
we may woorthily suffer and
chefely prouoked with the
example of hym, whose steps
we shoold endeuour to follow)

remembre his woordes
spokē to vs all: that take our
selues to be hizzen.Ioan. xiii. 
               I GIVE
ye a nue commaundement,
that ye loue toogither, as I
haue looued you, that ye
also looue ech oother: herein
shall all men vnderstand that
ye ar my scholers, if ye haue
looue & charitee ech toward
oother: and again how saint
Polle shews vs of hymself,i. Cor. xiii.
that if he had knowledge of
toongs, ye wear it of Aūgels,
gift of Prophecie, Science of
misteries, faith to remooue
mountains: & yet lack charitee
he is nothing at all. If he
bestow all that euer he hath
vpon the poor, yea, and yeld
his body to the fier, and yet
haue no charitee, it is vtterly

no proffit vnto hym. And
of the three diuine vertues,
faith, hope and charitee, that
charitee is chefest. That sins
for their part, thei may be
right sure (onles thei repent
them & shew sign of amendement)
thear is one that most
mightely can, and moste certeinly
will, pay them their
hire to their vtter confusion.
Euen so again on our part
great impietee & presumpciō
wear it for vs to meddle in
his office that hath said Mihi
uindictā & ego retribuam.
               Deu. xxxii. Roma. xi.
And against all conscience &
Christen charitee, to charge
thē all wt the euils of moste.
It is not vnknowen, thear
wear sum amoōg thē that beyng
right hartely sory to see

their lewd leaders vngodly
demeanours, wear in dede
rather violētly drawen, then
either did redily cum, or willingly
follow. And sūdry fled
frō them. Diuers again like
poor ignoraunt lewdlyngs,
(moste vnwityng in that thei
shoold best haue been skilde)
taught GOD wot as they
thought, & followd their conscience:
which thyng toward
sooch, take I a great cause of
commiseracion vpon them.
And as for the residue (me
thinks I see that now at earst
consideryng with them selues
how through ouer mooch
trust of their worldly wit,
theihaue so vnhappily cōfoū
               ded
ye boord, & disordered their
game, by misgidyng the paunes,

misusyng the knightes,
misrulyng the rookes, and
through the false draughts
of the bisshops, ar like to receiue
chekmate of a Queen)
thei kepe them at home, and
sigh in their celles, to thinke
vpon how mooch thei haue
begilde themselues in the reconyng,
and lamēt alas how
to late thei remember that,
Bonū est sperare i dn̄o,Psal. cxvii. quàm
sperare in pricipibus. Thei see
that we see, their world will
not last, and yt well may they
whisper in corners for eas of
their harts: but thei flok not
in assembles, for consultaciō
and counsaill. And those of
them that haue cause to cum
abrode, me thinks I sai I see,
how thei leaue of their rochets

or cloke them for rain,
put their tippets in their
purses, pluk their caps doun
afore or hood thē with hats,
and ar full sore ashamed alas
and woofully bewail them,
that euer the Deuill had so
mooch poor vpon them. And
being thus sorily beested, and
in this case of care, let vs consider
how little manhod it is
to strike at thē, that ar doun
allredy. Who cannot but rather
pitie then reuenge? And
rather regard, that as at the
best thei maie liue & amend,
and as s. Polle was (through
Gods grace) of cruell persecutours,
becum Godly teachers:
euē so at the woorst, be
thei our neighbours, our brethren,
our euē christen. Whō,

if we regard our religion, &
be as we shoold be, we ought
no lesse to looue, then our oun
selues, to wish their amendement
& not to will their
destruction. Let vs thearfore
haue in mynde, not what dedes
thei haue doon or what
thei haue deserued, but what
is our dutie and how we
woold be delt with all our selues.
Euen like also as (if I
had my desires) woold I hartely
wish the Quenes Maiestie,
to shew foorth & extend
her Princely pitie vpō them
and not to remember their euell
deseruyngs but her noble
dignitee, and how the magnificence
of a Prince is as
wel in Parcere subiectis as in
debellare superbos. Consideryng

again: how easy, how
slipper, how wretched, how
wicked it is for man to erre &
offende: and how harde, how
magnific, how princely and
diuine it is, to doo vertue &
forgiue repētaunt offenders.
How well it agreeth with
her sex, for a vertuous virgin
to be pitifull vpon her humble
subiectes. With her estate
of a Queene to be mercifull.
With her highnes profession
of a Christen Prince & no papist,
to be charitable. That
had neuer been their heinous
offences, then shoold her maiesties
mercie neuer had matter,
whearupō so Princely to
woork. And suerly me thinks
that as thear shall be found
but few amoong them, but

will be content to renounce
their vnlaufull obediēce vnto
that forrein tyraunt the
Pope▪ and can well assent in
looue of their cuntree, to afoord
their first frutes & oother
proffits again, rather to
the state of their natiue soyle
here (out of which but of late
thei wear taken) and to their
naturall Sooueraign & liege
Lady, then vnto Gods enemy
& ours the Pope. Euen so
cōceiued I a great hope, that
vpon cūfort of mercy, and for
gettyng of their fauts, thei
will redily returne to their
moother holly Churche here
amoongst vs again, cast vp
their wicked Papisticall heresies,
& forsake that scisme
and diuision frō vs, acknowleging

(as with true catholik
cōsent afore tyme thei haue)
one God, one faith, one obedience,
and one supreme hed
vnder Christ, of thesame his
church here, the hed of vs all
the Prince of this realm the
Quenes Maiestie that now
is, or her Uicegerent in that
case (if it pleas her to make any)
her highnes shall finde I
hope, thei will shewe themselues,
as redy to rēder to the
estate of the Croune, as euer
thei wear greedy to pluck frō
it, or hūgry to haue. Yea, thei
will preach I warraunt (if it
pleas her to trust them) the
pure & perfit doctrine again.
And none of likelihod, cā better
skill of the engins of the
lock, then those that know

whear thei wrinched ye wardes
of y• key. And so may her
Maiestie more reioyse vpon
the cummyng home of one of
those stray shepe, then vpon
nienty and nyne, that neuer
ran out of the flock. And pity
wear it to lose yt thus might
be saued, so that consideryng
what vse may cum of them,
ones more to try them me
thinks wear not amisse: since
in deed if thei preach well, thei
may doo mooch good, if they
preach ill thei must look to
make aunswer. and surety
is thear inough of them, for
thei can not start, and I hard
ones olde Roch Alderman of
London say, that vpon good
suerty, a man might trust a
dog with a puddyng.
            
               Now to conclude (for right
loth wear I to make ye wery
with sittyng) since it hath
pleased Gods allmighty maiestie,
thus mercifull to haue
hilde his holly hand ouer vs,
as to haue calld to his grace
the late Quene. The wicked
& vnhappy goouernment of
those spiritualls vnder whō:
begā (as afore is said) first to
allter religion, then to bryng
in a straunger Kyng, to fetch
in the Pope, to make her abase
her Royall estate, to deface
her Princely title, to
pluck away her patrimonie
of the Croun, to take it to thē
selues, to let her self lack it, to
driue her thearby into euerlastyng
lones, taxes, & subsidies,
to raise vp religions

more perfit then Christes, to
maintein with sooch wast so
many idle hypocrites. And
thei thēselues so to triumph,
and tyrānize ouer the worlde
by persecuciō of her subiects,
and slaughter of innocents:
and ended at last with forcing
her to fall out wt her neighbours,
to draw vs into war,
to neglect her peces, to contemne
calling vpō, and (with
vtter dishonour) to the losse of
her lands. And that his mercifull
goodnes again: hath
vouchsafed thus to preserue
vs frō the imminēt daunger
of distresse of vs all, and so
graciously to haue placed our
Queen that now is in her
Roiall seat ouer vs, by whō:
for her naturall birth amoōg

vs & affection vnto vs, for
her diuine disposiciō, her vertuous
educacion, her Godly
wisedoom, her Princely Maiestie,
her gracious circumspection,
affabilitee, iustice, &
mercy. We haue good cause
to conceiue an assured hope:
that as her highnes stands
greatly in the looue & fear
and fauour of almighty god:
euen so by her grace, shall we
haue Gods woord & Religiō
restored amoong vs, honourable
mariage to her highnesse
best likyng, noble issue
of her body for cumfort of vs
all, expulsion of that poisond
vicar the Deuels deputy the
Pope, auauncement of her
Roiall estate & Princely title
of her predecessours again,

resumpcion of the rights of
her Croun from the Clergy
for eas of her commons, chastisement
or chasyng away of
those idle hypocrites or els
thei returne into the christen
congregacion amoong vs again,
quenchyng of the Clergies
execrable thirst of tyranny,
reduction of them to the
knowledge of thēselues and
to a woorshipfull estate after
Gods lawe moste meetest for
them, amitee and peace with
her neighbours and frendes,
looue and obedience vnto her
at home, a gracious regimēt
ouer all estates, and a likesum
liuyng & a loouyng here
amoong vs vnder her reign.
Unto that most mighty & benign
maiestie diuine therfore

that hath so graciously, thus
wrought his mercy vpon vs.
Let vs most humbly & hartely
offer and yelde all honour,
glory, impery, thāks giuyng,
that liueth & reigneth world
without ende. And say with
Dauid:Psal. cxvi. 
               Laudate Dominum
omnes gentes, laudate eum
omnes populi. Quoniam cō
                  firmata
est super nos misericordia
eius: Et veritas domini
manet in aeternum. Gloria
PATRI & FILIO & SPIRITVI
SANCTO. Sicut erat sprincipio
et nunc & semper, & in saecula
saeculorum. Amen. God saue
the Church, the Quene, send
vs peace, and haue mercy vpō
all Christen solles. AMEN.
            
            Masters, mooch good dooit

you. I haue been the bolder
to lengthen my processe,
bicause me thought ye sat
at eas, and wear cōtent
to here me speake. I
thanke you of
your paciēce
and ye ar
ones
again all hartely
wellcum.
How
sirs giue water.
            Et veritas Domini manet in aeternum.
