            TO THE RIGHT
Worshipfull, Sir DAVID
MVRREY, Knight, speciall
Gentleman of the
Prince his Bedchamber.
            
               IT is (right Worshipfull) the common
condition of
all Christians,
howsoeuer disioyned in place,
that they are militant in
one warfare against Sathan
with his Principalities, Powers
and spirituall wickednesse,
whose stratagems are

innumerable, and the manner
of his assaults manifold:
he troubleth not all Gods children
one manner of way; for
so euery one might easily espie
wherein his strength lyeth,
but makes choise of the temptation,
as by long experience
he hath learned it may bee
most effectuall to worke vpon
our naturall disposition. Like
as on the other hand, the
Grace by which God strengtheneth
his Children to resist
him, is much more manifold;
whereby they are instructed
to vse the Armour of God,
with such variety of heauenly
wisedome, that is a wonder
to see, how by one and

the selfesame sentēce of Gods
word, at sundry hands, sundry
manner of wayes, Sathan
is confounded: & therefore
it is very needfull that
in the spirituall warfare
there should be a mutuall intelligence
among the Souldiers
of Christ, as well for discouering
of Sathans seuerall
sleights in assaulting; for the
more his policie is detected,
the better may we eschew it;
as also, for the manifestation
of GODS rich mercy in
assisting.
            For this cause haue I been
induced to communicate vnto
others, these Meditations,
as it pleased God by experience,

to communicate them
vnto me, for in the middest
of darknesse which couered
the mind, and restlesse feare
which disquieted the conscience,
the Lord made them sodainely
to breake out, like
sparkles of light, sent from
his owne Throne of Grace,
bringing with them light,
peace, and ioy, which in a moment
remoued the former
feares, and pacified the perturbations
of my troubled
soule. As they were vnto me,
so I wish they may be meanes
of comfort vnto others: but
I know that the same argument
of comfort, which hath
comforted one in temptations,

doth not alwaies comfort
another: Nay, not in the selfesame
temptation; for the
Lord will haue his praise reserued
to himselfe, that hee
onely is the God of al comfort.
It is not the word, (saith
Dauid) but God by the word
that did quicken him, Psal.
119. 9. Yea, the most comfortable
promise of the Gospell is
most terrible to the troubled
conscience, except the Lord
by it worke in the heart a
sence of his mercy: and therefore
such as want comfort,
let thē seeke it from the God
of comfort. Neuerthelesse,
that which we haue, we giue
euen as we haue receiued it;

that it may stand as a memoriall
of my thankfulnes to
God who shewed his great
mercy vpon me, when within
my selfe I had receiued the
sentence of death; and a testimonie
of my loue toward
them who are militant against
Sathan: And specially
of that Christian remembrance
I haue alway of you
in the Lord Iesus; to whose
grace I commend you, now,
and for euer.
            
               Your Worships
in the Lord Iesus,
William Cowper,
Minister at Perth.
            
         
      
      
         
            
            A RIGHT COMFORTABLE
DIAlogue,
betweene the Lord
and a troubled
SOVLE.
            
               The LORD.
               
                  O My beloued, why
fearest thou, and
art so cast downe
and disquieted within thy
selfe? dost thou well to bee
angry with my chastisements?
and why art thou
offended, that I should
make thee like to my selfe,
causing thee to walke in

that way of inward & outward
griefes, which I did
tread before thee? why refusest
thou to take vp my
crosse and follow me, and
to taste of that cup which
I dranke before thee, and
for thee?
            
            
               The SOVLE.
               
                  O Lord, giue mee of thy
Spirit, and all trouble
with thee, or for thee, shalbe
sweete vnto me: what euer
thou didst beare (O Lord) it
was for me: and if I were so
disposed as I should, then
would I be content to beare
all that thou (my God) shouldest
please to lay on me. But alas,

it is my cursed corruption
that makes me think thy
crosse my burden. Lord, therfore
vphold mee with thy
grace, that I may count thy
yoke easie, and finde ioy in
these sufferings with thee.
            
            
               The LORD.
               I Know the cause of thy
griefe and terror to bee
the cōsideration of thy
sins: but I pray thee, why
lookest thou so to thy sins,
that thou lookest not also
to my mercies? why wouldest
thou so extoll thy euill
deeds, that thou shouldest
extenuat my rich mercies;
or in any way cōpare the

one with the other? was it
for thy good deedes that
first I entered into friendship
with thee? & thinkest
thou now, that for thy euill
deeds I will vtterly forsake
thee, seeing it is among
my praises, that the worke
which I begin, I perfect it?
I like it well indeed, to see
thee grieued for the sinnes
thou hast done against me;
but I would haue thee also
comforted in the mercies
that I haue shewed thee.
Call to minde my workes
of old, and what I haue
done to thee since thou
canst remember: how cared
I for thee in thy young

and tender yeeres? Looke
backe now & see; did not
the Angel of my presence
leade thee, whē thou haddest
neither wisedome nor
strength to gouerne thy
selfe? did I not then begin
to acquaint thee with the
knowledge & feare of my
Name? canst thou denie
now, that my mercy preserued
thee from many
sins, whereunto thy nature
was prone, and ready to
haue declined? and when
thou sinnedst, with what
long patience haue I wayted
thy turning? & how louingly
haue I winked at
thy transgressions? & when

I had giuen thee grace to
repent of thy sins, and to
seeke my fauour & mercy
for the sins of thy youth,
with a melting heart, & a
mourning eie, canst thou
denie that I haue filled thy
heart with my ioyes, and
made thy toung burst out
in glorying speeches? and
why thē wilt thou not trust
in my mercies to the end?
            
            
               The SOVLE.
               
                  I Were, O Lord, most vnthankfull,
if I should not
confesse, that many a time in
the multitude of my thoughts
thy mercies haue comforted
me: but alas, I haue not answered

thy louing kindnesse:
for after many mercies receiued,
I haue sinned against
thee, contrary to my light, &
my sins are now before me,
witnessing that I am vnworthy
to taste of the sweetnesse
of thy mercy any more.
            
            
               The LORD.
               IS my mercy onely for a
day, or for a yeere? or is
it for euer & euer toward
those whom I haue made
mine in Christ Iesus? wilt
thou restraine my mercies,
and limit them within so
narrow bounds, as to think
they cannot be extended
ouer all thy transgressions?

wilt thou measure my mercies
with so narrow a span,
as to think I haue no more
to giue, then thou hast an
heart to receiue? Is it not
among my praises, that I
am able to doe exceeding
abundantly aboue all that
my Children can aske or
think of me? Knowest thou
not, that as the Heauens
are aboue the Earth, so my
thoughts are aboue thine?
hast thou not considered
that my mercy is aboue all
my workes? how much
more then is it aboue thee,
who art nothing in comparison
of my works? and
if it bee aboue thee, how

much more aboue all that
thou canst do? why thē wilt
thou match thy sins with
my mercies? If require
such mercy in my childrē,
that I will haue one of
them to forgiue another,
not onely seuen times, but
seuenty times seuen times:
what pitty and compassion
and readinesse to forgiue
is in my selfe?
               Therefore, my beloued,
despaire not for the multitude
of thy sins; but be cō
                  forted
with my promises
of mercy: I haue made
them without any exception
of time; For, at what
time soeuer a sinner doth repent

him of his sins, I haue
promised to put away his
wickednes out of my remembrance.
I haue made them
without exception of sins;
for, albeit your sins were as
skarlet, they shall be made as
white as snow. I haue made
them without exception
of persons; for, whosoeuer
shal depart from his wicked
waies & turne to me, I shall
receiue him. Let this threefold
vniuersality of my
promises sustaine thee,
that thy infidelitie contract
not my mercies into
narrower bounds then I
haue extended them.
            
            
               
               The SOVLE.
               BE mercifull (O Lord) to
my infidelity: I beleeue
in part, Lord, helpe my vnbeliefe,
stablish & confirme
my vnstable heart with thy
good and holy spirit. My conscience
doth in such sort condemne
mee, that I stand in
feare of thy iustice; for thou
art greater then the conscience,
& wilt much more condemne
me, if thou dost enter
into iudgement with me.
            
            
               The LORD.
               O My beloued, consider
that the cause of thy
present vnquietnes, is, because

with the one eye,
thou lookest to thy sins, &
my Fathers iustice: & with
the other lookest not to
me; in whome his iustice is
satisfied, and thy sins punished
already. Tell me (I
pray thee) thinkest thou to
get in thy selfe, and the holines
of thy dispositiō, that
which shall exempt thee
from the feare of his Iustice?
Or art thou content
to seeke it in me? If in thy
selfe thou seekest it, remember
what thou art doing:
wilt thou haue the
Lord bound and obliged
to thee? wilt thou be thine
own Sauiour? or shall it be

sayd▪ his mercy saued thee
not? if no miserie were in
thee, whereupon should
his mercy be manifested?
and if thy disposition in
the earth were such as it
should be, then what remaineth,
but that the prais
of his mercy should fall to
the ground? turne thee
therefore to mee, and
seeke thy life in mee.
               If thou wilt know what is
thine: thou art a sinner; let
my praise bee reserued to
my selfe, I am thy Sauiour.
Esteemest thou that my
wounds are ineffectuall?
or that there is no force in
my sufferings? countest

thou thy sinnes so deadly,
that my merit and vertue
cannot cure them? Will any
Phisicion powre out a
rare oyntment, either
where no need is; or else,
where it cannot profit? and
thinkest thou, that my Father
would haue my bloud
to be shed in vaine? If his
iustice terrifie thee, remē
                  ber
his iustice was satisfied
in mee, and that he pronounceth
this sentence
himselfe, This is my wel-beloued
Son, in whom I am well
pleased. I came into the
world, not to call the righteous,
but sinners to repentance.
Tarry not from

mee because thou art a sinner,
but for that cause
come to mee, and I will
refresh thee.
            
            
               The SOVLE.
               
                  O Lord, I know that there
is a clensing and reconciling
vertue in thy bloud;
that life is in thy death: but
still I feare, my sins deserue
thou shouldest neither apply
thy vertue nor thy merit to
me: for, alas, I find that yet
the old man is strong and
liuely in mee: and that yet
the motions of sinne haue
power in mee, to bring
foorth fruite vnto death.
            
            
               
               The LORD.
               BE not, I pray thee, iniurious
to the worke
of my Grace in thee;
complaine not so of thy
corruption, but that thou
maist giue vnto mee mine
own praise. Canst thou deny
but that thou hast felt
my power working in thy
Soule? Haue I not sprinkled
thy conscience many
times with the pacifying
bloud of Christ; frō which
hath flowed to thee such a
witnessing of good things;
such a sense of mercy, as
for the time, hath filled
thy heart with ioy, and thy

mouth with song of
praise? Haue I not sometime
stirred thee vp in
great feruencie, to call on
the Name of the Lord?
Haue I not made thee to
giue Christs name a publike
testimonie, with thine
owne disaduantage? and
how oft hath thine heart
been effectually moued at
the hearing of my word, in
such sort, that it hath
wrought in thee an holy
remorse, & an inward contrition
for thy sins, which
hath broken out into
teares? haue I not made
thee a wrestler against thy
inordinate lusts? haue I

not giuen thee strength
many a time to stand against
Sathans temptations,
whereas if I had left
thee to thy selfe, how oftē
haddest thou bin made
a prey to thine enemie?
               Remembrest thou not
that the Tempter hath assaulted
thee, but I haue
with-drawne the occasion
of sin? and when the occasion
serued, did not I restraine
and hold back the
Tempter? 
                     〈◊〉
                  , when both
the Tempter and occasion
were present, haue I not
filled thy heart with the
feare & loue of my name,
and so kept thee from sinning

against me? & wheras
many times of thy weaknes
thou hast offended,
did I not with a melting
heart & mourning eye,
raise thee againe, and renew
my former familiarity
with thee; so that thou
canst neuer say, from the
first houre that I begun to
renew thee, that I suffered
thee to lie in thy sin, as I
haue done others that are
strangers from my grace?
And many moe notable
effects of my working in
thee thou canst not deny.
               Are not these the vndoubted
tokens of my
Grace in thee? will Nature

doe such things? mayest
thou not feele by these,
that I haue begun to apply
to thee Christs merit
for the remission of thy
sin, and Christs vertue for
quickening thee to a new
life? Therefore think of thy
selfe as basely as thou wilt,
but let the worke of my
grace be esteemed of thee
according to the excellencie
of it, be humble & cast
downe when thou lookest
to thine owne corruption;
I finde no fault with thee,
but I reioyce, & am glad
at the new Workmanship
which I haue begunne in
thee. Indeed, if there were

nothing in thee, but that
which thou hast of nature,
thy estate were miserable:
but seeing thou seest a new
workmanship in thee, be
comforted: art thou so in
darknesse, that there is no
light in thee? or doth sin
so possesse thee, that beside
it, also there is not in
thee a will to do good, &
a loue to righteousnesse? If
thou saist thou hast no sin
in thee, thou art a lier: and
if thou saist that there is no
other thing in thee but sin,
thou art also a lier. And
thinkest thou, that seeing I
haue begunne to translate
thee from darknes into my

light, and to make thee a
new Creature; thinkest
thou that I will leaue thee,
vntil I haue done my work
in thee? Therefore, my beloued,
giue not such eare
to Sathan, or thine owne
corruption, as to take their
testimonie against me, or
to make thee thinke that
my pledges which I haue
giuen thee, are not worthy
of credit, that by thē thou
shouldest be assured of
mercy.
            
            
               The SOVLE.
               
                  I Cannot deny, O Lord, but
that many times I haue
felt the sweetnes of thy heauenly

consolations, which
haue greatly reioyced my
Soule. But alas, my griefe is
so much the greater, that by
mine owne default I should
now be depriued of them: for
I haue grieued thy holy Spirit:
yea, I haue done what I
could to quench him: & therfore
it is that the Comforter,
who was wont to refresh my
soule, is away, nor can I feele
his presēce with me as before.
            
            
               The LORD.
               BEcause I am not changed,
therefore is it that
ye, O Sons of Iacob, are not
consumed. Many indeed
are the changes whereunto

ye are subiect, but I remaine
the same, & there is
no shaddow of alteration
with me, I am. 1. 17. Be not
therefore afrayd (O my
Wel-beloued) neyther
esteeme thy selfe to be reiected
of me, albeit that
sometime I hide my face
from thee; al my wayes are
mercy and truth to mine.
It is for thee, that sometimes
I go from thee; and
it is for thee, that againe I
returne vnto thee: for if I
come, it is for thy consolation,
that continuall heauines,
through thy manifold
temptations, should not
oppresse thee. How oft

hast thou found this, when
thou wert sicke of loue, I
haue strengthened thee
with the Flagons of my
Wine, & comforted thee
with my Apples? My fruit
hath beene sweete in thy
mouth, & I haue put my
left hand vnder thy head,
and with my right hand I
haue embraced thee, Cā. 2.
               But lest the greatnesse
of my consolations should
exalt thee to disdaine thy
brother, and offend me, by
imputing that to thine
owne disposition, which
thou hast of my dispensation:
I haue againe withdrawne
these glorious feelings

from thee: giue me
the praise that I know best
what is expediēt for thee.
Had my Seruant St. Paul
need to be humbled with
the buffets of Sathan, lest
he should haue been exalted
out of measure by the
greatnes of his reuelations,
& hast not thou need
that by thy inward exercises
I should hold thee
humble? If my comforts
were alwayes present with
thee, thou wouldest thinke
thy heauen & permanent
City were on the earth, &
so cease to enquire for a
better to come: thou wouldest
take the place of thy

banishment for thy home;
and the earnest for the
principall summe which I
haue promised thee. Consider
this wisely with thy
selfe, that albeit I laugh
not alike on thee at all
times, & fil thee not alway
with my ioyes, yet I alwaies
loue thee: for whom
I loue, I loue vnto the end.
If I close the dore of my
Chamber vpon thee, it is
not to hold thee out, but
to learne thee to knock. If
I couer my selfe with many
vailes, that thou canst
not see a glance of my louing
countenance, it is
onely to stirre thee vp to

seeke me: & if sometime I
seeme to goe from thee, it
is to prouoke thee to follow
me, that thou mayest
make haste from the earth
to heauen, where thou
shalt inioy me without intermission.
Was Ioseph so
wise, as to conceale his
tender affection from his
brethren, till he brought
thē to an humble acknowledging
of their sin? & was
he againe so louing, that
when hee saw them humbled,
his affection was inflamed,
& compelled him
to reueale himselfe vnto
them? & thinkest thou that
I am lesse wise and louing

in dealing with mine?
               I gaue at the first, sharpe
answeres to the petitions
of that Woman of Canaan▪
                  
& so will I sometimes
seeme to deale roughly
with those whome I loue,
and to be angry euen at
their prayers; but in the
end I will make my loue
manifest to them, and
with my endlesse mercies
embrace them.
            
            
               The SOVLE.
               SVffer me yet once againe
(Lord) to speake vnto
thee, that thou maist answere
me, and I shall complaine no
more. If we saw that such

were our disposition as thy
holy word doth require in
vs, then should thy comforts
reioyce vs: but alas, how far
am I from that which I
should be? My strength is
enfeebled, therfore do my inordinate
affections oft-times
ouercharge me. If I turne me
to pray, I cannot for the
hardnesse of my heart: the
contrite spirit, the melting
heart, the mourning eie, is
gone from me: If I seeke comfort
in thy word, I finde it
not, I am troubled also with
doubtings, armies of feares
and sorrowes are against me,
& all through weaknes of
my Faith: for partly for wāt

of that light that should informe
me, my infidelity abuseth
me, to think that thy visitations
come from thine
anger, & causeth me to answere
the errours of my conscience,
as if they were iust
accusations, and partly for
want of that apprehending
and applying vertue that is
in Faith, I am spoyled of the
comfort that thy word hath
offered vnto me: Therefore,
O Lord, haue pittie on the
desolate state of my soule.
            
            
               The LORD.
               LEt not (my beloued)
the consideration of
thy wants, defects, and imperfections

discourage
thee: remember that the
measure of Grace which
I haue giuen to my Saints
vpon earth, I haue called
it an earnest-penny, & the
first fruits of the Spirit, to
tell them, that what euer
grace they haue gotten, it
is nothing in comparison
of that which they wil get.
Seeke not therefore that
in the earth, which I haue
resolued to giue thee no
wayes, till thou dost come
to heauen: thy blessednes
in this life stands not in a
sacietie and full inioying
of that which thou wouldest
haue, but in an hungring

and thirsting for it.
If I had pronounced them
blessed that are now satisfied
with righteousnesse,
thē thy wants might most
iustly haue discouraged
thee; but I called them
blessed that hunger. If
therefore thou dost follow
after sanctification, & art
weary of the seruitude of
thy sin; If thou doest seeke
comfort in my Word, &
canst finde none of these at
the first, as thou wouldest;
yet remember I haue promised
to fulfill the desires
of them that feare mee.
               If it grieue thee, that
thou canst not pray at all

times alike, remember
that my Children are ofttimes
euill Iudges of thē
                  selues,
and that their estate
is not alway to be measured
according to their feeling,
for many prayers may
be made in them to me by
my Spirit, with sighs and
sobs, which they thēselues
are not able to expresse,
yet are knowne to me, and
are like loude crying voyces,
which I cannot but
answere.
            
            
               The SOVLE.
               
                  O My Soule, content thee
with the Lords dispensation,
and doubt not, but all

thy wants and holy desires
shall once be satisfied: remember
how carefull thy Sauiour
was of those people that
followed him. I haue compassion
(saith he) on this
people, because they haue
continued with me already
three dayes, and haue
nothing to eate: I will not
let them depart fasting,
lest they faint in the way.
O most sweete and comfortable
speeches! they seeke not
from him, and he is carefull
to giue them. If he was so
carefull to satisfie their bodily
necessities, will he neglect
the spirituall necessities of
his owne? They followed him

three dayes, and he counteth
it a long time; they are to goe
from him, and hee feareth
lest they faint. O my distrustfull
Soule, wilt thou
once learne to trust in the
mercy of thy God assuredly?
will he not saciate thee, who
seekes him? will he not answere
thee, who cries vnto
him? will he not care for thee
who hast waited vpon him,
not three dayes, but many
yeeres? & will he let thee
faint in following him, who
would not let thē faint, who
were to go from him? O sweet
Sauiour, happy are they who
trust in thee. (Lord) therefore
increase my faith in

thee, that nothing be able euer
to sunder me from thee.
            
            
               The LORD.
               AS for the weaknes of
thy Faith, which I see
is the ground of all thy
trouble, it proceedeth either
from the want of
knowledge, or else from
the want of application. It
is indeede a speciall benefit
to haue the minde enlightened
with true light.
Seeke therefore my light
to shine vnto thee by continuall
prayer and searching
the Scriptures, that
thou be not troubled with
the error of Conscience,

as if it were a iust accusation.
I haue set conscience
indeed to be a warner vnto
thee; but then shalt thou
take heed to her warnings,
when they are warranted
by my word. If the error of
thy consciēce terrifie thee
in any thing, and make
thee think that thy crosses
and visitations do come
from mine anger, go and
informe conscience better
by the Word; remember
whom I chastise, I loue: &
when I chastise thee, I am
not seeking a satisfaction
to my iustice: what maruell
such thoughts disquiet
many? Consider, I pray

thee, that notable promise
of mine, made to my seruant
Dauid, and in him to
all the rest of my Saints. If
they breake my statutes, I
will visite their transgressions
with my rods, yet my louing
kindnesse will I not take
from them, neither alter my
Couenant.
               
            
            
               The SOVLE.
               
                  O Word full of comfort!
my Soule, forget it neuer,
that euen when his rods
are layd on thee, yet his louing
kindnesse is not taken
from thee; and though thy
transgressions be many, yet
will hee not alter his Couenant

with thee: remember
it (I say) that in thy trouble
thou giue no more place to
these misconceptions of Gods
working with thee. As godly
Iob thought in his trouble,
that the Lord was pursuing
him for his sins, and making
him to possesse the iniquitie
of his youth, which as yet appeares
by the course of that
Historie, was not the Lords
intention: so haue I thought
many times, that the heauie
hand of the Lord laid on me,
had proceeded from his
wrath, as if hee had shut vp
his tender mercie in displeasure
from me for euer
but (Lord) let thy light abide

with me, that I sinne no
more with such distrustfull
motions against thee: and
now (Lord) speake on yet further
to thy Seruant, for thy
comforts haue reioyced my
Soule
            
            
               The LORD.
               NOw concerning the
weaknesse of thy faith
in the apprehension and
the application of my promises:
remember that I
am he who will not breake
the bruised Reede, nor
quench the smoking flaxe:
what smaller thing is there
then a graine of mustardseed?
albeit the measure

of thy faith were no more,
yet haue I not excluded it
from the participation of
my promises.
               A louing Father will delight
to be holden by the
hand of his tender Child;
and knowest thou not, that
as a father spareth his son,
so will the Lord spare thē
that feare him? hast thou
not read, that although
the faith of my seruant Iacob
was very weak, as thou
maist perceiue by the
great feare he conceiued
of Esau, yet his weak faith
was able to hold me till I
blessed him? Be not therefore
discouraged; for albeit

thou canst not lay hold
on me with the hand of
strong faith, if thou canst
but touch the hem of my
garment with thy finger,
thou shalt draw vertue out
of me. Consider also with
thy selfe, that the Faith of
my children is neuer greater,
then when their feeling
is weakest, and least
perceiued. It is easie for euery
one to beleeue in the
middest of glorious feelings,
and vnspeakeable
ioyes; but when a man can
feele no sensible comfort
in mee, and yet beleeueth
in mee, and waiteth on me
for comfort, certainely the

Faith of that man is great:
and such was the Faith of
my seruant, who in his
greatest trouble gaue mee
this answere, Albeit thou
wouldest slay me, O Lord,
yet both against sence &
feeling will I trust in thee.
And did not also that woman
of Canaan with inuincible
Faith cleaue to
my mercy, euen then,
when she had no feeling
of mercy, and I gaue her
no fauourable answer? for
which in the end I called
her faith, a great Faith.
            
            
               
               The SOVLE.
               
                  O My Sauiour, thou art
the strength whereby
I stand in temptation: cursed
be he that would make my
Soule to conceiue wrongfully
of thee. Be mercifull, O Lord,
vnto me, and neuer let the
malice of mine enemie preuayle
ouer me. Sweete Iesus,
keepe the heart, that through
thine own Grace would faine
keep thee: and now, my Soule,
remember that this is but
the time of fighting; the
time of triumphing will
come: why then shall the continuance
of these restlesse assaults
disquiet thee? If thou

haddest neuer beene victorious
but ence in all thy lifetime;
yet what mercie had it
beene, that the Lord in the
middest of the battaile,
should make thee to triumph?
but thou canst not deny, that
many ioyfull victories now
and before, hath the Lord
giuen thee.
               Therefore now, my Soule,
reioyce and returne to thy
former rest: For the Lord
hath been beneficiall to thee,
and account thou euery one
of these temporall victories
a pledge to thee of that full
and finall victorie that once
thou shalt enioy ouer all thine
enemies, when the God of

peace shall tread downe Sathan
vnder thy feete.
               The SOVLE reioyceth in the LORD
               
                  O Lord, if such comfort
be in thy crosse, what
is in thy Crowne? and if
thou dost giue vs such ioy,
when thou takest vs into
thy hand to correct vs with
thy rods Lord: what wilt thou
make vs to finde, when thou
shalt imbrace vs in thy
armes, to kisse vs with the
kisses of thy mouth? Oh that
these feelings might for euer
abide with me: what

trouble would not be easie,
where thy comforts are present?
Surely, O Lord, all
trouble vanisheth, so soone as
thou dost beginne to glance
vpon my soule. Therefore
O my Loue, my light, my life,
my ioy, my crowne, my glory,
my strength, my helpe
in the time of neede, stand
thou on my side, and I will
not feare what my enemy can
doe to me. O happie time that
euer I know thee. Blessed
be the name of the Lord for
euermore.
               
                  
The SOVLE doth triumph ouer Sathan.
               
                  O Enemy Sathan, albeit
thine enmity
be troublesome vnto
mee: yet I thanke my
God through Iesus Christ,
that thou art against mee,
and that he hath put mee
in his warr-fare to fight
against thee.
               When I consider, that in
Paradise the Lord proclaimed
irreconciliable emnitie
betweene thee and my
blessed Sauiour, the seede
of the woman, Christ Iesus,

I account my hope happy,
that thou art against
mee: and that grace is giuen
vnto mee to fight against
thee: for thereby I
know that I am none of
thine, but that I doe stand
on that side, whereof Christ
is the Captaine, all his
Saints are Souldiers, and
the victorie is most certaine
               O deceitfull Serpent!
if I haue found such errour
arising of those sinnes, which
foolishly I did by thy intisements:
what should I haue
found, if I had followed thee
in all the rest, from the
which, the LORDS preuenting

mercies did keepe
mee? I haue learned by experience,
that thou art a
faithlesse Traitor; thou dost
tempt a man to sinne, and
for the same sinnes, which he
did by thy instigation, thou
art the first that doth accuse
him.
               The Lord confirme this
good purpose of my heart,
that I neuer harken any
more to thy lying words,
and suffer not my Soule to
bee circumuented with thy
deceitfull snares. And as
for the worke of my saluation,
seeing it is a worke that
my GOD will worke in
despite of thee, wherefore

shall I regard thy testimonie?
Thou didst put it in
question to my Sauiour, whether
or no he was the Sonne
of GOD: and what maruell,
if thou darest say to
his Children, that they are
none of his? Is there any
truth so vndoubted, but thou
darest deny it at any
time? why therefore shall
I enter into disputing with
thee any more? My saluation
standeth neither in thy
questioning, nor in any answering,
but vpon the Lords
vnchangeable decree of Election.
               If thou shouldest speake
for mee, yet should I not bee

the better; neyther if thou
speake against me, am I the
worse. When thou didst confesse
that Iesus was the
Sonne of GOD, hee rebuked
thee, and thought it
no honour to him to haue thy
testimonie. When thou
didst cry out, that Paul and
Silas were the seruants of
the most high GOD, albeit
thou spakest the truth, yet
did thy not accept of thy
testimonie: so although
thou wouldest say to mee, that
I were the elect Child of
GOD, shall I thinke my
selfe the surer for that?
and if on the contra
                     ••
                   thou
doest denie it, a
                     ••
                   therefore

the more vnsure of saluation?
Speake what thou
wilt; thou art alwaies alike
thy selfe, thou hast beene
a lyar from the beginning.
Cursed of the LORD art
thou in all thy wayes, and
with all thy confederats: Cursed
are they that are in
friendship with thee: and
blessed for euer be the Lord,
who hath deliuered me from
thy deceit and tyranny.
            
            
               
               The Conclusion of the
Dialogue.
               BLessed be thou (O
LORD) for that it
hath pleased thee
to visit the base estate of
thy seruant, to succour
mee in my distresse, and
to comfort me with thy
mercies: LORD, euermore
feede me with this
Manna, and refresh mee
with the Springs of the
Water of Life. Shew
at all times some signe of
thy mercy on mee, that
mine enemie Sathan, who

laboureth to disquiet mee,
may be ashamed, because
thou art with mee to succour
mee.
            
            
               A comfortable Meditation.
               IF yee will marke and
consider, yee shall find
that the Children of
God, in all their temptations,
are not so much doers
with their will, as sufferers
against their will.
This Cogitation comming
to my minde, suddenly
comfort did spring
in the midst of trouble,

God giuing me Grace to
vnderstand, that these
motions wherewith I am
troubled, were not so
much actions done by
mee: for in truth, neither
do I like or allow of them,
but as spiritual oppressions
of mine enemie, who
still warreth against me,
sometimes with armies of
feares; sometimes with
armies of doubtings; and
sometimes with bandes
of vncleane and wandring
motions; and sometimes
with troopes of worldly
cares making inuasion
vpon my Soule, and labouring
to quench that

sparke of spirituall Life,
which the LORD had
begunne in mee: therefore
answere for mee (O
Lord) for I suffer violence.
My enemie would
oppresse mee, but Lord,
my hope for euer is in
thee: succour mee with
thy strength and I shall
liue: and Lord, impute
not to me any of those sinfull
motions, which my enemie
raiseth in me against
my Soule.
               Consider this wisely,
O my Soule, and remember
it: GOD that
hath entred thee into
this warfare, and is thy

spectator and helper,
will neuer reckon vp to
thee Sathans deedes for
thine: and learne thou
wisely how to distinguish
them, and faint not for
them, but comfort thy
selfe as long as thou
art able to stand to thy
protestation, that thou
doest suffer violence in
them, and canst say with
the Apostle: This is not
I, but sinne which dwelleth,
in mee. O LORD,
deliuer me from the rage
of this spirituall tyranny.
Many a time haue I
looked to haue beene
swallowed; vp but thou

hast sustained mee. Blessed
bee my God for euer,
and the LORD bee my
strength to the end.
            
            
               A Prayer.
               O Lord, how can it
be possible, that
my Soule can
liue here in this absence
from thee? or walke in the
middest of these continuall
snares, or stand against
these raging temptations,
except it please thee now
and then to shew thy face
vnto me? Iosephs state in
prison was not so heauy as

mine; his temptations in
Potiphers house were not
so continuall as mine are.
And Daniels feare in the
midst of Lions, was no
greater then mine, who euery
day tastes of a thousand
deaths. Ieremy in his
darke dungeon was not
vexed with such horrors
as daily gather themselues
against me. The only comfort
of my Soule is in thy
mercies: thou wert with
Ioseph, and therefore the
prison was more pleasant
to him then Potiphers Palace:
thou wert with Daniel,
and therefore the raging
Lyons were peaceable to

him. Lord, bee with mee,
and increase thy strength
in my soule and I shal liue.
Though the time be not
yet come, wherein I shall
appeare in thy presence
and see thee; yet Lord, let
me haue in this land of
my Pilgrimage those glā
                  ces
of thy sweete and louing
countenance, that
may sustaine me; for thou
Lord art able to let me see
as much ioy in thy sweete
face in one hower, as may
sustaine me for euer: and
without this sight, how
can my Faith but faile, my
Hope but houer, and my
Life but languish? therefore

O Lord, hide not thy
face from my Soule for euer,
but as thou doest acquaint
mee with troubles,
so let me see at all
times, that as my sufferings
do abound in me, so
my consolations may abound
through Christ Iesus.
I know, thou alwaies
beholdest mee in mercy;
but Lord, let me see that
thou lookest vpon me,
that I may feele thy
mercies sweete
vnto my soule,
Amen.
               
            
         
         FINIS,
