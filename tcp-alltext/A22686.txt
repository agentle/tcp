and folowe ſo nighe, that it can be
no nigher, and as it were at the very
heles, yet it is neceſſary, that al

by a certaine cogitation or
myndynge of the thinge beleued
goynge before, although, beleif is
nothinge elles but the agremente

                        〈◊〉
                      beleue, vnto that thynge
whiche is thought on. For euerye
man, which doth think on a thing
doth not ſtreight way beleue that
thing, wheron he thinketh: for many
men do thinke on ſome thinges

whiche they wolde not beleue, but
he, whiche doth beleue, doth fyrſte
thinke, and in thinkinge beleueth,
and beleuinge thinketh. Wherefore,
The concluſion of hys argument, as touchynge that poynte of
our religion, whereof the Apoſtell
ſpeaketh, yf we be not ſufficient to
thinke anye thinge, as of oure
owne ſelues, but that oure ſufficiencye
is of GOD, truelye we
are not able to beleue anye thinge
of our ſelfe, as of our ſelfe, whiche
thing can not be without the thought,
but our ſufficiency, by the whiche,
we begyn to beleue, is of God▪
Wherfore, as no man is ſufficient
and able of him ſelfe, eyther to begynne,
or to ende any good worke,
as theſe our brethren do acknowledge
to be true (as their own writynges
do declare) whereby in euery
good worke, both in the begynnynge,
and ending, our ablenes is

of God, euen ſo, no man is able of
hym ſelfe, ether to begyn to beleue,
or to continue therin, but all that,
which we do, is of god. For faith,
if it be not fyrſt thoughte on, and
hadde in mynde, it is nothynge,
and we are not able to thinke anye
thynge of oure ſelues, as of oure
ſelues, but that whyche we doo, &
are able for to doo, is of god. Wel
beloued brethren,A preparation to an other argument prouīg by 
                        •
                     ge promyſe of god that faythe is y• worke of god. we muſt beware
and take good heede, that no man
doth extol him ſelfe againſte god,
which is, when he dothe ſaye, that
he him ſelfe doth that thinge, whiche
god promyſed for to do. Was
not the faith of the gentyls, promiſed
vnto Abraham, and he, geuing
the glory & prayſe therof vnto god
beleued ſtrongly, becauſe he knew
that he, which promiſed, was able
to do, & performe yt thing which he

promyſed? Th
                     •
                  n it is he, whiche
doth worke,Roman, 4▪
                   and maketh the fayth
of the gentyls, beynge able to doo
that thyng, whiche he promyſed.
If god therfore doth worke oure
fayth, workynge after a ſtraunge
and marueylouſe faſhyon in oure
hartes, that we ſhould beleue: is it
to be feared leaſt he is not able to
do the whole worke, & therfore mā
ſhuld vyndicate and chalenge vnto
him ſelfe, the firſte parte, or the
begynnynge of faythe, that therby
he might deſerue to receiue of him
againe for that begynnynge ſake,
ſo muche as remayneth behynde
vnperformed▪ I pray you ſe, whyther
they do meane any other thīg
in thus ſayenge and doynge, than
that the grace of god, one waye or
other, ſhoulde be gyuen to vs, for
that we haue deſerued it: and ſothe
grace of god ſhoulde not be grace.

For after this maner, it is gyuen
to vs as a thinge of dewty, whiche
is dew vnto vs, and not as a fre
gyft, for by that reaſō the beleuer
ſhold deſerue of god, that he ſhold
encreaſe hys fayth, ſo that the encreaſſe
of his faythe ſholde be nothing
ells but the rewarde of hys
fayth, which was fyrſte beg
                     •
                  ne in

mark that when they ſay, & ſpeake
theſe wordes, that they do take it
to be a rewarde gyuen of dewty to
them, which do beleue, for ther deſeruinge,
& not of grace. But wherfore
theye do not attrybute, and
gyue al the whol vnto man (for ſomuche
as he coulde begynne to do
the thing of hym ſelfe, whiche he
had not before, that he myght alſo
go thorow with al, and make an
end therof, lykwyſe of hym ſelf, as
he dyd begy

fayth, which is the begynning
of all godlynes, is declared to be y•

teacheth vs, whiche ſaith: he hath
reparted, and geuen to euery man

the pour to doo well, by the

And by this reaſon, which I dyd,

ſpokē of me. And in an other place
I ſayde, Of whom he taketh mercy,
he maketh hym to worke wel, &
whome he doth obdurat, and harden,
hym he doth relinquiſh & leue,
that he can worke nothinge but y•
which is euyl. Yet, that mercy is
attributed & aſcribed to the meryt
of fayth preceding, & this obduration,
or hardenyng, vnto infidelite
& impitie which precedyd. Whiche
thīg is trew, it can not be denied.
But yet this queſtion ought to be
demaūded,A queſtion whither y• merit of faith
doth preuent & go before the mercy
of god, that is to ſaie, whyther god
is merceful to man for that onli, bicauſe
he is faithful, or els, whither
he ſhewed his mercy to mā for yt he
ſhold be faythful. For we do rede

                  he dothe not ſay
bycauſe I was faythful. It is gyuen
therfore to the faythful man▪
But how? Truly, bycauſe he ſhold
be faythful. Wherfore, in an other
place of y• ſame boke, I ſpake theſe
wordes very wel, as followeth (for
if we be called to fayth & beleffe by
the mercy of god, not by works, &
the ſame mercy is giuen to them,
whiche do beleue, that they ſholde

ben more diligent, and deſyrous to
rede my workes, then to take anye
fruyte or profit by them, as I did▪
For if they hadde: they ſhuld haue
founde this queſtion opened, and
made playne to them, in the fyrſte

of Millā (which was byſhop there
next to Ambroſe) about diuerſe queſtions,
taken forth of the epiſtel of
Paule vnto the romaynes. About
two of the ſayde queſtions, I ſpent
all the fyrſt booke. Of the whiche,
the fyrſt queſtion was, vpon thys
place of Paule, where it is writen:
What ſhall we then ſaye, is the

law ſynn? god forbyd, continuing
to that place, where the Apoſtle
doth ſaye: who ſhal delyuer me frō
the body of this death? The grace
of god, thorowe Ieſu Chriſt oure
lorde: Vpon the whiche wordes of
the Apoſtell: the lawe is ſpiritual,
but I am carnall, and ſuche other
words, where the fleſh is declared
to fight againſt the ſpirit: I made
myne expoſition, as thoughe man
was there deſcribed to be yet vnder
the lawe, and not vnder grace.
But a good whyle after, I perceaued
& founde, that it perteyned, yea
alſo to the ſpyrytuall man, whyche
is the more probable and true
opinion▪
               
               The ſeconde queſtion of that
fyrſte booke, beganne from that
place, where Paule doth ſaye: not

our father Iſak, contynuynge to

the lord of Sabaoth had left

& lyke vnto Gomor. In the ſolution
of this queſtion, I toke on me
to proue fre wyl to be in man, but
the grace of god went beyond me
and ouercam me. I was broughte
to this poynt, and farther I could
not go, that the words of the Apoſtel
ſhoulde be founde verye trew,
where he ſayde, who doth dyſcerne

               The holy martyr Cypryane, wyllynge
to ſhewe him ſelfe, to be of
thys mynde, dydde prefyxe and ſet
thys tytule folowynge, before a
certayne booke which he made conteynynge

this whole matter, that
is, we ought to boſte vs of nothīg
becauſe we haue nothinge of oure
owne. Beholde, for what cauſe I
ſayd, that I was ouercome by the
teſtimonye of the Apoſtle, when I
was of a contrarye minde, in the
boke, whiche I wrote to Symplycian,
otherwiſe, thā god hath now
made open vnto me. This teſtimonye
of the Apoſtle, when he ſpake
thoſe wordes, to plucke in ye proud
harte, and great boaſting of man,
wyll not ſuffer, that any faythfull
man ſhulde ſaye, I haue fayth of
my ſelfe whiche I receiued not.
               This proud aunſwer is put aſide
by the wordes of the Apoſtell. Yea
and that alſo is wiped away clene
by the ſelfe ſame wordes, that they
cannot ſaye, although I haue not a
perfecte faith of my ſelf, yet haue I
the beginninge therof, by the whiche

I do beleue, fyrſt in Chryſte▪

Yea: and alſo the ſelfe ſame thing
that the one doth plant, & thother

water, the Apoſtell doth attribute,

man, ſayinge: as god hath geuen
to euery man, I haue planted, and
Apollo hath watered. So the Apoſtell,
procedynge in the ſelfe ſame
matter, came to that he ſayde, lette
no man therefore be proude, nor
haue his reioyſyng in man, for he
ſayde before, he whiche reioyſeth, &
is proude, let hym reioyſe, and be
proude in the lorde.
               After he had ſpoken theſe wordes,
and diuerſe other, continuyng
ſtyll in that ſame purpoſe & mater,
he ſayde: Theſe thinges brethren,

for your ſake, that ye might learne

To ſuppoſe and thinke, y• by theſe

of the Apoſtell, as if a man ſhulde
reioyce in his merits, as though he
dyd worke them his owne ſelf, not
the grace of god, but that grace
or gyfte, which ſeperatethe y• good
people, from the euell, not yt grace
whiche is common, both to y• good
and bad, as wel indifferent to the

Let nature alſo haue an other

a certaine dyfference, bytwene mā

bytwene the well fauored

the Apoſtall counſelyd not to be

was proud of ſom good thing perteynyng
to a good lyfe, aſcrybyng
it vnto hym ſelfe, & not vnto god,
wherin he deſeruyd, to be ſayde to
of Paule, who dothe preferre the?
For what thing haſt thou, whiche
thou haſt not receauyd.
               And although I ſhold graunte,
that it were a thing natural, that a
man maye haue fayth in hym, doth
it therfore folowe. yt he hathe faith

                        〈◊〉
                     . For euery man hath not
fayth, although it were poſſyble
for euery man to haue faythe. But
the Apoſtell dothe not ſaye, what

thing maiſt thou haue, which thou
haſt not receaued, that thou mayſt
receaue it, but he ſayth, what haſte
thou, which thou haſt not receued?
Therfore, that a man maye haue
fayth, as well as a man may haue
charitie, it is natural to al men, but
for to haue faith in dede, as to haue
charitie, pertaineth to the grace
of the faithfull. That 
                     •
                  ame nature
then, wherin the poſſibilite to haue
fayth, is geuen to vs, doth not preferre
one man before another: but
faith truelye is the thinge, whyche
preferreth the faithfull before the
vnfaithful. So by theſe ſayinges,
what man doth prefer y•, what haſt
yu that thou haſt not receiued, who
ſoeuer doth ſay, I haue faith of mi
ſelfe, then haue I not receiued it,
doth ſpeak verely agenſt the moſt
open, plaine, & manifeſt verite, not
becauſe ether to beleue, or not to beleue,

is not in the wyl of man, but
in thoſe which ar elected, the wilts
prepared of the lorde. It foloweth
that theſe wordeſ (who doo prefer
the, & what haſte thou that yu haſte
not receiued) doth pertain vnto the
ſame faith, which is in the wylle.

               But if it be of grace, then is it not

There was nothinge, which dyd

All the ways of the lord ar

inueſtigable, and vnable to be ſerched

ſent me, doth drawe hym, and
I wyll rayſe him vp againe in the
lattre day. It is writtē in the prophetes,

                     
                        〈…〉
                     
                   and all ſhall be taughte of
god. Al, whiche haue harde, and
be taught of the father, and haue
alſo learned that, whyche they haue
bene taught, doo come▪ vnto me.
What is that to ſaye, euerye man,
whiche hathe harde of the father, &
is learned of hym, but this, that
there is no man, which doth heare,

and is learned of the father,There commeth none to the ſon: but whome the father teachyth▪ the cauſe then why they do not come is, becauſe god both not teache them but
dothe come vnto me. For yf that
euery man, which hath herd of the
father, and is alſo learned of hym
doth come, then he, which doth not
come, hath neither harde, nor is
learned of the father.
               For if he had hard, and had lerned,
he ſhold haue com. For there is no
man, which euer harde, & was lerned
of the father, that is not come.
But eueri man, (as wytneſſethe the
veryte yt ſelfe) whiche hath hard &
is lernid of my father, doth com.
               This ſcholl is very ſtraunge,
and far from the ſenſis of the fleſh,
in ye which ſchol the father is hard,
wherin he teacheth, how a man mai
com vnto his ſon, In yt ſame ſcholl
is the ſon alſo, for he is the worde
of hym ſelfe, by whom the father
doth ſo teach, & that thing, he doth
not with the eares of the fleſh, but

with the eares of the hart. In that
ſchol is alſo the ſpirit of the father
and of the ſon,The father, the ſonne, & the ſpirit of them bothe d

ſeuerally from the other, but iointli
wyth them, For, as we haue ſayd,
the workes of the trynite ar inſeperable.
And that ſame ſpirit is the
holy ghoſt,Wherefore is it called the dede of the father▪ when we 
                        〈◊〉
                      whom the father teacheth (ſyth that y• ſonne and y• holy ghoſt as alſo preſent in tha

                      of the 
                        〈…〉
                     . of whom the Apoſtell
ſpeaketh theſe wordes (hauing the
ſelfe ſame ſpirit of faith). But therfore,
this dede of teaching, is namly
and princypally aſcrybed to the
father, bycauſe the ſon was begotton
of hym, his only begotten ſon
from whom alſo procedyd the holy
ghoſt, wherof it were to long to diſpute
euery thing at large, for as
much as I haue wryttē fyften bokes
of the trinite, (whiche is god)
whiche bokes I do think are come
to your hands or this tyme. This
ſcholl, I ſaye, is ſet farre from all

humaine, & fleſhly vnderſtanding
wherin the father is harde, & doth
teache. We do ſe many, whiche do
come vnto the ſonne, bycauſe wee
doo ſee manye whiche do beleue in
Chriſt. But where and howe, they
haue herde, and learned this of the
father, we do not ſe. Truly this is
a ſecret grace? And what man doth
doubt therein, but it is grace?
               Therfore this grace,what thing doth grace work in the hart of man whiche is ſecretely
put into mans hart, on the
mere liberalite of god, is receyued
of no harde and ſtony harte. For
this cauſe, is it poured into mans
hart, that it may firſte take awaye
the hardnes of the hart. Therfore,
when the father is herd in the hart
and teacheth that they ſhuld come
vnto the ſonne, then doth he take
away the hardnes of the ſtony har
                     •
                  ,
and geueth in the ſteade therof, an
hart of fleſh, as he promiſed by the
prophete. For after this faſhyon,

doth he make y• chyldrē of promyſſion,
and y• veſſels of mercy, which
he hath prepared to glorye.
               But wherfore doth he not teach
al men,an ob

                     ection w
                        •
                     th the anſwere that they ſhuld come vnto
Chriſte, but bycauſe he teacheth of
his owne mercye and compaſſyon,
al thoſe whom he doth teach? And
the cauſe, why he doth not tech the
other, is of his rightwyſnes & iudgement.
For on whom he willeth,
he taketh mercye and compaſſion,
and whome hym pleaſeth, he doth
obdurate, and harden. But in geuyng
yt which is good, he ſheweth
hym ſelfe merciful, & in that he hardeneth,
he rewardeth worthely.
               But yf thou wylt ſay, that theſe
wordes are not the wordes of the
Apoſtle: but of ſome other, ſpoken
vnto hym, that they ſhuld ſeme to
ſay (then god is merciful, on whom
he wyl haue mercy, and hardeneth
whō he wyl harden) wt ſuch other

wordes, as do folow, as (wherfore
doth he complayne? who is able to
be againſt his wyl, or to reſyſt hī?)
Dyd the Apoſtle make aunſwere
to them againe with theſe wordes:Aunſwere
O man, thou doeſt ſay vntruely?
No 
                     •
                  orſoth, but he aunſwered too
them againe (yf I ſhulde graunte
them to be the words of ſom other
man, ſpoken to the apoſtle) ſayeng
agayne to them. O man, what arte
thou, whiche doeſt reaſon and murmur

haſte thou made me thus?
               Wherfore haſt thou thus faſhyoned
me? hath not the potter power
and lybertie, to make of the ſelfe
ſame claye. &c. as you do know the
wordes of the Apoſtle.
               And yet after a certayne faſhiō
the father doth teache all men to
come vnto the ſonne.
               
                  
For, it is not in vayne wrytten in
the prophets (and all men ſhall be
taught of god). Which teſtimony,
after he had reherſyd vnto them,
he added theſe wordes,By this 
                        〈…〉

                   talk and communication is of
a maſter, which teacheth in town,
or cyte, we doo ſay, This man teacheth
all oure towne or cytte, or
ells al the children of the town or
cytte, not bycauſe al the children of
the town or cytte, do learn, but bycauſ
no mā doth lern, or go to ſchol
but they whiche do learne, or go to
ſchole with him: euen ſo do we ſay
very wel and truely, God teacheth
all men to come to Chriſt, not that
al do come, but becauſe noone doo
come, but they whiche are learned▪
                  
and taught of hym. But the cauſe,
wherfore god doth not tech al mē,
the Apoſtel hath declared ſo far, as
he thought neceſſary, and expediēt
to be opened, ſaying theſe wordes,
(bicauſe he wold ſhewe his wrathe,
and make his poure knowen, he
brought forth with great pacience
the veſſels of wrath, which at ordeinyd
and made to perdition, that he
might declar the ryches of his glory,
on the veſſels of mercy, whiche he
hath prepared to glory.) This is y•
cauſe, wherfore the word of the veryte
is foliſhnis, to them, which do
peryſhe, but to thē, which ar ſaued
it is the vertu of god. Al theſe, god
doth tech to com to Chriſt, all theſe
he wyll haue ſaued and comme to
the knowledge of the veryte. For,
if he woulde teache them alſo to
comme to Chriſt, which do eſteme,
the prechīg of the cros to be foliſhfolyſhnes,

there is no doubt, but
they wold com alſo, as wel as the
other. For he deceuyth no man, nor
is deceyuyd of anye, whiche doth
ſay, euery man, which doth here of
my father and is learned of hym,
commythe vnto me. God forbid
therfore, that we ſhulde ſaye, that

to be worthy. But we do ſaye, that
man is made worthy, by the grace
and predeſtination of god. Nowe
what dyfference is betwene grace,
and predeſtination, I wyl tel you.
Predeſtination, is a preparation
of grace. Grace is the free gyfte it
ſelfe.The differēce betwen predeſtinatination, and grace. That ſayinge therfore of the
Apoſtell, which is: not of workes,
that no man ſhulde reioyſe (for we
are his worke, created in Chriſt Ieſu,
into good workes) is the grace
wherof we do ſpeke. And yt ſaying
of ye ſame Apoſtell, which foloweth
afterward, (which god hath prepared,
yt we ſhuld walke in thē) is predeſtination,
which cannot be wtout
preſcience or forknowleg, but ye forknoledg,
or preſcience of god▪ maye

is ſayde, he hathe made & wroughte

haue ben, are, & ſhal be cōmytted.
For although there is certayn ſyn,

                      of predeſtination. Wherefore the
predeſtination of god, which is in
goodnes, is as I ſayde, the preparation
of grace, and grace is theffect
of y• ſame predeſtinatiō. Therfore,
whē god dyd promyſe to Abraham,
in his ſeede, the fayth of the
gentyls, ſayeng: I haue ordeyned
and ſet the, to be a father of manye
nations, vpon the which wordes
the apoſtle ſpeakynge, ſayd: For yt
cauſe by faith (ſaith he) yt ye promiſ
might be firme & ſure to all ſedes,

he dyd not make this promyſe too
the power and ſtrength of our wil,
but vpon his owne predeſtinatiō.
For, he promyſed that he hym ſelf
woulde do it, not that men ſhulde
do it. For although that men doo
manye good thynges,* god maketh men to worke well. whiche pertayne
to the worſhyppe of god, yet
it is god, which maketh them to do
theſe thinges, which he hath commaunded
to be doone. Their workes
and dedes, do not cauſe hym,
that he ſhuld performe that, which
he hath promyſed. For if it ſhuld
be ſo, then were it in mans power
and not in the power of God, that
the promyſe of god, ſhulde be perfourmed,
& that alſo, whiche god
dyd promyſe, they ſhoulde be the
cauſe that it is perfourmed vnto
Abraham.
               Abraham beleued not after that
faſhion. He beleued and gaue glorye

vnto god, becauſe he knewe
that he was able to performe thoſe
thynges, which he dyd promyſe.
He doth not ſaye he is able to tell
thē therof before, nether doth he ſay
God is able to haue the foreknoledge
of theſe thinges (for, he cann
bothe ſhewe before, and alſo know
before thoſe thinges which he doth
not) but he ſayth, god is able to do
them as wel as to promyſe them,
and ſo they are his own workes &
dedes, and not other mens dedes,
which cauſe him to perform that
which he promiſed.
               Or wylt thou ſaye,an obiectiō

the good workes of the gentyls

               Vnto the tyme of the being
of the body in yearth alyue, origynall
ſynne is referred, whiche, the
Pelagyans do deny, but the churche

of Chriſte▪ doth confeſſe it, that
original ſynne, is either by ye grace
of god pardoned, or not pardoned,
accordynge to his iudgement, that
I ſay, infantes, by the merit of regeneration,
do departe from euyll

to be true, whiche you do wryte, &

wyll teache them, & put into their

thoſe ſynnes, which are not
yet commytted, yf thoſe ſame
ſynnes maye be iuſtlye puniſhed
in thē, which at not baptized, that
by the grace of god, they maye aſwell
be forgeuen, in thoſe which ar
baptiſed. For who ſoeuer doth ſay,
that tranſgreſſions to com, whiche
are not done, maye be punyſhed by
the iudgement of god, & maye not,
by his mercye be alſo forgeuen, let
hym conſydre what greate iniurye
he dothe vnto god, & to his grace,
in that he doth ſay, that ſinnes not
commytted, are in the foreknowledge
of god, to be ponyſhed, but
that it is not in his power to forgeue
them.
               
                  
If it be a greate abſurditie ſo for
ſaye, then is it expedyent, & neceſſary,
that infantes ſhulde be ſuccoured

they had lyued lenger tyme.

that they whiche
do repente, haue
forgyuenes of

thoſe chyldren do dye wtoute

they are in the foreknowledge of
god, that they woulde not repent
yf they ſhoulde haue had lenger
lyfe, & thoſe which are baptiſed, &
after theyr baptyme do dy in their

infancy, are alſo in the foreknowledge
of god, that if they had liued
lenger, they would haue repented
and byn ſorye for their ſynne, lette
them take hede what they do ſaye,
& marke well, if it be ſo, as they do
ſay,Anſwe

                     : that thou original ſynne is not

onely, which they wold haue commytted,
if they had lenger ſpace of
lyfe. And alſo let them perceyue, y•
by their reaſon, thoſe, whyche are
baptyſed, are not by the fountayne
of baptime waſhed, & clenſed, from
theyr original ſynne▪ but frō thoſe
ſynns: whiche they woulde haue
commytted, yf theye hadde lyued
anye lenger tyme. For tyl the time
of more perfection of yeares, they
coulde not ſynne. But becauſe god
knewe, that ſome, woulde repente,
and ſome woulde not, therefore

ſome were baptiſed before they dyed,
This's the reaſō of the whiche ſay that 
                        〈◊〉
                      are ſaued▪ or codmened, for that whiche god knw they woulde doo yf they had lyued. and then departed, and thei whiche
woulde not repente, departed
without baptyme. If the Pelagians
harde this their reaſon, they
woulde not ſtycke much, to vtterly
denye originall ſynne, and ſeeke
ſome other place of reſte for chyldren,
for ſomuche as they are perſwaded,
that they cannot haue lyfe
euerlaſtynge, which haue not eatē
the fleſhe, and dronken the bloude
of Chriſte, and agayne becauſe
they are thus perſwaded, that in
theim whiche haue no ſynne, baptyme
is of none effecte▪ which baptyme
is geuen in the remyſſyon of
ſynne. For, they woulde ſaye,
that there weare noo orygynall
ſynne at all, but that infantes departynge
frome thys lyfe, in their
infancye, eyther are baptyſed acacording

to the good dedes, which
theye woulde haue done in longer
time, or not baptiſed acordinge to
the euel dedes. And lykewyſe they
wold ſaye, that after the ſame reaſō
of meryttes, good or bad, they dooe
eat and drynk the fleſh and bloud
of Chriſte, or other wyſe, withoute
the which, no man can haue lyfe eternal.
They wolde ſaye alſo, that
yonge chyldren are baptiſed in the
trew remyſſion of ſynn, althoughe
theye toke no ſynne of Adam, bycauſe
thei ar taught, that ye ſinnes
whiche infants wolde haue donne,
(wherof god knew thei wold haue
repentyd if they had lyued) ar clenſyd
and taken awaye by baptyme.
After this faſſhion thei might eaſly
handel the matter, and haue the
victory, which do denye originall
ſyn to be in man, holding opinion,
that the grace of god is gyuen non

otherwiſe, but after out deſeruīg.
But, bycauſe the workes, 
                     〈◊〉
                   dedes,
which are not yet done, are nothīg
at all, becauſe thei are not done (as
euery man maye eaſelye perceiue)
neither can the Pelagians (muche
leſſe the other) either ſay, or defend
any ſuche thinge. Truelye, it greueth
me very muche, and more thā
I can ſpeake, to ſe that theſe men,
whiche moſt catholykely, do condemne
the error of the pelagians,
do not ſe, and perceiue
that thinge, whiche
the pelagians
them ſelfe do ſe,
to be very falſe
& farre from
al reaſon.

if thoſe ſynnes, whiche a man
hathe not doone, are punyſhed (as
they doo ſaye?) The ſayde Cyprian
ſayeth furthermore very copyouſely,
and fruitefully▪ that in this
lyfe, there is alwaye perill & daunger
of ſynne, whiche after this lyfe

ceaſeth, and is no more: And, that

Whiche teſtimoni beynge alleged

as a thinge written of no canonicall

of this boke were not at al,

while he is iuſt
               Whoſoeuer doth ſay thus, that he

that wolde go againſte it?

That is to ſaye, he knewe, that he
woulde geue to hym a ſhorte lyfe,
that he ſhoulde be taken away, not

is. It was not in his preſcyence,
that he ſhould ſynne, when he
would not ſuffer him, to continue,
and to abyde the temtacion of ſyn.
For as touchinge this lyfe, it is
redde in the boke of Iob. Is not
the lyfe of man vpon the erth, temtacion?
But the cauſe why it is giuen
to ſome, to be takē forth of the

ſuffered here to abydeſtyl, ſo lōge,
tyll they do fall from their ryghtewiſenes,

               For that byrth and generatiō was
not geuen, nor rewarded to Chriſt,
for any of his merits, but frelye, it
was geuen to hym, that he ſhulde
be pure, and cleane, from all maner

For he dyd make vs to beleue

vs, in whom we ſhulde beleue. Yt
is he, which worketh in men, both
the begynnynge, and endinge of
our faith in Ieſu, which did make

                  FOr god doth call
many, whiche are
his chyldren predeſtinated,

might make them

was predeſtinated, not with that
maner of callynge, as they were
called, which woulde not come to

were y• Iewes called, to whome

Chriſt crucyfyed is an effundicle,

whiche are called, thoſe whiche are
not called, knowing yt ther is a certayn
vocation of them, whiche are
called, after y• purpoſe of god, whō
he knew before & predeſtinated, to
be lyke to the ymage of his ſon.
               This vocation dyd he meane
when he ſayde. Not of workes,roma, 9 but
of hym, which doth cal, it was ſaid

hym, (that the elder ſhoulde ſerue
to the yonger.) Dyd he ſay (I pray
you) Not of workes, but of hym,
whiche beleueth-Nay, he toke this
thinge cleane from man, that he
myght geue altogether vnto god.
And therefore, ſayde he, but of y•
caller, and not that, after euery maner
of vocation, but with that vocation,
whereby he is made faythfull.
               This vocation dyd he conſyder,
when he ſayde. The gyftes, and

For I woulde haue you
marke, and loke wel vpon it, what
thynge the Apoſtle, wente then
about when he ſpake theſe words.
               For when he ſayde, I wold not

yea, the euyl, to be profitable, & alſo
to do good. Not that the veſſels
of wrath, ſhoulde do to hym anye

well order them, they ſhoulde be
profitable, and good to the veſſels
of mercy. What thinge coulde be
ſpoken, more plainly, then ye which
he ſayde (accordinge to the goſpel,

It is then in the power of the wycked

after the Iewes had ſent the Apoſtles
awaye from them,he proueth that the Iewes dyd no more to chriſte than was ordeyned of god, that he may make his āſwer good and were
come among their felowes, which
were the reſt of the dyſcyples, and
had ſhewed to them, what opprobrye,
the preſtes, and the eldars,
had done, and ſpoken to them, thei
did lyft vp their voyce altogether
with one conſent of mynde, vnto y•

by the mouth of our father Dauyd,
thy holy chylde haſt ſayde:
Wherefore haue the gentyles raged,
and ſtudied for vain thinges?
The kynges of the yerth haue ryſen
vp, and the princes haue gathered
their hedes together, agenſt
the lorde, and againſt his Chriſt.
For hete truely in this cytye, Herode
Pylat, and the people of Iſrael,
haue gone into counſel, agēſt

thy holy chylde Ieſu, whome thou
haſt anoincted, that they ſhulde do
ſo muche, as thy hande, and counſel
hath predeſtined for to be done.
This is meante by that ſayenge,
which is (accordinge to the euangell,
they are enmies for yourſake)
For the hande, and counſel of god
hath predeſtined, yt the wycked Iewes
ſhuld do ſo much, as was neceſſary
for the goſpel, to our helth.
But what dothe the apoſtell ſaye
more? But as toching electiō (ſaith
he) thei are belouid for the fathers
ſake. Ar thoſe enemies thē elected,
and beloued, which in there wickednys
and hatred, haue periſhed,
and yet ſtyl do peryſhe, being of ye

Godforbyd? There is no man ſo
much a fole ſo to ſay. But yet, both
theſe thinges, although thei ar of
them ſelfe contracti, that is to be enmies,
and to be beloued, and do

do not ſerue bothe for one maner
of men, yet, both to be enemyes, &
to be beloued, pertaineth to al one
nation, being of the Iewes, and to

This ſens, and vnderſtāding

fyrſt electe, and choſe god, by their
beleif in hym, that ſo they myghte
deſerue to be elected of him again.
But that is clean: taken awaye,

by this ſayenglye haue not elected
me, but I haue elected you▪ And
ſo they alſo dyd chooſe hym, when
they beleued in hym. But for this
cauſe onely did he ſpeke theſe wori
                     •
                  
                  des
(Ye haue not choſen me, but I
haue choſē you becauſe they haue
not choſen hym, that he ſhold choſe
them againe afterwarde, for he did
choſe them firſte, bycauſe his mercye
dyd preuent them, accordynge
to grace, and not according, to meryt
and reward. He dyd then choſe
them out of the worlde, what tyme
he was here in fleſh, but they were
alſo allready, elected and choſen in
him ſelfe, yea, before the ſoūdacion
of the worlde.
               This veritie of predeſtination
is not able to be moued, nor yet
once ſtyrred, by any mean that can
be thoughte. For what is that the
apoſtell doth ſaye, (as he hath choſen

vs in him ſelfe, before the begynning
of the world).Eph. 1. Thys trulye
(yf it was ſpoken and ſayd, becauſe
god knewe before, as thei do
ſaye) that they wold beleue in him,
& not becauſe he would make them
for to beleue: agenſt that maner of
preſcyence, and forknowlege, doth
the ſonne of god ſpeake, ſayinge:
(Ye haue not elected: & choſen me,
but I haue choſē you) for ſo much
as by their reaſon, he ſhoulde haue
had in his foreknowlege, that thei
wold choſe him fyrſt: yt they might
deſerue to be elected, and choſen of
hym againe.
               So y• trueth is, y• they were elected
before the foūdation of the world
by that ſame predeſtination, in the
whiche predeſtination, god knewe
before thoſe works, which he wold
do of his owne ſelf. And thei were
elected, oute of the worlde, by that

vocation, wherwith god dyd perfourme
that thinge, whiche he 
                     〈◊〉
                  
before predeſtinated. For whome
he hath predeſtinated, them hathe
he called, with that ſame vocation,
which is according to his purpoſe
& determinatiō. Then hath he called
thoſe, & none other. But whō he
hath predeſtinated, them hathe he
called, and none other. And agayn
whome he hath thus called, them
alſo hath he iuſtified, & none other▪
And whom he hath predeſtinated:
iuſtified, & called, them hath he glorified,
in that ſame end, which hath
no ende. It doth folowe, that god
hath choſen the faithfull: that thei
myght be faithfull, not that they
were faithful before they were choſen.
The apoſtel Iames doth ſaye
(hath not god choſen the
                     •
                   poore in
this worlde to be riche in faith, &
heyres of the kyngdome, which he

promyſed to them, whiche do loue
hym? It doth folow that by election
he doth make mē riche in faith,
as wel as heyres of his kyngdom:
And it is well & truely ſayde▪ that
he doth choſe thē, becauſe he hathe
choſen them, that he myght worke
his election in them. I praye you
what man hearinge ye lorde ſaye:
(ye haue not choſen me, but I haue
choſen you) durſt be ſo bold to ſay,
that men do beleue, becauſe they
myght be choſen, whē in dede they
are choſen, that they myght beleue,
leaſt they ſhuld (agenſt
the ſaying of Chryſt) be
thought fyrſte to elect
and choſe Chriſt, to
whom Chriſt ſayeth,
ye haue not
choſen me,Ihon. 15
                        •
                     
                  
but I haue choſen you.
            
            
               
               The xviii Chapiter
               
                  WHat man hearing
the Apoſtell ſay,
bleſſyd is god the
father of our lord
Ieſu chryſt, which
hath bleſſed vs
wyth al heuenlye bleſſinge in ſpiritual
thinges in chryſt, as he hathe
choſē vſ in hym ſelf before y• foundation
of the world, that we might
be holy, and wythout ſpot in his
ſyght in al loue, predeſtening vs▪ in
to the adoption of children, by chriſte
Ieſu in to him, according to the
pleaſure of his wyll, in the whiche
wyl he hath accept
                     •
                  d vs, in his welbelouyd
ſon, in whome we haue redemption,
thorowe his blod, & forgiuenes
of our ſynne, after the ryches
of his grace, whiche he hathe
declared vpon vs aboundauntly,

according to his infynite wyſdom,
that he might ſhew to vs the miſtery
of his wil, acording to his good
wyl, whiche he hathe pourpoſed in
hym ſelfe, that it ſhold be prechyd
when the time was ful com, that al
thinges ſhould be accompliſhed in
Chriſt, both the thinges, which at
in heauen, and alſo in erth, in him,
in whome we haue obteyned, ye lot
of enherytaunce, which ar predeſtined
after the pourpoſe of hys wyl,
which doth worke al thinges after
the pourpoſe of hys own wyl, yt we
maye be to the prayſe of his glory.
What man hearing this diligently,
and vnderſtādīg it, durſt doubt
any thing of this open veryte which
we do defend? God dyd choſe in
chryſt, his members before the begynnyng
of the world, and howe
coulde he choſe thē, which yet were
not, but by predeſtenīg thē? He thē
                  
dyde elect, & choſe vs predeſtenīge
vs. Wold he elect, and choſe, thoſe
which are wycked & vncleane? For
if a queſtion ſholde be aſked, whyther
he doth choſe thoſe, whiche are
wycked and vnclean, or the other
which are holy, and without blame
what anſwer wold a man, make vnto
it? Wold he not anſwer, that the
godly are elected and choſen? Vpō
this reaſon doth it follow (ſaythe
Pelagiā) that he knew before who
ſholde be holy, and cleanne,Pelagians obiection by the
lyberte and fredō of ther own wil.
And therfore he did elect and choſe
them, before the begynnyng of the
worlde, in that preſcyence and forknowlege,
wherby he knew before,
that they wolde be ſuche. And ſo
(ſaythe he) god dyd predeſtinate
them, before they were, whom he
knew, wolde be immaculate and
holy. Then dyd he not make thē to

be holy. nor yet did he ſe befor that
he wolde work any ſuch holynes &
purenys in them, but that only, did
he ſe before, that they wold of them
ſelfe be ſuch as were holy.The aunſwer to pelagians obiection Lete vs
now conſyder & wet y• words of the
Apoſtell, and let vs ſe, whyther he
dyd elect & choſe vs before the beginnyng
of the worlde, bycauſe he
knewe yt we wolde of our own wyll
be ſuch, as ar holy and vertuoſe, or
ells, bycauſe we myghte be made
ſuch by hym.
               Bleſſyd (ſayth he) is God the
father of our lorde Ieſu Chryſte,
which hath bleſſid vs, wyth al ſpirituall
bleſſynge, in ſpiritual thinges,
in Chriſt, as he hath choſen vs
in hym ſelfe, before the begynning
of the worlde, that we myghte be
holye and without blame. It was
not then, bycauſe we ſhoulde

be holy of our ſelfe, but becauſe we
myght be made holy. For it is true
& certaine, that therefore we ſhuld
be ſuch, becauſe he hath choſen vs;
predeſtenynge vs, that we myghte
be made ſuche by his grace.
               So then hath be bleſſed vs, with
his ſpiritual bleſſinge, in heuenly
thīges, in Chriſt Ieſu, as he hath
choſen vs, in hym ſelfe, before the
groūd of the world, that we might
be holy & immaculate, in his ſight,
in loue, predeſteninge vs, into the
adoption of chyldrē, by Chriſt Ieſu
in hym ſelfe.
               Alſo, marke what the apoſtle
doth ſaye furthermore▪ concerning
this matter (after ye pleaſure, ſaith
he, of his wyl), leaſt in ſo great a
benefyte of the grace of God, we
ſhuld take pryde in the pleaſure of
our owne wyll, in the which grace,
he hath accepted vs, in his beloued

ſonne, in the whyche wyll, he hath
alſo accepted vs. For this vocable
or worde, gratified, is deryued
from this word grace, as this
word iuſtefied, from this vocable
and worde, iuſtice.
               In whome (fayeth the apoſtle)
we haue redemption, through his
bloude, & forgiuenes of our ſynne,
after ye riches of his grace, which
grace hath bene aboūdantly poured
vpon vs, according to his omnipotent
wyſedome, that he might
ſhewe to vs the miſtery, or ſecrete
of hys wyl, according to hys owne
good wyll and pleaſure.
               In this miſtery of his wyl, he laid
& ſet vp the riches of his grace according
to the goodwil of him ſelfe,
not after oure wyl, which in no
wyſe cann be good, except he after
his good wyl doth make yt good.
But after the Apoſtel had ſpoken

theſe words (after his good wyl) he
added theſe wordes therto (whiche
wyll, he hathe pourpoſed in hym)
that is to ſaye, in hys welbelouyd
ſonne, that it ſholde be prechyd,
when the tyme was full come, yt al
thinges ſhold be gatheri
                     •
                   togither
by Chriſt, which ate in heuē, & whiche
ate in yerthe, by him, by whom
we haue obteined then heritaunce,
we, which wer predeſtined before,
according to the pourpoſe of hym,
which doth work al thinges, acording
to the counſel of his own wil
that we myght be to the la
                     •
                  de, and
prayſe of his glory.
               It were to longe to ſtond, and diſpute
vpon euery word herof.
For, I know wel ye do perceue, wt
how playn, & open wordes, the Apoſtel
doth defende this grace, againſt
the whiche grace, the merittes,
and workes of men, are extolled,
as though it were in mans power,

to gyue to god ſom thing firſt
as a preſent, wherby he myght deſerue
to be rewarded of him again.
God hath choſen vs therfore in
Chriſt, befor the beginning of the
worlde, predeſtening vs to be his
chyldren by adoption, not bicauſe
we wold be holi & pure of our ſelfe
but bycauſe he hath choſen & predeſtenid
vs, that we ſhuld be ſuch.
And this did he worke after y• pleaſure
of his owne wyll, that no man
ſhold haue ani cauſe to reioyſe of
his own wil, but of y• wil of god, toward
him. This did he work after
the riches of his grace, accordīg to
his owne good wyl, which wil, he
pourpoſed in his welbeloued ſon,
bi whō we haue our enherytaunce
which ar predeſtīed after the pourpoſe,
not of our ſelf, but of hī which
doth work al thīges, not ſo much,
as the wyl of mā exceptid, but it

is wróght by hym in vs. He doth
worke it after the counſell of hys
wyll, that we maye be made to the
prayſe of hys glory. And therfore
do we crye out, that no man ſhulde
reioyſe in man, & ſo not in hym ſelf,
but he whiche doth reioyſe, let hym
reioyce in the lorde, that we maye
laude & prayſe his glorye. For he
doth work after the porpoſe of his
own wil, y• we ſhuld be holy & pure,
to the laud & praiſe of his glorye,
for the whiche thinge he hath called
vs, predeſtenyng vs before the
begynnyng of the world.
               Of this pourpoſe of god, is this
vocation, which is proper to the elects,
to whom al things are wrought
to ther commodite and profet,
bycauſe after the pourpoſe of god,
thei are called holy. For the gyftes
and vocation of god, are without
repentaunce:

the election of his grace, with the
whiche, he hath accepted vs, thorowe
his welbeloued ſonne. Forſomuche
then, as he hath predeſtened

               For, we do ſay (ſayth Pelagian)
that oure God dydde no more, but
know before, that ſame ſaith, wherby
we do begynne ſo beleue, and
then dyd he choſe vs, and predeſtinate
vs, that we myghte be holy, &

let them marke a lytell better, the

whiche are predeſtyned, after the
purpoſe of his wyll, whiche worketh
al thing. Then doth he work
in vs, the ſelf ſame, that we do beleue,

For this vocation, (wherof it
is wrytten, the gyftes, and calling

Wherof it is wrytten alſo, (not of

reply any more in this matter? We
haue ſayde ynoughe therof.
               Fynalli, y• apoſtel after theſe wordes,
gaue thankes to god, for them
whiche beleued: not bycauſe the
ghoſpel was declared vnto them,
but bycauſe thei beleuid. For he
ſpeketh after this wyſe (on whō, ye

               The faith of them, was yet,
but yonge and tender, when they
harde the euangell preached vnto
them, of the which their faith, whē
the apoſtell had hearde, he gaue
thankes to God for them. If one
man ſhuld giue thanks to another
for a thinge, whiche he thought or
knew well that he coulde not perfourme.
or do, it myght be named,
a mocke, or a ſcorne, better than a

thankes geuynge. Lette vs not
brethren,Gala. 6. in no wyſe be deceaued:
for God wyll not be mocked, nor
ſkorned of vs. For faith, (ye y• begynnynge
thereof,) is the gyfte of
god, or elles the apoſtle ſhuld haue
gyuen thankes, and prayſe, to him▪
where he deſerued none. What ſay
you to this? Was not the fayth
of the Theſſalonians perceiued,
what tyme they begann to beleue:
for the whiche the Apoſtell gaue
thanks vnto God,Theſe. 2, ſaying. (Therfore
doo we geue thankes to god
without ceaſynge, becauſe when ye
hearde the worde of god preached
and taughte of vs, ye receyued it
not as the worde of man, but as it
is in deede, as the worde of god,
which worde doth worke in you,
which haue beleued.
               What is it, that the Apoſtel giueth
thankes for? Truely, it were

a folyſhe, and an ydell thynge that
he ſhoulde gyue thankes to hym,
for that thynge which he dyd not.
But becauſe his thankes are not
in vayne, and ydell, treulye god to
whom he gaue thankes, dyd worke
that deede, that after they had
harde, and perceyued the worde of
god by the preachyng of the Apoſtel,
they ſhoulde alſo receiue it, as
the worde of god, accordinge as it
dooth deſerue, not as the word of
men.
               Then it is god, whiche worketh
in the hartes of men, (with
that vocacyon, whiche is after his
purpoſe, whereof we haue ſpoken
ſo myche) that the worde of god
ſhulde not be hearde in vayne, but
after they had heard it, they ſhuld
be conuerted, and beleue, receyuynge
it, not as the worde of man,

but, accordynge to right, as the very
worde of god.
            
            
               The .xx. Chapter.
               
                  THis alſo doth certifye
vs, that the
beginnīg of faith
is the gift of god▪
when the Apoſtel
in the begynning
of his epiſtle to the Coloſſiās,colloſſ, 4, meanyng
the very beginning of faith,
ſpake theſe words, ſaying: be ſtedfaſt
in prayer, watchynge therein,
with thankes geuynge, and praying
alſo for vs,By theſe wordes he ment that god wolde 
                        〈…〉
                     
                   that god would open

maye ſpeake the miſtery of Chriſt,
for the whiche. I am alſo, nowe in

and declare that ſame miſterye,
as I ought for to ſpeake it.
               
                  
Howe is the dore of the worde opened?
But when the ſence or vnderſtondyng,
of the hearer is made
open, that he might beleue, and ſo
the beginning of faith, being made
by god, he maye alſo receiue thoſe
thinges, whiche are preched, & diſputed,
to the ſettynge vp, and furtheraunce
of holſome doctryn▪ leaſt
his hart being ſhyt vp, thorow infidelyte,
& want of beleif, he ſhulde
diſproue, and caſte from him, thoſe
thinges whiche are taught. For
that cauſe, he doth ſaye in the epiſtle
to ye Corinthians.Corin 16. I wil abide
at Epheſus, til the penthecoſt. For
I haue a great, & wide dore, made
open vnto me, and there are manye
aduerſaries. What other thinge
may be ment, and vnderſtanded bi
theſe wordes, but that, after he began
to preache the goſpell in that
place, many dyd beleue, and many

alſo ther were, which were aduerſarys
to that faith, acording to the
wordes of the lorde, No mā doth
comme to me, except it be geuen to
him of mi father. And alſo,Ihon. 6. the lord
Ieſu Chriſt ſaythe, (to you it is geuen
to knowe the myſterys of the

of them, I departed thens to Macedonia.
Of whom dydde he

he take his leaue, but of them which
dyd beleue, in whoſe hartes the

doth ſaye, in the actes of the apoſtels,
God had opened her ſence, &
vnderſtandynge, & ſo ſhe dyd herken
dilygently, to the preachynge
of the Apoſtell. For ſo was ſhe called,
that ſhe myght beleue. God verely
doth worke what hym pleſeth
in the hartes of men, eyther by his
mercyfull helpe, or by his rightewyſe
iudgemente, that by them, all
ſhuld be fulfylled, which, his hand
& counſell, hath predeſtinated for
to be done.
               Therfore, they ſpeake vnwyſely,
where as they do ſay, that, that
thing doth not ſerue for this matter,
whiche we haue ſufficientlye
proued by the ſcriptures, taken
out of the boke of the kynges, & of
the cronicles, that when god wyll
haue a thynge to be done, whiche
muſte be done by the wyll of men,

ther hartes are fyrſt inclyned and
made for to wyll that ſame thyng
(god being the inclinar, the motioner
& ſtyrrar therto,god worke
                        •
                      both y• wyl & the ded

                      of y• wyll whiche after a
maruaylous, & vnſpeakeable maner,
doth alſo worke, yea that ſame
whiche we do wyll in vs). But
what they do meane, by that they
do ſpeake nothinge therof, and yet
are ageynſt it, I cannot tell, except
they haue declared vnto you ſome
reaſō, wherfore they ſhuld ſo think
whoſe ſayenge, you had rather let
paſſe, then to open it by writinge.
Or peraduentur, bicauſe we ſayd,
that god dyd worke in the hartes
of men, bringing the wylls of thē,
whome hym pleaſyd, to this, that
Saule or Dauyd ſhold be made
kynge: Dyd they therfore thinke
that this ſeruyd not for the pourpoſe,
which we do treate of, bycauſ
this temporall kyngdome, here in

this world is on thing,As though god dothe rule the hart of men in wordly maters and not in heuenly. and for to

                     •
                  eynge with god for euer, is an other?
               Or do they thynke that god doth
inclyne, moue or ſtyrte, the wylles
of them, whome hym pleaſethe, to
the creatynge, and ſettynge vp of
earthly princes, and not to the obteynynge
of the heauenly kyngedom?
But I do thinke: that theſe
ſayings of the ſcripture, where it
is wrytten (Inclyne myne hart to
thy teſtymonyes) and that ſaying,
(the ſteppes and goings of men,
are gouerned of god, and he ſhall
wyl his wey) & alſo, The wyl is
prepared of the lorde. And this
alſo, (Let the lord be with vs, as
he was with oure fathers, let hym
not relinquyſhe and forſake vs
nor yet torn vs awaye from hym,
but lette hym inclyene and bende

oure hartes to hym, that we may
                     •
                  
walke in all his wayes. Yet, there
is another ſayinge of the ſcriptur:
(I wyll geue to theym an harte to
knowe me, & eares to heare with.)
Agayne (I wyl geue to them another
harte, & a newe ſpirite I wyll
gyue to them. Let them heare this
alſo, (I wyl giue my ſpirit in you,
& I wyl make, that ye ſhall walke
in my iuſtification, & rightwiſnes,
& to obſerue, & kepe my iudgementes,
& decrees. And this ſaying (god
doth gouerne & rule the ſteppes of
man, how can a mortal man know
his owne wayes?) Again, (Euerye
man doth thinke hym ſelfe iuſt, &
ryghtwyſe, but god doth gouerne
the hartes. Let them here this ſaying,
(Thei beleued, as mani as wer
ordeyned to lyfe euerlaſtyng.
               Theſe ſayinges I do thinke, were
ſpoken concerning the kyngdome

of heauen, and not the erthly kyndom
of this worlde. Therfore lette
them gyue eare vnto theſe ſainges
of the ſcriptures, and to al other,
which I haue not reherſed, by the
which we ar taught, that god doth
prepare, and conuert the wylls

                  of
men vnto the kingdom of heauen,
and to eternal life, as wel as to the
kingdom of this worlde. I praye
you marke & conſyder wyth youre
ſelfe, what maner a thinge that is,
whiche they do ſaye, that we ſhold
beleue that god dothe worke the
wyls of men, about the eſtabliſhīg
of worldly kingdomes, but as toching
the way to come to the kyngdome
of heauen, that men therin do
worke ther owne wylls.
               We haue ſpoken many wordes, &
fewar had bin (peraduentur) ſufficient
to haue perſwaded this matter,
but we do ſpeke vnto good wittes,

as thoughe they were dull, to
whome, yea that, whiche in deede
is more than ynoughe, is not ynough.

For a newe moued

matter againſt that inuented, for

brought the ſelfe ſame teſtimonies
agenſt vs for them, whiche we
hadde for our profe, whereby they
wold ſhew, yt the encreaſe of faith
is the gyft of god, but the begynnynge
therof, (which is, when we
do fyrſte beleue in Chriſte), is of

man him ſelfe, and not the gyft of

vs to take all other good thinges,
folowing this begynning of faith
to be the gyft of god, gyuen to vs
for oure deſeruynge, bycauſe we
dyd fyrſte beleue, and that we receyued
no good thinge, as a free
gyfte, of god. And yet for all theyr
ſayinge, in thoſe ſame gyftes, the
grace of god is onely taught and
preached, whiche is no grace, except
it be frely gyuen.
               The whiche thinge, how greate
abſurditie it doth conteyne in it, ye
do openly ſe, and perceiue. For the
whiche cauſe, we haue ben as diligent,

S. Auguſtine, entituled, of ye godlye
continuaunce in goodnes to
the ende, wherein he proueth,
that all, & euerye
parte, of the lyfe,
whiche is good,
is the gyft of
god, as wel
as the
begynninge thereof.
            
               The fyrſt Chapter.
               
                  NOw with ſome
what more diligence,
muſte we
handell, & diſpute
this matter
of perſeueraunce.
For in
the fyrſt boke, wherin we diſputed
of the begynnyng of faith, we touched

this thinge ſomewhat. Therfore,
our aſſertion is, now, that the
vertu, called perſeueraunce (wherby
we do continue in Chryſte, tyll
the end) is the gift of god.Perſeuerāce to the ende is the gifte of god. I doo
meane that ſame ende, whiche is,
when this lyfe ceaſeth in vs, in the
whiche ende, is all the greate daū
                  ger,
and peryll, leſt then we ſhulde
fall. And ſo, as longe as man is in
this lyfe, tyl that tyme, whether he
hath receyued this gyfte of contynuynge
to the ende, yea or nay, no
man (what ſo euer he be) can tell.
For if he falleth, before he leaueth
this lyfe, we do ſaye, that he hathe
not perſeuered, and continued to
the ende in goodnes. And that is
very true.What man 
                        •
                     oth perſe
                     
                        •
                     er to thend For by what reaſon can
we ſaye, that he eyther receyued, or
had the gyft of perſeueraūce, whiche
hathe not perſeuered? For, yf
ſo 
                     •
                  e, a mā hath now y• vertu of cō
                  tinencye,

or chaſtitie in hym, & afterwarde
falleth from it, becommynge
incontinent, and vnchaſt,
& lykwiſe, if he had ons theſe vertues,
as iuſtice, equitie, & pacience
in hym, yea and fayth it ſelf alſo,
and then falleth again from thoſe
vertuouſe, he maye be well ſayde
that he hadde thoſe vertuouſe, before
he fel from them, but not now
For he was chaſte, iuſt, pacient, &
faithfull, ſo longe as he had thoſe
vertues. But, after he ceaſed to
be that he was, he is not that ſame
he was before. But he, which hath
not perſeuered, and ben ſtedfaſte:
how can you ſaye, that he dyd perſeuer
and was ſtedfaſt, forſomuch
as by his perſeueraunce, and ſtedfaſtnes,
euery man is declared to
be ſtedfaſt: which thing is not declaryd
nor ſpoken of hym, whiche
dothe not ſtand ſtyl and abyde in
that vertue, which he once had:
               
                  
But to auoyde this obiection,
that may be layde againſt vs, as if
they woulde aſke this queſtion, &
ſaye: yf a man, from the tyme that
he began fyrſte to be faithfull, dyd
lyue as for example
                     •
                   the ſpace of .x
yeares,Obiection. and in the myddes of thoſe
ten yeares, did fall from the faith,
ſhall we not ſaye, that he dyd perſeuer,
and was ſtedfaſt for ye ſpace
of fiue yeres, wherin he was faithfull?
Aunſuere I wyll not contende about ye
worde, whither that ſame ought to
be called perſeueraunce, durynge ye
tyme, when he, dyd continue faythfull,
or naye. But as touchynge ye
ſame perſeueraunce, wherof we do
ſpeake and treate, wherein we doo
continue, beleuynge in Chriſte, ye
tyll the ende, that man in no wyſe
can be ſayde, that he euer hadde it,
whiche doth not perſeuer, and continue
to thende. But that man rather

ſhould be called ſtedfaſt, whiche
hath lyued but one year faithfull,
yea and as much leſſe tyme, as
thou wylt, ſo that when he left this
lyfe, he lyued and ended in fayth,
rather (I ſaye) than that man, whiche
lyued faithfull, many yeares, &
before his deathe, dyd fall from it,
though the tyme of his fall before
his death, was neuer ſo ſmall.

                  THis beyng graū
                  ted,
let vs ſe, whither
this perſeueraūce
or ſtedfaſtnes
(whereof it is
wrytten,Matheu. x. he which
continueth to the ende, ſhal be ſaued)
be the gyfte of god, or nay. If
it be not the gyft of god, how can

the words of the Apoſtel be trew,
where he ſayth, it is gyuen to you
for chriſtes ſake, that ye ſhall not
only beleue in hym,Philip. 1. but alſo that
ye ſhal ſuffer for him, Of the whiche
ſayinge the fyrſte parte perteneth
to the beginning of fayth, the
latter part, to the ende of the ſame
fayth. And yet bothe of theſe two
partes, as wel the beginninge as
the ending, at the gyftes of god.
For he ſayth, that both are gyuen
to vs, (as we haue reherſed befor)
For, what better beginning canne
a chriſtian man haue than to beleue
in Chryſte? What better end,
than to ſuffer for Chryſt? But as
toching the faith or belefe in chriſte,
wheras they deuiſed an obiection,
wherby they wold proue, that
the beginning of faith was not ye
gift of god, but thencreaſe onli of
y• ſaid faith, we truſt in the lord, y•
                  
it is ſufficyentli anſweryd to, of vs
in the fyrſt boke. But what canne
they ſay, why perſeueraunce or ſtedfaſtnes
to the ende, ſholde not be
the gyft of Chryſt to that man, whiche
hath receuyd the gyfte to ſuffer
for Chryſt, or (to ſpeak more plainly)
to whome it is gyuen to dye for
Chryſt? For Peter, declaring this
alſo to be ye gift of god, doth ſay, It
is better for vs doing wel,i. Peter. 
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   for to
ſuffer (if it be the wyl of the lorde)
than doing euyl. When the Apoſtel
dothe ſaye, if it be the wyll of
the lorde, he doth ſhewe, that it is
gyuē from god aboue to al ſeinets,He maketh an obiection, prouing that in all mē, perſeuerance is the gyfte of God
that they ſhall ſuffer for Chriſte.
And theye whome Chryſte wyll
haue com to the experyence, & glory
of ſufferinge, canne not thoſe
but comme to the kyngdom of god
if theye do perſeuer, and be ſtedfaſt
in Chryſte to the ende. But

what man can ſay, that this perſeuerannce,
and ſtedfaſtnes, is not giuen
to thoſe men, whiche by ſycknes
of the body, or ſome other way,
do depart, forth of this life, in Chriſte,
when it is geuen to thoſe men,
much more hardly, and ſtreightly
whiche do ſuffer death for Chriſt?
Thoſe men do muche more hardelye
perſeuer,The gifte of perſeuerāce is giuen to ſome more eaſelye then to ſome, to ſome, with perſecution, to ſom without perſecution. & continue, to the end,
when they are perſecuted becauſe
they ſhulde be turned, & broughte
from their ſtedfaſtnes. And therefore,
they do ſtande faſte, yea vnto
death, that they may be found ſtedfaſte.
Therfore to the other it is geuen
after a more eaſy faſhion: thā
vnto theſe, whiche are thus perſecuted.
               But to whom nothing is harde
nor vnpoſſible, it is light and eaſy
to gyue it, as eaſely to the one, as
to the other, that it ſhall not appere

& more ſtreight thing to y• one, thā
to thother▪
                  By the promyſe of god he prouethe that ſtedfaſtnes is the gyft of God▪
                   For god promiſed this
ſtedfaſtnes, when he ſayed, I wyll
geue my feare into their hartes, yt
they may not go from me. By the
whiche wordes, what is elles to be
meant, but that the feare of me ſhal
be ſuche, and ſo great in them, whiche
I wyll geue into their hartes
that they ſhal ſtedfaſtly cleaue vnto
me. But for what cauſe is thys
ſtedfaſtnes prayed for of god, if he
be not the gyuer therof? Ys not
this a petition to mocke god with
all, when that a thinge is aſked of
him, which thinge, they do knowe
he doth not giue, but is thoughte
to be in mans own powr to haue
it, without the gifte of god, of him
ſelfe? And this is none otherwyſe,
but euen lyke, as they do, which do
thanke him for that thing, whiche
he▪ dyd nether gyue nor worke.

prepared agenſt thys foule, & poyſonos
hereſy of ye pelagiās, whoſe
tyme & being,The thre capital hereſeis of the pelagians contrary to theſe godly opynyons, defended of the churche. was long after. For
ther are .iii. pointes aboue al other
which ye catholik church doth defēd
agenſt thē. One point is, that
the grace of god is not giuē after
our merits (for thoſe ſame our merits,
and good workes are alſo the
gyfte of god, and by the onli grace
of god do the iuſte men receaue

al there merytts. The ſecond poīt
is that no mā (be he neuer ſo iuſt)
doth lyue without ſynne in this
corruptible body. The thyrd is,
that man is borne in the ſyn of the
fyrſt mā faſt bound with the bond
of damnation, except that ſame offence
which he hathe by hys firſte
byrthe, be loſed & taken away, by
the new byrth of regeneration. Of

did not treat in his boke. But
of the twane fyrſt pointes, he doth
ſo playnly & openly diſpute, that
theſe newe heretiques, enemis to
the grace of Chriſt, wer confoūded
many yeres before they wer born.
Therfore amonge the merytes of
the ſayntes, whiche ar no merytes

nameth this perſeueraunce for to

wyl of god. And beſyde this ſens,
and vnderſtonding, he perceuid an
other meaning, righte agreable, &
conſonant to our fayth, wherof we
ſpake before, that by theſe wordes,
the faythful men do praye for the
vnfeythful, whiche are but earthe,
bearing about them no thing ells,
but the yearthly man, of ther fyrſte
natiuite and berth, which faythfu
men, are worthely (forſomuche as
they are endued and cled with the

he doth ſhew euydently, & plaī

the begynning of faith, wherof we
haue largely ſpoken in the fyrſte
boke, but of that perſeueraunce, &
ſtedfaſtnes, whiche we muſt haue
continuing to thēd, for the which:
the ſanctified perſons, thoſe, I ſay
which do the wyl of god, do make

                     •
                   that it may be done

may folow the faithfull. And
ſo, by this reaſō, the ſaintes do in
this place praye, that, that thyng
may be which is not yet done, not
that the thing, which is done may
continue. For, although men at neuer
ſo holy, yet are they not equall
with the angels of god, & therfore
the wyl of god is not done in thē,
as it is in heuē. If it be ſo, thē truly:
wher as we do pray, that the vnfaithful
may be made faithful, we
do not in y• petition, pray for perſeuerance,
but for that which is the
begynning therof. But whē we do

deſire, and praye, that men mighte
be made equal, and lyke to angels
in doinge the will of god, then do
we deſire, & pray for perſeuerance,
and ſtedfaſtnes. For no man doth
come to that high bleſſe, whiche is
in heauen, except he continueth to
thende, in that holynes, whiche he
receaued in yearth.

For the pelagians are ſo
bould, that they do hould opinion,
affyrmyng, that a iuſte man dothe
commit no ſin in this lyfe, & that of
ſuche men now at this preſent time
is the church, whiche hathe nether
ſpot nor wrinkel, nor any ſuch like
deformite, which church only is the

ſaying (bringe vs
not into temtatiō
but deliuer vs frō
euyl) what thing
do they ells pray for,Bring us no

                   but that they
ſholde perſeuer, and contynewe in
holynes? For truly after thei haue
this gyfte of god graunted vnto
them (which muſt nedes be the gift
of god, forſomuche as it is aſked,
& prayde for to be had at his handes)
after I ſay, they haue this gift
that they ſhall not be ſed into temtation,
graunted vnto them, then

ther is non of them which haue it,
but haue this perſeuerance, & ſtedfaſtnes
of holines, yea to the ende.
For no man dothe ceaſſe from the
the purpoſe of chriſtian godlines,
or from the holynes which a Chriſten
man ought for to haue, except
he be firſt brought into temtation.
Yf then this petition be graunted
vnto him, that he ſhold not be brought
into temtation, he dothe then
perſiſte and continew ſtyll by the
gyft of god, in that ſame holynes,
which he receued of the gift of god.
               But theſe our brethren (as we do
perceue, bi your wryting) wold not
haue, that this ſtedfaſtnes, and perſeuerance,
ſhuld be ſo prechyd and
taught, that it ſhold be obteyned

to not marke well what thei ſay.
For we do ſpeake of that perſeueance
and ſtedfaſtnes, whiche dothe
continewe to the ende. If it dothe
not continwe to the ende, then is it
not that ſtedfaſtnes,A man can not ſtobernly caſte awaye and le

                     ſe the gyft of perſeueraunce after he hathe once receiued tho gyft wherof we do
ſpeake: then it is not gyuen vnto
them, as we haue ſufficiētli ſpoken
before. Therfore let no mā ſay
that he hath ſtedfaſtnes and perſeuerance
gyuen vnto hym, tyll the
end doth com, when he, to whom it
is gyuen, is foūd that he hath byn
ſtedfaſt in dede. We do ſay, & call
him a chaſt man, whom we do knowe
at that preſent to be chaſte, whither
he doth perſyſt and continewe
ſtyll in that vertue or nay.
               And lykwyſe, if he hathe any other
godly vertue, whiche may be kept
ſtyll or loſt we do ſay, that he hath
the ſame gyft ſo long, as he hath it:
but after y• he hath loſt it, thē do we

ſaye that he had ſuch a gyfte. But
perſeuerance and ſtedfaſtnes to y•
ende, bycauſe no man hath, but he
which doth continue to to the end,
mani a mā may haue it, but no mā
after he hath it, can leaſe it. Nether
ſhal any mā nede to fear, leſt when
he doth continew to the ende, anye
euyl or noughti wyl ſholde ryſe in
him wherby he ſhold not be ſtedfaſt
to the ende.
               Therfore this gyft of god may be
obteined and got by humble, and
lowly petition, but after it is granted,
it can not be loſt agayne bi ani

                     •
                  tobernes. For when a man hathe
continuyd to the ende, nether canne
he leaſe this gyfte nor yet thoſe giftes,
whiche he myght haue loſt before

be loſt, which doth preſerue, & kep
from loſing, that which maye, be

theſe contentions, and brablinges,
whyche are aboute bare,

to gyue that gyft, which he cō
                  maunded
to be aſked, and called

finally to paſſe al other teſtimonies,

we do ſay: Lede vs not into temptation.
For whoſoeuer is not led

                     . For there is a temptacion,
whiche is profitable, when we
are not deceiued and ouercome wt
temptation, but proued only, as it
is writte, proue me (o god) & tempt
me. Thecfore, that ſame temptacion,

whiche the apoſtle doth meane,
when he doth ſaye,To be temptyd, and to be brought ī to temptatiō ar different (leaſt peraduenture
he ſhuld tempt you, which is
the tempter, and then ye ſhould labour
in vayne) that ſame I ſaye
is an vnprofitable temptation, ye
and an hurtefull vnto you.
               For god doth tempt no man, as I
haue ſayde (that is to ſaye) he endu
                     •
                  eth
nor leadeth anye man into
temptation. For, a man to be tempted,
& not to be brought into temptation
is none euyll thynge, yea it
is good and proffitable. For that
is as muche as to be proued. Therfore
when we do ſay to god (Lede
vs not into temptatiō) what other
thinge do we ſaye, than ſuffer vs
not to be brought into temptatiō?
And with thoſe wordes, many vſe
to make their prayer, when they
do praye, as it is wrytten in many
bokes

                  ſuffer vs not to be ledde into

temptation. And ſo dothe holy
Cyprian wryght it. But after the
ghoſpel, as it is wrytten in the
greke toonge, we do not fynde in
any place, any otherwyſe, than, lede
vs not into temptation. And therfore
we do lyue more ſurely and
withoute danger, if we do aſcrybe,
and gyue al the whole vnto god,
not gyuinge part to hym, and reſeruinge
part to oure ſelfe, as this
reuerent and godly martyr dyd
wel perceiue. For when he dyd expound
that ſame part of the lords

he ſpake, he ſayde theſe folowinge.
But when we do praye,
(ſayth he) that we may not com in

oure infyrmite & weaknys in that
we do make that petition bycauſe
that no man ſhold ſullenly, and

were none other
thinge,
wherebye we
myght be inſtructed:
thys
prayer of the
lorde oneli were ſufficient, for the
matter of grace, which we haue taken
vpon vs to defend. For thys
prayer, I ſaye, doth leaue nothing
vnto vs, wherin, as in that, which
is our owne, we ſhoulde reioyſe, &
be proude. For it doth teache vs▪
that it muſt be geuen to vs of god
that we do not go, & departe from
hym, when it teacheth vs, that we
muſt aſke and praye for it of god.
For he whiche is not brought into
temptation, dothe not departe

from god. This thinge in no wyſe
can be in the power and ſtrengthe
of fre wyll:Agenſt fre wyll. ſuche is the weaknes
now of man. It was in his power
& frewil, before he dyd fal. Which
ſtrength, & power of frewyll, howe
greate and ſtronge it was, in the
firſt ſtate, & condition of mankind
when he was fyrſt made,Man in his fyrſt creatiō had fre wil. it dothe
appeare in thoſe aungels, whiche
when the deuyll, with his company
fell doune, dyd ſtand faſt in the
veritie, and ſo deſerued to come to
that certayntie, neuer for to falle,
in the whiche we do knowe for a
ſurety, that they are in, at this preſent.
But after the fall of the fyrſt
man, god woulde not haue it pertayne
to any other thynge, than to
his grace onely, that man ſhoulde
come to hym, and that alſoo, that
man ſhoulde not departe, and fall
from hym. This grace▪ God hath

ſet and leyde vp in him,Neither our commyng to god, nor 
                        〈◊〉

and purpoſe of him, which worketh
all thinge. And ſo by this reaſō, as
he dothe worke, that we ſhold com
vnto him, ſo dooth he woorke, that
we ſhulde not depart from hym.
               For the whiche cauſe it was ſayde
vnto him by the prophete. Let thy
hand be vpon the man of thi right
hande,pſalm. lxxix and vpon the ſonne of man

                     ad this man is not the firſt
Adam, in whom we dyd fall from
god, but it is the laſte Adam, vpon
whom the hand of god is, that we
ſhulde not depart from hym. For
Chriſt, with al his membres, defē
                  deth
ye church, which church is his
body, & his fulnes. Therfore when

the hand of god is vpon him, that
we ſhuld not depart from him, thē
doth the worke of god come vnto
vs. For this thinge is the hand of
god, becauſe it is done by the work
of god, that we may abyde ſtyll in
Chriſte with god, not as we were
in Adam departing, & going from
god. For in Chriſt we haue obteyned
the enheritance, we I ſay, whiche
ar predeſtinated after the purpoſe
of his wyll, which worketh al
thinges. This is therfore the hād
of god, and not our hande, that we
do not go from god, I do ſay, that▪
it is the hande of hym, which ſaid
I wyll geue my feare into theyr

me. For y• which cauſe, he wil haue
that men ſhal be ſeuters vnto him
& pray, that we be not led into temtation.
For if we be not broughte
into temptacion, we can by no meanes
depart from hym.
               
                  
This thynge he mighte haue gyuen
to vs without our prayer,The cauſe whyc god doth not giue it to vs that of our owne power we may come & abyde ſtyl in him. but
he wolde monyſh and warne vs bi
oure owne prayar, that we ſholde
knoledge of whom we do receue
theſe benefits. Of whome do we receue
thoſe benifytes, but of hym,
of whome we are commaunded to
cal and aſke for them. As toching
this matter lette the churche in no
wyſe loke for greate reſonyngs, &
long dyſputation but let it behold
and conſider oure dayle praiars.
The churche doth aſk and praie of
god, that the vnfaythful maye beleue
and be faythful. Then it is
god which doth conuert them to y•
fayth. The church doth pray that
thei which do beleue may continew

(ſaith he) is the

gyuen, according

he to me againe. Wherefore is he
not ſo, that is, mercifull toward al
men? Wherto, I aunſwer ſaying.
Bycauſe god is a iuſt iudge. And
by that reaſon, the grace, which he
doth giue, is geuen frely, without
any deſeruinge. And to the other
to whome grace is not geuen, it is
by his iuſte:Marke wel this doctrine and rightwiſe iudgement,
made manyfeſt & open, howe
greate a benefytte they do receaue
to whome grace is geuen. Therefore
lette vs not be vnthankefull,
bycauſe (accordinge to the pleaſure
of his wyll, to the laude and praiſe
of the glory of his grace) the great
mercye of god doth delyuer ſo manye
from damnation,If non were ſaued, we had, but right, and God dyd therein no wronge. whiche damnation
of right is dew vnto them
alſo, which are deliuered, ī ſo much
y• if he ſhuld deliuer none therfrō,
yet in ſo dīog he ſhuld do no wrōg.
For all men from one man, are iuſtly
iuged y• childrē of wrath to cō
                  nation,

and that not wrongfullye
nor agenſt iuſtice. Therefore, lette
that man, which is deliuered from
condemnation, make muche of the
grace of god, & he which is not beliuered
from the iuſt iudgemente
of god, let hym think & beleue, that
he hath receuid no wronge, but y•
thinge which he hath moſt rightwiſly
deſeruyd.
               Yf by the forgyuenes of the dette
the goodnis of god is declared &
made manifeſt,Herin is both the goodnes & ryghtwyſe iuſtice of god knowen & by the ſtreyghte
exactyng & demanding of his righte,
his equyte & iuſtyce knowē,
then can ther be none vnrightwiſnes
found in god.
               But then, for what cauſe (ſayth he
to me) is the iudgment of god in
yonge children ſo different, & in y•
two twynſe, as Iacob, and Eſau,
ſythe the on had no more cauſe thā
the other, but wer in al one cauſe

and had nether of them deſeruyd
better thā the other, nor worſe thā
the other? Ys it not a lyke queſtion
if I wold demand of the again,

for what pourpoſe, was the lyke,
and al one iudgement and ſentēce
wher the matter & cauſe, was not
lyke, but difference? Let vs therefore
cal to oure remembrans thoſe
workmem, which wrought in the
vyenyarde all the wholl daye, and
thoſe which wrought but one hower.
Here you do ſe, that there labour
is not al one, and yet the iudgement
in the paiemēt, which thei
receuid, was al on, as much to the
one, as to the other. What anſwer
was made to the workmen, whiche
were offendyd, bycauſe the other
had as greate a rewarde as theye▪
Dyd they heare any other anſwer
of ther mayſter but this: It is my
wyl, and pleaſure ſo to do. Syche

was his liberalitie to the one ſort,
that to the other he did no wrong.Theſe ſayinges, I wyll have it, percyneth to

And yet both of thē were counted
in the number of the godly.
               But as touching theſe twaine,
iuſtice, and grace, as concerninge
hym, which is ſaued, it maye well
be ſaide, I wyll haue it ſoo, and to
hym, whiche is condemned, it may
well be ſaide, take that thou haſte
deſerued, and go thy waies. For to
this man, wyll I gyue that whiche
is not his deuty to haue, but of my
liberalite. May not I do, what me
pleaſeth? Haſte thou a wycked eye
becauſe I am good? Nowe, if he
woulde ſaye to hym againe, and
aſke hym, wherfore god is not as
good to him, as to another: It mai
well be aunſwered to him. O thou
man, what art thou, which makeſt
this aunſuere to god, whom thou
perceiueſt towarde the other to be

tall, and in the, to be a ſtraight demaunder
of his ryghte? And yet
thou canſt not ſaye, that he is vniuſte,

               He whiche is delyuered from condemnation,
hath the greater cauſe

               Yet, let hym make, an other obiectiō

hath he not gyuen to ſomme men,
which haue faythfully beleued &
worſhipped hym,Aunſwere. the gyft of perſeueraunce,
and ſtedfaſtnes, to the
ende, that they myghte continewe
ſtyl in ther good beleffe to the end▪
Wherfore thinkeſt thou? But becauſe
he is no lyar, which ſaith they
went forthe from amonge vs, but
they were not of vs, for if thei had

byn of vs, they wold haue contynnuyd
ſtyl wyth vs. Are men then
made of two natures? God forbid,
Yf there were two naturs of men
then were the grace of god nothīg
then ſaluation, and delyueraunce
from condemnation, ſholde not be
of the fre gyft of god, if it wer the
deſeruinge of nature. To mans
iudgement it ſemeth, that al thoſe
men, which do apere good, & faith
ful oughte of dewtye to haue the
gyft of perſeuerance, & continuance
to the end, gyuen vnto them.
But god iudgeth a better waye
than that,wherefore doth god ſuffer the wycked and the godlye to be mixt together. and that it ſholde be a
thinge more conueniente for his
pourpoſe, to haue ſom among his
ſayintes, which wolde not contynew
to the ende. And alſo, that his
ſayntes ſholde not be carles, & wt 
out all feare, which is not profytable
for them ſo to be. For being in

this feare, doothe abate the arrogancy,God wyll haue his ſainctes to be alway in feare and pryde of men, that thei
ſhoulde not thinke ought of them
ſelfe, accordynge to the ſayinge of
the Apoſtell. Wherfore, that man,
whiche doth thinke hym ſelfe too
ſtand, lette him beware & take hede
that he falleth not. For he whyche
falleth, doth fall by his owne conſent,
and wyll:i. Corinth. x but he whiche ſtandeth,
doth ſtand by the wil of god.
For god is able to ſtable hym, and
to make him ſtedfaſte, & then not
he hym ſelfe,To fall is in mans power but to ſtande 
                        〈◊〉
                      not. but god. It is good
therefore, not to be hyghe mynded
nor to be to wyſe in a mans owne
ſelfe but to feare. For euerye man
in his knowledge, doth ether ſtand
or falle. For as the Apoſtell dothe
ſaye, whoſe ſayinge I haue reherſed
in my fyrſte booke, We are not
ſufficiente of oure ſelfe to thynke
anye thinge, as of oure ſelues, but

all our ſufficiencye is of god. The
whiche wordes: the bleſſed man
Ambroſe, was not afrayde to rehearſe,
as foloweth. For our hartes,
and our thoughtes (ſayth he)
are not in our owne power, as euery
humble and true faythfull man
knoweth to be true, and nothinge
more true.
               Theſe wordes Ambroſe dydde
ſpeake in a certayne booke whiche
he wrote entituled (of the flyenge
from the world) wherin he taught
that we ſhulde voyde & ſhone, the
incommodities of this worlde, not
with the body, but with the mynd.
               And that thinge he prouyd:
vnpoſſible to be done of oure ſelf
wtoute the helpe of god. For theſe
are his words. We do talke mich,
and make many wordes, howe we
ſhoulde flye, and aparte vs frome
thys worlde, but I woulde that

that our hartes, were as ware, and
as careful therfore, as our tonges
are buſy to talke therof. But there
is a worſe thing. For often tymes,
the entiſementes of the yerthly deſyres
do come ſtealing, and creping
on vs, and an heape of vanities
doth ouerwhelme our myndes, in
ſo muche, that, that thing, whiche
thou wuldeſt haue furtheſt of frō
the, thou do doeſt mooſt of all thinke
on,It is not the going into a cioiſter that putteth ſuch thinges oute of a mans mynde beynge therwith in thy mynde
moſte troubled, whiche is harde
for any man to beware of: and ſo
to put it clean out of his head, that
he be no more combered therwith,
it is vnpoſſible. And fynally, thou
mayſte ſooner wyſh, and deſire to
haue it taken from the, than to
bringe it to effect thy ſelfe, (as the
prophet witneſſeth) ſayinge. Inclyne,
& turne my hart to thy teſtymonies,
and not to auaryce. For

our hartes and thoughtes: ar not
in our owne power, which beinge
ſodenly ouerwhelmed, do confoūd
both our wittes, & our mindes, ſettinge
vs in that caſe, that we can
not tell, what to do, pluckinge and
drawynge our myndes otherwiſe
than we were purpoſed. They do
call vs awaye: other whyle, to ſeculyar
& worldlye buſines, they doo
thruſt worldlye matters into oure
heades, they do put vs in mynd of
ſuche, & ſuch pleaſures, diuers entyſementes
are layde before vs: ye
and when we are moſt readyeſt to
lyft vp our mynde, then being fylled
vp with ſuche vaine cogitations:
are often times ſodenly throwen
doune to the grounde. It is
not then in the power of man, that
men ſhuld be made the children of
of god, but in the power of god.

Therfore of the two yonge
chyldren, which are bounde, wyth
the bond of original ſyn, wherfore
the on is taken to mercy▪ and the
other not, and alſo, of ye it perſons
being both of lawful age▪ & bothe
wycked, why the one is ſo called, y•
he dothe followe the caller, & the other
ether is not called, or ells is
not ſo called, that he dothe followe
the caller: I ſay the iudgments of
god herein are inſerutable. But of

this one point al faythful mē muſt
be certayne,Predeſtination. and oute of doubte,
that the on of them, is predeſtined
the other not. For if they were of
vs, ſayde one of them, which were
predeſtyned and dronk this ſecret
out of the breſte of the lorde,i. Ihon. ij. they
wolde truly haue bydden ſtyll wt
vs. I praye you what is ment by
theſe words (they were not of vs,
for if they had bynne of vs, theye
wold haue taryed wt vs)? Were
theye not bothe creatyd of god?
               Came theye not bothe of Adam?
Were they not bothe made of the
yerthe, and receuyd of hym (which
ſayed, I mad al thinges, that hath
breathe) ſowls al of one nature, &
making, and fynally were thei not
both called? Did they not both folow
ye caller? wer thei not both iuſtified
from there owne wyckednes?
And wer thei not both renued
by ye foūtayn of regeneratiō beīg

ſo made new perſons? But if ſo be,
a man hard theſe wordes, whiche
knoweth what they are, & what y•
meaning of them is, he myght wel
aunſwere and ſaye, that all theſe
words are true. And after the reaſon
of theſe wordes, it can not be
denied: but that they were of vs.
But after another difference, & reſpect,
they were not vs. For if they
had ben of vs, they woulde haue
contynued with vs.For what cauſe wer thei not of them. What difference
is that I pray you, whiche
maketh that they are not of vs?
The bokes of god are open ynoughe,
that you may rede them. Let
vs not wynke, & ſhit our eyn from
thē. They were not of thē, bicauſe
they were not called after the purpoſe
of the caller. They were not
elected in Chriſt before the worlde
was made. They obteyned not the
enheritance in him. Thei were not

predeſtined accordinge to the purpoſe
of him, whiche doth worke al
thing. For if they had ben ſo, then
had thei ben of thē, & had without
doubt, continued ſtyl with them.
What ſhuld I ſay y• it is poſſible
to god, to conuert & tourn the frowarde
and malycyous myndes of
men to faythe, and ſo to woorke in
their hartes, that they ſhall gyue
place to none aduerſitie, nor yet by
any maner of temptation, departe
from god, forſomuch as he can (as
the apoſtle witneſſeth ſo woorke:
that he ſhall not ſuffer them to be
tempted more, and aboue that thei
are able for to beare.

Tyrus, and Sydon, ſholde
not haue byn condēned (although
they are more gently delt with all,
than thoſe cyttes, where our lorde
wroughte his myracles, and yet
was not beleued. For if thoſe myracles,

they had done penaunce ſitting in

If it ſhold be demanded of vs, for
what cauſe ſo great and many miracles,
wer wrought among them,
which miracles (for al y• they ſawe
them done before their eyes) wold
not beleue, or rather, wherfore they
wer not wrought among thē whiche
wold haue beleued, if thei had
ſen them? What ſhal we anſwere
therto? Shal we ſaye, as I ſayd in
a certaine boke, wherin I made
anſwere to ſyr queſtions, whiche y•
Paganſe dyd put vnto me, nothīg
preiudicating by myne anſwer the
cauſſes of predeſtination, whiche
cauſſes wyſe and ſober men maye
ſerche out? I dyd anſwer, as ye do
know wel, what tyme they demaū

of me the cauſe, why it was ſo
longe or Chriſte came, that at thoſ
tymes and in thoſe places, wher &
when his goſpel was not prechyd
he knew before, that al they at his

chinge ſhould be founde ſuche, as
were many at the time of his being
here in his corporal preſence, which
wolde not beleue in him, yea, when
he dyd rayſe vp the deade, forth of
their graue, giuinge lyfe agayn to
them, whiche had loſt it. Lykewiſe
in the ſelfe ſame boke, a littel after
I did ſay, about the ſame queſtion,
what meruayle is it (ſaid I) if that
Chriſt, when he knew before, howe
ful of vnfaithful people, the world
wold be in thoſe ages, woulde not
that his euangell ſhoulde be preached
vnto them, and that worthely,
whom he knew before, wold not be
leue, neither, that which he woulde
ſpeake, or worke. Thus much truly,
we cā not ſay of Tirus, & Sidon
& yet in them we do know, & fynd,
that the iugementes of god, do pertain
to ye cauſes of predeſtination.
Whiche cauſes, beynge ſecrete,

                  A Certain catholike
doctor,He recyteth a certain doctors mynde, whiche he derideth as folyſh. a man
of no ſmal name,
dooth expounde
this place of the
ſcripture, after
this wyſe, ſaying, that God knew
before that the Tirians, and Sydonites,
wold depart agayn from
the faith, after they ſhoulde haue
once receiued it thorowe the workynge
of myracles, and preaching
of the goſpell. And for that cauſe
(ſayde he) god hauynge pitie & cō
                  paſſion
ouer them, wuld not work
his myracles, and ſhewe his doctrine
among thē, becauſ they ſhuld

deſerue greater punyſſhmente, if
they had forſaken that faith, whiche
thei had once r
                     •
                  ceiued, than yf
thei had neuer beleued. What nedeth
me to tel, what things may be
noted, & gathered oute of this ſubtyl
wyſe mans ſaying, ſith that his
owne ſaying, (as he dooth ſpeake
the words) doth make for our purpoſe.
For if god moued with compaſſion,
and pittie, dyd not worke
his wonders among them, whereby
thei mightbe made faithful, leſt
they wuld offend more greuouſly,
whē they ſhold afterward forſake
it again, becauſe he knew before,
they wold forſake their ſaith, after
thei had receiued it: by that reaſon
is it openly declared, that no man
is iudged for thoſe d
                     •
                  edes, whiche
god knewe before he woulde haue
wrought afterward, if he be taken
away before he doth them, or ſome
otherwais is holpen, tha
                     •
                   he dothe

not commyt any ſuch offences, as
Chriſt dyd help the Tyryans & y•
Sydonits, if yt expoſitiō be treue,
whō he had rather ſhold not com
to the fayth, thā they afterward wt
a greater offence ſhoulde forſake
it, which thing, he knew before thei
wold do, if they had once com to it.
But yf you wyl ſaye againe vnto
me, for what cauſe dyd he not ſo
worke that they might beleue, and
that they myght alſo be taken out
of thys lyfe, before they ſhold falle
from the fayth, which they had receuyd,
I knowe not what anſwer
to make therto. For he which doth
ſay, yt thei which wold forſake ther
faith, had this benefit graunted, &
giuen vnto thē, that thei ſhold not
haue y• thing, which they wold wt
greater impietie▪ & wickednes, to
their iudgement caſt away, from

plaīly y• a mā is not iuged for

y• it is not don. Yt foloweth
then: yt that mā was prouided for &

ſaying: He was taken awaye
&c. But peraduenture, yeſame expoſytor,
wyl ſay agayn to me, Wherfore
then, wer not ye mē of Tyrus, &
Sidō prouided for, after that ſame
maner, that thei mighte beleue, & ſo
be taken out of this life leſt malice
ſhold alter their mīd. Truli as toching
this matter, I think it ſuffyciēt,
yt after his own wordes, & ſaing
I haue prouyd, yt mē
                  ▪ ar not iudged
for ani thinge, which the
                     •
                  e haue not
don, although y• forknoledg of god
knew that thei wold do it if theye
had lengar lyued. For as I ſayd before
(although it is ſhame to ſpend
any longe tymme in wryghtinge

againſt this opynion, that men at
iudged for thoſe dedes, which thei
ar knowen before that they wolde
do, if they myght haue ſpace of life
to do thē, yet becauſe we ſholde in
no wyſe apere, and ſeme to beare
with it or any thinge alow it, we
thought it more convenyent and

               The .xi. Chapter
               
                  ANd therfor (as
the Apoſtell
doth ſaye) it is
not in him whiche
willeth nor
in hym whiche
roneth, but in
god, whiche taketh mercy, whiche

doth prouyd for yonge chyldren,
acording to his own wyl and pleaſure,
for whome he wyl, which yōg
chyldren do nether wyll nor roon,
whom he hath choſen in Chryſt, before
the foundacion of the world,
gyuing alſo hys grace to thē frely
without any of ther deſeruinge, or
merites preceding his grace, ether
of ther fayth, or of workes. And
as toching thoſe, which are of age
although he doth knowe, that thei
wolde beleue, yf myracles, were
wrought among them, yet whom
he wyl not, them he doth not helpe,
of whom in his predeſtinatiō whiche
is vnknowen & hid vnto vs, he
hath otherwyſe determined and
iudged, & that iuſtly. For there is
none vnryghtwyſnes with god.
Hys iudgements ar inſcrutable, &
hys wayes vnable to be ſerchyd &
found out. For al the waies of the

lorde, are mercy, & veryte, Then is
his mercy inueſtigable by y• which
he hath mercy on whom him pleaſeth,
wtout any of ther merytts or
deſeruīges, for the which he ſhold
rewarde them agayn. And this veryte
is inueſtigable, by y• which he
dothe obdurat, and harden whom
hym pleaſeth, and that thorow the
meryts, and deſeruing of thē whiche
are ſo obdurated, whiche are
the merits, and deſeruing alſo of
them, of whom he taketh mercy as
wel as of them, whome he hath hardenyd.
As by example we do find
in Iacob, and Eſau, the on being
takeng to mercy,Oure merits & deſeruing to goo warde are all one of goodnes the other not, and
yet as ther merytts, & deſeruinges
were all one▪ ſo was not there end.
Of the whiche twayn, he one of
them, was delyuered by the goodnis
of god: that other was cōdemnyd
by the iuſtyce & rightwyſnes
of god. Shal we ſay, y• god is not

iuſte? God forbid. But his ways
ar inueſtigable. And therfor ī thoſ,
which are ſauyd, let vs beleue the
mercy of god, and in thoſe whiche
are condemned let vs beleue the
ryghtwyſnes of god. wtout anye
doubtinge. Nether let vs reaſone
after thoſe thinges, which are not
able to be anſwered, nor ſerch after
that, whiche can not be found out
For out of the mouth of infantes,
and yong lukkinge chyldren doth
he ſet forth his prayſe, that that
thing, which we do ſe in theſe, beīg
ſaued, which had no meryts, wher
with thy might deſerue ſaluation,
and in thoſe which are condemnid
by the merits of origynal ſynne,
preceding there condemnation, we
ſhold not doubt, but it is alſo the
very lyke in thoſe which ar of age.
That is to ſay, that we ſhold not
think, that ani man doth firſt ani
works, wherby, he obteineth ſalua

nor yet, that any man is damnyd,
without his own meryts, whither
ther cauſes ar al one, or diuers (as
I haue ſayde before) that he whiche
doth ſtand, maye take hede, he
doth not fal, and he whiche reioyſeth,
may reioyſe in the lorde, & not
in him ſelfe.
               But what is the matter, that theſe
men, whiche do holde with vs againſt
the Pelagians, as tochinge
original ſyn, which ſyn, by one mā
enterid into the worlde, and by on
man, al men, are gon into condemnation▪
wherfore wyll theye not
graunt, that the cauſe of ſaluatiō
and damnation, which is in yonge
chyldren, ſholde not be compared,
and lykened, vnto the cauſe, which
is in perſons of more age. This
thinge the Manaches alſo do not
vnderſtond, which do not only ſet
lyghte by the teſtimonies of y• olde

teſtament, but alſo thoſe ſcriptur
                     •
                  
whiche are of the new teſtamente▪
(as though they had a priuiledge
to do with them, what thei wolde)
they do abuſe at their own pleſur.
For they wyl take, & forſake, what
them lyſteth, as they ſhal appeare
to make or marre for, or agaynſte
their pourpoſe, alowing or diſalowinge
them. Agenſt thoſe Manaches.
I dyd wryte in the bookes,
whiche I wrote vpon fre wyll, out
of the whiche bokes, theſe men do
take hold agenſt me. And wher as
in the ſayde bokes, many greate
and weighty queſtions cam in the
waye, beſyde the principal matter,
I wold not dyſcuſſe them exactly,
nor go thorough with them, leaſt
the work ſhuld haue ben to great,
and ſpecially, becauſe I ſawe, that
the authoritie of the holy ſcriptures,
dyd preuayl nothyng, agenſt

ſuch peruerſt & vngodly perſons.
And yet I myghte (as I dyde althoughe
I dyd not expreſly and
plainly determyne the verytie of
euery on of thoſe matters) after a
certayn faſhyon conclud that god
is in al thinges to be prayſed, with
out any neceſſyte, that I ſhold beleue
(as they wold haue vs) that
there ar two ſubſtances coeternal
both to gyther, of good, and euyll,
in god.
               To be ſhort, in my fyrſt boke of retractations,
which worke ye haue
not yet red, when I cam to retract
thoſe boks, whiche I dyd wryght
vpon frewyl I, ſpake after thys
wyſe. In theſe bokes (ſayde I), are
dyſputed ſo manye matters, that
many queſtions do com betwene,

god was alwaye beleued, at the
leſt, he was declared, in al thinges
to be prayſed. For truly I toke ye
dyſputatiō in hand bycauſe of thē
which do denye that the originall,
and beginning of oure euel, commyth
of fre wyl, which alſo do earnyſtly
hould, & defende, that god
being the maker of al naturs,The Manaches errour. is to
be blamed, entēding according to
ther wycked error (I do mean the
Manaches) to introduce, and brīg
in this 
                     •
                  oulle error, that there is in
god a certayn natur of euyl, which

is immutable, coeternall, & euerlaſtinge
with him. And a litel after in
an other place, I ſaid theſe words.
I dyd ſpeake (ſaide I) of the miſery,
which ſynnars moſt rightwiſly
ſuſteyne, (rom the whiche men are
delyuered, by the grace of god. For
man can fall by him ſelfe, that is to
ſaye, by his own frewill, ſo can he
not ryſe vp again. Vnto the which
miſery of iuſt damnation,Ignoraunce & blyndnes of harte are borne and brought with us, into thys Worlde. ignorāce
& hardnes of hart do pertayn, whiche
diſeaſes, al mankinde hath, euē
from the begynning of his byrth.
And from this euyll, no man is delyuered,
but by the grace of god.
               This miſery of blyndnes, & hardnes,
the pelagians do denye for to
com
                     •
                  , & procede of iuſt damnation.
For thei do denie originall ſynne,
And as touchynge ygnoraunce, &
hardnes of hart, yf they wer nothīg
els, but the natural begynnyng of

man▪ yet god is not to be blamed,
but to be prayſed, according to my
diſputatiō, in that ſame third boke
whiche diſputation, ſhulde be had
agenſt ye Manaches, which do not
vnderſtond the ſcripturs of the old
teſtament, by the whiche, originall
ſynne is declared and taught. And
what ſoeuer is redde therof in the
writinges of the Apoſtels, they do
ſaye, with a deteſtable, and ſhameles
bouldnes, that thoſe their wrytynges
are depraued, and corrupted,
of ſyche, as haue thruſt ſuch ſē
                  tences
into their writynges, as
thoughe the apoſtell dyd not ſpeke
and write all thoſe wordes, whiche
are found in their writinges.
               But agenſt the Pelagiās, we muſt
defende, that there is original ſyn,
which the ſcripturs, both olde, and
new, do confirme. And yet thei ſay
that they do profeſſe, & hould with
the ſcriptures, as well as we.

Theſe wordes did I ſpeake in my
firſt boke of retractation, when I did
cal in, thoſe bookes, whiche I
made of fre wyll.
               And beſide theſe wordes whiche
I haue reherſed,Auguſtine retractethe his bokes of free wyll. I did ſpeak mich
more, as touching thoſe bookes of
frewyll, which I thought to longe
to reherſe in this work, and not neceſſary,
as ye wyll (I knowe well)
ſaye, when ye haue red them all.
               Therfore althoughe in the thyrde
boke, which I wrote vpon fre wyl,
our diſputation was ſuch, as touching
yong children, that although
it were true, that the Pelagiās do
ſay, that ignorance, & hardnes (wt
                  out
the which no man is born into
this world) are but the natural begynnyngs,
of euery man, & not rather
the poniſhment of natur, yet y•
Manaches, ſhould be ouercome, &
put to ſilence, whiche do hold, that

ther ar in god two natures, that is
to ſay, of good, & euyl, from before
the begynnyng coeternal. But although
that were trewe, that ignoraūce
and hardnes, are but the naturall
beginninge of humayne nature,
and not the punyſſhmente, or
pain of that ſame nature (as it is
in dede) ſhould therfore our fayth,
which the catholyke church dothe
defend, againſt the Pelagians, be
forſaken,Ignoraunce and hardnes is the payne iuged to the nature of man, for his fyrſt fall. or doubted of, which doth
holde, that there is original ſynne:
the gylte, or faute where of, beinge
got to vs, by our firſt generation,
can none otherwiſe be loſed, but by
the ſeconde byrth, which is our regeration?
And therfore if theſe our
brethren doo confeſſe that ſame (as
we do) for to be true▪ that we & they
both together, may deſtroy y• error
of the Pelagians, wherfore ſholde
thei doubt, but that god doth pluk

yonge chyldren (to whome he doth
giue his grace, by the ſacrament of
baptime) from the poure of darkenes,
tranſportynge them, into the
kyngdome of the brightnes of his
ſon? Therfore in that he doth gyue
his grace to ſome, and to ſome not,
wherfore do they not therin, ſynge
laude, and praiſe to the mercy and
iudgement of the lorde. But whye
he dothe gyue it to one more than
to an other, who knoweth the mind
of the lorde? Who is able to ſerche
his inſcrutable iugments? Who is
able to ſeke out his ways, which ar
inueſtigable?
            
            
               The .xii. Chapter
               
                  IT is thē ſufficiētly proued
yt ye grace of god is
not gyuen after the merits
of thē, but after ye
pleaſure of his wyll, to

the praiſe, & glory of his grace, that
he, which doth reioyſe, may reioyce:
not in him ſelfe, but in the lorde,
which doth gyue his grace, to whō
it pleaſeth hym becauſe he is merciful.
And although, that he wolde
not gyue it, yet: were he not therefore
vniuſt. Alſo he doth giue it to
none, but to whome it is his wyll
to geue it, that he may make knowen
the ryches of his glorye vpon
the veſſels of mercye.Grace is not in his righte kind, except it come frely. For in that
he doth geue it to ſome, whiche do
not deſerue, therin he wil ſhew his
grace to be fre, without deſeruyng▪
& ſo to be grace in the right kinde.
And again in that he doth not giue
his grace to al men, he doth declare
what al mē do deſerue. He is good
in his liberalitie towarde ſome, he
is iuſte in takynge punyſhment vpon
the other: and yet he is good
in all thinge. For it is a good

thinge when that deuty & right is
payde. And he is iuſt in all thinge.
For it is a iuſt thinge, when that y•
deutye, and right is payd, without
doinge wronge to anye man. But
we do hold, & defend, that the grace
of god is geuen withoute meryts.
And that is in dede, the ryght, and
true grace. And althoughe it were
true, as the pelagians do ſay, that
yong chyldrē which ar taken out of
this lyfe after thei are baptyſed, are
not deliuered & pluckt away from
the power of darknes, becauſe thei
had no ſynne in them, wherof they
ſhulde be gyltie (as they do think)
but yt they ar no more but tranſpoſed,
The pelagians do deny original ſyn in yong chyldren.
& takē out of this lyfe, into the
kyngdome of the lorde, yea & ſo it
is graunted, that the kingdome of
god is gyuen frely, withoute anye
merits, or good workes, & to whō
it is not giuen, it is not wtout their

euyll merits: that they haue it not.
And thus do we make aunſwer, agenſte
the Pelagians, when they
do obiect vnto vs, caſtyng vs in y•
teth, that we do attribute: & aſcribe
grace vnto deſteny, becauſe we ſay
that it is not gyuen after oure merits.
But they rather do make the
grace of god in yonge children to
be deſtenye, whiche do ſaye, that
wher as no merit, or deſeruing is,
there is deſtenye. For accordynge
to the ſaying of the pelagians, ther
can be found no merits in younge
chyldren, for the which, ſome of thē
are ſent vp to heauen, and ſom ſhit
forth from thens. And lykewiſe, as
I haue declared, and proued now,
that the grace of god is not giuen
after any merit (whiche thinge I
thought good to proue, as well by
their own wordes, & ſayinges, as
by our iudgements & mindes, that

is by our opinion,The pelagians do call originall ſyn, nothynge els but a natural infirmitie & weakenes. which do hould
that yonge children ar born in original
ſyn, and by theirs, which do
deny, y• there is original ſyn. And
yet, for all that we haue made our
matter good, and prouid it trew bi
ther owne ſaying, we muſte in no
wyſe doubte, but that yonge chyldren
haue in them that whiche he
muſt forgeue to them, which doth
ſaue his people from ther ſynnes.
Euen ſo, was I fayn in the thyrde
boke, whiche I dyd wright on frewyl,
to reſyſt the Manaches with
ther owne ſayings, as well, as wt
oure demonſtrations & proffes about
that queſtion, whyther ignorance
& hardnes of harte were the
ponyſhment of oure nature, comming
of iuſte damnatyō (as we do
ſaye) or ells, as thei do ſay, nothing
other, than naturali infyrmitie &
weaknes perteinīg naturally to al

men (for no man is borne without
them, or naye. And yet I am not
of there mynd. And alſo in yt ſame
boke I proued ſuffycyently yt ignorance,
& hardnes of harte, ar not ye
natural beginnyngs of man, as he
was fyrſt inſtituted & made, but yt
it is the playn ponyſhment of mā
whiche is condemnyd. Therfore
they do labor in vaine, in yt thei do
go about to bring yt my bok (which
I wrot a greate whyle ago) nowe
againſt me, that I ſhold not nowe
diſpute the cauſe of yong chyldern
as I ought to do, and ſo to proue
euydently (that al men maye ſe, &
perceue the truth) that the grace of
god is not gyuē for the meryts of
men.
               For, and if, what tyme I dyd begynne
fyrſt to wryght thoſ bokes
which I dyd wryght vpō fre wyll

being at Rome, whē I was a temporal
man, & endyd them in Afrik,
after I was preſt, I had byn (as
they do ſay) in doubt, as tochinge
the condemnation of infants, not
regeneratyd, yet I do think no mā
to be ſo vniuſt, but he could be content,
y• I ſhold amend & increaſe in
knolege, rather thā to contynue alwaye
in doubt. But yet if it hadde
pleaſed them, they myght haue vnderſtod
the matter other wyſe: that
I dyd not then doubt therof, asthough
I had doubted in ded, but
bycauſe I thought that waie beſt
to ouercome the aduerſarys, that
whyther ignoraunce, and hardnes
of heart were the ponyſſhmente of
the original ſyn, which is in chyldren
(as the truth is) or not, as many
being out of the right waye do
ſuppoſe, yet for al that, the error of
the manaches, could not make vs

to beleue, that there is a myxture
of two contrary naturs in god, of
good & euyl. God forbyd we ſhold
be ſo negligent, in the cauſe of yōg
chyldren, that we ſhold doubt whither
thoſe chyldren, which do dye
after thei be regeneratid, do depare
to eternal ſaluation, and they whiche
are not, to the ſecond deth. For
that ſame ſcripture (by on mā ſyn
enteryd into the worlde, & by ſinne
death, and ſo into al men) can non
otherwyſe be vnderſtonded. And
alſo, from eternal death, whiche is
moſt worthely rewarded for ſyn:
no man, olde, or yong, can be deliuered,
except he, whiche ſuffered
death for to forgeue both our original,
and oure owne ſyn alſo (hauing
in him ſelf no maner of ſyn)
doth delyuer vs. But wherfore
he doth deliuer ſom, more thā ſom,
I haue tould you diuerſe tyms, &

yet wyl tel the agayne.Romanos. ix O thou mā
what are thou, which wylt reaſon
with god? Hys iugments ar inſcrutable,
& hys ways ar inueſtigable.
And more, than that, I wyll ſaye
vnto the▪ Serche not for thoſ thinges
which do excede thy capacyte,
and ſuch thinges as are myghtiar,
& ſtronger, thā thy ſelfe, m
                     •
                  del not
with them. Do ye not ſe, how foul
an hereſy it is, & how farre from y•
purnes of our faythe, to hold opynyon,
that yong chyldren whē thei
do depart hens, do receue ther iudgment,
acording to thoſe workes,
which god knewe before that thei
wold do, if they had lyued, any lenger
tyme on the yerth? Into this error,
(which, al men hauing any reaſon
in the worlde, & ſpecially thoſe
whiche haue profeſſed Chriſte, do
abhore) ar they conſtreyned to fall
in, which haue ſo forſaken the pelagiās
errors, yt yet they do think it

neceſſary to be beleued, yea and wt
dyſputation to be defended, yt the
grace of god, thorow Chryſt Ieſu
(by the which only, after the fal of
our fyrſt parent we are holpen), is
rewarded after oure merytts and
deſeruinges. Whiche error Pelagyan
him ſelfe did improue, and
condēne before y• byſhops of y• eaſt
cōtry, whē they dyd ſit in iudgmēt
vpō him for fear leſt he ſhold haue
bin condēned of them if he had not.
But if this their opiniō is not tru,
nor to be ſpoken, as concernynge y•
workes of them whiche be deade,
whiche workes they wolde haue
done, if they had liued, good or bad
(& by that reaſon, beyng no works
at al, bicauſe thei were in the foreknowledge
of god, y• thei ſhuld neuer
be) if this then I ſay ought not
to be ſpoken (which you ſe how erronyous
it is to be ſaide) what els
dothe folowe, but that the grace

of god is not geuen after our merits,
& that we ſhuld ſo (without any
further darke reaſoninge thereon)
confes it, as the catholike churche
doth defend it to be, agenſt the
hereſy of y• pelagians, which thing
we do fynde moſt euydent, & open
in yonge infantes. For god is not
conſtreined to helpe ſome chyldren
more than ſome, by any deſtine, for
ſomuch, as their cauſe, & matter is
al one,By the prouidence of god all is ordeined & gouerned, not by deſtenye. the one no better than the
other. Nor yet muſt we thinke
that the worlde is gouerned, by
thinges, which do com by chaunce,
or by a natural māer of proceding
of things here in this world, but
by y• prouydēce of god, forſomuch
as al reaſōable ſouls muſt ether be
ſauid or dānyd, & alſo not ſo much
as a lyghtel ſparow can fal doune
to the ground, with out the wyl of
oure father, whiche is in heauen.

Or ells the neglygence of the parents
ſhold be blamid, being imputed
to ther faut, that ther childrē
do depart without baptim, ſo that
by this reaſon, the iudgmente of
god herin ſholde haue nothinge to
do, as thoughe thoſ children, which
do departe in ſo euel a ſtate, had
choſen to them ſelfe by there own
wyll ſuche neglygente parentes of
whom they ſhold come.
               What nede haue I to tel you, how
that often tyms, a yong chylde, before
he can be baptiſed, dothe dye?
Yea & often tyms the parents, making
neuer ſo much haſt, that the
childe myghte be chriſtened, yet y•
wyl of god was not, that it ſholde
come to the fountaine of regeneration,
whiche did not kepe y• chylde
in the worlde ſo long that it might
come. Yea & alſo we do ſe, that the
chyldren of thoſe, which ar vnfaithful,

haue bynne kepte alyue tyl the
tym, that they haue com to baptim
and the children of the faythfull
haue not. In this poynt treuly is
declared, that god doth not accept
on perſon more than another. For
if he were an acceptor of perſons,
be wold rather delyuer the childrē
of thoſ, which at his worſhippars
than of thoſ which at his enmies.
            
            
               The xiii. Chapter
               
                  BVt nowe forſomuche
as we do
reaſon & diſpute
of the gift of perſeuerance
to the
ende, what is the
matter▪ that the chylde which departeth
without baptyme, is not
baptyſed before he departeth? And
agayn, what is ye cauſe, yt he, which
is baptyſed, and wyl fale after his

baptyme, is not taken oute of this
lyfe, before he doth fal? Except we
wyll ſtond ſtyl in that inconvenience,
yt we wyl ſaye, it proffetethe
a man nothing to be taken oute of
thys lyfe, before he doth fal, forſomuch,
as he ſhal be iudged (as they
ſaye) according to the deds which
god knewe before, that he wold do
if he had lyued ani lengar tyme.
What man can paciently abyd to
hear this deueliſh madnes,Into what blynd errors the opiniō of merits, doth bringe men. which
is ſo much againſt our fayth? And
yet, they are conſtrained ſo to ſaye,
which are of that opinion, yt grace
is gyuen acording to our merits.
For they whiche wyl contend and
hould that euery man, which dieth
is iudged acording to thoſ works
which god knew that he wolde do
if he had bin ſufferid to haue liued
lengar time, if they wold (I ſay) cō
                  ſyder
how falſly and vntruly, thei

do ſpeake, they ſhal haue no cauſe
to affyrme that, whiche Pelagian
hathe condemnyd, which error the
church cauſed hym to denye, that y•
grace of god, is gyuen after oure
merits, ſyth that they do ſe ſomme
chyldren, not beinge regenerated
goinge to condemnation, & ſom
which ar regenerated, to eternall
lyfe. And agayn, ſyth that they do
perceue, & ſe, that of thoſe which ar
regenerated, ſom do perſeuer to y•
end, & ſo do departe henſe, & ſom agayne
after ther regeneration, are
kept in this world tyl they do fall,
& then in that fall they do departe,
whiche ſholde not haue fallen if
they had byn taken from this preſeu
                     •
                  
lyfe, before that they dyd fall,
and alſo, that ſome, after they are
fallen do not depart hens, tyl they
com into the waye agayn, whiche
wyth out doubt ſholde peryſhe, if

they had dyed before they did repente
and amend. By the whiche
thinge it is manyfeſtlye declared
vnto vs, that the grace of god (by
the which grace, we do both begin
to do well, and alſo continewe to y•
end) is not gyuen after our merits
but it is gyuen to vs frely, after
his moſt iuſte, lyberal & wyſe wyl
& pleaſure, bycauſe whom he hath
predeſtined, them alſo hath he called,
with that vocation, wherof it
is wrytten, and ſayd (The gyftes
& vocation of god, ar without repentance)
vnto the which vocatiō
no man can tell, what man dothe
perteyne, ſo longe as he is in thys
worlde, but when he departethe
from hence. Therfore in thys lyfe
which is nothinge but temtation
vpon the yerth, he which thinketh
hym ſelfe to ſtand▪ let hym take
hede he doth not fall. And for this

cauſe (as I haue ſayd before) thoſe
perſons,For what cauſe hathe god myxt the wycked amonge the godly which ſhal not perſeuer &
contynew to the ende, are myxt among
thoſe which ſhal contynew:
which thinges done by the moſte
wyſe & prouydent counſel of god,
that we maye lerne not to be highe
in oure own wyſdom, but that we
may conſenting to thoſe, which ar
lowly in ſpyrite, worke with feare
and trembeling our owne helthe,
For God is he, which doth worke
both the wyl, and alſo the ded, and
worke of the wyl. It is expedient
and proffytable for vs, both to ſay
ſo, and to beleue ſo. This is godli:
this is trewe: that we maye make
an humble, and a lowly confeſſion
that al the whole, withoute reſeruing
ani part therof vnto vs, mai
be gyuen, and aſcribed to god. For
we do fyrſt thinke & afterward beleue,
we do fyrſt think & afterward

ſpeke, we do fyrſt thinke & afterwarde
work, and do what we do.
And as toching the right and treu
waye of godly liuing & ye true ſeruyce,
and worſhypping of god we
are not able to thinke any thinge
of oure ſelfe,Oure hartes & thoughte
                        •
                      ar not in our power. as of our ſelfe, but al
oure ſufficyenci, and al our habelnes
is of god. For our harts, and
our thoughts, are not in our own
powr. And therfore ſaynt Ambroſ
doth ſaye, what man is ſo bleſſed,
whiche dothe continualy aſſend &
ryſe alwaye in his harte. But how
can this thing be don, without the
help of god? By nomeans forſoth.
Forthermore, the ſayd godly man
ſpeking and treating vpō the ſaid
ſcripture alledged theſe words of
the pſalmyſt, which ar, That man
is bleſſed,Pſal. lxxxiii whoſe helpe is from the
O lorde, and whoſe aſſendynge,
and ryſynge vppe in harte, is of

the

                  . The cauſe wherfore he ſayde
ſo, he dyd not only fynde, in the holy
ſcripture, but he felte it, in his
own hart. Therfore, thoſe wordes,
whiche are ſpoken by the miniſter,
at the time of the miniſtration of y•
ſacrament, commaunding vs, that
we ſhould lift vp our hartes vnto
god, that very ſame thing, which is
(to lyfte vp our hartes to god) is
the gift of god, for the which gifte▪
they are admoniſhed of the preiſte,
to geue thākes vnto god, to whoſe
wordes▪ they do make aunſwere, &
ſay (it is worthy, and righte, that it
be ſo). Forſomuch therfore, as our
hartes, are not in our owne poure,
but are lyfte vp by the help of god
that they maye aſſend, & ryſe vp, &
ſo vnderſtond, & be wiſe in heauenly
thinges,Coloſ. iii. where Chriſt is, ſitting
on the right hand of the father, &
not in yearthly and worldlye thynges,

who doth deſerue to haue thā
                  kes
for that ſame, but he only whiche
doth the thinge, our lorde god,
whiche by ſo great his benefits, delyueryng
vs, hath choſen vs from
the bottom of this worlde, & predeſtened
vs, before the foundacion of
the worlde was layde.
            
            
               The .xiiii Chapter.
               
                  BVt they do ſaye,
yt the declaration
& openinge of the
matter of pred
                     •
                  ſtination,
Obiection. is a thing
whiche hyndereth
& is much againſt the right order
of preachi
                     •
                  ge.Aunſwer. As though the preching
and teaching of the Apoſtel
was let, & hyndered therby. Dyd
not the doctor & maiſter of the gentyls,
faythfully, and truely, manye

tymes commend,By the teaching of thapoſtel he proueth the doctrine of predeſtination to be byd. & praiſe predeſtination,
and yet ceaſſed not to prech
and teach the word of god? I pray
you, becauſe he ſaide, that god is y•
worker in vs, both of the wyl, and
of the worke alſo, according to hys
owne good wyll, dyd he therefore
not exhort them (to whom he ſpake
thoſe wordes) that they ſhuld both
wyll, and deſyre, yea and to worke
thoſe thinges, which ar acceptable
& pleaſaunt vnto god? Or els, bycauſe
he ſaid, that he, whiche began
that good worke in you, wyll alſoo
perfourme it, & bringe it to an end
in you, euen tyll the daye of oure
lorde Ieſu Chriſt, did he not for al
that, exhorte, and counſel men, both
to the begynnynge and to the continuance
therein to the ende? The
lorde alſo hym ſelfe commaunded
men to beleue, ſaying: If ye do beleue
in god, then beleue in me. Yet

that ſame ſentence was not falſe,
nor the definition therof, vnprofytable,
whiche the ſame lorde, ſpake
alſo, ſayinge: No man commeth to
me, that is to ſaye, no man beleueth
in me, but to whom it is geuen of
my father. And againe, it doth not
folowe, becauſe this diffinition is
true, that therfore the commaunde
mente, that they ſhould beleue, is
voyde or vnprofitable.
               For what cauſe then, ſhould we
thinke, that the openinge of predeſtination,
ſhulde be the cauſe, that
men myghte not preache and teach
and in preachinge, commaund, exhorte,
reproue, yea, and correcte,
whiche thinges are muche vſed in
the ſcripture, wherin predeſtinatiō
is commēded, & ſet forth vnto vs?
As there any man ſo bolde, whiche
wyl ſaye, that god did not knowe

before, to whome he woulde gyue
the gyft, to beleue? Or ells, that he
knewe not before, what they were,
whom he would giue to his ſonne,
of whō he ſhuld leaſe none? Which
thinges, if god knewe before, he
knew alſo before, thoſe his benefites,
by the which benefites, he doth
vouchſafe to delyuer them.What is predeſtination.
               
               This predeſtination of ſaintes,
is nothinge elles but a foreknowlege,
and a preparation, of the benefits
of god, by the whiche benefites,
al men are ſaued, which haue
& ſhall obteine ſaluacion. Al other
beſyde theſe, in what caſe are they
                     •
                  
& wher are they left, but in the dow
of perdition, and that by the moſte
iuſte, & right iugement of god. In
that ſame ſtate & condition, were y•
people of Tyrus and Sidon left,
whiche might alſo haue beleued, if
they had ſeene thoſe greate ſygnes

& miracles of Chriſte: whiche he
wrought. But bycauſe it was not
gyuen to theim,The cauſe why the people of Tire & Sydō, did not beleue. that they ſhoulde
beleue: the ſygnes & tokens, wherby
they myght haue ben broughte
to beleif, were withdrawen, & kepte
awaye from them, & denied them.
By this a man may perceaue, that
many men, naturally, haue ſuch an
heuenly gyft of vnderſtandinge, yt
they maye thereby, be moued to the
faith▪ if eyther they be taughte by
wordes, or elles do ſ
                     •
                   ſygnes, & tokens,
accordinge to the diſpoſition
of their minds. And yet for al that
yf they be not, by the profounde, &
depe iugemente of god, thoroughe
the predeſtination of grace, ſeparated
from the dow of perdition, they
are ſuffered nether to hear the wordes,
nor to ſe the meruellouſe workes,
wherby thei myght be broght
to faythe, yea, nor yet they cannot

beleue, although, thei did both here
and ſe them. In that ſtate of perdition,
were the Iewes lefte, whiche
coulde not beleue the great works
and wonderous vertues, whiche
thei ſaw wrought before ther eyes.
The cauſe wherfore thei could not
beleue, the euangill doth not hyde
from vs, ſayinge (when he hadde
wrought ſo great wonders & ſygnes,
among them, they beleuyd not
in hym, that the ſaying of Eſay the
prophet, myght be fulfylled, which
he ſpake ſayinge, (who hath gyuē
credyt and beleif, to that which we
haue harde? Or to whome is the
arme of the lorde knowen? And
therfore they coulde not beleue, for
Eſay ſayd more 
                     •
                  He hathe ſhyt vp
their eyes, & hardened their hartes,
that they ſhoulde not ſe with their
eyes, nor vnderſtande with theyr
hartes, & conuert, & be healed.
               
                  
The eyen, & hartes of the people
of Tyrus & Sydon, were not ſhyt
vp, and hardened after ſuch a faſhion,
for they woulde haue beleued,
if they had ſeene the ſygnes, & wonders,
whiche theſe men dyd ſe:
               But it profyted them nothyng,
that they coulde haue beleued,
bicauſe they weare not predeſtened
of hym, whoſe iugementes are
inſcrutable: & whoſe waies are not
to be ſerched out. And again it ſhulde
not haue hyndered thother, yt
they coulde not beleue, if they had
ben ſo predeſtened, that god would
lyghten their eyes which were blinded,
& molefy ye ſtony hartes of thē
which were hardened. But as touching
that, which the lord ſpake, of
ye Tirians & the Sidonites, it mai
peraduenture ſome otherwayes be
taken & vnderſtanded. But yt now

no man dothe come to Chriſte, but
to whome it is geuen, & that it is
gyuen to them, which ar elected in
him,It profeteth ſmall to here with thy fleſhly eares, yf the eares of thy ſoule be ſtop
                        •
                     . before the foundacion of the
world, euerye man doubtles, wyll
confes, which with their fleſſhely
eares, do heare the worde of god,
what he dooth ſaye therein, yf the
eares of their harts be not ſtopped
and made deaffe. And yet this predeſtination,
whiche is ſet forth opē
                  ly,
by the wordes of the goſpel, did
not hynder, & let the lorde to counſel
and exhorte men to begyn to do
well, when he ſaide, yf ye do beleue
in god beleue in me. Nor yet, when
he exhorted theym to the perſeueraunce
in that faith, in commaundynge
them alwaye to praye, and
neuer to fayle.
               Thoſe perſons to whom it is giuē
to both heare the wordes, & work
therafter. But they, to whome it is

not gyuen, whyther they do heare
or here not, do worke not a whytt
the more. For to you it is gyuen
(ſayth he) to know the myſteries &
ſecretes of the kyngdom of god,
but to them it is not gyuen. The
fyrſt parte of this ſame ſayinge of
the lorde, perteyneth to mercy and
compaſſion, the latter part therof,
perteyneth to the iudgment, and
rightwyſ iuſtyce of hym, to whom
our ſoule doth ſaye,He concludeth by the example of the doctryne of Chriſte and of his apoſtels, that predeſtination, hindereth nothynge to teachinge of good liuinge I wyl ſyng &

working therafter) ſholde not be
hynderyd by the preachinge and
teachinge of predeſtination. (For
how ſhold they here wtout a precher,

nor yet by the preachinge of
faith, which teacheth how we ſhuld
begynne to beleue,The effecte and ende of the doctrine of predeſtinacion. & continue ther
in, the teaching of the article of predeſtination
ſhulde be miniſhed or
hyndered, that by the teachinge of
the ſaied predeſtination, he whiche
lyueth faithfully, and obedientlye,
ſhoulde not be proud of his obedyence,
as though it were of him ſelf,
and not the gift of god: but that he
which reioyſeth may reioyſe in the
lorde. For, we muſt be proud of nothinge:
forſomuch as nothinge is
our owne to be proude of. This
thinge the holye father Cyprian
dyd perceiue verye well, and was
boulde to affirme that ſame, by the
which he taught, and opened moſt
certaine predeſtination. For if we
muſt be proud of nothing, becauſe
nothing is our own, truly no man
can be proud of his obedience, and

good lyfe, be it neuer ſo perfect and
ſtedfaſte. Nor yet muſte we call it
ours, as though it were not giuen
to vs of god from aboue. For it is
the gift of god, whiche he knew before,
that he wuld giue to thē whiche
are called with this vocation,
wherof the scripture ſpeaketh ſayinge:
The gyftes and vocation of
god are without repentāce) which
thinge is to be confeſſed of euerye
man. This then is the predeſtination,
which we do faithfulli, & with
all humblenes preache and teache.And yet he taught predeſtination.
And yet for al that, this man was
both a preacher and a teacher, and
alſo a worker, whiche beleued in
Chriſt, and lyued ſtedfaſtly, in holy
obedience, euen tyl the tyme that
he ſuffered his paſſion for Chryſte
ſake, not therefore ceaſſynge to
preache the ghoſpell, exhortynge
men to fayth and perſeueraunce

to the end, bycauſ he ſaid, we ſhold
be proud of nothīg, ſith y• nothing
is our own. And in that ſaying he
openyd to vs, the very ryght, and
trewe grace of god (that is to ſay)
which is not gyuen after our meryts,
which grace god knew before
that he wold gyue to vs.
               In theſ words of Cypryā predeſtination
verely is taught, and preached
vnto vs, whiche predeſtination
if it dyd not let, and hynder
Cypryā, from y• preaching of obedience,
why ſhold it be any let vnto
vs, but that we may do ye ſame?
For although we do ſay, that obedyence
is the gyfte of god, yet do
we exhort men to the keping of it.
But vnto them, whiche do obediently
here the exhortation of the
veryte, the gyft of god is gyuen,
(that is to ſaye) to here it, and to obeye

vnto it. And to them which
do not heare it after that faſhion,
y• they do not obey it, it is not giuē.
For Chryſt, whoſe words ar to be
beleued doth ſay▪
                  Ihon. vi. (No man commeth
vnto me, but to whome it is
gyuen of the father. And to you it
is gyuen to knowe the myſtery of
the kingdom of heuen but to thē it
is not gyuē.Mathe. xix. And alſo, as toching
the vertue of continency, and chaſtyte,
euerye mā (ſayth he) doth not
receaue, and take this worde, but
they to whome it is gyuen. And alſo,
i. Corint, uii when the Apoſtel exhorted men
to a chaſte lyuing in matrymony;
I wolde wyſhe (ſayth he) that all
men were as I am, but eueri man
hath his proper gyft of god, ſome
on way, ſome another. In ye which
place he teacheth, that not only,
the chaſt lyfe, without wedlok, is

the gifte of god, but alſo that the
chaſte and honeſt conuerſation of
lyfe betwen man and wife in wedlok,
is the veri gift of god. Which
thing ſyth it is trewe, that as well
the on as the other is the gyfte of
god, we, (for all that it is the gyfte
of god) do exhort people thet vnto
as much as is gyuen to vs to exhort.
No man can exhort Well excepte it be giuen to him of god ſo to do. For, to exhort, is the gyft alſo
of god, in whoſe handes bothe
our wordes, and our bodyes are.
Whervpon the Apoſtel ſpak theſ
wordes, ſaying: After the grace
which is giuen to me, like to a prudent
and a wyſe maſter carpenter,
I haue leyd the foundacion. And
in an other place, Vnto euery mā
(ſaythe he) as god hath gyuen, I
haue planted, and Apollo hathe
watered but god hath gyuen the
encreaſe. So, nether he whiche

planteth, nor he, which watereth is
any thing, but he, whiche gyuethe
the encreaſe, which is god.
               Euen ſo, lykewyſe, as no man precheth
& exhorteth wel, but he, whiche
hath receuid the gift of god, ſo
that man dothe obediently heare
hym, whiche precheth, and exhorteth,
to whō the gyft of obedience
is gyuen.Our obediēt is the gift of god. This is the cauſe, why
the lorde, when he ſpake to them
which had there fleſhly ears open
hearing his words, ſaid: He that
hath ears to heare, let hym heare:
Which ears (ſuch as he ſpake of)
he knewe wel ynough, al men had
not▪
               
               And of whome theye ſholde
obteyn thoſe ears (whoſoeuer hath
them) the lord him ſelfe ſhewethe;
where he ſaythe: I wyll gyue
to them an harte to knowe me

& eares to heare wt. Then, to haue
ears to here with, is the gift of obedience,
that thei, whiche haue that
ſame gift, may com to hym, to whō
no man commeth, but to whom it
is gyuē of his father. We therfore
do preache,Who hathe eares to here & exhort, & they which
haue ye eares to heare, do heare vs
obediētli. But thei which haue not
that ſame eares, it commeth to pas
in them, as it is written, that hearinge
with their eares, thei doo not
hear, that is to ſaye, hearinge with
the ears of the fleſſhe, not with the
agrement, and conſent of the hart.
               But whye the one hath eares to
heare, and the other not (that is to
ſay) wherfore it is geuen to them of
the father, to com to the ſonne, and
to the other not geuen, who knoweth
ye mind of the lord? Or what
man hath bene of his counſell? Or
what art thou, O man, which wylt

aunſwer againſte god? Shall we
therefore denye that thinge to be
true, which we manifeſtly do ſe, becauſe
we cannot comprehend that
thinge therof, whiche is hid from
vs, I ſay againe ſhall we ſay, that
that thing is not true, which we do
ſe wt our eyes, bycauſe we can not
fynd the cauſe, why, and wherfore
it is ſo as it is?

if he hath you in hys forknowlege
for to be bad. I pray you, yf a man
hearing theſe words ſpoken of the

and noughty luſtes, folowing
his owne noughtye and euell concupiſcencys,

ſhoulde we therefore thinke,
that, the ſayinge, whiche was

ſpoken of the preſcience, and foreknoweledge
of god, were falſe and
vntrue, becauſ of his or their leudnes?
Yf god hath them in his foreknowledge,
that they wil be good,

euer they be at this preſent? Or yf
god doeth knowe before, that they
ſhall be euyll, ſhall they not be euil
for al the goodnes, they do ſeme to

man in our monaſtery, whiche beynge
rebuked of his brethren, becauſe
he lyued not as he oughte to

thoſe thinges which wer commaū
                  ded,

aunſwered to them again with

without faile, ſpake the trueth, but

               Therfore, let the truthe be tolde,
ſpecyally, whē any ſuche queſtion

are able to take it, ſholde not only
be depryued of the knoledg of the

ſnared, and taken in a trape of talſe
& vntrew doctrin. It maketh no
greate matter, yea it is proffytable

that ſome veryte ſhold not be ſpō
                  ken,
bycauſe of them, which ar not
able to receue it. That was y• cauſ
why the lord ſpak theſe words (yet
haue I manye things to tel you,
but ye are not nowe able to beare
them. And that ſaying of the Apoſtell,
(I coulde not talke to you, as

of ſpeakynge, it maye be well,
that, that thing, which is ſpoken,
is both mylke to yonge chyldren,
and ſtronge meate alſo, for them
whiche are greate.
               As for example. In the beginning
was the worde, and the word, was
with god, and god was the word.
What chriſtian man canne hould

his peace, and ſpeak not theſe words?
And again, what man cā, or is
able to vndertſtond them to the bottom
Or what hygher matter in all
the holy ſcripture can be foūd, thā
this is? And yet it is not left vnſpoken,
becauſe of yong infātes, being
not hid & kepte nether from yonge
nor old. But to tel the truth is one
thing, and for a neceſſary cauſe not
to ſpeake it, is another.
               It were to longe a buſynes, to
ſerche out al cauſes, why the truth
ſhuld not be ſpoken at al times, of
the which cauſes, this folowing is
one, leſt we ſhuld make them whiche

               But when the matter is ſuch that

company and in the preſence of the
other? Is it not more mete, y• we
ſholde tel the truth, that he, which
can tak it, may take it 'than not for
to ſpeke it, wher by not only both of
them can not receue it, but he alſo
which is able to take yt, if it were
ſpoken, ſhold be made ye worſ by y•

which is an enmy to the grace of

al that he maye, that we ſholde
beleue, yt the grace of god is gyuen
acording to our meryts, and ſo the
grace of god ſhold be no grace? Yet
we wyl ſpeak yt thing, which we may
be boulde to ſpeke by the ſcripturs.
But we do fear leſt, if we do ſpeke,

althoughe this their opinion (as I

               But theſe mē, for whoſe cauſe we
do take al this labor, do not hold in
al pointes wt the error of the pelagians
hereſy,wherin theſ men do dyffer from the pelagians. ſom thing they do go
from it, that although, they wil not
graunt thoſe mē to be predeſtined,
which are by the grace of god made
obedient, & ſo do continue, yet they
do confeſſe that this grace doth preuent
the wyl of them to whom it is
gyuen. But therfore, they wyll not
graunt them to be predeſtined, bycauſe
grace ſhulde not be beleued
to be a free gyfte, as the verite teacheth,
but according to the merits
of the wil preceding, as the pleagians
moſt falſe, and vntru▪ doctrine
doth affyrme. It foloweth then, y•
                  
grace doth preuēt, fayth, otherwyſe
faith doth preuent grace, y• wil alſo
doth preuente grace, for faith can
not be withoute the wyll. But if
grace doth go before faith, becauſe
it doth go before the wyl, truelye it
doth preuent, and go before al our
obediēce, it doth go before charite,
whiche only cauſeth vs, wyllingly
& truly to obey: which altogether
grace doth preuent, yea & worketh
them in hym, to whom it is giuen.

                  THer is no mor
behynd nowe,
but to contynue
in theſe
good thinges
to y• ende. And
that is perſeueraunce,
which is praied for in vain

if the lorde by his grace doth not
worke that ſame in him, whoſ prayar
and petytion he doth hear and
graunt.Perſeuerāce is the gyft of god. Mark now, how for from
the truth, it is to denye, yt perſeuerance
to the ende of the lyfe is the
gyft of god, forſomych as whē his
pleaſure is, he maye ſhorten thys
lyfe at al tims, and make an ende
therof, whiche if he doeth gyue
before the man dothe fall, he maketh
him to perſeuer & continewe
to the end. But the great liberalite
of the goodnys of god, is more open
and apparant in the eys of ye
faythful, bycauſe they do perceue
and ſe, that this grace, is gyuē, yea
to yong chyldren, to whoſe age the
gyft of obedience perteyneth not.
Theſe gifts truly to whom ſoeuer
god doth giue thē, ther is no doubt

                   he knew before in his forknoeledg,

in his preſcience, he dydde ordeyne

               Thoſe then, whom he hath predeſtenid,
he hath called wt that vocation,
wherof it greueth me nothing
to make often mention, as it is writen
(the gifts

                  ence,
which cannot be deceiued & is

thoſe things, whiche he wil worke
is none other thing but predeſtination.
But lykwiſe, as yt man whom
god knoweth before, or hath in his
forknolege yt ſhal be chaſt, (he hym
ſelf hauing no certain knowledge
therof) doth work y• he may be chaſt:
ſo, that man, whom he hath predeſtened
to be chaſt, though it be vncertain,
& vnknowen to him, y• he is
predeſtened, ceaſeth not to work yt
he may be chaſt, although he doth
here that it is ye gift of god. that he
ſhalbe, as he ſhalbe, but his charite

reioyſeth, and is glad therof, not beinge
proude and puffed vp in hym
ſelf, as though he ſhold not receiue
it, as the gyft of god.
               The preaching therefore, of predeſtination
doth not only not hynder,
and pluck a man back frō working
of this & ſuch other good workes,
but it doth help him forward,
that when he reioyſeth, he may reioyſe
in the lord. The ſelf ſame thing,
that I haue ſpoken and ſayde
of chaſtite, do I vnderſtonde alſo
of faith, of the loue of god, of charitie,
of perſeueraunce, & to be ſhort
of al other kynd of obedience vnto

Or (peraduenture) do they

that their exhortacions ar nothing

                     . if any of you do
lacke wyſdom, let him aſk it of god
which giueth to al mē aboundātly
& caſteth his gift in the teeth to no
man, & it ſhal be gyuen to hym.
               For it is wryten in the prouerbs.
               The lorde doth gyue, wyſdom.
               And as toching continency, or chaſtiſe
of lyfe it is wrytten in yt boke
of wyſdom (whoſe authorite hath
byn alowed of gret lernid mē, which
haue trauelid in ye ſcripturs lōg

wt theſe words, whē. I dyd know
perfectly yt no man can be chaſt except
god doth gyue to him ye gyfte

therof, this thing alſo perteined to
wyſdō to know whoſe gift it was.
Theſe then (that is to ſay,) wyſdō
& chaſtyte, as wel as all other vertues
(which I do pas ouer) are the
gyfts of god, And ſo do theſ men
ſay alſo. For theye are not as the
pelagians, which with obſtynate,
& heretiqual ſtobernis do contēd
againſt the manyfeſt, and open veryte.
But yet theſ our men do ſay,
that our fayth doth impetrate and
obteyn of god, ye theſ vertuſe ſhold
be gyuen to vs, which fayth (ſaye
they) doth begyn in vs of our ſelfe
by oure own pour. The beginnīg
wherof, as wel as the continuance
to the end, they do holde & defende
to be of thē ſelf, as though we had
not this alſo of the gyft of god,i. Corin. iiii as
wel as the other. And in this point
they are againſt the apoſtel, which
ſayth, what haſte thou, that thou

haſt not receuyd? They are alſo
againſt the holy martyr Cypryan
which ſayth, we muſt be proude of
no thinge, forſomuch as we haue
no thing of our ſelfe.
               For al thys that I do ſpeke, and
many other wordes more, whiche
I am wery to reherſe and repeat ſo
often, and for al that I haue prouyd,
that the begynninge of oure
fayth, and the perſeuerance therin
to the ende, are the gyftes of god
and that there ar none of his gifts
but he knewe before, what gyfts
they were, whiche he wold gyue, &
to whom he wold gyue them, and
ſo by that reaſon, that they alſo ar
predeſtenyd, whome he doth delyuer
and crown, they do make anſwer
and ſay, that the openinge of
predeſtination doth let and hynder
the commodyte of preching in exhortation,
bicauſe (as they do ſuppoſ
                     •
                  
                  
when men do here the matter
of predeſtination ſpoken of, & declared
vnto them, they wyll not for
any thinge that a man can doo, by
exhorting to vertu or reprehēding
of vice, and noughtines, endeuour
them ſelf, and ſtudye to be y• better.
And by theſe their wordes, thei wil
not that any man, ſhulde preache,
that the firſt commyng to faith, &
the continuance therin, are the giftes
of god, leaſt, that deſperation
ſhuld beare more ruele among mē,
than good and godly exhortation,
when the hearers do with thē ſelfe
conſider, that no man can tell (ſuch
is mās ignoraunce,) to whom god
doth gyue theſe hys gyftes, and to
whom not. Wherfor then do they,
as well as we, preache and teache,
that wiſedome and chaſtitie at the
giftes of god? And, if ſo be, when
theſe are taught to be the gyftes of

god, and ſo preched by them, there
exhortation is not let, nor hinderid
by the which they do exhort men to
be wyſe and chaſte, what cauſe is
ther I praye you, wherfore they
ſhold thinke that the exhortation,
which is to fayth and to the contynuans
therin ſhold be hinderid,
more than ther exhortation which
is to wyſdom and chaſtite? And if
theſe be the giftes of god, as by ye
ſcripturs, which ar witnes of them
ſelfe, we haue prouyd, let vs nowe
let paſſe, and ſpek no more of the
gyft of chaſtyte but only in thys
place diſput and reaſō of the gyft
of wyſdom. For the ſayde Apoſt
                     •
                  l
Iamys (of whom we ſpake of)
ſayth theſ wordes. The wyſdom,
whiche is from aboue is al chaſte
& pure, it is alſo peaſſable & quiet,
it is ſober & gentyl, & eaſy to be entreatyd

treated, ful of mercy & good fruits
without grudging & diſſimulatiō.
Do you ſe & perceiue (I pray you)
how many & how greate vertues,
this wyſedome hath, whiche commeth
doune frō the father of light?
For euery good gyft. & euery perfecte
gyft (as he ſayeth) is frome aboue,
& commeth doune frome the
father of lyghtes.
               To be ſhort we do rebuke thoſe,
which ar vnchaſte and contentios
perſons, and yet we do preche and
teche vnto them, that the wyſdom
which is chaſte, and gentyl, is the
gyft of god, hauing no doubt nor
fearing leſt they, whom we do exhort
(when they are not certayne to
whom god doth giue this wiſdom)
ſhulde by this preachinge take occaſion
to fall into deſperation, rather
than to receiue any fruyte of
good exhortation. And agayne,

fearing nothing, that they by oure
rebukyng of their vyce, ſhulde not
only not be moued agenſt them ſelues,
but agenſt vs, becauſe we do
rebuke them, which haue not thoſe
vertues, which vertues we do ſay
are not broughte forth by the wyll
of man, but ar geuen liberallye by
the bountefull goodnes of god.
               Wherfore did not the preachinge
of this grace pluck backe the apoſtell
Iames, frome rebukynge of
them, and ſaying vnto them, theſe
wordes: Yf you haue the zeale of
anger and ſtrife in your hartes, be
nothinge proude therat, nor yet ly
not againſt the veritie. For that is
not the wyſedome, which commeth
downe from aboue, but it is an erthly
wyſedome, a beaſtly, and a deuelyſh
wyſedome. For where as
zeale, and contention is, ther is vnſtedfaſtnes,
and all euyll workes.
               
                  
Lykwiſe then, as we may, by the
authoritie of the holy ſcriptures, &
as our own dedes do make mention
in the ſame doing (I ſaye theyr
dedes as wel as ours) rebuke thoſe
perſons whiche are vnquiete, and
troublous, although we do preach
that the wiſedome, which the Apoſtell
nameth, is the gyfte of God,
which wiſedome doth amend, and
correct thoſe that are contentiouſe,
and brawlynge perſons: euen ſoo,
thoſe perſons, whiche are vnfaithfull,
and thoſe, which do not contynue
in the faith whiche they haue
receiued, (although we do preache,
and tech the grace of god, wherby
both fayth it ſelf, and perſeuerance
therein ar declared to be the gyfts
of god) maye alſo be rebuked and
toulde of their vnfaithfulnes, and
vnſtedfaſtnes. For although, that,
yt godly wiſdō is obteyned thorow

faith (according to the ſaying of y•
apoſtel▪) Yf any man lack wiſdom,
let him aſk it of god, which geueth
to al men aboundantly,Iames. 
                        •
                     
                     ▪
                   & vpbreadeth
no man, and it ſhall be giuen
to him, (and ſaith forthermore, let
him aſke it boldly in faith, hauing
no miſtruſt) yet we muſte not ſaye,
becauſe we obteyne that wyſedom
thorow faith, therefore faith is of
our ſelfe, & not the gift of god. For
faith is gyuen to him which hathe
receiued it, before it is aſked or prayed
for. For the apoſtel Paul ſpeaketh
playnly and openly, ſayinge,
Peace be to the brethren, and charite
with fayth from god oure father,
and our lorde Ieſu Chriſte.
From whom we haue peace a charitie,
from hym haue we fayth.
               For the whiche cauſe. we doo
deſyre, and praye, that in them

them which haue alredy receuyd
the fayth, he wold encreſe it, and to
them whiche haue it not, that he
wolde vouchſafe to gyue it. And
alſo, thei them ſelf, which do cauſe
vs to make al theſe wordes, which
do crye out, that the prechinge of
predeſtinatiō and of grace, is a let
and ſtop that men can not exhorte
frutfully, as they might, if predeſtination
were not ſpoken of, theye
I ſaye, them ſelfe do not only exhort
men vnto thoſe vertuſe, whiche
they do hold to be of them ſelfe
(as the begynnyng of fayth, and
the continuance therin, to thend)
which thing they are bound to do
that by ther exhortations thei which
are vnfaithful may beleue, and
the other to continew ſtyll therin,
but they do exhorte them to the other
vertuſe alſoo, whiche are the
gifts of god (as thei ſay) only and

not the other.
               But as toching thoſe thinges
which they do confeſſe againſt the
pelagians error to be the gyfts of
god, as chaſtyte, continency, pacience,
and other vertuſe perteyning
to a godly lyfe, which ar obteyned
by fayth, they ſhold ſhewe, & teche
the peple to cal and to pray to god
for theſe vertueſ,He teachethe theim howe they ſhuld exhort peple to uertues. for them ſelf and
for other, that he woulde gyue
thoſe vertus vnto them, and not
that they ſholde exhorte and byd
them only to haue them, & to kepe
them.
               For ſomych then as thei do exhort
people to theſe vertuſe alſo,The begynninge the ending and the middes of our lyfe, are the gyftes of god whiche
they do confeſſe to be the gifts
of god, as wel as to fayth and perſeuerance,
which they denye to be
of god but of ther owne working,
and in that they do exhort men vnto
them (declaring themſelfe to be

men) they do ſufficiently manifeſt,
& make open vnto vs, that the prechynge
of predeſtination, & of the
grace of god, is no hynderance to
that, that men ſhulde exhorte other
vnto faith, and perſeueraunce to
the end, forſomuch as we do prech,
that theſe alſo, (that is to ſay) fayth
and perſeueraunce are the gyftes
of god, and that no man hath theſe
gyftes of hym ſelf, but ar gyuen to
hym of god.
               But yet no man can deny, but that
it is his own fault & blame, what
ſoeuer he be, whiche doth forſake
this faith, in geuing place to tentacion,
whereby he is broughte frō yt
faith, which he hath receyued. And
again, although it be his own fault
that he doth go from the faithe, we
may not therfor deny, that the vertue
of perſeuerance to the end, is y•
gift of god. For, for this ſame peruerance

iv. faith to thenv, that man
doth make his daily petition, which
ſaith, Lede vs not into temptation.
And yf his prayer be hard, he
dothe receyue hys petytyon.
               And ſo by that reaſon, prayenge
dayly that he myght perſeuer & cō
                  tinu,
he doth not ſet the hope of his
perſeuerance & ſtedfaſtnes in hym
ſelfe, but in god, I wyl not amplyfye,
& exaggerate the matter with
many more wordes, but rather I
wyl leue it to them to think, & conſider
wt thē ſelf what maner a thīg
they haue takē in hād to perſwade,
which is, that by the preching & opening
of predeſtinatiō, the herers
therof ſhuld receiue more cauſe of
deſperation, than frute of godly exhortaciō.
Which is as much to ſay
as men ar taught to deſpair of ſaluation,
when they do learne to put
their confidence not in thē ſelf but
in god. And yet the prophet doth

cry out with a loud voyce ſaying:
Curſed are all they, which do put
ther hope in man. Theſ gyfts truly
of god, which are gyuen to the
elect, which elect are called after y•
purpoſe of god (amōg y• which giftes,
is the begynning of fayth, and
the contynuance alſo therin to the
end, as we haue prouyd by manye
authorytes of the ſcriptur, and by
ſtrong and ſubſtancyal reaſons) i
                     •
                  
ther be no predeſtination, which
we defend and hold ſtrongly fore
to be, then are they not in hys forknowledge.
But theſe giftes ar in
the forknolege of god, then is there
predeſtination, whiche
we erneſtly do defend
and maintaine.
            
            
               The xviii. Chapter.
               
                  
                  ANd therfore in
ſome places of ye
ſcripture,Preſciēce is ſometyme taken in the ſcripture for predeſtinatiō
                   a man
ſhal fynd this predeſtination to be
ſignified vnto vs
in the vocable of preſcience, or forknoledge,
as the Apoſtel ſpeketh,
ſaying: God hath not caſte of his
people whom he hath forknowen▪
This word, which he ſaith (foreknowen)
can non otherwiſe be wel
vnderſtonded, but it be taken for
predeſtenid, as the circumſtance of
the place and matter doth tech vs.
For he ſpeketh in that place of the
reſt of the Iewes, which ar ſaued,
the other peryſhing. For before he
cam to this place where the prophet,
ſpeking to Iſraell ſayde (All
the daye long I haue openyd my
handes to an vnbeleuinge and a
reſyſting people) and agayn as
                     •
                  
                  
though this queſtyon (wher ar the
promiſſes, which wer made to Iſrael)
had byn demaunded of hym:
he aunſweryd incontynetly theſe
wordes, ſaying: (do I ſay therfore
that God hathe forſaken, and caſt
of hys people? God forbyd. For I
am an Iſraelyt, of the 
                     •
                  ed of Abraham,
of the trybe of Beniamyn) as
thoughe he wolde ſaye, I my ſelfe
am alſo of that people. Then dyd
he ſpeke theſe wordes, wherof we
now do common, ſaying god hath
not caſte o
                     •
                   hys people, whiche he
hath foreknowen. And, for to ſhew
that the remnant, was reſerued by
the grace of god, not bi the merets
of there own works, he ſayd thus
mych more, do ye not know what
the ſcripture ſpeketh in H
                     •
                  ly, how
he called on y• lord againſt Iſrael▪
and ſo forthe. But what anſwere
made the lorde vnto him (ſaythe

the Apoſtel? I haue lefte vnto me,
(ſayth the lorde) ſeuen thouſande
men, which haue not o
                     •
                  s bent ther
kne before Baal. He ſayd not ther
are left vnto me,Mark how he deth wey
                     
                        •
                     ge words of the lorde. or ells, they haue
lefte them ſelf
                     •
                   vnto me. But he
ſayde, I haue left vnto me. And ſo
then ſayth the apoſtel, in thys time
the remnaunt is ſauyd by the election
of grace, But if it be of grace,
thē doth it not com of works. For
then grace were no grace. And ſo,
ioyning, and knitting theſ things
vp togyther (as I haue reherſed)
what thē (ſayd he)? And to that he
ſayde: That, whych Iſrael ſought
after it dyd not obteyne, election
dyd obteyne it, the reſt were blynded.
It foloweth, that in thys loue
of god, and in the remnant, which
is ſaued thorowe the election of
grace, the Apoſtell wyll haue the

people to be ment and vnderſtonded,
whiche people for that cauſe
god dyd not caſt of, becauſe he dyd
forknow them. This is that ſame
eleccion, wherby god did choſe thē
whom hym pleaſed in Chriſte, that
they ſhuld be holy and pure in his
ſyght, in charite, predeſtening them
into the adoption of chyldren. No
man therfore whiche doth vnderſtande
this matter, can ether denye
or doubt, but theſe wordes, which
thapoſtle doth ſpeke, (He hath not
caſt of ye people,Ephe. 
                        〈◊〉
                     , which he hath forknowen)
do ſignifi non other thing
than predeſtination. For in his for
knowlege, he knew before the remnaunte,
which he wolde make after
the election of grace (that is to ſay)
which are predeſtened. And without
doubt, if he did predeſtinat thē,
he knew it before, that he would ſo
do. But to predeſtinate is as much

as to know before what he wold do
afterward. What thing then ſhuld
let vs, when we do rede in holy writers
theſe wordes (the preſcience of
god) ſpecially, when thei do treate
of y• vocation of the elects, but that
we may vnderſtond, and cal it predeſtination.
For peraduenture thei
do vſe this word & vocable preſcience
the more, becauſe it is more
eaſy to be vnderſtonded, & beſyde
that, it is not againſt, ye it is ryght
agreable to the vetitie, whiche is
taught as touchinge y• predeſtination
of grace. This I am ſure of,
that no man (except he woulde erre
wyllingly) can diſpute agenſt this
predeſtination of grace, whiche we
do defend, by the authorities of the
holy ſcripture.

Ciprian, and Ambroſe, being men
hyghly commended bothe for ther
purenes of fayth, & great knowledg
in al godly doctryn whoſe
teſtimonis we haue reherſid, ſhold
be ſufficient, both that they ſholde
throughly beleue, and ſo preche &
tech that the grace of god, is a fre
gifte, as it oughte to be beleued &
taughte & alſo that they ſhold not
think the preching of y• ſaid grace
to be ani hinderance or let, to y• preching,
wherin we do exhort thoſe
which are ſlothful to go from ther
ſlothfulnis, & rebuke thoſe whiche

are noughtye and euyll, from
their leudnes, forſomuch as theſe
godly mē, did ſo highly extol, & ſet
forth the grace of god, inſomuch
that th

                  ne of thē ſaid, (we muſt be
proud of nothing, becauſ nothīg is

our harts, nor our thoughtes
ar in our own power. And yet they
in their prechyng, dyd both exhort,
& rebuke, as they ſaw cauſe, ye the
cōmaundements of the lord might

leſt any wold ſay to thē, wherefore
doeſt yu exhort vs? wherfore doſt yu
rebuke vs, if we haue no good thinge

Thei wer afraid of no ſuch words,
being of ſo godl
                     •
                   a iudgmēt y• they
knew wel, ther wer very few or nō,
which had receuid ſuche a gift at y•
mouth of god, or els by ſom angel.

that they ſhuld haue the knowlege
of the heuenly doctrin, without the
helpe of any man, preaching vnto
them. But cōtrarywiſe, they knew
many, to whom it was geuen, that
by the preaching & teaching of mē,
they ſhuld come to faith & beleife
in god. How be it, which waye ſoeuer
the word is ſpoken and declared
to a mā, he that doth giue ſuch
eare vnto it, that he doth follow, &
obey it, that ſame is y• gift of god.
So theſe foreſayd holye wrytars,
being moſt godly expoſitors of the
worde of god, dyd both preach the
grace of god, as it ought to be preched
(that is to ſay) which grace no
humayne merits do precede, and
alſo dyd moſt inſtantly, and earneſtly
exhort men to the keping of the
commaundementes of the lorde,
that they which haue the gyft of obedience,
maye here and perceaue,

wherin they ſhold be obedient. For
if any of our meryts do precede the
grace of god, it muſt be y• meryt ether
of ſō dede,Ciprian or word, or thought
of ours, in the whiche, the wyll of
man is vnderſtonded to be good.
But that man dyd in fewe words
comprehend al kind of merits, which
ſayd: We muſt be proud of nothing,
Ambroſe forſomych, as nothinge is
ours to be proud of. That man alſo
which ſayde, that our harts, and
our thoughts are not in our powr
he left nether words, nor deds vnment.
For there is no ded, or word,
which any man doth work or ſpek
but it commith out of the thought
of y• hart. What thing could this
holi matter, and godly doctor Cyptyan
do more, concerninge this
matter, than, where he taught vs
ſpeking vpon the lords prayer, y•
we muſt praye for the enemies of

Chriſts faith, in the which leſſon,
we are taught, that the begynning
of our faith is the gift of god, after
his mynde and iudgment. He taught
vs alſo. y• the church of Chriſt,
doth dayly praye for perſeuerance,
that it may perſeuer and continue
to the end. For god doth gyue that
to non▪ but to them which haue perſeuered
to the end. Bleſſed Ambroſ
alſo, where he treateth vpon theſe
words of the Euangeliſt Luk, whiche
words ar.Whither this word (it liketh me wel is ſpoken of our own wil or of the workinge of god of that ſame wyll in us ſo to ſpeake. (It ſemed to me wel
and good) it might well be (ſayde
Ambroſe) that the thinge did lyke
& pleaſe hym wherof he ſpake. For
thinges (ſaid he) doo not only lyke
vs wel in our own conceyts & wils,
but euen ſo as it pleſed him, which
doth ſpeke in vs, which is Chriſte,
which doth work in vs, y• that thīg
which is good in dede, may ſo ſem,
& appere vnto vs. For on whom he

taketh mercy, & compaſſion, him he
calleth. And therfor, that man, which
doth folow Chriſt (beyng demā
                  ded
y• queſtion, For what cauſe he
wolde be a chriſtian man) may well
make aunſwer, and ſay, it lyked me
well, and it thought me good ſo to
do. For when he ſpeketh thoſe words,

ende, wherof we haue ſpoken ſo
                     •
                  
many wordes at the gifts of god.
For if we do ſaye, that the beginnyng
of faythe is of oure

ſelf, that, by and for the ſame begynning,
we may deſerue to receue
againg other rewards and gifts
of god, then do the pelagians conclud
without ani more words, that
the grace of god is gyuē after our
meryts. This opinion the catholique
fayth hath ſo abhorred, that
pelagiā being in fear leſt he ſhold
be condemnyd therfore, dyd fyrſte
condeme yt his own ſelfe.
               And againe if we wold ſay that
perſeuerance to the end, is of our
ſelfe and not of god, then do theye
anſwer that the begynning is as
wel of our ſelfe as the end therof,
making this reaſon ſaying: Yf we
haue the pour in oure ſelfe that we
maye continewe to the ende, miche
more haue we the beginninge in
our owne power for to beleue, forſomich
as it is a more greate and
buſiar matter to make an end thā
                  
to begin. And ſo after this faſhion
they do conclude, that the grace of
god is gyuen after our deſeruing.
But if both to gither, as wel to begin,
as to make an end, ar the gifts
of god, and alſo if he knowethe
before, that he wil giue thoſe gyfts
(whiche, of no man cann be denied):
thē muſt predeſtination be prechid,
that the right, and trew grace
of god (that is to ſay) which is not
gyuen after any humain meritts,
maye with al power and ſtrength
be defendid. And as tochinge my
ſelfe, in the boke which I wrotte,
entituled (of correction & of grace)
which worke coulde not ſatiſfie &
pleaſe all my frendes I thinke
that I didde ſo ſet forthe perſeuerance,
which is to thende, for to be
the gyft of god, that, (if I do remember
my ſelfe wel) I neuer befor
dyd wright therof, nether more

weightly, nor more playnlye. And
yet in that place, I did not ſpeake
of it, after that faſhion as thoughe
I had bin the firſt, which had ſpoken
therof, and that non had medled
therwith before me. For the holy
father Cyprian (as I haue told
you before) hath ſo expounded our
petitions conteined in the lordes
prayer, that he ſaith, we do pray for
perſeueraunce in the firſt petition,
affirminge, that we then do deſyre
that ſame of god, when we do ſaye
(Let thy name be halowed) which
is, that, for ſomuch as we ar ſanctefied
in baptyme, we deſire, that we
may continue in that ſame ſtil, whiche
we haue begon. But I wold y•

do bear vnto me, I ſhuld not agaī

we haue nowe in queſtion) I
wold (Iſey) that they ſhuld loke &
ſe whither in y• latter part of y• firſt
boke, of thoſe twain, which I wrot
to Simplician, the byſhop of Mylan
before Pelagians hereſye dyd

                   to
doubt, that y• grace of god is not
gyuē after our merits. And alſo I
wolde they ſhuld ſe, whether I haue
not don ſufficiently concerning
the begynning of faith, declaringe
that it is the gyft of god. And alſo
whither it maye not appeare of the
words, whiche I dyd ſpeake ther
(although I ſpake thē not ſo openly)
that the perſeuerance to the end,
as wel as the begynning of faythe
is noone otherwiſe ours than by
the gyft of hym, whiche hath predeſtened
vs to his kyngdome and
heauenly glory.
               
                  
Forthermore, as toching that epiſtel,
which I wrote againſt y• Pelagiās,
vnto the holy father Paulinus
biſhop of Nolan (againſt the
which epiſtel, now of late thei haue
begon to contend) did I not write
it a good mani of yers befor? Let

wrote to Sixtus the eldar of thee
churche of Rome, what time we
contended moſt vehemētly againſt
the Pelagians, and they ſhal fynd
it ſiche an other, as that was, whiche
we ſent to Paulinus. Hereby
thei maye cal to remembrans, that
diuers yers paſt, theſ thinges, wer
both ſpokē of, and alſo put in writīg,
which I do meruayl mich now

I wold not, that any man ſhold ſo

any thinge, but wherin thei do perceue

and ſe,if he doth appeare to erre in any poynt but wherein he errethe to forſake hym. that I do not erre, but
wher as I am in the right waye.
               For, for that cauſe do, I now wryght
certain bokes, wherin I go about
to retract my work as that I
maye teſtefye, and ſhew, howe, that
in all thinges, I didde not folow
min own ſelf: But yet I truſt
that by the helping mercy of god,
I did good with my wrytings although
at the beginning. I was
not perfect in al thinges. For euen
now I ſhold both lye, & ſpeke arrogantly,
if I ſholde ſaye, that I am
com to ſich a perfection (yea being
ſo olde as I am) that I am with
out al error in writing. But ther is
a gret difference bitwene how mich
and in what things a mā doth err
and how quickly he wil amend it:
& that man, which ſtobernly, wyl
ſtonde in the defence of his error.
For that man truly is happy, whiche

hath lerned, & profited ſo well,
that at the laſt day of his lyfe, hath
that thing gyuen to him, which he
wanted al his life before, & therfor
may be then iudged rather worthy
of perfection, which hath ſo proffited,
thā of punyſhment for ye contrary.
Wherfore, if I ought not to be
vnthankful to thē which did fauor
& loue me,God maketh men, of hys enemies hys louers becauſ they had ſom profit
by my woorks, yea before they
dyd loue me: howe muche more ar
we boūd to be thākful to god, whō
we could not loue, except he had loued
vs firſt, & made vs to be his louers?
For loue & charite doth come
of hym, as thoſ godly men do bear
witnes, whom he hath made grete
oratours, & myghtye preachers of
his name. What thing cā be more
vnthankeful, than to deny, ye grace
of god, which is in that we ſaye, it
is gyuen after our merits? Thys

ſaying dyd the catholyque, & vniuerſal
fayth, abhorre in the Pelagians,
as a cryme, of moſt haynous
wickednes. This error Pelagian
hym ſelf dyd condemne not for ani
loue he did bere to the veritye, but
for feare leſt he hym ſelf ſhuld haue
ben condemned. Whoſo euer
wyl ſey,But that it is geuen by the grace of god that the grace of god is giuen
after our meryts, agenſt the beleif
of al faythful men, & doth not
deny yt faith is of the grace of god
by the which grace he hath obteyned
to be faythful, by that ſame reſon,
let hym alſo gyue to the grace
of god, the gyft of perſeueraunce
to thend, as wel as thother (by the
whiche grace he obteyneth mercy)
which perſeuerance he prayeth for

                      into temptation. in yt he deſyreth, yt he might
not be brought into tentacion. In
the myds betwene the begynnyng
of fayth, & thend: whyche is perſeuerance

to the end, are al thoſ
vertuſe, wherwith our lyfe appeareth
good and godly, which vertuſe,
thei them ſelf do graunt to be
the gyfts of god, at the reſpect of
faith. But God knew that he wold
gyue to them, whom he hath called
al thoſ thinges, that is to ſai, both
ye beginning of faith & al other his
giftes, euen to the ende. It were
therfore a matter of to mich contention,
other to ſpek againſt predeſtination,
or ells to doubt any thing
therof.A warnyng how predeſtination ſholde be taught. Yet men muſt take hede, &
be ware now & after what manner
thei do prech yt to the people. And
that thei do not ſo preche it, that bi

they haue done by the preſcience, &

they canne not deneye. As if theye

perceue and know, that ye ar ſo for

as (if a man ſhold ſay). This is the
wil of god in his predeſtination yt
ſom of you ſhal receaue y• wil to be
obedient, and torn from youre infydelite,
to fayth. What nede is it
here to ſay (ſom of you? For if we
do ſpeake to the churche of god, if
we do ſpeke vnto none other but
ſuch as do beleue, wherfore do we
ſay, ſomof you are com to ye fayth?

For in ſo ſayinge, we do apper to
do wrong vnto the reſt, when we
myght ſpek more comly, and aptli
if we ſhold ſaye: This is the very
wyl of god in his predeſtination,
that ye ſhold receue the wyl of obedience,
& torn from youre vnfaithfulnes
to belefe, and to receue the
gyft of perſeuerance, that ye maye
continew therin. The reſte of the
words ſhould in nowyſ be ſpoken
that a man ſhold ſay: thoſe (whiche
are of you, that do abyde and continew
ſtil in the pleaſure of ſynne,
do not forſake your noughti luſts
& pleaſurs, bycauſe the help of the
mercifull grace of god hathe not
lift you vp &c. Wher as it had bin
better ſpoken and as it oughte to
haue bin, if ye words had bu
                     •
                   thus
ſet as: If ther be any of you, which
do continew in the delight & pleaſure
of ſyn which bryngeth damnation,

receue moſte holſom doctrin.
And when ye do as ye ar taught,
be not puffed vp then wt pride, as
though youre workes were youre
owne of your ſelf, and had not receuid
them. For god is he whiche
worketh in vs both y• wil & ye work
after his good wyl. And let youre
ſtepps and goings be made right
& ſtreight of the lord, that ye may
wyl to walke in his way. Let your
walking be ſo vpright and good,
that as you do ſe your ſelfe walke,
you maye lern that ye do pertein to
the predeſtination of the grace of
god. Alſo, thoſ words, which do folowe
(but if any of you are not yet
called, whō the grace of god hath
predeſtenid to be electid, ye doutles
ſhal receue that ſame grace, bothe
that ye maye haue the wyl to deſire
it, and alſo to be electid in ded) theſ
words I ſaye ar not ſo wel ſpoken

as they might haue bin, if we wold
thinke and perſwad our ſelfe, that
we do ſpeke to thoſ which ar of the
church of Chryſt, & not to thē whiche
are not of it. Why ſholde we
not rather ſay (if ther be any which
are not yet called, let vs praye for
them, that they maye be called. For
(peraduenture) they are ſo predeſtenid,
that it ſholde be grauntid to
our prayars, that they ſhal receue
that ſame grace, by the which they
maye haue the wyll to deſyre it of
god & be alſo electid in dede. For
god, which hath fulfylled & performyd
al thinges, that he hath predeſtenid,
wil haue vs, y• we ſholde
praye for them, whiche are enemis
vnto the fayth, yt therby we maye
perceue and vnderſtond, that he
doth gyue and graunt, yea to the
vnfaythful, that they may beleue,
yea and make alſo thoſe whiche

not willing for to be willing and
deſyrers therof. But thoſ wordes,
whiche do hereafter follow (as ye
do wryght) I merual if any man,
among the chriſtian people, which
is yet but weake, & feable, can be able
to here them patiently, as if a
man wolde ſay: (and if ther be any
among you whiche ar now obedient,
which is predeſtenid to be reiectyd,
and forſaken, the powr whiche
ye haue now to do wel, ſhal be
taken from you, that ye ſhal be no
more obedient To ſpeke after this
maner, what other thing els doth
it ſeme, and apere for to be but to

                  cy before of euill to com to

of them which do not perſeuer and
continew ī ye faith, or if ther be ſom
ſich matter, y• conſtreineth you to
ſpeke ſom thinge therof, whi ſhold
ye not rather ſpek your words ſo,

that they ſhold not apere to be ſpoken
to the hearers (as perteyninge
vnto them) but as though thei wer
ſpoken of ſome other, not there preſent
vnto them: that is, that it ſhold
not be ſayde to the hearers, (yf any
of you be now obedient, which are
predeſtinated to be forſaken, and
ſuch other wordes) let them I ſaye
be ſpokē in ye therd perſō of y• verb
not in the ſecond. For it is to odios
and hatful a word to be ſpoken, as
though it wer into ther face, to the
rebuke, and ſhamful reprofe of the
hearers, when a man doth ſai vnto
them (: If ther be any of you which
nowe do obeye and are predeſtined
to be forſaken, the power of obedience
ſhal be taken awaye from you
that ye ſhal obey no more). Shold
ther be any leſſe thing in effect ſpoken,
and ſayd (I pray you) if a mā
wold ſpeke after this faſhion and

ſaye. If they do obey and be nowe
good▪ which are not predeſtenid to
his kingedom and glory, thei are
but tymlyngs, and do continewe
but for a whyel, they ſhal not abid
to the ende in that ſame obedience.
Is not this now ſpokē, both better
and more fetly than if we ſhold in
our wordes apere to wyſh and deſire
ſo great an euyl vnto thē which
ar our hearers, but rather nowe
do apere to tel, and ſhew them that
thing of other men whiche thinge
the hearars do hate and abhore, &
that they ſhold not take thoſ wordes
ſpoken to them ſelf, as of thē
ſelfe, but be in hope, and prayar,
of that thīg which is better. After
yt maner, & to the ſelf ſame effect in
ſentence, as it is ſpoken of predeſtination,
it maye be ſpoken, and ſayd
of the preſcience of god, which preſcience
they canne not deny, but is

trew, as ſyf ye do obey, whiche are
foreknowen of god to be refuſed,He ſheweth that the teachyng of the preſcience of god after the ſame ways that predeſtination was taughte, is both unfruytfull & hurt full.
ye ſhal ceaſe, and obeye no more.
There is no doubt, but this is as
trew as may be ſpoken. But yet it
is moſt wykedly, moſt vncomly, &
out of order ſpoken, not that it is
not truly ſpoken, but bycauſe it is
not ſpokē as it ought to be, to the
helth and comfort of mans infyrmite,
and weaknes.
               We do thinke alſo, that to ſpeke
vnto the people, as I haue ſayd, &
wylled thē here to fore to do, is ſuffyciēt,
except, they wil add theſ wordes
more, vnto that, which I haue
ſaid and ſay (Ye therfor muſt be in
good hope & truſt, & aſke in youre
daly prayers of the father of lights,
that ye may perſeuer, and contynew
to thende in obedience, from
whom al good gyfts, and al perfect
gyfts do com doun▪ and when

ye do ſo, being in that godly obedience,
then to beleue ſtedfaſtly that,
ye are of thoſe, which ar predeſtenyd
to be his people, bycauſe, he
dothe graunt, and gyue vnto you
that ye may praye and deſire it of
hym) God forbyd, y• ye ſhold deſpeir
in your ſelf, bycauſe ye ar commaunded
to put your hope in hym
and not in youre ſelfe. For corſyd
are al they which do put ther truſt
in man. Alſo it is better to truſt in
god than to truſt in man. For accordinge
to the ſcripture, whyche
is the mooſt true and lyuelye worde
of god, all thoſe men are bleſſed,
whyche do put their truſte in
hym. And when ye haue this hope,
ſerue the lorde in feare: and reioyſe
towarde hym, with trembeling.
               For of the lyfe eteinal, which

lyfe god hath promiſed to the chyldern
of promiſſion,All mans lyfe euen to the end is in hope then to be out of hoope and into certaine ſecurite whē he ſhal departe from this lyfe. before the beginnyng,
no man can be certayn &
ſure, but when this lyfe ſhal be endid,
whiche lyfe is tentation vpon
the yerthe. But he ſhal make you
perſeuer and contynew in him, to y•
ende of that ſame lyfe, to whom ye
make youre petition, ſayinge: lede
vs not into tentatiō. When we do
ſpeke theſe wordes, and ſuch lyke,
whyther it be to a few in nomber
or to a multitude of the churche,
wherfore dowe feare to preche predeſtination,
and the trew grace of
god, according as the holy ſcripture
doth preche it vnto vs, (that
is to ſaye) whiche is not gyuen after
our merytts. Or ſhold we fear
leſte then, a man ſhold fall in deſpeyre,
when he is taught to putte
his hope in god: and that he ſhold
not deſpeire if he ſhold proudly, &

wrechedly truſt in him ſelfe? And
I wold to god, that they, which ar
ſlow in hart, and weake perſons, &
yet haue not the vnderſtonding of
the ſcripturs, that theye ſholde ſo
here theſe our dyſputations (or els
not here them) that they wold giue
more hede, and loke better vpon
thoſe prayars, whiche the church,
hath vſed from the begynning of
the world, and wyl ſtyl euen to the
ende.
            
            
               The .xxiii. Chapter.
               
                  OF this matter of predeſtination,
whiche we are
now fayne, not only to
ſpeke of, but alſo ſtrongly
to menteyn, and defend, againſt
a ſorte of new heretiques: the churche
of god maketh often mention,
in ther prayars, and in ther ſermons,

ye though ther were non aduerſary
which wolde gyue occaſion
to treat therof. Was there euer
any tyme, when the churche hathe
not prayed for the infidels, & thoſe
which are enemies to the fayth of
Chriſt, that they might be made
faythful, and beleue? Ys ther any
faythful man, whiche hauing a
frend, or neyghboure being an in
fidel, or hys wyfe out of the trewe
fayth, but hath prayed to the lorde
for to gyue an obedient mynde vnto
them, that they might be tornid,
and beleue? What man hath not
praied to god for him ſelfe, that he
myght be permanent, and ſtedfaſt
in the lord? Or what man, was euer
ſo boulde, yt wold ether by word
or thought ſpeke euel of a miniſter
when he maketh his prayer ouer
the faythful vnto the lorde, ſaying
(Eyue to them lorde, thy grace to

& prayers, ſo was it fyrſt
in thys faythe & doth grow, and
hath growen from the begynning
by the which faith, we do beleue yt
the grace of god is not gyuen after
the merits of them, which do receue
it. For ye church wold not prai
to god yt faith might be giuen to ye
vnfaithful except it beleued y• god
doth conuert, and turn to hym the
wylles of men which are not only

out of the fayth, but of thoſe alſo,
whiche are aduerſaris, & enemies
to the faythe. Nor yet wolde the
church praye,For al theſe things doothe the church of chriſte praye whereby he proueth that all, and eueri part of theſe thinges, are the giftes of god that it ſelfe might
perſeuer, and continew ſtronge in
the faith of Chriſt, & that it might
not be deceuyd, and ouer com, with
the tentations of the world, except
it beleued, that god had our harts
ſo in his power, that the goodnes
whiche we haue with our wyl, we
could nether haue, nor kepe it except
he wroughte, that ſame wyll
alſo in vs. For if the churche
doth aſke theſe things of him, and
yet doth thinke that god is not the
gyuer therof, but that it hath it of
it ſelfe without his gyft, then truly
hath it no perfect and true prayars,
but ſych, as are lyke vnto the
wynd, which thing god kepe vs
from. For what man can ſygh▪ and
ſorow with his hart, deliring to receue

that thing, which he aſketh of
god: if he doth thinke that he may
haue it of hī ſelfe, and not of god?
And that ſpecially, ſith we know
not what to aſke, as we ought but
the ſpirite doth make interceſſion
for vs, wt vnſpekable gronings.
For he that ſercheth the hart, knoweth,
what the mynd of the ſpirit
is. For he doth pray for the ſeincts
acording to the pleaſure of god.
               What is ment by theſe words, the
ſpirit doth praye, but that the ſpirit
doth make hym praye with vnſpekable
gronyngs, wt ſuch (I ſay)
as ar trew, & vnfeyned. For the ſpirit
is, veryte. That ſame ſpirit is
it, wherof ye Apoſtel ſpeketh in an
other place ſaying, God ſēt ye ſpirit
of his ſonne into our harts crieng,
Abba dere father. What is ment bi
this word (crieng), but that the ſpirit
dyd make him crye (in whom he

is) after that maner of ſpeking, as
when we do ſaye, a glad daye, bycauſe
the daye maketh men glade.
This manner of ſpeking the Apoſtel
maketh plain, and open, where
he ſaith▪ For ye haue not receuid.
the ſpirit of bondage in feate, but
ye haue receued the ſpirit of adoption
of chyldren, in whom we do
crye Abba dear 
                     •
                  ather. In the text
before, he ſayde (He ſent the ſpirit
crieng) & here in this part he ſaith
(In y• which ſpirit we do cry) expoū
                  dyng
thys worde, crieng, which he
ſpake befor wt this interpretacion
making vs to crye. By that, we do
vnderſtond that our crieng to him
is the gyft of god, that we maye
with a trewe hart and ſpiritually
crye vnto the lorde.
               Let thē now marke wel how foule
they are deceuid, whiche do thinke
that it is of our ſelfe, and not giuē
                  
to vs of god, that we ſholde aſke
that we ſhold ſeke,This is a greate bul
                        •
                      wark of fre wyll mayſters and knok. And
thus they do ſpeke, bycauſe theye
wold haue the grace of god preched
and taughte to be gyuen after
our merytts, that, the ſame grace,
ſholde be then thoughte to be giuē
when we do receue that thing whiche
we do aſke and deſire, and not
before, when we do find that thing
whiche we do ſeeke and not before
and when the doare is made open
after we haue knokte, & not
before. Nether wyl they vnderſtond
and beleue, that that is the
gyfte of god that we ſholde praye
whiche is as much to ſaye as that
we mighte aſk of god, ſeke and alſo
knock.
               For we haue receuyd the ſpirit of
the adoption of chyldern in whom
we doo crye (Abba dere father.

and alwaye hath done euen from
the begynning, that it was fyrſt a
church, god knew before that he
wolde gyue to them, which are called
of him, euen ſo, as he dyd giue
them at the fyrſt in his predeſtination
as the apoſtel did openly manifeſt
& declare, wryting to Timothy,
ſaying: labor with vs in the
ghoſpel according to the poure of
god, which ſaueth vs and callethe
vs with his holy calling▪ not after
our workes but according to hys
owne pourpoſe and grace, whiche
is gyuen to vs, in Chriſt Ieſu before

by the comming of our ſauior Ieſu
Chriſt. Let hym now go, what
ſoeuer he be, & ſay that the churche
of chriſt dyd not beleue this verite
of predeſtination, & of grace, whiche
now wyth ſomwhat more dyligence
we haue defended. Let hym
(that dare) ſpeke, and ſay that the
church of chriſt doth not, or at ani
time hath not prayed according to
the veryte, and truth, that thei whiche
do not beleue maye be conuertid
to the fayth and they which do
beleue may perſeuer and continew
ſtyl faythful. Which gyfts, if the
churche hath alwaye deſyred and
prayed for: there is no doubt, but
it alwaye beleued, that they ar the
gyftes of god, and that no man
coulde at any tyme laufully deney
but that they haue byn alwaye in
hys preſeyence, and foreknoledge

It followeth then that the churche
of Chriſt dyd alwaye beleue thys
predeſtination, which we nowe do
defend more earneſtly thā we haue
done before, againſt a ſort of newe
ſprong vp heretiques.
            
            
               The xxiiii chapter
               
                  BNt what ſhold we
nede to ſpeke any
more? & do think
y• I haue taught
ynough or rather
more thā ynough
al ready, and that I haue ſufficyently
prouyd that both the beginning
of our belefe in the lorde and
alſo, the contynuance therin to the
end, at the gyfts of god. As for al
other good thinges perteynynge
to good and godly lyuyng, wherof
god is wel worſhipped, they them

ſelfe, which haue byn the cauſars,
that we do take al thys payne, do
confeſſe that they are the gyfts of
god. And beſyde that, they can not
deney, but that god had in his forknoledge
all hys gyfts, whiche he
wold gyue, and knew alſo before,
to whom he wold gyue them. Likwiſe
then, as al other of his gyftes
ought to be prechyd and taughte,
that he whiche dothe preche them,
maye be herde, and obediently followed
euen ſo, no leſſe ought predeſtination
to be prechyd, and taught,
that he which doth here the other
vertuſe taught and doth obediently
follow them, ſholde not
therfore reioyſe & be proud in man
and by that reaſon, not in him ſelf
but in god. For it is the precept of
god, to heare the prechar obediently
y• he which doth reioiſe maye reioyſe
onlye in ye lord whiche is his

as wel as the other, whiche gyfte
whoſoeuer hath not, I doubt not
to ſay, that what ſoeuer he hath, is
in vayne and nothinge worth. I
wolde to god the Pelagians had
this gyft, and that theſe our brethren
had it more fullye, and more
perfectli thā they haue it.
               Let vs not therfore be buſy &
quick in reſoning, & ſlow in praier
Let vs pray (derly beloued) let vs
pray that god wold gyue his grace
ye to our enmies. but ſpecyally
to our brethren, and frendes: hys
grace (I ſay) that they may vnderſtande,
and knowledge that after
the great and vnſpekable fal, which
we fel al in one man, no man is
or hath byn ſaued but by the grace
of god, and not after the merits of
thē, which receuyd that ſam grace
(although it were gyuen again to
vs, as a reward dew for any thīge

of our wel doinge, but as grace in

               There is no goodlyar example of
predeſtination, that Ieſus him
ſelfe, of the which thing I dyſputed
in my fyrſt boke: & now haue
choſen agayn to prayſe, and commend
it in thend of this my ſecond
boke. Ther is no more goodly example
(I ſay) of predeſtinatiō than
is our mediator hym ſelfe. What
faythfull man therfore ſoeuer wyl
vnderſtond it wel, let him beholde
and loke wel vpon hym, & in him
he maye eſpye and 
                     •
                  ynde hym ſelf
(that faithful man I do mean, whiche
doth beleue yt there is in Chriſt
a perfect, and an vnfeyned nature,
that is to ſaye our humayne natur
which nature God the worde toke
vpon him after ſych a faſhyon, as

neuer was befor nor ſhal be again,
being ſo hyghly exalted, for to be y•
only begottē ſon of god. And ſo I
ſay, he toke our nature vpō hym, y•
both the receuer, and the humanite
receuid, ſholde be but on perſon in
trinite. For after he toke our manhode
vpon hym, ther were not then
four perſons, that theye ſholde be
called, a quaternite, but thre perſons,
whiche is the trinite, and ſo
remayneth, that he taking our mā
                  hode
vpon hym, making and performing
the verite of on perſon in
god and man, became perfect god
and perfect man both to gyther in
him ſelfe. For we do not beleue yu
Chryſte is only god, and not man
as the heretiques the Manaches
do hould, nor yet, that he was nothing
ells but man, as the Photynians
hereſy defendid, nor yet that
he was ſo man, that he had anye

thinge leſſe than he ought to haue
in hys humanitie, concerning our
humayn nature, whyther it be as
toching the ſoul, or the mind enduyd
with reaſon, whiche is in the
ſoul, or ells concerning the fleſhe,
that he dyd not take it of the womā
but that the fleſh was made of the
worde, that ſame word being conuertid,
and tornid into fleſh, as the
Apolloniſtes moſt peruicios and
damnable hereſy techeth whych ar
three ſeueral and damnable hereſis.
But we do ſaye that Chriſte is
perfect god, born of god the father
before the beginning of any tyme,
& that the ſame Chryſt beinge perfect
god was alſo perfect man borne
of man hys mother acordinge
to the natural corſe and fulnes of
time, & yt his humanite wherī he is
leſſe than his father, dothe not mi

his diuinite wherein he is equall
with his father, and that both theſ
ar on chriſt which chriſt according
to that he was god ſayd and that
truly: (I and my father am al on)
and as toching his manhod ſayd
alſo: (My father is greter than I.
He then whiche made him of the
ſede of dauid a iuſte man, whiche
is neuer vniuſte and that without
any merits of his own wyll preceding
that grace, he doth make thoſ

that made Chryſt to be ſich a man,
as neuer ſholde haue wyl to doo
euyl, that ſame, in his members
hath made of an euyl and a noughti
wyl a good and a godly wyl.
               It followeth then, that god dydde
perdeſtinate, both Chriſt and vs,
bycauſe he knewe before in Chryſt
thoſe workes▪ which he wold work
him ſelfe not that he knew ani meryts
of his which ſhold precede ye
