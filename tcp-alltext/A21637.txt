               FOrasmuch as diuers couetous people haue of late▪ vpon intent onlye
to enryche them selues, and without any other cause reasonable, not
only raysed vp the prices of all maner of grayne, bestiall, and other
victuell: but also do in many places forbeere to brynge the same to
the markettes as they were accustomed, so as therby the great number
of poore people that haue no store to liue vpō
               ▪ but from one market
day to another vpon theyr money, eyther can not haue such victuell
as of necessitie they ought to haue for their sustentacion, or els
not without vnreasonable prices, whereby they are lyke to be driuen
to great extremitie and lacke. The Quenes Maiestie hath thought meete to charge al maner of
Iustices of peace in euery countie, and all Maiors, Sheryffes, and other head ministers in townes
corporate, to take a speciall regarde herevnto with all spede, and for the furniture of markettes
with victuell where nede shall seme to be, and as the tyme of the yere shall require, to see the same
duely serued, by conference aswell amongest them selues, as with the Iustices and Ministers of
Counties adioynyng, for helpe of the poore people, by the best meanes that may be vniformely deuised
and put in execution. And thereupon that all officers hauyng aucthoritie to set assise of
victuelles, see the same from tyme to tyme well ordered, and wayghtes and measures to be duely
obserued in that behalfe.
            Yeuen at her Maiesties Pallaice of Westminster the tenth of March, the fourth yere of her highnes
most prosperous raigne.
            God saue the Quene.
