            And multitudes that doe beléeue
            this lore to be full right,
            Are readie prest to take hir part
            if you will trye hir might.
            But better no: returne in time
            if you hir grace doe looue,
            And seeke not iustice as your right,
            but doe hir mercie prooue.
            You cannot poynt, if fielde be fought
            the victorie at wyll,
            What gaine shall come vnto your part
            when eche doth other kill?
            O simple men why should ye thus
            despise the quiet state
            Of this the Realme so gouerned
            as you were in of late?
            
               
The Realmes about so troubeled
            and you in quiet rest:
            Who shall the breakers of the same
            not vtterly detest?
            And what if that ye should increase,
            (as God forbid the same)
            And Princes powre with Rebels might
            should runne abrode by fame.
            Would not the foes that now be still
            then buskell to come in▪
            
            When feebled is the lande of might
            by broyles that ye begin?
            Their holinesse and yours is like,
            they séeke but for to raine,
            And for your making of their way
            you shall of them be slaine.
            Therefore take counsell yet in time
            afore yée go to farre.
            Your Quéene, your Realme, and happie stat
                  •
               ,
            aboue all things prefarre.
            For make account▪ ye shall not bring
            the state to you to yeelde,
            You shall first fynd the englishe bloud
            to lie in many a féelde.
            
               
The sonne, the father, yee shall bring
            with dent of sword to stryke,
            The brother shall the brother méete,
            and doe also the lyke.
            In Princes cause no kith nor kinne
            affinitie nor blood
            Shall staye the subiect to set out
            to spende both life and good.
            With conscience good, and fayth full sure,
            though he be slaine in féelde
            Yet shall he as true subiect dye
            and so his soule vp yeelde.
            Whereas if you in fielde be slayne
            bicause ye did rebell
            By fact, your slaughter hath the waye
            to Deuills that are in hell.
            Who for bicause▪ they did arise
            against the Lord of might,
            
               
                  〈◊〉
                you doe now against his powre
            they lost eternall light.
            The fatherlesse that ye shall make
            and Widdowes in their wo
            Shall pray your fee in torments great
            to be for doing so.
            
               
Yea, of your owne that you shall leaue
            shall cursse you for your déedes,
            When they shall féele the plague to stretch
            to them, for your yll meedes.
            Bethinke your selues, and take aduice
            and spéedily repent:
            Accept the pardon of the Prince
            when it to you is sent.
            So may you saue your bodies yet,
            your soules and eake your good,
            And stay the Deuill, that hopes by you
            to spill much Christian blood.
            God saue our Quéene, and kéepe in peace
            this Iland euermore,
            So shall we render vnto him
            eternall thanks therefore.
            FINIS.
            
               ꝙ. (W. S.)
God saue the Queene
