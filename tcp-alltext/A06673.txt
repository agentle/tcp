            To the curteous and friendly Reader.
            
            
               AS it fares in the eſtate of al things that are ſo changed from their firſt, as if the Fathers of the firſt world liued to reuiſe this laſt, they ſhould hardlie learne to know that wherein then they liued. So fares it in this vſe of theſe triuiall toyes, which men were wont to cal by the names of ſome perſonages, whoſe liues or deaths were deciphered therein: but now framing their fancies to a new faſhion, they will needes haue them named according to their natures, Sicut trahit ſua quemque voluntas. And for my ſelfe was loath to breake ſquare, I haue intituled this Hiſtorie, The nature of a VVoman:
               
which though therein it anſwer not euerie mans priuat expectation in what they meane, yet could not I fit it better to the matter, containing indeede nothing but the enuious practiſes of two wicked women: wherein if any take offence, let him for this time winke at my fault, as rather affecting to frame my ſelfe to the new faſhion, that it ſhould be accounted new ſtuffe, then following the old be eſteemed as too ſtale.

            The ſecond part of the Hiſtorie, called the nature of a VVoman: contayning the trauaile of Perſeus, after he had fled from his Armie.
         
            CHAP. 1.
            
               AFter that the vnconſtant ſtate of neuer ſtayed fortune, had throwne downe theſe vnfortunate people from the height of thoſe heauēly pleaſures (which before they inioyed in proſperitie) downe euen to the loweſt degrée, of blacke bottomles aduerſitie. Firſt, in rooting out the hope of their ſuccéeding remembrance, likely to liue long after they ſhould dye, in their happie children. Then, with ye eating canker of al vndoing enuie, ſeuering aſunder by their warres their well grounded commonwealth, which they ſo long had gouerned in peace. And laſtly, laying vpon themſelues, that which their diſſention had ouerloaded their poore countrimē withall, the hard ſentence of exiles extremitie, more grieuous then the coldeſt kind of bitter pinching pouertie; a more diſmall diuorſiue ſentence, then is the ſeparation of a ſecure ſoule from an earthly bleſſed bodie: for that the one ends all aduerſitie, the other begins their after

miſerie: the one changes the ſtinking ſtate of this lothſome life into the neuer dying ioyes of heauenly felicitie: but the other with a countermanding courſe puls backe the forwarde fortune of mens ſtill mounting mindes, whom nature feedes with the hope of more and more happie bleſſings, into the deſpayring gulfe of all vndoing extremitie. This is the bridle where with foule fortune bindes in the ſtrong headed ſtate of many mightie Monarchies, when neither loue of vertue, nor hate of vice, feare of their friends ill, nor care of their owne weale, plagues at home, nor other puniſhment abroad, can pull backe to behold the wicked waies they haue ouer walked: then ſuffers ſhe them to perſeuer in their peeuiſh penance meriting purpoſe, till vnawares they bee aſſayled with the enuious incounters of vnlooked for exile, where they muſt weare out their age with ſorrow, whoſe youth was waſted in all ioy, and learne to eate the bitter bread of baniſhment abroad, that could not ſatiſfie themſelues with the abundant pleaſures of their countries content at home, and let their death conquering déedes dye in deſolation, which ſhould after death eternize their euer-liuing names, to their yet vnthought of generation, where no pen ſhall paint out their perfect picture, nor any tongue ſhall tell their true ſtories: but dye like the ſoule (wanting bodies) of brutiſh beaſts; the proceſſe of whoſe foreſpent life, no mans memories admits.
            Such was the harmefull hap of theſe now hopeles Kings, who whileſt with the ſun-ſhine of their luckie loue, they bleſſed the furtheſt borders of this their then thrice renowned regiment, made fortune proude that it lay in her power to aduance them. But now they vnaduiſedly haue broake downe the force of their brotherly affections, entring as nakedly into woe, as whilome when they were borne into the world, gins

like a guideles ſhippe to turne with euery toſſing ſea, that were wont to ſtand ſteady like two ſturdie rocks, till at length ſeuered aſunder to goe ſeeke their ſeuerall puniſhment. Perſeus that for his ſafegard had tane his way to the deſert hils, that with their height compaſſes that countrie, waſting many a wearie day in the ſad remembrance of his ſhipwrack, gins now by the ſowre ſawce of fortunes aduerſitie, iudge with himſelfe the pleaſure of his former proſperitie: and like a man that ſetled with himſelfe to trie the hardeſt brunts of this enuious ill lucke, now in ſtead of comfortable companie, to whom he might complaine his caſe, expels ſorrow with ſorrowe, and quench the fire of his inwarde foggie ſighes, by vttering to the eares of thoſe vnacquainted ecchoes, the harſh hiſtorie of his ill ending daies, delighting in ſtead of the replie of a fauourable friend, to heare the aggrauating eccho reſounding from the craggie caues of thoſe hollowe hils, the ſorrowfull ſound of woe ending words. Whereat the poore ſoule ſate downe and ſighed, till the ouer-charged burthen of his heart forcibly breaking out in abundance of chriſtall teares, did with ſacietie of ſorrowe make ſhew of eaſe to euill, which indéede had no ende: whoſe daylie plaints moued with their mo
                  •
               es, as the Thracian with his muſicke the hard and ruinous rockes, that vnderpropped the ſkie-brauing tops of thoſe mightie mountaines, to melt their marble ſides into the ſhew of melting teares, plaining of him that could not pitie himſelfe, and in ſtead of helping hands moues their ſenceles heads, as willing (though wanting power) to eaſe his agonie. Many dayes did he ſpend in this careful courſe, cutting out in capital letters vpō the barks of thoſe adioyning trées, the diſmall diſcourſe of this his pitifull plight, writing the records of his woes in the ſtony tables of hard marble rocks, that might incite the eyes

of euery trauailer to teares, and pitie his woes, whoſe wracke they could not preuent. At laſt, when euen wearie with wéeping, though ſtill full of teares, as is the nature of man gréedie of nouelties, gins with himſelfe deuiſe how in deſpite of that diſtreſſe, he might inuent ſome new-found forme to lament, whoſe ſorrows might ſatiſfie the effect of his intēt, and change the outwarde ſemblance of his ſorrowfull ſhewe: and ſitting him ſadly downe by a bubling ſpring, wherein he might ſee the reflexe of his ſorrowfull face, he thus begins in a ſong, to braue the hard brunts of his haples heart, that ſtill affoorded new fuell for his ſorrowes fire, freſh ſprings of teares for his watrie eyes, and ſtill replying words for his tragick tatling tongue.
            
               Ye merrie Muſes whoſe delightfull wits,
               Buſied in framing ſeuerall pleaſing ſongs,
               Come here and dwell by me where ſorrow ſits,
               Studying what tunes to wofull ſtraines belongs:
               Ile fit what euer inſtrument they bring,
               And by my voyce teach them how they ſhall ſing.
            
            
               The Bace a tragick touch of my heart ſtrings:
               The Tenor troubled ſighs that ſadly growes:
               Next that, my words where liuely ſorrow ſings:
               Then dolefull thoughts from whence deſpayre ſtill goes:
               And laſt in conſort ſhall my eylids goe.
               Whence teares deſtils like little worlds of woe.
            
         
         
            
            The manner how he met with his ſonne, who was ſuppoſed to be ſlaine, and what paſſed betwixt them two. CHAP. 2.
            
               AS thus hée ſate ſinging to himſelfe, (for ſaue himſelfe there was none to rue with remorſe the pitifull tale he ſo dolefully told) ſuddenly he might eſpie out of the thickes of a neighbouring wood, that grew vp in the boſome of a fayre forreſt, that was round about inuironed with a circle of mightie mountaines, like the forme of an artificiall Theater) whence from euery ſeueral ſide the idle beholders ſits, and ſees the arte of imitating acters) a bigge boned man, whoſe ſight was ſomewhat diſpleaſing to him at the firſt: for that ſuch is the compoſition of a melancholy complexion, as that fils the minde with a thouſand ſeueral ſorts of vaine ſuppoſitions: whereon the more he thinks, the more he findeth himſelfe to fall ſhort from his thought: and yet wanting indeede what he ſuppoſes to himſelfe, and deſires that he had, he contents himſelfe to thinke that he were, that he vainly ſuppoſes he is: and ſo oftentimes expelling the ſubſtance of ſorrow with the bare imagination of better fortune, hee is as loath to breake his conceit, as a king to forgoe his Crowne. Yet at the length, ſeeing the man to frame his iourney to the place where himſelfe then ſolitarily ſate, begins ſtedfaſtly to looke vpon his limmes, to ſee how nature did differ in her ſelfe, in diſtinguiſhing the ſhapes of ſauage Satyres, borne in the bare boſome of vnknowne

plaines, and ciuill ſubiects framed in the pampering palaces of courtly Kings, which he found not ſo farre off, as he ſuppoſed he ſaw: for the néerer he drew, the fairer was his ſhew. Naked he was, ſaue that for himſelfe he had framed an vnorderly coate of beaſts ſkinnes, that couered thoſe ſecrets which ſauage creatures abhorres to ſée: his haire for want of curious koming, hung lōg diſhiuered about his head, naturally curled in more cunning knots, then imitating arts, armes other men withall, whoſe ſable colour plaied with the glorious beames of the all guilding Sunne, as when he riſes from his watrie couch he guilds the Eaſterne ſeas with deceiuing ſhowes. In his face had nature cunningly cō
               bined two contrary ſhewes in one ſelfe ſame ſubiect loue and feare, ſmiling as ſmoothly on his friends, as amorous Adonis on his vaine intiſing Venus, and frowning as fiercely on his enemies, as mightie Mars on his feare-falling foes. Beautie had builded vp her bower, and in pride plumed her feathers in his face: but that for want of a ſunne-ſhadowing vaile, her varniſh was ſomewhat decayed. Young and luſtie was all his lims, ſtrong in the outward ſhew of conſtitution, & in his euery part dwelt all parts of péereles perfection, which drew the aged King into a wonder, that thoſe foule vnpeopled fields ſhould affoord ſuch faire framed formes. On the other ſide, the ſauage man (who till yt time had not béen acquainted with ſuch companie, nor before, that he could remember did euer ſée any one like himſelfe) makes more haſte vnto him then before it ſhould ſeeme hee intended. This man was Adrianus, ſonne to this forenamed Perſeus, of whom wée told you in the other part of this hiſtory, yt in his infancie he was by his wicked working Aunt ſent foorth into thoſe forreſts, with an intent to be betrayed to death: who by ye vnnatural loue of a Lioneſſe, had béen al this while brought

vp in that deſert, ignorant what hee was, becauſe hee wanted thoſe ordinary directions to tell him the truth: but that the inſtinct of nature had perſwaded him there were other creatures, then thoſe ordinary companie wherwith he daily dwelt, frō whom he muſt naturally deſcend: for that he ſeeing in the cōmon courſe of naturall increaſe euery beaſt bring foorth his like, it powerfully perſwaded him there were comely creatures like himſelfe, though it neuer till then was his lucke to ſee them: and glad in himſelfe that hee had at laſt wonne what he long had wiſhed, he made great haſte to climbe vp the wearie way, cut off the ſide of a hill to get vp to the place where he might ſee him ſit: to whom when at laſt he came, looking ſtedfaſtly in his face, pauſing long before his ſpéech, as vnacquainted with cunning ſalutations, wherewith commonly men curiouſly vſe to reſalute one another, gins with wilde, and yet wittie words, rudely, and yet rarely in his vnacquainted kind demand what he was, that had hit vpon that plaine, in which place in twentie long yeares (for that ſpace had he there ſpent) neuer ſaue himſelfe any ſuch creature came. To whom this curſed king, after he had throughly viewed his perfect proportion, wondring that ſo beautifull a bodie, adorned with ſo pregnant a witte, ſhould ſpring from thoſe vnfurniſhed fields: for as the Diamond that obſcured in an vneuen rocke, through the thicke ſlough of many ſlimie ſhadowes ſhewes as it is what it ſhould be: Roſes through tranſparant lawne ſets out their ſwéete ſubſtance by their fayre ſhewes: piercing ſtarres though obſcured oft with the couert of ſome ouer-ſhadowing clowde, yet through thoſe ſhadowes ſéemes no leſſe themſelues: ſo fared in the forelorne ſtate of this yet wild man, in whoſe face was ingrauen the characters of farre fayrer fortune, then is found in ſuch deſolate dwellings, whoſe words though

wanting that flattering forme wherewith other men vſe to paint their ſpeeches withall, yet with more diſcretion did they procéede from this vntutered truant, then vſually wee ſee from many of our beſt brought vp ſchollers: for in him was the picture of a perfect man, his bodie not bolſtered with the apiſh trims of conceited attire, his mind not nuſled vp in the ſlauiſh ſhadow of vaine and fruitles folly, his tongue had not taſted of that intiſing ſtreame that tips with ſeuerall tunes the ſtate of ſundrie tongues, turning them from the mould wherein nature firſt had made them to a new forme, wherein arte wil néeds faſhion thē, as ſome for feare, & other for falſhood to flatter: ſome for bribes with bitter words to betray, and other for folly to ſay and gainſay: ſome with fayre fawning words to vndermine their friends, and others with Synons ſubtiltie to outreach their foes: ſome with tatling tales to tell the ſureſt ſecrets of their firmeſt friends, and others with euill indeuours to deuiſe ſlanderous ſpeeches to ſpitefull ends. What ſhould we ſay on theſe ſorts that dims my mind, more with multitudes thē the ſeueral ſtarres in a winters froſtie night dazles the eyes with their numbers, paſſes the ſands on the ſhore, the drops in ye ſea, the ſeueral pebles in a ſhewer of haile, or ye infinite abundāce of ſeueral grains ripe Autumne reapes from the earths fayre face. To bee ſhort, there was perfection of bodie without the pampering of pride, vertue of mind without the varietie of miſleading manners, a true telling tongue that neuer taſted of a trifling tale: ſo héere was deciphered the difference betwixt the intent of nature in our firſt creation, and the euent of vſe in our education: for that the one firſt formes all things to the beſt, the other in the end frames them commonly to the worſt.
            Well, after theſe two had with ſuch gréetings ſaluted

one another, as beſeemed the melancholy diſpoſitiō of the one, and the rude bringing vp of the other, they with friendly curteſie companie together, where the ſanage man firſt begins earneſtly to aſke of the others eſtate: which the king fearfully fained to be but meane, and that hee hauing trod ye tract of an almoſt vnworne way, had by hard hap hit vpon that place: and being ignorant what way to eſcape, had there long lingered, as is the common vſe of ſuch diſtreſſed men, carefully conſidering with himſelf what way were beſt to work his owne releaſe from that waſt way wanting wilderneſſe. To whom the ſauage man gan thus anſwer. I that know not from whence thou cameſt, am farre vnable to direct thee whither thou ſhouldſt backe againe goe, and ſaue myſelfe liues there none here like to thée. Twentie fayre Summers flowers haue I ſéene fade in theſe fields, & ſuſtained the ſtubborne brunts of as many winter blaſts, ſéene the ſeuerall ſhapes of ſundrie beaſts, and marked their manners in their ſeueral kinds, how the ſtately Lyon proudly commands the other poore crouching creatures, and they in their kinde dutifully demeane themſelues to his ſoueraigntie: mine eares haue heard the ſeuerall ſounds of their ſundrie voyces, but could not diſtinguiſh them. Oft haue I ſpoke to the cruell beaſts, thinking they could ſkill of my words: but they all rudely runnes away without anſwering againe: then fearing leaſt that threatning wordes had with feare forced their flight, gan I with ſubmiſſe intreaties to craue their companies: but that as did the firſt periſhed without hope, and left me ſtill to mine ill happe, which oft vrged me to conſider with my ſelfe what my ſelfe might bee, differing in making, diſagréeing in manners, and failing of euery meanes that I made for my further inſtruction. No place is here that I haue not often ſought, to ſee of whom I

might iſſue: for that thus much hath nature taught me, that néedes I muſt come from a like kinde as doe all creatures els. Little I remember my ſelfe as I haue ſeene the young whelps of theſe careles creatures that poſſeſſe theſe plaines, and by the proceſſe of time am by degrées growne to this ſtate, wherein now thou ſeeſt I ſtand. And thus with a long diſcourſe gins he debate vnto him, how from his infancie to that age, he had liued in thoſe vnpeopled lawnes. At laſt, whē they with much interrogatory talke had paſſed away a long ſummers day, and that now the ſhadow of the ſilent night gan ſommon euery creature to their quiet reſt, the ſauage man loath to leaue his new found companion alone, to ſpend the ſolitarie night in that vncomfortable caſe, perſwades him to accompany him downe into the bottome of a declining valley, yt a farre off hee ſhewed him: who for that he had marked the trueth-ſhewing tales of his former talke, and being comforted by his well-wiſhing words, not to feare the furious onſets of outragious beaſts: for that ſuch was his acquaintance amongſt the vnreaſonable rulers of that foretold forreſt, as that like the quiet citizen within the peacefull walles of his houſe, is in the ſtealing ſilence of the quiet night (by the watchfull meanes of a wel meriting Magiſtrate) defended frō the forcible inuaſions of ill meaning enemies: ſo he in his quiet Caue ſecurely ſleepes, little fearing the furie of theſe bolde beaſts, in whoſe companie hee had alwaies conuerſed. At laſt, wonne with the words of this faire foretelling friend, the king wearie with ſolitarie ſitting there alone, and willing alſo to eaſe his head of thoſe cruell cares that ſolitarie diſcontent had clogged him withall, he willingly condeſcends to the others wiſh. Theſe two trauailing thus together, at the laſt comes downe againe into the bottome of the plaine, where (for it was now almoſt

night) were aſſembled diuers ſortes of ſundrie wilde beaſts readie addreſſed to go ſeeke their pray: amongſt whom when they came, as doth the ſillie ſheep to their acquainted ſhepheard, gently giue him way to trauaile where euer he will: ſo fares it with theſe two, that at their pleaſure trace theſe deſerts vp and down through many daungerous darke ſhades, that ouerſpreads the hidden caues of ſundrie ſubtill deuouring beaſts. At laſt they came downe into a long valley, where out of the ſide of a rockie cliffe was naturally hewed a déep hollow Caue, into which was a conueiance of light through the clift of a rocke that ouer-roofed this houſe: where the wilde man not vſed with curious welcomes to entertaine any ſuch gueſts, gins plainly performe the duetie of a well-meaning man, telling him that his good will wiſhed him better then his power was able to performe.
            Not long had theſe two ſitten alone in this loathſome beaſtly den, ere there comes in a bloudie mouthed Lioneſſe, bearing in her tearing teeth the quarter of a new killed Kid. This was that Lioneſſe that in the former part of this hiſtorie wee tolde you of found this young prince, deſolately forſaken in the deſert, whom ſhe in his infancie carefully brought vp, nurſing him with that milke wherewith ſhe ſhould haue ſuſtained her young ones, till the ripenes of yeares had ſtrengthened his ſtomacke, and made him now able with vſe to feede on raw fleſh with thoſe rauenous beaſts: for whoſe prouiſion this carefull nurſe had prouided that filly ſupper: who comming to her den, and finding there vnaccuſtomed companie, gins ſternly to ſtare in his face, as though ſhe ment to proſecute her angrie countenance, and terribly teare him in péeces with her vnmercifull clawes: till when ſhe ſaw the ſauage man (that had for his better ſafegard brought him downe

into the depth of that dungeon) friendly imbrace him in his armes, as though thereby he ment to reſcue him frō all inſuing harmes: then gins ſhe turne her frowning countenance to fawning cōpaſſion, her terrible threats to a tractable truce, kindly with her dumbe demeanour (ſuch as nature hath furniſhed theſe reaſonles creatures withall) entertaines this trauailer, licking kindly his hands, which otherwiſe ſhe could not kiſſe, ſoftly touching him with her hard talens as loath to hurt him 
                  •
               ow, whom before ſhe intended to harme. Thus with what curteſie their vnkindly cottage did affoord, doe they intertaine this their new com'd companion: who not vſed to eate ſuch vndreſſed diſhes, as their hungrie ſtomackes gently digeſted, was content that night to liue onely with looking on their kind of life, ſtil thinking to himſelf, what and how great was his own fall, that whilome being the commander of ſo many men, was now thus at the command of one ſilly beaſt. But for that neceſſities extremitie is comprehended within no bounds of ciuilitie, as alſo becauſe he feared if he ſhould againe fall into his olde frantick furie, it would alter the minds of theſe kindly vſing creatures to the execution of ſome other act: force of the one, and feare of the other, ſo brideled his boundles griefe, that perforce hee muſt needes refraine from ſheading thoſe mercie-mouing teares, which for all that he was ſcarſe able to detaine. At laſt, after the many terrors of that tedious night, gins the golden Sunne, by the forerunners of his fierie carre, tell to the world the gladſome approach of his comming, when as Aurora gins with her ſearching ſhew enter through the cloſe crannies of that clifted rocke: at whoſe approach wakens this ſauage man from his vnnaturall nurſe, and gréeting his gueſt with ſuch ſalutations, as then for want of better ſerued their turnes, he leades him from thence downe

lower to the ſide of a faire fountaine, that iſſued from the roote of a chriſtall rocke, whoſe water cléerer then the chriſtall from whence it came, reuiues the dead ſenſes of drooping beholders to looke vpon ye ſwift ſtreame, that with his bubling melodie (farre paſſing the murmuring muſickes of Aganippus wels, that waters the Arcadian meades) were able to draw the floting Dolphins from the watrie boſome of the ſea, to ſtand amazed at their muſick, as whilome they did at the well tuned ſtrings of ſweet Orions harpe, when from the cruel meanes of maſſacring marriners, they ſurely ſhielded him to the ſafe ſhore. There theſe two ſits them down to waſh their wearie bodies in that purifying ſpring, where the ſauage man ſtill vrging this vnfortunate King further to relate the manner of his life. At laſt, whether vrged by inward griefe, that moſt delighteth in deſpairing it ſelfe, or forced thereunto by the perſwaſions of this his ſauage ſonne, gins at laſt to declare the whole ſtorie of his ill ending raigne: firſt recounting the ſurpaſſing pleaſures that are compaſſed within the Crownes of Kings: then the honour they euery day receiue from many millions of ſeruiceable ſubiects. And when hee had largely related all theſe forepaſſed pleaſures, then like AEneas, when he deſcribed to woe weeping Dido, the ſunerall flames yt had fired fayre Ilions glorie, with ſad faced ſighs he thē ſettles him down to tell the tragick ſtorie of his owne fall. Which when this wild man had attentiuely heard, conſidering with himſelfe the great occaſion, that ſhould draw downe ſo many diſtilling teares from the eyes of ſo patient a creature, as he ſeemed to bee, gan thus anſwer his yet vnknowne father. If (quoth hee) with the vnſtable ſtormes of winde, the ſtrong Cedars that ſtoutly ſtands on the tops of high mountaines firmly rooted in flintie rockes, be ſo ſuddenly throwne downe, what

ſhall ſmall ſhrubbes ſhroode themſelues withall, who yet ſcarſe recouered, but entring the ſuperficies of the earth, is hardly able to abide the ſweete breathed Southerne blaſt? If ſuch bee the vnconſtant ſtate of your greateſt Kings, what is the fickle fortune of your ſeruill ſubiects? Then ſee I my ſelfe here happie in deſpite of fate, hauing naught wherein to ioy, I ſhall loſe nothing which ſhould vrge me to weepe. Much talke paſſed betwixt them to this effect, when as the King willing to be againe releaſed from that priſon, wherein he was perforce detained, fell in perſwading this wilde man to accompanie him into the peopled world, where he might liue with men, and leaue theſe wilde woods where was no company but beaſts, telling him the pleaſure was like to proceede from the one, and the laſting paines he ſhould ſtil be put into by the other. But ſo farre had the former tale of his riſing and ſudden falling diſſwaded him from dwelling in that Icie ſtay, where he that is ſureſt is vncertaine how long he ſhall ſtand, that he thought it better dwelling in a lowly valley, from whence lower he could not fall, then climbing to the height of a hill, where his fortune was euer in danger to fade. At laſt when the King perceiued all his labour loſt, he deſired his companion againe to conduct him to the place where before he found him ſolitarilie ſitting by himſelfe: which though he was loath to doe, fearing leaſt by that meanes he ſhould loſe his companie, yet notwithſtanding inforced by the earneſt intreatie of this his new found friend, he condeſcended to his requeſt. And they two together trauailed ſo long that at length they came downe into another dale on the other ſide of that hill where the morning before they met, through which lay many faire pleaſant paths that directed the way to euery adioyning place, where the ſauage man loath to ſtray too farre, leaſt he ſhould not

happily hit backe againe on his owne way, leaues his friend to his better fortune, where for a while we muſt alſo leaue them both, Perſeus in trauailing into the world to ſeeke ſome more faithfull friends, and Adrianus returned backe againe into the forreſt, to his accuſtomed companie.
         
         
            How Theſeus in his flight was intercepted by the theeues that firſt ſaued his daughter, and what followed of that. CHAP. 3.
            
               IN this time Theſers, that was the other brother, who after the ouerthrowe of his armie, had taken his way towards thoſe plaine forreſts yt borders vpon the banks of the ſea, was in his trauaile circumuented by many outlawes, that houering vpon the high wayes accuſtomably vſed to ſpoyle poore paſſengers, who ſeazing vpon that bootles pray, puls him perforce home to their caue, which was in that place where before wee tolde you his daughter was ſurpriſed by thoſe theeues, when her Aunts ſeruant intended to drowne her in that ſea that now ſeuers the Chriſtian coaſt from the bounds of ouer burned Barbarie. Where when he came, he begine cunningly to diſſemble his eſtate, leaſt by that meanes he might bee preuented of his further purpoſe, faining himſelfe to bee a poore countrie peaſant that had thither wandred from his way, alleaging ſimplicitie for his excuſe. And for that there remained now about

him no tokens that might tell from whence hée came: for to preuent that purpoſe, he had exchanged all his kingly robes with a baſe ſlaue, that in his flight he met by the way: whereby being beleeued by them to be what he barely affirmed himſelfe, and deſtitute of ſuch purchaſe as they promiſed themſelues he had béen poſſeſſed of, ſeeing him a goodly man like to ſtand them inſtead, they begin to perſwade him to follow that lewd life themſelues did there profeſſe, which was the robbing and diſpoyling of poore people, the neighbouring inhabitants of that curſed countrie. Whereto he for feare condeſcended, leaſt if he ſhould haue denied, their crueltie might haue cut away the hope of his after harueſt, which for all this trouble hee hoped in the ende to atchieue. And ſo walking homewards, in their way they began to inſtruct him in their théeuiſh occupatiō, he ſhould mercileſly ſpoyle the poore, robbe the rich, without remorce bereaue them of their liues, that ſtubbornly ſtand out againſt their indeuours. Spending ye time in theſe villanous practiſes, at length they drew néere home, where readie to intertaine them was the Captaine of theſe cōfederates walking with his wife, a goodly woman, richly attired with the pretious ſpoyles that theſe vnthriftie villaines had forcibly taken away from many true men in their trauaile. This woman was that Liuia that wee told you before was taken away from her friends, with an intēt to haue bin ſlaine: but reſcued by thoſe Outlawes, had a long time made her abode amongſt them, and as growing in yeares, ſo in beautie & commendable qualities, was at the length beloued of him that was chiefe Captaine of that cruell companie, and at laſt were married together, of whom he begot a fayre daughter, whoſe name was Larina, which they tenderly brought vp, thinking that one day fortune would ſo fauourably ſmile vpon them,

as to grace their gouernment, as that they ſhould by ſome meanes reduce it from barbarous outlawed crueltie, to authentick well gouerned ciuilitie. To theſe two their factors preſent this ſpoyle, which though he were poore, yet did hope perſwade them that he would ſupplie their neceſſitie in another matter, though he deceiued their expectations in the preſent poſſeſſion of ſuch rich prize, as commonly they were accuſtomed to finde of ſuch as they ſuſpected him to be. To bee ſhort, they intertained him well, becauſe they would incourage him to ſerue them with the like: where for a while he changed his ſometimes happie eſtate, to the inforciue furie of their more then brutiſh behauiour, where with they accuſtomed to handle all that came in their holde. At length, after he had long time inured himſelfe to this kind of companie, walking one day vnder the ſolitarie ſhadowe of a ſheltring rocke, vpon whoſe top thoſe people for their pleaſure had framed the forme of a gorgeous garden, and with great labour (for what wil not paines performe) planted diuers ſprings of ſeueral trées, that with their continuall comforting, with ſupplie of ſuch things as added more moyſture to their rootes, then the barren rocke, were growne vp very high, vnder whoſe ſhadow one d

               If euery creature make ſuch mirth
               To ſee his kindred in their kind,
               How then may I bewayle my birth,
               Which wants that meanes to cheere my mind?
               No tongue can tell where I was bred,
               Nor any happie man relate
               The place from whence I firſt was led,
               To weare here in this wofull ſtate.
            
            
               Unto whom he that all this while had heard her ſad ſong, begins thus to anſwer her in another ſort.
            
               And I muſt ſing another note,
               Whom fortune hath caſt downe
               From fames faire top, where I did flote,
               In ſorrowes lap to drowne.
            
            Whence ſhe looking downe to ſée what eccho ſhould readily in her owne vaine anſwere her againe, eſpies this new intertained ſeruant of theirs ſitting ſo ſolitarily vnder the ſide of a rocke, to whom ſhe cals to come vp vnto her into the garden, that ſhe might further conferre with him about his eſtate, which yet he made ſo ſtrange. To whom when he came, he begins rufully to lament his forelorne eſtate, telling her all the ſtorie of their vnbrotherlike ſtrife, euen vntil that preſent place wherein they were: whoſe many teares moued ſuch mercie in the eare of this paſſionate Ladie, as the promiſing her ayde to releaſe him from that thraldome, he boldly goes forward to diſcloſe the drift of his deuiſe, telling her that the ſcope of his intent was either to depart farre from the remembrance of that countrie, or els to ſtirre vp ſome neighbouring friends of his that dwelt in an adioyning Iland to thoſe confines, to riſe with him in armes for the recouerie of his kingdome: to the furtherance whereof, would ſhe but worke ſome meanes for his releaſe, if fortune & his forward ſtarres did but further his friends, he would ſo remunerat that good turne, as ſhe ſhould bleſſe the time wherein ſhe firſt intended ſuch an enterpriſe. Which when he had vehemently vowed, ſhe to auoyd ſuſpition ſends him away: and afterwards gathering from her huſband, and the reſt of their ſeruants, which way they meant the next daye to addreſſe themſelues, and ſo plotting her

purpoſe, ſhift his eſcape by a contrarie way, that night furniſhes him with all ſuch neceſſaries, as her poore prouiſion could affoord, and ſo ſecretly ſends him away: where we muſt a while leaue him in his trauaile to try his friends, and ſhe with her huſband in his homely rockie houſe, and come once more to thoſe wicked women, by whoſe meanes was growne all their miſerie.
         
         
            How the two Queenes met both together in the Lyons denne where Adrianus was brought vp, and how by his meanes they were reſcued. CHAP. 4.
            
               THey by the cenſure of the iuſt iudging ſenate, that had ſecretly ſearched almoſt the depth of their deuiſe, and by ſuch circumſtances, as the proceſſe of that little proofe they had did affoord them, ſound the greateſt fault of that furie in theſe worſe then wicked women, had for euer forbidden them further abode within the bounds of that kingdome, vntill they could by their accord ioyne thoſe againe that their diſcorde had diſſeuered, and bee themſelues the meanes of their peace, that of themſelues had bred their warres: who taking them to this ſeuerall ſearch, gins now frame themſelues to bee obedient to all that before were ſecond to none, clad in courſe ſackcloath that were not contented with rich ſilkes, ſpending the darke nights vnder the dolefull ſhades of Cipreſſe bowes, that had ſcorned the pleaſure

of princely beds; in ſtead of thoſe choiſe dainties whereon before they fed, now content with ye meaneſt meate that the earth did affoord. Doriabella that was wife vnto Perſeus the eldeſt brother, ſhe wandring through the vnknowne wayes of a wide forreſt, was there ſuddenly incountred in ye ſame place, where by her meanes her ſonne Adrianus ſho ulde haue béene murthered by the like lucke with a fierce Lioneſſe, of whom ſhe being afrayd, made meanes to eſcape away: but all in vaine, for the beaſt ſeazing vpon her bodie, countermands her courſe, and perforce carries her downe to the ſame den where ſhe foſtered her child: for this was the ſame Lioneſſe that ſaued Adrianus from the crueltie of that cutthrote caitiffe that had cunningly contriued his ende: where, for that the beaſt had ſome extraordinary intent, to prouide for her foſtered childe ſome companie of his owne kind for him to conſort withall, or that the Gods in their great vnſearchable wiſedome had lengthened out her life to a worſe intended end. This brute beaſt without offering her violent iniurie, which is a thing not commonly found in their kind, ſets her ſafely down in her caue, where ſhe quietly kept her till ſuch time as her companion came in, to whom with her fayre wonted fawning ſhe preſents her prize. The woman better imboldened at the ſhewe of a man, then ſhe was of the ſtill fearfull ſight of the beaſt, begins ſomewhat to recouer her loſt colour, and with fearefull cryes gins ſuddenly implore his ayde againſt the enuie of that her naturall enemie. At whoſe ſight the man ſomewhat ioyfull to ſee the ſhape of another, in whom was repreſented the ſhew of himſelfe, gins with his ordinarie intertainment to welcome her to that homely houſe, telling her that ſuch was the extraordinary nature of that beaſt, that ſhe would neuer harme any creature: and then falling into further talke, he begins to enquire of

her what drowe her downe into thoſe melancholy meades, where ſaue himſelfe ſeldome or neuer comes any ſuch creatures. To whom ſhe begins to relate a contrary courſe of her foreled life, fearing leaſt the very ſound of her voyce in reiterating the remembrance of her death-meriting deedes, would not onely incurre his anger, but ſtirre vp that ſenceles beaſt to wreake their woes, whom ſhe ſo vnworthily had wronged, and therfore tels him that ſhe was a woe wearied woman, that in her melancholy moodes bad left the poore place where ſhee dwelt, to ſoiourne in ſome vncoth vnfrequented ſhade, where no delightfull day might ſolicite to her ſad memorie, the loue of her forepaſſed life no chéerefull ſunne might cheriſh her cold chilled limmes, nor pleaſant newes of neuer dying ioy might bring her backe againe to her former felicitie. At which tale the wild man, though himſelfe had neuer felt the force of powerfull paſſions, that winds mens bodies like a workmanſhip in waxe: yet pitying that in her he neuer taſted in himſelfe, tels what trueth tolde him, that hard was her hap to change her chéerefull conſorting companie of friends, to deſolations ſad diſcomforture amongſt her foes, to come from whence ſhe was firſt brought vp, to that place where ſhe was finally caſt downe, except (quoth he) you can frame your fancie to vndergoe the beaſtly behauiour of theſe vnciuill creatures, amongſt whom I now liue, and with whom I meane to dye: for ſuch a rumour heare I to runne of the inconſtant courſe of mightieſt monarchies, which alſo in ſome I haue ſeene true, that from the higheſt braunch they are oft bowed downe euen to the loweſt barke of the bulke, that I finde more ſwéete content in this vnchangeable ſtay, then they in their ſtedfaſteſt ſtate. In which talke they beguiled the time, till night ouertaking them both, admits no more interpaſſage of

friendly ſpéech, where he to his ordinarie reſt, and ſhe to her accuſtomed complaints, betakes themſelues, ſhée telling in ſecret to her ſad heart the heauy burthen of her groaning griefes, whoſe heauy ſoule melted with the inforciue furie of her ſtill crying ſorrow, deſtils in amber teares: ſometimes ſhe thinkes of her huſband, and then hope helpes her vp with this thought, that though long, yet they ſhall againe méete at laſt. Then remembers ſhe the children, as well that of her owne as the other, that by her meanes was maſſacred, ſuppoſing heauens had heaped iuſt vengeance vpon her for her former ſinnes. And laſtly, when ſhée thought vpon her ſelfe, then comes dead death with his craſie coloured countenance, and inforces her not to bluſh for ſhame, as doe the outward ſhewes of offenders, but looke pale for pitie as the vſe of ſuch guiltie guides, that not onely leades themſelues into that recureles gulfe of neuer recouering griefe, but alſo intiſes other into a world of woes, from whence there is no retiring. Thus did ſhe preuent that which euer was aſſaying to preuent her, the all ſtilling ſtate of ſecure ſléepe, where her thought was ſtill ſtumbling of ſome ſinne, whoſe iuſt iudgement was likely to inſue vpon her after life, till in the ſecret of the ſilent night there ſuddenly ſounded ouer their heauie heads ye noyſe of a fearefull purſute, as though ſome angrie beaſt had inſolently riſen vpon another ſimpler ſort, where ſuddenly into the Caue where they then lay, deſcends downe the likenes of a liuely creature, not ſuch as was wont to accompanie them in their Caues, but others that elſewhere, with vntimely diſturbance waken the ſleeping wits of watchfull men, at which they were all affraid. The Lioneſſe for that ſhe theſe many daies had neuer béen in any ſuch ſort diſturbed; the man for that ſince his firſt comming thither, hee neuer viewed any

ſuch thing; the woman for that ſhe dreamed of ſome extraordinarie euent that ſhould inſue of that ſudden vprore: but as euery wonder becomes at laſt more ordinarie then it ſhewes at the firſt, ſo in the end by the ſhadow ſearching Moone, they might more eaſily eſpie that which had driuen them all into this extraordinarie doubt, the ſubſtance of the other ſiſter, whoſe fault was equal with the firſt, and ſo was her repentance as readie as any of the reſt. But how ſudden ſorrow ouertooke her heauie heart, in finding that in the ende from which ſhe fled in the beginning, a Lyon from whoſe clawes ſhe thought ſhe had cléered her ſelfe. But as it fares in the euer ſwelling ſurges of the ſenceles ſeas, that the weary water working men fall from the gréedie gripe of Sillaes ſhiuering ſhores, into the couert of Charibdes cruel courſe: ſo fares it with her that flying from the bare ſhew of death, was fallen into darknes it ſelfe. Where when ſhe ſaw ſo many contraries coupled in one ſubiect, as crueltie with curteſie, fell inforciue furie with friendly for bearing fellowſhip, reaſonable caitiues there ſubiect to vnreaſonable creatures, ſoule poſſeſſing bodies with ſauage profeſſing beaſts. But at lēgth ſhe ſatiſfied with the ſhew of them, and they glutted with gazing on her, the ſauage man as curteouſly begins to welcome her, as he gaue gentle gréetings to the other, and with ſuch wordes as his yet vnkindly curteſie did affoord, intertaines her. And for that the trouble some time of the night did not afford ſuch ſhew of further fauour, as by his promiſe he purpoſed to performe in the day: ſhe by the other ſoftly ſits downe her ſelfe, betwixt whom you muſt now imagine ſuch dumb demeanes of friendſhip, for feare to procéed, as whileſt they were, well could not come from curteous loue. There doe theſe two with outwarde ſhewes diſplay ones plaints to the others paſſions. Many dumbe

demeanes paſſed betwixt theſe two, till after long lingering ſhewes, that with their diſſembling ſhadowes, had lulled againe into a ſlumber theſe two careles creatures, whoſe nature ſuſpecting nothing els but naked trueth, without all further inquiſition fals againe faſt aſléepe: which when theſe two wofull women had warilie weyed, they taking this aduantage of time, gins quickly one to murmur to another the euents of their ſeuerall iournies. And here muſt I now leaue further to enuey againſt their enmitie, and talke now of their ſolemne contrition, wherein we muſt not wey the ruine of their childrens rape, but the remorce of their ſins remembrance: faults that are péeuiſhly perſecuted, deſerues the pitie of no one: but crimes wilfully committed, with the remedie of repentance are mightlly amended. Which in theſe two proued moſt true: for there each other confeſſing to themſelues in theſe perils the daungers they did one to another in their peace, with womaniſh woe that ofter in teares more bewayles their vnfortunate ends, then they foreſec their two forward beginnings, and then with many teares tormēts themſelues too much, which they might well haue preuented with a little, curſing too late that which is come at laſt vpon thoſe crimes they committed at the firſt. And here let me ſhew their vnconſtant ſtate, not ſtanding alwaies in a ſtay, but wauering like the winde, ſometimes proſecuting with loathed diſdaine, them which once they did follow with louing deſire: then changing their copie as cowards do their countenance, that wauer with the wind of euery buzzards blaſt, they againe begin to deſire what before ſo déepely deteſted: ſometimes with haſtie men too ſoone bréeding their own ſorrowe, and then with ſloathfull ſiuggards deferring too long to ſalue their owne ſores, oftentimes weauing their owne woe, when they ſuppoſe they worke anothers

wracke. For ſo vnwarie are their wits, that they neuer think of that ſhould follow, from the force of that which goes before: but like the vnfortunate Larke that drawne downe with the dazeling glide of a deceiuing glaſſe, delighting ſo long in his game till he be catched in the gin: ſo fares it with theſe fond fooles, that God knowes are too gréedie of ſome ſiluer deceiuing ſhewes, and yet buſie enough to bite off others golden baites. Yet not ſo prouident as the poore Sparrowe, that hauing eſcaped the foulers fetter, with her chéerefull chirping giues notice to the reſt of her neighbours: but where themſelues haue ſeene many fall, they yet deſperatly follow.
            Here might I extend this Satyricall vaine, but that I wil not be accounted as one that loathes what other mē loues: & therfore wiſh they could amend what euen themſelues ſees plainly amiſſe, and in themſelues learn to feare that, which by example of their owne ſexe they cannot beware. And thus pitying them, whoſe hurt reſts onely in themſelues to helpe, I will referre you to wonder at theſe two wicked women, whoſe déedes had ſo far diuided thē, till that vnlooked for luck had met them together againe in that deſolate place, whom deſeruing diuorce had parted in their peopled palace: there gin they one to another relate the tragicke ſtorie of their forepaſſed purpoſes in their diuers imaginations of each others iniurie, till at laſt according in one conſent they mutually moue what they had malitiouſly ment, till that lamenting each to other their lewd liues, they with inſtant iutreaties ſolicites the neuerſayling forces of all helping heauens, that with fauour they would looke vpon their faults that had indéede deſerued their iuſt frownes. For ſuch muſt I néedes ſay is the compoſition of thoſe, though often careles, yet more vſuall comfortable creatures, that if for want o
                  •
               
               
well guiding gouernment they ſometimes fade, yet ſeldome doe they for euer fall. For ſuch is their flexible nature, as like the Philoſophers table they willingly impoſe vpon themſelues euery ſeuerall impreſſion, but commonly their nature nouriſhes but one: as when the profit prouing merchant viewes the ſeuerall ſorts of ſundrie commodities, though there be many that hée well could like of, yet is there but ſome fewe that eſpecially he can loue: ſo is it in the ſeldome ſecuritie of this ſexe, that buſying themſelues with many, they binde themſelues but to a few. Nay, ſhall I compare them to a fitter forme of reaſon reſembling creatures, as when the Lapwing houering farre from her neſt, ſéemes to deſcry the daunger of her young néere hand, which hée that ſuffers his patiens to ſearch ſhall finde farre off: ſo haue I heard it proued true of them, whoſe policie in this I muſt néedes approue, if well performed to bée perfect: for that they colour thereby the cunning of their own ſkill, and withdraw the otherwiſe beholders affections farre off, not to looke to that practiſe they in ſuch ſecret performe. But now leaue we thē in this inforciue peace, y• end of their ſelfe-wrought warre, learning to liue like the Lion in feare, that lightly before regarded the libertie of loue, and looke backe againe to our firſt painfull pilgrime.
         
         
            How Perſeus came to the Court of Ferdinand the French King, and of him got ayde for the recouerie of his countrie. CHAP. 5.
            
               PErſeus ſeeking ſome refuge after he had forſaken the companie of his vnſuſpected ſonne, at laſt directs his

courſe to clime the mightie Alpes, and goe renew his acquaintance now in France in his age that he had got there in his youth, where his olde father had kept him long at ſchoole to learne there the rudiments of arte, whereof their owne countrie was not then ſo well ſtored: where comming to the Kings court, was at the firſt lightly receiued of them, whom ſometimes hée had graced with his companie: imitating the example of vnmerciful maſters, that when a ſillie ſeruant, wherein was ſometimes their treaſure, fals by miſhap to any ſudden miſchance, thē preſently accounts he not of him ſo w
                  •
               ll as of a ſlaue, whō he was wont to vſe familiarly as his friend. Yet at the laſt vncouering the cauſe of his care, and with teares telling them the truth of two true ſtories, Ferdinand (for ſo was then that French kings name) pitying the ill happe of his age, of whom there was ſuch great hope in his youth, anſwers him againe in teares, the enſignes of griefe, and comforting on him vp with the preſages of more fauourable fortune, gins bid him but deuiſe with himſelfe how hée might any wiſe doe him good, and he would willingly not onely imploy his countrie and kingdome, but hazzard his owne health to doe it, though now death had diſplayed his colours on his hoarie head, and curriſhly counterchecks his courage. Which reply ſo relieued the dying countenance of this other worſe then captiue king, as that calling backe his de
                  •
               aying ſences, whoſe vigores were now all muſtering about the labouring heart, euery one expecting a ſundrie anſwere for their ſeuerall releaſe, makes him begin againe to looke for longer life, who before deſired nothing more then a ſpéedie death. And firſt with humble thankes rendring to the king he begins to explaine vnto him his intended purpoſe, which was, that if hee could by his friendly fauour get but againe together a moytie of

thoſe men which before he had miſſed, and by his owne negligence vndone, his intent was againe to inuade his countrie, and ſet himſelfe once more in his kingdome. To whom the old king offered all ſpéedie ayde he was able to performe, whom we leaue a while muſtering their ſouldiers to ſend ouer the Alps into Italie, and now talke of Theſeus.
            
         
         
            How Theſeus perſwading the King of Barbary to the ſpoyle of his countrie, obtained the ayde of the Moores. CHAP. 6.
            
               
                  THeſeus, who after by the means of his vnknowne daughter had fréed himſelfe from that danger, ſhipping himſelfe in a little gallie that was then going ouer into Africa, hee committeth himſelfe to y• mercie of the ſeas, from whom the well wiſhing windes had ſoone ſet him free. Where when he came, he politikely begins to conſort himſelfe with a noble man, whom the blacke king of that countrie had before (whileſt theſe two brethren did together louingly ſway the Scepter of their quiet kingdome) imployed vpon ambaſſage vnto them, and vnto him delates his drift, telling how he by the means of mutinous ſubiects, was wreſted out of his countrie and kingdome, & driuen to ſeeke reliefe in that ſtrange ſoyle, proteſting that if he could by any meanes come by ſufficient ſupply of men and munition, that would but in reuenge of theſe iniuries ouerrun his countries,

he not looking againe to poſſeſſe his Crowne, would yéeld vp both the ſpoyle of his countrie and the poſſeſſiō of his kingdome to the conquerour. To which pleaſing tale the Moore giuing ſome eare, for that in them was rooted an old grudge againſt the Italians, ſpurs ſpeedily to the King to certifie him of this offered occaſion of rigorous reuenge vpon their old enemies. To whom he liſtening, deſirous both to ſcourge that countrie that had oft ſcourged him, and alſo to inlarge the bounds of his kingdome beyond the border of the binding ſea that ſeparates thoſe ſeuerall parts of the world, and kéepes the inhabitants within the compaſſe of their owne countrie, offers haſtie helpe to the performance of the others requeſt, and in the meane time whileſt all theſe things were making readie, they contrary to their former ſort of ciuilitie, gētly entertaine him, vnder whoſe colour they were in ſuch hope of ſucceſſe in thoſe wiſhed warres. Now begins the coale black curres reioyce within themſelues in very conceit of conqueſt, diuiding the ſpoyles before they were about to begin the battell, telling of their triumphs before they well knew what it was they ſhould winne: here are whole Dukedomes caſt away at dice vpon a drummes head, before they almoſt dreamed what it was that ſhould be had: where wee will a while leaue them two prouiding their pretended forces for Italy, and come againe to the Outlawes, where wee left Liuias daughter coupled in marriage with their chiefe Captaine.
         
         
            
            How the Outlawes ſeeking their pray, by chance met with Adrianus the wild man, and how they perſwaded him to leaue that place, and what followed therof. CHAP. 7.
            
               THey after their cuſtome, diuiding themſelues into diuers cō
               panies, ſearches al ye conueying wayes of their countrie for to finde ſome fit pray, where ſome of them trauailing further thē their accuſtomed compaſſe, becauſe fortune had not affoorded them ſuch fauour as at the firſt to ſpéede themſelues, they were therefore inforced to followe the trace of ſome way, in which they hoped at laſt (though it were too long) to méete with ſome or other bootie that would bountiouſly guerdon their trauaile. So long they traced to and fro that they got vp to the top of a high hill, whence they might ſee downe belowe in the dale a man alone, whoſe ſhew was not ſuch as they wiſhed, trimmed vp in gorgeous golden apparell, but couered with a beaſts ſkinne on his backe, bearing a knottie club, ſuch weapons as nature there had framed for him, and walking vp and downe in theſe deſerts, made the ſillie beaſts with obeiſance crouch to his countenance, as did Alcides terrifie the furies in the boſome of burning hell. This was Adrianus that was there alone walking the wide circute of thoſe melancholie meades, to whom they poſting apace, thinking by ſurprizing him, though of himſelfe they ſhould reape

ſmall commoditie, yet by his meanes they might bee directed to ſome more profitable place. This ſauage man looking back, and ſéeing ſo many ſuddenly deſcend from the top of ye hil, whoſe vnorderly approach as he ſuppoſed, pretended little good: he naturally foreſéeing what inconueniences might followe, addreſſing himſelfe to his defence with his naturall wrought weapon, which was a young oken plant, and perceiuing them eſpecially to ſhape their courſe to him, ſtoutly ſtands ſtill to ſee ſome end of their actions. To whom when they came néere, his fierce countenance halfe afrighted them, that ſtanding all ſtill like the ſtarre gazers at the tranſforming head of Gorgon, durſt not once ſo much as enquire what he was, till one hairebraine companion taking the aduantage of his weapon, that was not vſed to the cunning ſleights of fence, got quickly within him, and ſhifting himſelfe from the weightie fall of his club, ſuppoſed with ſome nimble ſleight to ouercome him: which when the ſauage man perceiued, getting hold of him with one of his hands, before the other had performed his purpoſe, giues him ſuch gripe as ſquiſies perforce the pithie marrow from moſt of his ſtrength bearing bones, and ſo leaues him ſuddenly ſlaine, that intended ſuch vnacquainted iniurie to him. Which whē the reſt of his fellowes ſaw, being about fortie in number, though halfe afrayd all of them to ſet vpon that ſillie one, yet loath to leaue their fellowes ruine vnreuenged, they begin altogether to aſſault him, who with the weight of his weapon delt ſuch right downe blowes amongſt them, as whoſoeuer it lighted on it quite killed, or at the leaſt lamed them. Long continued their combat, for that they ſuſtained the foile, and therefore were loath for their credits to leaue the field: yet at ye length being almoſt halfe of them ſpoyled, or quite ſpilled, the reſt diſpayring to runne away, leaſt he ſhould ouertake

their flight, in all humilitie ſuddenly throwes downe themſelues at his feete, intreating fauour for their raſh offence, and that their fellowes death might ſatiſfie his deſire: on whom his gentle nature could not inflict further furie, but with a good will accepts their homage as they offer their humilitie. And then falling into further conference, begins diſcourſe vnto him what they were, and to what ende they were come thither, whom he handles with all humilitie, laying open vnto them his owne eſtate, his manner of life in thoſe peopleles places, and what euer had happened vnto him ſince his firſt remembrance, carrying them home to his Caue, and there letting them ſee the manner of his life, where they found ſorrowfully ſitting theſe two ſad ſiſters, whoſe fore ill ſpent liues had brought vpon them this loſſe, to whom he alſo begins to relate the ſtrange manner of their arriual. At laſt, after they had walked with him round about the borders of his bounds, they begin to diſſwade him from that beaſtly place of abode to goe abroad into the world, and there learne to liue like a man, ſhewing what daunger was in the one, and what delight in the other, perſwading him that by ye meanes time would try the trueth of this his fedious ſearch, in be wraying the meanes by which he was brought thither. Unto whom a great while he would giue no eare, becauſe it ſhould ſeeme that contented eſtate wherein he then ſtoode ſo fitted his humour, as that he little regarded all the gay ſtories they could tell him of glorie or dignity, wealth, or whatſoeuer good thing this world doth giue. Yet at the laſt with their inceſſant perſwaſions, he determined a while to goe trie the trueth of their ſtorie: but with this promiſe, that as they profered honeſtly to vſe himſelfe, ſo ſhould they alſo kindly comfort thoſe two diſtreſſed women, that had vnhappily ſtraied from their homes, and rely them only vpon

his reliefe. Which they with many proteſtations ſolemnely promiſed to doe. And ſo in the end taking away with him thoſe two, by whoſe meanes he was made the ſubiect of that nuſchāce, departed altogether from that place, and iournied towards their homes againe. In which way nothing was done, ſaue that they ſtill were telling one to another the ſtorie of their foreled liues: and with that tattle beguiling the time, till they came to the place where was their abode, and there preſenting to their Captaine their pray, they begin to relate what happened them in their iourney. Thus with many ſalutations was he intertained, and often imployed in their affayres, wherein he ſo proſperouſly procéeded, as that he was not onely beloued of all the companie, but déerely eſtéemed of their chief Captaine, and ſo ſtill imployed abroad. In the meane time were the poore Quéenes, whom fortune had thus baned to and fro, buſied at home: for by this time were theſe Outlawes waxen excéeding rich, and their Captaine intirely affecting Liuia his wife, daughter to one of theſe vnknowne Quéenes, had carefully prouided her of the curiouſeſt conceits that all that countrie did affoord: where, for that theſe two women that had ſometimes béen Princes ouer many people, could well ſkill of that kind of pāpering pride which women are wonted to vſe, grew in ſuch great requeſt with their Ladie, that aboue all her attendants they eſpecially were honoured. Here hence grew they again into a new mutinie which of them ſhould beſt deſerue to bee deſired, one priuilie ſeeking to ſpoile what another had curiouſly conceited, the other practizing means to hinder her ſiſters work, that it might proue of little worth. Long in this ſort gan they diſagrée, till at laſt with their enuious emulation they ſtirred vp all the aſſemblie to ſuch ſtrife, as had not the care of the charie Captaine in time reformed,

it had brought ſelfe-working harme vpon their owne heads. Such was the grounded malice of theſe two cruell creatures, as that though feare in extremitie made them agrée as friends, yet in the leaſt ſhew of péeping proſperitie they begin again the fierce aſſaults of deadly foes. Who for the better agréement of their whole houſe, they were glad to ſeparate in twaine, to ſée if that bred friendſhip being aſunder, that brought out nothing but hatred betwixt them whileſt they were together.
         
         
            How both the Kings brought their borrowed armies both together into the countrie, and how the citizens leuied armes againſt them, and what was the end of that warre. CHAP. 8.
            
               IN the meane time whileſt theſe things had thus happened, the two diſſeuered Kings (of whō before wee tolde you) had brought in both their ſeuerall ſupplies of men and munition for the conquering of their loſt kingdomes, and pitching their tents vpon the territories of that carefull kingdome, begins with intermiſſiue meſſages to ſommon the inhabitants, to render ouer againe that rule which ſo long they had retained. Where in the Senat houſe at one time méetes both theſe meſſengers, crauing the kingdome for their ſeuerall maſters: yet till that time thoſe curſed Kings had not heard what was become one of another. To whom

the Senatours wiſely with curteous countenances gaue this anſwer: That for ſo much as they were there met to challenge the kingdome ſeuerally to themſelues which ſhould bee ioyntly inioyed of them both, pleaſed but their Lordſhips to giue them leiſure for theſe fewe dayes to conſider of this caſe, and then they would anſwere them both to their owne contents. With which anſwere the meſſengers departed back againe to their ſeuerall maſters. After whoſe abſence, theſe carefull pillers of that crafte Common-wealth, begins to conſider with themſelues what were beſt to doe in theſe daungerous dayes. At length they thought good themſelues, that to auoyde the inconueniences which was likely to light vpon them by this purpoſe, it were beſt for them, as they did at the firſt, to gather forces together: for by other meanes they would not bée appeaſed, and by that deuiſe aſſay to driue them backe againe. Which the better to effect (for that countrie was ſcarſe able of it ſelfe to affoord ſufficient force for that fight) they preſently diſpatch aſſurance of pardon, and promiſe of rich rewarde and great dignities to the Captaines of all thoſe Outlawes, that were incamped in ſeuerall places of that countrie, if but by ſuch a day they would bring in their ſeuerall powers, to the ende they might augment their armie againſt theſe home-borne enemies. Which proclamations was ſo effectually performed, as that within a ſhort time there were gathered together an infinit number of ſuch people as liued in the mountains, and other remote places of that countrie, vpon the ſpoyle of other people: amongſt whom was the band of Outlawes, wherein Adrianus was intertained: who being gathered altogether, began to addreſſe themſelues to the ſeuerall functions in furniſhing themſelues to the field. In the meane time came the day wherin they were to giue anſwer to their

ſeuerall demaunds. At what time comes back both the Harolds to knowe their determinations. To whom the Senatours foreappoynted for that purpoſe, begins thus mildly to reſolue them in their requeſts. Since (quoth he) the ſtate of theſe times wherein wee now liue, requireth ſuch ſuretie of ſafegard, as may withſtand the enuious force of any froward fortune, wée to preuent the purpoſe your ill meaning maſters intende, which is no leſſe then the ruine and decay of our whole Common-wealth; as ſtrongly as wee may haue here furniſhed our ſelues with ſuch forces, as this time and place could affoord. But for that once (which we muſt euer confeſſe) they were our happie Kings, though now they be vnhappie people, and that of right to them doth belong this gouernment that wee now guide, if they ſetting aſide all ſiniſter hate, will come and friendly againe repoſſeſſe this Crowne and kingdome, and with mutuall loue ſtriue to maintaine that, which with their enuious emulation they now maſſacre and maime, then on our ſhoulders will we beare their burthens, and with according ſtrength helpe them to ſtay this tottering ſtate, which their déedes haue almoſt brought to decay: but if incenſed with the fire of furious flaming enuie, they wil not worke their thoughts conformable to this thing, but with fire and ſworde will néedes lay waſte this ſometimes worthie Commonwealth, then will wee oppoſe our ſelues againſt their threats, and ſeeke ſuch a mends for this miſchiefe, as ſhall with iuſt iudgement pull downe their puffed vp plumes, and turne them out againe into the wide world to become a worſer ſkorne of miſchance. With this anſwere the meſſengers departing: and hauing tolde at home their ſeuerall tales, it ſo diſpleaſed the Princes, that preſently without further delay they would the next morning furiouſly with both their forces ſet vpon

the gouernours of their countrie, and when they had conquered them, then be take themſelues to ſtriue whether ſhould bee ſole conqueror. Word whereof being ſpéedily brought to the Senatours, they againſt ye next morning gins prepare all their power, and pitching their battell vpon the boſome of a broad plaine that lay betwixt the enemies leaguers, made offer to fight with them both at once. Which when the enemies ſaw, they as readie to take the occaſion as the other to offer, gins furiouſly to ſet vpon them, where ioyning ſtreight at handie ſtroakes, there followed a long and furious fight, the victorie to neither part declining, till at laſt Adrianus that then had the charge of a Cornet of horſe, breaking into the bowels of the enemies battels, wrought ſuch wonderfull atchiuements, as made him iuſtly accounted for the beſt approued ſouldier that that countrie did euer containe, with whoſe worth the foes were ſo diſcōfited, that on a ſudden affrighted they betooke themſelues to flight, whom he eagerly following ouertooke the two Kings, that by chance had met in the battel, eagerly occupying their ſeete to eſcape y• ſcourge of their enemies hands, whom hee ſurpriſing brought backe againe to their homes, and preſented them to the Senate as the firſt fruites of his fortune. Where by this time were gathered together the moſt of thoſe gouernours, to gratulate their forward friends that were returned ſafe from the fight, who wondering at his worth, could not ſufficiently commend his courage: but conſulting now with themſelues what were beſt to be done in this dangerous buſines.
         
         
            
            How after that theſe two Kings were ouercome, Adrianus was choſen king of that countrie, and how he came to know his father and mother, by which the former falſhood was deſcried. CHAP. 9.
            
               AT laſt they thought it beſt, that ſince theſe two balefull brethrē did euen in their captiuitie ſtill deny to take vpō them the mutuall gouernment of that kingdome, intended for their after quiet to chooſe ſome one of theſe worthies yt had there wrought their releaſe. And for that they would not incurre the diſpleaſure of any of thoſe coequall Captaines, that had ſo brauely demeaned themſelues, a motion was made amongſt them, that for ſo much as there was no lineall ſucceſſion left for the inheritance of their kingdome, they then had thus determined to caſt lots amongſt them all ſo to chooſe their King: which fell vpon Adrianus, of whom they were as glad as his owne hap was good, who with euery ſeuerall ceremonie belonging to the coronation of ſuch a King eſtabliſhed in that countrie, hée firſt recals from their baniſhment all thoſe Outlawes by whom he was brought thither, and preferring of his friend and ſometimes his Captaine, to a place of great authoritie in his kingdome, taught him to imploy his wit in the building of that Common-wealth vp againe, the which afore he laboured to pull downe. This Captaine we tolde you

before had by Liuia his wife a fayre daughter named Laryna, to whom Adrianus in the time of his abode in her fathers houſe had oftentimes made loue, and ſhée with like fauour requited him, who but for the ſudden ſound of theſe new wrought warres, had by the conſent of their parents before inioyed the pleaſure they both ſo inſtantly deſired, who then comming to the Court with her mother, the two captiue Quéenes, and the reſt of their retinue, was preſently by the conſent of the Senate, who deſired nothing more then ſome iſſuing heires that might ſucceſſiuely follow in the poſſeſſion of this kingdome, coupled in marriage with this new King. After which ioyfull day, the King and the Quéene, with the reſt of the Nobles gathered together, cals in thoſe captiue brethren to know the cauſe whence grew their diſcord, and the two women to inquire of them what had béen the manner of their former liues. Where when they were all met, the old Quéenes ſéeing their huſbands there faſt in fetters, touched with a remorce of conſcionce, fals downe before them, and there confeſſed the whole courſe of their liues, and the murthering of their children. By the circumſtances of whoſe tale and the time thereof, theſe two loſt children there found out their ſeuerall parents: and ſo faults on both ſides forgiuen, and iniuries on euery part made euen, they ſpent the reſt of their dayes in ſolemne contrition for their former faults.
