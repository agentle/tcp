of Romeus and Iuliet, written
firſt in Italian by Bandell,
and nowe in Engliſhe by
Ar. Br.
            In aedibus Richardi Tottelli.
Cum Priuilegio.
         
         
            
            
            To the Reader.
            
               THe God of all glorye
created vniuerſallye
all creatures, to ſette
forth his prayſe, both
thoſe whiche we eſteme
profitable in vſe
and pleaſure, and alſo thoſe, whiche we
accompte noyſome, and lothſome. But
principally he hath appointed man, the
chiefeſt inſtrument of his honour, not
onely, for miniſtryng matter thereof in
man himſelfe: but aſwell in gatheryng
out of other, the occaſions of publiſhing
Gods goodnes, wiſdome, & power. And
in like ſort, euerye dooyng of man hath
by Goddes dyſpenſacion ſome thynge,
whereby God may, and ought to be honored.
So the good doyrges of the good,
& the euill actes of the wicked, the happy
ſucceſſe of the bleſſed, and the wofull
procedinges of the miſerable, doe in
diuers ſorte ſound one prayſe of God.
And as eche flower yeldeth hony to the

bee: ſo euery exaumple miniſtreth good
leſsons, to the well diſpoſed mynde. The
glorious triumphe of the continent man
vpon the luſtes of wanton fleſhe, incourageth
men to honeſt reſtraynt of wyld
affections the ſhamefull and wretched
endes of ſuch, as haue yelded their libertie
thrall to fowle deſires, teache men to
witholde them ſelues from the hedlong
fall of looſe diſhoneſtie. So, to lyke effect,
by ſundry meanes, the good mans
exaumple byddeth men to be good, and
the euill mans miſchefe; warneth men
not to be euyll. To this good ende, ſerue
all ill endes, of yll begynnynges. And to
this ende (good Reader) is this tragicall
matter written, to deſcribe vnto thee
a coople of vnfortunate louers, thralling
themſelues to vnhoneſt deſire, neglecting
the authoritie and aduiſe of parents
and frendes, conferring their principall
counſels with dronken goſſyppes,
and ſuperſtitious friers (the naturally

fitte inſtrumentes of vnchaſtitie) attemptyng
all aduentures of peryll, for
thattaynyng of their wiſhed luſt, vſyng
auriculer confeſsion (the kay of whoredome,
and treaſon) for furtheraunce of
theyr purpoſe, abuſyng the honorable
name of lawefull mariage, to cloke the
ſhame of ſtolne contractes, finallye, by
all meanes of vnhoneſt lyfe, haſtyng to
moſt vnhappye deathe. This preſident
(good Reader) ſhalbe to thee, as the ſlaues
of Lacedemon, oppreſſed with exceſſe
of drinke, deformed and altered
from likenes of men, both in mynde, and
vſe of body, were to the free borne children,
ſo ſhewed to them by their parentes,
to thintent to rayſe in them an
hatefull lothyng of ſo filthy beaſtlynes.
Hereunto if you applye it, ye ſhall deliuer
my dooing from offence, and profit
your ſelues. Though I ſaw the ſame argument
lately ſet foorth on ſtage with
more commendation, then I can looke

            The Argument.
            LOue hath inflamed twayne by ſodayn ſight.
            And both do graunt the thing that both deſyre.
            They wed in ſhrift by counſell of a frier.
            Yong Romeus clymes fayre Iuliets bower by night.
            Three monthes he doth enioy his cheefe delight.
            By Tybalts rage, prouoked vnto yre,
            He payeth death to Tybalt for his hyre.
            A baniſht man he ſcapes by ſecret flight.
            New mariage is offred to his wyfe.
            She drinkes a drinke that ſeemes to 
                  〈◊〉
                her breath.
            They bury her, that ſleping yet hath lyfe.
            Her huſband hearte the tydinges of her death.
            He drinkes his bane. And ſhe with Romeus knyfe,
            When ſhe awakes, her ſelfe (alas) ſhe ſleath.
         
      
      
         
            
            ¶ Romeus and Iuliet.
            THere is beyonde the Alps,
            a towne of auncient ſame,
            Whoſe bright renoune yet ſhineth cleare,
            Verona men it name.
            Bylt in an happy time,
            bylt on a fertile ſoyle:
            Maynteined by the heauenly fates,
            and by the towniſh toyle.
            The fruitfull hilles aboue,
            the pleaſant vales belowe,
            The ſiluer ſtreame with chanell depe,
            that through the towne doth flow:
            The ſtore of ſpringes that ſerue
            for vſe, and eke for eaſe:
            And other moe commodities
            which profite may and pleaſe.
            Eke many certaine ſignes
            of thinges betyde of olde,
            To fyll the houngry eyes of thoſe
            that curiouſly beholde:
            Doe make this towne to be
            preferde aboue the reſt
            Of Lumbard townes, or at the leaſt
            compared with the beſt.
            In which while Eſcalus,
            as prince alone dyd raigne,
            To reache rewarde vnto the good,
            to pay the lewde with payne.
            Alas (I rewe to thinke)
            an heauy happe befell:
            Which Boccace ſkant (not my rude tong)
            were able forth to tell.
            Within my trembling hande,
            my penne doth ſhake for feare:
            And on my colde amaſed head,
            vpright doth ſtand my heare.
            
               
But ſith ſhe doth commaunde,
            whoſe heſt I muſt obaye,
            In moorning verſe, a wofull chaunce
            to tell I will aſſaye.
            Helpe learned Pallas, helpe,
            ye muſes with your arte,
            Helpe all ye damned feendes to tell,
            of ioyes retournd to ſmart.
            Helpe eke ye ſiſters three,
            my ſkilleſſe penne tindyte:
            For you it cauſd which I (alas)
            vnable am to wryte.
            There were two auncient ſtockes,
            which Fortune high dyd place
            Aboue the reſt, indewd with welth,
            and nobler of their race.
            Loued of the common ſort,
            loued of the Prince alike:
            And like vnhappy were they both,
            when Fortune liſt to ſtrike.
            Whoſe prayſe with equall blaſt,
            fame in her trumpet blew:
            The one was cliped Capelet,
            and thother Montagew.
            A wonted vſe it is,
            that men of likely ſorte
            (I wot not by what furye forſd)
            enuye eche others porte.
            So theſe, whoſe egall ſtate
            bred enuye pale of hew,
            And then of grudging enuyes roote,
            blacke hate and rancor grewe.
            As of a little ſparke,
            oft ryſeth mighty fyre,
            So of a kyndled ſparke of grudge,
            in flames flaſhe out theyr yre.
            
               
And then theyr deadly foode,
            firſt hatchd of trifling ſtryfe:
            Did bathe in bloud of ſmarting woundes,
            it reued breth and lyfe.
            No legend lye I tell,
            ſcarce yet theyr eyes be drye:
            That did behold the griſly ſight,
            with wet and weping eye.
            But when the prudent prince,
            who there the ſcepter helde
            So great a new diſorder in
            his common weale behelde:
            By ientyl meane he ſought,
            their choler to aſſwage:
            And by perſwaſion to appeaſe,
            their blameful furious rage.
            But both his woords and tyme,
            the prince hath ſpent in vayne:
            So rooted was the inward hate,
            he loſt his buyſy payne.
            When frendly ſage aduiſe,
            ne ientyll woords auayle:
            By thondring threats, and princely powre
            their courage gan he qua
                  •
               le.
            In hope that when he had
            the waſting flame ſuppreſt,
            In time he ſhould quyte quench the ſparks
            that boornd within their breſt.
            Now whilſt theſe kyndreds do
            remayne in this eſtate,
            And eche with outward frendly ſhew
            dooth hyde his inward hate:
            One Romeus, who was
            of race a Montague,
            Vpon whoſe tender chyn, as yet,
            no manlyke beard there grewe.
            
               
Whoſe beauty and whoſe ſhape
            ſo farre the reſt did ſtayne:
            That from the cheefe of Veron youth
            he greateſt fame dyd gayne.
            Hath founde a mayte ſo fayre
            (he found ſo foule his happe)
            Whoſe beauty, ſhape, and comely grace,
            did ſo his heart entrappe,
            That from his owne affayres,
            his thought ſhe did remoue:
            Onely he ſought to honor her,
            to ſerue her, and to loue.
            To her he writeth oft,
            oft meſſengers are ſent:
            At length (in hope of better ſpede)
            himſelfe the louer went:
            Preſent to pleade for grace,
            which abſent was not founde:
            And to diſcouer to her eye
            his new receaued wounde.
            But ſhe that from her youth
            was foſtred euermore
            With vertues foode, and taught in ſchole
            of wiſdomes ſkilfull lore:
            By aunſwere did cutte of
            thaffections of his loue,
            That he no more occaſion had
            ſo vayne a ſute to moue.
            So ſterne ſhe was of chere,
            (for all the payne he tooke)
            That in reward of toyle, ſhe would
            not geue a frendly looke.
            And yet how much ſhe did
            with conſtant mind retyre:
            So much the more his feruent minde
            was prickt fourth by deſyre.
            
               
But when he many monthes,
            hopeleſſe of his recure,
            Had ſerued her, who forced not
            what paynes he did endure:
            At length he thought to leaue
            Verona, and to proue,
            If chaunge of place might chaunge awaye
            his ill beſtowed loue.
            And ſpeaking to himſelfe,
            thus gan he make his mone:
            What booteth me to loue and ſerue
            a fell vnthankfull one,
            Sith that my humble 
                  •
               ute
            and labour ſo wede in vayne,
            Can reape none other fruite at all
            but ſcorne and proude diſdayne:
            What way ſhe ſeekes to goe,
            the ſame I ſeeke to runne:
            But ſhe the path wherin I treade,
            with ſpedy flight doth ſhunne.
            I can not liue, except
            that nere to her I be:
            She is ay beſt content when ſhe
            is fartheſt of from me.
            Wherfore henceforth I will
            farre from her take my flight:
            Perhaps mine eye once baniſhed
            by abſence from her ſight:
            This fyre of myne, that by
            her pleaſant eyne is fed:
            Shall little and little weare away,
            and quite at laſt be ded.
            But whileſt he did decree
            this purpoſe ſtill to kepe:
            A contrary repugnant thought
            ſanke in his breſt ſo depe:
            
               
That doutefull is he now,
            which of the twayne is beſt:
            In ſighs, in teares, in plainte, in care,
            in ſorow and vnreſt.
            He moues the daye, he wakes
            the long and wery night,
            So deepe hath loue with pearcing hand,
            ygraud her bewty bright.
            Within his breſt, and hath
            ſo maſtred quite his hart:
            That he of force muſt yeld as thrall,
            no way is left to ſtart.
            He can not ſtaye his ſteppe,
            but forth ſtill muſt he ronne,
            He languiſheth and melts awaye,
            as ſnow againſt the ſonne.
            His kyndred and alyes,
            do wonder what he ayles,
            And eche of them in frendly wiſe,
            his heauy hap bewayles.
            But one emong the reſt,
            the truſtieſt of his feeres.
            Farre more then he with counſel fild,
            and ryper of his yeeres.
            Gan ſharply him rebuke,
            ſuche loue to him he bare:
            That he was felow of his ſmart,
            and partner of his care.
            What meanſt thou Romeus
            (quoth he) what doting rage
            Dooth make thee thus conſume away,
            the beſt parte of thine age,
            In ſeking her that ſcornes,
            and hydes her from thy ſight:
            Not forſing all thy great expence,
            ne yet thy honor bright.
            
               
Thy teares, thy wretched lyfe,
            ne thine vnſpotted truth:
            Which are of force (I weene) to moue
            the hardeſt hart to ruthe.
            Now for our frendſhips ſake,
            and for thy health I pray:
            That thou hencefoorth become thyne owne,
            O geue no more away.
            Vnto a thankeles wight,
            thy precious free eſtate:
            In that thou loueſt ſuch a one,
            thou ſeemſt thy ſelfe to hate.
            For ſhe doth loue els where,
            (and then thy time is lorne)
            Or els (what booteth thee to ſue)
            loues court ſhe hath forſworne.
            Both yong thou art of yeres,
            and high in Fortunes grace:
            What man is better ſhapd then thou?
            who hath a ſwetter face?
            By painfull ſtudies meane,
            great learning haſt thou wonne:
            Thy parentes haue none other heyre,
            thou art theyr onely ſonne.
            What greater griefe (trowſt thou?)
            what wofull dedly ſmart
            Should ſo be able to diſtraine
            thy ſeely fathers hart?
            As in his age to ſee
            thee plonged deepe in vyce:
            When greateſt hope he hath to heare
            thy vertues fame ariſe.
            What ſhall thy kinſmen thinke,
            thou cauſe of all theyr ruthe?
            Thy dedly foes do laugh to ſkorne
            thy yll employed youth.
            
               
Wherfore my counſell is,
            that thou henceforth beginne
            To knowe and flye the errour which
            to long thou liuedſt in.
            Remoue the veale of loue,
            that keepes thine eyes ſo blynde:
            That thou ne canſt the ready path
            of thy forefathers fynde.
            But if vnto thy will
            ſo much in thrall thou art:
            Yet in ſome other place beſtowe
            thy witles wandring hart.
            Chooſe out ſome worthy dame,
            her honor thou and ſerue,
            Who will geue eare to thy complaint
            and pitty ere thou ſterue.
            But ſow no more thy paynes
            in ſuch a barrayne ſoyle:
            As yeldes in harueſt time no crop
            in recompence of toyle.
            Ere long the towniſhe dames
            together will reſort:
            Some one of bewty, fauour, ſhape,
            and of ſo louely porte:
            With ſo faſt fixed eye,
            perhaps thou mayſt beholde:
            That thou ſhalt quite forget thy loue,
            and paſſions paſt of olde.
            The yong mans lyſtning eare
            receiude the holeſome ſounde,
            And reaſons truth yplanted ſo,
            within his head had grounde:
            That now with healthy coole
            ytempred is the heate:
            And piecemeale weares away the greefe
            that erſt his heart dyd freate.
            
               
To his approued frend,
            a ſolemne othe he plight:
            At euery feaſt ykept by day,
            and banquet made by night:
            At pardons in the churche,
            at games in open ſtreate:
            And euery where he would reſort
            where Ladies wont to meete.
            Eke ſhould his ſauage heart
            lyke all indifferently:
            For he would view and iudge them all
            with vnallured eye.
            How happy had he been.
            had he not been forſworne:
            But twyſe as happy had he been
            had he been neuer borne.
            For ere the Moone could thryſe
            her waſted hornes renew,
            Falſe Fortune caſt for him poore wretch,
            a myſchiefe newe to brewe.
            The wery winter nightes
            reſtore the Chriſtmas games:
            And now the ſeaſon doth inuite
            to banquet towniſh dames.
            And fyrſt in Capels houſe,
            the chiefe of all the kyn:
            Sparth for no coſt, the wonted vſe
            of banquets to begyn.
            No Lady fayre or fowle,
            was in Verona towne:
            No knight or gentleman
            of high or lowe renowne:
            But Capilet himſelfe
            hath byd vnto his feaſt:
            Or by his name in paper ſent,
            appoynted as a geaſt.
            
               
Yong damſels thether flocke,
            of bachelers a rowte:
            Not ſo much for the banquets ſake,
            as bewties to ſearche out.
            But not a Montagew
            would enter at his gate:
            For as you heard, the Capilets,
            and they were at debate.
            Saue Romeus, and he.
            in maſke with hidden face:
            The ſupper done, with other fiue
            dyd preaſe into the place.
            When they had maſkd a whyle,
            with dames in courtly wiſe:
            All dyd vnmaſke, the reſt dyd ſhew
            them to theyr ladies eyes.
            But baſhfull Romeus,
            with ſhamefaſt face forſooke
            The open preaſe, and him withdrew
            into the chambers nooke.
            But brighter then the ſunne,
            the waxen torches ſhone:
            That mauger what he could, he was
            eſpyd of euery one.
            But of the women cheefe,
            theyr gaſing eyes that threwe
            To woonder at his ſightly ſhape
            and bewties ſpotles hewe.
            With which the heauens him had
            and nature ſo bedect:
            That Ladies thought the fayreſt dames
            were fowle in his reſpect.
            And in theyr head beſide,
            an other woonder roſe,
            How he durſt put himſelfe in throng
            among ſo many foes.
            
               
Of courage ſtoute they thought
            his cumming to procede:
            And women loue an hardy hart
            as I in ſtories rede.
            The Capilets diſdayne
            the preſence of theyr foe:
            Yet they ſuppreſſe theyr 
                  ••
               yrred yre,
            the cauſe I do not knowe.
            Perhaps toffend theyr geſtes
            the courteous knights are loth,
            Perhaps they ſtay from ſharpe reuenge,
            dreadyng the Princes wroth.
            Perhaps for that they ſhamd
            to exerciſe theyr rage:
            Within their houſe, gainſt one alone
            and him of tender age.
            They vſe no taunting talke,
            ne harme him by theyr deede:
            They neyther ſay, what makſt thou here,
            ne yet they ſay God ſpeede.
            So that he freely might
            the Ladies view at eaſe:
            And they alſo behelding him,
            their chaunge of fanſies pleaſe.
            Which nature had him taught
            to doe with ſuch a grace,
            That there was none but ioyed at
            his being there in place.
            With vpright beame he wayd
            the bewty of eche dame,
            And iudgd who beſt, and who next her,
            was wrought in natures frame.
            At length he ſaw a mayd,
            right fayre of perfect ſhape:
            Which Theſeus, or Paris would
            haue choſen to their rape.
            
               
Whom erſt he neuer ſawe,
            of all ſhe pleaſde him moſt:
            Within himſelfe he ſaid to her,
            thou iuſtly mayſt thee boſte.
            Of perfit ſhapes renoune,
            and Beauties ſounding prayſe:
            Whoſe like ne hath, ne ſhalbe ſeene,
            ne liueth in our dayes.
            And whileſt he fixd on her
            his part all perced eye,
            His former loue, for which of 
                  •
               ate
            he ready was to dye.
            Is nowe as quite forgotte,
            as it had neuer been:
            The prouerbe ſaith vnminded oft
            are they that are vnſeene.
            And as out of a planke
            a nayle a nayle doth driue:
            So nouell loue out of the minde
            the auncient loued doth riue.
            This ſodain kindled fyre
            in time is wox ſo great:
            That onely death, and both theyr blouds
            might quench the fiery heate.
            When Romeus ſaw himſelfe
            in this new tempeſt toſt:
            Where both was hope of pleaſant port,
            and daunger to be loſt:
            He doubtefull, ſkaſely knew
            what countenance to keepe
            In Lethies floud his wonted flames
            were quenchd and drenched deepe.
            Yea he forgets himſelfe,
            ne is the wretch ſo bolde
            To aſke her name, that without force
            hath him in bondage folde.
            
               
Ne how tunlooſe his bondes
            doth the poore foole deuiſe,
            But onely ſeeketh by her ſight
            to feede his houngry eyes.
            Through them he ſwalloweth downe
            loues ſweete empoyſonde baite,
            How 
                  •
               encly are the ware

            by thoſe that lye in wayte?
            
               
                  〈◊〉
                is the poyſon ſpred
            throughout his bones and vaines:
            That in a while (alas the while)
            it haſteth deadly paines.
            Whilſt Iuliet (for ſo
            this gentle damſell hight)
            From ſyde to ſyde on euery one
            dyd caſt about her ſight:
            At laſt her flo
                  •
               ing eyes
            were ancored faſt on him,
            Who for her ſake dyd baniſhe health
            and fredome from eche limme.
            He in her ſight did ſeeme
            to paſſe the reſt as farre
            As Phoebus ſhining beames do paſſe
            the brightnes of a ſtarre.
            In wayte laye warlike loue
            with golden bowe and ſhaft,
            And to his eare with ſteady hand
            the bowſtring vp he raft.
            Till now ſhe had eſcapde
            his ſharpe inflaming darte:
            Till now he liſted not aſſaulte
            her yong and tender hart.
            His whetted arrow looſde,
            ſo touchd her to the quicke:
            That through the eye it ſtrake the hart,
            and there the hedde did ſticke.
            
               
It booted not to ſtriue,
            for why, ſhe wanted ſtrength:
            The weaker aye vnto the ſtrong
            of force muſt yeld at length.
            The pomps now of the feaſt
            her heart gyns to deſpyſe:
            And onely ioyeth when her eyen
            meete with her louers eyes.
            When theyr new ſmitten heartes
            had fed on louing gleames:
            Whilſt paſſing too and fro▪ theyr eyes
            ymingled were theyr beames▪
            
            Eche of theſe louers gan
            by others lookes to knowe:
            That frendſhip in their breſt had roote,
            and both would haue it grow.
            When thus in both theyr harts
            had Cupide made his breache:
            And eche of them had ſought the meane
            to end the warre by ſpeache.
            Dame Fortune did aſſent
            theyr purpoſe to aduaunce:
            With torche in hand a comly knight
            did fetch her foorth to daunce.
            She quit her ſelfe ſo well,
            and with ſo trim a grace:
            That ſhe the cheefe prayſe wan that night
            from all Verona race.
            The whilſt our Romeus,
            a place had warely wonne:
            Nye to the ſeate where ſhe muſt ſit,
            the daunce once beyng donne.
            Fayre Iuliet tourned to,
            her chayre with pleaſant cheere:
            And glad ſhe was her Romeus
            approched was ſo neere.
            
               
At thone ſide of her chayre▪
            
            her louer Romeo:
            And on the other ſide there ſat
            one cald Mercutio.
            A courtier that eche where
            was highly had in pryce:
            For he was coorteous of his ſpeche,
            and pleaſant of deuiſe.
            Euen as a Lyon would
            emong the lambes be bolde:
            Such was emong the baſhfull maydes,
            Mercutio to beholde.
            With frendly gripe he ceaſd
            fayre Iuliets ſnowith hand:
            A gyft he had that nature gaue
            him in his ſwathing band.
            That froſen mountayne yſe
            was neuer halfe ſo cold
            As were his handes, though nere ſo neer
            the fire he dyd them holde.
            As ſoone as had the knight
            the vyrgins right hand raught:
            Within his trembling hand her left
            hath louing Romeus caught.
            For he wiſt well himſelfe
            for her abode moſt payne:
            And well he wiſt ſhe loued him beſt,
            vnles ſhe liſt to fayne.
            Then ſhe with tender hand
            his tender palme hath preſt:
            What ioy trow you was graffed ſo
            in Romeus clouen breſt?
            The ſoodain ſweete delight
            hath ſtopped quite his tong:
            Ne can he claime of her his right,
            ne craue redreſſe of wrong.
            
               
But ſhe eſpyd ſtraight waye
            by chaunging o
                  •
                his hewe
            From pale to red, from red to pale,
            and ſo from pale anewe:
            That vehment loue was cauſe,
            why ſo his tong dyd ſtay:
            And ſo much more ſhe longde to heare
            what loue could teache him ſaye.
            When ſhe had longed long,
            and he long held his peace,
            And her deſire of hearing him,
            by ſylence dyd encreaſe.
            At laſt with trembling voyce
            and ſhamefaſt chere, the mayde
            Vnto her Romeus tournde her ſelfe,
            and thus to him ſhe ſayde.
            O bleſſed be the time
            of thy arriuall here:
            But ere ſhe could ſpeake forth the reſt,
            to her loue drewe ſo nere:
            And ſo within her mouth,
            her tong he glewed faſt,
            That no one woord could ſcape her more,
            then what already paſt.
            In great contented eaſe
            the yong man ſtraight is rapt,
            What chaunce (ꝙ he) vnware to me
            O lady myne is hapt?
            That geues you worthy cauſe,
            my cumming here to bliſſe:
            Fayre Iuliet was come agayne
            vnto her ſelfe by this.
            Fyrſt ruthfully ſhe lookd,
            then ſayd with ſmylyng cheere:
            Meruayle no whit my heartes delight,
            my onely knight and fere.
            
               
Mercutious yſy hande
            had all to froſen myne
            And of thy goodnes thou agayne
            haſt warmed it with thine.
            Whereto with ſtayed brow,
            gau Romeus to replye
            If ſo the gods haue graunted me,
            ſuche fauour from the ſkye,
            That by my being here,
            ſome ſeruice I haue donne
            That pleaſeth you I am as glad,
            as I a realme had wonne,
            O wel beſtowed tyme.
            that hath the happy hyre,
            Which I woulde wyſh if I might haue,
            my wiſhed harts deſire.
            For I of God woulde craue,
            as pryſe of paynes forpaſt.
            To ſerue, obey and honor you,
            ſo long as lyfe ſhall laſt.
            As proofe ſhall teache you playne,
            if that you like to trye
            His faltles truth, that nill for ought,
            vnto his lady lye.
            But if my tooched hand,
            haue warmed yours ſome dele
            Aſſure your ſelf the heat is colde,
            which in your hand you fele.
            Compard to ſuche quick ſparks
            and glowing furious gleade
            As from your bewties pleaſaunt 
                  •
               yne,
            loue cauſed to proceade.
            Which haue ſo ſet on fyre,
            eche feling parte of myne.
            That lo, my mynde doeth melt awaye:
            my vtwerd parts doe pyne.
            
               
And but you helpe all whole,
            to aſhes ſhall I toorne:
            Wherfore (alas) haue ruth on him,
            whom you do force to boorne.
            Euen with his ended tale,
            the torches daunce had ende,
            And Iuliet of force muſt part
            from her new choſen frend.
            His hand ſhe claſped hard,
            and all her partes did ſhake:
            When lay ſureles with whiſpring voyce
            thus did ſhe aunſwer make.
            You are no more your owne
            (deare frend) then I am yours
            (My honor ſaued) preſt tobay
            your will, while life endures▪
            
            Lo here the lucky lot
            that ſild true louers finde:
            Eche takes away the others hart,
            and leaues the owne behinde.
            A happy life is loue
            if God graunt from aboue,
            That hart with hart by euen waight
            doo make exchaunge of loue.
            But Romeus gone from her,
            his heart for care is colde:
            He hath forgot to aſke her name
            that hath his hart in holde.
            With forged careles cheere,
            of one he ſeekes to knowe,
            Both how ſhe hight, and whence ſhe camme,
            that him enchaunted ſo.
            So hath he learnd her name,
            and knowth ſhe is no geaſt.
            Her father was a Capilet,
            and maſter of the feaſt.
            
               
Thus hath his foe in choyſe
            to geue him lyfe or death:
            That ſcarſely can his wofull breſt
            keepe in the liuely breath.
            Wherfore with piteous plaint
            feerce Fortune doth he blame:
            That in his ruth and wretched plight
            doth ſeeke her laughing game.
            And he reproueth loue,
            cheefe cauſe of his vnreſt:
            Who eaſe and freedome hath exilde
            out of his youthfull breſt.
            Twyſe hath he made him ſerue,
            hopeles of his rewarde:
            Of both the ylles to chooſe the leſſe,
            I weene the choyſe were harde▪
            
            Fyrſt to a ruthleſſe one
            he made him ſue for grace:
            And now with ſpurre he forceth him
            to ronne an endles race.
            Amyd theſe ſtormy ſeas
            one ancor doth him holde,
            He ſerueth not a cruell one,
            as he had done of olde.
            And therfore is content,
            and chooſeth ſtill to ſerue:
            Though hap ſhould ſweare that guerdonles
            the wretched wight ſhould ſterue.
            The lot of Tantalus
            is Romeus lyke to thine
            For want of foode amid his foode,
            the myſer ſtyll doth pine.
            As carefull was the mayde
            what way were beſt deuiſe
            To learne his name, that intertaind
            her in ſo gentle wiſe.
            
               
Of whome her hart receiued
            ſo deepe, ſo wyde a wounde,
            An auncient dame ſhe calde to her,
            and in her eare gan rounde.
            This olde dame in her youth,
            had nurſt her with her mylke,
            With ſlender nedle taught her ſow,
            and how to ſpin with ſilke,
            What twayne are thoſe (quoth ſhe)
            which preaſe vnto the doore,
            Whoſe pages in theyr hand doe beare,
            two toorches light before.
            And then as eche of them
            had of his houſhold name,
            So ſhe him namde yet once agayne
            the yong and wyly dame.
            And tell me who is he
            with vyſor in his hand
            That yender doth in maſking weede
            beſyde the window ſtand.
            His name is Romeus
            (ſayd ſhe) a Montegewe.
            Whoſe fathers pryde firſt ſtyrd the ſtrife
            which both your houſholdes rewe.
            The woord of Montegew,
            her ioyes did ouerthrow,
            And ſtraight in ſteade of happy hope,
            dyſpayre began to growe.
            What hap haue I quoth ſhe,
            to loue my fathers foe?
            What, am I wery of my wele?
            what, doe I wiſhe my woe?
            But though her grieuous paynes
            diſtraind her tender hart,
            Yet with an outward ſhewe of ioye
            ſhe cloked inward ſmart.
            
               
And of the courtlyke dames
            her leaue ſo courtly tooke,
            That none dyd geſſe the ſodain change
            by changing of her looke.
            Then at her mothers heſt
            to chamber ſhe
                  •
               her hyde
            So well ſhe faynde, mother ne nurce.
            the hidden harme deſcride.
            But when ſhe ſhould haue ſlept
            as wont ſhe was, in bed,
            Not halfe a winke of quiet ſlepe
            could harber in her hed▪
            
            For loe, an hugy heape
            of dyuers thoughtes ariſe
            That reſt haue baniſht from her hart,
            and ſlumber from her eyes.
            And now from ſide to ſide
            ſhe toſſeth and ſhe turnes,
            And now for feare ſhe ſheuereth,
            and now for loue ſhe burnes.
            And now ſhe lykes her choyſe,
            and now her choyſe ſhe blames,
            And now eche houre within her head,
            a thouſand fanſies frames
            Sometime in mynde to ſtop,
            amyd her courſe begonne
            Sometime ſhe vowes what ſo betyde,
            that tempted race to ronne.
            Thus dangers dred and loue,
            within the mayden fought,
            The fight was feerce continuyng long
            by their contrary thought.
            In tourning maſe of loue
            ſhe wandreth too and fro,
            Then ſtandeth doutfull what to doe,
            laſt ouerpreſt with woe.
            
               
How ſo her fanſies ceaſe,
            her teares dyd neuer blyn,
            With heauy cheere and wringed hands,
            thus doth her plaint begyn.
            Ah ſily foole quoth ſhe)
            ycought in ſoottill ſnare:
            Ah wretched wench bewrapt in woe,
            an caytife clad with care.
            Whence come theſe wandring thoughtes
            to thy vnconſtant breſt?
            By ſtraying thus from rayſons lore,
            that reue thy wonted reſt.
            What if his ſuttell brayne,
            to fayne haue taught his tong?
            And ſo the ſnake that lurkes in graſſe,
            thy tender hart hath ſtong?
            What if with frendly ſpeache
            the traytor lye in wayte?
            As oft the poyſond hooke is hid,
            wrapt in the pleaſant bayte?
            Oft vnder cloke of truth,
            hath falſhood ſerued her luſt:
            And toornd theyr honor into ſhame,
            that did ſo ſlightly truſt.
            What, was not Dido ſo,
            a crouned Queene: defamd?
            And eke for ſuch an heynous cryme,
            haue men not Theſeus blamd?
            A thouſand ſtories more,
            to teache me to beware:
            In Boccace, and in Ouids bookes
            too playnely written are.
            Perhaps the great reuenge
            he cannot woorke by ſtrength:
            By ſuttel ſleight (my honor ſtaynde)
            he hopes to worke at length.
            
               
So ſhall I ſeeke to finde
            my fathers foe his game:
            So I befylde, report ſhall take
            her trompe of blacke defame.
            Whence ſhe with puffed cheeke
            ſhall blowe a blaſt ſo ſhrill
            Of my diſprayſe, that with the noyſe
            Verona ſhall ſhe ſtil.
            Then I a laughing ſtocke
            through all the towne becomme:
            Shall hide my ſelfe, but not my ſhame,
            within an hollowe toombe.
            Straight vnderneth her foote,
            ſhe treadeth in the duſt
            Her troubleſom thought as wholy vaine,
            ybred of fond diſtruſt.
            No no by God aboue,
            I wot it well quoth ſhee,
            Although I raſhely ſpake before,
            in no wiſe can it bee.
            That where ſuch perfet ſhape,
            with pleaſant bewty reſtes:
            There crooked craft and trayſon blacke,
            ſhould be appoynted geſtes.
            Sage writers ſay, the thoughts
            are dwelling in the eyne:
            Then ſure I am as Cupid raignes
            that Romeus is myne.
            The tong the meſſenger,
            eke call they of the mynd:
            So that I ſee he loueth me,
            ſhall I then be vnkynd?
            His faces roſy hew,
            I ſaw full oft to ſeeke:
            And ſtraight againe it flaſhed foorth,
            and ſpred in eyther cheeke.

               yne,
            that through me quite did perce

            What ment his foltring tunge,
            in telling of his tale:
            The trembling of his ioynts and eke
            his cooller waxen pale?
            And whilſt I take with him,
            hym ſelf he hath exylde,
            Out of him ſelf (as ſeemed me)
            ne was I ſure begylde.
            Thoſe arguments of loue,

            Theſe doo ſuffiſe, and ſtedfaſt I

            So that he mynde to make of me

            For ſo perchaunce this new
            aliance may procure
            Vnto our houſes ſuche a peace
            as euer ſhall endure
            Oh how we can perſwade,

The mayde had ſcarſely yet
            ended the wery warre,
            Kept in her heart by ſtriuing thoughtes
            when euery ſhining ſtarre
            Had payd his borowed light,
            and Phebus ſpred in ſkies
            His golden rayes, which ſeemd to ſay:
            now time it is to riſe.
            And Romeus had by this
            forſaken his wery bed:
            Where reſtles he a thouſand thoughts
            had forged in his hed.
            And while with lingring ſtep
            by Iuliets houſe he paſt:
            And vpward to her windowes high
            his gredy eyes did caſt:
            His loue that looked for him,
            there gan he ſtraight eſpie,
            With pleaſant cheere eche greeted is,
            ſhe followeth with her eye
            His parting ſteppes, and he
            oft looketh backe againe:
            But not ſo oft as he deſyres,
            warely he doth refraine.
            What life were lyke to loue,
            if dred of ieopardy,
            Yſowred not the ſweete, if loue
            were free from ieloſy.
            But ſhe more ſure within,
            vnſeene of any wight,
            When ſo he comes, lookes after him,
            till he be out of ſight.
            In often paſſing ſo,
            his buſy eyes he threw,
            That euery pane and tooting hole
            the wily louer knew.
            
               
In happy houre he doth
            a garden plot eſpye:
            From which except he warely walke,
            men may his loue deſcrye.
            For lo, it fronted full,
            vpon her leaning place:
            Where ſhe is woont to ſhew her heart
            by cheerefull frendly face.
            And leſt the arbors might
            theyr ſecret loue bewraye:
            He doth keepe backe his forward foote
            from paſſing there by daye.
            But when on earth the night
            her mantel blacke hath ſpred:
            Well armd he walketh foorth alone,
            ne dreadfull foes doth dred.
            Whom maketh loue not bold,
            naye whom makes he not blynde?
            He reueth daungers dread oft times
            out of the loues minde.
            By night he paſſeth here,
            a weeke or two in vayne:
            And for the miſſing of his marke.
            his griefe hath him nye ſlaine.
            And Iuliet that now
            both lacke her hearts releefe:
            Her Romeus pleaſant eyen (I meene)
            is almoſt dead for greefe.
            Eche day ſhe chaungeth howres,
            (for louers keepe an howre)
            When they are ſure to ſee theyr loue
            in paſſing by their howre.
            Impacient of her woe,
            ſhe hapt to leane one night
            Within her window, and anon
            the Moone did ſhine ſo bright.
            
               
That ſhe eſpyde her loue,
            her hart reuiued, ſprang,
            And now for ioy ſhe clappes her handes,
            which erſt for woe ſhe wrang.
            Eke Romeus when he ſawe
            his long deſired ſight:
            His moorning cloke of mone caſt of,
            hath clad him with delight.
            Yet dare I ſay, of both,
            that ſhe reioyced more:
            His care was great, hers twiſe as great,
            was all the tyme before:
            For whilſt ſhe knew not why
            he dyd himſelfe abſent:
            Ay douting both his health and lyfe,
            his death ſhe dyd lament.
            For loue is fearefull oft,
            where is no cauſe of feare:
            And what loue feares, that loue laments,
            as though it chaunced weare.
            Of greater cauſe alway
            is greater woorke ybred:
            While he nought douteth of her helth,
            ſhe dreads leſt he be ded.
            When onely abſence is
            the cauſe of Romeus ſmart:
            By happy hope of ſight agayne
            he feedes his faynting hart.
            What woonder then if he
            were wrapt in leſſe annoye?
            What maruell if by ſodain ſight
            ſhe fed of greater ioye?
            His ſmaller greefe or ioy,
            no ſmaller loue doo proue:
            He for ſhe paſſed him in both,
            did ſhe him paſſe in loue.
            
               
But eche of them alike
            dyd burne in equall flame:
            The welbelouing knight, and eke
            the welbeloued dame.
            How whilſt with bitter teares
            her eyes as fountaynes ronne:
            With whiſpering voyce ybroke with ſobs,
            thus is her tale begonne.
            Oh Romeus (of your lyfe)
            too lauas ſure yon are:
            That in this place, and at thys tyme
            to haſard it you dare.
            What if your dedly foes
            my kynſmen, ſaw you here?
            Lyke Lyons wylde, your tender partes
            aſonder would they teare.
            In ruth and in diſdayne,
            I weary of my lyfe:
            With cruell hand my moorning hart
            would perce with bloudy knyfe.
            For you myne owne once dead,
            what ioy ſhould I haue heare?
            And eke my honor ſtaynde which I
            then lyfe doe holde more deare.
            Fayre lady myne dame Iuliet
            my lyfe (quod he)
            Euen from my byrth committed was
            to fatall ſiſters three.
            They may in ſpyte of foes,
            draw foorth my liuely threed:
            And they alſo, who ſo ſayth nay,
            a ſonder may it ſhreed.
            But who to reaue my lyfe,
            his rage and force would bende:
            Perhaps ſhould trye vnto his payne
            how I it could defende.
            
               
Ne yet I loue it ſo,
            but alwayes for your ſake,
            A ſacrifice to death I would
            my wounded corps betake.
            If my miſhappe were ſuch,
            that here before your ſight,
            I ſhould reſtore agayne to death,
            of lyfe my borowde light:
            This one thing and no more
            my parting ſprite would rewe:
            That part he ſhould, before that you
            by certaine triall knew
            The loue I owe to you,
            the thrall I languiſh in:
            And how I dread to looſe the gayne
            which I doe hope to win.
            And how I wiſhe for lyfe,
            not for my propre eaſe:
            But that in it, you might I loue,
            you honor, ſerue and pleaſe.
            Tyll dedly pangs the ſprite
            out of the corps ſhall ſend:
            And therupon he ſware an othe,
            and ſo his tale had ende.
            Now loue and pitty boyle,
            in Iuliets ruthfull breſt,
            In windowe on her leaning arme,
            her weary hed doth reſt.
            Her boſome bathd in teares,
            to witnes inward payne:
            With dreary chere to Romeus,
            thus aunſwerd ſhe agayne.
            Ah my deere Romeus,
            keepe in theſe woordes (quod ſhe)
            For lo, the thought of ſuch miſchaunce,
            already maketh me
            
               
For pitty and for dred,
            welnigh to yelde vp breath:
            In euen ballance payſed are
            my life and eke my death.
            For ſo my hart is knitte,
            yea, made one ſelfe with yours:
            That ſure there is no greefe ſo ſmall,
            by which your mynde endures.
            But as you ſuffer payne,
            ſo I doe beare in part:
            (Although it leſſens not your greefe)
            the halfe of all your ſmart.
            But theſe thinges ouerpaſt,
            if of your health and myne
            You haue reſpect, or pitty ought
            my teary weping eyen:
            In few vnfained woords,
            your hidden mynd vnfolde,
            That as I ſee your pleaſant face,
            your heart I may beholde.
            For if you doe intende
            my honor to defile:
            In error ſhall you wander ſtill
            as you haue done this whyle,
            But if your thought be chaſte,
            and haue on vertue ground,
            If wedlocke be the ende and marke
            which your deſire hath found:
            Obedience ſet aſide,
            vnto my parentes dewe:
            The quarell eke that long agoe
            betwene our houſholdes grewe:
            Both me and myne I will
            all whole to you betake:
            And following you where ſo you goe,
            my fathers houſe forſake.
            
               
But if by wanton loue,
            and by vnlawfull ſute.
            You thinke in ripeſt yeres to plucke
            my maydenhods dainty frute:
            You are begylde, and now
            your Iuliet you be ſeekes
            To ceaſe your ſute, and ſuffer her
            to liue emong her likes.
            Then Romeus, whoſe thought
            was free from fowle deſyre:
            And to the top of vertues haight,
            did worthely aſpyre:
            Was fild with greater ioy
            then can my pen expreſſe:
            Or till they haue enioyd the like
            the hearers hart can geſſe.
            And then with ioyned hands
            heaud vp into the ſkies:
            He thankes the Gods, and from the heauens
            for vengeance downe he cries.
            If he haue other thought,
            but as his lady ſpake:
            And then his looke he toornd to her,
            and thus did aunſwer make.
            Since Lady that you like
            to honor me ſo much,
            As to accept me for your ſpouſe,
            I yeld my ſelfe for ſuch.
            In true witnes wherof,
            becauſe I muſt depart,
            Till that my deede do proue my woord,
            I leaue in pawne my hart.
            To morow eke betimes.
            before the ſunne ariſe:
            To fryer Lawrence will I wende,
            to learne his ſage aduiſe.
            
               
He is my goſtly ſyre,
            and oft he hath me taught
            What I ſhould doe in things of wayght,
            when I his ayde haue ſought.
            And at this ſelfe ſame houre,
            I plyte you here my fayth:
            I wil be here (if you thinke good)
            to tell you what he ſayth.
            She was contented well,
            els fauour found he none,
            That night at lady Iuliets hand,
            ſaue pleaſant woordes alone.
            This barefoote fryer gyrt,
            with cord his grayiſh weede,
            For he of Frauncis order was,
            a fryer as I reede,
            Not as the moſt was he,
            a groſſe vnlearned foole:
            But doctor of diuinitie
            proceded he in ſchoole.
            The ſecretes eke he knew,
            in natures woorkes that loorke:
            By magiks arte moſt men ſuppoſd
            that he could wonders woorke.
            Ne doth it ill beſeeme
            deuines thoſe ſkils to know:
            If on no harmefull deede they do
            ſuch ſkilfulnes beſtow.
            For iuſtly of no arte
            can men condemne the vſe:
            But right and reaſons lore crye out
            agaynſt the lewd abuſe.
            The bounty of the fryer
            and wiſdom hath ſo wonne
            The townes folks herts, that welnigh all
            to fryer Lawrence tonne.
            
               
To ſhriue them ſelfe the olde,
            the yong, the great and ſmall:
            Of all he is beloued well,
            and honord much of all.
            And for he did the reſt
            in wiſdome farre exceede:
            The prince by him (his counſell craude)
            was holpe at time of neede.
            Betwixt the Capilets
            and him great frendſhip grew:
            A ſecret and aſſured frend
            vnto the Montegue.
            Loued of this yong man more
            then any other geſt,
            The frier eke of Verone youth,
            aye liked Romeus beſt.
            For whom he euer hath
            in time of his diſtres:
            (As erſt you heard) by ſkilfull lore,
            found out his harmes redreſſe.
            To him is Romeus gonne,
            ne ſtayth he till the morowe:
            To him he paynteth all his caſe,
            his paſſed ioy and ſorow.
            How he hath her eſpyde
            with other dames in daunce,
            And how that firſt to talke with her,
            himſelfe he did aduaunce.
            Their talke and change of lookes
            he gan to him declare:
            And how ſo faſt by fayth and troth
            they both ycoupled are.
            That neither hope of lyfe,
            nor dreed of cruel death,
            Shall make him falſe his fayth to her
            while lyfe ſhall lend him breath.
            
               
And then with weping eyes
            he prayes his goſtly ſyre
            To further and accompliſh all
            theyr honeſt hartes deſire.
            A thouſand doutes and moe
            in thold mans hed aroſe:
            A thouſand daungers like to come,
            the olde man doth diſcloſe.
            And from the ſpouſall rites
            he readeth him refrayne:
            Perhaps he ſhalbe bet aduiſde
            within a weeke or twayne.
            Aduiſe is baniſhd quite
            from thoſe that followe loue,
            Except aduiſe to what they like
            theyr bending mynde do moue.
            As well the father might
            haue counſeld him to ſtay
            That from a mountaines top thrown downe,
            is falling halfe the way:
            As warne his frend to ſtop,
            amyd his race begonne,
            Whom Cupid with his ſmarting whip
            enforceth foorth to ronne.
            Part wonne by earneſt ſute,
            the fryer doth graunt at laſt:
            And part, becauſe he thinkes the ſtormes
            ſo lately ouerpaſt,
            Of both the houſholdes wrath:
            this mariage might apeaſe,
            So that they ſhould not rage agayne,
            but quite for euer ceaſe.
            The reſpite of a day,
            he aſketh to deuyſe:
            What way were beſt vnknowne to ende
            ſo great an enterpriſe.
            
               
The wounded man that now
            doth dedly paines endure:
            Scarce pacient tarieth whilſt his leeche
            doth make the ſalue to cure.
            So Romeus hardly graunts
            a ſhort day and a night,
            Yet nedes he muſt, els muſt he want
            his onely hearts delight.
            You ſee that Romeus
            no time or payne doth ſpare:
            Thinke that the whilſt fayre Iuliet
            is not deuoyde of care.
            Yong Romeus powreth foorth
            his hap and his miſhap,
            Into the friers breſt, but where
            ſhall Iuliet vnwrap
            The ſecretes of her hart?
            to whom ſhall ſhe vnfolde,
            Her hidden burning loue, and eke
            her thought and cares ſo colde.
            The nurce of whom I ſpake
            within her chaumber laye:
            Vpon the mayde ſhe wayteth ſtill,
            to her ſhe doth bewray
            Her new receiued wound,
            and then her ayde doth craue:
            In her ſhe ſaith it lyes to ſpill,
            in her her life to ſaue.
            Not eaſely ſhe made
            the froward nurce to bowe:
            But wonne at length, with promeſt hyre
            ſhe made a ſolemne vowe.
            To do what ſhe commaundes,
            as handmayd of her heſt:
            Her miſtres ſecrets hide ſhe will,
            within her couert breſt.
            
               
To Romeus ſhe goes
            of him ſhe doth deſyre,
            To know the meane of mariage
            by councell of the fryre.
            On Saterday quod he,
            if Iuliet come to ſhrift,
            She ſhalbe ſhriued and maried,
            how lyke you noorſe this driſt?
            Now by my truth (quod ſhe)
            gods bleſſing haue your hart:
            For yet in all my life I haue
            not heard of ſuch a part.
            Lord how you yong men can
            ſuch crafty wiles deuiſe,
            If that you loue the daughter well
            to bleare the mothers eyes.
            An eaſy thing it is,
            with cloke of holines,
            To mocke the ſely mother that
            ſuſpecteth nothing leſſe
            But that it pleaſed you
            to tell me of the caſe.
            For all my many yeres perhaps,
            I ſhould haue found it ſcarſe.
            Now for the reſt let me
            and Iuliet alone:
            To get her leaue, ſome feate excuſe
            I will deuiſe anone.
            For that her golden lockes
            by ſloth haue been vnkempt:
            Or for vnwares ſome wanton dreame
            the youthfull damſell drempt,
            Or for in thoughts of loue
            her ydel time ſhe ſpent:
            Or otherwiſe within her hart
            deſerued to be ſhent.
            
               
I know her mother will
            in no caſe ſay her nay:
            I warrant you ſhe ſhall not fayle
            to come on Saterday.
            And then ſhe ſweares to him,
            the mother loues her well:
            And how ſhe gaue her ſucke in youth
            ſhe leaueth not to tell.
            A prety babe (quod ſhe)
            it was when it was yong:
            Lord how it could full pretely
            haue prated with it tong.
            A thouſand times and more
            I ſaid her on my lappe,
            And clapt her on the buttocke ſoft
            and kiſt where I did clappe.
            And gladder then was I
            of ſuch a kiſſe forſooth:
            Then I had been to haue a kiſſe
            of ſome olde lechers mouth.
            And thus of Iuliets youth
            began this prating noorſe,
            And of her preſent ſtate to make
            a tedious long diſcoorſe.
            For though he pleaſure tooke
            in hearing of his loue:
            The meſſage aunſwer ſeemed him
            to be of more behoue.
            But when theſe Beldams ſit
            at eaſe vpon theyr tayle:
            The day and eke the candle light
            before theyr talke ſhall fayle.
            And part they ſay is true,
            and part they do deuiſe:
            Yet boldly do they that of both
            when no man checkes theyr lyes.
            
               
Then he .vi. crownes of gold
            out of his pocket drew:
            And gaue them her, a ſlight reward
            (quod he) and ſo adiew.
            In ſeuen yeres twiſe tolde
            ſhe had not bowd ſo lowe,
            Her crooked knees, as now they bowe,
            ſhe ſweares ſhe will beſtowe.
            Her crafty wit, her time,
            and all her buſy payne,
            To helpe him to his hoped bliſſe,
            and cowring downe agayne:
            She takes her leaue, and home
            ſhe hyes with ſpedy pace:
            The chaumber doore ſhe ſhuts, and then
            ſhe ſaith with ſmyling face.
            Good newes for thee my gyrle,
            good tidinges I thee bring:
            Leaue of thy woonted ſong of care
            and now of pleaſure ſing.
            For thou mayſt hold thy ſelfe
            the happieſt vnder ſonne:
            That in ſo little while, ſo well
            ſo worthy a knight haſt wonne.
            The beſt yſhapde is he,
            and hath the fayreſt face,
            Of all this towne, and there is none
            hath halfe ſo good a grace.
            So gentle of his ſpeche,
            and of his counſell wiſe:
            And ſtill with many prayſes more
            ſhe heaued him to the ſkies.
            Tell me els what (quod ſhe)
            this euermore I thought:
            But of our mariage ſay at once,
            what aunſwer haue you brought?
            
               
Nay ſoft quoth ſhe, I feare,
            your hurt by ſodain ioye:
            I liſt not play quoth Iuliet,
            although thou liſt to toye.
            How glad trow you was ſhe,
            when ſhe had heard her ſay:
            No farther of then Saterday,
            differred was the day.
            Againe the auncient nurce
            doth ſpeake of Romeus,
            And then (ſaid ſhe) he ſpake to me,
            and then I ſpake him thus.
            Nothing was done or ſaid,
            that ſhe hath left vntolde,
            Saue onely one, that ſhe forgot
            the taking of the golde.
            There is no loſſe quod ſhe,
            (ſweete wench) to loſſe of time:
            Ne in thine age ſhalt thou repent
            ſo much of any crime.
            For when I call to mynde,
            my former paſſed youth:
            One thing there is which moſt of all
            doth cauſe my endles ruth.
            At ſixtene yeres I firſt
            did chooſe my louing feere:
            And I was fully ripe before,
            (I dare well ſay) a yere.
            The pleaſure that I loſt.
            that yere ſo ouerpaſt:
            A thouſand times I haue be wept,
            and ſhall while lyfe doth laſt.
            In fayth it were a ſhame,
            yea ſinne it were ywiſſe,
            When thou mayſt liue in happy ioy
            to ſet light by thy bliſſe.
            
               
She that this mornyng could
            her miſtres mynde diſſwade,
            Is now becomme an Dratreſſe,
            her lady to perſwade.
            If any man be here
            whom loue hath clad with care:
            To him I ſpeake, if thou wilt ſpede,
            thy purſe thou muſt not ſpare.
            Two ſortes of men there are,
            ſeeld welcome in at doore:
            The welthy ſparing nigard, and
            the ſutor that is poore.
            For glittring gold is woont
            by kynd to mooue the hart:
            And often times a ſlight rewarde
            doth cauſe a more deſart.
            Ywritten haue I red,
            I wot not in what booke:
            There is no better way to fiſhe,
            then with a golden hooke.
            Of Romeus theſe two,
            doe ſitte and chat a while,
            And to them ſelfe they laugh, how they
            the mother ſhall begyle.
            A feate excuſe they finde,
            but ſure I know it not:
            And leaue for her to goe to ſhrift
            on Saterday ſhe got.
            So well this Iuliet,
            this wyly wench dyd know
            Her mothers angry houres, and eke
            the true bent of her bowe.
            The Saterday betimes
            in ſober weede yelad,
            She tooke her leaue, and forth ſhe went
            with viſage graue and ſad.
            
               
With her the nurce is ſent
            as brydle of her luſt:
            With her the mother ſendes a mayde,
            almoſt of equall truſt.
            Betwixt her teeth the bytte,
            the Ienet now hath cought:
            So warely eke the vyrgin walkes
            her mayde perceiueth nought.
            She gaſeth not in churche,
            on yong men of the towne:
            Ne wandreth ſhe from place to place,
            but ſtraight ſhe kneleth downe
            Vpon an alters ſtep,
            where ſhe deuoutly prayes:
            And there vpon her tender knees
            the wery lady ſtayes:
            Whilſt ſhe doth ſend her mayde
            the certain truth to know,
            If fryer Lawrence layſure had,
            to heare her ſhrift, or no.
            Out of his ſhriuing place
            he commes with pleaſant cheere:
            The ſhamefaſt mayde with baſhfull brow
            to himward draweth neere.
            Some great offence (ꝙ he)
            you haue committed late:
            Perhaps you haue diſpleaſd your frend,
            by geuing him a mate.
            Then turning to the nurce,
            and to the other mayde:
            Goe heare a maſſe or two quod be,
            which ſtraight way ſhalbe ſayde.
            For her confeſſion heard,
            I will vnto you twayne
            The charge that I receiud of you,
            reſtore to you agayne.
            
               
What, was not Iuliet
            trow you right well apayde?
            That for this truſty fryre hath chaungde
            her yong miſtruſting mayde?
            I dare well ſay there is
            in all Verona none:
            But Romeus, with whom ſhe would
            ſo gladly be alone.
            Thus to the fryers cell,
            they both foorth walked bin:
            He ſhuts the doore as ſoone as he
            and Iuliet were in.
            But Romeus her frend
            was entred in before:
            And there had wayted for his loue,
            two howers large and more.
            Eche minute ſeemde an howre,
            and euery howre a day:
            Twixt hope he liued and deſpayre,
            of cumming or of ſtay.
            Now wauering hope and feare,
            are quite fled out of ſight.
            For what he hopde he hath at hande
            his pleaſant cheefe delight.
            And ioyfull Iuliet
            is healde of all her ſmart:
            For now the reſt of all her parts,
            haue found her ſtraying hart.
            Both theyr confeſſions firſt
            the fryer hath heard them make:
            And then to her with lowder voyce
            thus fryer Lawrence ſpake.
            Fayre lady Iuliet
            my goſtly doughter deere:
            As farre as I of Romeus learne
            who by you ſtandeth here:
            
               
Twixt you it is agreed
            that you ſhalbe his wyfe:
            And he your ſpouſe in ſteady truth
            till death ſhall end your life.
            Are you both fully bent
            to kepe this great beheſt?
            And both the louers ſaid it was
            theyr onely harts requeſt.
            When he did ſee theyr myndes
            in linkes of loue ſo faſt:
            When in the prayſe of wedlocks ſtate
            ſomme ſkilfull talke was paſt.
            When he had told at length
            the wife what was her due:
            His duety eke by goſtly talke
            the youthfull huſband knew.
            How that the wife in loue
            muſt honor and obay:
            What loue and honor he doth owe,
            and dette that he muſt pay.
            The woords pronounced were
            which holy church of olde
            Appointed hath for mariage:
            and ſhe a ring of golde
            Receiued of Romeus:
            and then they both aroſe.
            To whom the frier then ſaid, perchaunce
            a part you will diſcloſe
            Betwixt your ſelfe alone
            the bottome of your hart:
            Say on at once, for time it is
            that hence you ſhould depart.
            Then Romeus ſaid to her,
            (both loth to part ſo ſoone:)
            Fayre lady ſend to me agayne
            your nurce this after noone.
            
               
Of corde I will beſpeake,
            a ladder by that time:
            By which, this night, while other ſleepe,
            I will your window clime.
            Then will we talke of loue,
            and of our olde diſpayres:
            And then with longer layſure had,
            diſpoſe our great affaires.
            Theſe ſaid, they kiſſe, and then
            part to theyr fathers houſe:
            The ioyfull bryde vnto her home,
            to his eke goth the ſpouſe.
            Contented both, and yet
            both vncontented ſtill:
            Till night and Venus child, geue leaue
            the wedding to fulfill.
            The painfull ſouldiour ſore
            ybet with wery warre:
            The merchant eke that nedefull things
            doth dred to fetch from farre:
            The plowman that for doute
            of feerce inuading foes,
            Rather to ſit in ydle eaſe
            then ſowe his tilt hath choſe:
            Reioyce to heare proclaymd
            the tydinges of the peace:
            Not pleaſurd with the ſound ſo much:
            but when the warres do ceaſe.
            Then ceaſed are the harmes
            which cruell warre bringes foorth.
            The merchant then may boldly fetch,
            his wares of precious woorth.
            Dredeleſſe the huſband man
            doth till his fertile feeld:
            For welth her mate, not for her ſelfe,
            is peace ſo precious held.
            
               
So louers liue in care,
            in dread, and in vnreſt:
            And dedly warre by ſtriuing thoughts
            they kepe within their breſt.
            But wedlocke is the peace
            wherby is freedome wonne,
            To do a thouſand pleaſant thinges
            that ſhould not els be donne.
            The newes of ended warre
            theſe two haue hard with ioy:
            But now they long the fruite of peace
            with pleaſure to enioy.
            In ſtormy wind and waue,
            in daunger to be loſt:
            Thy ſtearles ſhip (O Romeus)
            hath been long while betoſt.
            The ſeas are now appeaſd,
            and thou by happy ſtarre
            Art comme in ſight of quiet hauen:
            and now the wrackfull barre
            Is hid with ſwelling tyde,
            boldly thou mayſt reſort
            Vnto thy wedded ladies bed,
            thy long deſyred port.
            God graunt no follies miſt
            ſo dymme thy inward ſight,
            That thou do miſſe the chanell, that
            doth leade to thy delight.
            God graunt no daungers rocke
            ylurking in the darke
            Before thou win the happy port
            wracke thy ſea beaten barke.
            A ſeruant Romeus had,
            of woord and deede ſo iuſt:
            That with his life (if nede requierd)
            his maſter would him truſt,
            
               
His faithfulnes had oft
            our Romeus proued of olde
            And therfore all that yet was done
            vnto his man he tolde.
            Who ſtraight as he was charged,
            a corden ladder lookes:
            To which he hath made faſt two ſtrong
            and crooked yron hookes.
            The bryde to ſend the nurce
            at twylight fayleth not:
            To whom the bridegroome yeuen hath.
            the ladder that he got.
            And then to watch for him
            appointeth her an howre:
            For whether Fortune ſmyle on him,
            or if ſhe liſt to lowre,
            He will not miſſe to comme
            to his appoynted place,
            Where wont he was to take by ſtelth
            the view of Iuliets face.
            How long theſe louers thought
            the laſting of the day,
            Let other iudge that woonted are
            lyke paſſions to aſſay.
            For my part, I do geſſe
            eche howre ſeemes twenty yere:
            So that I deeme if they might haue
            (as of Alcume we heare)
            The ſunne bond to theyr will,
            if they the heauens might gyde:
            Black ſhade of night and doubled darke
            ſhould ſtraight all oner hyde.
            Thappointed howre is comme,
            he clad in riche araye,
            Walkes toward his deſyred home,
            good Fortune gyde his way.
            
               
Approching nere the place
            from whence his hart had lffe:
            So light he wor, he lept the wall,
            and there he ſpyde his wife.
            Who in the windowe watcht
            the cumming of her lorde:
            Where ſhe ſo ſurely had made faſt
            the ladder made of corde:
            That daungerles her ſpouſe
            the chaumber window climes,
            Where he ere then had wiſht himſelfe
            aboue ten thouſand times.
            The windowes cloſe are ſhut,
            els looke they for no geſt,
            To light the waxen quariers,
            the auncient nurce is preſt,
            Which Iuliet had before
            prepared to be light,
            That ſhe at pleaſure might beholde
            her huſbandes bewty bright.
            A Carchef white as ſnowe,
            ware Iuliet on her hed,
            Such as ſhe wonted was to weare,
            attyre meete for the bed.
            As ſoone as ſhe him ſpyde,
            about his necke ſhe clong:
            And by her long and ſlender armes
            a great while there ſhe hong.
            A thouſand times ſhe kiſt,
            and him vnkiſt agayne:
            Ne could ſhe ſpeake a woord to him
            though would ſhe nere ſo fayne.
            And like betwixt his armes
            to faynt his lady is:
            She fettes a ſigh, and clappeth cloſe
            her cloſed mouth to his.
            
               
And ready then to ſownde
            ſhe looked ruthfully:
            That loe, it made him both at once
            to liue and eke to dye.
            Theſe piteous painfull panges
            were haply ouerpaſt:
            And ſhe vnto her ſelfe agayne
            retorned home at laſt.
            Then through her troubled breſt,
            euen from the fartheſt part,
            An hollow ſigh, a meſſenger
            ſhe ſendeth from her hart.
            O Romeus quoth ſhe,
            in whome all vertues ſhyne:
            Welcome thou art into this place
            where from theſe eyes of myne,
            Such teary ſtreames dyd flowe,
            that I ſuppoſe welny
            The ſource of all my bitter teares
            is altogether drye.
            Abſence ſo pynde my heart,
            which on thy preſence fed:
            And of thy ſafetie and thy health
            ſo much I ſtood in dred.
            But now what is decreed
            by fatall deſteny:
            I force it not, let Fortune do
            and death their woorſt to me.
            Full recompenſd am I
            for all my paſſed harmes,
            In that the Gods haue graunted me
            to claſpe thee in myne armes.
            The chriſtall teares began
            to ſtand in Romeus eyes,
            When he vnto his ladies woordes
            gan aunſwere in this wiſe.
            
               
Though cruell Fortune be
            ſo much my dedly foe:
            That I ne can by liuely proofe
            cauſe thee (fayre dame) to knowe
            How much I am by loue
            enthralled vnto thee:
            Ne yet what mighty powre thou haſt
            by thy deſert on me.
            Ne tormentes that for thee
            I did ere this endure:
            Yet of thus much (ne will I fayne)
            I may thee well aſſure.
            The leaſt of many paynes
            which of thy abſence ſprong:
            More paynefully then death it ſelfe
            my tender hart hath wroong.
            Ere this one death had reft
            a thouſand deathes away:
            But lyfe prolonged was by hope,
            of this deſired day.
            Which ſo iuſt tribute payes
            of all my paſſed mone:
            That I as well contented am,
            as if my ſelfe alone
            Did from the Occean reigne
            vnto the ſea of Inde:
            Wherfore now let vs wipe away
            old cares out of our mynde.
            For as the wretched ſtate
            is now redreſt at laſt,
            So is it ſkill behinde our backe
            the curſed care to caſt.
            Since Fortune of her grace
            hath place and time aſſinde
            Where we with pleaſure may content
            our vncontented minde.
            
               
In Lethes hyde we deepe
            all greefe and all annoy,
            Whilſt we do bath in bliſſe, and fill
            our hungry harts with ioye.
            And for the time to comme,
            let be our buſy care:
            So wiſely to direct our loue
            as no wight els be ware.
            Leſt enmous foes by force
            deſpoyle our new delight,
            And vs throwe backe from happy ſtate
            to more vnhappy plight.
            Fayre Iuliet began
            to aunſwere what he ſayde:
            But foorth in haſt the olde nurce ſtept,
            and ſo her aunſwere ſtayde.
            Who takes not time (quoth ſhe)
            when time well offred is,
            An other time ſhall ſeeke for time,
            and yet of time ſhall miſſe.
            And when occaſion ſerues,
            who ſo doth let it ſlippe,
            Is woorthy ſure (if I might iudge)
            of laſhes with a whippe.
            Wherfore, if eche of you
            hath harmde the other ſo,
            And eche of you hath been the cauſe
            of others wayled woe,
            Loe here a fielde, (ſhe ſhewd
            a fieeldbed ready dight)
            Where you may, if you liſt, in armes,
            reuenge your ſelfe by fight.
            Wherto theſe louers both
            gan eaſely aſſent,
            And to the place of mylde reuenge
            with pleaſant cheere they went.
            
               
Where they were left alone,
            the nurce is gone to reſt:
            How can this be? they reſtles lye,
            ne yet they feele vnreſt.
            I graunt that I enuie
            the bliſſe they liued in:
            Oh that I might haue found the like.
            I wiſh it for no ſin.
            But that I might as well
            with pen their ioyes depaynt,
            As here to fore I haue diſplayd
            their ſecret hidden playnt.
            Of ſhyuering care and bred,
            I haue felt many a fit,
            But Fortune ſuch delight as theyrs
            dyd neuer graunt me yet.
            By proofe no certain truth
            can I vnhappy write:
            But what I geſſe by likelihod,
            that dare I to endite.
            The blyndfyld goddeſſe that
            with frowning face doth fraye,
            And from theyr ſeate the mighty kinges
            throwes downe with hedlong ſway▪
            
            Begynneth now to turne,
            to theſe her ſmyling face,
            Nedes muſt they taſt of great delight,
            ſo much in Fortunes grace.
            If Cupid, God of loue,
            be God of pleaſant ſport,
            I thinck O Romeus Mars himſelfe
            enuies thy happy ſort.
            Ne Venus iuſtly might,
            (as I ſuppoſe) repent,
            If in thy ſtead (O Iuliet)
            this pleaſant time ſhe ſpent.
            
               
This paſſe they foorth the night
            in ſport, in ioly game:
            The haſtines of Phoebus ſteeds
            in great deſpyte they blame.
            And now the virgins fort
            hath warlike Romeus got,
            In which as yet no breache was made
            by force of canon ſhot.
            And now in eaſe he doth
            poſſeſſe the hoped place:
            How glad was he, ſpeake you that may
            your louers parts embrace?
            The mariage thus made vp,
            and both the parties pleaſd:
            The nigh approche of dayes retoorne
            theſe ſeely foles diſeaſd.
            And for they might no while
            in pleaſure paſſe theyr time,
            Ne leyſure had they much to blame
            the haſty mornings crime:
            With frendly kiſſe in armes
            of her his leaue he takes,
            And euery othe night to come,
            a ſolemne othe he makes.
            By one ſelfe meane, and eke
            to come at one ſelfe howre:
            And ſo he doth till Fortune liſt
            to ſawſe his ſweete with ſowre.
            But who is he that can
            his preſent ſtate aſſure?
            And ſay vnto himſelf, thy ioyes
            ſhall yet a day endure.
            So wauering Fortunes whele
            her chaunges be ſo ſtraunge.
            And euery wight ythralled is
            by ſate vnto her chaunge.
            
               
Who raignes ſo ouer all,
            that eche man hath his part:
            (Although not aye perchaunce alike)
            of pleaſure and of ſmart.
            For after many ioyes,
            ſome feele but little payne:
            And from that little greefe they toorne
            to happy ioy againe.
            But other ſomme there are,
            that liuing long in woe,
            At length they be in quiet eaſe,
            but long abide not ſo.
            Whoſe greefe is much increaſt
            by myrth that went before:
            Becauſe the ſodayne chaunge of thinges
            doth make it ſeeme the more.
            Of this vnlucky ſorte
            our Romeus is one
            For all his hap turnes to miſhap,
            and all his myrth to mone.
            And ioyfull Iuliet
            an other leafe muſt toorne:
            As wont ſhe was (her ioyes bereft)
            ſhe muſt begin to moorne.
            The ſummer of their bliſſe,
            doth laſt a month or twayne:
            But winters blaſt with ſpedy foote
            doth bring the fall agayne.
            Whom glorious fortune erſt
            had heaued to the ſkies:
            By enuious fortune ouerthrowne
            on earth now groueling lyes.
            She payd theyr former greefe
            with pleaſures doubled gayne:
            But now for pleaſures vſery
            ten folde redoubleth payne.
            
               
The prince could neuer cauſe
            thoſe houſholds ſo agree,
            But that ſome ſparcles of their wrath,
            as yet remaining bee.
            Which lye this whi eraakd vp,
            in aſhes pale and ded,
            Till tyme do ſerue that they agayne
            in waſting flame may ſpred.
            At holieſt times men ſay
            moſt heynous crimes are donne,
            The morowe after Eaſter day
            the miſchiefe new begonne.
            A band of Capilets
            did meete (my hart it rewes)
            Within the walles by Purſers gate,
            a band of Montagewes.
            The Capilets as cheefe,
            a yong man haue choſe out:
            Beſt exerciſd in feates of armes,
            and nobleſt of the rowte.
            Our Iuliets vnkles ſonne
            that cliped was Tibalt:
            He was of body tall and ſtrong,
            and of his courage halt.
            They neede no trumpet ſounde
            to byd them geue the charge,
            So lowde he cryde with ftrayned voyce
            and mouth out ſtretched large.
            Now, now, (quod he) my frends,
            our ſelfe ſo let vs wreake,
            That of this dayes reuenge, and vs,
            our childrens heyres may ſpeake.
            Now once for all let vs
            their ſwelling pride aſſwage,
            Let none of them eſcape aliue,
            then he with furious rage
            
               
And they with him gaue charge,
            vpon they preſent foes,
            And then forthwith a ſkyrmiſhe great
            vpon this fray aroſe.
            For loe, the Montagewes
            thought ſhame away to flye,
            And rather then to liue with ſhame,
            with prayſe did chooſe to dye.
            The woordes that Tybalt vſd
            to ſtyrre his folke to yre,
            Haue in the breſtes of Montegewes
            kindled a furious fyre.
            With Lyons hartes they fight,
            warely themſelfe defende:
            To wound his foe, his preſent wit
            and force eche one doth bend.
            This furious fray is long,
            on eche ſide ſtoutly fought,
            That whether part had got the woorſt
            full doutfull were the thought.
            The noyſe hereof anon,
            throughout the towne doth flye:
            And partes are taken on euery ſide.
            both kinreds thether hye.
            Here one doth gaſpe for breth,
            his frend beſtrideth him,
            And he hath loſt a hand, and he
            another maymed him.
            His leg is cutte whilſt he
            ſtrikes at an other full:
            And whō he would haue thruſt quite through
            hath cleft his cracked ſkull.
            Theyr valiant harts forbode
            theyr foote to geue the grounde,
            With vnappauled cheere they tooke
            full deepe and doutfull wounde.
            
               
Thus foote by foote long while,
            and ſhield to ſhield ſet faſt:
            One foe doth make another faynt
            but makes him not agaſt.
            And whilſt this noyſe is ryfe
            in euery townes mans eare,
            Eke walking with his frendes, the noyſe
            doth wofull Romeus heare.
            With ſpedy foote he ronnes
            vnto the fray apace:
            With him thoſe fewe that were with him
            he leadeth to the place.
            They pittie much to ſee
            the ſlaughter made ſo greate:
            That wetſhod they might ſtand in blood
            on eyther ſide the ſtreate.
            Part frendes (ſayd he) part frendes,
            helpe frendes to part the fray:
            And to the reſt, enough (he cryes)
            now time it is to ſtaye.
            Gods farther wrath you ſtyrre,
            beſide the hurt you feele:
            And with this new vprore confounde
            all this our common wele.
            But they ſo buſy are
            in fight ſo egar and feerce,
            That through theyr eares his ſage aduiſe
            no leyſure had to pearce.
            Then lept he in the throng,
            to part, and barre the blowes,
            As well of thoſe that were his frendes:
            as of his dedly foes.
            As ſoone as Tybalt had
            our Romeus eſpyde:
            He threw a thruſt at him that would
            haue paſt from ſide to ſide.
            
               
But Romeus euer went
            (douting his foes) well armde:
            So that the ſwerd (kept out by mayle)
            hath nothing Romeus harmde.
            Thou doeſt me wrong (quoth he)
            for I but part the fraye,
            Not dread, but other waighty cauſe
            my haſty hand doth ſtay.
            Thou art the cheefe of thine,
            the nobleſt eke thou art:
            Wherfore leaue of thy malice now,
            and helpe theſe folke to parte.
            Many are hurt, ſome ſlayne,
            and ſome are like to dye.
            No, coward traytor boy (ꝙ he)
            ſtraight way I mynd to trye
            Whether thy ſugred talke,
            and tong ſo ſmootely fylde:
            Againſt the force of this my ſwerd
            ſhall ſerue thee for a ſhylde.
            And then at Romeus hed,
            a blow he ſtrake ſo hard,
            That might haue cloue him to the brayne
            but for his cunning ward.
            It was but lent to him
            that could repay agayne:
            And geue him death for intereſt,
            a well forborne gayne.
            Right as a foreſt bore,
            that lodged in the thicke,
            Pinched with dog, or els with ſpeare
            ypricked to the quicke:
            His briſtles ſtiffe vpright
            vpon his backe doth ſet,
            And in his fomy mouth, his ſharp
            and crooked tuſkes doth whet.
            
               
Or as a Lyon wylde
            that rampeth in his rage,
            His whelpes bereft, whoſe fury can
            no weaker beaſt aſſwage.
            Such ſeemed Romeus,
            in euery others ſight:
            When he him ſhope, of wrong receaude
            tauenge himſelfe by fight.
            Euen as two thunderboltes,
            throwne downe out of the ſkye,
            That through the ayre the maſſy earth
            and ſeas haue power to flye:
            So met theſe two, and while
            they chaunge a blowe or twayne,
            Our Romeus thruſt him through the throte
            and ſo is Tybalt ſlayne.
            Loe here the ende of thoſe
            that ſtyrre a dedly ſtryfe:
            Who thyrſteth after others death,
            himſelfe hath loſt his life.
            The Capilets are quaylde,
            by Tybalts ouerthrowe:
            The courage of the Mountagewes,
            by Romeus ſight doth growe,
            The townes men waren ſtrong,
            the prince doth ſend his force:
            The fray hath end, the Capilets
            do bring the brethles corce,
            Before the prince: and craue,
            that cruell dedly payne
            May be the guerdon of his falt,
            that hath their kinſman ſlaine.
            The Montagewes do pleade,
            theyr Romeus voyde of falt:
            The lookers on do ſay, the fight
            begonne was by Tybalt.
            
               
The prince doth pawſe, and then
            geues ſentence in a while,
            That Romeus, for ſleying him
            ſhould gone into exyle.
            His foes would haue him hangde,
            or ſterue in priſon ſtrong:
            His frendes do think (but dare not ſay)
            that Romeus hath wrong.
            Both houſholds ſtraight are charged
            on payne of loſing lyfe:
            Theyr bloudy weapons layd aſide,
            to ceaſe the ſtyrred ſtryfe.
            This common plage is ſpred,
            through all the towne anon:
            From ſide to ſyde the towne is fild
            with murmour and with mone.
            For Tybalts haſty death,
            bewayled was of ſomme,
            Both for his ſkill in frates of armes,
            and for in time to comme:
            He ſhould (had this not chaunced)
            been riche, and of great powre:
            To helpe his frendes, and ſerue the ſtate,
            which hope within an howre
            Was waſted quite, and he
            thus yelding vp his breath,
            More then he holpe the towne in lyfe,
            hath harmde it by his death.
            And other ſomme bewayle,
            (but ladies moſt of all)
            The lookeles lot by Fortunes gylt,
            that is ſo late befall,
            (Without his falt,) vnto
            the ſeely Romeus,
            For whilſt that he from natife land
            ſhall liue exyled thus.
            
               
From heauenly bewties light,
            and his welſhaped parts:
            The ſight of which, was wont (faire dames)
            to glad your youthfull harts.
            Shall you be baniſhd quite:
            and tyll he do retoorne
            What hope haue you to ioy?
            what hope to ceaſe to moorne?
            This Romeus was borne
            ſo much in heauens grace
            Of Fortune, and of nature ſo
            beloued, that in his face
            (Beſide the heauenly bewty
            gliſtring ay ſo bright:
            And ſeemely grace, that wontes ſo
            to glad the ſeers ſight.)
            A certain charme was graued
            by natures ſecret arte:
            That vertue had to draw to it,
            the loue of many a hart.
            So euery one doth wiſh,
            to beare a part of payne:
            That he releaſed of exyle,
            might ſtraight retorne agayne.
            But how doth moorne emong
            the moorners Iuliet?
            How doth ſhe bathe her breſt in teares?
            what depe ſighes doth ſhe fet?
            How doth ſhe tear her heare?
            her weede how doth ſhe rent?
            How fares the louer hearing of
            her louers baniſhment?
            How wayles ſhe Libalts death,
            whom ſhe had loued ſo well?
            Her hearty greefe and piteous plaint,
            cunning I want to tell
            
               
For deluing depely now
            in depth of depe diſpayre:
            With wretched ſorowes cruell ſound
            ſhe fils the empty ayre.
            And to the loweſt hell,
            downe falles her heauy crye,
            And vp vnto the heauens haight
            her piteous plaint doth flye.
            The waters and the woods,
            of ſighes and ſobs reſounde:
            And from the hard reſounding rockes
            her ſorowes do rebounde.
            Eke from her teary eyne,
            downe rayned many a ſhowre:
            That in the garden where ſhe walkd
            might water herbe and flowre.
            But when at length ſhe ſaw
            her ſelfe outraged ſo:
            Vnto her chaumber ſtraight ſhe hide
            there ouercharged with wo.
            Vpon her ſtately bed,
            her painfull parts ſhe threw:
            And in ſo wondrous wiſe began
            her ſorowes to renewe:
            That ſure no hart ſo hard,
            (but it of flint had byn:)
            But would haue rude the pitious plaint
            that ſhe did languiſhe in.
            Then rapt out of her ſelfe,
            whilſt ſhe on euery ſide
            Did caſt her reſtles eye, at length
            the windowe ſhe eſpide,
            Through which ſhe had with ioy
            ſeene Romeus many a time:
            Which oft the ventrous knight was wont
            For Iuliets ſake to clyme.
            
               
She cryde O curſed windowe,
            a curſt be euery pane,
            Through which (alas) to one I raught
            the cauſe of life and bane.
            If by thy meane I haue
            ſome ſlight delight receaued,
            Or els ſuch fading pleaſure as
            by Fortune ſtraight was reaued:
            Haſt thou not made me pay
            a tribute rigorous?
            Of heaped greefe, and laſting care:
            and ſorowes dolorous?
            That theſe my tender partes,
            which nedefull ſtrength do lacke,
            To beare ſo great vnweldy lode?
            vpon ſo weake a backe:
            Oppreſt with waight of cares
            and with theſe ſorowes rife:
            At length muſt open wide to death,
            the gates of lothed lyfe.
            That ſo my wery ſprite,
            may ſomme where els vnlode
            His dedly lode, and free from thrall
            may ſeeke els where abrode:
            For pleaſant quiet eaſe,
            and for aſſured reſt,
            Which I as yet could neuer finde,
            but for my more vnreſt.
            O Romeus, when firſt
            we both acquainted were,
            When to thy paynted promiſes
            I lent my liſtning eare:
            Which to the brinkes you fild
            with many a ſolemne othe,
            And I them iudgde empty of gyle,
            and fraughted full of troth:
            
               
I thought you rather would
            continue our good will,
            And ſeeke tappeaſe our fathers ſtrife
            which daily groweth ſtill.
            I little wend you would
            haue ſought occaſion how
            By ſuch an heynous act to breake
            the peace, and eke your vowe
            Wherby your bright renoune,
            all whole yelipſed is,
            And I vnhappy huſbandles,
            of cumfort robde, and bliſſe.
            But if you did ſo much
            the blood of Capels thyrſt,
            Why haue you often ſpared mine?
            myne might haue quencht it firſt.
            Since that ſo many times,
            and in ſo ſecret place
            (Where you were wont with vele of loue
            to hyde your hatreds face.)
            My doutfull lyfe hath hapt
            by fatall dome to ſtand,
            In mercy of your cruell hart,
            and of your bloudy hand.
            What? ſeemd the conqueſt which
            you got of me, ſo ſmall?
            What? ſeemd it not enough that I
            poore wretch, was made your thrall?
            But that you muſt increaſe
            it with that kinſmans blood,
            Which for his woorth and loue to me
            moſt in my fauour ſtood?
            Well, goe hencefoorth els where,
            and ſeeke another whyle,
            Some other as vnhappy as I,
            by flattry to begyle.
            
               
And where I comme, ſee that
            you ſhonne to ſhew your face:
            For your excuſe within my hart
            ſhall finde no reſting place.
            And I that now too late
            my former fault repent:
            Will ſo the reſt of wery life
            with many teares lament:
            That ſoone my ioyceles corps,
            ſhall yeld vp baniſhd breath,
            And where on earth it reſtles liued,
            in earth ſeeke reſt by death.
            Theſe ſayde, her tender hart,
            by payne oppreſſed ſore:
            Reſtraynd her teares, and forced her tong
            to keepe her talke in ſtore.
            And then as ſtill ſhe was,
            as if in ſownd ſhe lay:
            And then agayne, wroth with her ſelfe,
            with feble voyce gan ſay.
            Ah cruell murthering tong,
            murthrer of others fame:
            How durſt thou once attempt to tooch
            the honor of his name?
            Whoſe dedly foes doe yelde
            him dewe and earned prayſe:
            For though his fredome be bereft,
            his honor not decayes.
            Why blamſt thou Romeus
            for ſleying of Tybalt,
            Since he is gyltles guite of all,
            and Tybalt beares the falt?
            Whether ſhall he (alas)
            poore baniſhd man now flye?
            What place of ſuccor ſhall he ſeeke
            beneth the ſtarry ſkye?
            
               
Synce ſhe purſueth him,
            and him defames by wrong:
            That in diſtres ſhould be his fort,
            and onely rampier ſtrong.
            Receiue the recompence,
            O Romeus of thy wife:
            Who for ſhe was vnkind her ſelfe,
            doth offer vp her lyfe.
            In flames of yre, in ſighes,
            in ſorow and in ruth:
            So to reuenge the crime ſhe did
            commit againſt thy truth.
            Theſe ſaid, ſhe could no more,
            her ſenſes all gan fayle:
            And dedly panges began ſtraight way
            her tender hart aſſayle.
            Her limmes ſhe ſtretched forth,
            ſhe drew no more her breath,
            Who had been there, might well haue ſeene
            the ſignes of preſent death.
            The nurce that knew no cauſe,
            why ſhe abſented her,
            Did doute leſt that ſome ſodain greefe
            too much tormented her.
            Eche where but where ſhe was
            the carefull Beldam ſought,
            Laſt, of the chamber where ſhe lay,
            ſhe haply her bethought.
            Where ſhe with piteous eye,
            her nurce childe did beholde:
            Her limmes ſtretched out, her vtward parts
            as any marble colde.
            The nurce ſuppoſde that ſhe
            had payde to death her det:
            And then as ſhe had loſt her wittes,
            ſhe cryed to Iuliet.
            
               
Ah my dere hart (quoth ſhe)
            how greeueth me thy death?
            Alas what cauſe haſt thou thus ſoone,
            to yelde vp liuing breath?
            But while ſhe handled her,
            and chafed euery part,
            She knew there was ſome ſparke of life
            by beating of her hart.
            So that a thouſand times
            ſhe cald vpon her name,
            There is no way to helpe a traunce,
            but ſhe hath tryde the ſame.
            She openeth wide her mouth,
            ſhe ſtoppeth cloſe her noſe,
            She bendeth downe her breſt, ſhe wringes
            her fingers and her toes.
            And on her boſome colde,
            ſhe layeth clothes hot,
            A warmed and a holeſome iuyce
            ſhe powreth downe her throte.
            At length doth Iuliet,
            heaue fayntly vp her eyes,
            And then ſhe ſtretcheth forth her arme,
            and then her nurce ſhe ſpyes.
            But when ſhe was awakde,
            from her vnkindly traunce:
            Why doſt thou trouble me (quoth ſhe)
            what draue thee (with miſchaunce)
            To come to ſee my ſprite,
            forſake my brethles corce?
            Goe hence, and let me dye, if thou
            haue on my ſmart remorſe.
            For who would ſee her frend
            to liue in dedly payne?
            Alas, I ſee my greefe begoone,
            for euer will remayne.
            
               
Or who would ſeeke to liue,
            all pleaſure being paſt?
            My myrth is donne, my moorning mone
            for ay is like to laſt.
            Wherfore ſince that there is
            none other remedy,
            Comme gentle death, and ryue my hart,
            at once, and let my dye.
            The nurce with tricling teares,
            to witnes inward ſmart,
            With helow ſigh fetchd from the depth,
            of her appauled hart.
            Thus ſpake to Iuliet,
            yelad with eugly care.
            Good lady myne, I do not know
            what makes you thus to fare.
            Ne yet the cauſe of your
            vnmeaſurde heauines.
            But of this one I you aſſure,
            for care and ſorowes ſtreſſe,
            This hower large and more,
            I thought (ſo god me ſaue)
            That my dead corps ſhould wayte on yours,
            to your vntimely graue.
            Alas my tender nurce,
            and truſty frend (quoth ſhe)
            Art thou ſo blinde, that with thine eye,
            thou canſt not eaſely ſee
            The lawfull cauſe I haue,
            to ſorow and to moorne,
            Since thoſe the which I hyld moſt deere
            I haue at once forlorne?
            Her nurce then aunſwerd thus.
            Me thinkes it ſits you yll,
            To fall in theſe extremities
            that may you gyltles ſpill.
            
               
For when the ſtormes of care,
            and troubles do aryſe,
            Then is the time for men to know,
            the fooliſh from the wiſe.
            You are accounted wiſe,
            a foole am I your nurce:
            But I ſee not how in like caſe
            I could be haue me wurſe.
            Tibalt your frend is ded,
            what weene you by your teares,
            To call him backe againe? thinke you
            that he your crying heares?
            You ſhall perceue the falt,
            (if it be iuſtly tryde)
            Of his ſo ſodayn death, was in
            his raſhnes and his pryde.
            Would you that Romeus,
            him ſelfe had wronged ſo,
            To ſuffer himſelfe cauſeles to be
            outraged of his foe?
            To whom in no reſpect,
            he ought a place to geue?
            Let it ſuffiſe to thee fayre dame,
            that Romeus doth liue.
            And that there is good hope
            that he within a while,
            With greater glory ſhalbe calde
            home from his hard exile.
            How wel yborne he is,
            thy ſelfe I know canſt tell:
            By kindred ſtrong, and well alyed,
            of all beloued well.
            With patience arme thy ſelfe,
            for though that Fortunes cryme
            Without your falt, to both your greefes
            depart you for a time.
            
               
I dare ſay for amendes
            of all your preſent payne
            She will reſtore your owne to you,
            within a month or twayne.
            With ſuch contented eaſe,
            as neuer erſt you had:
            Wherfore reioyce a while in hope,
            and be ne more ſo ſad.
            And that I may diſcharge
            your hart of heauy care:
            A certaine way I haue found out,
            my paynes ne will I ſpare.
            To learne his preſent ſtate,
            and what in time to comme
            He mindes to doe, which knowne by me,
            you ſhall know all and ſomme.
            But that I dread the whilſt
            your ſorowes will you quell,
            Straight would I hye where he doth lurke
            to frier Lawrence cell.
            But if you gyn eftſones
            (as erſt you did) to moorre
            Wherto goe I, you will be ded
            before I thence retoorne.
            So I ſhall ſpend in waſt,
            my time, and buſy payne,
            So vnto you (your life once loſt)
            good aunſwere commes in vayne.
            So ſhall I ridde my ſelfe
            with this ſharpe pointed knife:
            So ſhall you cauſe your parents derre
            wax wery of theyr life.
            So ſhall your Romeus,
            (deſpyſing liuely breath,)
            With haſty foote (before his tyme)
            ronne to vntimely death.
            
               
Where if you can a while,
            by reaſon, rage ſuppreſſe,
            I hope at my retorne to bring
            the ſalue of your diſtreſſe.
            Now chooſe to haue me here
            a partner of your payne,
            Or promoſſe me, to feede on hope,
            till I retorne agayne.
            Her miſtres ſendes her forth,
            and makes a graue beheſt,
            With reaſons rayne to rule the thoughts
            that rage within her breſt.
            When hugy beapes of harmes,
            are heapd before her eyes,
            Then vaniſh they by hope of ſcape,
            and thus the lady lyes,
            Twixt well aſſured truſt.
            and doutfull lewd diſpayre,
            Now blacke and ougly be her thoughts:
            now ſeeme they white and fayre.
            As oft in ſummer tide,
            blacke cloudes do dimme the ſonne,
            And ſtraight againe in cleareſt ſkye
            his reſtles ſteedes do ronne,
            So Iuliets wandring mynd
            yclowded is with woe,
            And by and by her haſty thought
            the woes doth ouergoe.
            But now is time to tell
            whilſt ſhe was toſſed thus
            What windes did driue or hauen did hold
            her louer, louer Romeus
            When he had ſlayne his foe,
            that gan this dedly ſtrife,
            And ſaw the furious fray had ende,
            by ending Tybalts life:
            
               
He fled the ſharpe reuenge
            of thoſe that yet did liue,
            And douting much what penall doome
            the troubled prince myght gyue,
            He ſought ſome where vnſeene,
            to lurke a little ſpace,
            And truſty Lawrence ſecret cell,
            he thought the ſureſt place.
            In doutfull happe ay beſt,
            a truſty frend is tride,
            The frendly fryer in this diſtreſſe,
            doth graunt his frend to hyde.
            A ſecret place he hath,
            well ſeeled round about,
            The mouth of which, ſo cloſe is ſhut,
            that none may finde it out.
            Both roome there is to walke,
            and place to ſitte and reſt,
            Beſide, a bed to ſleape vpon,
            full ſoft and trimly dreſt.
            The flowre is planked ſo
            with mattes, it is ſo warme.
            That neither wind, nor ſmoky damps
            haue powre him ought to harme.
            Where he was wont in youth,
            his fayre frendes to beſtowe,
            There now he hydeth Romeus
            whilſt forth he goeth to knowe
            Both what is ſayd and donne,
            and what appoynted payne,
            Is publiſhed by trumpets ſound.
            then home he hyes agayne.
            By this, vnto his cell,
            the nurce with ſpedy pace:
            Was co
                  •••
               e the nereſt way: ſhe ſought,
            no ydel reſting place.
            
               
The fryer ſent home the newes
            of Romeus certain helth:
            And promeſſe made (what ſo befell)
            he ſhould that night by ſtelth
            Comme to his wonted place
            that they in nedefull wiſe
            Of theyr affayres in time to comme,
            might thorowly deuyſe.
            Thoſe ioyfull newes, the nurce
            brought home with mery ioy:
            And now our Iuliet ioyes, to thinke,
            ſhe ſhall her loue enioye.
            The fryer ſhuts faſt his doore,
            and then to him beneth.
            That waytes to heare the doutefull newes
            of lyfe orels of death:
            Thy hap quoth he, is good,
            daunger of death is none:
            But thou ſhalt liue, and doe full well,
            in ſpite of ſpitefull fone.
            This onely payne for thee
            was erſt proclaymde aloude,
            A baniſhd man, thou mayſt thee not
            within Verona ſhroude.
            Theſe heauy tydinges heard,
            his golden lockes he tare:
            And like a frantike man hath torne
            the garmentes that he ware.
            And as the ſmitten deere,
            in brakes is waltring found:
            So waltreth he, and with his breſt
            doth beate the troden grounde.
            He riſeth eft, and ſtrikes
            his head againſt the wals,
            He falleth downe againe, and lowde
            for haſty death be cals.
            
               
Come ſpedy death (quoth he)
            the readieſt leache in loue,
            Since nought can els beneth the ſunne
            the ground of griefe remoue.
            Of lothſome life breake downe
            the hated ſtaggering ſtayes,
            Deſtroy, deſtroy at once the lyfe
            that faintly yet decayes.
            But you (fayre dame) in whome
            dame nature dyd deuiſe,:
            With cunning hand to woorke, that might
            ſeeme wondrous in our eyes:
            For you I pray the Gods,
            your pleaſures to increaſe,
            And all miſhap, with this my death,
            for euermore to ceaſe.
            And mighty Ioue with ſpeede,
            of iuſtice bring them lowe,
            Whoſe lofty pryde (without our gylt)
            our bliſſe doth ouerblowe.
            And Cupide graunt to thoſe
            theyr ſpedy wrongs redreſſe,
            That ſhall bewayle my cruell death,
            and pity her diſtreſſe.
            Therewith, a cloude of ſighes,
            he breathd into the ſkies:
            And two great ſtreames of bitter teares,
            ran from his ſwollen eyes.
            Theſe thinges, the auncient fryre,
            with ſorow ſaw, and heard,
            Of ſuch begynning eke, the ende,
            the wiſe man greatly feard.
            But loe, he was ſo weake,
            by reaſon of his age,
            That he ne could by force, repreſſe
            the rigour of his rage.
            
               
His wiſe and frendly woordes,
            he ſpeaketh to the ayre:
            For Romeus ſo vexed is,
            with care and with diſpayre,
            That no aduiſe can perce,
            his cloſe forſtopped eares:
            So now the fryer doth take his part,
            in ſhedding ruthfull teares.
            With colour pale, and wan,
            with armes full hard yfold,
            With wofull cheere, his wayling frend,
            he ſtandeth to beholde.
            And then, our Romeus.
            with tender handes ywrong:
            With voyce, with plaint made horce, wt ſobs,
            and with a foltring tong.
            Renewd with nouel mone
            the dolours of his hart,
            His outward dreery cheere bewrayde,
            his ſtore of inward ſmart.
            Fyrſt, nature did he blame,
            the author of his lyfe,
            In which his ioyes had been ſo ſcant,
            and ſorowes aye ſo ryfe:
            The time and place of byrth,
            he fierſly did reproue,
            He cryed out (with open mouth)
            againſt the ſtarres aboue:
            The 
                  ••
               tall ſiſters three,
            he ſaid, had done hun wrong,
            The threed that ſhould not haue been ſponne
            they had drawne foorth too long.
            He wiſhed that he had
            before this time been borne,
            Or that as ſoone as he wan light,
            his life he had forlorne.
            
               
His nurce he curſed, and
            the hand that gaue him pappe,
            The midwife eke with tender grype
            that held him in her lappe:
            And then did he complaine,
            on Venus cruel ſonne
            Who led him firſt vnto the rockes,
            which he ſhould warely ſhonne.
            By meane wherof he loſt,
            both lyfe and libertie,
            And dyed a hundred times a day,
            and yet could neuer dye.
            Loues troubles laſten long,
            the ioyes he geues are ſhort:
            He forceth not a louers payne,
            theyr erneſt is his ſport.
            A thouſand thinges and more,
            I here let paſſe to write,
            Which vnto loue this wofull man,
            dyd ſpeake in great deſpite.
            On Fortune eke he raylde,
            he calde her deafe, and blynde,
            Vinconſtant, fond, deceitfull raſhe,
            vnruthfull, and vnkynd.
            And to him ſelf he layd
            a great part of the falt:
            For that he ſlewe, and was not ſlayne,
            in fighting with Tibalt.
            He blamed all the world,
            and all he did defye
            But Iuliet, for whom he liued,
            for whom eke would he dye.
            When after raging fits,
            appeaſed was his rage,
            And when his paſſions (powred forth)
            gan partly to aſſwage.
            
               
So wiſely did the fryre,
            vnto his tale replye,
            That he ſtraight cared for his life,
            that erſt had care to dye.
            Art thou quoth he a man?
            Thy ſhape ſaith ſo thou art:
            Thy crying and thy weping eyes,
            denote a womans hart.
            For manly reaſon is
            quite from of thy mynd outchaſed,
            And in her ſtead affections lewd,
            and fanſies highly placed.
            So that, I ſtoode in doute
            this howre (at the leaſt)
            If thou a man, or woman wert,
            or els a brutiſh beaſt.
            A wiſe man in the midſt
            of troubles and diſtres,
            Still ſtandes not wayling preſent harme,
            but ſeeks his harmes redres,
            As when the winter flawes,
            with dredfull noyſe ariſe,
            And heaue the fomy ſwelling waues
            vp to the ſtarry ſkies,
            So that the brooſed barke
            in cruell ſeas betoſt,
            Diſpayreth of the happy hauen
            in daunger to be loſt.
            The pylate bold at helme,
            cryes, mates ſtrike now your ſayle:
            And tornes her ſtemme into the waues,
            that ſtrongly her aſſayle.
            Then driuen hard vpon
            the bare and wrackfull ſhore,
            In greater daunger to be wract,
            then he had been before.
            
               
He ſeeth his ſhip full right
            againſt the rocke to ronne,
            But yet he dooth what lyeth in hun
            the perilous rocke to ſhonne.
            Sometimes the beaten boate,
            by cunning gouernment,
            The ancors loſt, the cables broke,
            and all the tackle ſpent.
            The roder ſmitten of,
            and ouer boord the maſt,
            Doth win the long deſyred porte,
            the ſtormy daunger paſt.
            But if the maſter dread,
            and ouerpreſt with woe,
            Begin to wring his handes, and lets
            the gyding rodder goe
            The ſhip rents on the rocke,
            or ſinketh in the deepe,
            And eke the coward drenched is,
            So: if thou ſtill be weepe
            And ſeke not how to helpe
            the chaunges that do chaunce,
            Thy cauſe of ſorow ſhall increaſe,
            thou cauſe of thy miſchaunce.
            Other account thee wiſe,
            prooue not thy ſelfe a foole,
            Now put in practiſe leſſons learnd,
            of old in wiſdomes ſchoole,
            The wiſe man ſaith, beware
            thou double not thy payne:
            For one perhaps thou mayſt abyde,
            but hardly ſuffer twayne.
            As well we ought to ſeeke
            thinges hurtfull to decreaſe,
            As to endeuor helping thinges
            by ſtudy to increaſe.
            
               
The prayſe of trew fredom,
            in wiſdomes bondage lyes
            He winneth blame whoſe deedes be fonde,
            although his woords be wiſe.
            Sickenes the bodies gayle,
            greefe, gayle is of the mynd,
            If thou canſt ſcape from heauy greefe,
            true fredome ſhalt thou finde.
            Fortune can fill nothing,
            ſo full of hearty greefe,
            But in the ſame a conſtant mynd,
            Finds ſolace and releefe,
            Vertue is alwayes thrall,
            to troubles and annoye,
            But wiſdome in aduerſitie,
            findes cauſe of quiet ioye.
            And they moſt wretched are,
            that know no wretchednes:
            And afther great extremity,
            miſhaps ay waxen leſſe.
            Like as there is no weale,
            but waſtes away ſomtime,
            So euery kind of wayled woe,
            will weare away in time.
            If thou wilt maſter quite,
            the troubles that the ſpill,
            Endeuor firſt by reaſons help,
            to maſter witles will.
            A ſondry medſon hath,
            eche ſondry faynt diſeaſe,
            But pacience, a common ſalue,
            to euery wound geues eaſe.
            The world is alway full
            of chaunces and of chaunge,
            Wherfore the chaunge of chaunce muſt not
            ſeeme to a wiſe man ſtraunge.
            
               
For tickel Fortune doth,
            in chaunging but her kind:
            But all her chaunges cannot chaunge,
            a ſteady conſtant minde.
            Though wauering Fortune toorne
            from thee her ſmyling face,
            And ſorow ſeeke to ſet him ſelfe,
            in baniſhd pleaſures place,
            Yet may thy marred ſtate,
            be mended in a while,
            And ſhe eftſones that frowneth now,
            with pleaſant cheere ſhall ſmyle.
            For as her happy ſtate,
            no long whyle ſtandeth ſure,
            Euen ſo the heauy plight ſhe brings,
            not alwayes doth endure.
            What nede ſo many woordes,
            to thee that art ſo wyſe?
            Thou better canſt aduiſe thy ſelfe,
            then I can thee aduyſe.
            Wiſdome I ſee is vayne,
            if thus in time of neede,
            A wiſe mans wit vnpractiſed,
            doth ſtand him in no ſteede.
            I know thou haſt ſome cauſe,
            of ſorow and of care:
            But well I wot thou haſt no cauſe
            thus frantikly to fare.
            Affections foggy miſt,
            thy febled ſight doth blynde,
            But if that reaſons beames agayne,
            might ſhine into thy mynde:
            If thou wouldſt view thy ſtate
            with an indifferent eye,
            I thinke thou wouldſt condemne thy plaint,
            thy ſighing and thy crye.
            
               
With valiant hand thou madeſt
            thy foe yeld vp his breth,
            Thou haſt eſcapd his ſwerd, and eke
            the lawes that threatten death.
            By thy eſcape, thy frendes,
            are fraughted full of ioy,
            And by his death thy deadly foes
            are laden with annoy
            Wilt thou with truſty frendes,
            of pleaſure take ſome part?
            Or els to pleaſe thy hatefull foes,
            be partner of theyr ſmart?
            Why cryeſt thou out on loue,
            why doeſt thou blame thy fate?
            Why doſt thou ſo crye after death?
            thy life why doſt thou hate?
            Doſt thou repent the choyce.
            that thou ſo late didſt chooſe?
            Loue is thy Lord, thou oughteſt obay,
            and not thy prince accuſe.
            For thou haſt found (thou knowſt)
            great fauour in his ſight:
            He graunted thee at thy requeſt,
            thy onely hartes delight:
            So that the Gods enuyde
            the bliſſe thou liuedſt in,
            To geue to ſuch vnthankefull men,
            is folly and a ſin.
            He thinkes I heare thee ſay
            the cruell baniſhment,
            Is onely cauſe of thy vnreſt,
            onely thou doſt lament,
            That from thy natife land,
            and frendes thou muſt depart,
            Enforſd to flye from her that hath
            the keping of thy hart.
            
               
And ſo oppreſt with waight
            of ſmart that thou doſt feele,
            Thou doſt complaine of Cupides brand,
            and Fortunes turning wheele.
            Vnto a valiant hart,
            there is no baniſhment,
            All countreys are his natiue ſoyle
            beneath the firmament.
            As to the fiſhe, the ſea:
            as to the fowle, the ayre:
            So is like pleaſant to the wiſe,
            eche place of his repayre.
            Though froward Fortune chaſe
            thee hence into exyle:
            With doubled honor ſhall ſhe call
            thee home within a whyle.
            Admyt thou ſhouldſt abyde
            abrode a yere or twayne:
            Should ſo ſhort abſence cauſe ſo long,
            and eke ſo greeuous payne?
            Though thou ne mayſt thy frendes,
            here in Verona ſee,
            They are not baniſhd Mantua,
            where ſafely thou maſt be.
            Thether they may reſort,
            though thou reſort not hether,
            And there in ſuretie may you talke,
            of your affayres together.
            Yea, but this whyle (alas)
            thy Iuliet muſt thou miſſe,
            The onely piller of thy helth,
            and ancor of thy bliſſe.
            Thy hart thou leaueſt with her,
            when thou doſt hence depart:
            And in thy breſt incloſed bearſt,
            her tender frendly hart.
            
               
But if thou rew ſo much,
            to leaue the reſt behinde,
            With thought of paſſed ioyes, content
            thy vncontented mynde.
            So ſhall the mone decreaſe,
            wherwith thy mynd doth melt,
            Compared to the heauenly ioyes
            which thou haſt often felt.
            He is too nyſe a weakeling,
            that ſhrinketh at a ſhowre,
            And he vnworthy of the ſweete,
            that taſteth not the ſowre.
            Call now againe to mynde,
            thy firſt conſuming flame,
            How didſt thou vainely burne in loue
            of an vnlouing dame.
            Hadſt thou not welnigh wept,
            quite out thy ſwelling eyne:
            Did not thy parts fordoon with payne,
            languiſhe away and pyne?
            Thoſe greefes and others like,
            were happly ouerpaſt:
            And thou in haight of Fortunes wheele,
            well placed at the laſt:
            From whence thou art now falne,
            that rayſed vp agayne,
            With greater ioy a greater while
            in pleaſure mayſt thou raygne.
            Compare the preſent while,
            with times ypaſt before,
            And thinke that Fortune hath for thee,
            great pleaſure yet in ſtore.
            The whilſt, this little wrong,
            receiue thou paciently,
            And what of force muſt nedes be done,
            that doe thou willingly.
            
               
Foly it is to feare
            that thou canſt not auoyde
            And madnes to deſire it much,
            that can not be enioyde.
            To geue to Fortune place,
            not ay deſerueth blame:
            But ſkill it is, according to
            the times, thy ſelfe to frame.
            Whilſt to this ſkilfull lore;
            he lent his liſtning eares:
            His ſighes are ſtopt, and ſtopped are
            the conduits of his teares.
            As blackeſt cloudes are chaced,
            by winters nimble winde:
            So haue his reaſons chaced care,
            out of his carefull mynde.
            As of a morning fowle,
            enſues an euening fayre:
            So baniſht hope returneth home,
            to baniſh his deſpayre.
            Now is affections veale,
            remoued from his eyes.
            He ſeeth the path that he muſt walke,
            and reſon makes him wiſe.
            For very ſhame, the blood
            doth flaſhe in both his cheekes:
            He thankes the father for his lore,
            and farther ayde he ſeekes.
            He ſayth that ſkilles youth,
            for counſell is vnfitte,
            And anger oft with haſtines
            are ioind to want of witte.
            But ſound aduiſe aboundes
            in heddes with horiſhe heares:
            For wiſdom is by practiſe wonne,
            and perfect made by yeares.
            
               
But aye from this time forth,
            his ready bending will:
            Shalbe in awe, and gouerned,
            by fryer Lawrence ſkill.
            The gouernor is nowe,
            right carefull of his charge:
            To whom he doth wiſely diſcoorſe,
            of his affaires at large.
            He telles him how he ſhall,
            depart the towne vnknowne,
            Both mindfull of his frendes ſafetie,
            and carefull of his owne.
            How he ſhall gyde him ſelfe,
            how he ſhall ſeeke to winne,
            The frendſhip of the better ſort,
            how warely to crepe in
            The fauour of the Mantuan prince:
            and how he may
            Appeaſe the wrath of Eſcalus:
            and wipe the fault away.
            The choller of his foes,
            by gentle meanes taſſwage:
            Or els by force and practiſes,
            to bridle quite theyr rage.
            And laſt he chargeth him,
            at his appointed howre,
            To goe with manly mery cheere,
            vnto his ladies bowre.
            And there with hole ſome woordes,
            to ſalue her ſorowes ſmart:
            And to reuiue, (if nede require,
            her faint and dying hart.
            The old mans woords haue fild
            with ioy, our Romeus breſt:
            And eke the olde wiues talke, hath ſet
            our Iuliets hart at reſt.
            
               
Whereto may I compare,
            (O louers) this your day?
            Like dayes the painefull mariners,
            are woonted to aſſay.
            For beat with tempeſt great,
            when they at length, eſpye
            Some little beame of Phoebus light,
            that perceth through the ſkie,
            To cleare the ſhadowde earth,
            by clearenes of his face:
            They hope that dreadles, they ſhall ronne
            the remnant of their race.
            Yea, they aſſure them ſelfe:
            and quite behynd theyr backe,
            They caſt all doute, and thanke the Gods
            for ſcraping of the wracke.
            But ſtraight the boyſterous windes,
            with greater fury blowe,
            And ouer boord the broken maſt.
            the ſtormy blaſtes doe throwe.
            The heauens large, are clad
            with cloudes, as darke as hell:
            And twiſe as hye, the ſtriuing waues
            begin to roare, and ſwell.
            With greater daungers dred,
            the men are vexed more:
            In greater perill of their lyfe,
            then they had been before.
            The golden ſonne, was gonne
            to lodge him in the weſt:
            The full moone eke in yonder South,
            had ſent moſt men to reſt:
            When reſtles Romeus,
            and reſtles Iuliet,
            In woonted ſort, by woonted meane,
            in Iuliets chaumber met.
            
               
And from the windowes top,
            downe had he leaped ſcarce,
            When ſhe with armes outſtretched wide,
            ſo hard did him embrace,
            That welnigh had the ſprite
            (not forced by dedly force)
            Flowne vnto death, before the time
            abandoning the corce.
            Thus muet ſtoode they both,
            the eight part of an howre
            And both would ſpeake, but neither had
            of ſpeaking any powre.
            But on his breſt her hed
            doth ioyleſſe Iuliet lay,
            And on her ſlender necke, his chyn
            doth ruthfull Romeus ſtay.
            Their ſcalding ſighes aſcende,
            and by their cheekes dowue fall,
            Their trickling teares, as chriſtall cleare,
            but bitterer farre then gall.
            Then he to end the greefe,
            which both they liued in,
            Did kyſſe his loue, and wiſely thus
            hys tale he dyd begin.
            My Iuliet, my loue,
            my onely hope and care:
            To you I purpoſe not as now,
            with length of woords declare,
            The diuerſenes, and eke
            the accidents ſo ſtraunge,
            Of frayle vnconſtant Fortune, that
            delyteth ſtill in chaunge.
            Who in a moment heaues
            her frendes vp to the height,
            Of her ſwift turning ſlippery wheele,
            then fleetes her frendſhip ſtraight,
            
               
O wondrous chaunge, euen with
            the twinkling of an eye,
            Whom erſt her ſelfe had raſhly ſet,
            in pleaſant place ſo hye?
            The ſame in great deſpyte,
            downe hedlong doth ſhe throwe:
            And while ſhe treades and ſpurneth at
            the lofty ſtate laid lowe,
            More ſorow doth ſhe ſhape
            within an howers ſpace,
            Then pleaſure in an hundred yeres:
            ſo geyſon is her grace.
            The proofe wherof in me
            (alas) too plaine apperes,
            Whom tenderly my carefull frendes
            haue foſtered with my feers,
            In proſperous high degree:
            mayntayned ſo by fate,
            That (as your ſelfe did ſee) my foes
            enuyde my noble ſtate.
            One thing there was, I did
            aboue the reſt deſire,
            To which, as to the ſoueraigne good,
            by hope I would aſpyre:
            Thol by our mariage meane,
            we might within a while,
            (To woorke our perfect happines)
            our parentes reconſile.
            That ſafely ſo we might
            (not ſtopt by ſturdy ſtrife)
            Vnto the boundes that God hath ſet,
            gyde forth our pleaſant lyfe.
            But now (alacke) too ſoone
            my bliſſe is ouerblowne,
            And vpſide downe my purpoſe and
            my enterpriſe are throwne,
            
               
And driuen from my frendes,
            of ſtraungers muſt I craue,
            (O graunt it God) from daungers dread,
            that I may ſuertie haue.
            For loe, henceforth I muſt,
            wander in landes vnknowne:
            (So hard I finde the princes doome,)
            exyled from mine owne.
            Which thing I haue thought good,
            to ſet before your eyes:
            And to exhort you, now to proue
            your ſelfe a woman wiſe.
            That paciently, you beare
            my abſent long abod.
            For, what aboue by fatall doomes
            decreed is that God,
            And more then this, to ſay
            it ſeemed he was bent,
            But Iuliet, in dedly greefe,
            with brackiſh teares beſprent,
            Brake of his tale begonne,
            and whilſt his ſpeche he ſtayde,
            Theſe ſelfe ſame wordes, or like to theſe,
            with dreery chere ſhe ſayde.
            Why Romeus, can it be,
            thou haſt ſo hard a hart?
            So farre remoued from ruth? ſo farre
            from thinking on my ſmart?
            To leaue me thus alone?
            (thou cauſe of my diſtreſſe)
            Beſeged with ſo great a campe,
            of mortall wretchedneſſe,
            That euery hower now,
            and moment in a day,
            A thouſand times, death bragges, as he
            would reaue my life away.
            
               
Yet ſuch is my miſhap,
            (O cruell deſtenye)
            That ſtill I liue, and wiſh for death,
            but yet can neuer dye.
            So that iuſt cauſe I haue,
            to thinke (as ſeemeth me)
            That froward Fortune did of late,
            with cruell death agree
            To lengthen lothed life,
            to pleaſure in my payne,
            And tryumph in my harme, as in
            the greateſt hoped gayne.
            And thou the inſtrument
            of Fortunes cruell will,
            Without whoſe ayde ſhe can no way,
            her tyrans luſt fulfill:
            Art not a whit aſhamde,
            (as farre as I can ſee)
            To caſt me of, when thou haſt culd
            the better part of me.
            Wherby (alas) to ſoone,
            I ſeely wretch do proue,
            That all the auncient ſacred lawes,
            of frendſhip and of loue,
            Are quelde and quenched quite.
            ſince he on whom alway,
            My cheefe hope, and my ſteady truſt,
            was wonted ſtill to ſtay,
            For whom I am becomme,
            vnto my ſelfe a foe:
            Diſdayneth me his ſtedfaſt frend,
            and ſcornes my frendſhip ſo.
            Nay Romeus, nay, thou mayſt
            of two thinges chooſe the one:
            Either to ſee thy caſtaway
            as ſoone as thou art gone,
            
               
Hedlong to throw her ſelfe
            downe from the windowes haight,
            And ſo to breake her ſiender necke,
            with all the bodies waight.
            Or ſuffer her to be
            companion of thy payne,
            Where ſo thou goe (Fortune thee gyde)
            till thou retoorne agayne.
            So wholy into thine,
            tranſformed is my hart,
            That euen as oft as I do thinke
            that thou and I ſhall part:
            So oft (me thinkes) my life
            withdrawes it ſelfe awaye,
            Which I retayne, to no end els,
            but to the end I may
            In ſpite of all thy foes,
            thy preſent partes enioye,
            And in diſtres to beare with thee,
            the halfe of thine annoye.
            Wherfore in humble ſort
            (Romeus) I make requeſt,
            If euer tender pity yet,
            were lodgde in gentle breſt,
            O let it now haue place,
            to reſt within thy hart,
            Receaue me as thy ſeruant, and
            the fellow of thy ſmart.
            Thy abſence is my death,
            thy ſight ſhall geue me life.
            But if perhaps thou ſtand in dred,
            to leade me as a wyfe,
            Art thou all counſelleſſe,
            canſt thou no ſhift deuiſe?
            What letteth, but in other weede
            I may my ſelfe diſguyſe.
            
               
What, ſhall I he the firſt?
            hath none done ſo ere this?
            To ſcape the bondage of theyr frendes?
            thy ſelfe can aunſwer yes.
            Or doſt thou ſtand in doute,
            that I thy wife ne can,
            By ſeruice pleaſure thee as much,
            as may thy hyred man?
            Or is my loyalte
            of both accompted leſſe?
            Perhaps thou fearſt leſt I for gayne,
            forſake thee in diſtreſſe.
            What,hath my bewty now,
            no powre at all on you?
            Whoſe brightnes, force, and praiſe ſomtime,
            vp to the ſkyes you blew?
            My teares, my frendſhip, and
            my pleaſures donne of olde:
            Shall they be quite forgote in dede?
            when Romeus dyd behold
            The wildnes of her looke,
            her cooler pale and ded,
            The woorſt of all that might betyde
            to her, he gan to dred.
            And once agayne he dyd
            in armes his Iuliet take:
            And kiſt her with a louing kyſſe,
            And thus to her he ſpake.
            Ah Iuliet (quoth he)
            the miſtres of my hart,
            For whom (euen now) thy ſeruant doth
            abyde in dedly ſmart,
            Euen for the happy dayes
            which thou deſyreſt to ſee,
            And for the feruent frendſhips ſake
            that thou doſt owe to me:
            
               
At once theſe fanſies vayne,
            out of thy mynd roote out,
            Except perhaps vnto thy blame,
            thou fondly go about
            To haſten forth my death,
            and to thine owne to ronne:
            Which Natures law, and wiſdoms lore
            teache euery wight to ſhonne.
            For, but thou chaunge thy mynde,
            (I do foretell the ende)
            Thou ſhalt vndoo thy ſelfe for ay,
            and me thy truſty frende.
            For why, thy abſence knowne,
            thy father wilbe wroth,
            And in his rage, ſo narowly
            he will purſue vs both:
            That we ſhall trye in vayne,
            to ſcape away by flight,
            And vainely ſeeke a loorking place,
            to hyde vs from his ſight.
            Then we found out, and caught,
            quite voyde of ſtrong defence
            Shall cruelly be puniſhed,
            for thy departure hence.
            I, as a rauiſhor,
            thou, as a careles childe,
            I, as a man who doth defile,
            thou, as a mayde defilde.
            Thinking to leade in eaſe,
            a long contented life,
            Shall ſhort our dayes by ſhamefull death.
            but (if my louing wife)
            Thou baniſh from thy mynde,
            two foes that counſell hath:
            (That wont to hinder ſound aduiſe)
            raſhe haſtines, and wrath:
            
               
If thou be bend to bay
            the lore of reaſons ſkill,
            And wiſely by her princely powre
            ſuppreſſe rebelling will:
            If thou our ſafetie ſeeke,
            more then thine owne delight,
            Since ſuerty ſtandes in parting, and
            thy pleaſures growe of ſight:
            For heare the cauſe of ioy,
            and ſuffer for a while,
            So ſhall I ſafely liue abrode,
            and ſafe torne from exile.
            So ſhall no ſlaunders blot,
            thy ſpotles life deſtayne,
            So ſhall thy kinſmen be vnſtyrd,
            and I exempt from payne.
            And thinke thou not that aye,
            the cauſe of care ſhall laſt,
            Theſe ſtormy broyles ſhall ouerblow,
            much like a winters blaſt.
            For Fortune chaungeth more,
            then fickel fantaſie,
            In nothing Fortune conſtant is,
            ſaue in vnconſtancie.
            Her haſty ronning wheele,
            is of a reſtles coorſe,
            That turnes the clymers hedlong downe,
            from better to the woorſe.
            And thoſe that are beneth,
            ſhe heaueth vp agayne,
            So we ſhall riſe to pleaſures mount,
            out of the pit of payne.
            Ere fowre monthes ouerpaſſe,
            ſuch order will I take,
            And by my letters, and my frendes,
            ſuch meanes I mynd to make,
            
               
That of my wandring race,
            ended ſhalbe the royle,
            And I cald home with honor great,
            vnto my natiue ſoyle.
            But if I be condemd
            to wander ſtill in thrall,
            I will returne to you (mine owne)
            befall what may befall.
            And then by ſtrength of frendes,
            and with a mighty hand,
            From Verone will I cary thee,
            into a forein lande.
            Not in mans weede diſguiſd,
            or as one ſcarcely knowne,
            But as my wife and onely feere,
            in garment of thyne owne.
            Wherfore repreſſe at once,
            the paſſions of thy hart,
            And where there is no cauſe of greefe,
            cauſe hope to heale thy ſmart.
            For of this one thing thou
            mayſt well aſſured bee:
            That nothing els but onely death
            ſhall ſunder me from thee.
            The reaſons that he made,
            did ſeeme of ſo great waight,
            And had with her ſuch force: that ſhe
            to him gan aunſwer ſtraight.
            Deere ſyr, nought els wiſh I,
            but to obay your will:
            But ſure where ſo you go, your hart
            with me ſhall tary ſtill,
            As ſigne and certaine pledge,
            tyll here I ſhall you ſee:
            Of all the powre that ouer you
            your ſelfe did graunt to me.
            
               
And in hip ſtead take myne,
            the gage of my good will:
            One promeſſe craue I at your hand,
            that graunt me to fulfill.
            Fayle not to let me haue
            at fryer Lawrence hand,
            The tydinges of your health, and how
            your doutfull caſe ſhall ſtand.
            And all the wery while
            that you ſhall ſpend abrode:
            Cauſe me from time to time to knowe
            the place of your abode.
            His eyes did guſhe out teares,
            a ſigh brake from his breſt,
            When he did graunt, and with an othe
            did vowe to kepe the heſt.
            Thus theſe two louers paſſe
            away the wery night,
            In payne and plaint, not (as they wont)
            in pleaſure and delight.
            But now (ſomewhat too ſoone)
            in fartheſt Eaſt aroſe
            Fayre Lucifer, the golden ſtarre,
            that Lady Venus choſe.
            Whoſe courſe appoynted is,
            with ſpedy race to ronne,
            A meſſenger of dawning daye,
            and of the ryſing ſonne.
            Then freſhe Aurora, with
            her paie and ſiluer glade
            Did clear the ſkyes, and from the earth,
            had chaſed ougly ſhade.
            When thou ne lookeſt wide,
            ne cloſely doſt thou winke,
            When Phoebus from our hemyſphere,
            in weſterne waue doth ſinke.
            
               
What cooller then the heauens
            do ſhew vnto thine eyes:
            The ſame, (or like) ſaw Romeus
            in fartheſt Eſterne ſkyes.
            As yet, he ſaw no day:
            ne could he call it night,
            With equall force, decreaſing darke,
            fought with increaſing light.
            Then Romeus in armes
            his lady gan to folde,
            With frendly kiſſe and ruthfully
            ſhe gan her knight beholde.
            With ſolemne othe they both▪
            
            theyr ſorowfull leaue do take,
            They ſweare no ſtormy troubles ſhall
            theyr ſteady frendſhip ſhake.
            Then carefull Romeus,
            agayne to cell retoornes,
            And in her chamber ſecretly
            our ioyles Iuliet moornes.
            Now hugycloudes of care,
            of ſorow and of dread,
            The clearnes of their gladſome harts
            hath wholy ouerſpread.
            When golden creſted Phoebus
            boſteth him in ſkye,
            And vnder earth, to ſcape reuenge,
            his dedly foe doth flye:
            Then hath theſe louers day
            an ende, their night begonne,
            For eche of them to other is,
            as to the world, the ſunne.
            The dawning they ſhall ſee,
            ne ſommer any more,
            But blackfaced night with winter rough,
            (ah) beaten ouer ſore.
            
               
The wery watch diſcharged,
            did hye them home to ſlepe,
            The warders, and the ſkowtes were chargd▪
            
            theyr place and coorſe to keepe.
            And Verone gates a wyde,
            the porters had ſet open,
            When Romeus had of his affayres
            with frier Lawrence ſpoken:
            Warely he walked forth,
            vnknowne of frend or foe:
            Clad like a merchant venterer,
            from top euen to the toe.
            He ſpurd apace and came
            withouten ſtop or ſtay,
            To Mantua gates, where lighted downe,
            he ſent his man away.
            With woords of comfort, to
            his olde afflicted fyre:
            And ſtraight in mynd to ſoiorne there,
            a lodgeing doth he hyre.
            And with the nobler ſort
            he doth himſelfe acquaint,
            And of his open wrong receaued,
            the Duke doth heare his plaint.
            He practiſeth by frendes,
            for pardon of 
                  ••
               yle,
            The whilſt, he ſeeketh euery way,
            his ſorowes to begyle.
            But who forgets the cole
            that burneth in his breſt?
            Alas his cares, denye his hart,
            the ſweete deſyred reſt.
            No time findes he of myrth,
            he findes no place of ioye,
            But euery thing occaſion geues,
            of ſorow and annoye.
            
               
For when in toorning ſkyes,
            the heauens lampes are light,
            And from the other hemyſphere,
            fayre Phoebus chaceth night,
            When euery man and beaſt,
            hath reſt from painfull toyle,
            Then in the breſt of Romeus,
            his paſſions gyn to boyle.
            Then doth he wet with teares,
            the cowche wheron he lyes,
            And then his ſighes the chamber fill,
            and out aloude he cryes
            Againſt the reſtles ſtarres,
            in rolling ſkyes that raunge,
            Againſt the fatall ſiſters three,
            and Fortune full of chaunge.
            Eche night a thouſand times
            he calleth for the day,
            He thinketh Titans reſtles ſtedes,
            of reſtines do ſtay.
            Or that at length they haue
            ſome 
                  •
               ay
                  •
               ing place found out,
            Or (gyded yll) haue loſt theyr way
            and wandred farre about.
            Whyle thus in ydel thoughts,
            the wery time he ſpendeth,
            The night hath end, but not with night▪
            
            the plaint of night be endeth.
            Is he accompanied,
            is he in place alone?
            In cumpany he wayles his harme,
            a part be maketh mone.
            For if his feeres reioyce,
            what cauſe hath he to ioy,
            That wanteth ſtill his cheefe delight,
            while they theyr loues enioy▪
            
            
               
But if with heauy cheere,
            they ſhewe their inward greefe,
            He wayleth moſt his wretchednes,
            that is of wretches cheefe.
            When he doth heare abrode,
            the praiſe of ladies blowne.
            Within his thought he ſcorneth them
            and doth preferre his owne.
            When pleaſant ſonges he beares
            When others do reioyce
            The melody of Muſike doth
            ſtyrre vp his mourning voyce.
            But if in ſecret place
            he walke ſome where alone,
            The place it ſelfe, and ſecretnes
            redoubleth all his mone.
            Then ſpeakes he to the beaſtes
            to fethered fowles, and trees,
            Vnto the earth, the cloudes, and to
            what ſo beſide he ſees.
            To them he ſhewth his ſmart,
            as though they reaſon had,
            Eche thing may cauſe his heauines▪
            
            but nought may make him glad.
            And (wery of the day)
            agayne he calleth night,
            The ſunne he curſeth, and the howre,
            when fyrſt his eyes ſaw light.
            And as the night, and day,
            their courſe do enterchaunge:
            So doth our Romeus nightly cares,
            for cares of day exchaunge.
            In abſence of her knight,
            the lady no way could
            Kepe trewe betwene her greefes and her,
            though nere ſo fayne ſhe would.
            
               
And though with greater payne
            ſhe cloked ſorowes ſmart:
            Yet did her paled face diſcloſe
            the paſſions of her hart.
            Her ſighing euery howre,
            her weping euery where,
            Her recheles heede of meate, of ſlepe,
            and wearing of her geare:
            The carefull mother markes.
            then of her health afrayde,
            Becauſe the greefes increaſed ſtill.
            thus to her child ſhe ſayde.
            Deere daughter, if you ſhoulde
            long languiſhe in this ſort,
            I ſtand in doute that ouer ſoone
            your ſorowes▪ will make ſhort
            Your louing fathers life,
            and myne, that loue you more
            Then our owne propre breth, and life.
            Brydel hence forth therfore
            Your greefe, and payne your ſelfe
            on ioy your thought to ſet,
            For time it is that now you ſhould
            our Tybalts death forget.
            Of whom, ſince God hath claymd
            the lyfe, that was but lent,
            He is in bliſſe, ne is there cauſe
            why you ſhould thus lament▪
            
            You can not call him backe
            with teares, and ſhrikinges ſhrill:
            It is a falt thus ſtill to grudge
            at Gods appoynted will.
            The ſeely ſoule had now
            no longer powre to fayne,
            Ne longer could ſhe hyde her harme:
            but aunſwerd thus agayne.
            
               
With heauy broken ſighes,
            with viſage pale and ded
            Madame, the laſt of Tybalts teares,
            a great while ſince I ſhed.
            Whoſe ſpring hath been ere this
            ſo laded out by me,
            That empty quite, and moyſtureles,
            I geſſe it now to be.
            So that my payned hart
            by canduites of the eyne,
            No more henceforth (as wont it was)
            ſhall guſh forth dropping bryne.
            The wofull mother knew
            not, what her daughter ment,
            And loth to vexe her childe by woordes,
            her peace ſhe warely hent.
            But when from howre to howre,
            from morow to the morow,
            Still more and more ſhe ſaw increaſt
            her daughters wonted ſorow.
            All meanes ſhe ſought of her,
            and howſhold folke, to know
            The certaine roote, whereon her greefe,
            and booteles mone doth growe.
            But lo, ſhe hath in vayne,
            her time, and labor lore,
            Wherfore without all meaſure, is
            her hart tormented ſore.
            And ſith her ſelfe could not
            fynd out the cauſe of care:
            She thought it good to tell the ſyre,
            how yll his childe did fare.
            And when ſhe ſaw her time,
            thus to her feere ſhe ſayde:
            Syr, if you marke our daughter well,
            the countenance of the mayde,
            
               
And how ſhe fareth, ſince
            that Tybalt vnto death,
            (Before his time, forſt by his foe)
            dyd yeld his liuing breath.
            Her face ſhall ſeeme ſo chaunged,
            her doynges eke ſo ſtraunge,
            That you will greatly wonder at,
            ſo great and ſodain chaunge.
            Not onely ſhe forbeares,
            her meate, her drinke, and ſleepe,
            But now ſhe tendeth nothing els
            but to lament and weepe.
            No greater ioy hath ſhe,
            nothing contentes her hart
            So much, as in her chaumber, cloſe
            to ſhut her ſelfe apart.
            Where ſhe doth ſo torment
            her poore afflicted mynde,
            That much in daunger ſtandes her lyfe,
            except ſomme helpe we fynde.
            But (out alas) I ſee not
            how it may be founde:
            Vnleſſe that fyrſt, we might fynd, whence
            her ſorowes thus abounde.
            For though with buſy care,
            I haue employde my wit,
            And vſed all the wayes I knew,
            to learne the truth of it:
            Neither extremitie,
            ne gentle meanes could boote.
            She hydeth cloſe within her breſt,
            her ſecret ſorowes roote.
            This was my fyrſt conceite,
            that all her ruth aroſe
            Out of her coofin Tybalts death,
            late ſlayne of dedly foes.
            
               
But now my hart doth hold
            a new repugnant thought,
            Some greater thing, not Tybalts death
            this chaunge in her hath wrought.
            Her ſelfe aſſured me,
            that many dayes a goe,
            She ſhed the laſt of Tybalts teares,
            which woord amald me ſo,
            That I then could not geſſe
            what thing els might her greene,
            But now at length I haue bethought
            me. And I doe beleue
            The onely crop and roote
            of all my daughters payne,
            Is grudgeing enuies faynt diſeaſe,
            perhaps ſhe doth diſdayne
            To ſee in wedlocke yoke
            the moſt part of her feeres,
            Whilſt onely ſhe vnmaried,
            doth loſe ſo many yeres.
            And more perchaunce ſhe thinkes
            you mynd to kepe her ſo,
            Wherfore diſpayring doth ſhe weare
            her ſelfe away with woe.
            Therfore (deere ſyr) in time,
            take on your daughter ruth,
            For why, a brickel thing is glaſſe,
            and frayle is fraylleſſe youth.
            Ioyne her at once to ſomme,
            in linke of mariage,
            That may be meete for our degree,
            and much about her age.
            So ſhall you baniſh care
            out of your daughters breſt:
            So we her parentes in our age,
            ſhall liue in quiet reſt.
            
               
Wherto gan eaſely
            her huſband to agree,
            And to the mothers ſkilfull talke,
            thus ſtraight way aunſwerd he.
            Oft haue I thought (deere wife)
            of all theſe thinges ere this,
            But euermore my mynd me gaue,
            it ſhould not be amiſſe,
            By farther leyſure had,
            a huſband to prouyde,
            Scarce ſaw ſhe yet full .xvi. yeres:
            too yong to be a bryde.
            But ſince her ſtate doth ſtande
            on termes ſo perilous,
            And that a mayden daughter is
            a treaſour daungerous:
            With ſo great ſpeede I will
            endeuour to procure
            A huſband for our daughter yong,
            her ſickenes faynt to cure.
            That you ſhall reſt content,
            (ſo warely will I chooſe)
            And ſhe recouer ſoone enough
            the time ſhe ſeemes to looſe.
            The whilſt, ſeeke you to learne,
            if ſhe in any part,
            Already hath (vnware to vs)
            fixed her frendly hart.
            Leſt we haue more reſpect
            to honor and to welth,
            Then to our doughters quiet life,
            and to her happy helth.
            Whom I do hold as deere,
            as thapple of myne eye,
            And rather with in poore eſtate,
            and daughterles to dye:
            
               
Then leaue my goodes and her
            ythrald to ſuch a one,
            Whoſe chorliſh dealing (I once dead)
            ſhould be her cauſe of mone.
            This pleaſant aunſwere heard,
            the lady partes agayne.
            And Capilet the maydens ſire,
            within a day or twayne,
            Conferreth with his frendes,
            for mariage of his daughter,
            And many gentlemen there were,
            with buſy care that ſought her.
            Both for the mayden was
            well ſhaped, yong, and fayre,
            As alſo well brought vp, and wiſe,
            her fathers onely heyre.
            Emong the reſt was one
            inflamde with her deſire,
            Who, County Paris cliped was,
            an Earle he had to ſyre.
            Of all the futers, him
            the father liketh beſt,
            And eaſely vnto the Earle
            he maketh his beheſt.
            Both of his owne good will,
            and of his frendly ayde,
            To win his wife vnto his will,
            and to perſwade the mayde.
            The wife did ioy to heare
            the ioyfull huſband ſay,
            How happy hap, how meete a match,
            he had found out that day.
            He did ſhe ſeeke to hyde
            her ioyes within her hart,
            But ſtraight ſhe hyeth to Iuliet,
            to her ſhe telles apart,
            
               
What happy talke (by meane
            of her) was paſt no rather
            Betwene the woing Paris, and
            her carefull louing father.
            The perſon of the man,
            the fewters of his face,
            His youthfull yeres, his fayrenes, and
            his port and ſemely grace.
            With curious wordes ſhe payntes
            before her daughters eyes,
            And then with ſtore of vertues prayſe,
            ſhe heaues him to the ſkyes.
            She vauntes his race, and gyftes,
            that Fortune did him geue:
            Wherby (ſhe ſaith) both ſhe and hers,
            in great delight ſhall liue.
            When Iuliet conceiued
            her parentes whole entent,
            Wherto, both loue, and reaſons right,
            forbod her to aſſent:
            Within her ſelfe ſhe thought,
            rather then be forſworne,
            With horſes wilde, her tender partes
            a ſonder ſhould be torne.
            Not now with baſhfull brow
            (in wonted wiſe) ſhe ſpake,
            But with vnwonted boldnes, ſtraight
            into theſe woordes ſhe brake.
            Madame, I maruell much,
            that you ſo lauaſſe are,
            Of me your childe, (your iewel once,
            your onely ioy and care.)
            As thus to yelde me vp,
            at pleaſure of another,
            Before you know if I doe like,
            or els miſlike my louer.
            
               
Doo what you liſt, but yet
            of this aſſure you ſtill,
            If you do as you ſay you will,
            I yelde not there vntill.
            For had I choyſe of twayne,
            farre rather would I chooſe,
            My part of all your goodes, and eke
            my breath and lyfe to loſe:
            Then graunt that he poſſeſſe
            of me the ſmalleſt part.
            Firſt, weary of my painefull life,
            my cares ſhall kill my hart.
            Els will I perce my breſt,
            with ſharpe and bloody knife,
            And you my mother ſhall becomme
            the murdreſſe of my life:
            In geuing me to him,
            whom I ne can ne may,
            Ne ought to loue. Wherfore on knees,
            deere mother I you pray
            To let me liue henceforth,
            as I haue liued tofore:
            Ceaſſe all your troubles for my ſake,
            and care for me no more.
            But ſuffer Fortune feerce,
            to worke on me her will,
            In her it lyeth to doe me boote,
            in her it lyeth to ſpill.
            For whilſt you for the beſt,
            deſyre to place me ſo,
            You haſt a way my lingring death,
            and double all my woe.
            So deepe this aunſwere made
            the ſorowes downe to ſinke,
            Into the mothers breſt: that ſhe
            ne knoweth what to thinke.
            
               
Of theſe her daughters woords.
            but all appalde ſhe ſtandes,
            And vp vnto the heauens ſhe throwes
            her wondring head and handes.
            And nigh beſyde her ſelfe
            her huſband hath ſhe ſought,
            She telles him all, ſhe doth forget
            ne yet ſhe hydeth ought.
            The teſty old man wroth,
            diſdainfull without meaſure,
            Sendes forth his folke in haſte for her.
            and byds them take no leyſure.
            Ne on her teares or plaint,
            at all to haue remorſe,
            But (if they can not with her will,)
            to bring the mayde perforce.
            The meſſage heard, they part,
            to fetch that they muſt fet:
            And willingly with them walkes forth
            obedient Iuliet.
            Arriued in the place,
            when ſhe her father ſaw,
            Of whom (as much as duety would)
            the daughter ſtoode in awe.
            The ſeruantes ſent away,
            (the mother thought it meete)
            The wofull daughter all be wept,
            fell groueling at his feete.
            Which ſhe doth waſhe with teares
            as ſhe thus groueling lyes:
            So faſt and eke ſo plenteouſly
            diſtill they from her eyes.
            When ſhe to call for grace
            her mouth doth think to open,
            Muſt ſhe is: for ſighes and ſobs
            her fearefull talke haue broken.
            
               
The ſyre, whoſe ſwelling worth
            her teares could not aſſwage,
            With fiery eyen, and ſkarlet cheekes,
            thus ſpake her in his rage.
            Whilſt ruthfully ſtood by
            the maydens mother mylde,
            Liſten (quoth he) vnthankfull and
            thou diſobedient childe.
            Haſt thou ſo ſoone let ſlip
            out of thy mynde the woord,
            That thou ſo often times haſt heard
            rehearſed at my boord?
            How much the Romayne youth
            of parentes ſtood in awe,
            And eke what powre vpon theyr ſeede
            the fathers had by lawe?
            Whom they not onely might
            pledge, alienate, and ſell,
            (When ſo they ſtoode in neede) but more
            if children did rebell,
            The parentes had the power,
            of lyfe and ſodayn death.
            What if thoſe goodmen ſhould agayne
            receaue the liuyng breth?
            In how ſtraight bondes would they
            thy ſtubberne body bynde:
            What weapons would they ſeeke for thee?
            what tormentes would they fynde?
            To chaſten (if they ſaw)
            the lewdnes of thy lyfe,
            Thy great vnthankfulnes to me,
            and ſhamefull ſturdy ſtrife?
            Such care thy mother had,
            ſo deere then wert to me,
            That I with long and earneſt 
                  •
               ute,
            prouided haue for thee.
            
               
One of the greateſt lordes,
            that wonnes about this towne,
            And for his many vertues ſake,
            a man of great renowne.
            Of whom, both thou and I,
            vnworthy are too much,
            So riche ere long he ſhalbe left,
            his fathers welth is ſuch.
            Such is the noblenes,
            and honor of the race,
            From whence his father came, and yet
            thou playeſt in this caſe,
            The dainty foole, and ſtubberne
            gyrle, for want of ſkill,
            Thou doſt refuſe thy offred weale,
            and diſobay my will.
            Euen by his ſtrength I ſweare,
            that fyrſt did geue me lyfe
            And gaue me in my youth the ſtrength
            to get thee on my wyfe.
            On leſſe by wenſday next,
            thou bende as I am bent,
            And at our caſtle cald free towne,
            thou freely doe aſſent
            To Counte Paris ſute,
            and promiſe to agree
            To whatſoeuer then ſhall paſſe,
            twixt him, my wife, and me.
            Not onely will I geue
            all that I haue away,
            From thee, to thoſe that ſhall me loue,
            me honor, and obay:
            But alſo too ſo cloſe,
            and to ſo hard a gayle,
            I ſhall thee wed for all thy life,
            that ſure thou ſhalt not fayle.
            
               
A thouſand times a day
            to wiſhe for ſodayn death:
            And curſe the day, and howre when firſt
            thy lunges did geue thee breath.
            Aduiſe thee well, and ſay
            that thou art warned now,
            And thinke not that I ſpeake in ſport,
            or mynd to breake my vowe.
            For were it not that I
            to Counte Paris gaue
            My fayth, which I muſt kepe vnfalſt,
            my honor ſo to ſaue:
            Ere thou goe hence, my ſelfe
            would ſee thee chaſtned ſo,
            That thou ſhouldſt once for all be taught,
            thy duetie how to knowe
            And what reuenge of olde,
            the angry ſyres did finde
            Againſt theyr children that rebeld,
            and ſhewd them ſelfe vnkinde.
            Theſe ſayd, the olde man ſtraight.
            is gone in haſt a way.
            Ne for his daughters imſwere▪ would
            the teſty father ſtay.
            And after him, his wife
            doth follow out of doore,
            And there they leaue theyr chidden chylde.
            kneeling vpon the floore.
            Then ſhe that oft had ſeene
            the fury of her ſyre,
            Dreading what might come of his rage,
            nould farther ſtyrre his yre.
            Vnto her chamber ſhe
            withdrew her ſelfe aparte,
            Where ſhe was wonted to vnlode,
            the ſorowes of her hart.
            
               
There did ſhe not ſo much
            buſy her eyes in ſleping,
            As ouerpreſt with reſtles thoughts
            in piteous booteles weping.
            The faſt falling of teares
            make not her teares decreaſe,
            Ne by the powring forth of plaint,
            the cauſe of plaint doth ceaſe.
            So that to thend the mone
            and ſorow may decaye,
            The beſt is that ſhe ſeeke ſome meane
            to take the cauſe away.
            Her wery bed betime
            the wofull wight forſakes,
            And to ſainct Frauncis church to maſſe
            her way deuoutly takes.
            The fryer forth is calde,
            ſhe prayes him heare her ſhrift:
            Deuocion is in ſo yong yeres,
            a rare and precious gyft.
            When in her tender knees
            the dainty lady kneeles,
            In minde to powre forth all the greefe,
            that inwardly ſhe feeles.
            With ſighes and ſalted teares
            her ſhryuing doth beginne,
            Forſhe of heaped ſorowes hath
            to ſpeake, and not of ſinne.
            Her voyce with piteous plaint
            was made already horce,
            And haſty ſobs, when ſhe would ſpeake,
            brake of her woordes parforce.
            But as ſhe may peece meale,
            ſhe powreth in his lappe,
            The mariage newes, a miſchief newe,
            prepared by miſhappe.
            
               
Her parentes promiſſe erſt
            to Counte Paris paſt,
            Her fathers threats ſhe telleth him,
            and thus concludes at laſt.
            Once was I wedded well,
            ne will I wed agayne,
            For ſince I know I may not be
            the wedded wyfe of twayne,
            For I am bound to haue
            one God, ene fayth, one make,
            My purpoſe is as ſoone as I
            ſhall hence my iorney take
            With theſe two handes which ioynde
            vnto the heauens I ſtretch,
            The haſty death which I deſire
            vnto my ſelfe to reache.
            This day (O Romeus)
            this day thy wofull wife
            Will 
                  〈◊〉
                the end of all her eares
            by ending carefull lyfe.
            So my departed ſprite
            ſhall witnes to the ſkye,
            And eke my blood vnto the earth
            beare record how that I
            Haue kept my fayth vnbroke,
            ſtedfaſt vnto my frende,
            When this her heauy tale was tolde
            her vowe eke at an ende,
            Her gaſing here and there,
            her feerce and ſtaring looke,
            Did witnes that ſome lewd attempt,
            her hart had vndertooke.
            Whereat, the fryer affonde,
            and gaftfully afrayde,
            Leſt ſhe by dede perfourme her woord,
            thus much to her he ſayde.
            
               
Ah lady Iuliet,
            what nede the wordes you ſpake▪
            
            I pray you graunt me one requeſt
            for bleſſed Maries ſake.
            Meaſure ſomewhat your greefe,
            holde here a while your peace,
            Whilſt I bethinke me of your caſe,
            your plaint and ſorowes ceaſe.
            Such comfort will I geue
            you ere you part from hence,
            And for thaſſaltes of Fortunes pre
            prepare ſo ſure defence,
            So holeſome ſalue will I
            for your afflictions finde,
            That you ſhall hence depart agayne
            with well contented mynde.
            His wordes haue chaſed ſtraight
            out of her hart deſpayre,
            Her blacke and ougly dredfull thoughts
            by hope are waxen fayre.
            So fryer Lawrence now
            hath left her there alone,
            And he out of the church in haſt
            is to his chaumber gone.
            Where ſundry thoughtes within
            his carefull head ariſe,
            The old mans foreſight diuers doutes
            hath ſet before his eyes.
            His conſcience one while
            condems it for a ſinne,
            To let her take Paris to ſpouſe,
            ſince he himſelfe had byn
            The chefeſt cauſe, that ſhe
            vnknowne to father or mother,
            Not fiue monthes paſt in that ſelfe place
            was wedded to another.
            
               
An other while an hugy
            heape of daungers dred,
            His reſtles thought hath heaped vp,
            within his troubled hed.
            Euen of it ſelfe that tempt
            he iudgeth pertious,
            The execucion eke he demes
            ſo much more daungerous,
            That to a womans grace
            he muſt himſelfe commit,
            That yong is, ſimple, and vnware,
            for waighty affaires vnfit.
            For if the fayle in ought
            the matter publiſhed,
            Both ſhe and Romeus were vndonne,
            himſelfe eke puniſhed,
            When too and fro in mynde
            he dyuers thoughts had caſt,
            With tender pity and with ruth
            his hart was wonne at laſt.
            He thought he rather would
            in haſard ſet his fame,
            Then ſuffer ſuch adultery
            reſoluing on the ſame,
            Out of his cloſet ſtraight,
            he tooke a litele glaſſe,
            And then with double haſt retornde
            where wofull Iuliet was.
            Whom he hath found welnigh
            in traunce, ſcarce drawing breath,
            Attending ſtill to heare the newes
            of lyfe or els of death.
            Of whom he did enquire
            of the appointed day.
            On wenſday next (quod Iuliet)
            ſo doth my father ſay:
            
               
I muſt geue my conſent
            but (as I do remember)
            The ſolemne day of mariage is,
            the tenth day of September.
            Deere daughter quoth the fryer
            of good chere ſee thou be,
            For loe, ſainct Frauncis of his grace
            hath ſhewde a way to me,
            By which I may both thee,
            and Romeus together,
            Out of the bondage which you feare
            aſſured deliuer.
            Euen from the holy font
            thy huſband haue I knowne,
            And ſince he grew in yeres, haue kept
            his counſels as myne owne.
            For from his youth he would
            vnfold to me his hart,
            And often haue I cured him,
            of anguiſh, and of ſmart.
            I know that by deſert
            his frendſhip I haue wonne,
            And I him holde as dere, as if
            he were my propre ſonne.
            Wherfore my frendly hart,
            can not abyde that he
            Should wrongfully in ought be harmde,
            if that it lay in me,
            To right or to reuenge
            the wrong by my aduiſe,
            Or timely to preuent the ſame
            in any other wiſe.
            And ſith thou art his wife,
            thee am I bound to loue,
            For Romeus frindſhips ſake, and ſeeke
            thy anguiſhe to remoue.
            
               
And dreadfull torments which
            thy hart beſegen rounde,
            Wherfore my daughter geue good care,
            vnto my counſels ſounde.
            Forget not what I ſay,
            ne tell it any wight,
            Not to the nurce thou truſteſt ſo,
            as Romeus is thy knight.
            For on this threed doth hang
            thy death and eke thy lyfe,
            My fame, or ſhame, his weale or woe,
            that choſe thee to his wyfe.
            Thou art not ignorant
            (becauſe of ſuch renowne
            As euery where is ſpred of me,
            but chefely in this towne.)
            That in my youthfull dayes
            abrode I trauayled
            Through euery land found out by men,
            by men inhabited,
            So twenty yeres from home,
            in landes vnknowne, a geſt,
            I neuer gaue my weary limmes
            long time of quiet reſt.
            But in the deſert woodes,
            to beaſte? of cruell kinde,
            Or on the ſeas to drenching waues,
            at pleaſure of the winde.
            I haue committed them
            to ruth of rouers hand,
            And to a thouſand daungers more
            by water and by lande,
            But not in vayne (my childe)
            hath all my wandring byn,
            Beſide the great contentednes
            my ſprete abydeth in.
            
               
That by the pleaſant thought
            of paſſed thinges doth grow
            One priuate frute more haue I pluchd
            which thou ſhalt ſhortly know:
            What force the ſtones, the plants,
            and metals haue to woorke,
            And diuers other things that in
            the bowels of earth do loorke,
            With care I haue ſought out
            with payne I did them proue,
            With them eke can I helpe my ſelfe,
            at times of my behoue,
            (Although the ſcience be
            againſt the lawes of men)
            When ſodain daunger forceth me,
            but yet moſt cheefly when
            The worke to doe is leaſt
            diſpleaſing vnto God,
            Not helping to do any ſinne
            that wrekefull Ioue forbode.
            For ſince in lyfe no hope
            of long abode I haue,
            But now am comme vnto the drinke
            of my appointed graue,
            And that my death drawes nere,
            whoſe ſtripe I may not ſhonne,
            But ſhalbe calde to make account
            of all that I haue donne,
            Now ought I from hence forth
            more depely print in mynde
            The iudgement of the lord, then when
            youthes folly made me blynde,
            When loue and fond deſyre
            were boyling in my breſt,
            Whence hope and dred by ſtriuing thoughts
            had baniſhed frendly reſt,
            
               
Knowe therfore (daughter) that
            with other gyftes which I
            Haue well attained to by grace
            and fauour of the ſkye,
            Long ſince I did finde out,
            and yet the way I knowe
            Of certain rootes and ſauory herbes
            to make a kinde of dowe,
            Which baked hard, and bet
            into a powder fine,
            And dronke with conduite water, or
            with any kynd of wine,
            It doth in halfe an howre
            aſtonne the taker ſo,
            And maſtreth all his ſences, that
            he feeleth weale nor woe,
            And ſo it burieth vp
            the ſprite and liuing breath,
            That euen the ſkilfull leche would ſay,
            that he is ſlayne by death.
            One vertue more it hath,
            as meruelous as this,
            The taker by receiuing it,
            at all not greeued is.
            But painleſſe as a man,
            that thinketh nought at all,
            Into a ſwete and quiet ſlepe
            immediately doth fall,
            From which (according to
            the quantitie he taketh,
            Longer or ſhorter is the time
            before the ſleper waketh.
            And thence (theffect once wrought)
            agayne it doth reſtore
            Him that receaued vnto the ſtate,
            wherin he was before.
            
               
Wherfore, marke well the ende,
            of this my tale begonne,
            And therby learne what is by thee
            hereafter to be donne.
            Caſt of from thee at once,
            the weede of womanniſh dread,
            With manly courage arme thy ſelfe,
            from heele vnto the head.
            For onely on the feare
            or boldnes of thy breſt,
            The happy happe, or yll miſhappe
            of thy affayre doth reſt.
            Receiue this vyoll ſmall,
            and keepe it as thine eye,
            And on thy mariage day before
            the ſunne doe cleare the ſkye,
            Fill it with water full,
            vp to the very brim.
            Then drinke it of, and thou ſhalt feele,
            throughout eche vayne and lim:
            A pleaſant ſlumber ſlide,
            and quite diſpred at length,
            On all thy partes, from euery part
            reue all thy kindly ſtrength.
            Withouten mouing thus
            thy 
                  •
               dle parts ſhall reſt,
            No pulſe ſhall goe, ne hart once beate
            within thy hollow breſt.
            But thou ſhalt lye as ſhe
            that dyeth in a traunce,
            Thy kinſmen, and thy truſty frendes
            ſhall wayle the ſodain chaunce:
            Thy corps then will they bring
            to graue in this church yarde,
            Where thy forefathers long agoe
            a coſtly tombe preparde.
            
               
Both for himſelfe, and eke
            for thoſe that ſhould come after,
            Both deepe it is, and long and large,
            where thou ſhalt reſt my daughter,
            Till I to Mantua ſende
            for Romeus thy knight.
            Out of the tombe, both he and I
            will take thee forth that night.
            And when out of thy ſlepe
            thou ſhalt awake agayne,
            Then mayſt thou goe with him from hence,
            and healed of thy payne.
            In Mantua lead with him
            vnknowne a pleaſant life,
            And yet perhaps in time to comme,
            when c
                  •
               aſe ſhall all the ſtrife,
            And that the peace is made
            twixt Romeus and his foes,
            My ſelfe may finde ſo fit a time
            theſe ſecretes to dyſcloſe,
            Both to my prayſe, and to
            thy tender parentes ioy,
            That daungerles without reproche
            thou ſhalt thy loue enioy.
            When of his ſkilfull tale,
            the fryer had made an ende,
            To which our Iuliet ſo well
            her eare and wits dyd bend,
            That ſhe hath heard it all,
            and hath forgotten nought,
            Her fainting hart was comforted,
            with hope and pleaſant thought.
            And then to him ſhe ſaid,
            doubte not but that I will
            With ſtoute and vnappauled hart,
            your happy heſt fulfill.
            
               
Yea, if I wiſt it were
            a venemous dedly drinke:
            Rather would I that through my throte
            the certaine bane ſhould ſinke,
            Then I (not drinking it)
            into his handes ſhould fall,
            That hath no part of me as yet,
            ne ought to haue at all.
            Much more I ought with bold
            and with a willing hert,
            To greateſt daunger yelde my ſelfe
            and to the dedly ſmart,
            To comme to him, on whome
            my life doth wholy ſtay,
            That is my onely hartes delight,
            and ſo he ſhalbe aye.
            Then goe quoth he (my childe)
            I pray that God on hye,
            Direct thy foote, and by thy hand
            vpon the way thee gye:
            God graunt he ſo confirme
            in thee thy preſent will,
            That no inconſtant toy thee let,
            thy promeſſe to fulfill.
            A thouſand thankes and more,
            our Iuliet gaue the fryer,
            And homeward to her fathers houſe
            ioyfull ſhe doth retyre.
            And as with ſtately gate
            ſhe paſſed through the ſtreete,
            She ſaw her mother in the doore,
            that with her there would meete.
            In mynd to aſke if ſhe
            her purpoſe yet did holde,
            In mynd alſo a part twixt them,
            her duety to haue tolde:
            
               
Wherfore with pleaſant face,
            and with vnwonted chere,
            As ſoone as ſhe was vnto her
            approched ſumwhat nere,
            Before the mother ſpake,
            thus did ſhe fyrſt begin,
            Madame, at ſainct Frauncis churche
            haue I this morning byn,
            Where I did make abode,
            alonger while (percaſe)
            Then dewty would, yet haue I not
            been abſent from this place,
            So long a while, whithout
            a great and iuſt cauſe why,
            This frute haue I receaued there,
            my hart erſt lyke to dye,
            Is now reuiued agayne,
            and my afflicted breſt
            Releaſed from affliction,
            reſtored is to reſt.
            For lo, my tronbled goſt
            (alas too ſore diſeaſde,)
            By goſtly counſell and aduiſe,
            hath fryer Lawrence eaſde,
            To whome I did at large
            diſcourſe my former lyfe,
            And in confeſſion did I tell
            of all our paſſed ſtrife.
            Of Counte Paris ſute,
            and how my lord my ſyre,
            By my vngrate and ſtubborne ſtryft,
            I ſtyrred vnto yre.
            But lo, the holy fryer
            hath by his goſtly lore,
            Made me another woman now,
            then I had been before,
            
               
By ſtrength of argumentes
            he charged ſo my mynde,
            That (though I ſought) no ſure defence
            my ſerching thought could finde.
            So forced I was at length
            to yelde vp witles will,
            And promiſt to be orderd by
            the friers prayſed ſkill,
            Wherfore, albeit I
            had raſhely long before,
            The bed and rytes of mariage,
            for many yeres forſwore,
            Yet mother now behold,
            your daughter at your will,
            Ready (if you commaunde her ought)
            your pleaſure to fulfill.
            Wherfore in humble wiſe.
            dere madam I you pray
            To goe vnto my lord and ſyre,
            withouten long delay,
            Of him fyrſt pardon craue
            of faultes already paſt,
            And ſhew him (if it pleaſeth you)
            his child is now at laſt
            Obedient to his iuſt
            and to his ſkilfull heſt.
            And that I will (god lending life)
            on wenſday next be preſt▪
            
            To wayte on him and you,
            vnto thappoynted place,
            Where I will in your hearing and
            before my fathers face,
            Vnto the Counte geue
            my fayth and whole aſſent,
            To take him for my lord and ſpouſe.
            thus fully am I bent.
            
               
And that out of your mynde
            I may remoue all doute,
            Vnto my cloſet fare I now,
            to ſearche and to chooſe out
            The braueſt garmentes and
            the richeſt iewels there,
            Which (better him to pleaſe) I mynd
            on wenſday next to weare.
            For if I did excell
            the famous Gretian rape,
            Yet might attyre helpe to amende
            my bewty and my ſhape.
            The ſimple mother was,
            rapt in to great delight,
            Not halfe a word could ſhe bring forth,
            but in this ioyfull plight,
            With nimble foote ſhe ran
            and with vnwonted pace,
            Vnto her penſiue huſband, and
            to him with pleaſant face
            She tolde what ſhe had heard,
            and prayſeth much the fryer.
            And ioyfull teares ranne downe the cheekes
            of this gray berded fyer.
            With handes and eyes heaued vp,
            he thankes God in his hart,
            And then he ſayth, this is not (wife)
            the friers firſt deſart.
            Oft hath he ſhewde to vs,
            great frendſhip heretofore,
            By helping vs at nedefull times,
            with wiſdomes pretious lore:
            In all our common weale,
            ſcarce one is to be founde,
            But is for ſomme good torne vnto
            this holy father bounde.
            
               
Oh that the thyrd part of
            my goods (I doe not fayne)
            But twenty of his paſſed yeres
            might purchaſe him agayne
            So much in recompence
            of frendſhip would I geue,
            So much (in faith) his extreme age
            my frendly hart doth greue.
            Theſe ſaid, the glad old man,
            from home, goeth ſtraight abrode,
            And to the ſtately palace hyeth,
            where Paris made abode.
            Whom he deſyres to be
            on wenſday next his geaſt,
            At Freetowne, where he myndes to make
            for him a coſtly feaſt.
            But loe, the Earle ſaith
            ſuch feaſting were but loſt,
            And counſels him till mariage time
            to ſpare ſo great a coſt.
            For then he knoweth well
            the charges wilbe great,
            The whilſt his hart deſyreth ſtill
            her ſight, and not his meate.
            He craues of Capilet,
            that he may ſtraight go ſee
            Fayre Iuliet, wher to he doth
            right willingly agree.
            The mother warnde before,
            her daughter doth prepare,
            She warneth and ſhe chargeth her
            that in no wyſe ſhe ſpare
            Her curteous ſpeche, her pleaſant
            lookes, and commely grace,
            But liberally to geue them forth
            when Paris commes in place.
            
               
Which ſhe as cunningly
            could ſet forth to the ſhewe,
            As cunning crafteſmen to the ſale
            do ſet theie wares on rew:
            That ere the County did
            out of her ſight depart,
            So ſecretly vnwares to him,
            ſhe ſtale away his hart,
            That of his lyfe and death
            the wyly wench hath powre,
            And now his longing hart thinkes long
            for theyr appoynted howre.
            And with importune ſute,
            the parentes doth he pray,
            The wedlocke knot to knit ſoone vp,
            and haſt the mariage day.
            The woer hath paſt forth
            the firſt day in this ſort,
            And many other more then this,
            in pleaſure and diſport,
            At length the wiſhed time
            of long hoped delight,
            (As Paris thought) drew nere, but nere
            approched heauy plight:
            Againſt the bridall day
            the parentes did prepare,
            Such rich attyre, ſuch furniture,
            ſuch ſtore of dainty fare,
            That they which did behold
            the ſame the night before,
            Did thinke and ſay, a man could ſcarcely
            wiſhe for any more.
            Nothing did ſeeme to deere,
            the deereſt thinges were bought,
            And (as the written ſtory ſaith)
            in dede there wanted nought.
            
               
That longd to his degree
            and honor of his ſtocke,
            But Iuliet the whilſt her thoughts
            within her breſt did locke.
            Euen from the truſty nurce,
            whoſe ſecretries was tryde,
            The ſecret counſell of her hart
            the nurce childe ſeekes to hide.
            For ſith to mocke her dame
            ſhe dyd not ſticke to lye,
            She thought no ſinne with ſhew of truth,
            to bleare her nurces eye.
            In chamber-ſecretly
            the tale ſhe gan renew,
            That at the doore ſhe tolde her dame
            as though it had been trew.
            The flattring nurce did prayſe
            the fryer for his ſkill,
            And ſaid that ſhe had done right well
            by wit to order will.
            She ſetteth foorth at large
            the fathers furious rage,
            And eke ſhe prayſeth much to her,
            the ſecond mariage.
            And County Paris now
            ſhe praiſeth ten times more,
            By wrong, then ſhe her ſelfe by right,
            had Romeus prayſde before.
            Paris ſhall dwell there ſtill,
            Romeus ſhall not retourne,
            What ſhall it boote her life,
            to languiſh ſtill and mourne.
            The pleaſures paſt before,
            ſhe muſt account as gayne,
            But if he doe reforne, what then?
            for one ſhe ſhall haue twayne.
            
               
The one ſhall vſe her as
            his lawfull wedded wyſe,
            In wanton loue, with equall ioy
            the other leade his lyfe:
            And beſt ſhall ſhe be ſped
            of any towniſh dame,
            Of huſband and of paramour,
            to fynde her chaunge of game.
            Theſe wordes and like, the nurce
            did ſpeake, in hope to pleaſe,
            But greatly did thoſe wicked wordes
            the ladies mynde diſeaſe:
            But ay ſhe hid her wrath,
            and ſeemed well content,
            When dayly dyd the naughty nurce
            new argumentes inuent:
            But when the bryde perceued
            her howre opproched nere,
            She ſought (the beſt ſhe could) to fayne,
            and tempted ſo her cheere,
            That by her outward looke,
            no liuing wight could geſſe
            Her inward woe, and yet a new
            renewde is her diſtreſſe.
            Vnto her chaumber doth
            the penſiue wight repayre.
            And in her hand a percher light
            the nurce beares vp the ſtayre,
            In Iuliets chamber was
            her wonted vſe to lye,
            Wherfore her miſtres dreading that
            ſhe ſhould her work deſcrye
            As ſone as ſhe began
            her pallet to vnfold,
            Thinking to lye that night, where ſhe
            was wont to lye of olde:
            
               
Doth gently pray her ſeeke,
            her lodgeing ſome where els.
            And leſt the crafty ſhould ſuſpect,
            a ready reaſon telles.
            Derefrend (quoth ſhe) you knowe,
            to morow is the day,
            Of new contract, wherfore this night,
            my purpoſe is to pray,
            Vnto the heauenly myndes,
            that dwell aboue the ſkyes,
            And order all the courſe of thinges,
            as they can beſt deuyſe,
            That they ſo ſmyle vpon
            the doynges of To morow,
            That all the remnant of my lyfe,
            may be exempt from ſorow:
            Wherfore I pray you leaue
            me here alone this night,
            But ſee that you to morow comme
            before the dawning light,
            For you muſt coorle my heare,
            and ſet on my attyre,
            And eaſtly the louing nurſe,
            dyd yelde to her deſire.
            For ſhe within he hed
            dyd caſt before no doute,
            She little knew the cloſe attempt,
            her nurce childe went about.
            The nurce departed once,
            the chamber doore ſhut cloſe,
            Aſſured that no liuing wight,
            her doing myght diſcloſe,
            She powred forth into
            the vyole of the fryer,
            Water out of a ſiluer ewer,
            that on the boord ſtoode by her,
            
               
The ſlepy mixture made,
            fayre Iuliet doth it hyde,
            Vnder her bolſter ſoft, and ſo
            vnto her bed ſhe hyed:
            Where diuers nouel thoughts
            ariſe within her hed,
            And ſhe is ſo inuironed
            about with deadly dred,
            That what before ſhe had
            reſolued vndoutedly,
            That ſame ſhe calleth into doute,
            and lying doutfully,
            Whilſt honeſt loue did ſtriue
            with dred of dedly payne,
            With handes ywrong, and weping eyes,
            thus gan ſhe to complaine.
            What, is there any one
            beneth the heauens hye,
            So much vnfortunate as I,
            ſo much paſt hope as I?
            What, am not I my ſelfe
            of all that yet were borne,
            The depeſt drenched in diſpayre,
            and moſt in Fortunes ſkorne?
            For loe the world for me,
            hath nothing els to finde,
            Beſide miſhap and wretchednes,
            and anguiſh of the mynde,
            Since that the cruel cauſe
            of my vnhappines,
            Hath put me to this ſodaine plonge,
            and brought to ſuch diſtres,
            As (to the end I may
            my name and conſcience ſaue,)
            I muſt deuowre the mixed drinke,
            that by me here I haue.
            
               
Whoſe woorking and whoſe force
            as yet I doe not know,
            And of this piteous plaint began
            another doute to growe.
            What doe I knowe (quoth ſhe)
            if that this powder ſhall
            Sooner or later then it ſhould
            or els not woorke at all?
            And then my craft deſcride,
            as open as the day,
            The peoples tale and laughing ſtocke,
            ſhall I remayne for aye.
            And what know I (quoth ſhe)
            if ſerpentes odious,
            And other beaſtes and wormes that are
            of nature venemous,
            That wonted are to lurke,
            in darke caues vnder grounde,
            And commonly as I haue heard
            in dead mens tombes are found,
            Shall harme me yea or nay,
            where I ſhall lye as ded,
            Or how ſhall I that alway haue
            in ſo freſhe ayre been bred
            Endure the lothſome ſtinke
            of ſuch an heaped ſtore
            Of carkaſes, not yet conſumde
            and bones that long before
            Intombed were, where I
            my ſleping place ſhall haue,
            Where all my aunceſters doe reſt,
            my kindreds common graue.
            Shall not the fryer and
            my Romeus when they come,
            Fynd me (if I awake before)
            yſtified in the tombe?
            
               
And whtlſt ſhe in theſe thoughtes
            doth dwell ſomwhat to long,
            The force of her ymagining,
            anon dyd ware ſo ſtrong,
            That ſhe ſurmyſde ſhe ſaw
            out of the hollow vaulte,
            (A griefly thing to looke vpon,)
            the carkas of Tybalt,
            Right in the ſelfe ſame ſort,
            that ſhe few dayes before
            Had ſeene him in his blood embrewde,
            to death eke wounded ſore.
            And then, when ſhe agayne
            within her ſelfe had wayde,
            That quicke ſhe ſhould be buried there,
            and by his ſide be layde
            All comfortles, for ſhe
            ſhall liuing feere haue none
            But many a rotten carkas, and
            full many a naked bone:
            Her dainty tender partes
            gan ſheuer all for dred,
            Her golden heares did ſtand vpright,
            vpon her chilliſh hed.
            Then preſſed with the feare
            that ſhe there liued in,
            A ſweat as colde as mountaine yſe,
            pearſt through her tender ſkin,
            That with the moyſture hath
            wet euery part of hers,
            And more beſides, ſhe vainely thinkes,
            whilſt vainely thus ſhe feares,
            A thouſand bodies dead
            haue compaſt her about,
            And leſt they will diſmember her,
            ſhe greatly ſtandes in dout,
            
               
But when ſhe felt her ſtrength
            began to weare away,
            By little and little, and in her hart
            her feare increaſed ay:
            Dreading that weakenes might
            or fooliſh cowardiſe
            Hinder the execution of
            the purpoſde enterpriſe,
            As ſhe had frantike been,
            in haſt the glaſſe ſhe cought,
            And vp ſhe dranke the mixture quite.
            withouten farther thought.
            Then on her breſt ſhe croſt
            her armes long and ſmall,
            And ſo her ſenſes fayling her,
            into a traunce did fall.
            And when that Phoebus bright
            heaued vp his ſeemely hed,
            And from the Eaſt in open ſkies
            his gliſtring rayes diſpred
            The nurce vnſhut the doore,
            for ſhe the key did keepe,
            And douting ſhe had ſlept to long,
            ſhe thought to breake her ſlepe:
            Fyrſt, ſoftly dyd ſhe call,
            then lowder thus did crye,
            Lady, you ſlepe to long, (the Earle)
            will rayſe you by and by.
            But wele away, in vayne
            vnto the deafe ſhe calles,
            She thinkes to ſpeake to Iuliet,
            but ſpeaketh to the walles.
            If all the dredfull noyſe,
            that might on earth be found,
            Or on the roaring ſeas, or if
            the dredfull thunders ſound,
            
               
Had blowne into her eares,
            I thinke they could not make,
            The ſleping wight before the time
            by any meanes awake:
            So were the ſprites of lyfe
            ſhut vp, and ſenſes thrald,
            Wherwith the ſeely carefull nurce,
            was wondrouſly apalde.
            She thought to daw her now
            as ſhe had donne of olde,
            But loe, ſhe found her parts were ſtiffe.
            and more then marble colde,
            Neither at mouth nor noſe,
            found ſhe recourſe of breth,
            Two certaine argumentes were theſe,
            of her vntimely death.
            Wherfore as one diſtraught,
            ſhe to her mother ranne,
            With ſcratched face, and heare betorne,
            but no woord ſpeake ſhe can.
            At laſt (with much a doe)
            dead (quoth ſhe) is my childe,
            Now out alas (the mother cryde)
            and as a Tyger wilde,
            Whoſe whelpes whilſt ſhe is gonne
            out of her denne to pray,
            The hunter gredy of his game,
            doth kill or cary away:
            So, rageing forth ſhe ranne,
            vnto her Iuliets bed,
            And there ſhe found her derling, and
            her onely comfort ded.
            Then ſhriked ſhe out as lowde,
            as ſerue her would her breth,
            And then (that pity was to heare)
            thus cryde ſhe out on death.
            
               
Ah cruell death (quoth ſhe)
            that thus againſt all right
            Haſt ended my felicitie,
            and robde my hartes delight,
            Do now thy worſt to me,
            once wreake thy wrath for all.
            Euen in deſpite I crye to thee
            thy vengeance let thou fall.
            Wherto ſtay I (alas,)
            ſince Iuliet is gone?
            Wherto liue I ſince ſhe is dead,
            except to wayle and mone?
            Alacke dere chyld, my teares
            for thee ſha
                  •
               l neuer ceaſe,
            Euen as my dayes of life increaſe,
            ſo ſhall my plaint increaſe.
            Such ſtore of ſorow ſhall
            afflict my tender hart,
            That dedly panges when they aſſayle
            ſhall not augment my ſmart.
            Then gan ſhe ſo to ſobbe,
            it ſeemde her hart would braſt,
            And while ſhe crieth thus, behold
            the father at the laſt,
            The County Paris, and
            of gentilmen a route,
            And ladies of Verona towne,
            and country round about,
            Both kindreds and alies,
            thet her a pace haue preaſt,
            For by theyr preſence there they ſought
            to honor ſo the feaſt,
            But when the heauy newes
            the hydden geaſtes did heare,
            So much they mournd, that who had ſeene
            theyr countnance and theyr cheere,
            
               
Might eaſely haue indgde,
            by that that they had ſeene,
            That day the day of wrath, and eke
            of pity haue beene.
            But more then all the reſt
            the fathers hart was ſo
            Smit with the heauy newes, and ſo
            ſhut vp with ſodain woe,
            That he ne had the powre
            his daughter to bewepe,
            Ne yet to ſpeake, but long is forſd,
            his teares and plaint to kepe.
            In all the haſt he hath
            for ſkilfull leaches ſent,
            And hearyng of her paſſed life,
            they iudge with one aſſent,
            The cauſe of this her death
            was inward care and thought,
            And then with double force againe
            the doubled ſorowes wrought.
            If euer there hath been
            a lamentable day,
            A day ruthfull, vnfortunate,
            and fatall, then I ſay,
            The ſame was it in which,
            through Veron towne was ſpred,
            The wofull newes how Iuliet
            was ſterued in her bed.
            For ſo ſhe was bemonde,
            both of the yong and olde,
            That it might ſeeme to him that would
            the commen plaint behold,
            That all the commen welth
            did ſtand in ieopardy,
            So vniuerfall was the plaint,
            ſo piteous was the crye.
            
               
For lo, beſide her ſhape,
            and natiue bewties hewe,
            With which, like as ſhe grew in age,
            her vertues prayſes grewe.
            She was alſo ſo wiſe,
            ſo lowly, and ſo mydle:
            That euen from the hory head,
            vnto the witles childe,
            She wan the hartes of all,
            ſo that there was not one,
            Ne great ne ſmall, but dyd that day
            her wretched ſtate bemone.
            Whilſt Iuliet ſlept, and whilſt
            the other wepen thus:
            Our fryer Lawrence hath by this,
            ſent one to Romeus.
            A frier of his houſe,
            there neuer was a better,
            He truſted him euen as himſelfe,
            to whom he gaue a letter:
            In which, he written had,
            of euery thing at length,
            That paſt twixt Iuliet and him,
            and of the powders ſtrength.
            The next night after that,
            he willeth him to comme
            To helpe to take his Iuliet
            out of the hollow toombe.
            For by that time, the drinke
            he ſaith will ceaſe to woorke,
            And for one night his wife and he
            within his cell ſhall loorke.
            Then ſhall he cary her
            to Mantua away,
            (Till ſickell Fortune fauour him)
            diſguiſde in mans aray.
            
               
Thys letter cloſde he ſendes
            to Romeus by his brother:
            He chargeth him that in no caſe
            he geue it any other.
            Apace our frier Iohn
            to Mantua him hyes,
            And for becauſe in Italy
            it is a wonted gyſe,
            That friers in the towne
            ſhould ſeeldome walke alone,
            But of theyr couent ay ſhould be
            accompanide with one:
            Of his profeſſion ſtraight
            a houſe he fyndeth out.
            In mynde to take ſome frier with him,
            to walke the towne about.
            But entred once, he might
            not iſſue out agayne,
            For that a brother of the houſe,
            a day before or twayne.
            Dyed of the plague (a ſickenes which
            they greatly feare and hate)
            So were the brethren charged to kepe
            within theyr couent gate,
            Bard of theyr felowſhip,
            that in the towne do wonne,
            The towne folke eke commaunded are,
            the fryers houſe to ſhonne:
            Tyll they that had the care of health,
            theyr fredome ſhould renew,
            Wherof, as you ſhall ſhortly heare,
            a miſcheefe great there grewe.
            The fryer by this reſtraint,
            beſet with dred and ſorow,
            Not knowing what the letters held,
            differd vntill the morowe:
            
               
And then he thought in tyme
            to ſend to Romeus,
            But whilſt at Mantua where he was,
            theſe dooinges framed thus,
            The towne of Iuliets byrth
            was wholy buſied,
            About her obſequies, to ſee
            theyr darlyng buried.
            Now is the parentes myrth
            quite chaunged into mone,
            And now to ſorow is retornde
            the ioy of euery one.
            And now the wedding weedes
            for mourning weedes they chaunge,
            And Hymene into a Dyrge,
            alas it ſeemeth ſtraunge.
            In ſteade of mariage gloues,
            now funerall gloues they haue,
            And whom they ſhould ſee maried,
            they follow to the graue.
            The feaſt that ſhould haue been
            of pleaſure and of ioy,
            Hath euery diſh, and cup, fild full
            of ſorow and annoye.
            Now throughout Italy
            this commen vſe they haue,
            That all the beſt of euery ſtocke
            are earthed in one graue.
            For euery houſhold, if
            it be of any fame,
            Doth bylde a tombe, or digge a vault
            that beares the houſholdes name.
            Wherein (if any of
            that kindred hap to dye)
            They are beſtowde, els in the ſame
            no other corps may lye.
            
               
The Capilets, her corps
            in ſuch a one dyd lay,
            Where Tybalt ſlayne of Romeus,
            was layde the other, day:
            An other vſe there is,
            that whoſoeuer dyes,
            Borne to their church with open face,
            vpon the beere he lyes
            In wonted weede attyrde,
            not wrapt in winding ſheete,
            So, as by chaunce he walked abrode,
            our Romeus man dyd meete
            His maiſters wyſe, the ſight
            with ſorow ſtraight dyd wounde
            His honeſt hart, with teares he ſawe
            her lodged vnder ground.
            And for he had been ſent
            to Verone for a ſpye,
            The doynges of the Capilets
            by wiſdome to deſcrye,
            And for he knew her death
            dyd tooch his maiſter moſt,
            (Alas) too ſoone, with heauy newes
            he byed away in poſt:
            And in his houſe he found
            his maiſter Romeus,
            Where he beſprent with many feares,
            began to ſpeake him thus.
            Syr, vnto you of late
            is chaunced ſo great a harme,
            That ſure except with conſtancy
            you ſeeke your ſelfe to arme,
            I feare that ſtrayght you will
            brethe out your latter breath,
            And I moſt wretched wight ſhalbe
            thoccaſion of your death.
            
               
Know ſyr that yeſterday
            my lady and your wyfe,
            I wot not by what ſodain grefe,
            hath made exchaunge of life:
            And for becauſe on earth,
            ſhe found nought but vnreſt,
            In heauen hath ſhe ſought to fynde
            a place of quiet reſt.
            And with theſe weping eyes
            my ſelfe haue ſeene her layde
            Within the tombe of Capilets,
            and here withall he ſtayde,
            This ſodayne meſſage ſounde
            ſent forth with ſighes and teares,
            Our Romeus receaued too ſoone
            with open liſtening eares,
            And therby hath ſonke in
            ſuch ſorow in his hart,
            That loe, his ſprite annoyed ſore
            with torment and with ſmart,
            Was like to breake out of
            his priſon houſe perforce,
            And that he might flye after hers,
            would leaue the maſſy corce.
            But earneſt loue that will
            not fayle him till hie ende,
            This fond and ſodain fantaſy
            into his head dyd ſende:
            That if nere vnto her
            he offred vp his breath,
            That then an hundred thouſand parts
            more glorious were his death,
            Eke ſhould his painfull hart
            a great deale more be eaſed,
            And more alſo (he vainely thought)
            his lady better pleaſed.
            
               
Wherfore, when he his face
            hath waſht with water cleene,
            Leſt that the ſtaynes of dryed teares,
            might on his cheekes be ſeene,
            And ſo his ſorow ſhould
            of euery one be ſpyde,
            Which he with all his care dyd ſeeke
            from euery one to hyde:
            Straight wery of the houſe,
            he walketh forth abrode,
            His ſeruant at the maiſters heſt
            in chamber ſtyll abode:
            And then fro ſtreate to ſtreate,
            he wandreth vp and downe,
            To ſee if he in any place
            may fynde in all the towne,
            A ſalue meete for his ſore,
            an oyle fitte for his wounde,
            And ſeeking long (alac too ſoone)
            the thing he ſought, he founde.
            An Apothecary ſate
            vnbuſied at his doore,
            Whom by his heauy countenaunce
            he geſſed to be poore,
            And in his ſhop he ſaw
            his boxes were but fewe,
            And in his window (of his wares)
            there was ſo ſmall a ſhew,
            Wherfore our Romeus
            aſſuredly hath thought,
            What by no frendſhip could be got,
            with money ſhould be bought.
            For nedy lacke is lyke
            the poore man to compell,
            To ſell that which the cities lawe
            forbiddeth him to ſell.
            
               
Then by the hand he drew
            the nedy man apart,
            And with the ſight of glitrring gold
            inflamed hath his hart,
            Take fiftie crownes of gold
            (quoth he) I geue them thee▪
            
            So that before I part from hence
            thou ſtraight deliuer me,
            Somme poyſon ſtrong, that may
            in leſſe then halfe an howre,
            Kill him whoſe wretched hap ſhalbe
            the potion to deuowre.
            The wretch by couetiſe
            is wonne, and doth aſſent,
            To ſell the thing, whoſe ſale ere long▪
            
            too late he doth repent.
            In haſt he poyſon ſought,
            and cloſely he it bounde,
            And then began with whiſpering voyce
            thus in his eare to rounde,
            Fayre ſyr (quoth he) be ſure,
            this is the ſpeeding gere,
            And more there is then you ſhall nede,
            for halfe of that is there,
            Will ſerue, I vndertake,
            in leſſe then half an howre,
            To kill the ſtrongeſt man aliue,
            ſuch is the poyſons power,
            Then Romeus ſomwhat eaſd
            of one part of his care,
            Within his boſome putteth vp
            his dere vnthrifty ware.
            Retorning home agayne,
            he ſent his man away,
            To Verone towne, and chargeth him,
            that he without delay,
            
               
Prouyde both inſtruments,
            to open wyde the toombe,
            And lightes to ſhew him Iuliet,
            and ſtay (till he ſhall comme.)
            Nere to the place whereas
            his louing wyfe doth reſt,
            And chargeth him not to bewray
            the dolours of his breſt.
            Peter, theſe heard, his leaue
            both of his maiſter take,
            Betyme he commes to towne, ſuch haſt
            the paynfull man did make.
            And then with buſy care
            he ſeeketh to fulfill,
            But doth dyſcloſe vnto no wight
            his wofull maiſters will.
            Would God he had herein
            broken his maiſters heſt,
            Would God that to the fryer he had
            dyſcloſed all hys breſt.
            But Romeus, the whyle,
            with many a dedly thought,
            Prouoked much, hath cauſed ynke
            and paper to be brought,
            And in few lynes he dyd
            of all his loue dyſcoorſe,
            How by the fryers helpe, and by
            the knowledge of the noorſe,
            The wedlocke knot was knyt,
            and by what meane that night
            And many moe he dyd enioy,
            his happy hartes delight.
            Where he the poyſon bought,
            and how his lyfe ſhould ende,
            And ſo his wailefull tragedy
            the wretched man hath pend.
            
               
The letters cloſe and ſeald,
            directed to his ſyre:
            He locketh in his purſe, and then,
            a poſt hors doth he hyre.
            When he approched nere,
            he waxely lighted downe,
            And euen with the ſhade of night,
            he entred Verone towne,
            Where he hath found his man
            wayting when he ſhould comme,
            With lanterne and with inſtruments,
            to open Iuliets toomme.
            Helpe Peter, helpe quod he,
            helpe to remoue the ſtone,
            And ſtraight when I am gone fro thee
            my Iuliet to bemone:
            See that thou get thee hence,
            and on the payne of death,
            I charge thee that thou comme not nere,
            whyle I abyde beneath,
            Ne ſeeke thou not to let
            thy maſters enterpriſe,
            Which he hath fully purpoſed
            to doe in any wiſe.
            Take there a letter, which
            as ſoone as he ſhall ryſe,
            Preſent it in the morning to
            my louing fathers eyes.
            Which vnto him perhaps
            farre pleaſanter ſhall ſeeme,
            Then eyther I do mynd to ſay,
            or thy groſe head can deeme.
            Now Peter that knew not,
            the purpoſe of his hart,
            Obediently a little way
            withdrew himſelfe apart,
            
               
And then our Romeus,
            (the vault ſtone ſet vpright)
            Deſcended downe, and in his hand,
            he bare the candle light.
            And then with piteous eye,
            the body of his wyfe,
            He gan beholde, who ſurely was
            the organ of his lyfe.
            For whom vnhappy now
            he is, but erſt was blyſt:
            He watred her with teares, and then
            an hundred times her kyſt.
            And in his folded armes,
            full ſtraightly he her plight,
            But no way could his greedy eyes
            be filled with her ſight,
            His fearfull handes he layd
            vpon her ſtomacke colde,
            And them on diuers parts beſyde,
            the wofull wight did hold.
            But when he could not fynd
            the ſignes of lyfe he ſought,
            Out of his curſed box he drewe
            the poyſon that he bought.
            Wherof, he gredely
            deuowrde the greater part,
            And then he cryde with dedly ſigh,
            fetcht from his mourning hart:
            Oh Iuliet, of whom
            the world vnwoorthy was,
            From which, for worldes vnworthines
            thy worthy goſt dyd paſſe:
            What death more pleaſant could
            my hart wiſh to abyde,
            Then that which here it ſuffreth now,
            ſo nere thy frendly ſyde.
            
               
Or els ſo glorious tombe,
            how could my youth haue craued.
            As in one ſelfe ſame vaulte with thee
            haply to be ingraued?
            What Epitaph more worth,
            or halfe ſo excellent,
            To conſecrate my memorye,
            could any man inuente
            As this, our mutuell, and
            our piteous ſacrifice
            Of lyfe, ſet light for loue, but while
            he talketh in this wiſe,
            And thought as yet a while
            his dolors to enforce,
            His tender hart began to faynt,
            preſt with the venoms force:
            Which little and little gan
            to ouercomme hys hart,
            And whilſt his buſy eyne he threwe
            about to euery part:
            He ſaw hard by the corce
            of ſleping Iuliet,
            Bold Tybalts carkas dead, which was
            not all conſumed yet,
            To whom (as hauing life)
            in this ſort ſpeaketh he,
            Ah coſin dere Tybalt, whereſo
            thy reſtles ſprite now be,
            With ſtretched handes to thee
            for mercy now I crye,
            For that before thy kindly howre
            I forced thee to dye.
            But if with quenched lyfe,
            not quenched be thine yre.
            But with reuengeing luſt as yet
            thy hart be ſet on fyre:
            
               
What more amendes, or cruell
            wreke deſyreſt thou?
            To ſee on me, then this which here
            is ſhewd forth to thee now?
            Who reft by force of armes
            from thee thy liuing breath,
            The ſame with his owne hand (thou ſeeſt)
            doth poyſon himſelfe to death.
            And for he cauſed thee
            in tombe too ſoone to lye,
            Too ſoone alſo, yonger then thou
            himſelfe he layeth by.
            Theſe ſaid, when he gan feele,
            the poyſons force preuayle,
            And little and little maſtred lyfe,
            for aye beganne to fayle,
            Kneeling vpon his knees,
            he ſaid with voyce full lowe,
            Lord Chriſt that ſo to raunſome me
            reſcendedſt long agoe,
            Out of thy fathers boſome,
            and in the virgins wombe,
            Didſt put on fleſhe, Oh let my plaint
            out of this hollow toombe,
            Perce through the ayre, and graunt
            my ſute may fauour finde.
            Take pity on my ſinnefull and
            my poore afflicted mynde.
            For well enough I know,
            this body is but clay,
            Nought but a maſſe of ſinne, to frayle,
            and ſubiect to decay.
            Then preſſed with extreme greefe,
            he threw with ſo great force,
            His ouerpreſſed parts vpon
            his ladies wayled corps:
            
               
That now his wekened hart,
            weakened with tormentes paſt,
            Vnable to abyde this pang,
            the ſharpeſt and the laſt:
            Remayned quite depriued,
            of ſenſe and kindly ſtrength,
            And ſo the long impriſond ſoule,
            hath freedome wonne at length.
            Ah cruell death, too ſoone,
            too ſoone was this deuorce,
            Twixt youthfull Romeus heauenly ſprite,
            and his fayre earthy corſe.
            The fryer that knew what time
            the powder had been taken,
            Knew eke the very inſtant, when
            the ſleper ſhould awaken.
            But wondring that he could
            no kind of aunſwer heare,
            Of letters, which to Romeus
            his fellow fryer did beare:
            Out of ſainct Frauncis church
            hymſelfe alone dyd fare,
            And for the opening of the tombe,
            meete inſtrumentes he bare:
            Approching nigh the place,
            and ſeeing there the lyght,
            Great horror felt he in his hart,
            by ſtraunge and ſodaine ſight,
            Tyll Peter (Romeus man)
            his coward hart made bolde,
            When of his maſters being there,
            the certain newes he tolde:
            There hath he been (quoth he)
            this halfe howre at the leaſt,
            And in this time I dare well ſay
            his plaint hath ſtill increaſt.
            
               
Then both they entred in,
            where they (alas) dyd fynde,
            The bretheles corps of Romeus,
            forſaken of the mynde.
            Where they haue made ſuch mone,
            as they may beſt conceue,
            That haue with perfect frendſhip loued,
            whoſe frend, feeres death dyd reue.
            But whilſt with piteous playnt,
            they Romeus fate be wepe,
            An howre too late fayre Iuliet
            awaked out of ſlepe.
            And much amaſde to ſee
            in tombe ſo great a light,
            She wiſt not if ſhe ſaw a dreame,
            or ſprite that walkd by night.
            But cumming to her ſelfe,
            ſhe knew them, and ſaid thus,
            What fryer Lawrence, is it you?
            where is my Romeus?
            And then the auncient frier,
            that greatly ſtoode in feare,
            Leſt if they lingred ouer long,
            they ſhould be taken theare,
            In few plaine woordes, the whole
            that was betyde he tolde,
            And with his fingar ſhewd his corps
            out ſtretched, ſtiffe, and colde,
            And then perſwaded her
            with pacience to abyde
            This ſodain great miſchaunce, and ſayth
            that he will ſoone prouyde
            In ſomme religious houſe
            for her a quiet place,
            Where ſhe may ſpend the reſt of lyfe,
            and where in time percaſe
            
               
She may with wiſdomes meane,
            meaſure her mourning breſt,
            And vnto her tormented ſoule
            call backe exiled reſt.
            But loe, as ſoone as ſhe
            had caſt her ruthfull eye
            On Romeus face, that pale and wan,
            faſt by her ſide dyd lye,
            Straight way ſhe dyd vnſtop
            the conduites of her teares,
            And out they guſhe, with cruell hand
            ſhe tare her golden heares.
            But when ſhe neither could
            her ſwelling ſorowſ wage,
            Ne yet her tender hart abyde
            her ſickenes furious rage:
            Falne on his corps, ſhe lay
            long panting on his face,
            And then with all her force and ſtrength,
            the ded corps dyd embrace,
            As though with ſighes, with ſobs,
            with force and buſy payne,
            She would him rayſe, and hun reſtore
            from death to lyfe agayne:
            A thouſand times ſhe kiſt
            his month as cold as ſtone,
            And it vnkiſt agayne as oft,
            then gan ſhe thus to mone.
            Ah pleaſant prop of all
            my thoughtes, ah onely ground
            Of all the ſweete delightes, that yet
            in all my lyfe I found.
            Did ſuch aſſured truſt
            within thy hart repoſe:
            That in this place, and at this time,
            this churchyarde thou haſt choſe?
            
               
Betwixt the armes of me,
            thy perfect louing make?
            And thus by meanes of me to ende
            thy lyfe, and for my ſake?
            Euen in the flowring of
            thy youth, when vnto thee,
            Thy lyfe moſt deare (as to the moſt)
            and pleaſant ought to be:
            How could this tender corps
            withſtand the cruell fight
            Of furious death, that wonts to fray
            the ſteuteſt with his ſight:
            How could thy dainty youth
            agree with willing hart,
            In this ſo fowle infected place
            (to dwell) where now thou art.
            Where ſpitefull Fortune hath
            appaynted thee to be,
            The dainty foode of greedy woormes,
            vnworthy ſure of thee.
            Alas, alas, alas,
            what neded now a new,
            My wonted ſorowes doubled twiſe
            agayne thus to renewe?
            Which both the tyme, and eke
            my pacient long abode,
            Should now at length haue quenched quite,
            and vnder foote haue trode.
            Ah wretch, and caytiue that
            I am, euen when I thought
            To find my painefull paſſions ſalue:
            I myſt the thing I ſought,
            And to my mortall harme,
            the fatall knyfe I grounde,
            That gaue to me ſo deepe, ſo wyde,
            ſo cruell dedly wounde.
            
               
Ah thou moſt fortunate,
            and moſt vnhappy tombe,
            For thou ſhalt beare from age to age,
            witnes in time to comme,
            Of the moſt perfect leage,
            betwixt a payre of louers,
            That were the moſt vnfortunate,
            and fortunate of others:
            Receaue the latter ſigh,
            receaue the latter pang,
            Of the moſt cruell of cruell ſlaues,
            that wrath and death ay wrang.
            And when our Iuliet would
            continue ſtill her mone,
            The fryer and the ſeruant fied
            and left her there alone.
            For they a ſodayne noyſe,
            faſt by the place did heare,
            And leſt they might be taken there,
            greatly they ſtoode in feare.
            When Iuliet ſaw her ſelfe
            left in the vaulte alone,
            That freely ſhe might worke her will,
            for let or ſtay was none:
            Then once for all, ſhe tooke
            the cauſe of all her harmes,
            The body dead of Romeus,
            and claſpd it in her armes,
            Then ſhe with earneſt kiſſe,
            ſufficiently did proue,
            That more then by the feare of death,
            ſhe was attaint by loue.
            And then paſt deadly feare,
            for lyfe ne had ſhe care,
            With haſty hand ſhe did draw out,
            the dagger that he ware.
            
               
O welcome death (quoth ſhe)
            end of vnhappines,
            That alſo art beginning of
            aſſured happines:
            Feare not to darte me nowe,
            thy ſtripe no longer ſtay,
            Prolong no longer now my lyfe,
            I hate this long delaye.
            For ſtraight my parting ſprite,
            out of this carkas fled,
            At eaſe ſhall finde my Romeus ſprite,
            emong ſo many ded.
            And thou my louing lord,
            Romeus my truſty feer,
            If knowledge yet doe reſt in thee,
            if thou theſe woordes doſt heer:
            Receue thou her whom thou
            didſt loue ſo lawfully,
            That cauſd (alas) thy violent death
            although vnwillingly.
            And therfore willingly
            offers to thee her goſt,
            To thend that no wight els but thou,
            might haue iuſt cauſe to boſte
            Thinioying of my loue,
            which ay I haue reſerued,
            Free from the reſt, bound vnto thee,
            that haſt it well deſerued.
            That ſo our parted ſprites,
            from light that we ſee here,
            In place of endleſſe light and bliſſe,
            may euer liue yfere.
            Theſe ſaid, her ruthleſſe hand
            through gyrt her valiant hart.
            Ah Ladies helpe with teares to wayle,
            the ladies dedly ſmart.
            
               
She grones ſhe ſtretcheth out
            her ſimmes, ſhe ſhuttes her eyes,
            And from her corps the ſprite doth fiye.
            what ſhould I ſay: ſhe dyes.
            The watchemen of the towne,
            the whilſt are paſſed by,
            And through the grates the candel light
            within the tombe they ſpye:
            Wherby they did ſuppoſe,
            inchaunters to be comme,
            That with prepared inſtrumentes
            had opend wide the tombe,
            In purpoſe to abuſe
            the bodies of the ded,
            Which by theyr ſcience ayde abuſde
            do ſtand them oft in ſted.
            Theyr curious harts deſire,
            the trueth herof to know,
            Then they by certaine ſteppes deſcend,
            where they do fynd below
            In claſped armes ywrapt
            the huſband and the wyfe,
            In whom as yet they ſeemd to ſee
            ſomme certaine markes of lyfe.
            But when more curiouſly
            with leyſure they did vew,
            The certainty of both theyr deathes,
            aſſuredly they knew.
            Then here and there ſo long
            with carefull ere they ſought,
            That at the length hidden they found
            the murthrers, ſo they thought.
            In dongeon depe that night
            they lodgde them vnder grounde,
            The next day do they tell the prince
            the miſchefe that they found.
            
               
The newes was by and by
            throughout the towne dyſpred
            Both of the takyng of the fryer,
            and of the two found ded.
            Thether might you haue ſeene
            whole houſholdes forth to ronne.
            For to the tombe where they did heare
            this wonder ſtraunge was donne,
            The great, the ſmall, the riche,
            the poore, the yong, the olde,
            With haſly pace do ronne to ſee,
            but rew when they behelde.
            And that the murtherers
            to all men might be knowne,
            Like as the murders brute abrode
            through all the towne was blowne.
            The prince did ſtraight ordaine,
            the corſes that wer founde
            Should be ſet forth vpon a ſtage,
            hye rayſed from the grounde,
            Right in the ſelfe ſame fourme,
            (ſhewde forth to all mens ſight)
            That in the hollow valt they had
            been found that other night.
            And eke that Romeus man,
            and fryer Lawrence ſhould
            Be openly examined,
            for els the people would
            Haue murmured, or faynd
            there were ſome wayghty cauſe,
            Why openly they were not calde,
            and ſo conuict by lawes.
            The holy fryer now,
            and reuerent by his age,
            In great reproche ſet to the ſhew
            vpon the open ſtage.
            
               
(A thing that ill beſeemde,
            a man of ſiluer heares)
            His beard as whyte as mylke he bathes,
            with great faſt falling teares.
            Whom ſtraight the dredfull Iudge
            commaundeth to declare
            Both how this murther hath been donne,
            aud who the murthrers are.
            For that he nere the tombe
            was found at howres vnfitte,
            And had with him thoſe yron tooles,
            for ſuch a purpoſe fitte:
            The frier was of liuely
            ſprite, and free of ſpeche,
            The Iudges woordes appald him not,
            ne were his wittes to ſeeche.
            But with aduiſed heed,
            a while fyrſt did he ſtay,
            And then with bold aſſured voyce,
            aloude thus gan he ſay.
            My lordes, there is not one
            emong you, ſet togyther,
            So that (affection ſet aſide)
            by wiſdome he conſider
            My former paſſed lyfe,
            and this my extreme age,
            And eke this heauy ſight, the wreke,
            of frantike Fortunes rage,
            But that amaſed much,
            doth wonder at this chaunge,
            So great, ſo ſodainly befalne,
            vnlooked for, and ſtraunge.
            For I, that in the ſpace
            of .lx. yeres and tenne,
            Since firſt I did begin to ſoone
            to leade my lyfe with men,
            
               
And with the worldes vaine thinges
            my ſelfe I did acquaint,
            Was neuer yet, in open place
            at any time attaynt
            With any cryme, in waight,
            as heauy as a ruſhe,
            Ne is there any ſtander by,
            can make me gylty bluſhe,
            (Although before the face
            of God, & doe confeſſe,
            My ſelfe to be the ſinfulſt wretch
            of all this mighty preſſe.)
            When readieſt I am,
            and likelieſt to make
            My great accompt, which no man els
            for me ſhall vndertake:
            When wormes, the earth, and death
            doe cyte me euery howre,
            Tappeare before the iudgement ſeate
            of euerlaſting powre,
            And falling ripe I ſteppe
            vpon my graues brinke:
            Euen then am I moſt wretched wight
            (as eche of you doth thinke.)
            Through my moſt haynous deede,
            with hedlong ſway throwne downe,
            In greateſt daunger of my lyfe,
            and domage of renowne.
            The ſpring, whence in your head,
            this new conceite doth ryſe,
            And in your hart increaſeth ſtill
            your vayne and wrong ſurmiſe:
            May be the hugenes of
            theſe teares of myne (percaſe,)
            That ſo aboundantly downe fall,
            by eyther ſyde my face.
            
               
As though the memory
            in ſcriptures were not kept,
            That Chriſt our ſauiour himſelfe
            for ruth and pittie wept.
            And more whoſo will reade,
            ywritten ſhall he fynde,
            That teares are as true meſſengers
            of mans vngyltie mynde,
            Orels (a liker proofe)
            that I am in the cryme,
            You ſay theſe preſent yrone are,
            and the ſuſpected tyme.
            As though all howres alike
            had not been made aboue,
            Did Chriſt not ſay the day had twelue?
            whereby he ſought to prone,
            That no reſpect of howres,
            ought iuſtly to be had,
            But at all times men haue the choyce
            of dooing good or bad.
            Euen as the ſprite of God,
            the hartes of men doth guyde,
            Or as it leaueth them to ſtray
            from Vertues path aſyde.
            As for the yrons that
            were taken in my hand,
            As now I deeme, I neede not ſeeke,
            to make ye vnderſtande,
            To what vſe yron firſt
            was made, when it began:
            How of it ſelfe it helpeth not,
            ne yet can helpe a man.
            The thing that hurteth, is
            the malice of his will,
            That ſuch indifferent thinges is wont
            to vſe and order yll.
            
               
Thus much I thought to ſay,
            to cauſe you ſo to know,
            That neither theſe my piteous teares,
            though nere ſo faſt they flowe.
            Ne yet theſe yron tooles,
            nor the ſuſpected time,
            Can iuſtly prout the murther donne,
            or damne me of the cryme,
            No one of theſe hath powre,
            ne power haue all the three,
            To make me other then I am,
            how ſo I ſeeme to be.
            But ſure my conſcience
            (if ſo my gylt deſerue)
            For an appeacher, witneſſe, and
            a hangman eke ſhould ſerue.
            For through mine age, whoſe heares,
            of long time ſince were hore,
            And credyt greate that I was in,
            with you in time to fore,
            And eke the ſoiorne ſhort
            that I on earth muſt make,
            That euery day and howre do loke
            my iourney hence to take,
            My conſcience inwardly,
            ſhould more torment me thriſe,
            Then all the outward deadly payne
            that all you could deuyſe.
            But (God I prayſe) I feele
            no worme that gnaweth me,
            And from remorſes pricking ſting,
            I ioy that I am free.
            I meane as touching this,
            wherwith you troubled are,
            Wherwith you ſhould be troubled ſtill
            if I my ſpeche ſhould ſpare.
            
               
But to the end I may
            ſet all your hartes at reſt,
            And plucke out all the ſcrupuls that
            are rooted in your breſt:
            Which might perhappes henceforth
            increaſing more and more
            Within your conſcience alſo,
            increaſe your cureleſſe ſore:
            I ſweare by yonder heauens,
            whither I hope to clym,
            And for a witnes of my woordes,
            my hart atteſteth him,
            Whoſe mighty hand doth welde
            them in their vyolent ſway,
            And on the rolling ſtormy ſeas
            the heauy earth doth ſtay:
            That I will make a ſhort
            and eke a true dyſcourſe
            Of this moſt wofull Tragedy,
            and ſhew both thend and ſourſe
            Of theyr vnhappy death,
            which you perchaunce no leſſe
            Will wonder at, then they (alas)
            poore louers in diſtreſſe,
            Tormented much in mynd
            not forcing liuely breath,
            With ſtrong and patient hart dyd yelde
            themſelfe to cruell death.
            Such was the mutuall loue,
            wherin the burned both:
            And of their promyſt frendſhippes fayth,
            ſo ſtedy was the troth.
            And then the auncient frier
            began to make dyſcourſe,
            Euen from the firſt of Romeus,
            and Iuliets amours.
            
               
How firſt by ſodayn ſight,
            the one the other choſe,
            And twirt them ſelfe dyd knitte the knotte▪
            
            which onely death might loſe.
            And how within a while,
            with hotter loue oppreſt,
            Vnder confeſſions cloke, to him,
            them ſelfe they haue adreſt.
            And how with ſolemne othes
            they haue proteſted both,
            That they in hart are maried
            by promiſe and by othe.
            And that except he graunt
            the rytes of church to geue,
            They ſhalbe forſt by earneſt loue,
            in ſinnefull ſtate to liue.
            Which thing when he had wayde,
            and when he vnderſtoode,
            That the agreement twixt them twaynt
            was lawfull honeſt, good,
            And all thinges peyſed well,
            it ſeemed meete to bee,
            For lyke they were of nobleneſſe,
            age, riches, and degree:
            Hoping that ſo at length,
            ended myght be the ſtryfe,
            Of Montagewes and Capelets,
            that led in hate theyr lyfe.
            Thinking to woorke a woorke
            well pleaſing in Gods ſight,
            In ſecret ſhrift he wedded them,
            and they the ſelfe ſame night
            Made vp the mariage
            in houſe of Capelet,
            As well doth know (if ſhe be aſkt,)
            the nurce of Iuliet.
            
               
He told how Romeus fled,
            for reuing Tybalts lyfe,
            And how the whilſt, Paris the Earle
            was offred to hys wyfe.
            And how the lady dyd,
            ſo great a wrong dyſdayne,
            And how to ſhrift vnto his church
            ſhe came to him agayne:
            And how ſhe fell flat downe
            before his feete aground,
            And how ſhe ſware her hand,
            and blody knife ſhould wound
            Her harmeles hart, except,
            that he ſome meane dyd fynde
            To dyſappoynt the Earles attempt,
            and ſpotles ſaue her mynde.
            Wherfore he doth conclude,
            (although that long before)
            By thought of death, and age, he had
            refuſde for euermore.
            The hidden artes which he
            delighted in, in youth,
            Yet wonne by her importunenes,
            and by his inward ruth,
            And fearing leſt ſhe would
            her cruell vowe dyſcharge,
            His cloſed conſcience he had
            opened and ſet at large.
            And rather did he chooſe
            to ſuffer for one tyme,
            His ſoule to be ſpotted ſomdeale
            with ſmall and eaſy cryme,
            Then that the lady ſhould,
            (wery of liuyng breath)
            Murther her ſelfe, and daunger much
            her ſeely ſoule by death.
            
               
Wherfore, his auncient artes
            agayne he putres in vre,
            A certayne powder gaue he her
            
               
                  〈◊〉
                made her ſlepe ſo ſure,
            That they her held for dead,
            and how that frier Iohn
            With letters ſent to Romeus,
            to Mantua is gone,
            Of whom he knoweth not
            as yet, what is becomme,
            And how that dead he found his frend
            within her kindreds tombe.
            He thinkes with poyſon ſtrong,
            for care the yong man ſterued,
            Suppoſing Iuliet dead, and how,
            that Iuliet hath carued
            With Romeus dagger drawne
            her hart and yelded breath,
            Deſyrous to accompany
            her louer after death.
            And how they could not ſaue
            her, ſo they were afeard,
            And hidde them ſelfe, dreding the noyſe
            of watchmen that they heard.
            And for the proofe of thys
            his tale, he doth deſyer
            The Iudge, to ſend forthwith
            to 
                  ••
               ntus for the fryer,
            To learne his cauſe of ſtay,
            and eke to reade his letter,
            And more beſide, to thend that they
            might iudge his cauſe the better,
            He prayeth them depoſe
            the nurce of Iuliet,
            And Romeus man, whom at vnwares
            beſyde the tombe he met.
            
               
Then Peter not ſo much
            as erſt he was, dyſmayd,
            My lordes (quoth he) too true is all,
            that fryer Laurence ſayd.
            And when my maiſter went
            into my myſtres graue,
            This letter that I offer you,
            vnto me then he gaue.
            Which he himſelfe dyd write
            as I do vnderſtand,
            And charged me to offer them
            vnto his fathers hand.
            The opened packet doth
            conteyne in it the ſame,
            That erſt the ſkilfull frier ſaid,
            and eke the wretches name
            That had at his requeſt,
            the dedly poyſon ſold,
            The price of it, and why he bought,
            his letters playne haue tolde.
            The caſe vnfolded ſo,
            and open now it lyes,
            That they could wiſh no better proofe▪
            
            ſaue ſeeing it with theyr eyes.
            So orderly all thinges
            were tolde and tryed out,
            That in the preaſe there was not one▪
            
            that ſtoode at all in doute.
            The wyſer ſort to councell
            called by Eſcalus,
            Haue geuen aduyſe, and Eſcalus
            ſagely decreeth thus.
            The nurſe of Iuliet,
            is baniſht in her age,
            Becauſe that from the parentes ſhe
            dyd hyde the mariage.
            
               
Which might haue wrought much good,
            hau it in time been knowne,
            Where now by her concealing it,
            a miſcheefe great is growne.
            And Peter, for he dyd
            obey his maſters heſt,
            In woonted freedome had good leaue
            to leade his lyfe in reſt.
            Thapothecary, high
            is hanged by the throte,
            And for the paynes he tooke with him,
            the hangman had his cote.
            But now what ſhall betyde
            of this gray bearded ſyre?
            Of fryer Lawrence thus araynde,
            that good barefooted fryre.
            Becauſe that many times
            he woorthely did ſerue
            The commen welth, and in his lyfe
            was neuer found to ſwerue:
            He was diſcharged quyte,
            and no marke of defame,
            Did ſeeme to blot, or touch at all,
            the honor of his name.
            But of him ſelfe he went
            into an Hermitage,
            Two myles from Veron towne, where he
            in prayers paſt forth his age.
            Tyll that from earth to heauen,
            his heauenly ſprite dyd flye,
            Fyue yeres he liued an Hermite, and
            an Hermite dyd he dye.
            The ſtranngenes of the chaunce,
            when tryed was the truth
            The Montagewes and Capelets
            hath moued ſo to ruth,
            
               
That with their emptyed teares,
            theyr choler and theyr rage,
            Was emptied quite, and they whoſe wrath
            no wiſdom could aſſwage,
            Nor threatning of the prince,
            ne mynd of murthers donne:
            At length (ſo mighty Ioue it would)
            by pitye they are wonne.
            And leſt that length of time
            might from our myndes remoue,
            The memory of ſo perfect, ſound,
            and ſo approued loue.
            The bodies dead remoued
            from vaulte where they did dye,
            In ſtately tombe, on pillers great,
            of marble rayſe they hye.
            On euery ſyde aboue,
            were ſet and eke beneath,
            Great ſtore of cunning Epitaphes,
            in honor of theyr death.
            And euen at this day
            the tombe is to be ſeene.
            So that among the monumentes
            that in Verona been,
            There is no monument
            more worthy of the ſight:
            Then is the tombe of Iuliet,
            and Romeus her knight.

Flete ſtrete within Temble barre, at
the ſigne of the hand and ſtarre, by

Nouember. An. do. 1562.
