            TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE, and my very good Lord, the Lorde Robert Dudley, Earle of Leicester, Baron of Dynghby, Knyght of the honourable order of the Garter, one of the Queenes most honorable priuie counsell, and Maister of her maiesties horsse.
            BECAVSE, bothe by the vniuersall reporte of all men, I heare, and also by myne owne experience I perfectly know (right honourable and my very good lorde) how honorably and cherefully diuers workes presented to your lordship, haue ben accepted: I (though of al others most simple) was thereby encouraged, to offer to your honour this my simple worke, in token of my bounden duty. The exaumple also of that famous

Monarche Artaxerxes, who so wel accepted the simple handfull of water, that the poore Persian Sinetas brought him from the riuer Cyrus, putteth me in good hope, that youre honour who geue place to no man in humanitie and curtesie wil not mislike this simple signifieng of my good wylle. For, like as the mite of that poore widowe that is mencioned in the Gospell, whiche she gaue in all her penurie, is accompted a greater gifte, then those huge sommes that great men layde out of their greate stoare: so ought this my simple pamphlet be adiudged to procede, though not from greater, yet from as great good will, as the best and learnedst writers beare to your honour. For, they, of their abundant stoare, haue laied oute somewhat: But I, of my

meane knowledge, haue presented these few first frutes to your honor: knowing that your wisedome can in this small present right well see my good wyll. My gifte is a short briefe or summarie of the chiefest chances and accidentes, that haue happened in this Realme, frome the tyme of Brutus, to this our age. VVhiche I haue done by the conference of many authors, both old and new, those Imeane, that commonly are called Chroniclers, out of whom I haue gathered many notable thinges, moste worthy of remembrance, whiche no man heretofore hath noted. whiche worke also I was the bolder to dedicate to your honour, because I know your lordships good inclination to al sortes of good knowledges: and especially the great loue that you beare

to the olde Recordes of dedes doone by famous and noble worthies whiche my boldnes, like as I truste your honour wil not only pardon, but also accept in good part: so I besech al the readers hereof, that folowyng your honourable exāple, they will iudge the best of this my trauaile, whiche I toke in hand, onely for the respect that I had to their profite. VVherby they shall both shew the goodnes of their owne natures, and also encourage me willingly to go forwarde in this my enterprise. VVhich doubting not, but that I shall the rather obtaine of them, because of your lordeships fauourable acceptance hereof, I wil now cesse any lōger to trouble your honor, beseching almightie god long to preserue you to the cōmoditie of this our natiue countreie.
            
               Your L. most humble Iohn Stovve.
            
         
         
            
            To the Reader.
            DIuers wryters of Hystories write dyuersly. Some penne their hystories plentifully at large. Some contrary wyse, briefly and shortly doo but (as it were) touche by the way, the remembraunce and accidents of those tymes, of which they write. Some do with a large compasse discouer as wel the affaires done in foreyn partes, as those that hapned in that countrey, of whiche especially they wryte. And some content to let alone other matters, put in memory only such thyngs, as they thē selues haue had experiēce of, in their own coūtreis. Amongs whom, good Reader, I craue to haue place, and desyre roome in the lower part of this table. For I vse thee in this my booke as some symple feaster, that beynge not able of his owne coste to feast his guestes sufficientely, is fayne to bee frended of his neyghboures,

and to sette before them suche dishes as he hath gotten of others. For I acknowledge, that many of the hystories, that thou shalte reade here abridged, are taken, partely out of Robert Fabian, sometyme Alderman of London, Edwarde Halle gentylman of Greyes Inne, Iohn Hardynge, a great trauailer bothe in foreyne countreis, and also in all writynges of antiquitie
                  •
               , and other, who reaped great abundance of knowlege, and filled their bookes full therwith, to the great profite and pleasure of all posteritie, and to their own great fame and glory. So that of their great plenty, I might wel take somewhat to hyde my pouertie
                  •
               . Howbe it, I haue not so doone it, as, if they should clayme theyr own, I shuld forthwith be left naked. For somwhat I haue noted, which I my selfe, partly by paynfull searche, and partly by diligent experiēce, haue found out. Wher fore, hoth the smalnesse of the volume,

which cōprehēdeth gret matters in effect, & lso the noueltie of som matters vttred therin, ought to cause yt it shold not be altogither vnwelcome to thee. For, though it be written homely, yet it is not (as I trust) writē vntruly. And in hystories the chiefe thyng that is to be desyred is truthe. Wherfore, if thou fynde that in it, I beseche thee, wynke at small faultes, or at the least, let the consyderation of my well meanynge, drowne them. So shalt thou both encourage me to farther diligence, and also vtter thyne owne frendlynesse, in that thou doest rather further, then condemne a weake wryter.
            
               Of smoothe and flatterynge speache, remember to take hede:
               For Trouthe in playn wordes may be tolde, of craft a lye hath nede.

            A briefe Description of Englande.
            BEfore I entre to abridge the factes and gestes of the kynges and other persons within this Realme frome Brutus,Polydore Virgil. the fyrste Kyng of the same, I purpose briefely to make a description of this noble Realme gathered out of Polydore Uirgil, reported in his work of ye Englishe hystorie, who saith: That all Britain, which by two names is called England and Scotland, is an Iland in the Ocean sea, sytuate ryghte ouer agaynst the Region of Gallia: one parte of which Isle Englishmen do inhabite, another parte Scottes, the third parte Walshemen, and the fourth part Cornish men. All they, eyther in language, conditions or lawes, doo differ amongs them selues. Englande (so called of Englishemen, whiche dyd winne the same) is the greatest part, which is deuided into .xxxix counties, which we call shyres. Wherof ten (that is to say, Kent, Suffer, Surrey, Southampton, Barkshire, Wyltshire, Dorsetshire, Somersetshire

Deuonshire and Cornwall, do

               s bounding toward the Southe, standeth betweene the Thames and the Sea. Frome thence, to the ryuer of Trent, whiche passeth thorough the myddes of Englād be .xvi. shyres: wherof the first vi. (standyng Estward (are Essex, Midd
                  •
               eser, Hertfordshire, Suffolke, Northfolke, and Cambridgeshire, the other ten which stande more in the myddle of the countrey, are these: Bedford, Huntingdon, Buckingham, Oxford, Northhampton, Rutland, Leicestre, Notyngham, Warwike, and Lyncolne. After these, there be .vi. whiche border westeward vpon Wales, as Glocestre, Hereforde, Worcester, Salop, Stafford, and Chester. Aboute the myddle of the Region lie Darbyshyre, Yorkshyre, Lancashyre, & Cumbreland. On the left hande toward the west is Westmerlande. Agaynste the same, is the Byshopryke of Durham, and Northumberland, which boūdeth vpon the northe in the marches of Scotland. Those shyres be diuided in to .xvii. Bishop rickes, which by a greke word, be called Dioeceses. Of which Dioeceses, Canturburye and Rochester, bee

in Kēt. Essex, Middlesex & part of Hertford, belongeth to the bishoprike of London. The bishop of Chicester hath Suffer. Wynchester, hathe Hampshire, Surrey, and the Isle of Wight.
            
               Salesbury, hath Dorsetshire, Barkshyre, and Wylteshire.
            
               Excetor, hath Deuonshire, & Cornwall. Bathe, and Welles, hath Somersetshyre. Worcester, hath Glocestershyre,Now at thys presente there is a byshop of Glocester. Worcestershyre, and part of Warwikeshire. Hereforde, hath parte of Shropshire, and Herefordshire.
            
               Couentre, and Lichfelde, Staffordeshyre, and thother parte of Warwikshire. Chestre, hath Cheshire, Darbyshire, & a piece of a Lancashyre, nere the ryuer of Kepel. The Diocesse of Lincolne,
               Ther is now a byshoppe at Peterborow. which is the greatest, hath eight shyres, lieng betweene thei Thames and Humbre, as Lincolne, Northampton, Leycester, Rutlande, Huntingdon, Bedforde, Buckyngham, Oxford & the residue of Hertfordshire. The byshoprike of Ely, hath Cantabridgeshire, & the Isle of Ely Suffolke, and Norffolke, be in the circuite of Norwiche Diocesse. And thys is the Prouynce of the Archebyshop of Canterburye,

whyche is the primate of all England, wyth Wales, whyche hathe iiii. diocesses, as hereafter shall be declared. The byshop of Yorke, hath Yorkeshyre, Notynghamshyre, and a piece of Lancastshyre. The byshop of Durham, hath the bishoprike so commonly called, and Northumberland. Carlisle, conteineth Cumberlande and Westmerland: And this is the other prouince of tharch byshop of Yorke, whiche is another prymate of England, & was of long tyme also primate of all Scotlande: but these Diocesses take theyr names of the cities where those seas be placed. The chiefe wherof, is London, where in the beginnyng was the Archebyshops sea: but afterwardes transposed to Canterbury, a Citie in Kent, placed in a soyle amiable and pleasant. London, standethe in Middlesex, on the northside of the Thamis. That moste excellent and goodly ryuer, beginneth a little aboue a village called Winchelcombe in Oxfordshyre, styll increasyng, and passeth fyrst by the vniuersitie of Oxēford, & so with a meruailous quiete course by London, and and then breaketh into the frenche Ocean by mayne tydes, whyche twyse in

xxiiii. howers space doth ebbe and flowe more then .lx. myles, to the great cōmoditie of trauailers, by whiche all kyndes of marchandise bee easylye conueyde to London, the principall store and staple for all cōmodities within this Realme. Uppon the same ryuer is placed a stone bridge,London brydge. a woorke very rare and meruailous, whyche brydge hathe .xx. arches made of .iiii. squared stone, of height .lx. foote, and of breadth .xxx. foote, distant one from an other .xx. foote, compacte & ioyned together with vaultes and Sellars. Upon bothe sydes be houses buylded, that it seemeth rather a continuall streete then a brydge. The Ocean sea doothe bounde Englande, the fyrst part of Britain east and South, Wales, and Cornewall west. The ryuer of Twede deuideth England and Scotland north. The length of the Island begynneth at Portsmouth in the South part, and endeth at Twede in the north, conteinyng 320. myles. This Realme aboue other is moste fruitfull on this syde Humbre: for beyonde, it is fuller of mountaynes. And althoughe to the beholders of that countrey a far of, it may seme playn, yet it is full of many hylles, and those for

the moste part voyde of trees: the valeys wherof be very delectable, inhabited for the most part by noble men, who accordyng to auncient and olde ordre, desyre not to dwell in Cities, but neere vnto valleys and ryuers in seueral vyllages: for aduoidyng of vehement wyndes, because that Ilande naturally is stormye. Humbre hath his beginnyng a little on this side York, & by & by runneth southward, & thē holdeth his course eastward & so into the mayn sea, greatly increaced by the ryuers of Dune & Trent. Trent beginneth a lyttle from Stafforde, runnyng through Darbyshyre, and Leycestershyre, passing by Lichfield and Notyngham on the ryght hand, and Dune on the lefte: so that bothe those ryuers dooe make an Ilande, whyche is called Aurolme, and then ioynyng together on this syde Kyngston vpon Hull, a goodly marchant towne, they falle into Humbre: by whych ryuer they may aryue out of France, Germanie, and Denmarke. England is fruitefull of beastes, and aboundeth with cattell: wherby thinhabitātes be rather for the most Grasiers, then ploughmē because they geue them selues more to fedyng, then to tyllage.

So that almoste the thyrde parte of the countrey is imployed to cattell, dere red and fallow, gores (wherof there be store in the northe partes, & conyes, for euery where there is ioly maintenāce of those kyndes of beastes: because it is fulle of greate woddes, wherof there ryseth pastyme of huntyng greatly exercised, specially by the nobilitie and gentlemen.
            Of Scotland, an other parte of Britayn, I purpose to say nothyng because I haue promised onely and briefly to remembre thaffaires of myne owne countrey, as beste trauailed and acquainted with the knowledge of the same.
            Wales, the .iiii. part of Britayne lyeth vpon the lefte hand: whiche like a Promontarie or forelande, or an Isle (as it were) on euery syde it is compassed with the mayne sea: excepte it be on the easte parte with the Ryuer of Sabrine commonly called Seuerne, whiche deuideth Wales from England. Although some late writers affirme Hereforde to bee a bound betwene Wales and England, & say, that Wales begynneth at Chepstolle, where the Ryuer Ueye augmented wyth an other ryuer called Lugge, passyng by Hereforde dooth runne into

the sea: which riuer riseth in the myddle of Wales out of that hill (but vncertain whether oute of that sprynge) that Sabrine dothe,Cornelius Tacitus. whiche Corn. Tacitus calleth Antona. For euen to that place there goth a great arme of the sea,This arme of the sea, as I Iudge, is nowe called Anste, where is a passage betwene the village of Anste and Chepstoll. which passyng through the land westward: on the right hande leaueth Cornewall, and on the left, Wales. Whiche Topography or description, although it be newe, yet I thoughte good to folowe. Therefore Wales is extended frome the towne of Chepstol, where it beginneth almost by a straight line a lytle aboue Shrowsbury, euē to Westchester northward. Into that part, so many of the Britains as remayned alyue after the slaughter and losse of their countrey, at the length beyng dryuen to theyr shyftes, dyd repaire as ancient writings report: where partly through refuge of the mountaines, & partly of the woddes and marshes, they remained in safetie: which part they enioy euen to this daye. That lande afterwardes the englyshe men dyd call Wales: and the Britaius the inhabitauntes of the same, Walshmen: for amonges the Germaynes, Walsman, signifieth a strāger, an alien, an outborn or strange

man: that is, suche a one, as hath a contrarye language from theirs, for Wall, in their tongue is called a stranger born as an Italian or Frencheman: whyche differ in speeche from the Germane.
            Man, signifieth Homo, which is a mā in english. Therfore englishmen, a people of Germany, after they had wōne Britain called the Britains, which escaped after ye destructiō of their cuntrey, after their countrey maner. walshmen, because they had an other tong or spech, besides theirs, & the land which they inhabited, Wales, which name afterwardes both to the people and contrey dyd remayn. By this meanes the Britaynes with theyr kyngedome loste their name. But they whiche affirme that name to be deriued of their kyng or queene without doubte be deceiued. The countrey soyle towardes the sea coaste, and in other places in the valleys and playnes, is most fertile, which yeldeth bothe to man and beaste, great plentie of fruite and grasse: but in other places for the moste parte it is bareyne and lesse fruitfull, because it lacketh tyllage: for whiche cause husbandmen do lyue hardly, eating Oten cakes and drinkyng milke myxte with water,

and sowre whay. There be many townes and strong castels, and .iiii. Bishoprikes, if the byshoprike of Hereforde be coūted in England, as ye late writers declare. The fyrst byshoprike is Meneue, so called of Meneua, whiche at this day they call Sainct Dauids, a Citie very auncient, situated vpon the sea coast, and boūdeth westward toward Ireland. An other is Landaeffe, the thirde Bangor, and the fourthe All Saint Asaph. whiche, be vnder Tharchbyshoppe of Canterburye. The walshmen haue a language from thenglishmen, which as they say, that fetche their Petigree frome the Troianes, do the partly sounde of the Troian antiquitie, and partly of the Greeke. But how soever it is, the walshemen do not pronounce their speache so pleasantely and gentilly as thenglyshmen dooe, because they speake more in the throte: & contrary wise thenglishemen rightly folowynge the Latines, do expresse theyr voyce somewhat within the lyps, which to the hearers semeth pleasant & swete: And thus much of wales, the third part of Britaine.
            Nowe foloweth the fourthe and laste parte of Britayne, named Cornewall.

This part beginneth on that syde whiche standeth toward Spayn westward: Toward theast, it is of bredth .iiii. score and tenne myles, extendyng a lyttle beyonde saynt Germains, which is a very famous village situated on the right hand vpon the sea coast, where the greatest breadth of that countrey is but .xx. myles: for thys parcell of lande on the right hand is compassed with the coaste of the mayne sea: and on the left hande with that arme of the sea, whiche (as before is declared) parteth the lande, and runneth vp to Chepstoll: where the coū
               trey is in fourme of a Horne: For at the fyrst, it is narowe, and then growethe broader, a little beyonde the said towne of saint Germaine. Eastwarde it bordreth vpon England, West, south, and Northe, the mayne sea is rounde about it: It is a very barreyn soyle, yeldynge fruite more through trauaile of the tyllers and husband men, thē through the goodnes of the groūd. but there is great plentie of leade and tyn: in the myning and dyggyng wherof doth specially consist the liuynge & sustentation of thinhabitants. In this only parte of Britayn,

euen to this daye continueth the nation of the Britaines, whiche in the begynnynge brought out of Gallia occupied & inhabited that Ilande, (yf credite maye be geuen to them, whyche reporte the firste inhabitantes of Britaine to come out of the Cities of Armerica.) The argumēt & profe wherof, is because ye Cornishmen do speake ye langage, which the Britains vse now in France, whom the Britons do cal Britonātes. This thing to be more true, an old ancient chronicle dothe declare, wherin I found written, not Cornubia, but Cornugallia, compounded of Cornu, a horne, the forme wherof that countrey hath, and of Gallia, out of which contrey thinhabitantes came fyrst, the maner of which name is not to be mislyked. Their tongue is farre dissonant from englishe, but is muche like to the Walshe tongue, because they haue many wordes cōmune to both tonges: yet thys difference there is betwene them, when a walsheman speaketh the Cornyshe man rather vnderstandeth many woordes spoken by the Walshman, then the hole tale he telleth. whereby it is manyfest, that those thre people dooe vnderstande one an other in like maner

as the Southerne Scottes doo perceiue and vnderstand the Northern. But it is a thyng very rare and meruailous, that in one Iland there should be such varietie of speches. Cornewall or Cornugall is in the Diocesse of Excetour, whyche was ones woorthye to bee counted the fourth part of the Iland, as well for the contrarietie of language as for the fyrst inhabitantes thereof, as is beforesayde. Afterwardes, the Normans which constituted a kyngdom of all those thre partes reckned Cornewall to bee one of the counties or shires of the contrey. Thus muche of the particular descryption of Britayne, that the whole bodye of the realm (by the membres) may be the better knowen to some peraduenture that neuer heard the same before.
            The forme of the Iland is triquetra. or thre cornered, hauyng three corners, or three sydes: Two wherof, that is to say: The corner toward theast, and thother toward the weast: (bothe extending northwardes) are the longest.
            The third syde whiche is the south syde is farre shorter then thother: for the Iland is greater of length then of bredth. And as in the other two partes is conteyned

the lengthe, euen so in the laste, the breadth. In whyche place, the breadthe begynneth: and so continuyng from the South parte to the north, it is but narowe. The fyrste and ryght corner of whyche Ilande eastwarde, is in Kente, at Douer and Sandwyche.
            From whence to Caleys or Boloygne in France, is the dystance of .xxx. myles. From this Angle which is agaynst Fraunce to the thyrde Angle, whyche is in the Northe, in Scotlande, the mayne whereof, boundeth vpon Germany, but no land seene, and there the Iland is lyke vnto a wedge euen at the very angle of the land in Scotland. The length wherof is .vii. hundreth myles. Agayne, the lengthe from this Corner at Douer in Kent, to the vttermost part of Cornewall, beynge saynt Myghels mount (whych is the west part or weste angle) is supposed to bee .300. myles.
            Frō this left Angle beyng the west part and thuttermoste parte of Cornewall, whiche hath a pros
                  •
               ect towards Spain, in whyche part also standeth Irelande, sytuated betwene Britayne and Spayn to the northe angle in the further parte of Scotlande, in which part the Ilande

doth end, the lēgth is .viii. hundred miles, in whiche parte there be very good hauens, and saufe harboroughes for shyppes, and apt passage into Ireland, beyng not past one day saylyng, but the shorter passage is from Wales, to Waterforde, a towne in Ireland vppon the sea coast, muche lyke to that passage betwene Douer and Calaice, or som what more: but ye shortest passage of all, is out of Scotlande. From this last Angle to Hampton: (whiche is a towne vpon the sea coast, with a hauen so called toward the southe, and therefore called Southhampton) betwene the Angles of Kent and Cornewall, they doo measure by a strayght lyne the whole lengthe of the Ilande, and doo say, that it conteyneth 800. myles, as the breadth from Meneua, or Saint Dauids to Yarmouth, whiche is in the vttermost part of the Iland towardes the East doth conteyn .200. miles for the breadth of the Iland is in the southe part, which part is the front and begynnyng of the Land, and endeth narow, or as it were in a straighte. So the circuit or compasse of the Iland is .xviii. C. myles, which is .200. lesse than Caesar doothe recken or accompt.
            
               Thus muche I haue thought good to take out of Polydore, touchynge the diuision of England, with the forme and situation of the same. Much other good matter that author doth alledge, whiche here for breuitie I doo omitte, referring those that desyre to know farther herof, to that boke: where he shall fynde the style and story bothe pleasant and profitable.

wherein he placed an Archeflamyn. He deuided the same Iland among his thre sonnes:He stablyshed the Troian lawes in thys kyngdome. vnto Locrine he gaue the midle part of Britayn, now called Englande, with the superioritie of al this Ile: Unto Camber he gaue Wales, and to Albanact Scotland: After whiche partition he deceassed, when he had reigned xxiiii. yeres, and was buried at London, then called new Troy, as is aforesayd.

sayd Guendolyn, and wedded Estrylde, but Gwendolyn repaired to Cornwall, where she gathered a great power, and fought with king Locryn, and siue him: he was buryed at Troynouant. She drowned the ladye Estrylde wyth her doughter Sabrine in a ryuer,Howe the ryuer of Seuerne tooke that name. that after the yong maydens name, is called Seuerne.
            Gwendolyne the daughter of Corineus,1063 and wyfe to Locryne (for so much as Madan her sonne was to yong to gouerne the land) was by common assent of all the Britaynes,The Queene reigned durynge the mynoritie of her sonne. made ruler of the whole Isle of Britayn, whiche she well and discretely ruled, to the comforte of her subiectes .xv. yeares, and then lefte the same to her sonne Madan.

In London, called then Troy Nouant, he buylded a great Temple: whiche some suppose to be S. Paules, some Blackwell Hall, whiche was called Templum pacis. Finally when he had brought this Ralme to wealthe and quietnes, reygnyng herein .xl. yeares: He dyed honourably, leauing after hym two valiant and noble sonnes Belinus

Unto the other the North part beyond Humber. But Brennus a young man, desyrous of glory and dominion, thinking hym selfe equall with his brother in marciall prowes, was not therewith content: Wherfore he raised war agaynste Belyne. But in conclusion by the meanes of their mother they were accorded, and Brennus brynge geuen wholly to the study of warres, lefte his countrey to the gouernance of his brother, and went into Fraunce amongest the Galles: where in the Prouince of Lions, for his excellēt qualities, he was greatly estemed of Siguinus kynge of the countrey, whose daughter he maried: And of the Galles was made Souerain captain whē they made their vsage

to Rome. Belyne in the meane tyme both in ciuile iustyce and also religyon,Iohn. Hardynge. suche as at that tyme was vsed, greatly increased his Realme. He made three Archeflames,Three archeflames in Englande. whose seas were at London, Yorke, and Carlion.Foure notable wayes made in Englande.

Fynally, after he had reigned with his brother and alone .xxvi. yeres, he died: and after the pagan maner, with great pompe was burned: & his ashes in a vessell of brasse set on a high Pynacle ouer Belyns gate (as saith Robert Fabyan) he builded Carlion,Carlyon buylded. and also the temple of concorde,The old temple nexe to tē

And then Octauius (called in the Englishe Chronicles Octauian) reigned in this lande at the leaste liiii. yeares. In whiche tyme (as sayth the Scottishe historie) he was troubled with often warres by the Romaines:Ector Boice.

               283MAximus, sonne of Leonine, and cousyn germaine to Constantine the great, was made kyng of britayne. Thys man was mightye of hys handes: but for that he was cruell, and pursued somedeale the Christians, hee was called Maximus the tyraunt. Betwene hym, and one Conon Meridoke a Britayn, was a stryfe and debate, in whiche they both sped dyuersly: but at at length they wer made frends. Maximus reigned .viii. yeares.
            
               Maximus cō
                  quered lyttle Britayn.Maximus, kynge of Britayne made warre vpon the Galles, and sayled into Armerica, now called litle Britayn: and subduyng the countreye, gaue it to Conon Meridoke, to hold for euer of the kynges of great Britayn.
            Maximus, was constrayned of the souldiours, to take on hym the imperiall crowne: & therfore beyng in France passed further into the lands of the empire, & subdued a great part of France,

and all Germanie. Gratian the Emperour of hym was put to flight at Paris and slayne at Lyons.
            Whyles Maximus was occupied in the warres in Italye, Melga kynge of Pictes, and Guanius captayne of the Hunnes, vexed the Britayns. Wherof when Maximus had vnderstandynge, he sente a captaine named Gratian to withstande their force.
            Saint Ursula,S. Ursula of Englande. with the .11000. Uirgins, whiche were sent into little Britayne to be maried to the foresayde Conon and his knyghtes: wer slayn of the barbarous people beynge on the sea.
            Forthwith the foresaid Gratian that was sent into Britayne of Maximus,391 to defende the land from Barbariens, toke on hym the kyngdom of Britayn, and exercised all tyranny and exaction vppon the people: for whiche cause hee was abhorred of all the Britaynes: and by theym was slayne, when he hadde reygned fower yeares. Then was the Realme a good space wythoute heade or gouernoure: In the whyche tyme they were nowe and then very muche vexed wyth the foresayde Barbarous

people, and other foreyne enemies.
            
               The Scotts and Picts inuade EnglādNere about the yeare of Christ .427. the Britaynes were inuaded agayne by the Pictes and Scots: which not withstandynge the foresayde wall that was made by the Romanes, spoyled the coū
               trey very sore, so that they were dryuen to seke for newe helpe of the Romanes: who sent to them a company of souldiors: which agayn chased the Picts, and made a wall of stone of the thicknes of viii. foot,A walle of stone betwene England and Scotlande. & in height .xii. foote. Which thing when they had done, comfortyng the britones, and admonishynge them hereafter to trust to their own māhod & strēgth, they returned agayn to Rome.
            The Scottes and Pyctes yet once agayne entred the lande of Britayne, spoylynge the countreye, and chasyng the commons so cruelly, that they were altogether comfortelesse, and broughte to suche myserie, that eche robbed and spoyled other: and ouer this, the groūde was vntylled: whereof ensued greate scarcitie and hunger, and after hunger deathe.The Scottes and Picts inuaded this realme so sore, that the Romains refused to defende the same: but rather to lose theyr Trybute. In thys necessitie they sente for ayde to Aetius, the Romayne capitayne, beynge then occupied in warres in a parte of Fraunce: but they had no

comfort at his hand. And therfore wer forced to send ambassade to Aldroenus, kynge of little Britayne, to desyre ayde and comforte: whiche they obteyned, in condition, that if they atchieued the victorie,Beda de gestis Anglorū. Constantine his brother shold be made king of britayn: for to that day they had no gouernour. Which thyng of the Ambassadours beyng graunted, the sayd Constantine gathered a companye of souldiors, and went forth with them. And when he had manfully vanquished theyr enemies, obteined the victorie: accordynge to the promise made, he was ordeyned their kynge, and guyded this land .x. yeres.
            Here endeth fynally the dominion & tribute of the Romans ouer this lande, whiche had contynued by the space of 483. yeares, from the tyme that Brute began to rule this lande .1541. After the citie of Rome was builded .1585. yeres.
            THen it folowed,433 that when Constantine brother of Aldroenus, had chased and ouercome the Pictes and Scots (as is beforesaid) he was crowned kynge of great Britayne and guyded the lande the space of .x. yeares

in quietnes.
            In the courte of Constantyne kynge of Britayn was a certayne Picte, in so greate fauoure and authoritie with the kyng,The kynge slayne in hys chamber by a Picte. that he myght at all tymes come to his presence: who watchynge hys tyme, by secrete meanes trayterouslye slewe the kyng in his chamber.
            
               443Then Constantius hys eldest sonne, whyche for his lofte spirite, was made monke at saincte Swithens in Wynchester,A Monke made kyng of Englande. by the means of Uortiger, duke of Cornwal, was taken out of the cloister, and made king: vnder whose name the foresayd Uortiger ruled all the land and vsed great tyrannye.
            Constantius, kyng of Britayn, was slayne of certayne Pictes or Scottes,The kynge traiterousely slayne by certaig Pictes. whom Uortiger had ordeined for a gard to the kynges bodye. Whereof when Uortiger had knowledge, he wept and made semblaunt of greate sorowe and heauynes: and caused the sayd Scottes or Pictes to be put to deathe, thoughe he in dede were the chief causer of their treason and murder. So this Constantius reigned but .v. yeares: And Aurelius and Uther, the kynges younger

brethren, fled into little Britayn.
            Uortiger was by force ordeined king of Britayne,448 and gouerned the realme .xvi. yeares, not without trouble. For the nobles of Britayne suspected, that Constantius was not murthered with out hys consent: And therfore alienated their myndes from hym.
            In Britayne was so great plentie of corne and fruite,Great plentie of Corne and grayne. that the lyke had not ben seen many yeares before. Whiche plentie was cause of idlenes, gluttony, lechery, and other vices: so that through their incontinent and riottous lyuyng, ensued so great pestilence and mortalitie,A great pestilence. that the lyuynge scantely suffised to bury the dead.
            The Pictes and Scotts also, hauing knowledge of the death of their knightes, whyche were slayne by Uortiger, for murderyng of the kynge:The Scots & Pictes spoyled this land. inuaded, and in most cruell wise spoyled the land of Britayne.
            Uortiger beyng sore abashed, for so muche ashe knewe the myndes of hys people to be alienated from hym (after some mens opinion) sente for the Saxons, named Angli, whiche had no place to dwel in: & gaue to them inhabitāce in

Kent.The fyrste Saxons entryng thys realme. By their helpe and manhoode in many batails, he vanquished and droue back the Pictes and other enemies: and therefore had them euer after in greate loue and fauour.
            Hengist, one of the captaines of the Saxons founde meanes that Uortiger kynge of Britayne maryed his daughter Rowan,Kyng Uortiger deuorced from his laufull wyfe, and maryed Rowan, ye daughter of Hengist the Saxon. a mayden of wonderfulle beautie and pleasauntnesse, but a myscreant and Pagane. For her sake, the kynge was deuorced frome his laufull wyfe: by whome he hadde .iii. sonnes. For whiche dede welnere all the Britones forsooke hym: and the Saxons daily encreased bothe in fauoure multitude and auctoritie: and from this tyme sought alwaye occasyon to extinguyshe vtterly the power of the britayns: and subdue the lande to them selfe.
            The Saxons couenanted with the Britons, that they shold attend to their worldly busynes: and the Saxons (as their souldiors) would defend the lande from the incursions of all enemies: for which seruice the Britains should geue to them competent meate and wages. And vnder thys pretence caused more Saxons to bee sent for, entendyng at

conueniente tyme, by force to haue the lande in their subiection.
            Sainct Germain came into Britayn to reduce them from the heresye of Pelagius,Pelagius heresy in Englande. to the fayth of Christe.
            The britayns consyderyng the daily repaire of the Saxons into this realm, shewed to their kyng, the ieopardy that might therof ensue, and aduertised him to auoyde the danger, and expell them out of the realme: but all was in vayn. For Uortiger, by reason of his wyfe, bore suche fauour towards the Saxons that he would in no wise heare the coū
               cell of hys subiectes.Uortiger depriued of hys kyngdome. Wherefore they with one wyll and mynde depriued him of his royall dignitie, and ordeyned to theyr Kynge, hys eldeste soonne Uortimerus.
            VOrtimer (as before is sayde) beyng made king,464 The king poisoned by his stepmother. in all hast he pursued the Saxons: and by his marciall knyghthode, vanquyshed theim in iiii. greate battailes, besydes conflictes and skirmyshes. Untyll at lengthe he was poysoned by meane of Rowen his stepmother, after hee had reygned .vii. yeares.
            Uortiger obteyned agayn the kyngdome

of great Britayne,471 and reygned after this tyme .ix. yeares. But shortly after, Hengistus (whiche was chased of Uortimer into the Isle of Thanet, entred the land with a nūbre of Saxons: but when he hearde of the great assemble, that the britons made against him, be treated for peace: which in fyne was concluded.
            
               Hardyng sayeth the Saxons slewe on the Playne of Salisburye iiii. C. and ix. barones and Erles, & toke the kyngeprisoner. The Saxons in Britayne, by priuy guyle and treason, got the kyng Uortiger into theyr handes, and kept hym as prisoner: and by that meanes constreyned the Kynge to graunte vnto theym thre countreys in the land of britayne: (that is to say) Kent, Susser, Suffolke, and Norffolke. Than Hengist beganne his dominion ouer Kent: and sendynge for mo saxons, to inhabite the other prouinces:Abbot Ambry buylded Ambresbury. shortly after made warre vpon the Britayns: and so chased them, that he kept his kyngdome of Kent in peace and warre .xxiiii. yeares.
            Uortiger fled into Wales, and there buylded a castell. Of whiche buildyng and longe lette of the same, and of his prophete Merlyn, the common voyce of the people speaketh many thynges.
            
               Aurelie surnamed Ambrose, and Uther, the brethern of Constantius king of brittayne: whiche was slayne by the treason of Uortiger, landed with a Nauye of shyppes at Totnes: and by the healpe of britaynes,Kyng Uortiger burned in his castell in Wales. whyche gathered to them in all haste, made warre vppon Uortiger, and burned him in his castell in Wales, where he kepte hym for hys moste sure defence.
            Aurelius Ambrose,481 was ordeyned kynge of Britayne, whyche immediatlye hasted hym wyth an army towards Yorke, against Octa sonne of Hengist, who wyth hys saxons kepte the Citie, where he discomfited, and tooke prisoner the sayd Octa.

               218In the ende of Aurelie hys reygne, Pascentius, the yongest sonne of Uortiger: who for feare of Aurelius fled into Irelande, inuaded this lande with a great armie: at which season Aurelius was sicke at Wynchester. And therfore sent his brother Uther, to resyst the malice of Pascentius, & Guillamour king of Irelande. In the meane tyme Aurelius dyed (as some write) beyng poysoned: whan he had reigned .xix. yeares.

Britayne, and gouerned the land .xxvi. yeares, hauynge continuall warre and mortall battayle with the Saxons. Of this Arthure be written many thynges in the Englishe chronicle, of small credence, and farre discordant from other writers: but yet all agree, that he was a noble and victorious prince in all his dedes
                  •
                and they testifie, that he fought xii. notable battailes agaynst the Saxons, and was alway victour. But notwithstanding he might not clerely void them out of his land, but that they held theyr countreys whyche they were possessed of.

            The fourthe kyngdome of the weste Saxons beganne in Britayne,The fowerth kyngdome of the Saxons. vnder a Saxon called Cerdicus. They landed first at an hauē in Norffolk called Yarmouth. With this Saxon Cerdicus, & his people, Arthure had muche trouble and warre. This lordshyp cōteyned the west part of Englande, as Wylshire, Somersetshire, Barkshire, Dorsetshire and other.
            
               Arthure, when after many and dyuers battailes, he hadde sette his lande in some quietnes: he betooke the rule thereof to hys nephewe Mordred,Galfride. and with a chosen army (as saithe Galfride and other) sayled into Fraunce, where he dyd meruaylous thynges, and vanquyshed Lucius Hibertus, the Romain Capytayne, whyche thyng semeth not to agree with other histories.

Wherfore by the ordinance of God, he was taken with the euil called Ficus, and was ther of sycke a longe space. The fyrste yeare of his reign in sundry places, he fought vi. tymes with the Danes: by meanes whereof his people were so weakened, that he was glad to make peace wyth his enemies.

in his floryshing youthe was some deale geuen to the luste of the flesshe: whyche he afterwarde greuousely repented.
            
               Good lawes made agaynst quaffyng and alehouses.In his tyme as well the Danes as all other people in Englande, vsed the vice of great drinking: The kyng therfore rode through the realme, and put downe many alehouses, and would suffer but one in a village or town, except it were a great borough: and ordeined certayne cuppes with pynnes and nailes. and made a lawe, that who soeuer dranke past that marke at one draught shoulde forfayt a certayne payn: wherof the accuser should haue the one half, and the ruler of the Towne the other halfe.

               978EGelrede, or Etheldrede, the sonne of kyng Edgar and Alphrede, was ordeyned kynge of Englande,The kynge crowned at Kyngston. and crowned at Kingstoune. He was goodly of shape and visage: but wholly geuē to idlenes, and abhorred all princely exercises: a louer of ryotte, lecherie, and dronkennes, and vsed extreme cruelty towardes his subiectes: hauyng his eares open to all vniust complaintes. In feates of armes of all men moste ignorant: his crueltie made hym odious to his subiects: and his cowardise encoraged straunge ennemies to inuade his kyngdome. By meanes whereof, thys lande was sore afflicted with warre, famyne, and pestilence. In his tyme decayed the noble kyngdom of England,Englande became tributary to the Danes: and: became tributarie to the Danes: whereby the Danes, when they had spent the sayd tribute, fel streight again to robberye, and arryued in sundry places of Englande: as in the Isle of Thenet,

In Cornewall and Sussex: and after many damages by them done, and ryche gyftes receaued of the Kynge, they retourned into theyr countreye for a tyme.The Danes besieged London. But shortly they agayn entred this lande in so many places, that the kynge Etheldrede was to seeke, to whiche coast he should fyrst go to withstande hys enemies. In conclusyon for aduoydyng of further daunger, he was compelled to appeare them with great summes of money: but when the money was spente, they fell to newe robbyng, and cessed not to spoyle the land: and lastly besieged Lōdon. And to augment the kyngs sorow, Elphricus that then was admirall of England, traiterously fledde to the Danes. And after beyng reconciled, fledde to them the seconde tyme?
            While this cruel warre continued in England, by meane of a byshop named Elphegus, a peace was concluded: at whiche tyme (as Polidore wytnesseth) the kynge made his lande tributarie to the Danes:Great tribute sayd to the Danes the payment wherof, from the summe of ten thousand poundes, in few yeres, was raised to fifty thousand.
            
               The bloudy flixe, the burnyng feuer wyth dyuers other maladies vexed the people throughout all Englande.
            Etheldred kyng of England, toke to wyfe Emma, the syster of Rycharde Duke of Normandie: whyche for her beautie, was called the Flower of Normandie. Etheldrede beyng greatly inhanced in his mynd for this his mariage, sent forth into al partes of his realme secrete and strayght cōmissions, chargyng the rulers, that vppon a certayne day and hower assygned,The Danes sodeynly murdered & slayne the Danes (whiche proudely vsed great crueltie in the land) should be sodeinly slayn, and so was if doone. Which thyng was after cause of great misery: For Swain kyng of Denmark hearyng of the murder of the Danes, and beynge sore moued therwith, landed with a strong armye in dyuers partes of thys realme:A great number of Danes aryue in thys lande and so cruelly without mercy and pity, spoyled the countreye, and slue the people: that the englysh men wer brought to mooste extreeme and vnspeakable mysery. But yet after & certayne space a peace was intreated: For whyche the Englyshemen payde thirtye thousande

poundes. Howbeit dyuers princes of the Danes styll continued wastynge the lande in dyuers places.
            Swayn kyng of Denmarke repented of the former couenāts, made with the englyshmen: & thinkyng to attayne to the whole dominiō of this land: with a strong army entred fyrste Northumberland, than myddle England: and so wente foorthe tyll he came to London,London besiged by the Danes whyche he besieged, and destroyed the countrey of Kent. At this tyme Egelrede the kyng despairyng of all recouerie (not ones proferynge to resyste his ennemies, with his wyfe and children fledde to Richard duke of Normandy: & then possessed Swayn ye hole kingdom of this realm: who spoiled the landes of s Edmunds. But after his death succeded Canutus his sonne: who inclosed ye same with a depe dyche: and graūted to the inhabitantes therof, great fredom. And after builded a church ouer ye place of his sepulture, and ordeined there an house of monkes, enduyng them with fayre possessiōs. And after it was vsed ye kings of Englād, whē thei wer crouned sent for: an offering their crounes vnto

S. Edmondes shryne,S: Edmondes Burye buylded and redemed the same with a good price. The englyshe men sente agayne for Etheldred out of Normandye, who by the healpe of the Normans, and present assistance of his commons, expelled Canutus. but shortly Canutus returned agayne into Englande, where he spared nothynge that myght be destroyed with sworde & fyre. In whiche tyme king Etheldred ended his lyfe, when he had reigned .xxxviii. yeares, and was buried in the Northe Isle of Paules churche in London, aboue the aultar. Fabian saythe, that in the seconde yeare of this kynges reigne a great part of the citie of London was wasted with fyre:A great fire in London but how it beganne, hys aucthor telleth not. But ye shal vnderstand, that this day, the citie of London had moste housyng and buyldynge from Ludgate towarde Westminster: and littell or none where the chiefe or hart of the citie is now, except in diuers places was housynge, but they stoode without order. So that many townes & cities, as Cāterbury, York, and dyuers other in Englande, passed London in buyldyng at those dayes, as I haue sene

(sayth Fabyan) by an old boke, somtime in the Guyld halle of London, named Domes daye.A boke in the Guylde hall of London named domes daye But after the conquest it increased, and shortly after passed and excelled all the other. Aboute the .viii. yeare of this kyngs reign, dyed Ethelwald byshop of Wynchester, who was born in Wynchester, and ther buylded an abbey of Nunnes (as sayth Fabyan.
            AFter ye deth of Etheldred,1016 great variance fell betwene ye englishe mē for the election of theyr kyng, for ye citezens of London with certayn other named Edmund the son of Etheldred,Edmūd with the Iron syd

                a yong man of lusty and valiant courage in martiall aduentures both hardy and wyse, and one that could very well endure all paynes: Wherefore hee was surnamed Ironsyde: but the more part fauored Canutus the Dane. By meanes wherof betwene those two princes were foughten many great battayles: in the which either party sped diuersly, to the great slaughter of thē that toke their partes. But lastly, it was agreed, that the two Captayns shold try theyr quarell betwene them selues onely. In

which fight,1038 although Edmund semed to haue the vpper hand: yet be condiscē
               ded to deuyde the realm and make Canutus felow with him in the kingdom: whyche agreement was at laste concluded.
            In this tyme there was an englishe Earle called Edricus, which by hys falshode had wrought muche hurte to hys naturall country, and lastelye was aucthor of the deth of the noble Edmund.Kynge Edmunde slayne with a speare thrust vp into his foundment as he sat on a priuy And therof himself brought fyrst knowledge to Canutus the Dane, sayinge in this wyse: Thus haue I doone Canutus for the loue of thee. To whom hee answered, sayinge: For my loue thou hast murdered thyne owne soueraigne Lord, whome I loued most entierly: I shall in rewarde therof, exalt thy head aboue all the lordes of Englande.I iuste reward geuen. And foorthwith commanded hym to be headed: and his head to be set vpon a spear on the hyghest gate of London.Iohn Hars dynge. These princes reygned together .ii. yeares.
            Thys Edmund was buryed at Glastenburye.
            
               VUhen Canutus was stablished in the kyngdom,1018 he had knowledge how Olanns king of Norway in his absence inuaded the coūtrey of Denmarke: wherfore in all hast he sped him thitherward: & by the māhod of the english souldiors, obteined of them a noble victory, & recouered Norway to his seignory. wherfore when he returned into England, he demeaned him toward all men as a sage gentle & moderat prince, and so continued .xx. yeares.
            Canutus called a parliamēt at Oxē
               ford:A parliamēt at Oxforde. where it was decreed, that english men and Danes should hold the lawes of Edgare late kyng.
            Canutus subdued the Scots, wherby he was king of .iiii. kingdoms, yt is to say of England, Scotlād, Denmark & Norway. After that he wēt into Denmark, and so to Rome. And after returned again into England. Where he kept all his life tyme good iustice, and did many charitable dedes: And after his deathe was buried in s. Swithins at Winchester.

In the begynning hee shewed some token of crueltie, in that he banyshed his stepmother Emma, and tooke from her suche iewelles and treasure, as she hadde. He reigned iii. yeares. Hee was buryed at Westmynster, and after at S. Clementes without Temple barre.

Clementes (as afore is sayd.) He burdeined his subiectes with eractions and tribute: and in meat and dryncke was so prodygall that hys tables were spreade .iiii. tymes in the day, and the people serued with great excesse whan he had reigned .iii. yeares

he dyed sodeinly at Lambeth, not without suspection of poysonynge, and was buried at Winchester.
            Hardikenitus beyng deade, the Danes were beaten, slayn, and dryuen out of this lande, into theyr owne countrey xxviii. yeares after that Swayn began fyrst to reigne.

And at his returne enriched hym with great gyftes & pleasures: and (as som write) made promise to hym, that if he died without issue, the same William shold succede hym in the kyngdome of England.
            Harolde the sonne of the Erle Goodwin, went to Normādie: wher he made faithfull promise to duke William, that after the death of Edwarde, he woulde kepe the kyngdome to hys behalfe: on whiche condition, he brought with hym at his returne his brother Tosto.

               The noble kynge Edwarde fynished hys laste daye whenne he hadde reygned foure and twenty yeares .vii. monethes and odde dayes. Hee purged the

olde and corrupte lawes,The lawes of S. Edwarde the confessor. and pycked out of them a certayn, whych wer most profitable for the commons. And therfore were they called the common Lawes. For restitution whereof, happened dyuers commotions and insurrections in this lande. Hee was buryed at Westminster.
            HArolde,1066 the eldeste soonne of Earle Goodwyne, beynge of greate power in Englande, and therewyth valyaunt and hardye, tooke on hym the gouernance of thys Lande, nothynge regardynge the promyse that he made to Wylliam duke of Normandye. Wherfore when William sente to hym Ambassades, admonysshynge hym of the couenauntes that were agreed betwene theim. Harolde, woulde in noo wyse surrendre to hym the kyngdome, whyche Wyllyam claymed, not only for the promyse that was made to hym: but also because hee was the nexte of Kynge Edwardes bloudde.
            In thys meane tyme, Tosto whiche fledde oute of the Lande, beyng moued

agaynst his brother the kynge of Norway, who entryng in the north partes of England, with a great puisance discomfited .ii. Erles that gaue hym battaile. But Harold in reskuyng his people, slewe the kyng, and his owne brother Tosto, and chased the Norwayes with disworshyp to their shyps.
            
               Willliā duke of Normandy conquered this lande.When William Duke of Normandye perceyued, that he could not by any meanes brynge Harolde to fulfyll hys promyse, nor by treatie to yelde to hym the kyngdome: by force he entred the lande, to whome Harolde gaue stronge and sharpe battaile. In the end wherof, William by pollicy obteined the victorye, chased the englishemen, slewe Harolde, and obteined the gouernaunce of this lande, when Harolde had reigned but .ix. monethes. Hee was buryed at Waltham abbey,Waltham abbey. whyche hym self had buylded, and was the last that reigned of the bloude of the Saxones in thys Realme.

               This happened .617. yeres after the fyrst arriuall of the Saxons or Angles, in whiche space they reygned dyuersly. Fyrst began the kyngdom of Kent, the

yeare of our Lorde .475. vnder Hengistus. And after that .vi. other kyngdodomes at sundry tymes tooke theyr begynnyngs. Whych all at the last were broughte into one Monarchie, and subiect to the West Saxons by king Adelstane, the yeare of our Lord .ix. hundreth thirtie & eight. Whiche monarchie continued .129. yeares: durynge fiue and twenty of whych yeares, the Danes reigned in this land vnder Canutus and Harolde.

                   Bastarde sonne of Roberte the syxte Duke of that Duchye, and nephew vnto kyng Edward the confessor, began his dominion ouer this Realme of England, the .xiiii. day of October, in the yeare of our Lorde 1067. and deceased in the yere .1087. the nynthe day of September, and reigned .xix. yeres .xi. monethes, lackyng fyue dayes. He vsed greate crueltie towarde the Englyshe menne, burdenynge theym wyth greuous exactions: By meane whereof he caused dyuers to flee the lande into other countreies. And lyke as hee obteyned the kyngedome by force and dent of sweard, so he chaunged the whole state of this common weale, and ordeyned newe lawes

at his pleasure, profytable to hym selfe: but greuous and hurtfull to the people. Thys Wylliam was wyse and politike ryche and couetous, and loued well to be magnifyed. He was a fayre speaker and a great dissembler. A man of comely stature, but somdeale grosse bealyed: sterne of countenaunce, and strong in armes, and had great pleasure in huntynge, and makynge of sumptuous feastes.
               Wyth thys Wyllyam Conqueroure,The names of Normanes and other that came with the conqueror. entred into thys Realme, dyuers noble menne and gentylmenne, whose successoures for the moste parte to this daye doo remayne in greate honoure and reputation. To whome he dysposed and gaue greatte possessions and reuenues. And because those houses maye not bee vnremembred, I haue thoughte good in thys place to recorde the names of theym, as Iohn Hardynge in hys Chronycles dedycated to kynge Henry the syrte, doothe particulerly recite theym. That is to saye:

               1087WIllyam Ruffus, the seconde sonne of Willyam conqueror began his reygne ouer the realme of England, the ninthe day of Septembre in the yeare of oure Lorde .1087. and deceased in the yeare of our Lorde. 1100. the fyrst day of August:

so that he reigned .xii. yeare .xi. monethes lackyng .viii. dayes. He was variable and inconstant of his demeanor, very couetous and therewithall cruell. For he burdened his people with vnresonable taxes. He pilled the ryche, and opprest the poore. And caused many to lose their landes for small causes. And what he thus got by pillyng of hys people, be prodigally and wastfully spente in great banketting and sumptuous apparell.It remaineth in recorde of good authoritie, that the best payre of hose then to be bought for the kyng, coste but .iii. s. as one Robert affirmeth: who wrate in the tyme of Henry the thyrde. And as one auctor writeth (who wrate in the tyme of Henry the thirde) he would neither eate drynke or weare any thyng, but that it coste vnmeasurably deere. And for an exaumple, hee wryteth (whiche is to be noted in these oure dayes) that in a morning his chamberlayne bryngyng hym a newe payre of hosen, he demanded what they cost: his chamberlayn answered .iii. s. Wher with the kynge beynge wrothe (as this author affirmeth) saide as foloweth.
            
               Fye a dibles q the king: who sey so vile a dede Kyng to weare so vyle cloath? but it costened more.
               Bye a payre for a marke: or thou shalt a corry sore.
               
                  A worse payre ynongh, that other swithe hym brought,
               And said they costned a mark: & vneth he them so bought.
               Ye belamy (q ye king) these were wel thought, In this maner serue me: outher ne serue me nought.
            
            OUt of this aucthor I haue taken the saying of K. William Ruffus because it importeth the simplicitie of apparel in those days vsed: If kinges in those dayes ware hose of .xiii. s .iiii. d. the price, then maye subiectes in these days imitate his chamberlayn to weare of inferior price of .iii. s. Whiche price he thought king W. Ruffus wold not haue disdained: but as his chamberlayne spared the kynges priuie purse in byeng hose in those days: So now some of meane lyuyng spare not theyr owne and others, to employe vpon one paire whiche wold bye princes hose for a hole yere, as this hystorie reporteth.

Now drawe ye therfore holsom water foorth of my welles, & that with ioye. For the tyme of your visitation is to men.

the profites which came by the said Fery, builded an house of sisters, whiche is the vppermost ende of S.

Caxton his chronicle, wyth other saye, that a great parte of this variance betwene kyng Iohn and his barons, was for because the Kyng would haue exiled the Earle of Chester, who oftentymes had aduised the King to leaue his cruelnes, & hys accustomed aduo

               Then came into Englande, a Normane knyght, named Foukis de Brent, whiche broughte with hym a companye of Normans, Flemmyngs and Picardes,

He and his company were so cruel, that they destroyed as well religious houses as other, and dyd muche harme to the lande puttyng the lordes to the worse, the kynge made Foukes & other of his company, wardens of castels and strōg holdes in England.

Then he with the lordes departed from London,

               Roger Fitz Alwine for that he was accused to the Lordes to be fauourable to the kynges partie was discharged of that office,The Mayre of London discharged, and an other serued the rest of the yeare. and one called Serle mercer was Mayre in hys place, the reste of

               Kyng Iohn beyng thus ouerset with his lordes sent messangers to the bishop of Rome, shewing to hym the rebelliō of his lords, and how they laboured his destruction. Wherefore the byshop of Rome with all haste sente a Legate into Englande,A Legate frō Rome. called Swalo: The whiche after his commynge, commuanded Lewes to returne into France, and laboured to the vttermoste of his power, to appease the Kynge and his baronye: but all his labour was in vayne.

Then for the leuyeng of this fyne, were cared as well seruauntes, couenaunte men, as housholders. And many refused the liberties of the citie for to be quite of the charge: of whiche nomber many neuer retourned agayne to the citie.

                  Kyng Edward with his son the prince passed the sea to Calice, and from thense rode through France by Picard, Artois Roan, Champayn, and so foorth to Britaine, euer destroying the countrey before him, hys garrisons also made warre in Beauvoisin, in Picardye, in Brye, in Campayn, and spoiled well nere all the counntrey. Moreouer the kynge of Nauarre vexed sore the marches of Normandy. Thus was the realm of France miserably beset at this tyme on all sydes.
               At the last a finall peace was concluded betwene the kynges of Englande & of Frāce, on this cōdition, that king Edward should haue to his possession, the countreis of Gascoyn and Guyen, Poytiers, Lymosyn, Baleuile, Exantes, Calice, Guynes, and diuers other lordships castels, towns, & all the landes to thē belōging, without knowlege of any soueraigntie or subiection for ye same: and the king of France shold pay for his ransom 300000. crownes: & so King Iohn returned into France.

the Spanyardes and Frenche men, and expelled Henry the bastarde, and set Peter in his former estate, as kig of Spain.

               This yere the countrey of Lymosyn with other, became obeysaunt to the Frenche kyng, and fell from the kynge of Englande: by reason that Prynce Edward had lately assessed vpon the inhabytantes of the countrey, a great and greuous taske: by meanes whereof, he lost the loue of the people.

In bountie and liberalitie he farre passed all hys progenitours: but he was ouer muche geuen to reste & quietnes, and loued litle dedes of armes, and martial prowesse, &

for that he was yong, he was moste ruled by yong counsayle, and regarded nothyng the aduertysementes of the sage and wyse men of his Realme, for the chiefe about hym were of no wysdome nor estimacion: whiche thyng tourned this land to great trouble, and him selfe in fine to extreame myserie.

               This yere the makynge of gunnes was first found,Gonnes firste inuented. in this maner: a certain Almayne (whose name is not knowen) chaunced to haue in a morter, pouder of brymstone that he had beaten for a medicine, and couered it with a stone, and as he stroke fyre, it fortuned a sparke to fall in the pouder, by and by there rose a great flame out of the mortar, and lyfte vp the stone wherwith it was couered, a great heyght: and after he had perceyued that, he made a pype of Iron, and tempered the pouder and finished thys deadly engyn, and taught it to the Uenecians, when they warred agaynst the Genuates, whiche was in the yere of our lorde .1380. For this inuention he receyued this benefite, that his name was neuer knowen, leste he might for this abhominable deuise, haue bene cursed and euil spoken of whylest the world standeth: so sayeth Polldore.
               By the meane of the payment aboue named, this yere the cōmōs of this lād,

As ye may reade at large in Iohn Froysard, the first boke the .381. chapiter. They caused muche trouble and busines in the Realme, and chiefly about the citie of London, where they practised much vyllanie, in destroyinge manye goodlye places of the nobles, as the Sauoye,The Sauoye burnt, & S. Iohnes in Smithfielde spoyled. saynt Iohns in Smythfielde and other. They let forthe all prysoners and set them at lybertie: they spoyled all the bookes of lawe in the Innes of courte, the Recordes of the Counters and other prysons. They set the kyng forth of the towre of London, compellyng hym to graunt al bondmen fredom, and that he shoulde neuer demaunde trybute or taxe of his commōs: and also required Iack Strawe, and Wat Tyler to be made Dukes of Essex and Kent, and gouernours of the kyngs person from thenceforth, both in peace

and warre, whiche thynges he graunted: for he durst in no poynt denye them: But Wylliā Walworth Maior or Lō
                  don beyng in Smithfielde, nere vnto ye kynges person, and seynge hym stande hoodlesse afore Iack strawe,Iack Straw slayne. rebuked the saide Straw of his great leudnesse, and with a dagger slewe hym, and brought the kyng into the citie:Why the city of Londō geueth the dagger in armes. Whereupon the rude company was dispersed, and fledde as shepe, some one waye and some an other: so sayeth Hardyng. In memory of this dede the citie geueth the dagger in their shylde of armes.

               This yeare about Whitsontide, and so foorthe vntyll September, the commons in most part of this realme,Cōmotion in Cornewall & Deuonshyre mads sundry insurrections and commotions. Amongest whome, dyuers of the commons of Cornewall and Deuonshyre, rose agaynst the nobles and gentilmen: and in sundrye Campes besyeged the towne of Excester, whyche was valyantly defended.
               Also they of Norffolke and Suffolke

encamped them selves in a wood,Commocion at Norwiche called saynt Nycholas woode, nere vnto Norwiche, declaryng them selues to be grieued with parkes, pastures, and inclosures made by the gentilmē: who required the same to be disparked & set among the commons. They of Deuonshyre dyd not only require that, but also their olde relygion, and the arte of syre articles to be restored. Into Deuonshyre against Humfrey Arundell and his rebelles, was sent the lorde Russell, lorde preuye seale, with a nūber of souldiours. The lorde Graie was also sent with a number of straungers, which were horsemē, where in dyuers conflictes they slewe many people, and spoiled that countrey.

And about the same tyme .ii. other shyps were sent foorth to seke aduentures southwardes.
               In May whiles kyng Edwarde laye daungerously sycke, Lorde Gylford the duke of Northumberlandes fourth son, maryed lady Iane the Duke of Suffolkes daughter, whose mother being then aliue was doughter to Mary king Henries sister, whiche fyrste was maried to the frenche kynge, and after to Charles duke of Suffolke.
               In this tyme many were punyshed in Englande for talkynge rasshely, that the Kyng shoulde be deade, and dyuers also for sayenge that he was poysoned:

for that rumour was spred throughoute the Realme.
               The .22. day of Iune, a great thunder began about a .xi. of the clock,A great thunder. and dured almoste the space of two houres, and about .xii. of the clocke was a wonderfull terrible clap, at which clappe the lyttell doore of saint Denyse church in London was driuen open, and the locke thereof with a great parte of the lynyng of the same doore was torne awaye.
               
                  Kynge Edwarde deceased.Kyng Edward beyng about the age of .xvi. yeres, as is sayd before was long sick of a consumption of the lightes, and the .vi. day of Iuly ended his life. he was in this hys youthe, a prince of suche towardnes in vertue, learnynge, and all goodly gyftes, as Europe seldom tymes or neuer hath sene the like: and therfore no meruaile, considering the state of the realme, if all true englyshe hartes dye muche lament soo vntymely death in so tender youthe, and so toward a prince.
               The .x. daye of Iuly beyng monday, the deathe of Kyng Edwarde was publyshed:Ladye Iane proclaymed Quene. The same daye in the after noone aboute fower of the clocke, the Lady Iane doughter of the lady Frances,

the Duchesse of Suffolke, whyche Lady Iane was maryed vnto the Lord Gyiford Dudley the fourthe sonne vnto the Duke of Northumberland was conueyed by water to the tower of London and betwene .vii. and .viii. of the clocke in the euening, proclamation was made throughout the citie, whereby was declared by sondry circumstāces, that king Edwarde beyng deceased, by his wylle had assigned the sayde lady Iane to bee quene, and therevppon so proclaymed Quene of England. Thys matter was very greuouslye taken of the commom people, and a greate numbre of gentilmen, for the loue they bare to Lady Mary, and the ryghte of her title. At thys tyme the state of this realme might wel seme moste myserable, wherin the nobilitie and counsell on the one parte, and the gentlemen and commons of the other, appered to be fully bent to mayntayne two contrary titles. For when it was heard that the lady Mary was fled to Framingham castell in Suffolk, the people of the countrey almoste wholly resorted vnto her, and in Oxenforde syr Iohn Williams, in Buckinghamshire,

syr Edmunde Peckham, and in dyuers other places many men of worshyp, offryng them selues as guides to the common people, gathered greate powers, and with all spede made towarde Suffolke, where ladye Mary was. In thys meane tyme the .xiii. day of Iuly, by appointment of the counsell the Duke of Northumberland, the Erle of Huntingdon, the lorde Grey of Wilton and dyuers other, with a great numbre of men of armes, went to fetche her by force, and was on their way as farre as Bury but not long after, the counsell, partly moued with the right of her cause, partly consideryng that the moste of the realme was wholly bent on her syde, changed theyr myndes, and assembled them selues at Baynardes castell, and there commoned with the erle of Pembroke, and immediatly came into Cheapeside, with the kyng of heraldes, where they proclaimed the lady Mary doughter to kyng Henry the .viii. and quene Katherine,Lady Marye proclaymed quene of Englande. quene of Englande, France, and Irelande defendor of the faithe. &c. the xix. day of Iuly: kepyng as prisoners in the tower lady Iane lately proclaimed,

and Lorde Gylford her husband. When this was heard in the dukes campe, many of his souldiours forsoke hym, and be returnynge to Cambridge, proclaimed the Ladye Marye Quene, and on the twenty day at nyght, beyng apprehended of the garde, he with other, was brought to the Tower of London, the fyue and twentye daye of Iuly. Thus was the matter ended wythout bloudshedde, whyche menne seared woulde haue brought the deathe of many thousandes.

               Anno Regni. 1.
               MArye, the eldest daughter of king Henry the .viii. began her reigne ouer thys realme of England the vi. day of Iuly,1553 in the yeare of our Lord .1553. & deceased in the yere of our Lorde .1558. the .17. day of Nouember, so she reigned .v. yeares .v. moneths & .xi. days: she was proclaimed Quene at London, the .xix. day of Iuly,

and the .xx. day at the castel of Framingham:Quene Mary hauynge to the numbre of 30000. men, ye erle of Sussex being lieutenaunt of the armye, when she dissolued her campe at Framingham victuals was of suche plentithe, that a barell of biere was folde for vi. d with the caske and iiii. greate loaues of bread for a peny. and afterwarde beynge accompanied with a goodly bande of noble men, gentylmen, and commoners gathered out of all partes of the realme, came to London, and entred the tower the .iii. day of August. In her fathers tyme and brothers tyme, dyuers noble men, byshops, and other were caste into the tower: somme for treason layde to their charge, as the Duke of Norffolke, and the Lord Courtney, sonne to the Marques of Excester: some for mainteinyng the Popes supremacie, as D. Lonstall, byshop of Durham, and other: whiche continued there prisoners at the Quenes commyng to the tower, to all these and many other, she graunted pardon, and restored them to theyr former dignities. Lykewise dyd she vnto doctour Gardener bishop of Winchester, whom she dyd not only sette at libertie, but also made hym hygh chauncellour of Englande. For the greate fauour that she shewed to the lord Courtney, whom she made Erle of Deuonshyre, many men were in opinion, that she purposed to haue maryed hym, but in the end it proued

otherwyse.
               As all sortes of men almoste dyd reioyce, that Quene Mary had recouered the crowne: so many notwithstandyng muche feared alteration of religion by her. For manyfest signification therof, was geuen dayly, as well by the Quene her selfe, who oftentymes hadde masse and Latine seruice before her in the tower: as also by diuers sermons made of them that at that tyme were appointed to preache about London.
               The .xi. day of August certaine gentilmen myndyng to passe through London bridge in a wherrie,A wherrye ouerturned. were there ouerturned by violence of the water, and seuen of them drowned.
               The .xiii. day of August, master Bourn canon of Paules, preachynge at Paules crosse sayd as foloweth: This same day v. yeares the reuerende father in God, Edmunde bishop of London our diocesan, preachynge in thys place, and thys same gospell whyche I nowe preache, for the same was cast in prison, and hath there remained tyll this tyme, that the quenes most excellent maiestie hath deliuered and set hym at libertie: whyche

saying of the precher so offended the audience, that they breakyng silence, said, the byshop had preached abhomination: other some cried (meanyng of the preacher) pull hym out, pulle hym out: and some beynge next the pulpyt, began to clymbe towarde the preacher to haue pulled hym out, wherwith the preacher stepped backe, and one mayster Bradforde, a preacher of Kynge Edwardes tyme, stepped forthe into the preachers place, most myldely and gently persuadyng the audience to quietnes and obedience, whose presence lyked the people well:A dagger throwen at Paules crosse but neuertheles Bourne standing by Bradford one threw a dagger at him whiche hytte one of the syde poastes of the pulpet, and rebounded backe agayn a great way: whervpon maister Bradforde was fayne to breake of his speche, & forced hym self with the helpe of Iohn Rogers, an other preacher, to conueye Maister Bourne oute of the audience, whiche with great labour they brought into Poules schole.
               Doctour Boner that was depriued in king Edwards time, was now again (as ye haue heard) restored to his bishoprike

and dyuers other byshops for Religion were displaced: as Cranmer of Canterbury: The archbishop of Yorke Poynet of winchester, Barlow of Bath, Farrar of S. Dauis: Harley of Herford: Houper of Gloucester: Couerdale of Excester: Scory of Chichester. &c. And al other benefieed men, that either were maried or wold not forsake their opiniōs, wer put out of their liuinges, & other knowen to be of the contrary parte were set in the same, especially if any were aliue, that in the time of kyng Henry or Edwarde were put out of the same bishoprikes or benefices: as bishop day of Chichester: Heth of worc. Turberuile of Excest. &c. The .22. day of August yt duke of Northū
                  berlād was beheded & with him wer put to deth sir Iohn Gates,Execution at Tower hyll. and sir Thomas Palmer called Buskin palmer knights.
               Peter martyr, who in king Edwards tyme was reader of diuinitie in Oxford obteined licence and safe conduite of the quene, and departed oute of Englande to Argentine whens he came.
               In this time ye people shewed thēselues so redy to receiue their old religion, yt in many places of the realme, vnderstandyng

the quenes plesure, before any law was made for the same, they erected agayne theyr aultars, and vsed the Masse and latin seruice, in suche sorte as was wont to be in kyng Henries tyme.
               
                  The greate Hary brente.The .xxvi. day of Auguste in the euenyng, the notablest shyppe in the world was burnt at wolwich, called the great Hary, by the negligence of maryners, she was of burthen a M. tunne.
               The last day of September the quenes hyghnes rode thorough the citie to Westminster in moste goodly maner,A man stoode on the wether cock of Paules. the pageantes in all places accustomed beyng moste gorgiously trimmed: And as her grace passed by Poules, a certain dutche man stode vpon the wethercock with an enseigne in his hande, flouryshyng with the same, and vnder hym vpon the crosse, a scaffold garnished with enseignes banners and streamers, and vnder that vpon the holle an other scaffolde with enseignes & streamers, very strange to ye beholders. And the morow which was the fyrst day of October her grace was crowned at westminster by doctor Gardiner bishop of Winchester.
               The .v. day of October began the parliament

at Westminster, and masse of the holy ghoste was songe.
               The .xxv. day of October the barge of Grauesend by greate misfortune of a ratche running vpon her,Grauesende barge ouerturned. was ouerthrowen and .xiiii. persones drowned, and xvi. saued by swymmyng.
               The .xxiii. the .xxv. the .xxvii. dayes of October were certayne disputations in the longe chapell at the northe doore of Paules concerning Transubstantiation but nothyng throughly determined.

               The same syr Thomas White, a worthy patron and protector of poore scholers and learnynge, renewed or rather erected a college in Oxford,S. Iohns colledge in Oxenford erected that was in great ruine and decaye, nowe called S. Iohns college, and before Bernard college, indowyng the same with landes & reuenues, to the greate prefermente of learnyng and comfort of poore mennes children. Renuing by that ensample, the worthy monuments and dedes done by the lyke godly disposed of ancient tyme

in bothe the vniuersities, whiche maye wel be called, ye two Eies of the realme, whose sight begyn to grow dymme, thorough the coldnes of charitie and want of deuotion late crept into the hartes of men. God graunt they may be restored to the clerenes of their wonted syghte, that learnyng may flouryshe, throughe abundaunce of schollers, with maintenaunce for the same. And that the able and riche may liberally imitate therample of this vertuous gentleman, who both there and in many other places, as by erection of Schooles at Bristoll and Readynge, hathe planted the rootes of learnyng: the fruites wherof no doubte in tyme to come shall flouryshe, to the great cōmoditie and singular ornament of the realme.
               
                  Trinitie coledge erected.The lyke College also now called trinitie colledge, the ryght worshypfull sir Thomas Pope knyght deceased to his great praise and singular commēdation erected, whiche some tyme was called Durham colledge, also ruinous and in great decaye he reedified: appoyntynge for the maintenance of the fellowes and scholers like possession. By whiche fact

he declared, that like as God had indued him with greate rychesse and reuenues by policie and the princis seruice acquired and gotten, euen so he therby ment to dedicate some portion thereof to the honor of lerning, and gifts of the mynd, that his naturall countrey might attein that honoure, whiche is or ought to belonge to euery christen realme. For he remembryng what benefites learnyng dothe conduce and brynge to a well gouerned common wealthe, thought not to beslack in distributyng his portion, to thaugmentation of the same.
               Cardinall Poole, who fledde oute of Englande in the tyme of Kyng Henry, and was in great estimatiō in the court of Rome, was sent for by Quene Mary to returne into hys countrey.
               About this tyme the parliament dyd conclude, that the Seruice of the churche should from and after the .xx. day of December next ensuyng, be used in all places, in suche maner and fourme as it was vsed in the laste yere of kyng Henry the .viii.
               The .xiii. day of Nouēber D. Cranmer

Archbishop of Canturburye, lady Iane that was before proclaimed Quene, and the lorde Gylford her husbande were openly arreigned & condemned for treson.
               This yere the .xxv. of Nouember beyng saincte Katherins daye, after euensong began the quier of Poules to go about the steple, synging anthemes with cresset lyghtes, after the old custome at vi. of the clocke at nyght.
               The laste daye of Nouember beynge saynt Andrewes day, began the procession in latine, the byshop, curates, persons, and the whole quiere of Poules, with the Maior and aldermen, and the prebendes in their grey amyses, &c.
               The .v. day of December the parliament was dissolued, in the whyche parliament all statutes that were made either of Premunire in tyme of king Hē
                  ry the .viii. or concernynge religion and administration of the sacramentes vnder kyng Edwarde the syxt, were repealed, and communication was had of the quenes mariage with kyng Philyp the Emperours sonne.
               The beginnyng of Ianuarie the emperor sent a noble man called Ecmondane

and certayne other ambassadours into England to make a perfecte conclusion of the mariage betwene Kyng Philyp and Quene Mary.
               The .xx. day of Ianuary the lord Chancellor with other of the counsaile, declared openly vnto the Quenes maiesties houshold, that there was a mariage concluded, betwene her grace and the kyng of Spayne, whiche shoulde be a greate strength, honour, and enrichyng to the realme of England.
               The purpose of this mariage was so greuously taken of dyuers noble men, and a great numbre of gentylmen and commoners, that for this, and religion, they in suche sort conspired agaynst the quene, that if the matter had not brokē out before the tyme appointed, menne thought it would haue brought muche more trouble and danger. For syr Thomas Wyat in Kente, beyng one of the chief,A commotion in Kent. fearynge that the matter was by certaine persones bewrayed, sodenly about the .xx. day of Ianuary gathered a certayne company, and muche incensed the people of those partes agaynste the quene, saying: That she and the counsel

intended not onely by alteration of religion to bryng in the pope, but also by mariage of a stranger to brynge the realme into miserable seruitude and bondage. When report of this was brought to London, the Queene, with so muche spede as might be, sent the duke of Norfolke with a company of souldiours into Kent against Wiat, where the duke meting with Wyat, not farre from Rochester bridge, was forsaken of his souldiours, and returned to London.
               
                  The duke of Suffolks, agayn proclaymed his doughter quene.In this meane tyme Henry duke of Suffolk father to lady Iane lately proclaimed Quene fleynge into Leycestershyre, and Warwikeshire with a small company in dyuers places as he went agayne proclaimed his daughter: but the people did not greatly inclyne vnto him Wherfore when the erle of Huntyngton, that was sent to pursue hym, came to Couentrie, and was receiued into the citie: the duke, hauyng no great power or strength of menne about hym, was brought therby into a streight, and hydyng hymselfe in a parke of hys owne by Couentrie, was bewrayed by one of his seruauntes, and so taken, and by the

erle of Huntington brought prysoner to London:The Duke of Suffolke taken. whyle thys stirre and trouble was, the Emperours ambassadours for feare of daunger departed out of the realme, and the same daye beyng the fyrst of Februarie, the Quene came frome Westminster to the Guyld hall in London:The Queene came to the Guylde hall in London. and there after vehement woordes agaynste Wyate, declared that she ment not otherwyse to marry, then the Councell should thynke both honourable and commodious to the realm. And if they thought good, that she could continue vnmaried, as she had done ye greatest part of her age: and therfore wylled theym truely to assist her in repressynge suche as contrarye to theyr dueties rebelled.
               When she had done, vnderstandynge that many in London dyd fauour Wyats part, she appoynted lorde William Haward lieutenant of the citie, and the Earle of Pembroke general of the field whiche bothe prepared all thynges necessarye for theyr purposes, with greate prouision of men and artillerie.
               Whyle thys prouysion was makynge,

Wyate came nere vnto the citie, and was entred into Southewarke, the third day of Februarie, and the morow after Candlemas daye. wherefore the drawe bridge was broken downe, ordinance bent to that parte, generall pardon proclaimed to all them that woulde geue ouer and forsake the rebels, and a greate rewarde appoynted to hym that toke Wyate prisoner. After Wyat had layne .ii. dayes in Southwarke, he turned hys iorney to Kyngston on Shroue: tuisday in the mornyng, beyng the sixte of Februarie. where he passed ouer the Thames, and purposed to haue come to London in the night: but by means that the cariage of his chiefe ordinance brake he was so letted that he could not come before it was farre daye. At that tyme the erle of Pembroke, and diuers other were in saint Iames field with a great power, and theyr ordinance so bent that Wiate was faine to leaue the common way, and with a smalle company came vnder saint Iames wall frome the danger of the ordinaunce: and so wente by Charing crosse vnto Ludgate without resistence, and there thought to haue be

let in. But perceiuyng that he was defeated of his purpose, he returned, and aboute temple barre was resysted, and yeldyng hymselfe was taken prisoner.Wyat taken.
               
               Proclamation was made in London, that no man vnder pain of death should kepe in his house any of Wiats faction. Wherfore they were all brought forth, and shortly after, about the number of fifty were hanged on .xx. paire of gallouses made for that purpose in dyuers places in and about the citie.
               The .xii. day of February lady Iane the duke of Suffolkes daughter and her husband lord Gylford, whiche hytherto had ben kept in the tower,Execution. were nowe be headed, for feare least any other shold make lyke trouble for her title, as her father had attempted to doo.

               The .x. day of April was one William Geffrey whypped from the Marshalsey in Southwarke, to Bethleem, without byshops gate of London, for that he professed one Iohn More, to be Christ oure Sauior: he was very sore whipped, and on his head, & about the cart were set papers, wherin was writtē as foloweth: Wylliam Geffrey, a most blasphemous heretike, denying Christ our Sauior in heauen. The sayd Geffrey beyng stayde at Bethleem gate, the Marshalles officers caused Iohn Moore to be broughte foorth: and then where as the sayd Geffrey hadde tyll this tyme for all his sore

whippyng still professed Iohn Moore to bee Christe, nowe he forsoke hym, and confessed Christ to be in heauen. Then the sayd Iohn More, beyng examyned & answerynge them very ouerthwartely was commaunded to strippe hym selfe,One saynyng him selfe to be Christ was whipte. whyche he semed to do very wyllyngly, who was after tyed to the cart, & whipt an arrowes shote from Bedlem, where at the laste he confessed Christ to be in heauen, and himself to be a synful man. Then was More sent again into Bedlem, and william Geffrey to the Marshalsey, where they had layne prisoners nygh a yeare and a half before that time the one for professynge hymselfe to bee Christe, the other an apostle or disciple of the same Christe.

               In the beginning of this Maiors yere and the later end of the third yere of the Quenes maiesties reigne, the. xv. day of Nouember, the Quenes maiestie published a proclamation, wherin her grace restored to the realme diuers small pieces of syluer money,

And also forbad all maner of forayn coynes to be currant with in the same realme: as well golde as syluer, excepte two sortes of crownes of golde, wherof the one was the freuche. crowne, & the other a flemishe crowne.
               
                  Thys fourth yeare in England were many monstrous byrthes,
                     Anno reg. 4. as in March a mare brought foorth a foale with one body being in good proportion,Manye monstrous births this yeare in Englande. and two heades, hauyng as it were a long tayle growing out right like a horn betwene the same two heades. Also a sowe farrowed a pygge with .iiii. legges lyke vnto the armes of a man childe wyth handes and fyngers, moute and eares dysfygured. &c.
               About April a sow farrowed a pigge which had .ii. bodies .viii. feete, and but one head, many calues and lambes wer monstrous, and one calfe had a colier of skinne growyng about the necke, lyke to a double ruffe, whiche to the beholders semed strange and wonderfull.
               The .xxiiii. day of May a monstrous chyld was borne at Chichester in Suffer,A monstrous chylde. whyche maye not so playnly be declared wyth the penne, as in picture. The head armes and legges lyke vnto an Anatomie, the breast and bealy verye monstrous bygge, frome the nauille, as it were a longe strynge hangyng: about the neck a great coller of

fleshe and skyn growyng lyke the ruffe of a shyrt or neckerchief, commyng vp aboue the eares pleytyng or foldyng. &c.
               This yeare the Queenes maiestie in September addressed a band of her subiectes to the towne of Newhauen in Normandye:The goyng to Newhauen. who were embarked at Portesmouthe, because that hauen is most apt for transportatiō to that place. Upon whose arriuall the townes men and inhabitauntes ioyefully surrendred them selues and their towne into the possession of the Queenes Maiestie. whych was kept by Englyshmen from September .1562. to the .29. day of Iuly then next folowynge, whiche was in the yere .1563. the gouernour of whiche bande was the ryghte honourable, the Earle of Warwyke, who with the capitaynes seruyng there (whiche were of great experience) and souldiors trayned by them to knowledge of seruice, together with part of the old approued garrison of Barwike, did at that time both manfully defend the piece, and valiantly encountred by sundry skirmishes & cō
                  flicts with the coūtie Ringraue and his band, the moste part wherof were happyly

atchieued to the great ouerthrow of the aduersaries part, and singular cō
                  mendations of ours.

               This Maiors yeare began the .xxviii. day of October in the yeare .1562. whiche was in the latter part of the fourthe yeare of our soueraigne lady Elizabeth. And the fyfthe yeare of her maiesties reigne began the .17. day of Nouembre next folowyng.
               Now this fifth yere when the frenche men with huge armies assembled oute of all partes of Fraunce to recouer the place of passage:
                     Anno reg. 5. the stoppyng wherof, by oure power, was the double wo of theyr common wealth, there bredde thorough the heate of tyme and putrifaction of the ayre, a miserable and infortunate plague among oure men, whiche meruailously encreased wyth the death of dyuers of the best capitains and souldiours, wherewithall there folowed a cruell and quick siege, wherat was present the yang kyng hymselfe, the quene his mother, the Constable, and the best

tried number of warlike souldiors with in the whole countrey, besides an other sort of yong & olde that cared not for life or land, so theyr owne aduenture might wyn agayne the cause of theyr distresse: with this generall ayde, the marishes were made passable and firme ground, which by men of great experience was thought impossible. And with common help the Canons wer placed, the castell & walles were battered, & sundry breaches made beyonde expectation. Howbe it they were rewarded by oure gonners, and made to taste the bitter frute of theyr desperate approche, to theyr great terrour and annoyance. The erle of Warwyke with the remnant of our captaines and souldiours in couragious order, standynge at the seuerall breaches readye to defende theyr assaultes: whych perceyued by the ennemy, they caused theyr trumpettes to sounde the blaste of emparle, that composition of eyther part myght be made to auoyde the imminent slaughter and effusion of bloud.Newe hauen delyuered to the frenche. This offer seemed not vnmete, bothe partes concluded, the town was

delyuered the .xxix. daye of Iuly.
               When the towne in thys sorte was surrendred to the frenchemen and the greatest parte of our garrison shypped many sycke persons were lefte behynde impotent and vnhable to helpe theym selues. The myserie wherof Edwarde Randolffe esquire, high marshall of the towne, who was appointed to tary and see the vttermoste of oure composition accomplished perceyuyng, moued with naturall pitie of his countrey men, relinquyshed without comfort, caused the sayd sycke persons to be caryed aboord, not sparyng his owne shoulders at that time ful feble and full of the plage, him selfe and his men styll bearyng and helping the poore creatures on shypboord. A rare fact worthy of worldly reward, and no doubte in remembraunce wyth God hym self, the true recorder of mercyfull desertes.
               Thys yeare as ye haue hearde, the plague of pestilence being in the towne of Newhauen, and many souldioures afected with the same, returnyng into Englande, the infection therof spredde

in dyuers partes of this realme,Greate pestilence at Lon
                   but especially the citie of London was so infected therwith, that in the same whole yere; that is to say,An hundred & eight parishes in London. from the fyrst of Ianuarie .1562. vntyll the last of December .1563. there dyed in the Cytie and liberties therof (conteining .108. parishes) of all diseases .xx. M .iii. C .lxxii. so that there dyed of the plague (beyng part of the nombre before named) xvii. M .iiii. C. and .iiii. persones.A seuen parishe churches called the out paryshes. And in the out parishes adioyning to the same Citie, being xi. paryshes dyed of all diseases in the whole yere aforesaid .iii. M .ii. C .lxxx. & viii. persons, & of them of the plague beyng a part of the sayd numbre laste before named .ii. M .vii. C .xxxii. so that the hole totall summe of all those that dyed of all diseases in the whole yeare, aswel within the citie of London, and liberties of the same as in the out parishes nyghe adioynynge vnto the same Citie was .xxiii. M .vi. C .lx. and of theym of the plague, beynge parte of the totall summe before named) dyed in all .xx. M .i. C .xxxvi.
               This yeare for so much as the plague of the pestilence was so hote in the citie

of London there was no terme kept at Michelmas: to be short, ye poore citisens of Lōdon were this yere plaged with a treble plague, as with ye pestilence, scarsitie of money, and dearth of victuals:A treble or a three folde plague. the myserie wherof; were to long here to write: no doubt the poore remember it. God bee mercyfull vnto vs, and defend vs from the lyke, if it be his wyll.

               The seconde daye of October in the after noone was a solempne Obsequie kepte at Saincte Paules Churche in London, for Ferdinando the Emperour, late beynge departed out of this mortall lyfe, and lykewyse the morowe nexte after, in the forenoone where was a goodly hearce erected in the vppermoste
