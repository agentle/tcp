               Remember man both night and daye.
               Thou muſt nedes die, there is no nay.
            
            
               
                  THy mortall body formed
of clay,
               Will ſone reuolue and
paſſe a waye:
               But yet the time, houre,
or day,
               Vncertain is, wherfore
I ſay.
               Remember man.
            
            
               In youth or pleaſure,
               if thou put thy truſt,
               In honour, treaſure, or yet in luſt:
               Sone all thy ioy ſhall turne to duſt,
               For remedileſſe hens thou muſt.
               Remember man.
            
            
               All high eſtate and dignitie,
               Pompe, glory, wealth and ſoueraintie:
               It can not prolong thy life pardie,
               But all ſhall tourne to vanitie.
               Remember man.
            
            
               The mo thy yeres, the ſhorter is thy life,
               Againſt death there is no ſtrife:
               And no kin, frend, childe, nor wife.
               For thy pore wil be penſife.
               Remember man.
            
            
               Then helpe thy ſoule, while thou arte here,
               For though thy frend be neuer ſo nere:
               When thou art dead, and laid on bere,
               They all with thy goodes make good chere.
               Remember man.
            
            
               Art thou ſo foliſh for to beleue,
               That they thy ſoule wil releue:
               Or yet thy goodes in almeſe geue.
               Which to forgo, did thee ſore gruee?
               Remember man.
            
            
               Nay, nay, they wil ſay openly,
               It were much ſinne, and great folly,
               On him to rue or take pity,
               That kept his goodes ſo nigardly.
               Remember man.
            
            
               While thou haſt goodes, do almes deedes,
               Let vertue deſtroy all vicious weedes:
               And ſowe in thy ſoule, the holſome ſedes
               Of ſorowe and repentaunce that to heauen ledes.
               Remember man.
            
            
               Send forth before to make thy way,
               Charitable dedes, which ſhall and may:
               Conduct thee ſurely without delay,
               Paradiſe to wynne, at the endleſſe day.
               Remember man.
            
            
               Call alſo to thy memory,
               This world fraile and tranſitory:
               Ful of foule ſinne and miſery,
               To heauenly bleſſe cleane contrary.
               Remember man.
            
            
               Of Chriſt Ieſu the veruent loue,
               Remember man all thing aboue,
               Whom pity did ſtire, and alſo moue:
               To ſuffer death for thy behoue.
               Remember man.
            
            
               The fearful day of ſtrait iudgement,
               Fyxe well in thy intendement:
               Where man and woman ſhall ſoxe repente,
               Their ſinfull life and time miſpent,

               For getnot the infinite paines of hell.
               Being ſo feruent and ſo fell:
               That nothing can ſpeake, nor yet tell,
               Where dampned ſoules ſhall euermore dwell.
               Remember man.
            
            
               Remember thy ioy ineſtimable,
               So pleaſaunt and ſo delectable,
               Of paradiſe ſo comfortable,
               Prepared for perſons laudable,
               Remember man.
            
            
               Man, if thou kepe this thing in minde.
               And to thy maker be not vnkinde:
               Eternall ioy thou ſhalt then finde,
               Ordained by god for all mankinde.
               Remember man.
            
            
               The ioyes of heauen, the paines of hell,
               The paſſion of Chriſt, his death ſo fell:
               The worlde and death, conſider thou well,
               And Domes day, loue euery deale.
            
            FINIS.
