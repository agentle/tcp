            ¶To the Reader.
            
               THe thynges (among other) that are cheefly to be cōsidered, in this Iustification of a moste rightful case and innocēt person, against vniust slaūders and slaunderers: are the vnmeasurable crueltie and vntolerable trechery of the Papistes. Who to maynteine the wrongfull authoritie of their tyrannous kingdome, agaynst God and his Christ, and agaynst the Maiestie of lawfull Princes, whom God hath aduaunced to Souereintie for the mayntenaunce of his trew Religion, and for the welfare of the people committed to theyr charge: do so stoppe the eares and blynd the eyes of Princes with their horrible leazynges (where they take place and beare sway): as they nother can see the wronges done to their subiectes by those ministers of Antichrist, nor herken to

their iust complayntes, that they might vnderstand them and redresse them. For whereas they themselues hauyng shaken of al obedience towards God and his Ministers, and confounded the generall bonds of naturall and cōmon reason, do both resiste all law and lawfull Magistrates, and also (as much as in them lyeth) inforce men either to most miserable thraldome, (of conscience by forsaking God and all godlynesse, and of body by losse of goodes, landes, libertie, wiues, children, lyfe, and good name) or to some meanes to withstand so extreme wretchednesse whereunto they driue them by streyning them beyond all abilitie of humane patience: yit most slaunderously they beare the states and potentates of the world on hand, that those most innocent and giltlesse persons, (whiche stand in nothyng but onely that which their Prince hath both graunted and sworne that it should bee lawfull for them to do, and in such wise as he by lyke graunt and othe hath giuē them leaue and commaundement to do, as appeereth most euidently by his solemne Protestation and vowe made at the tyme of his ioyfull entry,

when he was first admitted to the superioritie of those countreyes, at the earnest request and intreataunce of the late Emperour Charles his father, who made the lyke solemne othe Protestation and vowe before him and with him:) are the authors, practizers and workers, of all disorders, confusions, mutinies, vprores, trubbles, rebellions, and treazons: only bycause that after suffrance of their excessiue tormēts, & the thrustyng of thē out of their natiue countreys: they giue them not leaue to tread thē vtterly vnder foot as myre, or rather to rid thē quite & cleane out of the world, with the Gospell and Religion of Christ. Which thyng they could not doe, if the Princes whō the Romish Antichrist holdeth yit captiue in the prison of superstitious ignoraūce, would vout safe but onely to stand as indifferent Iudges, and to make that simple account of them, which euen comō reazon would they should, that is to wit, as of their subiectes. For no rightuous Iudge condemneth without heering the allegatiōs of both parties, nother doth any rightfull Prince permit his subiectes to reuenge their owne wrongs, and much

lesse to oppresse, deuour, and eate vp one an other. Therfore when the hartes of the Souereine liege Lordes are so shet vppe, and their myndes so alienated aforehād, by the sinister perswasions of cankerharted Papistes and sly Sycophantes, which care not whose house be on fire so they may warme themselues by the coales of it, as no truth can haue enterance into their eares or accesse into their presence: needes must the people go to wrecke to the preiudice of the Prince, and the people being so wronged cā not but seeke to iustifie the right and truth of their cace, by all good and reasonable meanes, to the church of God, and vnto all such as are not so wholly caried away with blynd and fantasticall affection, but that they haue some abilitie to discerne right and equitie: as may appeere by the treatise heere insewyng. For heere is nothyng sayd or intended to the defence, maintenance or allowyng of any disobedience, disorder, or vnlawfull behauiour of the subiect towards his Prince: but to shewe most humbly and dewtifully both to Prince and subiect, the intolerable incōueniences that grow by neglecting the mutuall regard that eche of

them ought to haue of other, and by the permittyng of Papistes to intrude themselues into suche state of credite and authoritie, as they may be able to inforce a Gouernement to the vpholdyng of their owne kingdome.
            And forasmuch as in this treatise there is mention made of a Ioyfull Entrey: it is necessarie to know what the same was. Therfore it is to be vnderstode, that when soeuer any souereine Lord entered into the possession of dominion ouer the Low Countreys, whither it were by name of Earle, Duke, or any other title of superioritie: by succession, election, or otherwise: he first tooke a sacred and solemne othe, to mainteyne the Lawes, Statutes, Customes, Liberties, and Priuiledges of those Countreys, and not to procure, cause, suffer, or permitte the infrindging, breaking, abrogating, disanulling, impeaching, or altering of them or any of them, or the bringing in, setting vppe, or stablishing of any new, without the consent, counsell, aduice, and agreement of the states of the same Countrey, to the benefite and commoditie of the people: before the whiche othe he
                  •…
               
               
was in no wise allowed or acknowledged as Lord there. By reason wherof, Charles the Emperour, and his sonne Philippe nowe king of Spayne, to stablishe the continewaunce of their possession in those Countreys, as their predecessours had alwayes done at their first Entryes: did lately make solemne and faithfull promis, Protestation, vowe, and othe, as well for their heyres and successours as for themselues, that besides their maynteinyng of the cō
               mon weale, peace, rest, quietnesse, tranquilitie, and securitie of those Countreys: they and euery of them should and would keepe, obserue, and performe all the auncient customes, Lawes, Statutes, Liberties, and Priuiledges of the same inuiolable, and not bryng in any new customes or orders, or suffer any to be brought in: nor set any Gouerner, Magistrate or Officer ouer them or in authoritie among them, beyng not the same Countreyman borne and hauing landes goodes or possessions there: nor call any assembly of the States, nor cause any leuying of money or men of warre: no nor any coyning of money to bee made there, without the consent and aduice of

the States of the same Countrie. And for the more confirmatiō and assurance therof: after the rehearsall of the particular poyntes and Articles of the said Entrie, (whiche are many) they added in effecte this conclusion folowing: That if they, their heyres, or successors shall by them selues, or by any other, either wholy or partly, doo, or cause to be done, any thing contrary or preiudiciall to the premisses, after what sort soeuer it be: they consent, agree, and graunt to their Prelates, Barōs, Knights, Townes, Cities, Liberties, and al other their subiectes, that then and from thencefoorth they shall not doo to thē, their heyres or successors any kind of seruis, nor owe them any duetie of allegeāce, nor obey thē in any matters wherein they shal haue neede of them, or which they shall desire or require at their handes, vnlesse that vpon reconciliation, satisfactiō, and attonemēt, they be by the states of the same Countries accepted new againe. And to the same intent they decreed and ordeyned, that all officers appoynted or placed contrary to the faythful purport and true meanyng of this their sayd Entrie, should be dischargcd &

displaced: and likewise that what soeuer thing were or should be done or attempted in preiudice or impeachment of the premisses, should be esteemed as voyde and of none effecte. In witnesse and euerlastyng confirmation whereof, the said Emperour & the Prince his sonne did set their handes and seales to the sayd othe in writyng, at Louane the fift day of Iuly. 1549. And this is it that is called the ioyful entrie. Whereby, and by many presidentes of their stories, (whiche make mention how the people of those Countries haue refuzed, renounced, reiected, remoued, and depozed diuers of their Lords & soueraignes for their misgouernment, and for infrindging their sayd othe: and in their places elected, appoynted, set vp, and established others, of whose Iustice they had better opinion aud likelyhood: which thyng notwithstandyng they haue not vsed to doo, but vpon most vrgent and extreme necessitie, after long sufferance and seking of redresse by all reasonable meanes with most duetifull iutreatance, submission, supplication, and humilitie:) It may playnly appeare, that the state of the lowe

Countreys is not an absolute Monarchie or heritable kingdome, after the maner of this Realme, and of Fraunce, and such other like: but a State with condition, terminable, and not to continue any longer than the Lorde whom they doo so accept, vpon hope of his good gouernment, dooth continue in reignyng and rulyng accordyng to his oth taken at his entrie. Which if he violate, then are they by the same his othe discharged of their subiection and obedience to hym, and haue full authoritie and free libertie both to resist hym and his Officers, and also to chooze and take to them any other head or Soueraigne that wyll be more frendly and beneficiall to their Countrey, as appeareth by that solemne and autentike deede of Duke Iohn, dated at Louane the fourth of Maye. 1420. and by diuers other Records to the same effecte. Whereupon it foloweth, that this Iustificatiō of the Prince of Orendge, and of suche as take his parte, and of the cace wherein they stande, is most iust and rightfull euen in these respectes, though there were no further proofes, wberof notwithstandyng there are very many in this

treatise folowing. Thus I commyt thee to God, who giue thee the spirite of iudgement, to discerne accordyng to truth, that thou be not lead into errour, to allowe the thyng that is euyll, or to condemne the thyng that is good.
         
      
      
         
            
            ¶ A Iustification of the Prince of Orendge, against his sclaunderers.
            
               SUch as haue experience of the affayres of states and common weales, are wel able to discerne them that seeke to trouble the trauquilitie and quiet of the publike weale, through ambition and desire of priuate commoditie, and doo take all maner of straunge and vnaccustomed kinde of dealyngs, which mē of power, credite, and authoritie doo vse, to bee sure and infallible tokens of lyke driftes. And therefore to shewe who haue bin the chiefe ringleaders and authours of the troubles that haue happened in the low Countrey: the onely thyng to be considered, is, who they were that had cause to desire innouation in that Countrey, for any commoditie or profit which they looked for, and were the first beginners and putters therof in execution.
            For the doing wherof, in my opinion it is necessarye to set downe the state of the sayd low Countrey, in such wise as it was before the late troubles, and after the warres, whiche as well the late

right high and cenoumed Emperour Charles, as the kyng of Spaine, Princes of the same lowe Countrey, and soueraigne Lordes of the subiectes there, maynteyned in maner continually by the space of ten yeares together, against the French king. Which state was such, that although in the meane season the people were in some vnquietnesse, by reason of the Inquisition and Iniunctions that were obserued iu diuers Prouinces in the case of Religion, whiche vnquietnesse augmented dayly more and more through the increase of the Religion, and through the rigour of the Iniunctions
               It appeareth by the Iniunctions put forth in the yeares, 1521. 1526. 1529. 1531. 40. 44. 46. 50. 56. and others. (which grew so extreme, and so farre out of all square, as it was a woonder that they were suffered and borne withal so long tyme, and so patiently in so freee a Countrey,) as shalbe declared hereafter: yet notwithstāding it was euidently seene, that in all other respectes the subiectes were ready, not onely to yeelde al due obedience, but also to spend their bodyes and goodes for his maiesties sake.
            For the Nobilitie behaued them selues with incredible courage and forewardnesse in the sayd warres, and the States of the Countrey dyd freely and of their own accord geue an incredible

masse of money towards the charges thereof, amountinge fully to the summe of fourty millions of Florens: & that so wyllyngly, as there was neuer any signe of ini
                  •…
               ikyng perceyued for the matter: by reason wherof it might wel haue bene thought, that the Countrey was so affectioned towardes his maiestie, as they would not haue spared any thyng for the mayntenaunce of his state and honour against his enemyes. And therefore his maiestie might easily thereby assure hym selfe thereof against all forreyne powers.
            And for as muche as it is a naturall thyng, that all great seruices and well dooinges shoulde ingender truste: it could not be, but that the said countrey, (namely the Noble men in consideratiō that by their peril, bloudshed, & prowesse his maiestie had atchieued so many honourable victories, and the commons, for that he had dispatched so long and tedious a warre with so great honour, by their succour, ayde, and a
                  •…
               istaunce,) must needes be in great hope that his maiestie would haue regard of their so great duetifulnesse and notable seruice, whē so euer occasion were offered. By meanes whereof a man might also haue openly warranted the Countrey

from al inward troubles and commotions.
            For when the subiecte can looke for nothyng but well at his Princes hand, he continueth the more wyllyngly and earnestly in his obedience. So that cō
               sideryng how the state of the Countrey florished by the intercourse of al kindes of trafique and marchaundise, and of all other thyngs dependyng therupon: although it were sore nipped by the former warres, and ouercharged, & in maner oppressed with tallages, impostes, and exactions layde vpon them by reason of the said summes of money, which they had graunted to be leuyed for the charge of the sayd warres: yet is it most apparāt, yt beyng sure frō enemies with out, and vnited with their Prince within, and mainteined with priuiledges & ordinaunces accordyng to the tyme, it would not onely haue bin refreshed & set cleare, & discharged of all dettes, but also haue atteined to yt top of all worldly felicitie within few yeares.
            By meanes wherof his Maiestie cō
               myng to bee renowmed and feared of straūgers: and to be reuerenced & loued of his subiectes, might haue bin taken for the greatest kyng & happiest Prince of his time. In somuch as it must nedes

be confessed, that they whiche haue bin the hinderers of this prosperitie & happy state, by breakyng the sayd vnion, & by turnyng away the sayd affectiō, haue committed so great an offence to the domage of his Maiestie and of the cōmon weale, that they deserue to be punished and chastised to the example of others. And I beleue, that all such as see the coūtrey at this presēt, how it is brought from so apparaunt felicitie to extreme wretchednesse, bōdage, and miserie, wil

Who to pretend some cause and occasion that might haue prouoked vs thereto, and hauyng not any likelyhode that wee would enterprise it without cause: alledgeth that our ambition and vnordinate desire of authoritie was the cause of it. Whereupō it followeth that the finall cause of our doings and attēptes should be honour, desire of dealynges and extraordinarie authoritie.
            But to bereue the Attourney of that

groūd, wherupon he pretēdeth to build his accusatiō: it might suffise for such as are acquaynted with our person, to alledge myne owne naturall disposition, whiche is nothyng inclined to such desires: and for other men, to alledge the portion of worldly substaunce, wherewith God of his grace hath indewed vs by good gouernment & order, where through we might rather hope for aduauncemēt and authoritie, then by any other kynde of dealynges. For all men must needes graūt, that to get vs home to our owne house and to liue priuately, was a much better meane to gather treasure and riches, wherby to get, preserue, and mainteine authoritie: than to spend wastefully in the Court in hope therof by vsurping superioritie vpō vs. For they that haue any vnderstandyng at all of our dealynges, do know very well that I neuer passed for any superioritie. And in asmuch as the coūtrey is so affectionate to his maiestie, as is said afore, there is nothing more vnlikly thā to charge vs with intent of vsurpation, aboue the authoritie of hym and of the countrey.
            Specially seyng I was alwayes of opiniō, that his Maiestie should rather keepe still his subiects in the sayd loue &

good wil, by mitigating of his Edictes, than turne them away from it, by proceedyng with newe deuises of rigour: which is the only point & meane wherby it might haue bene pretēded, that we would haue atteyned to the foresaid attempt. For it cannot be denied, but that loue & good will are the meanes wherby a Prince may mainteine his authoritie and keepe his countrey. And therfore it must needes be confessed, that in being of that opiniō, we sought the preseruatiō of his Maiestie, and not the vsurpyng of authoritie ouer h

               n. Now thē whereas others were of opiniō that it was more expedient that his state should be mainteined by rigour: it followeth of necessitie that I was of contrary opinion vnto them, onely as touchyng the meane of the maynteinyng therof, but not as touchyng the maintenaunce and preseruation it selfe, whiche thing experience sheweth to be vnpossible to be done by rigour, so long as the foresaid countreys continue in this apparaunt prosperitie, wherein my desire was that they should haue bene mainteined, vnder his Maiesties iurisdictiō: whiche thyng was (next Gods seruice) the onely cause that I allowed not y• rigour of the foresayd Inquisitiō & Ed

               Wherof all our other doynges also will beare record, in that they be alienated or rather cleane contrary to all ambition. For euen before that time, I had giuē ouer my roome which I had in the Counsell of Estate, & the office of Lord TreasurerIt appeareth by the commissiōs dispatched therupō and sent backe agayne. An. 1558. apparant places to win the attendance & sute of all the states, yea & to bryng as it were the ouerrulyng of all affaires to my hands, if I had listed, & whereof other men had so good skill to make their owne gayne. But God be thāked, I was so farre of frō such meanyng, that when I saw I could not do his Maiestie good seruice in those offices as I would

               aine haue done, by reason of the practises of other mē that letted me: I surrendered thē both into his handes. And yet notwithstandyng, like as his Maiestie after our sayd demeanour, and vpon the surrender of our cō
               missions, left not to call vs often tymes to counsell: so we on our part haue discharged our selues as much as is possible, in coūsellyng him what we thought best for his seruice, and for the benefite of the coūtrey. And it was a great hartbreaking to vs, to see that a two or three persons should so ouerthrow his Maiesties good meanyng.
            Neuerthelesse whereas his Maiesty

haning knowē the sinceritie of my dealyngs, and my forewardnesse in his seruice of all that tyme, and beyng then in Zeland on his way towardes Spayne, 
                  •…
               treated me very earnestly to take vpō me agayne the state of a Counseller: I after much excusing of my selfe, obeyed him. Howbeit when I saw afterward, that thyngs kept on their wōted trade, and went farre otherwise than his Maiestie had put me in hope of: I sewed to be put of againe about a ij. yeares after. It appeareth by letters sent to the king the 23. of Iuly. 1561. And for asmuch as I saw them indeuer by all meanes to bryng the countrey to bondage, (which some mē terme full obediēce) as shalbe shewed hereafter: bycause I would haue no occasiō to deale with that poynt, which seemed to tend wholly to the hinderaunce of his Maiestie and of the common weale: I made the more earnest sute and intreataunce to be discharged of my gouernement, that I might withdraw my selfe, and intend wholly to myne owne priuate affaires, and not bee blamed for the inconneniēces that were like to ensue therof. To the which endIt appeareth by letters sent to the king the 11. of March 1562. & the 29. of Iuly. 1563. I made diuers sutes, as wel to his Maiestie, as also to the Regent, yea euen more then once after the putting vp of the petition of the Confederates, which is so greatly

            And surely if I had bene any thyng suspected of ambition, it is not likely that his Maiestie would haue refused to remoue me: at lest wise he would not so often ha

And therfore his maiesties causing of me to continue in the said rowmes & offices, is a plaine proofe directly against the allegation of the foresayd Attorney general, that neither before nor after his maiesties departing frō these low Coūtreys, I was neuer suspected of any ambitious desire of vsurpyng authoritie ouer him or his countreys. Nay rather it appeareth sufficiently therby, that I desired nothyng so much, as to be discharged of al administration and authoritie.
            And if a man consider how that afterThe vsurpa tion of the Cardinal of Granuil. the kyngs departure, the managyng of all affaires was in the hāds of the Cardinal Granuil, and how ielous the Cardinal was of his own estate: (insomuch as it was his common fashion to cause all such to be quyte banished & shet out from all authoritie and medlyng in matters

 of state, as seemed in any wise able to hinder the increase and continuance of his superioritie: as for example, in the tyme of the late renowmed Emperour Charles, hee perswaded his Maiestie to admit no Lordes of great valour to the affaires of the Empire, nor any such as might deface or diminish his authority: after the which maner (to come to particularities) hee delt with the Lord Ferdinando Gonzaga Gouernour of Millaine, and with Reinart a Counsaylour here: insomuch that while the Cardinal had the orderyng of the affayres of Italie, the sayd Lord Ferdinando was fayne to geue ouer his gouernment there, and euen vnto his dying day, to folowe the suite of a certayne criminal action, commenced agaynst hym by the Cardinals meanes, thereby to get the Spaniardes the ful superioritie of that countrey, like as they had of al other the kings dominions in Italie: And the sayd Reynart is constreyned to leaue his house, wyfe, chyldren, & goodes here in the low coū
               trey, & to get hym into Spaine, where he is like to ende his dayes as an exiled and banished man:) he shall not find it any thing likely, that if I had gone aboute to vsurpe authoritie aboue the king by my gouernment, (which thing

I coulde not haue done without diminishyng of the Cardinals authoritie) I should haue bin helde styll in the sayde offices: but rather cōtrarywise after the examples afore mentioned, I shoulde haue bin driuen to leaue them vnrequested, or at leastwise I should haue had leaue to depart from them vpō my first suit, and much rather vpon myne often renuyng of my sutes afterward.

And surely if I had had any intent to vsurpe the authoritie to my selfe alone: a more fit and conuenient occasion or meane could not haue ben offred me, than to see the Regent accomplishe her purpose. But because my meanyng was cleane cōtrary, I hindred it to the vttermost of my power, as is sayd asore.

            Whereupon it may be inferred, that we be not onely wrongfully, but also without all likelyhood of truth accused of practising to vsurpe against his maiestie, through ambition and desire of gouernment and superioritie, and for the same purpose to haue troubled the peace and tranquilitie of that countrey, to the whiche we be in maner as muche beholden, as to our owne natiue soyle: yea, and that without hauyng any regard to our owne losse & hynderance, which we should needs openly incurre by reason of the po

                liberties and fraunchises which they had as well by vertue of couenauntes made with their Princes, as by force of priuiledge obteined by them, and specially of the Emperours of old time, for feare least they might be depriued of thē by bringyng in of straūgers, and namely of the Spanyardes, bicauseThe practises of the Cardinall. the forenamed Cardinall had sayd, that the kyng should neuer keepe well those Coūtreys, vnles he mainteined a power of Spanyardes there, and caused the Pope to assoyle him of the othe that he made to them at their receiuyng of him, and conquered them new agayne, so as he might abolish all the sayd couenaūts and priuiledges, and rule them as he listed: whiche thyng he sayd could not be brought to passe, without ye cuttyng of, of iiij. or fiue of the chief princes heades.
            By reason whereof all innouations

became so much the more suspicious & odious, the rather bycause that in the tyme of the last warres, the extreme rigour of the Inquisition and Iniunctions had bin meetly wel moderated and bridled, and libertie procured by the brynging in of the Almayn souldiers (wherwith they were inforced to strengthē thē selues) to make Sermōs openly amōg them as well in Cities as in Townes, and secretly also among others in many

                and seruice done in the former warres, myght turne his mynd, so as he would rather

apply his determinations to the tyme, and stop all new deuices, yea, and the proceedynges of the Bishops, and the Inquisition, and the rigorous Iniunctions at the request of so loyall and faythfull a people, accordyng to their treaties and priuiledges: than to further so vnmeasurable alterations, at the pleasure of a straunger, and of certayne vnknownen persons, agaynst the oportunitie of the time, the priuiledges of the Countreys, his owne promises, and in effect euen nature it selfe: specially consideryng that the troubles in France were styrred vp at the same tyme, by occasion of Ordinaunces and Edictes tendyng to like effect, howebeit, that the Realme of Fraunce is not so frequented, and on al partes so inclosed and inuironed with Countreys that folowe the Religion, contrary to the Romishe Religion, as the sayd low Countreys are.
            And their hope was, that he would doo it so muche the rather, because the sayd innouations began also to be misliked of strangers, namely of the Archbishops and Bishops of the Empire, whose iurisdiction within their own dioces, was impeached by the foresayd erection of the newe Bishoprikes: and that his Maiestie would reape none other

profit by them, than to bestowe his authority vpon such as made open profession, that they woulde neuer thinke them selues beholden to hym for it.
            In respect of which reasons and other like, which euery man dyd set before hym, accordyng to the capacitie of his wyt, and specially vpō hope, which the said Countreys, as well generally as particularly conceyued of his maiesties goodnesse, for as muche as he no lesse than his predecessors, had alwayes dealt reasonably with them by Iustice, and accordyng to the customes of their countreys, and that wherin soeuer they foūd them selues greeued, they had bin woont to open it vnto his maiestie, by waye of request and complaynt: their desire was to take the same way nowe also, and thereby to aduertise his maiestie of the sayd innouations and inconuenicnces that wer like to ensue, if they were not remedied out of hand: in consideration wherof, as well on the behalf of the Regent, as of the Lordes assembled in counsell, (whom the Cardinall bare in hand (as is said afore) that they should be burthened with all incōueniences that might insue, as wel as he) the Baron of Mountignie, a knyght of the Order was In August. 1562. sente to his Maiestie in

post, with all speede that might be, with charge & instructiōs to shew the state & necessitie of the Coūtreys, & their generall mislikyng of the sayd innouations, which made the Noble men and states of the Countrey to surcease all further and particular pursuite of the matter, in hope that his Maiestie would vpon such declaration, take order for some amends, or at leastwise for some mitigation of those poyntes, wherewith they found them selues distressed and greeued: the rather, in as muche as for the staying of the incorporation of the Prelacies and Abbeys then vacant in Brabant, the Prelates & other Noble men of the Countrey, (like as they of Andwerp also had done) had sent their In February. 1562. deputies afore to In May. 1562. stop the Inquisition, and the bringyng in of the newe Bishop: whiche thing helde the Countrey for a tyme in suspence without any commotion or trouble, vpon hope that by those deputies of theirs, they should obteyne some such good redresse and cōposition, as the state of the case required.
            But yet notwithstandyng the stateAssemblyes at Sermons & to heere preachyngs. of Religion went foreward styll on all sydes, in so muche that in some places, men began to preach, not only secretly, (which thyng could neuer yet be letted

by any rigour) but also openly: namely at Ualenciennes, Tournay, and diuers other places, the occasions wherof wer geuen, or at leastwise increased, by the libertie of the Religion agreed vpon in Fraunce, for to their seemyng, they had deserued no lesse at the handes of their kyng and prince, than the Frenchmen had at theirs, and in as muche as they had in many respectes bin dealt withall after the same maner that the Frēchmē had bin, they thought also yt they deserued to obteine liberty of cōsciēce, as wel as they. And it was euident to be seene, that (in as much as those low countreis were inuironed with others that folowed euerycho
                  •…
               e the contrary religion, and that their mayntenaunce stood vpon the intercourse of marchaundise, and vpon the recourse and traffique of their neighbours thyther:) it was vnpossible for them to obserue che auncient ordinaunces and lawes of Religion any more, by whiche lawes although men had gone about to roote vp al Religion quite and cleane, yet notwithstandyng it was foūd by experience, that it grew and increased euen in the greatest rigor of all, and therfore that it is vtterly vnpossible to inforce or constrayne Religion or conscience, at leastwise any furtherforth

than to a kynde of dissimulation.
            Notwithstandyng all this, the Cardinall continued his bringyng in of the sayd Bishops, & his inuestyng of them, incrochyng to hym selfe the Archbishoprike of Mechline (by vertue wherof he intended to syt as Metropolitane and Primate of those Countreys, and to deuoure the Abbey of afflighem, which is the richest in all Braband, nexte to the Abbey of Saint Amand, which he had seised into his possession already) and partyng the residue among so vnfit and vnmeete persons, that men mocked at them openly. And although those inuestitures were made in some Cities without any open withstandyng, yet was it easie to be perceyued, that many folke misliked of it, and some also did set thēselues euen openly against it, namely they of Andwerpe, of Grooning, of Leedward, of Deuenter, and of Ruermond.
            And it was easie to see wherto these doyngs tended, in as much as the Cardinal (who ouerruled all the Counsaylers, yea and the Regent her selfe, and had so absolute power and authoritie) was become the head of all those Bishops, who by reason of their vnfitnes

and lacke of experience, should hang all vpon hym, by meanes wherof he tooke more vpō him thā euer any prince of the Countrey had done. And to mainteine, stablishe, increase, and augmente his authoritie by forcible meanes, he had set forewarde the Inquisition and the Iniunctions aforesayde. And to pleasure me withal, he had at his commaū
               dement, the geuyng, distributyng, & bestowing of all the kyngs offices, Benefices, and Fees, and likewise of the Regentes, also ouer and besides the helpes that he had of his owne and of his sayd Byshops. So that in conclusion he had opened himselfe the right way to get & mainteine superioritie ouer the kyng & his Coūtreys. And moreouer, to be aduertized trewly of thynges that were done euery where, and to hold in with the Kyngs and Princes that were next neighbours: hee had as it were in his hand & at his becke, all the kynges Ambassadours, Agentes, and deputies, and among others, his owne brother also, who did set the affaires of Fraunce in such a broyle, that for the benefite and quietnes of the same realme, the queene there did make very earnest request to the kyngs Maiestie to take him thence.
            Therfore whosoeuer looketh well to

theis things, shall eazly be able to iudge who it was that tooke vppon him authoritie aboue the kynges Maiestie: namely whither it was we whiche vsed not any of the foresaid meanes, (but vtterly misliked all innouations: and had once afore refuzed to be of the Counsell and giuen ouer the office of thief treazurer, desiryng nothyng so much as to haue bin spared afterward ageyne from Counsell in matters of estate and from office of gouernmēt, and specially from that Counsell): or the Cardinall whiche bare all the sway, & by his innouatiōs & extraordinary dealynges, shewed him selfe to haue the said authoritie, with intent to stablishe and mainteine himselfe in the same by their meanes, yea and in farre greater thā euer any Prince of the Countrey had.
            Surely I am of opiniō, that such as consider well the thyngs aforesayd and iudge of thein without affection, shall finde as litle reason why mē should go about to accuze vs in this behalfe, as why they should excuze the sayde Cardinall.
            But whē as the deputies of the Prelates had by meanes of rewardes and pensions obteined, that the Incorporation of the Abbyes should not go foreward:

and when as the men of Andwerp had obteined that no man should molest them with the Inquisition, & that they should bee winked at concernyng the bryngyng in of the new Byshop: for a
                  •…
               uch as the sayd Lord of Moūtignie was returned without sufficiēt resolution for the remedying of other inconueniences, so as there was smalf hope that matters should bee redressed, in as much as by meanes of the sayd Pensiōs the doynges of the Bishops (whose only labour was to bryng in the Inquisition) was furthered, and it was practized to disappoint the mē of Andwerp of the benefite of winkyng at them, & to bring them in subiectiō to the Cardinal, & vnder the Archbyshopricke of Mechlyne: y• Regent thought it good by the aduice of hir Coūsell, to informe the king once ageine of the state of the Countrey, and specially of Ualēcien & Turnay, where it seemed vtterly impossible to keepe y• people from the exercize of the Religiō, without a continuall garrison. Wherupon hir hyghnesse sent a Counseller of hirs named The yeere 1564. Armenteros to his Maiestie, so that in conclusion it was fully resolued by him, that the Cardinall the apparant authour of all the alterations and discontentementes, should get him

            But forasmuch as the Cardinals creatures continewed still their innouations, & managed all affaires in his absence after the same maner that he him selfe had obserued: the former disorders returned by and by ageyne. And it was vnpossible to remedy them, bycause of the disagreemēt that was betweene the three cheef Counsels, that is to wit, the Coūsell of the States, the priuate Coū
               sell, and the Counsell of the Erchequer, which were all three ouerruled in effect by the Cardinall and his creatures, but yit in such wise as they coulde neuer come to agreement among themselues. Wherein a man may note the notable leawdnesse and wylinesse of the Cardinall, who to keepe the rest of the sayd Coūsell of the estates from doyng such seruis to the kyng as they woold haue doone, had vtterly excluded them from all entrance & intermedlyng with checkermatters and matters of Law, and from all such orders as were taken in gouernement or otherwise, knowyng well that without the intelligēce of thē, it was impossible for them to consult & determine well of most matters of importance

            For there appeareth not any rebellion or commotion made against his maiestie, whereof we should be bounde to answere. And as for the said cōfederacy, it came not by our occasion, but by reason of the distresses that were caused by

the sayd Inquisition and Iniunctions, and by infrindgyng the promises made the yeares. 1550. 1555. 1562. 1565. and at other tymes, as hath bin shewed heretofore: and therfore the troublyng of the common Weale, and the dist

the hope that a number had conceyued vpon the returne and report of the sayd Lord the Countie of Egmond. It appeareth by two letters sent in the beginnyng of the yeare 1566.

                  heir hands. wherein they were of the same opinion that we be, confirmed by common experience, whiche was, that the Inquisition and rigour of the Iniunctions coulde neuer come to good, in so muche that by the examples whiche we

had seene afore in Almain, France, Ingland, and Scotland, we were driuē to confesse that the kynges resolution in that behalfe, could not but bryng great waste, desolation, & destruction to those Countreys, without any furtheraunce of his proceedings: wheras on the contrary part it was to be seene, that the Countreys which haue the libertie of Religion, or at leastwise of conscience, and where the Inquisition and the rigor of the Iniunctions is not put in executiō, continue in rest and quiet: which is an euident proofe, that to lyue without the Inquisition in libertie of conscience, is an other maner of thing, thā to liue loosely, lawlesly, and without order, as some haue falsly and sclaunderously reported: for otherwise the princes of Germanie, which set as much store by the rest and quietnesse of their Countreys, as the kynges maiestie doth, would in no wise abyde it, specially if they mistrusted that any disobedience would insue of it.
            And was so much the more confirmed in this opinion, because the confederates shewed not them selues stubborne, ne meant to obteyne their request by force, but onely sued that It appeareth by the request of the confederates and the answer thereto, which are both inserted hereafter. his maiestie (who (sayd they) was abused by certayne persons, which vnder the

colour and pretence of Religion, went about to satisfie their owne ambition & couetousnesse) would vouchsafe to take intelligence of their complaint and suit, and thereupon folow the aduice of his counsell, offryng them selues to be ruled and lead accordingly as the same being duely informed, should decree concernyng the matter of Religion. So that when they were once vp in this rebellion, conspiracie, or coniuration, he ought to haue inclined to their petition, and to haue regard of their supplications, either in that they required to haue their Noble mē heard, or for that all cō

And many good cōfederacies and holy leagues are founde to haue bin made heretofore, (as for example, the confederacies of the Machabees & other doinges) and that men may make them styll to the honour of God and to the prosperitie of their kynges and countreys: So that in my iudgement, there

can no rebellion be inferred vppon the poyntes aforesayd.
            For as touching that the cōfederats did promise and sweare to mainteine, helpe and defend one an other agaynst the Inquisition and Iniunctions: seeyng that that promise might haue bin made to cease by the meanes aforesayd, and they offered in effect by their petition to goe from it, because it seemed to be agaynst the kyngs commoditie, & to obey what soeuer should be ordeyned by the aduice of the States: it seemeth against reason, that whereas hunters and others that deale with the tamyng of vnreasonable beastes, do indeuour to put away their fiercenesse, moodinesse, and wyldnesse, by diligence, company, and cherishing, rather than by cudgelling, whippyng, and roughnesse, the kyng should by the froward instigations of the Cardinall and his hangers on, vse rigour and roughnesse towardes so loyall subiectes and faythfull vassals, rather than meeldnesse and clemēcie, to keepe them at his accustomed deuotion by surceassing (at leastwise for a tyme) the executiō of the sayd Inquisition & Iniunctiō, which (to all mens seemyngs) could not be set foreward nor continewed in that tyme, without apparant domage, hurt, & preiudice

to his Maiestie and Countreys, specially seyng that the former warres had already as good as suspended and asswaged the rigour of them as is sayd afore, whereby it was come to some discontinewation, and the variances and alteratiōs which had risen vp since that tyme euery where, seemed not to suffer that it shoulde by any meanes bee renewed and set vp agayne.
            And it should seeme that the Regent also was of the same minde: who before the commyng of the confederates, sayd that she had considered aforehand of the mitigation of the It appeareth by the purposed conceit of a new Edict.

And if any man will say she did it to an other end, only to bryng them a sleepe & to serue hir owne turne by them agaynste those that had ouershote thēs

            For although it may be inferred ther upon, that our meening extended not so farreforth: yit notwithstāding we agree fully with the opiniō of the kyng and of the Regent, in the point of keepyng cō
               pany with them, and in suffering them to haunt and frequent our howses. And

therfore in so doyng we haue not letted or hindered, but rather furthered his Maiesties good proceedynges and seruis: or else at least wise we haue bin deceiued by the foresayd declaration of his Maiestie and of the Lady Regēt, which is a sufficient excuce for vs agaynste all pretended fauoryng & furtheryng of the cōfederates, for asmuch as they nother be nor were rebels, or at leastwise were not so counted and taken to bee by the kynges Maiestie & the Lady Regent, and by all others in generall. For it is to bee noted that a generall errour or mistakyng, especially where it is caused by the kyng or prince himselfe hath the force of Law and right.

Wherby they shew euidently that they be fully mynded to practise all maner of violence, & in effect to minister extreme wrong in stede of full right, vnder the cloke and couert of Iustice, without regarde of any maner of Iustification or defence.
            To the whiche effect they accuse vs also for that some of the cōfederates had entered into armes, in diuers places: not consideryng that we be not bounde to answere for other mens doyngs, nor ought to be charged though some of the confederates perchaunce became rebels afterwarde, for asmuch as they were none such nor so taken to be at the

               uer was done in that behalfe, was done not only with out our aduice, but also to our vnutterable greef, and farre of from vs, for at that time I was in Holland, wher and not in any other place, I must needes haue leuyed men of warre, if I had bin

minded to vsurpe authoritie against his Maiestie, bycause the townes and fortresses there were at my cōmaundemēt.
            But myne intent hath bin nothyng els, but to pacifie the sayd coūtreys and the Prouinces of Zeland and Utreight beyng all vnder my gouernement, and to keepe them in obedience to the kings Maiesty, accordyng to my Commission and the Lady Regentes expresse commaundement geuen vnto me. So that, I haue indeuered to the vttermost of my power, to acquite my selfe well and faythfully of that charge, as the Presidentes, Counsellers, States, Officers, & Magistrates of the Cities of the same Countreyes can wel witnesse: and they are able to say whither I did euer minister any speech vnto thē, otherwise than to incorage thē in their obedience loyaltie, and seruis towardes his Maiestie, lyke as I haue done in all other places where I had any office or authoritie.
            Whiche thyng appeereth openly by this, that notwithstandyng all theis broyles, I haue by Gods grace vsed such forecast, as no place, towne, or fortresse of our gouernement hath bin destroyed, sacked, or turned away frō their dew obedience to the kynges Maiestie or the Regent.
            
               Out of the same forge commeth this forgerie also, which is put into the Citation of the County of Hoochestraten, wrōgfully slaundered to haue bin a furtherer of our ambitious practises: name ly that we should haue hild many suspicious communications and priny packynges at Hoochestraten, and that at Deuremond we should haue determined with the foresayd Countie of Egmond, and with the County of Horne, and with the sayde County of Hoochestraten, to enter into armes agaynst his Maiestie, and to keepe him from commyng into the lowe countrey, by force. For I reporte me to the Lordes that were at Hoochestraten when I was there, whither there were any other talke than of makyng good cheere, and of visityng one an other, and of feasting certeine straūge Lordes as frendes & alyes meetyng togither: so as it cā neuer bee auowed that any thyng was concluded there, that was woorthy to bee suspected, or any disloyaltie practised agaynst his Maiestie.
            Also it shall neuer be foūd true, yt we practised either at Deuremond, or any where els, to stop his maiesties cōming by force, or otherwise. For although we were aduertised that all our dooynges

were misconstrued to his Maiestie, to turne away the good wyll that he bare towards vs: in so much that there came to our handes the copies of certaine letters written by the Lord Frauntes of Alua, his Maiesties Ambassadour in France, to the Lady Regent, It appeareth by his two letters sent in the moneth of August. 1566. the contents wherof were, that the three within noted, (whiche were the Countie of Egmond, the Countie of Horne, and Wee) should be punished in tyme and place accordyng to their desertes, vntyll the whiche tyme he woulde that men should make good coūtenance towards vs: and that in effect these letters blamed vs for all the euylles that had happened in the sayd low Countreys, auowyng the same thyng to haue bin the principal cause of the foresaid meting at Deuremond: yet notwithstandyng we trusting altogether to our own innocē

There were certayne other poyntes treated of, whiche concerned them that were there, & their doynges, wherof I take it that the sayd two Lordes being then prisoners, haue made sufficient declaration. In respect wherof, and because they perteyne not

            Only this I adde, that he which had foreseene the outrages and violence vsed at this tyme in the low countreys, & had done his duetie and indeuor to stop them, accordyng to couenants with the Duchie of Braband, and accordyng to his owne oth and bond: should peraduēture not be thought worthy of blame for any other rebellion: consideryng that if he had mynded any such thing, he could haue found no meanes to doo it, than our aduersaries weene, were it not that the opinion which we haue conceiued of the kyngs goodnesse, (who notwithstandyng doth waste, destroy, an

            And therfore to come to other pointsThe words of the Summons. of our Summons, and nainely to that which importeth that we should haue

ayded and counselled the Lorde of Brederode, (chiefe of the rebels, as is there pretended) to fortifie his citie of Uiane, against the kyngs maiestie: I confesse, that commyng to Uiane certayne yeres before these alterations, and beyng told by the sayd Lord of Brederode, that his late Lord and Father had inioyned and commaunded hym by his last wyll and testament, to goe foreward with the fortifyingThe fortifying of the Towne of Vianen. of the sayde Towne, and of his house, lately begonne, desiryng me to geue him myne aduice for the fortifying therof: I confesse (say I) that I dyd so: wherupon it may wel be inferred, that I gaue the saide Lorde counsell to performe the last will of his sayd Lord and father deceased: but not that I ayded or counselled any captayne of Rebelles to fortifie the citie agaynst the kynges maiestie. By reason whereof, and for as much as it is no treazon for a man to geue his aduice vpon the fortifying of a place: it appearcth playnly, that those accusations tende but only to the defacyng of the truth, and to the oppressing of innocencie.
            And that so much the more, because that in the low Countreys it hath at all times bin lawfull for Gentlemē of abilitie & liuyng, to furnish & fortifye their

places wherof it hath bin sene, that many both of old tyme and euer since, haue bin fortified by vertue of the same liberty, not only vpō the Frontiers, but also euē in the myddes & in the very hart of the Countrey, which fortifying was so much the more lawful for the said Lord Brederode to make, because he held and possessed the said towne of Uiane with all right of soueraigntie. And although his predecessors had bin in controuersie at the law vpon that point of long time before: yet notwithstandyng he had continued styll in possession and seisure of the said royalties.
            And if a man looke more neare into the aduice: he shall fynd that it is against all reason and equitie, to grounde any crime of treason thereuppon, because it was not geuen vppon the principall poynt, that is to wyt, whether the fortification should be made or no, whereof the Lord of Brederode made no doubt nor scruple at al: but only vpon the maner and forme of the fortificatiō. Which not withstandyng could not haue bin folowed, vnlesse the poynt goyng afore, were fully concluded and agreed vpon, whereto none but the onely Lorde of Brederode should be bound to answer. And it maketh not to the matter, that

the fortification was put in execution after the commotions. For seeyng that the aduice was geuen before: respecte ought to be had to the same tyme.
            Wheras it is auouched that we shold haue suffred the said Lord of Brederode to leuie men of warre in the citie of Antwerp in the open fight & knowlege of al men, contrary to the expresse order then newly taken and proclaymed, & to shyp them to the towne of Uiauen, with all maner of munitions of warre. This shall serue for answeare, that although my commyng to the citie of And werpe was onely to keepe it in quiet and in obedience to the kinges maiestie, which thing may appeare by the Regents letters It appeareth by her letters dated the. 12. of Iuly. 1566. sent both to me and to the Magistrate of the town, yea & euē by the confession of the Attorney generall conteyned in the said Summons: yet notwithstandyng as soone as I vnderstood of the sayd leuying, and of the place where it was done: I declared it to the magistrate, and to the Markgraue, who is the chiefe Officer of the Towne, & vnto whom it belonged to looke to those and such other accidentes, and I commaunded hym (accordyng to the tharge that the Regent had geuen me by her letter directed to me in that behalfe) that

he should apprehend and attach the parties that dyd it. Wherupon the Markgraue departyng from me, and findyng the parties at a Table together, which were reported to be the makers of the sayd Musters: in stede of executing my commaundement, sate downe with thē, and afterwarde reported to me that he could not find them: by meanes wherof they had oportunitie to get them secretly away.
            It was very true, that long time beforeArtilery giuen to the Lorde of Brederode. these alterations, I presented the Lord of Brederode with three peeces of great Ordinance, which I caused to be shot new againe afterward at Utreight (a Towne of the kynges maiesties) in the open sight of all men, and sent them to the said Lord, howbeit long tyme before the sayd mustryng, when he was yet in the kyngs maiesties seruis, and had the charge of certayne Ordinance, vnder hym. So that it is no lesse agaynst reason to blame vs for geuyng and presentyng the sayd artilerie, than to blame them that preferred the sayde Lord of Brederode to the said Lieutenantship of the Ordināce, specially seeyng that the same Lord of Brederode beyng assured by the Regent (authorised by the kyngs maiestie, as is sayd afore)

that none of the things aforepassed should be layd to his charge, had not any reason to fortifie hym selfe, agaynst the kyng. Nother was there any likelyhood of cause why we should refuse the performāce and deliuery of the sayd gyft, which we had promised hym before, and which he knew to be redy and appoynted afore hande for hym, and to be as neare Uiane as vtreyght.
            Therfore to come to ye pithe of ye saidThe wordes conteined in the Summons. Summons, the effect wherof was that I should forbid certaine of the kynges maiesties places and cities, to receyue his garrisons, and among other places, in Zeland, whether it is expressely said, that we sent men to take it, thereby to shut the kyng out, and to stop his maiesties passage by sea: I doo not thinke that euer I vsed any suche speache as might minister occasion to deuise that accusation, or to cause it to be surmised, that if our part had had sufficient proofe of it, they should haue bin driuen to haue specifyed the tyme and place, seyng that all accusers are bounde of right to such specification. Yet notwithstanding for as much as Zeland is named amōg others, I wyllyngly graunt, that knowyng and hauyng oftentymes infourmed the Counsaile of the importance of

that Countrey, & being aduertised thatAll this appeereth by many letters sent in Marche. an. 1567. there was a drift in practising agaynst it, I sent the Lord Bouxtel thyther, to the end that no men of warre should be receiued there, without myne appoyntment, accordyng to the ordinary maner & custome, which is, that no such thing may be done in those countreys, but by the commaundement of the Gouernour of them. And I confesse also that hauing receyued aduertisement from the Captayne of Zeburge which is a Fortres in the Ile of Walcheren, a part of Zeland aforesayd, which was all vnder my gouernment) that two hundred souldiers were arryued there, sent from the Regent, to enter into the sayd Fortresse, & that he could not receiue them, as well for feare of some mutinie of his owne men, which were vnpayd, and woulde not abide that others stronger than thē selues should so openly step in among them: as also because of the strey
                  •…
               nesse of the place, and for scarsitie of victuals: I sent him word agayn, that I thought his reasons very good, & that he should not receyue any souldiers there, without further commiss
                  •…
               on from the Regent, and from vs as Gouernor there. Of the which distresses the Regent beyng likwise aduertised by the Captayn,

became of the same opinion that I was of: and sendyng money to pay the souldiers, tooke order that of the two hundred, no moe but fiftie should be receiued, whiche entered in anon after, by our commaundement to the Capteine by our letters.
            Now when report was made to the Regent how I had commaunded the said Lord of Bouxtell to receiue no garrison into the Ile, no not euen though it were sent from her highnesse: I intē
               ded to haue excused my selfe by my letters: howbeit that at that tyme such order had not bin expedient, bycause that as then I was at Antwerp & hir highnesse at Brussels, who in like caces concernyng my gouernement, had not bin wont to do any thyng without making of me priuy to it afore, and therefore I assured my selfe that she would not send any garrison into the Ile, without makyng me of coūsell therewith, seyng she might do it without let or delay: Wheras on the contrary part, vnder pretence of the sayd garrison, the fortresse might be surprised, (as hath bin seene to haue happened diuers times vnto others) for the which I might afterward haue bin driuen and constreined to aunswere, by much more apparaunt reasons than are

now made to accuze me withall. In so much that for th
                  •…
                more assurance of the sayd fortresse and countrey, I had good reason to forbyd the sayd Capteine and all others, (yea and that euen by special and expresse commaūdement) to receiue any garrison, bycause the fortresse was sufficiently prouided for already, and the want of vittels should bee increaced by the ouer increacing of the garrison.
            By reason wherof, and for asmuch as the other places and Cities of the Coū
               trey haue alwayes offered to spend their bodies and goods in his Maiesties seruis, & haue certified him that they needed no garrison, by sendyng their deputies to the Gouernesse for the same purpoze: there was no likelihode at all that I shoulde by that meanes surprize the sayd Coūtrey, and by that shift shet out the kynges Maiestie, and cut of his passage by sea, seyng that the very deede it selfe hath bewrayed and shewed the contrarie.
            For at such time as certeine Barkes loden with men whom I had put out of And werp by open Proclamation for the better assurāce of the rest and quietnesse of the towne, came before the Ile: the inhabitauntes did set themselues at defence, & woold not suffer them to take

               rode. Which thing caused great vprore and hurlyburly in the Towne, where both the Lord of Hoochestrate & I, were often in daunger of our lyues, (by reason of the Magistrates cowardlinesse in that he durst not shew himself, which gaue great occasiō of the vprore, to the breach of ye peace there stablished) bycause it was thought that we letted the succours that some intended to haue ministred vnto them, (togither with the outrages that leawd folkes attempted to practize,) howbeit that in the ende through Gods goodnesse we appeazed all without any bludshed. Which dealyng of ours argueth vs to haue bin farre of from sending those mē into Zeland to surprize the Coūtrey, in asmuch as all our doynges tended to the contrary. For had that bin our purpoze, wee shoulde not haue commaunded the Capteyne and the men of that Countrey to receiue no mē of warre, but contrarywise to haue receyued them and

taken them in: and it appeered so much the more, in that wee offered the men of Andwerp, to goe out of the Towne and to discōfite the assembly our selues, with such company as was there which thyng was misliked of for feare of commotiō, which discouered it selfe after the sayd discomfiture as hath bin sayd afore.
            Now then seyng there was no lookyng for his Maiesties cōmyng by sea: there was not any likelyhod that by the takyng of Zeland wee ment to stop his passage and to shet him out of it, whiche thyng (cōsideryng how the townes and fortresses were at his Maiesties deuotion) it was not possible for vs to do by sending mē without head, without capteine, without authoritie, without expresse cōmaundement from vs, & which could not bee receiued there bycause of our order taken to the contrary: but in that cace we should haue bin there personally in the Countrey, whereby I should haue giuen some cause for men to thinke, that folke would euery where haue stooped to me as to their gouernour, and haue yelded me their accustomed obediēce, as they had done in all other Cities and holdes of our gouernement: for that had bin a more apparant and sure meanes, than to send thither a

sort of rascall fellowes, vnarmed vngouerned, and vnguided (for whom we should at leastwise haue prouided in a cace, beyng so well able to doe it by meanes of the towne of And werp as euery man knowes) and which were afterward dispatched in manner without any resistence or defence, in somuch that no man hauyng any experience of the warres, would haue trusted to them in an exployt of importāce, and much lesse I, who had farre better meanes to assure me of the Countrey, if I had mynded it, as I did not. And therfore I mar uell that men of skill and wisedome wil vse such allegations, whereof they not only nother haue nor euer shalhaue any proofe, but also which haue not in them any shewe of likelyhode.

that so much the rather, byeause winter was at hand, by reason whereof, otherwise an other secōd inuasion was to be feared, wherin the other churches were like to haue bin taken: and therfore the Magistrate was not only willyng but also desirous to further the sayd Churches: whereunto bycause we sawe that all others had no lesse good will thā he: wee thought it stoode not in any wise with our dewtye, to hinder the thyng that might assure vs of the execution of our charge.

                  PHilip by the grace of God, kyng of Castile, Lyons, Arragon, and Nauarre▪ &c. To our chiefe Hussher or Serieant at Armes, vpon this required, Greeting. We are informed by our welbeloued and faithfull Counseller

and Attorney general, that the Lord William of Nassaw Prince of Orēdge, hauyng receiued both of our late Lorde and Father the right noble Emperour Charles the fift, (to whom God grant rest) and also of vs since our commyng to our state, many honors and promotions, as our choozing of hym to be a brother of our own Order, our naming and admitting of hym to be of our coū
                  sell of estate, and our preferryng of hym to diuers goodly Roomes, Charges, & Offices: as namely to the gouernment of Burgundie, Holland, Zeland, and Utreight, together with the Lieutenantship of our Ordinaunce, besides a number of other notable rewardes, wherby he might see the great trust and estimation that I alwayes had of hym, in respect wherof he should do the more amisse, in behauing hym selfe otherwise than becomes a good subiect. Yet notwithstandyng, hauyng sinall regard of his owne honour, and to the othes of faithfulnesse and loyaltie, which he had geuen to vs as to his soueraigne Lord, and in respect of the sayd Order, and of the sayde Roomes and Offices, hath made hym selfe the head author, furtherer, fauorer, and harbrower of Rebels, Conspirators, Coniurators, mutiners,

priuie practizers, and disturbers of the common welfare and quietnesse. For as it were immediatly after our departure out of that Countrey, towardes our Realme of Spayne, he and certayne others practised to take vpō them & to vsurpe the whole orderyng and gouernyng of our Countreys thereawayes. And for the accomplishment thereof, he wrought and conueied many secret and pernicious practises, wherein he ouershot hym selfe

                  ould be (which was neuer so) to bring the Spanish Inquisition into those our Countreys, in so much that by his like inductions and impressions, many of our subiects haue rizen vp and rebelled agaynst vs, and specially the sayde prince hath seduced, corrupted, and stirred

vp a great part of the noble men, & gētlemē, so as they haue made leagues, conspiracies, & coniurations, & sworne to defend & strengthen themselues therby against vs and against our ordinances which haue bin alwayes kept and obserued in those Countreys. And for the same purpose he hath made assemblyes in his owne houses, as well at Breda, as in this our city of Brusselles, yea and afterward receyued the Rebels into his protection and safegard, with promise of his assistence. Whereupon they haue put them selues in Armes against vs in diuers places of the countrey. Also the sayd Prince hath coūseled and ayded the Lord of Brederode cheef Capteine of the Rebelles, to fortifie his towne of Uiane agaynst vs, and suffered him to leuye men of warre in our Citie of And werp in the open sight and knowledge of all men, contrary to the orders then newly taken and proclaymed, and to shyp them to the sayd town of Uiane with all manner of warrelike munitions, moreouer furnishyng the sayd Lorde of Brederode with certeine peeces of artillerie, besides that he forbade certeine towns & places to receiue any garrisons frō vs, & among others, our coūtrey of Zeland, vnto the which

he sent men of purpoze to surprize it, & by that meanes to shet vs out, & to stop our passage by sea. Furthermore where as the sayd Prince was sent to our Citie of. Andwerp to pacifie the trubbles and commotiōs of the people: he of his owne priuate authoritie and besides his commission, hath permitted and graunted the exercize of all sectes indifferently in the Citie, and giuē the sectaries leaue to erect many Temples and Consistories, according whereunto they were erected in deede, whereof haue insewed the incōueniēces & dangers which euery man knowes of. Also he hath suffred leuyinges, taxations, and collections of money to bee made, whiche afterward were imployed about the payment and wagyng of men of warre. Many other thyngs hath he done duryng his abode there, whiche our Attourney shall declare more at large, & make apparāt in dew tyme & place, if neede be. Al which thynges tend to his foresayd drift, that by that meanes hee might vsurpe vpon our subiectes, & take vpon him the authoritie that belongeth allonly vnto vs, which is apparātly high trazō not to be borne wt nor to be winked at, but worthy of punishment and correction to the example of others, if it be as our said

Attourney sayth, who requireth that it may pleaze vs to graunt him cōuenient prouision accordyng to the crime, with clauze of authoritie agaynst the sayde prince of Orēdge. Therfore be it knowne to you, that we hauyng considered the thynges aforesayd, doe commaunde and authorize you by theis presentes, that at the request of our sayd Counseler & Attourney generall, you put foorth your selfe, and (with such ayde and assistaunce as you shall thinke meete,) attache and apprehende by the body the sayd Prince of Orēdge wheresoeuer ye shall fynde him in our sayde Countreys heere, and him leade and conuey vnder good & sure gard, to the prisons of our Court in our sayd Citie of Brussels, there to appeere before our right deere and trusty Cousin, Knight of our order Gouernour & Capteyne generall for vs of our sayde Coūtreys the Duke of Alua, Marquis of Coria &c. appointed purpozely by vs for the same matter, & to receiue punishment and correction for his sayd crimes and cōspiracies, accordyng to the desert of them, as shalbe founde meete by reason and equitie in that cace.

               ¶ An abstract of the last Letters & writynges sent by the kyng to the LadyNo. 2. Regent, togither with the last dispatch concernyng the cace of Religion.
               
                  FIrst as touchyng the Iniunctions and decrees as wel old as new wich concerne the cace of Religion, his maiestie vnderstandyng in what state Religion stode in those quarters, thought it not expedient to make any chaunge or alteratiō of them, but that as well the Iniunctions of the late Emperours Maiestie, as his owne Maiesties Iniunctions should be put in executiō: for he saw that the cause of all the mischief that had happened, & the cause of the increacyng & spreadyng of it so farre, had bin the negligence, cowardlynesse, and dissimulation of the Iudges. And therfore if there were any

of them that either durst not or would not execute their office for feare of sūme hurlyburly: they should aduertize his Maiestie, that he might prouide others of more corage and better zele towards the execution of thynges, wherof there ought to be no want in that Countrey where there is such store of Catholikes, and so many desi
                     •…
                  ous to do God & his Maiestie seruis: by the doyng whereof & the executyng of the Iniunctions, there was good hope that ye hurt which was done there, would better and sooner be remedied, than by any other way.
               Secondly, as touchyng the Inquisitors of the fayth, his Maiestie chargeth hir highnesse to beare such an euē hand, as they might be fauored in the executiō of their Commission, as the thyng that was expedient for the benefite and vpholdyng of the Religion: for it was his Maiesties mynde that the Inquisition should be executed by the Inquisitors as it had bin thitherto, and as belonged to them by the lawes of God and man: affirmyng that it was no new thyng, for asmuch as it had bin vsed cōtinewally, as well in the tyme of the late Emperour, as in his owne time, and the incō
                  ueniences that were to be feared were much apparanter, neerer, and greater,

where the Inquisitors were not suffered to prouide for things accordyng to their office, nor ayded in their doynges. And for 
                     〈◊〉
                   as hir highnesse knew what that ment, his Maiestie charged hir to do what she could in that behalfe, (for it was very requisite that shee should so doe) and not to consent that any other thyng should bee treated of in that behalfe, bycause hir highnesse knew how neere it touched hys hart, and what pleasure and contentation it would bee vnto hym.
               Thirdly, his Maiestie tooke order with her highnesse, that sith the holy Councell of Trent was already published, so as ther remayned now no more to doo, but the puttyng therof in execution, which was a thyng that belonged to the Bishops: her highnesse shoulde giue them all the furtherance and helpe that shee possibly coulde, that it might take effect as it ought to doo. Also he would that the Decr
                     •…
                  es of the Councel of Trent that concerned the reformation of the lyues and maners of the Clergie, should be put in execution: chargyng as well hir highnesse, as all his Officers, to fauour and further them by all requisite meanes: and that if neede should require any further prouision to

be made on his maiesties behalfe, shee shoulde cause it to be dispatched out of hande, that euen where the men of the Church would not obey the reformation that was to be made by the bishops, there they might be framed and made conformable by the Decrees of the sayd Councel of Trent.
               And finally he affirmed that the thinges which his maiestie had written to her highnesse, as hath bin sayd heretofore, concerned the prosperitie of Religion, and of the countreys there, which would be nothyng worth, without that Order, for that was the onely way to kepe them in iustice, peace, and tranquilitie. And seeyng that her highnesse knewe what commoditie it brought: he desired her eftsoones to folow that way whereby the foresayde thynges might take effect, for it was the thyng wherby his maiestie should receyne moste contentment, as well at the handes of her highnesse, as of the Lordes that were about her: to whom he would haue her to geue the same charge, to the end they should imploy them selues therunto, as his maiestie hopeth that they wil, without faile, because they be sure that he wil like well of it, besides that they shall therein doo the duetie of such personages

as they be, and accordingly as they be bound to doo in respect of their seruis towards God and his maiestie, & in respect both of the benefit of the whole Countrey there, and of their owne peculiar welfare.

               ¶ A Supplication of the Noble men of the low Countrey, presentedNo. 3. to the Lady Regent the Duchesse of Parma and Pleasance, the fift of Aprill. 1566. before Easter.
               
                  MAdame, it is well enough knowen, that the people of the low Countrey haue alwayes & yet are styll greatly renowined throughout all Christendome for their great faythfulnesse towardes their naturall Lordes and Princes, wherin the Nobilitie and Gentlemē haue alwayes gone foremost, as they that neuer spared either body or goodes, in the mayntenance and increasement of their Princes states. And in the saine manner we his ma

                  sties most humble subiects are mynded to continue styll, from well to better, so as we be ready night and day to doo hym humble seruis both with our bodyes & our goodes. And for as much as we see in what plight thinges stand at this present, we haue chozen rather

to hazard the bryngyng of some mislikyng and displeasure vppon our owne heades, than to conceale suche thynges from your highnesse, as might hereafter turne to the preiudice of the kyngs maiestie, and therwithal disturb the peace and quietnesse of the Coūtrey. Hopyng that the euent wyll shewe in time, that of al the seruises which we either haue done, or shal doo to his maiestie hereafter, this is worthy to be takē for one of the noblest, and to best purpoze: in respect wherof we be throughly perswaded, that your highnesse can not but take it in good worth. Therefore Madam, although we doubt not but that all that euer his maiestie hath decreed both heretofore, and now newly again at this present, concer
                     •…
                  yng the Inquisition, and the streight obsernyng of the Iniunctions in the case of Religiō, haue some good grounde and iust title, namely for the continuyng of the thynges which the late Emperour of noble memorie Charles, had vpon very good meanyng determined and stablished: yet notwithstandyng, seeing that the diuersitie of tymes bringeth diuersitie of remedyes with them, and the sayd Iniunctions haue already geuen occasion of many griefes and inconueniences

now many yeares since, for all the executyng of them with extreme rigour. Surely his Maiesties laste resolution whereby he not only forbyddeth the mitigatyng of the Iniunctions any whyt at all, but also commaundeth expresly that the Inquisition should proceede, and the Iniunctions be executed with all rigour: doth giue vs sufficient cause of iust feare that therby not onely the inconueniences wyl be greatly augmented: but also there wyl in the end insue some general commotion and insurrection, tendyng to the miserable ruine of the whole Contrey, accordyng as the manifest tokens of m

                  tinie among the people, (which appeareth already euerywhere) doo shewe vs openly to the eye.
               Wherfore consideryng the apparāce and greatnesse of the daūgers that manace vs, we haue hoped hitherto, that either the Lordes or els the states of the Countrey would haue aduertized your highnesse therof one tyme or other, that you might haue remedyed it by remouyng the cause and grounde of the mischeef. But when we sawe that they did not put forth thēselues to do it, by reasō of sum occasions to vs vnknowen, and that in the meane while the mischeef increaced frō day to day, so as it was lyke

to come to a generall insurrection and ceuolt: we ha

                     •…
                  e in the open fieldes, redy for all men to pray vpon: and also forasmuch as if we should follow the rigour of the sayd Iniunctiōs, in such wise as his Maiestie commaundeth vs expresly to procede, their should not generally be any man amōg vs, no nor in all the Coūtreys heeraboutes, of whatsoeuer callyng state or degree hee were, which should not roune in daunger of losse both of body and goodes, & bee subiect to the slaunder of hym that would bee his enemye who to haue a share of his goodes so forfeyted, might

accuse him vnder pretēce of the sayd Iniunctions, wherein there was none other refuge left for the defēdant, but only if the officer listed to winke at him, at whose curtesie both his life & his goods did wholly stād. In consideration wher of, we haue the more cause to beseeche your highnes most humbly, (& so do we in deede by this our Supplication) to voutsafe to take some order in the cace, & (bycause it is a matter of great importance) to send a fit and conuenient person to the Kynges Maiestie with all speede possible, to aduertize him therof, & to beseech him most hūbly on our behalfe, that it may pleaze him to prouide remedy in that behalfe as well for heerafter as for the present tyme. And that for asmuch as that cānot be done by sufferyng the sayd Iniunctions to stand in force, bycause they bee the very welspring and roote frō whence all the sayd inconueniences spryng it may pleaze him to giue eare to the abolishyng of them: which he shall finde to be necessary for the turnyng away of the vniuersall ruine & destruction of all his countreys heere.
               And to the intent his Maiestie may haue no cause to thinke, that we which haue none other meenyng than to yeld

him most humble seruis, would take vpon vs to bridle him and to bynd hym to the stake at our pleasure, as we dout not but our aduersaries will incēse him to our disaduantage: it may please him to make other ordinaūces by the aduice and consent of all the States assembled generally togither, to prouide for the things abouesaid, by sum other meanes more fit and conuenient, and without any euident daunger.
               Also we most humbly beseeche your highnes, that in the meane seazon while his Maiestie may take intelligence of our inst request, and determine thereof accordyng to his good & rightfull pleasure, you will prouide for the sayd daū
                  gers by a generall surceassing, as well of the Inquisition as of all executiō of the sayd Iniūctions, vntill his Maiesty haue taken other ordre in the matter.
               And we protest expresly, that (asmuch as in vs lay) we haue discharged our dewries by this present aduertizement: so that we do now vnburthē our selues of it before God & mē: declaryng plainly, that if any iuconuenience, disorder, sedition, reuolt, or sheadyng of blud insew thereof herafter for want of redresse in tyme, we cannot be blamed of the cō
                  cealyng of so apparāt a mischeef. Wherin

we take God, the kyng, your highnesse, the Lordes of the Counsell, and our owne consciences to witnesse, that our proceedyng therein hath bin as becommeth the kynges good & trusty seruaūtes, and faythfull subiectes, without passing the boūdes of our dewty in any point in respect wherof also, we beseech your highnesse so much the more instātly, to voutsafe to giue eare to it, before any further harme insew thereof. So shall you do well.
            
            
               ¶ The Answere and Replication made to the sayde Supplication in the Counsell of the States by the Lady Regent, was as followeth.
               
                  HIr highnesse hauying consideredNo. 3. the petitions & demaūdes conteined in the said Supplication, is fully determined to send it to the kyngs Maiestie and to offer it vnto hym with all kynde of dewtifulnesse that she cā deuize to serue hir, to moue and incline his Maiestie to cō
                  descend to their requestes afore shewed: tellyng thē that there was no cause for them to hope otherwise, than for all thynges meete and agreable to his natiue & accustomed goodnesse for the furtheraunce

whereof, hir highnesse by the ayde & aduice of the Rulers of the Prouinces, the Knightes of the Order, and the Lordes of the Counsell, had taken peynes to deuize and penne a moderation of the sayd Iniunctions in the cace of Religion, before the commyng of their informatiōs, to be presented to his maiestie. Which moderation hir highnesse hoped should be such, as should be able to content euery man with reason. And for asmuch as hir authoritie (as the playntifs thēselues might well vnderstād and perceiue) stretched not so farre as to surceasse the Inquisitiō
                   and Edictes as they required: and againe it was not meete to leaue the countrey lawlesse in the behalfe of Religiō: hir highnesse hoped that the playntifes would hold thē
                  selues contēted with hir sendyng to the kynges Maiestie: promising to take such order in the meane while till his answere were returned, that as wel the Inquisitors themselues where any were alredy, as also their officers should in that respect proceede discretly and modestly in their Commissions, so as men should haue no cause to cōplaine of thē. And hir highnes trusted that the plaintifs also would behaue themselues in such sort, as they should haue no neede

to deale otherwize: for she hoped to behaue hir selfe so well and dewtifully towardes ye kings Maiestie, as he should be contented to discharge all others of the Inquisition where it was, as may be perceiued by his exemptyng of Brabād frō it at the sute of the cheef Cities therof. And hir highnesse intēded to preferre all good meanes to hys Maiestie so much the more freely, to the end and effect aforesayd: bycause she did surely beleue
                     •…
                  , that the playntifes had no determinate purpoze or intent, to alter any thyng of the auncient Religion, which had bin obserued in those Countreys, but rather mynded to keepe and maynteine it to the vttermost of their power. Done by hir hyghnesse at Brusselles the xvi. of Aprill. 1565. before Easter, vnder signed. Margaret.

Countrey togither, did put vp a certein Supplication vnto vs in the moneth of Aprill last past, the effect wherof was that it might pleaze the kynges Maiestie to abrogate and abolish the Inquisition and Edictes, as well old as new, (which they sayd were ouerrigorous & therfore could not be put in execution) and in sted of thē to make others by the generall aduise and consent of the states of the sayd Countrey, beseechyng vs to send the same Supplication to his Maiesty, that he might prouide for it: wherupon we hild many great consultatiōs with the gouernours of the Coūtreys, the Knightes of the Order, the Coūsell of estate, & his Maiesties priuy Counsell: after we had preferred ye whole vnto him, togither with our aduice therin. For asmuch as we sawe that the sayd Gentlemē might perchaunce haue some scruple or dout, that y• kyng would take in ill part their sayd Supplication togither with the confederacie which they had made therupon amōg themselues, & all that had insewed therupon: which misdoutyng might cause some greater mischeef in those coūtreys: We thought it good by the aduice aforesayd, and vpon deliberation as is mencioned afore, to sew to the kynges Maiestie, that it

might pleaze him likewize to giue them letters of assuraunce, that they should not be charged with any thyng hereafter, that had bin do by the occasiō therof. Whereupon his Maiestie hath certified vs of his good pleazure and meenyng, accordyng wherto we tenderyng the benefite, rest, and tranquilitie of the sayd Countreys, and to mainteine the sayd Gentlemen in such wise as they may the more willyngly yeld their obedience and seruis to his Maiesty, accordingly as they be bound as well by nature as by othe, and as they themselues haue alwayes offred: we (I say) at their request and information, by the power & authoritie which we haue vnder his Maiestie, as Regent & Gouernesse generall of theis his Countreys, and by the aduice of the foresayd Gouerners, Knightes of the Order, and Lordes of the Counsell of state beyng with vs, haue for their sayd assurance giuē them a Charter signed with our hand in maner and forme followyng.

               We doo you to vnderstande, that all things afore mentioned considered, and by the kings maiesties consent and good will,

and by the power and commaundemēt whiche we haue from hym, we in the name and by the power aforesayd haue promised, and by these presents do promis, that nother his Maiestie nor we, wyll blame or charge the said Gentlemen for the foresayde Supplication or the confederacie made therupon, or for any thing that hath insued of them vnto this present, so their othe and faythfulnesse whiche they haue giuen and plighted vnto vs, as well for them selues as for the confederates, be conformable to the poyntes and articles aboue specified, and wherunto they haue bound them selues. Therefore on the kings maiesties behalfe, we wyll and commaund all Gouernors, Knights of the Order, Lords of the Counsell of Estate, the Chiefe, the President, and the Lordes of the priuie Counsel, and all other his maiesties Iustices and Officers, to whom this cace perteyneth, to mainteine this present assurance, and to cause it to be mainteyned, in

                  . of Iune. You might haue vnderstoode by that which I wrote to my syster, how small

cause you haue to thinke the thinge that you writ to me in your letter of May, or rather that you ought to thinke the cleane contrary. And surely you should be much ouerseene, if you should thinke that I trusted you not in all thinges, or that if any body had gon about to make me conceiue amisse of your duetifulnes towards me, I would haue bin so light of credit, as to beleue it, hauyng had so great experience of your loyaltie and good seruis. Therefore you may forbeare your mistrust in that behalfe, and referre your selfe to the letters whiche you haue written heretofore in that matter, and to your owne doyngs, and not to the things that may haue bin put into your head, by some that perchance are enemies both to my seruice, and to your welfare. As touching the leaue that you sue for, to geue vp your Offices: I am sory that your priuate affayres are in suche state as you speake of: howebeit seeing that the state of those Countreys is so tickle as it is, I can not forbeare to tel you, that it is no reason that such personages as you be, in whom I trust, and vpon whom I rest, should nowe abandon them, specially sith I am so farre of from them: but rather it were more reason that suche as

are at home in their houses, shoulde come running out at such a time of nede and put to their helping hande as they be bound to doo, and as you haue done at this present in goyng to And werpe, whereof I like very well, assuring my selfe that you wyll doo there what soeuer is most expedient for my seruis, and for the peace and tranquilitie both of the Citie and of the Countrey, and also for the redresse of such disorders as are ther, according to the truste that I haue in you: and so to doo I geue you expresse charge and commission, knowing that you wyll not shewe your selfe otherwise towardes me, than you haue bin of all your lyfe long. And to the ende you may see howe freely I deale with you, I can not spare to tell you howe it is much spoken of here, that your brother is a medler in the thinges that are done there, as you be. For as muche therfore as I can not but greatly mislike of it, I charge you to looke to the redresse thereof, that he proc

                  MAdame, although I wrote to you at large a fifteene dayes ago, and also by the Post that came out of Spayne, as he passed this way a six & twēty dayes since: yet notwithstandyng for as much
                     •…
                   as yesterday I receyued aduertisementes from out of Spayne, I purpozed to giue your highnes intelligence of them incontinently, and to send you the copies of the two letters that were writtē vnto me, wherby you may see many suche poyntes, as I am sure you wyll very well like of, and also vnderstand the good order which the kinges Maiestie hath taken, and the great preparation that he maketh dayly, as well to withstād the Turkes power, if it should aduenture to arriue vpō those Coastes, & to profer any attēpt, as also to bring all his subiectes to the obedience of God and of hym selfe. Also your highnes shal vnderstād, how well your manner of dealyng is liked of, whiche you haue vsed since the styrre that hath happened in the coūtrey where you be:

and that the last poynt concernyng intelligences and strong places, is found very good, and to very great purpoze aboue all the rest. In so much that now by that meanes the kyngs maiestie maketh full account to bring his matters about with small payne

                  nd resistence, contrary to the doubt which he had of it at the beginnyng: specially for as much as the straungers meddle not oner farre, and also by reason of the continuall wisedome and cunnyng handlyng of thynges, where with your highnesse hath begonne to order the whole matter. For I am well able to assure you, Madame, that his Maiestie attributeth the preseruation of his low coū
                  treys vnto you, next after God: who of his grace wyll bring to passe, that this inconuenience whiche is befallen, shall t

                  rne so greatly to his benefit and commoditie, as he shall see them brought wholy vnder his obedience, and to such state, gouernment, and rule, as his predecessors could neuer attayne vnto, and which he hym selfe had so long desired & labored for, together with this occasion which no good seruant of his wyll counsell hym to looze, wherby he is in forewardnesse to subdue the one sort, and to ryd his handes of the other, as

he hym selfe shall find best, and perceiue to be most expedient for the incounteryng of thyngs hereafter, to the benefit of his affayres in the saide Countreys. And for as much Madame as the point which to my seeming is of greatest importance and of most necessitie as now in this cace, is to make those vizored seruaunts (whom you note of) more & more carelesse, and out of mistrust: your highnesse (by your fauour) muste not thinke amisse of me for that I haue often warned you, and nowe againe doo put you in mind, to dally with them for the present tyme, and to feed them so far foorth, as to hold talke with them ofttymes your selfe, or to cause them to be talkt with by persons appoynted for the nonce, which must feed thē with ye great opinion and good liking that the kings maiestie hath of their doyngs, and with the good wyll which he beareth them, yea euen so farre forth as to assure them that he beleueth, & sayth, that they haue done hym so notable seruis, as he thinketh him selfe beholden to them for that his low Countreys are styll vnder his obedience, & that but for their presence and wisdome they had eyther bin a pray to straungers, or els bin bathed in the blud of their own people. For although

madame, such speches be but 
                     〈◊〉
                   & fayned iu very deede, yet doo the tyme and occasion require, that such artificial talke should be vsed for the seruis of his maiestie. And I beleue your highnesse shall see by experience, that they wyll serue to good purpoze for the holdyng of them in, or at leastwise for to hold the fast, as we haue perceyued alreadye, not onely in them, but also in the two that are gone to his maiestie, who haue bin so cunnyngly and skilfully handled, and haue had so good countenance and intertaynment giuen them, that they swear
                     •…
                   by nothyng els but by the faith that they owe to their maister.
               And on the otherside, there is so good order taken, and such fetches practized in their houses at home, that accordyng to the meanes that your highnesse coū
                  seleth, they can nother doe nor say any thyng, wherof good intelligence is not giuen backe agayne. Besides this, it is determined to holde them a good while at the Court, and not to suffer them to depart thence, no more than they haue suffered the Lord of Ibermount, who thought he should haue retunred out of hand. But I must tell you Madame, that the greatest inconuenience whiche I know to be in this cace at this preset,

is that they which are of greatest power and credit about the kyng, (that is to witte the Duke and the This Duke is the Duke of Alua: and the Prince is the prince Deboly Ruygomes. Prince) agree well vpon the punishment, but not vpō the meane how to punish them. For the one vrgeth the kinges goyng thither as much as he can, & the other on the contrary part letteth & hindereth it, & propoūdeth other new meanes. As for me, I haue alwayes bin of opiniō, yt in such caces the kynges presence would stand in great stead: & that aboue all thynges, diligence and speedy dispatch is needefull, and would greatly aduauntage the matter, and that in suddein diseazes it behoueth to vse speedy, yea & euē violēt remedies: which is the opinion, wherein the kynges Maiestie as I am informed (onely by one litle soule) doth now dwell fully settled and resolued: in so much that the same day that he arriued last at Madrid after his sicknesse, hee sware in the presence of the sayd Lords, how he knew well that in the thynges whiche he had to do in his low Countreys, his going should be, not onely to his own reputation, but also to the seruis of God: and therfore that it touched him so neere, as he would rather hazard all the rest of his dominions, than fayle to punish such Rebelliō to the example

And for the same cause his Maiestie determined resolutely in the same place, to depart out of Spayne as soone as he possibly might, and to cary with him the Prince his sonne, & the Queene, (who notwithstandyng (as it was thought) might haue passed thorough Fraunce,) leauyng his suster the Regēt of the coū

Which there is no dout but he shal obteine, notwithstanding that he cannot as yit giue him reso

Furthermore madame, me thinkes I shoulde not forget to tel you, howe the Countie Palatine, and the Lantgraue of Hessia, and the other Lutheran Princes haue sent two ambassadours hyther, which beare the name of Doctors, wherof the one is called Iunius, and the other Dauid. They came hyther a moneth or fiue weekes ago, vnder colour to demaund certaine money, which the sayd Princes had lent the Hugonots, duryng the troubles of the Realme, and therewithall to commend the professors of their godly Religion to the French kyng: but in very deede (as farre as I can learne) to make practises with the sayd Hugonots, and to giue new occasions of attemptes against the Catholik state of the kynges maiesties Countrey. And for as muche

as I perceyued by good ground, and in very truth, that some of the kyngs and Queenes Coūsell, yea euen of the greatest and oldest sort, (how Catholicke so euer they pretended to be) were mynded to serue their owne turnes by occasiō of this Ambassade, by entryng into league with those Princes, and so to strengthen themselues in their confederacie and alyance, I was in some vnquietnesse for certaine dayes, how to fynde meanes to breake that broode. But the Cardinall came to the Towne in very good season, who in very deede doth a whole worlde of good turnes heer, and would do many 
                     •…
                  o if he were able. I visited him & had long discourse with him about the weightynes of this cace, and the greate inconueniences that it drewe with it to the ruine of the Catholickes of this Realme: and I aggrauated it in such wise vnto him, as I made it seeme to tend, not onely to the harme of the kyng my maister, but also to the harme of his owne Prince. By meanes wherof I gaue him a colour to attach the said Iunius as a subiect borne in the low countrey, so as he wēt hence the nexte mornyng to a house of the Queenes called Monceaulx, where the Court lay. And when he came there, he

sped him so well, that immediatly the kyng & the Queene dispatched a writ to ye Marshal of their house, to put the said Lutherā Ambassadours in prison who were as then in the towne, and to seaze their letters, remēbraunces, & Instructions. Which thyng had bin put in execution, but that duryng the contention that happened while the Marshal was about to haue led them to prison, a certeine Counseler beyng thē in the town, aduized him to surceasse the execution of the writ, vntill there came a new commaundement. Neuerthelesse, I know that although there was meanes made afterward to salue that sore: yet y• Ambassadours thought themselues to haue receiued such a despight, & their Maisters such an iniurie: as I am sure that thereby the practise that was a brewyng is so broken of, as it cannot be knit togither agayne. Specially for asmuch as they perceiued themselues to be misused new agayne, in that in sted of amendes for the sayd wrong, they were very ill intreated at the Court, when they came to haue audiēce: & afterward mocked for their labour, by meanes wherof they thought that the kyng and the Queene and their Coūsell had small likyng of them: a thyng that cannot but

turne to the great furtheraunce of the kynges Maiesties affaires, and bereue them more and more of their frēdes and alyances. As for the Lady that you wot of, I take hir to be one of the deepest dissemblers in the world: & the more I haue to deale with hir, the more am I cōfirmed in yt opiniō which I haue oftē aduertized your highnesse of: namely, that there is no trust, no assurednes, no frendshyp, no stedfastnesse in hir, I haue talked with hir many times of the matter that you know of, which concerneth the kynges Maiestie, and I haue told hir meetly playnly inough how greatly she is bounde thereto, for the releef that she hath receiued by it in hir great nede, and I do dayly still vse all the meanes that I can deuize, to make hir to discouer matters accordyng to his maiesties meenyng and yours. But I can get nothyng at hir hād but wordes: and I am as neere my purpoze as I was at the first day neuerthelesse I am fully determined to vrge hir in such wise at my next cominyng to haue audience, as she shalbe driuen to lay hir selfe open. She sendes me oft the litle blacke mā that I haue written of so oftentyines to your hyghnesse, who hath bin diuers tymes in Spayne since the Lorde of S. Suppli

I will nother let hir know what I intend, nor draw them frō their opinion, but contrariwise pretend to speake freely to thē. And by this meanes I perceiue I giue them now & then good glikes & to very good effect, and that I sucke more out of them than they do out of me. At leastwise I wil by Gods helpe take such order henceforth, as they shall neuer make their bragges that they haue couzined a Spanyard. I receiued this aduertizement by a poste that went from Madrid with the Lord of S. Supplice, whom the sayd Lady did send now alate to the kynges Maiestie, and left him as Bayone the first of this Moneth to returne into Fraunce. One sent me word that he had had such talke with hir as was behoful, & such as I gaue instructiōs of, which I am sure will do good: neuerthelesse he learned not so much newes as he looked for, and as their intent was that sent hym.

               ¶ The Princes answere to the Attourneyes Summons or Citation.
               MAister Attourney, I haue receiued a Copie of the SummonsNo. 7. that you haue caused to be executed and published agaynst me by open Proclamation and Edict. And for asmuch as I finde my selfe greatly greeued with the accusations therin cō
                  teined, as a nobleman of my callyng ought to do: I couet nothyng so much (which thyng I hope also to make apparant) as to aunswere dewly and truly therunto as becommeth me. For it is no part of my meening, to leaue any suspicion in the hartes of the ignoraunt, that I haue not dealt honorably and accordyngly as I am bounde to the king, or that I haue leudly and vndew
                  
                     •…
                  ully behaued my selfe in the Commissions,

roomes, and offices, which it hath pleazed his Maiestie to bestow vpon me heertofore, or otherwise. But I hope to shew by this discourse & by the laying togither of my defences, that the good, long continewed, & faythfull seruices, charges, and damages, which I haue susteyned in them by reason of thē, doo farre surmount my dueties and rewardes. And therefore I haue good cause and reason to desire to enter into this reckenyng, no lesse than he that hopeth and looketh for an amendement of his state, by the closing vp and determinyng of his account. But for as much as the thing that we most desire & chiefeliest intend, is cōmōly last in execution, if we proceede duely and orderly as we should do: in so much that the Phisition or Surgeon goes not about to cure the diseaze, or to heale the wounde, how greeuous or daungerous soeuer it be, tyll he haue first purged the humors, and searched the bottome thereof: neyther dooth the Mason builde a house, without laying of a sure foundation before: I am inforced and compelled by the maner of your Summons, to defer the alledging and settyng downe of my defence, vntyll your accusations be layd forth before a competent and fit Iudge,

in place vnsuspected, where a man may hope that the things which shalbe spoken, shalbe regarded as they ought to be, and that the Iudge wyl proceede indifferently to acquitment or condemnation, according as the cace shall require and deserue. In the meane while I must comfort my self with the examples (wherof storyes are full) of suche as in recompence of their mainteynyng and increasing of the honour, Countreys, and dominions of their Princes, kings and soueraigne Lords, with the hazard of their owne lyues, and the expence of their goodes, haue not only bin shamefully cited and cryed out vpon, but also receyued bodyly punishment, and bin made a publike example, by being murthered, executed, banished, or driuen away, whereas in the meane while, the rewardes and recompences of their seruices haue bin giuen before their faces to them that least deserued them. Which dealing is so much the lesse straunge in these dayes, for as much as the innocentest person that is, maye not ouely be brought in suspition, but also in hatred, & made abhorred of the world, onely by causing him to be taken and reputed for an heretike by some suborned person. For be he once brought to that poynt.

he shall not onely fynd hym selfe defeated of all his good doynges, seruices, and desertes: but also beyng bereft and depriued of all good likyng, he shall become suspected and accusable of Rebellion, Commotion, Sedition, and generally of all kindes of crimes and faults that can be comprized vnder the name of treason.
               And for as muche as it is an odious thing, as ye worlde goes now adayes, to accuse mē of pretēsed heresie, to the intēt they may punish it without incurryng the indignation and turnyng away of mens hartes, which they woulde faine holde in bondage: it standeth them in hand to couer it with the cloke of treazon, wherof who soeuer is accused, shall in vaine goe about to purge and cleare hym self, before one to whom he perceyueth hym selfe to be suspected of heresie. For in as much as treazon is not the finall cause, for which he is pursued, arrested, apprehended, and accuzed: though he make his innocencie appeare by neuer so due proofe: yet can he not hope for any acquitment or deliuerance, but must be condemned vnder title and pretence of treazon: or els (be his innocencie too too apparant) he must looke for

                  SIr, for asmuch as my doyngsNo. 7. may be a sufficient testimonie, that frō my youth vp I haue desired nothyng more, than to imploy my selfe in the seruis, first of the late Emperour of noble memory, and afterward of the kyng my Maister: I haue hoped that his maiestie (beyng aduertized from me, (lyke as my Lady of Parma then Regent, was also) that I was come into this my county of Nassaw for certeine very vrgent affaires of myne) would in respect of my faythfulnes, & good wil, not haue ceased to haue shewed me so much fauour, as to commaūde me wherin soeuer I could haue done him seruis, which I offered hym continewally by my sayd letters of aduertizemēt or at leastwise that I should haue vnderstode at your hand, that the kynges Maiestie was mynded to haue me to leaue myne owne affaires heere, and to returne immediatly thither, as wel as you gaue intelligence of his maiesties minde to all other Lords, states, and Cities. But as I was stil wayting with great longyng, for his Maiesties

commaundementes: I was aduertized that processe was gone out agaynst me, to seaze vpon my Lordshyps, Landes, and goodes: and (whiche woors is) by Proclamatiō vnder the name of the Attourney generall, ful of false and vntollerable slaunders: and afterward by the apprehendyng of my sonne, whom I had left at Louane that he might be the better able to serue the kyng and the cō
                  mon weale heerafter. Whereat I wondered very much, & me thought it was right strange, that they should proceede in such sort against a man of my calling, forgettyng so soone the great and noble seruices, done as well by my predecessours and by my selfe, and in theis last trubbles by name. Wherfore where as I haue reasons & allegations well framed to Iustifie my cace with all, and to cleere & declare myne innocencie, & the wrong that is done me in this behalfe, which I reserue till fit time & place may serue: I thought it inough at this tyme to answere the Attourney general with speede, and to lay open and to shewe to him the insuffi

And to the ende that this may not serue to any other effect, I pray God Syr, to giue vnto you health and whatsoeuer is for your saluation, and vnto me, that my Prince may once truly vnderstand the sinceritie of my dealynges.

                  MAdame, the aduertizemēt which your highnes hath giuen me of the affaires where you are, hath confirmed the opinion which I haue alwayes had: namely that this styrre was neuer made without the knowledge and supportāce of the greatest, and specially of the three He meeneth the Prince of Orendge, the Countie of Egmond, and the Countie of Horn. whiche make so fayre countenance. For as your highnesse hath considered with greate care and discretion: you must also beleue that all the mischief spryngeth of them three. I haue not fayled to aduertize the kings Maiestie of all thynges, and specially of that matter. And I am sure that whereas your highnesse hath informed his Maiestie of them, you shall not neede to handle them as they should be, and accordyng to your owne information: for they may be well assured, that they shalbe the first whom his Maiestie will deale with: not to shewe them fauour, for they be not worthy of it: but to punish and correct them as their rebellion deserueth. Therfore your hyghnes shall not neede to giue them any euill countenance, or to make any shewe of misliking, for feare of marring the matter: But you must hold them stil in hope that the kynges Maiestie taketh them for his faythfull seruauntes: & that will

stand vs in great stead. For, by causing them to beleeue so, you shall ouertake them the eassyer. But when the time cō
                  meth, you shal talke to them in an other maner of language. And your highnesse must assure your selfe, that if your will be good to make them receiue the payment that they haue deserued: his Maiestie wilbe no lesse willyng to do what soeuer is needefull in that behalfe.
               Also Madame, to aduertize you in what assuraunce we bee of succour in Fraunce, accordyng to the instructions that you gaue me: I must bee fayne to tell your hyghnesse, that we haue promises inough made vs, but I feare me they will stand vs in no great stead, and in the end all will turne to bare words, bycause they haue not their own willes, nor are able to helpe vs as they promise, by reason that the Hugonotes heerawayes are strong and doo make head. I will not fayle to do what may be done, and to aduertize your highnesse thereof vpon all occasions. But in any wise I beseech you to behaue your selfe very cunnyngly towards the three persons whom I haue named vnto you. And so &c.

                  MAdame, I haue receyued the letters These are the letters with the kings resolu tion sent abrod by the Regent, the 18. of Decemb. 1565. No. 2. fo. 77. which it hath pleased your highnesse to write vnto me, together with the Counselles letters, concernyng my gouernment: whereby I vnderstand the kinges maiesties intent, consistyng in three poynts, which he commaundeth me very expressely to cause to be executed in all places of my gouernmente. Nowe although Madame, that myne aduice is not asked in the matter beyng of so greate weight and importance: yet notwithstandyng as a faythfull seruaunt and subiect to his maiestie, being moued with a zelous desire to satisfie the duetie of my calling and othe, I coulde not forbeare to say myne opinion freely and frankly, choozing rather to aduenture the gainyng of displeazure at the present for myne aduertisementes and informations, than to be noted and blamed hereafter as an vnfaithful, negligent, and carelesse Gouernour, for my wi

                  king and silence, to the defamation and desolation of the Countrey.
               Firste, as touching the puttyng of theThe Councel of Trent Councel in execution, although there wer some mislikyng and grudging at it at the

beginnyng: yet notwithstandyng, in as much as some qualifications haue bin added to it afterward, I be
                     •…
                  eue there wyll be litle sticking in that behalfe. And as for the reformation of the Clergie, and other Ecclesiastical ordinances: seyng they belong not to my vocation, I referre them to such as haue the charge of them, intendyng to satisfie the kynges maiesties commaundement, as neede shall require.
               As touchyng the second poynt, whichThe Inquisition. conteyneth that the Gouerners, Counsellers, and other Officers should fauour the Iuquisitours to the vttermost of their power, and maynteyne them in the authoritie that belongeth to them by the lawe of God and man, & which they haue inioyed vnto this day.
               It may please your highnesse to remember, that the complaintes, strifes, and quarrels that haue byn moued through the whole Countrey here for the stablishyng of Bishops, haue risen vppon nothyng els, but for feare least some forme of Inquisition shoulde be brought in vnder that pretence. So odious and yrksome is, not on
                  
                     •…
                  ye the execution, but also the very name of it.
               Besides this, it may please your highnes to vnderstand, (for it is cleare and manifestly knowen to the most part of the kings

maiesties subiectes, and specially to al men of any good countenance & calling hereawayes) that both the Emperours maiestyMary Queene of Hungary. and also Queene Mary, haue oftentimes assured the inhabitantes, as well by word as by writyng, that the Inquisitiō should not be brought into the lowe Countreys: but that they should be mainteyned and ruled as they had bin of all ancient tyme before. Yea and euen the kings maiestie that now is, to the intent to put that imaginatiō out of the peoples heades, hath ofttymes made the like assurance hym selfe.
               And vndoubtedly Madame, the sayd assurances and promises haue kept his maiesties subiectes and other dwellers here from fallyng into any alteration, and caused many men of good wealth and countenance to forbeare the alienating of their goodes, and the seekyng of any other places where they might liue without feare of any Inquisition. And so consequently they haue bin a meane to mainteine the vnion, tranquilitie, trade of Marchandise, and supply of the most part of the treasures for the maintenance of the warres: wheras els the Countrey being made bare both of inhabitantes, men, and money, had bin abandoned as a pray to whosoeuer had listed to lay hold of it.
               As touching the third poynt, whereby

his maiesty wylleth and commaundeth expressely,The Iniunctions, Proclamations, Decrees, or Edictes. that the Iniunctions or Edictes made as well by the Emperour, as by hym selfe, shoulde in all poyntes and articles be kept, folowed, and executed, with al rigor, and without any qualification or winkyng at them.
               Madame, (to my seemyng) that likwise is a very hard poynt, because the Iniunctions are many and dyuers, and haue byn limited, qualified, and restrayned nowe and then heretofore, and not pursued with rigor: in so muche that they were not so sharpe euen in the tyme of the vniuersall misery, as they be now, nother were our people so much inclyned to innouation, as they be now by the instigation and practizes of our neighbors.
               Wherfore, to vse more extremity presently, and all at one instant to renue the Inquisition more vehemently, and to proceede on to execution wyth all seueritie: surely Madame, I can not see howe the kynges maiestie shall wyn aught els by it, than to put hym selfe to payne, and the Countrey to trouble, with the losse of his good subiectes hartes, by makyng euery man mistrust, that his maiesty intendeth to goe an other way to woorke than he hath alwayes assured them of and pretended, and to hazarde the puttyng of all thynges

into hys neyghbors handes, as wel by vnpeoplyng of the Countr
                     •…
                  y by such as wyll forsake it, as by reason of the small truste that can be repozed in them that shall remayne, & al without any profit or redresse of Religion.
               To auoyde tediousnesse, I omyt the alledgyng of many inconueniences in this behalfe, because I know that both his maiestie and your highnesse haue bin aduertized of them at large already. Moreouer, (I speake it vnder correction) me thynkes the tyme is very vnfit to styrre the braynes and humors of the people, whiche is too muche disquieted and troubled alreadye with the present scarsitie and dearth of corne. It were muche better (in myne opinion) to deferre and let all alone, vntyll his maiesties commyng, who is sayd to be in preparyng hym selfe hytherwarde. And I woulde to God he were so steaded, as he myght be here with speede, to the intent that by his presence suche order might be taken, as shoulde be expedient for the seruice of God and his maiestie, and for the reste and quietnesse of his Countreys and subiectes here. For in caces of trouble, thynges would be remedyed more readyly by his presence than otherwyse.
               Howbeit, if hys maiesty and your highnesse be styll at one staye, and fully bent to

haue all the sayde poyntes folowed to the ful: for as muche as I see clearely and before myne eyes, that it cā not be now executed without great hazarde of the ruine of the whole Countrey, (which it may be that his maiesty would haue regarde of, yf he were here:) If it be so that your hyghnesse wyll not deferre the Inquisition tyll then, but wyll needes persist in the present executyng thereof: I had leuer that his maiestye shoulde put some other in my place, that can better skyll of the peoples humors, and is better able than I to keepe them in peace and quietnesse: than to incurre the shame that maye lyght vpon me and myne, if any inconuenience should fal vpon the Countrey, vnder my gouernmēt, and duryng my charge.
               And his maiestye and your hyghnesse may well assure your selues, that I saye not this because I am loth to folowe his commaundementes, or desirous to lyue otherwyse than as a good Christian: for my former doynges can wel beare witnesse therof, and I hope his maiestye hath well perceyued by experience, that I haue neuer spared eyther body or goodes to doo hym seruice, wherein my desire is to continue styll all my lyfe long. Besides this, if the affayres of the Countrey shoulde goe otherwyse than well, I woulde (for my duetyes

sake to his maiesty and my natiue soyle) I woulde (I say) aduenture not onely al the goodes that I haue in the worlde, but also myne owne person, my wife, and my children, whom euen nature wylleth me to preserue and keepe. Wherefore I beseech you, let it please your highnesse to haue regard of it according to your tryed and accustomed discretion, and to take this mine information in good parte, as proceedyng from one that speaketh of earnest affection and good wyll, to doo his maiestie seruis, and to preuent all inconueniences▪ wherof I take God to witnesse, whom (hauing commended my selfe most humbly to the good grace of your highnesse) I beseeche to giue you long and good lyfe in health.

Which thyng caused me to thinke it meete and expedient, to assemble the Gouerners, (as I haue done) to be heere vpon Monday or Tewsday next at the furthest, that by their helpe I may consult of such things as shalbe most expedient for the preuentyng of the sayd inconueniences, or for the good seruice of the king, for the peace and tranquillitie of his countreys, and for the safety of his vassals, subiectes and inhabitants. And I know your affection and zeale towardes his Maiesties affayres and in the behalfe of the Countrey to be such, as I assure my selfe that you will not fayle (all other matters set aside and omitted) to be here at the same tyme: which I pray you hartily good Cousin to do, for to that ende doth this letter purposely come vnto you.

               And we will and declare, that from the day wherin the said heretickes shalbe

               HIr highnes caused the gētlemē thatNo. 4. had put vp the supplicatiō vnto hir, to returne to the xx. of August to receiue aunswere to their demaundes duryng which time it fell out so wel, that she receiued letters from the kynges maiestie whereby she was the better inabled to giue them certeine & absolute answere.
               And first of all she declareth, that his

maiestie hauing regard of y• thyngs that hir highnesse hath shewed vnto him, is contēted vpon the aduice of his lords, y• knights of the Order, & others as wel of his Counsels of estate, as of his priuy Counsell, that the Inquisition whereof they complayne, shall ceasse.
               Secondly his maiestie cōsenteth that a new Edict should be made, but he was not resolued whether it should be done by meane of the states in general, or no. Neuerthelesse hir highnesse hoped, that she should shortly haue his full resolutiō therein, accordyng as his maiestie had writtē to her. And she would willingly doo hir indeuer stil at al tymes, that his maiestie might vout

                  afe to cōdescend to y• thynges aforesayd, as he had done by his letters agayne.
               And as touchyng the assurance wherof they made mention in their last sute: her highnes was determined to giue it them, so farre forth as lay in her: And as nowe shee was able to put thē out of all doubt, for as much as his maiestie had consented hereunto, & giuen her authoritie cōcernyng the maner & forme of it, as shee should fynd it cōuenient. Wherfore shee said & declared vnto them, that his maiestye abhorryng nothyng more than rigor, & beyng desirous by his accustomed clemēcie to put them all out of

suspition, whiche might thynke that he was misinformed of thē, & to discharge thē of ye mistrust which had caused those troubles, was contented that her hyghnesse should for the pacifying of al incō

               And nowe, for as much as they haue ful & whole satisfactiō made vnto them: her highnesse wyl not refuze ye offer that they had made diuers times, cōcerning their imploying of thē selues in the seruis of his maiesty & of her highnesse, for the benefit, rest, & tranquilitie of ye countrey, wherto the duetie of faithfulnesse & of nature bindeth thē. According wherunto shee intendeth that they shall giue her their faith, first that they shal nother do nor procure directly nor indirectly, any thyng agaynst his maiesty, his states countreys, & subiects, but that they shal imploy thē selues wholy to al maner of thyngs that good & loyal vassals & subiectes

ought to performe towards their soueraigne Lord & natural prince.
               In doyng wherof they shal to the vttermost of their power, saythfully helpe to stay the present troubles, cōmotions, & vprores, and to restraine the insurrection of the people: that the sacking, pilling, & pulling down of churches, chappels, cloysters, & religious houses may cease in al places: yea & they shall helpe to punish such as haue cōmitted such sacriledges, outrages, & abominations: & see that no wrong be done to any ecclesiasticall persons, ministe

               Itē, they shal earnestly indeuor, that y• weapōs which y• people haue takē in hād (where through so many mischefes haue bin cōmitted, and may be cōmitted hereafter) may be layd away incōtinētly. Also they shal do the best they can by al good seruis, to prohibit preachyng in places where none hath bin afore: and to prohibit al force, & cause of offence, & publike disorder where preaching is vsed already Moreouer, they shal indenor and put to their helpe, accordyng as they are bound by oth & fealty towards his maiesty, to the expulsing and repressyng of al strangers that are enemyes & rebels to his maiestie & the Countrey.
               
                  Finally they shal do their indeuor, according to the credit which they haue among such as are now rizen vp for religion or otherwise, to cause them to submyt them selues to the thyngs that hys maiesty shal decre by the general aduice of his estates, for the furtherance of religion, & the quietnes and tranquilitie of the same.
