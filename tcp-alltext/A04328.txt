            COLLECTED CHIEFLY OVT OF diuerse works of his in written hand, by Gods especiall providence remaining in the Publike Library at Oxford, of the Honorable foundation of Sr. THOMAS BODLEY Knight:

            TO THE HONORABLE Sr EDWARD COOKE, Knight, Lord Chiefe Iustice of his Maiesties Court of Common Pleas.
            
               My very good Lord; it is not lōg since, It was my happe, to see a Booke published; quo iure, quáue potius miuria, against your Lordships Fift booke of Reportes: Intituled de Iure Regis Ecclesiastico by one, that if he had not tearmed himselfe a Catholik Deuine, I should haue takē him for any thing els: So far is he in this lying Libel frō being a Deuine, much lesse Catholik (vnlesse it 
                  ••
               e in the sence vniuersal) being indeed nothing els but an vniuersal Historiā. I haue also read an other book wherin your Lordship is most vniustly produced, or rather traduced for an egregious falsarie, a crime which that Libeller hath made common to others of your ranck, and of higher mark, by imputing the same most scandalously vnto one of the most Honorable and religious Peeres of this land. Farthermore I haue hard of diuerse others, whose fingers doe itch, to be dealing with your Lordship, according to the grounds of your Honorable profession. By al which I perceaue, that

your Lordship hath so mortally wounded the hayrie scalp of that man of Rome, which would faine bee accepted for head of this Church, that our aduersaries doe striue with noe smale adoe, whoe shalbe most forwarde, to salue this sore, though it be neuer so incurable. But amongst all others, who so aduenturous, as our pretended Catholike, surnaming himselfe the Deuine, which hath spared no cost, no labour, for the effecting thereof in his late aunswere. Seely disputer, that where the question is de Iure, produceth testimonies de facto, and being by profession a Deuine, & the questiō of law bringeth his proofs out of Hisstorie. Doubtles the Deuine is much beholding vnto your Lordship (though hee doe craftily dissemble it) for giuing him so good an occasiō both to shew his great reading, and withal to purg so much choller, being of liklyhood of that cholericke & bilious disposition.
            Quod si non aliquà nocuisset, mortuus esset.

                writings; but the contrary is too too manifest in his lyeing Pamphlets. To saie nothing of his slaunderous reports against the late religious Queene of blessed memorie: against the reuerend Sages and Iudges of the Common law in general, and your Lordship in particular; because he takes vpon him to be so great a Clearke in the question about the Kings Crowne and dignitie, I haue endeauoured in this Apologie (which I haue framed in defence of that famous writer and preacher of Gods word Iohn VVickliff) to oppose against his slaunderous Libel, his answere; as the answere of a most anciēt, Catholike, and learned Deuine. Ancient, for hee liued in the time of K Edward the 3. Catholike, for he maintained the same doctrine then, which the Church of Eng1 and now (being guided by the Holy Ghost and sacred writings of Scripture & Fathers) doth professe; learned in al kind of good knowledge, needfull for a Divine: & for the maine question touching the kings Regaltie

& the Popes Supremacie, hee delivereth in other termes the very same argumēts & reasons, which I finde written in that your said fift Booke of Reports: proving the truth of your assertiōs, by the Iawes Civill, Canon, & Common. Wherein because I professe little knowledge (it being not my element; and as your Lordship hath well obserued, Perito in sua arte credendumest,) I haue presumed to submit the whole Apologie vnto your iudicious & learned censure, quatenus de Iure. If your Lordship finde him not in this Apologie (where I haue, as neare as I could, truly related his words) most iudicious, religious, temperate, learned, & altogether conformable vnto the doctrine and discipline of this presēt Church (which this libeller so much impugneth) and agreeing with the laws of God and of this Realme, let me beare the fault of presumption, and vndergoe your heauiest Censure whom I professe, I doe honour and reuerence, as farr as anie of my profession, and as it becometh me to doe in al Christian dutie; knowing your Lordship to be a zealous professor of the truth, a worthy maintainer of the Cleargie, a louing Patron of both our Vniuersities, and lastly a great furtherer of al good learning: which that

you may liue for to doe, maugre the opposition of our aduersaries, I shal neuer cease to pray vnto the Almighty, long to continue your Lordship in health, wealth and prosperitie, with encrease of spiritual gifts, for the benefit of both Church and Common wealth. From the Library in Oxford Feb. 10. 1608.

            THE PREFACE VNTO ALL TRVE Catholicks, and Christian Readers.
            
               WHeras among al the writers, which haue since the daies of Antichrist sharpened there pens in defence of the Gospel, and maintained the cause of Christ against Antichrist and his Supposts, by opposing themselues as Arch-pillers, against the Arch-hereticks and Caterpillers of there times: there is none that hath behaued himselfe more religiously, valiantlie, learnedlie, and constantlie, then this stout Champion, reverend Doctor, & worthie preacher of Gods word Iohn VVickliffe, whose veryVetus Hypocrita, Angeius Sathanae, Antichristi prae ā

Verl. 7. heresies in Religion, all of sondry errours and grosse absurdities: knowing therefore, that howsoeuer iure soli the Court of Rome maie, yet iure poli Gods law doth not condemne any man before his cause be heard, I haue thought it most conuenient and sit, to bring him forth before you Christian Readers, as before so many * Festusses & Agrippaes to the end that you maie know the truth of those things wherof he is accused. And albeit our Romanists, haue as euilly intreated him as euer the Jewes did * Paul, laying many and grievous complaints

against him: yet I doubt not, but you when you shall (as it becommeth men of profoūd iudgment & good discretion) permitte him to answere for him selfe as Act. 26. 1. Act. 25. 7.

               This mā hath done nothing worthy of death, nor of bondes.
            
            The order and method which I wil, God willing, obserue, shalbee: first to shew his conformitie, with the now Church of England in the chiefest points cōtroversed, thence to descend vnto questiōs not altogether so material, and last of al to answere al such obiections, as haue beene mooued by our late Popish writers.

The proofes which I shal alleadge shalbe cleere, euident, apparent, authentical, for they shalbe produced out of his own words and works, as they are extant in sundry good Manuscripts, in our so renowned publike Librarie, as thēselues may see or cause to bee seene by others: for therefore to iustifie my proceedings against them, (knowing there sundrie & malignant See the Treatise tending to mitigation writtē by P.

wordes of the Auctor, either in As the Author himselfe wrot them. Latin or in English noting both Bookes and Pages.

            AN APOLOGIE FOR IOHN VVickliffe, shewing his conformity with the now church of England both in Doctrine & Discipline.
            
               TO proceed thē according vnto the first part of our general diuisiō, J doubt not, but it wil easily be acknowledged of al hands, that the greatest Controuersies betweene the Papists and vs, maie be reduced into these fewe heads.
            They concerne.
            
               1 The Scripture.
               
               2 Traditions.
               
               3 The Pope.
               
               4 The Church.
               
               5 Iustification.
               
               6 Merits.
               
               7 The blessed Sacrament of the Lords supper.
               
            
            For the rest which concerne the other Sacraments, or other pointes of doctrine, that are collateral, they shalbe handled with the principal questions; or else in the second place apart by themselues, according to our former diuision.
            
               
               The I. Chap. Of the Scripture.
               THe questions to be moued about the Scripture are no lesse infinite, then the Scripture it selfe: but the greatest points controuersed betweene vs and the Papists, resteth in these 4. About the number, Sufficiencie, Interpretation, or Communication of the Scripture, or bookes Canonical.

               THis controuersie about the Supremacie, or Primacie of the Pope, being the verie soule and life of Poperie, may be resolued into sundrie questions. 1. It maie be questioned, whether the Pope bee supreme Iudge here vpon earth, in al causes, & ouer al persons. 2. Admit he were so, whether he may intermedle with the Temporal affaires of Kings and Princes. Thirdly supposing that also, whether he be of that temper and making, that he cannot erre in his finall Conclusions. Fourthly and lastly, whether he be Antichrist or no.

                     that all the sayings of Purgatorie, were spokē, by way of commination, as it were so many religious lies to scarre the people from comming thither. Secondly, he diuides the Church into 3. parts: The

For there is little rest, and lesse sleeping there, if we beleeue them that haue come from thence, and told vs so. And by this reason, if the fier of Purgatorie be cleane put out, the smoke of it, that is praiers for the

dead, must needs, in a verie short time vanish awaie. And as for praiers vnto Saints, most true it is, that in these Popular works of his, he mentioneth a praier, of Diuers. Trac pag 207.

That which follows out of Stow the old, that he adioined himselfe to the Begging Fryars, is taken out of Walsinghā which was Stowes Auctour, and VVickliffes too great enemie to be beleeued. Master Stow, not to defraud him of his iust praise, was a paineful Citizen, by trade a Taylour, by his industrie a Chronicler, so well minded to the publike good, that for fault of better writers, he tooke vpō him at the first to record such things as happened in that Metropolis and chiefe Cittie, and being somewhat encouraged in his labour, hee tooke vpon him to deduce the Historie of the whole Island, from the first beginning, and to contract al our stories into one smal volume. But here his learning failed him: for being not able M. Io. Stow a paineful writer, but not so iudicious, for want of the knowledge of the Latine tong, wherof he was vtterly ignorant as himselfe ingenuously professed vntome and therfore was compeled to haue his latine bookes translated for him, to his exceeding great cost and charges the greater was his cōmendations to vnderstand his Auctors, how should he iudge them? And not iudging them, how could he write or cite anie thing out of them, iudicioussie, pertinentlie, and as became an Historian? I spare to speake, what I know, concerning his books; his reuerend old age, and incredible zeale to the common good, shalbe to me insteed of so many garments, to couer his historicall imperfections.

He telleth vs, that Gods promises and threatnings are Deus nemini promittit poenam vel premium, nisi sub conditione tacita, vel expressa De Ver Scrip. p. 383. conditionall, & that as God hath appointed the end, so he hath appointed the meanes of our Saluation but notwithstanding this necessitie, these are his very words,In Expos.

            THis Iohn Wickliffe was borne in the North, where vnto this day, some of his name and family (as I vnderstand by others) doe yet remaine: brought vp in Oxford in that Merton Coll. Colledge which hath iustly had the preheminence aboue all the Colledges, & most of the Vniversities in Christendome, for the nomber, and excellency of men learned in all faculties, qualified with extraordinary gifts, both for Church and Common-wealth: such as were, (to omit other Faculties) in Divinitie, Bacon, Burley, Scotus, Occham, Peccham, Bradwardine, with diuerse others

                and by example of these, aswel as by the strict Discipline of that House, this Io. Wickliffe, nothing inferiour vnto any of the former, either in quicknes of apprehension, sharpnes of wit, shortnes of deliuery, greatnes of industrie, stoutnes of courage, and variety of all kinde of good learning; and aboue them all in a full knowledge of the truth of the Gospel, and constant defense of the same, vnto the ende: amidst so many troubles, vexations, accusations, imputations and c

               lumniations so many denunciations, excōmunications, Anathemaes and Curses solemnly pronoūnced against him, at London, and at Oxford, by Archbishops, Bishops, and Popes; so that he was neuer free from their curses, which God (evermore blessed be his name) turned into blessings, as may appeare, by the sequeale of his life and doctrine. He was beloued of all good men for his good life, and greatly admired of his greatest aduersaries, for his learning and knowledge, both in Diuinity & humanity. He writ so many large volumes in both, as it is almost incredible, He seemed to follow, in the whole course of his studies the methode of the Schoole men: and amongst them hee was a

professed follower of Occham; by reading of whose learned bookes, and sundry others which liued about the same time, or not long before; such as were Bradwardine, Marsilius, Guide S. Amore, Abelardus, Armachanus, and that true great Clearke Rob. Grosthead. God gaue him grace, to see the trueth of his Gospel, and by seeing of it, to loth all superstition and Poperie. Of Occham, & Marsilius, he was informed of the Popes intrusions & vsurpations vpon kings, their Crownes & dignities: of Gu. de S. Amore, and Armachanus, hee learned the sundry abuses of Moonkes and Friars, in vpholding this vsurped power: by Abelard and others he was grounded in the right faith of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, by Bradwardine, in the nature of a true sole-iustifying faith, against merit-mongers and Pardoners, Pelagians, and Papists. Finally by reading Grostheads workes, in whō he seemed to be most conversant he descried the Pope to be open Antichrist, by letting the Gospell to be preached, and by placing vnable & vnfit men in the Church of God. He passed thorough al degrees in this famous Vniversity very commendably, writing and speaking many things against the then corrupted doctrine of the Church of Rome. His many Positions were chiefly directed against the Orders of the Begging Friars, which were his professed enemies, and all forraine and v

                  visors, and the Abuses of Begging Friars, which so bridled and restrained the Popes auctority that he could but litle prevaile here in England during the raigne of K. Edw. the 3. & Rich. the 2. In making of these lawes Wickliffe had a great stroke, maintaining verie learnedly and stoutly the Kings Iurisdiction,

Crowne, and dignitie, by the lawes Ciuil Canon and Common. And for this reasō he was by one King sent Embassadour into forraine parts, & by an other consulted here at home. He vrged the Common law most of al other lawes for maintenance of his opinion, wherein hee tooke great delight, and had good directions from time to time from the reuerend Iudges and Sages of the law. He was not so much hated of the Clergie, but hee was as much fauoured by the State Temporal. He was openly defended by King Edward and that noble Duke of Lane aster, and secretly abetted and maintained by King Richard whose Chaplaine he appeared to haue beene, notwithstanding hee shewed him but little countenance outwardly during his minoritie. Twise was he conuēted before the By shops, and thrise summoned to appeare. The first time hee escaped by the Duke, the second time by meanes of a messenger that came from the Queene. The third time he voluntarily abse

Notwithstanding al their deuises and plotts, he liued a longe time without death, bonds, banishment or imprisonment, both writing, teaching, and preaching, opēly in their Schooles & Synagogues, drawing both Prince and people, Schollers & others, and al the world almost after him. He begun to defend his opinions when hee was verie yong, and continued tel he was verie old, constantly retaining and maintaining the same, some few excepted which he reformed; and refined more and more, as he grew in yeares and knowledge. He was Doctor of Diuinitie almost 30. yeares, and for some fewe yeares Parson of Lutterworth in L
