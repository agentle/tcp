Containing a Narration of Kingdomes, from the beginning of the Assyrian Monarchy, vnto the raigne of the Emperour AVGVSTVS. Whereunto is newly added a briefe collection of the liues and manners of all the Emperours succeeding, vnto the Emp. Rodulphus now raigning.
                  First Written in Latine by that famous Historiographer IVSTINE, and now againe newly translated into English, By G. W.
                  LONDON, Printed by William Iaggard, dwelling in Barbican, 1606.
               
               
                  
                  
                  To the Right Worthy, and most accomplished gent. Sir James Haies Knight, endowed with that Honorable quantity of vertue, and true loue to Learning, wherewith euery Noble spirit should studie to be enriched, G. W. wisheth the felicity of his content.
                  
                  
                     RIght worthie Sir, Artaxerxes sir-named Longhand, the fift king of Persia, vsed to haue the Chronicles both of his predecessors, as also the affaires of his own time, read before him euerie night ere hee setlod his eies to any contented rest; aswell to haue knowledge of the dignity of his Auncestors, as to remember in his raigne how he bestowed himselfe. And Alexander the great, had that noble writer of the famous battell of Troy in such prizelesse estimation, that about what affaires soeuer he inclined his actions, he had his workes about him, nor euer slept but they rested vnder his pillow. Moreouer, comming into a School, and not finthe the labors of Homer there, he struck the maister with his fiste, meaning thereby, that the knowledge of Histories, was a recreation fitting all estates and degrees, and that it was a great and capitall offence to be without them. For like as in Musicke, manie discord notes and manie tunes make one consent, and one delightfull harmonie, so in a historie, the varietie and multitude of examples tend all to one end; that is, the aduancement of vertue, and ouerthrow of vice: offring themselues as a most perfect mirror for man to behold, not the outward portraiture and shape of his bodie, but the liuely image and expresse figure of his inward minde, instructing him how to apparell himselfe in decent ornaments, & to discard from him his wilde infirmities.
                  For what can enforce more to Cheualrie, then not barely to

heare of, but as it were presently to behold, the sage and graue consultations of expert Captaines, the speedy and prouident putting in practise of deuised stratagems, the pollicies and sleights in their present execution, the fauourable assistance and successe of the same, with the fame and renown, that continueth (longer then rich Monuments) of valiant enterprises? Or what can be a more readi

so many running streames, so many high and stately mountaines, so many raging and turbulent seas, so manie forrests and vnhabitable deserts, so many kindes of strange Beastes, Fowles, Fishes, Serpents, Herbes, Trees: so dissipate and large Countries, so rich and populous Citties, so wel gouernd Common-wealths, so good Lawes and Customes, so sundrie sortes of people, togither with their natures, dispositions, effects, descriptions, scituations, commodities, pleasures and displeasures, foundations, continuances and decaies, beginnings, proceedings, and endings of the same: & in such an ample Globe, that they shall not seeme to bee reported, but instantly presented.

                  A Preface of Simon Grineus to the Reader, concerning the Profit of reading Histories.
                  
                     WHo is so simple in experience, or so leane in vnderstanding, that knowes not by reading Histories, and treading the plentifull and fruitefull fields of them, he doth therewith make the examples and instructions left in them to grow vp in himselfe, to his aboundant profit. For what can be thought more pleasant or more desired, then sitting as it it were in the Theater and stage of mans life, (the which a History hath most exquisitely furnished in all points) to be made capable of the perils that other men haue sustained, without further daunger to himselfe: to take examples of alsorts, eyther medicynable for his ownesecure estate, or beneficiall to others: to be so ably furnished for the presence of great men, when with grauest aduice they debate of the most weyghtiest affaires, to discusse the end and sequel of their desires, by example, or answer them by argument. The companye of which worthinesse, to the worthiest is welcome, and the cogitations of the Noblest thoughts do couet.
                  Which profit, without History (considering the shortnesse of mans life) cannot be attaind: Who can compasse in memory the times of many hundred years past, behold the beginings, proceedings, & subuersions of great Empires, to witnes the euils they endured, either priuate or publik, and manifestly to discerne the ground and occasion of them. In euery difficult and daungerous matter, to haue one try the perils, and as it were tread the yce before them, neuer to bee destitute of tryed experience, and by times past which properly and peculiarly appertaineth to the duty of a wise man, politickly to foresee what may succeed in all estates, and to iudge of them as yf they were present.
                  Sincc then the ground of such workes are large and spacious to walk and recreat our studies in, it is requisit we prepare our thoughts to the reading of Histories, hauing first a taste of ciuill policy in our selues, which so must gouerne our affections to iudge discreetly of all actions, either pleasinge or displeasing to vs, to be as sufficiently contented with whatsoere we read, & doth resist our inclination, as delighted with that motion keepes fellowship with our nature, and not by the sway of passion bee miserably led, onely with vaine imaginations, and so tosse from one place to another, to read as birds skip from bow to bough, more to prime their bils, then benefit their bodies: but like good Surgions, who search al sores thoroughly to the bottome, ere

they lay Cataplasme on any, & in so viewing ouer Histories, thou shalt eyther by contemplating on the vertue of good men, learne to aspire thy selfe, or by reading the infermities of the bad, blush at the remembraunce of thine own, and be taught to reforme thy condition.
                  But it hapneth as at a royall and sumptuous feast, furnished with all sorts of delicate viands, one thing is placed before one man, some set before another, few satisfie themselues of one restoratiue, but euery man of that helyketh best: and although there is but some one kind of measure which nature hath appointed, and one kind of meat simple and in any wise vncorrupted, that is most for the helth and the nourishment of the body, from the bounds of which whosoeuer exceedeth, and followeth his owne appetite, beyond eyther measure or the ordinance of nature, hee may receiue hurt by that was ordained for his necessary good: euen so in that great variety of Histories, wherin there is set downe a thousand counsels, directed to a thousand purposes, and after what sorte socuer the reader be ledde by fancy or stayed by iudgement, so doth he censure or apply them. Whereby oftentimes that which is ordained for meat, couerts to surfet, & salutaria pharmica, the wholsome medicines prepared for the recreation, infectes the mind, by which abuse it followes not, a decree be made all food to be distasted, nor any benifit despised, since there is for al men leauied a path-way to vertue, in which who so walketh aduisedly, is praise-woorthy, and who transgresseth ofselfeopinion is to be condemned for his error.
                  Some reading Histories deceiue themselues, imagining the bare stile of the history, is of authority inough in it selfe to instruct the reader, wheras indeed it doth no more but minister matter to learne vppon, offering it selfe to all vses, according as the person is affectioned, in like case as doth the feast, for as he that draws an arrow in a bow, may draw it home or short, as his strēgth finds good for him, and as he

                     : 
                        〈◊〉
                     , so in the vse of Histories, the practise is made not according to t
                        •
                     e vse of the words, but the inclination of the will. Some read Histories for no other delight but onely in the reading, who seeking no more but a present delectation, do loose the benefit of the pleasant fruites, such men gaine no more by turning ouer the leaues of a history, then they that play vpon an instrument, taking no further delight therein, then to passe away the tediousnesse of the time present, and shottly after enter into a more tedious conflict with themselues: for it is no pleasure that hath not respect vnto vertue. Others there are whome the glittering glosse of glory pricketh so forward, and to such a mishape transformeth them, that they thinke no aduenture to great for them, nor no prehemmence aboue them, being of no ability, for the performāce of the one, nor of desert to at taine to the other; vtterly forgetting, that those glorious examples whych they read, are not set forth by writers for any other intent, then that such as ensuing vertue, may thereby learne to contemne glory being aboue their reach, or if it accompany them, not to be proud and arrogant of it.
                  And although that none but Fooles will enterprise to aspire to the like glory, without the like virtue, yet notwithstanding it is manifest that some finding no other merit in themselues, but that they haue reade the Noble acts of others, do thinke their desert of highest worth, notsparing of themselues

to speake, Why should not I be either a Scipio or Caesar, like vnto players of Tragedies, who when they haue put off the apparrell, wherein they haue played the part of most Noble personages, do continue to counterset them in countenance and behauiour.
                  There are also men of rude and vulgar vnderstanding who destract from al record, which is not either newes or wonders, like Ideots that giue more to a mans gay and superfluous cote, then vnto the person or his vertuous parts; that extend large offices to the outward show, if it be gawdy, and neglect the labored instruction within, be the worke neuer so worthy.
                  But whereas, it is the principal commendation, apertaineth to a history, to stirre vp the mind of man from sloath fulnesse, and to fence it from all dangers by the strength of examples, (then the which there is nothing of greater power either to perswade or diswade) and that the ancient reseruing of them tendeth to that end and purpose, yet it commeth to passe through the sloathful security of men, and the neglect of their good, being so carefully reserued and offered them, by perswading themselues, that other mens perils helpe nothing to their safty, that such acts as are most worthy of remembrance are either vngratefully rebuked, or else heard with deafe and vnsetled ears. Finally their be, that out of an obstinat presumption, transgresse euen against that same part containeth the most graue and carnest matters, as though histories should be written, not as they were done indeed, but as they ought to be done, with 
                        •
                     iled phrase and fresh inuention, of set purpose onely to' please them. So that partly by meanes of that carelesse security, and partly by the surfet of rash and vnaduised reading, it commeth to passe that (euen as it wer of corrupt humours) a certaine corruptnesse of Iudgment and peruerse opinion is bred.
                  There is also another of no lesse force then these a forsaid, and that is in the writer of histories, who folowing as it wer the tast of their own Palats, as thogh they wer forgers of their worke themselues, fashion their labour rather to intice the reader to spred their commendation, then to let their hand & pen consent to the truth: wherin they do like Cooks, who oftentimes in seasoning their maisters meate rather please their own 
                        •
                     ellish then their Maist, by which, two seuerall Iudgements are misled, the one by rash censure, the other not recording plainely and sincerly.
                  For a Historigrapher, is no other but a reporter of things done, (with whose iudgement if there be any fault) it standeth with him as with a tun of Wine, which (of it selfe being plesant and beautiful) doth either take an euill talent of the Caske, or else is made vnrellishable by being mingled with some other compound, which is either a shameful and intollerable deceit, or a point of extreame folly and ignorance.
                  To those then that ingrosse Histories I perscribe this rule, that they write to record, not to flatter. Of those that read them (since I am of firme opinion such authors are profitable to be read) though for no other but for the great aboundance of examples that they entreate off, I request that they circumspectly and carefully ouerlooke them, considering how great fruites or discommodities are in them propounded: otherwise it happeneth vnto them that imagine a worke may be read ouer lightly, as with those that hold a h

                     The Preface of the most famous Historiographer Justine, vpon the Histories of Trogus Pompeius, dedicated vnto Anthony the Emperor.
                  
                  
                     WHereas many of the Romaines, euen such as had attained to the state of consuls, had put the acts of the Romans in writing, first in Greeke, and after into other forrain languages: Trogus Pompeyus, (a man of auntient eloquence) whether it were for the desire of the like renowne and glory, or for the pleasure that he had in the variety and strangenesse of the worke, compyled as well the Histories of the Greekes, as the Histories also of the whole worlde besides, in the Latine tongue; to the intent that as our Chronicles are reade in Greeke, the Chronicles of the Greekes might be published in our owne tongue: Wherein he enterprised a painfull labour both of body and mind.
                  For first seeing many authors haue taken vppon them to set downe the raigne of some one King, or the actions of some one peculiar kind of people, and thoght themselues to haue vndertaken a weighty businesse; wee may well thinke Pompeyus to haue bin as bold as Hercules, that durst aduenture vpon the whole world. In whose books are conteined the gouernment of all ages, of all Kings, of all Nations & countries: And those things, that the Greek Chroniclers haue disorderly set downe, as euery man thought most conuenient to please himselfe, the same hath Pompeyus compiled into one maine history, omitting nothinge, saue onely those thinges altogither vnprofitable to be spoken of. Therefore of these xliiii. volumes (for so many did Pompey set foorth) by leisure, during this time of my residence in the Citty, I drew out all such principles as I thought worthy to be remembred, onely leauing out such notes, the knowledge whereof, could not either be delightfull, nor yet necessary for example. I haue therefore gathered, as it were a bundle of Flowers, to the entent that all such as haue knowledge in the Greeke, might fully bee satisfied, and as for them which are therein vnskilfull, matter of instruction.
                  All which I haue dedicated to your Maiesty, not so much to read, and peruse, as to correct, and also to giue an account of my time, whereof Cato vvilleth a due account should be rendred. It sufficeth me at this present, if your highnesse doe allowe my labours; trusting hereafter, that vvhen the brunt of slaunderous enuy is ouerpaste, they that come after, shall beare vvitnes of my trauell and paines taking.
                  Farewell.

There was then no lawes to bind the people to obedience, but the Princes commaund euer stoode for lawe: then they rather chose to defend their owne kingdomes at home, rather then inlarge their territories by forced violence vppon their neighbors.
                  
                     
                     NInus king of the Assyrians, was the first that changed this olde lawe of Nations, & thirsting after Soueraignty, made warre vpon his neighbor Nations, who being ignorant what way to make resistance, hee easily ouercame, conquering all as he went a long, euen to the borders of Affricke.

But Ninus enlarged the Empire by continuall seizing into his hands all such Countries as hee ouercame: by reason of which conquests ouer the neighboring countries, he so increased in power and grew so strong, that at  length hee woon all the East part of the worlde. The last field that euer hee fought, was with Zoroastres king of the Bactrians, which King is reported to bee the first inuentour of Magycke, and made great search to finde out the beginning of the worlde, and the mouing of the Stars. This Zoroastres being The first inuention of Magyck and Astronomy. slaine, Ninus himselfe dyed also, leauing behinde a Sonne (being vnder age called Nynus) by his wife Semiramis.
                  She durst not commit the gouernment to the child, nor her selfe take it vpon her openly, considring that so many and mighty Nations (which scarcely would obey a man, would much lesse submitte themselues vnto a Woman) resolued thus: that whereas before she was Nynus wife and a woman, she counterfaited A Womans pollicy. 
                      to be his sonne, and also a Boye: and the rather, for that both the mother and the boy were of one stature, one proportion of body, had both small voices, and what was most, both of one fauor. She therefore attyred her selfe in mans apparell, and ware vpon her head a kind of coyfe (called Tyara) and Semyramls weareth más apparell. because people shoulde not mystrust any thing by her new-found attyre, shee commanded them to apparrell themselues in the same manner: which kind of attyre the Assyrians did euer after vse, euen to this day: and in this disguise she was neuer taken for any other but her Sonne.
                  In the time of this disguise she attained many worthy enterprises, by which greatnes, when she thought shee had out-worne E

She builded Babylon, and inclosed it with a wall of Brycke inlayed with Bytumen, a kind of morter much vsed in those Countries. Many worthy enterprises did this Queene atchiue: for not being content to maintaine the estate of the Empire (as her husband left it) she subdued Ethyope, and made warre vpon India, wherinto no man had euer entred, but onely the and Alexander the great. At the last vnnaturaly desiring to company with her own Sonne, she was by him slain, Semyramis slaine by her owne sonne. when she had raigned forty two yeares, after the death of her husband Nynus.
                  
                  
                     Nynus her Sonne, contented himselfe with what his parents had gotten,  shutting vp all manly courage and knighthood, in meere Idlenesse and effeminacy; & as thogh he had changed nature with his mother, gaue himself wholy to women, and among men was very seldome acquainted: his posterity also following his example, answered their people by messengers. The Assyrians (which afterward were called Syrians) held the Soueraignty 1300. yeares.

The last king that raigned was Sardanapalus (a man more nice then any woman) into whose presence Arbactus (whom hee made Lieutenant generall ouer the Medes) could not be admitted: but by long sute he was at last suffered to haue entrance to his presence (which before was neuer graunted vnto any man.) When Arbactus came in, he found him spinning of purple vpon a distaffe in womens attyre in the middle of his Concubines, and he far surpassed all the women there present, both in softnes of bodye, and purity of Vicious wantonnesse the bane of kingdomes. countenance, and thus sat he weighing out to euery one their task: At which sight Arbactus being abashed, grew into high disdaine, that so many worthy men should be subiect to such a womanishe disposition, departed, and presently  made report of that his eyes had seen, and heart disdained: protesting that he for his part, would neuer giue consent longer to obey such a creatur, as had rather be accompanied altogither with women then men. Whervpon the Lords banding themselues togither, bad him battell: he hearing hereof (not like a man resolued to defend his kingdome, but like a woman fearing death) first found a corner wherein to hide his head, and after with a few scatterred soldiers, all out of order came into the field, where being ouercome, he retyrd backe againe to his pallace, and there causing a huge fire to bee Sardanapalus destroys him

                  After Arbactus the worker of his confusion, was made king, and remoued  the Empire from the Assyrians, to the Medes. Long time after (many kings comming betweene) by dissent the kingdome came to Astyages. This man hauing no Issue, saue one onely daughter, dreamt that hee saw springing out of her bellye, a vine, whose branches should ouer-shaddow all Asia:

                      wherupon calling before him all his Soothsayers and Interpreters of dreams, demanded the meaning of this vision: who answerd, that his daughter should bring forth a nephew, whose greatnes was disclosed by this vine, and that by him he should be deposed from his regall dignity.
                  The King being hereby stricken into a maruellous feare, thinking to preuent fate, married away his daughter carelesly: not Nobly at home, to any  of his owne Nation, but to a Persian slaue of verye base estate, and amongst Her name was Mádane them accounted the vildest people liuing: and yet not herewith satisfied, sent for his Daughter (being great with child) that so soone as she was deliuered, he might see the babe destroyed. So soon as the childe was borne, it was giuen to Harpagus a chiefe man of the Kings Councel, to be slaine. Harpagus

About which time, the heardsman himselfe also had a son, whose wife hearing the kings childe should be cast away, earnestly requested her husband to fetch the child that she might haue a sighte thereof. The Shepheard ouercome by his wiues importunity, returned againe into the wood, where hee found a Bitch giuing the childe suck, and also defending it from the violence of foules and wild beasts: who being so much

Assoone as the woman had the babe in her armes, hee smiled and played with her and there appeared such chearefulnesse in him, that she desired her husband rather to cast away his owne child, and she would bring vp that in stead thereof.

                  There was chiefe in this resolution but onely Seauen, who leauing all detraction, Seauen principal plotters in the action. (for feare least if the multitude who was to aide them mighte haue much breathing time, the whole confederacy might happily be bewrayed) therefore euery man preparing with his weapons ready vnder his gown, strait  tooke their way to the kings pallace, and making slaughter of all such as anye way resisted, they came to the very Chamber where these Vsurping Traitors were, who beholding themselues so suddainely surprised, and in daunger, very couragiouflye setled to defend their authority, and with their weapons ready drawne fastned vpon their enimyes and slew two of the chiefest in this conspiracy: Al this notwithstanding, (the conspirators being the greater number) caught hold of some ofthem: Amongst the rest Gobryas catching at one of the wise men held him fast in his armes, and when he perceiued that his copartners staid their hands, (fearing least they should by mistake kill the one instead of the other, for this action fell out in the darke night,) bad them  thrust their swords into the wise man, although it were to the hazzarde of the The truth of Gobrias towards his Countrey. life of Gobryas: but the euent fell out better then the resolution, for it so chanced that they killed the Vsurper, and Gobryas was saued harmelesse.
                  This comming so well about, these Noblemen wan vnto themselues great fame, in that they had by such valour regained againe the kingdome, which was by so polliticke a course long time ruinated: as also their renowne was the more famous, in that when they were in controuersie about the kingdome, they did so well accorde together amongst themselues; For they were al men of high spirit, great warriors, and euery man within himselfe of great estate, that it grew a hard matter in question amongst the people, who was worthiest,  and therefore determined by whole consent, to comit the matter to God and good fortune.
                  This vnion by consent thus ended, they appointed next, that at a certaine time each man vpon his courser should present himselfe before the pallace, in the morning by breake of day: and then he whose horse first neighed before

                  There was amongst the conspitators, one Darius, the sonne of Hystaspis who being greatly perplexed in thought, howe he might by some cunninge slight, gaine the kingdome to himselfe, bestowed much beating and labour in his troubled pate, till at last his horse-keeper perceiuing the whole matter said: If my Lord there be no other thing to crosse your desire, take courage, and let no thought further trouble you, for assuredly the day shall lighte on your side. Hereupon, the euening before the day appointed, he brought his  maisters horse to the same place where this appointed meeting was to be, and thither caused a Mare to be brought, thinking that for desire of the Mare, the The pollicy of a horskeeper. thing would so come to passe, as his Lord and maister had desired, & afterward sorted to their desired wish.
                  The morning being approched (euery man kept the due houre appointed) Darius horse knowing the place, by reason of the courage had to the Mare, forthwith neighed alowde, and first of al the company gaue him a token of his long-thirsted for authority. The residue of the Lords, calling to remembrance their forepassed decree, so soone as they heard the neighing of the horse, dismounted  from their coursers, and saluted Darius by the name of king, and all the people following their example, and allowing the iudgements of their peeres and petty Princes, tooke him from thenceforth for their lawefull and iust king. Thus was the kingdome brought backe againe out of the hands of vsurpers by the exceeding resolution and valour of seauen of the greatest Nobles in all the kingdome into the hands of one man to be gouerned. It is almost not to be credited in course of humain reason, that so many famous, worthy and great personages (notwithstanding that they hazzarded their liues) to regain the kingdome out of the hands of the wise men, and in so great content to let it rest only on the fortunes of Darius, but that they well remembred their faiths was before obliged, and what was more, knew that Darius was very  neerely alyed vnto the auncient kings of Persia. Againe to giue further satisfaction and content to the state of his whole Lande; in the beginning of his raigne (to the entent he might the better establish his kingdome, he ioyned Darius takes to wife the daughter of Cyrus. himselfe into the blood royall) taking in marriage the onely daughter of Cyrus, whereby it appeared, with more plainnes to euery vnderstanding, that the kingdome was not so much in the gouernement of a straunger, as that it was more fully reduced into the family and stocke of king Cyrus.
                  
                  Not long after the Asstrians fell into rebellion, taking the citty of Babilon by force. The king hauing word hereof, grewe into an exceeding great rage  against them, the which rage of his was wel obserued by one Zopyrus, (one of the seuen which subdued and ouercame the wisemen) who withdrew himselfe home to his own house, and calling about him such seruitors as he then had, caused them first to strip him out of his cloths, and then with certaine whips in most lamentable manner to ouerunne all his body, and to cut off his nose, lips, and eares, In this vile & gastly shape, Zopyrus commeth very hastily into

into the presence of the king, who was so amazed hereat, that he stood confounded, and could not tell what might be immagined at this so woful spectacle. At last, gathering vp himselfe, out of this mazed motiues, demaunded who had so shamefully mangled and martyred his body, and vpon what occasion: Zopyrus, stepped forth more neerer vnto the person of the king, and in The loue of Zopirus to the King and Country. secret discoursed his whole intent, and to what end this disguised body of his was thus strangely dismembred, and withall told the king his whole drifte and purpose herein.
                  Thus taking his leaue, he went his way like a wandering Vagarant towards Babylon, wherein grieuous manner before all the Inhabitants, he sheweth this his mangled body, withall falling into most bitter exclamations against king  
                     Darius, rehearsing in what cruelty he had proceeded against him, and that he had receiued such indignity from him, that he had euen bereft him of a part in the kingdome, not by prowesse or manhood, but only by a hard measure of fortune: neyther was it by the applause or election of men, but an exceeding cunning sleight, namely the neighing of a horse. Herevpon hee councelled them, to take warning by this his misery, how they gaue credit to such a dangerous foe. Further he aduertised them, not to rely vpon the weaknes of their walles, but betake them to their weapons: and if they stood so affected, as to make choise of him to take their part in these actions of warre, because of the Zopirus trechery toward the Babylonians. 
                      wronges and wounds he had receiued were still fresh in memory: All which the Babilonians hauing thoroughly considered, and giuing credit to the personage and Nobility of the man, as also for that he was a worthy warryour, and that his wrongs were as a sufficient warrant to credite him, they made him generall ouer all their seruices, and hee to smother and disguise his plot the more, with a small company twice or thrice, set vppon the Persians, and still preuailed, especially for that they gaue way to his purpose for the nonce. At last, seeing him fortunate in all his attempts, they put the whole Army ouer to Zopirus deliuereth Babilon to Darius his trust, who hauing what he came for, deliuered them vp by treason to the king his maister, and by this experienced plot, brought the Citty again  into their former obedience. After this, the King raysed a power, and made warre vpon the Scythians, whereof more shall be set downe in the next booke following.

                     IN reporting the actions of the Scithians, which were no  lesse famous then honorable, it is necessary to beginne our discourse with their first originall. For their beginning was glorious, as their Empire was powerfull: and in renowne of military discipline, the women were accounted nothing inferior to the men. For as the one founded the Empires of the Persians and Bactrians, so the other errected the souerainty of the Amazons: yea Contention betweene the Scythians and Egyptians for antiquity. the exploits of the one sexe so equalized the fortunes of the other, that harde it were to censure, to whether party to giue the garland by way of comparison  for hauty and fortunate enterprises.
                  These Nations were euer accounted most auncient, yet concerning their antiquity many disputations were mooued betweene them and the Egiptians: the Egiptians aledging, that in the beginning when some countreys were scorched with immoderate heat, and others as bitterly vexed with such insufferable cold, that it not onely hindered naturall procreation, but (that worse

                     ellation, that neither the cold of winter, not the heat of summer was any way offensiue to the naturall inhabitatnts. Also the groundes was so fruitfull, that there is no land vnder the Sun, that bringeth foorth more abundance for the vse of man: from hence therefore it may bee very well concluded, that of right men ought to be borne and brought vp, where the soyle of the Countrey is most pleasant to their constitution.
                  To crosse this their affirmation, the Scithians denied, that the temperatenes of the aire, made any thing for proofe of antiquity: insomuch that nature it  selfe so soone as it hath giuen foorth vnto euery seuerall climate such portion of cold or heat as best befyteth: of it owne accord doth breed such bodies, and such creatures, as shall be able to vndetgo the Climate in most delighte: as men and women in their kind, beasts in their places, and sundry trees, herbes, stones and mettals, in their kind, according to the estate and condition of the places, where they are resiant: and howe much the times of yeare and weather, seemed harder and colder in Scithia, then in Egipt, so much the more harder and stouter were the Scithians, rather then the Egiptians. But if the world being now deuided into parts, were once in one lumpe: then whether water in the beginning were Lord of the earth, or fire had got the vper-hande  and so got possession of all things, and by reason hereof, the world wer made, yet the Scithians in both of these must of necessity proue the auncienter. For if you will say fire had the first possession of all, that might by little and little be quenched, and so giue place to the earth, from which, no part coulde bee sooner seperated from the fire, by the extreme nipping of the winter season, then the North: which euen to this day is by experience knowne vnto all people and Nations, that for extremity of cold the North claimeth the preheminence: whereas Egypt, and so likewise all the East partes were a long season in finding forth that temperatenes, wherein they could be satisfyed, as for better  proofe appeareth by them euen at this day, that they haue such an vnmeasurable portion of heat from the sun, that it parcheth and scorcheth their bodies in great extremity.
                  But if all the world were once drownd, then it will soone appeare that the higher the place is, the sooner it is discouered: by this reason, that the waters withdraw themselues into the lower grounds, and there abide some course of time before they can be dried vp, and the sooner it is consumed, then the sooner is it made a place for the breeding of liuing creatures. Now it is wel known that Scythia is so much higher then other Countreys and Dominions, that al the Riuers thereof, take their courses downward, and in their fall meete with  the Riuer of Meotis, and so altogether run from thence into the sea of Pontus, and lastly into the Egiptian Sea.
                  But as for Egipt in it selfe: being by care and great cost of many kinges for many hundred yeares, maintained with huge dams and mighty bankes, there cast vp to resist the rage and violence of the waters, as also strengthened, fortifyed and cut out into ditches and trenches, to the intent that the Waters

So in conclusion of this long controuersie betwixt these two famous Nations, the Egiptians receiued the foile by argument, and the Scythians were euer accounted most auncient, and therefore most Honorable.

                  Their principall food is milke and Honny, they haue no vse of woole, nor know how to make garments thereof: and though they be continually vexed with cold, yet they vse no other clothing, then the skins of wild beasts, and Their food. a certaine vermine called Myce. This is one chiefe ground of their vprightnes  in life, in that they are so moderate in their affections, that they alwaies rest contented with their owne estate, and neuer desire the goods of another. For Clothing. it is euery where to be found, that where abundance of wealth is, there couetousnesse raigneth as a great commaunder, and in the end bursteth foorth into such greedinesse, that it is neuer satisfied but with bloud, or bloudy actions: as murder, warre, and all other calamities of wofull destiny: Againe, it is note worthy, that they should haue that by nature, which the Greekes by instruction of all their wisest men, and precepts of all the Philosophers, so long time continued, could neuer attaine: as also that the exquisit and ciuill manners of the Grecians, shoulde be so farre surmounted, in comparison of the rude and  barbarous Scythians, because they made more vse and profit of their time in the nursery of ignorance and vice, than the other did in the studies and knowledge of vertue.
                  Three seuerall times they won the Empire of Asia, themselues still remayning vnconquered by any enimy, or power offorraine Nation: First against Darius king of Persia, giuing him a great ouerthrow, and after put him to a

most shamefull flight, and at last forced him cleane out from all their territories. Then at another battell against Cyrus, whome they ouercame and slewe with the greatest part of al his armies. Againe in the same manner proceeded they against Zopyron, (a great and principall commaunder to great Alexander) 
                     Their many victories. and all his hoast they vtterly ouerthrewe. Many times rhey were hardely threatned by the Romanes, but they contented themselues, with the onely braues of that Nation, but for their strokes they felt them not.
                  Within some certaine times after, they founded the Empires of the Parthtans 
                     The Scithians strong & stout men. and Bactrians. These were a people of an excellent tough temperature giuen to endure any labor, stout men of warre, and as for strength of body fasurpassed other Nations, hauing minds answerable to their strength of bodie, naughty  and scorning to win where they could not hold and keepe what they got, yet all they aimed at in the chiefe of their conquestes, was Honour, and high estimation.
                  The first that offered to make warre vpon the Scythians, was Vexoris king of Egypt, who sent his Ambassadors long before, to agree vpon certaine articles Vexoris maketh the first warres vpon the Scithians of obedience. The Scithians hauing receiued aduertisement of the kings comming against them, made slight account therof, and gaue answere to the Ambassadors after this manner: We cannot but maruell that the King and ruler of so mighty and rich a people, will so vnaduisedly moue war against vs Beggers,  which he should rather haue expected at home at his own doores, considering that the ende of warre is doubtfull, and victory can yeeld from vs small reward, but very apparant losse: wherefore we Scithians wil not abide his comming to vs, but withal speed make towards him to meet him on the way, or rather into his owne lande, for that we know there is treasure of infinite value, worthy the labor we shall vndertake: And accordingly they made good by action, what they promised by word. The king vnderstanding that they remained resolute, and that they made vpon him in such speedy manner, sledde for feare, leauing behind his whole army, with all their furniture of warre, and secretly recouered himselfe into his owne kingdome: But the Scithians coulde  not make pursute after him into Egipt, by reason of the fenny contrys, wherwith The Scithians conquer Asia. they were altogither vnacquainted. As they made their returne homewards, they tooke all Asia in their way, which with some small labour they conquered, and made them tributary, rather to shew foorth their conquestes, then any boaste they tooke in their victory: Also they were constrained to make their resiance in those Confines, the space of fifteene yeares, before they could further make any setled state of gouerment in those Nations. At last they were called home, at the great and importunate requestes of their women, from whom they had receiued a message by the whole consent of the women, that if after so long absence, they did not speedily returne, they would The message of the Scithian wom

                      seeke to haue issue from their neighbouring Nations, and not thus through their negligent respect, suffer the name and Nation of the Scithians, to decay.
                  Thus became Asia tributary to the Scithians for the space of 1500. yeares: and Nynus king of the Assirians, was the last that yeelded this tribute money vnto them.
                  About this time there were among the Scythians, two young Gallants of

the blood royall, named Plinos and Scolopythus, these two being at great variance Plinus and Scolopithus banished. with the Nobles, was by a generall consent banished: who when they saw the hard measure that was laide vppon them, drew into their faction, a great number of the younger sort of the Gentlemen of the Countrey and others, and ranging abroad for a place of abode, at last setled themselues vpon the bounds of Cappadocia, about the Riuer of Thermodoon, taking possession of all the fieldes and landes about the Citty called Themyscira: many yeares liued they there vpon the spoile of such inhabitants as were thereabouts: whereupon the people being wearied of these Out-lawes, priuily at vnwares gathered themselues togither, and giuing the assault vppon them on the suddaine, put  them to the sworde, without sparing any. Their wiues perceiuing they were thus fallen into a double mischiefe, as first that they were banished, and nowt The first originall of the Amazons. by this sudden action also become widdowes, betooke themselues to armes, and stood upon the defence of these borders as their owne, and after by making war vpon their neighbours (the rather because they had a full resolution not to marry againe, especially with their neighbours) saying it was rather a bondage then otherwise to be accounted. After, they both increased and gouerned their Commonwealth without men, and also defended themselues against all the forces of men: and fearing that they which had husbands leaste should be accounted in better state then the rest, they very bloudily murdred those men they had amongst them: and in reuenge of the deaths of their husbands  which their neighbors had most cruelly put to the sword, they fell vpon them, and rewarded them by death also.
                  Thus hauing by war purchased peace, they sent for men and accompanied with them: and when any childe was borne, if it were a male, it was presently killed, if a female it was preserued and brought vp: but how, not in idlenesse, neither to learne to spin and carde, but valiantly in feates of armes, as ridinge The training vp of the Amazonians great horse, hunting, hauking, and al the exercises that belongs to men: and that they should not haue any hinderance of martiall exercises, as shooting, or throwing of dartes, their right paps was seared off with hot Irons when they  were infants, whereupon they were euer after called Amazons.
                  
                  They had amongst them two Queenes, Marthesia and Lampedo, who alwaies deuided their Armies into two parts, and when they were grown mighty in wealth, they tooke it by turnes, one to gouerne at home, and the other to gouerne and lead to the warres vpon other Nations abroade: And that they Two queens ouer the Amazons. might be accounted the more renowned in all their exploits and enterprises, they made it knowne by proclamation, that they themselues were the onely and immediate daughters of Mars. They conquered the greatest part of al Europe, and subdued also many Citties in Asia, where they builded the famous Citty of Ephesus, and many other Citties besides. They discharged a great

The other part which remained still behind to defend the worthy and mighty Empire of Asia, were suddainely assaulted by the Barbarians, and put to the sword, amongst whome was their Queene Marthesia shamefully murthered.

Gallies on the Amazonian Shores, and suddenly assaulted them at vnawares. At his comming thither the Queendome was gouerned by two of the foure Sisters (called Antiope and Orithia) Orithia was abroad in forren parts vpon occasion of warres, by reason  whereof, there was but a slender guard about the person of the partner Queen Antiope, neither was there any mistrust of any enimies approch, wherby they accounted themselues to haue lesse neede of such companies, as in former times they were forced to entertaine. Vpon which sudden charge giuen, they sounded as suddaine an alarm, whereby those smal companies which they had, ran presently to their armes, and in the end gaue the enimy a very easie victory: for many were slaine, and many taken prisoners, among whome were the two Sisters of Antiopes: Menalippe taken by Hercules, and Hippolite, by Theseus. Afterward Theseus made his prisoner, his wife, vpon whom he begot Hippolitus: 
                      But Hercules after victory, restored Menalippe back againe to her sister, and onely tooke for her ransome the Queenes armor, and hauing accomplished Hercules giueth Menalippe his prisoner for the quee. armor. all his affaires giuen him in charge, returned backe againe to the King.
                  
                     Orithia hauing knowledge of all that had hapned, and that the Prince of Athens had caried one of them away by strong hand and violence, rouzed vp her Countrymen to reuenge: giuing them in flat tearmes, that all their conquests, both in Asia and Pontus was but vaine, if they shoulde put vp such a foile at the hands of the Greekes: not so much in regard of the wrong receiued by war, as the foule rauishments they had offered them by the Athenians.

                     Here we returne againe to the Hystories of the Scythians.
                  
                  THe Scythians had now made their third voyage into Asia, where they remained the space of seauen yeeres, seperating themselues by this long stay out of the company and remembrance of their wiues and children: For their wiues being a long time wearied by their absence, supposed that the  wars could not so continue, but rather gathered that they were al slaine, and being herin resolued, they generally agreed to marrie euery one their seruant (or slaue) which their maisters had left at home onely to attend their heardes of Cattel. These things thus falling out by contraries, news was brought, that their maisters were returning home with conquest, and brought alonge with them very large spoiles: The seruants to welcome them, banded themselues The bondmen of the Scithians made warre vpon their Maisters. together in most rebellious maner, and at their aproch bad them a most sharp and dangerous fight, with full intent to giue them not the reward of Maisters, but accounting them as their enimies and strangers.
                  The Scythians wisely considring, that by continuing wars against them they should now loose what before they had won, aduised themselues to another  kind of fight, and calling to their remembrance that they had not to doe with an open enimy, but with their Slaues, (who were not to be tamed with force of armes) but by the law of bondage: brought with them into the fielde an abundant number of whips, instead of other weapons, and eue

The women also, that vvere guilty in this action,

most desperatly made hauock among themselues, some by weapons, and som by most inhumane violence hanged themselues.
                  After this the Scithians liued in peace vntill the dayes of Lan-thine their king, vpon whom Darius king of Persia made war (as is before mentioned) because he would not giue consent to haue his daughter in marriage) and with seuen hundred thousand men in armes, he entred into Scytbia
                           •
                        
                      at last hauing spent sometime in great disdain, to giue countenance to these his excursions, insomuch as they neuer made any shew of giuing battell to them, hee fearing that if the bridge ouer the riuer of Danow shuld chance to be broke, he might Darius entreth into Sci thia with a great Army. thereby be preuented and also inclosed, so that he could not returne home againe, retired back againe ouer the water, in great feare, with the losse of fourscore  and ten thousand men: and yet his numbers were so huge and mightie, that this losse was nothing accounted of. Afterwarde hee conquered the lesser Darius conquers Asia the lesse, 
                     Asia, and Macedony, and the Ionians, at Sea, and brought them also vnder his subiection: and hauing certaine intelligence that the Athenians had aided the Ionians against him, he fully bent all his power vpon that Nation.
                  And forsomuch as we are come to the wars and victories of the Athenians, which they compassed beyond all mans expectation, as also beyond all credit A digression to the acts of the Athenians. they atchieued: and forsomuch as the acts and deeds of the Athenians, were greater in effect, then in hope could any way be wished: therfore their originall is to be set downe in fewe wordes, because their encrease came not  from a base beginning to so high estate, as other Nations in former times haue done.
                  They boast highly as well of their first original, as also their great increase among themselves: for it was not by strangers, nor a multitude of raskals gathered from all partes of the worlde, that first founded that Cttiy: but they were bred and brought vp, in that same soile and continent, whereas they stil inhabited: and that the place of their dwelling, was also the place of their originall beginning.
                  They are held also for to be the first that had the vse of weauing and making  cloth, as also of Oyle and wine: and whereas in former times men liued What thigns the athenians first muented onely vpon Acornes, they by painefull industry found out the vse of the plough, and so in shorte time had corne in great abundance. And without doubt, all order of ciuill gouernement, learning and clloquence, may well yeeld the Garland to this Nation of the Athenians.
                  
                  Before the daies of Deucalion, they had a king was called Cecrops, (who if you will giue any credite to the report of auncient fables) had two faces, and Deucalion said to haue two faces. therefore is said to be the first among the Heathen that ioyned men and women togither, as it were a resemblance of marriage.
                  After him succeeded Crandus, who had a daughter named Atthis, and she it was that gaue name vnto the Countrey. Next follovved Amphitrion, and he  fyrst consecrated this Cittie to Minerua, and so it came to be called Athens. In these dayes there came vpon the land so great a slood, that the greater part of Greece was ouerflowne thereby, which made so great hauocke of the inhabitants that there was none escaped, saue onely such as could recouer to the

tops of mountaines, or get into vessels or ships, and so sailed to Deucalion king of Thessaly, for which succor that this Nation found at his hand, they euer after reported him to be the onely preseruer and repairer of mankind. Then by order of succession, the kingdome discended to Erictheus, in whose time the sowing of corne was found out at Eleusis, by one Sir-named Triptolemus: 
                     Sowing of Corne first found out. In liew of which benifite receiued, the night sacrifices were after instituted in the honor of Ceres.
                  
                  
                     Aegeus also the father of Theseus reigned as sole Soueraigne in Athens, 
                     Aegeus. from whom Medea being deuorsed (by reason her sonne in-law Theseus was growne vp to mans estate) tooke her iourney to Colchos with her owne sonne  
                     Medus, whom she bare by Aegeus. Then fell the kingdome vpon Theseus, and after him to his sonne Demophoon, who bent all his powers in aid of the Greeks against the Troyans. There were many quarrels betweene the Athenians and the Doriens vpon auncient and deadlye grudginges, which the Doriens kepte stil in mind, intending a time of shape reuenge vpon them, but as yet founde no fit opportunity to put in execution their longe retained mallice. In the end concluded that they would send to the Oracle to aske counsel what might be done herein. They receiued this answere that they should get the better of their enimies, alwaies prouided that they laid no violent hand vppon the king of Athens. Herevppon when they came into the field, a generall charge was  giuen, that in no case the king shuld suffer any danger by the hand of any man. His name was Codrus the king of Athens, who had vnderstanding both of the answere of Apollo, as also of the charge giuen through the campe of his enemies, Codrus wherefore he stripped himselfe our of his princely robes, and so putting himselfe into a sute of rags, with a bundle of vine shreds on his neck, in which disguise, he attempted into the compe of his enimies, and being now amongst them there flocked a great throng of souldiers about him, wondering at this so mishapen an Anticke, where he was slaine by a common souldier, whome he had most grieuously wounded with a hook of set purpose. The Doriens hauing vnderstanding that hee that was slaine amongest them was Codrus the King,  were so dismaide thereat, that they presently forsooke the field, without anye more resistance or strokes: And by this meanes the Athenians (by theresolution of their king and captain, who rather chose to put himself into the hands of death, rather then to make shipwracke of the safety of his Countrey) were preuented and deliuered from this grieuous war. With his death ended the Codrus the last King of Athens. gouernment, for after him was there neuer any more kings in Athens.
                  
                  Then became the gouernment of the commonwelth into the hands of magistrates, who were yearely chosen and appointed therevnto. But the Cittye Athens gouerned by

This man so bare himselfe betweene the people and the Senate, that although it vvere hard for one man to take such a course vvhereby both parties might rest contented, yet he so cunningly and so grauely behaued him selfe, that he at once gained equall goodvvill from both.
                  
                     
                     
                  
                  Amongst many worthy actes of this man, this one is to be recorded in euerlasting memory: When the Athenians and the Megarenses had long fought, & endured many battels and much bloud-shed, about the winning and keeping the Isles of Salamine, vnto  the which both made their claime and challenged as right, and had almost wasted and consumed themselues and their substance in maintnance of this war, Insomuch that the Athenians made it highe Treason to any, that therafter shuld make claim to any of those  llandes. Hereupon Solon noting the strict edict that The wise pollicy of Solon went out, grew exceeding sorrowful, least by holding his speech, he should neglect the duty he ought vnto the Common weale: again if he spoke, he broght himselfe within daunger of the Law. To preuent both  which eminent dangers to the State, he fained himselfe starke madde, vnder which disguise, hee might Solon fained madnesse. not only say, but doe things forbidden: To this purpose, he put himselfe into a Fooles coate, and so runneth out amongst a multitude of people, and being in the middle of the rowt (and the rather to further his intended purpose) in certaine broken Rymes and Meeters, of all other to him most vnacquainted, he began to incite and stirre vp the people to that thinge which was most vnlawfull, wherein (although he were thus disguised) his words so wrought in the eares and iudgements of the people, that sodainly they proclaimed open Warres against the Megarenses: In which attempt they ouercame their Enemies,  and brought backe the Island vnder their subiection.
                  The Megarenses being thns politikelie preuented, shut not vp their mallice but practised some other way to reuenge themselues vppon the Athenians: 
                     The Megarenses seeke reuenge among the Noble-women. wherevpon they sodainly embarked themselues, vpon set purpose to come & surprize all the Noble-women and Matrones of Athens, as they were at the celebration of their night Sacrifyces vnto the honour of Ceres, in the temple

at Eleusis: Of this had knowledge one Pisistratus (a worthy Captain amongst the Athenians) who gaue commaundement the women shoulde celebrate these ceremonies, in all points as they had doone before, with iollitye and much reioycing, wherby there should grow no suspition, that they had heard any thing of their enemies intent and purpose, and so laying certaine bands of Souldiers in ambush abroad in diuers places was ready at all assayes to receiue the enimy: At last the Megarenses had recouered the coast whereunto they sailed, landed their men, and began to ranke them vp in battell arraye, when vpon the sudden Pisistratus brake vpon them, and violently ouercame them, and put them al to the sword, and forthwith entred into their Ships, (in which he put a great number of the women, thinking thereby to deceiue and  and make a shew as if they were prisoners) and presently againe spread their sayles, taking the directcst course they coulde, to returne backe againe to the Cittic Aegera.
                  
                  The townesmen of Megera looking abroad, discouered their owne Nauie of shippes to be floting vpon the waters, and in those ships they might perceiue The townes men of Megera mistake a multitude of women to be there amongst (all vvhich they vainly supposed to be the booty they had so long sought after) they went forth to meet them, all which when Pisistratus perceiued, he instantly raised a power of men and came against them, making much hauocke and slaughter uppon them,  and had they not so sodainly recouered themselues againe into their Cittye, he had also bin Lord and conqueror thereof. And thus all the deuises and pollices of the Megarenses, turned to the triumph and victory of the couragious Athenians.
                  
                  
                     Pisistratus after all his great victories gotten, turned them vnto his owne priuate commodity, and not to the generall good of the vvhole Nation, and Pisistratus by pollicy vsurpeth at last by vsurpation and treason wound himselfe into the sole gouernement and kingdome. To this end, by subtlety and set purpose, he suffied his bodye to be rent and mangled with whips and scourges at his owne house, and in this lamentable maner, he commeth forth among the people, and when they were gathered togither in a route, shewed his wounds, making moste bitter exclamations  against the Nobility, by whose censure he said this punishment was inslicted. In reporting of which complaints vnto the people, the water trickled downe his cheekes, wherevvith (as also the reprochfull speeches vttered against The multitude beleeue his hypocrisye. the Nobles) he set the giddy-headed multitude on fyre, making them beleeue that for the loue he bare vnto their common good, he was thus punished and hated of the whole Senate. When he had ended all his hypocriticall Oration, they presently consented togither to ayde him with a very strong guard of men, which continually attended on his person: which hauing gotten, he not onely employed as his guarde to keepe his person, but with that  band of men, he also got the kingdome. He raigned the terme of twenty and foure yeares.
                  
                     Pisistratus being dead left behind him two sonnes, the one called Diocles, who rauished a mayden, and vvas slaine by the brother of the same Mayde: the other called Hyppias succeeded in the kingdome, when hee was seated hee gaue straight command to apprehend the body of him that sluc his brother

                     Dyocles, who being brought before him, he deliuered ouer to bee tormented in the cruellest manner could be inflicted, only to get from him the knowledg of all those who were any way consenting to the murder. This prisoner being resolute, nothing feared the stroke of death, but in the very extremity of this A notable strong resolution. extorted miserie, spake of diuers men who were the greatest and dearest familiar friendes that were about this Tyrant, who laying hold vpon his accusation, condemned them euery man to present execution. His friends thus being dispatched, he saide: Are there yet any more that are confederated in the bloud of my brother. No more (quoth he) aliue, whom I would see dead, saue thy selfe onely: By which it euidently appeared, that he not only satisfied his  hatefull reuenge vpon the Tyrant, but also in some measure, rewarded the losse of his Sisters chastity.
                  The Cittizens also began to thinke vpon the auncient liberties that they had possessed, and seeing that terror and tyranny gouernd all his actions, they gathered them togither against him, and shortly after deposed him, and after that banished him for euer out of the Countrey. When he was thus dealt against, he tooke his course to Persya, and there made tender of his seruice vnto Darius, who was euer a mortal enimy to the Athenians, and maintaind continuall hostilitie against them (as hath heretofore more at large been shewed) and with him he serued as a Commander, euen in all their excurtions against  his owne countrey.

But when they perceiued no quick returne, considering their hast and much affayres in present hand (about religion) which held the space of foure dayes, they resolued with themselues not to make any longer stay for their supply, but with their owne forces, which was not aboue ten thousand

                  The chiefe Commander and captaine of these forces, was committed vnto Milciades, whose only councell was, that rather then they shoulde staye for The Noble courage of Milciades. ayde from any other Nation, they woulde couragiously aduenture, and with more aduantage recouer by speedy forwardnesse; then sustaine losse by theyr sluggish lingering.

Thus the Persyans being ouercome sled vnto their ships, whereof many were sunke and many taken.
                  
                     
In this battell euery man bestowed his best endeuors, and their manhood exceeded high, and worthy euerlasting renowne. Amongest all others, the glory of one young man called Themystoeles, shewed it selfe in great admyration, in whome there appeared such resolute perfourmance, that it was euery way likely, that for his valour he was the next to be elected and chosen chiefe Captaine amongst them.
                  Also there was one other (called Cynegarus) who was in account no better than a common souldiour of Athens, whose praise is highly to bee remembred amongst al Writers. This man, after innumerable slaughters receiued in the Battayle, as also hauing pursued the Enemy in flight euen to their ships,

His right hand being gone in this manner, he laide hold vpon her as before with his left hand, the which he also lost as he had his right: Then seeing both his hands smitten off, he caught hold of the shippe with his teeth in such eager manner, that being neither discouraged by the great and heauy slaughter and effusion of bloud, nor yet dismayed with the losse of both his handes, yet like a sauage and wilde beast he sought reuengmenr euen with his teeth.

                  This being done he called vnto him one of his trusty Seruantes, to whom he deliuered them, giuing him in straight charge to take his direct way vnto A cunning pollicy of Demetratus.

                  By this time had Xerxes readye in the fyelde about seuen thousande of his owne kingdome and people, and three hundred thousand of all other nations: The mighty host of

Insomuch as it hath not (and that for good cause) bene reported, that his Army was of such multitudes, that as they trauelled they dranke all the Riuers dry, and further that the whole countrey of Greece, was searse able to receiue his hoast: It is also reported that he had a Nauy of ten hundred thousand ships. This mighty hoast being thus gathered togither, wanted nothing so much as a couragious and excellent chiestaine to be their gard: For if ye respect the king, he had a great deale more wealth then valour: for his realme Xerxes more welthy then couragious. was of that inestimable treasure, that though all the Riuers coulde not finde them water to quench their thirst, yet had he more coine then coulde in any short time be spent And it is thus reported of him, that he was the last in  fight, and the first that would run away. In danger he was fearefull, out of danger proud and insolent: Finally, before he came to the chiefe tryall of battell, he vaunted and gloried so much in his owne strength, that (as if he had bene Lord ouer-nature) he brought mountaines to plaine ground, and fylled vp vallies, making bridges ouer certain Seas, and cut through much main land, to make a neerer way for his ships to passe: His comming into Greece, as it was terrible, so his departure was as shamefull and dishonourable: for when Leonides king of Spartans, with foure thousand men had gotten the streights of Thermopyle, Xerxes in disdaine of his small number, commaunded that not a man more should giue the assault vpon them, saue onely those, whose kinred  was slain at the battell of Marathon: who to reuenge the deathes of their kinred, was the fyrst that were brought to the Iawes of death, and began the slaughter: and still as they were slaine, new men came vp in their roomes, till the slaughter was mightily increased: Three daies lasted this dangerous battailes, and the Persians maintained the fyght to their great losse: The fourth day, word was brought to Leonides, that twenty thousand of his enimies had taken the top of the hil, whereupon he began to exhort his partakers that they would depart for that time, and rather to reserue their aide till further opportunitye might giue occasion for the further defence of their Countrey: As for himselfe and his companies of Spartanes, they would hazzard the frowne  of fortune: alledging this for reason, that he accounted not so much his own The loue of Leonides to his countrey. life, as he did the generall good of his Countrey, as also that there ought a remainder to be kept for the defence of Greece. When thus the pleasure of the king was published and fully made knowne, they all departed, sauing the Lacedemonians, and they would by no meanes leaue him, but remained still with the King.
                  In the beginning of this war, counsell was asked of Apollo at Delphos, where answere was returned, that either the king of the Spartans must die the death, or the Citty be vtterly destroyed. And therfore when Leonides should go onward The answer from the Oracle. to these warres, he gaue such worthy encouragement to his Souldiers  and followers, that euery man yeelded himselfe willingly to die with their master. To this end he tooke the streightes, that with that small number he had, he might winne more honour, or else lesse daunger to the common-wealth: wherefore hauing dismissed all that were about him, saue onely the Spartanes, he began to call vpon them that they should not forget themselues, that howsoeuer they fought, yet the end was, that they must be slaine, and therefore

councelled them to giue no cause for after times to report, that their hearts serued them better to abide the fight, then fight with courage, vrging still vpon them that they must be very watchfull and carefull in all their affayres, and not stand still and so giue way to Idlenesse, and so the enemie getting aduantage compasse them about to their vtter ruyne: but 
                        •
                     rather labour by the contrary, to preuent their enemyes by all aduantages. Assoone as night approched, and opportunity offered, they set vpon the enemy while they in carelesse manner were frolicke in their Tentes (for Conquerors cannot die more honourably, then in the Campe of their Enemies.) Vpon these his words vnto them, they put themselues in Armes, and being but sixe hundred strong, brake violently The valour of Leonides and the Spartans. 
                      into the Campe of fyue hundred thousand: at last they came to the Kinges owne Pauillion, of set purpose eyther to die with him, or if by multitudes they were ouercome, yet would they make their toombes within the kinges owne tent. Vpon this sodaine action, all the Campe was in an vprore, and the Lacedemonians, seeing the king not to be found, ranged still throughout the camp as Conquerors, ripping vp with their swordes, and spoiling all that came in their way, as men that came not in hope of victory, but only to reuenge their owne deathes.
                  This battell continued in this furious manner, from the closing vp of the Sunne, all that night, and most part of the next day, yet was neyther party vtterly  ouercome, but both weary of ouercomming, fell downe dead amongst the heapes of dead enemies.
                  
                     Xerxes had now receiued a second losse in battell vpon the Land, wherfore he intended to leaue the land-fortune, and venter next at Sea. But Themystocles (a great captain among the Athenians) hearing that the Ionians (in whose quarrell the king of Persya made all this warre) were come vp to the ayde of the Persians with a great Nauy of ships, began to beat out what they intended, to see if it were possible by any meanes to draw away and allure them to take his part: and in that he could not well compasse a personall presence with them, he commanded these words following to be engrauen vpon certaine stones,  which stones were set vp at euery Port where they should come on shore. A notable pollicy of Themistocles.
                  
                  What mad men are ye (O ye Ionians?) or what mischiefe do you intend? purpose ye to raise war vpon those who were your first and originall founders, and now of late your new reuengers? haue we builded and reedified your wals, His Oration. to the intent you should take vpon you to destroy ours? what if we had not these occasions of warre: First with Darius, and now with Xerxes? seeing we forsooke ye not, when he rebelled against vs, why do ye not forsake that siege, and fly vnto vs, and pertake of our companies? If you perswade your selues, you cannot do this without great danger, yet at least when the battels shall be ioyned, you may easily slip aside, and then by withdrawing your ships, quite  forsake the battell.
                  Before this incounter, Xerxes sent foorth foure thousand men to Delphos, 
                     Xerxes ouerthroweth the Temple of Apollo. thinking to make hauocke of the Temple of Apollo, accounting it not a suffycient reuenge vpon the men, but warred also euen with the Gods, but the theyr reward was, that they were destroyed by Thunder and lightning, letting them vnderstand, that the more the Goddes are angred with men, the lesse power

hath man against God. Afterwards, he set fyre on the Citties of Thespy, Plate and Athens: but the people were sled before foorth of those Citties, and seeing he could not destroy the people by the sword, he reuenged himselfe vpon their houses by fire.
                  The Athenians after the battell at Marathon (by the counsell of Themistocles, who told them that the victory which they had gotten ouer the Persyans, was but the beginning of a farre greater warre) made a fleet of Ships of two hundred saile: So that when Xerxes made out towards them, they sent to aske counsell of the Oracle at Delphos, what was to be done, which gaue vnto them this answere, that they must prouide and make vp woodden walles, for theyr

                  Therefore all the whole flect of their partners and partakers being thus assembled togither in the compas of the narow Seas, which adioyneth to the Ile of Saltmine, thereby in time to preuent a further mischiefe, least they should be inclosed by the great and puissant power of Xerxes, euen then (I say) when they were in the depth of consultation, how this fyght at sea might be best maintained, there arose among them a sudden and vnlooked for disturbance A mutiny amongst the Princes. and variance, amongst the Princes of the Citties: euery one bethinking how he might priu

                  Vpon this breach of their owne peace amongst themselues, Themistocles was stricken into a thousand feares (least by the departure of his friendes and

During all this fyerce fyght on both parts, Xerxes stood aloofe, as he had bin a looker on, and (being guarded with a good number of sufficient Ships, well The val

the formost Captaines in this battell: So that Xerxes shewed in himselfe an effeminate fearefulnesse, & in this Queene appeared a resolute and manly courage.
                  In the heat of this Battell, the Ionians, according as Themystocles had giuen in charge, began by little and little, to withdraw themselues out of the prease, which raysed a great discouragement to the whole Army: Insomuch as the Persyans began to look out which way was best for them, to retire themselues, The Persians discomsited by Sea. and so if it were possible to make a suddaine escape, wherein they threw themselues into so confussed a disorder, that they drew vpon themselues an vtter ouerthrow, and finally were put to a most shamefull flight: In which discomfiture many ships were taken, and many sunke, but many there were among  them, that more feared the kings cruelty, then the fury of the Enemy, and therefore secretly stole away, and betooke them to their seuerall homes.
                  This slaughter and hauocke made in the Army, stroke Xerxes into a wonderful feare, so that he stood as one amazed and knew not what to determine: The counsel of Mardonius. till at the last there came vnto him one Mardonius, and counselled him to depart home into his kingdome, with all the hast he could, for feare the rumor of an ouerthrow (which commonly addeth to things that which they are not) mightraise an insurrection amongst his subiectes, before he could recouer himselfe to be amongst them, and that he should leaue with him three hundred thousand of the tallest and most sufficientest picked Souldiers of the army,  with which companies he might either (to his honor) subdue all Greece, or (if it otherwise fell out) without dishonor to his Maiesty, giue place to his Enemies.
                  This counsell of Mardonius, was generally well allowed of, whereupon the fore-remembred number of men were giuen vnto him in charge, and the king with the remainder of his hoast, and all the hast they possible could, made returne home into his owne land.
                  The Greekes hauing knowledge of the kings flight, presently drew to counsell, how it might suddenly be brought to passe, that the bridge which he (as  being Lord of the Sea) had made at Abydus, might be rased downe and broken, to the intent that thereby his passage might be hindred and clean cut off, or els he with his whole army might be vtterly destroied and brought to such an exigent, as if not clearely ouercome, he might be compelled at the least to desire peace at their hands.
                  
                     Themystocles fearing least if his enimies should be stopped of their passages, that it might thereby increase their courage, and so turne their dispaire into hardinesse, insomuch as they saw no way but death on euery side, and so make way by fury of their swords, told them that there were already too many enimies Themistocles sendeth his seruant a second time to Xerxes. in Greece, and therefore his iudgement no way allowed, that they  should by such indirect meanes keepe or hinder them against their willes. At last, perceiuing that his counsell was generally reiected, he sent the same seruant againe to Xerxes, acquainting him with all their whole intent, and therefore wished him to make all the speed he could possible, if he meant to escape their furious malice bent against him.
                  The king at this sodaine newes, was now againe stricken into an exceeding

feare, wherefore he deliuered ouer all his huge Army, vnto seuerall captaines, Xerxes slieth for feare. to be by them deliuered home, whilst he himselfe with those few straglers that were left, made toward Ahydos: where finding the bridge broken with the fury and tempests of the Winter, he ferried ouer very fearefully in a Fishers boat.
                  This was a thing worthy note: to behold as in a glasse the frailty of this worlds honor: how that he was now glad to be harboured vp in a little boat, which but A worthy note of mans frailty. euen a litle before, all the Sea could scarce be able to receiue, and also to see so great a king cleane bereft of all attendance, and seruice, whose armies (by reason of their huge multitudes) was euen a burthen to the earth: neither had those Armies that he had assigned ouer to seuerall Captaines, any better successe  by land: For notwithstanding their daily trauel (as scarcely there can be little rest, where there is continuall feare) they were surprised with so suddain and vnsufferable measure of hunger, that the very want of victuals, broughte vpon them the pestilence, where of they died in such great abundance, that the Pesilence andfamine a one time in the Persian hoa

                  In this meane time Mardonius tooke the Citty of Olynthus in Greece, by assault: also he intreated with the Athenians about a peace to be concluded betweene them and the king, promising that he would make good all their Citties Mardonius winneth Olynthus.

                      (when they had parted the gold of the Persians amongest them) grew into so great disorder and riot, that it was a hard matter for their Gouernors and leaders to pacifie their outragious tumults: Also the same day that Mardonius

                  When these warres were come to end, and that by long consultation, it was determined how euery Citty should be rewarded, by a generall voyce,

the Athenians were iudged to haue borne themselues herein most valiantly: The m

Againe discending amongst euery priuate Captaine, the whole verdict ranne vpon Themystocles, as chiefe and principall, which added vnto him an exceeding credite and renowne of all the chiefe inhabitants of the whole countrey. Thus grew the Athenians into high esteeme, and were so worthily increased both in riches and honor, that they began to build their Citty new out of the ground: These tidings came to the eares of the Lacedemonians, how that the Athenians had enchroched and taken in more ground then in former times, and so farre enlarged the walles of their Citty, that they had them in great lclousie, and wisely bethought themselues what might be the ende hereof, and what strength they might growe vnto by peace, seeing they had so wel prosyted  by the spoile thereof: wherefore they presently dispatched Ambassadors, vnto them to warne them not to build fortresses to nourish vp their enimies, neither with strong holdes to furnish the warres that was very like to fall forth hereafter.

Thus hauing dispatched  the Ambassadors of Sparta: he wished the Cittizens to make all hast they coulde in their worke, and shortly after himselfe tooke the Ambassage in hand: In which iourney, what with sometime faining himselfe sicke, and what by putting faulte in the slackenes of such as were ioyned with him in commission (without whom he could not determine any thing) that he at last delayed the time so long, that in the meane space they had fully put an end, to their long and tedious workes: Tidings was brought to Lacedemon, that notwithstanding all offers that was made, the building of the Cittie went on a pace at Athens: whereupon they appointed new Ambassadors againe, to take the iourney and returne certaine word, whether it was true had  bene reported.
                  When Themystocles saw how thinges were carried, and that their iclousie more and more increased, he sent a certaine seruant of his owne with letters to all the chiefe magistrates of Athens, containing thus in effect: that they Themystocles sendeth letters to the whole Magistracy. should make stay of the Spartan Ambassadors, least that they should offer him any violence, till they heard further from him being at Lacedemon: hauing this done, he went boldly before the whole Senate or counsell of the Lacedemonians, certifying for trueth that Athens was now thoroughly fortifyed, and more then that, it was able to withstande the force of any enemy, not onely by sword, but by the strength of their walles also: and therefore if they  offred vnto him any other then faire play, in regarde of what he had done, their Ambassadors, which they had lately sent, vvere kept as Hostages for his preseruation and safety at Athens, vvithall, he grevv vpon them in such high terms, and foule rebukes, for that they coueted to haue the soueraignity ouer them, vvhich they coulde not maintaine by their ovvne povvers, but must craue help, from other nations of whom vvhen they stood in most need, could

Moreouer, he wrote vnto Xerxes, on this manner, that whatsoeuer messenger he sent vnto him, he should put hym to present execution, for feare that by some whisperinges all their plots might be destroyed: But Aristides the chiefe Captaine of the Athenians (being chosen also his equall and fellowe Gouernor in all these Aristides preuenteth the Treason warres) in that he opposed himselfe against all his enterprises, and that he  verye wisely foresawe what was most like to ensue hereof, vnfolded and reuealed all the whole intentes and purposes of these treasons: Wherupon Pausanias being arraigned, conuicted, and found guilty, was accordingly with all hast they could executed. But as for Xerxes, when he perceiued that all their Pausanias condemned. plottes and conspiracies were disclosed, determined once more to proclaim open warres against the Grecians.
                  
                  The Grecians preparing themselues in readines to receiue the foe, appointed for their Captaine, one Cymo of Athens, the sonne of one Milciades, who Cymo made great captain was their Graund Captaine at the battell of Marathon, a very Noble young Gentleman, whose vertuous and forward disposition, declared before hand,  what honor and valour was likely to attend him in all his aduentures: for his father being cast into prison for robbing the common treasury was in the said prison found dead and might not be admitted buriall, he submitted himselfe into the same setters of Iron which his father ware, tooke vpon him his fathers offences whereby he redeemed the dead body of his Father, and gaue it buriall. His naturall loue to his father. And on the other side their trust in him was not deceiued, in that they called him to so great a place: for he was a man of such couragious spirit (as also his father before him) that he vanquished and cleane ouercame Xerxes both by Land and Sea, forcing him fearefully to retyre home into his  owne kingdome.

                     THis Xerxes great king of Persia (to whom was added this name; The terrour of all other Nations) when he had sped so vnfortunately in his warres in Greece, vvas held in a generall contempt amongst al his subiects: vvherupon  
                     Xerxes slaine by treason. 
                     Artabanus (a principall Lieutenant of his kingdome) perceiued the glory and estate of the king daily to decay, and foolishly soothing vp his ovvn conceits, that hee might very easily enioy the kingdome, notwithstanding his seuen sonnes, (who were all very tall and strong men) vpon an euening entered the kings pallace, (for the king reposed such considence in him, that it was lawfull for him, to come and go whensoeuer he pleased) and seizing vpon the person of the king, shamefully murthered him.
                  Hauing thus slaine the king, he sought also how by some quaint slight or The treason of Artabazanus. pollicy he might destroy his children, of whom he stood in doubt, that they  should hinder his enterprises: But as for Artaxerxes which was a very childe, he thought he might abuse him as he listed; and to the intent he might the sooner compasse the kingdome, he bare him in hand that the king was murdered by Darius, who was grown vp to mās estate: by which deuise he compelled Artaxerxes to reuenge the murder of the king with murder of his brother. When they came to the lodging of Darius, they founde him, as if hee had

bene asleepe, and presently drawing forth their Weapons they fell vpon him and murthered him.
                  After Artabanus, perceiuing that yet for all this mischiefe, there remained one of the kings sonnes aliue, and fearing that the peeres of the Realme, would stand to him to place him in the kingdome: made one Baccabassus of his counsell, this man contenting himselfe with his present estate, vtteily disallowed those his treasons, and therevpon went and bewraied the whole plot The

                  Amongst the rest Artabanus also stoode out in compleat Armor, who when the king cspied, he fayned that his Curat was too short for him, and therefore commaunded Artabanus to change curats: Artabanus nothing mistrusting, did as he vvas commaunded, and as he vvas putting it off, he King taking him vpon aduantage, suddainely thrust him thorough with his svvord, and vvithall presently commaunded that all his sonnes should be apprehended, and kept in  prison, vvhile his displeasure vvas further satisfied. And so this worthy young Prince reuenged the death of his father, and the murder of his brother, as also freed himselfe from the treasons of Artabanus.
                  
                  While these broiles hapned amongst the Persians, in the meane time all Greece fell into ciuill dissention, diuiding it selfe the one part against the other A ciuill dissention among the Greekes. (whereof one part followed the Lacedemonians, and the other part followed the Athenians, turning the point of their vveapons into their ovvne bovvels. On the one side the Lacedemonians drevv vnto their part, all such forces as vvere before vvaged at the common charge of euery Cyttie, for the defence of the vvhole country: vvhile the Athenians vpon the other  side stood vpon their renovvne, not onely of their auncestry, as also of their ovvne famous exploits in mylitarie dissipline, and therefore vvere resolute, and stood onely to that strength, which they could well maintaine amongst themselues: Thus two of the mightiest people throughout all Greece, both of them also equall in the execution of the statutes of Solon, and the lawes of Lycurgus, through meere enuy at the good and flourishing estate one of the other, were swallowed vp through ciuill dissention.
                  As for Lycurgus he succeeded his brother Polibita in the kingdome of Sparta, 
                     Iastice to be preserred before a crown. and although he might very lawfully haue challenged the kingdome as his owne right, yet willingly he made surrender thereof, and with so great faithfulnes  vnto his Sonne Charilaus, (who was borne after the death of his father) assoone as cuer he grew vp vnto mans estate: to the intent that all men might see and vnderstand, how much more good men do esteeme of their faithfull dealing, then all the riches of the world beside: Also in the nonage of the child (of whome as protector he had the gouernement) he deuised Lawes and Statures to be put in due execution amongst the Spartans (who till

this time were altogether destitute) in which labour of his, he deserued euerlasting renowne, not onely in that hee prouided such lawes, as for the good example that he gaue for the preseruing and keeping of them: These were his lawes in effect.

He perswaded all estates and degrees to beware of gluttony, and to be sparing in their diet, for in his iudgement he thought that warre would be the better maintained, where the goods that they got by moderation, was also thriftily preserued and kept: he also ordaind that their might  be a generall buyeng and selling amongst men, but not for ready money but by exchanging of Wares, one with another.
                  The vse of Gold and Siluer (as the onely occasion of much mischiefe) he vtterly tooke away from amongst them. The gouernment of the commonweale, he destributed into certaine estates and degrees of men: He alowed vnto the king absolute power and authority in al matters concerning the warres: vnto the Magistrates, he allowed authority in Iudgements, and other courses in law. Amongst whom he ordained, that they should holde their places, but the terme of one yeare at the most. Vnto the Senators and Sages amongst the people it fell out to see these lawes put in execution, to the commons he gaue  power to elect and choose the Senatours, or to appoint what Officers they pleased to giue consent vnto. He caused their Landes to be denided to euery one part and part like, only to this entent and purpose, that euery man hauing alike, no man should account himselfe better then his neighbor.
                  He ordained that they should all eat and drink openly, to the intent no man shuld in secret vse any maner of excesse or superfluity: He permitted the yonger sort of men to weare but one garment in the year, neither one man to exceed another in apparell, nor one fare better then another, least by the euill example of one, it shuld entice and draw on others to the like ryot: Any child The bringing vp of children whatsoeuer, being vnder the age of fifteene years, was not suffred to come into  the Kings court, but straightly commanded to be kept vp in the Countrey, where they might daily behold nothing but extreme labor and trauaile, and by these examples might shun idlenes and know the want of good education: Also, when they slept, nothing was suffred to be laid vnder their heads to rest vpon, neither might they tast of dainty foode, nor returne into the Citty till they were growne to mans estate.
                  He also made a law that maidens should be maried without any dowry, and in that law ordained that men in choosing wiues, should professe loue onely, Mariage of maydens and not to marry as in these times for the loue onely of money, he thinking by this law to haue the bonds of Matrimony more firmly kept and obserued:  He ordained that greatest reuerence should be giuen (not to richmen, nor men in authority,) but vnto the aged, accounting them worthiest reuerence, Reuerence to the aged. for their many yeares: And to giue them their due, there is no one place in the world, where age is more honored, then amongst the Spartans.
                  
                  These lawes and precepts at the first seemed hard, heauy, and tedious, especially to such as in all their times before, were wont to line at liberty, therefore

the worst in three seueral battailes, brought the Lacedemonians to such a strait, that to supply their Armies, they were faine to make all their bondmen free, as also to make faithfull promises to them, that it should be lawfull for them to take the wiues of such as were slaine, not onely to supply their places to make vp the number, but to possesse all their estates and worships whatsoeuer.
                  The kings of the Lacedemonians feared belike that in striuing against Fortune, they might still come by the worst, and so indanger their Countrey and people the more, determined to haue conueyed home againe all their hoast of men, if Tyrteus had not at that instant come amongst them: who summoning all his Armies together, rehearsed before them certaine verses, that he  himselfe had composed and set togither, wherein he had contained, nothing but encoragements of warre, comforts for the loser, and pollicies and stratigems in seruice: by which he set all his Souldiers on such a fyer of courage, that taking more thought for their buriall, then their liues, euery man put vpon his right armea bracelet, whereupon he caused to be engraued his owne name, and also the name of his father, onely for this intent and purpose, that if it were his fortune to be slaine in the battell, and thereby might lie so long a boue ground that they coulde not be knowne by their visages, at least those bracelets, might make them to be regarded, that so they might yet at last haue humane buriall. 
                  
                  When the kings had taken knowledge of this their resolution, they caused The courage of the Messenians. their forwardnes to be sounded foorth into the eares of their enemies: which nothing astonied the Messenians, but rather increased their fury more violently: In which incounter they behaued themselues so couragiously on both parts, that it grew to be the bloudiest day that had bene heard of in many ages long before: yet as the longest Summers day hath his end, so had the furie of these violent broiles, and the Lacedemonians remained Conquerors.

                  The Athenians iudged hereof as a froward and churlish disgrace, and in the heat of their displeasure, fetched away all the chiefest treasure and mony that was laid vp and stored at Delos, by the whole power of Greece, for the maintenance of their warres against the Persyans, and brought it to Athens: fearing,  least if the Lacedemonians shoulde be the first that violated the league, they might haue seized thereupon, and made purchase and spoile thereof. This draue the Lacedemonians more and more out of quiet, for in that they were intangled in warres, against the Messenians, they waged the Penoponnesians to Eney ne

Ships iuto Egipt, and therefore being set vpon at sea, were soone discomfited and ouercome.
                  Within a while after their fleet ariued safe at home, being increased both in number of ships, and strength of men, whereupon hauing hartes burning with reuenge, they reunited againe the warres, and made head vpon the enemy: whereupon the Lacedemonians left the Messenians, and turned all their forces vpon the Athenians. Long helde the heate of the battaile, doubtfull to whether part the day would be assigned, and so indeed it fell foorth, for after many slaughters, gaping wounds, and maimed souldiers on both sides, they both remained equall victors of the day. Hereupon the Lacedemonians were still bound to maintaine the warres with the Messenians (and yet were loathe  that the Athenians should be ydle all the while) couenanted with the Thebans, to restore them backe, the kingdom of Beotia, (which before time were taken from them in the time of the Persian warres) vpon condition that they should continue warre with the Athenians: so mad and inraged were the Lacedemonians, that although they were now already ingaged into two seuerall warres, against two seuerall Nations, yet they sti

                  Wherevpon the Athenians, to pteuent mischances, and to withstand these boysterous tempests of warre, chose from among them two Captaines and Pericles a worthy man of warre. 
                      chiefe Lordes: the one called Pericles, (a man of tried vertue and experience) and Sophocles, who was onely a writer of tragedies: These two valiant commanders, had the charge of two Armies, who wasted the territores of the Spartanes exceedingly, and as they went along subdued many citties of Achaia to the Empire of Athens. Thus was the pride of the Lacedemonians cast downe, by these misfortunes, and in the end were forced to make a peace for thirty yeares: which notwithstanding, they still retained a priuate grudge against the Athenians, in so much that they made shipwrack of their league, before The Lacedemonians make a pease and breake it the terme of fifteen years were fully acomplished, and in dispite both of gods and men, inuaded the borders and territories of Athens: wherein, that they  might not be accounted to thirst after spoile only, they suddenly made them offer of battaile: The Athenians (by the counsell of their Captaine Pericles) delaied the reuenge for wasting of theyr Countrey vntill fitter opportunitie The discreet pollicy of Pericles. might giue aduantage to pay them home for their truce-breaking & accounted it but meere folly to trouble themselues any further at that time, considering that ere many daies were past, they might reuenge all their wrongs, with more profyt and aduantage, and lesse danger of losse vnto themselues.
                  Whervpon a little after they made a great preparation of men, money, & munition, and sodenly imbarking their forces, put forth to sea, or euer the Lacedemonians got knowledge of them, and suddenly arriuing vpon the borders  of Sparta, wasted all the Countrey before them, and carryed away with them farre more spoile, than made good foure fold the losse that they had before receiued of the enemy: Honourable was this voyage of Pericles, but a greater honor was it accounted for him, in that hee not onely vndertooke this dangerous seruice, but that he forsooke euen all the earthly possessions that he had about him onely to attempt revenge for his Countrymen the Athenians:
                     
although the Spartans before time had spoiled all other mens lands and liuings, yet they departed, not daring to touch one iot of that was called his, hoping thereby, either to bring slander and enuy vpon him amongst his Countreymen: or if the worst fell out (which they rather coueted) he might haue bene reputed amongst them as a Traitor: This did Pericles gather an insight into, and therefore made known vnto the inhabitants what would come to passe, and in the end to free himselfe out of al suspicion, he royally gaue al those lands and liuings to the good of the whole common-wealth, whereby the euill fortunes that they sought to throw vpon him to his high disgrace, by his prouident care and wise demeanor, became his euerlasting fame and renowne. 
                  
                  After this, there was another very fyerce fyght vpon the Sea, in which the Lacedemonians, were put to the worst, and betooke themselues to flight: and

Finally being ouertoyled and wearied out with so many mischiefes, following one in the necke of another, they againe desired that they might haue a peace concluded for fyfty yeares, which was accordingly agreed vpon, but long this lasted not; for before sixe yeares were fully ended, they againe reuolted: for the truce which they had taken in their owne names, they thought they might lawfully breake in regard

It is not greatly to be inaruailed at, that in former times, there went many fables of this place, into which there is conueied so many strange things to be seene. The rage of their narrow Seas. First, there is not any narrow sea in all the world so outragious as in this place, not so much for the violence and swift passage of the waues, as also the extreame meeting of the tides: so that it is not so terrible onely to those that trie  the same, but euen to the beholders herof, althogh they be a great way distant. Againe there is so horrible a noise when the waues thereof do meete, that men may easily discerne some as it were running away, cleane ouerwhelmed in the whirl-pooles, and other some in manner of conquerors, proudly bearing themselues aloft with victory.

Afterward, being in this voluntary exile, it came to his knowledge, that hee stood not onely as a condemned man, but also was accursed by all the priests which belonged to those ordinances of religion: he therefore secretly tooke Alcibiades taketh part against his Countrey. his way to Lacedemon, and by great perswasions mooued the king thereof to make vvarres vpon the Athenians, especially at that present, whilst they were now so sore vexed and disquieted with their ill successe they had receiued in

                  In the beginning of these Warres, euen those aides and asistances which they ought to haue receiued from their owne fellowes and associates, and in which they for the most part trusted and relyed, gaue them the slip, and in the time of most neede, vt

                      but as a greate Chiefetaine, and as a most puissante commaunder: For

first, he tooke along with him ten saile of shippes, and sailed into Asia; and being there safly ariued, by the authoritie both of his place and name, he compelled all such Citties as were at that time tributary vnto the Athenians, to turne all their succor and strength vnto the aide and furtherance of the Lacedemonians: for being well assured that he was a man of great power and commaund at home in his owne country, they therefore resolued that he could still be nothing lesse, although he remained as a banished person: Also they thoght not so basely of him, being thrown out from amongst the Athenians, as they esteemed and accounted him being receiued as a Captaine amongst the Lacedemonians: and in fine, they esteemed better of him in his new receiued  commaund amongst the Lacedemonians, then of his abiect forsaking amongst the Athenians.
                  
                  Thus when Alcibiades had fastned himselfe amongst the Lacedemonians, by reason of his forwardnes and stout valour, he raised vp vnto himselfe more enuy and hartburning on the one partie, then praise and thankes on the other: wherevpon the Princes by a generall consent, laide all the waite they could possible, how they might take away his life: either by treason to be falsified against him, or by any other extraordinare plot, to bring him to his end. This muttring and deuising amongst the princes came vnto the eare of Alcibiades (onely by the wife ol king Agis, with whom he had committed adultry)  and therefore secretly, and as suddenly as he could, he fled vnto Tissaphernes, King Darius his lieutenaunt, with whom by his courteous and lowly behauiour he in-linked himself in such great friendship (for he vvas novv in the pride of his yeares, and for beautie, personage, and eloquence, among all the Athenians vvas not one to be found, that might iustly be accounted his equall) he The description of alcibiades. vvas more ready to winne friendship, then hauing vvoon it, to keepe and preserue the same: because all his euill, vvas still masked vnder a faire, smooth, and deceitfull tongue, and shadowed and set out by the gift of excellent eloquence: he therefore so subtily and politickely wrought vvith Tyssaphernes, that he vvished and aduised by this his dissembling counsell, that Tissaphernes

                      should plucke backe and shorten the vvages, and allovvance of victuals, vvhich vvas appointed vnto the Lacedemonians, and also that the Ionians should be called vpon, and forced to beare a part of that great charge that had bene disburssed, and for whose libertie (when they paide tribute vnto the Athenians) these vvarres were first vndertaken.
                  Moreouer that the Lacedemonians ought not to receiue so much help as they had, considering that he prepared for another mans victory and not his owne, therefore ought in right to be maintained in such sort, that they might not breake off for want of things necessary: for as long as the Greekes were at His reasons vsed to perswade Tyssaphernes. debate amongst themselues, the king of Persia had the law in his owne hands,  to make either Warres, or peace, euen as he listed: and at last they might be ouerthrowne and ouercome with their strengthes and powers, whome by al the forces himfelfe could make, was not able to offer them the least measure of iniury: And assoone as the warre should end (which side soeuer got the conquest or victory) he should still bee compelled to maintaine warres

For the better performance wherof, each party was to be maintained in equall strength to match the aduersary: and the weaker was stil to be strengthned with fresh supplies, and new succours; for it coulde no way be thought that the Lacedemonians could long continue in rest, if once they got the vpper hand, considering that they had now already made open proclamation, that they only were the sole defenders of the safety & liberties of Greece.

                  These things comming thus to passe by the craft and subtlety of Alcibiades, he then began to worke a new plot for the good of his owne Countreymen the Athenians Wherupon shortly after was sent vnto him certaine Ambassadors from Athens, vnto whome he made this promise, to regaine vnto them the fauour and good liking of the king, if so be that the whole gouernement  of the Common-wealth, might be remoued from amongst the vulgar people, into the handes and iurisdiction of the Senators: hoping thereby also, that if the Citty agreed well, he himselfe should be chosen chiefe regent and commaunder os the warre, by the whole and general consent: or if at leastwise there shovld arise any dissention amongst them, or betweene the two estates, he shoulde be called to the aide and helpe of the one of them. This something troubled the Athenians, especially seeing the danger of warre that they were wrapped into, and therefore tooke more respect to their safety, then care of their honour, and with generall applause and good will of the people, the gouernment of the common-wealth was wholy committed into the hands of the Senators: when they had gotten all into their owne direction, (through a  naturall pride that lies engraffed in that high estate) they dealte exceeding cruelly wi

                  This his message troubled all the chiefe and great men of the Citty exceedingly,  insomuch that they attempted to betray the towne vnto the Lacedemonians, but perceiuing that they could not bring their purposes to passe, they voluntarily and vvillingly forsooke their Countrey, and vvere content to be accounted as banished persons. Thus vvhen Alcybiades had freed his country from homebred iarres, he furnished a fresh Nauy of ships, vvith all the hast he could possible, and directed all his forces against the Lacedemoni

In which conflict, the greater part of the armye (especially of their chosen men and Captaines) were put to the sword, and fourescore saile of the enemies shipps were also taken. After within a few daies, the Lacedemonians, remoued from the Sea to land, where they receiued a far more greater spoile then euer before: through which discomfiture, they were greatlie perplexed, and in time were forced to make a long and

                     edious sute that a peace might be concluded  betweene them: This petition was hindred by those who made gaine by the warre, and in the end could not be attained: In the meane season the Carthagynenses made warres in Sycylly, whereby the Syracusanes were forced to call home all their forces that were abroad to defend their owne territories; so that the Lacedemonians being vtterly bereft of al their aides & succors, Aleybiades with his victorious nauy, wasting and forraging al the coastes of Asya, was bid batel in many places where hee came, yet euery where he got the victory, and recouered backe againe all those Citties which before had reuolted; adding vnto his conquests some new places, which before time they neuer Albiciade; triumphantly receiued home. were possessed of; recouered all the ancient demaines of the Athenians, increased his renowne, both by Sea and land, and lastly returned home to Athens 
                      amongst his owne Cittizens in great ioy and triumph.
                  Amongst all these battailes and bickerings were taken and put to flight of the enemy, two hundred sayle of ships, besides a mighty great spoile: At the returne home of this triumphant Conqueror, all the people of the Citty came out by heapes, rendring aboundant of prayses euen vnto euery common soldier: but vpon Alcibiades they threw down a wonderment of welcoms, insomuch they were neuer satisfied enough with the sight of his person, but euen if it were possible

                     dored him as he had beene a God amongst them, or as if he had beene victory it selfe: Vpon this, they highly extolled and praised him, for the memorable and famous actes that he had done for the principall good  of his country, no lesse did they maintain & vphold those things he did against the same, in the time of his banishment; making excuse for him themselues, as that what he had done, proceeded forth of anger and impatience, as also that he was prouoked and vrged thereunto.
                  It is a wonder to behold, that in one man should appeare so many tokens of valour, as first to be the ouerthrow of so mighty a kingdome: next of the setting Albiciades se

revvards, and his cursings with blessings.
                  Now was no more whisperings amongst them of the battels, that he lost at Sicilly, but all places were filled with his victories gotten in Greece: there was no speeches what ships he had lost, but euery one could tell what ships he had taken from the enimies: now were the Syracusans clean forgotten and cast out of memory, and no other triumphes but of his conquests, throughout all Ionia and Hellespont. And thus in these extreames passed he his whole course of life amongst his Countrymen, either meanly and basely abiccted and thrown downe; hated, or else highly honoured; admired, and in manner worshipped as a God amongst them.
                  During the time these triumphes had their courses, there was one Lysander made Captaine generall amongst the Lacedemonians, both at Lande and Lylandet made captaine ge

their stoutest and strongest men were lost in the forraging of Asya: at last what with old men, on the one side, and beardles boyes on the other, they silled vp againe the number of Souldiers, though it were a very little strength vnto the hoast, neither feared they to encounter with their enemies, although like weake and vnskilfull souldiers, they were euery where beaten downe, or else forced to betake themselues vnto their heeles: Amongst whom there befell so great a desolation (what of them that were slaine, and them that were Great slaughter amongst the Atheniās taken) that not onely the Empire, but euen the very name of the Athenians, seemed in a manner to be extinct and cleane worne out of memory.
                  By this ouerthrow, they were brought vnto so low an estate, and were so  neerely pillaged, by reason that their men that were seruic cable for the warres, were so extreamely wasted and spent, that they were forced to deuise and let out their Citty vnto strangers; to set their bond men at liberty; to giue pardon to all such as were condemned by the law to die: And so by such meanes gathering togither a rout of rascall out-casts, wher with their armi

                     s were filled vp, (they which but euen now were Lords and principall commaunders of all Greece) were now scarcely able to vphold and maintaine their own liberties.
                  All this not withstanding, they still retained proud harts within them, and as it were scorned the vtmost frowne of fortune: in so much that they resolued once more to venture all at one chance, and set all their fortunes vpon one hazzard by Sea: and where as but euen a little before, they were in vtter despaire  
                     The Atheniaus resolute. of keeping their owne in safety, they now plunged themselues into a vaine hope that they should get the victory: But it lay not in the povver of souldiers to vphold the honour of Athens, neither vvas it that povver vvherevvith they vvere vvontto giue the ouerthrovv vnto their enemies (and as for their late company of rascality vvho neuer spent their time in practise of military discipline, but vvasted most part of their daics in prison and not in the campe,) vvherefore vvhat through their pride on the one side, and their vvant of men of corage and tryed experience on the other side, they vvere all either slaine, by the svvord, or taken prisoners: As for Conon their Captaine, he all alone made a fearefull slight out of the battaile, and fearing the cruelty of his ovvne  Countrymen, took along with him eight saile of ships; taking his direct course Conon slyeth, with certaine ships in to Cyprus. to Euagor as the king of Cyprus.
                  
                  Thus the Captaine of the Lacedemonians hauing gotten a prosperous victory, proudly insulted ouer the great aduersity that his enemies were fallen into: and in great pomp and triumphs sent al such shipping and other spoiles as he had gotten home to Lacedemon, and made a composition vpon certaine Articles, with all those Citties that were tributary vnto the Athenians, and as yet continued their obedience, because they were not fully resolued to what issue the warres would come leauing not any thing vnder the possession of the  
                     Athenians, saue onely their bare citty.
                  When these ill tidings began to be spred at Athens, all the inhabitants, as people amazed forsooke their houses, running vp and downe the citty, demaunding of one another what newes abroad, diligently making searche for him that brought the first report hereof: I say none (from the infant to the old man) had the power to keepe within their ovvne houses, the very extreamity

of griefe, did so oppresse and trouble them: but neither children, who want discretion, nor old men, who want strength, nor the women, who are weake by nature, but they altogether pertake in this their sadde and hopelesse desolation.
                  Moreouer they made many meetings in the common market places, and there would spend whole nights in reuiuing their common misfortunes with wofull mourninges. Some bewailed the losse of brethren, some the want of The horror of desolation sonnes, some the lacke offathers, some the misfortune of kindred, other some for those that were neerest vnto them, and generally all bewailed their common misfortunes: now was nothing to be expected but shipwracke both of themselues and Countrey, accounting those that were aliue in farre worse  case then those that were departed. Now coulde they fixe the eyes of their minds vpon nothing but terrour; as hunger, besiedgment, and what was worst that they were vnder the hands of their enemies, whoe might worke his pleasure vpon them: This also brought into their remembrance the ouerthrowe and burning of their Citty, the captiuity of their bodies, and the most miserable slauery that was fallen vpon them: accounting the first ouerthrow of their Citty by the Persians an happye chance vnto them, in comparison of this, in the which they had their wiues, children, parentes, and kinsfolkes remaining still in safety, neither lost they any thing saue onely their houses: but now on  the contrary, they were quite dispoiled of all manner succor and refuge, not hauing left them so much as one ship to fly vnto for succour, as before they might haue done, and by whose helpes they might haue bene the better defended, vntill they had bene able to haue newly reedified and builded vp again their Citty.
                  Whilst they were thus in the middest of their mournings and Lamentes, Athens again besieged their enemies came vpon them, and so sharpely begirte them on euery side by besiedging them, that they constrained them to abide much hunger, for want of victuals: for they knew well inough that ther was no great number of souldiers left aliue within the towne, and without they so beleagred and stopped  all the passages, that it was not possible for them to receiue or looke for any helpe or fresh succors to come vnto them: By all which inconueniences ioyned togither, the Athenians were brought into so great extreamitie, partly by famine, and partly by the pestilence, that they desired peace.
                  Hereupon grew a long debating betweene the Lacedemonians, and other their adherents, whether it were necessary to be granted or no: At last they came vnto diuers censures vppon the matter; where some were of opinion, and thereunto aduised that the name of the Athenians should be vtterly rooted out, and burne the Citty downe to the ground: but hereunto the Spartans would in no wise condiscend and agree, seeing that the Greeks hauing but only  two eies, one of them shoulde be put out: So that in conclusion they granted them a peace vpon these condition. First that they should cast downe all the Peace granted the Athe nians vpon condition. Armes of those vvalles, that stretched themselues tovvards the hauen of Pireum. Secondly, that they should deliuer vp al their ships and shipping that they had yet left. Thirdly, that they should receiue from them xxx. Rulers to gouerne and guide their commonvvealth.
                  
                     
Vpon these Articles the Citty was yeelded vp vnto the Lacedemonians, who committed the whole course and managing thereof vnto the discretion of Lysander. In this yeare fell out many things that are worthy to be committed to lasting memory: as first the vtter subuersion of Athens, next the death of I

But being not satisfied nor yet contented, fearing that their band of men were yet too weake to keepe and maintaine their citty in an awfull and slauish feare, they borrowed seuen or eight hundred Souldiers out of the Conquerours campe.
                  Hauing thus strengthned themselues, they began to make slaughter vppon the Cittizens of Athens, beginning first of all vvith Alcibiades, putting him first to death, least vnder pretence of restoring them againe toliberty, he might inuade the common-wealth: For it was secretly come vnto  their care, that he vvas making out tovvarde Artaxerxes, King of, Persia, (vvherefore they sent out certaine poastes after him, to cut him off in the midst of his iourney, if any vvay could be found: at last it vvas their happe to ouertake him, but seeing they could not easily put him openly to death, they set fire on the chamber vvherein he lay, and so in the dead of his sleepe burnt him quicke. Alcibiades burnt in his bed.

                     ained the victory, and not rather stand vnto me and helpe me as one who seeke the defence of you all: vvherevvith he bad them also call vnto their remembrance, that all those souldiers vvhich vvere vnder his conduct, vvere of their ovvne Cittizens, and not enimies: as also that he had not taken vveapons in hand, to the intent anie vvaie to vvrong them, or to take anie thinge from them, but onelie to restore vnto them all such things as had by violence bene pulled from them by others; assuring them vppon his honor, that the  vvarre vvhich he had vndergone, was wholy against the thirty tyrants, and in no case against the Citty.
                  Againe, I intreat you to call to your remembrances the kindreds, the lawes, the rights and ceremonies, that had bene in common amongst them. as also the true fellowship that had bene among them, in so many battailes in times past, all which things being wel considered of you, I pray and humbly beseech

you to haue pittie vpon your poore banished Countreymen: and if you your selues can be so hardy and resolute to beare this vnsufferable yoke of bondage with patience, I beseech you to restore vnto vs yet our country, and I wil be the meanes to set you all at free liberty againe.
                  By this his long and perswasiue Oratory vnto them, he so wrought with them, that when they had gotten all their whole power into the cittie, they compelled the thirty Tyrants out to Eleusis, and in their places they elected The Tyrants banished out of Athens. only ten out of their ovvne choyse, vvho should gouern and rule the vvhole Common-wealth: these being thus seated in the authority of their predecessors, fell into the same cruelty that the former had put in practise. 
                  
                  These things being this come about, tydings was brought to Lacedemon that the Athenians were very sharp set vpon warres: which to the intent they might represse and keep vnder, they sent vnto their king (named Pausanias) who taking great compassion of the banished people, restored all these poore decayed Cittizens home vnto their owne Country againe, violently throwing out those other last ten Tyrants out of their Cittye: forcing them to the former place called Eleusis, amongst the rest of their assocyats.
                  By these meanes they began in some good measure to settle themselues in peace, but yet within some short time after, these Tyrants (disdaining the restitution of the banished Cittizens, as they repind at their owne downfal, euen as though other mens liberty had beene their bondage) made warres vpon the  
                     Athenians: But when they came forth to parley, demaunding their former rule & soueraigntie again, they were by pollicy sodenly taken, and slaine as a sacrifice of peace: then were the people, which they had expelled out of the Citty, Tyrany iustly punished. called in again, and the cittizens which by this meanes were distracted diuersly, was now at length brought into one body againe. And to the intent no dissention might grow about things past, they tooke euery man his corporall oath, to bury vnder foote whatsoeuer grudgings had risen vp amongst them. The athenians againe restored.
                  
                  Presently after, the Thebanes and Corinthians sent Ambassadors vnto the Lacedemonians, making demaund of their shares of all such spoiles and preies,  as had beene taken in the former warres; as well that they might haue part, in the boote, as to beare out their owne charge and danger: but the Lacedemonians returned backe vnto them a flat deniall of these their demands, wherevpon they presently proclaymed open warres against them: but they did not presently prosecute the same warre, but onely bare vnto them a spightfull grudge in their harts, and would burst forth into action at some other time, when least they were suspected.

But Cyrus thought his father wronged him exceedingly in his bequest, wherefore he very priuily prepared and made warre against his brother. Artaxerxes hauing knowledge hereof, sent for him, and not regarding his counterfaite pretence of innocency, as that he purposed no such matter against him, bound him in fetters of gold, and was also fully determined to haue put him to death, had not his mother

hindred him. Cyrus therefore being thus set at liberty, did not as before make warre in secrecye but openly, not nowe by dissembled shewes, but open defiance; so that he gathered vnto him much aide and assistance. Amongst the rest the Lacedemonians calling to remembrance, that by his meanes they wer greatly strengthned in their warres against the Athenians, (like ignorant men, not knowing against whom this warre was intended) determined to send all the aide they could make vnto Cyrus vpon any small warning giuen, seeking both for thanks at the hands of Cyrus, and pardon from Artaxerxes, if his should chance to be the victory: pleading for their better excuse, that what they had attempted was not meant against him openly. But being in battell,  such was the euill chance, that the two brothers met together, and in the encounter Artaxerxes was wounded very sore by the hands of Cyrus, but by the swiftnesse of his horse he was deliuered from death, but his brother Cyrus was Warres betwixt Cyrus and Artaxerxes. ouercome by the kings guard, and presently put to death: So that Artaxerxes got the victory and spoile ouer his brothers warre, and his army also. In this battell were ten thousand Greekes that came to the aide of Cyrus, who in that wing where they were placed got the vpper hand, and after the death of Cyrus could neither be ouercome by so great an host of men, nor yet be intrapped by pollicy: But in their returne homward, they defended themselues Cyrus slaine. manfully, (though they passed by many nations, and also had  a tedious iourney) yet at last they safely attained vnto the borders of their owne Countrey.

concluded vvithin himselfe that Tissaphernes vvas the fittest and vvorthiest person to make peace vnto, being a man both of greater experience, and farre more couragious and actiue in military discipline then the other, as also that he vvas better furnished vvith companies of souldiers, for he had all those forces vvhich sometime belonged to King Cyprus.
                  
                  Some short time after upon occasions they met togither, vvhere after much communication had betvveen them, it vvas agreed uppon certaine conditions, that Tissaphernes should not meddle nor be seene to aduise any thing at that time in these vvarres.

Also hee vrged further, that it was an euill president, that the vaarre should hang, and not go thorough, but lingered still along, as if the enemy vvere vvell bribed vvith money, vvhen as indeed it vvere meet, to make them fly by force of Armes.
                  When he had done this complaint and brought Tissaphernes into high displeasure vvith the King, he gaue him counsell to remoue him from being high Admiral of the seas, & in his place to cal home Conon of Athens, (vvho  had liued as an exile euer since the conquest of his country) and make him admirall. For although the Athenians vvere berest of povver and riches, yet their experience in Nauigation, remained vvithin them vncontrolled: Moreouer if a man should search neuer so secretly amongst them al, there vvas none to be found, for that place, more fit then Conon.
                  
                  Hereupon Pharnabazus hath deliuered vnto him fiue hundred talentes of siluer, vvith full commission to make Conon high admirall of the Kinges fleet. But vvhen the Lacedemonians had gotten intelligence hereof, they sent Conon made Admirall of the Persyan Fleet. presently Ambassadors vnto the King of Egipt, desiring him to send Hercimonius, 
                      with a sufficient Nauy of ships to aid them against their enemies: Vpon which their demaund, he sent them as hastily as they coulde, a hundred Gallies, and fiue hundred quarters of corne, and other Nations their vvel-wishers, sent them mighty succor. But novv to this great army, there vvanted a vvorthy leader: vvherfore those that were in the bands of frendship vvith the Lacedemonians; requested that they might obtain as their generall Agesilaus (and at that time king of the Lacedemonians.) Heere-about the Lacedemonians, demurred vpon the matter a long space, vvhether they might make him generall or not, by reason of the Oracle at Delphos, which was, that that Empire should suddainely ende, when it was seene, that the  Royall estate halted (for indeed Agesilaus was lame in one of his feet.) At length they resolued, it were better their King to halt in his going, them the kingdome halt for want of a sufficient Gouernor.

                  In the meane time (fearing the vvorst) Lysander vvhome Agesilaus appointed his Vize-gerent the time of his absence, assembled a great Nauy of ships, and furnished them vvith all the povver they vvere able to make, purposing if occasion offered it self to try their fortunes by dint of svvord, rather then to yeeld to the proudest enemy vnder the Sunne.

was as carefull for the Persyans, as for his owne Countrey. For like as it fared with the Athenians, when thy were vtterly discomfited, he was one of the only men that sought the ouerthrow of their Dominion: so on the contrary, it was his whole desire, to recouer it againe, and now at last to set vp againe his country by the victory which he before had lost being ouercome: the which thing being brought about, would redound much more to his honor, for that he had not now vnder his command the Athenians his own Countrymen, but the whole power and strength of a forren Prince, so that by this meanes all the perill, daunger, and losse, should be the Kings, and the gaine of victory shold be only for the good of his countrey: and the honor which would light vpon him, woulde be in farre greater measure then many other valiant Captaines  which had stood for the defence of their countrey, many yeeres before time: for whereas they defended their country, by ouercomming the Persians, hee should set her vp in her former estate, by making the Persians conquerors.
                  On the other side Lysander, in that he was of neer kin to Agesilaus, was also an earnest immitater of his vertues, framing himselfe by all meanes possible, The worthy praise of Lysander. not any way to swarue from his Noble and woorthy examples, nor from his shining renown and glory that the world did cast vpon him: but that he would haue so watchfull an eie ouer his proceedings, that the Empire which was so long a getting, in so many battailes, might not come to wracke, thorogh his  default, in the turning of a hand. This draue not onely the souldiers, but the kings also, into a vile perplexity, for that they douted the losing of their welth, and feared least the Athenians should recouer againe the soueraignty: But the fiercer the battell grewe, the more glorious appeared the victorie on Conons part. For the Lacedemonians were put vnto the vvorst, and fled, and many of their garrisons were led away to Athens. Thus were the people once againe restored to their former estate, and many of their citties also were recouered backe againe vnto their Empire. This was a full victorie vnto the Athenians, and to the Lacedemonians an end of the freedome that they had long retained: and now seeing that with their kingdome they had lost the greatest part of their valour also, their neigbors on euery side, held them base, and prouoked them  in great disdaine. Amongst the rest the Thebanes, (with the helpe of the Athenians) raised Warres vppon them: the which citty being mightily increased Disdam, hād

At last they espieng th Arcadians were gone from home, they surprised one of their Castles, turning out their men, and planted in their places a garrison of their ovvne. Heere began againe fresh broiles: for the Arcadians, hauing the aide of the Thebanes challenged their losses againe by the svvord: In this conflict Archiadanus captaine of the Lacedemonians was sore vvounded who perceiuing that his men vvere ouerpressed and beaten dovvne, as being ouercome, sent vnto the enemy an Herauld, demaunding the dead bodies of all his men that vvere slaine, and that he might by order & law of  Armes be suffred to bury them.
                  For amongst the Greekes, it is an vndoubted token of victory in yeelding themselues, wherewith the Thebanes sounded a retreat, and left following anie further in the pursuite of them. Afterwards within some small time, when euery man seemed to rest so well satisfied euen as if a truce had beene taken betweene them: and all displeasure quietly put vp in silence without any further mistrust on either part: the Lacedemonians being imployed on other scruices abroad amongst the Nations, the Thebanes contrary to all expectation, vnder the leading of a valiant captaine (called Epaminondas,) began a new plot of cunning, purposing to win away their citty, and to set vpon them at vnwares.  And to effect this their diuelish deuise, they tooke the beginning of the night to set forward in towardes Lacedemon, as closely and as secretlye as could anie waie bee deuised: but they receiued as foule a repulse, as their intention was treacherous. For the old men of the cittie, and other impotent people (as were most vnable,) hauing true intelligence of the approache of the enemie, put themselues in armes, met them at the entrance of the Gates, and althogh their number was exceeding small (not much aboue one hundred, old, lame, and forevvorne men) put themselues vppon the encounter, against fifteene thousand Souldiers: So vndaunted was their courage, and strength, that rather The couragi ou

In this battell there were two of the most valiantest of their Captaines slaine with the sword: meane space word was brought that Agesilaus was very neere at hand, which stroke such a dampe amongst the Thebanes, that they suddenly retired, and made away as fast as they were able: but yet it ended not in this manner, but within a little space after, there was a new encounter againe. For the younger sort of men amongst the Lacedemonians, being informed of the valarous courage and demeanor of the old men, their rage could no way be restrayned, but they would haue a new tryall made in open field, although they were already fully perswaded that the victory would fall vpon the heades of the Thebanes. 
                     
                  
                  In this conflict Epaminondas, (who bare himselfe valiantly, not onely as he Epaminondas daungerously wounded. was Captaine, but both captaine and souldier) receiued his deaths wound: At the report whereof the one part was so surprysed with feare, and the other part so amazed in ioy, as both of them (as they had beene new combyned friends) departed the fieldes, without any further strokes. Some few daies after Epaminondas departed, and with his death began the whole wracke of the common-wealth: for euen as it fareth with one, who hauing a weapon bateth and taketh away the edge therof, wherby that is left is able to do litle harme: euen so fareth it with this common-wealth, who hauing lost so good a Duke, who was the very edge of the common-wealth of Thebes, the force of which The

For during the term of his daies they atchieued many worthy victories, but his life being taken avvay, robbed them likevvise of their former happinesse, and turned all cleane contrary against them to the vtter spoile and ruine of their liues.
                  All vvhich aftervvard vvas made euident to every eie, that the glory and renovvne of the vvhole Countrey began with him, and at his end dyed also with him. Also he bare himselfe euery way so worthy a states-man, that it was hard for a man to iudge whether he deserued more praise for valour, or exact  gouernment in life. For before all thinges whatsoeuer, he sought the preseruation and defence of his Countrey, and not his owne priuate glory: money and treasure he esteemed nothing worth, Insomuch that all the store he had, was not of sufficient value to bring him to the graue: And euen as he esteemd money, so did he hold the praises of men not worthy the consideration. As for promotions he sought to shunne them, but that contrary to his desire, they were alwaies throwne vpon him against his will: In his places of authoritye, he behaued himselfe so grauely, wisely and bountyfully, that he seemed rather a grace to honor, then honor grace to him. 
                  
                  In learning, he farre surpassed many, who thought themselues his superior, and therein was so studious, that he was able to giue instruction, in the knowledge of Phylosophy, and which vvas more to be admired in him, that a man so borne and bred vp altogither in Schooles, should yet in the end proue so excellent a vvarriour.

neither did his death disagree with the former course of his life: for being by a violent blow, stricken to the ground, he was taken vp and brought into his Tent, (being halfe dead) anon when he was againe somthing reuiued, and withall recouered his speech, he looked round about vpon all his attendants, & seeing them al there, the first question that he demanded was, whether his enemies had taken and seased vpon his shield when they felled him. They who were neerest vnto his person, answered him no, his shield was safe. Then The wordes of Epaminō

Then he demaunded further, whether part had gotten the glory of the fielde: so  when answer was giuen, that the Thebanes remained conquerors: then (sayd he) al is well: So ast were in reioycing maner for the safety of his country, he laid him downe againe, and so departed. His death.
                  
                  This man thus remoued by death, here also ended the prowesse and valour of the Athenians: for after that time, he being gon, whose footesteps and dyrections they euer followed, they gaue themselues ouer to slothfull Idlenesse, spent and consumed all their reuenues vainely, (not vpon ships, and men of warre, as informer times) but in feastings, in Hollidayes, in making preparation for Pageants, plaies, and other idle pastimes; assembling themselues in great multitudes in Theaters, to behold their famous stage-playes and Poets;  and among them were more freequent, then in the campe: Then set they all their delights on Rymers, and Oratours, and in the meane time little or nothing respected either Captaines or Souldiers. Then the common treasure wherewith men of warre and mariners was accustomably relieued and maintained, began to be scatred and diuided amongst the people in the Cityes. These disorders being thus rooted amongst them, it cam to passe that whiles the Greekes gaue ouer themselues to all sensuallitye, the name of the Macedones, which euer before was held most vile and contemptible sprung vp, and grew to honor amongst them: and that Phillip, (who had beene three yeares in hostage in the Cittie of Thebes) being growne vp to great knowledge in millitary  affairies, (by the fauors of Epaminondas and the Pelopidanes) laid the kingdome of Macedonie like a heauy yoke of bondage vpon the neckes, both of Greece and Asya, bringing them and their posterity into an euerlasting subuersion.

                  Thus Argeus hauing gouerned this kingdome, with vpright Iudgement, and much loue of the people, left this world: after whose death, his sonne Phillip swaied the Crowne and Septer by lawfull succession; but Phillip also had not long supplied the state and dignity of a king, but sudden death surprised him, whereby the Crown descended vpon his heire, (named Europe) being then a very babe.

Wherefore the encounter being siercely maintained on both parts, atlast the Illirians receiued the soile, with much slaughter, (as if the Macedons in all their former battailes wanted neither manhood, nor courage, but a king onely.) After  the decease of Europe, Aminthas was next in succession, he was a right renowned Prince, both for the prowesse and manly resolution of him himselfe as also the singular forwardnesse of his sonne Alexander, whom nature had sorichly bedect in ful perfection of all vertuous Ornaments, that euen in al the games and pastimes of Olimpas, he bare away the prize, from all that opposed themselues against him.

These Ambassadors were very royally entertained and feasted by Amintas: At the last being fully gorged with full carouses, their onely sute and request was, that inasmuch as he had made them so sumptuoas a feast, and snewed vnto them such store of royall entertainment, so he would also graunt vnto them likewise the rights that iustly follow and belong to that kindnesse they had  already receiued: (Viz: that their sonnes, wines, and Daughters, might haue free accesse to keepe them company (for this was euer helde amongst the Persians, as a sure token and pledge of hospitality,) which being graunted, they entered the place, at whose approach, the Persians began to fall to wanton dalliance, in greater measure then was to be indured. Whereupon Alexander the sonne of Aminthas, desired his father in respect of his age and grauity) to withdraw himselfe from the banquet, promising that he woulde quickely asswage this vnciuill carriage of his guests wantonnesse.

                  Shortly after the departure of Bubares from Macedon, Amintas deceased, who left behinde him Alexander as his sonne and lawful successor. Moreouer the mariage and affinity of Bubares into the Persian race, brought therewith such aboundance of peace, that throughout all the daies of Darius it had full scope and passage, without any manner interruption: and after him it also purchased the generall fauour and good liking of Xerxes, who was after lawfully seated in that kingdome: Insomuch as when he made an inuasion into  
                     Greece (being mightily incensed and intaged against the same) he gaue vnto him all the royalty of the whole Countries, that lay open towards the mountaines of Olympus and Hemus: notwithstanding all which guifts and graces, he enlarged his kingdome more and more by his owne fortunes, as well as by the liberall hand of the Persians.
                  
                  Afterward, by order of succession, the kingdome of Macedon discended to Amyntas, who was sonne vnto his brother Menelaus. This man was held in high regarde, for his manly prowesse, and all the exercises of military dissipline. Amyntas the second He tooke to wife Eurydice, on whose body he begat three worthy Sonnes, the first Alexander, the second Perdycas, the third and last was Phillip (the father of Alexander the great) and one onely daughter (named Euryone.) 
                      This wife deceased, he hadde a second mariage to one Cygea, of whose body he also had yssue Archelaus, Arydens and Menalius: This king was much encombred by maintaning warres euery way: first with the Illyrians, and after with the Olinthyans.
                  
                  Also he was oft in danger of his life, by the plots and treasons of his wife Eurydice (who practising and attempting all the wayes she could to enioy her wanton desires with her Sonne in law, left no way vnattempted to shorten The treason of Eur

At last, iudgement was executed (not according to Iustice) but the pleasures of the Conquerors, and the conquered condemned in so great sums of money, as by their weakned estate was held impossible to be paide.
                  The Phocenses therefore, seeing cruelty chast them as fierce as lightning, and knowing they shoulde be bereft of their Landes, Wiues, and Children, and compelled to slauerie, if their imposition were vnsatisfied, chose rather a present deathe, then a perpetuall mischiefe: and foorthwith elected for their Captaine one Philomelus, vnder whose conducte, they offered their liues by speedy warre, to free theyr bodies from this  subiection: which hee accepting, they presently as men offended euen The Phocen ces rob the Temple of Apollo. with the Goddes themselues, gathered their faction to a head, and ransackt the temple of Apollo at Delphos.
                  
                  From thence inriched with that treasure they coulde make, they strengthned their army with straunger-souldiers, and with such forces they made Warre vppon the Thebanes. This deede of the Phocenses, although all men abhorred, beeing so fowle a facte as Sacriledge, yet in reguarde they were driuen to it by extremitye, it ingendred a more deadely hate in the heartes of the neighbour prouinces, towarde the Thebanes then to them. The Athenians therefore with the Lacedemonians took politick  aduise, and concluded to muster forces and dispatch them in their aid, as well, or rather to saue themselues from a future danger, as to be at league in their defence.
                  Both Armies being met, and arraide for Battell, at the first encounter Philomelu

But while he was more forward in this chase, then wise; more rash, then valiant, and more certaine of victory then behoued, he was run so farre into the Thebanes danger, that no reliefe had power to succor him, & by those enemies whom his rash conceit held conquered he was slain, and his life made  worthily a sacrifice for committing sacriledge.
                  In his place Ornomarchus was selected Captaine, against whome the Thebanes and men of Thessaly, chose for their generall, not an experienced souldior of their owne Nation, doubting least if he should be victor, hee woulde beare himselfe too Lordly ouer them; but vnto Phillip King of Macedon they would willingly submit not only themselues and forces, to becom subiectes

Then to abolish the shamefull reportes that were spred of his tirranies, he sent vnto the kingdomes and wealthy Citties, certaine people to raise a tumour, and busie the heads of the multitude, that he would royally extende a masse of treasure to the building of the walles about their Citties, to the reedifying of churches, and honoring their Temples: For which (as if he would be expeditious in this good) the M

In this warre, and for this occasion, he sent and subverted this auncient and noble citty, executed his brothers, according as in the counsel of his hart, his thoughts had decreed, inioying thereby a great prey of treasure, and  satisfying his thirst with their innocent bloud; vpon this, accounting whatsoeuer he determined, lawfull; and whatsoeuer he purposed, effected: he seised on the Golde mines in Thessaly, and on the siluer mines in Thrace. And that neither law nor right should be by him vnviolate, he furnished himselfe to be a rover on the sea.
                  While these things were ordred by Phillip, there were two brothers, (both kings of Thrace) at ciuill variance between themselues; in which continuance Tvvo brothers str

The griefe encreased by the concealement thereof, so much the deeper persing the hart as it had lesse liberty to vtter it selfe. Sometimes they considered the sepulchres and ancient monuments of their ancestors raked in the dust: sometimes their old houshould Goddes, to which many posterities had giuen their deuotion, now broken to peeces: sometime remembred the houses where they were begotten, and hadde increased children themselues, now possest by strangers and their enimies. Bewailing in one another the oppressefull estate wherein themselues liued, cursing themselues for their  sake, that it had not bene their blessednesse to haue bene borne after that desolate time. Some of this people he placed in the vtmost boundes of his kingdome, euen in his enemies mouthos; some, whom he perceiued fit for warres to garrisons, in his armye: some in one climate, some in another: And so of seuerall people, and seueral nations, he made one entire Empire, and one setled people.
                  Thus the affaires of Macedon being at a stay, continuing his former practise and policy, he tooke the chiefe coasts of the Dardamans, forraged their borders, and subdued their countries, not beeing mercifull to his own kindred: for in this hauocke he determined to put Arimba king of Epirus, and  kinsman to his wife Olimpias from his royalty, & thereupon sent for Alexander brother to Olimpias his wife, a youth of excellent beautie, in his sisters Phillip abuseth his wiu

Thus dealt he not like a kinsman with neither: the one he remoued contrary to conscience, the other he made a Harlot, before he made him King.

                        PHillip hauing with fortunate successe led his forces thus farre into Greece, debated with himselfe though not before hee pretended, yet before hee vndertooke anye further enterprise, whether the riches and spoile of those  Citties and lesser townes which he had already sacked and subuerted, would be sufficient treasure for him, whereby to conclude a conquest of all Greece, according to his determination, as he had already done of part: for the furtherance of this counsell, he thought it would be a profitable aduantage Philip besiegeth Constā

                  This Citty was first built by Pausanias king of Sparta, and by him possessed the continuance of seauen yeares. Afterward the Lacedemonians and Athenians surfetting with their owne prosperity, grew into priuate faction, from thence to publike and domesticke warre: so that as victory enclined itselfe

to either part, sometime it belonged to the one, and sometime to the other, which vncertaine possession, hauing too often fed on the miseries which by such mutations citties indure, made it now stand stifly in the defence of hir own libertie, and the rather, for that during this siedge wherwith Phillip had begirte them, neither the Lacedemonians, or Athenians, rescued it as their owne.
                  
                     Phillip hauing heere spent the most of his treasure, in the hope he had to make this citty his dignity, and finding by the delay of this warre, the cittizens grew rather hardie then deliberate, purposed by roauing on the sea, to inforce treasure, wherewith to keepe his siedge setled, without which his  necessity was such he should be compeld dishonorably to rise, and against his nature to desist: thus he so farre contriued, that he tooke 170. shippes laden with marchandise, wherewith he refreshed his greedy necessity for a season; at last, considering it was little policy or rather lesse profit, so great an army should be detained and excercised aboute the siedge of one onely citty, he caused to be drawne out a number ofhis experienced souldiers, ouer whom himselfe hauing taken aduised muster, he marcht with them in person and tooke many cities of the Chersonesus. At this time he sent for his sonne Alexander, of the age of eighteene yeares, to the intent he might see him traded in the discipline of warre vnder him, holding it a Maxime, that  a Soueraigne fathers life, should be a table ofhonorable presidents for his Princely sonne.
                  He made an inrode also into Scithia, to fetch booty and spoile from thence, entending after the custome of Marchants, to beare out the charge of one Phillp invadeth the Tar tarians. warre with the gaine of another. At the same instant, was Matthey King of the Scithians, who being ouercharged with the warres of the Istrians, sente the Apollonians in his behalfe, to sollicit the aide of Phillip, promisinge for such succor and assistance, to adopt him king of Scithia.
                  
                  
                     Phillip ambitious after rule, tooke little aduice of this request, but presently according to the contentes of this treaty, leauied his forces as hee  thought requisite, and dispatcht them in the defence of Matthey. But the K. of the Istrianes deceasing, while these affaires were in furtherance, his death deliuered the Scithians, both from occasion ofbattel, & from cause of helpe. Matthey being now like foules, that feare the snares no longer then they are fettered, vppon the arriuall of the Macedons, reguardlesse of Phillips fauour, commaunded them home againe, willing them to deliuer this message to their maister; that he neither requested him for succour, nor yet gaue the Apollonians in commission to adopt him: That the Scithians had no need of rescue from the Macedones, and pronounced themselues better men then The ingratitude of the Scythian K the Macedones: and for himselfe to desire a forren helpe to succeed him, it  needed not, since he had a generation ofhimselfe, a posterity ofhis owne, a sonne in perfect health, to make his seate after him happy.
                  This message thus deliuered to Phillip, he foorthwith sent Ambassadors to king Matthey, requiring him ofhis helpe toward the charge ofhis siedge, least he should be constrained by pouerty to break vp his campe: to which request Phillip vrged he should of reason so much the vnwillinger condiscend,

brunt of the warre (like as when ones neighbors house is on fire) fell vppon them, tooke part with the Athenians, so that by these means there was a legue contracted betweene these two Citties, which before were at so mercilesse a contention.
                  This coniunction knit between them, they sent ambassadors to al the prouinces of Greece, importuning their speedy asistance; inferring, so common an enemy as Phillip ought to be remooued by the generall forces of all the Countrey, and withall, making it perspicuous by demonstration, that if he had fortunat yssue in this, his conclusion would be the vtter subuersion of al Greece. Some moued with these reasons, ioyned themselues to the Athenians, 
                      others terrified with the bruite of his renowne, tooke part with Phillip. The day came wherein these two Armyes assayled each other, though the multitude of the Athenians exceeded the Macedons, yet sell it out to them as The Athenians vanquished. before to the Scithians, and Philip hauing this daies honour, finished it with the slaughter of them all; yet died they not vnmindfull of their ancient glorie: for looke in what place euery man had charge vnder his captaine to be kept, that place he as worthily made good againe, that when thorough the daunger of his woundes he was forced to yeeld, hee couered that place hee had in charge with his liuelesse carcasse being dead. With this daye ended the renowne of the Empyre, and the ancient liberties of Greece. 
                     
                  
                  The ioy of this victory was by Phillip politickly dissembled: This day he made no sacrifice as he was accustomed, he was not pleasant in companye, he had no enterludes at his feasts, ware no Crown, nor annointed himselfe with sweet oyntments: but so much as lay in men to councell, he so ordred The notable hypocrisie of Philip. this victorie, that no iudgement could discerne by his outward appearance he reioyced to be a conqueror. Moreouer he would not suffer himselfe to be cald the king, but the captaine of Greece, finally he bare so euen a hande betweene his owne priuate gladnesse and the publike sorrow of his enemies, that neither could his own friends report he reioyced, nor his enemies coniecture he was proud of their ouerthrow. 
                  
                  For as touching the Athenians, who by testimony he had tryed to be the most daungerous of his enemies, the prisoners of them he discharged without ransome, and deliuered the bodies of them that were slaine to be buryed: Philips mildnesse toward th Athenians. and of his owne disposition, publikely exhorted them, to conuey home their bones, and bestow them in the sepulchers of their ancestors. Besides, he sent his sonne Alexander, with his friend Antipater, to conclude a finall peace and perpetuall friendship betweene them. But concerning the Thebanes, hee did not onely put their prisoners to ransome, but made them pay tribute for the interring of their dead. The Princes of their city, some he beheaded, others banisht, and all their goods were surprised. 
                  
                  Such as had beene councellers & were exiled out of their natiue country, their banishment he repealed, and made of them three hundred Iudges and rulers of the common-Weale, giuing vnto them full commission to cal before them, all the guilty procurers of their wrongfull banishment, and proceed His rigor to the Thebans against them. By this Decree, those that were lately great, were now araignd of this trespasse against publike gouernment, who constantly replied

                     Phillip hauing setled the estate of Greece in an indifferent stay, summoned a Parliament at Corinth, for reformation of such politick businesses as were yet vnestablished, where he enacted a Statute of peace for all Greece, according

The Lacedemonians onely contemned both the king and his lawe, accounting that peace a bondage, which was not agreeable to the Citties themselues, and their ancient liberties, but were graunted at the pleasure of a conqueror.
                  At this counsell, was appointed vnto euery Citty, what souldiers they should alwaies (as commaund was ministred) furnish for his warres, either to assist him being inuaded by forreign power, or to protect him in what warre soeuer he pretended against other. Vpon this, great preparation was made from all parts, for Phillip had made it apparant to this counsell, that so soone  as their collection ioyned in one, he was resolued to assaile the Empire of Persia; The summe of al his succours mustred together, were two hundred thousand footemen, and fifteene hundred horsemen, besides which number, was also his host of Macedons, and other barbarous Nations bordering thereabouts whom he had subdued.
                  In the beginning of the spring, he sent ouer before into Asia, (which then belonged to the Persians) three of his Captaines Permenio, Amintas, and Attalus (whose sister he had lately taken in mariage) for he hadde now diuorced himselfe from Olimpias, the mother of Alexander, vpon suspicion of adultery, which was raised against her. In this season that his army was assembling  
                     Philip diuorceth himselfe from Olympias. out of Greece, he solemnized a marriage, betweene his daughter Cleopatra, and Alexander whom he had made king of Epyre: which day was honoured with the greatest royalty of triumphs and feasting, according to the estate of two so great Kings: there wanted neither musicke to entice the eare, nor diuersitie He marrieth his daughter to the king of Epyte. of shewes, to satisfie the eye, that Art could deuise to heare and see: all which as Phillip was going forth without his Guarde, onely betweene the two Alexanders, his sonne, and sonne in law, and himselfe in the middest, a young Gentleman of Noble discent in Macedon, stept to him in a straight place which he intended to passe, and slew him, turning that day into present He is slaine. heauinesse, which was consecrated and onely appointed to myrth and pleasure.

I he Gentleman no way digesting this reproch, but rather ingendring and nourishing reuenge in his secret thoughts, casting cuery way to effect some action fitting so foule disgrace, he oftentimes made complaint of his wrong, and became an earnest suter to the King for Iustice; at whose hand he was eyther put off with delayes, or was answered with a wanton scoffe in stead of helpe The cause of Phillips deth. and redresse: thus finding his iniury no way to be satisfied, and knowing his aduersary (in stead of receiuing punishment from the king for his offence) to be aduanced to a captainship, he grew resolute to turne his wrath vppon

                  After him succeeded Alexander, thriuing beyond his father, both in vertues and in vices. First, for the manner of their conquests, it had no affinitye, for Alexander atchiued his battels by force, Phillip by pollicy; he reioysed

The father would oftentimes dissemble his anger, and ouercome it, but this once inraged, there was nothing but reuenge in his thoughts, and neuer alaied without action; which pursued either without mercy or Iustice. But both of them were by disposition, inclind to imoderat and excesse drinking of wine, but in their drunkennesse their purposes had seueral effects, by their seuerall disposition. The father, would ordinarily rise from his meate, and encounter his enemy euen to handy blowes, and vnaduisedly cast himselfe into  danger: but Alexander, outraged not against his enemies, but his especiall friends: So that where Phillip came oftentimes from battell wounded, by his delperate hardinesse, he rose from the table, a murtherer of his Captaines.

The sonne of a more honorable nature, ready to shew mercy to them he ouercame, but the fathers cruelty was not laide open to his owne confederates. The father was giuen to thriuing the son to riot. By which means, the father to his glorie, laid the foundation of the Monarky of the whole world, and the sonne to his higher renowne finished the whole worke.

For some that were enthralled, and restrained of their liberties, were reuiued with the comfortable hope of their accustomed freedom. Others there were euen ouertoyled with the troublesome wearinesse and woes of warrefare

and farre from their natiue Countrey, reioyce to thinke that those affayres should be dissolued, and they dismissed. Many sorry to behold the Tapers that were lighted at the daughters marriage, to stand vpon the hearse of the deceased father. His friendes also were not a little amazed, to seethe sudden change and alteration of thinges, considering how Asia was but latelie chalenged, Europe scarcely yet conquered, and that the Illyrians, Thracians, Dardanians, and other barbarous Nations, were as vnconstant of mind, as vnfaithfull of promise. All which people (if at one time they should rebell) it were not possible any way to repell their commotions. But vnto these mischieses the comming of Alexander was a present remedie. For in an Oration  
                     The wise behamour of Alexander. deliuered unto the people, he did not only free their heartes from feare, but confirmed in their hopes, a conceipt of all happy successe. Hee was then twenty yeares olde, in which age, his modesty was such, as that it promised much more then was expected.
                  He gaue the Macedons a cleere discharge of all things, saue onely of the Warres, by which he purchased to himselfe so much fauour, and ingraffed so good liking in all mens opinions, that they saide, They had changed the body of the King, but not his vertues. His first and chiefest reguard was, to performe the funerall rightes of his father, with such solemnity as became the greatnesse of his estate. In the obsequies whereof (before all other things)  he caused such to be executed vpon his Fathers Toombe, as were any waye The murder

                  In the beginning of his raigne, he subdued many Countries that rebelled, and suppressed diuers insurrections, euen in their beginning. By which being greatly encouraged, he trauailed into Greece, where after the example of his father, he summoned the citties to appeare before him at Corinth, and was substituted Captaine generall of the forces, and thereupon he immediatly prosecuted the wars against the Persyans, which were begun by his Alexander prosecuteth the warres of his father.

Vpon which report, the minds almost of all the Citties were changed and the garrisons of the Macedones besieged: to preuent which motions, Alexander entred

                      exhorted the Thessalians to keep their aleagiance, vrging still the benefits that his father had extended towards them, and putting them in minde of the kindered and alliance that was betwixt him and them, by

his mothers side, which came of the stocke of Aeacus. The Thessalians entertained those speeches with much ioy and admiration, and establisht him in the place that his father formerly possessed, which was chiefe Duke of their Countrey, yeelding him all the tributes, and reuenues, thereunto due, and accustomed. But the Athenians as they were the first that reuolted, so were the first that repented: wondring at the disdaine of their enemie and extolling the childhood of Alexander (whom before they held in scorne) aboue the prowesse of their aucient captain. Therefore they dispatcht Aambassadors with intreaty of peace, and pardon: Whom Alexander hearing, (after many rebukes giuen them for their insolency) made ioyfull in the fruition of their request. 
                  
                  From thence he turned his power towards Thebes intending to haue shewed the like mercy to them, if he had found the like repentance in them. But the Thebanes in stead of submission and intreaty went to it with force of armes. So soone therefore as they were vanquished they suffered the grieuous punishment of miserable thrauldome and captiuity.
                  When the matter came to be debated in counsell as concerning the destruction of the Citty, the Phocenses, Platecenses, Thespians and Orchomenians, (Alexanders confederats and pertakers at his victory) found fault with the The h

That their dealings had purchased a generall hatred of the people, this might be an euident proofe that they had all bound themselues with an oath to raze Thebes, as soone as they had ouercome the Persians. And that they might be the more hated, not onely for their present disloialty, but for their former impudency, they pronounced that they had cloied all stages with playes made of their wicked and detested proceedings.
                  Then Cleadas one of the prisoners hauing free liberty of speech, affirmed The conncel of Eleadastor to saue the Citty. that the Thebanes had reuolted from the Kings heires, and not from the king  whom they heard to be slaine. Which deed if it were any trespasse, it might rather be imputed to the oresight of light credit, then to any vntroth or infidelity, for which notwithstanding they had already endured great punishment, for the youth of the citty being put to the sword, there suruiued none, but a company of women, and old men, which as they were feeble, so were they vnable to doe harme, yet had they beene vexed with many rauishments, and other shamefull displeasures. Wherefore this intercession was not for his Countrey folke (whereof there were so few left) but the guiltlesse soyle of his Countrey, and the towne it selfe, in which not men onely, but Goddes had receiued their birth, and Natiuity. 
                  
                  For a pryuate superstitious instance to entreate the king withall, he alleaged that Hercules (from whom the house of the Acacydes do fetch their petigree) was borne among them, and that his father Phillip had passed his childhood at Thebes: beseeching him to spare that cittie, which honoured some of his auncestors that were borne their as Goddes and had seen other of them

that were there brought vp raised to the possession of royall and kingly Diadems. But wrath preuailed before intreaty. The citty therefore was razed, the Lands deuided amongst the Conquerors, and the prisoners saued vnder a Garland, the price whereof was set, not to the aduantage of the buyers, but according to the malice of the enimies.
                  The Athenians thought it a miserable sight, and therefore opened their Gates for the refuge of such as had escaped by slight, contrary to the Kings commaundement. At which deede Alexander tooke such displeasure, that when their Ambassadors came againe to sue for peace, he remitted their offence, vpon condition that they should yeeld into his hands their Captains Alexander d

                  At his setting forth to the warres in Persia, he put to death al his mother in lawes kinsmen, whom Phillip had raised to high promotions: and made rulers of countries, neither spared he such of his owne kindred, as seemd meete His mother in lawes

Then assembled he all his power, and tooke shippe. Out of which as soone as he beheld Asia, in is courage he grew wonderfully inflamed, and made twelue altars to the gods, as a vow for prosperous successe in his warres.
                  The inheritance he had in Macedon, and Europe, he deuided among his friends, saying that Asia was enough for himselfe. Before any saile departed Alexander deuideth his inheritance in Macedon among his friends from the shore, he slue sacrifices, making his prayer for victory by battell, as by which he was best to be the reuenger of Greece, that so often times before had bene assailed of the Persians, whose Monarchy had continued long  enough, and was come to such perfit ripenesse, that it was high time for some other to take the roome, of more woorth and hability to vndergoe it. Neither was the Army of lesse corage then the King himselfe. For without remembrance of their wiues and children, they forgot they shoulde make warre farre from home, and as sure account to possesse the Gold of the Persians, and the riches of the whole East, as if it had beene their owne already, nothing dreading the dangers of the Warre, but doubting their courages, by an vndoubted expectation of purchase, and victory. Assoone as they were come to land, Alexander first of all threw a dart, as it were in the face of his enemies, and in his armor lept out of his ship, and so kild his sacrifices,  praying the Goddes that those countries might willingly receiue him as their King. In the same places also he kept funerals at the Tombes of such as were slaine at the battell of Troy.
                  
                  Then sought he for his enemy, straightly charging his souldiors to make no wast in the countrey of Asia, saying it was but reason, to spare that, which

they intended should be their owne, and to make no hauocke of those things, which they purposely came to possesse. In his Army were thirty two thousand footemen, foure thousand and fiue hundred horsemen, and one hundreth, fourescore, and two shippes. And it is to be doubted, whether it might be The number of Ale

Moreouer none had the leadings of any band, that was vnder the age of threescore yeares old. So that a man beholding the chiefe officers of his campe, would haue sayde, he had seene the Senate of some auncient common-wealth. There was none therefore that put more trust to his legges, then his armes, neither did any man thinke of running away, but of getting the victory. On the other side Daryus king of Persya trusting in his owne strength, refused to doe any thing by pollicy, assirming that it stoode not with his honor to steale the conquest, or The

The first encounter  therefore, was in the plaines of Adrast. In the hoste of the Persians were siue hundred thousand fighting men, whereof many being slaughtered The number of the Persyans. the suruiuing residue turned their backes and fled, being vanquished as much by the pollicy of Alexander, as by the puissaunce of the Macedons. Of Alexanders host, were slaine nine footemen, and an hundreth and twenty horsemen, Whom the king (the more to encourage the remainer of his souldiors) caused to bee sumptuously buried and their Images to be set on their Toombes, and gaue great priuiledges to their kinsfolke.
                  In this victory the greater part of Asia fell vnto him. He fought many battels  with the lieutenants of Darius, whom he (not somuch by force by the terror of his name) did afterwards vanquish, and subdue. In the meane time Alexander (by the confession of a prisoner) receiued information that Alexander of Lincest, the sonne of antipater, whom he had left his vicegerent in Macedon, went about to worke treason against him. Yet distrusting that if he should put him to death, there would rise some commotion in Macedon, he committed him to safekeeping. This done, he marched towards the citty of Gordis, the which is scituate between the greater and the lesser Phrigia. The desire that Alexander had to get this city in his possession, was not so much for the riches, Of the Citty of Gordis & Gordi

And as he went to aske counsell of the Southsaiers of the citty, by the way he met vvith a maide of excellent beauty, and crauing her aduice to

                  He thought himselfe happy to haue such afaire offer at the first entry of his kingdome. After the marriage solemnized, the Phrygyans amongst themselues fell at discord and discention. And when they asked counsell of the Oracle how the same might be appeased, answere was made that it could not be ended without the helpe of a king. Demaunding againe, of the person of  their king, what manner of man he should be, commaundement was giuen them, that they should marke, whom they first saw after their returne, ryding into the Temple of Iupiter, and take him for their king. The first man they met, was this Gordias, whom they presently saluted by the name of King. The chariot wherin he rode, when the kingdome was imposed vpon him, he placed in the Temple of Iupiter, and consecrated it for an offering, as a thing accustomed for Kings to doe at their Coronation.

                     Alexander hauing taken the towne, and comming into the Temple of Iupiter, immediatly inquired for the yoke of the waine: the which being brought before him, and he (vpon sight thereof) finding himselfe vnable to come by the ends of the thonges that were hidden with the wreathes, wrested the Oracle to the vttermost, and cut them asunder with his sword, and so the wreathes being losed, he found the endes of the knots within the braides.

                  When he came to Tarsus, he was much delighted with the pleasantnesse of the riuer Cidnus, which runneth through the middest of the Citty, and as he Alexander in great danger by a surfet. was full of dust and sweat, he threw himselfe naked into the cold water, which forthwith begat such a stifnesse through al his sinewes, that he lost his speech, and was in such danger of death, that he seemed past hope of recouery. Onely there was one of his Physitians, named Phillip, which warranted him his life. And yet the same Phisition was had in mistrust, by reason of the letters sent the day before out of Cappadocia from Permenio. Who knowing nothing of Alexanders mischance, wrote vnto him to take heede of Phillip his Phisition,  for he was corrupted by Darius for a great summe of money. Yet Alexander thought it his better safety to commit himself into the hands of the phisition, then to abide the danger of his disease, whereof there was litle hope but death. Therefore he tooke the drinke that the Phisition had made him, and deliuered him the letter: And as he was drinking, hee stedfastly beheld his face, to obserue and marke what countenance he would carry at the reading thereof.
                  
                  But he was nothing abashed therat, which Alexander was very glad of, and the fourth day after recouered his health. Darius therefore with three hundred thousand footemen, and an hundreth thousand horsemen proceeded vnto battel. Which huge multitude of enimies when Alexander beheld, he was much The second encounter of alexander & Darius moued, in respect of the small number of his men; yet when he called againe to minde what great enterprizes he had atchieued, and how mighty Countries he had conquered with that small quantity, he van quished all feare with hope (the mindes best comforter) and thought it daungerous to delay the battell, least his men should be discouraged. Therefore he rode about his Army, and with sundry orations did anymate the hearts of his company. 
                  
                  The Illirians and Thracians he encouraged with promise of great riches, and substance. The Greekes he set on fire with remembrance of their former warres, and their continuall hatred against the Persians. The Macedons he put in minde of Europe already conquered, and of Asia now conquered: perswading them that in the world there wer not men like them for strength and mag naminitye, and that this battell would make an end of their troubles, and immortally eternize their glory. In speaking these wordes, he commaunded his batels to stand still againe, that by pausing, they might acquaint their eies with the huge number of their enemies.
                  
                     Darius also was not remisse in ordering of his battels, for whereas it belonged  to the duty of his Captaines to doe it, he went himselfe to each ranke, and exhorted them all to play the men, putting them in remembrance of the auncient renowne of the Persians, and of the perpetuall possession of the Empire giuen them by the the Goddes.
                  This done, with great courage both the armies buckled togeather. And in that battell both kings were wounded, and the victory hung in doubtfull suspence, till Darius, forsook the field. Then followed the slaughter of the Persians, of whom were slaine threescore thousand footemen, ten thousand horsmen, The slaughter of the per syans. and forty thousand were taken prisoners. Of the Macedons, were put to sword, an hundreth and thirty footemen, and an hundreth and fifty horsemen.  In the tents of the Persians was found much gold and other riches. Amongst others, were taken prisoners Darius Mother, his wife, and two of his daughters. Whom when Alexander came to visit and comfort, they made a great skreeking, vppon sight of the harnisht men, and imbraced one another, as if there had beene no other way with them, but present death. They fell prostrate at Alexanders seete, not entreating pardon for their liues, but beseeching respit for a time to celebrate the funerals of Darius.

After this, he beheld the ritches, Iewels, and apparell of Darius, which when he sawe, he was struck with admiration and wonder. Then began he to make riotous banquets, sumtuous feasts, and to fall in loue with Barsiue (for her beauty and fauour) who was one of prisoners, and of whom afterward he begat a Sonne,

For his mother Olympias had secretly deliuered to Phillip her husband that she conceiued not Alexander by him but by a Serpent of admirable bignesse. And Phillip himselfe but a little before his death, had openly reported that he was not his Sonne: wherevpon (as though she had playd false with him) he put away Olimpias. Alexander therefore being desirous  to fetch his pedigree from the gods, and deliuer his Mother from slander of the world, addressed Messengers priuily before to the Priestes, to direct them, what answer he would haue them to make.
                  As soone as he entred into the Temple, the Prelats saluted him by the name of the sonne of Hammon. And he reioycing at this adoption of the gods gaue commaundement that al men in generall should take him for his father.

Then he demaunded whether they had inslicted punishment on such as were guilty of the murther of his father. They made answer that his father could neither dye, nor be killed, but as for the death of king Phillip, the dooers there of had receiued sufficient and condigne punishment. To his third demaund they answered, that he should tryumpth in victory, and be conqueror in all battel

But Alexander returned answere, that they were not to be ransomed for money, nor vnder the value of his whole kingdomes possession.

Therefore aduised him either to submit himselfe the same day, or else to prepare himselfe to battell the next day, and not to beguile his hopes with the expectation of any other victory, then what he had tryed already. The next day they brought their men into the field. But sodainely before the battell Alexander fell a sleepe, being very heauy, and surprized with the multitude of cares, and discontentments. And when all his men were in readinesse to giue the charge vpon their enemies, the king onely was missing. Who afterwardes being very hardly awaked by Parmenio, and of all his men demaunded the cause of his so sounde sleeping in a time so daungerous, seeing he was formerly accustomed to content himselfe with very little sleepe euen when the quietnesse of his affaires gaue occasion of all leisure, and liberty: he made answere  that he was deliuered of a great feare, and that he had slept of a sodaine content that came on him, & pleased all his sences; for that at once he should encounter with the whole power of Darius, which he was afraide should haue been prolonged if the Persians had deuided their Army.
                  Before the battell each army stoode in the sight of other. The Macedones wondering at the number of their Enimyes, their goodlye personages, and their costly armor: the Persians on the other side, amazing that so few should ouercome so many thousandes as they had. The Captaines bestirring themselues in looking to their seuerall charges. Darius encouraged his souldiers  with this, that if they were deuided, the number of them tenne to one exceeded their Enemies. Alexander willed the Macedones not to be abashed at the multitude of the contrary party, at the hugenesse of their bodies, nor the strangenesse of their colour. But to remember that this was the third time of their fight, and that they should not thinke their enemyes were become better men by their often running away, especially sith they brought with them into the fielde so sorrowfull a remembrance of their owne discomfitures, as of somuch bloodshed as they went away with, in the two former battels. And as Darius exceeded him in number of Men, so did he surpasse Darius in the greatnesse of strength. Therefore exhorted his men to dispise that  hoste, in which was more gayne then daunger, and glistred more in the outwatrde shew of Gold and siluer, then in the inwarde substaunce of valour, and vertue: for victory vvas not gotten by the brauery of furniture, but by the force of weapon, and the vndaunted resolution of couragious spirits.
                  After this, the onset vvas giuen. The Macedones layd about them fiercely with their vveapons, as disdainning their enemy whom before they had so often vanquished. The Persians on the contrary side had rather dye, then be vanquished, which caused somuch effusion of blood, as had not at any time bene seene in any batteel. Parius when he perceiued his men put to the worse, Darius is put to slight. The care of Darius for the safeg

                      would gladly haue made his end honorable by his death in the fielde, but that such as vvere about him compelled him to saue his life by flight.
                  Afterwardes when some gaue him counsell to breake the bridge ouer the riuer Lycus, that he might stoppe his Enemies from pursuite, he said that his care shoulde not be altogether for his owne safegard, but that he would also shew himself careful for his company, and not cast so many of them into their

enemies hands: Therefore appointed, it should be a way for others to escape, as well as it had beene for himselfe. Alexander, he vndertooke still, and enterprised such things as were most full of danger, and where he saw his enemies thickest, and the sight sharpest, thyther did his resolution carry him, and there would he thrust himselfe into the greatest perils, and not leaue them to the hurte, and hazzard of his Souldiers. By this battell he tooke awaye the Empyre of all Asia, the first yeare after he began to raigne. Whose felicity The beginning of the Empyre of Macedon. was so great that no man durst rebell against him, and the Persians themselues after so many yeares continuance of their monarchy, paciently endured the yoke of bondage. 
                  
                  When he had rewarded, and refreshed his souldiers, he did nothing for forty daies after, but take view of the spoile of his enemie & found lockt vp in the Citty forty thousand talents. He also wonne Percipolis, the head Citty of the kingdome of Persia, the which had continued famous many yeares together, and stuffed with the spoiles of the whole world. While these things were doing, there came vnto Alexander about eight hundreth Greekes, who besides their punishment of captiuity, were depriued of some of their limbes, and requested him that as he had reuenged Greece, so he would also reuenge the cruelty of their enemies. When he had put it to their choice either to stay there, or returne into their countries, they rather chose to take certaine lands,  and make their abode there, then to goe home to be a griefe to their friends, and a ioy to their enemies.
                  In the meane season to winne the fauor of the conqueror, Darius his owne kinsmen, in a village of the Parthians called Tane, bound him in setters, and chaines of gold: which was thoght the very ordinance and disposition of the Darius wounded to death by his owne kinsmen. Gods, that the monarchy of the Persians should take end in the land of them that should succeede in the Empire.
                  
                     Alexander also the next morrow, following vpon spurre, had intelligence that Darius was conucied out by night in an horse-litter. And there vpon commaunded his hoste to follow the chace with seauen thousand of his horsemen.  In his iourney he fought many dangerous battels. And when he had ridden many a mile and could receiue no intellgence, or inkling of Darius, as his horses were a baiting, one of his souldiers, going downe to a watering place nere adioyning, found Darius sore wounded in a Litter, but as yet aliue. Who calling the same souldier vnto him, and perceiuing by his speeche that he was one of his owne Countreymen, he told him, that being in the case he was, it was no small comfort vnto him, that he should not vtter his last words in vaine, but speake to a man that could well vnderstand him.
                  He bad him then beare word vnto Alexander, that he died a great debtor of his without any desart of his own part, for he was better intreated of him,

For whereas his enemy had giuen his wife, and children life, his owne kinssolke, vpon whome he had both bestowed life and kingdomes, had now giuen him the fatall stroke of death: for which he rendred such thankes vnto himas it might please the Conqueror to accept at the hands of the conquered.

Onely one thing now at the point of death lay in his power to doe for Alexander, in requitall and full recompence of all his good turns, which was, that he woulde pray to the celestiall, and infernall powers, and the Goddes of Kinges, to giue him the victory, and Dominion of the whole worlde. For his owne part he desired nothing, but that without grudging hee woulde graunte his rightes of buriall for to bee solemnly celebrated.
                  Touching the reuenge of his death, it was now no parte of his care, but (for example sake) it concerned the common case of Kinges, which to neglect, as it should be dishonorable, so it might turne to his owne vtter perill. Form thone part it was a case that craued iustice, on the other it touched his  owne profit, and safety. In token whereof, as a kingly pledge of his faith, he gaue the Souldior his right hand to carry vnto Alexander. These words being vttred, he stretcht foorth himselfe, and immediately yeelded vp the Ghost.

Whetfore he caused his body to be buried in that royall maner, as became the estate, and condtion of a K. and the same to be bestowed in the famous Toombes of  his Noble auncestors.

                     Ag is King of the Spartans in Grecce; of Alexander King of Epire, in Italy; and of his Lieutenant Sopiron in Scithia: which at first fild his thoughtes full of sundry amazements. Neuertheles when he had well digested the natures of two Kings, that didde enuy the prosperity of his fortunes, he was more gladde of the losse of them, then sorrie for his army, and his Captaine Zopyron.
                  
                  For after Alexander had taken his iourney, the most part of Greece sell to rebellion, in hope to recouer their liberty, following the example of the Lacedemontans, who forsooke the peace, and despised the orders taken both by  
                     Phillip and Alexander. Captaine and ringleader of this commotion, was Agis the Lacedemonian king. But Antipater leuyed a power and suppressed this insurrection, at the very first beginning, notwithstanding there were on both partes, great slaughter and much effusion of bloud. King Agis, when he sawe his men put to flight (albeit his fortunes were not so good as Alexanders,) yet The v

                  Moreouer, Alexander king of Epyre, being sent into Italy to ayde the Tarentines against the Brutians, tooke that voyage vpon him with as great desire, as  though the world should haue beene deuided, and that Alexander, the sonne of his sister Olympias should haue had the East, and he himselfe the West, intending to haue no lesse command in Italy, Affrike, and Sicill, then thother should haue to doe in Asia, and among the Persians. Besides this, as the Oracle at Delphos had prophesied vnto Alexander the great, that his destruction should be wrought in Macedon, so the Oracle of Iupiter of Dodones, had told this Alexander, that the citty of Pandose, & the riuer of Acheruse should be his fatall end.
                  Now as both of them were in Epyre, (not knowing they were also in Italy) 
                      to auoyde the danger of his destiny, he enterprised war in a strange land. The first warre he made when he came into Italy, was with the Appuleyans,

of Troy. But being expulsed by the Appuleyans, they asked counsell of the Oracles, who answered, that they shoulde for euer possesse the place that they required. Hereupon they dispatched Ambassadors to the Appuleyans, and willed them either to surrender their Citty againe, or to expect suddaine, and sharpe Warres vpon them. The Appuleyans hauing knowledge of the answeare of the Oracle, putte the Ambassadoures to death, and buried them in the Citty, there to remaine for euer.
                  So hauing dispatched the meaning of the Oracle, they enioyed the citty a long time after. Which when Alexander of Epire vnderstood of, he forbare to trouble th Appuleyans reuerencing the destinies oflong coutinuance. 
                  
                  Then made he warre with the Brutians, and Lucanes, and woon many citties Alexander of

But the Brutians, and Lucanes hauing obtained helpe and aide of their neighboures, siercely renewed the warres: where the king (nere vnto the citty Pandose and the riuer Acheruse) was wounded to death, not knowing the name of his fatall place, before he was slaine. And when he snoulde die, hee perceiued the daunger of death lay not in his owne Countrey, albeit for that cause hee forsooke the same. The Tyrians ransomed his body at the charges of their Citty, giuing it honoarable buriall.

Moreouer he spent the nights by turns amongst the kings Concubines, which were women both of excellent birth and beautie. And least his lustfull likinges might seeme to abate, or decay, he surthered them with all sorts of great fare, and set out his feastes with all princely pastimes, and shewes, forgetting quite by such meanes ritches are woont to bee consumed, and not obtained. 
                  
                  This caused much murmur to arise through all his camp, that he should so degenerate from Phillip his father, as to disdaine the name of his owne Countrey, and to take vpon him the manners of the Persians, whom for the vilenesse thereof he before had supprest, and subdued. But that it might not be a fault to him alone, to yeild to the vices of such, as he had vanquished, he gaue liberty to his Souldiors (if any of them would be delighted with the company of their prisoners) to take them to their wiues; thinking indeede they would haue lesse mind homewards, when euen in their tentes they had a Pollicy

                  Besides this, he thought Macedon should not be so much spent in sending supplies for them that were slaine, if the young Impes succeeded the olde Souldiors (their fathers) and were trainde vp in the same trench that they were borne in; and that they would become the hardier, being not traind vp onely, but also Nursed in the campe. Which custome afterwards remained amongst the successors of Alexander. Therfore there was a stipend appointed to maintaine and foster vp the Children, and when they came to mans estate, they had furniture, horsse, and harnesse giuen them, and the fathers  had wages allowed them, according to the number of their sonnes. If any of their fathers died, the children neuerthelesse that suruiued, receiued their fathers wages, and so their childhood amongst so many Voyages was euen a very warrefare. Being therfore from their infancy hardned with continual trauell, and daunger, they becam an inuincible host, reckoning the campe, as their countrey; and the battell, as an assured victory. They that wer thus begotten, were called Epigones. When he had conquered the Parthians, he created Andagoras, (one of the chiefest Noble men of Persia) ruler ouer them, from whom afterwards the Kings of Parthia descended.
                  In the meane space Alexander, began to grow outrag ous with his owne followers, not like a king, but an enimy. The chiefest cause of his displeasure  was that some of them, found fault with him, for breaking the customes alexand

For which the auncient father Parmenio, (after inquisition had) being in estate next to the king, and his son Philotas, were both put to death. Wherupon all the campe began to be in an vprore, grieuing at the mischaunce of the olde man and his

Sonne and not letting sometime to say, that it was not for themselues then to expect any better.
                  When these thinges came to the hearing of Alexander, fearing that if the report thereof should be blowne into Macedone, the glory of his victories would be stained with the imputation of cruelty, he fained an intention to send Alexanders feare of the people. certaine of his friends into Macedon to beare tydings of his seuerall conquests, and willed his Souldiers to write to their frindes, saying it would be long ere they had the like opportunity, because he meant to make warre further of. This being done, by which he perceiuing euery mans opinion, put all those into one band that had an ill conceipt of him, intending either to consume them  by battell, or to people townes with them in the vttermost parts of the world. Then did he subdue the Dracans, the Euergets, the Permenians, the Paropamys sadons, Hisdaspians, and the other kindes of people, that inhabite the foote of the mountayne Caucasus. In the meane time Bessus was brought vnto him, one of Darius friends, who had not only betrayed the King his Maister, but had also cruelly slaine him. Whom in reuenge of his trechery, he deliuered Bessas deliuered to be punished for tre son. to Darius brother to punish as he thought good, and to vse such Iustice vpon him, that had traiterously slaine his owne maister, as the seucrity of such a foule sact required. Vpon the riuer Tanais he builded a Citty, and named it Alexandria, to the end, he might leaue his name amongst them in those Countries. The walles whereof, being sixe miles in compasse, he finished  within seuenteene dayes, remouing into it the people of three Citties, that Cyrus had builded. Among the Sagdians, and Bactrians also, he builded seauenteene Citties, placing in them all such as he knew to be seditious in his hoast.

Which the greatest parte of his guestes assented to, and confirmed. When Clytus therefore one of the old  men, vpon trust of the Kings friendship (for in that respect he was the chiefest about him) defended the same of Phillip, and stoode in the praise of his Noble and worthy actes, he somuch prouoked the displeasure and indignation of Alexander therewith, that he snatched a weapon out of one of his guards hand, and slue him as he sat at the table.
                  Then triumphing at the murther, he vpbraided him as he lay dead, with his commending of Phillip, and with his commendation of his fathers wars. But after his mind (satisfied with the slaughter) began to be quieted, and that aduice had entered in the place of anger: one while pondering in his  hart whom he had slaine, another while vpon what occasion he slue him; he began to loath his owne act done, and to grieue that he had taken his fathers praises in such deep displeasure, lamenting at his ouersight, that in his wine he had kild an old man, his deere friend, faultlesse; and without any occasion of offence giuen. And thereupon being turned with like rage to Repentance, as he was euen now in Anger, in that extacie he would haue died.

He continued certaine daies after in this wilfulnesse to die. And the more to increase his sorrow, there came to his minde, the remembrance of Clyt us sister, who albeit she was notthere, yet was he ashamed in himselfe, that he had so shamefully rewarded hir that nurst him, as now being a man growne, and a Conqueror, to present her with her owne brothers corse in requitall of her good turnes, that had borne him in hir Armes all the time of his  child-hood.
                  Moreouer he bethought him, what reportes and scandals he had raised of himself in his army, and among the Nations, that he had conquered: What a feare, and secret hatred, he had striken into the harts of his own friends: how bitter, and loathsome he had made his owne Table, being not so bloody, armed in the field, as sitting naked at his meate. Then came to his remembrance Parmenio, and Phylotas, then amint as his sisters sonne: then came into his minde, his Mother in law, and hir brothers that was put to death: then attalus, Eurylocus, Pausanias, and other Noble men of Macedons, whose liues he had taken away. Hereupon he obstinately refused his meate three daies together, till  his whole hoast came and intreated him, that he would not so lament the death of one man, as to cast away a multitude that followed him; and euen at that time, when he had brought them to the vttermost of the barbarous Nations, and among the middest of their Enemies, and those whom by battell they had stirred to hate, and enuy. To diswade him from discontentment greatly preuailed the perswasion of the Philosopher Callysthenes, who had beene his scoole fellow vnder aristotle, and was then lately sent for by the King himselfe to put his actes in writing. When therefore he called his courage againe Calisthenes perswadeth much by his cloquence. backe to the warres, hee receiued the Chorasmians and Dracans, by composition.
                  Afterwardes that all thinges might seeme more spightfull, he gaue generall  commaundement to his company, that they should no more salute him, but adore him. Callysthenes was one of them that stood stisliest against his purpose, which was both the confusion of himselfe, and of many Noble men of Macedon. For vnder the coulor oftreason, they were all put to death. Neuerthelesse the Macedones stil obserued their custome of saluting their King, and vtterly reiected the manner of adorning. After this, he marched towardes India, to bound his Empire at the Ocean sea, and the vttermost partes of the East.
                  To adde renowne to his Name, and that the ornaments of his army might  be agreeable, he caused the trappings of the horses, and the armour of his Souldiers to be decked and ouer layd with siluer, and after their siluer shields he named his whole hoste Argyraspides. When he came to the Citty Nisa, the Townsmen (vpon a superstitious confidence that they had in their God Bacchus, who was founder thereof) making no countenaunce of resisting, he gaue forth an exceeding straight commaundement that it should be spared:

reioycing greatly, that he had not only followed the wars, but the very footsteppes also of the gods. From thence he led his hoste to see the Mount, which was naturally beset with vines, and Iuye, in such order, as if it had beene drest with mans hand, and placed by the cunning of workemanship: as soone The holy

Whereby he might perceiue that by sparing the Townsmen, he did not somuch profit them, as pleasure his owne Army.

When he had traueled through India, he came to a maruellous rough and huge rocke, into which many people were fled, from winning whereof it was told him that Hercules was prohibited by an carthquake. Burning therefore with desire to surmount the doings of Hercules, he woon the same rocke, with much labour,  and many perills. By which all the people bordering thereabouts yeilded themselues vnto him, and he in like sort receiued them into his grace, and fauour.
                  Then Porus one of the kings of India, a man of maruellous magnanimity and strength of body, vnderstanding the fame of Alexander, meant to encounter Thincounter between Por ru

                         and Alex ander. with him, and prepared for the warre against his comming. And when on both sides the Army was in readinesse to giue onset, he willed his Men to set vpon the Macedones and to suffer him alone to combat single with their king.
                  
                     Alexander made no tariance to the battell. But at the first encounter, his horse was wounded vnder him, and he himselfe fell downe headlong to the  ground: howbeit his guard stept abouthim and rescued him. Porus not able longer to abide the brunt of battell, by reason of his multitude of woundes, was surprized and taken prisoner. Whereat his griefe was so great, for his being vanquished, that although he found fauour at his Enemies handes, yet would he not recciue any sustinance, nor suffur his woundes to be dressed: but much adoe there was to intreat him to liue. This courage, and valour did Alexander so highly commend in him, that in honor therof he sent him home againe with safety into his kingdome. Then builded he two Citties, whereof the one he called Nicea, and the other (after the name of his horse) Bucephala.
                  
                  Afterwardes he conquered the adrastes, the Stathenes, the Passides and the  
                     Gangarytes, and slew all their Armies. When he came to the Eufits where his Enemies waited his comming with two hundreth thousand horsemen; His whole Army being wearied with the number of their victories, and their continuall labours, besought him with teares that at length he would make end of his warres, and minding his own country, haue regard to the yeares of his souldiers, which were scarce able to liue so long, as while each man might recouer

his seuerall home. One shewed his gray head, another his many woundes, another his leane Carcasse, wythered with the multitude of yeares, another his body full of skarres, and maimes. Saying that they alone were the Men that had endured the continual warres of two Kings, Phillip and Alexander. Wherfore they did beseech him (at the least) to restore their poore carcasses to the graues of their fathers, who now fainted, not for want of heart; or goodwill, but for want of yeares, to maintaine the resolute performance of their willing mindes. If he would not regard his Souldiers, yet to haue respect of himselfe, and not to weary out his good fortune, nor offend with presumptyon. 
                  
                  Being moued with these iust petitions, (as it were to winde vp his victories in more honor) he caused his camp to be set out after more stately sort then was accustomed, that the hugenesse thereof might both put his enemies in feare, and leaue somwhat to sucdeeding posterity to talke of. His souldiers did neuer worke in all their liues, with more alacrity, or free spirits. When they had therefore discomfited theyr enemies, they returned with great ioy and gladnesse. From thence Alexander went to the riuer Acesyne, and by that he sayled to the Ocean, where he tooke to mercy the Gessones and Asybanes, which were founded by Hercules.
                  
                  From thence he sailed to the Ambres, and Sycambres, which met him with  foure score thousand footemen, and threescore thousand horsemen. When he had gotten the vpper hand of them, he led his hoast against their Citty, which hee finding voide of defendantes, as he looked from the wall, (the Alexanders valour amóg thousands of enemyes. which before any of his Men he himselfe had scaled) he leapt into the Citty, without any of his guard about him. When his enemyes saw him there alone, they ranne at him on all sides with a great shoute, indeuouring if they could to finish the warres of the whole world in one Mans death, and to be reuenged vpon him for many Nations.
                  
                     Alexander on the contrary part, as manfully withstoode them, and being but one man fought against many thousandes. It is almost incredible and not  to be spoken of, that neither the number of his enemies, the force and multitude of their weapons, nor their confused noyse as they assailed him, could make him affraid, and that being but alone, he should beat downe and put to flight, so great and infinite a company.
                  But when he saw he was ouercharged, he withdrew himselfe to a block, that stoode by a wall, by help whereof standing in safegard, he held them all tacke, till his friendes knowing what perill he stoode in, leapt downe to aide him. Of whom many were slaine, and the battell hung long in suspence, till the time that his Army (hauing beaten downe the walles) came in to his rescue. In that conflict he was striken with an arrow vnder the right pappe, and  notwithstanding he bled so sore that he could scarce stand for feeblenesse, yet kneeling on his knee, he neuer left fighting, vntill he had slaine him, of whom Alexandes sendeth a great hoast to Babylon. he was wounded.
                  The healing of the wound was farre more gricuous then the wound it selfe. Therefore when at length contrary to all hope, he had recouered his health and strength, he sent Polyperchon, vvith his host to Babylon, and he himselfe

with a number of his most select and chosen Souldiers, tooke shipping, and scowred the Ocean Seas, along the coast. When he came at the Citty of king Ambyger, the townesmen heating he could not be ouercome by sword, dipt their arrowes in poyson, and so with double wound of death repelled the Enemy

                  The which being giuen him in drinke, he was forthwith deliuered from theymminent danger, and the most part of the Army was by that meanes preserued. After when he had won the towne by force, he returned into his  shippes, and made offring to Neptune, the Sea-god, with praiers, and petition for safe returne into his Countrey. Then he established the boundes of his Empire as farre as there was any land habitable, or as farre as the sea was able to be sailed, and with prosperous winde entred into the mouth of the Ryuer Indus. There (as a monument of his conquests) he builded the Barce, and set vp Altars, leauing one of his friendes Lieuetenant of the Indians, that inhabit the Sea coast.
                  From thence intending to take his iourney by land, as he heard there was scarcity of water by the way, he commaunded pittes to be made in places conuenient Alexanders return againe to Babylon 
                      as he passed, wherein he found great plenty of sweete water, and so returned to Babylon. There many of the Nations that he had subdued, accused their rulers, whom Alexander without respect either of friendship, or fauour, caused to be put to death in the presence of the Ambassad. After this, he tooke to wife Satir, the daughter of king Darius. He also chose out of the Noblest, and most beautifull Ladies and Gentlewomen of all Nations, and gaue them to his Noblemen in marriage: which he did to the intent that the custom and community of the fact, his owne offence might seeme the lighter.
                  Then summond he his Army before him, and enquiring of their debts, he promised to set them free, and pay what they owed out of his owne purse,  that they might cary home cleare their booties and rewardes. This liberality was highly extold in Alexander, both for the greatnesse of the summe, and in regard of the cheerefull and free guift thereof. And it was as thankfully receiued of the creditors as of the debtors, being not easie for the one to recouer His bounty to his Soulo

                  He also cashierd the old Souldiers, and supplyed their roomes with younger, such as were still reteined grudging that the old souldiers were dissmissed required also to be cashiered: bidding him pay them their wages, and not tell them of their yeares, for seeing they were chosen into warfarre together, they  thought it but right and duty, to be discharged togither. And now they deale not with him by way of petition, but by flat and open rayling. And wish him to sinishe his warres alone with his father Hammon, and then go set light by his Souldiers. He on the contrary side somtime rebuked them, sometime admonisht them, perswading with gentle speeches, that they should not darken their famous conquests with rebellion.
                  
                     
At last when he saw his wordes were not auaileable, he rose out of his chaire 13. of thebeginners ofthe tumult put to death. vnarmed, and stept amongst the thickest of them, being all armed, to fetch out the Authors of that rebellious contumacy: and without contradiction or resistance brought forth thirteene and lead them to execution with his owne handes. So great a patience in suffering death did the feare of a king cast vpon them, or the customable envring to the discipline of warre giue him bouldnes to put them to death. Then did he cal the Persians a part, and speaking to them praised their continuall faithfulnesse both to himselfe, and to their kinges in times past, and rehearsed his benefites towardes them: how he neuer esteemd them as vanquished, but as partakers of his victory, and (to be short) how he  passed into their lawes, and customes, and not they into the customes of his countrey, hauing made both the conquerors and conquered alike by winning aliance and affinity. And now, he saide he would commit the custody of his owne person not to the Macedones onely, but to the safety also of the Persians.
                  
                  Therevpon he chose a thousand of their young men into his guard, and to another sort of them he gaue armour, and weapons, and dispearst them into his owne hoaste, that they should learne the orders of the Macedonian warres. This the Macedones tooke very grieuously, lamenting much that the King should take his enemies to serue in their roomes. And so with teares,  they prostrated themselues at the feet of Alexander, requiring him to be more satisfied with punishing them, then with putting them to shame. By which submission they obtained, that Eleauen thousand of the old Souldiers were discharged. And of his friendes there were dismissed, Polyperchon, Clytus, Gorgias, Polidamas, and Antigonus: because they were olde Men and by reason thereof not able any longer to endure the trauels of warfarre. Craterus had the charge of such as were sent awaye, vvith commffion to take vppon him Antipater displaced the regynent of Macedon, in the place and stead of Antipater.
                  
                  
                     Antipater in like manner vvas commaunded to come vvith a number of young Souldiers to supply the Roome of Craterus. They that returned home  had their allovvaunce of vvages in as ample sorte, as if they had still follovved, and continued the warres. While these things vvere doing, Ephestion (one The death of Ephestian, & the great mag nificence of his Toombe. of Alexanders friendes) deseased, vvhom he loued most entirely, both for his excelient beauty, vvhen he vvas borne, and for his humble obedience in his Mans estate. For him Alexander mourned a long time, and that in more extremity, then vvell became the condition of a king to doe: bestovving tvvelue thousand talents vpon a Tombe for him: and giuing commaundement to honor him as a God. In his vvay as he vvas returning tovvardes Babylon, from the furthest landes, that bordered vpon the Ocean, tydings vvere brought him, that the Ambassadors of Carthage, and other Citties of Affrik, 
                      and also of Spaine, Sicill, France, Sardinia, and many other places of Italy, did vvait for his comming to Babilon. So great a terror had the fame of his name striken into the harts of all the world, that all Nations, as if they had determined to acknowledge him for their Soueraigne Lord, were glad to fawne on him.
                  
                     
For this cause, as he was making speed to Babylon, (to hold a parliament of the whole world) one of the wise men gaue him aduice to refrain his com ming there, for it was the fatall place of his death. Vpon this he left Babylon and went to the Citty Byarse, beyond Euphrates, which but of late lay desolate. There Anaxarchus the Phylosopher, perswaded him to despise the sayings of the wisemen as false and vncertaine. For, looke what was determined by destiny, Men could no way be priny vnto: if once ordained by the law of Nature, it was not possible for man to auoyd them.
                  Returning therefore to Babylon, when many daies had been ydely consumed, he began anew his feastings and ryot, which of some long time hee had refrayned: and giuing himselfe wholy thereunto, he spent his time day  and night, in nothing but lasciuious reuelling. Immediatly vpon a banket, the Physician Thessalus made a reare-supper, and inuited the king and al his Lordes thereunto, where Alexander taking a cup in his hande, as he was in Alexander is poisoned. the middest of his draught, he sodainly gaue a great sighe, as though he had been pearsed at the hart with the point of a dagger and being carried from the banquet halfe dead, was soterribly tormented with intollerable paine, that he desired a sworde to take away his life, and when hee was touched by any man, it was so grieuous to him as if they had wounded him. His friends caused it to be blowne abroade, that his excessiue drinking was the cause of  this disease: but indeed it was their owne treason, the slaunder wherof was soone suppressed by the power of them that succeeded.
                  The author of this treason was Antipater, who seing his most dear friends murthered, his sonne in law Alexander of Lyncest, put to death, and himself The pr

(after his many Nobles enterprizes atchieued in Greece) reaped rather disdaine then respect, for all his labour; and drawne likewise thereunto by diuers complaints made vnto him by Olympias Alexanders mother: considering further, what extremity and cruell execution, was but euen a little before done vpon the Licutenants of sundry countries, he coulde not but gather by the premisses, that he himselfe also was not sent for out of Macedon, 
                      to attend him in his warres, but to abide the punishment that others had formerly receiued.
                  To preuent therefore the kings purpose, he sent his sonne Cassander priuily with poyson: the which Cassander, with Phillip and Iohn his brothers, were wont to serue the king at his table. The force of the poyson was such, The poyson not to be caried but in the hoose of a Horse. that neyther brasse, yron, nor earthen vessell was able to hold it, nor coulde it be caried otherwise then in the hoose of an horsse, giuing especial charge vnto his sonne, that he should put trust in no man, saue Thessalus & his brothers. For this cause was the banquet prepared in the house of Thessalus, Philip and Iohn, which were wont to be the kinges Tasters and cup-bearers,  had the poison in cold water, and cast it vpon Alexanders drinke: the fourth day after, Alexander perceiuing there was no way with him but death, acknowledged the destiny of the house of his Auncestors, for the Aecides died ere they attayned the age of thirty yeares.
                  Then he appeased his Souldiers, which began to grow mutinous, and to make an vprore, in mistrusting that the king was killed by treason, and being

                  To many of them he gaue directions to recommend him to their friends, and to doe errands to them for him. Thus as his heart was inuincible towards his Enemy, so was it not to be daunted with the danger of death. When he had dismissed his Souldiers, he demaunded of his friendes standing about him, if they thought euer to haue the like king againe: wherat euery man holding his  peace, he spake himselfe, saieng, that though he knew not that, yet he prefectly knew and prophecied yea, and in manner saw it before his eies, how much blood should be spent by Macedon in that quarrell, and with how great slaughter it should keepe his funerals after his departure.
                  At the last he willed his body to be buried in the Temple of Hammon. And when his friends perceiued him to draw on, and euen at point to giue vp the ghost, they asked who should be heire of his Empire, he answered, The worthiest. So great was his magnanimity, and courage of heart, that whereas hee left behind him his sonne Hercules, his brother Arideus, and his wife Roxanes 
                      great with child, yet he forgot them all, both kindred, and alience, and pronounced him to be his heire that was worthiest. As if it had not beene lawfull for any to succeed a conqueror, but a Man of courage, and valour. Or to leaue the riches of so great a kingdome to any, that had not proued himselfe a man in the proceedings of Martiall dissipline. With these wordes (as though he had sounded a Trumpet among his Nobility, and sowne the seede of debate and mischiefe) euery one harboured enuy in his heart against other, and with coulorable flattery priuily sought the fauour of the men of warre.
                  The sixt daie when his speech was gone, he tooke the ring from his finger, and deliuered it to Perdicas, the which appeased the dissention of his friends,  the which was euen ready to begin amongst them. For although he was not prouounced heire by word of mouth, yet it seemed it was his minde he should succeed him. Alexander deseased at the age of three and thirty yeares, and one moneth: a man endued with stoutnesse of courage, and beyond the condition of Mans fraile nature. The same night that his mother Olimpias conceiued him, she dreamed she had to do with a great Dragon, neither was she deceiued of the gods in her dreame, for out of all doubt she bare in her wombe, a worke of nature exceeding farre the conceipt of humaine power or capacity. Tokens that appeared at the death of Alexander. And albeit she was much renowned both for the house of Aeacus, from whence by auncient descent of so many hundreth yeares, she was lineally conueied:  as also, for that her father, brother, husband, and al her auncestors were kings: yet was she in none of these respects so much to be aduanced, as by her owne sonne.
                  Many wonderfull fortokens of his greatnes apeared at the time of his birth.

For the same day that he was borne, two Eagles stood all day on the top of his fathers house, representing a signe of his double Empire of Europe, and Asia. The very same day also his father receiued tydings of two victories. The one of a battel against the Illirians, the other of the gaming at the mountaine Olimpus, vnto which he had sent his chariots. Which things were tokens that the childe should be Conqueror of all countries. During his childhood, he was brought vp and kept to his learning very straightly. When he came to mans estate, he profited much in knowledge for siue years space vnder Aristotle, the most famous Philosopher. Afterward when he had taken the kingdome vpon him, he proclaimed himselfe king of all lands, and of the whole world. And he so behaued himselfe among his Souldiors, that  if he were present with them, no enemy could daunt their corages, or make them afraid, though themselues had bene naked, and vnarmed. He neuer encountred with any enemy, but he ouercame him. He neuer besieged Citty, but he wan it: ho neuer entred any country, but he subdued it. Yet at last he was ouercome, not by force of the enemy. But by the falfehood, and treason of his owne subiects.

                     WHen Alexander had thus left the World in the flower of his age, and the glory of his conquests: all menne were stricken into heauinesse and admiration, especially the Citty of Babylon: But the Nations whom hee had brought to his subiection, could not giue credite to the report, because as they beleeued him to bee inuincible, so likewise they thoght him to be immortall;  calling to remembrance how often he had beene deliuered from present death, and his weapon being lost, not only shewed himselfe sodainly sound and in safety, but also getting the vpper hand and victory. But when they were thoroughlie perswaded that he was dead indeed, all the barbarous Nations that he had conquered but a little before, mourned for him, not as an enemy, but a father vnto them. Moreouer the mother of Darius, hearing of Alexanders death, was not more tormented with The heauines of Enemies, and reioicing of the Macedons for the death of Alexander. griefe for the losse of her sonne, or her owne downefall from so high estate, as she sorrowed to see that day: Not that she set more by her enemy, then by her sonne, but because his clemency and fauour was so great being a conqueror, and she had found the naturall loue of a sonne in him, when she feared  him as her enemie.
                  The Macedons contrariwise mourned not for him, as for their countreyman, or for their king of such high and great Maiesty, but reioyce as if they had lost an enemy, his seuerity was such, and the continuall ieopardies that he put them to by the warres. The Princes also gaped on euery side, for the

But it was not for nothing that the Noblemen of Alexander did so looke for the kingdome. For they were all of that prowesse and magnanimity, that euery one in his carriage represented the maiesty and condition of a king.
                  They were all of such excellent beauty, and fauour, of so tall, and goodly personages, of so great strength, and wisdome, that he to whom they had  not bene knowne, would not haue thought they had bene of one countrey, but elected rather and chosen from the vtmost partes of the world. Neither The choisest men of the kingdome. did Macedon nor any countrey before that time, euer flourish with such a number of Noblemen, as first Phillip, and then Alexander with good aduisement, had pickt and chosen foorth; not somuche to serue the warres, as to succeed in the kingdome. Who can then maruell that the world was subdued by such men of seruice? seing the Army of Macedon was guided by so many, not captains, but kings: who could neuer haue bin matched by others, had they not fallen at contention betweene themselues. For if that enuy and emulation of their owne puissance, had not stirred them vp to selfe-destruction, they should haue had many Alexanders for the losse of one. But after  the time of Alexanders death; they assembled themselues together, not anye one fearing the other, or mistrusting the men of warre, whose libertye was now more large, and fauor vncertaine.
                  Among themselues the equalitie encreased the discorde, no one man so farre exceeding the rest, that any would subscribe to submission. They assembled therefore all in armor in the pallace, to set matters in order for the Great emula tion amongst the Nobility and Wa

If they had rather haue a young man, there was in the campe aridens, the Brother and companion of Alexander, one that was beloued of all men, not for his own sake only, but for King Phillips sake, his father.

Ptolomy, refused to haue Aridens made King, not onely for his Mothers basenesse, for he was begotten of a Concubine of Larissa, but for his continual sicknes, which was so great, that it was like to dishable the gouernment, and sway of so high a place. Therefore he thought it better for them, to make choice of some of

those, which for their prowesse had bene neerest about the King, that they might rule the prouinces, and take charge of the warres, rather then vnder the colour of a King, to be at the commaundement of vnworthy persons. At length by the consent of them all, the sentence and opinion of Perdicas took place, and so it was esteemed fit to tarrie the deliuerance of Roxanes: and if Perdica

When the horsemen had done the like, the footemen disdaining that they were made priuie to no part of their doings, proclaimed Aridens alexanders brother to be their King: and chose him a Guard of his owne kindred, giuing him the name of his father King Phillip. When tidings hereof  came to the horsemen, they sent attalus, and Meleager Ambassadors, being two of the Noblemen, to appease their wrath; Who seeing preheminence by pleasing the multitude, relinquisht their message, and condiscended to the Souldiors. Foorthwith the tumult increased, as soone as councell had gotten head, and directions.
                  Then prepared for the purpose, they violently rushed into the place, with intent to destroy the men of arms, who vnderstanding what peril they stood Common between the hor

Neither did the hatred of the Noble men cease, for attalus was sent to kil Perdicas of the contrary  part, who being armed, shewed himselfe of such corage, that they that were sent to strike him, durst not approach or come neere him: Whereupon his boldnesse was such, that of his owne free will he went to the footmen, and assembled them together, laying to their charge what a heinous matter they attempted, and willing them to haue respect, against whom they took weapon in hand: not against the Persians, but the Macedons; not against their enemies, but their owne countrimen: many of them their kinsmen, and most of them, their companions in arms & partakers of their perils. Wherfore they ought rather to make a good shew to thetr enemies, that they may Perdicas his Oration to them that came to

                  When Perdicas had with his singular eloquence fully debated these matters, he so mooued the footmen thereby, that by common consent he was chosen their Captaine generall. The horsemen also being brought to attonement, consented to take aridens for K. reseruing a part of the kingdome for the sonne of Alexander, if any should be borne. This did they, laying the bodie of alexander, amongst them, that he might be a witnesse of their decrees. These things thus set at a stay, Antipater was made regent of Macedon, 
                      and Greece. Craterus appointed to bee high Treasorour. The charge of the campe, the hoast, and matters of warfarre committed to Meleager, and Perdicas. Aridens himselfe being assigned to conuey the corse of Alexander to the temple of Hammon. Then Perdicas sore displeased with the authors of the sedition, without knowledge of Meleager, the next day commanded a sodaine search to be made in the campe for the death of the King.

Perdycas perceauing that the world went not on his side, sent for arydius, and great Alexanders sonne (of whom the charge was committed vnto him) to haue them come out of Cappadocia, and giue their aduice as concerning the order of the warres. Some were of opinion to remoue the warre into Macedon, to the very welspring and head of the kingdome, because Olimpias was there, who being Alexanders mother would be no smal stay on their side, for the fauour of cominalty in the remembrance of Phillip and Alexander.

To assist him, were appointed Alcetas the brother of Perdicas & Neoptolemus, with their Armies. Clytus was made chiefe admiral of the sleete. Cilicia was taken from Philotas, and giuen to Phyloxenus, and Perdicas himselfe with a great army went towards Egipt. So Macedon, through the discord of the Captaines, deuiding themselues into two parts, set her weapons against her owne bowels, turning the furnitur of warre that was appointed  for the forren Enemy, to the slaughter of her owne inhabitants, like mad men intending to mangle the handes and members of their owne body.

Further, he so enlarged his kingdome by conquering the citty Cyrene, that by means therof he was now become a Prince of such power, that there was not such cause for him to feare his enemies, as his Enemies to be afraide of him. This citty Cyrene was builded by. Aristeus, who because he was tonguetyed, was named Battus. This Mans father called cyrenus King of the

Afterwards in processe of time, there fel such a pestilence among them for their stubbornnesse, that they were compeld to obey the commandment of the god, being so small a number of them, that they were scarce able to furnish one ship. 
                  
                  When they came into Affrick, both for the pleasantnesse of the place, and the aboundance of water springes, they expelled the inhabiters of the mountaine Cyra, and planted themselues in the same place. There their Captaine Battus had his tongue stringes loosed and began to speak. This encouraged their harts to build vp the rest of the citty, for that the goddes, had already performed part of his promises. Their tents therefore being pitched, they heard a

report of an olde tale. Namely that Cyrene, a maide of excellent beauty was rauished by Apollo in the mountaine Peluis in Thessaly, and caried from thence to the toppe of this mountaine, where the goddes begat her with child: and when she had gon her time, was deliuered of foure Sonnes, Nomius, Aristeus, Eutecus, and Ageus. And that her father Hypseus king of Thessaly, sent out men to seeke her, who inticed with the pleasantnesse of the place, aboad still with the maide in that country. Of which children when they came to estate, three returned into Thessaly, and possessed their grand-fathers kingdome: but Aristeus had a large dominion in arcady, and first taught the vse of bees, and Honey, of Milke, and creame, and first founde out the times of the yeare,  when the Sunne is at the higest in Summer, and at the lowest in winter, with the courses of the other Starres. Vpon which report, Battus learning the name of the maiden by the oracles, builded the Citty Cyrene. Ptolomy therefore increased in strength by the power of this citty, prepared for the warre against Perdicas comming.
                  But the hatred that Perdycas had gotten thorough his passing pride, did him more harme then the power of his Enemies. For his owne companions hating P

Neoptolemus also being left to assist Eumenes, purposed not only to turne vnto the contrary parte, but also to be tray the whole host of his adherents. Which pretence when Eumenes, had  espied, he had no other shift, but to try the matter against the traitor by the sword. Neoptolemus being vanquished fled to antipater, & Polyperchon perswading them that if they would keepe on their iourney without staying, they might fall vnawares vpon Eumenes, who now ioying sor his late victory, was secure and without care, in that he had put him to slight.
                  But his purpose was not vnknowne to Eumenes, therefore the treason turned vpon the traitors heads. For they which thought to haue surpryzed him ere he was aware, were met withall themselues, when they least looked for it, hauing watched all the night, and wearied with trauell. In that encounter Polyperchon had his deaths-wounde, and escaped not. Neoptolemus also fighting Polyperchon and Neoptolemus slayne. hand to hand with Eumenes a great while together, after many hurts giuen, and  receiued, was in the end ouercome and slaine. Eumenes therefore getting the vpper hand in two pitched fields together, vp held his side for a time, which was not a little impaired by the reuolting of his adherents. Neuerthelesse at the last when Perdicas was slaine, both he, and Phyton, Illirius, and alcetas the brother of Perdicas, were proclaymed Traytors by the hoste of their enemies, and antigonus was appointed to make warre against them.

And to the end he might try whether their mindes were any way bent against him, or no: and intending to proceede according as he saw them inclined, he boldly protested amongst them, that if any mans hart failed him, he should haue liberty and lycence to depart. the which speech so perswaded them all to fauour  his proceedings, that they bad him be of good comfort, and promised to repcale the decrees of Alexander by the sword.
                  Then did he remoue with his host into Aetalia, where he raised a taxe of the cittyes, and such as refused to bestow it vpon him, he sacked them like an enemie. From thence he went to Sardus, vnto cleopatra the sister of great Alexander that by hir words, the captaines and chiefe officers might be the more strengthened to stand in his quarrell. For he was of opinion that the maiesty of the kingdome was on that side, which the Sister of Alexander held with. So much reuerence was attributed to the greatnesse of Alexander, that men sought the sauou

When he returned into his tent, letters were found dispersed thorough all the campe, wherein were promised great rewardes to him that would bring Eumenes head vnto Antigonus. Eumenes hauing knowledge hereof, summoned his souldiers before him, and first gaue them thankes, that none of them would be sound to preser the hope of a bloody reward before his faithfull oath.
                  Then he polly tikly knit vp the matter, saying that those letters were deuised

by himselfe to try the minds of his souldiers, and that it lay in all their handes to saue him, or cast him away, excusing antigonus, or any other of the Captaines, that in such manner they couetted to get the vpper hand, or to giue any such wicked example to others to do the like by him. By this he both stayed Fumenes

Euery Man therefore stroue who might be most for the safeguard of Eumenes. In the meane season came Antygonus against them with his host, and resting himselfe in his campe for that night, brought forth his men in battell ray the next morning: neither did Eumenes detract the encounter,  but being put to the worse, fled into a certaine strong hold, where perceiuing himselfe driuen to abide the aduenture of the siege, he dismist the greater part of his Army, doubting least by consent of such a multitude he might be betrayed of his Enemies, or else be pestred with the number of Men. Then sent he ambassadors to antipater, who was able to match antigonus. Antygonus hearing that antipater had sent to rescue Eumenes, brake vp his siege and went his way.
                  Thus was Eumenes deliuered from fear of death, but hee could not long continue in safety, seing he had sent away his men of warre. Therfore when he  had looked about him, he thought it best to resorte to the Argyraspides that Fumene

                  Eumenes entreated and spake gently to euery of them, calling them somtimes his sellowes and companyons in armes, sometimes his patrones and defendours, other whiles his partakers of all daungerous attemptes and enterprises in the East: boasting that they onely were the men by whose puissaunce the East was subdued, which had surmounted the monuments of Hercules: that by them alexander was made great: by them he obtained to honour and immortall  glory, beseeching them to receiue him amongst them, not so much for a captaine, as for one of their fellowes, and that they would giue him leaue to be one of their society. Being vpon this condition entertained, by little and litle, first with admonishing euery man apart, and afterward with gentle correcting such thinges as were doone amisse, he vsurped authority ouer them. Nothing could be done in the campe without him, nothing could be attempted without his aduice. At the length when it was told him antigonus came against him with an army, he compelled them to put themselues in order of battell so that whiles they disdained to be ruled by their captain, by force of their enemies

                     Eumenes the author of this their losse and discomfiture, hauing none other comfort or refuge to fly vnto, beganne to harten and encourage them when they were vanquished and ouercome: affirming that they were surperior as touching their prowesse and puissance: For they had slaine

                     ue thousand

of their enemies, and if they were minded to sticke to it to the vttermost, they should see their enemies faine to sue to them for peace. As for the losses and damage whereby they thought themselues so much hindred, it was but onely two thousand women, and a few children and bondmen, the which they might better recouer by getting the victory, then by forsaking the victory for wante of courage.
                  The Argyraspides made answer, they would neither attempt to run away with the losse of their wiues and bedfellowes, nor yet make warre against their owne children; where with they beganne extremely to reuile him, in that after so many yeares, when they were returned home with their wages which they had well and dearely earned, and with the rewardes of so many battels,  being at rest, and hauing giuen ouer the warres, he to come and winne them forth a new to warfare and endlesse encounters: leading them from their houses and natiue countrey, onely to delude them with vaine promises: also after they had lost the hope and profit of their prosperous warfare, could not be content to suffer them being thus vanquished, to lead the rest of their wretched old age in quietnesse.
                  Hereupon without knowledge of their captaines, they sent messengers to antigonus, whereupon he desiring restitution of their goodes sent them word Conspiracy against Eumenes againe, he would restore euery whit, so that they would yelde Eumenes into his  handes. Eumenes hearing of this practise, attempted with a few scattering souldiers to escape by flight: but being sent back againe, seeing no hope of recouery, as the multitude slocked about him, he made request that he might yet once before he dyed, speake vnto his army.
                  They willed him to say his mind. Silence being made, and his bandes losed, hee stretched forth his hands fettered as they were, and shewed them, saying. Behold my Souldiers the apparell and ornaments of your Captaine, Fumenes his O

                  Foure times within this twelue month, you haue sworne to be true to me, but I will let that passe. For it is not meet for men in aduersity, to vpbraide others. This onely one thing I require at your hands, that if Antigonus be so fully bent to take my head from me, as in whose death all his affaires and purposes should be finished, you will let mee die among you. For I am sure he cares not after what sort, or where I die, so I be dead, neither doe I passe greatly for my life, so I might be deliuered from this slaunderous death. If you will graunt me this request, I discharge you of your oath, whereby you haue bound your selues so often vnto me. Or if ye be ashamed to slay mee your selues, then reach me a weapon, and giue me leaue to do that thing for  you, without conscience of breaking off your oath, which you haue sworne so oftentimes to do for your Captaine.
                  When he saw he could not obtaine his request, he left intreatance and fel to anger. Now the Goddes said he, the iust reuenger of periury, looke vpon you, you false forsworne kaitiues, and giue such ends vnto you, as you haue giuen vnto your Captaines. For it is not long ago, since you polluted

your selues with the blood of Perdicas, practising to haue done the like with Antipater, yea and that is worst of all, you oftentimes troubled euen Alexander himselfe with your seditions and mutinies; doing your best to haue slain him, if it had bene possible for him to haue died of mans hande. And last of all you seeke my blood, which shall be offred as a sacrifice by you false forsworne wretches, wherefore I pray the Goddes, that these curses may light vpon you, that being beggers and Outlawes, you may spend all your life in this warfare, like banished people, neuer to returne to your country again, and your owne weapons deuour you, with the which you haue consumed mo captaines of your owne, then of your enemies.
                  This spoken, in a great rage and anger he commaunded his kepers to go  before him to Antigonus campe. The army followed after to betray their owne captaine, and he being prisoner, led as it were a tryumphe of himselfe They

In that whereas Alexander conquered the East, Antigonus ouercame them by whom the East was conquered. 
                  
                  
                     Antigonus therefore dispersed those Conquerors of the worlde into his hoast, making restitution vnto them of such thinges as hee had taken from them at the time of this onerthrowe. And because he had in times past familiar acquaintance and friendship with Eumenes he woulde not for shame suffer him to come in his sight, but assigned him two keepers.

The like commaundement she sent also to antigonus in Asia. By which benefit Cassander being bound vnto her, did euery thing after her rash and vnaduised commaundement.

Moreouer all the priuate possessions of Demetrius, which he had ransackt out of his tents, he restored, sending him word, that he made warre not for gaine, but for honor; not for treasure, whose glory must determine, but for the dignity of vertue, whose Trophes are perpetual.

So great did they account it modesty in themselues, albeit euery one ofthem, had seuerally the riches and power of a King, yet to forbeare the publike rule of Kinges, while Alexander had any rightfull Heyres to succeede.
                  But now Ptolomy, Cassander, and the Captaines of their port, perceiaing  that while euery one drew defence for himselfe, made warre alone, and vnited not their generall power togither, nor assisted one another, as thoughe they had one vniuersall bodie, or reioice as it were in one good. But thus deuided, Antigonus licked them vp by turnes: they therefore sent letters of perswasion and encouragment, apointing a place of meeting, where they so agreed, that they laid their powers togither for one Warre: and where they were before like sand, subiect to dissipation, by the violence of euery winde, this temper had made them sollude, and sitte for anie foundation. At this meeting, for as much as Cassander could not be then present in person, compeld by the Warres which he was then excercised in against the borderors,  he sent Lysimachus with a selected and choice hoast, to the aide of this coaiunction.

The cause from whence he grounded this murther was this; After the death of her husband, when the kingdome should haue beene deuided betweene the two brothers, she seemed to be more fauorable to Alexander, then to him. Alexander mooued by this so slight occasion, prepared for reuengfull warre against his brother, for his mothers death, and for expedition thereof  he desired of Demetryus, whom he found easily entreated to that purpose: though indeede not so much for his assistance, as hope he had thereby to leauell out sit opportunity himselfe to inuade the kingdome.

Before that, he had not comitted a murther, but only preuented Treasons against himselfe, vrging their owne Iudgments for witnesse, that  there was greater reason and it was more fit, himselfe to be a king then Alexander, both for the aduantage of yeares, by which he was able with deeper and grauer experience, as also indued with fortitude, both of body and minde, the fruite of which, reapt but with due consideration, would well satisfie them that they are the very collums and cement that vpholds a common-wealth.
                  Besides, he vrged his father had accompanied the father and the sonne Phillip and great Alexander, in all their warres, and after had done seuice for Alexanders children, bin their Captaine or rather general, in pursuing the Rebels, whereas on the contrary part, Antipater the grandfather of the young men, was alwaies a more rough gouernor of the kingdome, then the Kings themselues,  and Cassander their father the very rooter vp of the Kings house, and extirper of Alexanders royall famely.

The reuenge of which mischiefe, though his will had not power to execute one Cassander himselfe, it is now but iustly transfered vnto his children, whereof both Phillip and Alexander, if the dead had any perseuerance, would speake in approbation of the vengance, and auer that it is their will, no branches descended from such infected rootes, no yssue from their seditious loynes, but rather the loppers off of such vnprofitable stumps, and punishers of such intestine traytors, should establish the kingdome of Macedon.

Machaeus therefore was sent with a power from Athens, to constraine them delyuer that by force, they so obstinatly hadde denied. But while he forraged about to wast their fieldes, and make pillage of what he could, his fleete that he left in the Rhode was sunk, and the greater part of his army by the force and extreame violence of a sodaine tempest, were all put to wrack. Therefore not being able to returne by Sea, his shippyng being lost, nor durst  not aduenture his trauell by land, with so slender a defence, thorough so many sauage Countryes as he had from thence to passe: the Heraclyens reputing it more honor to vse this occasion, in shewing to those their distressed enemies bountifull curtisie, then bloodye reuengement, both furnished them with victuals, and safely conducted them home; accounting the wasting of their contry and danger they had sustained by them satisfied to the full, if they might hereby win their enemies to be their friends.

                  He also earnestly sued by his letters, to be possest in the ancient amitie of his brother king of egypt, protesting that al inueterate malice and displeasure, which hee had against him, for vsurping his fathers kingdome from him, was now dissoluted: and that he would not thence, endeuour to wrest from his brother, the sway of Emperor, since he had now with more honor, and more

                     AT this time that Pirrhus was king of Epyre, the Tarentines, Samuits, and Lucanes, were grieuously vexed with The wars of Pyrrhus in Italy. the warre of the Romaines; in which necessety of theirs, they sent their seuerall ambassadors, to intreate his aide; who not so much moued by the importunity of these suters,  as induced with hope to compasse the Empire of Italy, vnder his owne dominion promised them succour, and to come presently with an army to remoue that affliction incident vnto them: vnto which affaires after his minde had thus inclinde, following the examples of his ancestors, and to demonstrat to the world he had an honourable qualltiy of his parents, he draue himselfe desperatly forward into all hazzards, disdaining to be accounted inferiour to his vncle Alexander, who had defended the Tartarians against the Brucians: or oflesse courage then great Alexander, who had made warres farre distant from his owne Countrey, and subdued the East. Whereupon leauing his sonne  
                     Ptolomy, of the age of fifteene yeares as Regent ouer his kingdome, he landed his Army in the hauen of Tarent, leading along with him his two younger sonnes, Hellen and Alexander to beare him company, and be a comfort to him in this voyage, so farre remote from his Countrey.

assembled: so brought his men into the field euen to the enterview, where Pirrhus was incampt; who on the contrary, held it cowardise to eschew the battell offerd, though the number of the enemies force, far surmounted his. Both armies being arraid, and the assault begun, the Romaines at the first forced them to retrait, and chasing that aduantage they were Maisters of, were euen at the point to haue put him and his whole power, either to slaughter or flight: But Pirrhus retiring no further then the backe of his Elephantes Pyrrhus ouer commeth the Romans. constraind the Romaines at the sight of those beasts of Macedon, to which till then they wer neuer inurd, first to stand as amazed, and by and by to forsake the field; so from a conquest, which but euen nowe was iudged certaine by  them, they had suddenly the ouerthrow themselues: Neuerthelesse, Pirrhus obtained not this honor without much bloodshed, for he himselfe was dangerously wounded, & a great part of his soldiors slain, so that he gained by this victory more renowne then cause to reioyce. Many citties folowing the fortune of this battell, yeelded themselues to Pirrhus, among which, the Locrins betraying the Roman Garrison, reuolted to him, of which prey Pirrhus sent home two hundred Roman souldiors ransomelesse to Rome, to the intent that as the Romaines had trusted the carriage and puissance of his body, they should as well see he had the like liberallity and magnanimousnesse of mind. Shortly after, the hoast of the Tarentines and the others congregated  to him, and the Romaines likewise releeued their dispersed Tyrians with sit The magnificence of Pyrrhus. supply, there was another encounter vndertaken betweene them, wherein his fortune was like vnto the former, and his worthinesse appeared no lesse. The Carthagentans hearing of this prosperity of Pirrhus, sent Mago one of their Captaines with a hundred and twenty ships, in the aid of the Romains, who comming before the Senat, told them, it greatly grieued the Carthagenians his countrimen, and their neighbors and friends, that a forraine K. should be so powerfull to make Warre in Italy, for which he was sent to offer them that ready aid, knowing no reason but they being assailed by a forraine enemy might iustly be rescued by forraine sucor: the Senat gaue him in the right of the Carthagenians thankes, but dismist him and their succors  accounting them needlesse. But Mago subtile, according to the nature and inclination of the men of Affrica, as though his affaires tended to proclaime peace, went secretly to Pirrhus, entending to sift his determination, and to learne what he purposed as concerning Sicill, whether it was reported Pirrhus was sent for: for howsoeuer it was otherwaies pretended, the Carthagenians sent aide to the Romaines for no other end, but that since Pirrhus was arriued, he might be so occupied with the Romaines in Italy, he should finde no leisure to passe on to Sicill. Pirrhus hauing prosperity thus farre as it wer intaild to him; Fabritius Lucinus was sent Ambassadour from the Senate of  
                     Rome, to conclude a peace wtih him. The articles agreed vppon, for confirmation thereof, cineas was dismist from Pirrhus, with gifts and honorable presents to the Romaines, but such was the continency of them, that hee returned without finding anye man whose handes were open to receiue his Maisters rewardes. Another example to equallize this staiednesse of the Romaines, happened in the same time much about this, for the senat sending

Ambassadors to Ptolomy, into Egypt: the King accustomed to gratifie such Messengers with royall benefites, presented them with the like, the which they modestly deemed, yet before their departure being solemnely inuited to feast with the King, there were commended vnto them seueral crownes of gold, which for that time for the honor of Ptolomy, though they refused no

                  This Nation of the Tyrians had their first foundation by the Phenecians, who before being troubled with an Earthquake, forsook their Natiue soile, and inhabited first by the lake of Assiria, and from thence remoouing themselues nearer to the Sea coast, they builded a Citty, which of the abundance of Fish that had breeding there, they named it Sidon. In this continent they  continued longe, but at last being subdued by the King of the Ascalonites, they tooke shipping, and arriued in the same ground whereon they builded Tyre: which Citty, was finished the yeare before the destruction of Troy. In this neither remaind they in peace, but were often affailed by the Warres of the Persians.
                  
                  But their power much wasted by this warre, and the multitude of the bondmen exceeding their Masters; they pretended to exemplifie their sauage nature vpon them, whom they were bound to obey: which conspiracy, by the Bondmen

The other bondmen ignorant that any Masters or free-born generation wer aliue, began to consult of the estate of gouernment; and agreed that it was requisit for the security of them all, to incorporat the Citty to themselues and create aking, and him especiallye (as a man most acceptable to the Goddes,) that first should see the next morrow. This honest slaue declared this secretly to his Maister Strato (for so was the old man named) crauing therein the furtherance of his aduise: so being by him sufficiently instructed what to do, while all the rest stood staring into the East, he only aduisedly loked into the West. At the first, all the residue of his fellowes, thought it madnesse in him to gape for the Sunne rising in the West. But assoone as the day began to  breake, and the East glistered vppon the highest tops and pinnacles of the Towers and Temples of the Cittie, while all the rest gazed, who should see the Globe of the sunne, he first of all shewed them the brightnesse thereof, shining vpon the top of the Cittie. This made them so iust to iudge against themselues, to be a reason greater then could grow out of slaues: whereupon they inquired who gaue him this counsell, who vnwilling to attribute the dignity was dew to another, confessed the truth as concerning his Master, so that they euidently perceiuing the difference of true iudgement, between a slaue and a Gentleman, and that thogh their owne natures might excel in malice, yet the other exceeded in wisdome, the old man and his sonne they The

After whose decease, the kingdome discended to his sonne, and so colatterally, foorth to his posterity. Which act of these slaues, though it were notable and a necessarie example to succeeding ages, yet Alexander the great, hauing continued long warre in the countries of the East as a reuenger, raisd war vpon them, who had bin enemies to a common tranquility, besieged and sacked the citty, commanding all those to be hung vp, that remained aliue after the battell: executing iustice on the posterity  in remembrance of the murthers committed in former time by their predecessors; only the kindred of Strato preserued, and restored the kingdome to his offspring, peopling it with free-born families, to the intent that the slauish seed being rooted out, the offspring of those might liue to report they were planted by him. These Tyrians being thus by Alexander a Nation new founded through trauell, and sparing in spending, grew as strong againe in short time as before the slaughter of their Masters: so that thus again replenished, they sent a company of youth into Affrick, and built vp Vtica.

                  Thus a great number of the nobility, were in readinesse to set forth with hir, and hauing made sacrifice to Hercules, they forsooke their countrey to seeke a new dwelling place. The first land that they arriued at, was the Isle of Syprus,

By this meanes, they that fled had leysure to escape, and Elissa safelie arriued on the coastes of Affrick, won the heartes of al the inhabitants. After, hauing gotten a peece of ground, euen as muche as might be compassed with an Oxe hyde, and therin she refreshed her whole company, then caused she the hide to be cut into thongs, and by this pollicie got a very large plot, wherupon that place was called Birsa. After, many of the inhabitants brought unto them many things to sel, and built them houses, so in time it became a famous citty. The ambassadors of Vtica brought them rich presents: also the Affricans were very desirous of their companie, so that by the helpe of al parties Carthage was builded, paying onely a yeerly rent for the The building of Carthage. ground.

When Carthage flourished, Hiarbas king of Mauritania calling ten Princes of the Africks, sent for Elissa to be his wife, and if she denied he threatned warre. Which message they fearing to deliuer, wrought by craft, saying their king Hiarbas requireth Dido in mariage.requested a person to instruct his nations in ciuil life. They being rebuked of the Queen, they vttered the kings command, that she must bee conformable, to his request, or looke for further danger. Being thus deceiued she called often  on the name of her husb. Sycheus, yet at last answerd she would go whither her destiny directed. Vpon this she caused a fire to be made in the furthest parts of the citty, where after some sacrifices done, she tooke a sword standing on the top of the fire, laying according to the kings command she would goe to her husband, thrusting her body thorow with the sword. In carthage she was worshipped Dido killeth her selfe. euer after as a Goddesse. This cittye was builded 72 yeares before Rome.

When the Ambassadors could get nothing, neither by faire meanes nor by foule, within a few dayes after, they tooke shipping, and came to the Citty all in armes. 
                  
                  Being come they protested before Goddes and men, that their comming was not to offer any violence to their countrey, but onely to recouer it, and that they would shew their Countreymen that they wanted not courage in Carthage is besieged by her owne Cittizens. the former Warres, but good fortune. Hereupon they kept the Cittie from all manner of victuals, and besieged it so narrowly, that they brovghte the Carthagenians to vtter dispaire. In the mean time Cartalo, (the sonne of the banished Captaine Macheus,) as he passed by his fathers campe from Tyre, (whither he had bene sent by the Cartbagenians, to carry vnto Hercules the tenths of the booty that his father had taken in Sicill) being sent for by his father, answered he would first accomplish his duty in the publike religion,  and then would do any priuate dutie to father or mother.

                  Immediatly hereupon, he caused him to be nailed to a very high crosse in sight of all the citty, in his gorgious apparell. Within a few daies after he tooke Carthage, and summoning the people before him, complained of his wrongfull banyishment, excusing the warre which he was compelled to take in hand, full sore against his will, by reason his conquests were despised. Wherefore Carthage is taken. 
                      in as much as he had punished the oppressors of his miserable countrymen, he said he was content to pardon all the rest for his wrongfull banishment, and so hauing putten of the senators to death, he restored the citty to their former lawes againe. Notlong after, he was accused to haue gon about to make himselfe a king. Whereupon he suffered double punishment, both for working treason against his countrey, and for murthering his owne sonne. After him succeeded in the captaineship Mago, by whose knighthood both the richesse, the bounds of the Empyre, and the renowne of Carthage was greatly encreased, and augmented.

Vnder these Captaines, was warre coniunct in Sardinia, and a fielde fought against the Affricans, to withstand the arrearages they demaunded as rente for the soile whereon the Citty standeth, but as the Aphricks had the iuster quarrell, so had they the better fortune; by meanes whereof this warre concluded betweene them, by paiment of money, and not by dint of sword. In Sardinia, Hasdruball being mortally wounded, surrendred the gouernment to his brother Hamilear and died: whose death was made honorable by the mourning of the whole Citty for him, and whose life was no lesse, for he had bin eleuen times Dictator, and had had triumphs. 
                  
                  At the newes of his death, the enemy beganne to take courage, as though with their Captaine the strength of the citty had also decaid, for the Sicilians being oppressed by the Carthagenians daily iniuries, revolted to Leomeda the brother of the King of Lacedemon, whereupon was continued a long and cruell warre betweene them, the aduantage sometime inclining to the one part, sometime to the other.
                  
                     
Now Daryus king of Persia, entending to make warre against the Greeyans, sent his Ambassadors to Carthage, requesting their ayde in the furtherance of his purpose, with commaundement also, they should leaue offering of men in sacrifices and eating of dogges flesh, prescribed to them according to the manner of the Persians, rather to burne theyr dead bodyes, then to bury them in the ground. But the Carthageniens denying him aide, by reason of the troublesome warres they had with their borderers, to the entent they would not seeme disobedient in al things, willingly obayed him in the rest. In the meane season Hamilcar was slaine in the warres in Sycill, leauing behind him three sonnes, Amilco, Hanno, and Gisgo: Hasdruball had also alike number of sonnes, Hamil

                  By these Captaynes were the affaires of Carthage ordered, and the citty defended, warre was made against the Moores, fieldes fought with the Numidians, and the Affricks compelled to release the Carthageniens for euer, of the rent they were wont to pay for the soyle of the citty. After this so great a number of Graund Captaynes being held burthenson to the citty, which before time had bin free, in that they built or peruerted all affaires euen to their owne opinion, that they acquit or condemned, whom or what they lift themselues: there were a hundred Senatours chosen to be Iudges, which when any of these Captaines were returned from their warres, should take an vpright account of  their actions, to the entent they thereby might be kept in awe, so to behaue themselues in executing the office of their authoritye in the warres abroad, as they might neuerthelesse haue a carefull respect to do Iustice according to the lawes of their countrey at home.
                  For directing the warre in Sicil, in the stead of Hamilcar, Hamilco was made graund captaine: who hauing prosperous successe in all battels, both by sea and land, suddainely by the influence of a pestilent planet, lost all his men of Hamilco made grand-Captaine. warre: whereof when tydings came to carthage, the harts of all the citty was cast into mourning, and there eies sawe no other comfort but teares: the lamentation was as Hideous, as though the citty had bin sackt by their enemies, and their griefe so genearal, that they releiued one anothers sorow, not suffring  it to lessen as a ceaselesse fountaine, through seuerall pipes seedes many cundits. Euery mans doores were shut vp, the Temples of the goddes vnuisited, and theyr alters vnhallowed: all ceremonies were omitted, all priuate duties neglected, some would walke out at the citty gate (but so dispersed and disordered, as if their feare had taught them to forget theyr former acquaintance) where they would make inquisition for their friendes, of that poore remaine, the plague had left, as they landed out of the shippes, where hauing heard the Tragicall of what was become of them, (for till then they waded betweene hope and feare, who was dead and who suruiued) they redoubled their griefes,  adding so fast sigh to sigh; sob, to sob; and sorrow to sorrow; till the eagernes of the one, did help the other to breake theyr harts.
                  Mothers wept for their children, fathers for their sonnes, brothers for their brothers, and one generation for another: so the shreeking and howling one made vnto another, appeared rather to be the violence of whirlewindes, or an outtragious tempest, then the perplexities of reasonable creatures. After this

While he himselfe houlding vp his hands to heauen, bewailed his owne misfortune ioyned to the calamity of his Countrey, and there withall cryed out vpon the goddes, who had taken from him so great honour of chiualrye, and so great ornaments of victories, which they themselues had giuen and made him maister of: who after the winning of so many Citties, the vanquishing of so fierce enemies, both by sea and land, had destroied that victorious army not by battell  but by pestilence, wherein notwithstanding, he with this did comfort himselfe, and brought no small cause for his countrey to reioyce in him, since that his enemies could not triumph, nor report themselus the authors of their calamities, that they were not able to say, they which were dead were slain by them: nor they which returned, were put to slight by them. As for the prey they found in their disolate campe, it was not such, that they might rightly bost of it, as of the spoile taken from their vanquished enemy, but as of a purchase falling into their enemies mouthes, vnlooked for by the pestilent deaths of the right owners, in respect of the enemy, they were come away conquerors, but in reguard of the pestilence, they sled a way vanquished. 
                  
                  But to this comfort, this honorable Captaine had one griefe, his repute exceeded all limit, which was, that his owne fate and the character of his miserable daies, had not period with his followers. That he was not so fortunat, to dye and surfet in mishap, among these most valiant men; but be reserued out of one mischiefe to fall into another: from the fury of the pestilence, not to liue pleasantly, but to be a pointing stock for the multitude, and a remembrancer of calamities
                  Wherefore so soone as he had conueied home the remnant of his wretched host into Carthage, he vowed he would follow them as their fellow; and thogh the pestilence shund him, he would chase death till he had ouertaken him:  whereby his countrey should perceiue, he had not liued to that day, as desierous of life, but because he would not by his death betray those wretched few, that the vnspeakeable pestilence had spared, by leauing them without a guide, being besiedged and enuironed round with their enemies hoastes. So entring into the citie, assoone as he came to his owne house, he dismissed the multitude, as the last time that euer he purposed to speake to them, and Hamileo killeth hunselfe. barring the doores fast, suffering none to come whereby to intercept him, not so much as his sonnes to take their leaues of him, he killed himselfe.

It is said further, that Philoctetes built the citty Thurines, whose toombe standeth yet to be seene vnruinde,  and the shaftes of Hercules, in the Temple of Apollo, which had the name of the destiny of Troy. The Metapontines also, reserued for a memory to this day, to shew in the Temple of Mynerua, the iron tooles of Epeus, their first founder, wherewith he made the horse Agent in the destruction of stately Illyrium. And for this cause, that they indeuour by these antient remembrances, to vphold their desent al that part of Italy (sur-named the greater Greece.) But in the beginning of their foundations, the Metapontines assisted in confedracy with the Sybarites and Crotoniens, after determination had, endeuored to expell al the other Grecians out of Italy: and assoone as to that purpose, they had taken the citty Siris, in the conquest thereof they killed before the sacred aulter consecrate to Minerua, fifty youngmen, imbracing her Image; neither  spared her priest at that instant veiled in the attire, accustomed in her ceremonies. Vpon this violation they were vexed with pestilence and ciuill sedition, so that the Crotonienses went first to entreate reliefe from the Oracle at Delphos, where answer was made them, that in vaine was all resistance, for the mischiefe so euident among them might not cease, till they had appeased wrathfull Mynerua; for trespassing so heynously against the deuinity due to her Godhed: as also the Ghostes of them in her Temple they had so cruelly slaine. Ciuil warres in Italy
                  
                  Hereupon, they began to carue images, of the same bignesse that the men  were, being aliue; minding to elect and set them vp, as a pacification to the youngmen. Then made they one in especiall to Minerua, but the Metapontines knowing also the Oracle of the Goddes, thought it good to worke more speedily in a buysinesse of this necessety; so they engraued as a recompence to the youngmens ghosts, little images, and appeased the Goddes indignation with bread sacrifices. So that the one part striued in costlienesse, the other part endeuoured in swiftnesse, the pestilence was ceased to both of them. The Crotoniens hauing recouered health, desiered quietnesse long after, for remembrance that in the siege of Syris, the Locrines whom they distrusted not, came as their enemies to fight against them: they take so great displeasure thereat, that in this anger they made warre vpon them. The Locrines, being  striken with feare at this sudden inuasion, resorted to the Spartanes, beseeching them humbly of succour. But the Spartanes loth to busie themseleus in a warre so farre remote from them, aduised to aske helpe of Castor and Pollux: neither did the Ambassadors dispise their counsell, but departing to the next Temple, there offered sacrifice, and inuoked the Goddes of their help: so

hauing obtained the successe they came for, (as they thought) they departed, being as iocond as if they had carried the Goddes themselues to further their prosperity.
                  They also made them shrines in their ships, & assuring thēselues of an auspicious iourney, in stead of succor they brought home comfort. This knowne to the Crotoniens, they also sent their Ambassadors to the Oracle at Delphos, praiing for victory and prosperous end of their vndertaken warre: where it was answered, they must ouercome by viewing, ere they should vanquish them by battell. Whereupon, (so desirous they were of this honor) they vowed vnto Apollo, the tenth of the profit should be taken. The Locrines on the contrary, hauing good intelligence, both of the vow of their enemies, and the answer  of the Goddes, vowed as much, but kept their deuotion priuat to themselues. So that when they were marcht into the field, and they beheld in battell array of the Crotonenses a hundred and twenty thousand fighting men, armed ready for the incounter, and knew their owne power too slen

While the Locrines were in the teror of this battel, an Eagle was seene neuer to depart from thence, but stil kept a houering and soring bout them, till they had the vpper hand. Moreouer two youngmen in strange armour, vnlike the one to the other, of excellent personage, mounted vpon two white horses, and in scarlet clokes, were seene fighting in the winges of the battell: who assoone as the difference was ended, vanquisht out of sight. The incredible swiftnes of fame increased the wonder of this accident,  for the same day this battell was fought in Italy, the victory was reported at Corinth, Athens, & Lacedemon. After this inauspicious sucesse, the Crotonenses grew carlesse to exercise themselues in chiualry and feates of armes, and as it were in the whole disposition of nature altred, by the fatall euent of that warre, which they so vnluckily attempted, changed their life into riot and idlenesse; in which spoile they had persisted, had not the Philosopher Pythagor as, staid them from this giddines, and moulded them a new with his instruction.

                  While Dennis was in readinesse with this warre, there arriued in his army Ambassadors from the frenchmen, who a few monthes before had burned Rome, desiering him to enter into league with them, and take them to his Dennis maketh league with those Frenchmen that burned Rome. friendship; aledging these reasons to mooue thereunto, that their countrey  was scituat in the hart of his enemies, by which they might and would be alwaies in readinesse, to stand him in stead, whether it were to aide him in battel, or to set on themhimself. While he was busied in their vanguarde, Dennis taking the treaty of this Ambassage to be profitable for his disseignes in hand, tooke them to the league with him, and being increased in power by their aide beganne as it were fresh warre againe in croton. The reason that moued these Frenchmen to trauell into Italy, and to seeke them out a strange habitation, was the ciuyll discord and continuall debate had among themselues, ouerwearied wherewith, arriuing in Italy they expelled the Thuscanes out of their Scttuation,

For they had prepared their army and with a greater power remoued that warres which they had broken vp by the constraint of the pestilence. The captain of this war was Hanno of carthage, whose enemy Sumator, a man at that time of the greatest power and most commaund among the Affrickes, prouokt by an inueterat malice he bore to Hanno, wrote familiarly in  
                     Greeke to Dennis, aduertising him of this army, the whole plot intended, and of the cowardise of the captaine. But his letters being intercepted by the way, he was apprehended, arraigned, and conuict of treason, and presently an act by Parliament was confirmed, that no subiect of carthage, should from thence learne Greeke letters, or study the Greeke tongue: none should haue conference with the enemy without an interpretor, nor discouer any businesse of state by writing. But this Dennis whose pride and ambitious desire neyther Sicill nor Italy were able to containe, being ouercome in all the aduentures and battels he attempted, at last his army dishartened by his ominous directions, practised his destruction, and in the end The ende of Dennis.

                     THE ARGVMENT.
                     THe younger Dennis purposeth all kind of Tyrany. He is expulsed the Realme. He useth most unspeakable Tiranny at Locres in Italy. Hee is drinen from thence and taketh Syracuse. Hanno goeth about to oppresse the commonweale of Carthage. His treasons twice betrayed, and he executed for the same. Dennis deposeth himselfe and flyeth to Corinth, where he liueth a loath some life. Hamilear  surnamed Rhodanus, followeth the doings and counselles of great Alexander, certifieth his Countreymen thereof, and at his returne is put to death for his labour.
                  
                  
                     COncerning this Tyrant Dennis thus slaine in Sicill, his men of warre placed to succeed in the soueraignty Dennis his eldest sonne; the rather for that he was grown to mans estate, as also hoping by the inauguratiō of him, the kingdome appertaining to the dignity of one would be of more validity, then if it should be diuided in many Dennis the yonger 
                      pertitions. Amongst the late Dennis sons, this Dennis in the beginning of his raign, exasperated much, to haue put to death his brothers Vncles, onely for the Iealousie he had, that he held them to be enuiers of his greatnes, and prouokers of the children to demaund, or indeed compell a distribution or partition of the kingdome: whereupon he dissembled his desire a while, and indeuored by his actions to procure the future fauor of his commons ere he would vndertake so dangerous attempt, holding it a principle for him to be gouerned by, that where opinion is once confirmed in the brests of the multitude, of the integretie of a Prince, be he neuer so distant from vprightnes, their tongues applaud  what cruelties soeuer he inacts, and conster them to be the due measure of Iustice: nay what taxes how oppressefull soeuer imposed vpon themselues, they account it, their duty to obey them, and rebellion to be resisted. To encompasse himselfe with which cloud, and as it were to walke into his Tyranies, vnseene, and vnsuspected, he discharged three hundred offenders out

of prison, released the people three yeares subsidye, was liber all of any fauors, bountifull of his courtesie, alluring their minds to him by all counterfet gentlenes, dissimulation was able to deuise, but hauing dealt with them as Fishers do by their nets, who draw them by little and little, till they attain to the end they looke for, he presently set forward the mischiefe he so longe had purposed, he slue not onely his owne, and his brothers kindred, but his brothers themselues. Insomuch that those whom he ought of right, to haue The cru

                  When he had thus dispatched his brothers, of whom more then of forraine enemies he stood in feare, thinking himself now secure, he fell to slothfulnes, and neglecting his warres to immoderat excesse & banqueting, wher by he became corpulent and vnweeldy, and had such a disease inflamed into his eyes, that he was not able to indure the Sunne, the least dust, nor the glimmering of any light. Finding this incumbrance, both in his body and sight, he beleeued himselfe to be had in disdaine of all men, vpon whom he began to execute extreame cruelties, not stuffing the

Therfore when he perceiued, that the Syracusans were prepared in readinesse to bid him battell, he was long in counsell with his Knights, whether it were more auaileable for him to depose himselfe from rule, or for the preseruation of his dignity to withstand them by force. But his men of war, in hope to haue the spoile of so wealthy a Citty, made him try the hazzard of battell.
                  Wher being vanquished, he attempted fortune the second time with successe, then sent Ambassadors to the Syracusans, promising them to depose himselfe from his Tyrany, if they woulde send commissioners vnto him, to The tteache

                      thought there was a peace considering betweene them, and dreamt not of so treacherous an Enterprize, hee sent his Army to destroy them: wherupon being thus taken vnprouided, ensued a hot and doubtful encounter euen within the Citty, but by reason the Cittizens farre in number exceeded, who fearing to be besieged, if he remaind in the castle, to which hee Dennis sheth into Italy. retired, secretly conuaid himselfe into Italy, with all his Princely apparrell, treasure and houshold stuffe, in which banishment of his he was receiued by his confederates the Locrins, who had not long time receiued him to succor, but one them also exerciced his violent cruelties. Hee inforced the Noblemens  wiues to his lust, and when their daughters were to, be giuen in marriage, he first tooke them to his desire, and hauing abused their chastity, sent them to their spouses againe: the richest Cittizens he disfranchised, seeking to put them to death, and confifcat their goods, and when he saw no more spoile to be had, he compassed the citty with his subtill practise.
                  At such time as the Locrins were oppressed with the wars of Leophon K. of

                     Rhegium, they made a vow, that if they had the vpper hand and ouerthrow of their enemies, they would vpon the next feastiuall day of Venus, set their virgins in the generall stewes for all men to abuse: which vow being left vnperformed, by hauing vnfortunate warres with the Lucanes, Dennis called the cittizens to gether before him, and exhorted them to send their wiues and daughters, as sumptuously apparrailed as might be, to the Temple of Venus, and out of them their should be a hundred drawne by lot, to performe the common ceremony which wiues and daughters for religions sake, should contiune in the Brothel-house for the space of one month, all their husbands being before sworne not for that time to haue any right of them: & to the entent the maidens,  that preforming the publike vowe, for publike good, should not be hindred thereby, their should be a decree established, that no other maide should be contracted and ensured to any husband, before those other were maryed.
                  This counsell was wel alowed, as in the which, prouision seemed to be made a meanes both for the performance of their superstitious vow, and also for the preseruation of the chastity of their virgins, whereupon all the women assembled into the temple of Venus, so gorgiously and costly atyrued, as euery one, had despite against the other who might best exceede. Among whom, Dennis sent his men of warre, and stripped them of their ornaments, conuerting them to his owne gaine and profit. Some of their husbands, whom he knew to be  wealthy men he killed, some of the women he put to torture, whereby to inforce them to confesse, where their husbands treasure was concealed. So when he had with these and such like seuerall subtilties raigned ful sixe years, the Locrines cloid with his oppression, tooke hart and conspired against him, and Dennis is expulsed. so preuailed that they expelled him out of the citty, from whence he returned into Sicell, where likewise by treason, no man mistrusting an alteration, after so long continuance of peace, he recouered the citty Syracuse. But while he was busied in these affaires in Sycill: in Affricke Hanno Prince of Carthage, began to employ his riches (by which hee surmounted the power of the common-wealth) Hannos conspiraci

                  And therefore he prepared a feast for the people in the open porches and galleries of the Citty; But for the senate in a priuate and perticular place in his owne house, making this an assurance in himselfe, that if at that feast he could poison and dispatch the senatours to their graues, he might without resistance  or contradiction, vsurpe vpon the common-wealth, being destitute of her patrons and defendors. Which conspiracy being by some of his senators, whom he trusted in the plot discouered to the Magistrates, the mischiefe was auoided but not punished, least in a man of so great power, the matter being partly but a surmise, and they chiefe of the proofe so much his inferiour, they might rather draw danger then withstand it, being therfore contented to haue preuented

him of his purpose, they made a decree, wherein was limitted what cost shoulde be bestowed vpon mariages, straightly charging and commanding the sam to be obserued, not of any one man in especial, but of al in generall; to the intent the person should not seem to be noted but the vices rebuked. Hanno being by this deuice preuented, stirred the bondmen to rebelion, and hauing determined a day again for the slaughter of the senat, finding him & his purposes the second time circumuented and betra

                      they iudged tended to the ruine of a commonweale, and dissolution of their liberty: he was taken, first whiped, then his eyes pulled out, his armes & legs broken, and as though euery member, had for some seuerall demeanor & offence merited a contrary punishment, they were seuerally afflicted. Lastly he suffered death in the open view of the people, and his body which before was torne with scourges, was hanged to rot vppon a gibbet. Moreouer his sonnes and kinsmen, all the stocke, branches, name, or generation of him, neuer so guitlesse were all put to violent execution, so that their should not of so wicked a seed remaine an impe either to ensue his example by contriuing the like treason, or to hope for a time to reuenge his death. 
                  
                  In the meane time Dennis after his returne and possession in the seate of Syracusa, persisted and studied how to make, his cruelties, tiranies, and oppressions more sharp and pointed, against the Cittizens, so that they again Dennis depo

He was a companion for the ragged, and estemed the most slouenliest, prouoking men to laughter, rather then laugh himselfe: he would vse to stande gaping and gazing in the Market shambles, deuouring with his eies the things he could  not buy with his mony, scold with bawdes before the Worlde, and in fine accustomed, and accommodated himselfe, in no wise proper, but to that inorderly shape, might make him seeme woorthy rather to be despised then feared. Last of all he professed himself Schoole-maister and taught children, in a thoroufare, to the intent he might either be openly seene of them that feared him, or els might the easier bring himselfe in contempt of them that feared him not.
                  
                     
For albeit his former and whole course of life alwaies abounded in tyranous vices, yet this was but a formal counterfetting of former qualities and no naturall disposition, he studied these things, rather of pollicy, then that he had forgotten his royall and princely behauiour, for that he knew by proofe, how hatefull the name of a Tyrant was, though they had relinguished their power, and distributed their riches: and therefore he labored to take away the enuy of thinges past, by bringing himfelfe in a contempt for his present demeanor, hauing not so much reguard, to that was for his honor as what was for the preseu

                  In the time that this course of Dennis had such successe, the Carthageniens hartily troubled, with the prosperous euentes, great Alexander had in all the warlike affaires he vndertooke, and doubting least where he had conquered the kingdome of Persia, hee would also adioyne Affricke thereunto, they sent Hamilcar sur-named Rhodanus, a man farre passing all the iudgments of his time in wit and eloquence, to sifte and gather intelligence what he intended therein, for it greatly increased their feare, and gaue them manifest cause to doubt, since they themselues were witnesses, that their mother Citty Tyrus chiefe authour of their beginning to be taken, and the citty Alexandria an enemy  to the estate of Carthage, built in the bounds of Affricke & Egypt; withall, the fortunat felicity of the King himselfe, whose couetousnesse, and prosperity they supposed would neuer be at end. Hamilear laboring to come to personall speech with Alexander, attained it by the help of Parmenio, to whom, he faining himselfe to be exciled his countrey, he was fled to so great and gratious a Monarch for succour, offering his seruice as a priuat souldier in his wars, by which pollicy hauing from time to time perfect instructions, of the kinges proceedings and purposes, he aduertised his countreymen thereof in tables of wood co

He vrgeth violent cruelty vpon the confederates of the Carthagenians, by the permission of Hamilcar, by whose death the secret iudgemente, intended against the Carthagenians is preuented. Agathocles is besieged by Hamilcar the sonne of Gysgo. He remoueth the warre into Affricke, ouercommeth the Carthagine, which causeth them to revolt to his side. He killeth the king of Cyren, ouercommeth the Carthageneans againe. He raiseth the siege before syracusa, he is  receiued in a mutiny. He is ouercome through rashnesse, for saketh all his forces and his children, who suffereth death for his sake. Lastly, hee concludeth a peacewith the Carthagenians in Cycill.

For being of fauour and personage exceding beautifull, he suffred the  better hope and fruit of his youth, to be wasted in detestible incest, and being arriued to further and stronger years, he turned his lustfull condition and practise of life, from men to women: so that being defamed, and detested, for being slaue to twoe such abhominable vices, he altred the trade of his so liuing and fel to robery. In processe of time he came to Siracuse, into which Citty he was entertained as amongst other inhabyters, where though he liued, yet liued he either without credit or estimation, and was accounted of as one whose desperat stay without himselfe, had nothing to loose, nor virtue in himselfe worthy to be loued. 
                  
                  At length he obtained the roome of a mercenary souldier, and looke how dishonest he was in his life before, euen as seditious was he in his actions then, so forward to further mutines, that he was held a president for others to practtise mischiefe by: that which was held praise worthy in him, he was of body strong, and of speech eloquent, so that endeuoring from one preferment to another, he was at last made Captaine of a hundred men, wherein he so disged

his commaunde, that he was immediately after made Marshall of the hoast. In the first battell which he waged against the Actneans, he so behaued himselfe, that he gaue the Siracusans great proofe to cherish in their thoughts, a hopefull expectation of his future towardnes. In the next occasion ministred him, against the Campaignes, he so perseuerd in his Noble disposition, and prooued so fortunate in his Martiall Discipline, that from a present opinion was conceined of him through the whole army, he was by a generall voyce substituted in the Office of the grand Captaine of Damasco deceased, with whose wife he had committed adultry, and after married.

The Murgantines, among whom hee was entertained and liued in the time of his exise, created him first their Pretor, and afterward their Captaine, and in the first Warre he vndertooke for them, he fact the citty of the Leontines, and besieged the Citty Siracusa: to the rescue and reliefe whereof, Hamilcar captaine of the carthagenians being requested to come, he forgot all former enmity and inueterat hatred against them, &  sent thither a power of his souldiors in their asistance. So that at one instant this citty Syracusa was defended friendly by an enemie, and siercely assaulted by their own cittizens. But Agathocles hauing made tryal that the town was more manfully made good then assaulted, directed a Pursiuant to Hamilcar, requiring him in this behalfe, to arbitrate the difference, so long continued between him and the Syracusans, and for the determination of a peace betweene them: promising him, if euer occasion should affoord it self for him to do the like, he would not be slack to recompence his labors, and gratifie his kindnes. Wherupon Hamilcar being filled with hope, entred into league  with him, to this effect, that how much he furthered Agathocles in strength against the Syracusans, so much s

                  By meanes of these complaints, the Senate was highly mooued to displesure againste Hamilcar: but forasmuch as hee was in Office of so great commaund, they gaue their iudgement vppon him priuately, commaundinge their verdits before they should be read to his correction, to be cast in a pot  togither, and there to be seald vp, and the execution therof to be suspended, till that the other Hamylcar the sonne of Gisgo, were returnd out of Sicill. But Hamilcar dying, preuented the yssue of their subtill deuices and vnknowne Hamilcar is condemned of treason. verdits of the Carthagenians, and so he was deliuered from the violence of one death by the benefite of another: whome his owne Countreymen had wrongfully condemned vpon a bare suggestion, without hearing of his answere. At which vnaduisednes of theirs, Agathocles took occasion to make warre vpon the Carthagenians, and at the first encounter that he had, was against He dyeth. 
                     Hamilcar the sonne of Gisgo, of whom being vanquished, he returned to Siracusa, to raise a greater power, and so renew the battaile: But in the  second aduenture, his fortune proued like to the first, so that the Carthagenians hauing thus farre the vpper-hand, besieged Syracusa: When Agathocles perceiuing he was now so sore weakened by this late successe, neither of power to remooue them, nor any way sufficiently furnished to linger or indure out the siege: and that moreouer his owne confederates murmuring at his former cruelties, daily forsooke him; he determined to remooue his warres

into Affricke: wherein his audacity was wonderfull that hee shoulde enterprize to make forraine Warres against the Citty of them, whom he was not able to resist and incumber at home, and that being not able to defende his owne, he would giue the onset to indamage others.
                  But that being vanquished he might proudely vaunt, thus much he had done to the displeasure of his Conquerors, or else raise one siege by the setting of another. The concealing of this purpose, was as wonderfull as the deuice thereof, for neither his commaunders, nor other could learne or be instructed otherwaies from him, but that he had inuented a stratigem, ascertaind him of the victory, incouraging them to rouze vp one another hartes as he indeuored to quicken them all, for the siedge should not belonge; or  else, if there were any, had not the hart to abide the aduenture of the present estate, but were wearied with the delay thereof, to them he assigned free lyberty to depatt, counting himselfe happy to be discharged of those, whose fealty and merit he could neither hope for, nor trust vnto, and whose bodies he inioyed without their harts. Wherupon hauing dismist a thousand & six hundred, he furnished the rest that remained, with victuall, artillery, and wages, according as he thought fit, and the estate of the siedge required. He tooke with himselfe, and to spend for his prouision, but fifty Talents, thinking it better if need should so require, to furnish himselfe from the riches  of his enemies then to impouerish his subiects. He then set at liberty al the bondmen, that were of yeares meet for the Warres, and taking an oath seucrally of them, to continue their alleageance to him, hee shipped the most part of thē, among the rest of his souldiors, hoping that for asmuchas he had made them all one in estate and degree, there would be no kinde of strife among them who in desart should behaue himselfe most manfully; all the rest being left to the defence of his Country. The seuenth yeare of his raign acompanied with his two sonnes, Archagathus and Heraclida, he directed his course into Affricke, and when all his men supposed, he intended they shuld haue gone forraging and seeking pray either into Italy, or in the Ile of Sardinia,

That at home we haue no other refuge but our owne, nor succor but our selues, when this enemy may be vanquished by her owne power, by the subiects adherents, nay euen of hir selfe. For no Empire how euer so well husbanded, that nourisheth not Weeds with flowers, tares with better corne, traitors with subiects, that imbosomes not in it, prodigies of youth, such whome ryot hath wasted, seeming male-contents,

the disperatnesse of whose estates, makes them abuse the order of gouernment, and raile at time, being apt to entertaine newes of any vprore or mischiefe, as hunger makes them dcsirous to cate, that honors not discontented nobles, such whom either ambition in themselues, or enuy of others greatnesse, or in alleagiance to the state, (like reedes shaken with occasion giuen by euery wind) and are as greedy of innouation, as their ambition makes them couetous of greatnesse. To such as these will our arriuall giue sire vnto, who though in peace they haue bin raigned in with the bridle of law, (wearied with along continned Empire they will now take hands and pertake our quarrel, though furthered with no other hope thereunto, but that they shalbe worthily aduansed by forraigne Princes, then their desart gaue them occasion to rise by  their owne. Besides the citties and castels of Affricke, are not enuironed with walles, nor scituate in Mountaines, but raised vpon plaine ground, in open & champion fields, without any munitiō or defence. All which for feare of being destroyed, or to take part with those of their countrey, (ofall forts come into vs) will easely be intreated, or if not, inforced to be our refuge in this warre; with all the enuy that their bordering neighbours beare vnto them, knowing them now greater in name then in power, will assemble to vs from all parts in their ruine. So shall wee finding greater strength here then we had power to bring with vs, be able to giue the Carthagenians hotter warres in Affricke at their owne doores, then in Sicill when they inuaded vs. 
                  
                  Moreouer, their suddaine feare wil be no small furtherance of victory, when they shal consider our wonderfull boldnes, in comming thus to besiedge them being besiedged our selues; and also for the encrease of the same, shall tremblingly behold, the burning of their villages, the beating down of their Castles and holdes, the sacking of their fortisied citties, and finally the besiedging of Carthage it selfe. Where on the contrary, if we had staied in siracusa we had remained in danger ofthose enemies, whom now we shall compell to feele, lye themselues as open to the waires of other men, as other men lie open to them; and either by this meanes be vanquishers of Carthage, or at least set Sicill at  liberry: since it is likely and the presumption great, that our enemies will not lie still at their siedge before siracusa, when they shall heare that their owne citty is so endangered by vs, or if they should, here is warre more easie, and here will our prey be more plentifull.
                  Suppose in this our absence they should conquer our siracusa; in that they gaine but siracusa, when if we in their neglect by honor of their Carthage, gaine for that labour and by that victory to be gouernors of Carthage, Affricke, and sicill, and the glory of our renowne and out honorable waifare be so great, that obliuion shall not raze it out, nor the worthy memory thereof, while the world hath being be forgotten. Where reproofe and dishonor will  succeede on them and their inheritance, that they should be the men should raise warre against enemies a broad, whom they could not withstand at home, and should we faile in these noble disseignes, it is honor enough for vs that we pursued so far against our conquerors as to besiedge the besiedgers of our citty. So that howsoeuer, we cannot haue a greater reward if we be victors, nor a more euerlasting monument if we be ouercome.

In which encounter was slaine of the Sicillians two thousand, and of the Carthagenians three,  and Hanno Captain of Carthage himselfe. Through this victory the courage of the Sicillians was strengthned, and the heartes of the Carthagenians discouraged; so that Agathocles hauing vanquished many ofhis enemies, subdued Citties, taken holds, surprized booties, and slaine thousands, he pitched his campe about v. miles from Carthage, to the intent they might behold from the very wals of the Citty, the misery of their friends, the losse of their dearest and most esteemed pleasures, with the wasting of their fieldes, and burning of their Villages.
                  This ouerthrow and slaughter of the Carthagenian Army, the subduing of  the Citties, and hauocke that was made, was in this time bruted ouer al Affricke, whereat euery man was amazed, and wondred so great an Empire, so secure in themselues, and in their owne strength so confident, should haue so suddaine an ouerthrowe, and especially by an enemy, supposed and rumored among them not long since, to be already vanquished.

So that the carthageniens, receiuing like misfortunes abroad as at home, and the tributary citties hauing intelligence thereof, not onely they but also the kings that were in league and amety with them, waying friendship by fortune, The king of Cy

                         to Agathocles. and not by faithfulnesse, reuolted from them. Among this number there was one Ophellas King of cyrene, who vpon an ambitious desire to enioy the dominion of all Affricke, entred into league with Agathocles by his Ambassadors,  and had conditioned with him, that after the carthageniens were ouercome, Agathocles should take to his sway the Empire of Sycill, and delegat to him the Empire of Affricke. To the furtherance of which couenant, Ophellas came with a great host to ayde him in these warres, whom Agathocles entertained with faire words and fained curtesie, very lowly and humbly (for Ophellas also had adopted him his sonne) where after they had many times feasted and banqueted together, Agathocles vnawares slew him, then seising on his army, he summoned the carthageniens to battell: so both comming into the field, with all the power and furniture they were able to make, the carthagenians were vanquished, but not without great slaughter and bloodshed drawne from both parts.  Throgh this discomfiture and ouerthrow, the carthagenians many of them fell in to distrust of themselues, so that had there not arose a mutinye in Agathocles campe, Bomilcar the captaine of the carthageniens had with his army reuolted vnto him: for which offence the carthageniens nailed him vpon a crosse in the midest of the market place, to the entent that the same ground might be The punishment of Bomilcar a witnesse of his punishment, which before time had beene an aduancement of his honor. But Bomilcar was no whit daunted nor dismaid, but took stoutly the cruelty of his contrey, in so much that from the top of the crosse, as it had beene from a iudgement seate, he proclaimed and pleaded like an aduocate against the wickednesse of his cittizens; obiecting vnto them sometime their vnrightfull entrapping of Hanno, vpon false suspition subborned, that he went  about to make himselfe a king; sometime the banishment of innocent Gisgo, when themselues could scarce tell the cause why: sometime their secret verdits against his vncle Hamilcar, because he sought to make Agathocles their friend rather then maintain him to be their enemy. Which words when he had vtred with a loud voice and great vehemency in the audience of a multitude, he gaue vp his life. By this Agathocles hauing sundry times put his enemies to the worse in Affricke, he deliuered the charge of his host to his sonne Archagathus, and returned himselfe with speede into Sycill, accounting all that till then he had perpetrated in Affricke subiect to imperious vicissitude, and indeed don to no Agathocles againe returneth to Sycil 
                      purpose, if siracuse were stil besiedged. For after that Hamilcar the sonne of Gisgo was slain, the Carthageniens sent thether a new host of men to continue their siedge and releeue them. Therefore assoone as Agathocles was come into Sicil, al the citties hauing knowne before of his fortunate proceedings in Affricke, yeelded themselues to him; by meanes whereof, Hauing driuen the Carthageniens out of Sicill he tooke vpon him the kingdome of the whole Island.
                  
                     
When he came backe into Affricke againe, his souldiors instead of other gladnesse welcommed him with a mutiny, for his sonne Archagathus whom he left for gouernment of them, had delaide the paiment of their lendinges vntill the returne of his father: wherefore he called them before him, and intreated them with gentle words, saying it was not so requisit for them to demaund wages at his hands, as to seek from their enemies: for as the victory which they hoped for, was to be deserued of al, so the profit ther of should be common and extended to all in generall, desiring them to be as they had bene, painefull and industrous souldiors awhile, vntill the remaine of their warres were dispatched, considering they knew certainly that Carthage once  taken, which could not long hold out, they should there find inough to satisfie their desires, with more then they could hope for.
                  Hauing thus appeased the vprore & exclamations of his souldiors, which he indged to grow as much by idlenesse and slacke imployment in his absence, as for want of meanes. within few daies he remooued his camp

As they set forward in pursuit of him, they were stopped by the Numidians, and so returned into their campe, hauing taken Archagathus, who had lost his father by reason of the darknes of the night; while Agathocles in the same ships that he had waftage ouer out of Sicil, was transported  into Syracuse. Wherein is exprest a singuiar example of wickednes, a King to be forsaken of his owne Army, and a father to be betraid of his own children.

When Archagathus was to suffer death by the hands of Archesilaus one that before time had bin a friend to his father, he asked him what Agathocles would do to his children, by whom he was made childles. The sonnes of Agathocles put to death. Who answerd him, that it was inough for him that he knew they were aliue after the children of Agathocles. After this the Carthagenians sent Captaines  into Sicill to pursue further Warre, with whom Agathocles made peace vppon indifferent Articles.

The first people and prouince he proclaimed his enemies were the Brutians, who were then esteemed to be of most puissance and most wealth, and also most readiest to inforce wrong or offer their neighbours oppression.
                  For they had expulst out of many cities the people of the Greekes descent, and rast forth the record of their habitation in Italy: they had also vanquished euen their owne first founders. The Lucanes vpheld a custome, to enstruct and bring vp their children, after the same antient manner the Lacedomonians were wont to do, for from the time they begun to encrease past the groath of children,  they sent them (what cittizens soeuer they wer) to be fostred in the countrey amongst Grasiers and shephards, without attendance or seruice, and without garments to put on their backes or beds to lie vpon, to the entent that from their tender yeares, they might enure themselues without helpe of the citty, to away with hardnesse and sparing. Their meate was such as they could get

by hunting, and their drinke was either meth or milke, or else faire water of the spring, and in such sort were they hardned to sustaine the labors of warfarre.

his sonne and his nephew, each of them challenging the dignity of the kingdome to himselfe, as if the father and kinsman had beene dead already, in which his sonne was slaine. Agathocles therefore seeing this change on one part, and feeling the griefe of his disease so violent on the other, and betweene both the agitation of his thoughts and minde still grieuouser, each encreasing by the furtherance of the other, being vterly in dispair, he caused his wife Theogen to take his two little sonnes, which he had begotten of her, withal his treasure, houshold stuffe, and princely furniture appertaining vnto him (as which no king in his daies was reputed better stored) and sail into Egypt from whence he tooke her to his wife; suspecting least his nephew who had robbed him of  his kingdome, should proue no lesse an enimy to them.

Of whose princely body in her absence, she was doubtfull who would haue care, or would see it bestowed according to the worthinesse it deserued hauing  life. But when none of these arguments preuailed for her, but that she must depart, the little ones imbraced the father and made a chaine of their armes about his necke, bewailing their vntimely separation; while one the otherside the wife, as one that had not hope to see her husband any more, had scarce power to take her farwell in wordes, the passage being stopr by the rebellion of her teares. Nor was the lamentation ordinary, to see how pitiously the old man wept, the children bewailing the father ready to die, and the father bemoning his banished children. The one, sorowing to leaue their sicke and diseased aged father al alone as disolat; the other, lamenting to leaue his sonnes  in penury, whom he had begotten to inherit his kingdome. All the pallace was filled with the noise of such as stood to be witnesses of so cruell a diuorce and departure, some weeping as much to see them weepe, as for the cause they had to be mollified into such showers themselues. At length, the necessity of The death of Agathocles. their forced separation, was an ende of the trafficke that their sorrow had together, though not an end of their teares; and the death of the king ensued

immediately vpon the leaue taken betweene him, his wife, and his children.
                  The Carthagenians now hauing true intelligence how the world went in Sicill, thought it a good occasion to be giuen them of recouering the whole Island, and thereupon sayled thither with a great power, and subdued many Citiies. At this time Pirrhus made warre against the Romaines, who (as is before declared) being desired to come to the aide of the Sicillians, hauing subdued many Citties, arriued at Syracusa, where he was proclaimed King of Sicill, like as before he was of Epire. In the prosperous successe of which actions greatly reioycing, he instituted that his sonne Heleu should be king of Sicill, as in the right of his grandfather, (for he was begotten of K. Agathocles 
                      daughter) and his sonne Alexander should be King of Italy.
                  
                  Which will of his, confirmed by generall consent, he fought many prosperous battels with the Carthagenians: in which warre being busied, there He returneth to the actiōs of Pyrrhus before spoke of in the 16 Booke came Ambassadors from his confederates in Italy, deliuering to him, that by his absence they were so weakned, it was impossible for them to make resistance any longer against the Romaines, but that he must needs yeeld unlesse he rescued them. whereupon being troubled with so doubtfull a danger, and not knowing which way to turn himselfe, or which of them he might rescue first, he tooke speedy aduice concerning both, for on the one side the carthagenians assailed him, and on the other side the Romaines, so that it seemed a  troublesome matter to him, not to passe with his Army into Italy, and yet more dangerous to lead his hoast out of Sicill, least the one should bee lost for want of succor, or the other perish by withdrawing his helpe from them. Tost thus in this raging sea of dangers, the surest hauen of all other counsels to harbor in seemed to be, first withall his power to try the matter nowe on foot in Sicill, and then hauing vanquished the carthagenians, to transport Py

By means wherof, he left the kingdome as slightly as he came by it easily. Furthermore finding no better successe in Italy, then he had in Sycill, he retyred into Epire, the wonderful chance of both may rightly be recorded for an example. For euen as before through prosperous fortune al his indeuors flowed profitably to him, beyond his desire and expectation, and that he had obtained the Empire of Italy, the kingdome of Sicill, with so many victories against the Romaines, so now when fortune had chaunged her coppy, and as it were to patterne and manifestly shew in him, the frailties that mans life is subiect vnto, throwing downe the things that she her  selfe had builded, defacing the Trophes she had raised, besides the losse of Sycill, she paid him home with shipwracke on the sea, with a shamefull ouerthrow against the Romaines, and with a dishonorable departure out of Italy.

But by his motherside he was borne of a base and very dishonorable stocke, for he was begotten of a bondwoman, and therfore reiected and cast away by his father, as a dishonour and reproch to his house. But the thrifty Bees, finding him a little babe, without help of nurse, or any other comfort, wrought their combes about him, and cherished and preserued him with life, many daies together. Vpon which miraculous preseruation, his father besides being forwarned by the Southsaiers, who told him the child should liue and be a king, tooke his infant home to him, and brought  him vp with all secure diligence, in hope of the fortunat estate was presaged should be due vnto him. As the same child sat at his booke with other schollers, soddenly their came in a Wolfe, and snatched the booke out of his hand: afterward being growne to mans estate, and when he was called first to the warres, an Eagle came and sat vpon his target, and an Owle vpon his speare: the which wonder betokened he should be aduised in counsell, ready of hand, and in after time should attaine to be a King; finally, he fought hand to hand against many challengers, and euer departed with victory. King Pyrrhus rewarded him with many rewardes for his chiualry. He was of personage exceeding beautifull, of strength so wonderfull, as might be comprehended in a  man: gentle to talke vnto, Iust in his dealings, and in his gouernment vpright and indifferent: so that nothing in the world wanted in him, appertaining to the dignity of a king, saue a kingdome which is dignitye it selfe.

And least they might seeme to haue taken weapon in hande against Antigonus, vnder whose gouernance they wer, they assailed first the Aetolians his confederats, pretending the cause of their warres with them to be, for that the said Aetolians, had entred vpon and possest themselues by force of the fielde Cyreus, which by the general consent of al Greece, was consecrated to Apollo. As captaine  of this warre they chose one Aran, who assembling his whole power togither; he spoiled the townes, and forraged ouer the corne that was growing in the afornamed fields, & such as they could not haue cariage sor along, he caused to be set on fire, which the shepheardes of the Etolians, beholding out of the Mountains, gathred themselues the number of 5, C. and fel upon

So that being rid of the cause of feare, giuen him by forraigne enemies, he turned his vngodlinesse and wicked complots to the deuising of mischiefes against his owne house; practising treason aginst his sister Arsinoe, to the entent to depriue her children of their liues, and her of the possession of the famous Citty Cassandria. To effect which purpose, the first point of his subtilty was, vnder the pretence of counterfet loue, to desire his sister in marriage.
                  For otherwise then vnder colour of concord, he could not compasse her children, whose kingdome he had wrongfully vsurped from them: but his sister suspecting the treachery of his hart, gaue no credit to the testimony of  his tongue. Whereupon, perceiuing that she trusted him not, he dispatched ambasladors to certifie her, that he would make her children fellowes in the Empire with him: against whom, he had made warre, not vtterly to teare the kingdome from them, but so to possesse himselfe of it, that they should accept it from him, as his free guift to them: and for the more assurance hereof, he entreated her to send some trusty friend of hers, to receiue an oath of him; in the presence of whom, he would before the Goddes of his countrey, oblige himselfe, by what oath, vow, curse, or by what religion socuer, she would either desire, or inioyne him, for the performance of this promise.

                  Where hauing subdued the Pannonians, they made warre with their neighbours many yeares together, sometime their fortune (like an houre-glas

Afterward being prouoked by their fortunate sucesse, they raised two armies, wherof the one went toward Greece, and the other toward Macedon: in which forrage of theirs, they put al to the sword that happened in their danger. By meanes whereof the name and power of the Frenchmen became so terrible, that euen Kings before they were assailed, were glad to hier them with great summes of mony to procure their amity, and that they might liue in peace by them. Onely Ptolomy King of Macedon made light of their fortunes, and when he heard they were comming to comence  warre against him, as if it had beene as easie a matter to dispatch such hostill preparations as to do mischiefe, made no hast to resist their passage. And as if the Goddes had ordained these men as their reuengers for his cruell and abhominable murthers, he had onely not power to leauy and strengthen his own forces together, but also took scorn at the friendly offer made by the Ambassadors of Dardanie, who proffered to send him twenty thousand well armed to supply and help him in this his inuasion; withall returned them with taunts and scoffs for their extended kindnes: saying, the good daies of Macedon were far spent, if after they had by their owne puissance alone, conquered all the  East, they should now haue neede of the Dardanians to defend their owne countrey; and gaue them to know that he had in his host, the sonnes of them that serued vnder great Alexander, and had subdued the whole world. So that going forth against so infinit an enemy with so weak a power, and that so out of order, the king of Dardanie hearing thereof did Iustly report, that the famous Empire of Macedon would shortly decay, through the rashnes of an vnaduised soueraigne. The Frenchmen therefore by the aduice of their captain Belgius, to the entent to try how the Macedons wer addicted, sent ambassadors to Ptolomy, offering him peace if he would buy it, as he had president thervnto from other princes his neighbors. But Ptolomy bosted among his men of warre, that  so great was the terror of his renowne, that the Frenchmen, of whom other kings wer driuen to compound for friendship, desired the like ofhim sor fear, and no lesse vanted himself besore the ambadssadors & scoft at their message, then he had before done to his other friends, and answered them, he was so far from desiring peace, that he denied it vnto them, any otherwaies, then if they gaue them noble men for hostages, & deliuered into his hands their at

When the Ambassadors had reported this answer, the Frenchmen laughed at his arrogancy, crying out, that he and his should shortly feel whither they ofsred peace to his behoofe or theirs.
                  While this answer of Phillip beat on the slint of the Frenchmens spleens, the tinder os their indignation tooke such sorcible fire, that they immediatly arraid themselues in readinesse, and fell Pel-mell to handiblowes, wher the Macedons being vanquished, the glory of their renown began to set, for Ptolomy being sore wounded in diuers places, was taken prisoner & his hed stric

Wherefore while the Macedons were thus beaten, & retired to safeguard themselues within the walles of their citty, Brennus like a conqueror, against whom no man durst shew his head to make resistance, he wasted all the country of Macedon. From whence as though those booties seemed too base and simple in his eie, much lesse to satisfie the greedinesse of his expectation, he turned his minde to the Temple of the Gods immortal, maliparrly scoffing that the Gods were rich and ought to depart liberally to men.

Where the concourse of folk (which vpon trust of the maiesty of that God, resorting thither from diuers places, builded them houses in that rock) hath made a populous citty. Moreouer both the temple and town are inclosed and munified, not with walls, but with the Perpendicularnes and quarry of the rocke: neither are they defended with fortifications made by mans hand, but with necessary resistance and succour  growing and prouided by nature. So that there is no Iudgement able to decide whether the strength, scituation of the place, or the maiesty the Gods therein, be more to be wondred at. The middle part of this Mountain inward, is like vnto a Theater. By meanes whereof, when men make any shouting, or when any trumpet is blown, the sound beates and rebounds in such sort vpon the stones from one to another, that the Eccho is heard double and treble, and the noise resoundeth farre louder and greater then it went forth: which strangnes, The place of the Oracles described. causeth the simple and ignorant people, to be in much feare & reuerence therof, thinking it to be the presence of the Godhead, and oftentimes maketh them to stand so wondering at it, as if they were distracted. In this winding of the rocke, almost midway to the top of the hill there is a little plaine, and in the  same adeep hole desending into the ground, which serueth to giue oracle. Out of this hole a certaine cold breath, driuen vp as it were with a temperate and modest wind ascending stil vpward, stirreth the mindes of the prophets into a madnes, & so hauing filled them with the spirits of the gods, it compelleth thē to giue answer to such as come for counsel. In the same place were resident and to be seene many and rich gifts of kings and people, which by theyr cost and sumptuousnes, do well declare the thankfulnes of such as receiued answers in performing of their vowes. Wherfore when Brennus came within view of the temple, hee beganne to aduise with himself whether it were more requisite to  attempt the sacke thereof incontinent, or giue his souldiers that nights respit, to gather theyr strength. Euridianus and Thessalonus, who for couetousnesse of prey had ioyned themselues with him in this action, aduised him to cut off al delay, and vndertake the businesse they came for while their enemies were vnprouided, for that their sudden approch, no doubt would proue agreat terror vnto them; where on the contrary, by giuing them that nightes r

While these thinges were in question among the captaines of this so huge an army, the common and mercinary souldiers of the Frenchmen, who after long penury, found a countrey so replenished with wine, and store of all other kind of viands, being as glad and ioyful of the aboundance to satisfie their present necessity, as of victory to inrich their hopes, dispersed themselues into the fields, and leauing their standerds, ran abroad making spoile of al things like conquerors. By which means the Delphians had respit to prouid and strengthen themselues. For at such time as it was first reported to them that the Frenchmen (as

                  The Delphians hauing thus strengthened their towne, (by the help of friendly borderers against forraigne besiebgers) thought yet their number nothing equall according to indifferent Iudgement, to make good a resistance against so infinit an Army: for Brennis had in his hoast threescore and fiue thousand  choise souldiors, whereas the Delphians and their complices were in number The French ass

Which booty so delight full to the eie, their labours should shortly bring to be more pleasant in the hand. The Frenchmen being by this encouragement of their captains, or rather by their owne beholding, stirred vp and also inflamed with the wine they  had powred in the day before, without respect of danger, or regard of any aduise, ran headlong to the encounter: on the contrary part, the Delphians putting more trust and hope of their deliuerance in their Goddes, then in they

                      owne strength, resisted their enemies with a bolde contempt, and what with stones and with their weapons, they threw the Frenchmen as they scaled, from the top of the mountaines.
                  While these two aduersaries were striuing one against the other, in this skirmish, one led with the hope of victory, the other to redeeme their liberty: suddainely the Priests of all the Temples, and the Prophets themselues, with their haire about their eares, the sacred reliques in their handes, like men distracted  and rent out of their wits, came running foorth, and pressed into the forefront of the battell, crying out (courage) for there are Gods among vs, and they had beheld him leap down into the Temple, at the open roofe top.
                  Moreouer while they were al making humble supplication to the Goddes, for refuge, there past by them a young man, of beauty farre excelling anye mortall creature, and in his company with him two Virgins in armour, which

came vnto him out of the two Temples of Diane and Minerua. Which wonder and hopefull sight, they had not onely euidently seene with their eies, but also had perfectly herd the clattring of their harnesse, and the sound of their bowes, wherefore they intirely besought them, that seeing the Goddes themselues did guard their standerd, and were souldiers in their succours, they would now be bould in the ouerthrow and dispatch of their enemies, and ioyne themselues and their endeuors, as pertakers with the Goddes in so remoued a victory.
                  With which words as it were a fresh fire of life quickened in them, they preassed forth who might be most formost in the fight, and there withall as they were foretold by the prophets, they by and by preceiued that the Goddes  was present on their side. For a peece of the Mountaine being broken of by a suddaine earthquake, ouerwhelmed the French host and the thickest of their enemies, not without great slaughter, were opened and put to slight.

                  Furthermore, the King to the entent thereby to dismay them, at the sight of so vgly shapes where with these barbarous people were not yet acquainted, commaunded his men to shew them his Elephants, and his ships laden with victual & artillery, not knowing that they, whom by aduancing & setting forth

his power and riches, he would haue discouraged; were thereby encoraged, with hope to be soueraigne thereof. The Ambassadors therefore dispatcht from the King, and returned vnto their company, declared what they had tane especial note of, and set out al things to the vttermost of praise, expressing the Kings riches, and his negligence; how his campe was stuffed with gold and siluer, and neither fortified with ditch nor trench, and that, euen as though their richesse were a sufficient defence for them, they kept neither watch nor any other warlike order, as if they had no need at all of helpe of the sworde, but fed themselues fat, wallowing in ease, and the prosperity of riches. The report of which, was as bellowes to the hot minds of the couetous  Frenchmen, till they were satisfied as possessors of that greatnes which yet their eares had receiued but from report. Besides, to further theyr desire they tooke example by Belgius, who not long before had slaine the K. with the whole hoast of Macedon.

                  So that when the Frenchmen found all things void and not onely without defenders but also without keepers, mistrusting they were not sled, but rather kept and concealed themselues close for the execution of some imminent policy, it was long erethey durst aduenture the passage of those gates whereat there was no body to withstand them: at last leauing all the fortifications vndefaced they entred the camp, rather searching then riffling. And hauing made pillage of what they found on land, they turned the violence of their pretence toward the sea side, whereas they fell rashly to the rifling of the ships: the sailors and parte of the Army, that for safeguard with their wiues and children were thether fled, sodainly fel vpon them, and while their  harts slept in security, and their hands were exercised in theeuery, they put them all to the sword, making such a slaughter of the Frenchmen, that the fam of this victory purchased Antigonus not only peace with those enimies, but also of the fierce and sauage people that bordered on his kingdome.

There he lost his sonne Ptolomy and the strongest part of all his army, for when he assaulted the towne, such a sort of women came running to the defence of the Citty, by whome he was not more valiantly vanquished then shamefully driuen to retire. His sonne Ptolomy who there was slaine, is reported to haue bin so couragious and stout a man at Arms, that with threescoremen, he tooke by force the Citty Corcyra; and also in a battaile vppon the sea, he lept out with seuen of his men into a Gally and woon it. And last of al, in the assault of Sparta, he brake with his horse into the midst of the citty, and there oppressed with the number of his enemies, he was slain, whose body when it was brought to his father Pirrhus, it is reported he should say, that he was slaine somwhat later then he looked for, or than his own foolish  hardinesse deserued.
                  
                     Pirrhus when he had receiued the repulse at Sparta, went to Argos. But whilst he endeuored to compasse Antigonus in his hands, whom he had besieged in the Citty, as he fought most valiantly amongst the thickest, he was slaine with a stone from the wall. His head was cut off, & sent to Antigonus, who vsing this victory honorably, sent home his sonne Heleu with his Epyrotes, which were yeilded vnto him into his kingdome without ransome, and deliuered him his fathers body to conuey home, and see honorably interd in his owne countrey. It is a constant report amongest all authors, that there  was not any King either in these dayes, or in the latter times before, worthy to be compared vnto Pirrhus, and that it was a hard matter to find any, not onely among kings, but also among other famous men, either of more vpright liu

                     IN those dayes after the decease of Antiochus K. of Syria, his sonne Seleuchus succeeded in his dignity (by the instigation of his mother Laodice, which rather ought to haue counselled and with  held him from such inhuman practises) and began his raigne with murder, for he cruelly put to death his mother in law Beronice, the sister of Ptolomy King of Egypt, with his little brother begotten vpon her; by which wickednes, he inforced a iust and infamous report vpon his name, and withal intangled him selfe with the wars of Ptolomy.
                  
                  
                     
But before the execution hereof, when Beronice vnderstood that men wer sent to kill her, she kept her selfe close in a pleasant manor of her fathers called Daphne. And when the the Cittizens of Asia heard that she and hir little sonne was there besieged, in remembrance of the dignity of her father, and the Noblenesse of her auncestors, and for pitty to see her so vnwoorthily intreated, they sent aid vnto her. Hir brother Ptolomy also being mooued to compassionat the perill of his sister, left his owne kingdome, and came in all hast to her rescue, with al the power he was able to make.

So great hatred did that abhominable murthering of his mother in law, and his brother purchase on the one party, and the vnworthy death of his father so cruely slaughtred, purchase fauor to the other.
                  After the death of Ptolomy, Seleuchus hauing gathered togither a great sleet against the Citties that had lately reuolted, suddainely (as it were by  the vengeance of the Goddes for his horrible murder) by means of a great tempest, he lost al his Nauy by shipwrack.

                  But the Citties which for the former hatred they bare towards him, had reuolted vnto Ptolomy, now as though they thought themselues sufficiently  satisfied, with the punishment that the Goddes as indifferent iudges had inflicted vpon him, mooued with the miserable newes of his more miserable distresse, changed their opinion from Ptolomy, and their hatered from him, and submitted themselues againe vnder his Dominion. Whereupon reioycing in this happy alteration, and made rich by his losses, accounting hymselfe now sufficiently able to match his enemy in power and strength, hee soorthwith made warre against Ptolomy. But as if he had bene borne for no other purpose but for Fortune to make her laughing stock, or in this world

                  From thence he directed his letters to his brother Antiochus, wherin he befought him of his helpe, offring him in recompence for such fauor, all Asia that was within the precinct of the mountaine Taurus. Antiochus being

of the age of fourteen yeers, but yet couetous of dominion aboue his yeers, tooke this preferment least it should fall to another, but not with so friendly a hart as it was offred, for this Prince by age but a boy (coueting like a theese to bereaue his brother of the whol rule of his kingdome) was as bold in executing his wickednes, as if he had bin a man: Whereupon he was surnamed Hierax, because he exercised his life in taking other mens goods wrongfuly, not after the maner of a Prince, but after the nature of a Gosse-hauke.
                  In the meane time Ptolomy hearing that Antiochus was prepared in rescue of Seleuchus, to the intent he would not be inforced to defend the warre of ii. such enemies at once, took a truce with Seleuchus for x. years. But the peace A Truce 
                      that was giuen by his enemy, was infringed by his brother; who hiering an hoast of the French souldiors, insteed of help brought warre, and insteed of manifesting himselfe a brother, approued himselfe an enemy. In that battaile, through the puissance of the Frenchmen, Antiochus had the victory: wherein supposing Seleuchus had bene slaine, they turned the Weapons they brought in defence of Antiochus against Antiochus himselfe, hopinge thereby without feare or controule, if they could but destroy all the blood warr betwixt two brothers royall, morefreely to wast the whole Countrey of Asia. Which thing when Antiochus perceiued, he was inforced to ransom himselfe for money, as if it had bene from robbers, and compelled to enter league and be at friendship  with his hyred souldiors.
                  Now Eumenes King of Bythinia, perceiuing the Brothers to be consumed and dispersed throgh ciuill discord among themselues, intended to inuade the wandring people, and take to himselfe the whole possession of Asia. In which purpose assayling the Conquerour Antiochus, and his Frenchmen, whom by reason that they were sore and wearie since their late conflict, and his souldiors strong and lusty, he easilie put to the worst. For in this Age al the wars that euerie seueral Prince raisd, tended wholie to the destruction Antiochus vanquished by the king of Bythinia. of Asia, and euerie man that could make himself strongest, seized thereupon as his prey. The two brothers Seleuchus and Antiochus for that cause made War in Asia. Ptolomy King of Egipt vnder pretence of reuenging his sisters  death gaped for Asia: on the one side Eumenes King of Bithinia, and on the otherside the Frenchmen, and common hirelings wasted Asia, but among so manie robbers, and so manie Ambitious Princes, not one was found once to stirre his foot to defend Asia. And albeit that Antiochus was vanquished, and that Eumenes had seized into his hands the most part of that Empire, yet could not the Brothers agree, but contended to renue the warre to destroy one another. In which Antiochus being againe vanquished, and wearied with flying many dayes togither, at length came to his father in Law, Artamenes king of Cappadocia, of whom at first he was gently and with good  respect entertained, but within few dayes after, vnderstanding that he went about to betray him, for sauegard of his life sled back againe from thence. So rouling vp and downe, from one place to another, and finding no room wherin to rest in safety, he was faine to resort for succor to his enemy Ptolomy, whose sayth he thought to be more stedfast then his brothers considering either what he would haue done to his Brother, or what he had deserued at his brothers hand.
                  
                     
But Ptolomy being not so much made his friend, as inlarged his enemy, commanded him to be kept in straight prison, from whence also he escaped by the helpe of a Harlot, whom he had familiar company withal. But being thus escaped from his keepers, as he sled theeues met and killed him. Seleuchus neere about the same instant, hauing lost his kingdome, fell off of his horse, and brake his necke. So both the brothers as it were by like misfortune, like Outlawes after the losse of their kingdomes, suffered due punishment for their manifold mischiues.

his hand, by the right of affinity, which she could not otherwise procure.
                  The marriage thereupon was solemnized, whereby the new bride, was accepted into great grace, and the old wife into displeasure. But the first wife, as though she had beene deuorced of her owne accord, departed to her brother Anticchus, and prouoked him to warre vpon her husband. The Acaruanians also distrusting the Epirots, and thereupon requiring helpe of the Romaines, obteined of the Senat of Roome, that Ambassad were sent, to command the Etolians to withdraw their Garrisons from the Citties of Acaruania, and to suffer them to liue out of bondage, who onely in ancient time, sent no helpe to the Greeks against the Troyans their first founders.

The which Nation entring into Greece with an host thoght almost inuincible, they themselues  had not onely without the aid of any other forraine power, but also not so much as helped with their own houses, vtterly destroyed and made their realme a place for their buriall, which they had determined to make the seat of their kingdome.

Withal Cleomines their king, after he had made great slaughter of his enemies, being all one a gore blood, as well with his owne woundes as the blood of his foes, came in among them. And  when he was entred into the citty, he called not for meate nor drinke no nor once so much as put of his harnesse, but leaning his backe to a wall, when hee saw there remained no more but onely foure thousand of his men from the battel, he exhorted them to reserue and keepe themselues to some other time, when they might be able to doe their countrey more better seruice, then now being oppressed with so great a multitude: against whom no other profit, but

                     ABout this instant season, there happned like alteration almost in all the kingdomes in the knowne world. For in Macedon Phillip, after the decease of his protector Antigonus, tooke the kingdome to his rule being but fourteene An alteratiō of kingdoms by successiō of yong kinges. yeares of age. In Asia, after that Seluchus was slaine, Atigonus as yet not hauing attained to ful groath and ripenesse of foureteene yeares, was made king. The kingdome of Capidocia was surrendred by his father, to Ariarathes a very child. Ptolomy who for the wickednesse of his offence, was  in derision (sur-named Philopater) slewe his father and mother, and vsurped the kingdome of Egypt. But the Lacedemonians in sted of Cleopater, subrogated Lycurgus: and because there should be store of alterations in those times, Hanniball being as yet scarce man-growne, was made Captaine of Carthage: not because there was a scarcity of men, of more yeares, or greater experience, but for the naturall and inueterate hatred that was knowne to be rooted in him against the Romaines, euen from his very childhood: and as it were, borne to the vtter destruction, not so much of the Romaines whom he hated, as of his owne countrey of Affrcike whom he serued.
                  Now albeit these children kings, had no elder and grauer persons to bee their protectors then themselues, yet was euery one of them seuerallye, so  attentiue to followe the steppes of their auncestors, that there was great presumption and hope, they would be indued with vertues, both of body and minde: onely Ptolomy, as he was wicked in vsurping the kingdome, so was he sloathfull and negligent in gouerning the same. The Dardanians with other prouinces and people, who bare as it were an immortall and vnremoued hate

to the kings of Macedon, disdaining Phillip, by reason he was so young, molested him continualle: on the contrary part, Phillip when he had put these enemies to flight, being not contented to haue defended his owne, purposed to make warre against the Etolians; and as he was deuising how to enterprize so much, Demetrius king of Illiria being lately vanquished by Paule, consull of Rome, came to him as an humble suter, making complaint of the wrong the Romaines had done him; who being not content to containe themselues within the bounds of Italy (but of an ambitious desire coueting the Empire of the whole world) made warre with al Kings: alledging also, that for the like couetousnesse of the Empire of Sicill, of Sardinia, of Spaine, and consequently of  al Affricke, they had entred into warre with Hanniball and the Carthgeniens, and against him commensed that warre for no other occasion, but only that he was a neighbor and neare borderer vpon Italy: as though it were not lawful for any king to dwel nor haue dominion neare the co

                        s and Verge of their Empire. Wherefore it behoued him and no doubt would be much auaileable for him, to take an example, & by other mens harmes to beware, whose kingdome the nobler and nearer it was to the Romans, so much would it giue them cause and so much should he sinde him their fiercer enemies. Moreouer, he protested that he was wel contented to surrender vnto him the right and title to the kingdome which the Romaines had vsurped from him, rather then his enemies should peaceably enioy the possession and profit thereof. 
                  
                  With these and such other like arguments he perswaded Phillip, to desist from the Etolians, & to turne the brunte of the war against the Romaines, and so much the rather, because he thought he should now finde them to be the lesse able to resist him, for that (as the tidings thereof were to him fresh) they had lately beene vauquished by Hanniball at the lake of Thrasimenus. Therefore because he would not be charged with many warres at once, he made peace Philip perswadeth the Greekes to concord. with the Etolians; not as they should think he did it, to the entent to make war in an other place, but as though it had beene for some great reguard that hee had of the good and quietnesse of all Greece, which he affirmed, was neuer in the like pearill by reason of the new Empires of the Romaines and Carthageniens, 
                      lately risen vp in the West, which had no other let to stop them out of Asia but onely this, that they were trying by the sword which of either of them should be principall and beare the soueraignety of both. For which partye soeuer gat the vpper hand, would no doubt vpon the victory and in the pride thereof, passe directly into the East. So that since he saw such a cloud of cruell and bloody warre rising out of Italy, and such a roring and thundering comming out of the west, that into what part of the world the victory fell the tempest thereof, would wash al things with a bloody shoure.
                  And although Greece had oftentimes before suffered great trouble, and many afflictions, by the warres sometime of the Persians, sometime of the  
                     Frenchmen, and sometime of the Macedons; yet they should finde, that all that euer before was past, and whatsoeuer they had endured, would bee a sporte to that which should ensue, if those Armies which now were fighting in Italy, s

                     Phillip hauing by this perswasion, and for this pretence, dislodged his tents, raised against the Etolians, and minding nothing but the warres of the Carthageniens

For howsoeuer they dissembled it, they stood in feare thereof, both for the ancient prowesse and actiuety of the Macedons, the renowne of the honorable, and seuerall conquests in the East, as also for Phyllip himselfe, who was enflamed with an earnest desire to become equall to Alexander in kinghthood, dominion, and chiualry, and whom they knew to be forward and actiue in feates of armes.
                  
                     Phillip therefore, when he vnderstood that the Carthageniens had vanquished the Romaines againe, sent his open defiance vnto them, and began to build  a fleete wherein to transport his army into Italy. Furthermore, he sent Ambassador

But afterward when it was reported to them, that Phillip went about to transport his army into Italy, they sent the Pretor Leuinus with an army well prepared & furnished, to stop him of his passage; who after he was arriued in Greece, with his faire and large promises, compelled the Etolians, to take warre in hand  against Phillip: and on the other side, Phillip exasperated what he could, to perswade the Etolians to ioyn warre with him against the Romaines. But in the meane time, the Dardanians began to wast the borders of Macedon, and hauing led away twenty thousand prisoners, constrained Phillip to

                  While these affaires had theyr performance, the Pretor Leuinus entring into a league with king Attalus, wasted the Countrey of Greece, with the which losse and destruction, the citties being amazed and striken into feare, they sent diuers Ambassadors to Phillip, desiring aide of him. The king of Illiria also his  next neighbor, bordering vpon the same side of Macedon, made incessant sute, that he would performe his promise. Further, the Macedons sollicyted him instanly, to reuenge the wasting of his owne countrey: with which so many and so waighty matters, he was so sore oppressed, and as it were besiedged at once, that he was in a maze which of them (the necessety being great in all) to remedy first.
                  
                     
Yet notwithstanding he promised to send friendly succours to euery one of them ere long, so deferring them, not because he was not able to performe as much as hee promised, but to the entent that by putting them all in comfort, he might retaine and keepe them his friends stil.

                     Antiochus king of Syria, being prouoked with an old grudge (which long had laine smothered, but not forgot) betweene these two realms, raised expeditiously a populous army, with which hostile forces, he conquered many citties and also set footting into Egypt. Ptolomy trembling for feare at these sodaine and vnexpected powers, and being taken vnprouided, and presently to bid him a resistance, besought Antyochus by his Ambassadors, that hee would  respit him but so long til he had raised a power, wherin he would try the fortune of his renowne in one aduenture.

And so forgetting quite the renowne of his name, and neglecting the maiesty of his kingdome, he spent the night in incontynency, and the day in voluptuous feasting.
                  Besides this the more to enflame his lecherous appetite, he had at his feastes musicall singing and dauncing. Neither could this King heere content himselfe with the beholding of other, but also like a maister of misrule or a Mercenary fidler, would play publikly vpon Instruments himselfe. These were the first plagues and priuy maladies broke out to greater sores, and were afterward the decay of his royall house: for not long after, both he and such Schollers  which from him as their tuter had tane theyr practise, they grew to such a lycentious liberty, and the harlot waxed so Impudent and bould, that the courte within the walles was not able to conteine her. For the vnspeakeable sinne that the King diurnally vsed with her brother Agathocles, made her the more to be bold and presume vpon the King, and to beare her selfe the more stately and arrogant.
                  And to the encreasement hereof, came to the court her mother Euanthe, with whose custome also the King taking a liking, shee with her daliance so allured his hart vnto her, that of her he begot two sonnes. By meanes whereof althese, thinking their security and foundation thereof now vnpossible to be  shooke, and not being content with the king, though they held the kingdome also; now they must come abroad to be seene in the open view and face of the world; now they must be saluted, now they must be waighted vpon. Agathocles sitting cheeke by cheeke with the king, in his regall throane, ruled the realme at his owne pleasure.

Neuerthelesse his conspiracy was not so concealed but it came to light, and for Iustice, the people  ran vpon Agathocles and killed him, and the Women in reuenge of Euridice were hanged vp vpon Gibbets.
                  And thus the notorious infamy of the realme being purged and put away, by the death of the king and the punishment of his strumpets, the men of Alexandria sent Ambassadors to the Romaines, desiring them to take vpon them the protection of their Orphan King, and the gouerment of his kingdome of Egypt, which they auouched that Phillip and Antiochus had already The Romans protectors of Egypt. bought and told, intending to deuide and part it between them. The Romaines very glad of this Ambassage, as they that sought occasion of Warre against Phillip, to be reuengd of his purpose & do them displeasure, in the time of their Warres with the Carthageniens. Besides, after they had in set  battell subdued the Carthagenians, and repulst Hanniball, inforcing him to slight, they feared no mannes puissance, nor the Hostility he coulde rayse more then Phillips, accounting with themselus, what a trouble and damage Pirrhus had put Italy vnto, as it were with so small a handfull of Macedons, and howe great enterprises the same people hadde atchiued in the East.
                  Hereupon Ambassadors were sent to Antiochus and Phillip, willing them least they inferre further daunger vppon their owne, not to molest and meddle with the kingdome of Egypt, nor the subiects thereof. Furthermore M. Lepidus vppon the acceptance of the former treaty, was dispatched with  commission into Egipt to take vpon him the protection of the child, and the administration of the realme.
                  Iust about the same time, the Ambassadors of Attalus king of Pergamus and the Ambassadors of the Rhodians came to Rome, heauily to complain of insusserable wrongs King Phillip had done vnto them.

Neuerthelesse, at length by much intreatance they grannted him a truce for two monthes, that a longer peace which could not be agreed vppon in Macedon, might be requested of the Senat in Rome.

In the meane season the peace  was reiected by the Senate, whereupon Phillip sollicitted the Tyrant Nabis to take his part, and ioyne with him against the romaines: so that when hee Philip maintaine th the Macedons against the Romans. had brought his hoast into the field, and his enemies were standing in order of battell against him, he beganne to incourage his men, rehearsing howe the Macedons had conquered the Persians, the Bactrians, the Indians, and in briefe all Asia, euen to the very vttermost border of the East; exhorting and aduising them, that so much more force and courage they ought to shew in this battell, as liberty is a thing of greater price, and shold rather be sought for then Dominion.

Also, that Hannibal was little or nothing inferriour vnto great Alexander; after whose expulsion out of Italy, they had subdued a great part of Affricke, being the thirde part of the world. Nor were the Macedons to be any thing the better esteemed of, by the ancient renowne of their predecessors, but according unto the power  and strength they were then fortified and strenthened withall, for their defence at that present.

And yet the Etolians being offended, that at their pleasure Macedon also was not taken from him and giuen to them, as a recompence in reguard of their paines taken in the warre, sent Ambassadors to Antiochus, who by flattering him, in aduauncing his puissance and chiualry, hoped thereby to inforce him to make warre against the Romaines, and in trust that as partakers therin, al Greece would take his part, graunted  their request.

Whereupon when he had inuaded Phenice and the other citties scituat in Syria, but vnder the dominion of Egypt, the Senat of Rome sent Ambassadors to him, and by them willing him to abstaine from the Orphans kingdome, both him, and which, was by the last will of his father soueraigne thereof, left in trust with them, and committed to their charge: who being sent away with a sleeuelesse answer, immediately

The king all the winter season giuing himselfe to riot and pastime was euery day making new marriages. On the contrary part Attalus the Romaine consull who was sent to those warres (with all diligence preparing men and armor withal other munition, artillery, and abylements for the warre) strengthened the citties that were in confederacy; allured such as were neuters, and in conclusion according as either part laid before for their furniture, so had they successe in what they vndertooke. In the first encounter, when the king saw Antiochus put to flight. his men retire and giue backe, his cowardise did not releeue them with fresh succors, but offered himselfe captaine of such as first ran away, and left his camp replenished with alriches to his enemy. When he had by flight escaped into Asia, while the Romans, were occupied in gathering the spoile, hee had  leisure to repent him that he had reiected Hannibals counsell, and thereupon Hannibal againe receiud to fauour. taking him into fauor againe, promised him he would order all his affaires fully according to his discretion. In the meane season he was aduertisd Liuinus Menenius a Roman captaine, appointed admirall of the sea by the Senat, was comming towards him with fourescore ships of warre; which tidings put him in cheerefull comforte to recouere his misfortune: Therefore he determined to encounter with him by the way, before the citties which as yet held their aliance with him, were reuolted to the Romaines, hoping to abolish the dishonor of discomfiture of Greece, by a new victory. But neither were the men of Asia able in this conflict to match with the Romaines, nor the ships of  like force and needefull resistance as were the Romaine Gallies, yet not withstanding the slaughter was the lesse, by reason of the pollicy, prouidence, and Hannibal be ing Admirall of the Nauy is ouercome. valor of the Captaine. The fame of this victory was not yet reported at Rome, and therefore the city staid the creating of their consuls, at which conuenticle and soleme assembly, none was thought fit nor of more sufficiency to bemade captaine, and haue commaund against Hanniball, then the brother of Affricanus, for that it was the peculiar worke of the Scipions, to vanquish the Carthageniens.
                  
                  
                     Lucius Scypio was created consull, and his brother Affricanus was giuen to him as his lieuetenant, to the entent Antiochus should vnderstand they had as  much confedence in their conqueror Scypio, as he had of his vanquished Hanniball. As the Scipions were conueying their host into Asia, word was brought to them, that the brunt of the warre in both places was already past the worst; so that they should finde Antiochus vanquished in battell on the land, and Hanniball ouercome at an honorable fight on the sea.
                  At their first arriuall, Antiochus sent Ambassadors vnto them to entreate a peace, sending moreouer as a peculiar present vnto Affricanus, his sonne, Antiochus seekes peace. whom the King had taken as he was passing ouer in a little barke; but Affricanus answered, that there was great difference which ought to be considered  betweene benifits done to any one person priuatly, and the benifits that were done for the publike-weale of a whole countrey, and the person of a father was naturall in himselfe, when the body of a common-weale, consisted in the infinitnesse of people, and the sinewes of many, which ought carefully to be preferd, not onely before children, but before the originall and life it selfe, from whence they had life. Wherfore as in curtesie he was bound, and both in nature

and humanity it was requisit, he returned the king harty thanks, for his honorable present, promising to reunite his bountious liberality, with some equall good turne and answerable kindnesse, if at any time it should lie in his owne priuate power so to do. But as touching Warre and peace, he wished him to expect from him no other then was lawfull betwixte enemy and enemy: neither that he would do more or lesse then was requisite to the behoose of his Countrey. For it was euer the disposition of his thoughtes, to intreat for the ransomming of his sonne; nor suffered he the Senat, though perswaded therunto to go about it, but as appertaind to his honor, he sayd alwaies he would recouer him by force of Armes, or loose him.

                     Antiochus hauing intelligence hereof, answered, he was not as yet so vtterly vanquished, that he should suffer himselfe to be spoiled of his kingdome, expressing that it was the next way to prouoke him to warre, rather then to allure him to peace. But while time gaue these two enemies leisure, for full preparing of both their armies, the Romains entring into Asia came to Troy,

It did the Troyans good, that their Lynage hauing conquered the West, and subdued Affricke, did now challenge the Empire of Asia also, as their auntient inheritance, and the rightful possession of their fore-fathers: saying it was happy fortune for Troy, that it was destroyed, considering how  luckely & prosperously it had risen vp againe: on the other side, the Romains had an immeasurable desire, to see the houses of their auncestors, the places where their for-fathers were bred and born, with the temples and Images of their Goddes.

There were of the enemies fifty thousand slaine, and a leauen thousand taken prisoners: yet notwithstanding when Antiochus desired peace, nothing was added to the former articles, for Affricanus answered, it was not the custom of the Romaines to be discouraged for losse, nor to be proud for prosperity. The cittyes they had taken they deuided among their confederats, iudging it a greater reward to the Romans to haue honour, then possessions: making it probable, it was meet for a Roman to challenge glory and fame, & to resigne  the superfluity of riches to his partakers.

                      in the meane time the Messenians and the Acheans fel first to contention, and not long after to publick battel for the soueraignty. In which battell Philopemenes the noble grand captain of the Acheans was taken prisoner, not throgh his own default, because he durst not fight for sauing of his life, but as he was about to bring his men in array that wer in the leaping of a ditch, his horse ouerthrew him, which his enemies espying clustered about him,  and ere he had time to recouer himselfe tooke him prisoner.
                  And yet the Messenians when they found him ouerthrown, whither it wer for feare of his prowesse, or for reuerence of his estate, durst not to kil him. But as though by surprizing him they had finished all the Warre, they led him about all the Citty in manner of a triumph, and the people ran out by heaps to meet him, as if their owne captaine, and not the captaine of their enemies had bin comming. And without question the Acheans his countrimen could not haue bene more desirous to haue seene him a Conqueror, if he had got the vpper hand, then were the Messenians his enemies, to behold him a prisoner, for they led him into a publick Theater, to the intent that young and old, from the cratch to the cradle, might generally behold  him, whom before they thought an incredible and impossible labor to bee vndertaken. From thence they conueyed him to prison, where for shame of the villany they had offered to so woorthy an estate, they gaue him poison, which he drunke with as cheereful and vndeiected acountenance, as if he should haue marched through his owne countrey, among his owne cittizens after he had woon the victory. But first he asked whither Lycortus the The courage of Philopemenes at his death. Lieutenant of the Acheans (whom he knew to be a man of best knowledge in feats of Arms next to himselfe) had escaped in safety or no. Of which when he was truly resolued that he was in safety, then the world goeth not altogither against the Acheans (quoth he) & with that word he gaue up the ghost.  Not long after the warre was renued, in which the Messenians being vanquished, suffered deserued punishment for putting Philopomenes to death.
                  In the mean season Antiochus K. of Syria, being greatly ouer charged with the tribute that he shold pay to the Romans, & seeing himself vanquished, & so grieuously burthened, whither it wer that he were compelled for want of The death of Antigonu. mony, or that he wer allurd with couetousnes, because he hoped vnder pre tence of necessity, which he was put vnto for the payment of the tribute, he he should be held the better excused, if he committed Sacriledge; foorthwith he assembled an army, and in the night assaulted the Temple of Iupiter, 
                      in which attempt, he and all his hoast were slaine by the inhabitants.
                  When many Cities of Greece wer come to Rome, to complaine of the iniuries that Phillip had done them, there was great contention in the Senatehouse, between Demetrius the sonne of Phillip, sent thither by his Father to excuse him to the Senat, and the Ambas of the Cityes: The young Prince being confounded with exclamation, suddenly held his peace, by which his shamefastnes, the senat being moued, gaue iudgement on his side.
                  
                     
Of this the King was aduertised by the decree of the Senat, to the entent he should vnderstand, he was not acquitted as guiltlesse, but rather pardoned for his sonnes sake, which though it were vpright, purchased vnto Demetrius not thankes for his behauiour in that Ambassage, but hatred thorough the maliciousnesse of backbiters. For with his brother Perses (who sought by all meanes to surprise him) it procured him enuy, and with his father (when he knew occasion of his acquittal) it procured him displeasure, disdaining that the person of his sonne, should be of more force with the Senat then the authority of the father, or the estimation of his estate, being a King Perses therefore perceiuing his fathers disease, made complants dayly vnto him of his brother Demetrius, 
                      and first brought a mistrust toward him, and shortly after into extreame displeasure, obiecting against him, that he sought the friendship of the Romaines to be the ruine of his father.
                  But not contented to haue proceeded thus far against his brother, he went about to entrap him by treason, and surmised he went about to vsurp the dignity of the kingdome: for proofe whereof, he brought in record, and sobbo

                  After Demetrius was thus put to death, Perses (as it wer the party being dispatched  out of the way, whom he feared to be his enemy) began to be not onely more slack in performing his duty, but also more stubborne against his father; behauing himselfe not like an heire, but a King. Phillip being highly offended with this misdemeanor and peruerse behauiour of his sonnes, and finding no counsell nor tender admonition of power to reclaime him, from time to time very vnpatiently bewailed the death of his sonne Demetrius, as a young plant that would haue borne to him better fruite, and he himselfe had better hope of. Whereupon mistrusting himselfe to be deceiued by some cautel treason he put the witnesses to torture.
                  Through which hauing boulted out their mischiefe, he was vexed as much  with the wickednesse of Perses, as with the vndeserued death of Demetrius: and he had (as by natural office he was bound) beene reuenged of the treason by punishing the offender, had not death preuented him of his purpose; for shortly The death of Phill

This pollicy seemed at the first to the men of Pontus to be but a mockery, to leaue weapons and sight with earthen potts.

                  When tidings hereof came to Rome, the Senat sent Ambassadors to cease the strife between both Kings, and demaunded to haue Hanniball yeelded vnto them. But Hanniball being aduertised of this condition, and fearing the euent The d

The Senat returnd an swere to the Laccdemonians, that they would send Ambassadours into Greece, in that behalfe, and that none of their confederates or any such as desired to be at league and friendship with them, should complaine to them, of any

                      wrongs but they would both desend them, and by restitution to be made, redresse them. But the Ambassadours had secretly in charge, to endeuour as by all perswasions, to dissolue the agreeable consent to frendly and faithfull vnion, that these citties of the Acheans had the one with the other, and to the intent they might the easier be brought to subiection, to order euery city to  be free of it selfe, and not to pertake aliance with any other, wherin who soeuer should pronounce against the many mcrciles warre, the Senate hadde decreed they should be compelled by force.
                  The Ambassadors about these affaires arriuing at Corinth, there summoned before them all the Princes of these withstanding citties, recited the decree ofthe Senat to them, & declared what they wer come to counsell them vnto; namely that it was expedient for them, that euery citty should be gouerned by their own laws, institutions, and customes, and not to be gouernd by the prouiding of others. But when this ambassage was notified to the multitude, insted of accepting this aduertisment of the Romaines, like mad men least ther shold be any partakers ofthe sorrainers which inhabited amongst  them, they fel to the massacre of them, and left not any stranger to soiourne in their dominion, nor had diminished their cruelty toward the Roman Am bas also, had not they by hauing priuat notice of them rescued themselus by slight. But so soone as the news hereof was by the Ambas. broght to Rome, the Senat apointed Mummius the Consull, to make warre against the Acheans, without protracting his endeuour or without delay, conueyed thither his Army, and hauing stoutly prouided for all necessaries in readinesse, appertained to further so great an enterprise, offered his enimies battel. While the Acheans as though they held it a matter of no more importance to be inuaded  by the Romanes, then by some other straggling enemy, were vtterly carelesse otherwayes then of ordinary resistance; sor minding the bootye which their enemies brought, and not the battell, whereby they shoulde be endangered themselues, they brought wagons to be laded home, with the spoiles of their enemies, and set their wiues and children in the mountaines to behold the conslict. But the battels were no sooner drawne to forme, and the incounter begun, but their wiues, children, & frends, which they broght to be the view of the warre, and to be witnesses of their valor, were testimonies of their ouerthrow, they were slain euerie souldior, euen in their deerest friends sight, and left them noioy of them to be comforted by, but the sorrowfull remembrance of their fall, to record all their liues after, their wiues  and childrens looking on, and beholding their husbands and Fathers ruine were made captiues and a preie to the enemy. The chief Citty Corinth was beaten downe, all the people sold by the drum, for an example to other citties. Corinth laide wast. After this, Antiochus K. of Syria, made war vpon Ptolomy the elder, his sisters sonne K. of Egypt, who was altogither giuen to sloath, and growne so

vnweeldy through dayly ryot, that he not onely ommitted al things appertaining to the estate and Office of a king, but also by meanes of ouermuch pampering of himselfe, became in a manner voyd of that reason which man by nature is inclined vnto. Being therefore in this warre expulsed his kingdome, he fled to Alexander, with whom he diuided his kingdome, who two togither so concluded, that they sent Ambassadours ioyntly to the Senat of Rome, requesting their help by vertue of the league that was confirmed and held between them.

At this time also, hee conquered the Iewes, who in the raigne of his father Demetrius, hauing gathered themselues into one body, had withdrawne their obedience from being subiect to the dominion of Macedon, & hauing set themselues at liberty, which  before were in bondage, they grew to such strength, that after the time of this Kings decease, there was no soueraigne of Macedon able to subingate their fealty by his dominion, but that in spight of them, they created a ruler among themselues, and disturbed all Sciria with their nations proceedings.

Whereof Mythridates hauing intelligence by a Damsel, punished the offence vpon the practisers thereof. 
                  
                  After when Winter drew on, he spent not the time in feasting but in seats of Armes, not in ydlenesse but in excercise, not among carpet knights, but in Iusting and Turnement, in running on foot, and on horsebacke, or else in wrestling and tryall of strength amongst his peeres: he also daily enured his men of Warre by daily excercise, to be enured to like labor and trauell, equall with himselfe. By meanes whereof, as by the Noblenes of his mind, and courage of his body, he was reputed inuincible himselfe, so his whole hoast trained vp vnder him, were held inuincible also.
                  He first entred into leage with Nicomedes, and then inuaded Paphlagonia, the which hauing conquered, hee diuided the benefit thereof to his captaines  and followers: When newes was deliuered to the Senate, that these kinges had subdued the kingdome, they sent Ambassadours to them both, He conqueteth Paphlagonia. commaunding them not onely to desist from what they had begunne, but withall to leaue it, without being any way indamaged by them in the same estate they found it in. But Mythridates accounting himselfe now of power

sufficient to resist the puissance of the Romaines, answered proudly, that the kingdome was his fathers by inheritance, and that he maruailed, (knowing no reason they had for it) they should make argument with him for his, more then they before had done with his father: vpon which answere being threatened in the behalfe of the Senat by the Ambassadors, he set so light by their menaces, that he forthwith inuaded Galicia. Nicomedies also (forasmuch as he was not able to make his party good, in the right of his kingdome by any title) answered he would surrender vp his to the lawful King. And thereupon changing the name of his owne sonne, he called him Phylomenes, by the name of the Kings of Paphlagonia. By which conueiance, vnder that counterfet pretext, he still  held the kingdome, as though he had restored it to the rightfull successor. So the Romaine Ambassadors being thus had in derision without other answer, then being scoffed by both, returned back to Rome.

Mythridates vnder pretence of helping his sisters sonne, driueth Nicomedes out of the realme, and by a cunning slight taketh awaye the life of his sisters son, and maketh one of his own sons king. The Cappadocians rebell, and set vp Artarathes, the brother of the before slaine king, whom Mythridates ouercommeth, and driueth him out of the realme. The saide Ariarathes dyeth, whereupon Nicomedes subborneth a beautifull young man, vnder the color of being  brother to the said Ariarathes to sue to the Senate of Rome for the kingdome. Mythridates doth the like with another of his sonnes. The Cappadocians being set at liberty desire a king. Ariobarzanes is appointed by the Senat. Mithrydates entereth into league with Tygranes king of Armenia, who expulseth Ariobarzanes out of Cappadocia. The Romaines sent their Lieutenants to set Aryobarzanes again in his kingdome. Mithridates maketh great preparations and furniture for the warres. He encouraged his souldiors and consulteth of the ordering of his warre. Ptolomye King of Cyrene obteining the Kingdome of Egipt after the death of his brother, worketh most extreame cruelty against the Authours of his promotion. The Ambassadors of Rome come to Alexandria. Ptolomy flieth out of Egipt, maketh warre  against the same, committeth most execrable cruelnesse against his owne children.

But now that there was no remedy, to redeem their slauery but by resistance; to haue libertye but by the law of war, to haue peace, vnlesse purchased now in so aduenturous a sight, nor reap plenty, vnlesse bought with the price of their enemies blood: he did expect & hope from their honorable resolutions, since al men wil draw their weapons against theeues, thogh not to defend their welth, yet knowing them merciles, to reuenge their deaths. But for asmuch as he purposed not to debate, whether it were prositable now to be in quyet, (considering they had a quarrel to answer, not against them that were suspected enemies in hart but such as had profest themselues apparantly, and wer now  to be encountered like deadly enemies in publick battel,) he desired to know by what means, and vpon what hope, they should maintaine the wars they had already begun, himself not doubting the victory, if they with him wold but continue harty corage in the act they had declared, both in the plot and pretence.

He had herd that Hannibal by the space of xvi. years, abode in Italy like a conqueror, and had sackt the citty of Rome it self, had not the secret malice, his owne countrimen bare to his fortunate successes, bin a greater hindrance to him, in that citties ouerthrow, then the power of his enemies. He had herd that the Frenchmen inhabiting on the otherside of the Alpes, entred into Italy, and there (notwithstanding the Romans) seated them selues in the most wealthiest citties of al the continent, and seized into their  hands, a larger peece of ground euery way, then their enemy had conquerd in Asia. Moreouer the said Frenchmen had not only vanquished the Romans but also taken their citty; in somuch that they left them no more ground in al the world whereon to billet themselues, but on a hill, from whence they were faine to remoue their enemy, not by battel, but by ransom. The which Frenchmen, (the report of whose name since hath bin so terrible to the Romans) he had to strengthen him and make succesfull his war. For there is no difference between the Frenchmen that inhabit Asia, and the Frenchmen that people Italy, but onely the distance of their dwellings asunder. As for their original, their prowes, and the maner of ordring their fight was al one;  seeing that those in Asia, must of force be of much more policy and wit, as they haue come a more long and tedious iourny throgh Sclauont

Furthermore that Italy it self, was neuer wel pleased with Rome since it was first builded, but that continually from year to year, incessant war hath bin made, by som for their liberty, and by others for the right of the Empire. Insomuch that many cities of Italy had vtterly destroid the Roman Army by the sword, & soone compeld them snamefully to creep vnder a yoke: and least he might seem to make too long  relation in matters of old time, euen at that present al Italy was vp in Armes ioyntly, togither with the Marses, not to demaund liberty, but society in the Empire, and in the city it self. Neither was the city Rome, oppressed more by the wars of their neighbors in Italy, then by the factions, and partakings of her Noblemen at home, wherby the ciuil vprores were more daungerous, then the forrain wars combersome. Besides these, the Cimbrians, that vnmesurable, disordered, and huge rabble of sauage and vnmercifull rascalles, were swarmed out of Germanie, of al which Nations, although the Romaines might be able to withstand the brunt, yet by al at once, they must be so oppressed,  that they could hardly haue leisure to resist his wars in hand. Wher fore occasion ought to bee taken while it was offered, both to the encreasement of their strength, and forwardinge their dissieignes, least if they stood still while their enemie had his hand ful, and neglected the good of opportunity, which lead them a path to safetye; they might like the Grashopper, sing in Summer, & starue in winter, rest one houre, & they & their postertiy

For it was not by him in question, whether Warre ought to be made or no, but how it might be so done to redound to their honor, and the ruine of the Romaines: neither did he seeke occasion now to make warre, for the controuersie was begun betweene them, from the time that they tooke from him in his nonage Phrigia the lesse, which they had giuen vnto his father as a reward for aiding them in their battell against Aristomicus, but had continued till now, and his greuances had beene faine to disgest wa

Besides, that countrey they had rest from him, Seleucus Callinicus had before giuen in  doury with his daughter to his great Graund-father Mithridates. They had also commaunded him to depart out of Paphlagonia, or else were ready to proclaime against him defiance, which Realme fell to his father not by force of armes, nor by conquest, but by adoption, and as a Legacy of a last will and Testament, made at the deaths of the rightfull Kings, and so consequently by inheritance: whereas notwithstanding al his humble obedience, to their seuere & bitter decrees, they were not at al moued to mitigate them, but rather resolued to beare themselues more cruelly against him. What impositions had they laide vpon him which he had refused; or what submission could they deuise which he had despised, or had not vsed towards them? Had he not at their institution,  surrendred Phrigia and Phaphlagonia? had he not by their appointment withdrawne his sonne out of Cappadocia, which he had conquered? And therefore was his by the law of armes? Which labour of his was by them vsurped, as if the fruite of other mens chiualry should be no further their owne, then they list? that they hauing no Empire of their owne, but that which they purchased and held by the sword, should deny that liberty to others, which they cherished in themselues? Did he not for their pleasure kyll Creston King of Bythinia, against whom the Senat had proclaimed warre? And yet for all these endeuors whereby he labored to be acceptable vnto them, whatsoeuer Gordius or Tygranes vndertooke, and was displeasing vnto them, was imputed altogether to be  animated and furthered by him.
                  Moreouer in despight of him, the Senat had of their owne voluntary wil & pleasure, set Cappadccia at liberty which countrey they themselucs had taken from other Nations. Afterward when the people of Cappadccia sued to haue Gordius for their king, not being able to keepe their country without commotions, through the want of a gouernor, they could by no sute nor intreaty, procure their consent thereunto, though hauing no other reason to withstand it but because he was accounted his friende. Nicomedes at their commaundement made warre vpon him, after which precept of theirs being by Nicomedes begun, they suffered him not to take such reuenge vpon him as befitted his  dignity, but they themselues sought to compell him to stand to their censure, since they had vndertooke to arbytrate the difference betweene them.

                  For the Scithians besides that they be well harnessed, and well harted, are also fensed, eyther with desarts and wast grounds, or else with cold and extreamity of weather, which bid the souldiors prepare, to abide both great trauell and perill: among which distresses, neither there was not almost any hope of reward, os so wandring an enimy, which had not only no mony, but not so much as a house to hide his head, or shelter himselfe in.
                  When in this warfare they were now entred into, there was a more delightfull hope to he cherished, for neither was the aire more temperate in all the worlde, then in Asia, the soile more fertill, nor more plentye of fayre and plentifull Citties; so that they shold spend a great part of the time, not  as in warfare, but as in feasting. And it was a question, whether the Warre should be more casie, or more profitable: whether they should aduenture vpon the spoile of the kingdome of Attalus, now next vnto them, or vppon Lydia and Ionia, so greatly renowned for theyr riches in auntient time, neyther of which, they shoulde neede to goe to fighte for, but to take possession of.
                  For all Asia was so desirous of their comming, that it seemed to him, he herd them call, and cry aloud to them, make speed. So great hatred to the Romains, had the greedy and rauenous dispositions of their Pro-consuls, the polling and exacting of their tole-gatherers, the wrongfull dealing in sutes  and controuersies in the Law, by their Officers, and generally the oppression of all parties, rooted in the harts of them.
                  Wherefore he willed them to do no more but follow him manfully, to take president from him, & ponder with themselus what so great an army might be able to effect, hauing such a captaine as himselfe, whom they themselues had seene, without the helpe of any of his souldiors, by his owne industrye, onely slue the king of Cappadocia, and seyzed his kingdome: who onely of all the men and worthy Conquerors that euer liued, conquered all the countries, bordering vppon the sea of Pontus and Scithia also, which before his time were so perrillous to all, that no man could trauel through them, nor  haue trafficke in safety.
                  As for his owne Iustice and liberality he would not refuse that his Souldiors which had had sufficient tryal and experience of them, shoulde beare Witnesse to the same, as of the which these were manifest tokens, that hee onely of all kinges, inioyed not soly the kingdomes that his Father possest

before him, but withal for his bountiousnesse and royalty, was a dopted to be heire of other forraigne realmes: as colchos, Paphlagonia, and Bosphorus, which he now peaceable held. When he had thus encouraged his Souldiers, alter the three and twenty yeare of his raigne, he entred into war against the Romans. 
                     He returneth to the stories of Egypt At that time in Egypt after the death of Ptolomy the King, Commissioners seated the other Ptolomy which raigned at cyrene, in possession of the kingdome; and contracted the Queene cleopatra, his sister to him to be his wife.
                  
                     Ptolomy reioycing that he had recouerd his brothers kingdom without battel, the which he knew his mother Cleopatra', and certaine of the Nobility, went priuatly to assure vnto his brothers sonne, to the great displeasure of all the  citty, caused all such as fauored the child to be put to death. The child himselfe he slue in his mothers armes, the very same day that he married her, in the The cruelty of Ptolomy. middest and heigth of all the feasting and Ceremonies of wedlock, and so he went to his wife and sisters nuptuall led all bestained with the blood of her sonne.
                  After which deede he was'as cruell and reuengsull to his other countrymen which had stood for him and called him to the kingdom. For he gaue his Souldiers leaue (which were strangers) to make slaughter of whom they would, so that dayly the massacre encreasing and the channels for want of other currant were supplied with blood: he also put away his sister, and tooke to wife her daughter, a faite young maiden hauing rauished her perforce, with which Tyrany  the people were to sore dismaid, that they shrunke from him, some one way some another, forsaking their natiue country like banished men, glad of any ground where they might secure themselues from him.
                  
                     Ptolomy being left alone with his Souldiers, in so great a Citty, when he saw himselfe Soueraigne of empty houses and not of men, made proclamation that what strangers soere, should freely come and inhabit the same; after whose resortthither and that the citty was againe replenisned, he went forth to meete the Romaine Ambassadors, Scipio Affricanus, Suprius Mumius, and Lucius Mettellus, which comforted the Senat, to see how the Rèalms of their confederats were ordered. But looke how cruell he had beene to his owne countreymen,  so much was he a laughing-stock to the Romaines. For he was yll visaged, a Ptolomy derided of the Roman Ambassadors. dwarffe by Stature, and had such a barell belly, that he seemed more like a beast then a man, which vnacustomed deformity, his smal shrill voyce, and his thin garments did more encrease, as though of set purpose, he had garnished those things to bee seene, which if he had any modest reguard of shame, he rather ought with all care to haue concealed.
                  After the daparture of the Ambass. (of whom Affricanus whilest he beheld the city, was himself a spectacle to the Alexandrians) Ptolomy being for his former cruelties, now hated of his alliance also, fled secretly out of the realme with his  sonne, whom he had begotten of his sister, and with his wife her own mothers paramour, for feare os treason. And hauing drawne together an host of hired Souldiers, he made warre both against his sister, and against his owne country. Afterward he sent for his eldest sonne from Cyrene, and because the Alexandrians should not make him King against him, which he onely misdoubted he put him to death.
                  
                     
Whereat his people no longer containing themselues to be sufferers of his murthers, the more to despight him, brake downe his Images, and tore down his pictures, set vp to continue the memorye of him in their mindes: which outrage he thinking to be done by the procurement of his sister, hee slue the son whom he had begotten by hir, and cutting the body in pieces, closed it in a basket, and sent it for a present to the mother, as shee was making a seast to solemnize the remembrance of her birth-day.
                  Which lamentable spectacle, and sorrowfull sight, not onely to the Q. her selfe, but also to the whole Citty, cast such a griefe amongst their ioyful meeting, that suddainely in all the Court, was nothing heard but mourning  and Lamentation. The Noblemen, conuerting themselues from feastinge to Funerals, presented before the people the mangled body, declaring what fruitles hope they ought to haue of their king, who had so cruelly murtherd his own children.

                  But this so gentle and fauorable demeanor of the Parthians toward Deme trius, proceeded not of any mercy naturally engraffed in that Nation, or in respect of allyance or affinity, but because they coueted the kingdome of Siria, entending to vse Demetrius as an Instrument against his Brother Antiochus, according as eyther the matter, the time, or the chance of the Warre should importune.
                  
                     Antiochus hearing thereof, thought by wisedome and foresight to preuent their subtill practise, and thereupon led his hoast (which he had hardned,  and inured through many Voyages and battels against his neighbors) Antiochus leadeth an hoast against the Parthia

For whereas he had in his hoast eight hundred thousand men of Warre, he had euermore three hundred thousand others, that followed with him. Of which the most part were Cookes, Bakers, Minstrils, and players of Enterludes. Of Gold and Siluer, he was so inriched with so great abundance, that euen the common soldiors ware their cloaths embrodered with gold; nay their plenty was so great, that they trod vnder their feet the Mettel, for the loue and desire of which, kingdoms haue bin dispeopled, children haue bin fatherles, and men haue willingly kild one another. 
                  
                  Moreouer all the furniture of his riches, were of cleane Siluer, as thogh he had prepared to banquetting and not to battel. At Anticchus first arriual, many kings of the East saluted him, and yeelded themselues and their kingdome as his tributaries and defenders. Fnally detesting the pride of the Parthians, it was not long ere it came to the encounter, wherein Antiochus getting the vper hand, in three seueral pitched fields, & therupon subduing Babilon by force, was accounted great: by Fortune whereof, all countries reuolted so greedily vnto him, that the Parthians had no more Dominion left them, then the bare soyle of the realm of Parthia. 
                     
                  
                  
                     Phrahartes now vpon this successe of Antiochus, sent Demetrius into Syria with an hoaste of Parthians, to inuade the kingdome; to the entente that by that policy, Antiochus might bee inforced to withdrawe himselfe out of Parthia, to the defence of his owne Realme. In the meane time because he could not ouercome Antiochus by force, he sought meanes to surprize him by policy.

                     Antycchus by reason he had such a multitude, dispersed all his army into the Cittyes, during the Winter season, which speaciall care of his was his vtter ouerthrow. For the Citties, finding themselues burthned with victualing of his host, and also iniurious demeanor of the Souldiers, reuolted againe to the Parthians, and at a dayappointed for the stratigem, all at one houre by trayterous conspiracy set vpon the host, as it was deuided in euery of there citties, and billeted in places seuerally, to the entent they being assalted all at once, A sudden cō spiracy against Antiochus. they should not be able one to come to the rescue of another.

But in his  way he met with the king of Parthians and his power, against whom he fought more valiantly himselfe, then did his host; wherein his valor not preua

                  By fortune of which good hap, it repented him that he let go Demetrius, and sent his men in post either to call him by entreaty, or if he denied compell him back. But Demetryus dreading so much which after was approued, made such speed, that he recouered his owne kingdome; whereby  the Parthians being thus disappointed of their trauell and expectation, returned to the king.

wherwith to pay his souldiers their wages, he commaunded an Image of victory, of Massie gold to be taken out of the Temple of Iupiter, couloring his Sacriledge with a pleasant scoffe, saying that Iupiter had lent him victory; so escaping for this wickednesse vnpunished, he thought it rather benefit for him, to go forward in that practise he had begun, then to be sorry for what was past: so hauing giuen commaundement to haue the Image of Iupiter rest out of the Temple also, formed of cleane Gold and of vnknowne waight, and that being withstood of the acte of this euill, hee was put to flight by the multitude that came to the rescue, and in his hope to escape was oppressed by the violence of a Tempest, forsaken of his followers, taken by  theeues, and spoiled and brought vnto Grypho, and there receiued his deserued death.
                  
                     Grypho by his fall, hauing fully recouered his fathers kingdome, and being deliuered from outward dangers, was assaulted, by the treason of his owne Mother, who being inflamed with the desire of Soucraignety, after shee had betraied her husband Demetrius, and murthered her other Sonne, for spight and malice, that her former authoritye should bee diminished, by the victorye of this her other sonne, shee offered him a cuppe of poyson, Desire of so

                  The Queene being by this meanes, conuicted of her mischieuous cntent by receiuing inwardly the poyson, she had prepared for her Sonne, was depriued of her life. Grypho hauing thus brought his Realme in quietnesse, The death of the Queene. not onely liued himselfe at harts ease, without either disturbed with forraigne inuasion, domesticke insurrection, or priuat treason, but also gouerned his kingdome in happy peace for the space of eight yeares after. The  which tearme expired, there arose an enemy to his kingdome, namely his owne brother Cyricenus, borne by his owne mother, but begot on her by his vncle Antiochus. Whom whilest he went about to bring to destruction, & rid out of the way by poyson, he stirred him the sooner to contend with him for the kingdome.
                  Among these inorderly discords of the Realme of Syria, dyed Ptolomy King of Egypt, leauing the Gouernment of the kingdome to his wife, and The death of Ptolomy. one of his Sonnes, which soeuer shee should choose and account most fit off, as though the state of Egypt should bee in better quiet, then the  Realme of Syria, when the Mother by giuing the kingdome to one of her Sonnes should make the other her enemy. Therefore whereas she was of her selfe most enclined to the younger sonne, the people compelled her to make choise of the elder. From whom (before shee gaue him the kingdome) she tooke away his wife, and hauing enioyned him to forgoe his most dearely beloued sister Cleopatra, she constrained him to take in marryage his younger

sister Seluce, wherein she dealt not like a mother betwixt her daughters, considering she tooke her husband from one, and gaue him to the other.
                  
                     Cleopatra thus being not so much put away by her husband, as by a violent deuorce separated from him by her mothers meanes, was married to Cyricenus in Syria. And to the entent she would not seeme to haue brought nothing else vnto him, then the bare name and title of a wife, she raised an host of men in Cyprus, and brought it to her husband for a doury.

a prince of excellent prowesse and actiuity. This Pharnax, thus disposing his Dominion from his children, was of opinion, that the kingdome and safetie thereof, ought more by him to be regarded, then the name of a Father, and it behooued him rather to prouide for his natiue country, then for his children, which he supposed he carefully did, in thus distributing his kingdome. Thus then at one time Mithridates in Parthia, and Eucratides in Bactria, both notable and worthy princes, began their raignes. But the Parthians had the happier fortune. For through the politicke gouernance of their king, they aspired to the soueraigne preheminence of the Empire. Whereas the Bactrians being tossed too and fro with the vncertaine fortune of the warres, lost not onely their kingdome, but also their liberty. For after they had wearied  themselues, with the long continuall warres of the Sogdians, Drangamtans, and Indians, last of all as men, halfe dead and out of hart, ere they were encountered, they were subdued by the Parthians, which were reputed weaker then themselues.

Whereupon, being  after fiue months siedge enlarged againe, he brought India vnder his subiection; from whence as he was returning homeward, he was slaine in his iourney by his own son, whom he had made fellow with him in the Empire: who nothing dissembling the vnnatural murther, but rather reioycing, as th

Mythridates being encreased in strength by their power, made one Bachasus regent of Media, and himselfe went into Hircania: at his returne  from whence, he made warre vpon the king of the Elymeans, whom he ouercame and annexed that realme also to his kingdome. And thereupon receiuing many countries by composition, hee enlarged the Empire, from the mountain Cancasus, euen vnto the riuer of Euphrates. Finally being taken with sickenesse, he dyed honourably in his old age, of no lesse fame and renown then his grandfather Arsaces.

                  In stead of him, his vncle Artabanus was created King. And the Scithians being contented with the victory, after they had wasted Parthia, returned into The 6.

After him succeeded his sonne Mythridates, who for his Noble acts was sur-named the great. For being enflamed The 7.

                     Mythridates King of the Parthians, after his warre in Armenia was for his cruelty deposed from the kingdome, by the counsell of the realme. His brother Horodes taking to him the power, (the royal seate being vacant) besiedged Babilon because his brother Mythridates was fled thither, so long vntill he constrained them for famine to yeld vp the town. Mythridates vpon confidence, that The S. king of Parthia. he was so neere of his kin, willingly submitted himselfe to his brother Horodes. But Horodes taking him rather for his enemy then a brother, commaunded him to be cruelly slaine before his face. After this he made Warre with the Romans, and destroyed their Graund-captaine Crassus, with his sonne, and al his Romaine host: his sonne Pacorus being sent to pursue the remnant of the Romaine battell, after that he had atcheiued many enterprizes in Syria, he Horodes cruelty towards his brother. 
                      was called home againe as mistrusted of his father. During whose absence, the host of the Parthians that hee left behinde him in Syria, was withall the Captaines thereof slaine by Cassius Lieuctenant to Crassus.
                  
                  These affaires thus ended, there arose the eiuill Warres betweene Cesar and Pompey, in which the Parthians tooke part with Pompey, both for the Warres betweene Cesar & Pompey. friendship that was between them and Pompey in his Warres against Mythridates, and also for the death of Crassus, whose sonne they heard say tooke part with Cesar, whom they suspected had falne to him, in hope to reuenge his fathers death, if Cesar should chance in this Warre to haue the vpper hand.  Therefore after that Pompey, and his adherents had bin giuen the ouerthrow, they both ministred aide to cassius and Brutus, against Augustus and Anthony, and also after the end of the Warre, entring into league with Labienus, vnder the conduct of Pacorus they wasted Syria and Asia, and gauca proud assault vpon the camp of Ventidius, who after cassius in the absence of Pacorus had giuen the Parthian army an ouerthrow.
                  But Ventidius pretending a counterfet feare, for all their allarme offered him, kept himselfe in, and suffered the Parthians a while to vaunt of their prosperity, The pollicy of Ventidius. and the cowardise of their enemies, at length when he thought them most merry and carelesse, he sent out part of his host vpon them, with whose suddaine, and vnexpected assault, the Parthians being dismaide fled scattering  to saue themselues.
                  While Pacorus supposing that his men which were fled, had withdrawne the Romaine Legions after them, assailed in hast the camp of Ventidius, in hope that he should haue found it without defendants. But Ventidius being prepared for such a skirmish, lead out the residue of the Legions which he had reserued: and in the conflict slew the whole band of the Parthians with their king Pacorus himselfe.
                  Neither did the Parthians at any time receiue a greater losse. When tidings heerof was brought into Parthia, Horodes the father of Pacorus, who lately before (hearing the Parthians had wasted Syria and inuaded Asia) had boasted  (that his sonne Pacorus was a conqueror of the Romaines) when he now heard of his death, and of the slaughter of his Armye, soddainely for sorrow fell mad.
                  Many daies after, he would not conuerse with any man, he would not take any sustinance, nor speake one word, whereby a man might suppose, hee had

bin as well taken dumbe, as frantick. After many daies expired, when sorrowe had losened his tongue, he spake of nothing but of Pacorus, he thought hee saw Pacorus, he thought he heard Pacorus, and to his imagination would make answers, and talke, as though he had beene in familiar communication with Horodes salleth mad. him; he would stand still as though he had stood with him, and by and by lamētably bewaile the losse of him. When long together he had thus mourned, another heauines redoubled griefe vpon this miserable old mā, namely which of his thirty sonnes he should ordaine king in Pacorus stead.
                  He had many concubins, of whom he begat all that youth, of which euery one making sute for her owne child, did as it were besiege the old mans mind, being at commotion within it selfe. But it was the destiny of the Parthians (in  the which it is an ordynary custome, to haue vnnaturall murtherers to their king) that the wickedest & vnhopefulest of them al, whose name was Phrahartes was substituted soueraigne; who no sooner in the regal seate, but as though, The

                  Neither ceased he his slaughter in the children. For when he perceiued the Noble men hated him for his outragious cruelty, continually practising against him, that there might be no man left to be nominated king, hee commaunded his own Son who had attained to mans estate, to be put to death. Against  this man, Anthony with sixteene of his strongest Legyon; made Warre, for ministring ayd against himselfe, and Cesar. But he was so contrariously afflicted in many battels, that he was enforced to make his retreate out of Parthia. Thorough which victory Phrahartes being made more proude, and that he persisted to dealemore cruelly then before, he was driuen into exile by his own subiects. Phrahar

                  Whereupon after long and earnest sute made by him vnto the countries bordering vpon Parthia, at the length he so perswaded the Scithians that thorough their ayd he was restored vnto his kingdome againe. In the time of his absence, the Parthyans had constituted one Tyridates King, who hearing of  the Seithians comming, fled with a great power of his friends to Cesar Augustus, who was making Warre at that time in Spaine, and brought with him to The x. Emp. the Emperor, the youngest sonne of Phrahartes for a pledge, whom thorough the negligence of such as were put in trust with him, he had stolne away.
                  Vpon knowledge whereof, Phrahartes forthwith sent his Ambassadors to Cesar, requiring of him to send him home his servant Tyridates, and his sonne with him. The Emperor when he heard the Ambassadors of Phrahartes, and vnderstood the requests of Tyridates (who also desired to haue aide of him to reseate him in the possession of the kingdome againe, assuring that Parthia for such grace should euer after be at the commaundement of the Romaines) answered,  how he would neither deliuer Tyridates into the hands of the Parthyans, nor yet minister aide to Tyridates against them.
                  Neuerthelesse, because it should not seeme to both, neither had obtained a part of their demaund, he sent Phrahartes his sonne without ransome, and allowed Tyridates honorable entertainement for him and his, so long as hee

should thinke fit to bide with the Romaines. After this hauing finished his wars in Spaine, when he came into Syria to set a stay in the affaires of the East, he put Phrahartes in such amazement, that to the entent he should not make Warre vpon Parthia, all the prisoners that were in the realme taken either of the army of Crassus, or of the army of Anthonie, were gathered together, and with al the banners and ensignes, that were suprized at those times, sent againe to Augustus. Moreouer Phrahartes gaue to Augustus, his sonnes and Nephewes in hostage: so that Augustus did more with the maiesty of his name, then any other Emperor could haue compelled by force of armes.

But Amulius hauing wrongfuly deposed his elder brother Numitor, to the intent no yssue male snoulde arise from the stocke of his brother, to challenge the crowne, compeld his daughter Rhea into a Nunry, there to lead all her life in vowed virginity, cloking his iniury with an honourable colour, that men might suppose she was not put there as a condemned persoane, but rather made chiefe prioresse of the place by election.

As she came and went oftentimes to the children, like as if it had bene her whelpes, A shepheard named Faustulus, perceiued the matter, and stealing them from the Wolfe, brought them vp like shepheards among his Cattell. Now whither it were  for that they were borne in the Groue of Mars, or for that they were nourished by a Wolfe, which is in the iurisdiction of Mars, it was beleeued for a manifest proofe, that they were the sonnes of Mars. The one of these was named Remus, and other Romulus. When they came to mans estate, they accustomed to try Maistries daily one with another, whereby they increased as well in strength, as in nimblenesse and swiftnesse. Wherefore when they had oftentimes manfully and pollitickly chased away theeues from stealing their cattell, Remus was taken by the said theeues, (and as though he hadde bin the the same himself, which he had prohibited others to do) was broght before the king, and there accused for a stealer of Numitors cattell. Whereupon the king deliuered him to Numitor, to punish him as he thoght good.  But Numitor hauing pittye of the youngman, had halfe a mistrust that hee shold be one of his Nephews that were made away, by reason he resembled his daughter so much in fauor and making, and also by reason, that the time of her deliuerance, was agreeable vnto his yeers.

                  As he was in doubtful perplexity with himselfe, Faustulus came suddenly in with Romulus, by whom being further instructed of the birth and bringing vp of the children, the youngmen made a conspiracy, and tooke weapon in hand, to reuenge their Mothers death, and Numitor to recouer the kingdome wrongfully withheld from him. Amulius being slaine, and Numitor 
                      restored to the crowne. Afterward the youngmen builded the Cittie of Rome. Which being finished, there was ordained a Senat of a hundred Elders, which were called fathers of the common-weale.
                  Then because their Neighbors disdained to marry their daughters to shepheardes, they rauisned the maidens of the Sahines, and hauing subdued the people that were next about them, first they woon the Empire of

After the death of Senanus king of the Segoregians (by whom the place to build the citty vpon was graunted) his son Comanus succeeding him in the kingdome, was inucgled against the Massilians by one of his Lordes, alledging that the time will come, that Marsielles should be the destruction of the people, that were next neighbors about it: wherefore it was to be suppressed now in that very rising, least afterward being suffred to grow stronger, it might oppresse him.
                  For the further manifestation whereof, he repeated this fable, how upon a time, a bitch being great with whelp, desired a shepheard to lend hir house  roome to whelpe in: the which being obteyned, she desired him againe, to respit hir solong, but till she might bring vp her whelpes: But at lengthe when they were ful grown, she and hir whelps were so strong, that she challenged the place to hir selfe for euer.

But a kinswoman of the kings be wrayed this treason, who being wont to play the goodfellowe with a certaine youngman of the Greeks, as she imbraced him, hauing pitty vppon him for his beauty, vtterred the matter vnto him, and councelled him to auoide the danger, and he forthwith declared the whole matter to the Officers of the citty. By meanes whereof, the treason comming to light, the Ligurians were laide hand on, and they that lay hidden in the rushes, were pulled out by the heels, and put euery man vnto the sword,  and in the end, the treason was turned vpon the kings owne head: For the Massilians slue the K. himselfe, and seuen thousand of his souldiors with him
                  From that day forward, the Massilians vppon their feastifull dayes, kept their gates shut, made good watch, set men to ward vpon the Walles, searched all strangers, tooke good heed, and euen as if they had made warre, so The fortunate successe of the Massiliens. kept they the citty in time of peace, such good order kept they among them selues at altimes, not so much in time of need, as to be

                  Moreouer they diuers times ouercame the Armies of the Carthagenians, when they made warre vppon them for taking their Fisher botes, and gaue them peace at their pleasure like conquerors. With the Spaniards they entred a league of amity, and with the Romaines they made a continuall confederacy

and aliance, almost from the first beginning of the foundation of the Citty, the which they obserued most faithfully, and to the vttermost of their power, aided them as their confederates, in all their enterprizes. Which thing, both made them to be bolder to trust to their owne strength, and also purchased them peace of their enemies. Wherfore at such time as Marsielles florished most in renowne of chiualry, and in abundance of riches, & was in the chiefe flower of her strength, suddainly al the people bordering about them, gathered themselues togither, to roote vppe the Name of the Massilians.

                  When he came into the Temple of Minerua, espying in the porches the ymage of the Goddesse, which he had seene in his dreame, he cryed out sodainly that it was euen she that had feared him in the night, and surely it was she that commaunded him to raise his siege. Whereupon greatly reioycing  with the Massilians, because he perceiued that the Goddes had such care & regarde ouer them, he gaue the Goddesse a chaine of Gold for an offering, and made a bonde of friendshippe with the Massilians, to continue for euer.
                  After that they had thus gotten peace, and established quietnesse, the the Massilian Ambassadors returning from Delphos, (whither they had bene sent to catry presents vnto Apollo,) heard say that the Citty of Rome was taken and burnt by the Frenchmen. Which tidinges when they had brought home, the Massilians proclamed an vniuersall mourning, as if it had bin for the death ofsome speciall friends, and gathered all their Gold togither, as  well priuate as publick, the which they sent to make vp the summe, that the Frenchmen demaunded of the Romaines for their ransom, and to grant them peace.

This man was the first that sought after the pepetuall dictatorship: For France being conquered by him, within the space of ten yeares, and Britanny being then first assailed, and the Germaines being driuen into the woods and moores; he departed into Italy, and with the same his accustomed celerity appeased the Spanish tumultes hee ouerthrew Pompey the great, in a battel at Pharsalis, and when he had triumphed ouer all his enemies, at length he being wounded, with 23. woundes, by the conspiracy, of his dearest friends (as he esteemed them) died, in the  56 yeare of his age.

This man whose name was, Claudius Tyberius Nero, was eloquently caled of Iesters Caldius Biberius Nero, he was skilfull inough in millitary discipline, and fortunat inough vnder Augustus before he was made Emperor, so that the gouernment of the commmon-wealth was not without  cause committed vnto him.
                  He had a certaine knowledge of learning, wherein he was more excellent then in eloquence; but he was of an euill nature, of a cruel, couetous, and treacherous disposition, faining that he would do those things, which he neare meant; seeming offended with those, of whom he tooke counsel: and seeming to beare goodwill, to those whom he hated. He was better for suddaine answers, and counsels, then long deliberated. Finally, he fainedly refused the Empire, deriued from his auncestors, the which thing he had subtilty brought to passe, cruelly searching out, what men did say or thinke of him, which thing  was the destruction of al good and vpright men. For the wringing out of their mindes by long speeches, that they thought the greatnesse of the affaires of the Empire did decline, according to his fained iudgement, their last destruction immediatly followed. This man brought the Cappado

Before he tooke vpon him the Empire, he was deare, and beloued of all men: but in his raigne he was such an one, that it was rightly said of him, amongst the common people, that there was neuer a more cruell Lord then he. Finally he defiled his three sisters. He went in the habit of his Goddes, and affirmed himselfe to be Iupiter for his incest, and amongst the drunkards he affirmed himselfe to be Bacchus, of whome I  doubt whither this be meet to be recorded, (except because it is requisite to know all things concerning Princes) that wicked persons at leaste wise may decline from such things, for the feare of an il report. In his pallace hee caused the Noble Matrons to be subiect to open lust. He first caused himselfe to be called Lord, hauing a crowne set on his head.

This man when the Senat had decreed, that the stocke of the Caesars should he rooted out, lying hid in a filthy hole, being found of the souldiors, because he was timorous and did seeme tractably milde, was made Emperor. He was subiect vnto drunkennesse, gluttony, and lust, being cowardly, and almost blockish, sluggish, & fearefull, & at commaunde of his free seruants, and of his wife: In this time Seribonianiu Camillus being made gouernour amongst the Dalmatians, was foorthwith slaine.

But if any man did abhorre such silthy deeds, this crime being set vpon him, he was punished on himselfe, and all  his familye, that he might rather seeme to be a subiect to the Emperor her husband, then to one that was married vnto the Emperor: so his sree seruantes hauing gotten the highest authoritye, defiled all thinges with their Whoredomes, banisnments, slaughter, and prescriptions.

He patiently indured the insurrections of his friends, answering with sporting speeches, to their reproches, for he was a most plesant prince,  and when Licinius Mucianus presuming ouermuch of his merites, because by his aide the Emperor obtained the Empire, he altered that opinion, by vsing one that was samiliar to them both, saying onely to him, you know I am a man.

This man at the first fained clemency, neither to be so cowardly as he was, seemed more tollerable both in the time of peace and warre: therefore he vanquished the Cattians and the Germans, and made most iust Lawes. He builded many houses in Rome, eyther  begun afore, or from the foundations: He repaired the bookes which were consumed with burning, copies being sent for euery where, especially from Alexandria. He was so skilful an Archer, that he would shoot his arrowes betwix: the fingers of a mans hand being stretched out a farre off. Afterwards he waxing cruel through murders, began to punish good men, and after the manner of Caligula, he constrained men to call him Lord, and God, and all tokens of honor.

Whereupon it is gathered that the Citty of Rome hath encreased through the vertue of strangers. For who was more wise, or moderate then Nerua? Who more deuine then Traian? Who more excellent then Adrian? Cocceus Nerua, was borne in the towne of Neruia, Raigned twelue months ten daies. This man when he tooke on him the Empire, forthwith there was a rumor, that Domitian liued, for which cause he was so affraid, that his countenance being changed, and his voice being lost, he was scant able to stand: but he being encouraged by Perthenius, & fresn confidence being taken, he returned to his accustomed mildenesse. Who being  ioyfully receiued of the whole Senat, Arrius Antoninus alone of al men (being a stout man and most friendly to him, wisely obseruing the estate of those that beare rule) embraced him; saying, that he greatly reioyced for the Senat, the people, and also the prouinces; but for himselfe nothing at all: For whom, it was better alwaies to sport at euill Princes, then that one sustaining the waight of so great a burthen, should be subiect not onely to troubles and dangers, but also to the report of all enemies, and friends, who since they presume that they deserue all things, if they haue extorted any thing, are more cruell then very enemyes themselues.

This man to the intent he might not be terrified by the accesse of ill-willers, is so admonished by the saying of Mauritius a constant man, who being familiar with him at supper, when he saw to be present Vetentones who had beene Consul, notwithstanding had persecuted many with Domitian with secret obiections, amongest their talke mention being made of Catulus, a great brauler, Nerua sayd, What would he haue don now if he had liued with Domitian? he would saied Mauritius haue supt with vs. This Nerua a very often and most skilfull taker away of discords,  He remoued Calphurnius Crassus to Tarentam with his wife, temting the goodwils of the Souldiers with great promises, the Senators blaming his ouermuch linity, and when the murtherers of Domitian were required to bee put to death, he took so great griese thereupon in his minde, that hee could not avoid vomite, nor the violence of his belly, also he vehemently withstood the same; saying that it was better to dye, then to defile the authority of the Empire, the authors being b

But the Souldiers, letting alone their Prince, they killed Petronius, with one stroke, but Perthenius his members were first cut off and cast in his face: Gasperius being redeemed with great costs, who being more insolent in so cruell a wickednesse, constrained Nerua to giue thankes to his Souldiers before the people, bycause they had taken away the  worst, and most wicked of all men. This man adopted Traian in the place of a sonne, and for parte of the Empire: with whom he liued three months: who on a certain night waxing angry when he cried out agninst on Regulus with a very loud voice, he was taken away with sweate. The same day wherein he died there was an eclipse of the Sunne.
                  
                     
                     VLpius Traianus borne in the citty Tody, was called Vlpius of his Grandfather, Traianus of Traius the first of his Mothers stock, or else so called after the name of his father Traianus, & he raigned 20. years. This man shewed himselfe such an one to the commonwealth, as the wonderfull wits of most excellent authors were hardly able to expresse. This man tooke on the Empire at Agrippina, a Noble Colony of France, vsing diligence in warlike affaires, lenity in ciuill affayres, and liberality in helping the citties. And seeing there are two things which are desired of excellent Princes, Deuotenesse at home, valor in Warre, and wisedome on both sides, there was so great a quantity of the Noblest gifts in him, that he seemed to be mingled with a certaine temperature of vertue, but for that he was a little giuen to meat, and  wine: he was liberal towards his friends, and to vse their societies, as equall vnto them in estate of life.
                  This man in the honor of Sura, by whose industry he had gotten the Empire, builded certaine Banes. Of whom it seemed vaine to endeuor to declare al things particularly, since that it was sufficient to haue spoken of him; for he was patyent of trauel, studious of euery best thing, and warlike, and dyd loue more, more simple wittes, or most learned; although himselfe was of smal knowledge, and a little eloquent. But aswel an inuentor of Iustice, and of new, humain, and Diuine right, as an obseruer of auncient. Al which seemed  so much the greater, because the Romaine estate, being as it were clean destroyed and cast to the ground by many and cruel tyrants, he was thoght to haue bene fitly sent by the diuine prouidence for a remedy of so great miseries, euen for that many wonders did foreshew his comming into the Empire: Amongst which an especial one, that a Crow spake from the toppe of the capitol in the Athenian tongue, Kalos estai. The ashes of this mans body being burned wer broght to Rome, and buried vnder hys piller in the toomb of Traian, and his Image being layd on him, as those that tryumph are wont to do, was caried into the citry, the senat & the army going before the same. At that time the ryuer Tyber oueflowed much more perniciously then in the  raigne of Nerua, with a great destruction of houses and a grieuous Earthquake, and a cruel pestilence, and famine, and burnings, were made throgh many prouinces. Al which Traian very much helped by exquisit remedies: ordaining that no house should be higher then threescore foot, by reason of the easie downfals, and the great charges to repaire them if any such things should happen. Wherefore he was worthily called a Father of his country. He lyued sixty foure yeares.

                     Aelius Adrianus of the Italian race, being a cozen to Traian the Prince, was borne at Adria, which town standing in the country of Pua gaue name to the Adriatique sea. He raigned 12. years. He was deuoutly affected to the Greek toong, and was for that cause termed in derision Graeculus. He augmented al the Athenian studies, not only with his Poetry, but with al other sciences of singing, playing, and phisick, geometry, painting, & liming, and next to the Policleti & Euphranorae. He exceled in works of brasse and Marble, insomuch as one wold haue thoght he had bin made for these only purposes, for neuer had humain affaires such an exquisite curious elegancy,  as by the work of his hands: & yet would he remember (which is incredible) sundry businesse, diuers places, souldiors, men absent, & the different names of many, making the greatest labors of wit, the ordinary exercises of his life; for when with his own legs he had gon throgh al the prouinces, and peruerting the flock of his followers, increased sundry orders, when he had restored al the villages, raising into the hundreds of the Legions, & military Garrisons, both smiths, enginers, carpenters, and al other necessary artificers, for the building of the wals or for the adorning of them.

The Bactrians, Indians, and Hireanians, vpon proofe of the iustice of such an Emperor, sent Am. vnto him, who adorned his actions with beauty and pleasantnes of his person, being both tall and valiant.

When he had raigned 23. yeares thorough a feauer he died, 12.

He made a wall in great Brittayne, crosse the land from sea to Sea, containing at the least 32. M. paces  in length. He was the least Souldier of all the Emperors that euer were before him, quick of conccit, constant in al purposes vntil he had accomplished them, and where he inclined to fauour, he did it with a wonderfull and perpetuall grace, being diligent to seeke out secrets, and liberall in his rewards. He was alike vehement towards his friends and enemies, for hee inriched Lateranus Chilo and Amilynus Bassvs, and in the chiefe and memorable houses of the Parthyans, and the Lateranes. He permitted no man in his dominion to sell honors, he was sufficiently well instructed in the latine, but more eloquent in the Affrick tongue, for he was borne at Liptis in Affrica. Being not able to endure the extreamety of paine in al the members of his body, especially in his feete, in stead of poison which hee was denied, he fed vpon in greedy maner  such a quantity of grosse and heauy meate, which he not being able to disgest, did bring him into a crudity or surfet, and so died in the 20. yeare of of his age.

By his birth and education a  pastoral man, but yet a louer and fauorer of al wise, vertuous, and learned men: of a quiet disposition, but greedy of Wine, whereby in his drunkennesse hee commaunded many vnlawful things, whereof he afterward repented, and gaue this charge to all his followers that they should not execute his desires except he was sober, or had commaunded in the morning.

                     COnstantinus the sonne of Constantius, the Emperor and Helena raigned  30. yeares. He being a youth was a pledge in the citty of Rome vnder Galerius for Religion, fled away and to avoide them that pursued him to take him, slew all the common beastes he met by the way, and so came to his father into Britannia, and so it happened that at that time Constantius his father died. After whose death, by the consent of all his present friends, especially Erocus King of Alemanes, who accompanied his father constantius, he tooke vpon him the Empire. He married his sister constantia to Licinius at Millane, and made Caesars his sonne crispus, borne by Mineruina his concubin, and constantius his sonne of the same age, & Licinius the son of Licinius being twenty months olde. But as Empires do hardly continue in concord, so there arose dissention betwixt Licinius and constantinus, and first of all constantine, fell vpon  the Army of Licinius at Cibalae in the night time, neer to the lake Hiulca, whereupon Lycinius sled to Bizantium and there created Martinianus caesar. Afterward constantine hauing a stronger army, constrained Licinius to offer vp his imperiall gowne by the hands of his wife, vpon condition of his owne life. Then was he sent to Thessalonica, and not long after, both he and Martinianus were strangled. Licinius being 60. yeares old, and had raigned 14. yeares, being of infinite auarice, subiect to venery, very sharp, and not a little impatient. He was a great enemy to learning, especially foraine studies, calling it thorough his ignorance a poyson and publike Pestilence. He was well affected to husbandry and poor rusticks, because he was norished among such people:  a good obseruer of Martiall discspline, and most superstitious in the institutions of former ages. He was a diligent repressor of Eunuches and Courtiers, calling them, the mothes and frettes of the Pallace. Constantine hauing thus gotten the whole Empire, being happy in gouernment, and prosperous in the Warres, by the instigation (as it is thought) of his wife Fausta, put his sonne crispus to death. Afterward he being blamed by his mother Helena sor that action, caused his saide wife Fausta to be killed in a scalding bathe. He was aboue measure desirous of praise, and finding the name of Traian written vpon the walles of many of the pallaces, he called him a wall-flower. He built a bridge ouer Danubius, setting forth the Emperiall robes with precious stones, and  wearing a diade me continually. He was qualified and enabled for many things, taking away calumniations by sharp lawes, nourishing a good leters, arts, and learning. He himselfe would read, write, hear Ambastages, and the complaints of the prouinces. He made his own sonnes and Dalmatius his brothers soone, Caesars, and liued 71. yeares, raigning almost halfe of them alone, 13. yeares

and so died of a natural disease, being more giuen to derision then to affabilaty. Whereupon it was prouerbially called Tracalla, who in his first ten yeares was excellent, in his next twelue yeares a robber, and his ten last yeares a child and vngouerned puple, spending immoderately. His body was buried in Bizantium which after his name was called Constantinople, after whose death the souldiers slue Dalmatius: By which accident the Romaine Empire was diuided into three parts. Betwixt Constantinus, Constantius, and Constans, his three Sonnes, Constantine had al beyond the Alpes, Constantius began at the shore of Propontus, and so ruled all Asia and the East. Constans raigned ouer Italy, Illiricum, Affricke, Dalmatia, Thracia, Macedonia, and Achata.

In the meane time Constantius and Constans fell at variaunce about the right of Italy. While that Constantius being drunke, and in the likenesse of a robber, ranged into his brothers countrey, he was taken and beheaded, and cast into the Riuer Alsa, not far srom Aquyliea. Constans giuen much to hunting, while he wandered thorough forrests and wild Woods, Chrestyus, Marcellinus, and Magnentius, with some other  millitary men conspired his death, who hauing agreed vpon the day, Marcellinus did inuite many to supper as though he would celebrate the birth day of his sonne. Wherefore the banquet being late in the night Magnentius a rose, saying that he would goe ease his body, and then put on a venerable habite. Which when constans vnderstood he made meanes to fly away, but was ouertaken and slaine by Gayon, at Halena neere Pyrence, 13. yeares after he was made Emperor, for he was Caesar 3. yeares before, and so he liued 27. yeares. He was a lame man in his feete, and had the gout in the ioynts of his hands, he was fortunate, for the temperance of the ayre in his dominion, for aboundance of fruites, and for not being annoyed with the Barbarians, which benifites had beene greater if he had aduanced worthy men Lieutenants, and not sold those  places. When his death was knowne Petrainus, the generall of the Souldiers, tooke vpon him the Empire in Pannonia at Mursia. From whom Constantius not long after tooke awaye the kingdome, who liued to a great age giuing himselfe to all voluptuousnesse, being easie to be ouertaken with folly.

Then was there a great battayle at Mursia, betwixt Constantius and Magnentius, where Magnentius was ouercome, in which conslict the

greatest ability of the Romain Empire, was almost o uerturned. After that Magnentius fled into Italy, and slue many of his persecutors at Thicanum who followed him audauciously, without any good counsel, as it often falleth out in victories. Not long after being in a streight at Lions, a piece of a Wall being throwne downe vpon him, by thrusting a sworde in secret against it, Hee was wounded to death, continually bleeding at the nose, vntil his expiration which was in the two and fiftieth moneth of his regiment, and the fiftieth yeare of his age. His parents were of Gallia, he was learned and a good Orator, but of a proud minde, and immoderately fearefull, yet politicke to couer that passion with precepts of audacity. Decentius when he heard of his death strangled himselfe  with a cord, and at that time Gallus Caesar was slaine by Constantius, in the 4. yeare of his gouernment.

The Nobles were all ouerthrowne, and their borders rendred to the Roman possession, and afterward fighting with the Almains, took their king Badomarius.

                     GRatianus was borne at Sirmium and raigned with his father Valentinian eight years, and eighty five daies with his vnckle, and brother three

yeares, with the same brother, and Theodosius foure years, and with them all and Arcadius six months.
                  This Emperour ouerthrew thirty thousande Almans at Argentoratum in Gallia. When he vnderstood that the Gothes, Triballians, the Hunnes, and Alant the basest people of the world, did possesse, Thracia and Dacia, as though those lands had bene their inheritance, so that by their meanes the name of the Romaines was in daunger to be vtterly extinct.

His greatest pleasure was to beleeue the diuine law, and to attaine those things which he had therein destinated to himselfe, for he was a conquerour of lust, pleasures, and delicates. And he had bin good to all, if he had giuen his mind to sway the commonwealth, wherein he was defectiue both in knowledge to rule, or inclination to learne that faculty.

In his time Maximius, which  rebelled in Britannia, came into Gallia, and was there receyued by those Legyons which were discontented with Gratian, and so put him to slight, wherin he dyed after he had lyued onely 28. yeares.

Hee was made Emp. by Gratian the Emp. at Sirmium, and ruled the world 27. years: and men  say that his parents were monished in a dreame to cal him Theodosius, which signifieth as much as Giuen of God. And there was an Oracle in Asia, that one shold succeed Valeus in the Empire, whose name shold begin with the Greeke Letters, Theta, Epsilon, Omicron, and Delta wherwithall Theodosius was deceiued and iustly put to death for his ambitious desire of rule. Theodosius was the most famous enlarger and defender of the common-wealth, for in dyuers battelles he ouerthrew the H

                        nnes and Gothes which oppressed the Empire in the time of Valeus. At the request of the Persians, he made peace with them, and slue Miximius the Tyrant (which had slaine Gratyan) at Aquilei, with his sonne Victor, whom he had made Emperor, within the yeares of infancy:  he likewise put downe Eugenius the tyrant, and Arbogastes with their ten thousand fighting men. This Eugentus being confident in the forces of Arbogastes, after he hade slaine Valentinianus at Vyenna, called himselfe Emperour, but shortlye after he lost his life and Empire togither.

This Iustinianus commanded that the Temple of Sophia should be built at Constantinople, and in his time, there was so great a famine in Italy, that the people were forced to eat mans flesh.  
                     Siluerius the Bishop of Rome, by the fraud of Theodora Ivstinianus wife, was conuicted by false witnesse, and by Bellisarius sent into exile, wherein hee dyed.

                     IVstinivs the Nephew of Iustinianus by his daghter, and an earnest follower of Iustinius, was for that cause alway nourished in court. He was of an easie disposition, and giuen to deserue the good opinion of men, by hie own liberality, by Iustinianvs he was proclaimed Emperor. He made a leagu with  the Persians, remitting the annuall tribute which was payed to them by the Romaines. The Lumbards a people of Germany, by the perswasion of Narses, whom the Emperour had vniustly prescribed broke into Italy, which from Albuinvs vnto Desiderivs by the space of three hundred & foure years they held distinguished into seueral regiments. For Sophia wrot vnto Narses, who was an Euunuch that hee shoulde reture to spin womens worke. To whome Narses returned to this answer, that he would spin such a thread, as she shold neuer be able to breake. Iustinivs fell from his liberality to auarice, and also from true christianity to the heresie of Pelagivs, sending Longivs into the place of Narses (whom he had set at liberty) and instituted the Exarchatship 
                      a new kind of Magistracy.
                  This was ordained after christ fiue hundred threescore and eleuen years, and in the foure thousand fiue hundred and thirty fourth year of the world. By this Iustinyus, that he should be the Viceroy of the Empyre in Italy, and shoulde haue power to confirme the election of Popes, it endured one hundred threescore and foure yeares. This Iustinius dyed through a sickenesse in his feet, in the eleuenth yeare of his raigne. In his time the Armenians receiued the christian faith, and Monothelites spread their heresie, against whom he assembled a hundred and fifty Bishops at Consiantinople in counsell to condemne them. In which sinode it was permitted to the Greeke priests ro retain  wiues but not to the Latines.

which were long hidden in a lake of Water, and discouered vnto him. In the East he often time constrained the Persians to keep within their borders, & receiued Mesopotamia, sending backe the Persian captains honourably cloathed into their owne country, when the Lumbards breaking their league had along time besiedged Rome, and pressing to the Wals to take it, they were repelled by strange and vnwonted shewers of rain, and there followed after those shewers as great a drought, whereby all maner of victuall grew exceeding scarce. If the affaires of Tiberius had as well succeeded in the West, as they did in the East, his happines had bin of singular note. He adopted his son in law Mauritius and committed to him the present gouernement of the  Empire, in the presence of Iohn the Patriarch of constantinople, who crowned him, and of the whole Senate, and so raigned seuen yeares, liuing in all good opinion of piety and liberality.

He was an example of patience and fortitude, for seeing his wife and sons slaine before his face, hee cryed out saying.

He caused Olimptas the Exarchat to apprehend Martin the first of that name, Pope of Rome, and to send him into exile wherein he died, by cause in a sinode, hee deposed Paule the patriach, and allowed the condemnation of Cirus, Alexandrius, Sergius, and Pyrrhus. He was ouercome by the Saracens and ranne away. Afterward  giuing them hostages, hee obtained of them leaue to goe into Italy, and to deliuer it from the Tyranny of the Lumbards, leauing his sonne Constantinus at home, hee came by sea to Tarentum, tooke Luce

Vitalianus the Pope met him without the city, and whatsoeuer he found ther in the ancient Monuments, precious or rare, hee made spoyle thereof, and tooke it away with him, not sparing the brazen tyles of Pantheon. After twelue dayes he went into Sicily, where he was slain by his owne followers, bycause of his couetous exaction of trybute, hauing liued in the Empire twenty and seauen yeares.

He was by his Dukes Leontius, Tyberius and Absimarus, and Callinicus the Patriarch, depriued of his nose and eares in the tenth yeare of his regiment, and so dispossessed of the Empire, banished into Chersonesus. About this time Childeric the second, King of France with his wife great with child was slaine by Rodillus, whom a litle before he had caused to be whipped at a post.

Afterward by the helpe of Sergius the second of that name, Bishop of Rome,  was there a peace concluded, vpon condition that Lotharius shoulde enioy with the title of Emperor all Italy and Gallia Narbonensis, Lewes should haue Germany, and Charles France to the Ocean, and ther was added to the

Afterward in the fifteenth yeare of his raigne, he departed this life, leauing the Empire to Lewes his son, whom 5. years before he had made co-partner of his Empire, &c. and being induced with remorse of aduerse desseigues (as some men suppose) he relinquished the Empire, and led a monasticall life in the monastery of Pruma.

Leauing Italy, at his returne into Germany, after the death of his father, he liued at continuall discord with Charles king of Fraunce for the kingdome of Austrasia, which belonged to Lotharius, & Charles did absolutely challenge. But the difference compounded, he presently after dyed at Millain, when he had raigned xxi. yeares, leauing behinde him two sons, Charles and Lewes; this king of France, that of Germany. Before all men liuing, hee most esteemed Nicolas the first, gracing his inauguration with his presence, and in all  their counsels, mutually assisting one another.

To make experiment of the faithfulnes and industry  of the Watch of the citty, one night changing his apparrell and furniture, he secretly & alone stole out of the court, and entring the first watch, by bestowing a liberall rewarde vpon the watchmen, he quitted himselfe of further trouble, and so passed on to the second: where arrming, and thinkeing to do with them as with the former, was well beaten for his offer, and cast into prison. The next day hee bountifully rewarded these rough and trusty Warders, but the former he expeld the citty, & confiscated theyr goods. About this time Dalmatia and Selauonia receiued the christian religion.

Departing from thence, he restored Lewes King of Fraunce to his pristinate

estate, whome some of his Nobility had before deposed, and cast into prison. He deposed Pope Iohn accused of many crimes, and in his steed placed Leo. He droue Beslaus from the kingdome of Bohemia for the slaughter of his brothers. He plagued the Hungars which wasted Italy, in one conflict whereof, three petty Kings of Hungary being taken by the Germans, were hanged much against the mind of the Emperor. Berengarius and his son Albert being ouerthrowne in battell, the one fled into Constantinople, and the other into Austria, and there ended their dayes in misery. And this was the end of the Emperors, or the kings, or the tyrants (tearme them as yee wil) which arose in Rome, in Constantinople and Italy. Things thus dispatched, he came to Rome, and there being saluted Emperour and Augustus by the  whole people, he was the first of the Germans that was annointed and crowby the Bishop of Rome: he died after he had raigned 36. yeares. he was the first of the Emperors that gaue that forme of oath to the Pope, which is extant 63. distinction.

A while after, both hee and his sons being taken by Constantine (intending the like against constantine, as they did against their father, fel into the same pit, which they digged for another, the one was confined into Proconesse, the other into Lesbus.

But after his iourney into Asia against the Saracens, which hapned not according to his hopes, he suddenly chaunged, and gaue himselfe wholy to sloath and auarice. And a while after, by the treason of Zoe, a most lasciuious and barren woman, and Michaell Paphlagon the adulterer, he was drowned in  Bathing, when he had reigned 5. years and a halfe.

But the Emperor returned into Saxony, Gregorye the. 5. was forced from the citty by Iohn the Antipope. Which Otho hearing, in a rage, gathered his forces, returning into Italy, and took Rome by force. Crescentius the Consull and author of the sedition he tooke, put out his eies, cut off his eares, and set him on an Asse with his face towards the taile, to be  derided through the whole citty, and at last slue him. He likewise thrust out the eyes of Pope Iohn, and restored his kinsman Gregory to his former dignity. It was this Gregory that made the Law, which is held inviolable to this day, in this forme. None of the Emperors hereafter shall claime the Empire by in heritance. Let six Princes, whereof three to be of the clergy, and three of the Layty be chosen: If these cannot agree, Let the King of Bohemia be Vmpier. When he had reigned xix. year, he died at Rome, not without suspition of poyson. He maried Mary the daughter of the king of Aragon, and as report went, an intemperat woman. For his quick wit, and singular wisedome, he was called the wonder of the world. About this time the cittie of Soysons by the treason of  Erle Retgnold escheted to the crowne of France.

In the beginning of his raigne, finding all thinges out of order, he wrought his son into the copartnership of the Empire, least in his absence in Italy, his subiects in Germany for want of an head should mutiny. He besiedged Millain along time,  and as he threatned the citty with finall destruction, being terrified with an Oracle, he desisted from his purpose. And so departing from Millain, he cam to Rome, where he was crowned with the crown of gold by Iohn the xii. He fought happily against the Sclauonians and Pannonians, who had ayded him in pacifieng Italy. He builded the church of Spire, with great cost, wherein with Gisclla his Wife, vpon whom he begat Henry the second, he lyeth buried, in the xv. yeare of his raign. In his raign, the Counsell of Triburgi was held at Mogunce, and Burgundy was diuided into a Dukedome and an Earledome, the Dukedome to appertaine to the house of France, the Earledome  to the Empire.

A woman nothing beautifull, but of a stirring spirit, wauering vpon all occasions, and of a stinking breath, Who would not cursse such immoderat affections in a woman of fifty yeares of age? Or nor admire the inconstancy of Fortune in a price of such worth? At last she arrogated to her selfe all imperial iurisdiction, and vsed Michaell as her vassall. But this submissiue slatterie  lasted not long, for Michaell tooke the gouernment into his own hands, and proued no euill Prince. He concluded a three yeares truce with the Egiptian king, and deliuered Edessa from siege. At last, falling sick of an Ague, he nominated Michaell calaphet his successour in the empire, when he had almost reigned 7. yeares.

                     MYchaell calaphet, a man most ignoble, was adopted by Zoe, whose parentes caulked Ships in Paphlagonia, from whence hee tooke his surname. He was a Prince subtill and deceitful, a dissembler euery way,  enuious, wrathfull, and apt to heare tales: he tooke a solemne oath at the feet of Zoe, that he would be onely a titular emperor, but the regiment of the state should remaine in her disposition. Being preferred to the Empire by these slatteries, and once established, he gouerned all things couetously, trecherously, and cruelly. Ingreatefull he was towards all men, first he deposed his vncle, next the remainder of his kindred he slew, afterwards he banished

                     Zoe, pretending that shee went about to poyson him, from thought whereof, she was most innocent. But the people taking her banishment in euill part, called Zoe from banishment, created her Empresse, and reconering Michaell in his flight, put out his eyes, as also his brother Constantius, a familiar kind of punishment amongst the Greeks. He was Lord 4 months and so many dayes.

At Capua he ouerthrewe the Saracens, but being weary of the controuersies of Rome, hee banished all the counterfet pretendants to that see, and elected Sindeger bishop of Bamber sole Pope, afterwards called Clement the eleuenth, by whom in the assembly of the Synod, he was consecrated Emperor Agustus. And to giue future security in the election of Popes, hee inforced the Romaines to take an oth, that euer after they shuld not medle with chusing of Popes. After that he put a new Garrison into Capua, to withstand the attempts of the Saracens. Returning into Germany, he procured his son, but fiue yeares olde, to be nominated  
                     Caesar, & crowned at Aquisgraue. He died the xvii year of his raign: he married Agnes the daughter of William Prince of Aquitan. In his raign arose the heresie of the Manichees in Gostar, who accursed the eating of al sorts of liuing creatures.

And scarce 3. moneths were ouerpast, but she nominated him Emperor.

                     COnstantinus Modo. being graced with the titles of an Emperor, proued asloathfull Prince, and wholy giuen to wantonnes, kept a concubine in place of his wife, a woman of an excellent beauty he bore out 2. most grieuous ciuill warres, the one raised by Maniaces Georgius, the other by Leo Tornicius, besides many forraine. In his time began the armies of the Turkes to prosper in Asia, and he yet ouercam the Roxolani and the Patzinacae a kind of Scithian people. From this Princes cowardize, the ensuing miseries took  their Originall. At last both he and his wife died about one time of the pestilence: he reigned xii. yeares. He was liberall to the poore, and bountifull to churches. He erected an almes house for aged persons, & was trobled with the Gout.

                     THeodora the sister of Zoe without the agreement of the Senate, gouerned the Empire 2. yeares, by the potency of hir fathers Eunuhs, who

confirmed her in despight of one Nicephorus, gouernor of the Bulgarians, whom the Senat had chosen Emperor. Daring her gouernment the peace at home and abroade was so well kept, and the people founde such ease and plenty of all things, that no man repented a womans gouernment. But age comming on, and her disease incresing, by the flatteries of her Euunuches, she elected Michaell a very old man, her partner in the Empire.
               
               
                  Michaell the elder.
                  
                     MYchaell the elder, a man very famous for his birth and wealth, but by reason of his olde age, vnfit for gouernment, after the death of Theodora, 
                      was preferred to the Empire by the same Euunuchs, vpon condition, that in name he shold be Emperor, but in gouernment, themselues. But when he was found to be vnfit for the place, he was deposed by the Patriarch and the senat, & thrust into a monastery, when he hadde ruled scarce one yeare. Being made a priuat man, he liued not long after.
               
               
                  
                     Henry 4.
                  
                     HEnry the 4. (but with Ignatius the third) sonne of the last Henry, was a Prince addicted to all wicked and vngodly course, and by Gregory the seuenth (otherwise called Heldebrand, to whom he was aduersary) declared an enemy of the church, and interdicted. Wher at finding himself agreeued, he leuied an Army, and taking with him Clement, whom he had  created Bishop in Germany, came to Rome, where he ouerthrew the churches of S. Peter and Paule, and besiedged Gregory. His mother Agnes, a woman of excellent Wisedome, he depriued from all gouernment, for that she rebuked him in these his courses. He ouerthrew Rodulph, elected Empe. by the Princes, at the instigation of Gregory. What in him lay, he hindered the iourny of the christian Princes to the Holy lande. At last being taken by his son Henry, whom he had chosen Emperor, and committed to prison at Leyden in the xlviii. yeare of his raigne, hee departed this life, through the loathsome stincke of the prison. Heldebrand sent the imperiall crowne to Rodulph with this inscription: Petra dedit Petro, Petrus diadema Rodulpho, meaning,  that as Christ gaue soueraigne authority to the church, so the church had power to bestow it againe on Princes.

                     HEnry the fifte, the brother of the fourth, receiued the ensignes of the Empire after the death of his Father, whom he persecured with war, and retained the same spleene, especially against the Sea of Rome, in regard whereof, Pope Pascall did what he could to debarre his entrance into the cittie. Which the courage of the young Prince taking in scorne, got the Pope into his power, inforced his coronation, and dealt cruelly with the residue of the Roman clergy. Which when the bishop in the next counsell had  disanuled, as acts procured by force and violence, Henry in great fury returned to the citty, and was againe crowned by the Gouernor Bachar. At his third iourney into Italy, he expulsed Gesalius the second out of the cittie. At his returne into Germanie. he died: leauing no children behind him, in the fifteene yeare of his empire, and was buried at Spire, amongst his predecessors.

                     ISaac Conuenus borne of a Noble house, quick of dispatch, strong, valiant in warre, prouident in peace, resolute, and maiesticall, by the fauor of the Patriarch (towards whom afterwards he proued an ingrate prince and banished himselfe and his kindred) after Michaell gouerned the Empire. Being taken with a paine in his side as he rode on hunting, and disparing of help, he tooke orders, and resigned his Empire. Being accused that hee vsed Michell tyrannously, he answered he did it for the common-weales sake. Hee gouerned the Constantinopolitan Empire two yeares and three months.
               
               
                  Constantine Ducas.
                  
                     COnstantine Ducas was no sooner declared Emperour by the suffrages of  the whole Senat and people, but he discouered a dangerous plot of treason against his person, and hardly escaped it with safety of his life. Hee had three sonnes, and as many daughters by his wife Eudcchia: he was zealous of religion, an obseruer of equity, an indifferent good states-man, but conerous aboue measure, and therefore is beloued of his people, and scotned of his enemies, on al sides vexing him and his dominions. To these former miseries were adioyned homebred calamities, (: Viz:) that lamentable earth-quake which ouerthrew Churches and houses. He died in the sixty yeare of his age, and in the xii. yeare of his raigne: Some say the first.

                     EVdochiea the wife of Constantinus Ducas togither with her sonnes, as yet not fit for gouernment: succeeded her husband, her priuat matters she had beene able to gouerne easily by her owne womannish wisedome, if that the Warres had giuen ouer abroad: but the Barbarians being euery where ready to assaile, and spoile many parts of the Empire, being compelled of the Senat and the people to chuse a most valiant Prince, who should defend the common-wealth with wisdome and fortitude, in preuenting so great dangers, and brideling the forces of her enemies, after shee had gouerned seauen months, by her sons consents, she tooke for her husband a Roman sur-named Diogenes.

                     DYogenes the Roman hauing vndertaken the Empire, when hee had conquered the Turkes, and had freed the common-wealth from feare, being taken of the Senat (because he would seeme to depriue his sonnes in law of their right to the Empire) and his eies being put out, he was banished into an Island wherein hee was buried by his Wife Eudochia, after hee had raigned three yeares and eight months. His father Patricius gouerned the states, and for sedition was banished into Sardinia.

Wherefore the Turkes euery where assailing the gouernors, as it were compelled, chose for their Emperor Nicephorus Botoniates, discending

from the Emperor Nicephorus Phocas, whom the Cittizens of Constantinople easily admitted, by cause of the displeasure they bore their sloathful prince, first hauing thrust Michaell with his wife and sonne into a Monastery, & taken for a Monke: he raigned six years.

                     NYcephorus elected in the place of Michaell, hauing taken Constantine the sonne of Constantine Ducas, who challenged the Empire for his right, he shaued him and annoynted him priest. But not long after being deceiued by Alexius Conuenus who was better beleeued of the Souldiers, he was cast out of the Empire in the third year of his raign, the city being taken by the  Souldiers vpon that day which was Easter daie, and was cast into a Monasterie or couent, wherein some while hee liued. At this time God-frey of Bolein Duke of Loraine tooke his voyage into Iudea against the Saracens, attended by the most famous, & most excellent prince of France, hauing either sold or pauned their goods.

                     ALexius Conuenus the successor of Necephorus, as it were a profest enemy to the Latines, more then for the war that hee vnhappily atchieued with Robert Viscardus, being helpt also by the Venctians, hee fought to hinder that memorable voiage of the French-men, whom hee seemed alwaies to suspect  from the beginning, but his purpose not taking effect, he receiued the French-men vpon condition to furnish them with prouision and other necessaries, if so bee that they would render to him what thinges soeuer they tooke from the enemy, amongst our captaines he seemed to attribute much to Boamundus the Norman. At length hauing betaken himselfe to peace, he built a house for fatherlesse children to be kept in, and a schoole wherein they might be instructed in learning, giuing the expenses out of his owne reuenewes. Hee was exceedinglie giuen to praier, well ordered in his manners, in the end being much troubled with a disease, hee died when he had raigned thirty yeares foure months and a halfe, leauing the Empire to his sonne Iohn, his mother at  the first being against it.

Hee obtained many and famous victories in the East against the Turkes, at the length when he was a hunting, he wounded a finger of his right hand with a dart, by himselfe poisoned which hee cast at a barre, he died the twenty fiue yeare of his raigne, he named Manuell his younger brother Emperor, because Isaac was not yet so fit to gouerne,  a prince not altogether to be misliked.

                     LOtarius the second whom some call Luderus Duke of Saxony, was created Emperor by the electors, there was great difference betweene him and conrade (who after was Emperour) for the Empire, which afterward was appeased by the industrie of S. Barnard. Hee made a voyage against the

                     Bohemians, but the matter being vnaduised done, hee lost many of his men, at length peace being desired betweene them, it was concluded. He went twice into Italy, the first to appease rebellions stirred vp in Rome against Innocent the second (of whom hee was Crowned) for the election of a new Bishop, the next time against Roger who vniustly held Campania and Apulia, him hee draue from Italy. These things being finished, in his iourney hee died of the plague, when hehad raigned eleuen yeares.

Conradus hauing gotten no reputation returned into Germany, not hauing receiued the diadem of the Empire, he died in the fifteenth year of his raigne.

In conclusion, being oppressed by the Wars of the Venetians, hauing promised full restitution of their goodes, hee obtained by request that hee might restore them by annual pensions. Hee fought a most deadly battel with the Turkes, in the which he was almost taken prisoner, at last when he was accounted a most skilfull Astrologer, and had promised himsefe long life, and prosperous raigne, hauing liued amongst a society of Moonks, he died when he had raigned thirty and eight yeares.

Peter. In the end going vnfortunatly to the citty of Mediolanum which was assisted by the  
                     Venetians, he scarce escaped by flight, al priuat grudges being ended, and peace concluded, he intended to make a voyage into Siria, but in sailing thither it is said he was drowned when he had raigned thirty seauen yeares.

a league with the French-men and Venetians (by whose help is said he obtained the Empire) vpon condition that the Patriarch of Constantinople should giue place to the Pope of Rome as his better, & that he should restore the damages the French-men and the Venetians had receiued by Manuel. Who when he went about to performe what he had promised, he was slaine of Murziphilus a base companion, whom he searce a moneth after his restitution, being a very child, had eleu

A little after returning, in a famous assembly of strangers, he confirmed by the Apostolike authority Balwin Emperor with a diadem, who searce a yeare being ended, when hee had vndertaken all things by Adrionopolis, he dying appointed his brother Henry to be his successor.

Amongst his other acts, hee despoiled one William a French-man of the principalities of Achaia and Bythinia: he was enemy to the Venetians, by whom he had beene stripped of his imperiall dignity, had not the Genooise withstood them. In requitall of which good seruice, he gaue them the citty of Para. After that he went to Lions, to be present at the counsell which Gregory the x. had proclaimed: whereby forsaking the rites of the greek church he incurred such hatred of his countreymen, that after his death they would not voutsafe him a place of buriall: hee gouerned the state fortie yeares and vpward.

A false Frederick, who had proclaimed himselfe in Sweuia, he burned at Nouesium. By his Lieutenant he forced the citties of Hetrucia. For hee neuer came into Italy, neither according to the custom of his predecessors was crowned at Rome, reciting a tale in Aesop of the Foxe, who answered the Messenger of the sick Lyon, in  this manner: Commend me to thy Maister, and say, that withall my hart I wish his recouery, and therefore will I make my deuout orisons to the heauenly powers: but for that I see all the foote prints of those beasts which of kindnes haue visited thy loue, to go forwards; but none to returne backwards, I haue apprehended so extreame a feare, that I doubt me, not one of those who haue entred his den, haue euer
                     
                     returned againe. In like manner Rudolph considered, that his auncestors had made many toilesome iournes with most florishing Armyes into Italy, but they euer returned with losse and dishonor. Hauing subiected Austria vnder his obeysans, hee created his sonne Albert Duke thereof, from whom the now Princes of Austria deriue their petigrees. He departed in the 18. yeare of his Empire, in whose time Albertus sur-named Magnus liued.

                  THe first action that Adolphus count of Nassan titularie Emperor vndertooke,  was against the Columbarienses. After that, in his expedition against Albert the sonne of Caesar Duke of Austria, he was deposed by the German Nobility, being weary ofhis Ambitious and sensual life, in whose steede they preferred Albert. But when Adolph would not surrender, they fought it out neere Wormes, in which conflict Adolph perished, in the eight yeare of his raign.

But afterwards by the help of the Venetians, the elder Andronicus was restored to the Empire. Wherupon arose cruell differents betweene the Genooise and the Venetians. But the elder being dead after he had raigned eighteene yeares, the younger Andronicus gouerned solye, and performed many worthy seruices against the enemies of the Roman name. In the sixty and one yeare of his age he died, of an Ague and a paine in his head in the space of foure daies, about the 16. yeare of his  raigne. He left behind him two sonnes, Calo-ioannes and Manuell, whom hee intrusted to the tutorship of Iohn Catacunzenus.

But Phillip hauing giuen his daughter in  marriage to the sonne of Albert Caesar, was the cause that Albert sur-ceased his determinations. At last he was slain by Iohn his brothers sonne neer the Rhene, when he had raigned ten yeares.

that he would not subiect himselfe to the Empire. Clement the first ratified his inauguration, vpon condition, that hee should discend into Italy, which was then all in combustion: wherefore taking his iourney towards Italy by the woods of Taurinus, he tooke Lumbardy. He suppressed the factions of Turriana, & was Crowned with the Iron crown at Millain. Thence going to Rome, and after his Crotonation being expulsed by the Vrsins, and had pressed the Florentines to vtter despaire, he was poysoned by a preaching Moonke as he receiued the Sacrament.

Whereat three successiue Bishops, Iohn, Benedict, and Clement, being highly offended, excommunicated him; but hee setting light by these Buls and Church-censures, desended into Italy, and was crowned at Millain with the iron crowne, and at Rome with that of Gold, by one Stephan. He created Peter Corlarius a Minorite, Pope, and called him Nicholas. He changed the gouernors of the citty, and in dispight of the Bishop, created many pety Kings in Gallia Gisalpina: hee died in the 33. yeare of his  raigne.

He died in the 32. yeare of his raign, his sonne Venceslaus being first declared Caesar.

This man created Galeaze first Duke of Millain, who had conquered a great part of Italy, & which inheritance discended to his Nephewes euen vntill our times. Hee was cast into prison by his brother, and died in the two and twenty yeare of his raigne.

Afterward the Basilians who vtterly shooke off their subiection to the Empire, whose example drew many of the neighbor people to do the like, whereby a great part of the Romaine maiesty was abated. He did not take the crowne after the manner of his predecessors, nor euer saluted the Bishop of Rome or the Apostles Monuments. He was the father of Phillip Arch-duke of Austria by his wife Mary, who was made the sonne in law to the King of Spaine and his succession: his daughter Margaret first contracted with Charles the eight, King of France, and then refused was married to Phillibert Duke of Sauoye. He married with the daughter of viscount Galeacius, after the death of his first wife, and at length  died in Austria in the nine and fifty year of his age, and the three and thirtieth yeare of his Empire.

                     CHarles the fist was sonne to Phillip Arch-duke of Austria, and Nephew to Maximilian, he was K. of Spaine, and being Prince of Austria he was declared

Emp. at Francfort, by the princes electours in the yeare of our saluation one thousand fiue hundred ninteene, and was crownd at Bononia by Clement the seuenth, although he first denied his confirmation, except he would resigne into his hands the kingdome of Naples, because he affirmed that the kings of Naples were bound vnto the Pope to renounce the Empire whiles they should be kings of Naples. In his time was Rhodes taken by the Turkes after seuen months siege, to the dishonour of all Christendome: afterwarde Frauncis the French king was taken prisoner at Pauy in Italy, by the Empe. Lieutenant, and so sent into Spaine. After the Emperor had bin in England, and made league with king Henry the eight at Windfor, and the French K.  remained prisoner in Spaine, till a peace was concluded betwixt the Empe. and him, vpon condition, to set themselues aboue all against the Turke, and the Lutherans. About which time the Emperor married with the daughter or Emanuell king of Portugall, and shortly after the Duke of Bourbon hauing bin formerly called into Italy (to assaile Naples) by the Empe. he besieged and tooke Rome; and in the sacking thereof, his souldiors obseruing no honesty, or decorum, as commonly it falleth out in such exploits, he was slaine with a bullet, and afterward Clement the Pope was besieged in the castle of saint Angelo, vntill he was deliuered by the ransome of 40000. Dacates. But the King of France sent into Italy his forces to relieue the Pope. The king of England 
                      demanded of the Emperor interest for fiue hundred thousand skutes which he had borrowed of the king, & by agreement was to pay him 133000. Skutes by the yeare, which if it were not presently payed, he denounced war, because the Emperour had broken the accordes betwixt them, made in the yeare 1522. when he was in England. The king of France demaunded of the Em. his two children whom he had left for hostages with the Emp. offering siluer for them, and so they were deliuered for twentye hundred thousande Skutes: out of which money was the k. of Englands debt to be discharged, & so apeace was concluded betwixt the Emperor, and the french king at Cambray, by the mediation of Margaret the Emperors Ant, & Loyse the French kings mother. 
                  
                  The Florentines hauing banished out of their citty the family of Medices, were besieged by the Emperor and the Pope, and driuen to a composition to receiue Alexander de Medices for their Prince, vnto whom was promised in marriage, the Emperors bastard daughter. Ferdinand the Emperors yonger brother, was declared king of the Ro. at Collen, & shortly after crowned at Aix, and the Turke comming the second time against Vienna, was forced by the Emperor and Ferdinand to retire, and afterward when he came with agreat Army and besieged the towne and castle of Ginute neere Belgrade, he was made by Nicholas Inrixe then in the town to leaue the siege, when as  Margaret the Emperors aunt, had receiued the gouerment of the low countries by the Emp. she not long enioyed that honor, but died, and Mary Q. of hungary the Em. sister was placed in that honor. The Emperour went into Affricke, and there tooke the tovvne of Tunis, and the Forte of Golete, and made the king Muleasse tributary: vvhere Barbarosse the Turkes lieutenaunt, escaped vnto Argile. Aftervvard the Emperor retired into Sicily, and then

with a great power into Prounce, where hee was so sore distressed for victuall, that hee was forced to retire into Genes, and from thence by sea into Spaine, leauing the Count Nassau to besiege Peronny, and afterward Terouanne, but could not take it, and then a peace was concluded betwixt the Emperor and the French king at Nice for ten yeares, and afterward Castelubro, atowne of Illyria was taken from the Turkes by the Emperor and the Venetians; and Castelnoue was taken by the Turke Barbarosse from the Emperor, and all the Spanish garrison slaine. Wherupon the Emperor and the French king, sollicitted the Venetians to ioyn with them in warre against the Turks, who were not moued by that Ambassage, but sent to make peace with the  Turke. Ferdinand king of Romains, besieging Bude in Hungary, was repelled by the Turks, and a great company of his Souldiors slaine. The Queene was forced to yeelde the Towne vnto him, and shee with her little sonne called Stephen, were banished into Transiluania. The Emperor to hinder the Turke, and to draw him out of Hungaria, made faile to Argiere, but throgh agreat tempest he lost almost all his artillery and furniture of Warre, and so was forced to retire back again into Spaine: vpon which occasion, the French were mooued to take war against him, and in the moneth of Iuly following they pilled all Brabant.
                  
                  Then the Emperor crowned his son Phillip k. of Spain, and married him to the daughter of Iohn king of Portugal, and afterward the Emperor and the  King of England, made warre vpon the French king, and the Duke of Cleue was drawne from his aliance with Fraunce by the Emperor. But the Empe. forces were discomfited at Carignan in Pieniont, by the Prince of Auguien. The Emp. tooke Luxembrrough, Ligin and S. Dedier, and the king of England took Bullen. When as the Duke of Saxony, was taken prisoner by the Empe. and condemned to death, yet spared at the request of the elector of Brandebourge, vpon condition that he shoulde subiect himselfe to the Pope, touching religion: hee rather chose to die, then to yeelde to that extremity. Whereat the Emperor marueiled, and remitted him that Article, yet was he deposed from his Dukedome. Finally in this Emperors raign, was there  great persecution in all places for Religion vnder the names of Lutherans, Zwinglians, Oceolampadians, caluinists, and other. Ther sprung vp in his time many damnable hereticks to disgrace the Gospell, either by opposition, or perdition. But of the most damnable Sects that euer arose wer two, Anabaptists denying all good policy in the world, trusting vnto illuminated reuelations; and the Iesuits instistuted by Paul the fourth, first called Peter Carapha, (a notable Hipocrite) who in a book of his own writing before he was Pope, taxed the church of Rome vnto Paule the third, for all the abuses, or the most part of them condemned by the Protestants. These Iesuites haue taught the Roman catholicks equiuocation, to dissemble with Magistrates, that are not of  their religion vpon their oathes in examination, and are the common platformers for the Romish Church to poison all the common-wealths of Christendome. This Em. resigned his imperiall crown into the handes the Electors by Ambas. for the behalfe of his brother Ferdinande, and after he had raigned 37. yeares hee died, at a monastery in Spaine, of the order of Ieronius, in the yeare of saluation. 1558.

                     FErdinandus brother of Charles, was consecrate Emper. in the towne of Francfort, by the Princes electors. In whose time the warres betwixt the late Em. discended by hereditary enuy, to Phillip king of Spain, & the Frenchking, were composed by reason of a mariage betwixt the said king of Spaine, and the French kings daughter. In his time were raised great wars in Germany, France, Flaunders, Artois, Lorraine, and in Italy, by the instigation of Pope Iulius the third. Then began the Spanish inquisition to be directed against christians, which was first of all set vp against Iewes which kepte the  Ceremonies of the Law, after they were baptized. Henry the French king was slaine by the slifter of a speare broke vpon him, in Iusting or at Turney, by the Count Montgommery. The Tyusuffeldians renewed the heresie of Eutiches, confounding the two natures of Christ. The counsell of Trent which continued at sundry Sessions eighteene yeares, after it had established the Roman religion, in whole was dissolued. Sundry bloody battailes wer sought by sea and land betwixt the Danes and the Suedes. The Turkes assailed Malta, and were repulsed. Afterward Hungaria, where the Germans resisted them valiantly. In this time florished Melancthon, Musculus, Hiperius, caluin, Peter 
                      
                     Matir, and Conradus Gesnerus, men of singular learning and piety, zeale and good life, for the good edification of christs church, whose works and books shall neuer cease to commend all religion to posterity. This Emperour was a peaceable Prince, and not turbulent, and died in the sixty one yeare of his age, and seauenth yeare of his raigne at Vienna in Austrich, leauing his sonne Maximilian to succeed him.

                     MAximilianus son of Ferdinand, king of Romans and Bohemia, was chosen Emperor-In his time Soliman the great Turke troubled Hungaria,  and tooke diuers townes thereof, and afterward died, leauing the succession to his son Zelim. The Emperor mooued warre against Iohn Frederick Duke of Saxony, and tooke him prisoner vppon the same day twentye yeares, after that his father was taken prisoner by Charles the fift. The duke of Alua, came into the low countries, and afterward there grew very hotte warres because of the inquisition. The people wore a piece of money about their necke, hauing on the one side the kings image, and on the other a beggers dish, with this inscription: Faithfull to the king, euen to the beggars dish. The second ciuill wars in France began, wherein the Constable was slayne. The king of Spaine imprisoned charles his onely son, whereof the Fle

                      complained to the Emperor, suggesting that it was done by the instigation of the inquisitors, because hee misliked the Duke of Alua his cruelty in the low countryes, and this Prince dyed in prison. There were seene in the heauens three Moons, one in equal distance from another. This Emperor permitted the Lords and Gentlemen of Austrich to haue free libertye to exercise

their reformed religion, after the doctrine in the confession of Ausburg, intheir castles, townes, and houses. The Turke tooke a part of Ciprus from the Venetians, as Nicosia and Famagota, yet they lost a famous battaile at Lepanto by the christians confederate. It rained Wheat, Turnup-rootes, and pease in Slesia, which much comforted the poore people, in the extreamity of famine. In this time was the massacre in France, Charles the ninth being king, who afterwarde dyed bleeding, wherein was slaine for religion, aboue threescore thousand. This Maximilian was a good Prince, and endeuored al his power against the Turke. Finally hauing made his sonne Rodolph king of Romaines,

                     ROdolph the second, eldest son of Maximilian, was sacred Emperour in the yeare 1577. Assoone as he was crowned, he made peace with the Turke, whereunto the Turke easily yeelded because of his Warres in Persia. A great battaile was fought in Affricke by Sebastian, before whych battell, was the greatest Comet that hath bin seene in this latter part of the world, which the Portugall Captains interpreted to be a good signe to that warre, telling the souldiors, that the Comet spake to the King Accometa, that is in the Portugall tongue. Let him assaile them, which fell out otherwise, for  in that battell three kings died, whereof it was saide, Sebastian was one, leauing his kingdome of Portugall to Henry a Cardinall, who dying, nominated thereunto Phillip king of Spaine. Pope Gregory made a calender in An. 1583. which is called the Gregorian, cutting off ten dayes in the month of October, to bring the yeare againe as it was in the time of our Sauiour Christ (as they sondly imagine) for the imagined, that since that time, by iust computation of minutes, ten dayes are increased. This Emperour is nowe liuing, hauing seene the death of fiue Popes, one Queene of Englande, the firste borne of all the kinges of the earth, and rarest in perfection; one king of Spaine; one of France, diuers Princes of Germany: threegreat Turks: Zelim, Amarath, and
