                     IEsus walkinge by the See syde of Galilee, saw two brethren Simon named Peter and Andrewe his brother, castinge a nette into the See (for they were fyshers) & saith vnto them. folow me, and I shal make you fishers of men. And they forthwyth left theire nettes, and folowed him. And when he was gone forth frō thens, he saw other two brethren, Iames the sōue of Zebedee and Ihon his brother in the shyppe wyth Zebedee their father, mendinge their nettes, & he called them. And they forthwith left the shyppe and their father, and folowed him.
               
            
            The sermon vpon this Gospel.
            
               THe Gospell of this daye (deare frendes) declareth that our sauiour Christ whan he was here conuersant amōges vs for our redemption sake, before he wold do or speake any notable thing (as the holyChrysostom. doctour Chrysostom sayth) called & chase vnto him, his Apostles, to thintent nothing might be hid from them of Chrystes wordes and dedes, but that they might afterward boldely affirme & say. We can not but speake the thinges whych we haue sene & hard.

As Christ therfor walked by the see side, he saw two brethren germanes, the name of the one was Simō whiche also was called Peter, the name of the other was Andrew, whose memorie we do this day solemnize. But what were these two, whom our Sauiour Christe chase to be his apostles? Were they greate worldly Clerkes, were they philosophers, were they pharisees or scribes, were they great rich persones, or men of high power and authoritie? no verily, they were none of al these, they were but pore & vnlerned fishermen. And why did he chose these? Uerily (saith saynt Austine) if Christ had chosen great lerned mē
               S. Austine. or men of estimatiō, they might peraduenture haue sayd that they had deserued to be chosen bycause of their lerning or wisdom. But our lord Iesus Christ going about to breake the neckꝭ of the prowd, 
                  •
               hase men of no lerning ne reputation, which he dyd alsoErasmꝰ in paraphrasi. for this purpose, that the glorie of the gospel might not be diminished nor shadowed with worldely succours and helpes. So here Christe doth manifestly declare vnto vs in what kinde of people he most delyteth, euen in the humble and contempte persones of the world and in such as be simple and as it were babes in worldly wisdom, as in an other place he al so testifieth, sayng. I confesse and giue thankes vnto the o father, lord of heuen & of erth, bicause thouMat. xi. hast hyd these thinges from the wise & prudent persones, and haste diselo

               d ye shal marke, that Christ calleth babes here thē which laying a syde al worldly wisdom, receiue gods word without al deliberatiō, and which preferre not their owne iugemēt afore gods word but submitte themselues

vnto it in all thinges. He called therfore two simple fyshers, and when did he calle them? Uerely euen when they were in the myddes of theyr worke,Chrysostom. meaning herby (as Chrysostom saith) that we ought to preferre the folowyng of Christ afore al other occupations in the world. For they were casting their nettes into the See, and this fishing was a shadow of the newe fishynge, whereby they shulde not take wyth material nettes fishes for the fode of the bely, but wherby they shulde with the nette of godꝭ word catche men (whiche be browned wyth earthly cares) vnto the desyre of the heuenly life. Wherfore where as they were busyed and toyling about their bodyly lyuing (which neuertheles was then their vocation or callinge according to gods commaundementGen. ii

And verely his word of callynge had in it a wonderfull vertue, for it so wrought in theire hartes, that they forthwyth lefte altogither, & folowed him. A
                  •
               d here we haue a nota ble exemple of obediēce in these apostles for vs to fo lowe. Chryste had not so sone called them, but anou they folowed. For he that loueth father, or mother, wife or children more then he loueth the SauioureMat. 
                     ••
                  
                Iesu Christ, is no mete mā for Christ, that is to say, he maye wel cal himselfe a Christen man, but Christ wol surely refuse hym for one of his men and disciples when the terrible daye of Dome shall comme, what tyme he shall descende in Maiestie to iudge both the lyuynge and the deade.
            
               Christe thā called these two brethern Peter and Andrew and also the other two Ihō & Iames, to what purpose? to folow him only by the heles whether so euer he shulde goe ydelly? No truly. But to teache & instructe thē in such wyse as they might in tyme cō
               myng be made hys apostles, hys legates, hys Oratours, hys preachers. He chase them beyng yonge, rude, simple, vnlerned, & nothing but playne fishermen, and therfore they were the more apte and mete to receiue his heauenly, swete, and pure doctrine, bycause they were not as yet infected with the sower le uē of the pharisees. But ere they departed frō hym, he replenished them wyth such wonderfull wysdom and wyth such diuine doctrine, that they were hable to cōfoūde the great and witty clerkes of the world. Of fishe catchers and bodily fyshers he made them men fyshers and catchers of sowles. So God longIere. 16. before promysed by hys prophete Hieremye, saynge I wyll sende you fyshers and they shall fyshe you. Such a worthy fysher of men sowles was thys noble Apostle saint Andrew. He spared for no persecution of tyrantes to execute and fulfyll hys maysters commission whiche was to preache the Gospell and glad tydynges of mans redemption by Christe. He preached it purely and syncerely euen accordinge to hys commission. Yea for the feithfull executynge and witnessing herof he shranke not to suffre a very cruel death. Let vs therfore folow him in feith that we maye also folowe hym to euerlastynge blesse by Christ oure Lorde, who be praysed worlde wythout ende.

            The sermon vpon this Gospel.
            IN this gospel (good people) many thinges are to be considered. First, how that our sauiour Christ the sonne of god wold for the greate loue he bare to

mankinde be borne the sōne of Dauid, that is, wold take mās nature vpon hym to succour and help vsThe cause of Christes incarnation. which were in flesh condēned & to pourge our spotted and synful byrth. And verily this is the final intent of Christꝭ incarnatiō, as it is wel declared in the epistle to the Hebrues, where it is writen, that forasmochHebr. 2. as the sonne of god vouchsaued to call godly persones his brethren, sayng by the prophet Dauid I will declare thy name to my brethren, and otherwhilespsal. 2
                     •
                  . also he calleth them the children, as in Esay. Lo here am I & the children, whom god hath giuenEsai. 8. me: and bicause these children and these his brethrē be men made of fleshe and bloude: it pleased hym to be parttaker of the same wyth thē, that by his death he might wipe out him whiche had lordshippe ouer death that is to say the deuyl, and deliuer thē which through feare of death were al their life time subdued vnto bondage. For he toke not vpon him angels but the sede of Abraham. Wherfore in al thinges it becam hym to be made like to hys brethren, that he might be merciful & a feithful high prest in thinges towchinge God to thintent to pourge the synnes of the people. Now wheras Christ is called here the sōne of Dauid: ye must vnderstand it that he descē
               deth lineally from Dauid according to the flesh, as saint Paul declareth in the beginning of his epistleRom. i. to the Romaines, lest we rūne into y• errours of certaine heretikꝭ which say that Christe was nothynge elles but a mā & not the son of God, but merely the sōne of Dauid. Which errour Christ himself discussed,Mat. 22. where he propowned this question to the pharisees. What thynke ye of Christe, whose sonne is he▪
               
And when they answered, the sōne of Dauid, he asked them, why thā did Dauid in spirite cal him lordpsal. no. sayng, the lord said to my lord, syt on my right hāde Meaning hereby, that Christe was aboue Dauid & not only a man but also god. So that ye muste vnderstand him to be the sōne or issue of Dauid according to the flesh, and not accordinge to his godhed. And ye shal also marke, that he is called the sōne of Dauid after the maner of speaking of the Hebrues, bycause he cam of the ryght line of Dauyd. For theTwo lig nagies in scripture. Hebrues do calle al lineal nephues & nieces (be they neuer so long of) sonnes and daughters. Uerely the hole petigrue of Christe, is here so drawen and conueyed from his auncestours, that they only be put which were ꝑttakers of y• promise which was made of Christ. Ye must therfore marke two maner lines of men, whiche beinge well marked doth discerne of whom Christ wold be borne and was borne. For albeit the promise of Chryste was made to Adam: yet from Cain his sōne the petigrue of Christ is not cō
               ueyed. So that one line there is whyche deriueth Christꝭ petigree from the mēbres of the true church, that is to wite, frō the holy fathers which were parttakers of ye ꝓmise. And an other line there is which cōteyneth the childrē that grew out of kinde not folowing their fathers steppes & therfor no ꝑttakers of the ꝓmise, which two lines if ye diligently marke through out the old testament ye shal se that Christ proceded of the feithful stocke, & not of that whiche grew out of kinde, as Cain Esau and their ofspring were. And verily it becam Christ the hed of ye church to come of the membres of the true churche.
            
               Seconde, ye shall vnderstande that oure Sauiour Christ wolde be borne accordinge to the fleshe of the royal bloude of kinges, to declare that he shuld be a kynge, no worldly kynge, but a spirituall kynge for the rulyng and guyding of mens consciencies. And forasmuch as kinges were also annointed after the maner of prestes: therfore Christ also wold be borne of kinges to shew himselfe an annoynted king, that is to say, both a king and a prest, a king to rule and defende, a prest to make intercession and prayer for vs accordyng as saynt Paule sayth of him. WhichRom 8. also maketh intercessiō for vs. And the prophet 
                  •
               ieremie sayth. He shall do the office of a kinge and capitayne.Hiere. 11 But for the eschuing of errours, ye muste know, that Dauid whose sonne Christ is according to the fleshe, administred here hys kyngdome in the erth: and therfore it is not to be thought that after that Christ is nowe ascended vp to heuen, he exerciseth nomore hys kyngly officies but that he sytteth ydelly in heuen leauyng behind him, hys deputie or vicare in erth the bishop of Rome. Uerily Christes kingdom is perpetuall, and so is his presthode, according to the sayng of the prophet. Tu es sacerdo
                     •
                  
                  Psal. 109 inaeternum secūdum ordinem Melchisedec. Thou art an euerlastinge prest, accordynge to the order of Melchisedec. Thirdly, ye shall vnderstande that albeit Christe and also our Ladye hys mother (whose memory we solemnize this day) & Ioseph her husband, cam of the right & blessed line or stocke, and not of the croked & cursed lyne, as I haue aforedeclared: yet many of the persons aswel men as wom
                  •
                of this blessed stocke were synners and therfore here

in their genealogie is mencion made also of synfull personnes. For who were so wicked as kynge Manasses and his sonne Amon, whiche be here rekened in Christes petigree. Iudas also cōmitted fornication with Thamar. Salmon maryed Raab an harlot. What shall I speake of Bethsabea, wyth whom king Dauid cōmitted greuouse aduowtrie. And yet of this Bethsabea whiche was the wyfe of Urie dyd king Dauid begette Salomō. So that if a mā wol throughly consider the thinge, he shall fynde almost more euell men then good amōges the auncestours of Christ, and all the women whiche be here named be none of the holy women, as saynt Hierom sayth,S. Hierom. but suche as the scripture disproueth. What other thinge meaneth thys, but that the holy ghost wolde signifie, that like as Christ cam of synners: so he also cam into this world for sinners. He wold be borneHierom (sayeth thys noble clerc saynt Hierom) of synners, yt he myght wipe awey the synnes of all. Yea ChristMat. 
                     •
                  . hymselfe sayeth, that he cam not to calle the rightuouse, but synners to repentaūce. If then he cam for synners, why shuldest thou o mā despaire for cause of thy synnes? Nay rather take harte vnto the and repent. For then shal the grace and fauour of Christ be powred more plētifully vpō the, in that thou hast the more offended according to the sentence of saint Paule. Furthermore we may lerne also hereExēple of modestic. a moderatiō of mynd and demurenes, that we hitte noman in the teeth of his auncestours or kynsfolke. For yf our Sauiour Christ had amonges his auncestours very tyrantes, harlottes & wicked ꝑsonnes, who is he that hath not amonges hys auncestours

and kinsfolke both good and badde? Fourthly, ye shall marke that saynt Mattheu here doth calle Ioseph the husband of Marie, so that it is certaine, that betwene Ioseph and Marye was a iust & lawfull matrimonie, vnder which, not without a singuler cause, Christ wold be borne, to shewe that matrimonie is the state whiche pleaseth God, and on the other side, to liue in aduowtrye and fornication is a kynoe of life abominable afore God and man. Of a virgine verily Christ wolde be borne, but yet vnder lawfull wedlocke. A virgine to hys mother becam hym that was God, but in that she was maryed, is setforth vnto vs the cōmendation of wedlocke. Uirginitie I say becam her which by secrete inspiratiō of the holy ghost being herselfe pure and vndefiled, conceiued and brought forth him which was moost pure & cleane, but yet Ioseph was oure blessed Ladies husbande. Doth not thys thynge then setforth vnto vs the honour of matrimonie, and condemne these wicked heretiques which say that matrimonie
                  
                     •
                  . Tim. 4 is a thynge fylthy & vnpure, of whom saynt Paule speaketh, callynge them spirites of errours, and deuelish teachers. For if Christ had wolde, he myght haue been borne before Marye his mother was betrowthed to Ioseph. If matrimonie also were a fowle thing and discōmended of god, as some heretikes haue said, why went our Sauiour Christ to a wedding & wrought there the first miracle that euer he did, by turnyng water into wyne? So ye thoughe
                  
                     •••
                  . 
                     •
                  . virginitie be a highe thyng & mete for such as be of high ꝑfection: yet matrimonie is an honest state. Last of all thys Gospell doth condemne those heretikes

which denye yt Christ toke fleshe of the blessed virgine & say either that he brought a spiritual flesh with him from heuen, or that the word so was made fleshe, that Christ is only of one nature & not of two natures. For thys heresie hathe been longe sithens condemned of Christes churche. And euen with one text in this gospel it is ouerthrowne where it is said, that Iacob begatte Ioseph the husband of Marie, of whom was borne Iesus, whiche is called Christ. If of Marye Christe was borne: then it must nedes folow that he toke flesh of her. The Gospel of LukeLuc. 
                     •
                  . also proueth the same, where the angel sayth to Ma rye. Thou shalt conceiue in thy wombe, and beare a childe.. And Elizabeth saith to our Lady. Blessed is the frute of thy wombe. But howe can she conceyueLuc.

                  . Christ or howe can Christe be called the frute of her wombe, yf he toke no parte of her? Finally Paule isRom. 
                     •
                  . playne in this mater which sayeth that Christe was borne of the sede of Dauid concernynge the fleshe. What cā be spokē more plainly? So ye se according also to the flesh the great nobilitie of Christes bloud For he wold be not only according to the spirite but also according to the flesh the noblest of al mē. AccorThe nobilitie of Christ both spiritually and carnally ding to the spirite he descēded frō god hys father wt out begynning, so that he is the eternal sonne of the eternal god. What is higher thā this nobilitie? And as to the fleshe he is descended of most holy patriarches, moost myghty Kinges, and Dukes. In al the worlde was neuer founde lignage, kynred, ne house of more nobilitie then this lignage was wherof our Sauiour Christ descended accordinge to the fleshe. But his spirituall lignage is without cōparison.
            
               This haue I therfor set out, that Christē men shuldThe nobilitie of christen mē. knowe their owne nobilitie. For they that beleue in Christe, be made by feith the brethren & ioyntheires with Christe, accordinge to the text before rehersed, where Christ sayth. I wil shew thy name to my brethren.psal. 23. And in an other place he sayth. These be my brethren which heare the word of god & do it. Saint Paul also sayth. The spirite witnesseth togither we our spirite that we be the sonnes of god, if sonnes, ergo heires, heires of God, and felawe heires wyth Christ. Nowe also with Christ we be made by feyth one bodye, that we maye be his membres. What is lefte then, but that also we be made parttakers of Christes nobilitie? And therfor we be called Christianswhy we be called chri stians. which by interpretation signifie kingly, that is to say, of a kinges house and nobilitie by Christ our king. But wherfore is this so greate nobilitie to be taken of vs? for vayn glorye & to despice our neighbour? No truely. For as Christe the nobler he was both in spirite and also in flesh, the hūbler and 
                  •
               owlyer he made himselfe: So let vs also folow Christꝭ exemple, and the more noble we be made by Christ, so moch let vs beare our selfes y• more lowly. Nowbeit otherwhiles it is not only lawfull but also necessarie, to loke alofte and beare our selfes hyghe of our nobilitie, not against men, but agaynst Satan. For it is a great villany and shame for a noble personage, to subiect himself to vile seruices. For what be more vile or fylthy occupations, then the workes of the deuyl, which be synnes. Here then let vs loke on high in Christ, and be ashamed for our nobilitie sake, to hūble our selfes to the fylth of synnes. Now

ye haue the lignage of Christ according to the fleshe and the nobilitie of him and of al Christians. It remayneth therfore, yt we also shulde knowlege Christ by feith and garnishe our nobilitie wyth good workes by Iesus Christ our lorde, which togither wyth the father & holy ghost be praised foreuer.
            Amen.

            The sermon vpon this Gospell.
            THis Gospell (deare frendes) declareth vnto vs the historie of saynt Thomas, howe he wolde not beleue Christes resurrection til he had seen him, and felt him with his hādes. For as the historie telleth, Christe had appeared to the rest of hys felawesLuc. 24. Iohn. 20 when he was awey, and when they shewed him of it

with one hole voice and consent: yet he said he wold not beleue it, tyl he had sene the prynte of the nayles in Christes handes, and felte his woundes. UerelyS. Gregorie. (as saint Gregory saith) this was not done by casualtie, ye saynt Thomas the chosen disciple of Christ, was not then present. For the high clemencie of god wrought this thinge, ye the doubtyng disciple whyle in his maister he gropeth the woundes of the fleshe,☞ might heale in vs the woūdes of infidelitie. For the infidelitie of saynte Thomas profyted more to the Christen feith, then did the feith of the beleuing disciples. For while he by gropyng, is brought againe to the feith: our mynde is (all doubt set apart) stablished in the feith. Thre thynges then are here to be considered in thys historie. First the hardnes of belefe in saynt Thomas, whiche albeit he was one of the electe disciples of Christe and longe conuersant wyth hym, and continually instructed of his risyng againe, yet he doubteth. Seconde, the goodnes and tendre mercie of Christ, which wolde not thus leaue him. Thyrdly, the constancie of thys blessed Apostle in the feith ouer after euen til his lifes ende. It was doubtles a very grosse infidelitie and hardnes of be leue in saint Thomas, that after so longe cōpaning with our Sauiour Christ and hearynge him oftentimes afore his passion say he shuld rise agayne yet he wolde not beleue his resurrection, n
                  •
                not whē his felawes so cōstantly had shewed hym how they saw him wyth their eyen & what he said vnto them. Hys felawes verily were grosse til they had receyued the holy ghost, for they wold skant beleue his resurrectionChryso stom. til they had seen him. But saynt Thomas was

grosser thā they all. For he said he wold not beleue y• resurrectiō, tyl he had seen the prynt of the nayles in Christes hādes, & yet this was not ynough to make☜ him beleue, but he wolde also fele hys woūdes with his owne handes. And here we haue a lyuely image of the nature & disposition of the fleshe. For the flesh can not be brought to beleue but by sensible signes & tokens. Neither was thys carnalitie in Thomas only, but it is in al mē, for we be made of one mowldRom. 3. and god hath cōcluded all mē vnder infidelitie that he might haue mercie of all. Consider therfore theChryso stom. tender mercie of our lorde, howe for one of his disciples sake he shewed himselfe hauing woundes, & he dyd it not forthwyth, but after. viii. daies, to the intent he being amōges his felawes & certified of thē, might be kyndled vnto a greater desire, and that he might be made the more feithfull in tyme cōmyng. Our Sauiour Christe therfore eight daies after he had appeared to his felawes, cā where as they were gathered togither, & Thomas with them. He entred in vnto them, the dores being shutte, & wyth hys accustomed salutation greteth them, sayng. Peace be amonges you. And forthwyth turnyng hymselfe to Thomas, whose infidelitie could not be hidde from him, whiche bicause he ꝑceiued proceded not of malice but of weaknes: he vouch saued to heale. He had him behold his hādes, and grope his side. Thomas according as Christ had bidde him, beheld the print of the nailes, and thurst his hand into his side. And forthwyth wyth an exclamation cryed, my lorde my God. Thus from a grosse and stubburne infidelitie was he brought to a fast and constant feith.
            
               So Paule at the beginning was a very fierce persecutourAct. 9. of y• church, but afterward he becā a right feithful Apostle and teacher of the people. For these wonderful iugementes of god be for this cause described forth vnto vs, that we shuld lerne to knowe the exceding goodnes of god which turneth euil into good. My lord and my god sayth saint Thomas Uerily he yt confesseth god to be his god, hath renoū ced al ye be his, & possessed those ye be gods. The erthpsal. 23. is the lordꝭ, & al that is therin. We be the lordes & the lord is ours. Wherfor al the goodes of god be ours through feyth in oure sauioure Iesu Christe. This high confession of saint Thomas truly our sauiour commended, but yet he sūwhat towched him for his hardnes of beleue saing. Thomas bicause thou hast seen me thou hast beleued, blessed are they y• haue not seen and yet haue beleued. Saint Thomas saw one thing & beleued an other, he saw mā & confessed god He saw Christ in flesh, he felt him after his resurrection, which was a great furtherāce to his feith. But blessed be they yt neuer saw Christ in flesh, & yet haue beleued on him. Certainly this kynd of people be we Gentils as many of vs as reteyne Christ in mynde whō we haue not seen in flesh, as writeth saint Gregorie, if so be yet that we folow & prosecute our feithGregorie. with good workes. For that ꝑsone doth truly & vnfeynedly beleue which practizeth in working ye thing that he beleueth. Such a true & ernest beleuer was this blessed man saynt Thomas. Let vs then take exemple of him, that we may haue the rewarde that he hath, euerlastinge ioy, by Christe oure lorde, who be praysed for euer.

            A sermon vpon this Gospell.
            WHen the purification daye was comme (good people) that is to wite the. xlij. daye from the birth of our sauiour Christ, at which day ye old law of Moses cōmaunded, y• if it were a man chyld that was born, it shuld be presented to the lorde, & for the purifieng of the childwife and also of the childe sū
               what

shuld be offered: the most pure virgine Mary wold fulfylle the lawe also in this poynt though in her child byrth she knew was nothing after the maner of other womens byrthes contaminate or spotted, but al was ful of heuenly puritie and holynes. For what spotte of vnclennes could she haue which by the worke of the holy ghoste conceyued wythout mans knowlege only by imbracement of the heuenly power? She goeth therfore with Ioseph, who as yet was thought to haue bene father to Iesus, vnto Hierusalem, bearing the childe with them that they might present him in y• temple in the sightA figure of the olde lawe. of the lord to whom he was consecrate, not but that al be the lordes, but that we shuld be taught by this mystical figure, that those mindes be most acceptable to God, whiche with a manly strength of spirite haue conquered the lustes of ye fleshe & so do auaūce to thinges heuenly and euerlasting. Moses law intendingOmne masculi num. this, had commaunded the Iues that euery male so sone as by the openinge of the mothers wombe it was brought to lyght, shulde be taken as holy to the lord, whether it were of mankynde or of brute beastes, that herby also the first frutes might go to the prestes, so yet that the first begotten of the mankinde shuld be redemed out of the prestes handes, onles the childe were of y• Leuitical tribe. Now surely the selfe law openly deliuereth our Lady frō the bonde of it, where it sayth in the leuiticall boke:Mulier si suscep to semine pepe 
                     •
                  erit ma sculū. The wife whiche receiuing sede shal bringe forth a māchild. For the blessed virgine our Lady was neither mulier, that is to say such woman as haue lyen with man, neither receiued she mans sede. And as towching the opening of ye matrice, surely this heauenly

child did in no maner violate the chastitie of of ye virgins wombe but rather preserued & halowed it from al spot of vnclennes during her life. He then was presented in y• temple as subiect to y• law, which was lord of al thingꝭ both heuenly & erthly. He was redemed with a smal price, which cam to redeme the hole world wt the price of his bloude. For ye law had appointed ye Iues to redeme their first begottē son with a lambe of one yeare olde, which was giuen in sacrifice. And thā shuld be added a doue or a turtyll for y• purifienge of al spot or vnclēnes which might happē to be cōmitted in y• begetting of y• child, or after, to thintent y• that whiche shuld be offered to the lord might be throughly pure. Howbeit if they were not of abilitie to giue a lambe, the law suffred them to giue in stede therof a turtil doue or a pigeō for y• redemptiō of ye child. The other bird was offered for the purging of the sinne. Our Lady therfore and Ioseph offered the pore mens oblatiō, and it is not to be doubted, but they wold haue made a richer gift if theire pouertie hadde not letted them. Allbeit theyre minde was rich in godlynes, and to giue vs an exēple, ye professiō of pouertie was more profitable. But lo, there was at this self time in Hierusalē one Simeō a iuste mā & such one as stode in awe of god, & surelye he might wel be called a iust mā, for heAmbrose. sought not his own but ye peoples weale, he awaited for him yt shuld redeme out of bōdage not him only, but al mākind And bicause he was endowed wt this iustice & godlines, the holy ghost was in him & had inspired him that he shulde not dye, till he had sene with his fleshely eyen him that he longe before had espyed wyth the eyen of feyth.
            
               As Mary therfore and Ioseph were bringinge the child into the temple, this Simeon also cam by the guiding of the holy gost into the temple & toke IesusOrigen. in his armes. And here sayth Origene an auncient doctour of the church, if thou Christen person wilt in like wise hold Iesus and imbrace him in thy handꝭ, thou must with al labour attempt that thou maist haue the holy ghost to thy guide and so come to y• temple of god, as this holy Simeō did. Thou must be a iust person, a fearer of god, religiouse, deuout & godly, as he was. But what did Simeon ha uing this most blessed child in his armes? He blessed and praysed god, sayeng. Now, o lorde, thou dost licence thy seruāt to depart in peace out of this world according to thy worde. For myne eyen haue nowesalutare tuum. seen him, by whō it hath plesed the, to saue mākind, whom I say thou hast prepared and ordeined in the face of al peoples to be, vnto y• hethē persons & Panyms (which hitherunto for defalt of true knowlege haue worshiped false godꝭ) a light for to lightē them & to disclose thy trouth vnto them, & againe to thyn own people y• Israelites a cause of most high glorie This in effect spake Symeon in his maner.
            Let vs therfore (good people) for our ꝑte also blesse & praise god, that wheras we y• inhabitantes of this Realme were before y• cōming of Christ wicked Panims & ydolaters we now by y• disclosing of his gospel

            The sermon vpon this Gospel. The occasion of christes wordes after Chrysostom.
            
            Bycause our sauiour Christ (good people) what tyme he was conuersant here in earth amonge the Iues, hadde vpbrayded them for theire misbeleue, declaring vnto them that the Hethen persones were redyer to receyue hym then they, at which wordes some were offended: therfore he aunswereth to theire thoughtes in thys wyse. I confesse (that is) I do thanke & prayse the O father, bycause thou hastCōfessio inqt. August. nō est solius peccatoris sed aliquando etiā laudatorio, kept close this heauenly doctrine from the wise and prudent men in their owne opinions, such as be the scribes and pharisees, and haste opened the same to fooles and babes after the iugement of the worlde, euen to rude vnformed and rusticall persones. And here (sayth Chrysostomus) we be taught vtterly to pluck down our high stomakꝭ, & to folow humilitie. And truly (sayth he) these wordes whiche our Lorde

spake to his disciples, occasioned them to be moche more diligent and lowly in hert. For bycause it was likely that they stode moch in their owne conceytes for that they did cast out deuiles, therfore with these wordes he abateth their courage & represseth them. For the thing that was done vnto them was a reue lation, that is to say a disclosing and opening from god, and not their owne propre studie and laboure. And therefore the scribes and pharisees estemynge themselfes to be wise & prudent fell from the knowlege of godes mysteries bycause of theire pryde and swelling myndes. Wherfore if the secrete mysteries of god were hyd from them bycause of thys: se then that we be vnder feare and awe, & let vs continewe as babes, for this surely made the apostles of christ to enioy this secrete knowledge. For lyke as wha
                  •
                Paule saith, tradidit illos deus in reprobū sensū,
               Rom. i. that is, god gaue them vp into a disalowed mynde, he speaketh not this, inducing god as doyng thys,☞ but them whiche gaue the cause: so we must vnderstande in like wise this text where Christ sayth, that hys father hath hyd this knowlegde from the wyse scribes and pharisees. And why were they hid from them? Herken what Paule sayth, bycause goyng about to stably she theire owne iustice, they were not subiecte to the iustice of god.
            Al be deliuered vnto me (sayth Christe) from my father. This he spake, les any thing shuld be thought to be les in hym than that whiche is in god. For asS. Aug. contra Maximum. saynt Austin sayth, if our sauiour Iesus Christ the sonne of god hath any thing les in poure then hath god the father, then surely all be not his that the father

hath, for by begettinge did the father gyue the power to hys sonne, lyke as all that he hath in hys substance did he by begettynge ▪gyue to him whom he begatte of his substance.
            Furthermore in the interchaungeable or mutuallHilariꝰ. knowledge of the father and sonne, it is done vs to wyte, that none other thinge was in god the sonne, then was in God the father. For it foloweth in the text, and no man knoweth the sonne but the father, nor noman knoweth the father but the sonne. ForChrysostom. surely by this that he onely knoweth the father, he doth vs to vnderstande that he is of the selfe same substance that the father is of. As if he shulde saye vnto vs. What meruayle▪ I praye you is it, if I be very Lord of all, sith there is yet a greater thing in me, euen the knowlege of the father of heuen, & that I am of y• same substance y• he is of? Thus by these wordꝭ Christ our sauiour declareth himself to be not man only but also god & egal in powre wt his father. And where he sayeth that none knoweth the father but the son: he meaneth not y• al men be vtterly ignorant of him, but this he meaneth, that by that knowledge that he knoweth his heauenly father, noman ells knoweth him. In so moche that that knowlege that men haue either of the father or of the son they haue it by y• sons disclosing. So ye the son discloseth not only his father but also himself vnto vs. For as the holy doctour saint Austin saith. The word doth not only open y• thing that is declared by the word,Austin
                     •
                  
                but also it declareth it self. But how doth y• son disclose his fathers wil & pleasure vnto vs? Surely by his most cōfortable word which is called his gospel.

Come therfore, sayth Christ, vnto me al ye that trauayle and I shall set you at rest. He sayth not come he and he, but come to me all ye that be in cares, inChrysostom. heuynes and in synnes, not that I myght take punishement of you but that I myght losen your sinnes. Come, not that I nede to be glorified of you, but that I desyre your helth and saluation. Come, he sayth, not wyth fete, but wyth maners, not wyth body, but wyth feyth. For this is the spirituall comming wherby one approcheth to god. And if ye thus come, I shal set you at rest, he sayth not I shal saue you, but that more is I shal set you in al quyet and reste. Take my yoke vpon you. What is ChristesTheophilactꝰ yoke? Surely his Gospel which as Theophilactus saith, sheweth vs glad newes, forgiuenes of sinnes, iustification, commynge to heauen, and that we be made the children of god. O how swete, how pleasāt and easy is this yoke? Only let vs put frō vs pryde of hert and the care of worldely vanities & learne of Christe to be meke & lowly, lyke as the holy Apostle Mathias folowynge hys maisters steppes (whose memory we celebrate this day) left vs exemple. So shall we inioye that heauenly rest voyde of all greuance and replenyshed wyth all solace whyche here is promysed vnto vs. By Christ our lorde. To whō be all glorie.

And the angel being entred vnto her said. Hayle full of grace, the Lorde is with the, blessed arte thou amōges women. Whē she sawe hym, she was troubled vpon hys worde and deuised what maner greting this shulde be. And the angel said to her. Feare not Mary▪ For thou haste founde grace with God. Lo thou shalte conceyue in thy wombe, and brynge forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Iesus. He shalbe greate & shalbe called the son of the hyghest, and the Lorde God shall gyue hym the seate of hys father Dauid, and he shall reigne ouer the house of Iacob for euer, and of his reigne shalbe no ende. Mary said vnto the aungell. Howe shal this be, for I knowe not man. And the aungell answered and said vnto her. The holy goost shall come vpon the, and the vertue of the highest shall ouershadow the, and therfore the thing that shalbe born holy, shalbe called the sonne of God. And lo Elizabeth thy cousin, she also hath conceiued a sonne in her olde age, and this is the sixt moneth to her which was called baren▪ for no word shalbe impossible with God. Ma ry said.

            The sermon vpon this gospell.
            IF a Gospell (deare people) signifieth a gladde tydynges, what Gospel can be compared with this gospell which sheweth to the blessed virgine Mary yea & vnto vs all, the gladdest tydinges that coulde

come to mankynd, that is that she shulde beare the moost blessed kyng of kinges and Sauiour of mā
               kynde. Let vs then procede to the declaraciō of this so ioyful gospel. In the sixt moneth was sent to the blessed virgine Mary no cōmon angel but Gabriel the Archangel. For to this so highe and solempne a message it was mete that an highe angell shulde be sent which shulde bringe tydynges of him that was highest of all. Whiche aungel (as Origen sayth) isOrigen. therfore expressed by hys propre name to thintent it might be signified by the same what he is in operation. For Gabriell he sayth betokeneth the strength of God. Wherfore by hym that was the strength of God it was cōuenient that he shulde be vttered and proclaimed whiche being the Lorde of powers and mighty in batell came to conquere & vanquishe the wicked powers of the ayer. And what saith this Archangell Gabriel vnto her? Haile ful of grace. Truly,Hierō. in sermo. de assūp. saith saynt Hierom, she is wel called ful of grace. For to other grace is giuen by partes, but vpon the virgine Mary dyd the fulnes of grace altogether infunde it selfe. She mighte well be cleped full of grace by whome euery creature is wt a large showre of the holyghost ouersprede. Yea already was he wt the virgine whiche sent the angell to the virgine, I say our Lorde went before his messanger. And therfore it foloweth. The Lorde is with the. He is in thy harte, he is nowe also in thy wombe, he replenisheth thy mynde, he replenisheth also thy body. And hereAmbro se. (saith Ambrose) lerne a virgine of her shamefastnes for she was abashed. It is the propertie of true virgines to tremble, & at al approchinges of man vnto

them to blushe, & with a reuerent feare to eschue familiar talkyng with man.
            Lerne yu virgine thā to eschue al wantonnes of wor des. The virgine Mary feared euen the greting of the angell. Yea she wondered at this strange maner of gretinge, wherof the lyke was neuer herde before in any place, this was reserued only for the virgine For (as Origen noteth) if she had wyst y• the like salutationOrigen had euer been made to any other in al y• bible (for she had the knowlege of the lawe) thys gretynge shulde neuer haue troubled ne dismayed her. But albeit she was troubled & abashed at the sodē
               nes of this so strāge a thing: yet seyng she had deserChryso stom. ued such grace with God, she had no cause to feare. And therfore the angel saith vnto her. Feare not O Mary, for thou hast founde fauour & grace wt god. But how foūd she this grace? Surely (saith the holy doctoure Chrysostomus) through her humilitie. And so must al we fynde it. For as holy writ sayeth, God giueth grace to the hūble persōs, And lo▪ sayth the angel, yu shalt cōceiue in thy wōbe & be deliuered of a son whō yu shalt name Iesus. Iesus by interpre tatiō betokeneth a Sauiour. And in dede our lorde is a right Sauiour to so many as cleaue vnto hym by feith. Yea ther is none other Sauiour but he. He is y• only great one & is cleped ye son of ye highest. For albeit it was spoken by Ihon Baptist ye he shuld beAmbro se. great, yet, as S. Ambrose saith, he was called great as a greate man wheras Christe is as greate God. Thys Christ therfore shall reigne in y• house of Iacob for euermore. He called y• house of Iacob not on ly y• outward Israelitꝭ but the hole church of Christ

be they Iues or Gentils which beleue vpō him. For as saynt Paule sayth. Not al they whiche be of Israell be Israelites, but suche as be the chyldern ofRom. ix. the promise, be counted the sede. For, sayeth he, they that be the chyldren of the fleshe, be not the chyldren of God. Now Mary to thintent she wold be yet fur ther instructed of thys mystery, asketh howe thys shulde come to pas, she doubted not of the aungels wordes. Only she desireth to know by what meane it shulde be brought about that she shulde be a mother that neuer lay with man. The angel answereth The holy goost shall come vpon the, as who shulde say. Seke not a natural ordre where the thyng passethChrxsostom. nature. Thou askest how this shalbe, thou not knowyng man. Nay thys thynge happeth vnto the euen bicause thou hast not assayed wedloke. For yf thou haddest, thou shuldest not haue been thoughte worthy to this mystery, not y• wedlok is a prophane☞ thing, but bycause virginitie is better. For it becam the cōmon Lorde of all, both to be pertaker with vs in byrth and also to varye from vs in it. In that he shulde be borne of the wombe, he taketh parte wyth vs, but in that he shulde be borne wythout carnall knowledge of man, he is declared to be no man but god. Mary fully satisfied with his answere sayth in moost humble wise, beholde the handmayde of oure Lorde, be it to me as thou hast said. Let vs then my frendes folow the humilitie of thys blessed virgine. Let vs imbrace Christ like feythful Christians that we maye be of the nombre of his chosen people, and inherite hys kyngdome. To whom be all honoure
            Amen.

To the father as to the fountaigne and hed springe redoundeth the thanke of the hole benefite, whiche what soeuer he giueth and bestoweth vpon you, he giueth through me and his holy spirite. The sappe and iuise of the stocke which giueth also to the braū ches lyfe and power of bearynge of frute is the spirite whiche is cōmon to the father and to me. Thys spirite both knytteth me to the father: and also co

               pleth you to me. Euery braūch therfore which cleauyng to me and liuynge by my spirite, shall brynge forth frute accordyngly: hym woll my father purge, cuttyng of frō him the superfluouse & voyde lustes, to thintent he may bryng forth more plēteouse & also more gentle frute. But on the other side, he y• clea ueth vnto me by the outward name of a christē persō or by an outward profession of feith, wheras in dede he bringeth forth no frute of the christē charitie: this person wol my father cutte of frō the vine, as an vn profitable & voyde mēbre of the same. For in vayne is he in the vine which hath no frute but leaues only, y• is to say, he is a vayne & no true christen person which bosteth himselfe of y• christē feith, & expresseth not the same wt good workꝭ mete for a christen man.

Now, saith Christ, ye be cleane for the worde that IVos mü di estis. haue spokē vnto you. Suerly (deare frēdes) we are purged and made cleane by Gods worde wherunto we haue giuen feith but we are styll to be purged, to thintent we may yet bring forth more plētiful frute. For who is he (as sayth saynte Augustine) so cleaneS. Augustine. in this life, which is not yet more & more to be made cleane? Christe therfore cleāseth those that be cleane that they maye be yet more frutefull. But why saith he not, ye be cleane by baptisme? Uerely, sayth thys holy doctour, bicause in the water also it is the word that cleanseth. For plucke awey the word, and what is the water but water? But let the worde come to the water and so is made a sacrament. Let vs than take hede, that we abide in Christ, that he also maye worke in vs hangynge vpon hym. For lyke as the braunche, yf it be plucked from the vine, can bringe forth no frute, no more can we bryng forth the frute of any good worke, onles we cleaue to Christe by feith and charitie, from whens cōmeth whatsoeuer maketh to the true and euerlastyng helth. I say, let vs loke that we be continually knitte and ioyned to Christ, as we haue exemple of thys holy man whose memoriall we halowe this daye, whiche was an vndoubted liuely braunche of thys vine, and brought forth in the sighte of the worlde moost pleasant and acceptable frute to god. He remained 
                  •

Surely yf any braunche, by hys owne fault plucke hymselfe awey from the true vine: not only he bringeth forth no frute, but as an vnprofitable bowghe being cutte of wyth the knyfe wythereth awey, and anon after is gathered wt the other baren bowghes & thrown into the fyer to be burned, and thus being destitute and voide of the liuely moysture & spirite of Christ, he dyeth in the mynde, thoughe he yet liue in bodye, and after this life being seperated & pared awey from the vine without recouerie, he is cast in to euerlastynge fyer, alweys there to brenne for hys punishement bycause he wolde not styll remayne in the vine as a good braūch hereafter to haue broughtEt verb a mea in vobis māserit. forth and inioyed the frute of euerlastyng ioye. And verely we shal abide in Christ, if so be that his wordes be beleued of vs, if the thinges that we haue be leued we kepe styl in mynd, & fulfyl the same in our dedes. If we do thys, there be no worldly stormes that we nede to feare, for Christe shalbe with vs, the father of heauen shalbe wt vs, the holy goost shalbe with vs, & what thinge so euer we shal aske, we shal wtout doubt obteine it. For as Austine saith, if ChriAugustine. stes wordes remayne fresh in our mouthes or in our memories & be not founde in our life (y• is yf we liue not according to the gospel) we be not coūted as brā ches in the vine, bicause we drawe not life out of the ro

If it were not so, I wold say vnto you, I go to make ready a place for you & if I go to make ready for you, I wil com again & take you to my self, that where I am, ye also may be. And whether I go ye know, & the way ye knowe. Thomas sayth to hym. Lord we knowe not whither thou goest, & how can we know the way? Ie sus saith to him, I am the way and the trouth & the☜ life.

Be leuest not, that I am in y• father & the father in me? The wordes that I speake to you, I speake not of my self. But y• father which dwelleth in me, he doth the dedes. Beleue me that I am in the father & the father is in me. Els for y• selfe dedes beleue me. Ueryly verily I saye vnto you, he that beleueth in me, the workes that I do he shal also do, & greater also then these shal he do, bicause I go to my father, and whatsoeuer ye shal aske in my name, that wil I do.
               
            
            The sermon vpon this gospell.
            Bicause our lord had sayde before to Peter. thatChysostome. whether he went he could not folowe now, but he shuld folow afterward, lest y• other disciples shuld

thinke that this promisse was giuen only to Peter, our sauiour now to cōfort them sayth. Be not troubled, but beleue stedfastly. In my fathers house be many mansions, that is, the selfe same Region shal receiue you that shal receiue Peter. For there is greate plentie there of mansions, and ye shall not nede to say that it is necessary, that they were made redy for you, albeit if I go & prepare you a place, yet wil I com againe & take you with me. Here my frendes ye wol aske, how can Christ go & prepare vs a place, sith there be alredy many māsions in heuen? Saint Austin answereth to this doubt in this wise. TrouthS. Augustine. it is, that there be many māsions, but they be not yet as they are to be prepared. For the self same mansions which Christ prepared before in predestinating, he prepareth now in working. In predestinatiō therfore they be alredy. Els he wold haue said, I wil go and prepare, that is, I wil predestinate, but bicause they be not yet in operation, he said. If I go & prepare you a place. And surely he now prepareth mā
               sions by preparing tenantes for the mansions. For where he saith, in my fathers house be many mansions, what thinke we is the house of God, but the tē
               plei. Cor. iij templū dei sāctum est quod estis vos of god, of which the apostle saith. The temple of god is holy, which temple be you. This house of god therfore is yet in building, is yet in preparinge. But what is that whiche to prepare he goeth away, if he prepare our selfes, whiche how can he do if he leaue vs? Surely (sayeth this holy Doctour) he meaneth this, that to the preparinge of these mansions, theRom. i. Abac. 2 rightuouse man ought to lyue by feythe. But if he shuld see, it were no feith, Christ therfore goeth awey

that he may not be seen, he withdraweth himself frō vs, that he may be beleued. For then is a place prepared for vs, if we liue by feith. This is the wey that our sauiour Christe here speaketh of.
            Yea Christ himselfe (if we beleue in him) is the very wey for vs to heuen, he is y• trouth, he is the life. Let vs not then be troubled (good people) in our hartes For he that is the way, wil not surely leade vs a wilsomHilariꝰ. wey if we stik vnto him, neither will he deceiue vs and put vs in foles paradise, sith he is the selfe trouth, neither yet wol he leaue vs in the erroure of death sith he is the self life. And therfore Christ sayeth further, that no man can come to the father but by him, & he sayth, that he that knoweth him, knoweth also the father, forasmoche as the father and he be one. Yea, sayth Christ, ye that be my disciples do also know my father and ye haue seen him. Undoutedly my freendes, the disciples of Christe sawe god the father after a certayne maner in Christe, commaundynge the wyndes and the sees, commaūding deuilles, driuinge out diseases wyth a worde were they neuer so incurable, raisinge wyth a worde the deade to life agayn. Howbeit y• noueltie of Christes wordes dyd sumwhat trouble the Apostle Philip (whose memory togyther wyth hys felowe saynte Iacob the churche doth thys daye solemnize) as it troubled also the reste of the Apostles. Wherfore saynt Philip more gready than the other to learne, desyreth Christ to shew to them the father and they shuld be satisfied. But what saith Christ to them agayn? Haue I been so long with you & do ye not yet know me? Philip, he y• seeth me, seeth also the father.

Surely if the father of heauen shulde haue spoken vnto his Apostles, he shuld haue spoken none other thing thā that Christ spake, if the father shuld haue wrought, he shuld haue wrought the same y• Christe did worke. The same mind is in them both, the same wyll▪ the same power and nature. If we beleue this, though the corporall presence of Christe as he was here cōuersant amongꝭ his disciples be taken from vs, yet we shal se him absent moch better wt the eyen of feith then y• misbeleuing Iues saw him presently with their fleshly eyen. Thus dyd these two holy Apostles Philip & Iacob see him after he was ascended vp to his father, & therfore the thingꝭ that they saw y• father worke by him, the same by him did they bicause they cleaued fast vnto hym by feith & charitie. Yea Christ vttred also more clearely the power of his godhed after he wtdrew his corporal presence from them.

The Apostles therfore healed disea ses euen with their shadowes, they conuerted to the feith not a fewe persons as Christ did when he was here in earth, but hole nations, but yet they did this by Chryste, or rather Chryste dyd these thinges in them. Lette vs then haue in vs this stronge feith, and this brenning charitie, and than wythout fayle what so euer we shal desyre in Christes name, he woll perfourme it.

            A sermon vpon this Gospell.
            GOod people the church this day doth solēnize the birth of saint Ihon Baptist, whō god had ordeyned to be a messanger to make ready the waye against the cōming of our sauiour Christ. This holy prophetes mother named Elizabeth was thought to haue bene baren. But it pleased god so to worke with her to set forth his owne glorie and power. He

sent to her therfore nowe in her old age this blessed child to take the reproche of barennes from her. He prolonged for this intent her child bearing, that theChry sostom. ioy herof might be the greater, and she be made the more renowined and notoriouse. For all her neighbours & kynsfolke which before had knowne her ba rennes, were nowe made witnesses of the heauenly grace wherwt God had endowed her. For none that saw the child, departed wt silence, but blessed & praysed god which vnloked for had sēt this blessed child vnto her being of this age. The eight day therfore they went to circumcise the child according to Moses lawe. And bicause Zacharie his father was by gods prouision made dūme and spechles, they supposingLuc. i. that the father wold so haue bene best ct̄en▪ ted named him Zacharie by his fathers name. But Elizabeth his mother said he shuld not be so called, but Ihon shulde be his name, whiche name she had lerned not of her husbande whiche at this time wasBede. S. Ambrose. Origen. become spechles, but by inspiratiō of the holy ghost, signifieng that he that was born shuld be the bedel or messanger of the new law, which shuld abrogate the old traditions & turne the carnall worshyp into a spiritual grace. For Zacharias betokeneth in Hebrue a remēbrer of god, & Ihon is named the grace of God. The iustice of the lawe stode in appoynted☞ workes: the iustice of the gospell standeth by faythe through grace & fauour. Howbeit, the kinsfolk wold not be ruled by the mother to giue him this straūge name, bicause there was none in al their kindred so called, but they wolde in any wyfe haue hym called Zacharie by his fathers name. And yet at this day

there be some better pleased wt the name of Zacharie,Erasmꝰ in paraphra. then wt the name of Ihon, these be they that can not yet suffre that the ceremonies of y• old law shuld be abolished, so that in effect they crye we wil none of this new name of Ihon, but we wil haue stil the old Zacharie. wherfore for asmoch as the childwife & the cousins could not agree in the name, it was necessarie that the authoritie of the father shuld come betwene to breake the strife. But he had not as yet the vse of his tong, where now neded speche. Wyth signes therfore they signified vnto him what name wold pleace him that his child shulde haue. He vnderstanding y• mater required writing tables to declare that thinge by dombe letters whiche by liuely voice he could not bring forth. The tables brought he wrote in this wise, Ihon is his name. Now cam the time, that Moses law shuld speake, which before had after a fashiō described wt figures the grace of the gospel. The time now was com, that the mouthS. Ambrose. Luc. i. which vnfeithfulnes had locked, shuld now through feyth be opened. He had not therfore so sone writen, but y• bond of his tong was loused. Neyther did he beginne hys speach with any other thing, than with the praysinge of God, by whose goodnes so greate ioyes were heped vpon hym. Let vs in like manerS. Ambrose. (good people) beleue, as saynte Ambrose exhorteth vs, to thintent our tonge which is bounde wyth the bandes of vnfeithfulnes may be loused. And surelyExasmꝰ. onles the Iuishe tonge be putte to silence, whyche preacheth carnal obseruations, the tong of the gospell can not speake whyche preacheth grace, feythe, and charitie.
            
               Al these thingꝭ of y• olde childwife, of the noueltie of the name, of the son born by y• promise of the angel, of the father made first of a speaker dombe & again of dombe a speaker: were blown abrode not only in the neighbours & cousins mouthꝭ but also through out al the hylly countrey of Iewry, so that they did not only wonder, but also were astonyed & agast at the strangnes of the thing, sayeng wtin themselfes. What maner of ꝑson shal this childe be? None of al y• prophetes was so wōderfully born, which thinges declare, that this is done by gods power which is wt the child beīg ordeined for high purposes. And they thought not thus wtout cause. For in dede gods hād had vttred his heuenly vertue in the childe. And to thintent al thinges might be ful of miracles & reple nished wt ioy, Zacharie also Ihons father being inspired wt the holy ghost brasted forth into this song Blessed be y• lord god of Israell, for he hath visitted & redemed his people of Israell. Doubtles, god visitedChrysostom. his people of Israel both wayes, whether we vnderstande the material Israelites, for he cam to the lost shepe of the house of Israel, or the spiritualMat. xv Ro. ix.

And this is the confession of feith? Thou art Christ the sonne of the lyuyng god. Wherfore Peter (as saint Augustine affirmeth) dothAug. libro. i. retract. cap. xi. here represēt the hole church to whō the keyes were deliuered.

                  ONe of the pharisees desired Iesus that he wold eate wt hym. And being entred into ye pharisees house, he sate downe. And beholde a womā in the citie which was a synner, knowing that Iesus sate in y• pharisees house, brought an Alabaster box of ointment & standing at his feete behinde weping, began to water hys feete wt the teares, & wyth the heare of her hed, she wiped & kyssed his feete, & with the oyntmēt anoynted them. The pharisee seyng this which had called him, spake wtin himselfe saynge. If thys were a prophete, he shulde haue known, who & what maner person is thys woman which towcheth him, for she is a synner. Iesus answered & said vnto him Simon I haue sumwhat to tel the. He said, maister say on. A certayne lender had two dettours, the one ought fyue hūdreth pens, the other fyfty. They not hauyng wherwt to make payment, he forgaue them both. Which of them now tel me wil loue him more? Simon answered & said, I suppose yt he whō he forgaue the more sūme. He sayd vnto hym. Thou haste rightly iuged, and turning himself to the womā, he said to Simon. Seest yu thys womā? I entred into thy house, water to my feete yu gaueste me none, but this womā hath watered my feete wt teares, & wyth the heares of her hed she hath wiped thē. Kysse yu gauest me none, but this womā frō the tyme I entred, hath not lefte kyssing of my feete. Thou anoyntedst not my hed wt oyle, but this woman hath anoynted my feete wt oyntmēt. For which thing I tel the, many synnes be forgiuen her, bicause she loued moche.

But he to whōles is forgiuē, loueth les. And he said to her. Thy synnes be forgiuen the. And they y• sate at meate with him begāne to say within themselfes. who is thys whiche also forgiueth synnes? But he said to y• womā. Thy feith hath saued y•, go in peace.
               
            
            The sermon vpon this Gospel.
            THe gospel red in the church this day (good peoGregorius Nicenus. ple) is right cōfortable to all christē men & womē & cōteineth a very holsom doctrine. For the most part of them which iustifie thēselfes be puffed vp wt a vayne opiniō of godlynes before they haue atteyned to the true iugemēt, separatyng thēselfes as lā
               bes frō gootes, not vouchesauing ones to be cōuersant in the same house nor yet to eate the same meates with other, but abhorring al which be not of like perfection as they thinke thēselfes to be of. Saynte Luke therfore a phisiciō more of the soule thā of the bodye, sheweth vs here, howe Christe our Sauiour most tenderly did visite other. He entred therfore in to a pharisees house, not so much to take bodily sustenaūce of the pharisee, as to giue goostly fode and instructiō to the pharisee, & to heale him of his vain opiniō wherby he iustified himselfe. For lo, as he sat at meate wt the pharisee, Mary Magdalen (for thatAugusti nus de concordan. Euangel. was her name after the mynde of aunciēt doctours) being at y• tyme a notable synful woman hearyng y• Christ (which of his moost tēdre mercy was ready to receiue al synners) was there, cam moost penitently thither into the house, to bewayle her synful life & to heare some cōfort of her saluatiō. She had already herd of the great miracles yt he did, & specially howe merciful he was to al repentant synners. She therfore

moued wt thys fame, came & wyth great humilitie stāding behind him at his feet wept so plētifully that euen wt the teares whiche fel frō her eyen she washed Christes feet, which she wiped agayn, not wt any cloth, but with the very heare of her heade, & she thought not this ynough, but she also kyssed them & anoynted thē wt a very preciouse oyntmēt, which she brought wt her. The pharisee seinge thys, despiceth this dede, & in his harte reproueth not only the synful womā, but also our lorde which suffred her thus to do. Sayng wtin him selfe, yf thys mā were a prophet, doubtles he shulde haue knowne, what maner womā this is, for she is a notable synner. By like yfGregorius in homilia she had come thus to the pharisees feet, he wold violētly haue spurned her awey with his feete. And in like maner, it is to be feared (sayth saynt Gregory) y• some persōs which be indowed wt the office of presthod, yf they haue doon any thing in outward apparaūce iustly, anone they despice their vnderlinges, & haue great skorn & indignatiō at al y• cōmon sinners in the world. Howbeit not only the religious persōs & suche as haue diuided thēselfes frō the cōmon sort of people haue been infected wt this vice, but also geMat. vij nerally euery mā is readier to espye a mote in his bro thers eye, thā a beame in his owne. Thus he despiced y• miserable synner which was infected him selfeErasmꝰ in paraphrasi. wt enuye, wt presūptiō, wt the sicknes of bacbyting & sklādering of other & was so much y• more incurable y• he acknowleged not hys disease. For it cōmeth cō
               monly so to pas, y• mē be soner cōuerted frō notable & open vices as aduowtry ydolatry & such like than frō such as cloke thēselfes vnder y• colour of holines.

Our Lorde therfore not hearing the pharisees wor des, but espyeng his inward thoughtes, answereth him & sheweth himselfe to be lorde of the prophetes. He asketh y• pharisee, whē a creditour forgiueth two dettours the one a greater sūme y• other a les, whether of thē welloue him best? He answered, he yt hath more forgiuē him. Thā said Christe, seest yu this woman? Thou baddest me home to thy house, water to my fete yu gauest me none, this woman hath washed thē wt teares & dryed thē agayne wt her heare. She neuer ceased kyssinge of them syns I came into thy house. Yea & moreouer she hathe anoynted them wt oyntmēt. Wherfore I tel the, many synnes be forgiuē her, bicause she hath loued much, & speaking this, he turned him to the woman & said, thy feith hath sa ued the, go in peace. Oh howe cōfortable is this exemple to all synners? Christe came to cal synners toMat. ix. repētance, & not those that thought thēselfes holy & iust. So here in the person of the pharisee may veryS. Ambrose. Erasmus in paraphrasi. wel be figured the people of the Iues, whiche loked for Christ & whā he came, of presūption they wolde not know him. But in Mary Magdalē, maye be figured the synful Gentils▪ whiche vnloked for of thē louingly receiued him. Let vs then good people folow thys holy woman and not dispaire thoughe we be neuer so greate synners. Only lette vs come to Christ & wyth strong feith desire forgiuenes lamentynge and wailynge our offences, brastynge out into workes of loue and charitie as she dyd, and no doubt we shalbe forgiuen as she was and at last en ioye euerlastynge blesse by Christe our Lorde, who be praysed.
            Amen.

            A sermon vpon this Gospell.
            FReendes, the gospell of this day declareth vnto vs how the mother of saynt Iames and saynte Ihon (which were called the sōnes of Zebedee) cam to Christ to aske a certayne petition of him. Saynt Marke the Euangeliste telleth the tale, as though the sonnes themselues asked the peticion. And in dede it was theyr petition and sute to Christ, but toAugust. de concordantia Euā
                  gel. thintent they myght the soner obteyne it, they toke theyre mother wyth them and had set her to speake for them, as appeareth well by Christes answere. This womans name was Salome which by interpretation betokeneth peacefull, and truly she begat the children of peace. And a great praise of this woman is gathered out of this text as sayeth C

                   thaeum. For not only her sonnes had left theyr father but she also dyd leaue her husband to folow Christ. For he wtout her might liue, but she without Christ

could not be saued, oules perchaūce a man wil say, that betwene the time of the calling of these two Apostles & the passion of Christ, Zebedee her husband dyed, & so she beinge a lone woman, & aged, folowed the steppꝭ of Christ, which is also moch to her praise and cōmendation. For feith neuer waxeth olde, and deuotion feleth no werines. She cōmeth therfore to Christ wt her two sōnes. They had herd Christe sayMat. 19. a litle before, that they which wold folow him in the new byrth, whā he shuld sit in ye seate of his maiestie shuld also sitte vpon xij. seates iuging the xij. tribes of Israel. And that al they which had left house, or brethren & susters, father or mother, wife or children or their landes for his name sake, shulde receyue an hundred times as moch, & shulde enioy euerlasting life. They therfore being as yet imꝑfect, & hauinge litle vnderstandinge of the spirituall kingdom, but thinking rather that Christes kingdom shulde be a worldly & temporal reigne, cam wt their mother, beseching him, that the one of them might sitte on the right hand of him in his kingdom, and the other on the left, meaning, that they might be in some highe authoritie wt him. For sith in a worldely kingdomeOrigen. they do seme to be in honour, which sit wt the king, it was no meruayle, though a woman being led wt a womans simplicitie or ignoraunce, thought, that such thinges ought to be demaūded, and her sōnes also thinkinge yet nothinge highly vpon Christes kingdom, ymagined such thinges of thē that shuld sitte with Christ. Then oure lord the knower of hydChryso stom. thinges, answered not to the wordes of the woman which was made peticioner, but to the counsailes of

her sōues which had set her to do this. Surely our lord Iesus Christ oftentimes suffred hys disciples both to do, speake & thinke many thinges vnrightly, to thintent that by their ouersight and blame, he might finde occasion, to expowne the rule of godlines, knowing ful wel that theire errour hurted not, so long as he was present with thē, but the doctrine and instruction of the same was profitable both for that time present & also for time comming. He saith☜ therfore vnto them, ye wot not what ye aske, as who shuld say. I haue called you from the left side vnto the right, & ye by your counsayle wil rūne to the left side againe. And happily y• thing was therfore done by a woman. For the deuil gatt him to his wont armoursGen iis. of women, that as Adam was spoyled by a woman: so he might also separate & destroy these by their mother. But now destruction coulde not entre by a woman into saintes, sithens frō a woman proceded the saluation of al men. The auauncement of honour delited them, but first it behoued them to exercise the way of labour. And therfore he sayth vnto them. Can ye drinke of y• cuppe that I must drinke of? As who shulde say, if ye wil deserue the swete, ye must also tast of y• sowre. If ye wil haue pleasure wt me in my kingdom, ye must take ꝑte of my payne, & passion. The crowne of rightuousnes is giuen not1. Cor. 9. to al but to them that rūne in the course, and whiche do vse themselfes in such sort, that they may obteine the maistrye. If then he that proueth maistryes in worldly games, kepeth himselfe sobre & absteyneth frō al thinges▪ to thintēt to get a crown ye perisheth, what ought they be, y• seke for an euerlasting crowne

Truly (as sayth Chrysostom) our Lorde knew▪ thatChryso stom. they coulde folowe his passion, but he asketh them this, to thintent all we might heare and know, that none can reygne wyth Christe, onles he folowe hys passiō. For a preciouse thing is not gotten but with a preciouse price. We call the passion of the Lorde,☞ not only the persecuting of the Hethen, but also all violence whyche we suffre stryuyng agaynst synne. This passion and crosse we be all bounde to abyde, if we wyll be counted to be of Christes flocke. Yea and when the glorie of Christ requireth, we must also not refuse to suffre corporall deathe for hys sake. Thus dyd the hooly Apostle saynte Iames (whose memorie we do thys daye celebrate) folowe hym, for he was beheded of Herode for preaching and executynge of hys maisters commission. And therfore it is no doubt of him, but according to Christes owneMat. 19. promisse, he hath receyued an hundered tymes as moch, and doth now enioye the euerlasting life, and that he is one of them, that the kyngdom of heauen is prepared for. Wherfore (good people) lette vs folowe thys blessed Apostle, and as he dyd, so let vs, leue the loue of all worldly vanities, and folow our Sauiour Christe, to thintent we maye be heyres of god and ioynt heyres wyth Christe. For if we suffre with him (saith Paule) we shal also be glorified withRom. 8. i. Timo ij. hym and reygne togither with hym. If we dye with him, we shal also liue with him and enioy the crown of euerlastinge blysse by him, to whom wyth the father and holy ghoste be glorie and prayse for euer and euer.

            The sermon vpon this Gospel.
            THe Gospell red thys daye in the churche (good people) sheweth vnto vs, how the blessed Apostle saynte Matheu was called of oure Sauioure Christe from a customer to be his disciple & Apostle, and how ready he was at his callyng to folow him, whiche readynes of mynde as it is hyghlye for hys prayse and cōmendation, so it is also set forth, as an exemple for vs to folow. Let vs then brefely cōsider the maner of this thynge. As our Sauiour Christe passed by the custome house, he sawe thys Matheu whiche was otherwise called Leui the sonne of Alpheus sitte there, for he was at that tyme one of the custome house, whiche persones be called in latine

               publicani. And surely this kind of mē, bycause theywhat be publicans. did exercise an occupation or office of fylthy gaines and of violent rapacitie, were many ways infamed noted and euyl spokē of, and specially amonges the Iewes. But our Sauiour Iesus Christ, which had called a lytle before vnto him Simō and Andrewe, Ihō & Iames frō a base (though yet not vnlawful) kynde of lyuyng, to thintent he wold openly declare vnto the worlde, that he abhorred no sorte of men at al, so they wold conuert themselfes to better: he calleth this Mattheu vnto hym, and cōmaunded hym to folowe hym. Mattheu castynge no perilles or atRemigius. lest wey despising al perilles whiche myght happen of Rulers forthwyth without delay, leauing his accomptes vnperfite, and leauing his gaynfull office, beganne to folowe Iesus, beinge sodenly made of a publicane a disciple. And bycause he forsoke earthly gaynes, he was ryghtly made a stuard of the Lordꝭ talentes. Truly the very brightnes and maiestie ofHieronimus. the hidde godhed of our Sauiour Christ, which also glystered in his humane face, had power to pluck vnto him with the first syght those that beheld him. For yf the Magnes stone hathe (as they saye) sucheChriste is likened to a Magnes stone. vertue & efficacie in it, that it cā draw vp yron vnto it: howe much more could he that is the Lorde of al creatures, drawe vnto hym whom he wolde? And it happened afterward, that this Matheu, being now called to be Christꝭ disciple, desired him that he wold vouchesaue to take a repast wyth him at his house. Our Lorde neyther disdayned to do thys thynge at hys new disciples request, to thintent he wold gyue vs instruction, that the company and felawshyp of

wicked ꝑsons ought not to be eschued of preachers and holy men, yf there be any hope that by their cō
               panyChryso stom. they woll amende there nawghty lyfe. Mattheu therfore beyng honored by Christes commyng into hys house, made vnto hys maister a great and sumptuouse feast, wherunto he also had byddē many men of his ordre and facultie, that is to wit, euen a bourde full of customers, publicans, and synners, whom by hys exemple and wordes he had allured and drawen into admiration & loue of Iesus. The pharisees therfore whiche were euer huntynge and seking occasions how to sklaunder & trappe Christ, espyeng hym nowe wyth hys disciples, syttyng and eatyng wyth these synful sorte of men, durst not yet rebuke Christe to hys face, lest he shulde peraduenture taunt them againe as he had oftentymes doon before, but went about to drawe and trayne his disciples from him. Wherfore they come to them & say. Why doth your maister eate wyth these publicans and synful persons? Trouth it is (good people) that the euil talkes of euyl men do corrupt the good manersi. Cor.

And he calleth them sicke and diseased whiche beynge ouercome in their cōscience do acknowlege their frailtie, and espi yng howe by the lawe they be not iustifyed, do submitte themselfes by penaunce to the grace of God. But go your weys (sayeth Christe) and learne what thys sentence of the prophete Osee meaneth, whereOsee. vi God sayeth.

               reth to plucke it cleane from them, cōmaūding them that they shulde not ymagen any such thinge in the kyngdom of heauen as they sawe in worldly kyngdoms. For this is a farre other maner thing, it standeth in benefites and not in force, it is obteyned and also mainteyned we ghostly garrisons and not with violence, and is enlarged by persuasion and not by compulsion. The princes of this worlde do practice Lordlines ouer such as be vnder thē, they persuade not their subiectes to loue honestie, but by feare of punyshemēt they fraye them frō wronges, and they compell men to honour them, though they haue neuer so euill deserued it. Yea the nerer they approche to tyranny, the more wol they be honored of the people with hygh tytles. Uerily such is for moost parte the kyngdome of seculare and worldly rulers. But amonges the clergie, the disciples of Christ, & preachers of his gospell, to whom he bequethed hys spirituall kyngdom, ought to be an other fashion of liuyuge. The greater one be among them, the les violent power or glorye he oughte to chalenge to hym selfe. Wherfore (sayeth Basilius that auncient doctourBasilius magnus of the churche) lette not the dignitie extolle the prelate of the church, lest he falle frō the blesse of humilitie. But let him▪ rather know thys, that true humilitie is seruaunte of very many. For lyke as he whiche ministreth to many wounded persons and wypeth awey the fylth of euery wounde, taketh not this office vpō him to extolle and vawnte hym selfe therupon: so moch rather he to whom is committed the cure and charge of maladies and diseases of his goostly brethren and susters ought to caste, and be

carefull wyth himselfe as the minister of all whiche muste render accomptes for all. Neyther is it to be feared (saith he) that the purpose of humilitie shulde be broken of the subiecte, whyle hys better serueth hym. Let prestes therfore & the prelates of Christes churche not be ashamed to shewe that sobrenes and modestie to the worlde which Christ tawght hys Apostles to vse. And the more Apostolicall that men wol be counted and vicares of Christes churche: so much the more ought they to folow Christe and his Apostles in lowlynes & sobrietie. It is not ynoughe truely to be called by a vayne tytle of name the seruant of God, or the seruant of seruauntes, & in dede to practise all Lordilnes, skant vouchsauyng y• men shulde kysse there feete.

               You (sayeth Christe to hys disciples) be they whiche haue abode with me in my tētations, as who shuld say. He that begynneth to be pacient and anone leaueth of, is not rewarded wyth the crowne of glorye, but he that holdeth on to the ende. For (as Bede sayeth)Bede. perseueraunce whiche is called a constancie or strongnes of mynde, is full well cleped the pyller of all vertues. The son of God therfore leadeth wyth him to his euerlastinge kyngdom such as stycke by him and be no starters awey frō hym at euery puffe of winde. For if we by planted in him and be partakers wyth hym of hys death, doubtles we shal also be pertakers and companions of his resurrection. Christ saith here that he hath disposed or bequethed to his disciples the kingdō, which his heuēly father ordeined & disposed to him. The kingdom of ChristIoh 18. surely, is not of this worlde. Neyther is there any equalitie to the lorde, but only an emulation of likenes,Ambrose. For only Christ is the ful image of God, wheras the iust mā is accordinge to the likenes or image of God, yf accordynge to the same, he despiceth thys world, and for this cause also we do eate the blessed bodye of Christ, that we may be pertakers of the heuēly life. Such a sticker by Christ in al his temptations was thys holy Apostle saynte Bartilmew, he was a true prelate of Christes Church, neither was he a minister or seruaunt of other in name and tytle only, but in dede, he preached truely and syncerely not his owne cōstitutions and decrees, but Christes gospel, hym let vs folow, that we also may be made pertakers of that heuenly ioye by Christ our lorde▪ To whom be rendred al thākes and prayses.

And Iesus calling vnto hym a chylde, dyd sette hym in the middes of them, and sayd. Uerily I say vnto you, onles ye turne, and become as children, ye shal not entre into the kingdom of heauen.

               NOt without great cause and consideration (good people) the churche hath appoynted a certaine daye in the yeare for the solemnization of saint Michael the Archangel and by him of al the angels of heuen, sith in them is put no small cōfort in earth to al good and deuout persons. First therfore by the help of god we intende sum what to intreate of their nature and office, which done, we wil brefely declare the gospel of this day. Wherfore ye shal vnderstādA diuision of angels. that there be two sortes of angels, some be good, and some badde. The good angells do continually ministre vnto god and serue for our behouf, and their delite is to do men good, bicause they themselfes be good of nature, and theire office is to execute gods busynes and to take charge and cure of vs mortall men. They defende and protect I say al good folke from the assaultes and violence of the deuyll, they nourish concord, peace, vertues, good studies, artes, sciencies, polecie, cōmon welthes, discipline, & shortly to speake, mans helth and salfgard. That these be the properties and offices of good angells, appeareth very playnly by innumerable places of hooly writte, wheare the good fathers were holpen and be nefited of them, as in the olde testament were Abraham,Gen. 3

Regū xix. armie of Sennacherib as appeareth in the fourthe boke of the kinges. One angell in a plage of pestilence destroyed thousandes of men, as appeareth in2. Regū, xxiiij. the seconde boke of kinges. I let pas the visions of the prophetes Esaye, Elie, Elizeus, Ezechiel, Daniel and the rest, where the Lorde by hys angells dyd speake and teach thinges whiche were to be done & taught. Also the reuelacions of saynt Ihon setforth in the boke of the Apocalipse. Furthermore when so euer almighty god wold set out any singulare thing to mankind, he shewed it afore by his angels, as for exemple, of Sampson, of Iohn Baptist, yea and of Christ himself to be borne. The angels were present at Christes byrth, at his death, at hys resurrection, and at sundry other tymes. Ye shal morouer vnderstand, that there be angels and also archāgels that is to saye, chiefe or principall angels, and they haue distincte officies and seueral functions wherby god almyghty exerciseth hys wonders. The Apostell Paul therfore teacheth, that there be powers, dominatiōs, vertues. And according to their officies and properties they haue names, as saynte Michaell (whose memorie the church doth this day celebrate) as Gabriel, as Raphael, whiche for their high kind of ministration be called Archangels. For lyke as a king hath vnder him princes, dukes, capitans lieutenantes, cōstables and other officers to defend men from iniuries, to kepe the peace, to brydell and punishe▪

so hath god (who is king of kinges) his angels vnder him of diuerse officies for mans sauegarde and defense against noysom spirites. The angels I say of god, whether they be sene or not▪ sene be alweyes ready and assistent to good personnes and be theyr kepers, which thing the ladder that Iacob saw reaching vp to heauen, by whiche ladder the angels ofGen. 28. god ascended & descended, doth manifestly declare. But here peraduenture ye woll aske thys question,A puestion. why angels do not so often nowe appeare, as they did in old tyme? To this questiō the apostle maketh answere in the first chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrues,The solution. where he sayeth, that the lorde in times paste spake to y• fathers by his angels, but to vs he haue spoken by his only begotten sonne, whom the father cōmaundeth vs to heare, whose cōmaundementes and teachinges be set forth vnto vs by the foure Euangelistes, Mathew, Marke, Luke & Ihon. Howbeit an other cause also why the angels appeare not as often to vs, as they did in olde time to the auncient fathers, may be very wel forbicause the world is now set all in naughtines & men be commonly nothinge so pure, so bertuouse, nor so deuout, as they were in times passed. Yet it is manifest & playne by Christes own wordes in the gospel of this day, that euery good person hath his angel whych beholdeth the face of god the father in heuen. Such an angell no doubt had Paule whom he called his angell, asAct. 1
                     •
                  . appeareth in the Actes of the Apostles. Such peculiare angels had the good auncient fathers, and finally such angels haue al good men and women at this day appoynted vnto them of almyghty god.
            
               Wherfore the more fuller and replenished a man be wyth feyth and godly awe, the more often & also the nerer be the angels to him, for accordinge to the cō

If we be then pure & good, doubt we not, but god hath giuen commaundement to his angels ouer vs, that they shuld kepe vs in all ourePsal. 90. wayes. Herunto also do the aūcient doctours of the church ful wel agree. Saynt Hierom, writing vponHierom the gospel of Matheu, sayth. The worthines surely of soules is great, forasmoch as euery one hath his angel appointed vnto him for his keper euen fromOrigenes homil. 71. his byrth. The noble clerke Drigen also sayth, there is at hand to euery one of vs yea euen to the least of vs al which be in the church of god, a good angell the lordes messanger, to direct vs, to rule vs, to monish vs, to gouerne vs, which seeth daily the face of the heuenly father for the correcting of our doinges and obteyning of mercie for vs. Neither doth saint Gregorie disagre from this, which writeth, that eueryGrego rie. one of vs haue a propre and peculiar angell appoynted to the keping of him, and one euil angel to his exercise.

And such as knowe not God them doth he entangle and wrappe in errous, he drowneth them in foly, and shadoweth them in darknes. Also saynt Gregorie writeth▪ thatS. Gregorie. the wille of Satan is alway wicked, but his power is neuer vnrightuouse or vnleful, for of himselfe he hath his wille, but his power he hath of God. Wher fore (good christen people) sith we stand in this state and condition, that yf we be euill and voyde of vertue and of the true feare of God, we be in daūger of these so noysom and wicked spirites, and agayne yf we loue and serue God, we be protected and fensed wt the good angelles, whose benefites I haue heretofore brefely remembred: it shalbe our partes euermore to serue God and to stande in awe of hym, lest by any meanes we might offend and displease him, and so through our fault it shulde come to pas that we myght be depriued of these good angelles & the euill shulde haue power vpon vs. But now let vs procede to the declaration of our gospell. First therfore

ye shall vnderstande that an exemple of the naturallAn exē
                  ple of mans in firmitie ignoraunce blindnes and infirmitie of mankind is here set forth in the disciples of Christ, which as yet measured the kingdom of heuen after the fashon of the kyngdome of the worlde. The disciples come therfore to Christ & aske him, who is the greater man in the kyngdō of heuen? Surely accordingChryso stom. Hierom to the mynde of auncient doctours, thys was a certayne humane affection, whiche crept into the Apostles mindes and as it were a pricke of enuie and of ambition. They had herd of the kyngdom of heuen, they had seen. iij. Apostles led aparte with Christ inMat. 17. Luc ix. to the mountayne that is to wit, Peter, Iames and Ihon, they had herde, how the keys of the kingdom of heuen were giuen to Peter, and howe it was saidMat 16. Mar. 8. Luc. ix. to him. Blessed art thou Simon the sonne of Iona, and I say to the, thou art Peter and vpō this rocke wol I buylde my churche, they espyed Peter also to talke more familiarly & more boldly wyth the lorde,Mat. 17. & lately also they sawe hym preferred before the rest of the Apostles in paynge of the tribute and in maner matched with Christ. For these and suche other thynges whiche as yet they dyd no perfectly vnderstande, they had a lytle preuye grudge and enuie at Peter syth to hym as they thought the principalitie of the kingdō of heuen was appointed wher neuertheles they perceiued he was yonger in yeares then they. They came therfore as I sayde to Iesus and asketh hym, who shall haue the chief authoritie in the kyngdome of heauen. For it coulde not be yet dreuen out of their heddes, but that there shulde be such like dignities and powers in the heauenly and

spiritual kyngdom, as they sawe in princes courtes of this world. Our sauiour Christ therfore, to thintent he wold cleane banish this carnal affection and vtterly expel the same out of their myndes, calleth a certayne chyld vnto him, whō he setteth in the myddes of his disciples, the chyld being yet very tendre of age and

Thys chylde beynge thus sette amonges them, our Sauiour sayeth in this wise vnto them. Uerily, onles ye be cōuerted and be made as childern: it is not possible for you to come into the kingdom of heuen. For declaration of thys texte, ye shall vnderstande,Hierom that Christ did not here cōmaūde the Apostles, that they shulde haue the age of chyldrē but the innocencie, and the thing that the childrē do possesse bicause of their chyldhod, they shulde possesse by their industrie, so that in malice they might be chyldrē, but not in wisdom, as who shulde saye, lyke as this child, of whom I giue you an exemple, doth not continew in angre, neyther thynketh he one thyng and speaketh an other: so you also, onles ye haue such innocencie and purenes of mynd, ye cā not entre into the kingdom of heauen. Wherfore my frendes by Christes owne wordes here we may be right wel assured, that onles we cease frō all malice and rancour towardes our Christē brothern and susters and become Christen mē not in name only, but also in dede & worke, beyng made as it were new men and newly regenerateIhon. 3. not fleshly but spiritually, vtterly casting awey as muche as maye be al carnal and worldly affections,

and be trāsformed into the hauour and simplicitie of yong chyldern, we shall neuer be receyued in to the kyngdom of heauen. Let vs hūble and abase our selues & make vs like to these litle babes whom we se cleane voide of malice and of ambitiō. For he that thus woll humble and lowly hym selfe, shalbeMat. 23.

Trouth it is, that worldly Emperours kyngꝭ and princes do for most partes loue such as be lyke to thēselfes, and amōges them such be in most price and reputation, which can shyft out other and set forth themselfes. Christe in semblable wyse delyteth in such persons as resemble him, who what tyme he was here conuersant amonges vs inPhili. 2. earth humbled hymselfe and became obedient vnto the death, euen the death of the crosse.

Truly (good people) those that be lowly & meke in spirite be most highly auaūced, protected & tendred of almighty god. He throweth down the mighty frō

He resisteth the prowd, & giueth his graces to the lowly persons. Let vs then be hūbled vnderIac .ij. the mighty hand of the lord. For (as saynte Iames sayth) hath not god chosen the pore? Certaynly the pore in spirite & lowly persons be they, whom God hath in his special fauour & grace. For like as in the great mens courtes of this worlde, y• prince or great man taketh the vyllanye or displeasure as done to himselfe, when one doth a displeasure to one of hys great lordes or special seruaūtes, & againe taketh a good turne & benefite as done to himself, when it is bestowed vpon them, euen so the great king of kinges & lord of lordes god almyghty doth so tendre & loue his hūble and meke seruauntes though in the face of the world they seme as persons despised and not regarded, that who so euer receyueth one of thē in Christes name he coūteth the thing done to himself, & as though the partie had receiued Christ himself. And on the other side, he that offendeth any one of these simple and base persons which truste vpon the lord & which depend hole vpon him, shalbe more greuously punished, then if a mylstone were hanged about his necke & he cast into the depe see. For what a more shameful & wicked parte can be shewed, than to greue and hurt them which wil noman no hurte, which enuye noman, which preferre themselfes before noman, whiche loue al persones indifferently?
            
               Wo be to the worlde therfore for greuynge of suche ones. Howbeit the malice of men is so greate, that these greues must nedes be. Wherfore who soeuer coueteth to come to heauen, let him beware howe he hurte them, yea let hym take hede he hurte not hym selfe. Let no affection be so deare to vs but let it be forthwyth karued and cut awey, yf it shulde hindre vs in our iourney to heauenwarde. Our hande, our fote, our eye be necessarye membres, yet rather then they shulde hindre vs, Christe byddeth vs cast them awey. For were it not better sayth he to go to heuen maymed or lame, or wyth one eye, thā with hole mē
               bres to be cast into hel fyer? But sayng this he mentHierom Chryso stom. not, that any membre of the body shuld be cut awey but he wolde haue the affections cut of, whiche calle vs awey from the studie of eternal saluation. For a frende which a mā can skant want is as it were hys one hande. Thy father whom thou dost truste on, is thy fote. Thy wyfe or sonne whom thou tenderly louest is thyne eye. And as there is nothynge so preciouse that ought to plucke vs from heauen: so nomā be he neuer so lowe & pore ought to be despised but rather holpen. Let vs then offend none of those litle ones, namely sith there angelles which haue charge ouer thē do cōtinually beholde the face of almighty god in heuen, so yt by this we may know in what reputatiō they be wt god, seing he hath giuen thē such kepers & cōductours. Let vs thā endeuour our self

            SAint Luke (god people) whose memory y• church doth this day solemnize, though he was none of the .xii. Aposteles of Christ nor of the coūtrey of the Iues but a Grecian, borne at Antioche, and at the beginninge of Christes preaching in Iurye not beingeLuc. 1. with Christ, as he himself witnesseth in the preface of hys Gospell: yet after he had ones tasted ofLege Theophylactū in argumento suo super E uāgeliū Lucae.

The gospel therfore of thys daye is of the sendynge forth of these seuentie prechers & of the cōmissiō and charge that Christ gaue them. In the chapter before thys gospel it is writen, that our Lorde sent forth .xij. Apostles into Galilee to preach the glad tydynges of the kyngdome of God, and to cōfirme it with miracles. But now whē he cam out of Galilee into Iewry and perceyued the greate desyre of the people to heare the gospel, beside the .xii. apostles he chase out of al the nūbre of his disciples threscore and .x. more whom he sendeth forth to preach.

Truely in the election of the numbre both of the Apostles, and also of the seuentie preachers Christ obserued the solēpe vsage of his coūtrey people. For amōges the Iues not only the numbre of .xii. but also the nūbre of seuentie was as who shuld say halowed appropred & consecrate to a publike authoritie, which thyng had his cōmencement and original beginnyng either of that, that Iacob wyth seuentie sowles (as the scripture speaketh) went into Egypte, or of that that seuentie elders of al the tribes were chosē which withNum.

of no strēgth nor authoritie in the law which cōmaū deth yt in the mouth of two or thre, all witnes shulde stande. And he addeth a reason why he sent forth so many, sayng. The haruest is great, but the laborers are fewe. Praye therfore the Lorde of the haruest to send forth laborers into his haruest. Certainly these be few wordes, but many thinges in them com here to be marked. Firste the multitude of them whiche desire the Gospel is here expressed with a very hādsom resemblaūce by the name of haruest. For in husbandry be certaine due seasons & goinges forwarde tyl at laste the corne waxe ripe, and the haruest is at hand. First of al the grounde is broken vp with the plough, thā it is sowed, after that the sede springeth vp into grasse, and shoteth vp into blades & stalkes, and at last the frute ripeth, is cut downe, & brought into the barne. In semblable wise the tyllage of the Lordes ground hath his certaine tymes, hys procedinges and growinges. At the begynnynge Moses brake vp the Lordes grounde wyth the ploughe of the lawe. Then cam the prophetes and did sowe the sede. After that in the tyme of Ihon Baptist appeared the blades. And at last whā Christ cam and sent forth his Apostles cam also the haruest, & the weate beganne to be conueyed into the barne of God. Of this haruest Christ in an other place precheth to his Apostles sayng. Lyft vp your eyen and be holde theIoh. iiij coūtreis, for they be white alredy vnto haruest. And he that reapeth, receiueth a rewarde and gathereth frute into euerlastinge lyfe, so that both he that soweth may be glad & also he that reapeth. For herein is the worde true, that there is one that soweth and

an other that reapeth. I haue sent you to reape that which ye haue not labored. Other haue labored, and ye haue entred into their labours. For this purpose also maketh that which Ihon the baptist preacheth sayeng that a fanne is in Christes hand and he shal make cleane hys floore, & gather hys corne into theMat. 3. barne, but the chaffe he shal burne wt fyre vnquenchable. Wherfore syth the tyme that the gospell of Iesu Chryste is preached is the tyme of harueste, it must be seen, what the corne is that is brought into the barne of god. The corne therfore is partely the☜ men thēselfes which by the preaching of the gospel be gathered into y• barne of Christꝭ churche, partely it is the riches which men by feyth do gather of the gospel. This ryches is no worldly goodes, but spiritual goodes. It is first of al, rightuousnes before god and mā, wherof the one is wrought by feith in Christ (for the rightuouse man liueth through feith)Abac. 
                     •
                  . Rom. 1. the other is gotten by obedience and the frutes of feyth. Finally it is euerlasting life and heuenly ioy. These be the goodes, riches, and corne which be gathered of the spirituall haruest. But lyke as in the corporal haruest, the corne is not gathered into the barnes wt out great sweat & laboure, so who soeuer wil gather the gostly corne must abide many aduersities. And y• more we labour & suffre aduersitie, the more corne shal we gather into our barnes. Wherfor (deare frendes) while it is now the tyme of our haruest, let vs not playe, let vs not trifle, but with glad myndes let vs take the labours of the harueste. He that gathereth (sayth Salomō) in the haruest is theSalomō
                childe of wisdom, but he that slepeth in somer, is the

child of confusion. Go (sayth Christ) lo I send you as lambes amonges wolues. Uerily wolues be naturally disposed to hurt & vex shepe, & shepe against y• crueltie of wolues be altogither vnarmed. Wherfore when Christ saith. I send you as lābes amongꝭ wolues, it is asmoche to say, as I sende you vtterly vnarmed amonges most cruell & hurtfull enemies. What peace, what rest, what helth, can one loke forObiection. amongꝭ such enemies? But ye wil say, this is not to cōfort his disciples, but rather to discourage them from imbrasing the gospel. Trouth it is that this is a very hard word, I send you as lambes in middes of wolues, but yet it was a word necessary to be spo ken vnto the apostles & disciples to monish them of the troubles & persecutiōs that they shuld suffre, lest they shulde dreame; that the kyngdom of Christe in erth shuld be a corporal thinge. For if the kyngdom of Christ had bene of this worlde, he wold not haue sent forth his disciples as shepe amōgꝭ wolues, but rather he wold haue brought to pas, that they shuld haue bene receiued of al men with high reuerence & honour, wheras now he layth them out to exceding daungers and perilles. They shal (sayth he) deliuerMat.

And in an other place he sayeth. TheIhon. 16 tyme is cōminge, that who soeuer kylleth you, woll thynke he hath done hygh seruice to God.
            Truly this that Christ speaketh to his Apostels, he speaketh to al right christen men & women. For they also muste entre into the kyngdom of god by many

afflictions. Let vs goe then eueryone in his calling armed with the only protection of Christ. The euyll disposed personnes wol fume and chafe against the pure doctrine of Christ, but with these doth Chryste couple vs vnarmed and naked. He sendeth vs not to hurt any man, but like simple and harmeles personnes to helpe al men. He commaundeth his preachers and disciples not to seke succours of men to defende them against the violence of wicked persōs nor yet to be carefull for their lyuynge. He byddeth them goe light and vncombred to the office of preaching,☜ bearing with them neither wallet nor scrippe that is, nothynge that perteyneth to the necessitie of nature, for al thinges shalbe caste vnto them. Neyther to care for theire harbroughe, for there shall be euer some to receyue them into their howses, only let them do their duties, and shewe themselfes true preachers of his worde.

                if not it shall returne to them agayne. But here ye wil aske, why Christ cōmaunded his disciples to salute noman in the way? Ye shall vnderstand, that in the fourthe boke of kynges, the prophete Elizeus4. Reg. iiij. gaue lyke commaundement to his seruaunte Giezi sending hym on an hasty message. Christe therfore meaneth by thys, that he wolde not that hys preachersCyrillus. Ambrose shuld vnder pretence of greting and interteining of their carnal freendes, be by any meanes hindered from the executing of their office.
            
               But what were these seuentie disciples cōmaunded to preache? that the kingdō of god drew nigh. Why (ye wil say) is it inough for to know this? No verily for the deuyl also knew this, & yet is damned. What then? This is necessary to be preched, that we might be warned to repent, & so atteyne to the kingdom of Christ. Wherfore, go we to, let vs imbrase this gospel by feith, let vs repent, that when Christ shal com in Maiestie: we may reigne wt him whiche with the father & holy gost is to be glorifyed for euer

            The sermon vpon this Gospel.
            
               OUr Sauiour Christ (deare frendes) giueth vs here a speciall cōmaundement, that we shulde loue one an other. First, bicause he by so many ways hath declared his loue towardes vs. Secōd bicause in the worlde, if we be true folowers and louers of him, we shal haue none that wil hartely loue vs, but rather the world woll surely hate vs. And why woll the world hate vs? bicause the veritie of the gospell is brought vnto vs out of an other world into thys world by Christe, and Christ as a straunger cam into this world. Wherfore it is no meruayle, thoughe he hath many haters and despicers. For a straūger amonges straungers can not easely fynd freendes. Besydes thys, whatsoeuer is in thys worlde, it is nawght elles but luste of the fleshe, luste of the eyen and pryde of lyfe, as saynte Ihon wryteth. Yea the1. Ihō. 2. chief renownes of this world (as carnal iustice, carnall wisdom, carnall power) be starke nawght. For the Iues were rightuouse in flesh, but seking to stablish their own ryghtuousnes they were not subiect to the rightuousnes of god. The Grekes were estemedRom. 2. the wisest men of the worlde, but the wisdom of this worlde was foly before god. Christ by his gospel repreueth the worlde of synne, & vtterly reiecteth the wisdom, iustice, & power of this worlde teaching them to be falshode and no trouthes, and he setteth vp an other kynde of iustice that muste be obteyned by feythe, an other kynde of wysdom to be lerned of gods worde, and an other kinde of power to be gotten by trouble, crosse, affliction and suffraunce. The worldly men therfore not abydyng their thinges to be eyther repreued or reiected do hate Christe, they

persecutel his gospel and stampe against his word. And loke how moch the worlde hateth Christ & hys gospel: & euen so moch they hate so many as purely and syncerely do eyther preache or set forth by any meanes the same. They persecute them they kyll them. And for this cause Christe armeth al his true preachers and disciples by hys owne exemple that they shrynke not, when they be persecuted troubled or vexed, sayng. If the world hateth you, knowe ye that it hated me first ere it hated you, as who shulde say. Let it not seme straunge that ye be hated of the world, for the seruant is not in better ease than hysMat. 20. maister, they hated me first, wherfor how shuld they not but hate you also? Uerely al that be the true folowers of Christe be not of the worlde first bycause Christe hath plucked them aweye by feyth from the ma

               ers of this worlde and hath clothed them wyth the newe heauenly man, and secondly bycause they allowe not the thynges of the worlde but counte all worldly thinges mere folies and vanities, and (as Paule saith) the world is crucified to them and they to the worlde. The worlde therfore can not but hate them, but persecute them, but exclude them out of theire companyes, yea, and if they can, put them to death. And al these thynges (sayth Christe) shal they do vnto you for my names sake. But what is thys to say, for my names sake? Surely sayth saynt Austine,Saynte Austin. Christe here meaneth, that they woll hate hym in hys disciples and true folowers, they woll persecute him in them, and wol not folowe nor kepe their worde bicause it is his worde.

If Chryste had not comme and spoken to the worlde, it shulde haue had no synne. It is the preachinge of the gospell veryly that discloseth all vngodlynes and the vnrightuousnes of the worlde, and whiche also setteth open the iustice of god. Lette vs not then my freendes be ashamed of the gospell of Chryste. For as (the Apostle sayeth) it is the power of God to theRom.

                  . helth and saluatiō of al that beleueth. For the rightuousnes of God is by it opened out of feyth into feyth. Now therfore sith the gospel is preached vnto vs whyche discloseth synne, we haue no excuse no clooke to hyde our synne wyth. We know god, and yet we do not glorifie ne worship him as god, we be not thankfull vnto hym for the great & inestimable benefites which from time to time we haue receiued at his handes. We be called by the ministres of his holy word, but we wol giue no eare. We be tawght, and we wil not attende. Wherfore it is moche to be feared that like as we haue not regarded to knowe god: so god wil giue vs vp into a disalowed minde.

If a mā wold hate him that he knew not, he might peraduenture seme worthy of pardon and forgiuenes, bycause he can not finde in his harte to fauour him whom he neuer sawe. But we haue sene Christ and haue harde him thoughe not personally as the Iues sawe him and hard him, yet by the preachyng of the gospell we knowe his power and ryghtuousnes, and we espye our infirmitie and vnrightuousnes. I say in his worde we se him and heare him as wel and as perfectly as the Iues did. We haue seen his great benefites, we haue hard of his wonderful dedes, & yet I feare lest there be many worldly persons amonges vs which do hate Christ & hys word in very dede thoughe they pretende neuer so muche to loue hym, and they hate hym and his worde euen for the same thinges, for whiche they ought to loue him and the preachers of his word. For in that they hate the preachers of his worde, they hate his word, and in that they hate his worde, they hate hym. And verily who so euer hateth Christ and hys preachers or his word, doth hate also in very dede god the father by whose authoritie and speciall cōmaundemēt al is doon. Wherfore thys very thynge doth heape damnation vpō such worldly persons bycause they abuse so lewdly and so stubbernly the offred & open goodnes of God. If Christ by the preachyng of his mooste holy worde had not vttered amonges them suche miracles and wonders as none of all the prophetes euer vttered, whether we woll consider the greatnes or the multitude of them, they shulde not haue been in daunger of so heynouse a synne. But nowe haue they both herde and seen the trouth, and

the more they haue herde & seen, the more they haue hated both it and the preachers therof. So that thePsal. 35. and. 69. saynge of God by his prophete is in them fulfylled, where it is written, they haue hated me wythout cause. It might be borne yf one did hate one beinge sturred and prouoked by displeasure and vnkyndnes shewed vnto him to hate him. It myght be perdoned yf a mā wold hate one he knewe not: but how can it be borne, that one shulde hate hym whom he knoweth and which studyeth to do him all the good he can for hys sauegarde and soule health? In thys sort did our sauiour Christ eōforte his Apostles and by them vs all, to suffre tribulation and hatred for hys sake. Let vs then folowe them and namely the blessed Apostles Simon and Iude whose memorye we do thys daye celebrate, whiche had experience of these counfortes in their crosse whiche they bare for Christes sake, neyther wolde they suffre themselfes to be plucked awey from the trouth of Gods worde for al the hatred malice and trouble that the worlde could practise against them. If by their exemple we do the same, we shal vndoubtedly with thē be crowned eternally by Iesus Christ our Lorde whiche togither with the father and holy ghost is world with out ende to be praysed.

Let vs then se what thys Gospel speaketh. Ye shall therfore vnderstande, that our Sauiour Christ Iesus, when he was walkyng here in earthe amonges vs, and espyed the people more and more to gather about him of al sortes of mē, he withdrew hym selfe

as it were frō a low place, and goyng vp to an high hylle, beganne there to sette abroche hys heauenlyChryso stom.

His disciples whom he had specially chosen, folowed vp wyth hym, but so yet that the cōmon sort of people were not forbyden to folowe, yf any amonges them had so great affection and grace. When he was come to the toppe of the hylle, he satte him down not as wery but as goyng about to teache high & seriouse thynges, which wolde requyre diligent hearers. Hys disciples therfore perceyuyng that, beganne to drawe nerer vnto hym, that nothynge of hys heuenly doctrine myght fall to grownde. Begynnyng then to teache hys diuine and most holsom lernyng, not out of the proud pulpit of the philosophers neyther out of the arrogāt chaire of y• phar

Thys doctrine his disciples yea and al holy men and women imbrased and so obteined the eternall blysse and beatitude here promysed vnto them. Let vs therfore heare also thys doctrine (fo

               Bicause the most poysoned & noysom sicknes of the mynd is pride and arrogance which is a let to man that he can not receyue the true doctrine, or rather it is the fountaigne of all hed vices: our Sauiour first healeth this disease, sayeng. Blessed be the poreBeati pauperes spiritu. in spirite, for the realme of heauens is theirs. Assuredly the slender liuing, the lownes of byrth, the obscuritye of estate, the aduersitye of fortune maketh many men abiecte, lowly, & to set no stoore by themselues. And veryly these be y• nerer to the blesse that the gospel speaketh of, if they folow in mynd thither as fortune hath called them. But this lownes & humilitie of spirite that is here commended, stādeth inObiection. the affection, and not in outwarde thinges. Ye woll say, how can these men raigne which take nothinge vpon them, which giue place to al, which set nought by themselues, which suffre themselues to be troden vnder fote, & finally whom noman setteth by, but al men despice? I answere, that it is yet true that theAunswere. selfe trouthe hath spoken, the kyngdom perteyneth only to them, the kingdō I say of heuen.

They be tormented & crucifyed with couetise, with ire, with enuye, wyth lust of vengeaunce, wyth feare, with hope. They skant liue, they raigne not. But the holy person, the saynt, the godly & deuoute man or woman steyng himself vpon his innocencie, vpon god, & vpon the reward

and foloweth the heuēly goodes. Doth not I praye you this man obteyne a reigne or a kyngdom farre more goodly and more excellente, then is the reygne of tyrantes? He is not vnder the cōmaundemēt and rule of the lust nor of couetise neither of none of the other moost noysom pestilencies of the mynde. But this holy person being armed with feith, as oftē as the case requireth, doth lay his cōmaundement vpō diseases and they flee awey, he cōmaūdeth the sees, and they be styll, he cōmaundeth deuilles and they departe. Of thys force and power is the kyngdome of that harte whiche is godly and setteth nought by it selfe, distrusting al humane helpes and socours, & depending holly of God. The wordly kyngdom is gottē by violence & defended by hygh courage. But this kingdom is gotten by modestie, & stablished by humilitie. The world iugeth none mete to a lorship or raigne but such as be of hault and high courage. But god calleth those chiefly to his kingdom, which do moost of al hūble and deiecte themselfes.

But assuredly it is not the heapynge vp of goodes which satisfyeth the mynde, nor the welth of man is not to be mesured by the fylling of the bely. Whom doth Christ then in this kynd calle blessed?

God frely pardonynge all our synnes doth allure vs all, of whom he hath been offeded, to peace and amitie. Of hys owne bountie & mere goodnes he sheweth hym selfe mercifull to all whiche do repent them. Wherfore he wol knowlege none for his chyldrē, but those that shewe themselfes suche to their brethern, as he hath shewed himselfe towardes al uniuersally. Carnall fathers do disherite suche chyldren as wyll not agre wyth the rest of their brethrē, so in lykewise the heuenly father woll refuse for his chyldern suche as be haters of peace & makers of debate. And bycause the more parte of men and women be naughtyly disposed: peace can not frame wyth all persōnes onles it be by suffraūce of wrōges. It is the parte of them that be good, to apply themselfes by all the meanes

they can possible, that they haue variaunce wyth no maner personnes whether they be good or bad, yea they must prouoke al as nere as they cā to loue and concorde by gentlenes, by softnes, by doyng good turnes and benefites. But there be some so froward and so vngraciouse, that with good turnes they be the more kyndled to mischief, and whiche for pleasures do men displeasures agayne, they rage vpon their well wyllers, and count them for extreme enemyes whiche labour to saue them. If peace can not here take holde on bothe sydes, yet neuertheles they shalbe blessed euē for their desire and study of peace, when the wycked do persecute and trouble them for none other cause, but for the iustice sake of the Gospell, whiche hurteth none, and helpeth all. For euen thys selfe thynge sturreth vp their hatred for which they oughte to haue shewed their loue, neyther for any other cause do they rendre wronge, then for the whiche they ought to haue giuen thankes. Christe sayeth not, blessed be they that suffre persecution of the Hethen people. For thoughe a man suffre persecutionChrysostom.

For yf it be true☜ that the prophetes be martyrs, which were stayne of their owne natiō, wtout doubt, he yt for gods cause, suffreth any thing, though he suffre of his owne nation, hath the reward of martyrdō. And therfore the scripture hath not put the ꝑsons of y• ꝑsecuters, but the cause only of the persecution, that we shulde not loke, who it is that psecuteth, but for what cause.

And what is the reward? not a garlande of flowres or bay leaues, not an oxe or a goote, but the kyngdom of heuen.

First therfor ye shal vnderstand, that almighty god what time he first made & created man in paradice, consydering of his botomles wisdom, how necessary, mete and conuenient it was, to couple man and womā togither in wedlok, both for the comfort, aide and helpe of one an other, and for the multiplicatiō
               
and meyntenaunce of mankinde in lawful successiō and also to thintent that therby generation of issue might after mans fall be continually from tyme to time maynteined vntyll the ende of the world without synne or offêse towardes god: did not only euen than at the beginning and in paradice knytte Adam and Eue togyther in matrimonye, and dyd ordeyne and blesse the same by his holy worde, but also dyd declare and set forth the vertue and strength therofS. Austine. by the mouth of Adā, for he being inspired (as saint Austine and other holy doctours say) wyth the holyGen.

Loo now these bones of Eue my wyfe be fourmed of my bones and this her flesh of my flesh. She shalbe called a woman bycause she is taken forth of the man. And for this cause shall man leaue his father and his mother, and cleaue fast vnto his wyfe, and they tweyne shalbe one flesh. By which wordes it is ment, that by the strength and vertue of maryage ryghtly made, the man and wyfe whiche before were two bodies, be now made one bodye, durynge their liues, so that herafter the husbande (as sayntei. Cor. v Paule sayth) hath not power ouer his owne bodye, to vse it as him lusteth, but it is hys wiues, neyther hath the wyfe power of her owne bodye, but her body is her husbandes body and wyth hym only may she vse the acte of matrimony. And therfor they two so knytte & conioyned by gods ordenaunce, may in no wise

               Secondly deare frendes, ye shall vnderstande that god renewed his sayd ordinaūce of matrimony and sanctifyed it wyth hys holy worde immediatly after Noes floude. At which tyme being al y• people of the world destroyed with the said floude (except Noe his childrē and their wifes) god callyng them out of the arke said vnto them. Crescite & multiplicamini, etGen. ix. replete terram. that is th say. Encrease & be ye multiplied and fulfyll you the earth agayne. And albeit this law and cōmaundement of matrimonie giuen agayne to Noe and to his chyldren was a sufficient instruction vnto them and to all their ofspring how to vse it in all clennes and puritie: yet god ꝑceiuing mans naturall inclination to synne and malice, dyd afterwarde further stablish and declare the same by hys other lawes written more at large shewyng the degrees of cōsanguinitie and of affinitie which nature abhorred to marie in, as appeareth in the boke of Leuiticus the. xviij. &. xx. chapters. Which lawes of prohibition al we christen men and womē be vonden to obserue and kepe. For who so euer marieth wythin the degrees there expressed and prohibited of God in the said boke, be cursed by Gods mouth, and their mariage is of no force ne strength neither afore God ne man, but detestable, abhominable, deuelishe, and damnable. And on the contrary syde all mariages made betwene kynsfolke or alyes that be not wythin the degrees whiche be in that boke forbydden of God (though the bishoppe of Rome hath neuer so moch forbiddē them) be without any dispē
               sation of man good, holy, godly, and approued not only of God, but also authorized by acte of parlimēt

made in the .xxxij. yeare of the reigne of oure mooste drad Soueraigne lorde the kyng that now is Henry the eight.
            Thyrdly ye shall vnderstand, that this coniunction betwene mā and wife in matrimonie was ordeined, that therby also myghte be represented vnto vs not only the perfecte & indissoluble vnion of the nature of God with the nature of man (whiche was fulfylled, when the second person in trin
                  •
               tie toke vpō him the fourme and substāce of oure nature) but also the lyke cōiunction in perfecte loue betwene Christ and his churche, as the holy apostle Paule witnesseth inEphe. 5. his epistle to the Ephesians, where goyng about to proue, that al womē which be maried, ought to loue and to be subiecte vnto their husbandes in all thynges, euen as the churche is subiecte to Christ, & likewise that al husbādes be bound to loue their wiues, euen as Christ loueth the church hys spouse: he brin geth in the first ordinance of matrimonie: as it was ordeyned by god in paradice, and the wordes before rehersed, wheruppon he inferreth & sayth, that thys cō
               
                  •
               unction of man and woman in mariage wherby they are knitte and made one flesh and one bodye is the sacrament, that is to saye, the figure, the significatiō, the mysterye, or the prophecieng before of that great and meruelouse cōiunction which is betwene Christ and his churche. For like as by the vertue of thys first ordinaunce of matrimonye, the man and wife be made as one body wherof the mā is the hed: euen so the excedinge loue of Christe towardes hys spouse the church knytteth and maketh Christe and hys church to be but one bodie, wherof Christ is the

hedde. And lyke as the woman was fourmed of the rybbe of man: so of Christe sprang forth the churche☞ whiche is purified by water and bloude. The rybbe is the harder part of the body, & the husbande is the strength of the wife, & euen so is Christ the strength of the churche. Out of the rybbe and myddes of the bodye was the wife brought forth: and euē so Christ toke fleshe of our substaunce, borne of the vndefiled virgine, made like vnto vs in al thynges, synne only excepted. Wherfore we be called the membres of one bodie of hys flesh & of hys bones, mēbres I say, not accordyng to the nature of the euerlasting diuinitie,S. Hierom. but accordinge to that he vouchsaued to take, mans nature vpon hym. Howbeit thys coniuncton may not be takē carnally but spiritually. For albeit Christe toke our real fleshe: yet we be hys spirituallS. Ambrose. membres. For we be one bodie, bicause we be partakers of one spirite. And forasmuche as there is so great a cōiunction betwene Christ and his churche: we ought for his sake to leaue the dearest thingꝭ we haue, if they wold plucke vs awey frō Christ whose spouse we be. For we muste cleaue to hym without seueraunce, syth we be one bodye, & one fleshe wyth him. And verely this is a greate sacrament, mysterie, and secrecie, which if it be rightly pōdered, plucketh vp our mindes into moost highe and heauenly ioyes. Hitherunto we haue brefely spokē of the first ordinaūce of mariage, now let vs come to the declaration of this present Gospell.
            The pharisees which amōngꝭ y• Iues were takē for mē of great holynes, and therfore ought best to haue magnified Christ and his doctrine, were euer moost

busye agaynst him, inuēting al they could, to trippe hym in his wordes, that they myght haue some pretence to accuse hym, & put him downe. For they had no litle enuie at him, ꝑtly bicause he shadowed their estimation, & ꝑtly bicause he disclosed their hypocrisie. They cam therfore on a time and craftely did set vpon him, taking occasiō of the wordes he had spoken cōcerning that a mā ought not to put awey his wife. They propounde a suttil sophisme, whether it were lawfull for euery cause for a man, to put awey his wife. For if he shulde answere, it were lawful, heS. Hieronimꝰ. shuld seme to be agaynst himselfe, where he tawght dyuorses not be lawfull. If he shulde denye it, he shuld seme to be against Moses law, which suffrethDeut. 24. a man for any maner cause to gyue her a libel of diuorcement and to let her goe. But Iesus so tempereth hys answere, that neyther he diminisheth the authoritie of Moses, neither recāteth his owne teachinge, & wyth the authoritie of the law he stoppeth the pharisees mouthes whyche were lawyers. HaueGen. ij. ye not redde (sayth Chryste) that when God created the worlde he formed the man and women, that by there cōioynyng, mankynd shuld be cōtynued? And forthwith expressing the vnpartable couple of them added. For thys loues sake, shal man leaue father & mother and stycke to hys wyfe. And thys knotte is so straight ye of two be but one person. So ye it is as moch agaynst nature, that the one shuld be plucked frō the other, as it is for one part of ye body to be seuered frō an othher. Wherfor ye God hath thus coupled, let not mā seuer. Meaning herby, ye it is both aChrysostom. gainst nature & also ye law a mā to cast vp hys wife.

Here the pharisees thinking that they had now gotten a good quarell against oure sauiour Christ Iesus to snach him vp said vnto him. If it be thus asobiection. thou sayst that god wold haue wedlocke so inuiolabely kept: why then dyd Moises make it lawfull to the husbande, for any maner cause to put from himDeut. 24 his wife, so that he giue her a libel of diuorcement? as who shuld say, how durst Moses be so bold to licence that thing which god wold not haue done. To this obiection our sauiour aunswered. Moses dydThe solutiō of Christe. not permitte ne licence this thing vnto you, bicause the thing of the owne nature was honest and rightfulle but forasmoch as he knew the stubbornenes & hardnes of your hartes: therfore he graunted vnto you the lesser & lyghter inconuenience that ye shuld not committe the greuouser offence. For assuredly Moses did not allow al kindꝭ of diuorces, in that he had leuer y• the same were suffred or rather winked at, then murder shuld ensue & be cōmitted. Neither did the libel of diuorcement amōges the croked Iues whyche Moses theire lawmaker inacted that it shuld be giuen to the womā, make the diuorce good and lawful, but rather that same libel was a witnes and testimonie of the hard harte of the Iues, which for euery light cause and tri
                  •
               le, wold put away their wiues, & for this cause the law of moses gaue commaundement, that such stubburne & hard husbandꝭ whyche wolde nedes for such light occasions put awey their wyues or els do worse & committe further inconuenience, to gyue them the sayde libelle of diuorcement for a certayne recorde & witnesse that she is nowe free from his yoke and at her libertie.
            
               But at the begynnyng (sayth Christ to these pharisees)Ab instio autem nō fuit sic. when as yet the malice of m
                  •
                was not growen into such an excesse, nor as yet mās nature was not infected with so many vices (for the hatred was not so feruent, that either poysoning or murdering was feared) there was no such licence of diuorces. Wherfore neither now is the same licence to be suffred amonges christen men, after that the doctrine of the gospell hath brought agayn the christen man to his former state and perfection of nature by regeneration or new byrth. And no doubt (my freendes) Moses amonges the Iues wished in his hart the same perfecte loue and fast knot in wedlocke to be obserued and kept, that our sauiour Christ hath tawght vs, but (as I haue declared) the corrupt & nawghty maners of the Iues, whyche for euery lyght grefe were ready to cōmitte murder and all mischief, feared him that he durst not requyre that of them. So that our sauiour Christ did not abrogate the auncient lawe of Moses, but he made it more clere & perfect, declaring vnto the froward Iues, that it was vnlawful both for them & for al other and againste the minde of god and the wille of Moses their lawmaker, that they shuld for euery lyght occasion put away their wiues whom they ought to loue & to imbrace as their own bodies and their owne flesh. For☜ a thing that a man doth, is not forthwith lawful for him to do bicause he is not punished in this worlde for the same. For there be many thynges abominable and stinkyng afore the face of god, which be not punished by mans lawes. Hitherto haue we intreated the gospell of this day. Now we woll sum what

towche the officies aswell of the wife towardes herThe office of the wife husband as of the husband towardes his wife, and so make an end. Ye wifes (sayth saint Paule) be ye subiect to your owne propre husbandes as vnto the Lorde. For the man is hed of the wyfe, euen asEphe. 5. Christ is the hed of the churche, and it is he whiche giueth helth to the body, Wherfor like as the church is subiecte to Christe: so let the wifes be subiecte to their husbandes in al thinges. Likewise saint Peteri. Pe. iij. in his first epistle cōmaundeth christen wiues to be in subiectiō to their husbandꝭ, to thintent that euen they which obey not gods worde, maye without the worde be wonne by the conuersation of the wyues, when they behold their chaste conuersation ioyned with reuerence. Whose outward apparell he wolde not shuld be gorgeouse nor moch glysteringe to the eye, but rather he wold haue them inwardly garnished in the hart, being there ful of al clēnes & wtout corruption, in such sort as they may haue a gentle & quyet spirite, which spirite he sayth in gods eye is a thing most gorgeouse & sumptuouse. For after this maner in olde tyme (sayeth this holy Apostle saynte Peter) did the holy women, which trusted in god, attyre themselues, and were obedient to their husbādꝭ euen as Sara obeyed Abraham her husbād, callingGen. 16. him lorde, whose daughters al ye be, as longe as ye do wel. Saint Paule also sayth, that the woman is1. Cor. 11 the glory of the man. For the

               nā cam not of the woman, but the woman of the man. Neyther was the man created for the womans sake: but the woman for the mans sake. Womē therfore ought to imploy their diligence vpon the vertuouse bringinge vp of

their children & to loke wel to their housholde. Yea they shalbe (sayth saynt Paule) saued by bearing ofi. timo.

For this is their office, thys is their fūction & calling wherin they ought to pleaee god, & to atteine euerlasting blesse. They ought to be no tāglers, no disputers, no teachers in cōmon assembles but herers, but lerners & kepers of silence wt al subiection. These be the officies & duties of christen wiues.Ephe. 5. The office of the husband (as Paul saith) is to loue his wife euen as Christ loued the church. He is bounden to loue her, as his owne body. He that loueth (sayth he) his wife loueth himselfe.

            WElbeloued people in our sauiour Christ, this gospel is right comfortable to al feithful and true christian folke. For in it is conteyned the glad and swere tydinges to al vnfeyned Christians, that is to wit, how Christ is our resurrectiō and our life, if we beleue vnfeynedly vpon him. and verely this is one of the chiefest articles of our religiō, to beleue that though we dye here bodily for a tyme or rather slepe, for so the scripture calleth it: yet we shal rise againe and lyue euerlastingly wyth God in heauen, through Christ, in case we haue had stedfast feith in him, and be founde cladde and adourned wyth theMat.

Truly thys mans feith is not the true and liuely feith, but it is a feyned feith, and a deade feith, as saint Iames calleth it, bicause it isIa. 1

So also feith if it hath not deades it is of it self dead. By these wordes of saynt Iames we may lerne (my freendes) that it is not inough for a christē man or womā to say he beleue in Christ, but he must also shew vs his feyth (as saynt Iames sayeth) by his dedes and workes.

But yet for the better & more cleare vnderstāding of this gospel, I thinke it very expediēt to repete & declare vnto you the very begynning of the historie whiche is red in this gospel, accordyng as saynte Ihon the Euangelist doth report it in the begynninge of the xi. chapter namely sith in it is conteined the most cō
               fortable & chefest article of the christen mans beleue.

The historie is this. As our Sauiour Christ abode at Iordan, it chaunced that in a towne named Bethania, a certayne man called Lazarus laye sycke. This towne was the natyue place & countrey both of the sycke man, and of his two susters Mary and Martha. Uerely this Mary was she, which wyth a notable record of loue towardes our sauiour Christ had annoynted hys hed as he sate at meate wyth a right preciouse oyntment & with her heare had wyped hys feete whyche she had washed with the very teares that ranne downe from her eyen. By reason wherof we may very wel vnderstāde, that there was a singular and a right special amitie and frendship betwene this familie and our sauiour Christ. WherChryso stom. fore when Lazarus was in great paryll of deathe, his susters, for the familiaritie which they had with Iesus, sent worde vnto him, how his freend Lazarus was sore sycke, they nothing doubting, but that he of his wonderful humanitie whyche he bare towardes al men, wold helpe his freend being in such daūger. Lo, say they, he whom thou louest is sycke. They thought it ynough only to gyue hym knowlege of his freendes sickenes, and therfor they adde no praiers to desyre his helpe. To whom Iesus ma keth answere in this wise. Ueryly this syckenes is not deadly, but it is therfore chaūced vnto him, that by occasiō therof gods glory might be set out, to the intēt that whā by his vertue the disease shal be driue awey, the sōne of god might also be glorified. A like answere did Chryste make to hys disciples of him y•

I wold not (brethrē) haue you ignorant as concerning them which be fallen a slepe, that ye mourne not as the rest of mē do, which haue no hope. For if we beleue, that Iesus dyed and rose againe: euen so wil god bring againe with him them also which slepe by Iesus.
            But Christes disciples beyng troubled with feare & suspecting that Iesus spake not of the bodily death in dede which after a new maner of speaking he called a slepe, but rather of the common maner of sleping, answered and said. Lord if he slepe, he shall do well ynoughe. Uerily the disciples were yet styll afrayd to resort agayne to Iurye & therfore asmuche as they coulde, they cut of the causes of goyng thither.

But Iesus by litle & litle prepared their myndes to the beholdyng of the miracle which he wolde shewe. For first of all he had rather calle him a slepe than dead, that according to the maner of holy scrip ture he myghte shewe the hope of resurrection. For they slepe, rather then be dead, which lye in rest, and shal liue agayn. For it is not so easy for any of vs to

But now, he being so long dead yea and buryed in hys graue, they could not make that cauillation. Christ therfore was glad for hys disciples sake, that they myghte beleue.

And Bethanye, where Lazarus & his susters dwelt, was nighe vnto Hierusalem, about. xv. furlōges of, and many of the Iues cam to Martha & Marye, to cōfort thē ouer their brother. Truly, it is the worke of charitie, to cōfort the heuy and troubled persōs, yea it is the worke of the holy ghost, and for thys cause is the holy ghost called in scripture a coūforter, bycause in aduersitie he cōforteth the beleuers & feithful christen ꝑsons.

Martha assone as she herde that Iesus was commyng, went and met him, but Mary sate styl in the howse. Martha therfore so sone as she cam into Iesus sight, sayd vnto him. Lord if thou haddest bene here, my brother had not dyed. But now I knowe, that what soeuer thou askest of god: god wol surely giue it the. Uerily this Martha beleued in ChristeChryso stom. but not as it behoued her to beleue. For she knewe not yet that he was god▪ & that he wrought hys miracles by his owne propre power and vertue as appeareth by that she putteth to, but now also I know that whatsoeuer thou askest of god, he woll gyue it the. So that she toke Christ but for a prophete and a very vertuouse and holy man. Christ therfore answereth her. Thy brother shal rise agayne. I wote, ꝙ Martha, that he shall rise againe in the resurrection at the last day. Here we se that Martha was a good woman and beleued the general resurrection. Wherfore our sauiour Christ to thintent he myght yet augment the womans feith & opinion in him, & that he might declare that he coulde not only as an holy man & prophet obteyne of god life to the dead, but also that he himself is the fountaigne and giuer of life to al men, and that no death is to be feared of them which put their trust and hope in him, bicause that although death cōmeth yet it can not hurt him that beleueth on him which is fountaigne of al life, he answered Martha in thys wyse. I am the resurrectionFgo sū resurrectio et vita. and the lyfe. Ueryly my freendes this is the gospel▪ this is the Euangel, this is the glad & ioyful tydinges most pleasaunt & cōfortable to al Christen men and women. In this word Christ openeth himselfe

vnto vs, & giueth vs resurrection & life which be the greatest & best gyftes that cā be giuen to mā
               kynd. But wherby is Christe made vnto vs our resurrectiō and our lyfe? Uerily by feith. And therfore he goeth further and sayth. He that beleueth in me, althoughe he be deade, yet shall he lyue. By feith doubtles the deade man liueth, & by feith the quicke mā neuer dyeth. For ye may not thinke, that Christ spake this only of Lazarus. But who so euer he be that beleueth, and hath the lyuely & vnfeyned feith in Christ which in the begynnyng of this sermon▪ I spake of, he shall neuer dye, albeit that the bodye for a tyme shall slepe. This I say is the Gospell, wherwith in the straightes of deth ours cōsciencies must be fensed and made stronge agaynst al the gates of hell and of death. For agaynst this sure feith, thysMat. 16. rocke, wherupon Christes church is buylt, not al the gates of hell (as Christ himselfe promiseth) can preuaile. And to thintent we shulde beleue this the better that Christe is oure resurrection, he confirmed it with the raisyng of Lazarus frō death to life, he cō
               firmed it also with hys owne resurrection. Why do we then mourne the deth of oure freendes? Harken what Christ sayth. I am the resurrection. What do we fear thingꝭ we wote not what in an other world? Let vs beleue in Christ which saith. I am the lyfe. Truly he giueth himselfe hole vnto vs by this gospell, only let vs take hede lest by our vnfeithfulnes we put frō vs so highe & excellent a gyfte. If Christ had neuer been made man: we could haue hoped of no risyng agayne. By our first father Adā we were al made thral vnto death, accordyng to gods worde

in Genesis vnto Adā. What day so euer thou shaltGen. ij. eate of the tree of knowlege of good and euill, thou shalt surely dye a death. By Adam verily as witnesseth saynt Paule death entred first, and agayne by Christe cam resurrection and lyfe. Wherfore truly these wordes of our Sauiour Christe haue a ryght great comforte in them vnto all christen men, forasmuch as they declare moost high vertue and power to be in Christe▪ that is to witte, that by hym chaunceth to mākind the vertue and power to rise againe into euerlastyng lyfe. Both the good and bad shall ryse againe, but not a like, for the good shal rise vntoTo whō Christe is a resurrection. life▪ and the badde shal rise vnto iugement and euerlasting death, and therfore Christe to them is no resurrection. For whiche they be that shalbe made pertakers of euerlastynge lyfe, he sheweth when he goeth on and sayeth in thys wyse. He that beleueth in me, shal lyue, that is to say, he shall not dye the second death. We haue therfore (good people) two manerstwo sortes of resurrection. of risynge agayne, for first we rise agayne here by grace, out of the doungeon of synne, when we 
                  •
               e renewed into a new life, and be regenerate by Christ as it is declared in the thyrde chapter of Ihon. AndIhon. 3. who soeuer after thys sorte doth ryse agayne out of synne here in thys lyfe▪ shall neuer tast of the second death, which is euerlastyng damnation, but shalbe pertaker of the seconde resurrection through Christ at the day of iugemēt, which shalbe lyfe euerlasting and endles ioye. Thys in effecte were Christes wordes to Martha, and after he had thus opened hymself vnto her, he asked her whether she beleued this? Wherunto she answered and said. Yea Lorde I beleue

that thou art Christe the sonne of God, whiche hast come into the worlde. Uerily thys confession of feith that this blessed woman Martha maketh here of Christe, semeth to be lyke vnto that, whiche saynt Peter and the rest of thapostles made, when Christ asked them, whom they said that he was, and saynt Peter in al their names answered. Thou art ChristMat. 16 Mat. 8. Luc. ix. the sonne of the liuyng god, that is to say, thou arte the Messias or Sauiour of the worlde whiche was so long before promised by the prophetes and loked for of the fathers. And lyke as fleshe and bloud disclosed not thys feith to saynt Peter, but the heuenly father: so thys lyke confession that Martha made, ꝓceded not of any carnal loue, but of the holy ghost But what do these wordes betokē, thou art Christ? Uerily to be Christ, is to be the lorde and cōquerour☜ ouer synne, afflictions, death and helle. And for this cause was he promised, euen to vanquish al the aduerse powers in heuēly thyngꝭ. I say he is that sede of the woman which shulde breake the serpētes hed, that is to wit, the power of the deuill. For the deuillGen. 3. ruleth in the worlde through Gods permission and sufferaunce by synne, afflictions, death, and helle.
