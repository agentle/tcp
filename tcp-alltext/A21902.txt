               THe Queenes moſt excellent Maieſtie being informed of the reſort of a greater number of perſons to her Towne and Caſtle of Windſor, and other places adioining, then are conuenient, and that are not ordinarie ſeruants to attend on her Maieſtie in the Court, nor doe belong to her Counſailors or other her principall officers attending on her Maieſties perſon, whereof by late view taken both by the officers of the Towne, and by her Harbingers, there appeareth great diſorder, in that a great number of owners of houſes doe lodge a multitude of perſons that are not allowed by any Harbinger, and many of the ſame ſo lodged, are perſons that with their wiues, children, and ſeruants, are come from London and Weſtminſter, and other infected places, whereby great danger muſt needes follow, if remedie be not prouided very ſpeedilie: And therefore her Maieſtie hath commanded the Knight Harbinger, with other her Harbingers, and with the aſſiſtance of the ſeruants of the Knight Marſhall, and with the Maior of Windſor and other officers in the Townes adioyning, that they do cauſe a ſearch to be newly made, according as they are ordered and directed by her Maieſties priuie Counſaile, and that all perſons doe obey them in the execution of thoſe orders. And eſpecially her Maieſtie chargeth all owners of houſes in the ſaid Townes of Windſor, Eaton, and the Townes adioyning within fiue miles of her Caſtle, that within two dayes after publication thereof at the Market croſſe in Windſor, they doe exclude all perſons that ſhall not be allowed by the ſaid Harbinger to haue lodging, vpon paine of impriſonment, and ſhutting vp of their houſes, and ſuch fine as ſhalbe impoſed vpon them for the breach of this her Maieſties commandement. Finally, her Maieſtie chargeth all perſons that ſhall not be warranted by the Harbingers Billets to haue lodging, that they do depart from the Court, and from fiue miles neere the Court, within two daies after the publication hereof, vpon paine of impriſonment and fine alſo for their contempt. And that none which are not allowed to come within the Caſtle, but ſhall come vpon pretence of anie ſuites, ſhal not enter vntill they ſhall firſt declare their names and places from whence they doe come, to ſome of her Maieſties porters, and vpon report to be made by them to ſome one of her Maieſties priuie Counſell, and vpon receit of a Billet from any of the Counſaile, or from any one of the Maſters of the Requeſts in writing, to licence ſuch ſuter to come into the Caſtle, in ſuch maner, and with ſuch ſeruants as the neceſſitie of the ſuite, and the condition of the ſuiter ſhall require, or otherwiſe not to be permitted to enter within the gates of the Court, nor after his ſuite ended to continue in the Court, vpon paine of impriſonment, and of her Maieſties indignation. Giuen at the Caſtle of Windſor, the fifteene day of September in the xxxv. yeere of her Maieſties raigne.
            God ſaue the Queene.
