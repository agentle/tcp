the stede of circuncision:Our Sacramēts ar not blodye / as wer the olde. euē so doth the
lordis souper folowe in the place of the

was shed / bothe in the of kutting of
the foreskyn of the chyldes preuey member / 
and also in the slaying of the passh
lombe with whose blode the doors and
wyndows wer strykē and crossed. Also
as by Baptyme we be iniciated / we professe / 
and be cōseigned vnto the worship
of one God / into the faith of one & the
same Christen religion / euē so by the same

faithe and loue expressed at the lordis
souper / we declare our selues to perseuer
in our profession / now incorporated
into Christ as the very members of
yt mystik bodye whereof Christ is onely
the head. By the circuncision and the
passouer eting / God marked and sealled
to hym the Iewes. By baptyme &

And the inwarde wasshing of
the soule with the spirituall water called
the holy gost. Of the first baptyme / 
it is wryten Matth. the last. Go your
wayes & teche all maner nacions / baptyzinge
them into the name of the father / 
of the sone / and holy gost. Of the
seconde and inwarde bapty.The inwarde bapt. which stondeth
vpon faith in beleuing the wordis
of promyse. It is wryten Mar. the last.

Whoso beleue and be baptyzed / shalbe
saued. Of this inwarde spirituall bapt.
called the regeneracion frome aboue of

the .i. cap. of his gospell / and in .i. Io. v.
saying / Euery man that beleueth Iesus
to be Christ / is borne of God. The first
baptyme may be withoute the seconde /

The first bapt. with water representeth

to cōuaye the spirituall thingis signifyed

by them into our hertis & soulis.The exteriour bapt. brī
                  geth in the inwarde.
As did the circūcision of the flesshe bring

It is promysed by Crist / That whoso

Here is a promyse of our saluacion / not
for because we be baptized with water / 
for then shulde we be saued by the creature
of water and not by Crist: but because
we beleue the promyse of God
promysing saluacion in Cristis bloude / 
whiche beleif bringeth vs into the seconde

Rom. i. ca. that as the promyses come / 
so groweth our faithe as the mustarde

Cor. i. Syn did sette God and vs at discorde / 
The mediatour or reconcyler yt
agreeth God and man is Christ Iesus

i. Timo. ij. By faith we ar graffed into
Christ. The hyghest felicite & lyfe most
blessed / is to be ioyned for euer vnto
God the moste hyghe goodnes. Christ
is comē into y• flesshe to ioyne all faithfull
vnto the most hyghe god. wherfore
he is come to geue vs this most ioyouse
felicite. The some of the hole gospell / lawe
& prophetis consisteth in this.The some of the lawe prophetis & gospell. That
God the father hath restored his faithfull
vnto lyfe by his sone Christ / in whō
he hath ioyned and knyt vs vnto hym / 
that with hym / & for his sake only / we
might be partakers of all thing yt good is.
In this some stondeth forth all our
saluacion before our eyes in euery fygure / 
ceremonye / sacrament / and in euery
parte of the scripture / but yet diuerse
wayes / nowe here in playne and aperte
wordis / and there eftsone wrapped and
kouered vnder figures and sweet similitudes.
In playne wordis / as in Io. his
first ca. of his .i. epistle and of his gospell
saying / and that worde was made mā / 
and dwelt in vs / also that our felowship
might be with the father and with his

sone Iesu Crist. i. Io. i. That thei might
be one also as ar we / saith Crist to his

holy father / saith Crist / now I praye y• /
not onely for theis my apostels / but also
for all them that ar to beleue in me thorow

is brede takē for meat and for almaner
bodely sustinance / In the persone of

Crist / where the godhed is inseperably
knit to his manhed / it is attributed to
the manhed that whiche verely pertayneth
to the godhed as in Io. iij. Noman
ascendeth into heuen but he that is descended / 
the sonne of man which is in heuen / 
here the sonne of man is taken for
thegod hed / for as yet / when he spake
these wordis / his manhed was not ascended / 
The scripture saith Crist dyed / 
when it was his manhed onely that suffered.
Now to my purpose. In the signes
or sacraments ther ar many thingis
inseperably ioyned togither / yf thei
be of Cristis ordināce / as ye se in this diuisiō
& order folowing / wherfore euery
one is called by the same name / yt the tother
is called / which sodē sondrely attributing
of the same name & subsultatory
speche not knowne nor obserued / make
men to apere to speke strangely / yea erroneously
to some mē / when thei bothe
beleue and speke trwly and godlye.
         
         
            ¶In Baptime.
            1 The Element is—water.
            2 The worde of institution / is / Go

your wayes and teche all nacions baptizing
them into y• name of the father the
sone and holy goste / Mat. xxviij. which
wordes with the Element / make the
Sacrament.
            3 The worde of promyse / is Mar. the
last ca. Whoso beleueth and is baptized
shalbe saued. Faith in this promise
maketh present the holy gost in
ye beleuers hert now borne a newe.
            4 The thing / is the holy gost making
holy / purifying & renewing ye soule.
         
         
            ¶In the Souper of the Lorde.
            1 The Elemēts ar—Brede & wyne.
            2 The wordis of institucion / ar these / 
When Iesus had soupt / he toke y• brede
in his handis &c.ma
                     •
                  . xxv which wordis dewly
spoken / it is the Sacrament.
            3 The wordis of promyse / ar these / 
Whoso eteth my flessh and drinketh
my blode / dwelleth in me and I in
hym / Io. vi. The beleif in this promyse
bringeth the thing present into
the herte of the faithfull receyuer
of the sacrament.
            4 The thing is the bodye of Crist crucifyed / 

and his bloude shed into the remission
of thy synnes.
            Nowe ar these speches trewe. The
sacrament of baptime is the regeneracion
and the renouaciō of the holygost / 
purifying and 
                  •
               euing saluation / so that
it be attributed vnto the cheif thing in
the sacrament / which is the holy gost.
            Lykewyse yf it be asked / whether in
the sacrament of the souper of y• Lorde
there be the very naturall and reall bodye
of Crist / thou seest it the fowerth in
order / and is so called / for the inseperable
vnion of it with y• sacramēt / wordis
and element / so that the brede is so called / 
the worde is so called / and y• thing
it self / must nedis be called the same that
it is. The brede and the worde / ar so called
sacramētally: but the thing is so called
verely really and naturallye.
            And here is offered the questiō / whether
an infidele or an vnworthey wyked
persone eteth the body & drinketh
the bloud of Crist at the souper?Infidels receyue the sacrament but not the thing. Unto
the whiche Austen answereth very wel
in his .xxi. boke of the cetye of God / putting

difference betwixt the sacrament
which standeth vpō the Elements and
wordis of instituciō / & betwixt ye thing
which stōdeth in the wordis of promyse
and faith ther to ioyned. And agene in
a sermone of the sacramēts of the faithfull.
These ar his wordis. He that dwelleth
not in Crist / nor Crist in hym / dowtlesse
he nether eteth his flesshe nor drinketh
his blode / albeit vnto his own condemnacion / 
he eteth and drinketh the
sacrament of so grete a thinge. Here ye
se that one maye receyue the elements
as the brede and wyne & not the thing.
As was Symon Magus baptyzed in
water / receyuing the sacrament / & yet
not the holygost renewing hym. And
Iudas sitting at this souper / did eat the
sacrament of the brede & wyne / but not
y• thing / for satan (saith Io. xiij.) entred
into hym aftir Crist had raught hym
the morsell of brede.
         
         
            ¶What it is / worthely or onworthely
to receyue the sacrament.
            FIrst ye shal knowe that there cometh
no frute vnto any receyuers

of any sacrament / but onely vnto
them / that call into mynde the deth of
Crist with holy & deuoute remembrance / 
yt he was crucifyed for their synnes
& wassheth them awaye wt his blode / geuing
hym thākis immortal / hygh prayse
& glorye in this sweet remembrance
and faith. Onely vnto siche men Crist
commendeth and hathe committed his
body. Onely vnto these mē he draweth
forth his blode / For these mē onely was
he offred vp on the altar of y• crosse. So
that they doutelesse slip from y• trwth / 
that beleue Iudas to haue had receyued
the same thing that the other apostles
receyued. For they eat not verely y•
flesshe of the Lorde / which in hym dwel
not nor he in them / for Io. euangelist
euen the next gest at Cristis elbowe sitting
at his messe testifyeth that assone
as Iudas had receyued ye soppe / the deuill
entred into hym for his gest into his
soule.Io. xiij. Item yong infantes and men bestraught / 
albeit they be the membres of
Crist / yet may they not wt frute receyue
it / for these persones may not rightly remember

the mystery of their redēption / 
nor dewly examyn & proue themselues
before / nor geue thākis therfore / which
thinges ar cheifely required at the cebracion
of this holy fea
                  •
               te.
            Paule biddeth euery mā proue / trye / 
inserche / and examyn hym self before he
eateth of this brede and drinke of this
cuppe:i. cor. xi. Of the prouing of our selues.
for yf we had trwly examined
our selues we shuld not haue had ben so
punisshed of the Lorde. Whose mynde
is that they ar with out perell that descende
into their owne selues / and with
grete detestacion of their synnes desyer
to be the same that they heare / that is
to saye the mēbers of ye bodye of Crist.
Nether vnaptely is this probacion of
our selues called the parte of the commemoracion / 
when there can be no commemoracion
with out the iuste probacion
of our selues.
            First therfore let vs examyn our selues
by y• twyche stone &Iaco. squyer of goddis
commandements / which as a glasse
shall shewe vs to our selues to be nothing
els in all our dedis lyfe wordis &

thoughtes but greuouse sinners / Then
let vs trye our selues whether for our
synnes we be sory in herte & vnfaynedly
repentāt / ful minded to practize our baptyme
in mortifying our affectes changing
our lyfe by faith burying our synnes
in Cristes woundis / with hym to
ryse agene into a new state of lyuing / 
Let vs trye our selues to knowe vnder
what degre of y• lawe we be / as it is before
expressed. Serche whether yu beist
as glad to forgeue all y• haue hurte the / 
euen as thou woldist be forgeuē of god?
Loke whether yu canst espye thy nowne
secrete birthe poyson and loue to thy self
sought in all thy dedis thoughtes a
                  •
               d
wordis rather then the glory of God
& profyt or edifying of thy neighbour?
And nowe se whether thou haste / or desyerst
to haue that faith and loue / which
God commandeth the to haue to hym
and to thy neighbour / & be heuye that
thou hast them not in yt perfecciō wherein
thou arte bownde to haue them / that
pacience / confidence / constancye / humilite / 
temperance / chastite and a wyll in

all thingis cōformable vnto goddis wil.
and yf yu aknowlegest theis thy nowne
synnes & imperfeccion vnfaynedly / yet
art thou a membyr of the body of Crist / 
as writeth Paule / and mayst sit downe
with fere and reuerence / i. Cor. x. geuing thākis
to God for this inestimable benefyt of
our redempcion. But this iuste probacion
as our papistis neuer practyzed it in
themselues / so neuer yet taught it they
their flockes.
            Whylis we therfore thus expende &
proue our selues / consydering: who we
were by Adams fall / from what perellis
and euillis we ar by Crist delyuered
vndeserued of vs / what gyftis ar geuē
vs vnloked fore / & agene what we professed
at our baptisme / into whose disciplyne
we entred / what bataile we toke
in hāde vnto what a capitayne & heerd
man by it we were conseigned & anoynted / 
called Cristiās of the name of Crist
vnto whom we were professed and our
selues yielded / and yet / in all this probacion
and rememberance of our selues / &
of our benefitis by Crist: we must apere

to our selues insufficient / & vnworthely
with condigne thankis to haue remembred
and beleued all these benefyts: and
we therfore in our selues euer to confesse
vs vnworthy wt the Centurion that
Crist shuld entre into our houses.mat. viij But
be it in case we might / wt any vtwarde
fayned probaciō deceyue all men / before
whom we testifye our indignite and declare
our faith / yet cānot he be deceyued
which onely sercheth & inseeth hertes
and raynes / whiche also is the mynde
and spirit of that bodye which is compacte
and framed of the congregaciō of
all faithfull men.
            Also as the Apostle warneth vs to
mortifye our bodyes / Ro. vi. to be buryed and
to ryse with Crist / so exhorteth he vs to
not suffer synne to raigne in vs.i. cor. v. Act. xv. He commandeth
vs to purge and to make vs
clene from that olde leuayne / and to be
purifyed by faith. But verely full colde
and vngodly is the probaciō that dependeth
of mennis lawes and decrees: 
                  •
               ith
he saith. They ought not to be rekened
well proued which cōmende and prayse

themselues / but thei whom the lorde cō
               mēdeth:ij. cor. x.
which cōmendeth non but siche
as allowe & approue his will / known by
y• scriptures. Let not therfore this saying
of Dauid neuer go from thy mynde
Blessed is y• mā whom yu techest o Lorde:Psa. xciij
& oute of thy lawe enstructest hym.
            And yet albeit yt in these men whiche
thus proue themselues & so eat worthely
there is cōtinual batail wt syn / which
they here aboute in their bosoms / yet
eteth he not vnworthely / which takē &
holden with the spirit of penance endeuowreth
& aspyreth vnto this one thīg / 
That as he is dede with Crist from syn / 
euen so / as I sayd before / he stryueth to
aryse agene with hym into a newe lyfe / 
not yielding hymself to syn any more to
haue dominion ouer hym / but ouercometh
thinfirmite of his flessh with the
vertewe & power of the spirituall lawe
that mortifyeth affectes.Iob. vij. For a Cristiās
lyfe is a continuall bataile.
            And as it is a gloriouse thīg / to fight
& haue victory / euē so to be ouercome / it
is not onely shame in the tentes of the

Cristen felde / but also dethe and dampnacion.
Wherfore the flesshe and bloude
of Crist euē for this cause specially ar asked
at the Lordis table of them that ar
faithfull / that as waryers and soldiers
ar fed and anoynted with oyle / euen so
ar Cristis waryers fed & strengthened
with the excellent vertewe of the sacraments / 
that they might continewe and
be strong in batail / and resist the engins
of temptacions / Ro. viij. so that ther be no condemnacion
vnto them that ar graffed
into Crist Iesu: albeit there be syn / but
not imputed for their faithes sake.
            But now as faith is the fowndacion
of all our rightwysnes and well doyng / 
                  
                     •
                  aith is the fown daciō of this prouing.
euen so is it the grownde of our probacion:
for who is it that hateth the dominion
of syn / or syn it self hauing the dominion
ouer hym / and want the faith?
or who can decerne or make difference
of the body of Crist / that is to say / examyn
and proue hymself / whether hym
self be of the body of Crist / To make differēce of the lordis body and the trwe
intiere hole mēber of his chirche / which
ether know not Cristis lawe or institution / 

or wil reiecte it? Wherfore the trw
prechers teche that nether our lippes / 
ar to be prepared / nor mouthes and gomes
to be wasshed / that we might worthely
receyue it / & miche lesse gloriouse
& costly aparel / choise of day / nor nowm
bir to be sought for it / nether to attribute
any thīg to our selues for our own
worthey preparingis / by confessions auriculare / 
penance enioyned / satisfacciōs
or other good merits. For Crist did not
institute this table for men filled wt workis
& trust in their owne merits / but for
men fasting / Fasting men who they be. yt is to saye / of faith humbled / 
contrite / afflicte in spirit / nothing
ascribīg to their owneselues / Thei hunger
not for Crist yt ar full with in their
owne iugement / nomore then they admit
& receyue y• phisiciō that apere hole
in themselues. But it behoueth here to
remember the reiecte pharisay puftvp
with the bosting of his owne workis / &
y• receyued publicane cōfessing his own
synnes.who proue not themselues a right. And in fewe wordis they proue
not themselues a right which make clene
the vtwarde syde of the disshe / the insyde

alfowle: when in the onely mynde
& herte / ether pure or vnpure / clene or
fowle / it stondeth / whether we receyue
the sacramēt worthely or vnworthely.
            Furthermore / as Iohn to witnes
there is noman without syn / so is there
some synne vnto deth:i. Io. i. i. Io. v. & some not vnto
deth / They syn vnto deth / that obstinately
perseuer in open crymes / wetingly
or els of an affected ignorance impugning
the trwth / neuer examining nor
prouīg themselues tryed at the worde
of god / which eting this holy souper eat
& drinke their owne condemnaciō.i. cor. xi. Two maner of vnworthy eaters: bothe punisshed but not a lyke. But
the other that syn not vnto deth beyng
penitent / albeit they be negligent in the
prouing of themselues by the reason of
the frayltye of their flesshe and of some
ignorāce / for whom we & they ought to
praye / yet for their indignite ar siche tryed
& punisshed of the Lorde vnto their
own correcciō lest they be cōdemned wt
the worlde / when the indignite of the
first that syn vnto dethe asketh deth perpetuall
& condemnaciō / where ye se the
gylte of the ether vnworthey is vnlyke / 

which cometh of the abuse of the sacramēt:
For vnto y• one vnworthey parte / 
the faulte & gylte bringeth cōdemnaciō / 
& to the tother it bringeth but transitory
punisshment for their correccion. For
the Apostle techethe that at Corinthe
there were many beleuers yt were plaged
with trāsitory paynes for that thei
behaued themselues at this holy souper
negligētlyer then y• dignite of the thīg
requyred / & therfore were they smyten
not onely with deceases / but also with
deth temporal / that other lyke rasshe &
negligent vnworthey eaters fered at
their ensample shuld be ware & admonisshed.
For euen sodē dethe is a payne insticte
for syn / Act .v. For in yt the Apostle
sayd: Many sleape / we vnderstāde that
siche punisshed persons shuld lyue agene
in ioye. for the scripture saithe them to
sleap which shal ryse into glory / & therfore
he saith playnly that they ar corrected
of the Lorde lest they shuldbe condempned
wt the worlde. Of whose sorte
doutelesse were they whom the Apostle
rebuketh / partely because the congregacion

of the pore / not taryed for / they did
eate the souper / as thoughe it had ben
theirowne priuate souper: so that they
excedinge with a certayn excesse and superfluite / 
sought y• meat of theirowne
bellyes rather then the meat of their
mynde / nothing regarding the nede &
pouertye of their owne members: And
partely because they were puftvp with
a certayne suppinite / sloughissh ease and
idlenes / mixing themselues withe the
haithen idollaters of their owne cyte / i. cor. viij & .x.
eating & drinking with them at their tables
before their idols / not remembring
the sclawnder geuen to their weker brethern
redemed with Cristes blode.
            Sewerly their offences might haue
semed but lyght / to themselues which
had knowledge / as it were in thīges of
themselues not hurtfull / & might apere
in sight not vnlawful / but indifferēt / as
some of our ceremonyes apere to some
men this daye: But yet dothe saynt
Paule prosecute & note them with siche
ernest grauite / yt not onely the self souper
but also y• mystery therof / he so layth

it before our eyes / that he affirmeth / by
siche offences / we prouoke the wrath of
God vpon vs: & that he wolde therby so
warne vs (bothe the excellēcye of the sacrament
& also the dignite therof so requyring)
that we shuld haue this circū
               speccion
/ euen in euery acte of our lyfe &
ryte to holde & kepe our selues wysely
with oute all maner offendicle / within
the limites of mesure and disciplyne.
            When the congregacion therfore admit
not vnto this souper open criminouse
persons except thei espye some euidēt
tokens of repentance / they do it aftyr
thensample of Paule / i. cor. v. delyuerīg vp vnto

defyled his owne stepe mother.Of the vnworthey receyuers So yt it
folowth yet / that of these men the brede
& wyne is receyued most vnworthely / 
which albeit thei be not openly knowne
of the congregaciō / yet vnto dethe & to
their owne damnaciō may thei eat and
drinke it for their own hid obstinate perseuerāce
in syn wherby thei ar excluded
from y• heretage of heuē / Of the which
sorte ar thei that for fere of shame / for lucre

& aduauntage fayne themselues of
Cristes religion & of the gospell / as did
Symon Magus pryse the powr of god
to do miracles yt he might be the more
estemed emōg his owne facciō.Act. viij. Beware papistes wherefore ye make your selues preisstes. Or siche
as for fauour or aduauntage to be estemed
& retayned / dissemble their vngodlynes
cloked with holy orders succession
of apostles with apostleship & bisshopryk
as did Iudas the betrayer / whiche although
he had made a bargayn with y•
pharisais agreed bothe of the pryce of
Crist & Cristians to be solde / yet he retourned
vnto the same messe at the Lordis
table to be partaker with his disciples
of the same sacrament. At this messe
with Iudas sitte they or stāde / all hipocrytes
pharisayes / papistes / simoniaks / 
filthey concubyne kepers / aduouterers / 
prowd prelats / dronkerds / deuowerers

that at their master Crist taught

altere his ordināce / as did certayn men
in his tyme / put onely water into the

Those men to

may not suffer it to be altered of men by

Those men to eate worthely that proue
and examyn themselues shewing playnly
that the well of all indignite and vnworthynes
depēdeth of the mynde and
not of the exteriour & vtwarde signes.The vnworthynes cometh out of the mynde.
And playn it is al thingis to be pure vnto
the pure / but to the polluted and infedels
there is nothing pure / because their
mynde is polluted.Tit. i. And Crist saith / 
That at entreth into the mouthe defyeleth
not the man / but that at gothe out
of the mouthe vnpureth hym.Mat. xv. Which
thing a non he expowning saith / yet vnderstād
ye not / that whatsoeuer gothe
into the mouthe descēdeth into the bellye
& is caste into the sege? But the thingis
y• goforth of the mouthe come from
the herte &c. playnly teching / the wiked
and corrupt minde to be the fowntayne

of all impurite. But contrary wyse we
rede / that to the mynde enstructe with
faith and knowledge of the doctryne of
Crist these thingis ar pure / whiche to

vnpure.Ro. xiiij In wyne there is no fawte of
drunkenes / as nether in meates there
is no fawte of surfaiting / but the minde
seking tomich hirown plesure in eating

wherfore the interiour thīgis purged /

                it / but the fowntayn
of euill was the venome cast of the serpent
into their myndes / and therefore
from thense came the euil / from whence
came the venome. yea the set mynde to
violate the lawe of God made them giltye
of dethe ere he did byght or taste of
the appul. For it cannot be but noysome
and pestelent what so euer owr mynde
enbrace at the perswasion of the deuill.
The morsell of brede was venome and
poyson vnto Iudas saith Austen / not
that the brede in it self was venome or

hurtful / but because he hymself being
euill / wykedly vsed so
grete and holy a
sacrament.
