            To the most gentle and
godly disposed childe, M. Thomas
Cecill, sonne to the right honourable Syr Williā
Cecill Knight, and Secretary to the Kings
Maiestie, Thomas Becon wisheth
the fauour of God, with the
encrease of vertue and
learning.
            
               II of holy letters we be
not sleepie nor vaine readers,
but diligētly marke what we
read, we shall easilie perceaue
that among other commaundementes
of God, this is not
the last nor the least, which he geueth cōcerning
the bringing vp of youth in y• knowledge
of his blessed will. For y• godly wisedome
knoweth right well, that except the
younglinges of a common weale be vertuously
brought vp, and faithfully framed, according
to the right rule of Gods holy appointment,
it can not come to passe, but that
his glory (the good parentes being once
deceased) must needes bee obscured in thys
world, the inuocation of his name cease, and
all godly religion decay: yea the men them
selues (if they bee worthy that name) must
needes become brutelike, and be caryed about
with euery straunge doctrine, cōtemne
all laudable lawes, breake all good orders,
follow their fleshly appetites lyke vnreasonable

beastes, & so at last bring both thēselues
& their realmes vnto vtter destruction.
            Therfore as God in his holy law requireth
of parentes nothing more earnestly thē
to bring vp their children vertuously, and
according to his word: so likewise all godly
fathers and mothers, haue euer from the
beginning done their vttermost endeuour
to traine vp their younglinges, euen from
the very cradells, in the nurture, feare, and
doctrine of the Lord, supposing them selues
then best to please God, and most to doe the
true office of godly and naturall parentes,
when they studie how to garnish, not theyr
childrens bodies with gay and sumptuous
vestures, but their mindes with noble and
precious vertues, not bow to lift them vp
to transitory dignities & worldly honours,
which as dayly experiēce teacheth, are more
brittle then glasse, and fade away lyke the
grasse, but how to make them honourable
and prayse worthy in the sight of good mē,
and profitable to the cōmon weale, through
vertue, learning, wisedome, and counsell.
And the more the parentes them selues did
excell other in knowledge, wisedome, and
learning, the greater desire had they to bring
their children vnto the lyke perfection, bearing
heauily, that theirs shoulde in any
poynt degenerate from their fathers vertues,
and not orderly aunswere to the godly
qualities of their noble parentes. Histories

both godly and Ethnicke, doe minister
vnto vs examples aboundantly in this
behalfe, which I would here gladly recite,
if I had not attempted the lyke enterprise
already in my preface to the Gouernance of
Vertue. Againe, if I were not fully perswaded,
that you haue heretofore both red and
also heard of your teacher the same, or els
the like histories.
            Your right honourable and most worthy
father, knowing the good pleasure of
God in thys behalfe, hath also after the example
of all other noble & godly parentes,
painfully trauailed, both by him self and by
learned teachers, to bring you vp, euen frō
your cradell, in the knowledge of Gods
will, and of good letters, that you might, as
in age, so likewise in vertue and learning,
grow and encrease vnto hys comfort, vnto
your owne commendation, & vnto the profite
of the common weale hereafter. And as
your father is learned, and hath a brest stuffed
with all godly vertues, so is hys desire
to haue you both learned & vertuous, that
when he shall geue ouer to nature (God so
disposing) hee may leaue behinde hym hys
owne image, yea, as I may so speake, hym
selfe, not onely in lineamentes of body, but
also in vertue, in godlines, in wisedome, in
knowledge, and by thys meanes bee counted
of hys posteritie, a worthy member of
the common weale, both in him selfe and 
                  〈◊〉
               
               
hys sonne. It is your dutie therfore to satisfie
the good desire of so naturall a father,
and to aunswere the expectation of many,
which looke to finde in you hereafter, that
vertue, learning, wisedome, and grauitie,
that is euidently perceaued in your most
worthy father. Thys shall bee brought to
passe, if according to your beginning ye goe
forth diligently to call on the name of God,
to applie your mind to good letters, to giue
eare to the wholsome admonicions of your
most deare father, and to take heede to the
daily exhortations of your teacher, euer framyng
your life according to your knowledge.
And that ye may do this the more cō
               ueniently,
I geue you thys little treatise,
which shall aboundauntly instructe you in
those pointes of Christian Religion, which
at thys present do most of all become your
age. In it are cōtained the principles of our
profession, which I haue so opened with the
conference of the other scriptures, that they
may worthily seeme to striue with large
Cōmentaries: I haue also set forth the duties
of all estates and degrees, as they bee

                  •
               aught in Gods word, that all ages, and all
kindes of people, may here learne to know
their dutie, both toward God & hys neighbour.
Neyther is any thyng taught in thys
treatise, that is not sufficiently fortressed
with the authorities of the holy scriptures:
so that I doubt not, but the godly learned

which loue to heare the voyce of their shepheard
Christ, wil not disallow this my diligence.
Let other intreate of hie misteries, &
clime vp to the hiest heauen, I shall be content
to write of thinges according to my
knowledge, and your capacitie, & to creepe
vpon the ground. Let other talke of the vnknowen
secretes of the blessed trinitie, of
predestination, of the state of the soules departed.
&c. I will speake of the Articles of
the Christian 
                  •
               ayth, of the Lordes prayer, of
the x. Cōmaundementes, of the Sacramēts
of Christes church. &c. Let other be counted
y• flowers of learning, for opening, I know
not how secrete mysteries, I force not to be
called vnlearned, so y• I may know Christ
crucified, and in teaching him, eyther by my
writinges or sermons, winne some vnto
God. But to end, embrace vertue, loue learning,
garnish your brest with the fruites of
Gods spirite, be not idle, flie vaine and too
much childishe pastimes, spend your tyme
fruitfully, exercise your self in reading gods
worde: so shall God blesse you, multiplie
your yeares on earth, and geue you
ioyfull dayes, vnto the great comfort
of your self, and the singular
ioy of your honourable
parentes, whō with you
I wishe alway prosperously
to do.

               Of Fayth.
               
                  What fayth is.
                  
                     FAith is a sure perswasion
and an vndoubted
beliefe of ye hart, in the
mercifull promises of
God made to all faythfull
penitent sinners in Christes
bloud, and frely performed of God
the father for Christes sake.
               
               
                  What benefites we receaue of God
through fayth.
                  By fayth,Eph. ij. we which afore by nature were the
children of wrath, are made the sonnes and
children of God.
                  ☜Probations out of the holy Scriptures.
                  As many as receaued hym,Iohn. j. to thē
gaue he power to be made y• sōnes
of God, euen thē y• beleued on hys
name, which were borne, not of
bloud, nor of the will of y• flesh, nor
yet of the will of mā, but of God.
                  
                     
All ye are y• sōnes of God,Gal. iij. because
ye haue beleued on Christ Iesu.
                  By fayth we which afore were sinners,Rom. iiij. are
iustified and counted righteous in the sight
of God for Christes sake.
                  ☜Probations out of the holy Scriptures.
                  We plainly affirme,Rom. iij. that a man
is iustified by fayth, without the
workes of the law.
                  We being iustified by fayth,Rom. v. haue
peace toward God through our
Lord Iesu Christ.
                  We know that a man is not iustified
by the deedes of the law,Gal. ij. but
by the fayth of Iesus Christ, & we
haue beleued on Iesu Christ, that
we might be 
                        •
                     ustified by the fayth
of Christ, & not by the dedes of the
lawe, because by the deedes of the
law, no flesh shall be iustified.
                  As many of you as are iustified
by the law,Gal. v. are fallen from grace.
We looke and hope for, in the spirite
to bee iustified through fayth.

For in Ies
                        •
                      Christ, neither is circumcision
any thyng worth, neyther
yet vncircumcision, but fayth,
which worketh by loue.
                  By fayth we are maryed vnto Christ.
                  ☜Probations out of the holy Scriptures.
                  I will mary thee vnto my self in
fayth,Ose. ij. & thou shalt know the Lord.
                  Fayth is the wedding garment
wherewith wee bee maried vnto
Christ,Math. xij. according to the parable
which we read in the Gospell.
                  By fayth our prayers are accepted and heard
of God.
                  ☜Probations out of the holy Scriptures.
                  All thinges whatsoeuer ye aske
in prayer (if ye beleue) ye shall receaue
them.Mat. xxj.
                  
                  Let him that prayeth aske in
fayth,Iacob. j. and doubt not. For hee that
doubteth, is like a waue of the sea,
which is tost with the windes and
caried with violence. Neyther let
that man thinke, that hee shall receaue

any thing of the Lord.
                  By fayth Christes fulfilling of the lawe, is
counted our fulfilling.
                  ☜Probations out of the holy Scriptures.
                  Christ is the fulfilling of the law
to iustifie all that beleue.Rom. 
                           •
                        .
                  
                  Christ hath deliuered vs (hee
speaketh of the faythfull) from the
curse of the law,Gal. iij. in as much as hee
was made accursed for our sakes.
                  Be it knowen vnto you,Acte. xiij. ye men
and brethren, yt through thys man
(Christ) is preached vnto you the
forgeuenes of sinnes, and that by
hym all that beleue are iustified
from all thinges, from the which
ye could not be iustified by the law
of Moyses.
                  By fayth our workes are allowed before

                  As Moyses lifted vp the Serpent

not peris
                        •

life. For God hath so loued the
world, that hee gaue hys onely begotten
sonne, that euery one that
beleueth in hym, may not perishe,
but haue euerlasting life.
                  He that beleueth on the sonne,Iohn. v.
hath euerlasting life. But he yt beleueth
not on y• sonne, shall not see
life, but the wrath of God abydeth
on hym.
                  
                     
He that heareth my worde, and
beleueth on hym that sent me, hath
euerlasting life, and shall not come
into damnation, but is scaped frō
death vnto life.
                  This is the will of hym that

consider how vnable we be of our selues to
doe that, which the holy, righteous, & good

What shall we say?Rom. vij. is the lawe

not what sinne ment, but by the
lawe: for I had not knowen what
lust had ment, except the lawe had
said: Thou shalt not lust. But sinne
tooke an occasion by the meanes of
the commaundement, & wrought
in me all maner of concupiscence.
For without the lawe sinne was

                  Thirdly, after we haue learned our weaknes,
our wretchednes, our sinne, our wickednes,
by comparing our strength and life with
the lawe of God, which proueth vs all sinners,
and worthy of eternall damnation,
least we shoulde fall into desperation, and
so be damned, the lawe was geuen of God,
to bee a Scholemaister vnto vs to lead vs

of all the lawes of God, that we through

and hys fulfilling of the lawe, myght bee

                     The law was our Scholemaister

that fayth is come, we are no
longer vnder the Scholemaister.
For ye are all the children of God,

because ye beleue in Christ Iesu.
                     The lawe brought nothyug to
perfection,Heb. vij. but was an introduction
to a better hope, by the which

                  ¶What the Lordes Supper is.
                  THe Lordes Supper is an holy
and heauenly bancket, in
the which the faythfull Christians,
besides the corporall eating

of the bread, & the outward drinking
of the wine, do spiritually thorow
fayth, both eate the body of
Christ, and drinke his bloud, vnto
the confirmation of their fayth, the
comfort of their conscience, and the
saluation of their soules.
               
               
                  ¶To what vse Christ did institute
hys holy Supper.
                  Fyrst, to put vs in remembraunce that hys
body was broken, and hys bloud shed for
our redemption.
                  
                     ☞Probations out of the holy Scriptures.
                     The Lord Iesus the same night,j. Cor. xj.
in the which he was betrayed, toke
bread: and when hee had geuen
thankes, he brake it, & gaue it to his
disciples, saying: Take ye, & eate:
thys is my body, which is broken
for you. Thys doe ye in the remembrance
of me. After the same maner
also he toke y• cup, whē supper was
done, saying: This cup is the new
testament in my bloud. This do, as
oft as ye drinke it, in remēbrance of

me. For as oftē as ye shall eate this
bread, & drinke of thys cup, ye shall
shew the Lords death till he come.
                     When they were eating,Math. 
                              •
                           6. Iesus
tooke bread: and when he had geuen
thankes, he brake it, and gaue
it to his disciples, and sayd: Take,
eate: this is my body. And he tooke
the cup, and thanked, and gaue it
them, saying: drinke ye all of thys.
For thys is my bloud (which is of
the new testament) that is shed for
many, for the remission of sinnes.
                     As they did eate,Mar. xiiij. Iesus tooke
bread: and when hee had geuen
thankes, he brake it, and gaue it to
them, and sayd: Take, eate: thys is
my body. And he toke the cup, and
when he had geuen thankes, he
tooke it to thē, and they all dranke
of it, and he sayd vnto them: Thys
is my bloud of the new testament,
which is shed for many.
                     He tooke bread,Luk. xxi
                              ••
                           
                         and whē he had

geuen thankes, he brake it, & gaue
vnto them, saying: This is my body,
which is geuen for you: This
do in the remēbraunce of me. Likewise
also when he had supped, he
tooke the cup, saying: This cup is
the new testament in my bloud,
which is shed for you.
                  
               
               
                  Secondly, to stirre vs vp vnto thankesgeuing,
while we consider how precious, great,
and inestimable benefites we haue receaued
of God the father, by the death of hys sonne,
as deliueraunce from Sathan, freedome from
the curse of the lawe, forgeuenes of sinnes,
the fauour and good will of God, quietnes of
conscience, the holy ghost, righteousnes, victory
against sinne, death, and hell, saluation:
and finally, euerlasting life. That we should
not be vnthankfull, but rather ioyfully burst
out into all kinde of spirituall prayses, lauding,
and magnifying God the father for
these hys most hie and singular free giftes,
the Lord Christ did institute thys holy supper:
Therfore it is called of the aunciēt Doctors,
Sacramentum Eucharistiae. i. the Sacrament
of thankesgeuing.
                  
                     ☞Probations out of the holy Scriptures.
                     All that beleued,Acte. ij. continued daily

with one accorde in y• temple, and
brake bread from house to house,
and did eate their meate together
with gladnes & singlenes of hart,
praysing God.
                     Is not the cup of thankesgeuing,j. Cor. x.
for y• which we geue thankes,
partaking of the bloud of Christ?
Is not y• bread which we breake,
partaking of the body of Christ?
                  
               
               
                  Thirdly, to put vs in remembraunce, that
as the bread, which we eate at the Lordes
table, is made of many graines one loafe,
and the wine pressed together of sondry
grapes, is made one wine: so we being many,
are one body, wherof Christ is the head.
And because we all are one body, we ought
all to be beneficiall one to an other, one to
loue an other, one to beare with an other,
one to wishe well vnto an other, and one to
doe for an other, what soeuer we be able, euen
to the vttermost of our power, as our
head Christ for our health, and for our saluation,
disdained not to bestow his very life,
and to suffer death, euen the death of the
crosse for our redemption. And as we presently
at the receauing of the holy mysteries
of Christes body & bloud, do inioy through

fayth in Gods promises, all the benefites
which Christ obtayned for vs by hys blessed
death and glorious passion: so lykewise
ought they that be partakers of the Lordes
table, euery one according to hys habilitie
at that present, to be beneficiall to the poore
members of Christ, and somewhat to geue
that may relieue thē, & euer after also (whē
occasion is geuen) gladly to distribute vnto
the needie, some porcion of their goodes,
wherwith God hath endued them. That
thys was the custome in the Apostles tyme,
and in the Primatiue Church, yea, and long
after, till the Popishe Masse had driuen out
of the Church the right vse of the Lordes
supper, it is euident enough by diuers testimonyes,
both of the holy Scriptures, and of
auncient historyes.
                  
                     That we are all one body.
                     ☞Probations out of the holy Scriptures.
                     As we haue many members in
one body,Rom. xij. and all members haue
not one office: so we being many,
are one body in Christ, and euery
man among our selues, one an others
member.
                     We (though we be many) yet

are one bread,
                           
                              •
                           . Cor. x. and one body, in as
much as we all are partakers of
one bread.
                     As the body is one,Cor. xj. and hath many
members, and all the members
of one body, though they be many,
yet are but one body, euen so is
Christ. For by one spirite are we all
baptised to make one body, whether
we bee Iewes or Gentiles,
whether we be bonde or free, and
haue all drunke of one spirite. For
the body is not one member, but
many. &c. Therefore if one member
suffer, all suffer with hym. If
one member be had in honour, all
members be glad also. Ye are the
body of Christ, and members one
of an other.
                  
               
               
                  ¶Of the distribution to the needie.
                  All that beleued,

                     Asa king of Iuda did that was
good and right in the eyes of the
Lord his God:2. Par. 14. For he tooke away
straunge altars, & hill altars, and
brake downe the images, and cut
down the groues, and cōmaunded
Iuda to seeke the Lorde God of
their fathers, and to doe according
to the law and commaundement.

Idols that hys father had made.
And he put down Maacha his mother
from bearing rule, because she
