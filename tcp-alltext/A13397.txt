godfathers and godmothers
(whiche be as it were suerties
for the same purpose)
haue bene of longe tyme in suche
sorte blynded and vtterly
ignoraunt in Christes doctrine
whiche neuertheles they professe,
that they be nat able to
Catechise, that is to say, to institute,
teache, bryng vp, and
instructe theyr chyldren, for

whom the one haue promised
to the churche at the Christening
of the same,Deu. 11. the other are
boūden by goddes lawe (as afore
is remembred) to se them
taught and ryghtly instructed
in the christē faythe and lawes
of god: but also the prestes thē
               selues
whiche be theyr curates
and pastoures1. Tim. 3 (where as by
Paules sentence they ought to
be apte to teache) partely for
defaulte of lerning and partly
for neglectynge theyr flocke
(lyke careles hyrelinges be be
exceading defectiue in this be
halfe:Ioan. 10 I therfore moued of
christen charitie to vtter the lytle

talent that God hathe endowed
me with, am enforced,
accordynge to the example of
learned men in other coūtreis,
to set forthe vnto my coūtrey
men some handsome and compendiouse
Catechisme (which
is so called because it instructeth,
and bryngeth vp the
yōge christiā in Christes lawe)
For vndoubted suche one is
to be setforthe in the churche
to be lerned and as it were drō
               ken
in of chyldren, to be oftē
reuolued of men and women,
yea and to be continually caryed
in the hādes or bosomes
(but much rather ī the hertes)

of all ages, for an instruction
to the ignoraūt persons, a cō
               forte
to the troubled, reioyce
to the faythfull, spurre to the
slouthfull, brydell to the arrogant,
relief to the desperate,
occupation to the ydle, refresshyng
to the occupied, to be
shorte, an argumēt and mater
for sklender shepherdes whervpon
to instructe theyr cure.
            Nowe therfore, lyke as the
kynges most excellent maiesty
moste worthy to be compared
vnto the godly kynge Ezechias,4. R

whiche destroyed the
moste detestable ydolatrie of
the brasen serpēt, by the hygh

prouidence of God traueileth
dayly of a wonderfull zeale he
beareth to the auaūcement of
godes true religion, to banysh
all poprie and Romyshe marchaundyse
within this his graces
realme, to the vnspeakable
healthe of his people the churche
of Englāde, to the supremacie
wherof he is by the said
prouidēce of god nowe at last
in spyte of all his enemies restored:
So semblably it shalbe
your parte to embrace suche
pure, true and sincere doctrine
of Christe as setteth forth the
same, & so vtterly to renoūce
nat only the Romisshe byshop

our archenemie and the moste
pestilēt ouerthrower of al god
lynes, but also his deuelyshe
lawes, constitutions and supersticious
thynges whiche haue
hertofore intangled our consciences
contrary to the Euangelicall
libertie and trouthe of
gods worde.
            That if ye shall appeare louyngly
& gredely to embrace
this brief worke, wherin is cō
               prysed
aswell compendiously
as purely the hole doctrine of
the christen religion: ye shall
occasion me not only nat to repente
me of my paynes taken
for your sakes in this behalfe,

but also to take the lyke when
so euer I shal espy that my industry
and diligēce may serue
to your edification, profyt, instruction
and pleasure, whiche
thynge is my onely desire and
instaūt prayer, as best knoweth
god, that seeth all, to whom
be all glory prayse and
thankes for euer
and euer.
Amen.
            GOD SAVE

            AN INSTITVcion
or Catechisme of
the Christen Religion.
            
               That all men be borne to religion
or godlynes.
               
                  BEcause no man at all
can be founde, be he
neuer so barbarouse,
neuer so rudely & 
                     •
                  uyl
brought vp, but hathe some felyng
of religiō or godlynes, & is
naturally disposed to the same:
it is playne that we all be made
to this purpose and ende, that
we shulde knowledge the maiestie
of our maker and the same

so knowledged to imbrace, and
with al feare, loue and reuerēce
to worshyp. But (to let the vngodly
alone which seke nothing
els but to drowne this opiniō of
God planted in theyr myndes
and to wype ye same out of theyr
memory) we at least which professe
godlynes and wolde be called
Christes folke, nedes muste
thynke that this brykle and vnstable
lyfe ought to be nothyng
els then a certayne saye or meditatiō
of immortalitie. Nowe,
the euerlastyng and immortall
lyfe we can no where fynde but
in god. Wherfore the chief care
and thought of our lyfe shulde
be to seke god, and with all the
endeuours of our mynde to get

vp vnto hym, and to repose our
selues nowhere elles, saue in
him allonely.
            
            
               What difference is betwene
the false and true religiō.
               FOr as muche as we knowe
this by our comō sence and
vnderstandyng, that if our lyfe
be destitute and voyde of religiō
we lyue moste wretchedly, yea &
differ nothynge at all from the
brute and vnreasonable beastes,
there is no man that woll
seme to abhorre vtterly from al
godlines religion and seruice of
god. But nowe certaynly in the
maner and forme of expressyng
and declarynge this religion is

doubtles no lytle difference: for
the most parte of mē be nat touched
with the true and syncere
feare of god, but bycause, whither
they wyl or nat, they be pricked
with this thought (whiche
euer amonge hathe recourse in
their myndes) y• there is a certayne
diuinitie or Godhed, at
whose pleasure they stād or fal,
beynge I saye therfore stryken
with the opiniō of so great a power,
least they myght happen
to sturre the same against them
by their ouermoche negligence
or despysīg: they gyue some maner
of worship (such as it is) vnto
this Godhed and power. In
the meane season yet leadyng a
moost beastly and lawles lyfe &

castyng vp all studies and endeuours
of honestye and good behauour:
they shewe thēselues
excedyng careles and wonderfull
recheles in despysynge the
ryghtfull dome and sharpe sentence
of god. And then, because
they measure not god by his in
finite maiesty, but by y• loutishe
and grosse vanitie of theyr wyt,
they so departe and traytrously
shrynke awaye from the trewe
god. Wherfore with what care
so euer they afterwarde busye
them selues howe they maye
worshyppe god, they are neuer
the better, but labour in vayne,
because they worshyp not the
euerlastyng God, but the dreames,
fansyes, & dotages of their

herte in stede of god. But as for
true religion & godlynes surely
it standeth nat in feare, whiche
wolde fayne indede flee the iudgement
of god, and therfore because
it can nat flee it, feareth it
but it rather lyeth in trewe and
syncere affection, in louyng god
as a father, and fearynge hym
with all reuerence as a moste
drad soueraigne lorde, euermore
imbrasyng his ryghteousnes &
hatyng wors then deathe to offende
his maiestie. So who soeuer
is roted in thys godlynes
and true religion dareth nat of
hys owne brayne forge hym a
god as he him selfe lusteth, but
seketh the knowledge of y• true
god, euen at god hym selfe, and

taketh him to be none other, thā
suche as he sheweth and declareth
him selfe to be.
            
            
               What we ought to knowe
of God.
               SYth the very maiestie of god
passeth y• capacite of mans
vnderstandyng, so farre that it
is impossible for him to cōceyue
it, it is expedient for vs to honour
rather his hyghnes, then
rashely to serche it, least of suche
incomprehensible lyght we be
vtterly stryken downe. For this
cause then, god muste be sought
and searched out in his workes
as by certayne foresteppes, for
Goddes workes in scripture be

called the shewes of thinges inuisible,
for as muche as they represente
before our eyes suche
thynges concernyng y• lorde as
other wayes coulde nat be seye.
This I saye, not that god wold
kepe our myndes in doubte, by
vayne and voyde speculations,
but that it is ynoughe for vs to
knowe y• true religion, I meane
faithe coupled with the feare of
god, and that the same is fyrste
breathed into vs, nourished and
strengthened only by god, for in
this vniuersall ordre and cours
                     •
                  
of thynges, we beholde the immortalitie
of our god, frō whom
all thynges flowe & haue they
                     •
                  
begȳning, we se also his myght
in that he made such a worke &

vpholdeth y• same, his wysdom
in that he hathe set in so goodly
ordre suche an infinite dyuersitie
of creatures, & keapeth thē
alwayes in the same to the eschewyng
of cōfusiō. We marke
also hys goodnes, whiche was
the very cause bothe that these
workes were made, and that
nowe also they stande sure and
strōge, his rightwysnes in that
so wōderfully he declareth hym
selfe in defendyng the godly and
punishing the vngodly, we perceiue
also hys hyghe mercy, in
that so gentylly he suffreth our
wyckednes, to y• intēt we shulde
returne as his mercy giueth vs
occasion to do. Here vpō myght
we at large be enformed (as

muche as were sufficiēt for vs)
of Gods maiestie and goodnesse
and what he is, but y• our dulnes
is so greate & the eyesyght
of our mynde so blount and daselyng
at so open a lyght. Neyther
is it onely a blyndnes that
thus causeth vs to stomble, but
there is also suche a frowarde
and cankred opiniō in vs, as in
ponderyng the workes of God
taketh euery thyng a mysse and
cleane out of course, yea & tourneth
vp set downe all ye heuenly
wysoome so eudiently apparaunt
in creatures. We muste
therfore nedes come to Goddes
worde, for in it, & by it (I meane
in the holy scriptures) God is
by his workes wonderous wel

descrybed vnto vs, where the
workes thē selfes be weyed and
estemed not after our frowarde
iudgement, but by the rule of
the euerlasting truth. Here thā
we learne that our God is the
only and euerlasting fountayne
of all lyfe, ryghtwysenes, wysdome,
power, goodnes & mercy,
from whom lyke as without exception
al goodnes dothe come,
so all prayse ought worthely to
be rendred to him as his owne.
And by this meanes all thyngꝭ
though they euidently appeare
in euery seuerall parte bothe of
heauen and earthe, yet to what
purpose they serue, what they
maye do, and vnto what vse we
muste vnderstande thē, we shall

easely espye whē we step downe
to our selues, & consyder howe
god setteth forth his owne lyfe,
wysdome and power in vs, and
howe he practiseth his ryghtewysenes,
goodnesse, and mercy
towardes vs.

that in all hys ornamentes and
iewelles wher wt he was rychly
decked of god, he shulde honour
the maker of the same and worshyp
hym with suche kyndenes
as became him. But forasmuch
as he, trustyng so muche vpon
the excellencye of hys owne

nature that he had quyte forgoten
whence he came, and wherby
he was mainteyned, attempted
to auaunce hym selfe aboue
god, it was necessary he shulde
be spoyled of all goddes benefites
wheron he was so folyshely
proude, to the entent that wheras
he that was so rychely endowed
of Goddes bounteousnesse
thought scorne to know his maker
in hys felicitie, shulde nowe
beyng naked and destitute of all
his wealthe, learne to knowe hy
                  ̄
in hys mysery. Wherfore so
many of vs as be spronge of the
sede of Adam, be borne very
fleshe of fleshe, ye lykenee of God
vtterly abolyshed and extincte
in vs, so that nowe vpon what

parte so euer of man we cast our
eye, we can se nothyng, but that
is vnpure, vnhalowed and abominable
afore god. For ye wysdome
of man being blynded and
wrapte in infinite errours, with
standeth alwayes the wysdome
of god, his forwarde wyl full of
corrupte affections, hateth nothynge
worse then gods ryghtwysnes
his powers vntoward
to all good workes run hedlong
vpon all wyckednes.

the harte beyng so in the inner

may nat be so taken, that man
is forsed to synne, as by vrgent

forasmuche as his affectiōs be

al ryghtwysenes of God, and

heade spryng of al vyce, as ye ragyng
lustes that spryng therof,
yea the heynous abominacions
that brast out of these lustes, as
murther, thefte, aduoutry, and
other lyke. Wetherfore sȳners
euen from our mothers wombe
be all borne to the wrathe and
vengeaunce of God, and euer
the elder we waxe, the more greuous
iudgement we heape vpō
vs, so that all our lyfe longe we
go forwarde vnto deathe, for
sythe it is no doubte but all iniquitie
is cursed of goddes ryght
wysnes, what shall we wretches

loke for at hys hande, but
very confusion, for that bryngeth
his displeasure with it, for
asmuche as we be pressed with
so greuouse a burden of synnes
and corrupted with so infinite
drosse of vnclennes. Thys
thought, thoughe it be hable to
ouerthrowe a mā with the fear
therof & euen dryue him downe
with despayre, yet to vs it is necessary,
that we beyng thus striped
of our owne ryght wysnes,
destitute of all trustynge in our
owne power, and put backe frō
all hope of lyfe, maye learne to
fall downe lowe afore the lorde
knowyng howe beggarly we be
of our selues, howe miserable,
and very villaynes, and thus

knowyng our owne wickednes,
dishabilitye & fal that we maye
gyue him all the prayse of holynes,
power, and saluation.
            
            
               By what maner we be restored
agayne to lyfe and healthe.
               FRom this knowledge of our
selfe, so playnly shewing vs
howe we be nothyng at all, (if
it can earnestly settle in our hertes)
there is a playne and redy
way to a more true knowledge
of God, yea he hym selfe hathe
nowe opened vs the fyrste gate
into his kyngdome, thus vnder
mynyng the two moste noysom
pestilences, I meane the vnregardyng
of goddes vengeaunce

and ye false trust on our selues.
For then we begyn to lyfte vp
our eyes vnto heauen, whiche
afore dyd cleaue faste vnto the
grounde, and we that afore reposed
in our selues nowe thynke
longe for the Lorde. That same
lord & father of mercy although
oure synne hathe deserued the
contrary, yet for his vnspeakeable
mercy of hys owne mere
goodnes, sheweth hym selfe to
the troubled and astonyed conscieces,
and calleth vs home agayn
by what meanes he knoweth
most expediēt for our weakenesse,
from straieng to the right
way, from deathe to lyfe, from
perdition to sauegarde, yea and
from the kyngdome of the deuyll

to hys owne kyngedome.
Wherfore euen to so many as
the lorde vouchsaueth to restore
to y• enheritaūce of his heauēly
lyfe, he vseth such maner trade,
that they beyng sore wounded
in conscience by theyr synnes,
and weryed with the burthen
therof, myght be styrred to fear
him. Fyrste of al therfore he gyueth
vs his lawe, to exercise vs
vnto that knowledge.
            
            
               Of the lawe of the Lorde.
               IN the lawe of god is delyuered
vs the most perfecte rule
of all ryghtwysnes whiche we
maye well call the euerlastynge
wyll of the Lorde. For there in
two tables hath he playnly and
fully declared what so euer he

requireth of vs. In the fyrste
what worshyp his maiestie alloweth,
and in the other what offices
of loue be due to our neyghbour
in fewe cōmaundementes
he hathe expressed. Let vs therfore
heare the lawe, which done
we shall se what learnynge we
muste take of it, and what truit
we ought to gather therof.

affyrmeth that he hym selfe is
the Lorde our God, he meaneth
that he is suche one as hathe
authoritie to cōmaunde, and to
whose commaundementes we
ought to obey. As he sayeth by
his prophet.M

                     la. 1. If I be the father,
where is loue? If I be the lorde,
wher is feare? he also reherseth
hys benefytes, to reproue our
vnkyndenes, if we obey not hys
voyce. For with the same goodnes
wherby he preserued y• people
of the Iues ones out of the
bondage of Egypt, dothe he also
delyuer all hys seruaūtes frō
theyr perpetual Egypt that is

And where as he forbyddeth to
haue any other goddes, he restrayneth
vs that we shuld not
gyue that is gods dutie to any
other, then to him alonely. He
sayth therfore. Afore my face,
wherby he declareth, yt he wyll
not only be knowen as a god by
outwarde confession, but also y•
he wyll be truely takē for the only
god īwardely in hert. These
thinges belong properly to god
alone, which without sacrilege
can be gyuen to none other, so
that him onely we ought to honour,
in him to repose our trust
and hope, him to thāk for what
soeuer good and holy thing we
haue, & vnto him to rendre all
prayse of goodnes & holynesse.
               
                  
                  Thou shalte not make
thy self any grauen ymage

any thinge / that is in heauē
aboue / or ī erth beneth
nor in the water / vnder
the earthe. Thou shalte
not bowe downe to thē / 
to worshype them.
                  LYke as in ye first commaū
                     dement,
god declared him selfe
to be but one, so nowe he
sheweth, what a God he is, and
howe he wyll be honoured. He
forbyddeth therfore to make
him any lykenes. And the cause
hereof he sheweth in Deut.Deut. 4: Esay 40. and
in Esay: for that no bodyly substaunce
can be resembled to a

spirite. He further forbyddeth
vs to honour any ymage as a
thinge of holynes. Let vs lerne
then y• the worshypping of God
is a spiritual thinge, for lyke as
god him selfe is a spirite, so he
woll be worshypped in spirite &
trouth He addeth therfore an
horryble thretnyng,Ioan. 4. wherby he
wold we knewe, how greuously
he is displeased wt the breache
of this cōmaundement. (I am
thy Lorde God.) This is afmoch
as yf he should faye that
he onely is the Lorde God, on
whom we ought to hange and
that he cā suffer none to be hys
felowe, or matched with hym,
y• he wil also defēde his maiestie
& glory yf any go about to transpose

it to grauen ymanges or other
thinges & with such vengeaūce
as shal be neyther short
nor sengle, but y• shall reache to
our childrē, our childrēs childrē
and vnto their childrē also, euē
as many as folowe theyr fathers
wyckednes, lyk as again
he setteth forthe euerlastynge
mercy & grace to the godly and
their ofsprynge also, euen to as
many as loue him and kepe
hys lawe. In thys thynge he
sheweth vs the largenes of his
mercy stretched forthe into a
thousande generations, where
as he assigneth hys vengeaūce
to reache onely but to foure generations.
               
               
                  
                  Thou shalte not take the
name of thy Lorde God
in vayne.
                  HEre he forbyddeth vs to
abuse hys holy name in
swerynge, eyther for folysh tryfles
or to establyshe our owne
lyes. Othes ought not to serue
neyther to selfe wyll, nor pleasure,
but to very necessity, wher
eyther the glory of God must
be vpholden, or a thinge affermed
that belongeth to the furtheraunce
of our neyghbours.
Utterly he forbyddeth vs to de
file his holy name in any thing,
but to vse it reuerently & wyth
hygh dignitie accordinge to his
holynes, whether we swere or
what other worde so euer we

speake of him. And for asmoche
as the principall vse of the
takynge of gods holy name
chiefly consisteth in callinge vpon
him: here we may vnderstand
that we haue a cōmaundement
to call vpon him.
                  In conclusion he appointeth
the penaltie, least those shulde
trust to escape his reuengeaūce
that haue abused the holynes
of hys name by perturyes
and blasphemous othes, and
therfore addeth that the Lorde
woll not haue him vnreuenged
that taketh the name of
hys Lord God in vayne.
               
               
                  Remember thou kepe holy
the sabboth daye.
                  
                     
WE haue marked three causes
of this commaundement,
for it pleased God, vnder
the quyete of the seuenth daye
to gyue the people of Israell a
fygure of a ghostly rest, wherein
the fayth full ought to cease
from their owne wyll workes,
and suffer God to worke in thē.
Seconde, he wolde also that
one certayne daye were assigned,
wherin the people shulde
assemble togither to heare the
lawe, and to do their honest ceremonies.
Thirdly God wolde
that seruaūtes and suche as be
at other mens commandement
shulde haue one day to rest in,
y• they might haue some release
of their labour. As touching y•
                     
first cause, no doubte it ceased
at the commynge of Christ, for
he is the truthe, at whose presence
forthwith all figures and
tokens vanysh, he is the body,
at whose comminge, shadowes
be left,Colo. 2 Therfore sayth Paul,
the sabboth was but a shadow
of a thinge to come, the trouth
wherof he expoundeth, where
he teacheth we be buryed with
Christ,Rom. 6. that by hys deathe we
myght dye to the corruption of
our fleshe. Nowe this is not
done in one day, but in the hole
coursse of our lyfe it must be
practised, vntyll at laste beynge
vtterly dead in our selues, we
maye be fylled with the lyfe of
God. Christiās therfore ought

not to haue any supersticiouse
keping of dayes. But for as
moche as the two latter causes
ought not to be accompted with
the olde shadowes, but serue a
lyke for all tymes, therfore
though the sabboth day be abolyshed,
yet neuerthelesse amonges
vs euen at thys daye,
this cōmaundement hath hys
place, that at certayne dayes
we shulde mete togither for the
hearing of goddes worde, for ye
breakinge of the mystical bread
and for common prayers to be
made, also that seruaūtes and
workemen maye haue release
from their labours, for it can
not be brought to passe (our infirmitie
is so greate) that such

assembles can be kept euery
day. Wherfore for ye destroieng
of supersticion, the Iewes sabboth
daye is taken away, but
for the kepinge styll of good ordre
and peax in the churche, an
other day is assigned to that be
houfe. Therfore as the trouth
was gyuen vnto the Iewes vnder
a figure, so it is set forth to
vs without shadowes, Fyrste
that all our lyfe longe we shuld
practise a cōtinual saboth (that
is to saye) a rest frome our workes,
that the Lorde by his spirite
myght worke in vs. Seconde,
that we shoulde kepe the
lawful ordinaunces of the churche
appointed for goddes worde
to be herde, for sacramentes

to be ministred, and general
prayers to be made. Thirdly
that we shulde not vngentylly
ouercharg our feruauntes and
prentyses with worke.
               
               
                  Honour thy father and
thy mother &c.
                  HEre is gyuen vs in commaundement
to haue a redy seruice of hert towardes
our parentes, and other which
in stede of parentes haue rule
ouer vs by the ordinaunce of
god, as the kyng and other his
deputies, I meane that we embrace
thē wt al reuerēce, obedience,
kyndnesse, and al the seruice
we cā do. For this is the will of
the Lord, that we shuld recompence
those that brought vs

into this lyfe with kyndnes for
kyndnes. And it maketh no mater
whether they be worthy or
vnworthye to whome this honour
is gyuen, for what soeuer
they be, God hath set them ouer
vs in stede of our parentes and
heddes and wol we honoure
them. yea thys is the first commaundemēt
that hath any promes
knit vnto it,Eph
                           •
                        . 6. as Paul saith
wherin whiles God promiseth
the blessing of this lyfe to those
that honour their parētes with
due reuerēce according to theyr
bounden duetie, he meaueth also
that his most certayne curse
shall lyght on their neckes that
be stubburne and disobedient to
their parentes or other superiour

powers. But thꝭ one thing
by ye waye is to be marked that
we be not commaunded to obey
them, but onely in the Lorde,
we maye not therfore for theyr
pleasure trangresse the lawe of
the Lorde,Eph
                           •
                        . 
                           •
                        
                      for then we ought
not to take them for our parentes
and heddes, but for straungers
which go aboute to withdrawe
vs frome the obedience
of our true father.
               
               
                  Thou shalt not kyll.
                  IN thys commaundement
is forbyddē al violēce, force,
wronge, and generally all maner
of trespace, whereby oure
neyghbours body is hurt, for if
we remēbre how man is made

to the ymage of God, we ought
to esteme him as an halowed
thinge, so yt he cā not be distayned
but ye ymage of God muste
be distayned also.
               
               
                  Thou shalt not commit
adultery.
                  HEre god dāneth all kynd
of horedom and vncleannesse,
for the Lorde hathe ioyned
togither ye man and womā
in the lawe of mariage onely.
And wyth hys blessynge also
hath he halowed that couple,
goynge togither by hys authoritie
Wherby it is manifeste, y•
all other ioynyng saue only in
mariage is cursed before him
Wherfore so many as haue not

the gyft to refrayne, whyche is
a singulear gyft and standeth
not in mans power, let them
case the intemperancy of their
flesh with the honest remedy of
mariage,Heb. 1
                           •
                        
                      for mariage is honorable
amōges all men, but hore
mongers and adnouterers god
will iudge.
               
               
                  Thou shalte not steale.
                  VTterly we be forbyd one
of vs to lye in awaite for
the goodes of an other. For god
wyl not, yt in his people be anye
wrongful takinges, whereby y•
pore shuld be vexed & oppressed
nor any disceytes wherby the
simple shuld be cōpased about,
Wherfore yf we woll kepe our
hād
                        •
                     s pure & innocēt frō thefte

muste refrayne aswel frome all
craft and subteltie as from violent
extorcions.
               
               
                  Thou shalte beare no false
wytnes &c.
                  IN this cōmaundement the
Lord damneth al sclaunderous
checkes, tawntes, & euyll
reapportes wherby oure brothers
good name is appeyred,
he forbydeth also al maner lyes
wherby in any part oure brother
is hurte, for seynge a good
name is more precious, then al
other treasures, doubtles it can
be no lesse hurtful for vs to be
robbed of oure good name, then
of our temporall goodes, for to
the vndoing and spoylynge of a

man a false wytnes, somtyme
worketh more myschiefe then
the violent force of handes
Wherfore lyke as in the other
commaundement aboue remē
                     bred
the hand had a restraynt,
so in thys hathe the tongue.
               
               
                  Thou shalt not desyre
thy neyghbours house / 
thou shalte not desyre
thy neyghboures wyfe / 
nor hys seruaūte nor his
mayde / nor his oxe / nor
his asse / nor anye thynge
that is thy neyghbours.
                  HEre the Lord maketh a restreynte
vpon as manye
as raunge ouer the lystes and

boundes of charitie, for where
as other commaundementes
forbyd vs to do contrary to the
rule of loue, this forbyddeth vs
euen to thynke any suche thing
in herte, Wherfore by this cō
                     maundement
be reproued hatred,
enuye, and malyce, euen
aswell as murdre in the other
preceptes aboue rehersed, lust
also and inwarde vnclennesse of
hert be here condemned, aswell
as horedome and aduoutrye in
dede, And where in the other
commaundement were restreynede
robhery and gile, here is also
couetousnesse plucked in by
the bryddell, where afore all opprobriouse
wordes were 
                        •
                     estrayned,
here is also repreued

malice of mynde it selfe. So we
se here howe vniuersall a commaundemēt
this is, that extendeth
so on euery syde. God requireth
suche a wonderous affection
and brotherly loue so feruent,
yt by no lust he wyl haue it
aryse against ye welth and profite
of our neyghboure. Thys
is then ye pythe of this cōmaundement,
that suche a studye
and minde we ought to haue, yt
webe incensed ne tychled with
no maner of lust contrary to the
lawe of charitie, and that we be
redy wyth all our hert to yelde
euery man that is his. Now,
that muste we recken to be euery
mans own, whych by our
boundē duty we owe vnto him.
               
            
            
               
               The pyth of the law
               TO what purpose al the cō
                  maundemētes
of the law
pertayne: sufficiently declareth
Christe oure Lorde, where he
sayth that the hole lawe is conteyned
in two principal cōmaū
                  demes,
that is, to loue the
Lorde god wyth all oure herte,
with all our soule, and with all
our power, & to loue our neyghbour
as our selues, whiche exposition
he toke our euen of the
selfe lawe, for the firste parte is
red Deut. vi. and the other Leuiti
.xix.
            
            
               What profyt commeth vnto
vs by the Law onely.
               LO here a true exemplar &
president of the ryght and

holy lyfe, yea a very perfecte ymage
of ryghtwysnes it selfe,
so that yf any mā can inlyuing
expresse ye law of god, the same
can lacke nothinge to hys perfection
afore god, In so moche
(as he hym selfe is wytnesse)
he promiseth to those that kepe
his lawe not alonly excellent
prosperities and commodities
of this lyfe (which be reckened
Leuiti .xxvi. and Deut. xxvii.)
but also the rewarde of euerlastynge
lyfe. On the contrary
part he thretneth punyshment
of euerlastynge deathe to those
that haue not fulfylled what so
euer he hath gyuen them in cō
                  maundement
to be done. Moses
also whē he had publyshed

the law, called to wytnesse heauen
and earthe, that he had setforth
to the people good and euyll,
lyfe and deathe. Nowe
where as he shew vs the waye
of lyfe, we must se what profyt
we haue by thys appoyntynge
and shewynge of the waye. Uerely
yf our wyl were al togither
framed and bent vnto the obedience
of gods wyll, then were
the onely knowledge of the law
ynough for our saluacion, but
seynge oure nature beynge flesshely
and corrupte, warreth lyke
an extreme aduersary agaynst
gods lawe a thynge of the
spirite, and is in nothing amended
by her good nurtur and instructions,
therfore the lawe it

selfe whiche was vnto our saluation
(yf it coulde haue had
good hearers) is nowe become
an occasion of synne and death,
for asmoche as we be all cast &
conuict as transgressours therof,
So the more openly it declareth
ye ryghtwysnes of god
the more hemously dothe it vtter
our wyckednes. And agayn
the higher transgressiō the law
hathe to laye to our charge, the
more greuous iugemēt are we
condemned to. Thus nowe the
promyse of lyfe is vtterly takē
awaye, and onely remayneth y•
curse and that vpon al our neckes
by occasion of the lawe.
            
            
               The law is meane
vnto Christ.
               
                  NOwe thoughe the wyekednes
and damnacion of
vs all be sealed vp and confermed
with witnesse of the lawe,
yet this is not therfore done to
the intent we shoulde fall into
despayre, or in this extreme plū
                  ge
run hedlong to oure ownede
struction, for the Apostell declareth
vs all damned by iudgement
of the lawe,Rom. 5. to thintent euery
mouthe shuld be stopped,
and all the worlde be brought
vnder gods daunger. And yet
the same Apostle sayth in an other
place that god hath shut
vp all men vnder vnbelefe,Rom. 11. not
to destroye all, nor to suffre thē
to perishe, but to haue mercy vpon
al. The Lorde therfore will

that we by ye law thus beynge
warned of our owne weakenes
and vnclennesse: shoulde take
comfort vpō the trust of his power
and mercye, and that in
Christ, for whose sake he sheweth
him selfe so tender & mercyfull
a father vnto vs. In the
lawe can it not be sene that he
rewardeth but onely perfecte
rightwysnesse, whiche all we

                     •
                  acke, where as otherwyse he
is a strayght iudge of synnes.
But in Christ his face is all ful
of fauour & grace euen toward
wretches and vnworthy synners
This so wonderfull a token
of his exceding, loue he shewed
vs by gyuyng vp his own
sonne for vs, in whom he hath

agaynst other he extendeth the
rygorousnes of his iudgemēt,
let vs suffer the cause to rest in
his handes, for thys thynge he
woll haue vnknowen vnto vs
all, and that not without good
skyll, for neither the dulnesse of
ourewyt is hable to abide such
a lyght, ne the sklēder capacitie
of the same is in any part sufficient
to conceyue so greate a power
of his wysedom, For verely
here who so euer wyll attempte
to aduaūce him selfe, not refreynynge
the rashnes of hys wyt,
shall fynde it true yt Salomon
sayth,Prou. 50. whoso woll serche the
maiesty: shal be oppressed of the
glory. Let vs only determyne
this wyth our selues, that this

same ordinaunce of the Lorde,
though it be secret vnto vs, yet
it is righteous and holy, for yf
he wolde destroye al mankynd,
doubtles he maye of ryght do
it. And surely in those whom he
calleth backe agayne frome dā
                  nacion:
we can se nothinge but
his hygh goodnes. Let vs thā
conceyue with oure selues that
the chosē be ye vessels of mercy,
as they be in dede, and that the
forsakē be the vessels of wrath
and not but of a iuste cause.
But of thē both we maye take
occasiō and matter to aduaunce
gods glory. Neyther yet shall
we (as many men do) for a sure
establyshment and knowlege of
our saluaciō clyme vp to heauē
                  
and sawcely enserch what God
hath decreed of vs afore the
worlde began, whiche thought
can no other thing do, but bring
vs in a miserable doubte and
trouble, But let vs rather be cō
                  tent
wyth the wytnesse wherwyth
ye Lorde hath sufficiently
made our saluacion strong and
sure, for lyke as in Christe were
all the chosen euen as many as
afore the foundatiō of the earth
was layd,Ephe. 1. ordeined vnto lyfe: so
is he ye person in whom resteth
the assuraūce of our saluacion,
yf we by faith receyue and embrace
him. For what other thīg
do we serche in the election, but
to be partetakers of the euerlastinge
lyfe? And this saluaciō
                  
we obteyne in Christe whiche
was the selfe lyfe frome the begynnyng,Ioan. 1. and was made ruler
ouer vs vnto lyfe, that all those
that beleue in hym shulde not
peryshe, but haue euerlastynge
lyfe. Wherfore yf we possessinge
Christ by fayth possesse also in
hym euerlastynge lyfe,Ioan. 5. it is no
point of oure charge to make
any further enquirye of gods
eternall counsell,Rom. 5. 1. 10. 3. Christe is not
onely a glasse wherin gods wyl
is represented vnto vs, but also
an euidence wherin it is after a
maner sealed vp for vs.
            
            
               What is true fayth.
               THe christiane fayth ought
to be taken neyther for a
bare knowledg of God, neyther

yet for suche an vnderstandyng
of scripture, as lyke a fansye flyeng
here & there in the brayne▪
worketh no good mocion no
                     •
                  
goostly affection in the herte, as
whē commenly men conceyue
in their heades certayne opinions
of suche matters as seme
to haue strong reasons to make
with them. But it is a sounde &
stedfast belefe of herte, wherby
we safely rest aud staye our consciences
in gods mercy promysed
vs by hys gospell, for thus
shall we well defyne what belefe
is, yf we ernestly behold
                     •
                   y•
nature of gods promysses, whyche
belefe so hangeth vpon the
promesse hys propre foundatiō
that yf ye take the promesse awaye,

it forthwyth fayleth &
goeth to nought. Wherfore so
longe as the Lorde offerethe vs
hys mercy by hys promesse in
the gospell, yf we faythfully
trust thervnto we be counted in
faith to receyue hys word.Hebr. 11. And
thus doth the Apostle defyne
fayth, where he saith, fayth is
the grounde of thynges that be
trusted vpon, and the proufe
of thīges not sene, He meaneth
that fayth is none other thing,
but a certayne & sure possession
of all suche thinges, as be promised
vs by God, & an euidence
of thinges that as yet do not
appeare, I meane of the lyfe euerlastyng,
wherof we cōceyue
an hope and an expectation vpon

the trust we haue in the
goodnes of god so lyberally offered
vs in his gospell.2. Cor. 15. And for
as moche as al gods promyses
are stronge in Christe, and after
a maner performed and made
good in him, it foloweth vndoubtydly
that Christ hym selfe
is the euerlasting Butte and
marke of oure fayth, in whome
it may beholde all the ryches of
gods depe mercye.
            
            
               Fayth is the gifte of God
               IF we well ponder and weye
with our selues, how blynd
thꝭ oure wit is and howe farre
vnhable to attayne vnto Gods
heuenly secrecies, & with what
doubte and mystrust oure hert
laboureth within vs, then shall

we well perceyue howe farre
faith surmounteth and passeth
all oure naturall power, howe
also it is a singuler and excellēt
gyfte of God, For sythe that
no man (as Paul reasoneth) is
of secret counsell wyth mans
wyll,1. Cor. 
                        •
                     . but only the spirite of mā, whyche is in man, howe maye
it be that man can haue any certayne
knowledge of gods counsell?
And for as moche as
Gods open trouth is very weake
amōges vs, in those thinges
that here we se before our eyes,
how shuld it be strong and sure,
where god only promyseth those
thinges that neuer were sene
by eye, nor yet cōceyued in mās
wytte? Now it is euident and

playne that fayth is a lyghtenynge
of ye holy ghost, wherby
our wyttes be lyghtened and
our hertes established & strengthened
with a sure staye of consciēce,
being throughly persuaded
in our selues that God of
hys promyse is so true, faythfull,
and iuste, that he can not
but performe what so euer he
hath bounde him self to by hys
holy worde and promesse. And
for thys cause fayth is called y•
pledge or ernest because it setteth
oure conscience at the staye
of gods trouth, It is also named
a seale wherwith our hartes
be sealed & marked agaynst
the daye of the Lorde,2. Cor. 1. Ephe. 1. Rom. 8. for the
Lorde himselfe is he that beareth

wytnesse to oure spirite yt
God is our father and we his
dere beloued sonnes.
            
            
               In christ we he made rightuouse
by Fayth.
               FOr as moche as it is euident
and playne, yt Christe
is the euerlastyng Butte, and
marke of fayth, we can none other
wyse fele what profites &
benefytes we take by fayth, thē
onely by lokynge and hauynge
a directe eye towardes him, for
vnto this purpose was Christe
gyuen vs of the father,Ioan. 17. that in
hym we myght obteyne euerlastynge
lyfe as he hym selfe
sayth, thys is the euerlastynge
lyfe,Ioan. 11. euen to knowe one god the
father, and whom he hath sent

Iesus Christe. Also he saith, he
that beleueth in me, shall not
dye for euer, that yf he dye he
shall lyue. But how maye thys
com to passe? forsoth thus, we
that be vncleane by reason of
synne, muste be pourged and
clensed in hym, for no vncleane
thinge shal entre into the kyngdome
of God. Christe therfore
maketh vs parteners and as
ioyntpatentes wyth hym, so yt
though of oure selues we be synners,
yet for Christes rightwysnes
we be accepted for righteouse
at the iugement seate of
god, And thus spoyled of our
own rightousnes we be cladde,
and endewed with Christes
righteousnesse. So where as

by workes we be vnrighteouse,
by fayth in Christ we be made
ryghteouse, I saye we be iustifyed
by fayth, not that we haue
any rightousnes within vs of
our selues, but that Christes
ryghtuousnes is counted for
our rightuousnes, and our wickednes
is nothing at al layde to
our charge, so that, wyth one
worde, we may call thys rightousnes
forgyuenes of synnes.
The Apostle clerely declareth
thys,Rom. 10. Pilip. 3. whyles oftentymes he setteth
the rightuousnes of workes
wyth the rightuousnes of
fayth, and sheweth howe y• one
ouerwhelmeth and turneth the
other vpsyde downe Nowe by
what fashion Christe hath dedeserued

vs thys ryghtousnes
and in what partes it is conteyned
ye shall se in the symbole of
faith where euery Article seuerally
by it selfe shalbe orderly rehersed,
whervpon is founded
the hole belefe of a christen mā.
            
            
               By Fayth we be halowed
and as it were seasoned to
the obedience of the law.
               LYke as Christ through his
rightwysnes is a meane
for vs vnto God ye father, that
he beyng as it were our suretie
we be takē & reputed for ryghtwyse,
so by the partakynge of
his holy spirite he haloweth vs
to all purenes and innocency.
For vpon him rested the spirite
of the Lorde aboue al measure,

I meane the spirite of wysedome
and vnderstandynge,Esa. 61. 12 of
coūsel, strēgth, knowlege, feare
of the Lorde, so that of hys
plently & fulnes we all receyue
and drinke vp largely grace for
grace. They therfore be deceyued
that boaste theyr Fayth in
Christe, where they be vtterlye
voyde & destitute of the halowynge
of hys spirite. For scripture
teacheth that Christe is
not onely made our ryghtwysnes,Iere. 31.
but our halowyng also, for
by the selfe same couenaunt yt
the Lorde maketh wyth vs in
Christ, he promyseth both to
pardon our wyckednes, and also
to wryte hys law in our hertes.
Therfore the kepynge of

the law is no worke of our hability,
but of a spiritual power,
wherby our hertes be pourged
frome their corruption & made
softe in the obedience of ryghtuousnes.
Now then the vse of
the lawe to Christen men is a
farre other thinge from that it
shuld be without fayth, for whē
ones God graueth in our hertes
a loue of hys ryghtousnes,
then the outwarde doctryne of
the lawe whyche before dyd nothynge
but accuse vs aswell of
weakenes as of trangression,
is nowe becomme a lyghte to
our feete that we shoulde not
straye from the strayght waye,Psal. 119.
it is nowe our wysedō,Deut. 4. wherby
we be enformed, and styred to al

honestie,Psalm. 11
                        •
                     . it is our nurtonre whiche
woll not suffre vs to renne
to moche at large in our selfe
wyll and luste.
            
            
               Of repentaūce and new byrth.
               HErevpon it is easy to vnderstāde,Mat. 3. and in other places.
why repentaūce
is alwaye ioyned wyth faythe
in Christe, why also the Lorde
affirmeth, that no mā can entre
into the kyngdom of heauen except
he be borne a newe,Ioan. 3. for repentaūce
betokeneth a retournynge,
wherby we byd the frowardenesse
of thys world farewell
and repare agayne vnto ye
Lordes waye. Nowe Chryste
because he is not the ministre
of synne, dothe washe away our
synnes, and decke vs wyth

hys ryghtwysnes to the intent
we shulde not stayne thys hys
grace wyth new fylthynes agayne,
but ones chosen to be
gods sonnes shulde consecrate
and direct al our lyfe from hensforth
to the glory of our father.
Thys worke of repentaūce hā
                  geth
on our newe byrth,Rom. 6. Colos. 5. & alibi. whych
new byrth, standeth vpon two
partes, the sleynge of our flesh,
I meane of thys corruption naturally
spronge in vs, and a spirituall
quyckenynge wherby ye
nature of mans is restored to
her clennes. wherfore vpō thys
meditation we muste laboure &
employ our selues al oure lyue
lōge, that we ones deed to sinne
and to our selues maye lyue to

Christe & to his ryghtuousnes.
And wheras this new byrth cā
neuer be perfect so longe as we
lyue in the pryson of thys mortall
body, it muste nedes be that
this same mynd and study of repentaūce
ought styl to continue
in vs euen vnto death.
            
            
               Howe ryghtwysnesse of good
workes and of faythe maye
stande togither.
               GOod workes that come of
suche a purenes of conscience
doubtles be stronge and allowed
before god, For sythe god
seeth his owne ryghtuousnesse
in them, he can not but allowe
them, yet must we take hede,
least we beare oure self so hault
in the vayne affiaūce and trust

of our good workes, that we
forget not how we be iustifyed
by the fayth in Christ alonely.
For there is no righteousnes of
workes afore God, except it answereth
to his rightousnes, so yt
who so goeth about to be iustifyed
by his owne workes, it is
not ynoughe for hym, to brynge
out one good dede or two, but
he must shewe forth a perfecte
obedience of the lawe, whyche
thyng is farre awey yea frome
those that seme moost of all to
haue profyted & gone forwarde
afore other in the Lordes law,
Besyde thys although y• ryghtuousnes
of god coulde be content
and pleased with one good
dede only, and no mo, yet shulde

not god fynde so muche as one
good dede in all hys sayntes, yt
worthely euē of the self workes
deseruynge he myghte prayse
and commende as rightwyse.
For this is ye very trouth, seme
it neuer so great a meruel, that
no worke we do is perfect on euery
syde, but is blemyshed wt 
some wart eyther in one parte
or other Wherfore syth we be
synners foyled with many remnauntes
of vyces, we muste nedes
be iustified an other waye
thā by our selfe. Now certeinly
we haue alwaye greate nede of
Christe, that by hys perfectnes
oure vnperfectnesse maye be
couered, by hys purenes oure
vnclennes maye be washed by

his obediēce our iniquitie maie
be blotted out, fynally yt for his
rightousnesse we maie befreely
taken as rightuouse wtout any
respect of our workes, whyche
in no wyse can be of suche valoure
to stande in the iudgemēt
of God. Thys notwythstandynge,
so longe as these our
spottes whyche other wayes
myght blemyshe & stayne oure
workꝭ before God, be thus hyd
and kepte close, the Lorde consydereth
in them nothynge but
hyghe purenesse and holynesse,
where vpon he vouchesaueth
to gyue them hyghe tytles of
prayses, for he calleth and also
estemeth them euen ryghtousnesses
yea and promyseth vnto

thē large rewardes. So maye
we then shortly conclude that
oure felowshyp wyth Christe
is of such strength & force, that
for it we be not onely freely reputed
ryghtuous but also our
workes be reckened vs for iustice
and ryghtuousnesse, and
be aboundantly recompensed
wyth an euerlastyng rewarde.
            
            
               The Symbole of fayth or
Christen Crede.
               WE tolde you heretofore
what profyte we take by
our fayth in Christ, nowe shall
ye heare, what our faith ought
to beholde in Christ, & what to
conceyue of him to the stablyshment
and confermynge of it.
Certaynely thys is declared in

the Simbole or Christē Crede,
as howe Christe is made vnto
vs by his father our wysdome,
raunsome,1. Cor. 1. lyfe, ryghtwysnes,
and holynes. Nowe it maketh
no greate matter, who was the
maker of this Symboll, or by
what personꝭ this abrydgeniēt
of faith was set forthe, whiche
in it hath no humane doctrine,
but is gathered of most certain
recordes of scripture. And because
no man shulde muse why
we knowledge our selues to beleue
in the father, the sonne, &
the holy ghoste, we woli some
what speake hereof afore we
entre into the Crede. When we
name the father, the sonne, and
the holy holy ghost, we make

vs nat thre goddes, but in most
symple and pure vnite of God,
aswel the scripture as the very
experiēce of godlynes shewe vs
God the father, hys sonne and
the spirite, so yt our vnderstanding
cā not conceyue the father
but it must also cōpryse aswell
the sonne (in whome shyneth ye
fathers lyuely ymage) & the
spirite in whom his power and
might is opened. In one God
therfore let vs fyxe the hole
thought of our mynd, and yet
in the mean season cōsider y• father
wt ye sōne and his holy gost.
               
                  I beleue in one God the
father almyghty maker
of heauen and earth.
                  
                  By these wordꝭ we be taught
to beleue not nakedly that
there is a God, but also to know
that he is our God, and to trust
that we be of the nōber of those
whom he promyseth to be their
God, whome also he taketh for
his owne people. Thys God is
called almighty wherby is meaned,
that by his prouidence he
disposeth al thinges, and at his
pleasure gouerneth & through
his power and myght ordereth
them, when we cal him maker
of heauen and earthe, we muste
therwith vnderstande yt he cō
                     tinually
nourisheth, susteyneth
and quyckeneth whatsoeuer ones
he made.
               
               
                  
                  And in Iesus Christ hys
onely sonne our Lorde.
                  WHere aboue we sayd that
Christ is he euerlastyng
butte of our fayth, thys is easy
to se, for as

IN these wordꝭ we be taught
after what sort Iesus paied

cause why he was borne a mortal

he wente downe into hell, it is
meāt he was extremely hādled
of God, & that he felte the horryble
sharpenesse of gods iudgement
in that he dyd put hym
self betwene vs & Gods wrath,

Not that y• father was at any

howe coulde he be angrye with
hys most deare sonne in whom
is all hys delyte and pleasure?
or howe coulde he be pacyfyed
wyth hys prayer wyth whome
he were displeased?) but in this
sense we say he bare the weight
of goddes rygorousnes, because
beynge thus strycken and as it
were scourged by the hande of
God, he felte all the tokens
and sygnes wherwythe god
in hys fume is wonte to punysshe
synners, in so moche
that when the Passion waxed
stronge ouer hym,Mat. 
                           •
                        71 he was constreyned

streyned to crye my God, my
God, why hast yu forsaken me?
               
               
                  And the thyrde daye he
rose agayne frome death / 
he ascended into heauen
and sytteth on the ryght
hande of God the father
almyghty / frome thence
he shall come to iudge
the quycke and the deed.
                  OF Christes rysynge agayn
we maye gather a sure
trust of victorye,Act. 2. that we shall
ouercome death, for lyke as he
coulde not be holden downe by
al y• panges of death, but mightely
dyd brast forth beyonde all
deathes power, so dyd he represse
and quenche all hys stinges

and that in suche wyse, as
he is nat hable to styng vs now
any more, at leaste waye to our
destruction.2. Cor. 15 So then his rising
agayne,is fyrst a ryght certayn
trueth and euen the grounde of
our rysyng to come,Rom. 7. and also of
this our presente quickenyng,
wherby we be raysed vp vnto
a newnesse of lyfe. By his ascē
                     sion
or mounting vp vnto heauen,
he opened vs the way vnto
the kyngedome of heauen,
whiche in Adam was agaynste
all men shut, for he ascended in
to heauē in our fleshe as it were
in our name, to the intente that
euen nowe in hym by hope we
may possesse heauen, and after
a maner syt euen amonges the

heauēly sprites. And assuredly
he is not there wtout our hygh
profyte: for accordyng to the office
of his euerlastyng presthod
he wēt into the sāctuary of god
not made of mans hande, and
there he laboureth as a continual
attourney and mediatour

that he is crouned & proclaymed,
kynge, iudge, & Lorde,
ouer al thinges, yt by his power
he myght cōserue and gouerne

in whiche daye he alone

not onely here aske, that god
wolde make our owne desyre
voyde and of no effecte, euen so
many as be contrarye and repugnant
to his wyll, but also
that he, extinguyshinge these
our affections, wolde shape in
vs new thoughtes, newe myndes,
and newe ententes, so that
none other motion or luste be
felt in vs, then a pure consente
and ful agremēt with his wil,
and for a conclusion that we
woll nothinge of our selfe, but
as the holy spirite woi in vs, by
whose secrete instruction & teachinge,
we maye lerne to loue
those thinges that be pleasaūt
to hym, and to hate & abhorre

wors then deathe what so euer
displease him. Nowe assured
we are that displeaseth hym y•
is contrary to his worde and
institucion.
               
               
                  Gyue vs thys daye
oure dayely
breade.
                  HEre in generall we aske
of god all thynges necessary
to the behouf of our
bodyes vnder the clementes of
this worlde, not onely to be fed
and clothed, but, also what so
euer thing he forseeth to be expedient
for vs to thintent ws
mought eat our bread in peax.
In this petition with few wordes,

we betake our selues into
his kepynge, and commit vs to
his diuine prouidence that he
wolde fede, nouryshe and preserue
vs, for y• moste graciouse
and tender father doth not disdayne
to take vnto his kepyng
and tuiciō also this our bodie,
y• he myghte exercise our fayth
in these same lytell small thynges,
whiles we loke to receyue
at his hande all thynges what
so euer we haue nede of euen to
a crumme of bread and a drop
of water. Where we say Dayly
and this daye, it meaneth that
we ought onely to aske thinges
sufficiēt for our nede, euen as it
were for no more but this day:
With this assured confidence

that oure father, after that he
hath nouryshed vs this daye,
woll not fayle vs to morowe.
Now how moch aboundaunce
so euer of goodes through his
benefite we haue, yet it behoueth
vs to aske our daily bread
thynkyng on this wyse, that all
our substaunce is nothyng, but
so farforth as god by powryng
forth his blessynge, shall prospere
and encrease, & that which
is in our hādes is none of ours
but so farforth as god bestoweth
it vnto vs and suffreth the
vse therof in our handes frome
tyme to tyme. In that we saye,
Our bread, is hyghly declared
the boūtyousnes of god, which
maketh y• to be ours, which by

no reason was dewe vnto vs.
Finally in that we desyre it to
be gyuen vs, it is meant that it
is the pure & free gyfte of god,
frome whense so euer it come to
vs, thoughe it seme neuer soo
moche to be gotten by our scyence
and propre industrye.
               
               
                  The fyfthe.
                  And forgyue vs oure
trespasses / as we forgyue
theym that trespasse agaynste
vs.
                  IN this petition we aske release,
pardon, and forgiuenesse
of synnes to be receyued
at goddes handes, a thyng

doubtles right necessary to all
men and women without exception,
And we call them dettes,
(for so signifieth the greke and
also the latine worde) bycause
we owe god a punyshement for
them as a pryce or peny worth
due for the same. But by noo
meanes can we make this payment
good, oneles we be discharged
by this forgyuenesse
whiche is the free pardone of
his mercy. We aske this pardone
to be gyuen vs, euen as
we forgyue our detters, that is,
as we spare them and forgyue
them, of whome we haue bene
in any thynge, eyther harmed,
sharpely handled, or contumeliously
checked. This condition

is here added, not that by
our forgyuynge of other mens
trespasses agaynst vs, we may
or can deserue goddes pardon,
but it is here put for a 
                        •
                     ygne &
token to acertayne vs, that so
truely our synnes be pardoned
vs of god, as we semblably in
our owne consciences forgyue
other, in case our hart be cleane
purged and voyd of all hatred,
enuye, and vengeaūce. On the
contrary parte, we be warned
that they be shakē of and expulsed
frome the nombre of gods
chyldren, so many as be redy to
reuenge, harde to forgyue and
that styffely beare malice in
their hartes ayenst their neyghbours,
For all suche are hereby

monyshed not to be ones so hardy
as to call god theyr father,
nor pray to escape gods wrath,
lyth in theyr own stomake they
beare wrath and displeasure agaynste
other. yea Chryste expressely
sayth,Mat. 6. that onles we for
gyue men theyr offences, the father
wol neuer forgiue vs ours
Which thyng he also teacheth
by the parable of the kyng and
his seruauntes.Mat. 18. Finally he wol
haue forgiue vs our neighbour
not ones or twyse,Mat. 18. no not seuen
tymes only, but seuenty tymes
seuen tymes, meanynge herby,
we oughte contynually frome
tyme to tyme to forgyue oure
brother.
               
               
                  
                  The syxte.
                  And let vs not be led into
temptation / but delyuer
vs from euyll. Amen.
                  IN this demaūd, we do not
requyre, that we shulde neuer
fele temptations, for
by them rather it is our profyte
to be styrred and rubbed on the
backe, lest through ouermoche
rest, we mought waxe sloggardes,
for the lorde tempteth his
chosen dayly, chastysyng them
by reproche, pouertie, trouble,
and other kyndes of crucyfyenge.
But this oure prayer is,1. Cor. 10.
that with the temptatiō he wol
make vs a waye out, so as we

be not ouercome and pressed
downe of any temptations, but
that by his powre enstrengthened
we may stand sure agaynst
all the power of our aduersaries
wherwith they assaulte vs.
Also that we taken to his gouernaunce,
halowed by his spirituall
graces, and fensed with
his protectiō may stande styffe
agaynste the deuyll, death, hell
gates, and the hole kyngdome
of the deuyll, and this is to be
deliuered from euyll. We must
marke also howe God wol that
our prayers be shapen. Truely
we muste shape them after the
rule of charitie, for so hathe he
taught vs to praye, not for our
owne behoufe without any regarde

of our bretherne, but he
commaūdeth vs to be euen as
busye for theyr cōmoditie, edificatyon
and profyte, as we wold
be for our owne.
               
            
            
               Continuance of prayer.
               THis then it behoueth vs
to loke vpon, that we go
not about to bynd god to
any circumstancies, lyke as we
be taught in this prayer, nor to
assigne him any law, or apoynt
hym any condycyon. For afore
we conceyue any prayer for vs,
we fyrste requyre and forespeke
that his wyll be done, whereby
nowe we subdue oure wylle
to his, that as with a brydell

nowe restreyned, it shulde not
p̄sume to force god to a course
or trade. If our myndes ones
brought to suche obedience, we
suffre our selues to be ordred at
tharbitremēt of gods prouisiō,
easely we shal lerne to continue
in prayer, and referrynge oure
requestes vnto the lorde, pacyently
to awayt his pleasure, beynge
assured that god is alway
present with vs, though it seme
not so, and that when he seeth
his tyme, he wol declare that he
gaue no deafe eares to our praiers.
That yf after longe awaytyng,
our mynd cānot attayne
what it hath profyted by prayer,
nor fele any frute goten therby:
yet our fayth shall certyfye

vs of that, that by felynge we
coulde not perceyue, euen how
we haue obteyned that expedient
was for vs. And thus shall
faythe worke, that in pouertie
we maye possesse aboundance,
and in trouble comforte, for yf
all togyther go to wreck & fayle
vs, yet shal god neuer fayle vs,
neuer forsake vs, sithens he can
not disapoynte the awaytynge
and longe suffraūce of his, him
alone may we haue in steade of
all thynges, for he cōteyneth in
hym all goodnes, whiche without
doubte in tyme to come, he
woll shewe vs all at large and
most fully.
            
            
               
               Of Sacramentes, wherfore
they properly serue.
               SAcramentes be ordeyned
that both before god and
man they shulde be exercyses
of our fayth. Before the
lorde they exercyse our faythe,
whyles they establysshe it in
gods truthe, for where as the
Lorde perceyued it expedyent
for the ignoraunt of our fleshe,
he dyd setforth heauēly mysteries
to be beholden vnder carnall
elementes. Not that any
suche powers be gyuen to the
selfe natures of thynges, as be
propowned to vs in sacramentes,
but that by the lordes word
they be signed hereunto. For y•
promesse cōmeth alwaye afore,

whiche promes is conteyned in
the worde, then foloweth the
token to strengthen & seale the
promesse, & to make it of more
authoritie amonges vs, euē as
the Lorde forseech, that it is expedient
for the capacite of oure
weakenesse. For vndoubted so
smal and weake is oure faithe,
that except it be propped vp on
euery syde, & born vp by al meanes
and wayes possible, anone
it wolle qwayle, be shaken a
peeces, and ouerthrowē. Nowe
this fayth is also amonges mē
exercised by sacramentes, whyles
by the same it goeth opēlye
to shewe her selfe to the worlde,
and is styrred vp to render due
prayses to the Lorde,
            
            
               
               What a sacrament is, and
how many there be.
               A Sacramēt is therfore properly
an outewarde signe,
wherin God representeth
and wytnesseth his good wyll
towardes vs, to susteyne the
weakenesse of our fayth. Or an
other waye more shorte & also
more playne, A sacrament is a
wytnesse of gods fauoure, declared
by an outwarde sygne.
Now there be dyuers holso me
sacramentes in the church, and
namely seuen recounted of the
fathers, Matrimonie, Baptisme,
Confirmation, Penaunce,
Eucharistia comonly called the
sacrament of the aultare, Orders,

and extreme vnction.
               Matrimonye,Wedolcke god hym selfe
did fyrste institute in paradyse,Gene. 1.
and saynt Paule calleth it honorable
in all thynges.Hebre. 13.
               
               By penaūce we atteyne the
hyghe benefite of absolution,Penaūce
neyther oughte we to neglecte
the power or keyes of the churche,
sythe to it Chryste sayeth,
Whose synnes so euer ye forgyue
shalbe forgyuen,Iohan. 20. & whose
synnes ye reteyne shalbe reteyned.Luc. 10.
And agayn he saith, Who
heareth you, heareth me.
               The sacrament of orders,Order. is
wherby, by layeng on of y• handes,
persons of suche qualities
and condicions, as Paule describeth
to Timothie1. Timo. 3. and TiteTit. 1.
                  
shulde be called and elected not
only to ministre sacramentes
but moche rather to preache
gods worde purely & syncerely
to the people.
               ConfirmationConfyr. and extremeExtreme vnction.
vnction the auncient fathers
of the churche takyng occasion
and groundyng themselfes vpon
the doynges and actes of
thappostles haue receiued.
But of baptisme & Eucharistia
bycause they be the principall
sacramentes & in the new testament
instituted expressely by
Chryste hymselfe, I intende
somewhat more at large to intreate.
            
            
               
               Of Baptisme.
               BAptisme is gyuen vs of
God, bothe to serue oure
faythe before hym, and to
serue our professiō before men.
Fayth hath eye to the promyse,
wherby the mercyful father offerethe
vs the felawshyp of his
Christe, that we endowed with
hym myghte be partakers of
his goodes. And two thinges
it chiefly representeth vnto vs,
the clensynge,
                     
                        •
                     urgation. whiche we haue
in Christes bloude, and the

                     •
                  leynge of our fleshe,Mortificatiō. whiche we
haue obteyned throughe his
deathe. For the Lorde cōmaū
                  ded
his to be baptised into remyssyon

of synnes.Ephe. 5. And Paule
teacheth that the churche is halowed
of Christ her spouse, and
washed in the lauer of water
in the worde of lyfe. Furthermore
he declareth that we be
baptysed into Christes deathe,Roma. 6.
buryed with hym, to thintēt we
might walke in newnes of lyfe,
wherby it is not meaned that
the cause or power of clensyng
and of newe byrth is in the water,
but onely that in this sacrament
is perceiued a knowledge
of suche gyftes: when we be accounted
to take, obteyne & purchase
that, whiche we beleue
to be gyuen vs of the Lorde,
whither we fyrste espye it, or
whyther it were knowen to vs

afore, and be here more certaynly
enformed of the same. Nowe
as touchyng our profession before
men, this Sacrament also
serueth, for it is a marke or token
wherby we openly professe
that we wyll be accompted amonges
the people of god, that
with all other godly personnes
by lyke relygion we worshyppe
that same one god. Syth then
in Baptysme the couenaunt of
the lord is specyally made with
vs: therefore of good ryght we
baptise also our infauntes in
that they be felowes and partakers
with vs of the euerlasting
couenaunt, wherein the Lorde
promyseth hym selfe to be the
God and graciouse lorde, not

to vs onely, but to oure seede
also.
            
            
               Of the lordes souper, or
sacrament of the
aultare.
               UNto what ende the mystery
of this sacrament,1. Cor. 11.
whiche saynt Paule calleth the
lordes souper, & is called of the
fathers Eucharistia and Synaxis,
was ordeyned, & whervnto
it serueth, the promesse
there added euydētly declareth
which is to acertayne vs, that
the lordes body was ones so offered,
so betrayed for our sakes
that now it is ours, yea and euermore
shall be, and that his
bloude was ones so sprynkled

and shed for vs, that it shulde
be ours for euermore. The bodyly
eye seeth but the sygnes &
figures of bread and wyne, but
the inwarde eye of fayth vnder
those signes seeth how the lord
gyueth the true partakynge of
his body and bloude, For all
thoughe he beynge now taken
vp into heauen, kepeth his residence
in heauen and no longer
in earthe, I meane in personall
and humayne lykenes, yet
no distaūce of place can let him
to fede his faythefull with his
owne selfe, & so to worke that
they (thoughe heauen & earthe
be neuer so far asunder) shulde
yet haue moste presente felowshyp
and companye with hym.

And hereof haue we a lesson gyuen
vs in this sacrament so certayne
and manifeste, that we
muste fastly beleue that chryst
with all his rychesse is here gyuen
and presented vnto vs, no
lesse then yf he stode euen personally
present, to be sene as he is
in his maiestie with our eyes &
to be felte with our handes, yea
and that with suche power and
myght, that not onely he bryngeth
to our soules an vndoubted
truste of euerlastynge lyfe,
but maketh vs sure also of the
immortalitie of our flesh beyng
quyckened of his immortall
fleshe, & after a maner takynge
part of his immortalitie. Wherfore
vnder the sygnes of bread

and wyne be presented and ministred
vnto vs the body and
bloude, to thintent we myghte
lerne y• they be not onely ours,
but also serue vnto vs for lyfe
and nourysshyng. Thus when
we se this most sacred and mysticall
bread, anone we must cō
                  ceyue
this similitude, that lyke
as breade nourysheth, susteyneth,
and preserueth the lyfe of
our natural body: so is the body
of Chryste the fode, comfort,
and defence of our gostly lyfe.
When we se the forme of wine,
loke what profyte wyne bryngeth
to mans bodye, the same
muste we recken, spyritually to
be brought vnto vs in Chrystes
bloude. Now, this mystery

as it is a proufe and declaratiō
of the great bounty of God towardes
vs: so it ought to monysshe
vs, that we be not vnkynd
for the same his goodnes
and excedyng liberalitie shewed
vnto vs, but rather as oure
duetie is, auaunce the same wt
prayses, and magnifye it with
thankesgyuyng. And furthermore
that we shulde embrace
one of vs an other with suche
an vnite, as we se the membres
of one body knyt and fastened
amonges theym selues. For
there can be no quycker spurre
to sturre brotherly loue amonges
vs, then whiles Chryste,
thus gyuynge hym selfe to vs
doth not onely allure vs by his

exemple, euery one of vs frely
to yelde and gyue hym selfe to
other, but also lyke as he maketh
hym selfe commune amonges
vs all, so in hym he maketh
vs all to be as one. But wolde
god we wolde lerne to measure
& to contemplate in our mynde
the greatnes of this so hyghe a
sacrament gyuen vs of god.
wolde god I saye we consydered
howe fowle a synne ingratytude
is, how horrible peynes
and punishemētes do ensue of
the vnreuerent handlynge and
ꝓhanation of this sacramēt.
Neither is it to be thought y•
those moste graue thretninges
y• s. Paule pronounceth be frustrat
& voyd.1. Cor. 11. For thus he saith.

Wherfore who so euer eateth
this bread and dryncketh the
cuppe of the lorde vnworthely,
shall be gyltie of the body and
bloude of the lorde. Let a man
therfore examine hym selfe and
so let hym eate of that breade &
dryncke of that cuppe. For he
that eateth and dryncketh vnworthyly,
eateth and dryncketh
his owne damnation, not decernynge
the body of the lorde.
            
            
               Of the Pastors and herdmen
of the churche, and of
theyr power.
               FOr as moche as the lorde
wyll that bothe his worde
and the Sacramentes be ministred

by men vnto vs: it behoueth
Curates or herdmen to
be set in offyce ouer the church,
which with pure doctrine may
enforme the people bothe pryuely
and apertly, ministre Sacramentes,
and with good exemple
instruct men vnto holynes
and purenes of lyfe. Who
so despiceth this institution &
this order, be vnruely and disobedient
not agaynst men but
agaynst god, in that they factiously
withdrawe them selues
from the felowshyp of the churche
which without this ministerie,
by no meanes can stande,
for that hath no lytell authoritie,
that the Lorde ones witnessed,
sayenge, that he hym selfe

and that he is caste oute,
when they be caste out, And to
thintent theyr office shulde be
no vyle thynge ne vnregarded,
they be endowed with a special
commaundement of byndynge
and loosynge,

                   hauynge therto
a promesse, that what so euer in
earthe they bynde or loose,
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      20. the
same is bounde and loosed in
heauen. And Chryst hym self
expounynge his worde declareth
that to bynde, is to holde
synnes, and to loose, is to release
them. Nowe by what fasshyon
they loose, the apostle expouneth,
when he saythe,
                     
                        〈…〉
                     
                   that
the gospell is a power to saue
euery beleuer. Agayne what

waye they bynde, he declareth
when he saith that the Apostles haue a redy vengeaūce against
all disobediēce.2. Cor. 10. For the summe
of the gospell is that we be īeruauntes
of synne and death, &
that we be losed and made free
through the raunsome whiche
is in Chryst Iesu, and as many
as do not receyue hym for their
redemer, be bounde with newe
bondes of a greater condemnation.
But we muste remembre
that all this power which scripture
gyueth to pastours and
byshoppes is conteyned within
the mynistery of the worde, for
Chryst gaue not properly this
power to men, but to his word,
ordeynynge men onely the mynisters

thereof. Wherefore in
goddes worde whereof they be
made disposers & layers out,
boldely let them ieoparde euen
all thynges, and constreyne all
the power, glory, and pryde of
the worlde to stowpe and obeye
vnto it, by it let them cōmaund
all men, from the hyghest to the
loweste, let them buylde Chrystes
house, pull down Satans
kyngdom, fede the shepe, staye
the wolues, teache and exhorte
those that wyll lerne, reproue
the stubberne: but all togyther
in the worde, from whiche word
yf they swarue to theyr owne
dreames, and fanses: they be
no longer estemed for pastours
and shepeherdes, but rather

(for asmoche as they be pestilē
wolues) ought to be dryuen awaye
and deposed. For Chryste
commaundeth none other to be
hearde, then suche as teache vs
the thynges that they haue taken
of his worde.
            
            
               Of mens traditions.
               SIthe we haue a generall
sentence of Paule,1. Cor. 14 yt all
thynges in thassembles
& churches should be done comely
& in good order: ciuile ordinaūces,
wherby as with bondes
an order and comly fasshyon
is kepte in the companye
of the Christians, and a concorde
thereby conserued, ought
not to be reckened amonges

mens traditions: but must rather
be referred vnto the rule
of the Apostle, so that they be
not beleued as thinges necessary
to our saluation, nor bynd
the consciences to any superstition
through them, nor be kept
as any worshyppynge of god,
nor that any holynes be reposed
in them. But such ordinaū
                  ces
as vnder a tytle of spirituall
lawes be thruste vpon vs,
to bynde oure consciences, as
thynges necessary to gods honour,
all suche lawes I saye
ought we earnestly to resyste,
for they do not only ouerthrow
the libertie whiche Christ purchased
vs, but also dymme the
true relygion, and defile gods

maiesty, who alone wol raygne
in our consciences by his word
Let this then abyde for a sure
gron̄d,1. Cor. 3. that all thinges be ours
and we Chrystes, and that god
in vayne is worshypped where
be taught doctrines,Mat. 15 the commaundementes
of men.
            
            
               Of excommunication.
               EXcōmunication is, wherby
notable horemongers,
aduouterers, vsurers, extortioners,
spoylers, rouers, pyrates,
brallers, ryoters, dronkardes,
seditious persons, wasters,
after they haue ben admonished,
and do not amende, be
reiecte and banysshed from the

company of the faythfull,Mat. 18. accordynge
to the lordes cōmaundement,
not that the churche casteth
them vnto perpetuall ruyne
and despayre, but it dainneth
theyr lyfe & maners and
excepte they amende, the churche
ascerteyneth them of theyr
damnatiō. This order is therfore
necessary amōges the faithfull,
that sith the churche is the
body of Chryst,

                     . 1. it ought not to
be defyled with such stynkyng
members, which redounde vnto
the shame of their head. And
moreouer least by company of
suche a naughty sorte (as it cō
                  monly
chaūseth) the good also
myght he corrupte, It is also
profitable for them selues, that

their lewdnes be thus chastised
which, where as other wayes
by sufferaunce, they wold waxe
more wilful and obstinate, now
dryuen thus to shame, myghte
lerne to amende, whiche thyng
yf they can be wonne vnto, the
churche gentyllye receyueth
theym into her felowshyppe agayne,
and to the partakynge
of that same vnite, from whens
they were banysshed and shut
out. And least any man should
proudly despyse the iudgement
of the churche, or lytell regarde
that he by the churche is thus
condemned, the Lorde wytnesseth
that this iudgemente
of the faythfull is none other
thynge then the publysshynge

of his owne sentence,

gods worde, wherby they may
damne the froward, they haue
agayne Gods worde whereby
they maye receyue those that retourne
vnto grace.
            
            
               Of ciuile rulers and
gouernours.
               THe Lord wytnesseth, that
not onely he allowed temporall
gouernaūces and
the office of magistrates, but
also for that with suche honorable
auctoritie he setteth forth
theyr dignitie: hyghly he commendeth
the same vnto vs, for

he assureth vs y• it is the worke
of his wysdome, that kynges
