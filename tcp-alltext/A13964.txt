            A TREATISE CONCERNING THE APPOINTING OF A IVDGE OF THE CONTROVERSIES both of the Popiſh, and Reformed Religion.
            
               HOw not onlie odious and diſdainful, The entrance. but alſo dangerous a matter it is, in theſ
                  •
                daies, to meddle with the controuerſies of religion (Gentle Reader) both the crueltie of many mightie ones, and alſo the broiles & ſtirres betwéene man and man, doe too too much declare. For ſuch is the blindenes of men, and ſo great is their raſhnes, to runne and ruſh on to their own deſtructiō, that as there was neuer any nation ſo rude, but would haue taken it in euill part to be inſtructed in religion: So at this day a man ſhall finde many which haue ſo hardened themſelues in that religion wherein they were borne, which their forefathers haue obſerued, which they ſee to make for their dignities and aduauncement, and which they perceiue to be mainteyned by the greater part of men: that they wil not endure once to heare the iudgement and doctrine of the contrarie ſide, but contrarie to all law, both of God and man, doe condemne ſhunne, and abhore it, being neither heard, nor vnderſtoode by them.
            Moreouer, certaine Epicures and graceles men alſo, do

not a little trouble the godlie, which growe to ſuch outrage, that they thinke they deſerue great commendation, if they can conceale and hide their owne iudgement, in the matter of ſaluation, and ſcoffe and frumpe at all religion of other men.
            Hereunto is added the preſumption of the Popes, Cardinals, Biſhops, and other Prelates, who although they ſée that many corruptions, both of doctrine, and alſo of ceremonies and diſcipline, are crept in, yet they accounte it an hainous offence, if any man, not content with their generall and confuſed faith, dares to examine the doctrine of men by the rule of the Prophets and Apoſtles writinges, and by ſearching the Scriptures, to ſéeke out the way of ſaluation in them.
            Which things although they thus ſtande, yet ought all the godlie to be ſtrengthened in minde, and encouraged againſt ſo many offences, to yeelde a reaſon of their beléefe, to the ende that both the wicked maie be made vnexcuſable before Gods iudgement ſeate, and that thoſe, which not ſo much vpon froward malice, as by reaſon of their firſt trayning vp, or following of their forfathers, or finally through loue of preferments, haue condemned ſincere doctrine, that ſuch (I ſay) may not ſticke to let themſelues be ouercome with the mightie worde of God. For Ezechias, (a moſt religious prince) is commended, becauſe neither by the example of his father Achas, profeſſing a contrarie religion, neyther by that bringing vp which he had from his cradle, nor by the highnes of his Royall ſtate, nor finallie, by the preſident of other kings, and multitude of men following an other contrarie religion, hee could be withdrawen and diſcouraged from learning himſelfe the ſincere religion, out of the wel-ſprings of Iſrael: that is to ſay, out of the word of God, conteined in the writings of the Prophets: or from enioyning his Subiects to obſerue and practiſe the ſame, when he had learned it himſelfe, and cauſed it to be purged

from all corruptions. For he had learned the commaundement of the Lord, wherein he geueth in charge, that all the faithfull be bound not to walke in the commandementes of their fathers, nor to doe their iudgements, but to walke in the precepts of the Lord only, and to kéepe and do his iudgements. Neither ought the credite either of traditions, or of Councels, or Fathers, or myracles, or ſucceſſion, no nor of an Angell from heauen, to withdrawe any man from this ſearching, and peruſing of the word of God: for it was no leſſe wiſelie then rightly ſaid, More credite is to be geuen to one skilful in the Scriptures, and alleadging the catholique 
               Panormitane, and Gerſon. 
               authoritie of the Canonicall Scripture, then either to the expoſition of the Pope, or to a generall Councel. By all this therefore it is manifeſt, how, not onelie harde, but alſo dangerous a thing it is, to deal in the matter of religion.
            Which charge if I had taken vpon me, being not forced with any neceſſitie to ſpeake, but moued thereunto eyther with vaine-glorie, or fooliſh raſhnes: doubtleſſe I could not auoide iuſt reproofe. But now ſith I haue ſtepped foorth to ſpeake, not voluntarilie, but by conſtraint, addreſſed thereunto not with ambition, but with loue of the trueth, not vnaduiſedly, but vpon good deliberation, not with ſlaunders, and cauilles, but with authoritie of the word of God: Truely I nothing feare, that this my honeſt meaning to mainteine the trueth, ſhould be imputed to me as a faulte, Onely this I requeſt you (gentle Readers) whoſoeuer are deſirous of eternall life, that you bring not hether any preiudice, or foreſtalled opinion, that you condemne not a cauſe vnheard, contrarie to all lawe, both of God and man, and that you leane not to any authoritie or excellencie of men: but compare matter with matter, reaſon with reaſon, argument with argument, by the rule of the worde of God: neither doe you conſider the perſon that ſpeaketh, but the matter that is ſpoken, with a godly deſire to learne out

the truth. And then I will not ſticke to abide the curteous cenſures of the good, that if it be prooued, that theſe thinges are agréeable to the trueth of God, yee may yéeld vnto the Lord: if not, ye may refuſé them, as things contrarie to the heauenlie oracles or teſtimonies of the word. But that I may not ſéeme to roue from the matter: I wil preſcribe certaine bounds, which neither I, in ſpeaking, nor you in reading, may ouer-paſſe. But before this be done, I will firſt ſet downe the whole ſtate of the matter. Hearken ye kings and Princes, and all ye inhabitants of the world. There is a great controuerſie in hand: For almightie God, the moſt gracious father of all the faithfull, hath promiſed to all men that beleeue, as to his children, beloued in his onely begotten ſonne, he hath promiſed to them, I ſay, the kingdome of heauen. This promiſe of a heauenlie inheritance hath hee enrolled in the publique records of the olde and new teſtament, and committed it to his heires, being ſealed with the ſeale of the Sacraments.
            Now he hath annexed to theſe letters of his will, certain conditions, as a father: to the performance whereof, his heires ſhould be bound. Now the children falling at variance, are deuided (to omit the reſt) into two ſides, extremelie diſagréeing among themſelues. The one acknowledgeth the Pope for their head, and as it were, the Executor of the will maker, God: the other acknowledgeth it not. They ſtriue for the poſſeſſion of the kingdome of heauen, and for the right of the true church, which each ſide chalengeth as their due. The Plaintife in this caſe is the Biſhoppe of Rome, with all thoſe which take parte with the See of Rome. The Defendantes are thoſe which receiue not the Biſhop of Rome, but profeſſe themſelues Goſpellers, and men of the reformed religion.
            Both of them bring their allegations, their writings, ſealed with the kings ſeale, and alſo their witneſſes: but both ſides kéepe great ſtirre for the aſſigning of a Iudge.

For both deſire that he ſhould be appointed Iudge, whom they hope would be more fauourable to their cauſe. The Romiſh See would ſtande to the iudgement of the Popes, The pleading and exception of both ſides, for the aſsignning of a Iudge. traditions, councels, fathers, and miracles, and ſaith that yet neuertheleſſe, ſhee doeth not ſhutte out the worde of God.
            The Goſpellers on the other ſide refuſe theſe Iudges: for they alledge that the Pope cannot haue the place both of a partie, and a Iudge too, eſpeciallie ſith hee is charged with ſo many crimes. Traditions they reiect as ſuſpected Iudges, and not of ſufficient credite. And as for Councels, Fathers, Myracles, and ſucceſſion of perſons, they ſay that they admitte them not as Iudges, but as ſworne witneſſes: wherein notwithſtanding, they proteſt, that they wil ſo far foorth only receiue the authoritie of theſe witneſſes, as their euidence ſhall agrée with the publique déede.
            The Sée of Rome accuſeth the Goſpellers, (for let mée with good leaue of both ſides, vſe theſe termes that are now made common) that they haue reuolted frō the true church, inuented a new doctrine, and newe ceremonies, and haue but a fewe yeares ſince, picked this quarrell with her, and that therefore the kingdome, and claime of heauen doeth belong, not to them, but to her, by the lawe of God.
            The Goſpellers replie that they haue departed, not from the true Church, but from the Sinagogue of the malignant, and that they haue not coyned a newe doctrine, or newe ceremonies, but that they holde that Religion, by the which the faithfull, euer ſince the beginning of the worlde, haue beene ſaued.
            That they were in déede of later yeares oppreſſed by their tyrannie, as Abell was by Cain, Iſaak by Iſmaell, and Iacob by Eſau: ſo that they were compelled to hide themſelues, but that now they haue (like the Moone) recouered their light, and that they will by lawe recouer their birthright
            
               
In this Court of ſonnes going to lawe one with another, there is great concourſe and throng of people, a great hurlie burlie and ſtirre ariſeth, they growe from wordes to blowes, to murthers, to burnings, to warres, to bloudſhed, and in a word, to all kinde of torments. Sometimes this ſide ſéemeth to haue the better hand, ſometimes that, and the more that the Goſpellers are ſuppreſſed, tormented and burned, the more doe they boaſt that they growe, encreaſe, preuaile and triumph. In the meane ſeaſon they proteſt, that the matter ought to be tried, not by violence, but by courſe of lawe. They appeale to God himſelfe, beſides whō (they ſay) that they admitte none for chiefe and iudge. That the Will maker himſelfe may determine this controuerſie by his holy word. And that this may be the better done, they appeale to a Generall Councell, wherein it may be lawfull fréelie to reade and ſcanne the déede of the will, and therehence to finde out the minde of the Will maker. The See of Rome on the other ſide, pleadeth that ſhe hath not a fewe times aſſembled Generall Councels, wherin the writings haue béene examined, and found to haue geuen iudgement on her ſide, for the title of the true Church. The Goſpellers denie that thoſe Councels were generall, and frée, becauſe the Papiſts would not permitte them fréely to geue an account of their faith, neither would heare their defence, but contrarie to all law, either of God or man, were themſelues both parties and Iudges, and con
                  〈…〉
                their brethrens cauſe before they heard it, or vnderſtood it: and therfore they proteſt that they haue not béene caſt in their ſuite, but will ſo long be heires of the poſſeſſion bequeathed vnto them, while they perfourme the couenants conteined in the publicke déede of the will, according to the appointment of the will-maker. And in the meane ſpace they ſay, that they are readie to waite for the righteous Iudge, euen the Lorde Chriſt, who ſhall come to iudge both the quicke & the dead: and to ende theſe long contentions in ſuch ſort, that he will

render to thoſe ye ſhal ouercome, the reward of eternall life, but to thoſe ye ſhalbe ouercome, euerlaſting condemnation.
            Thus far onely haue both ſides procéeded in iudgement. The matter lying in queſtion. Now then the queſtion is, to which party the inheritance of euerlaſting life, and the name of the true church is to be adiudged. Surely, the iudgement héer of peremptorily belongeth onely vnto Chriſt, which he wil doo in that laſt iudgement & court, wherunto a thouſand, fiue hundred, foure ſcore and eleuen yéeres ſince, he hath ſummoned all the worlde, and which doubtleſſe ſhalbe held before it be long. But take héede O ye Kings & Princes, and inhabitants of the whole earth, that in the mean time ye take parte with the better cauſe, leaſt if you be careles to decide this controuerſie, Chriſt héereafter doo mightilye iudge you in the laſt iudgement. And that this may be doon by due form of law, goe to I pray you, ſhew your ſelues indifferent Iudges, and condemne not a cauſe being not heard, but if you haue heard the cauſe of the See of Rome with the right eare, (as was méet) doo you likewiſe heare the doctrine of the Goſpellers with the leſt, leaſt ye be found farre vnlike ye great Alexander, 
               Alexander. who heard yt ſpeech of the accuſer with the right eare, but kept the left eare ſtopped for the defence of the accuſed.
            Firſt therefore I will rehearce the iudgement of both parties, out of the writings of them both, worde for worde: The ſetting downe and diuiſion of this Treatiſe. neither (truſt me) will I adde or diminiſh any thing, which is not to be found in the ſame forme of words, in the bookes of both ſides. Next I will ſhewe the reaſons wherefore the Goſpellers doo refuſe to admitte for Iudges, the popes themſelues, the Councels, fathers, traditions, & other ſuch like witneſſes, but would haue all the controuerſies of the Church to be diſcuſſed by the written woord of God. And then, if you ſhall vnderſtand theſe thinges with conſcience, and without partialitie, I will not be againſt it, but that you may imbrace and follow that which is better of theſe two.

                              The reformed Church profeſſeth that there is nothing neceſſarie to ſaluation, which is not contained in the canonicall Scriptures.
                           
                              But the Church of Rome ſaith, that the ſcripture is maimed, vncertaine, like to a noſe of war, to a leaden rule: that without the authoritie of the Church it hath no more ſtrength then Aeſops fables, that it is the cauſe of hereſies applyable to time, and that therefore the common people are to be reſtrained from it.

            This is the doctrin of both parties, the deciding of which controuerſie the See of Rome would ſubmit to Popes, counſels, fathers, the Church, and traditions. But the Goſpellers refuſe theſe iudges, and alleage their reaſons why they reiect each of them, the which that you would patiently hears, I entreate and beſeech you, as you will be ſaued (good Readers) whoſoeuer of you, in this priuat and domeſticall war of diſagreeing bretheren, are deſirous to take parte with the better cauſe. And as for the firſt forte The Popes can not be iudges of religion, for eight reaſons. of Iudges: The defendants ſay, that they cannot admitte the Popes for iudges of this controuerſie for moſt waightie cauſes, for they ſay that they haue beene not only long ſince accuſed, but alſo proued giltie by the greateſt part of Chriſtendome, namely, England, Scotland, Denmark, Swethlande, the greater parte of Germanie, Heluetia, Fraunce Tranſiluania, yea and of thoſe Churches and countryes alſo which in Africa, Egipt, Syria, Greece, the Eaſte,

and other coaſtes of the world doe recken themſelues amongſt the Chriſtian Churches, they haue, I ſay, by all theſe, bene conuicted of eight moſt heynous crimes, that is to ſay, of impietie, or prophane irreligiouſnes, of vſurped Tyranny, of corrupting Religiō, of Sacri

               Secondly they proue the impietie of Popes by this, that 2. proofe of impietie. Benon Caridinalis.
                they haue often times made a mocke euen of their owne Religion. For Gregory the ſeuenth brought one to this reſolution by promiſing him mony, that by letting downe a beame vpon the head of the Emperour Henrie the third, while he was praying in the Church, hee ſhould cruſh him to peces. Which while the executioner of this miſcheefe made haſt to doe, the boord breaking vnder the beames, both the ſtone, and the Popes man fell downe. The ſame Pope Hildebrand aſking councell at the Deuils againſt the Emperour, was not afraide to caſt the Sacrament of the Lords body into ye fire: the Cardinals ſpeaking againſt it: which thing the Biſhop of Parme did openly publiſh.

            Thirdly they ſay, that the impietie of the Popes is declared by this alſo, that they haue ſet vp aboue three ſcore and fiue Religious orders, each of which haue their ſeuerall faſhions of hooded attires, and their diſtinct rules and rites of Religion. The number of 
                  •
               riers in theſe orders is thought to amount to fiue hundred thouſand in Europe onely: which may eaſily be gathered by this, that the Generall of the Franciſcanes did often times promiſe the Pope

            The ſecond cauſe for which the Goſpellers denie that they will acknowledge the popes for their Iudges, they alledge to be the ſinne of tirannie vſurped ouer the Church.

            Secondly, in that they haue chalenged vnto themſelues dominion ouer the whole world, and all ciuil magiſtrates: for as for the donation of Conſtantine, wherby they cōfirm their ſoueraign authoritie, beſides that Antoninus biſhop of Florēce, N. Cuſanus, L. Valla, Volateranus, AEneas Siluius, and other writers moe, which in other pointes were great proctors for the papacie, were not afraid ſome late hundred yeares ſince, to diſproue it, the Goſpellers auouch, that they can alſo conuince it of forgerie, by theſe reaſons: For ſith no approued writer maketh mention of this donation, ſith Euſebius and others, doe witnes that Conſtantine did deuide the thrée coaſtes of the world to his thrée ſonnes, ſith the inſtruments or deeds of grant ſet forth by Volateranus, and in the decretals, doe far differ, and their ſtile is much vnlike, ſith it is ridiculous that Peter & Paul ſhould appeare to Conſtantine in a dreame, and that he ſhould worſhip thē for gods, ſith Cōſtantine neuer had the leproſie, neither was he baptized at Rome by Silueſter, but at Hicomedia by 
                  
                     •
                  uſebius, ſith it is wicked to ſay, that the hand of god was ſeen of Conſtantine, ſith he could not geue greater iuriſdiction to the pope, then he had himſelfe, neither could geue him autoritie ouer the patriarck of Conſtantinople, there being then no ſuch citie: and finally, ſith thoſe giftes which in that euidence are ſaide to be geuen to the pope by Conſtantine, are the badges of Antichriſt: By al theſe ſeueral, and thoſe moſt forcible demonſtrations it is cōcluded, that ye ſame donation was not granted by Conſtantine, but forged by the popes.
            Now in thoſe words which Chriſt ſpake to Peter, & other miniſters of the word, that they ſhould féed his ſhéep, he appointeth to them, not a ciuil iuriſdiction, but a church-miniſterie: for in another place he nippeth, and beateth back the pride & ambition of the apoſtles, deſiring ſuperiority, when he ſaith; The kings of the natious beare rule, but it ſhal not be ſo with you.

For there are decrées extant concerning the popes, that they are not men, but Gods, that they may not bée iudged by any mortall man, yt they may diſpenſe againſt the Apoſtle, chaunge the nature of things, make ſome what of nothing, make righteouſnes of vnrighteouſneſſe: But in the meane ſpace how true theſe things are, the matter it ſelfe doth ſhew. For the Lord himſelfe witneſſeth yt there is but one forme of Religiō, namelie that which is recorded in the writings of the Prophets, and Apoſtles, whereunto nothing may be added or taken away, no not by an Angell. But the pope teacheth that ye order of the church conſiſteth in the traditions of our forefathers, of the which ſort are Agnus Deis, chriſtening of belles, prayers of Saints, ſingle life of prieſts (as they call them) the taking away of the cup in the Lordes Supper, the vſing of a ſtraunge toung, the Maſſe, pardons and other ſuch ſtuffe: the which although they affirme to ha

               e bene conuayed ouer to them from the Apoſtles by tradition: yet that moſt of them were inuented by them ſelues, the recordes of auncient ſtories doe plainlie proue. For pope Innocent forbad the cup in the Lordes Supper by the decrée of the Coūſell of Laterane, and inſtituted the Eaſter-Communion. But Eugenius the fourth decréed the contrarie. Innocentius the third, and Honorius the third, ordained that the Sacramentall bread ſhould be curiouſlie kept in the church for ſundrie vſes: But pope Clement would not ſuffer it to be reſerued to the next day.

               Vitellianus the ſecond, and Agatho the firſt, appointed the Maſſe to be ſaid in Latin: Nicolaus the firſt ſuffered the Slauonians and Polonians to haue Maſſe ſaid in their own tongues. Alexander the ſecond decréed that Maſſe ſaid by a Of the Maſſe of ſuch as kept concubines. Diſt. 32. praeter hoc, itē Nullus.

Sacriledge and Simony: for the which they cannot admit the Popes for Iudges: for it is apparant that for voide liuings, preuentions, ſurrenders vpon fauour, commendations, diſpenſations for age, order, regularitie and bodilye blemiſhes: for Aduouſons, reuerſions, benefices when they ſhalbe next voide, for diſcharge from viſitations, for making Apoſtolicall chéefe Notaries, and Regiſters, for the clauſe non obſtantibus, for diſpenſations with ſecular Clarkes, for repeales, for tollerations of Concubines, and ſix hundred other ſuch choppings and marchandize: it is apparant I ſay, that by theſe trickes the Popes do rake more money yéerly to Rome, then while the Romain Empire ſtood, the Monarcks of the whole worlde did exact of all the coaſtes of the whole earth.

But the Emperour being drenched in ſuperſtition, excuſed himſelfe, that he had doon it for want of ſkill to holde ſtirrops, ſith that was the firſt time that euer he had that office to hold the ſtirrope.

themſelues alſo for the Papall preeminence. Iohn the twentie and fourth when he was Ambaſſadour at Bononia with the armie, threatned the Cardinalles greatlie, Stella Venetus. except they ſhould chuſe ſuch a Pope as might like him. And when as many had beene preſented, and he would allowe none of them, beeing requeſted that hee would vouchſafe to ſignifie whom he would haue, giue me, ſaith he Saint Peters cloake, and I will giue it vnto him that ſhall be Pope: which beeing done, hee putting the cloake about his ſhoulders ſaid, I am pope. Which although it offended the Cardinalles, yet they were forced to agree to it. In like manner Iohn the two and twentith alſo, when Plat. Lintpran dus Maſſaeus. Vſpergenſis. the election was referred to him, made him ſelfe pope.
            Yea moreouer they ſay, that they can make euident proofe that ſometimes there haue beene foure popes togither, Three Popes togither. ſometime thrée, ſometime two. For Victor, Alexander the third, Calixtus the third, and Paſcalis held the popedome altogither in the raigne of Fridericke Barbaroſſa. And Benet the eight, Silueſter the third, and Gregorie the fift, were popes at once, ſo long till at length the Emperour Henrie the third depoſed them all. Likewiſe Gregorie the twelfth, Benet the thirtenth, and Alexander the fift, by their thunderboltes of excommunications challenged to them the papacie, and let flye their thunderclaps of curſings and banninges togither.
            Now how Stephanus the third ſtroue for the triple crowne with Conſtantine, Sergius the third, with Chriſtopher, Vrbanus the fift with Clement the 7.

               Iulius the ſecond is reported to haue committed buggrie with two noble yong men, whom Anne Queene of France had committed to the gouernement and educatiō of Robert the Cardinall of Nauata, & with many others.

Iohn the twentith foure, for buggerie, fornications, and ſuch other his abominable vices, being depoſed from his Popedome at the Counſell of Conſtance, was kept in priſon three yeares at Heydelberge. Clement the eight was accuſed in a Treatiſe vpon the articles of the maiſters of Paris, that he was a Baſtard, a poyſoner, a buggerer, a whoremonger, and a worker of all miſchiefe.

Vrbanus the ſixt ordayning new Cardinals, caſt ſeuen of the olde in pryſon, and putting fiue of them into a ſacke, drowned them in the water. Innocentius the eight, ſent by colluſion and ſecret agréement, the Citizens of Rome that exhorted him to peace, vnto his Nephewe Lewis at the hoſpitall of the holy Ghoſt, who preſently ſlewe two of them and tumbled them out at the windowe, ſaying, that there was no way but this to end ſchiſmes.

            Sixtly, they doe by a fewe examples proue, that ye Popes The Popes, traitors, or betrayers. See in the ſtories how the Emperour was taken, and let goe againe, by the Souldan. Nauclerus. Bernus.
                haue béene traitors: for it would fill vp a whole volume, to repeate all. Friderick the Emperour, at the generall aſſemblie of the States at Norimberge, complained openlie before the Princes of the Empire, of the treacherie of Alexander the thirde, and read his traiterous letter, which he had ſent to the Souldan, the Emperor of the Turkes. Gregorie the ſecond forbade, that the accuſtomed tribute ſhould be paid to the Emperour Leo. Alexander the ſixt did ſende to the Turkes for helpe againſt the Frenchmen. Gregorie the ninth requeſted the Souldane, Emperour of ye Turkes, that he ſhould not ſurrēder the holy land, nay, that he ſhould doe his endeuour to kill the Emperour.

Nay ſurelie, the Goſpellers alledge both ſtraunge monſters, and ſpeciall puniſhments, whereby the Lord declared, that theſe monſtruous abominations of the Popes did gréeuouſlie diſpleaſe him. For as for the firſt, namelie monſters: in the dayes of Benet the third, at Ments, a deuill hidden vnder a prieſtes cappe while hee was ſprincling holie water, accuſed him in the hearing of manie men, that hee the night before had layen with the Deputies daughter. In the dayes of Paule the 1. according to the propheſie of the holie Ghoſt, ſtarres were ſéene to fall frō heauen. While Iohn the twelfth held Petrus Praemonſtrat. ye

Benet the 9. was ſtifled by a deuill, to whō he had giuē himſelfe in his life time, in whoſe Abbas Vſper. dayes there were ſeene great beames burning in the ſkie. Under Paſchalis, both many other ſtraunge things fell out, and alſo bloud dropped out of loaues of bread at Spira. In the tyme of Lucius the third, which allowed ſeruice ſayd by

thoſe that kept whores, there was a mightie earth-quake, which deſtroyed an hūdred famous Cities in Aſia, and fiue and twentie thouſand men in Sicilia.

In the dayes of Vrbane the 1260 fourth, who at the motiō of a certaine woman ordained the feaſt of Corpus Chriſti, there appeared a mightie Comet for thrée monethes ſpace, which the verie ſame night that Vrbane dyed in, vaniſhed away and was ſéene no more. Nicolaus the third, begat of his concubine a child that had 135 Joannes Nouiomagus in illuſt. Batauiae. hayres and nayles like a beare. While Iohn the foure and twentith aſſembling a Councell at Rome, went about to crowne Sigiſmund king of Hungary, Emperour, and after Maſſe of the holie Ghoſt, was ſet in his throne, vpon a ſodeine an ouglie owle, ſettled vpon a beame of the church, ouer againſt him, and ſtaring vpon the pope with his eyes, kept a howling there, vntill the pope breaking vp the Coū
               cell, aroſe, and went his way. And at the next ſitting, when as the Owle flying thither againe and ſchriching, could bée driuen away neither with crying, nor flinging of cudgels, the Councell was fayne to bée diſmiſſed without doing of any thing. On the day that Leo the tenth made thirty Cardinals, 1517 a mightie tempeſt of lightning and thunder aroſe, ſo that a thunder-bolt ſmoate the Chappell where the ceremonies of their ordination had béen ſolemnized, and ſtroke the picture of the babe Chriſt out of our Ladyes lappe, and the keyes out of Peters hands.
            There were many other miracles alſo, if we liſted to rehearſe The miraculous puniſhments, whereby God hath ſhewed his deteſtatiō of the Popes villanies. See for theſe thinges the liues of the Popes in the authours aboue mentioned. thē: but it is better that we alledge ſom of thoſe puniſhmēts that haue light vpōſo deteſtable villanies.

Hadrian the fourth, beeing choakt with a flye that flewe into his mouth, gaue vp the Ghoſt. Iohn the two and twentith beeing cruſhed with the fall of his feaſting chāber, dyed. Iohn the 11. being taken by Guies ſouldiers, was ſtifled with a pillow thruſt into his mouth. Benet the ſixth by one Cynthius a Citizen of Rome was thruſt into Hadrian-Tower, and there ſtrangled, for his notorious miſdemeanours. The carkaſe of Boniface the ſeuenth, who dyed ſodenlie, hauing a rope tyed to his féete, was ſtabbed through with iauelins, dragged a long through the ſtréetes, and buried in the ordinarie and ſimple manner. Lucius the ſecond, while hee went about to enter vpon the Capitole beeing full of Senatours, was ſo pelted with ſtones, that he dyed ſhortlie after thoſe blowes. When Innocentius the fourth had vniuſtlie condemned Robert Biſhop of Lincolne, & the ſaid Rob. had cited him to anſwere before the iudge Chriſt: there was a voyce heard in the Popes Courte, crying, Come thou wretch to Gods Iugdement. Wherefore the next day hee was found dead and blacke in his bedde, as if he had dyed of beating with clubbes. Nicholaus the third, was taken with a palſie, and dyed thereof. Benet the ninth, dyed of poyſon giuen him in a figge by an Abbatiſſe. Paulus the ſecond, hauing beene verie iocond at ſupper, dyed ſtraite of a palſie.

               Theſe therefore are the cauſes wherfore the Goſpellers The definitiue and ſummarie cauſes of reiecting the Popes. Diſtinct 40. Canon. li. Papa.
                refuſe to admit the Popes for Iudges.
            For firſt, they ſay that it is againſt the lawes of God and man, that the Popes ſhould be both parties and Iudges. For euen by the common iudgement of the Canoniſts the Pope is not ſufficient iudge, no although he were guiltie of the crime of hereſie only, but muſt be iudged by others.
            But héereunto, they ſay, they haue ioyned all theſe ſo many horrible and abhominable vices, whereof although they had not as yet béene condemned, but only charged with them, yet they might not only not be Iudges, but alſo not ſo much as accuſe the meaneſt man that is, of any crime, vntill L.

            Finally, ſith it is manifeſt that this is the Law of al nations, that in conſultation of hard matters, ſentence ſhould be giuen according to ye iudgement of the greater parte (eſpecially when the greater parte is eſtéemed and meaſured not only by the number of perſons, but alſo according to the degrée and proportion of the whole ſtate) and the Kingdomes before mencioned, which haue condemned the Popes, doo eaſily make two of the thrée partes of Chriſtendome: they ſay very iuſtly, that they may refuſe the Popes. Wherfore either let them firſt cléere themſelues of thoſe moſt hainous accuſations, or if they cannot ſo doo, let them not thruſt in themſelues, for iudges of the controuerſies of the Churche. For otherwiſe the Goſpellers ſay, that they will make the Popes that anſwere, which long ſince Pope Iohn the 23. receiued from the Grecians, vnto whom when he had written that he alone was the head of the Church and Chriſts Uickar, they replyed thus bréefely.

               be with thee, becauſe God is with vs.
            
            It remaineth that the goſpellers ſhewe why, and how far foorth they acknowledge not the councels for iudges. And they ſay that they do this, moued thereunto with moſt waightie cauſes. For firſt, there haue béene many councels which haue wonderfully erred, not onely in manners, but alſo in poynts of doctrine. And thereof it came, that not afewe times prouinciall councels were amended by generall councels, and contrarie wiſe, Generall councels corrected by national councels. Moreouer, euen the beſt councels The ſecond cauſe. that haue béene, haue not handled all the articles of the faith, but onlye a few controuerſies, which ſpecially were toſſed & beaten in their daies. Beſides this, it is manifeſt The third cauſe. out of ſtories, that euen in thoſe goldē times, ſuch was partlye the pride, partlye the wilyneſſe, partlye the ignorance, and partly the wickednes of ſome Biſhops, that not the ſpirit of God, but the ſpirite of diſcord, may ſéeme to haue béen preſident in their councels.
            Finallye we read that in theſe laſt times ſuch councels The fourth cauſe. haue been held, wherin wicked opinions, and either vnprofitable, or hurtfull ceremonies haue béen brought in, eſtabliſhed not by reaſons, or authoritie of the woord of God, but by force & armes. The which things, leaſt any man might ſay, to be ſpoken ſlaunderouſly and falſely, it may be ſhewed by a breefe bedroule of the councels. For if a man ſhall peruſe the ſtories of olde times, he ſhal finde this to be moſt true, that euen as according to the old tradition of the houſe oſ Elias, the whole time of the viſtble world is deuided by The tradition of the houſe of Elias. two thouſands. (For there ſhall be ſixe thouſand yeeres and then the burning of all thinges, two thouſand voide, two thouſand vnder the Lawe, two thouſand the daies of

Of Chalcedon 455. or portions, within the which alſo almoſt all Kingdomes do féel an alteration. Within theſe thrée circles, the true religion and Catholick Church is found to weare and waxe like to the Moone. For, for the ſpace of fiue hundreth yéeres after Chriſt, although there fell out great contentions about the Sonne of God, and other weightie matters, by Ebion, Cerinthus and others, yet did the trueth preuaile, and for the ſpace of whole fiue hundred yéeres, the Church, flouriſhed and continued, as it were, at the full moone. For within this compaſſe there fel the four firſt Sinodes or aſſemblies of the Apoſtles, and afterwards the foure generall councelles. Wherof the firſt being called togither by Conſtantine the great, condemned Arius. The ſecond helde at Conſtantinople aſſembled by Theodoſius, confuted the Macedonians. The thirde kept at Epheſus, ſummoned by Theodoſius the ſecond, the Sonne of Archadius, condemned Neſtorius. The fourth celebrated at Chalcedon, commaunded by Martianus, condemned Eutiches. The créedes of theſe foure generall councels, as expoſitions of the faith, the reformed Church dooth willingly imbrace. For they are grounded vpon the foundation of the holye The ſecond circle of fiue hundred yeeres. Scriptures themſelues. But in the fiue hundred yéers next following, errour did ſo wraſtle with trueth, that aſſoone as men had once ſtepped ſomewhat aſide from the path of the Scriptures, by and by many buddes of falſe opinions and hurtful ceremonies ſprung vp, and grew more and more.
            For in the firſt general councell held at Conſtantinople, aſſembled by the Emperour Iuſtinian, they were confuted, that ſaid that the body of Chriſt was incorruptible. In the ſixt, which Conſtantine the firſt, ſurnamed Barbatus, called together in the ſame place, the Monothelites were condemned. But the councels that afterwardes followed,

almoſt all of them decréee matters, either childiſh, or elſe flat contrarie to the word of God. For in the ſeuenth general 788 councel, which at the commaundement of the Empreſſe was adiourned from Conſtantinople to Nice, it was decreed, not by the word of God, but by mayne force of an armie leuied out of Thracia, that images ſhould be honoured, and worſhipped. And in they eighth general councel, which when Baſilius was Emperour, was aſſembled at Conſtantinople, 869 when Adrian Biſhoppe of Rome had ſent his deputies or Leuetenants thither, and commaunded that the Church of Rome ſhould be the head of other Churches, and that the common people ſhould be debard from all choiſe of their miniſters: there grew an inward grudge betwéene the Latin and Gréeke Churches for the ſupremacie, which continueth euen vntill this day. But in the other fiue hundred The third circle of fiue hundred yeares, yeares that remayne, there followed ſuch councells, wherein we ſee almoſte no good thing, but all wicked and fonde thinges rather, eſtabliſhed.
            At the councell of Ments (for let me, out of each of theſe 1049 hundreds, picke and cull foorth one ſinod a péece, for the manifeſting of the matter) whereat both the Pope, and the Emperour were preſent, with an hundred and thirtie Biſhops, there was conſultatiō for the forbidding of prieſts marriage.
            In the councel held at Brixia, which was called by the Emperour Henry, Gregorie the ſeuenth for his villanies 1080 before mentioned, was depoſed. In the councell of Papia, 1160 when the Emperour Fridericke would haue refourmed the election of the Popes, there aroſe a ſchiſme of twentie yeares continuance, which laſted till the Pope had troad vpon the Emperours necke at Uenice.
            In the councell of Lions, Innocentius the fourth made 1243 an act againſt the Emperour Henrie the ſecond, and authorized the Cardinals to were red Caps, and ride on horſes. At the counſel of Uienna in France. Clemens the firſt did 1311

            There was a councel aſſembled at Baſil when the ſame 1431 
               Sigiſmund was Emperour, wherein it was decréed, that the Popes ought to be ſubiect to the councels. Which whē it diſliked Eugenius, hee remoued the councell, firſt to Bononia, and then to Ferraria, and from thence to Florence, whereas, although Iohn Palaeologus the Emperour of the Grecians, vpon hope of ſuccour againſt the Turkes, and the Ruſſians alſo, did promiſe obedience to ye Sée of Rome, yet notwithſtanding afterwards when they were returned whome, & the reſt for good cauſes would not agrée to them, there could be no peace concluded with the Pope.
            At length alſo Iulius the ſecond called a councel at Laterane, 1511 and Paule the third at Trent: in the which becauſe they procéeded not according to the rules preſcribed in the 1552 worde of God, therefore the Goſpellers affirme that they are not bound to their decrées. By all which it appeareth what manner of councels haue béene kept in theſe later hundred yeares. For as for the contrarietie of councels. it Many contrarietes of councels is the eaſieſt matter of a thouſand to ſhew it. For the councel of Chalcedon condemned Eutiches, the councel of Epheſus alowed him: the counſel of Nice condemned Arrius, the councel of Sardice, Smirna, and Millan, defended him.

            Beholde the authoritie of Councels, behold their agréement. And theſe are the reaſons why the Goſpellers will not ſimply admitte the Councels for Iudges, in the controuerſies

of Religion; but as ſworne witneſſes, and that too ſo farre foorth onelie, as their depoſitions ſhall agrée with the déede of the will, and the meaning of the will maker, whiche is the Lord God. Wherefore Auguſtine doth verie well aduiſe that in controuerſies of the Churche

For more credite is to bee giuen to a man of the common ſorte, that ſpeaketh the trueth accordyng to the Scriptures, then to a generall Councell, that bringeth a lye againſt the Scriptures.
            
               There remaineth the third kynde of Iudges, namelie, the auncient Fathers. But the Goſpellers ſay, they can not abſolutelie admitte theſe neither, for Iudges. For firſt they ſay that there are verie fewe that are verie auncient, which notwithſtanding haue alſo moſt plainlie declared, that they may erre. And againe they alledge that the 2. age after enſuing, was ſo generally ouertaken, and ſtronglie poſſeſt with a falſe perſuaſion and opinion concerning prayer to the dead, building of Churches, ſuperſtitious celebrating the memoriall of martyrs, allegoricall and miſticall expoſition of the Scriptures, ſingle life, moncherie, and a multitude of ceremonies, that many Biſhops partlie of ignoraunce partlie of couetouſneſſe, partlie of vayne glorie, and finallie partlie of méere wickedneſſe, were ſo farre from ſtopping and repreſſing, that they rather countenaunced and ſupported all theſe errours. This might be proued by many examples, but a fewe will ſerue for the clearing of the matter.
            The godly imbrace Tertulliā
                ſo farre forth, as out of the The errours, and imperfections of the Fathers. Tertullian.
                written word of God he confuted Marcion, and Praxeas,
               
who denied both the Godhead and manhoode of Chriſt. But in that hee maintaineth the errours of the Millenaries, and condemneth ſecond mariages, therein they iudge that he / erreth. Cyprian was of ſound iudgement in the doctrine Cyprian. of the holie Trinitie, of the Baptiſme of infants, and vſe of the Lordes Supper: but he erreth in this, that he decréed, that thoſe which had bene Baptiſed by heretickes, ſhould bee Baptiſéd agayne, and did too ouerlaſhinglie extoll virgiuitie, and ſette-penaunce. Baſill iudged aright Baſille. of the Trinitie, of repentaunce, and iuſtification but herein hee is not without fault, that hee firſt ſet vp ſocieties of Monckes, which are now thought to haue growen too farre out of kinde from their firſt inſtitution.

               Chriſoſtome. handled manie matters excéeding well, but when hee ſtretcheth his eloquencie to extoll vowed Pilgrimages, and prayer for the dead, hee is iudged to erre. Ambroſe writ not a fewe things verie religiouſlie of the Ambroſe. Trinitie, and of the doctrine of iuſtification: but the reformed Church doth reiect thoſe counterfeit and forged bookes, which go abroad vnder his name. Ierome did very good ſeruice Jerome. to the Church, when he diſputeth, that our regenation is not wrought by the ſtrēgth of our frée will: but not withſtāding in the meane while, he erreth moſt groſſely & ſhamefully in this, that he ſo diſprayſeth mariage, that hee calleth her a whore, which marieth the ſecond time. Auguſtine the Auguſtine. moſt ſincere of all the old fathers, deſerueth very wel of the Church, while he confuteth the Arriās, Manicheis, Donatiſts & Pelagiās by the word of God: but whereas he ſtaggereth about Purgatory & vowes, therein he is thought not to haue takē counſell with ye word of God. Gregory iudgeth Gregorie. rightly whē he ſaid, he was Antichriſt, that ſought to be called Vniuerſal Biſhop, but he erreth very fearefully, while he

pulleth aſunder the lawfull mariages of the Miniſters of Gods word, when he ſaith, it is vnlawfull to renounce a ſolitarie life, and while hee is induced by night apparitious and viſions, to allowe of doctrines contrarie to thé word of God.
            And now howe ſhould the Goſpellers abſolutelie The teſtimonies of the fathers make againſt the Papiſtes. Ambroſe lib. 1. de Abraham. cap. 9. admitte the fathers for iudges: when as the playntiefes them ſelues doe not allowe and obſerue all their ſayinges.
            
               Ambroſe ſaith, that when we haue performed the duetie of common ciuilitie towardes the dead, in burying them, we ſhould then let them alone.
            
               Gelaſius ſaith, that the ſubſtaunce of bread and wine in the Sacrament doth ſo remaine and not ceaſſe, as there remaineth Gelaſius in concilio Rom. in Chriſt the Lord, the nature of man ioyned to the diuine nature.

            Theſe and other ſuch bounds of the auncient Fathers, ſith the Sée of Rome her ſelfe hath ouer

               ſtrided: by what right ſhe maye enioyne others to keepe that, which ſhe her ſelfe neglecteth to doo, all men may eaſily iudge.
            Sith therfore, neither the Popes, neither the councels, nor the Fathers can end this diſſention, is there any at laſt I pray you, vnto whoſe iudgement we muſt ſtand. Are they 
               
                  That traditions cannot be Iudges of religion. Euſeb. lib. 3. Hiſt cap. 4. lib. 5. cap. 8 Irenius. Lib 3. ca. 14. lib. 1. cap. 2 3. 12. lib. 3. cap. 4. Tertul. in praeſcrip. Heret. 
               Traditions that muſt ſtrike the ſtroke? Why, by the name of Traditions they muſt either vnderſtand ceremonies, or doctrines: and as for ceremonies, although they be auntient, yet if they be either hurtfull or néedleſſe, and ſuperfluous, or repugnant to the woord of God, or haue been abrogated at a certain time, they are not to be ſuffered. For the Lord giueth expreſſe commaundement that men woorſhip

him not with doctrines deuiſed by mens braines: and as for the traditions that are doctrinall, they muſt either containe in them, the written word of God it ſelfe, Créedes, and expoſitions, 2. Cor. 3 12. 1. Cor. 4. gathered by neceſſary collection out of the foundations of the ſcriptures, againſt Heretickes, or elſe thoſe things which either directly or indirectly, are either put to, or taken from the word of God. If you meane the former, who will not receyue ſuch traditions?
            If the later, who may not without any breach of Godlines, reiect them? And how much Traditions doe auaile to appeaſe and ceaſſe the contentions of the Church, olde Stories doe plainly ſhew.
            For when as in the moſt auncient times, there aroſe a ſturre in the Church concerning the feaſt of Eaſter, with ſo great a doo, that the whole world was ſhaken therewith, Socrat. lib. 5. cap. 22. Auguſt. ad Caſulam. Epiſt. 86. both ſides had recourſe to the traditions of the Apoſtles, which are not expreſſed in any certain Booke. But when each ſide alleadged that they kepte the feaſte of Eaſter on that time which was appointed by tradition of the Apoſtles: the matter grew to this paſſe in the end, that there was a flat fréedome for the Church, in all ſuch manner of Iren. epiſt. ad Victorem Epiſc. Rom. matters, vntill tiranny preuailed.
            Loe what force traditions haue to determine the controuerſies of Religion.
            
               Will miracles then make manifeſt which is the better cauſe, or the Catholick church? Why, the vſe of miracles is now ceaſed. For there is not now any new Eoſpell or Aug. lib. de vera religione. new doctrine broached, but that which Chriſt and the Apoſtles haue already confirmed with miracles and wonders.
            Againe we doe not reade that all thoſe that reſtored, and as it were reformed Religion, were famous for their myracles: In the which number Iohn Baptiſt, Aſaph, Ethan, Iedithun, Heman, Core, and other Prophets, are to be reckonned. Moreouer, except the gift of miracles be lefte to the wiſe diſpoſition of God, they cannot confirme any doctrine.

For it is manifeſt that the miracles of Chriſt which otherwiſe were full of power, did either nothing at all or Deut. 13. 2. Theſ. 2. Aug. quaeſi. 82. li. de orth
                     •
                  fid. cap. 47. Aug. lib. de ciuit. Dai. 22. cap. 8. Chryſoſt. 33. in Matth. very litle, further the obſtinate Iewes to faith, and Godly. neſſe.
            Finally how could miracles be neceſſarie ſignes of true Religion, of themſelues, when as it is manifeſt that Antichriſt and falſe Prophets ſhall excell with many miracles? wherefore thoſe miracle-mongers ought themſelues to be taken for miracles and wounders, who when the date, and vſe of miracles is paſt, doe yet require miracles: although the true doctrine is not euen at this day altogether deſtitude of great miracles.
            
               What then can the perpetuall and continuall ſucceſſion 
               That the ſucceſsion of Popes cannot be iudge of religion. 
               of the Biſhops of Rome ſerue to diſcerne betwéene true, and falſe Religion? Surely no man will deny that there is one ſucceſſion of true doctrine, and another of perſons, wherefore if the ſucceſſion of Perſons be ioyned with the ſucceſſion of the Prophets, and Apoſtles doctrine, it is manifeſt doubleſſe, that the weight thereof is not ſmall.
            For in this ſenſe the Fathers did alleage ſucceſſion againſt In orat. Maxim. Cynicum. the Hereticks. For he that profeſſeth the ſame doctrine (ſaith Nezianzen) is partaker of the ſame chaire alſo: but hee that holdeth a contrarie doctrine, ought not to bee counted a Succeſſour: and truely this later hath the name in déede, but that former hath the trueth of ſucceſſion. Except perhaps a man call it ſucceſſion in that ſence, that we In orat. de Hthanaſ. ſay ſickneſſe ſuccéedeth health: light darkneſſe: a ſtorme fayre weather, madneſſe reaſon: dregges wine: and in a word, Nero Auguſtus: or Cambyſes, Cyrus. Sith therfore the ſucceſſion of the Prophets and Apoſtles doctrine was broken off long agoe in the popiſh Church: ſurely the ordinarie Thus far reach the words of Natianzens.
                continuance of Pope after Pope is of no force to ſhew which is the true religion. But it may be, they will demaund of the Goſpellers, the time and perſon, wherein the ſucceſſion of doctrine was altered.
            
               
Unto this the Goſpellers anſwere, that the Popes of When the ſucceſſion of doctrine was altered in the popiſh Church. The firſt rowe of Popes. Rome are to be diſtinguiſhed into thrée eſpeciall rankes or companies. For they deny not that from Linus to Milchiades, there were one and thirtie true Paſtours of them in number, who laboured in the Lords harueſt euen vnto martirdome, and therefore may well be called Starres in the right hand of Chriſt. But from Slueſter the firſt, vnto Sabinianus 
               
                  Apoc. 1. The ſecond order of popes 
               Thuſcus, there were thrée and thirtie mytired Biſhops, who although they were not the woorſt, yet by traditions and conſtitutions, they prepared a ſeate for the great Antichriſt. All the reſt, euen vnto this preſent Pope, The third rank of Popes. The fourth company. Apoc. 13. The fifth company. Apoc. 27. The ſixt company. Apoc. 20. they call Antichriſts: yet ſo, that nine and thirtie of them, from Boniface the third and fourth, vnto Leo the fourth, are reckoned to be in the Kingdome of the great beaſt: one and thirtie of them, from Iohn the eight to Iohn the eightéenth, are numbred in the Kingdome of the great whore: nine and thirtie of them, vntill the time of Celeſtine the fourth, belong to the Kingdome of the Dragon: And from Innocentius the fourth, vntill the preſent Pope that now is, about threeſcore and foure of them, are counted in the Kingdome of Locuſts, according to the order of the Prophecie which God would haue to be expreſſely ſet downe, concerning the Apoc. 9. Kingdome of Antichriſt. Loe what force and authoritie ſucceſſion hath.
            
               Will agreement then in publick doctrine and outward 
               That bare vnitie is not a marke of the true church. 
               woorſhip, ſhew which is indéed the catholicke Church? why if méer agréement did proue the true Church: doubtles neyther the Iewes, nor the Turkes, nor Hereticks, or Heathen of any other ſuch litter, would be kept out from the title of the true Church, ſith we ſée that euen they alſo doo maruelouſtie agrée amongſt themſelues.
            And we ſée that oftentimes great men in the church haue The falling out of great men in the Church. fallen into hoat contentions amongſt themſelues. Between Barnabas and Paule there aroſe ſuch ſtrife, that they

brake of companye one from another. So Peter of Alexandria, 
               Zozom. lib. 1. cap. 16. Socrat lib. a Origen. Contra Ceiſum. and Meletius: ſo Epiphanius and Chriſoſtome: ſo Ierome, Auguſtine and Ruffinus: So finally, Cyrill, Iohn of Antioch, and Theodoret, were at open variance and iarres one with another. And in déed, Clemens Alexandrinus writeth, that the Iewes did vpbraid the Chriſtians with Lib. 17. Stromatum. their diſſentions amongſt themſelues.
            By all which it is moore cleare than the noone dayes, that as a bare agréement and vnitie cannot prooue the truth of Religion, ſo neither doe all diſſentions proue a Religion to be falſe, ſo that the foundation be not broken by the diſcorde. That olde cuſtome is no ſure marke of the true Church. Eſa. 8. 12. Gen. 7. Heb. 11.
            
            
               Can the common Cuſtome then of many ages, direct vs where to ſéeke the true church? Nay, but God hath forbidden the faithful to ſuffer his euerlaſting truth, to be ouer ruled by any compaſſe of yeares, any cuſtome, or at a word by any conſpiracie of the whole world. So Noye with his ſmall family, when he ſawe that the whole world had conſpired and agréed to the ſame wickednes, confirmed by the cuſtome of many ages before paſt, yet choſe rather to ioyne with a fewe in the true doctrine of God, than to take parte with the whole world in wickednes. How the Church may be iudge. That the word of God onely ought to be iudge of Religion. ang. Tract. cap. 11. in 10. ad. Hierom. Luk. 16. Joh. 4. Joh. 6. Ioh. 15. Act. 20. Pro. 30. 2. Tim. 3. Eſa. 8.

               Shall the Church then decide theſe controuerſies of the Church? yea, but wee muſt firſt ſeuere the true Church from the Synagogue of the Malignant, which can be done by no other meanes, but by the word of God.
            
               Shall then the holie ſcriptures be Iudge in this controuerſie of heires at variance? So in déede the Goſpellers would haue it.
            For they affirme with Auſtine, Chriſoſtome, and other of the Fathers, that all things are contained in the written word of God, that might ſuffice for the ſaluation of them that beléeue.
            For, as Auguſtine ſaith in another place: To the bookes

of the holy Scriptures onlye, which are now called canonicall, Lib. de-natura & grat. cap. 61. Contra Fau. li. 11. cap 5. Ad Oroſ. cap 11. Ad paulin. Ad Fortunat. lib. 2. coat. Crcſc. Gram. cap. 32. Ad Vinc. Dou. 48. doo we owe this reuerence and honour, that we aſſuredly beléeue that none of the writers therof could erre at all in writing them: but as for others, we ſo reade them, that how excellent ſoeuer they be, either for holines or learning, we doo not therfore think it true, becauſe they thought ſo, but becauſe they haue béen able to aſſure vs therof, either by the ſaid Canonicall Scriptures, or by probable reaſon, notdiſagréeing from the trueth.
            Therfore (ſaith he in an other place) to the holy Scriptures alone doo we conſent without gainſaying: from other writings we may diſſent, but to the canonicall Scriptures euery man muſt yéeld, euery man muſt ſubſcribe, whether Hitherto reach the woords of Auſtin. he be Layman, or teacher, or King, or Emperour, let him giue place to the holy Scriptures, then the which there is nothing in this world ſet foorth more deuine, and more neceſſary.
            What can be more religious? what more cléer then theſe teſtimonies of Auguſtine? And if the Goſpellers can obtain In what ſort the Fathers, councels and ſuch like are receiued. thus much once, that God may be iudge of the controuerſies of religion by his woord, comprehended in the writings of the Prophets and Apoſtles: why then they doo not ſtick to admit either councels, or Fathers, or miracles, or other ſuch like, for ſworne witneſſes: ſo that firſt the true Church be diſtinguiſhed from the Sinagogue of Sathan: Fathers of ſound credit, from fond fellowes and heretickes: lawfull councels, from tirannicall couenticles: right Bookes, from counterfeits: true miracles from coyned and forged ones: the ſucceſſion of Doctrine, from the diſguiſed ſucceſſion of perſons: true agréement, from obſtinate conſpiracie: and finally, the traditions of the Apoſtles, from the inuentions of men.
            Yea, but ſaith the See of Rome, how can this be doone by How may the Scriptures be Iudges, ſith hereticks doo wreſt them? the written woord of God, ſith there is no heretick that doth not alleadge the Scriptures for himſelfe?
            
               
The Goſpellers aunſwere, that heretickes wreſting the the Scriptures, cannot be better confuted then by the written word of God, which onelie is able to decyde all controuerſies. For Auguſtine ſayd verie well, that we in Ad creſcon. lib. 2 cap. 31. The wordes of Auguſtine. Matt. 4. & 21. no caſe preſume to iudge the bookes of the Prophetes and Apoſtles, but y• by them we iudge all other writtings both of Chriſtians and Paganes. So Chriſt by the Scriptures confuted the Phariſeis, Sadduces, yea and the deuill him ſelfe

            Wherfore (as Auguſtine ſaith) let no man in controuerſies The verie wordes of Auguſtine Lib. 2. cap. 32. cont. creſcon.
                too proudly obiect the writinges, either of Fathers or of Councels, bycauſe we take them not as Canonicall, but rather examine them by the Canonicall writinges, and that which in thē agréeth with the authoritie of the holy Scriptures, we receiue with their commendation: that which agréeth not, we reiect with their leaue.
            But (ſay they) the Scripture is heard, darke & doubtfull. That the holie Scripture is neither hard nor doubtfull. 
               Auguſtine aunſwereth, that mē walke farre more ſafely by the Scriptures, then by traditions, which being ouerſhadowed & darkned with figuratiue ſpéechs, whē we go about to ſearch out, either let that be collected thence which is out of queſtion, or if it be in queſtiō, let it be defined by teſtimonies gottē and gathered from all places that may be, out of the ſame Scriptures. For ſo (ſaith he further) hath the holy

Ghoſt tempered the Scriptures, that that which is ſpoken in one place ſomewhat darkelie, is in another place more cleerelie ſet down: which things ſith they thus ſtand, it followeth, that this is the only meanes that is left to conclude a peace, if the matter be determined by the pure woorde of God alone, and that religion only be iudged true, and that church Catholick, & of the right beleefe, which in all points agréeeth tothe woord of God rightly vnderſtoode.
            The See of Rome leauing all theſe reaſons of the reformed Church, proteſteth that although ſhe ſée that the Goſpellers religion dooth not much differ from the written The exception of the Church of Rome. woord of God, nay, that it agréeeth ther vnto in all thinges, yet ſhe cannot allow it, ſith it ſprung from heretickes, from ſuch as were not ſent of God, and laſt of all from innouatours,

            The Goſpellers on the other ſide intreat the Church of Rome, that ſhe would not accuſe thē of ſo gréeuous crimes, namely, of heroſie, vnlawfull calling and innouation, but that rather if ſhe ſée that their religion dooth agrée with the trueth of God, contained in the writinges of the Prophets and Apoſtles, ſhe would not be vnwilling to receiue and imbrace it her ſelfe alſo.
            For wheras firſt of all their doctrine is charged with hereſte, therein they complaine that they haue great wrong doon them.
            For they ſay that thoſe are not hereticks, which haue béen Lib. Confon. fol. 274. col. 4. either conuinced vpon ſmall ground to ſwarue from the iudgement of the Church of Rome, or they which ſay that three are Antipodes, or men dwelling vnder ye ground, as Pope Zacharie would haue it, or they which will not obey all the conſtitutions of the Pope, as the Canoniſts haue decreede, or thoſe which doo not agrée for the kéeping of Eaſter, as Pope Victor would haue at: or finally thoſe which doo not giue credit to all thoſe thinges which are deliuered for trueth in the Church of Rome (for otherwiſe all thoſe

            But the Goſpellers ſay that they are the right Hereticks, firſt, that bring into the Church a doctrine contrar y to the rule of faith, or beléefe of the Chriſtians: ſecondlye, that make a departure from the Catholick church, that holdeth the pure doctrine of God: laſt of all, thoſe who being ſolemnelye admoniſhed, doo obſtinatelye continue in their errours, that haue béene made manifeſt vnto them.
            But as for them, they proteſt that they haue ſwarued neither from the rule of faith, and ordinarye creede of the Chriſtians, nor from thoſe foure moſt auntient councels, I meane the Councell of Nice, Conſtantinople, Epheſus, and Chalcedon, nor from the Créede of Athanaſius, nor finallye from any parte of the woord of God, nor haue béene cited by due courſe of Lawe, or excommunicated by competent or méet Iudges, or proued to be out of the way, but that they haue alwaies either lawfully giuen an account of their doctrine, or conueniently referred themſelues, and ſolemnelye appealed to a generall and frée councell of all Chriſtendom. That the councel of Trent was not a fre and lawfull councell. For that the councell of Trent was not a frée councell, they proue by ſtories, by which it is manifeſt how that Ceruinus, Polus, and other Cardinals expelled thence, Iacobus Nachiantes Biſhop of Clodia Foſſa, Dominicus Wilhelmus of Uenice, Paulus Vergerius Biſhop of Iuſtinople, and many other, vpon méere ſuſpition that they fauoured the Goſpell, and for certaine ſpéeches repugnant to their popiſh errours.
            
               
And as for the calling of their Miniſters, which firſt That the Miniſters of the reformed church were both extraordinarilie, and ordinarilie called. began to aſſault the papacie: they anſwere, that they were called, partly extraordinarilie, (the Lord ſtirring vp their harts, and inflaming them more and more with the zeale of the glorie of his ſonne) and partly ordinarilie, by Magiſtrates and Princes, many people of ſundrie Nations yéelding their conſent thereunto, and rendering God thanks for ſo great a bleſſing. Which not onely that Princes may doe, but alſo that they are bound to doe, whenſoeuer Churches are anewe, in regarde of their outwarde and viſible forme, either to be eſtabliſhed, or to be reformed and cleanſed from thoſe errors, which through the fault of them that ſhould maintaine and preſerue Religion, were crept in: they proue by the flatte commandement of God, and by the examples of Eezechias, Ioſaphat, Ioſias, and other religious That the Proteſtants doctrine is not new. Princes. For whereas laſt of all they accuſe the Religion of the Goſpellers, of noueltie, therein they complaine, that Gods trueth is greatly iniuried. For the Goſpellers proteſt, that they holde no other doctrine, then that whereby Adam, Seth, Noe, Abraham, and the reſt of the Patriarks, were ſaued, and which, Chriſt, the Apoſtles, the ſixe firſte Councels, and the more auncient and ſounder ſort of the fathers, did preach: vntill at length, the deuill (while the huſbandmen ſlept) had peſtered the Lords field with ſuch ſtore The Church like the moon. of tares, that the pure wheate could not at all be ſéene, for cockle and daruell. For although God wil haue his church preſerued, yet he hath not appointed that it ſhould alwaies ſtande in her full ſtrength and flouriſhing eſtate, but ſuffereth Gen. 17. 1. Kings 7. it, like the Moone, ſometime to weare, and ſometime to waxe: So in the daies of Noe, onelie eight were preſerued in the Arcke againſt the floud. So in the time of Eliah, 
               
                  Mat. 2. How true doctrine was corrupted. there are ſaid to haue béene fiue thouſand, that imbraced the true doctrine. So finallie, in the time of Chriſtes appearing, the Church was ſo darckned, that there was thought ſcarce one or two to be left. And after the gracious birth of

our Sauiour Chriſt, as it were within thrée circles of a thouſand and fiue hundred yeares: the Church in like manner, ſéemeth to haue by little and little, decayed.
            For in the firſt fiue hundred yeares, true religion began to wreſtle with errour: and in the next fiue hundred, to yeeld to it, vntill at length in the other fiue hundred yeres it was ſo ouerwhelmed, that it gaue no light on any ſide.
            Neither for all that doeth it followe hereupon, that either the Church was at any time cleane extinguiſhed, or That the church was neuer quite deſtroyed. that we now are at variance with the church: for ye church of Chriſt hath alwaies béene, and ſhalbe alwaies, as long as the Lord Chriſt ſhall raigne, with whoſe helpe it is ſo ſupported, that yet notwithſtanding, the forme therof is not alwaies viſible.
            Againſt this church, the Proteſtants ſay, that they haue now no quarrell, becauſe together with her, they doe with one conſent, worſhippe one God, and the Lorde Chriſt, according as he hath alwaies béene worſhipped of all the godlie. But they ſay, that they haue departed from that Sinagogue, which hath not kept the true faith, in preferring Reaſons why the proteſtants haue departed from the church of Rome. mens inuentions before the word of God, which would lay intollerable burthens vpon them, which would beare rule ouer their brethren, which would forbidde the ſincere preaching of the word, and right adminiſtration of the Sacraments, which vſeth euery yeare to curſe and banne her, together with the churches of Africa, Egypt, Syria, the Eaſt churches, the churches of Aſia, and Gréece, which perſecuteth the godlie, and will admitte no reformation, which hath corrupted thoſe things which were neceſſarie in the church, enioyned thoſe thinges to be kept of neceſſitie, which were frée, and retained thoſe thinges which were naught and hurtfull, which hath tied the Catholicke church to Rome, which hath wilfullie polluted her ſelfe with all kinde of abhominations.
            
               
And therefore they proteſt that they haue done this of neceſſitie, namely, that they might obey the commaundement of the Lorde, and that their conſciences might not be defiled with their Aduerſaries corrupt doctrine: and that they might not become ſubiect to thoſe puniſhments which hang ouer them.

            The Goſpellers anſwere, firſt that their were alwaies ſome, both in the Eaſt Churches, and alſo in Poperie it ſelfe, which miſliked theſe corruptions of the Romiſh Synagogue, and both by liuely voyce, and alſo by writings inueighed againſt them.
            For that they may ſay nothing of the Auncient fathers, and the whole Primitiue Church, which the Goſpellers affirme to agrée with them in all poyntes in the Articles of faith: they proue that euen in theſe later ages ther

But when they perceiued that they nothing preuailed by baniſhment, impriſonment,

burning, and all kinde of torments, at length they were forced to hearken to the aduice of Gamaliel, who The counſell of Gamaliel, and of the prieſts. counſelled the Iewes to let the Apoſtles alone. For i

            The Concluſion.
            THeſe were the things (good Readers, that loue your ſaluation,) which I thought good to write at this preſent, concerning the appointing of a Iudge for the controuerſies of religion, and the finding out of the trueth of the right religion, and Catholicke Church. Wherin, becauſe I take it, that I haue ſaid nothing which I cannot make good by manifeſt proofes, either of the holy Scriptures, or Catholick Fathers, or els euen of thoſe authours themſelues, whoſe teſtimonies I haue truely alleadged: Surely it is méete and right, that all thoſe that loue the trueth, ſhoulde be ſtirred vp to ſéeke out the way of eternall life: and without partiall iudgement, to know the trueth of religion, and of the church: without the which, ſaluation is not to be had. And now, that which remaineth, let vs with all our hearts beſéech our onely maſter, the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, that wee may be taught many things more which wee knowe not, by him, from whom we haue receiued theſe things which we doe know: let vs pray him, that of his mercie preuenting vs, and furthering vs, he would teach vs thoſe thinges which being to be knowen for our comfort, wee are not ignorant of, kéepe vs in thoſe things which we knowe to be true, ſtrengthen vs in thoſe things wherein we ſtagger, being true, and deliuer vs from thoſe things which are falſe: that ſo in our thoughts and words he may finde that, which he doeth profitably geue vs: and may cauſe thoſe things to procéed from vs, which may be acceptable to God, and profitable to men.
            Amen.
