               AS you are the height of our hopes and bleſſedneſſe, next after your royall Father our Lord and Soueraigne: So, next vnto his Maieſty, are wee bound to dedicate our beſt endeuours

to your Princely ſeruice. And for the Subiect of this relation, as your Highneſſe hath beene pleaſed to doe it the honour, by giuing it the Name of New-England; and by your Highneſſe moſt fauourable encouragement, to continue the ſame in life and being: So ought we to render an accompt of our proceedings, from the root thereof vnto the preſent growth it hath: which ſummarily is here done. If it ſhall appeare naked (as in truth it is) wee beſeech your Highneſſe to receiue it ſo much the rather for the truths ſake, and with your bounty and grace to ſhelter it from the ſtorms & tempeſts of malice and enuy, by which it hath been heretofore diſpoyled of that goodly Ornament it might haue had by this time.
            
               
It is now almoſt able to comfort it ſelfe, and there is no queſtion but by the light of your countenance, it will ſpeedily grew, both to ſerue his Maieſty with honour and profit, and multiply the ſame ſeruice to your Highneſſe in time to come, as a tribute due for the grace it receiues, by the bleſſings of a long peace and proſperity that our Nation enioyes vnder the Raigne of his ſacred Maieſtie, through which we haue the eaſier paſſage to aduance the Croſſe of Chriſt in Heathen parts, and to diſplay his banner in the head of his Armie againſt infernall ſpirits, which haue ſo long kept thoſe poore diſtreſſed creatures (the inhabitants of thoſe parts) in bondage, whoſe poſteritie will for euer bleſſe the time, that the iſſue of

your royall Anceſtors, ſprung from ſo Emperiall branches, ſhould be the meanes to vnite the diuided Crownes in one, whereby the generous Spirits of both Nations, may haue the fairer opportunity to procure their liberties. If your Highneſſe accept of what is paſt, we will hope of happineſſe to enſue; and howſoeuer, pray that all encreaſe of honour in this world, and all heauenly bleſsings in the world to come, may light vpon your Highneſſ as beſt be

            A briefe RELATION OF THE DISCOVERY AND PLANTATION of New England.
            
               ALthough it bee a courſe, farre from the minde of vs, that are vndertakers for the aduancement of the Plantation of New-England, to ſeeke by any vaine oſtentation to extoll our owne endeuours: yet we cannot but ſtriue to vindicate our reputation from the iniurious aſperſions that haue beene laid vpon it, by the malicious practiſes of ſome that would aduenture nothing in the beginning, but would now reape the benefit of our paines and charges, and yet not ſeeme beholding to vs; and to that end they diſualew what is paſt, and by ſiniſter informations derogate what they can from the preſent courie intended: the rather becauſe the good Orders appointed to bee put in execution there, are likely to reſtraine the licentious irregularitie of other places. And this hath induced vs to publiſh our proceedings, whereunto it hath pleaſed God to giue a bleſſing: as to any of indifferent

iudgement may appeare by that which followeth.
            VVHen this deſigne was firſt attempted, ſome of the preſent company were therein chiefly intereſſed; who being carefull to haue the ſame accompliſhed, did ſend to the diſcouery of thoſe Northerne parts a braue Gentleman, Captaine Henry Challons, with two of the Natiues of that Territory, the one called Maneday, the other Aſſecomet. But his miſfortunes did expoſe him to the power of certaine Strangers, enemies to his proceedings, ſo that by them, his company were ſeized, the ſhips and goods confiſcated, and that Voyage wholly ouerthrowne.
            This loſſe, & vnfortunate beginning, did much abate the riſing courage of the firſt Aduenturers; but immediately vpon his departure, it pleaſed the noble Lord chiefe Iuſtice, Sir Iohn Popham knight, to ſend out another ſhip, wherein Captain Thomas Haman went Commander, & Marti ne Prinne of Briſtow Maſter, with all neceſſarie ſupplies, for the ſeconding of Captaine Challons and his people; who arriuing at the place appointed, and not finding that Captaine there, after they had made ſome diſcouery, and found the Coaſts, Hauens, and Harbors anſwerable to our deſires, they returned. Vpon whoſe relation the Lord Chiefe Iuſtice, and wee all waxed ſo confide nt of the buſineſſe, that the yeere following euerie man of any worth, formerly intereſſed in it, was willing to ioyne in the charge for the ſending ouer a competent number of people to lay the ground of a hopefull plantation.
            Here upon Captaine Popham, Captaine Rawley Gilbert, and others were ſent away with two Ships, and an hundred Landmen, Ordnance, and other prouiſions neceſſarie for their ſuſtentation and defence; vntill other

ſupply might bee ſent. In the meane while, before they could returne, it pleaſed God to take from vs this worthy member, the Lord Chiefe Iuſtice, whoſe ſudden death did ſo aſtoniſh the hearts of the moſt part of the Aduenturers, as ſome grew cold, and ſome did wholly abandon the buſineſſe. Yet Sir Francis Popham his ſonne, certaine of his priuate friends, and other of vs, omitted not the next yeare (holding on our firſt reſolution) to ioyne in ſending forth a new ſupply, which was accordingly performed.
            But the Ships arriuing there, did not only bring vncomfortable newes of the death of the Lord Chiefe Iuſtice, together with the death of Sir Iohn Gilbert, the elder brother vnto Captaine Rawley Gilbert, who at that time was Preſident of that Councell: But found that the old Captaine Popham was alſo dead; who was the onely man (indeed) that died there that Winter, wherein they indured the greater extremities; for that, in the depth thereof, their lodgings and ſtores were burnt, and they thereby wondrouſly diſtreſſed.
            This calamitie and euill newes, together with the reſolution that Captaine Gilbert was forced to take for his owne returne, (in that hee was to ſuceed his brother, in the inheritance of his lands in England) made the whole company to reſolue vpon nothing but their returne with the Ships; and for that preſent to leaue the Countrey againe, hauing in the time of their abode there (notwithſtanding the coldneſſe of the ſeaſon, and the ſmall helpe they had) built a prettie Barke of their owne, which ſerued them to good purpoſe, as eaſing them in their returning.
            The arriuall of theſe people heere in England, was a wonderfull diſcouragement to all the firſt vndertakers, in ſo much as there was no more ſpeech of ſetling

any other plantation in thoſe parts for a long time after: only Sir Francis Popham hauing the Ships and prouiſion, which remained of the company, and ſupplying what was neceſſary for his purpoſe, ſent diuers times to the coaſts for trade and fiſhing; of whoſe loſſe or gaines himſelfe is beſt able to giue account.
            Our people abandoning the plantation in this ſort as you haue heard; the Frenchmen immediately tooke the opportunitie to ſettle themſelues within our limits; which being heard of by thoſe of Virginia, that diſcreetly tooke to their conſideration the inconueniences that might ariſe, by ſuffering them to harbour there, they diſpatched Sir Samuel Argall, with commiſſion to diſplace them, which hee performed with much diſcretion, iudgement, valour, and dexteritie. For hauing ſeized their Forts, which they had built at Mount Manſell, Saint Croix, and Port Reall, he carryed away their Ordnance, hee alſo ſurpriſed their Ship, Cattle, and other prouiſions, which hee tranſported to the Collonie in Virginia, to their great benefit. And hereby he hath made a way for the preſent hopefull plantation to bee made in Noua-Scotia, which we heare his Maieſtie hath lately granted to Sir William Alexander Knight, one of his Maieſties moſt honourable Councell of the Kingdome of Scotland, to bee held of the ſaid Crowne, and that not without ſome of our priuities, as by approbation vnder writing may and doth appeare. Whereby it is manifeſt that wee are ſo farre from making a Monopoly of all thoſe lands belonging to that coaſt (as hath beene ſcandalouſly by ſome obiected) That we wiſh that many would vndertake the like.
            
            In this Interim there were of vs who apprehenedd better hopes of good that might enſue by this attempt, being thereunto perſwaded, both by the relations of our

people that had indured the many difficulties whereunto ſuch actions are ſubiected chiefly in the Winter ſeaſon; and likewiſe by the informations giuen them by certaine of the Natiues, that had beene kept a long time in their hands; wherefore we reſolued once more to trie the veritie thereof, and to ſee if poſſibly we might finde ſomething that might induce a freſh reſolution to proſecute a worke ſo pious and ſo honourable. And thereupon they diſpatched Captaine Hobſon, of the Ile of Wight, together with Captaine Herley, Maſter Iohn Matthew, Maſter Sturton, with two Saluages, the one called Epenow, the other Manawet, with commiſſion and directions fit for them to obſerue and follow, the better to bring to paſſe what was expected. But as in all humane affaires, there is nothing more certaine, then the vncertaintie thereof; ſo fell it out in this; for a little before ſuch time as they arriued vpon the coaſt with the foreſaid Sauages, who were Naturalls of thoſe parts, it happened there had beene one Hunt (a worthleſſe fellow of our Nation (ſet out by certaine Merchants for loue of gaine; who (not content with the commoditie he had by the fiſh, and peaceable trade he found among the Sauages) after hee Irad made his diſpatch, and was ready to ſet ſayle, (more ſauagelike then they) ſeized vpon the poore innocent creatures, that in confidence of his honeſtie had put themſelues into his hands. And ſtowing them vnder hatches, to the number of twenty foure, carried them into the Straights, where hee ſought to ſell them for flaues, and ſold as many as he could get money for. But when it was vnderſtood from whence they were brought, the Friers of thoſe parts tooke the reſt from them, and kept them to be inſtructed in the Chriſtian Faith, and ſo diſappointed this vnworthy fellow of the hopes of gaine he conceiued to make by this new & diuelliſh proiect.
            
               
This being knowne by our two Saluages, formerly ſpoken of, they preſently contracted ſuch an hatred againſt our whole Nation, as they immediatly ſtudied how to be reuenged; and contriued with their friends the beſt meanes to bring it to paſſe; but Manawet dying in a ſhort time after the Ships arriuall there, and the other obſeruing the good order, and ſtrong guard our people kept, ſtudied only how to free himſelfe out of our hands, and thereupon laid the plot very orderly, and indeed effected his purpoſe, although with ſo great hazard to himſelfe and friends, that laboured his reſcue, that Captaine Hobſon and his whole company imagined he had beene ſlaine. And though in the recouery of his body they wounded the Maſter of our Ship, and diuers other of our company, yet was not their deſigne without the ſlaughter of ſome of their people, and the hurts of other, compaſſed, as appeared afterward.
            Hereupon Captaine Hobſon and his companie, conceiuing the end of their attempt to bee fruſtrate, reſolued without more adoe to returne, and ſo thoſe hopes, that charge and voyage was loſt alſo, for they brought home nothing but the newes of their euill ſucceſſe, of the vnfortunate cauſe thereof, and of a warre now new begunne betweene the inhabitants of thoſe parts, and vs. A miſerable comfort for ſo weake meanes as were now left, to purſue the concluſion of ſo tedious an enterpriſe.
            While this was a working, wee found the meanes to ſend out Captainer Iohn Smith from Plymouth, in a ſhip, together with Maſter Darmer and diuers others with him, to lay the foundation of a new Plantation, and to try the fiſhing of that Coaſt, and to ſeeke to ſettle a trade with the Natiues: But ſuch was his miſfortune, as being ſcarce free of our owne Coaſt, he had his maſts

ſhaken ouer boord by ſtormes and tempaſts, his ſhip wonderfully diſtreſſed, and in that extremity forced to come backe againe; ſo as the ſeaſon of the yeere being almoſt ſpent, we were of neceſſitie enforced to furniſh him with another ſhip, and taking out the prouiſion of the firſt, diſpatched him away againe, who comming to the height of the Weſterne Iſlands, was chaſed by a French Pirate, and by him made priſoner, although his ſhip in the night eſcaped away, and returned home with the loſſe of much of her prouiſion, and the ouerthrow of that voyage, to the ruine of that poore Gentleman Captaine Smith, who was detained priſoner by them, and forced to ſuffer many extremities, before hee got free of his troubles.
            Notwithſtanding theſe diſaſters, it pleaſed God ſo to worke for our incouragement againe, as hee ſent into our hands Taſquantum, one of thoſe Saluages that formerly had beene betrayed by this vnworthy Hunt before named, by whoſe meanes there was hope conceiued to worke a peace betweene vs, and his friends, they being the principall inhabitants of that coaſt, where the fire was kindled. But this Saluage Taſquantum, being at that time in the New-found land with Captain Maſon Gouernour there for the vndertakers of that Plantation: Maſter Darmer (who was there alſo, and ſometimes before imployed as we haue ſaid by vs, together with Captaine Iohn Smith) found the meanes to giue vs intelligence of him, and his opinion of the good vſe that might be made of his imployment, with the readineſſe of Captaine Maſon, to further any of our attempts that way, either with boats or other prouiſion neceſſary, and reſoluing himſelfe to goe from thence, aduiſed vs to ſend ſome to meet with him, at our vſuall place of fiſhing, to aid him in his indeuour, that they ioyning together, might be able to doe what

he hoped would be verie acceptable vnto all well wiſhers of that buſineſſe.
            Vpon this newes, we diſpatched the next ſeaſon Captaine Rocraft, with a Company for that purpoſe, in hope to haue met with Captaine Darmer; but the care and diſcretion of Captaine Maſon was ſuch, finding Captaine Darmers reſolution to goe beyond his meanes, that hee perſwaded him firſt to goe for England, that prouiding himſelfe there, as was requiſite, he might proceed in time expedient, which counſell he obſerued (as fit it was) although our expectation of his ioyning with Captaine Rocraft was thereby diſappointed. Yet ſo it happened, that Captaine Rocraft at his arriuall in thoſe parts, met with a French Barke that lay in a Creeke a fiſhing, and trading, which he ſeized on, and ſent home the Maſter and Company in the ſame Ship which he went out in.
            With this Barke and his owne Company, hee meant to keepe the Coaſt that Winter quarter, being very well fitted both with ſalt, and other neceſſaries for his turne: but as this was an Act of extremity (the poore man being of our owne Religion) ſo ſucceeded it accordingly. For in a ſhort time after, certaine of this Captaines company, conſpired together to cut his throat, and to make themſelues maſters of the whole ſpoile, and ſo to ſeeke a new fortune where they could beſt make it. This conſpiracie being diſcouered to the Captaine, hee let it goe on, till the time that it ſhould haue beene put in execution, when hee caught them in there owne traine, and ſo apprehended them in the very inſtant that they were purpoſed to beginne their maſſacre.
            But after he had preuented the miſchiefe, and ſeized vpon the malefactors, hee tooke to his conſideration what was beſt to be done with them. And beeing loth

by himſelfe to diſpatch them as they deſerued, he reſolued to put them a ſhore, thinking by their hazard that it was poſſible they might diſcouer ſomething, that might aduance the publike; and ſo giuing them ſome Armes for their defenſe, and ſome victuall for their ſuſtentation, vntill they knew better how to prouide for themſelues, he left them at a place called Sawaguatock, where they remained not long, but got from thence to Menehighon, an Iſland lying ſome three leagues in the Sea, and fifteene leagues from that place, where they remained all that Winter, with bad lodging, and worſe fare, yet came all ſafe home ſaue one ſickly man, which dyed there, the reſt returned with the Ship wee ſent for Rocrafts ſupply and prouiſion, to make a fiſhing voyage.
            After theſe fellowes were landed, the Captaine finding himſelfe but weakely man'd, and his Ship to draw too much water to coaſt thoſe places, that by his inſtructions he was aſſigned to diſcouer, hee reſolued to goe for Virginia where he had liued a long time before, and had (as hee conceiued) many friends, that would helpe him with ſome things that he had occaſion to vſe. Arriuing there, he was not deceiued of his expectation; for Sir Samuel Argall being their Gouernour, and one that reſpected him much for his owne ſake, was the readier to helpe him, in regard of the good hee 
                  ••
               
               shed to the buſineſſe wherein he was imployed.
            But all this could not preuaile, for after that Sir Samuell Argall came from thence (his departure being more ſuddaine then was expected) it fell out that the new Gouernour entred the Harbour: and finding Rocraft ready to bee gone, ſent to him to command him to come aboord to ſpeake with him, which he readily obeyed, aſſoone as he could fit his boat and men for that purpoſe. And ſo leauing his Barke with her

great Anker a head, and taking with him the halfe of his company, hee was forced to ſtay aboard the new Gouernours Ship that night. In the meane while a ſtorme ariſing, our Barke wanting hands to doe their labour, droue a ſhoare, and there ſunke. But yet the Gouernour and Captaine ſo laboured the next day, when they knew thereof, as that they freed her againe, but that occaſion forced our Captaine to ſtay ſo long in the Countrey to fit himſelfe anew, as in the interim a quarrell fell out betweene him and another of that place; ſo as Rocraft was ſlaine, and the Barque ſunke the ſecond time, and finally diſabled from yeelding vs any benefit to this preſent.
            But we not knowing this diſaſter, and Captaine Darmer arriuing with his Saluage out of Now-found-land, diſpatched him away the next ſeaſon, in a ſhippe we ſent againe for the fiſhing buſineſſe, and aſſigned him a company to ioyne with Rocraft and his people.
            Captaine Darmer arriuing there, and not finding Rocraft, was a little perplexed, and in doubt what to doe: yet hearing by thoſe Mutiners which he found there, that he was gone for 
                  Ʋirginia; he was hopefull of his returne; and liued in that expectation, till ſuch time as he heard (by a ſhip that came from thence to fiſh for the Collony) the confuſion of his fortune, and the end of his miſery in this world. Then he determined to take the Pinnace that the yeare before was aſſigned to Rocraft for him to make the trade with, and with her to proceed on his deſigne, and ſo embarked himſelfe, and his prouiſion and company in her. And leauing the fiſher-men to their labour, he coaſted the ſhore from thence, ſearching euery Harbor, and compaſſing euery Cape-land, till he arriued in 
                  Ʋirginia; where he was in hope to meet with ſome of the prouiſion, or company of Rocraft, to helpe to ſupply him of what

he wanted; as alſo to lay a Decke vpon his Pinnace, that before had not any, and now was taught by experience the neceſſitie of hauing that defect ſupplied.
            But thoſe hopes failed him (al being before that time ruined and diſperſed) ſo farre, as he ſaw it in vaine to hope for help by that means, and therfore attempted to make the beſt of what hee had of his owne. And going to ſet his men a worke, they all in a few dayes after their arriuall, fell ſicke of a difeaſe which hapned at that time in the country, ſo as now he was not onely forced to be without hope of their helping of him, but muſt labor himſelfe all he could to attend and ſuſtaine them; but ſo God fauoured him, that they recouered, and in time conuenient he diſpatched his buſineſſe there, and put himſelfe to Sea againe, reſoluing to accompliſh in his iourney backe to New-England, what in his laſt Diſcouery he had omitted.
            In his paſſage he met with certaine Hollanders, who had a trade in Hudſons riuer ſome yeares before that time, with whom he had conference about the ſtate of that coaſt, and their proceedings with thoſe people: whoſe anſwer gaue him good content. He betooke himſelfe to the following of his buſineſſe, diſcouering many goodly Riuers, and exceeding pleaſant, and fruitfull coaſts, and Iſlands, for the ſpace of 80. leagues from Eaſt to Weſt, for ſo that coaſt doth range along from Hudſons Riuer to Cape Iames.
            
            Now after we had found by Captaine Rocrafts relation made the yeare before, the hopes he conceiued of the benefits that coaſt would afford, towards the vpholding of the charge for ſetling our Plantation by reaſon of the commodities ariſing by fiſhing and furres, if a courſe might be taken for the mannaging of that buſineſſe, as was fit for ſuch a deſigne; as well as for the aduancement of the publique good of our whole Nation,

and ſatisfac
                  •••
               n of euery well diſpoſed perſon, that had a will to be intereſſed therein.
            It was held to be moſt conuenient to ſtrengthen our ſelues by a new Grant to be obtained from his royall Maicſtic: the rather, finding that thoſe of Virginia had by two ſeuerall Patents ſetled their bounds, and excluded all from intermedling with them that were not free of their Company; and had wholly altered the forme of their Gouernment, from the firſt ground layed for the managing the affaires of both Collonies, leauing vs as deſperate, and our buſineſſe as abandoned.
            Theſe conſiderations (as is ſaid) together with the neceſſitie of ſetling our affaires, bounds and limits, diſtinct from theirs, made vs reſolue to petition his Maicſtic for the renewing of our Grant.
            By which time the rumour of our hopes was ſo publiquely ſpread abroad, and the commodities of the Fiſh, and trade ſo looked into, as it was deſired, that all that coaſt might be made free, as well to thoſe of 
                  Ʋirginia, as to vs to make their commoditie: How iuſt or vniuſt that motion was, we will not argue, ſeeing the buſineſſe is ended.
            By this meanes, our proceedings were interrupted, and we queſtioned about it; firſt, by the Counſell of 
                  Ʋirginia, whom we thought to haue benefully ſatisfied therein, before we could haue way giuen vs for a new Patent, both parties hauing beene heard by certaine of the Lords of the Councell; and the buſineſſe by them ſo ordered, as we were directed to proceed and to haue our Grant agreeable to the libertie of the Virginia Company, the frame of our gouernment excepted; but this order not being liked of, it was againe heard & concluded. Laſtly, the Patent being paſt the Seale, it was ſtopt vpon new ſuggeſtions to the King, and by his Maieſtie referred to the Councell to be ſetled, by whom the former

Orders were confirmed, the difference cleared, and we ordered to haue our Patent deliuered vs.
            Theſe diſputes held vs almoſt two yeeres, ſo as all men were afraid to ioyne with vs, and we thereby left hopeleſſe of any thing more, than that which our owne fortunes would yeeld to aduance our proceedings, in which time ſo many accidents hapned vnto vs at home, and abroad, that wee were 
                  ••
               ine to giue order by the ſhips we ſent a fiſhing, for the retiring of Maſter Darmer, and his people, vntill all things were cleared, and we better prouided of meanes to goe through with our deſigne: but this worthy Gentleman confident of the good likely to enſue, and reſolutely reſoluing to purſue the ends he aymed at, could not be perſwaded to looke backe, as yet; and ſo refuſing to accept our offer, began againe to proſecute his Diſcouery, wherein he was betrayed by certaine new Saluages, who ſodainly ſet vpon him, giuing him foureteene or fifteene wounds, but by his valour, and dexteritie of ſpirit he freed himſelfe out of their hands, yet was conſtrained to retire into Virginia again the ſecond time, for the cure of his wounds, where he fell ſicke of the infirmities of that place, and thereof dyed: ſo ended this worthie Gentleman his dayes, after he had remained in the diſcouery of that coaſt two yeares, giuing vs good content in all hee vndertooke; and after he had made the peace between vs and the Saluages, that ſo much abhorred our Nation, for the wrongs done them by others, as you haue heard: but the fruit of his labour in that behalfe we as yet receiue to our great commoditie, who haue a peaceable plantation at this preſent among them, where our people both proſper, and liue in good liking, and aſſuredneſſe of their neighbours, that had beene formerly ſo much exaſperated againſt vs, as will more at large appeare hereafter.
            
               
But hauing paſſed all theſe ſtormes abroad, and vndergone ſo many home-bred oppoſitions, and freed our Parent, which we were by order of State aſſigned to renew, for the amendment of ſome defects therein contained, we were aſſured of this ground more boldly to proceed on than before; and therefore we tooke firſt to conſideration how to raiſe the meanes to aduance the plantation. In the examination thereof, two wayes did offer themſelues: The one was the voluntary contribution of the Patentees; The other, by an eaſie ranſoming of the freedomes of thoſe that had a will to partake onely of the preſent profits, ariſing by the trade, and fiſhing vpon the coaſt.
            The firſt was to proceed from thoſe Noble-men, and others that were Patentees, and they agreed by order among themſelues to disburſe a hundred pounds a peece, for the aduancement of ſuch neceſſary buſines, as they had in hand.
            The ſecond was to be accompliſhed by ſetling ſuch liberties and orders in the weſterne cities, and townes, as might induce euery reaſonable man, in, and about them, affecting the publike good, or a regular proceeding in the buſineſſe of trade, to embrace an vniformitie, and to ioyne in a communitie, or ioynt ſtocke together: How reaſonable, or vnreaſonable thoſe orders were, is hereafter to be ſeene, and iudged by euery well affected perſon, or any truly louing the publike good of our Nation, whereunto is annexed the difference of trading by a ioynt ſtocke vnder gouernment and orders and the promiſcuous trading without order, and in a diſ-joynted manner, as of late they haue done to the infinite preiudice of others already, as alſo to the loſſe of many of themſelues, that contemptuouſly and greedily haue leapt into that courſe, as it were in deſpight of all Authoritie, whoſe reward, in time, will follow.
            
               
Before theſe Orders were to be tendered to thoſe cities and townes, it was deſired that there might be letters ſent from their Lordſhips, admoniſhing them of his Maieſties royall Grant, that prohibiteth any not free of that buſines, to intermeddle within our limits, vpon paine of confiſcation of ſhip and goods. Theſe letters expreſſing withall the good affection of thoſe that were intereſſed in the buſineſſe, to entertaine any that ſhould be willing to conforme themſelues to ſuch orders, as had in that behalfe beene eſtabliſhed.
            But thoſe letters how full of Iuſtice ſoeuer they appeared, were as diſtaſtefull, as was the rumor of Order vnto them: for by it euery particular man thought himſelfe ſtrait debarred of libertie to run his owne currant, in which he thought his freedome did onely conſiſt; and by debarring him thereof, his priuate ends were ouerthrowne, which was to endeuour to preuent his neighbour of the market he aimed at, or the Harbour he reſolued to goe vnto, or the preſent trade hee expected to haue by his priuate induſtrie, but as for the publique hee cared not, let that fare as it would. While theſe things were in diſpute, and likely to haue taken a good foundation, the news of the Parliament flew to all parts, & then the moſt factious of euery place, preſently combined themſelues to follow the buſineſſe in Parliament, where they preſumed to proue the ſame to be a Monopolie, and much tending to the preiudice of the common good. But that there ſhould be a conformitie in trade, or a courſe taken to preuent the euills that were likely to enſue, or to appropriate poſſeſſions, or lands, after a generous manner, in remote parts of the world, to certaine publique perſons, of the common-wealth, for the taking care, and ſpending their time and means how to aduance the enlargement of their Countrey, the honour of their King, and glory of their God; theſe were

thought crimes worthy the taking notice of, and the principall Actors in this kinde, muſt be firſt traduced in priuate, then publiquely called vpon in Parliament, to anſwer ſuch other ſcandalls as could by malice be inuented.
            But as this buſineſſe was in it ſelfe iuſt, and righteous, ſo was it as earneſtly deſired, they might haue had the opportunitie to haue anſwered it before ſo vnpartiall Iudges, and ſo reuerend perſons; if ſo it might haue been without offence to the authoritie of his royall Maieſtie, that had extended it ſelfe by vertue of his Prerogatiue ſo farre off, and without the Lawes of this Realme, and to be put in execution without the publike expence, or charge of the common-wealth, or preiudice to any other former imployments of our Nation, and indeed without offence to any that couered not to put their ſickle into the harueſt of other men, or whoſe enuious & couetous humors ſtirred them not vp to ſhame themſelues in the concluſion.
            Theſe troubles thus vnfortunately falling out, haue notwithſtanding hindered vs from the hopes we had this yeare, to giue ſome life extraordinarily to thoſe affaires, & therefore we are forced of neceſſitie to refer the maine of our reſolution, till a more conuenient opportunitie, and till we haue gotten our ſhips and prouiſion fit to ſerue our turnes both to giue the Law along thoſe coaſts, and to performe ſuch other ſeruice, as is thereby intended for the publike good of our Aduenturers, and defence of our Marchants, that ſhall frequent thoſe places, according to ſuch Orders, as ſhall be found behouefull in that behalfe.
         
         
            
            The Clime and condition of the Country, and the preſent eſtate of our affaires there.
            
               YOu haue heard already the many diſaſters, calamities, misfortunes, oppoſitions, and hinderances we haue had, and receiued. Howbeit many are omitted, in that we deſire not to trouble the Reader with more than enough; or to affright the minds of weak ſpirits, that will beleeue there is no better ſucceſſe to be looked for from ſuch attempts: although it be true that the beſt deſignes do oftentimes cary with them the moſt impediments, whether it be that God will haue it ſo, to trie our conſtancie, or otherwiſe to make vs know, that it is he onely that worketh after his owne will, according to the time he hath aſſigned, and that there is nothing done but by him, as alſo that, that is onely beſt which hee will haue to be done, and that time moſt proper which he hath aſſigned for the ſame.
            But by theſe you may imagine (ſeeing we haue none other helps than our owne fortunes to build vpon) there can no great matters bee performed in theſe ſtormes and tempeſts. Notwithſtanding, you may know wee haue not beene more hindred one way, than bleſſed an other: for, as our patience, conſtancie, trauels and charge hath beene great, ſo hath it (indeed) manifoldly beene requited: For, by GODS fauour, and theſe Gentlemens induſtrie, we haue made a moſt ample diſcouerie of the moſt commodious Country for the benefit of our Nation, that euer hath beene found.
            For better ſatisfaction of the Reader in this behalfe,

we haue thought it fit, by the way, to acquaint him firſt with the nature of the place where wee haue ſetled our ſelues, whereby hee may ſee reaſon for what wee haue done, remembring him likewiſe, that in ſettling of plantations, there is principally to be conſidered: The aire, for the health of the Inhabitants. The ſoile, for fertilitie fit for corne, and feeding of cattle wherewith to ſuſtaine them The Sea, for commoditie of trade and commerce, the better to enrich their publique and priuate State, as it ſhall grow to perfection, and to raiſe imployments, to furniſh the courſe of thoſe affaires.
            Now for the quality of the Aire, there is none of iudgement but knowes it proceedeth either from the generall diſpoſition of the Sphere, or from the particular conſtitution of the place.
            Touching the diſpoſition of the Sphere, it is not onely ſeated in the temperate Zone, but as it were in the Center, or middle part thereof, for that the middle part of that Country hath about three hundred and ten degrees of Longitude; and ſtands in the forty fourth and forty fifth degrees of the Northerne Latitude, that is, twenty degrees from the fiery Tropicke, and as much from the freeſing Articke Circle: Vnder the ſame climate and courſe of the Sunne that Conſtantinople, and Rome, the Ladies of the World; Italy, and France, the Gardens of Europe, haue their ſituation, within the limits of the fifth and ſixt Climate, after the later computation; hauing their longeſt day fifteene houres and ſome odde minutes.
            Touching the conſtitution of the place (which is about ſixty two degrees by Sea from our Continent Weſterly) The Maritine parts thereof are ſomewhat colder, then the nature of the Clime otherwiſe affordeth; for that the beames of the Sunne are weakned, partly by the vnſtable reflection of the ſame vpon the

Sea, and partly by beeing laden with abundance of moiſture it exhales out of the vaſt Ocean, whereby the nature thereof is not ſo violently there expreſſed, as in the like parallel further into the maine is accuſtomed. Nor is that Sea coaſt ſo ſubiect to droughts or want of raine in ſeaſonable times, as other parts are of like Latitudes, and by that reaſon the Sea coaſts are at all times more cold then is the Inland. And the Eaſterne coaſt which receiueth the riſing of the Sunne, is likewiſe colder then are the Weſterne parts, towards the declining of the ſame, as our morning aires (for example) euen in the heat of Summer are cold and quicke, when the day and euening are very ſweltring. And this makes thoſe parts more ſutable to the nature of our people, who neither finde content in the colder Climates, nor health in the hotter; but (as hearbs and plants) affect their natiue temperature, and proſper kindly no where elſe.
            And indeed, the hot Countreys yeeld ſharper wits, but weaker bodies, and fewer children; the colder, more ſlow of conceit, but ſtronger of body, and more abounding in procreation. So that, though the inuention of Arts hath riſen from the Southerne Nations, yet they haue ſtill beene ſubiect to the inundations, and inuaſions of the more Northerly people, by reaſon of their multitudes, together with the ſtrength of their body, and hardneſſe of their conſtitutions.
            But this Country, what by the generall and particular ſituation, is ſo temperate, as it ſeemeth to hold the golden meane, and indeed is moſt agreeable to the nature of our owne, which is made manifeſt by experience, the moſt infallible proofe of all aſſertions; in ſo much as our people that are ſetled there, enioy their life and health much more happily,

then in other places; which can bee imputed to no other cauſe, then the temperature of the Climate.
            Now, as the Clime is found to bee ſo temperate, ſo delicate, and healthfull, both by reaſon and experience; ſuch is the ſoile alſo, ſome parts thereof yeelding wonderfull increaſe, both of the Corne, the Natiues haue moſt vſe of; as alſo of our owne, of all ſorts: with infinite variety of nouriſhing roots, and other herbes, and fruits, common among them, but rare with vs.
            Beſides, the Coaſt doth abound with moſt conuenient Hauens, and Harbors, full of ſingular Iſlands, fit for Plantation; repleniſhed with Plants and Wood of all ſorts; as Oake, Cedars, Spruce, Firre, Pyne, Walnut, Cheſtnut, Elme, Saſſafras, Plumtrees, and Calamus Aromaticus, &c.
            The people are tractable (if they bee not abuſed) to commerce and Trade withall, and as yet haue good reſpect of vs. The Seas are ſtored with all kindes of excellent fiſh, and in many places vpon the coaſt, fit to make Salt in. The Country aboundeth with diuerſity of wild foule, as Turkeys, Partriges, Swans, Cranes, wilde Geeſe of two ſorts, wilde Duckes of three ſorts, many Doues, eſpecially when Strawberies are ripe.
            There are ſeuerall ſorts of Deere in thoſe parts, and ſome that bring forth two, three, and foure young at once, which is a manifeſt proofe of the fertility of the Soile, or temper of the Clime, or both together.
            There is alſo a certaine Beaſt, that the Natiues call a Moſſe, hee is as big bodied as an Oxe, headed like a fallow Deere, with a broad Palme, which hee mues euery yeere, as doth the Deere, and necke like a Red Deere, with a ſhort mane, running downe along the raines of his backe, his haire long like an Elke, but

eſteemed to be better then that for Sadlers vſe, he hath likewiſe a great bunch hanging downe vnder his throat, and is of the colour of our blacker ſort of fallow Deere, his legges are long, and his feet as bigge as the feet of our Oxen, his taile is longer then the ſingle of a Deere, and reacheth almoſt downe to his huxens, his skinne maketh very good Buffe, and his fleſh is excellent good food, which the Natiues vſe to Ierkin and keepe all the yeere to ſerue their turne, and ſo prooues very ſeruiceable for their vſe. There haue beene many of them ſeene in a great Iſland vpon the Coaſt, called by our people Mount Manſell, whither the Saluages goe at certaine ſeaſons to hunt them; the manner whereof is, by making of ſeuerall fires, and ſetting the Countrey with people, to force them into the Sea, to which they are naturally addicted, and then there are others that attend them in their Botes with bowes and weapons of ſeuerall kindes, wherewith they ſlay and take at their pleaſure. And there is hope that this kinde of Beaſts may bee made ſeruiceable for ordinary labour with Art and Induſtry.
            The knowne Commodities of that Country, are Fiſh of ſeuerall ſorts, rich Furres, as Beauers, Otters, Martins, blacke Fox, Sables, &c. There are likewiſe plenty of Vines, of three kindes, and thoſe pleaſant to the taſte, yet ſome better then other. There is Hempe, Flax, Silkgraſſe, ſeuerall veines of Ironſtone, commodities to make Pitch, Roſen, Tarre; Deale boords of all ſorts, Sparres, Maſts, for Ships of all burdens; in a word, there comes no commodity out of France, Germany, or the Sound, but may be had there, with reaſonable labour and induſtry.
            Further, wee haue ſetled at this preſent, ſeuerall Plantations along the Coaſt, and haue granted Patents to many more that are in preparation to bee gone with

all conueniencie. Thoſe of our people that are there, haue both health and plenty, ſo as they acknowledge there is no want of any thing, but of induſtrious people, to reape the commodities that are there to be had, and they are indeed ſo much affected to the place, as they are loth to be drawne from thence, although they were directed to returne to giue ſatisfaction to thoſe that ſent them, but choſe rather to performe that office by letters, together with their excuſe, for breach of their duty in that behalfe. And thus you ſee there is no labour well imployed, but hath his reward at one time or other.
            Theſe incouragements haue imboldned vs to proceed, to the ingaging of our ſelues, for the building of ſome Ships of good burden, and extraordinary Mould, to lie vpon the Coaſt for the defenſe of Merchants and Fiſhermen, that are imployed there, as alſo to Waft the Fleets, as they goe to and from their Markets: and we purpoſe from henceforth to build our ſhipping there, where wee find all commodities fit for that ſeruice, together with the moſt opportune places, that can bee deſired.
            Laſtly, finding that wee haue ſo far forth preuailed, as to winde our ſelues into familiarity with the Natiues, (which are in no great number) along the Coaſt for two hundred Leagues together, wee haue now diſpatched ſome of our people of purpoſe, to diue into the bowels of the Continent, there to ſearch and finde out what Port, or Place, is moſt conuenient to ſettle our maine Plantation in, where wee meane to make the Reſidencie of our State and Gouernment, as alſo to bee aſſured, what other commodities may be raiſed for the publique, and priuate benefit of thoſe that are dealers in that buſineſſe, and willing to bee intereſſed in any the Lands there: Whither is gone this yeere already,

for Trade and Fiſhing onely, thirty Saile of the better ſort of Ships, belonging to the Weſterne parts, beſides thoſe who are gone for tranſportation of the Planters, or ſupply of ſuch as are already planted, whoſe returne (as is ſuppoſed) will amount (at the leaſt) to thirty thouſand pound, the greater part whereof comes home in Bullion.
            
            And therefore as touching the third happineſſe of theſe parts, which is the Sea, there needeth no other or greater commendation then this benefit of Fiſhing aſſured vnto vs by common Experience; although it affords many other hopes both in regard of the facilitie of the nauigation, the boldneſſe of the Coaſt, the conueniency of Roades, Hauens and Harbors, for performance of all manner of imployments; yet is there alſo found Showes of Pearle, Ambergrees, great numbers of Whales, and other marchantable meanes to raiſe profit to the induſtrious Inhabitants or diligent Traders.
            Heere you may ſee to what profit our induſtry and charge hath beene imploied; what benefit our Countrey is like to receiue by it, and whether it bee reaſon wee ſhould bee ſo traduced, as we haue beene, wee ſeeking nothing more then the glory of God, the enlarging of his Highneſſe Dominions, and generall good of all his Maieſties loyall ſubiects, and ſtriuing for the better accompliſhment therof to keepe Order, and ſettle Gouernment in thoſe affaires, to preſerue from ruine and confuſion ſo faire a foundation, whereon is likely to bee built the goodlieſt frame that hath euer beene vndertaken to be raiſed by our Nation.
         
         
            
            The Platforme of the gouern
               ment, and Diuiſions of the Terri
               tories in generall.
            
               AS there is no Common-wealth that can ſtand without gouernment, ſo the beſt gouernments haue euer had their beginnings from one ſupreme head, who hath diſpoſed of the adminiſtration of Iuſtice, and execution of publike affaires, either according to lawes eſtabliſhed, or by the aduice, or counſell of the moſt eminent, diſcreeteſt, and beſt able in that kinde. The verity of this is ſo cleere, as it needs no example: for that indeed all nations from the beginning, vnto this preſent, follow ſtill the ſame rule in effect, howſoeuer they vary in the forme, or ſome ſmall circumſtances.
            And vpon this generall ground, the Kings of theſe our Realmes did firſt lay the foundations of their Monarchies; reſeruing vnto themſelues the ſoueraigne Power of all (as fit it was) and diuiding their kingdomes into Counties, Baronries, Hundreds, and the like; inſtituted their Lieutenants, or Officers, meet to gouerne thoſe Subdiuiſions, that the Subiect might with the more eaſe receiue iuſtice, and the Soueraignes at more leaſure the better able to diſpoſe of matters of greater conſequence.
            This foundation being ſo certaine, there is no reaſon

for vs to vary from it, and therefore we haue reſolued to build our Edifices vpon it, and to frame the ſame after the platforme already layd, and from whence wee take our denomination. So as we purpoſe to commit the managing of our whole affaires there in generall, vnto a Gouernour, to be aſſiſted by the aduice and counſel of ſo many of the Patentees as ſhall be there reſident, together with the Officers of State, that is to ſay; The Treaſurer for the managing of the treaſure and reuenues belonging to that State. The Martiall for matters of Armes, and affaires of warres, be it defenſiue or offenſiue. The Admirall for maritine buſineſſe ciuill or criminall, and the forces belonging to the Sea. The maſter of the ordnance for munition, artillery and other prouiſions for publique ſtore of Armies by Sea or Land; as alſo ſuch other perſons of iudgement and experience, as by the Preſident and Counſell eſtabliſhed here, for the better gouerning of thoſe affaires ſhall be thought fit.
            By this Head, and theſe Members, vnited together, the great affaires of the whole State is to be managed, according to their ſeuerall authorities, giuen them from their Superiours, the Preſident and Councell eſtabliſhed as aforeſaid.
            And for that all men by nature are beſt pleaſed to be their owne caruers, and doe moſt willingly ſubmit to thoſe Ordinances, or Orders whereof themſelues are authors: it is therefore reſolued, that the generall lawes whereby that State is to be gouerned, ſhall be firſt framed and agreed vpon by the generall aſſembly of the States of thoſe parts, both Spirituall and Temporall.
            For the better diſtinction whereof, and the more orderly proceeding, agreeable (as is ſaid) to the preſent State of this our Realme, two parts of the whole Territorie is to be diuided betweene the Patentees, into ſeuerall

Counties, to be by themſelues or their friends planted, at their pleaſure or beſt commoditie. The other third part is to be reſerued for publique vſes, to be belonging to the State, as their reuenew for defraying of publique charge.
            But as well this third part, as the two formerly ſpoken of, is to be diuided into Counties, Baronries, Hundreds, and the like, from all which the Deputies for euery County, and Baronry, are to be ſent in the name and behalfe of the Subiects, vnder them to conſult and agree vpon the Lawes ſo to be framed, as alſo to reforme any notable abuſes committed in former proceedings.
            Yet theſe are not to be aſſembled, but by order from the Preſident and Councell heere, who are to giue life to the Lawes ſo to be made, as thoſe to whom of right it beſt belongs, according to his Maieſties royall grant in that behalfe, as alſo that vnder God, and his Sacred Highneſſe, they are the principall Authors of that foundation. And thus much for the generall forme of our Gouernment.
            In like manner are the Counties to be gouerned by the chiefe Head or Deputy thereof with other Officers vnder him. As his Steward, Comptroller, Treaſurer of his reuenews; and ſo the Baronries by their Stewards, and other inferiour miniſters, who are to haue aſſigned them the power of high and low Iuſtice within themſelues for determining of Controuerſies, with reſeruation of Appeale in ſome caſes to the ſupreme Courts.
            And further, theſe Lords of Counties may of themſelues ſubdiuide their ſaid County into Mannors and Lordſhips, as to them ſhall ſeeme beſt, giuing to the Lords thereof power of keeping of Courts, and Leets, as is heere vſed in England, for the determining of petty

matters, ariſing betweene the Lords, and the Tenants, or any other.
            And there is no leſſe care to be taken for the trade and publique commerce of Merchants, whoſe gouernment ought to be within themſelues, in reſpect of the ſeuerall occaſions ariſing betweene them, the tradeſmen, and other the Mechanickes, with whom they haue moſt to doe: and who are generally the chiefe inhabitants of great Citties, and Townes, in all parts; it is likewiſe prouided, that all the Cities in that Territory, and other inferiour Townes where Tradeſ-men are in any numbers, ſhall be incorporate and made bodies politique, to gouerne their affaires and people as it ſhall be found moſt behouefull for the publique good of the ſame; according vnto the greatnes or capacity of them, who ſhall be made likewiſe capable to ſend certaine their Deputies, or Burgeſſes to this publique aſſembly, as members thereof, and who ſhall haue voyces equall with any the reſt.
            BY this you ſee our maine drift is but to take care for the well ordering of the buſineſſe, ſeeking by all meanes to auoyd (what we may) the intermedling with any mens monies, or diſpoſing of any mens fortunes, ſaue onely our owne; leauing to euery particular vndertaker the imployment of their aduentures, and the raiſing of their profits, out of their proper limits, and poſſeſſions, as ſhall ſeeme beſt to themſelues, or their officers, or miniſters, whom they imploy, and whom they may be bold to queſtion, or diſplace, as to themſelues ſhall ſeeme moſt fitting.
            And hereby all men may know, that as it is not in our wills to delude and deceiue any, ſo wee are carefull not to giue the leaſt cauſe of ſuſpicion of any euill in that kinde; ſo much the rather for that wee daily ſee by experience,

the abuſes committed in like caſes by inferiour miniſters, to be a notable cauſe to dehort the good diſpoſitions of many otherwiſe well affected to Plantations, for that they obſerue thoſe that are ſo imployed to grow rich, and their aduentures to come to nothing.
            And wee further deſire that all men ſhould bee perſwaded, wee couet not to engroſſe any thing at all vnto our ſelues, but that wee ſhould bee exceeding glad to finde more of our Nation, ſo free in diſpoſition, as to partake with vs, as well in the profit, as in the future trauell, and charge thereof; without looking backe to our expence, or labour already paſt, to the end that all our hands being vnited together, the worke may bee ſo much the ſooner aduanced, well knowing and freely confeſſing, that it is ſufficient to giue content to a multitude, and that of all ſorts. For ſuch as are truely Pious, ſhall finde heere the opportunity to put in practiſe the workes of piety, both in building of Churches, and raiſing of Colledges for the breeding of youth, or maintenance of Diuines and other learned men. If they be ſuch as affect Glory, and to continue their memory to future ages, they may haue heere the meanes to raiſe Houſes, Pariſhes, yea Townes, or Prouinces, to their Names and Poſterity. Doe they aime at wealth? heere is the way for their induſtry to ſatiate their appetites in that, if they be not vnſatiable. Doe they long after pleaſure? here is as much to be had as may content any, not meerely voluptuous, or onely prodigall. Doe they aſp
                  •
               re to be Commanders? here is the place where they may haue command of their owne friends, or tenants, if they be of any worth, or meanes extraordinary wherewith to tranſport any numbers. If otherwiſe of experience and vertue, it is likely they may attaine places of gouernement for the publique State. So as you ſee there wants no occaſions, or opportunity to inuite, or

giue ſatisfaction to ſuch as haue patience to attend the time.
            And indeed we ſhall be glad, that this, or any thing elſe may induce a free and noble reſolution, in any well affected perſon, to endeuour the aduancement of theſe ends, together with vs, in that they ſhall finde them agreeable to honour, and honeſtie; and if there bee any that can adde ought vnto our endeuours, by their aduice or otherwiſe, there is none that ſhall more readily embrace the ſame then wee; whoſe intents are onely framed for the proſperity of the buſineſſe, as is already ſaid, and as we hope will all thoſe be, that ſhall aſſent to ioyne with vs, both in the labor, profit, and honour, without reſpect to the weakeneſſe of the motiue, by which it hath beene heeretofore mooued, or any thing ſaue the worke it ſelfe. For by it you ſhall finde the Honour of our God, our King, and Nation, will bee aduanced, without effuſion of Chriſtian bloud, or queſtion of wrong to the preſent Inhabitants. For that they themſelues both deſire it, & we intēd not to take ought, but what they that are there, are willing wee ſhould bee ſeized of, both for the defence of them againſt their Enemies, and their preſeruation in peace among themſelues, & propagation of the Chriſtian Faith, which with wonderfull alacrity many of them ſeeme to giue care vnto, and for whoſe ſpeedy conuerſion wee intend to bee as carefull as of our owne happineſſe; and as diligent to build them houſes, and to prouide them Tutors for their breeding, and bringing vp of their children, of both ſects, as to aduance any other buſineſſe whatſoeuer, for that wee acknowledge our ſelues ſpecially bound thereunto. And this being done, to referre the ſucceſſe, to the Author of Heauen and Earth, to whom be all Honour and glory.
            FINIS.
