               SIr, I willingly acknowledge that by two assured bands of loue and duty, I am obliged vnto you. The former arose from that vnsained affection which I euer bare from my first acquaintance in our Colledge towards those three Gentlemen your sonnes: In whom I haue alwaies both entirely loued and honoured those excellent vertues which giue an assured promise of much comfort to their Parents, and fruit vnto their Countrey, and of their happie succeeding in those vertuous steps of piety and true honour, which both your selfe, and their most renowmed Grandfather of honourable and blessed memorie, Sir Walter Mildmay haue trode before them.

I am further engaged vnto you by that most louing respect it pleased you to haue of me, when contrary to the corrupt custome of many Patrones in this age, of your owne accord you called me to this place, my selfe being farre absent, and neither knowing nor once dreaming thereof. In regard of both which, if I present vnto you these small fruits of my studies in that place, which by your meanes I quietly enioy, I nothing doubt but you will receiue them not onely as an assured pledge of my loue vnto you, but specially as a fit argument whereon to exercise your religious meditations and retired thoughts amids those manifold encombrances and troubled affaires which you now sustaine: to all which wishing an happy end and issue, and to your selfe encrease of all Gods graces and blessings, I take my leaue.

            A SERMON OF Sanctification.
            
               
                  1. THESSALON. 5.23.
                  Now the very God of peace sanctifie you throughout, and I pray God that your whole spirit, and soule, and body may be kept blamelesse vnto the comming of our Lord Iesus Christ.
               
            
            
               WHat blessing the Apostle praied for the Thessalonians in this his conclusion and valediction vnto them, the same do I wish vnto you, Reuerend, and right Worshipfull, beloued in our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ, in this which I intend to be my last speech in this kind and my valediction to this place, to which with the like, & euen the same Christian duty, but with farre more and more effectuall bands of priuate affection, I am more neerely tied and linckt, than was euer S. Paul (as I suppose) to the Church and Saints of Thessalonica. In the Apostles praier there are foure seueral points to be considered: First, the blessing which he praied for, and that was sanctification and holinesse. [Sanctifie you, and keepe you blamelesse.] Secondly, the Author and worker of this sanctification, and that is God, who is heere described by one speciall title, noting both his loue vnto vs, and our loue one toward another. [The very God of peace sanctifie you.] Thirdly, the maner of this sanctification, which is, that it must be totall and entire, whereof two speciall branches are heere set downe: The one internall in the spirit, that is in our mind or vnderstanding; and in our soule, that is in our will and affections: The other externall in

our bodies and outward actions. [Sanctifie you throughout that

               ion and holinesse. A duty so often required of vs in holy scripture, that I may truly say of it, the whole Law, the Prophets and the Apostles do all aime at this. In the 19. of Exod. 
               v. 5.6. God seue
                  •
               ing his people from all other nations, makes sanctity and holinesse to bee the badge of them. If ye will heare my voice indeed, and keep my couenant, then shall yee bee my chiefe treasure aboue all people, ye shall be also a kingdome of Priests, and an holy nation vnto me. In the 4. of Esay

                   4. where speaking to euery one of his children hee saith, Thou shalt bee called Hephzabah, for the Lord delighteth in thee: that they are to him for their renown

as kings, for sanctity as a kingdome of Priests. That as the Priests in the old Law Ex 28.30. were not only to haue V
                     •
                  im and Thummim vpon their breast plate, to signifie that inward light of knowledge and perfection of piety, that should bee in their hearts, but to weare also a plate of pure gold vpon their foreheads, whereon was engrauen as on a signet Holinesse to the Lord. So euery true Christian and childe of God being now by Christ himselfe, and by his spirit appointed and anointed to be a Priest vnto God, to offer vp not only those other spirituall sacrifices of praier, praise and thanksgiuing, which the Prophet Hos. 14.3. calles the Calues of our lips, but that which the Apostle Rom. 12.1 reckons as the chiefe sacrifice of all other, to offer vp our selues, our soules and bodies as a liuing sacrifice holy and acceptable vnto God, they should all so shine foorth in piety, and in the vertues of a godly life, as if continually they did weare that Leuiticall plate, or had engrauen in Capitall and faire letters vpon their foreheads, that is, in true and reall actions of their liues and conuersation, Holinesse vnto the Lord.
            
            Let me then in a word exhort and beseech euery one of you to embrace this sanctity and holinesse of life. Ye are the houses Heb. .3 6. yea the temples of God, now the 1 Cor. 3.16 temple of God is holie which ye are, and Psal. 93.5. holinesse becomes the Lords house for euer: ye are the children of God, and therefore must beare the print and image of your father which is Eph. 4.24. righteousnesse and true holinesse, that as 1. Pet. 1.15.16. he which hath called you is holy, so ye may be holy in all maner of conuersation, because it is written, Bee ye holy for I am holy. Yee are fellow Citizens Eph. 2.19. with the Saints, let your conuersation (as the Apostle Psal. 3.20 saith) bee in heauen, that is, an holy conuersation, which is in truth an heauenly conuersation, as first descending from God, and from heauen, and then most vndoubtedly making you to ascend to God, and vnto heauen.
            Sanctitie and holinesse is the very end of our election, for God Eph 1.4. hath chosen vs, that wee should bee holy and without blame before him. It is the end of our redemption, for Christ hath redeemed vs, that Luk. 1.74. we being deliuered from our enemies should serue him in holinesse and righteousnesse all the daies

of our liues. It is the end of our vocation that 1. Thes 4.4.7. euery one should possesse his vessell in holinesse and honour, for God hath called vs not vnto vncleannesse, but vnto holinesse.
            Without this, had ye all the blessings that mortality doth possesse, or mans heart can desire, yet neuer can they bring either true happinesse, or sound comfort vnto the mind. Riches are accounted a great blessing of God, and indeed they are euen a crowne of glory, when they are found in the way of righteousnesse, but without sanctity all the wealth in the world is woorse than pouerty. A small Psal. 37.
                     •
                  6. thing that the righteous hath is better than great riches of the vngodly. Better Prou. 15.16. & cap. 16.18. is a little, euen a morsell of bread, and a dinner of green and sowre herbs, with the seare of God, and with righteousnesse, than is a stalled oxe, and the reuenues of iniquitie. Godlinesse of it selfe is gaine, yea as the Apostle 1. Tim. 
                     •
                  .6. saith, it is great gaine, for it ca. 4.8. hath the promise both of this life, and of the life to come, and by it we assuredly gaine Gods fauour in this present life, and eternall felicitie in the life to come. And no Psal. 84.11. good thing shall God withhold from him that leades a godly life: but of all other gaine and aduantage without this, it is most true which our Sauiour saith, Luk. 9.25. What aduantageth it a man to gaine the whole world, and lose his owne soule? Or what canst thou or any man giue for the recompence of his soule vnto God?
            Honour and renowne a great blessing of God, God himselfe threatning it as a curse vnto the wicked, that hee will make them a reproach, Deut. 28 37 Ier. 24 9. a prouerbe, and a common talke among the people, yea a detestation and hisling as the Prophet Ier. 25 9. speaketh; but except the ground and foundation of a mans honor be sanctitie and holinesse, whose praise (as the Apostle Rom 2.29. saith) is not of men, but of God; all our honour is nothing else, but an idle bruit, and blast of the people, a vaine tympany and swelling of a mans name, whose root as the Prophet I
                     •
                  sa. 5.24. saith is rottennesse, and the bud thereof shall vanish into dust, yea into dung. 1. Mac. 2.62 In the 1. Chro. 4. v. 10. It is said of Iabesh that he was more honourable than his brethren, and the reason is set downe in the next verse, for Iabesh called on the God of Israel, that is, was a religious and holy man. On the contrary, 2. Chron. 26.

               1 Maca. 2.18. It is said of V
                  •
               ziah when hee had lifted vp his heart against God, Thou hast transgressed, thou shalt haue none honour of the Lord. God makes no other reckoning of the wicked and vngodly, be they neuer so glorious in the reputation and eies of men, but as of ignominious and vile persons. And so hee expresly cals them, Psa. 15 Vers. 4.. In whose eies a vile person is contemned: and that wicked king Antiochus, who was surnamed by men Epiphanes, that is, illustrious and glorious, yet euen this Epiphanes in the 11. Vers. 21 of Daniel is entituled by God himselfe a vile person: In his place shall stand vp a vile person. Whereas all the godly and holy seruants of the Lord in the 4. of Esay are not only called glorious, The Vers 2. bud of the Lord shall be beautifull and glorious, but euen glory it selfe, Vpon Vers 5. all the glory shall be a defence, that is, vpon all Gods children. The reason of all which is either that which S. Peter giues, 1. epist. 4. chap. 
               Vers. 1. Because the spirit of glory, which is the spirit of sanctification, doth rest on them: or else that which God himselfe giues, 1. Sam. 2. Vers 3. Them that honour me, will I honour: but they that despise me they shall be despised.
            Learning and knowledge a singular & rare blessing of God, of which S. Austen truly saith, in his fourth booke of Confess. and 16. chap. Scis tu Domine Deus quòd & celeritas intelligendi. & discendi acumen donum tuum est, sed non inde tibi facrificabam. Both the sharpnesse of wit to apprehend, and quicknesse of vnderstanding to discerne and iudge, they are both thy gifts, O God, though oftentimes for these we do not sacrifice to thee, but to our selues. But had wee all the learning that mans wit can comprehend, knew we not only fiue and twenty as did Mithridates,

Cor. 13 2. all knowledge, and yet had not sanctity and holinesse, which is contained in the loue of God, and of our neighbours, as S. Austen rightly expounds 
                  Lib. 15. de trinit. ca. 18. it, I might truly say not only with the Poet 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , all this knowledge were as nothing, but more peremptorily with the Apostle, we our selues were nothing. The reason whereof, S. Austen giues in his fift booke of Confess. and fourth chapter. Infoelix

And for my owne part I suppose and dare confidently auerre, that neuer was this Iland in any age so abundantly, I say not furnished, but euen blest and beautified, not onely with the substance, but with the ornaments also of all learning, as in this our age, and in the two most happy raignes of this and our late, both most renowmed and incomparable Princes, since those darke mistes of superstition and Idolatry haue beene dispelled and abandoned.

That yee would ioyne as S. Peter 2.

Iohn testifieth 1 Ioh. 2.4. He that saith he knowes him, and keepes not his commandements is a lyar, and the trueth is not in him; and of which our Sauiour saith, Ioh. 17 3. This is eternall life, to know thee to be the onely very God, and him whom thou hast sent Iesus Christ. And seeing sanctitie and holinesse is both the badge and cognizance of Gods children and seruants, the end of their vocation and calling, the onely meanes to make all other gifts of God to be true blessings vnto vs, without which they are indeed blessings in themselues, but to vs they shall be turned (as the Prophet Mala. 2.2. saith) into cursings: I conclude this my exhortation vnto you with those fewe, but most effectuall words of the Apostle, Heb. 12.14. Follow peace with all men, and holinesse, without which no man shall see the Lord. And this be spoken of the first point, namely the subiect of the Apostles praier, which is sanctification and holinesse.
            
               God sanctifie you.] The second point which I proposed was the author and worker of this sanctification, and that is heere set downe to be God himselfe, [God sanctifie you:] for whence els can any sanctitie or holinesse proceed, but onely from him who is first of himselfe and essentially holy? yea as S.

            As for the maner of this working of God in our hearts, though I may not in this straitnesse of time at large staie to vnfolde it, yet suffer me in this place especially, though but in few words to touch the same, the rather because hereon in my opinion depends the very point, and maine issue of the whole controuersie twixt vs and them. For it is most iniurious to the grace of God which they teach, that in our conuersion Gods grace is onely excitans gratia, as if by it we were only awakened out of some slumber or sleepe in sinne. The efficacy of which grace consists, as they suppose, in those motions, inducements, and suggestions, which God proposeth to our vnderstanding, that our reason being enlightned and enformed thereby, our will of it selfe without any further agencie or speciall worke of God may at his owne choice freely yeeld, or denie assent thereto.

               . And to omit other citations in his 6. booke 15. chap. and 8. proposition, he expresly saith, Gratia dei quantumuis essicax, nihil est aliud nisi suasio, quae non determinat voluntatem, sed inclinat per modum proponentis obiecti, the grace of God how effectuall soeuer it be, is nothing els but a suggestion and motion which doth not determine the will, but incline it by proposing obiects vnto it.
            I will heere omit what before out of the Scripture is declared, that Gods grace in our conuersion is not onely an excitant, but a viuificant grace, whereby we are not wakened, but reuiued and quickned, as the Apostle saith, from the death of sinne; as also that it is not onely an alluring or perswading, but an attracting, and drawing grace, as both Christ himselfe witnesseth Ioh. 6.44., None can come to me except the father draw him, and his Church acknowledgeth Cant. 1.3., Draw me, and we will run after thee. Of which drawing S. Ierome truely obserues, handling those words of our Sauiour in his 3. booke aduersus Pelagiano

                  , frangit superbientem arbitrij libertatem, this doth ouerthrow the arrogant freedome of our wil: for he that is drawen comes not of his owne will, sed aut retrectans & tardus, aut inuitus adducitur, but either with strugling or vnwillingly is hee brought vnto Christ.
            But to omit these, S. Austen is most cleere and pregnant in refuting these new Romish, but in verie deed old Pelagian fancies. In his first booke against Pelag. and Celest. 10. chap. he first shewes how Pelagius with these very answers of Bellarmine, shifted off that testimony of S. Paul. It is God that worketh in vs to will, he works it, said Pelagius, when by reuealing wisedome in desiderium Dei stupentem sus

                  re omne bonū, aduise and counsell vs vnto all goodnesse. Thus said Pelagius▪ 
               Sed nos eam gratiam nolumus, saith S. Austen, but this is not that grace which the Scripture, & which we do teach, for it is not enough that the promises be proposed, vnlesse they be beleeued, nor that wisedome be reuealed, vnlesse it be loued, nec suadetur solum omne quod bonum est, verùm & persuadetur, neither doth Gods grace in our conuersion onely counsell and perswade vs vnto good, but it makes a man effectually to yeeld vnto Gods motions and perswasions: and in the 24. chap. speaking of this very worke of God, which is as he there saith, inward and hidden, he addes, mirabili ac ineffabili potestate operatur Deus in cordibus hominum, non solùm veras reuelationes, sed etiam bonas voluntates, that God by a wonderfull and ineffable power, (which must needs be more then any perswasion) doth worke in mens mindes not onely true Reuelations (which is wrought vpon the reason) but good affections and desires, which is wrought immediately vpon the will. The very same doth he againe teach in his 107. epist. where purposely he refutes Vitalis for saying, that to consent to Gods calling or his Gospell was not any speciall gift of God, but an act flowing from the freedome of our will, when our vnderstanding is enlightned by the doctrine of God. As also in his booke de spir. & lit. 34. chap. where hauing declared how God vseth these perswasions vnto vs, whether externall in his word preached, or internall in the eares of our hearts (which in the Scripture Matt. 22.14. Apoc 3.20. are fitly termed the vocation and calling, or the knocking of God at our hearts) he truely saith, that to consent or dissent is an act indeed of our will, but this that we doe consent is the gift and worke of God in our hearts, which worke he elsewhere more especially declares, to consist not onely in setting those obiects before our minde or will, but praebendo

he saith, not from the freedome of our will, but from the spirit of God which is giuen vnto vs. And afterwards 
                  Cap. 34 hee moues (as he well termes it) a profound, but a verie notable question to this purpose, how it comes to passe that when God vseth the same or the like perswasions and suggestions to two mē, vni ita suadeatur vt persuadeatur, the one is effectually perswaded, & not the other: did mans conuersion depend on mans owne will? he might most easily haue answered this question, because the one by the freedome of his will assented vnto Gods motions, and the other by the like freedome of his will dissented there from, or else because to the one, the perswasions and suggestions were congruous and fitting, and not vnto the other. But S. Austen knowing right well, that it might iustly & no doubt would againe be replied, what should worke the congruitie of the ones will vnto Gods perswasions, and not of the other? which he saw could be referred to no other cause but onely to the grace of God giuen to the one, and not giuen to the other, therefore he tels vs, that hee can giue no other answer to that question, but that of the Apostle, Rom. 11 33. 
               O altitudo, O the depth of Gods iudgements▪ who of his mercy giues his grace, and thereby makes the one willing to turne to God, and so hee is effectually perswaded, and in his iustice withholdes that grace from the other, and so he remains stil vnwilling & vnperswaded. In which answer, as being most sufficient, S. Austen so fully rests himselfe, that he addes this conclusion, If any desire a better answer, quaerat doctiores, let him seeke to those that are more learned, but take heed he finde not those that are more presumptuous.
            Thus we see that there is a further working of Gods grace on our wils, besides that illumination & perswasion which is wrought on our vnderstanding: for though it be most true which both Philosophers and the Schoolemen teach, that the will doth euer follow the last iudgement and conclusion of our practike reason, yet because (which is most specially to be obserued in this point) euen this last iudgement of our reason is subiect to the power & arbitrement of our will, that so hauing had a most pregnant and fit reason and conclusion proposed

Da Domine quod iubes. & iube quod vis, Giue me O Lord ability to doe what thou commandest, and command me what thou wilt. To which purpose he again most fitly saith in his booke De corrept. & grat. 2. chap. speaking of precepts, reproofes, and praiers, O homo in praeceptione cognosce quid debeas habere, in correptione cognosce tuo te vitio non habere, in oratione cognosce vnde accipias quod vis habere: O man, by Gods commandements thou maiest learne what is thy dutie, and what thou oughtest to doe; by Gods reproofe thou maiest learne it is thy owne fault that it thou canst not doe; by thy owne prayer to God thou maiest learne of whom to seeke, that it thou maiest be able to doe.
            Besides which vse, rightly noted by S. Austen, to giue yet further satisfaction to this doubt; Is it indeed folly or vanitie, as they collect, to command man to doe that which is no way in his free will or abilitie to performe?

                   4.5. &c.. What a ridiculous matter might it seeme for the Prophet to command and exhort the dead bones to come together? yet when the Prophet at Gods commandement, and from God prophecied vnto them, and said; O drie bones heare the word of the Lord, the bones came together bone vnto bone, and as he continued prophesying, the sinewes and the flesh grew vpon the bones, and the skinne couered the flesh.

            Wherefore to end this argument, wherein by reason partlie of the obscuritie, and partly of the varietie of the matter, I haue stood longer then I first intended, I conclude this whole point with that short sentence of S. Austen in his 3. booke De lib. arb. 16. chap. Deus & velle praecepit, & posse prael uit, & non impune nolle permisit: God commands all men to be willing, he giues vnto some his grace to be able, he permits others to remaine vnwilling, but neuer withall to remaine vnpunished. And this be spoken of the author of our sanctification, which is God, of whom the Apostle heere desires this sanctity when he praied, God sanctifie you.
            
            
               God of peace.] The title which the Apostle giues to God is not lightly to be ouerpassed, in that he heere calles him the very God of peace. And though many reasons might be alledged why God is so called, yet for our present purpose I will propose but one, which is to put vs all in minde of that Christian charitie, peace and concord which ought to be among all Gods children, seeing this God, who is God and father vnto vs all, is the God of vnitie and loue; and as the Apostle heere describeth him, The very God of peace.
            And truely whether it be to teach vs the necessitie of this lesson, or to signifie our dulnesse and frowardnesse in learning and practising thereof, or for some other reason, I cannot tell, but I verily suppose that neither any one doctrine is more often vrged in the whole Scripture, then is this doctrine of charitie, nor any one sinne more often and more earnestly reprooued therein, then is the want of charitie. Our Sauiour tels Mat 22.39. vs that of the two great commandements whereon depends the

whole Law and the Prophets, the one is this lesson of loue and charitie. And lest any should imagine that himselfe had abrogated any part of that law, hee renues Ioh. 1

Of this the Apostle Gal. 5 14 testifies, The whole law is fulfilled in one word, which is this, Thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe; & Rom. 1

            I will end this my exhortation vnto you with those words of the Prophet, Psal. 34.12.14. What man is he that would liue and faine see good daies? keepe th
                  •
                toong from euill, and thy lippes that they speake no guile, eschew euill, and doe good, seeke peace, and follow after it.
            Now as charitie is most acceptable, and like the ointment of Aaron Psal. 133 2. pleasing vnto God, so doe the Scriptures in infinite places witnesse how much God hateth and detesteth the want

of charity; yet out of that maine Ocean I will but take one drop or two. In the 1. v. 3.4.5. of Amos God threatneth to breake the bars of Damascus, and send a fire into the house of Hazael, and deuour the palaces of Benhadad; and why? because they were not satisfied with the ouerthrow of the Gileadites their enemies, but further without all compassion to wreake their wrath vpon them, they threshed Gilead and that with threshing instruments of iron. Likewise in the second chap. v. 1.2. God threatens to destroy the Moabites, and that they shall die with shouting, & with the sound of a trumpet, because they were not contented onely to spoile the Edomites, though they were not theirs onely, but Gods enemies, but to satisfie their rage and malice, they burnt the bones of the king of Edom into lime. This is that which God so earnestly reprooues in the Edomites, in the prophesie of Obadiah 
               v. 10. ad 16., & threatens for this cause to cut them off for euer. Thou shouldest not haue beholden the day of thy brother when he was made a stranger, thou shouldest not haue reioiced in the day of their destruction, nor haue spoken proudly in the day of affliction, neither shouldst thou haue looked on their affliction in the day of their destruction; but as thou hast done, it shall be done to thee, thy reward shall be vpon thine owne head.
            I might adde heereto a further iudgement of God, mentioned in the Apostle, 1. Ioh. 3.15. Whosoeuer hateth his brother is a manslayer, & yee know that no manslayer hath eternall life abiding in him. But hauing spoken thus much concerning that brotherly charitie and peace which wee ought to haue one towards another, I would gladly adde somewhat of that peace, which we all iointly owe vnto the Church of God.
            Of this peace the prophet Dauid saith Ps. 122.6.7., O pray for the peace of Ierusalem, they shall prosper that loue thee, Peace be within thy wals. Of this the Apostle saith Rom. 16.17.18., I beseech you marke them diligently which cause diuision and offences contrary to the doctrine which yee haue receiued, and auoid them, for they that are such serue not the Lord Iesus, for 1.

               ▪ you should haue borne with whatsoeuer, rather then haue made a rent in the Church of God. It is a more glorious martyrdome to suffer for auoiding a schisme, then for auoiding the sinne of Idolatry. In the one you suffer martyrdome but for one soule, in the other you suffer for the whole Church of God. Thus said Dionysius. Of this Gregorie Nazianzen was so studious and zealous, that when the Church at Constantinople began to be diuided, as he supposed by occasion that he possessed that sea, he openly said, and his speech was much more commendable then his fact, Si propter me ista tempestas, If this stirre and tempest be for my sake, take me, & cast me into the sea, that the storme may cease, and the Church may enioy her calme, as Ruffinus reports in his 2. booke & 9. chap. To this S. Cyprian at large perswaded in his booke de vnitate ecclesia: Let no man thinke, saith he, that the good will depart from the Church; Triticum non rapit ventus, sed paleas: It is not wheate but chaste which the winde blowes away. Those can neuer abide in God, that will not abide in the vnitie of the Church of God. Though such giue their bodies to be burned, or to be deuoured of wilde beasts, Non est illa corona fides, sed poena persidiae, That is no crowne of their saith, but a punishment for their perfidiousnesse: Occidi talis potest, coronari non potest: A man may happily be killed, but neuer crowned in a schisme. Of this Martianus, though no good bishop, most passionately said, when Sabbatius whom he had formerly ordained Presbyter, began to make a tumult and diuision in the Church, Multa satius

For preseruing this peace Polycarp and other ancient bishops were so carefull, that though they di

            But because I hasten to say somwhat of the other points which remaine, I will not go forward in this so large and spatious a field, but conclude this whole point of peace, partly with those words of our Sauiour, Mark. 9.50. 
               Haue salt in your selues, and haue peace one towards another, partly with the words of the Apostle 2. Cor. 13.11., Finally brethren fare yee well, be of one mind, & liue in peace, and the God of loue and peace shall be with you. And this be spoken of the title that is here giuen to God, that he is called, The very God of peace.
            
            
               Sanctifie you throughout, that your whole spirit, and soule and bodie may be kept blamelesse] The maner of our sanctification (which was the third generall point I proposed) is heere set downe, which is, that it must be totall, and intire, that both our vnderstanding & reason, which is meant by the spirit; and our will and affections, which are meant by the soul

            Which new Pelagianisme it were not hard to refute, but that in this straitnesse of time I much rather desire to touch that which concernes our liues then our learning. And that is one speciall lesson which the Apostle heere teacheth, that in true sanctification we must not thinke it sufficient in some one dutie to performe obedience vnto God, and in some other (as many doe) to take allowance and dispensation vnto our selues, but we must willingly resigne, and submit our selues whollie vnto God, and to his law, striuing with all our knowledge, with all our affections, and in all our actions to performe acceptable seruice vnto God. For of those who at their pleasure take such allowance in any one commandement or branch of Gods law, seeing the reason and formal cause of their obedience is not the voice of God, but their owne will and choice, of such S. Iames truely saith,

And therefore God in his law requires an intire and totall obedience to be giuen to him,

            Consecrate next your bodies vnto God, that as the Apostle heere wishes, your bodies may be kept holy, and without blame. I beseech you by the mercies of God, saith the Apostle, Rom 12.1. that yee giue vp your bodies a liuing sacrifice, holy & acceptable to God; and aga

            Consecrate lastly, your externall and outward actions vnto God, that yee may shew foorth the vertues of him that hath called you, and that your liues being as lamps of pietie vnto others, may shine foorth in good works, which God hath ordained, that we should walke in them. If wee haue onely outward sanctity, wee deceiue others, if we haue onely inward sanctitie wee deceiue our selues: for neuer is faith, charitie, or holinesse rooted in the heart, but it buds foorth, and shewes it selfe in the fruits of good works, and of a godly life. If these things, saith S. Peter 2. Pet. 1.8., that is, godlinesse, temperance, patience, brotherly kindnesse, and loue be in you, they will make you that yee shall neither be idle nor vnfruitfull in the knowledge of Christ. In the 2. Corinth. and 5. chap. v. 14. S. Paul giues a reason why he tooke all that toile and labour in the Gospell, and in gaining others vnto God, and the reason is this, the loue of Christ, saith he, constraineth vs. Doubtlesse where the true loue of God and Christ is in a mans heart, it will euen constraine him to his duty, and to obedience vnto God, and will be like the fire in Ieremies Ier. 20 9. bosome, which could not

be shut vp, but made him wearie of forbearing, that he could not staie. Amor Dei, saith S. Gregorie,

            There were some euen in the Apostles time, as S. Austen shewes, who boasting of their faith, and yet liuing a most dissolute and wicked life did recken themselues as good Christians, and as sure inheritors of Gods kingdome as the best: Which most pernicious and pestilent heresie, being first broched by that arch-heretike Simon Magus, as Irene declares in his first booke, and 20. chap. was afterwards embraced and maintained by the Eunomians, who taught, as S. Austen shewes in his 54. heresie, Ad quod vult. that if a man did beleeue their doctrine, it skilled not how he liued, neither how many sinnes hee committed, nor how long hee perseuered therein. To which heresie when some in S. Austens own time inclined, he purposely writ against them his book De side & operibus; the summe and effect wherof, is the very same which S. Iames in his epistle most effectually vrgeth, What I
                     •
                  m ca. 2.14. &c.
                auaileth it my brethren though a man say he hath faith when he hath no works? Can such a faith saue him? And the Apostle answering that such is but a dead and euen a diabolicall faith, in the end he vseth a most fit comparison to expresse the same, that as the body 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , without breath (for so the word doth there rather signifie then the soule, seeing good works doe not animate or giue life to faith, but as an effect doth follow it, as S. Austen

                     e, non ex operibus fides: lib. de grae. & lib. arb. cap. 7. sequuntur opera iustificatum, non praecedunt iustificandum. lib. de fid. & oper. cap. 14. truely declares) as without breath then, the body both is and thereby is knowen of all to bee but a dead body: so that faith which breatheth not foorth in good works, both is in it selfe, & is thereby also euidently discerned and knowen of all to be a dead faith, which can neither saue, nor as the Apostle Iam. 2.19. teacheth, iustifie a man in the sight of God: for a true and iustifying, or as S. Austen 
                  Ca. 14. & 16. calles it, an Euangelicall faith doth euer worke by charitie, Galath. 5. v. 5.. And of it S. Austen saith,

               Iustificatus per fidem quomodo potest nisi iustè operari? Hee that by faith is iustified, cannot but worke the actions of iustice. And more plainely in the 23. chap. of the booke before alledged; Inseparabilis est bona vita a fide, imo verò ca ipsa est bona vita: A good life is neuer seuered from faith, yea rather faith is a good life it selfe.
            
               It is a memorable story which Ruffinus sets downe in his 2. booke and 6. chap. of one Moses an holy man in the primitiue church, who being to be ordained a Bishop, refused to haue Lucius a wicked persecutor to lay his hands, or giue consecration vnto him: At which Lucius disdaining, and supposing hee had taken some exception to his faith, If you be ignorant, said he, or misinformed of my faith, I will recite and relate my beliefe vnto you. You need not, said Moses, recite your faith vnto me, I know it wel enough, so many seruants of God that you haue condemned to the mines and minerals, so many bishops, presbyters, & deacons, that you haue banished, so many Christians that you haue deliuered, some to the fire, and others to the fury of wilde beasts, these doe report and make knowne your faith vnto me. Nunquid verior potest esse fides quae auribus capitur, quàm quae oculis peruidetur? I wil rather beleeue mine owne eies, and your actions concerning your faith, then your bare words and profession. To which purpose S. Austen saith in his 3. tract vpon the epistle of S. Iohn, Non attendamus ad linguam, sed ad facta: Let vs not looke to a mans words, but to his works; he that in works denies Christ, he is an antichrist: Opera loquuntur, & verba requirimus? His works doe speake what he is, we need not seeke to his words.
            I might heere iustly, and, would the time haue permitted, I would more at large haue refelled that most shamelesse slander which they haue deuised against vs, that wee prohibite and contemne good works, as Bellarmine was not ashamed to publish in his booke called Iudic. de lib. concor. and 7. lie, that wee account men free from doing of them, or obseruing the law of God, as he again without al truth hath affirmed in his 4. booke of Iustif & 1. chap. Yea further that we teach Licere quod lubet, that a man may liue as he list, as Dominicus Soto reporteth in the Preface of his booke De natura & grat. which he offred to the Councel of Trent.
            For answer whereunto, though we doe most truely teach both out of the Apostle Rom. 3.28. that we are not iustified by the works of the law, but by faith; & out of S. Hilarie

I conclude, Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorifie your Father which is in heauen. And this be spoken of the third generall point, namely the maner of our sanctification, that it must be totall and entire.
            
               Vnto the comming of our Lord Iesus Christ.] The 4. general point, and the last which I intend to obserue, is the time or continuance which the Apostle requires in our sanctification, namely, that we should perseuere therein vnto the end of our liues, and to our dying day: for the life of a Christian is compared to a race, wherein none receiue the prize but they onely that continue and run out vnto the end, So 1 Cor. 9 24. runne then that yee may obtaine: It is compared to a combat 2. Tim. 4.7., and the garland of immortalitie, and crowne of righteousnesse for which we all doe striue, hath not engrauen vpon it certanti, but vincenti dabitur, to him Reu. 3 7.17.26. that ouercommeth, and keepeth my words vnto the end, will I giue to eate of the tree of life, and of the hidden Manna. Be thou v. 10. faithfull then vnto the death, and I will giue thee the crowne of life: Non quaeruntur in Christianis initia, sed finis, saith S. Ierome ad Furiam, It is not enough to begin, but to end well is the honour of a Christian life. The Prophet Psal. 84 6. sets it downe as a propertie of the faithfull, They will goe from strength to strength, vntill euery one of them appeare before God in Sion. Let vs not be weary, saith S. Paul Gal. 6.9. of weldoing, for in due season we shall reape if wee faint not. He that continueth, saith S. Iohn 
                  Epist 2 v. 9., in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Sonne. To them Rom. 2.7 that by continuance in wel-doing seeke glory and honour, shall be immortalitie and eternall life. Behold, saith

perseuere is the promise of our Sauiour made, Matth. 24.

            Beloued, if any haue not already entred into the course of such a sincere and godly life, as both long since they solemnly vowed, and doe now outwardly professe, such I cannot exhort with the Apostle to continue or goe forward, but to desist from that course, and without delay euen while it is called to day, as the Apostle saith, Heb 2.7. To turne vnto God: nor euer to vse any of those sluggish and delatorie answers, which S. Austen

            But because not onely Christian charitie, but my priuate affection to this place makes me to iudge the best of you, that you haue not onely begun, but haue well proceeded in the course of a godlie life, my onely exhortation shall bee vnto you, that yee neuer turne backe from God, nor from a Christian and a godly life, but continue and perseuere therein, as our Apostle saith, euen to the comming of our Lord Iesus Christ: for although it be impossible (which I haue heeretofore in sundry Sermons out of this place made cleere) that those who are once truely sanctified by Gods spirit, and seasoned with his grace, should euer afterwards either totally or finally relapse or fall away from God; yet that euen such by their voluntary running into some grieuous transgressions, may so farre decline from God, and from many degrees of his grace, that they may leaue a grieuous wound vnto their conscience, and a blemish to their profession and calling, those knowne examples of holy Dauid, S. Peter, and diuers others doe more then sufficiently witnesse vnto vs, which are purposely registred in the booke of God, not so much to be a staffe of

comfort to vphold those from despaire which by like infirmitie fall into like sinnes, but specially to be a caueat and warning to all other, wisely to preuent, and manfully to resist all the motions of sinne, and euen the first suggestions of Satan, cum videant tantorum vtr

                  rum & cauendat tempestates & slenda nausragia, as S. Austen obserues of those very examples in his 3. booke De doctr. Christ. and 23. chap. that seeing Satan hath already giuen the foile to those who were so full fraught with pietie, and so strong and valiant champions in this spirituall conflict, that they were able to encounter yea to ouerthrow euen Goliah of the Philistims, how vigilant and watchfull ought wee to be, who haue neither so great strength, nor skill, to make resistance against so mightie, so subtill, and so expert an enemie?
            Wherefore let me put you in minde of the Apostles Heb. 2.12. exhortation, Take heed lest at any time there bee found in any of you an euill heart and vnfaithfull to depart away from the liuing God: Remember the Apostles Gal. 3.1. reproofe, O foolish Galathians, are yee so foolish that when yee haue begun in the spirit, yee will end in the flesh? Better it had beene, as S. Peter saith 2. Pet. 2.21., neuer to haue knowen the way of righteousnesse, then after yee haue knowen it to turne from the holy commandements of God. O what a griefe would it be vnto you, if when yee haue formerly beene as faire lampes in Gods Church, giuing much light and warmth vnto many others, those graces of Gods spirit should afterward be so farre smothered, and almost quencht, that they could yeeld neither more heat then some small sparkes, and those couered also vnder the finders of many sinnes, nor giue more light then the snuffe of a candle, which is both dimme and noisome? Or what a griefe would it be for a Christian minde that hee should euer haue iust cause to complaine as Milo

                did, who hauing in his yonger daies beene renowned and famous throughout all Greece for his strength, afterwards comming to the Olympicke games, bemoned the want and decay thereof, and stretching out his armes said, At hi lacerti nunc mortui sunt, ah the strength and sinewes of my armes are now withered and decaied; farre greater sorrow would it bring vnto a Christian heart, if in his old age, which should be best of all, finding an impairing of his spirituall strenth and former graces of Gods spirit, he should then

haue cause to lament and say; Time was indeed when this arme of my faith did strongly lay hold on Christ, time was, when there was pith, strength, and sinewes in my zeale to God, and loue to Gods children; At hi lacerti nunc mortui sunt, but alas, all the pith and sinewes of my former piety are dead, quite decaied and gone.
            Let vs rather striue to be like Moses Deut▪

And let vs learne that one precept of the Orators, who though in euery part of their speech they vse great care and diligence, yet in the end and conclusion thereof, they set foorth all their Art and skill to stirre vp the affections and passions of their hearers, that then they may leaue as the last, so the deepest impression of those things which they would perswade: whose wisedome in this one point let vs all learne to imitate and follow, that our whole life being nothing els, but a continued and perswasiue oration vnto our God, to be admitted into his heauenly kingdome, in euerie part of our liues we may expresse our pietie, zeale, and godlinesse, which are the most oratorious and perswading reasons with almightie God; but when we come to the last act and epilogue of our age, then especially let vs striue to shew foorth all our Art and skill in a Christian and godly life, that so stirring vp as it were all the affections of God, and euen the bowels of his compassion vnto vs, we may then leaue as the last, so the best and deepest impression of our loue in Gods heart. That as the Sunne, though at all times glorious, yet of all other at his setting is most beautifull and comfortable to behold; so we hauing thorowout all our liues, euen from the East of our age continued a constant course of holinesse, shining in pietie, and euery where spreading abroad the beames of a godly life, when wee draw neere vnto our

westerne home, and to that day which shall onely be our setting, and not our dying day, wee may then depart more comfortable and glorious both in the sight of God and of men; that our setting to this world may be vnto vs a rising aboue the heauenly horizon, and our farewell to this world may bring vnto vs a happie, and most gladsome welcome of all the blessed Angels and Saints of God, yea of Christ Iesus our God, our Sauiour, and our husband, with whom we shall then rest and raigne in eternitie, and in eternall felicitie for euermore.
