               It bootes me not to stay,
               When in this land rebellion beares such sway.
               Gods will, a Court! Tis chang'd
               Since Noble Henries daies.
               You haue set your handes vnto a will.
               A will you well may call it:
               So wils Northumberland:
               So wils great Suffolke,
               
               Against Gods will, to wrong those Princely Maides.

               Ile damb'd my soule for no man, no for no man,
               who at doomes day must answere for my sinne:
               Not you, nor you my Lordes,
               Who nam'de Queene Iane in noble Henries daies,
               Which of you all durst once displace his issue?
               My Lords, my Lords, you whet your kniues so sharp,
               To carue your meate,
               That they will cut your fingars.
               The strength is weakenesse that you builde vpon,
               The King is sicke, God mend him, I, God mend him:
               But were his soule from his pale body free,
               Adieu my Lords, the Court no court for me.

               You are too timorous. We in our selues

               Heard you not the proclamation?
            
            
               Gui:
               I heare of it, and I giue credit to it
               What great men feare to be,
               Their feares grow greater.
               Our Fathers grow ambitious
               And would force vs saile in mightie tempests,
               And are not Lordes of what they doe possesse.
               Are not thy thoughts as great?

               I haue no thoughts so ranke, so growne to head,
               As are our Fathers pride.
               Troth I doe inioy a Kingdome hauing thee.

               Gui.
               See how thy blood keepes course with mine:
               Thou must be a Queene, aye me! a Queene,
               The flattering belles that shrilly sound
               At the Kings funerall with hollow heartes,
               Will cowardly call thee Soueraigne:
               For indeed thou wouldst prooue but an Vsurper.
            
            
               Ian,
               Who would weare fetters though they were all of golde?
               Or to be sicke, though his faint browes
               For a wearing Night-cap, wore a Crowne.
               Thou must assume, a tytle that goes on many feet,
               But tis an office, wherein the heartes of Schollers,
               And of Souldiers will depend vppon thy Hearse.
               Were this rightly scand,
               Wee scarce should finde a King in any Land.

               It is often seene, the heated blood
               That couets to be royall, leaues off ere it be noble,
               My learned carefull King, what must we goe?

               Set forward then.
               A dead march, and passe round the stage, and Guilford speakes.

               Their seuerall pleasures: all their pride and honour,
               
                  I haue forsaken for a rich prayer Booke.
               The Golden Mines of wealthy India,
               Is all as drosse compared to thy sweetnesse.
               Thou art the ioy, and comfort of the poore,
