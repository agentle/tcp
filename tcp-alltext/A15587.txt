and order in diete, to haue iyued vntyll he was an hundred yeres olde. I lette paſſe manye other, of whom Plutarche maketh mencion, whyche althoughe they were verye feble and weake, yet they by obſeruynge theſe precepts of liuyng, and vſyng great diligēce to preſerue the ſame, haue lyued long tyme wythout any greuous or paynefull ſyckenes. Whyche thynges conſidered and kept in remembraunce, cauſeth many not a lytle to meruell what ſhoulde bee the cauſe of ſo ſodaine a chaunge & alteracion in our bodies at thys tyme frō their nature which haue ben before vs. For now adaies if a man lyue to fyfty or. lx. yere, it is thought a great age. And the moſt parte of men ere this tyme euen in their floriſhyng youth are attached with fearful death which ſhaketh

of their freſhe colour, their bewty, and their ſtrēgth. And yet the caſe is playne, that mans lyfe myghte continue as longe nowe as it hath done afore tyme, if we in leadyng forth thereof wolde vſe ſuche diligence and circūſpectiō as dyd our progenitors. Whiche thynge I ſpeake not as any derogatiō vnto gods honor, as who ſay, that we can appoint or conſtitute ani time, excepting alway ye power of God which is wonderfull & alſo merciful aboue mans reaſō or counſell, preſeruing, or ſtriking, whō, whē, or wher it ſhal like his diuine power. For oftentymes as holy ſcripture doth record, horrible ſyn hath ben ye cauſe of ſhort life. And as itGen. xvi. is writtē ye firſt boke of Moſes in ye firſt age, one mā liued as long as. v. or. vi. do now, but ſhortly after, lyke as men, ſo dyd ſynne encreaſe on the earthe.

Wherefore the Lorde ſayde: my ſpirite ſhal not alway ſtriue in mā becauſe he is fleſhe, and his dayes ſhall be a. C. &. xx. yeres, but none at all, or very few doth approche nere vnto thys age: And truely to ſpeake as I thynke our imtemperance, continuall bankettyng, and dayely ingurgitacions of meates and drinkes, is greate occaſion of ſhort lyfe nowe adayes. The ſpirite of glotonie ſo triumphyng amonge vs in his glorious chariot called welfare, driuynge all ſmelfeaſtes and bealye guttes as hys priſoners afore him into the dungeon of ſurfet, where they be tormented wyth ſondrie painfull diſeaſes, driuen, drawen, and finally drowned.

For thys is not a rare thyng, but in dayly experience, that by ſuche reuell, gourmandiſe, and daily ſurfetyng, many cruellye are putte to deathe, oftentimes in floryſhynge youth, in the moſt pleaſaunt tyme of their lyfe. Wherfore the ſaying of the wiſe man Salomon is trulye on them verified, mo dye ſayth he by ſurfet and intēperance, then dothe by battell and outward boſtilitie.

               ¶ The heat in our bodies which is called vitall, becauſe as longe as it endureth the body is liuyng and quicke, and all the powers thereof, which be three in number: naturall, vitall, animall, do performe their operacions, is noryſhed and ſed wyth moyſtnes, by the ſuperfluous increaſe or diminucion wherof, ouer or vnder his naturall aſſignment, the lyfe runneth on haſard, the body is diſſoluid, & death immediately foloweth, which many men haue in extreme hate, and moſt fearfully abhorre.
            
            The fyrſt Chapter.
            THat ſame quicke and liuelye power in our bodyes which is called lyfe, ſupported by naturall heat and moyſture, liueth and dwelleth in the body, whiche two ſo together are conglutinate or knyt, that the one can not be ſeperate frō the other, & the humiditie or moyſtnes is a very noryce to this naturall heat, whych by power digeſtiue for her ſuſtentacion receyueth of her noryce ſuche inyce as is cōformable to her appetite.

Theſe two qualities be the materiall cauſes of oure liuinge. For a more playne declaracion whereof, I wyll vſe a familier example daylye repreſented before our eyes. As the lyghte and bryghteneſſe of the lampe cometh of the oyle and the weke, ſemblably this vitall power comenly called lyfe, procedeth of natural heate & moyſture: and when the oyle is conſumed and waſted, the lyght of the lampe is extinguyſhed and quenched: alſo when there is to muche exceſſe or abundaunce therof beynge wateryſhe or corrupte, the lyght is in daūger to be drowned, Lykewiſe it fareth by the encreaſe and diminuciō of humiditie in our bodies. For if moyſture be wantyng or ſuperfluous, if it be more or leſſe then is conuenient to the naturall proporciō and temperature

of the body: it doth ſhortly debilitate, make feble and weake naturall heate, whyche ſo weakned in ſhort continuaunce is clene extinct and ſo the bodye is diſſolued, and lyfe diſtroyed.

            Yf for lacke of moyſtnes naturall heate be deſtroyed, the bodye dyeth by reſolucion or conſumpcion. Yf the naturall heate be drowned by ſuperfluouſe moyſture, or elles by moyſture viciate and vnnaturall,

the bodie dyeth by ſuffocacion, putrefaction, or corrupciō. Thys ſuffocacion commeth vnto the bodie, when anye of the foure humors (which euery man is compoſed and made of) doth exceade their proportion that nature hath limited, or elles when any of them be putrified and rotten, ſpeciallye when there is eyther great abundaunce of flewme in the bodie, or elles when it doth approche to putrefaction or rottennes, wherof is the feuer quotidiane ingendred: wherefore pituita is ſo called (as ſome men thynke) quia petit vitam.
            Thys neceſſary therfore and cō
               ueniente forme or diſcipline of lyuyng, whych to the prolongacion of mannes life, is requiſite and profitable, doth as well inſtructe vs how to be vigilant and circūſpect, leaſt naturall moyſture in our bobodies

be not lyghtlye conſumed and waſted, as alſo to auoyde the daunger of death, whych cometh by putrefaction of humors. And that euerye man may wyſelye and diſcretelye order theſe preceptes, to the prolongacion of hys lyfe, with long continuaunce of health: it is expedient and neceſſarie that euery man knowe the natural habite and diſpoſition of hys owne bodie. For if the body be hotte and drye, and the conduites thereof open, and hys humors ſubtile or thinne: then he muſt vſe thoſe thinges whych do reſyſt conſumption or waſtyng, for becauſe his body lacking natural moyſture is lightlye thereunto diſpoſed. And to ſatiſfie the deſyre of ſuch, whych per aduēture by theſe general wordes hotte and drie, do not yet perceyue what I meane therby, here for the

playne vnderſtandyng thereof, it ſhal be declared by ſenſible tokens Such as haue bodies hote & dry, their pore

Alſo their vaines be ſo litle that by the outward ſēſes they can not wel be perceyued. And a cōtrary diſpoſitiō hath cōtrary totokens, as a ſmoth or ſoft ſkynne, large and ample vaynes, and ſuch as be of thys conſtitucion muſte vſe ſuch thynges whych ſpecially do reſyſt putrefaction and corrupcion of ye humors which ſhalbe declared hereafter.

To the euidente profe whereof it is to be noted that their brayne alwaye declineth to drynes and hornes by reaſon of the continuall mocion of the wyrte whych is alwaye occupyed, and the phantaſye alwayes conceiuyng thinges, and committynge them to memorye, and alſo becauſe the bodies of theſe menneM. fici

            The ſecond chapter.
            IN miniſtringe of oyle to a lampe, euery man is circumſpect: for they perceiue well if they put in to much at one tyme, they drowne the lyghte, or elles if by negligence they forget to putce any oyle in, for lacke of humiditie the lyght is extingwyſhed & goth forth. By exāple wherof we maye learne diſcretelye to temper heate

and moyſture in oure bodyes, by vertue and power of the whych, lyfe tyme may de prolonged.
            Fyrſte therfore bycauſe this life is incloſed in a mortal body, a veſſell frayle, bryckle, and of ſhort cō
               tinuaunce, we may not refuſe and caſte awaye all regard or reſpecte thereof, or neglecte our dueties in attendyng of it, for aſmuche as it cōteineth in it precious treaſures. but with vigilāt cuſtodie intreate and order it, not in much cheryſheyng or pamperyng of it, not ſufferyng it to be ſubdued to all ioyes, pleaſures, delicacie, and voluptuouſenes. For by ſuche belye chere all the powers are weakened, the goodlye bewtye of the viſage, and ſhape of mankynde, alſo ſtrengthe of the bodye decayeth and vaniſheth away in ſhort time. Wherfore we muſt accuſtume oure ſelfe to a

moderacion in dyet whyche maye comforte nature, and not fyll the belye. It is wrytten that Galene the prynce of all Phiſitions, whyche in hys tyme was had in wonderfull reuerence, dyd neuer in all hys Lyfe eate ſo muche, but that he left wyth a greate appetite and deſyre to eate more. Neyther dyd he vſe to eate by and by after he had ryſen, whych we call breakefaſtes, that be geuen to aſſwage the guawyng and complayntes of a yonge ſtomacke (and yet he lyuedCelius auti-lecti lib. xvi, as Celius writeth. xx. yeres, or as ſome other affirme a hundred and fortye,) albeit breakefaſtes to be neceſſarye in thys Realme, a certeyne worſhypfull and well lerned man deſeruing notable remēbraūce, hath proued by good reaſon, for aſmuche as choler beyng feruent in the ſtomacke ſēdeth

vp fumoſities vnto the heade, and cauſeth headache, or ſometyme becometh aduſt, wherby happeneth perilous ſyckenes if the heate incloſed in the ſtomacke haue not cō
               uenient matter to worke on Wherfore they be neceſſarye in thys Realme, ſpecially to yonge men or colericke. But to returne to our purpoſe, it is to be remembred that the lampe burneth long, the lyght wherof is tempered according to the oyle, ſo that it do not haſtelye, but by lytle and lytle burne and waſte vp the ſame.
            Lykewyſe we in all oure lyfe tyme, ſpecially in youth, muſte be aduertiſed that thys heat naturally graffed in vs, be not ſuperfluous or abundaunt, then verye lyke ſhortly to conſume all humiditye called radicall, whych oftentymes is great occaſion of ſhorte lyfe.
            
               Furthermore by our outwarde ſenſes we perceyue the lampe not to burne clerelye if the oyle be not pure and clere but thycke, turbulent and full of dregges. For ſhortly bubbels which ryſe on the dregges drowne and extincte the light. But we in the tyme of our natiuitie haue receiued of nature oyle, I meane moyſture radicall, pure, & ayerye. Wherefore that whych is dayly ingendred in our body in the place of that whych is conſumed by heate, wherwyth thys heate is fedde and noryſhed, ought not onlye to be of iuſt and equal porcion and quantitie to that whyche was before, but alſo in all condicions lyke vnto it, and that it may be ſo conformable vnto it, it muſte not onlye be pure and ayerye, but alſo not hauynge anye parte of fece or dregges.) Whych if you wyll eſcape

and auoyd, you muſt beware of cruditie which is a vicious concoction of thynges receyued, they not beynge wholly or perfectly alterid. Remedies conuenient & fitte therefore ſhall be expreſſed in the chapter folowyng.
            Alſo much reſte, idlenes, or ſlug gyſhenes, wherfore we muſte not neglecte competente exercyſe, and that in due and cōueniente tyme, whych ſurely is a thynge ſo neceſſary to the preſeruacion of health, that wythout it no man may long be wythout ſyckeneſſe, whiche is affirmed bi Cornelius Celſus ſaiyngCorn. Celſus. lib. x. that ſluggyſhnes dulleth the bodye, labour doth ſtrength it: the fyrſt bryngeth the incōmodties of age ſhortly, the laſte maketh a mā longe tyme luſtie, and moſte of all to abſteyne frome ſuche meates which engender dregges, making

as a neceſſari remedy againſt the incōmodities of age, that therby thei ſhuld ſeme to returne vnto youth & forget heuines, for by his qualities whiche be heate & moyſture, nature is chieflye conſerued. Alſo Galene ſaith that wyne is of good noriſhmēt for the bodye, and doth preſerue health, & that ther is no other kyndes of meat or drinke that doth ſo much cōforte natural heate, & ſo helpeth digeſtion. The profite that cōmeth by moderate drinkyng of wyne is that it dothe clarifye the thicke and troubleſom bloud, it doth clenſe & opē the paſſages and pores of the bodye, and ſpecially the vaines it doth take awaye ſtopping of the liuer, it doth expell frō the hert darke fumoſitie which doth ingēder heauines & ſo row, it cauſeth a man to forget all care, & maketh him mery & ioyful.

Wherefore it is holeſome for all ages, for all times, and al regions ſo that it be taken moderately and as he yt drynketh it hath ben accuſtumed to it, if he drynke no more then his nature may wel ſuſtayn & beare. Albeit concernynge ages, touchyng the regimente of wyne, A

               A confutation of the exoniouſe opinion of certayne philoſophers whyche thought phiſycke to be of ſuch efficacie and power to make the body immortal. wyth the cauſes of bodely deathe, and the neceſſitie thereof.
            
            The eleuenth Chapter.
            
               THere were in tyme paſte certeine philoſophers, whyche ſuppoſed that by ſuche craft and other lyke as is before hearted, the bodi of mā might be made immortal. Whych opinion to be folyſhe, peruerſe, and erronions it may ſone appeare to al them whiche wyll eyther folowe daylye experience or natural reaſon, to leaue of that I ſhuld firſte haue named, and that is the moſt true and ſubſtanciall reaſon: verelye the determinate ſentence of almyghtie god. Albeit not only philoſophers, but alſo phiſicions by ouermuche affiaunce and truſt had in their ſcience ſuppoſed that this thyng myghte be brought to paſſe againſt whoſe preſumption & arrogancie the noble phiſicion Auicene, the chiefe of the Arabians, in forme folowyng replieth, ſayenge: The ſcience of

phiſytke doth not make a manim mortall, nor doth not defend ſurely out bodies from outward hurtefull thynges, no nor can not aſſure euery man to lyfe, to the laſt terme and daye of his lyfe. But of two thynges it maketh vs ſure: that is from putrefaction and corruption and alſo defendeth that naturall moyſture be not lyghtly diſſolued or conſumed. Wherfore that cruel Lady of deſtenie named A
                  •
               ropos whom we call comenlye death aſſayleth and purſueth oure bodyes to deſtroye and kyll them by two ſundry maner of wayes. Whereof the fyrſte is called reſolution or conſumption of natural moyſture whyche in continuaunce and preceſſe of tyme muſte of neceſſitie be conſumed and waſted, and can by no phiſycke be auoyded.
            
               And all the preceptes whych here be gathered together if thei be diſcretelye vſed, and put in due execution, ſerue ſpeciallye for thys purpoſe, that it bee not lyghtlye, as in floryſhyng youthe or chylde age conſumed or waſted, but be deferred to olde age as longe as nature wyll permitte and ſuffer.
            The latter cauſe by the whyche death aſſayleth the bodie is called putrefaction or corruption of naturall humiditie, whyche maye be eaſelye auoyded if man be circumſpecte in vſyng the counſels before wrytten, and to keepe the bodye in ſafety and health. From the daunger hereof dothe belonge the diligent conſideration and ryghte vſe of thoſe thynges whych be called in phiſicke not natural, whyche be ſyxe in number. Ayre, meate and drinke, ſleepe and watche, mouing

and reſte, emptines and repletion, and affectes of the mynde. Of the vſe whereof is ſome thyng ſpoken in maſter Eliots Caſtell, and ther fore here omitted.
            But nowe to returne to this neceſſitye of our dying, to the which by force and conſtraynt we are driuen, and commeth by thys reaſon. Naturall heate in oure bodies by continuaunce and proceſſe of time is a neceſſatie cauſe of her owne de ſtruction. For if it ſhulde alwayes continue in our bodies, then ſhuld we liue, but the thyng is contrary, for at the lengthe it dothe conſume and waſt her owne matter wherof ſhe is made, that is naturall moyſture. For a more euidente and playne declaration whereof, it is to be conſidered that lyke as the lyght of the lampe dothe by continuaunce of tyme conſume the oyle

which is cauſe of the lyght, and ſo is at length extingwyſhed: Lykewyſe it fareth by naturall heate in our bodies, and the more it aprocheth to age, the more it becometh drier, wherby heat is diminyſhed, which diminution of naturall heat is cauſed of two thynges, the one is ouermuch drynes in al the mē
               bers, the other is lacke of moyſture, whych of neceſſitie, immediately after cauſeth death to come, and the body to be diſſolued. This I thynke ſufficient to the confutacion of the opinion before remembred. One thynge I had almoſte forgotten, whych althoughe it be but a faynyng of the poetes, yet it is neceſſarye to the amplifiyng of our purpoſe, and doth conteine in it thynges delectable, worthye knowledge.
