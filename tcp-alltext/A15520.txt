                  TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE, THE Lord WOTTON, Baron of Marleigh, one of his Maiesties Priuy Counsell, Comptroller of his house, and Lieutenant of Kent, his very good Lord: T. W. wisheth all happinesse in Christ, now, and heereafter for euer.
                  
                  
                     AMong all Sacred and Diuine Bookes, which teach that great Mystery of godlinesse (Right Honourable) there are none more Mysticall, then the Canticles of Salamon: The Epistle to the Hebrewes: and the Apocalipse or Reuelation of S. Iohn. In the first of these three, we are by a continuall Allegorie of Mariage, instructed in the most sweet and straight coniunction betweene Christ and his Church. In the second, vnder comparison, with Tipes and Figures of the Law, we do learne the perfection of Christs Priest-hood and Sacrifice, for full reconciliation

of all elect sinners with God. In the third (which hath as many Mysteries, as words) by dark Propheticall Phrases, wee haue fully deciphered the condition of the Christian Church, till the returne of Christ her Husband; together, with the certaine ruine, both of Turkish and Popish Regiments, as most infest enemies to the spouse and truth of God. The explication of these portions of Sacred writ, by an easie and familiar way of a Dictionary, I haue thought it my dutie (humbly crauing your Lordship so to interpret it) to dedicate vnto you (my Right Hon: good Lord, to whō for manie respects, especially for your gracious fauour to my meane selfe, and your great affection to the Diuine truth, I holde my selfe much indebted) as I haue put foorth a generall Register of Sacred wordes, with their significations, scattered throughout the whole Bible, vnder the Names of three Right Reuerend persons, mine especiall Benefactours. If by my Diuine Candle, there shall arise any light, for the better vnderstanding of heauenly and Holie-Scriptures; let all glorie be giuen to him, who is the Father of Lights, from whose Light, we all receiue Light; and vnto whose blessed guiding & protection, I commit your Honor, with your right Honorable and vertuous Lady, & hopeful Children. From mine house in Cant. Decem. 1611.
                  
                     Your Honors bounden Seruant, and dutifull Chaplen,

                  TO THE RIGHT Reuerend Fathers in Christ, my Lord Bishop of Carlile, and of Worcester. Also, to the Right Worshipfull, Mr. Doctor NEVILE, Deane of CHRIST-CHVRCH, in Canterbury; THOMAS WILSON, wisheth all health and Happinesse, from Christ our Lord.
                  
                     RIght Reuerend, that which King Asuerus saide of Mordechaie, when he found by reading in the Chronicles the great pleasure he had done him, by discouery of a dangerous treason against him, What Honor and dignity (saith he) hath bin done to him for this? The like (though not the same) may I say, concerning your Lordships and Worship, vpon recording with my selfe, the many and great fauours which you haue done me from my youth, to this day: what duty and seruice (for I may not say, what Dignity and Honour) hath bin returned to you for all this? My Conscience doth aunswere me with some checke, as his Seruants answered their King: There hath beene nothing done. If vpon this aunswere, that Heathen man entered into some deliberation with himselfe, how to recompence Mordoche, my checke would proue a sting in the end, if I should alwayes suffer my selfe to forget your very great and most constant Good-will and benificence. For one of you; to wit, my Lord of Carlile, was vnder God, the foundation of all the learning and preferment which I enioy, hauing cherrished me in his Colledge (whereof he was a most

worthy Prouest and Gouernor, neglecting himselfe and his, for the good of his house;) and afterward, sending mee to the place where yet I abide, by Gods goodnesse; and there haue beene, and still am much comforted through the great loue & care of that Reuerend and most courteous Deane of that Church, whereof I am a Member. The third, vouchsafing me his louing respect, both long before and since hee was aduanced to his first Sea. Entering into some deliberation, what I might do, not for dignifying you (albeit that were my part to do, were it in my power) but for deliuering my selfe from suspition and imputation of an ingratefull minde, I resolued to presume vpon your great and well approued benignity and patience to dedicate to you, and vnder your three names (being for your place and painfulnesse, cheefe setters foorth, and teachers of Christianity) to publish a great part of this my Christian Dictionarie, which with much and long labour, and not without some fruite (I hope) to the Godly Professors (for whose sake and good, cheefely, I meant it) I am sure, vvith much gaine of knowledge, and encrease of iudgement to my selfe, I haue at length (as I could) finished it. Vnto which, if your Honourable Lordships will affoord Patronage, Countenance, and gracious Aspect, I shall in such wise, acquite some part of bounden dutie towards you, as yet I will acknowledge my debt encreased▪ by the addition of dignity vnto me▪ so to grace this poore but painfull Work▪ as it may haue shelter vnder your wings, against the carping Tongues of the enuious, who neither will put forth their strength to do good, nor yet will beare with others, which desire to employ their Talents. Thus crauing pardon of my boldnesse, and submitting my selfe and endeuours to your fauourable acceptance, I commend you all three, to him who is one in Essence, and three in persons; the Blessed Trinitie, in vndeuideable Vnitie. Whose wisedome and power, euer guide and defend you in earth▪ till his infinite goodnesse and mercy, haue glorified you in heauen.

                  The Generall Preface, To the Christian Reader.
                  
                  
                     THe end of Teaching, is to cause others to learn; & to learne, is to know things to be, what they are. Now of things to be knowne, words are notes or markes, leading the minde to the comprehension of the thinges. It cannot bee then, but a great hinderance to the vnderstanding of things; when words, which betoken and signify things, are not vnderstanded; and a great furtheraunce, when they be vnderstood. Wherefore, as it is necessary in Grammar Schooles, that Children which learne French, Latine, or Greeke, haue their Dictionaries and Lexicons allowed them, to enterpret such harde and strange wordes, by knowledge whereof, things to bee learned, become more easie; and their labours, which haue composed such Bookes, are much to be commended. So I haue wondered, that of so many, woorthy,

learned, and Godly Diuines, which are as willing for their loue to the good of the Church, as able for their sufficiency of gifts; not one, no not one (that I knowe) haue euer attempted to prouide our Christian Scholler such a Christian Dictionary of wordes, as containe the secrets of our Heauenly profession and Art. Many haue framed and set forth Primers, and A. B. Cs. for beginners; I meane Catechismes, to enter them into the knowledge of God: but not any (as yet) haue set too their hands, to enterpret in our Mother tongue (in Alphabet order) the cheefe words of our Science, which being very hard and darkesome, sound in the eares of our weake Schollers, as Latine or Greeke words, as indeede, many of them are deriued from these Languages; and this I haue esteemed, as no smal let to hinder the profiting in knowledge of holy Scriptures amongst the vulgar; because, when in their reading or hearing Scriptures, they meet with such principall words, as carry with them the Marrowe and pith of our holy Religion; they sticke at them, as at an vnknowne language. Mathias Flaccius Illyricus (whom I did not looke vpon, nor vppon Enchiridion Marlorati, vntill I had well nie done this worke) hath worthily performed this in Latine, by whose helpe, it is easie for a Diuine to do some such worke in English: I, the vnmeetest and vnwoorthiest of all my Bretheren, not one of a thousand, but the meanest of ten thousand; haue attempted this enterprise, and performed a poore some-thing, sufficient onely, to giue the more learned an occasion to do some more exact thing in this kinde. Therefore, for their better encouragement thus to doo, (besides the breach of the Ice vnto them) I haue breefely set downe before them, the great and manifold profits that would arise out of such a worke, being substantially done. First of all, thy selfe, being a Minister of the word, it wil bring thee this fruite, that thou shalt teach with more facility, hauing readie and at hand, the true and right definition of things. Secondly, the distinguishing of wordes of

diuers acceptions, lying alwayes by thee, will ease thee of some labour in searching, when thou art enforced by occasion of the Text, to enterpret such words. Thirdly, the people committed to thy charge, being by meanes of such a Booke, well acquainted with the cheefe Wordes, which containe any Doctrine, thou shalt not neede in the course of thy teaching, to bee alwayes troubled with the opening of such wordes; but presuming vppon their knowledge, maiest the more insist and dwell in the pressing and vrging the Doctrine and practise of the thinges so well vnderstood before. Now, as touching the hearers, their growth and proceeding in Christianitie, will be greater and more speedy, by the help of such a Dictionary; which hauing giuen light vnto them, to know the principall wordes of their Art, the matter of Doctrine contained in these words, and raised out of them, wil be sooner perceiued, and take better impression. Againe, the right distinguishing of thinges, the one from the other, when the Nature and due bounds of euery worde is declared, would proue some preseruatiue against errors and Heresie, which commonly arise vpon the ignorance of things, while they are shuffled confusedly togither, one thing being taken for another; or some thing being taken to bee that, it is not. I could shew this in sundry particulers, one instead of all: Iustification; this word, not rightly vnderstood, what errors hath it bred? whilst some take it, to bee the making of our selues iust, infusion of grace in the hearts of the elect. Others, to be nothing else, but a making of our actions to become iust and holy; whereas, it is an absolution of a Sinner from his guiltinesse, and pronouncing him righteous by God, when he beleeues in his sonne Christ Iesus. Lastly, it will prouoke Christians more willingly to reade Scriptures, when they haue at hand a Dictionary, to declare and expound such words as they vnderstand not. For, as men aduenture to cracke that Nut, whose Kernell by cracking is to be obtained; so the Christian is much moued

to read, when hee hath, as it were, a cracker to get him the Kernell; that is, a Dictionarie to giue him the sence of the words, which he reads. To conclude, it may preuent scruples, which may arise in some Conscience, through ignorance of words, and their true and fit meanings.
                  Now, a few Aduertisements will be requisite to bee added about this my simple endeuour. First, my care was to put in no words, but such as were material, & of some moment and vse. Secondly, if either I haue left out some materiall wordes, or not giuen all the significations of those whereof I haue made choise, or giuen more then they haue, or not set downe the significations for order, so precisely as would be; let these faults (if any such be) be pardoned by thee, till they be supplied by some more sufficient: for whom (as I haue saide) I doo heerein but breake the Ice. Yet heereof, I woulde haue them take knowledge, that such significations as I giue, I find them in the word: but if any worde haue other, or more, it is more then I finde. Thirdly, I would haue none to think, that my meaning were to giue an exact definition of euerie thing (let him be thought verie wise and happie, that can do this) but some true and familiar explication or description of words, to make things that be obscure to become somwhat plainer to the ignorant. Fourthly, these explications which I do giue, may differ in tearmes from such explications, as yee shall finde in other mens Writings of the same wordes. But I verily trust, that you shall finde for the most part, an agreement in substaunce of truth. Moreouer, in citing Scriptures, I haue sometime noted such places, wherein the words which I doo interpret, is onely named; Sometime, the place where the Interpretation is found, with the word; and some places which only haue the Interpretation, & not the word. I cite few places, because the light giuen to a worde in one place, will clear other places where that word is vsed in that same sence, which the aduised Reader shall discerne

by the circumstance of the place. Besides, I haue put some Ecclesiasticall wordes, which be not found in Scripture, in so many Sillables, yet are there for the matter, as Trinity and Sacrament, &c. Againe, sometime ye shall finde the word, and sometime the thing, and sometime both opened. Finally, my request is, that no Minister do by this Booke hinder his owne searching, it being intended to be a meane rather to whe
                        •
                      his diligence to search more narrowly: nor any hearer vse it to contention, but to edification; not for matter of ydle dispute, but for needfull direction. And if I be longer in the explanation of some words, then the Nature of a Dictionary wil beare, or do open some wordes, which (to some) may seeme needlesse; impute it eyther vnto the waightinesse of the things, which being darke and important, neede opening; or vnto the dulnesse of common Capacities, which see little in diuine matters; or if ye will, to want of dexterity in my selfe, who haue beene but of late acquainted with this Trade. Thus entreating thee (courteous Reader) to haue consideration of my weakenesse, and of the newnesse and strangenesse of the worke, fauourably to pardon wants (which in such a forrest of words and things, cannot but be many) I commend thee vnto the mercifull goodnesse and protection of the Almighty.
                  
                     Thine to do thee good,

                     A short Aduertisement, touching the commodities of this Booke, and the things performed in it.
                  
                  
                     CVrteous Reader, albeit in my generall Preface and particuler Rules, I haue some-what discouered both my purpose, and the profit of this new vnwonted worke; yet for thy better encouragement to bestow the cost in buying, and paines in Reading, I haue heere distinctly and seuerally gathered the maine and manifold vses, whereunto this Booke may serue, if it bee rightly vsed and not abused, as euery Booke (euen the best) may be, and are.
                  1 The most wordes of Holy Scripture, both maine and meane, both proper and borrowed; are heere plainely, and with few words expounded and opened, to help the Minister to interpret, and the hearers to vnderstand the Scriptures.
                  2 The sundry and diuers acceptions and scattered sences of one and the same word, are noted and gathered vnder one view, with fit places of Scripture, agreeing to the diuersities of the sence.
                  3 Where any word is by the Holy-Ghost drawne from his proper sence, to an improper and figuratiue signification,

there ye haue the name of that Trope or Figure, set down vnder that Word, whether it be Metaphor or Metonimie, Irony, Sinecdoche, or some other; by which meanes, the reason of pulling many words from the Primitiue signification, to a secondary, may appeare.
                  4 Besides single words, this Booke interpreteth very many double words, compounded of a Nowne & an Adiectiue, or Epithite. Also sundry Scripture-Phrases be expounded.
                  5 In setting down the meaning of the words, this Dictionary doth very often point at some wholesome Doctrine, and sometime expresseth it.
                  6 All the wordes of foundation (as I verily trust) which contain the sure grounds of our Faith and Religion, are heere comprehended.
                  7 Heere bee giuen the definitions of the Capitall and chiefe matters, with due proofes of Scripture, to confirme euery part of the definition, the better to expresse the nature of things.
                  8 You shall find not a few Theologicall distinctions and diuisions, the better to distinguish one thing from another.
                  9 Not onely wordes, which beare difference betweene Protestants and Papists, are written downe and cleared in this Booke, but also there is a taste giuen, of the oddes and difference it selfe, in most points of Controuersie, between vs and them, for the information of such as haue lesse profited, in discerning the differences.
                  10 There bee two thousand Texts of Scripture (at the least) declared and made plaine, to the vnderstanding of the simplest.
                  11 Vnto such words as be hard or waighty, I haue sometimes added, for fuller edifycation, short and easie obseruations, vnder this word [Note] being set in the Margent.
                  
                     12 Lastly, this is not the least fruite that may come of this Dictionary, to the studious and well minded Christian, that it may cause him more narrowly to search and examine what signifycation euery word of Scripture may beare: for out of mine owne experience, I may truly speake it, that since I took this Booke in hand, it hath caused me a great deale more thoroughly to marke the Scriptures, the sweete proportion and large compasse whereof, I know much better then euer I did.
                  
                     Differences betweene this Booke, and M. WILLIAM KNIGHTS.
                     
                     1 HIs Booke is a Concordance, mine is a Dictionary.
                     2 His is Axiamaticall, of simple propositions; mine is partly Verbaticall and Rematicall, as I may so speake, of Wordes with their signifycations: partly, Pragmaticall of things, with their Defynitions, Diuisions, and Obseruations Theologicall.
                     3 His serues for Doctrines, Reasons, & Vses; mine serues most for interpretations.
                     4 His helps Ministers to direct them to teach well; mine may helpe all, but cheefely hearers, to direct them to learne well. To be short, they do agree in nothing but the Generall truth, and in following the order of the Alphabet.

                     MY leasure would not suffer me to read so much of your Dictionary, as I wish I had: but that I haue perused, giueth me that good liking of it, that I assure you, I do take it to bee a very profitable worke, both in regard of the easie Method and order of finding out such matters as are therein contained; as also, for the sound exposition of such Wordes and phrases as you set downe: besides, the manifolde variety of thinges, which a man shall see in a Synopsis laide before his eyes. Of all which, the faithfull Reader (especially the Preacher of the word) shall make singular vse. I must therefore giue my best approbation to this worke of yours, as to other your godly labours in this kinde: and when it shall be finished, I shall bee glad to vse the benefit of it, and will aduise such as I am acquainted with, to do the like. Fare ye well.

                  WHosoeuer dooth but cast his eye ouer any part of this Worke, must confesse it to bee both painefull and ingenious: And (which addeth much to the commendation of it) this addeth not to any that went before. It is farre more easie to adde, then to inuent: and for ought that I know, the Author doth not build vpon any other Mans foundation in this kinde. But that which Crowneth this, and all such Christian endeuours, is, the subiect whereabout it doth conuerse. For though it bee a Dictionary interpreting Words and Phrases; yet is it a Diuine Dictionary, teaching the Language of the Holy-Ghost in our owne Natiue toong, which if a man could once attaine to speake Naturally and kindly, he would be more powerfully eloquent, then if he spake with the tongues of men and Angels.

                     IT is the Custome of worldly men, so sure to lay vp their earthly Treasure, as there is no comming to it without a Key, because it is kept vnder locke, or lockes rather. Thus it fareth with the Heauenly neuer-withering Treasure, which being (as it were) lockt vp from all men (as they be the Sonnes of Adam) cannot be enioyed of them, without the helpe of a double Key. One, is meerely Spirituall and Principally held and kept in his hand, which hath the Keyes of the house of Dauid, to open the wits and vnderstanding of such as bee blinde by Nature. Luke 24, 45. and still more and more to illuminate such as bee alreadie taught of God. Psal. 119, 18. The other, is so Spirituall, as it is also Ministeriall; to wit, the Interpretation of Scriptures, eyther by vocall preaching, or by sounde Writing of such Scribes as be skilfull to open the worde of the kingdome. The former Key, thy humble faithfull Prayers must prouide, beseeching God thy Father most instantly, in the name of his sonne, to open thine eyes to make thee able to see the wonders of his Law. The latter (as from many other Diuine Lock-smiths) so from this Authour is ministred to thee in this present Booke; full of labour, and very lightsome. What remayneth, but that as a naturall man would be glad of a Key, to open the Lock where much Gold and Siluer is stored vp: so thou shouldst ioyfully embrace this worke, which leadeth thee to a Treasure more to be desired then Gold; yea, then much fine Gold. Farewell.

                  IT is a speciall duty of a good Teacher, to know and deliuer the sound and fit sence of the places and Texts of Scriptures; and of euery good hearer to looke after the same, how to vnderstand rightly what he heareth and readeth. In this behalfe, how much the Church of God is beholding to that learned iudicious Writer, M. Caluin, all that are learned, do wel know, and willingly confesse: For when hee meetes with a place, wherein he seeth men haue made scruple, he doth in the end (after some sifting of the matter) strike the Nayle full on the head, with his resolute Census est, This is the sence or meaning of the place. And surely, we ought thankfully to receiue what heere this Author (though in many other respects, and in this also, farre inferiour to Caluin, out of whom he will acknowledge to haue suckt his best knowledge) painfully and freely offereth vnto vs, who heerein imitateth M: Caluin; For, as the one beates out the meaning of a sentence, so this present Writer, labours to presse and draw out the Kernel, which lyes hidde and wrapt in some obscure and doubtfull words. Finally, in humblenesse of heart, apply thy selfe to profit by this & other such profitable Books, as are framed to the edification of the godly Christians, in their most holy faith. Farewell.

                  To the Christian Reader
                  ALthough words be the significations of things, yet as Aug. de doct. Christ. lib. 4. and cap. 11. saith verie well: It is a note of the best & wisest men, In verbis, verum amare, non verba, quid enim prodest clauis aurea si aperire quod volumus non potest? Aut quid obestlignea, si hoc potest, &c. In words, to loue the truth more then the wordes; For what anayleth a Key of Gold, if it cannot open the Treasure that we would faine enioy? Or what hindereth a Key of Wood, if it can open it, &c. Lewes Viues hath fitly obserued out of Augustin de ciu: dei lib. 13. cap. 24. Quanti sit momenti ad omnes artes disciplinas

                         intelligendas vera & Germana vocabularum cognitio. The true and proper signification and knowledge of words, is a matter of great moment and consequence to the vnderstanding of all Artes. It is verie fit therefore (good Reader) thou shouldst imitate the wise Traueller, he will be carefull to attaine to as much skill as may bee in the Languages of all those parts and Countries through which he is to passe, that he may with the fewer inconueniences, be interrupted in the way, and with greater expedition may runne his intended race and iourney: So thou, in thine intended iourney to Canaan, if thou be ignorant of the Language, Customes, Wordes, Phrases, Meanings, and Orders of the place and Countrey, wilt meete with a World of inconueniences, to interrupt thine intention, and discourage thee in thy course, so as thou wilt either leaue off, or verie faintly and vncomfortably go forward. For as the same Augustine saith again verie truly, Nam aut ignotum verbū, facit haerere lectorē, antignota locutio; Either an vnknown word causeth the Reader to sticke, or an vnknowne Phrase and manner of speaking. Vse therefore this Booke, which God hath affoorded for thy good, and for thy guide, reade it diligently, and be much conuersant therein, it will be a faithfull guide and Interpreter vnto thee; It will bring thee acquainted with the Language, Phrase, and Customes of Canaan; It will open vnto thee the hidden Treasures of heauenly Wisedome, and it will tell thee in plaine English and easie tearmes, the minde and meaning of thy good God towards thee. Entertaine it kindly, and take it vp vnto thee, as that Noble Eunuch did his guide Phillip. Acts 8, 31, 39. and it will make thee (as he did) go thy iourney with ioy and chearefulnesse. As the Sea-men and Marriners in their Uoyages, bee carefull to bring 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      so be thou in thine, as carefull to bring 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , an vpright and sincere minde; and I doubt not, but thou shalt find it 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , euen according to thy hearts desire, and answereable to thine expectation. Farewell.

                     CVrteous Reader, thou art much bound to blesse God, for the great plenty and aboundance of excellent Bookes, which by the handes of his painefull and godly Seruants he hath afforded thee, as helps and furtherances to bring thee to the sound knowledge, and right vnderstanding of his sacred word: But among them all, in my iudgement, there is no one in our Natiue tongue, that dooth more oblige thee to true thankfulnesse, then the Booke thou now beholdest, in regard of the great necessity and manifolde vse of the same; as also the exceeding rich profit and benefite, which (by Gods blessing, if thou make the right vse of it) thou mayst reap thereby. For beside the multiplicity and great variety of wholesome matter, which thou shalt finde scattered through the whole worke, heere thou hast most of the dark words and phrases contained in the Scripture, in Alphabeticall order; plainely, breefely, (yet fully) and soundly vnfolded; and in most places, the corrupt glosses of the Papists vpon them, compendiously discouered and confuted. Heere thou maist at one view, see the diuers acceptations and significations of words, with the figures and Tropes denoted, in which the Scripture vseth them. By this Book, thou shalt be made able to distinguish of words, which in Scripture are ambiguous, to explaine wordes and phrases obscure, and easily to vnderstand such as bee hard and vnknowne. By this Booke, if thou be a Minister, thou shalt become Bonus Textuarius (for what is that but to bee able to giue the true meaning and gemine sense of the Scripture?) and bonus Textuarius est bonus Theologus. This Booke will make thee a more profitable teacher; for qui bene distinguit, bene decet. By this Booke (whosoeuer thou be) thou shalt be fortified to shield thy selfe (and haply others too) from errour, as also to see when others do erre, and to draw them out of errour; for errour springes from ignorance; that is, from misvnderstanding the Scripture. Math. 22, 29. By this thou shalt bee made skilfull, to discerne

the voyce of thy Shepheard Christ Iesus, from the voyce of a stranger. Iohn 10, 3, 5. In a word, by this book in short space, and with no great labour, thou mayst plentifully abound in all heauenly wisedome and knowledge. So that, as one saith of Cicero; Sciat se multum profecisse, cui Cicero vnice placet; In like manner, it may more truelie be affirmed of this Booke; whosoeuer he bee that delighteth much in it, shall thereby gaine infinite benefit. The Authour hath beene pleased to entitle this Booke A Christian Dictionary, and so it is; for it interprets wordes. But it may also be worthily called; The Key of the Treasures hid in holy Scripture; the enemy of Ignorance; The high and ready path to Knowledge; The Discloser of Gods holy secrets; A light for Ministers, whereat they may borrow light; A Lanthorne for the people, to direct them in the Light: And to bee short, the way to make all the Lords people to prophesie, as Moses wished. Then Gentle Reader, be not without it, let it be continnally by thee, yet buy it not for Nouelty, because it is the first of this kinde that euer saw the light; but for the vnualuable worth of it. Sit tibi charus, non quia rarus, sed amatus quod amabilis; 1. amari dignus. Seneca saith; Noua, quamuis non magna, miramur. That we make much of new things, though they bee not great. Loe, in this Booke, they both meete together, heere is newnesse, and heere is goodnesse. This worke is new, and it is precious, how then, should it not much Inamour thee?

                  A Preface before the Table.
                  
                     GEntle Reader, in this vast Ocean, and large Forrest of words contained in this Dictionary, I doe find that there be three sorts most materiall; where of I desire that thou sholdst take more especiall notice and knowledge, as being of more worth and waight. The first I call an Ecclesiasticall word, which being translated from common vse of speech, is by the Church appropriated, to signifie holy and diuine things. A word of this kind, though it be not in the Scripture for Letter and Sillables: yet is to be found there for matter and substance; as Trinity, &c. Sacrament, Indifferent, Satisfaction, Merit, &c.
                  A word of the second rancke, I doe tearme Polemicall; because it pertaines to Controuersie, & hath in it a ground of difference betweene the true Christian, which thinketh, speaketh, and writeth Orthodoxally, and soundly; and others, which loue and embrace errors, in fauour where of they wrest, and peruert the pure wordes of Scripture: as Iustification, Assurance, of Faith, Hope of Glory, Concupiscence, Antichrist, &c.
                  A word of the third sort, is called Fundamentall, of which kind, I doe take such wordes to be, as doe containe in them things, which beeing denyed, Religion it selfe is ouerthrowne; euen as an house is ouer-turned, by taking away the foundation or ground-worke whereuppon it stands; as Grace, Fayth, God, Christ, &c. for the descerning of these words from other, I iudge this to be a necessary rule.
                  A word, containing in it anything, which being denyed,A Rule whereby to iudge a fundamentall word. either God himselfe, any person of the God-head, the decrees of God, his properties, his workes of Creation and prouidence, his word of Law and Gospell: or Christ Iesus the Mediator, his Person, Natures, Offices, benefits,

Church, and people be denied; either directly, or by necessary and immediate consequence. Any such word is Fundamentall, for that must needs be the foundation of an House, which being remooued, the house cannot but fall. Of this Nature be the wordes, vpon deniall whereof, followes the ruine of the whole Fabricke of Religion.
                  Of these three kindes of words, I haue heere drawne a Table after the order of the Alphabet, setting a Starre * before an Ecclesiasticall word, to know it by. I haue prefixed this sillable [Con] aboue a Polemical word, and haue placed an [F] ouer the head of a fundamentall word: where it happeneth, that any one word is both an Ecclesiasticall, & a word of Controuersie, I haue written vpon the top of it, both a Star, and this sillable [Con.] Also, you shall find this sillable [Con] and an [F] ouer euery word, which is both Polemicall, and a word of Foundation.
                  
                  Moreouer, whereas I haue with the explication of words, sometimes ioyned the definition of the thing expressed by such a word, ye shall finde this sillable [Def.] put vnder the foote of such a word. And those words in this Table that doe admit distinctions, they are noted out by this sillable [Dist.] directly put vnder the word.
                  Finally, if in the draught, either of this Table, or of this whole Dictionary, I haue failed in any thing (as no doubt but I haue, being but a man; and therefore subiect to error, from which no Booke is priuiledged, sauing the book of Bookes,) I do earnestly entreate thee to couer my slips by loue, eyther amending them, or admonishing mee of them: doing vnto me, as in the like case thy selfe wouldest bee done vnto: euer remembring, that it is much easier to dislike, then to doe the like. The former, will cost thee nothing; but the latter (trust me) will cost thee paines, vnto sweate and wearinesse, if thou wilt but endeuour to doe what I haue done before thee.
                  Farewell.

                        To haue a thing in vtter detestation and loathing, Esay. 1, 13. I abhor your Sabbothes and newe Moones. Iob. 42, 6. I abhor my selfe. Sometimes abhorring, signifies loathing in shew and profession only, and not in truth: as Rom. 2, 22. Thou abhorrest Idols: that is; seemest to detest them.
                     
                     
                        
                           Abhomination. sig:
                        Some accursed spirituall filthinesse which deserues to be fled from and abhorred of all men, as ominous, fearful, & vnhappy. Deut. 22, 5. The man that weareth Womans apparell, and the Woman that puts on mans raiment, both are abhomination vnto the Lord. Prou. 12, 22. The lying lips are abhomination vnto the Lord. Matth. 24, 15. And often in Moses and the Prophets. See Deut. 25, 26.
                        2 Something, which for the vncleannesse sake might not be eaten, or touched. Levit. 11. 10, 11.
                     
                     
                        
                           Abhomination of Desolation. sig:
                        That, which all good men detest and hold accursed, by reason of the shamefull and foule filthinesse of it, deseruing and bringing desolation. And this is meant (as some thinke) of the Idolles which

the Romans not long after Christ his Ascention, set vp in the Temple at Ierusalem, whereupon followed desolation, that is; the laying wast and downfall of the Temple, Citty, and Nation of the Iewes: this is the abhomination of desolation fore-spoken of by Daniell 9, 27. and after spoken of by Mat. 24, 15. But Maister Iunius (not without great apparance of reason) interpreteth [Abhomination] of the Army of the Romans, which consisted of abhominable men, to wit, Infidels, who brought desolation vpon Temple, Citty, and people.

                        His with-holding some signe of his fauor, or the sending some Iudgement. For as touching his essence and power, he is neuer absent from his Creatures, Psal. 77, 7. Will the Lord absent him-selfe for euer? Hence come those phrases in the Psalmes & elsewhere, of hiding his face, turning his back, departing, returning, and such like.

God is no accepter of persons, for in euery Nation, he that feareth God is accepted. Rom. 2, 11. There is then no cause why any should deny the eternall election of God, depending vppon his owne good pleasure alone, as the moouing cause, least he bee counted an accepter of persons.

                        Haters of Christ, and open Blasphemers, Math. 12, 30. He that is not with me, is against mee. They were not against Christ, which did think reuerendly of him, though they did not follow him, & make open profession of him; but such, as reproched him, his Doctrine, and works, are heere said to be against him. As appeareth by comparing together the 30, 31, and 32▪ verses of the 12. Chapter of Saint Mathew.

And he was in an agony, &c. If any thinke, this Agony did arise meerely from a feare of Naturall death in Christ, they thinke too vnwoorthily of Christ his excellent fortitude, of his Fathers infinite Iustice, of mans most horrible and execrable sinnes.

Touching the latter kinde of Allegories, it is a safe thing to tread in the steps of the holy ghost, not making Allegoricall sences, where the Spirit hath made none.

Cor. 6, 18. Saith the Lorde God Almighty. Rom. 9, 19. Who hath resisted his will? The Papists reason foolishly from Gods Almightinesse, to proue the reall presence of Christes body in the supper: whereas they should rather prooue it is his reuealed will to haue it so, which they can neuer do. Wee may assure our selues that God is able to do, and doth whatsoeuer he is willing to doo, but

not on the contrary, that he will do whatsoeuer hee can do. Note further, that if God could do things against his Nature, or thinges contradictory, or against his word, it would bewray impotencie, and weakenesse, not Omnipotency and Almightinesse.

The meaning of this place is, that such as remayne (after due instructions) in the obseruations of Legall-Sacrifices, shal not partake in the Sacrifice of Christs death, once offered on the crosse. What is this to Popish Altars, whereon to Sacrifice Christ againe in an vnbloody maner for sinnes of the quicke in earth, and of the dead in Purgatory?

It is a speech borrowed from those times, when the Temple, and Altars, and Sacrifices were in vse. Therefore the Papists deale absurdly, which vpon these words, would build theyr Altars for Masses, and their Purgatory: woful Interpreters of Scriptures.

Thes. 2. and in the Reuelation, do not agree vnto any other, saue to the Byshoppe of Rome and his Cleargy, who are the Ring-leaders of that generall Apostacy and defection from the faith which should raign, and now long hath raigned in the kingdome of Antichrist. How therefore be Papists deceiued, which will haue Antichrist to be one man; a Iew, of the Tribe of Dan & that he shall come but three yeare and an halfe before the end of the world, & shall kill Henok and Elias, who should return again to liue here in the world, with innumerable other fabulous & false things, wherewith their eies being blinded, they cannot perceiue themselues to be Antichrist, though they do all the

parts, and offices of Antichrist.

This is it which is else-where meant by plucking vp, destroying, hardening, binding, retaining sinnes, making the eares heauy, and the hart fat, &c. Mat. 3, 10. Now is the Axe laide to the roote of the Trees, &c. Some expound this, not of spirituall iudgements threatned in his worde against vnrepentant sinners; but of the power of the Romans, which were the instruments of God, to destroy vtterly the vnfaithful and wicked generation of the Iewes, with a worldly destruction. The former is the better exposition, because of that which followes, of casting into the fire.

He beleeued & did cleaue vnto Phillip. Acts 28, 27. Mat. 13, 20. They receiued the word with Ioy. Thus Hypocrites beleeue.
                        3 To put confidence in the Doctrine which wee know and assent vnto, making application of it vnto our selues. Marke 16, 16. He that beleeueth shall be saued. John 3, 18. He that beleeueth in the sonne, shall neuer bee condemned. Thus the regenerare beleeue. Gal. 2, 20. Christ loued me, and gaue himselfe for me. Papists deny application of the Doctrine, to be any part of beleefe in God.

                        2 Euery reproachfull word, tending to the hurt and disgrace of any other mans name and credite. Titus 3, 2. Speake euill of no man. In the Originall, it is [Blaspheme no man.] Likewise, in 1. Pet: 4, 4. Therefore speake they euill of you. This is blaspheming of men. Mark: 3, 2. And blasphemies where-with they blaspheme.
                        
                        3 A word vttered vnto the reproch of God, of his Religion, of his Word, Ordinances, Creatures, or Workes. Rom: 2, 24. For the name of God is blasphemed amongst the Gentiles through you. Tim: 6, 1. Examples of this kinde of blasphemy, we haue in Acts 14, 11: and 25, 19. where Festus called Gods Religion, Superstition. 2. Kinges 18, 35. This is the blaspheming of God.
                        4 A malicious reproachfull word, vttered against

the knowne truth of the Gospell: This knowledge of the Gospell, because it is had by the effectuall enlightning of the spirit; therefore, the sin of one who maliciously reproacheth this truth once knowne, is named blasphemy against the Spirit, that is, not against the person, but against the work of the spirite in man, illuminating his soule to see the truth of Saluation. This is Blaspheming agaynst the Spirit.

                           Blasphemy against the spirit, it is a Sinne not in deeds and actions, but in a reproachful word (Mark 3, 30) vttered not out of feare, nor other infirmitie, as Peter did, and sicke and franticke personnes may do; but out of a malicious hatefull heart. 1. Cor: 16, 22. and Heb: 10, 26. Not by one that is ignorant of Christ, as Paule was being a blinde Pharisie; but by one enlightned through the Holy-Ghost with the knowledge of the Gospel (Heb: 6. 4.) Not of rashnes, but of set purpose, to despite Christ his known Doctrine and workes (Heb: 10, 29)▪ Being accompanyed with an vniuersal defection, or falling away from the whole truth of God (Heb: 6, 6) Also with a generall pollution and filthinesse of life (Mat: 12, 45. 2. Pet: 2, 20) Finally, being vnremissible, because such as commit this sin, cannot repent (Mat: 12, 32. Heb: 6, 6.) How are the Papists out of the way touching this point, in that they wil haue this Blasphemy to haue six parts or signes; whereof the chiefe is finall impenitency, which doo accompanie euery sin in the wicked.

manner, Mat: 26, 26. And when he had blessed that is, when he had giuen thankes, as it is in Luke 22, 19. 1. Cor: 11, 24. And in al places where the Saints are said We blesse God wl eo we praise him. God blesseth vs, either when be sendeth good things vnto vs, or remooueth euill thinges from vs, or turneth all to our good: wee blesse one an other by our mutuall prayers. to blesse God, there it is meant, of their Thankesgiuing, and of speaking well of God. The Papistes, by blessing, vnderstand not a solemne blessing, by giuing thankes to GOD, to the consecrating or preparing the Creatures to an holye action; but an operatiue blessing of the bread, making it to bee the body of Christ substantially and corporally: Sée the Annot. on Math. 26, 26.
                        2 To wish and pray for good thinges to others. Gen: 48, 20. Iacob blessed the sonnes of Ioseph. Such was the Priests blessing the people in the Law, and parents blessing their children, euen their good Prayers to God for their welfare.
                        3 To encrease that which is little, and to make it much, as when God is sayde to haue blessed the Widdow of Sarepta her Oyle & Meale in her Cruse. 2. Kings 17, 16. And when Christ blessed the fiue Loaues and two Fishes in the Gospell. This blessing was operatiue indeede, and wrought a sencible multiplication of the Loaues, and Fishes; so was there not a sencible mutation of the Bread and Wine into the body and bloode of Christ by that blessing. Mat: 26.
                        4 To giue good things vnto vs, and to doo vs good in prospering our affayres and labors. Psalme 67, 1. God be mercifull vnto vs, and blesse vs: & verse 6. Prou: 10, 22. The blessing of the Lord maketh rich. Thus the word Blesse is taken in good part.
                        5 To flatter and please ones selfe, and to boast of his doings to others. Psal: 10, 2. The couetous blesseth himselfe. Heere it is taken in euill part.

                        The death and whole sufferinges of Christ. One part of his sufferings being put for all. Eph: 1, 7. By whom we haue redemption through his blood. And often in the Romans, and Hebrewes, and throughout Paules Epistles, is the bloud of Christ (one part of his sufferinges) put Sinecdochically for the whole sufferings, visible and inuisible. Therefore it is absurd to stick to the Letter, concluding from thence, that Christs outward visible suffering were sufficient. For from the Letter of Scripture, it wil follow, that if this blood-shedding was enough, therefore his flesh might be spared, and all the paines felte therein; also his soule, with the heauinesse and sorrow thereof, whereof there was as great need as of the rest. For Christ suffered nothing in vaine, & our soule hauing sinned, yea, and that principally, it was therefore to be redeemed no lesse then our bodies.

The Spirit returnes to God who gaue it; and to plaine reason; for such as were beleeuers in Christ to come, they had saluation of their soules as the end of their faith.

A broken and Contrite hart thou wilt not despise. This is Euangelicall Contrition, and is a work of grace, the beginning of renewed Repentance, as 2. Cor. 7, 10. Godly sorrow causeth Repentance vnto Saluation. Papists erre, in teaching Legall Contrition or sorrow, stirred vp by the threatnings of the Law, to be a worke of grace and part of Repentance: whereas rather, it is a part of the Torment of hell, yet accidentally turneth to the good of the Elect, by making them more fit to receyue grace, being humbled by the Law.

                        Not one worke, or two, or a few Actions, but the whole course of our life, with euery degree and step of it, from the time of our effectuall calling, and so forwards vnto the end of our race. This course

is tearmed an honest Conuersation. 1. Pet. 2, 12. Haue your Conuersation honest. But our course from the time of our byrth, vntill the time of such calling it is tearmed a vaine conuersation. 1. Pet. 1, 18. Redeemed from your vaine Conuersation.

                        The turning, or totall change of an elect Sinner from sinne to God: and in this signification is comprehended, both faith and Repentance, euen the whole worke of grace. Psal. 51, 14. And sinners shalbe Conuerted to thee. This is Passiue Conuersion, wherein we suffer God to worke vpon vs, but our selues by our Naturall power, worke nothing, vnlesse it be to hinder the worke of Grace, what wee may.
                        2 A turning from some perticuler sinne or sinnes, whereby we haue offended God or man. Luke 22, 32. When thou art conuerted. Ier. 31, 18. Conuert thou me, and I shall be Conuerted. This is an Actiue Conuersion, performed by men already regenerate, who being already renewed by grace, doo work together with his Grace; Conuerting grace being accompanied with assisting and supporting grace.
                        God conuerteth a Sinner by putting grace of repentanceNote. into his soule. A Sinner conuerteth himselfe, when he endeuoureth his owne conuersion, diligently and constantly vsing al good means, publicke and priuate.

Sinnes are thus called; First, because they come from persons spiritually Dead. Secondly, they deserue eternall Death, and lead there-vnto without forgiuenesse. What becomes of veniall Sinnes, if all be deadly? If euerie sinne, euen the least, is a work of Death, and in strict Iustice be worthy of Destruction eternall, then no sinne is so light and veniall as can bee doone away without the merit of Christs death, onely by an aspersion of Holy-water, or kissing the Pax, &c.

                        All vnregenerate, natural, and vnmortified men: euen all the elect, as they be and sticke in the corruption of their Nature. These are Dead in sinne; first, because through guilt of sinne they are voyde of true life, and worthy of Death. Secondly, because they are vnder the power of their sinfull lusts, (as one that is drowned in the Water) hauing no more power to do any duty of a godly life, then a Dead man hath to do the duties of natural life. Eph. 2, 2. Being Dead in trespasses and sins, you were quickned. Eph. 4, 1

Where the vigour and force of Sinne, (which is the life of sin) is crushed & extinct, there sinne cannot bring forth such bitter fruits, as it was wont before Sanctification to do; therefore, euen as men which haue so lost their bodily strength, as it cannot be recouered, are saide to bee dead while they liue, so though sinne still liue in the Godliest, yet they are dead to sinne, because the power and

old strength of sin is sore abated, & lessened daily.

                        2 Eternall ruine, when impenitent sinners at the end of their dayes are turned into that deep and vncomfortable pit of hell. Psal. 73, 18. And casteth them downe into desolation.

                        Want of hope; it is eyther in opinion, as when godly men thinke themselues to bee without hope in a pang of temptation, as Dauid did: or in truth, as in wicked men, who alwayes want hope, and sometimes professe the want of it, as Caine. 2. Cor. 4, 8. We Despaire not. Acts 27, 20. We Despaired, or All hope was taken away.

                        2 To neglect the vse of a thing. In this sence the wicked are saide to despise the bounty and patience of God. Also the word of God. Rom. 2, 4. Despisest thou the bounty of God? Acts 13, 41. Behold ye Despisers. Prou. 1, 30. When men make no vse or profit of Gods Word, Chasticements, or Benefits, thereby they declare how they despise them, holding them as vaine things. Thus Children are said to despise the Counsel of their Parents, when they do not follow it.

                           stone shall not be left vpon a stone, that shall not bee throwne downe.

                        3 To bring men vnto a remedilesse downefall and misery, both in body and soule. In this sence, God destroyeth the wicked. Ps. 38, 38. The transgressors shall be Destroyed.
                        
                        4 To take punnishment vpon the wicked, by death, as Magistrates do. Psa. 101, 8. Betimes wil I Destroy the wicked of the Land, and cut off the workers of Iniquity.

                        6 An Whore, which letteth out her body for hire. Deut. 23, 18. Thou shalt not bring the price of a Dog into the house of God.

These greedy Dogs can neuer haue enough, they looke euery one to their owne way, &c. Dumbe and greedy Dogs be carelesse and couetous Shepheards, which minde not the safety of the Flocke, but the benefite of the Fleece.

Rom. 4, 20. Abraham Doubted not through vnbeleefe. Math. 14, 31. Why Doubt ye, ô ye of little faith. Doubting in wicked men comes from want of faith, and meere infidelity: but in the godly, it comes from weakenesse of faith.

First, that his presence is effectuall and mighty, to possesse and gouerne the faithful, which are his Temples, hauing dominion ouer them, inwardly enlightning to know, and powerfully guiding to do the knowne will of God. Secondly; that his presence is continuall, not as of a guest, who lodgeth for a night in an Inne, and is gone next day; nor as a Soiourner that flitteth, but as an owner and possessor to abide for euer, as in Iohn 14. Thirdly, the maner of his presence; not by infinitnesse of power, as he is present to al creatures to sustaine them, but by his grace and healthfull effects, vniting to Christ, regenerating to be his liuely members, witnessing our adoption, &c.

The Capernaicall and Papisticall Eating of Christ, is both absurd and abhominable; for so Infidels and wicked men; yea, very Mice and Rats may eate him, and haue eternall life by him, if his very flesh were corporally present in the place where the Sacrament is administred.

                           It is a solemne and fearfull publike censure of the Church, cutting off lawfully, according to the word of God, and casting out of their publike society and priuate fellowship, such members as publikely offend in some grieuous crime, or be obstinate contemners of the lawful admonitions of the Church for priuate faults, that by such shame they may be driuen to repentance, and others by theyr example kept from Infection of Sin. Mathew 18. 15. 1 Cor. 5, 5, 6▪ 7. 2 Thess. 3, 14. which places plainely shew, what Excommunication is, who are to execute it, vppon whom, for what matters, to what ends, and how long. The abuse of Excommunication in Popery, is manifold & most grosse, especially heerein; that beeing a spirituall censure, they apply it to the deposition of Kings, and alienation of Subiects from their oath of allegiance, & other temporall matters.

                        2 The Doctrine of Faith, or the Gospell which we doo beleeue. Gal. 1, 22. Hee now preacheth the Faith which before he Destroyed. 1. Tim. 1, 19. and 3, 9. Iude 5. 1. Tim. 4▪ 1. and 3, 9. A Metanimie of the Adiunct for the Subiect.

                        4 A naked knowledge of God, ioyned with an outward profession of his religion and Faith. Iam. 2, 17, 24. Faith, if it hath no workes is dead. This is Historicall or Dogmaticall Faith, as Diuines call it.
                        
                           5 A certaine and sure perswasion of some wonderous and strange effects and workes to be done by the power of God. 1. Cor. 13, 2. If I had all faith. Math. 17, 20. This is an actiue myraculous faith, which lasted but a short space.

Gal. 3. 11, 14. And in al those places of scripture, where Righteousnesse, Iustification, life Eternal, and Saluation, are attributed to it. This is Iustifying or sauing Faith, because it enables the elect soule, to receiue Christs perfect Iustice vnto Saluation in heauen. This Faith once had, is neuer vtterly lost, as Papists fancie.
                        8 Fidelity, and faithfulnesse, in doing duties to others without fraud and deceit. Titus 2, 10. That they may shew all good faith; that is, Faithfulnesse.
                        9 Hope. 1. Pet. 1, 5. We are kept through Faith vnto saluatiō. Yet this properly belongs to hope, which is a certaine expectation of saluation promised. A Metanimie, of the Cause, for the Effect.
                        10 A confidence of obtaining some earthly and bodily good thing, after a myraculous sort. Actes. 14, 9. When he saw that hee had Faith to bee healed. This is a passiue miraculous Faith.
                        11 A firme knowledge and assurance of that liberty which Christians haue in thinges indifferent. Rom. 14, 1, 22, 23. Whatsoeuer is not of Faith, is sin.

                        16 Christ, being apprehended by faith. Rom. 9, 32. Also Rom. 3, 28. A man is iustified by faith. So it is put and taken in the Treatise of Iustification, wheresoeuer Faith is written without expresse mē

                        A totall or whole abstinence from meats, drinks, and all other pleasures of this life for a certaine time, to witnesse our vnfained humiliation for sinne, to tame the flesh, and to help our feruency in Prayer, eyther for preuenting some Iudgement to come, or turning away some Iudgement present. It is either priuate or publike. Ester 4, 16. Act 10, 30. Mar. 2, 19. Ion. 3, 4, 5. This is bodily Fasting. which is no worke commaunded in the Law simply for it selfe, much lesse a meritorious work; neither doth Christian Fasting consist, in forbidding of certaine meates at certaine times limited: that is rather a ciuill Fast.

                        3 Abstinence from all manner of meate or sustenance for many daies together, without being any whit hungry. Mathew 4, 2. Hee Fasted fortie daies and forty nights▪: thus Moyses Fasted, and Elias. This is miraculous Fasting, which serued the

more to commend the Doctrine of the Law and Gospell, to shew it to be no vulgar thing, but giuen of God. The apish Imitation of this Fast, by the Papists is ridiculous and ioyned with grosse superstition, in as much as they forbeare flesh in Lent, as a worke of Religion and saluation, contrary to the Scriptures; which teach, that meates defile not a Man.
                        4 Hunger. Math. 15, 32. I will not send them away Fasting; That is, Hungry. 2 Cor. 11, 27. This is a necessary and compelled Fast, which the Saints of God doe ouercome by patience.

                           the dead, to walke in a new life. Maister Brightman expounds the First resurrection, of the calling of the Iewes againe vnto the faith; which is after a sort, a raising them from the dead. This exposition, in substance is one with the former; because the calling of the Iewes, will bee the quickening of them by Grace.

                        5 The whole man, consisting of body & soule. Gen. 6, 12, 13. All flesh hath corrupted his way vpon earth. 1. Pet. 3, 18. Christ was put to death concerning the flesh; that is, concerning his manhood, for his body was dead naturally, and his soule felt the sorrowes of death spiritually. Acts 2, 24. Luke 3, 6. 1. Pet. 1, 24. Math. 24, 22. And elsewhere often, is [Flesh] put, to signifie the [whole humaine Nature.] Rom. 1, 3. and 8, 5. as it is simply considered, without sinfull corruption.
                        6 Mankind, being weake and feeble, eyther to helpe himselfe or others. Ier. 17, 15. Cursed bee he that maketh flesh his arme; that is, which placeth his strength and safety, in weake and vaine man.

                           Esay 40, 6. Psal. 78. 39. Ioell 2, 28. In these, and many other places [Flesh] doth signifie our whole kind, as it is wrapt in great imbecility and frailety.
                        7 The quality of corruption, which is not sinfull, but the effect of sinne, accompanying our bodies in this life. 1 Cor. 15, 50. Flesh and Blood shall not inherit eternall life, neyther corruption inherit incorruption; that is to say, our corruptible bodyes cannot come to Heauen. That which shall inherit Heauen, must be an incorrupt Flesh, a body without corruption.
                        8 What thing soeuer belonges to this present life. 1 Cor. 7, 18. Such shall haue trouble in the flesh. Thus Beza expoundeth it. Also it signifies the estate of this present life. Phil. 1, 24. To abide in the flesh is more needfull for you.
                        
                        9 Whatsoeuer is in man, reputed most excellent and glorious without the grace of Christ; as Nobility, birth, wisedome, wit, vnderstanding, reason. Math. 16, 17. Flesh and Blood hath not reuealed this vnto thee. Iohn 1, 13, 14. Borne not of Flesh and Blood. Iohn 3. Phil. 3.
                        10 All that in Religion, which is outward and to be seene with the eye, as Morall workes or ceremonies. Rom. 4, 1. What hath Abraham gotten according to the Flesh. This word [Flesh] in the second verse, is expounded to be the workes of Abraham, which did not iustifie him before God. Thus Beza and Piscator Interpret this place. Sée Gal. 6, 12. and 33. Where Flesh, signifies the Ceremonies of Moyses Law; and whatsoeuer it is which is without, is noted by this word. Phil. 3, 3.
                        11 The whole Nature of Man, as it commeth into the Worlde, corrupt and vile, infected by sinne; or that part of Man which is vnregenerate. Iohn 3, 6. That which is borne of the Flesh is Flesh. Rom. 7, 5. When we were in the Flesh. Rom. 8, 8.

                           They that are in the Flesh; That is, in the corruptionVnbeleefe, and all motions of the soul which bee euill, all wicked desires, all out wordes and workes done without grace; how good, holy, or spirituall soeuer they seeme to be and shew for; also our learning, doctrine, preaching, prayers, and what else soeuer commeth not of the spirite of Christ, is called Flesh in the phrase of Scripture. of sinfull Nature; and in al other places where the word [Flesh] is applyed to men vnregenerate, it signifies the whole corruption and naughtinesse of our Nature, raging and raigning both in the reason and will: but in those places of Scripture, where [Flesh] is attributed to new-borne persons, and is set against the spirit, as in Gal. 5, 17, 19, 24 Rom. 7, 18, 25. In all these (I say) and such like Texts, the word [Flesh] signifies the remainder of naturall corruption, euen so much of that vicious quality of sinne, as still sticketh behind in regenerate persons, and is vnmortified. The reason and cause why sinne is noted out by the name of [Flesh] it is, because through the Flesh (to wit our Seede) or through carnall generation, sinne is conueyed into the whole man, Soule and Body: also, for that the Flesh or Body is the instrument to execute the lustes of our naturall concupisence. Rom. 6, 13. Thus Piscator, and Peter Martir do iudge. Illiricus addes another reason; to wit, because man, as he is sinfull, tendes wholy to carnall thinges. By this we see, how such are deceiued, who will haue onely the inferior part of the soule (as will and affections) meant by Flesh.
                        12 Common or ordinary course of nature. Gal. 4, 29. He that was borne after the Flesh.
                        
                        13 The Inferiour, or vnreasonable part of the Soule, as it is corrupt by sinne; to wit, the sinfull will and affections. Ephe. 2, 3. In fulfilling the will of the flesh; that is, the desires of our corrupt will.
                        14 Euery liuing Creature, reasonable and vnreasonable. Psal. 136, 25. Which giueth foode to all flesh. Gen. 6. and 7. Leu. 17.

I will giue you an heart of flesh, which is set against a stony heart; that is, hard and hardned, not yeelding to God.

                        2 The Man-hood of Christ, as it is considered apart from his God-head, or Diuine Nature. Iohn 6, 63. The Flesh profiteth nothing; that is to say, the humaine Nature of Christ, is not profitable to vs of it selfe, but as the God-head dwelleth in it, giuing life to it, and quickning vs by it. Thus Maister Tindall, and the Bible-note expound this place. Augustine and Chrisostom expound it of vnderstanding the word Carnally, and not Spiritually. The former is the better.

Ezek. 16, 15. Thou hast powred out thy Fornications; and else-where very often, in this and other Prophets. As Ier. 3, 9.

                        2 Wholy and for euer, to take away from men all such graces as he had giuen them, leauing them altogether to Satan, and their owne lust. This is called a giuing vp, or deliuering vp to vile affections. Rom. 1, 24, Thus God forsakes wicked men, and Hippocrites. Thus did he forsake Cain and Iudas, & Saul. 1. Sa. 16, 14. The Spirit of the Lord departed from Saule. 2. Sam. 7, 15, And thus wil not God forsake his people. 1. Sam. 12, 22. The Lorde will not Forsake his people for his names sake.
                        
                        3 To take away some particular grace, and that for a time onely. Thus was Dauid forsaken, hauing

lost (after his grieuous sinne) cleannesse of heart, peace and ioy of conscience, freedome of Spirite, stablenesse of mind, &c. Psal. 51, 10, &c.
                        4 To take away the knowledge, feeling, fruit, and working of his Graces for a season. Thus was Peter forsaken. Mat. 26. and against this forsaking, Dauid prayeth in Psal. 119, 8. Forsake me not ouer long.
                        
                        5 To withdraw for a time or for euer, his blessings and good successe from our labours, and his temporall protection from our persons, both our selues and ours. Heb. 13, 5. I will not faile thee, nor forsake thee. Psalm 22, 1. Why hast thou forsaken me.
                        
                        6 To withdraw and take away his word, his worship and ministry. Lam. 2, 7. The Lorde hath forsaken his Altar; that is, he hath caused his worship to cease, he hath taken away his Law, his Prophets, his Visions, his Sabbaothes, as verse 7, 9. This is Gods forsaking man.

                        8 To depart from the seruice of the true God, to the seruice of strange Gods. This is a branch and fruit of the former forsaking. Iudges 2, 11, 12. They serued Balim, and forsooke the Lord God of their Fathers. This is mans forsaking of God.
                        9 To deny our help and ayde to others in theyr necessities and dangers. 2 Tim. 4, 16. No Man assisted me, but all forsooke me. Thus man forsaketh man.

Marke 10, 29. Thus the Christian man forsaketh all; first in affection & desire, then in effect and deede, if neede bee, and occasion serue thereunto, as then it doth, when we cannot hold life and earthly thinges, without denying Christ and his word.

This is called Fortune or chance: but in respect of God, who knoweth all things, and ordereth them most wisely to iust and due ends, there is no chance nor Fortune. Eccle. 9, 11. Time and Chance commeth to them all. Luke 10, 31. And it Fortuned, or Chanced. Christians must beware how they do commonly vse this word [Fortune and Chance] in their mouthes, or attribute ought to it, setting it vp against Gods prouidence, which ordereth al things, both good and euill, great and small. I giue this signification of Fortune, onely to shew how far it may bee allowed; namely, so farre, as that in such things (as in regard of our fore-sight happen accidentally to vs) wee doe yet acknowledge a diuine prouidence.

Rom. 6, 14. Ye are vnder grace. Also verse 23. 2 Cor. 12, 9. My grace is sufficient for thee. This is the Grace of Sanctification, which is freely giuen, as a witnesse of Gods fauour in electing and iustifiing vs.

                        11 Fauour or liking with men. Gen. 19, 19. Thy Seruant hath found grace in thy sight. And elsewhere often, as Gen. 6, 8. and 33, 10.

                        15 Generally, any benefit bestowed vppon vs.

                        17 The perswasion, Fruits, & feeling of Gods good will encreased in vs. Rom. 1. 7. Grace and peace from God the Father. Thus is the word [Grace] to bee taken in all the salutations of Paule to the Churches. Also. Gal. 6, 18. Ephe. 6, 24.
                        18 Eternall glory in Heauen. 1 Pet. 1, 7. As they which are Heires of the Grace of life. 1. Peter 1, 13.
                        19 Acceptation with God and Men. Luke 2, 22. Iesus encreased in Grace or fauor with God and men. Iames 4, 6. God giues grace to the humble: that is, makes them accepted and fauoured.
                        
                           What Grace is.
                           Grace, is the free good will of God, whereby he counteth vs deare in Christ Iesus, forgiueth vs our Sinnes, and giueth vs the holy Ghost, and vpright life, and eternall felicity. Thus Peter Martyr defineth it.

                        or thus.
                        Grace vppon Grace; that is, one Grace of the spirit after another; the spirit of Christ daily powring new Graces vppon vs. This is the best exposition.
                     
                     
                        or thus.

Others thinke, that by Hand-writing, is meant the Ceremoniall Law, consisting in Rites, Ceremonies, Sacrifices, and Oblations; the innocent Beasts which were slaine in Sacrifices, and all other Oblations for sinne, witnessing (as a Handwriting) how guilty and worthy wee were to dye through desert of sinne. This is the better exposition; because it is tearmed the Hand-writing of Rites or Ordinances. In Col. 2, 14. and Ephe. 2, 17. it is called the Lawe of the Commaundements, which stands in Rites and Ceremonies.

                        Not to loue some in his eternall Counsell, but

to passe by them, and not to choose them. Rom. 9, 13. Esau haue I Hated; that is, I haue decreed, not to loue him. This Hating hath not foreseen sinne, but Gods will, for the proper cause of it; yet God decrees none to destruction, but for sinne.
                        2 To abhorre actually, and to reuenge sins already committed. Esay 1, 13. I Hate your solemne feasts. Psal. 45, 7. Thou art a God which Hatest wickednesse. God dooth not actually hate his creature, but in regard of sinne inherent, or acted and already done.
                        3 To desire reuenge, or to wish euill, out of a rooted and setled malice. Thus Kain hated Abell. Iohn 3, 13. And Ahab Hated the Lordes Prophet Micha. 1. Kings 22, 8. and wicked men do thus Hate the righteous. Psal. 34, 21. They that Hate the righteous shall perish. This is a hatred of persons, not of sinnes in them; a malicious hatred, of which, in 1. Iohn. 3, 15. Hee that Hateth his Brother, is a Man-slayer.
                        
                        4 To detest sin, because it is the breach of Gods Law. Rom. 7, 15. What I Hate, that do I. Iude 23. Thus the righteous Hate euen the Garment spotted with sinne and corruption. They hate sinne in themselues, and others; pittying the persons of others. This is a hatred of sinne, and not of their persons which do sinne. This is a Charitable Hatred.
                        5 To loue lesse one then another. Luke 14, 26. And Hate not Father and Mother, Wife and Children: Yea, and his owne life, ye cannot be my Disciples.
                        
                        6 To do the actions or works of persons which do hate others. Leuit. 19, 17. Pro. 13, 24. He that soareth correction, Hateth his child; that is, he doth as hatefull persons would do, who keep back from others, that which should do them good.
                        
                           7 To neglect one. Luke 16, 31. He will Hate the one, and loue the other.
                        
                        8 To eschew and flye from. Iohn 3, 20. He that doth euill, Hateth the light.

Or it may signifie, to hate vnfaignedly, and from the heart.

Some see this in themselues, such as do commit that vnpardonable sin. Others do not so much as suspect it: These are secret Haters of God; the others bee open and knowne (at least to themselues) Haters. Rom. 1, 30.

the head of his wife. Ephes. 5, 23. 1. Cor. 11, 3. The Prince is the head of his people. Ex. 6, 14. Exo. 18, 25. Heads ouer the people. Because of the Soueraignty and power ouer them. The first is a spirituall; the second, is an oeconomicall; the third, a politicall Head or Gouernor: the Pope, is so farre from being Head of the Church, as he is no sound member of the holy Catholicke, or of the whole Church, being the head of that Apostacy and falling from the Faith. 2. Thes. 2: 3, 4, 5.

                        5 The whole man, or the man himselfe. Prou. 10, 6. Blessings are vpon the Head of the righteous. In this sence, it is threatned to the wicked, that their sinne shall be vpon their head; that is, vpon themselues.

                        2 To listen vnto the words of God only with the outward sence of the eare. Mat. 13, 19. They Hear the word, and vnderstand it not. Thus all Wicked men which be within the Church Heare the word.
                        3 To yeeld willing assent in our mindes to the word of God, with a firme purpose to obey. Iohn. 8, 47. He that is of God, Heareth Gods word. 1. Iohn

                        4 To submit ones selfe to Christ, as to an heauenly and perfect Schoolmaister. Mat. 17, 5. Hear him; that is, be content to be his Disciples.

                        3 One, who is infinite pure and righteous, so is God only. Leuit. 11, 44. For I am Holy. And 19, 2.
                        4 One, who is consecrated or set apart of God, to be the Messiah and Mediator for mankind, hauing for that purpose all the bounty of his Father powred on him. Psal. 16, 10. Thou wilt not suffer thine holy one to see corruption. Luke 4, 34, I knowe who thou art, euen the Holy one of God. Such an one is Christ only, who being both properly God, & (as man) conceiued of the Holy-Ghost without sinne, ordained to be the Sacrifice for sinne, and to sanctifie and make al his people holy. In these respects, he is often and woorthily in Scripture called that Holy one. Actes. 3, 14. Ye denied that Holy one. 1. Iohn 2, 20. Also he is tearmed the Holy of Holyest, or most Holy. Dan. 9, 24. And to annoint the most holy.
                        
                        5 One, who is not only most Holy in himselfe, but doth immediately by his vertue and working, renew and make Holy others, continually stirring them vp vnto Holy duties. Thus is the spirit, the third person in the Trinity, called Holy. Mat. 28, 19. And the Holy-Ghost. Ephe. 4, 30. Greeue not the holy spirit of God. 1. Pet. 1, 2. Unto Sanctification of the Spirit.

Cor. 1, 2. Unto the Church of God Sanctified by Christs Saints by calling. Deut. 14, 24. Thou art an holy people to the Lorde.
                        
                        
                           7 Things, and persons, which are set apart by Gods ordinance, to Holy vses and Offices. Thus Ierusalem, and the Temple, and the Priests, and the Altar, and the Sacrifices, and the Shew-bread, & the Fire, and Incense, Vessels, Garments, Tithes, & whatsoeuer was dedicated as Sacred vnto God, was called Holy. 1. Sam. 24, 4. Haggai. 1, 12. Leuit. 21, 6, 12. Math. 24, 15. Set in the Holie place.

                        2 That created quality of purenesse wherein the Saints resemble God, being pure, seuered in part from mixture of sin, as God is Holy and pure. Heb. 12, 14. Without holinesse no man can see God.

                        To be satisfied, and fully contented. Iohn 6, 35. He that comes to me, shall hunger no more; That is, in me, and in me alone, hee shall finde that which shall giue him full contentment, and satisfaction to his Soule.

                        One which followeth wild Beasts, to catch them, and take their liues from them, by Snares, Dogs, or otherwise. Such an one was Esau.
                        
                        2 A great Spoyler or Robber, which by might oppresseth others. Such an one was Nimrod. Gen. 10, 8, 9. Nimrod, a mighty Hunter before God.
                        
                        3 The Caldeans and Babilonians, which GOD would send in fury, to vex and hurt rebellious Enemies. Iere. 16, 16. I will send out many Hunters.

                        Any great danger whatsoeuer. Psalm 91, 3. He will deliuer thee from the Snare of the Hunter.
                        
                     
                     
                        
                        
                           to Hunt after ones Soule. sig:
                        To lay in waite to destroy one, by taking away his life. 1. Sam. 24, 12. Thou Hunts after my Soule to take it.
                        
                        2 To put mens Soules in daunger and perill of perishing euerlastingly, eyther by keeping away good doctrine, or teaching false. Ezek. 13, 18. Will ye Hunt the Soules of my people, that ye may preserue your owne Soules aliue? Thus Tremellius reades it.

                        All ciuill Magistrates; who therefore be stiled Humaine Creatures; because, howsoeuer they bee appointed of God, yet their kindes, number, and order, are not so of God laide out, but that Man may make more, or fewer; of greater authority or lesse, as occasions of places, times, and disposition of the people require. 1 Pet. 2, 13. Submit your selfe to euery Humaine Creature. So it is read in the Originall, word for word; and not ordinance of man, as our Translations render it.

Why stand ye heere all day Idle; Because no man hath hired vs. The former are Idle voluntarily, but these latter necessarily.

                        Any Image, or visible representation of false or true God, though it be not worshipped, nor made with any intention of worship. 1. Iohn 5, 21. Keep your selues from Idols. 2. Cor. 6, 16. What agreement hath the Temple of God with Idols. Deut. 4, 15. Exod. 32, 4. doth manifest the truth of this. For, the Image which the Iewes made of the true God, is condemned of God himselfe. Exod. 32, 8. And they that made it were punished as Idolaters. 1. Cor. 10, 7. Neither be ye Idolaters, as were some of them, with whom God was not pleased. 1. Cor. 10, 5. Finally, in the fore-named place of Deut. 4, 15. the only making of an Image of God, is precisely forbidden; and learned See Doctor Fulke in his defence of our translations against Greg. Martine. ch: 3. Diuines both affirme & proue, that both Scriptures and Fathers, haue in differently vsed the worde Idoll and Image, for one and the selfe-same thing. Witnesse that one place of Tertullian (amongst many) vpon those words of 1. Ioh. 5, 21. Iohn (saith he) doth not write thus [Keep your selues frō Idolatry] that is, from the seruice of them: but [From Idols;] that is, from the very Image of

                        The false and faigned Goddes of the Heathen. 1. Cor. 8, 4. An Idoll is nothing. Gen. 31, 19, 30.
                        2 An Idoll to be as an empty and vaine Dreame; not in respect of the matter whereof it is made, for that is somthing: but in respect of the forme which doth counterfaite and falsify true things, making them seeme to be what they are not. Also, in respect of the vaine minde of the Idolater, who wickedly imagineth some Diuinity to be in the Idol, whereas there is but one true God in the world. Therefore worthily is an Idoll saide to be nothing, being a false and lying signe, a very fixion, being nothing for signification, though something for substance; a peece of wood or stone, &c. 1. Cor. 8, 4.

                        2 The making of any Image or likenesse of God, or of any creature, in heauen or earth, for a Religious end. Deut. 5, 8. Thou shalt not make to thy selfe any grauen Image or likenesse, &c. Gal. 5, 20. Idolatry, Witch-craft. 1. Cor. 6, 9.
                        3 All All worship of false Gods, and false worship of the true God, is Idolatrie. humain inuentions thrust into diuine seruice. Deut. 12, 32. Whatsoeuer I command you, that do, put nothing thereto.
                        
                        4 Setting the heart inordinately vpon any creature; by fearing, louing, trusting in it, more then in God, and aboue him. Thus is Couetousnes called Idolatry. Col. 3, 5. And wantons make their Belly their God. Phil. 3, 19.

Thus are men Iealous, and thus also is God saide to bee Iealous, when the marriage betweene him and his Church, is violated and broken. Deut. 5, 9. For I the Lord thy God am a Iealous God; that is, so grieued with Idolatry, as I study to reuenge it.
                        2 One, which seemeth to bee much greeued for others, but it is out of a loue to him-selfe, for his owne commoditie sake. Gal. 4, 17. They are Iealous ouer you amisse. This he writeth of the false Apostles, who for their owne gaine and credite did loue the Galathians. Heere Iealous is taken in euill part.
                        3 One which loueth others truely, not for lucre and glory to him-selfe, but for the benefit of the persons loued. 2. Cor. 11, 2. I am Iealous ouer you. Thus Paule and all Godly Ministers are Iealous ouer the Flocke. Heere Iealous is taken in good part.

Image of the true God vnlawful, aswel as the Image of a false God. This is a Diabolicall Image, being made for Religion sake, and is vnlawfull.

                        6 A reall, essentiall, true, and liuely expressing of the very substance of another. In this signification, is Christ saide to be the Image of God his Father. Col. 1, 15. Heb. 1, 3. Also, the Law is said, not to be the very Image of the thinges. Hebr. 10. 1. And it is written of vs, that as wee haue bornethe Image of the earthly, so we shall beare the Image of the heauenly man. 1. Cor. 15, 49. And the Reuelation of S. Iohn, speaketh of the Image of the beast which all men shal adore. Reuel. 14, 9. In all which places, is meant the very things and substances themselues, or the solid and true existence of the things. These bee essentiall Images, which haue the substance of the things wherof they be called Images.

Psal. 73, 20. Thou shalt make their Image despised. Where the word [Image] signifieth, an immaginary vanishing shaddow, to set forth the lightnesse and vnconstancy of all earthly things, which seeme and make shew to be the true goodes and felicity it selfe, yet are nothing but a shaddow or vaine likenesse thereof: therefore, by

the Apostle, are called; a shape, fashion, or figure. 1. Cor. 7, 31. Rom. 12, 2.

                        3 That, which being once dead, shall rise again neuer to die more, as mens bodies. 1. Cor. 15, 53. Mortality must put on Immortality.

Leuit. 4, 4. And secondly, in solemne benedictions and Prayers. Gen. 48, 14, 17, 20. Iacob put his hands vpon Manasses and Ephraim, and prayed for them. It was continued vnder the Gospell, by Christ and his Apostles in time of Prayer, and bestowing spirituall graces. Also in time of admitting Church-Officers; Ministers, & Deacons. Mat. 19, 15. Christ put his handes on little children and prayed. Acts 6, 6. The Apostles prayed, and laid their hands on the Deacons. Acts 8, 17, 18. Then they laid their hands on them & they receiued the Holy-ghost; and by a Metanimie of the signe, it dooth signifie the whole Ministry of the Church, and the order of Church-Gouernment. Heb. 6, 2. The Doctrine of Baptisme, and Imposition of hands. Touching the Papists Imposition of hands, in the Sacrament of Order (as they cal it) there is no ground for it in the whole Scripture.

                        2 An action of God, freely accounting the righteousnesse of Christ to be his righteousnesse, who beleeues in Christ. Rom. 4, 3, 4. And it was Imputed (or counted) to him for righteousnesse. In this fourth Chapter to the Romans, this word [Imputed] (derided by Popish Heretickes) is seauen times repeated in the Doctrine of Iustification, and is ioyned vnto faith; without which, there is no Imputation of Christs Iustice to vs. Rom. 4, 23, 24. Our

sins and punishment were Imputed to Christ (whoNote. bare our sins in his body, and was made sinne for vs. 1 Pet. 2. verse last.) And his righteousnesse with the merit thereof (euen eternall blisse) is imputed and accounted to al beleeuers; whence ariseth Iustification of a Sinner before God. 2. Cor. 5. verse last. He that knew no sinne, was made sin for vs, that we might be made the righteousnesse of God in him: Not our righteousnesse, but the righteousnesse of God; not in vs, but in him (saith an ancient father.) The Papists, scoffing at this most necessary and deuine action, of Imputing righteousnesse to faith, apprehending Christ, calling it in their Notes printed at Rhemes, a new-no-Iustice, an vntrue Imputation, an immaginary thing, a putatiue righteousnesse, a fantastical apprehension. In these and such like taunts, they vtter so many blasphemies against Heauen, and all to maintaine and establish their owne righteousnesse of workes.

God; The material, is Christ our Redeemer; The formall, is Imputation; The helping Instrumentall cause, is, Faith within, and the Gospell without; The finall cause, is, Gods glory; The vtmost, and our saluation, the neerest end thereof.

                        3 The Morrall Law, is abrogated in respect of beleeuers, onely as touching the Rom, 4, 5. Chapters.

Rom 3, 20 & 7, 7.

The Papistes then doe erre much, in teaching, to seeke our righteousnesse before God, from the works of the Law, eyther in whole, or in part.

Gal 5, 1. Rom 8, 1. from the yoake of the whole Ceremoniall Law of Moyses; but also from Rom. 7, 4, 5. Also Rom. 5, 15. 16, 17, 18 the curse and rigorous exaction of the Morall Law, euen from the whole wrath of God, due to our Sins, by the Iustification of Faith; and finally, Rom 6, 13, 14, 15. from the dominion and raigne of sinne, by the Sanctification of the Spirit: That ye may Luke 1, 74. serue and obey the will of God without all terrour and slauish feare, in all quiet tranquility of minde, and cheerefulnesse of Conscience, vnder sure hope of eternall glory. Therefore they are much deceiued,

whosoeuer thinke Christian Liberty to consist in freedome of the doctrine and obedience of the Morall Law, or from the yoake of any lawfull authority, ciuill, or ecclesiasticall, that men may liue licentiously as themselues list, vsing their liberty as a cloake of wickednesse.

                        A godly Life, is that power which God by the Spirit of his Sonne, putteth into the hearts of the elect, at their regeneration, enabling them to moue themselues towardes God (who before were dead in sinnes) that they might begin to thinke, speake, and doe in some measure, the things pleasing vnto God. This Life beeing once begun, it is still preserued and continued (without returning to death

of sin) vnto the next World; and therefore is called Life eternall. Rom. 6, 7, 8, 9, 23. The gift of God is eternall Life.

                        A Middle person, that commeth betweene two other persons that be at variance, to be a meane of attonement and peace. Gal. 3, 20. A Mediatour, is not a Mediatour of one.
                        
                        2 One that came betweene the Lord and his

people, to declare vnto them the word of the Lord. Thus was Moyses a Mediatour at the giuing of the Law. Gal. 3, 19. And it was ordained by Angels in the hand of a Mediatour.

                        One alone, or one onely, and no more, by whose intercession, our Prayers please God. 1 Tim. 2, 5. There is one God, and one Mediatour. What becomes of the many Mediatours, set vp by the Romish Sinagogue, by a rotten distinction; of Mediatour, of Redemption, and Intercession?

Psal. 1, 2. And in his Law doth he Meditate day and night. Psal. 77, 12. I will Meditate all thy workes. Psalme 119, 99, 97.
                        
                           Mediation, What?
                        
                        It is an action or worke of the Soule, bending it selfe often, earnestly, and orderly, to think vpon a thing; and it is eyther of Gods word or workes.
                        
                           Meditation of Gods word, what?
                        
                        It is a frequent, earnest, and orderly thinking vpon that, which we read or hear, to search it out. First, whether we vnderstand the meaning of it. Secondly, whether we haue found proofs of it. Thirdly, how we may remember that we doe vnderstand. Fourthly, how we may make vse of it for comfort, instruction, &c.
                        
                           
                           Meditation of Gods workes, what?
                        
                        It is a stirring vp of our Soules to trust and loue: to feare and obey God, at the sight or hearing of some work, either of his Mercy or Iustice. Acts 5, 11 And great fear came on al thē that heard these things.

                           Hee hath Mercy on whom hee will. 1. Tim. 1, 13. I found Mercy, because I did it ignorantly. In both these places [Mercy] is put for a calling to Christ, and all Graces, which follow calling. Also Psalme 136. Throughout: by Mercy; Is signified the blessings which proceede from his Mercies.

                        2 To deserue something of God, by the worthinesse of the thing done. Thus Christ alone Meriteth, because there is an equall proportion betweene

his perfect righteousnesse, and the merit of it, which is aeternall glory. Reuel. 5, 12.
                        3 To obtaine and get a thing. Thus the fathers often vse this word in their writings: and thus, all Christians in a good sence, may be saide to merit, because good workes, at last obtaine Heauenly blisse, though they cannot merit it by desert.
                        This word [Merit] is not found in Scripture, butNote. the matter signified by it, both for the second and third signification, is found there. Actes. 20, 28. Ephe. 1, 14. Math. 25, 30, 31, 32.

                        To declare the will of God by voice, for the instruction of the Church. Marke 1, 49. He Preached in their Synagogues.
                        
                        
                           
                           what Preaching is.
                        
                        Preaching, is an action of the Minister of the word, soundly interpreting and opening the sence of the Scriptures, by the Scriptures; with application of them vnto the vse of the Church, by Doctrin, Exhortation, reprofe, conuincing & comfort. Mar. 2, 2. He Preached the word to thē. Lu. 4, 18, 19, 20, 21. He tooke vp the booke, and read, and said; this day is this Scripture fulfilled in your eares. Also, 1 Cor. 14, 3. He that professeth (that is, Preacheth) speaketh to men, to edifying, to exhortation, to comfort. Sée Nehe. 8, 8. And he reade in the booke of the Law, Thus Tremelius translates it out of the Hebrwes and gaue the sence according to Scripture. Acts. 9. 20, 22. Hee Preached Christ 
                           Thus Maister Beza reads, and expounds it according to the greeke. 
                           confirming that Iesus was this Christ (that is to say.) Hee compared Scripture with Scripture, conferring them together, as cunning Craftsmen which ioyne all partes together, to make them agree one with another. This is Preaching in the ordinary phrase of the Scriptue. Indeed euery declaration of Gods wil, eyther by afflictions, blessings, readings, and creatures; or otherwise, may generally and improperly be called Preaching.

                        The fore-appointment of euery thing, to certaine ends. Acts. 4, 28.
                        2 The fore-ordaining of some persons, to obtaine eternall life by Christ. Rom. 8, 30. Whom he Predestinated them he called.
                        
                        
                           Predestination what it is.
                        
                        Predestination, is a most righteous decree of God, freely, according to his own good pleasure (without any respect of forseene faith or works, as mouing causes) ordaining from all eternity out of the whole lumpe of lost mankind, a certaine number, to obtaine eternal life in heauen, by Christ (hauing first called, Iustified, and Sanctified them) vnto the praise of his glorious grace. Rom. 8. 28, 29, 30.

                           Eph. 1. 5, 6, 7.
                        Predestination, is the most wise purpose of God,Predestination what it is, according to Peter Martyr. whereby he hath before all eternity, constantly decreed, to call those whom hee hath loued in Christ, to the adoption of his children, to Iustification by Faith, & at the lēgth to glory, thorow good works, that they may bee made like to the Image of the Son of God, and that in them should bee declared, the glory and mercy of the Creatour.

                           What Presumption is.
                        
                        It is a vice, whereby many men, in regard of Gods blessings and patience towardes them, haue their hearts too much lifted vp in vaine confidence of their owne sufficiency, and Gods goodnesse; waxing secure, haughty, and carelesse, in the course of their liues, without any feare of sin, or Gods iudgments for them.

Leuit. 5, 4, 2, 5. Such were the Priests of the Law, and old Testament; Legall and Leuiticall Priests.
                        2 A Sacrificing person especially ordained of God, that by the Sacrifice of himselfe, once offered by himselfe; and also, by his intercession, he might reconcile vnto, and keepe in fauour with God, for euer, all beleeuing sinners. Such a Priest is Christ onely, being the alone Priest of the New-Testament,

propperly so called. Heb. 7, 17. Thou art a Priest for euer after the order of Melchizedek. Also verse 23. 24, 25, &c. See Chapter 10. from verse 5. vnto the 15. These two significations of Priest, be proper.

Reuel. 1, 6, He made vs Kings and Priests to God. Rom. 12, 1. Heb. 13, 15, 16. This is an improper figuratiue sence of the word, by resemblance and likenesse.

                        The chiefe amongst and ouer the Priests of the Law, who in a speciall manner, was a figure of Christ, both in his garments, publicke workes and actions; and also, in his eminent place, Christ being chiefe among the Pastours, as Aaron was among the Priests. Heb. 5, 1, 2, 3. vnto the 10. verse. For euery High-Priest is taken from among men. 1 Pet. 2, 25.
                        The difference, betweene a Priest properly, andNote this. improperly taken, is this. The former hath an externall and bodily Sacrifice, to giue and offer vnto God, as Christ did giue his owne body; and the Priest of the Law, the bodies of beasts. The latter,

offereth spirituall Sacrifices only; as their Prayers, praise, obedience, almes, and all other Goodworkes and duties of their callings, which euerie Christian (as well as a Minister) is bound to offer. The popish Priest-hood is an immaginary & blasphemous fixion, hauing no grounde, neither any colour and shew of ground and proofe, in the whole Booke of God.

                           Iacob for giuing his Daughter: Saul to Dauid: Dauid to Ionathan.
                        
                        2 Our word passed and giuen vnto God, for some dutie which wee will doe vnto his honour. Psalme 66, 13, 14. I will pay thee my vowes which my lippes haue promised. Numbers. 30, 3. Hee shall not breake his Promise. This is a religious or holy Promise, called a Vowe in Scripture. Sée Vow.
                        3 The word of God, giuen or plighted vnto men, for the performance of some good, or for remouing some euill, spiritually or bodily. Psal. 119. 130. How sweet are thy promises to my mouth? And ver. 49. 50. 38. This is a diuine promise. Which is two fold: Legall and Euangelicall.
                        Gods Promise is two-folde: first Legall, whenNote this. hee passeth his word for the giuing of eternall life, and other temporall good thinges, vpon condition of fulfilling the lawe. Leuit. 18, 5. Ephe. 6, 1. This is the first commandement with Promise. Gala. 3. 12. Doe this and liue. Secondly Euangelicall; when he passeth his worde for the giuing of Christ, and together with him, remission of sinnes, righteousnes, and eternal life, as also the blessings of this life, vpon condition of beleeuing the Gospell. Rom. 1. 2. Which he promised before by his Prophets. And Rom. 4, 
                              •
                           6. That the Promise might be sure to all the seed: That is, to such as walke in the steps of Abrahams faith. Galat. 3, 14. That wee might receiue the Promise of the spirit through faith. This latter promise, is called the Promise of grace, because it is freely giuen, and freely performed. Also Galat. 3, 14. It is called the Promise of the spirit, because the spirit is both the authour and applier of it. More ouer the thinges Promised, come from the spirit. This Promise is also called the worde of faith. Rom. 10, 8. Because the worde of this Promise, is made with

condition of faith, which is the only instrument to apprehend and receiue it. Lastly, it is termed the Promise of Christ, because he is the terme and end of it.

                        3 To loose wholy the grace of the spirit which once he had; as if one should put out fire with water.

Thus the wicked, by their obstinacy in sinne, Quench the spirit, as Saule and Iudas did. 1 Thess. 5, 19. Quench not the Spirit. And thus a godly person neuer can quench the spirit; for the Spirit abideth in them for euer. Iohn 14. And 1 Iohn 3. The seede of God remaineth in them. Of this seede, Peter saith, it is immortall. 1 Pet. 1, verse last. Also Christ maketh request for beleeuers.

                        2 The day and time of the last Iudgement, when our whole Nature, being perfectly restored, both body and Soule, shall enioy the heauenly inheritance. Mathew 9, 28.

                           Regeneration, is commonly put and vsed byNote this. Diuines, for Sanctification and Renouation; and then it imports and signifies as much, as the reformation of a Man; which consists in the Mortification of sinne, and newnesse of life. Whereas, if we speake exactly, and as the thing is, this renewing of our Nature, is but an effect and fruit of our Regeneration, which properly is, our incorporation and ingrafting into Christ by Faith, whereby wee haue our spirituall being of Children in the Kingdome of grace, as by Carnall generation we haue Naturall being in the Kingdome of this world. Sée Iohn 1, 12, 13, 14. Regeneration may therefore thus be defined.
                        
                           Regeneration what?
                        
                        Regeneration, is a worke or act of Gods wonderfull power, begetting the elect againe to himself, by the ministry of the word, through the spirit, that of the Children of wrath (by the desert of sin) they might bee made (by grace, through faith in Christ) the Sonnes and Daughters of God. Iames 1, 18. Of his owne will begat he vs by the word of truth. Titus 3, 4, 5, 6. Therefore, the confounding of Regeneration, with Sanctification, I doe take to bee an ouer-sight: but I iudge it a grosse errour, to thinke our selues to haue any stroke in our Newbirth; so much as to assent to it; til of vnwilling, we be made willing.

                        2 Helpe and succour, proceeding from his power. Reuel. 1, 17. He laid his Right hand vpon mee; and said, Feare not. Psal. 138, 7. and 139, 10.
                        3 The high and exceeding great glory of God the Father. Psal. 110, 1. Sit on my Right hand.
                        
                        4 Euerlasting ioy and blisse in the life to come. Math. 25, 33. Hee shall set the Sheepe on his Right hand.

                        The highest and greatest worldly preferment, which Christ (as King) can giue to his chiefe fauourites and seruants. Math. 20, 21. Graunt that these my Sonnes may sit, one on thy Right hand, &c. The Woman that made this request, did thinke Christ to be an earthly King; and therefore, desired for her sonnes (not a Tyranicall Gouernment, which had beene vnnaturall for her to aske; vnfit for Christ to giue; and vnprofitable for her sonnes to receiue) but the highest lawfull dignities vnder Christ: such as Ioseph had vnder Pharaoh in Egypt; and Daniell, vnder Darius in Babylon. It is a fault in the Rhemists, who thinke Heathenish Tyrannic forbidden heere, which the other Apostles would haue pittied, not disdained. Mark 10, 41.
                        2 The cheefest glory and blisse in the kingdom of heauen. Math. 20, 23. To sit on my Right hand, and on my left, shall be giuen to them, for whome it is prepared of my Father. These words teach plainly, two things: First, that there shall be differences

and degrees of glory in heauen: Secondly, that they are prepared and appointed of God, in his aeternall purpose.

                        3 Christ Iesus, who is called a Rocke, in two respects. First, because wee haue from him our soule-refreshing; as water gusht out of the Wildernesse, to refresh the people being thirsty. 1 Cor. 10, 1. The Rocke that followed them, was Christ. Secondly,

because hee alone strongly sustaines and beares vp his Church, built vppon him by faith; as a house vpon a Rocke. Math. 16, 18. Upon this Rocke will I build my Church. The Papists, which expound this, not of Christ beleeued on, and confessed by Peter, but of the person of Peter: they deale reprochfully with Christ, by lifting the creature and seruant of Christ, into the roome & place of his Creator & Lord. Also falsely with the Text, which saieth, not [vpon this Peter,] but [vpon this Rocke] that is; not vpon thee Peter, but vppon my selfe (as Augustine expounds it.) Lastly, they offer wrong, and deale iniuriously with the Church, to build it vpon so feeble, fraile, and weake a Rocke as Peter; who failed more often then any of his fellow▪ Apostles, (Iudas excepted.)

                        A Sacrament, is a visible signe and seale of an inuisible grace: or more largely thus. It is an ordinance of God, in the right vse whereof, the partaker hath assurance of his being in the Couenant of grace, and saluation by Christ. Of such Sacraments there bee two onely vnder the New-Testament; Baptisme, and the Lords Supper. The former, being a Seale of our entrance into the Couenant; the other, a Seale of our continuance in the Couenant. Math. 26, 26, 27. Also 28, 18, 19. 1 Cor. 10, 1, 2, 3. 1 Cor. 12, 13. The seauen Sacraments of Papists, are too many by fiue, which either lacke an outward signe, or institution by Christ, or be no Seales of sauing grace.

                        A sacred action, wherein the faithfull Iewes did voluntarily worship God, by offering some outward thing vnto his glory, thereby to testifie his chiefe dignity and dominion ouer them, and their

seruitude and submission vnto him. Such Sacrifices, were eyther propitiatory, to procure fauour and pardon, after some sinne: or gratulatory, to giue thankes and praise after some benefit. Psalm 50, 8. I will not repoooue thee for thy Sacrifices. And 51, 16. Leuit. 31. And 4, 2. This is Legall Sacrifice, and typicall. Christ Iesus being the truth and substance, who in the offering of himselfe once vppon the Crosse, hath fully appeased Gods wrath.
                        2 Our whole spirituall seruice and Christian duties of all sortes, within our generall and speciall callings. Psalme 51, 17. The Sacrifices of GOD are a contrite Spirit, &c. 1 Pet. 2, 5. Heb. 13, 15. This is Euangelicall Sacrifice. But touching Papisticall Sacrifice of the Masse, the Scripture is altogether mute and dumbe, saue to cry out against it.

                        Things hid from the vnderstanding of all men, and knowne onely vnto God. Deut. 20, 29. Secret things belong to God. Thus Gods Counsels and Decrees are called secrets, till euents declare them.
                        2 Darke things, being hid from naturall men, and hard to be vnderstood without speciall illumination of the Holy-ghost. Psal. 25, 14. The secret of the Lord is reuealed to them that feare him. Math. 13: 11. Thus is the Gospell a secret. See Mysterie.

I haue a secret errand to thee, (ô King.) Thus infirmities & Counsels; our own, or others, are called secrets. As Gen. 49, 6.

                        8 To know a thing with approbation & loue

                        Hypocrisie in the Doctrine or worship of God, or in maners and life; when false Doctrine is mixed with true, and mens inuentions with Gods worship; and curiosity, with honest simplicitie. Leuit. 19, 19. Deutro. 22, 9. Thou shalt not sowe thy Uineyard with diuers kinds of Seede.
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           Seeking. sig: pro
                        An action of a man, that desireth to finde something which he lacketh, as Saule did seeke his Fathers Asses. 1 Sam. 9, 3, 4. & the woman sought hir lost Groat. Luke 15, 8.
                        2 The action of a godly person, springing from an earnest desire of hauing some excellent & needfull

grace, which is absent and wanting to him, either in whole or in part; in substance, or in degree. Thus wee are commanded to Seeke the Kingdome of Heauen. Math. 6, 33. to Seeke Wisedome. Prou. 2, 4. to Seeke God and his face. Psal. 27, 
                              •
                           8. Esay 55, 6. Also, to Seeke Christ, &c. For these thinges are still wanting to the Godly, who haue them not in such measure, as they would and should.
                        3 Praying, or asking by Prayer. Math. 7, 7. Seeke, and you shall finde.
                        
                        4 An action of Gods loue, towards such as haue forsaken him. Luke 19, 10.
                        The actiō of our seeking hath these degrees. First, the feeling of the want of som excellent & needful thing. Secondly, an ernest desire of finding. Thirdly,Note. a diligent vse of all good meanes whereby to attaine it; as Prayer, reading, hearing, &c. Fourthly, constancy till we find. Fiftly, a loue of the thing found. Sixtly, care to keepe, & loathnesse to loose it. This whole action, is shaddowed in the example of Mary, in seeking vp of Iesus. Luke 2, 44, 45, &c.
                        First, that wee are either lost (as all are beforeSeeking referred to God, doth imply & contain vnder it, these fiue seuerall things. their conuersion) or stragled from him (as euery conuerted person is more, or lesse; at one time or other.) Luke 19, 10. Luke 15, 3, 4, &c.
                        2 A desire and care in God, to recouer vs, and to bring vs backe to himselfe (as an Hen is careful to gather her Chickings.) Math. 23, 37. How often &c.
                        
                        3 The offering and continuing vnto vs means, that he may finde vs; to wit, his Word, Ministers, blessings, corrections, motions of his spirit, checks of our Conscience, admonitions of the godly: By all which, we are sought vp and called to him, as thorough the whole Scripture manifestly appeareth.
                        
                           4 His great loue towardes vs, being found and recouered. This is expressed, in the father of the lost sonne. Luke 15, 22.
                        5 Lastly, care to keepe vs still, with vnwillingnesse to loose vs again. Iohn 10, 28. None shal take them out of my hands. All these things are shaddowed out vnto vs, in him that fought his lost sheepe. Luke 15, 2, 3, 4, 5, &c.
                        Seeking (as it is affirmed of Hypocrites & wickedNote. men) is nothing else, but the making of a shew, as if they felt a want of God, and his good guifts, and were desirous to find them, when in truth they seeke not him, for him-selfe, but for some other thing, as their owne case and commodities, &c. Or they Seeke other things more then him, or before him, as worldlings; or Seeke him amisse, not in his word, as Heretickes; or not in all his word, as Hypocrites Seeke him: or lastly, they Seek him too late, when he is not to bee found; as the fiue foolish Virgins did, and all secure Christians doo. Of these, and such like Seekers it is written. Prou. 1, 20. They shall Seeke mee earely, and shall not finde me.

                        3 Our reason and will, as it corrupted with sin, which cleaues so close to vs, & we make so much of it, as if it were our owne selfe. Luke 9, 23. Let him deny himselfe.
                        
                        4 The mercies of God, or his truth and iustice. Esay 43, 25. I will put out his iniquity for my selfe.
                           
2 Tim. 2, 13. He cannot deny himselfe. His Mercie and Iustice be himselfe.

                        To make slight reckoning of it, as men commonly do of those things which they Sell. Prou. 23, 23. Buy the truth, but Sell it not.
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           to Sell all we haue. sig:
                        To pull our hearts from the thinges we possesse, and to bee ready indeede to make Sale of them, when Gods glory, and the necessitie of our Neighbour requires it. Marke 10, 21. Sell all thou hast and giue to the poore. Acts 2, 45. and 4, 34.
                        2 Willingly to depart from, and forsake al our sinnes, both of Nature and action, open and secret, and al our pleasures and profits too, which we cannot hold without sinne.

                        3 One, that serueth and obeyeth God, not onely in the common profession of godlinesse, but in some particular function and calling. Thus Paul calleth himselfe the Seruant of God. Rom. 1, 1. Paule a Seruant of Iesus Christ. In this sence also, Christ is tearmed the Seruant of his Father, to execute his will (as Mediatour) in working mans redemption. Esay 53, 11. My righteous Seruant.

workes are done and performed.

                        One, who of his owne accord, readily obeyeth the desires and motions of sinne. Rom. 6, 20. For when yee were the Seruants of sin; that is, when ye liued in sin, doing that willingly which it commanded.

Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him onely shalt thou Serue. Exod. 20, 5. Thou shalt not bow downe to them, nor Serue them. This is our religious seruice of God, in his publike worship.
                        5 To sticke vnto, and to follow the true God and his true worship, forsaking all strange Gods, or strange worship of the true God. Iosh, 24, 15. I, and my house will Serue the Lord.

                        3 Christ, who is likened to a Stone, because he beares vp the whole building of the Church, & ioynes together Iewes and Gentiles, as two Wals in one. Hence he is called the Head-stone, or the the Corner-Stone. Math. 21, 42. And because this Stone is not set vp by man, but sent by God, therefore he is said to be a Stone cut out of the Mountaines without handes. Dan. 2, 45. And because

Vnbeleeuers refuse to be laid vpon this Stone, and so perish; therefore it is called, A Stone of offence. Esay 8, 4. 1 Pet. 2, 8. A Stone to stumble at, and a Rocke of offence. Moreouer, because he is of exceeding great value and excellency: thence is he called an elect and precious Stone. 1 Pet. 2, 6. Behold, I put in Sion a cheefe Corner-Stone, elect and precious. Whereunto adde this, that he is tearmed a Liuing Stone, because by his euer-liuing vertue, hee preserues in life of grace all the faithfull, till he bring them to the life of glorie. 1 Pet. 2, 4. To whom wee come, as to a liuing Stone. Lastly, because the most perfit prouidence of GOD watcheth ouer the Church, and euery faithfull person built vppon this Stone; therefore it is saide, that seauen eyes shall bee vppon it. Zacha. 3, 9. Vpon one Stone shall be seuen eyes. Zach. 4, 10.

                        A Vowe, is a testification of a willing promise, made deuoutly and properly vnto God, of some lawfull thinges which doo belong vnto God, and being in our owne power, vnto the seruice and honor of his name. Such a Vow, is either Legal, appertaining to the Law, or Euangelicall pertayning to the Gospell; and this latter is either generall to all Christians, as that of our baptisme; or else particular and speciall; as when wee binde our selues to a greater endeuour to leaue some sinne, or to do some dutie. Psalme 116, 18. Eccl. 5, 4. The VowesOf Popish Uowes. of perpetuall Chastity in single life, of wilfull pouerty, and the like, they are vnlawful, as not being in our owne power, nor required of God; much more vnlawfull are the promises and Vowes of massacring Innocent Christians, and killing lawfull Kinges, vnder pretence of aduancing the Holy Catholicke faith, as they falsely call their Romish Idolatrous Religion.

                           Psal. 15, 5. He that lendeth his Money vpon Vsurie.
                           Note. The worde [Vsury] is neuer vsed in good sence or part by the Scripture; where also no Vsurie is to be found but one; to wit, a biting and gnawing Vsury, which is neuer practised without hurt, either to rich or poore; to priuate personnes, or publicke weale.
                        
                           What Vsury is.
                        
                        Vsury, is any encrease or vantage, for lone of Money, or other things, imposed or layde by the lender vpon the borrower onely, in consideration of the lending. Ezek. 18, 5, 6. Deut. 13, 19, 20. Or more breefely thus: Vsury, is a certaine gaine aboue the principall, exacted vppon Couenant for the vse of money, or other things lent. Exod. 22, 25. Thou shalt not impose Vsury vpon him. Thus it is in the Haebrew Text.
                        
                           Fiue things belonging to Usury.
                        
                        Vnto Vsurie these fiue things are necessarily required. 1. A principall, as wares, or sum of money. 2. Lending. 3. Gaine. 4. A chiefe purpose by lending to encrease our stocke. 5. a Couenant for that end.
                        As the verie desire and expectation of gaine, for lending onely, is mentall and intentionall Vsurie:Note. so the imposing, or by Couenant before hand, agreeing for encrease aboue the principall, is of the Nature of actuall Vsury.
                        
                           In all these three cases, there is no Imposition of encrease, that is, no fore-Couenant, binding absolutely the borrower to pay gaine with the stocke.
                        
                        There are three cases wherein encrease may beeNote. taken by a lender without danger of Vsury. First, when the borrower hauing by lawfull meanes, made some great gaine by money freely lent, doth

by way of Thankefulnesse, out of the voluntary motion of his owne heart, returne some-thing aboue the principall vnto the lender, by whose means he had such a blessing.
                        2 When it may be duly and apparantly proued, without pretence and collusion, that the borrower by holding backe the money lent him after the day agreed vpon for paiment, without the leaue of the lender, doth become heereby a direct and effectual cause of hinderance to the Lender, either by damage arising to him, or by fore-going some commoditie which he might well haue made with his money, had it come home at the appointed time.
                        3 When the Lender is content to hazard the principall, and to beare part of the losse, if any fal to the borrower, without his owne default. Heere he lawfully may take part of the gain which commeth by good meanes.

                        2 A recompence or reward, giuen to Souldiers in liew of their seruice in Warre. Hence the punishment of aeternall death, due by the desert of seruing sinne, is called Wages. Rom. 9, 19. The wages of sinne is death. Thus Wages in a borrowed sense, doth signifie aeternall life due to the merit of workes (if one could doe them) or aeternall death, merited by the seruice of sinne.

                        3 An earnest desire of doing good things belonging vnto vs, and of hindering euill things, being ioyned with sound knowledge and hearty loue of Gods glorie, and of our Neighbours good. 2, Cor. 7, 11. Yea; what Zeale? Col. 4, 13. I beare him record, that he hath a great Zeale for you. Thus far it is taken in good part.
                        4 Earnestnesse of affection in good thinges, when neither the maner nor end of doing is good. Such was the Zeale of Iehu. 2 Kinges 10, 6. And of the Iewes. Rom. 10, 2. They haue the Zeale of God, but not according to knowledge. Also of Paule being a Pharisie. Actes 22, 15. And was Zealous towardes God.
                        
                        5 Fierce and fiery bitternesse, when men are earnest and hot in a bad cause. Phil. 3, 6. Concerding Zeale, I persecuted the Church. Here it is taken in ill part.
                        6 Enuy, indignation. Actes 5, 17. Also 7, 9.

And 17, 5. The Iewes mooued with Zeale or Enuy. The Greeke word translated Enuy or Indignation, doth signifie Zeale, in ill part.
                        7 The most earnest loue of God, for the good of his Church, and his owne glory. Esay 9, 7. The Zeale of the Lord of Hoastes will performe this. Esay 37, 32. Here also it is taken in good part.
                        Vnto true Christian Zeale, there bee these sixeNote. things required. First, a desire and lust after some thing which is truely good, or against some-thing which is euill indeed. Secondly, that in this desire, there be earnestnesse and vehemency. Thirdly, that there bee a griefe for the want of this good thing we desire, or for some abuse done to it. Fourthlie, that this desire and griefe be tempered with Charity and discretion. Fiftly, that we seeke not our own but Gods glory. Lastly, that all this doe proceede, and come from sincere and distinct knowledge of the word. Gal. 4, 18. Rom. 10, 2. 1 Cor. 10, 31. Actes 14, 14.

The vnderstanding of it hath been found hard, euen to the godly, and the learned.

Reue. 16, 17. And the seauenth Angell poured out his Uioll into the Aire.

Therefore, here is no ground for Popish Priest-hood, Sacrifice, and Altar; for the which, seeing there is no Scripture at all, neither is there any allusion in Scripture to such thinges, as the Rhemists foolishly dreame vpon this place. Re. 8, 3. Another Angell stood before the Altar, and vpon the Golden Altar. Other Diuines, vnderstand by the Altar, and Golden Altar, the selected company of Saints, or the company of most holie Men. The former is the more receiued signification.

Reuel. 22, 13. I am Alpha and Omega, the first and last, the beginning and the end. Alpha, one of the first Greeke Letters; and Omega, one of the last, be heere expounded, to be that first and last, beginning and end; that one aeternall and Almighty God, which neuer changeth his minde, and is able to performe what hee promiseth. Such an one is Christ, therefore worthy to be beleeued when he speakes of thinges past, or to come. Sée Chap. 1, 8.

                        A created Spirit, or spirituall substance, which is called a Man, because it assumed and tooke the shape of a man. Reuel. 21, 17. By the measure of man; that is, of the Angell. This same is vnderstood of the Ministers of the Gospel, which do nothing in their seruice after their owne pleasure, but (as Angels of God) in all thinges doe respect the will of God.
                        2 The Minister of the word, which is Gods Messenger, sent to declare his will to some Church ouer which he is set by the holy Ghost. Reuel. 2, 1. Unto the Angell of the Church of Ephesus, write.
                        
                        3 The Lord Iesus Christ, our King and Sauiour,

who maketh intercession for the Saintes, with God the Father, offering vp their Prayers (as the Calues and Sacrifices of their lippes.) Reu. 8, 3. Then another Angell came. By the mediation of this Angell, the Church is kept safe amiddest great dangers, and receiueth many heauenly gifts. Some by this other Angell, vnderstand a certaine man, after the vse of Scripture; to wit, Constantine the Great. Other, take the word properly for a created Spirit. Formost, is the most receiued exposition.

                        So many created Spirits, as Seruants & Ministers of God, being alwayes in readines (which is meant by standing before God) to execute his heauie Iudgements vpon the wicked, namely, Anti-christ and his members. Reuel. 8, 3. I saw seauen Angelles which stood before God. These Angels, whether good or bad, it appeares not by the Text.

                        Foure vncleane Spirits, or Diuels of Hell, as appeareth by this, that the plagues which these foure Angels must execute, are spirituall, tending to the destruction of sules, such as Diuels do execute. Re. 7, 1. I saw four Angels stand vpon the 4. corners of the earth. These foure Angels were foure Wicked Spirits. 1. of Contention. 2. of Ambition. 3. of Heresie. 4. of Warre. Also in Chap. 9. verse 14. By foure Angels is meant, the foure chiefe Heades or Authours of the Turkish Gouernment, ruled by Diuels.
                     
                     
                        
                           Another Angell. sig.
                        Christ Iesus, who is another differing from the common Angels, not onely in number, but in Essence, Office, and operation, exceeding al Angels being an eternall Angell or word of God, Mediatour of the Couenant. Reu. 7, 2. I saw another Angell come vp from the East. So is another Angell taken. Cap. 8, 3. and 10, 1. but others do vnderstand that other Angell. Cap. 7, 1. of Constantine the

Great, who came out of the East parts, and succeeded Dioclesian in the Empire. Howbeit, sithence it is Christ alone, who hath the Seale to set vpon all the elect; therefore the former signification, is to be receiued in mine opinion.
                        2 A created spirit, throughly furnished with power, and with slight of glory (as ensigne of Power) deputed and appointed to this seruice of ruinating Babylon. Reu. 18, 6. I saw another Angell. This isNote. to be noted through this Booke, that the Angels, both holy and vncleane Spirites, according to the Nature of the work to be done, are the adminsters and Executioners of Gods decree and counsell, both for safety of his true flocke, and for the ouer-throw of the false Antichristian Church and Turkish conuenticles, assembled against Christ.

                        An heauenly Spirit, Minister and Proclaimer euen in the Sunne; that is, openly, and in the sight of all (as Proclamations are wont to bee made by one standing in some high place, where he may bee heard) of a glorious Conquest and victory, which Christ and his Church should haue and get, ouer the Beast and the false Prophet, his strong enemies. Reuel. 19. 17. And I saw an Angell stand in the Sunne. Yet some Diuines, interpret this of some particular man, which should be a member of some particular Church, brightly shining aboue other Churches, in purity of heauenly doctrin, & light of the holy truth. By comparison with Reu. 12, 1. this rare Man should arise out of the Westerne Church, to call Christians of the West vnto battaile, or rather to take the spoile of the Beast and the false

Prophet, being subdued in Warre. The former exposition, is of Interpretors more commonly receiued: yet both may stand together, for Christ, the Authour and giuer of the victory ouer the Antichristian Army, and his Instrument whosoeuer are not contrary.
                     
                     
                        
                           Another Beast. sig:
                        The Ecclesiasticall Dominion and Kingdome at Rome, exercised with tyrannous and beastly fury & fiercenesse. It succeeded the politique power of the Emperours, beeing now to be found resident in the corporation of the Pope and his false Prophets, and forgerers of false doctrine. This Dominion and power Ecclesiasticall, though it bee the same with the former politique power of Emperours, in nature and constitution, both being bloudy and beastly; yet it is called another Beast, because this power had another Originall and beginning. For the former Beast with seauen heads came out of the Sea: this other Beast, came vp out of the Earth; that is, his authority was encreased and raised vp euen aboue Lay-men, not exempting the Emperour himselfe, which became vnderling and Vassall to the Pope, hauing before great authoritie ouer the Cleargy alone. This happened in the time of Gregory the second. Hence it is, that the Monarchy and Dominion of the Pope, was both the seauenth head of the former Beast described in the beginning of the thirteenth Chapter: And also, a Beast of himselfe, euen in respect of the double power which this second Beast did challenge; that is, the highest power ciuill ouer all Emperors and Kings; Also, the highest power spirituall ouer the Faith, ouer the consciences and Soules of all men. Reue. 13, 17. And I behold another Beast comming vp out of the Earth, &c. It is vsual in Scripture, by Beasts, to vnderstand Kingdomes and Dominions ruled in a beastly fashion. As in Daniell often,

and in the Reuelation.

When it is saide heere, these are departed, it signifieth, eyther that their desired and longed for Haruest of all ripe and delicate fruites was perished, so as they had not their wonted abilitie; or else their wanton lust after such fruits (about which they spare no cost to procure them) was now extinct and quenched, which causeth the friendes of Rome to mourne. Reue. 18, 14. And the Apples which thy Soule lusted after, are departed from thee.

For Rome the Wester ne Mysticall Babylon, was to the Christians, in respect of tyranny and cruell persecution, what the Easterne Babylon was to the Iewes: beeing also like vnto that Babylon in Assiria, for Idolatry, superstition, and worship of diuils, as it must at last be like it for fearefull euents, in a grieuous ruine and downfall, and for this likenesse sake, Popish Rome beares the Name of Babylon. (the kingdom of Antichrist, worthily called Babilon, because it is a Kingdome of confusion.) Reuel. 14, 8. Babylon that great Citty is fallen. Also Chapter 17, 5, 9, 18. Where it is plain to him that will vnderstand, that by Babylon is meant Rome; this beeing the onely Citty in the Worlde, which in Saint Iohns time, seated on seauen Hils, and which raigned ouer the Kings of the earth, and

by a strong hand, or cunning entisements, compelled Kings and nations to admyt her Idolatries & Haeresies; which is, to commit fornication with her, as it is sayde in verse 2. of the 17. Chapter of this Booke.

Reuel. 2, 14. Thou hast them which maintaine the Doctrine of Balaam. Other Diuines, do distinguish betweene the Doctrine of ye 
                           Nicholaitanes, which was touching bodily fornication, in the promiscuous vse of women and the Doctrine of Balaam, which beside the defiling of the body, tended to the polluting of the mind, by Idolatry. And thus it seemeth to me, the Holy-Ghost doth distinguish them in this Epistle, to the Church at Pergamus, speaking of them seuerally; of the one, verse 14. of the other, verse 15. The Church of Ephesus was troubled with the error of the Nicholaitans. Chap. 2, 6. This Church of Pergamus, with the Doctrine of Balaam that cursed Charmer.

Psalmist prophesied. Ps. 60, 8, 9. or that, which is in the militant Church, fought continually between the godly and vngodly; elect and reprobate; vnder the conduct of those two great Captaines, Christ, and the Dragon. Or finally, that warre, which Constantine the Great, as Christes Champ

And some Diuines, will haue this battell in heauen, to be that most dangerous endeuour and attempt of Satan, when hee first (in the very Spring of the Church) laboured to destroy the aeternall saluation thereof, being founded in Christ. Reu. 12, 7. And there was a Battell in heauen. Let the learned Iudge of these seuerall significations; whereof the two first (in mine Opinion) cannot be meant, because this part of the Reuelation, it is of thinges to come, and of particular euents.

Or els, as some wil haue it, the Lyon, resembleth the noble courage of Angellicall Spirites; a Calfe, their strength; an Oxe being the strongest of beasts, as a Lyon is most coragious; a Man representeth their Wisedome and great vnderstanding, wherein man excelleth al inferiour creatures, and an Eagle which soareth

aloft, signifyeth their knowledge of high & great secrets. Howbeit, some there bee, which thinke these foure beasts to be all such seruants of God, as haue employd their labour faithfully, in deliuering vnto the church the truth of Doctrine, & in administring other holy things. The first signification, is most commonly embraced. Reu. 6, 7. Round about the Throne were foure Beasts, ful of eyes before & behind; the first Beast was like a Lyon. They doo erre, which apply these foure Beastes to the foure Euangelists.

Where that Beast and that false Prophet are. Heere note, that false Prophet, being distinguished from the Beast, signifies the Pope with his Cleargy. All these shall suffer eternall paine, together with the Turke, for corrupting the world with lyes, errours, superstitions, and destroying the Saints.

                        The Roman Empire or ciuil monarchy of Rome, which should be a main Instrument of the Dragon to make war against the Church. This Empyre, is likened to a beast, because it should (without al humanity or sence of reason) in a furious brutish maner persecute Gods people. It is sayde to come vp out of the Sea; to signifie, that at first, it did arise out of the contentions and diuisions of other Nations (which are as a raging Sea) & that the Rule & kingdome of the Emperors, should bee turbulent, tempestuous, variable, and vnconstant. Of this Empire, the estate, acts, effects, and vse, for instruction of the Godly, are described in the 10. verse of this 13. Chapter, where beginneth the History of another Beast, the Ecclesiasticall and Prophetical body, or corporation; to wit, the Pope of Rome, and his Cleargy. Others, expound this Beast of

that Anti-christ, and apply to him the things heere spoken, but the former is plainest and soundest: for hauing in the 12. Chapter, described the Archenemy to the Christian Church; to wit, the diuell, good order required the two principall instruments; to wit, the ciuill and ecclesiastical estate of Rome should be opened, which is done in this 13. Chapter. Reuel. 13, 1. And I saw a Beast arise out of the Sea, hauing seauen heads, and ten hornes.

                        Antichristian kingdome and power, which in the spirituall combate, shalbe inferiour to the witnesses or seruants of Christ, but not so in the bodily and carnall warre, wherein Antichrist shall preuaile. Hee is said to come out of the bottomlesse pit, not to signifie (as some thinke) that the great Antichrist should be a diuel, but because the beastly power of Antichrist should be giuen him of the Diuell. As Chap. 13, 
                              •
                           . and exercised for the diuell, to establish his kingdome of darknesse, by fighting (against the true Doctrine and Religion) with the faithfull followers of it, for the vpholding of Haeresie and Idolatry. Reuel. 11, 7. And the Beast that commeth out of the bottomlesse pit, shall warre against them, and kill them. In Chap, 9. hee is there called the Angell of the bottomlesse pit.

Reuel. 14, 13. The dead which dye in the Lord, are fully blessed. If it be translated, are [Blessed from henceforth] that is; presently or forthwith, the Greeke Word [a parti] will beare it wel, and the truth also.

Reu. 16, 4. The Riuers & Fountains of Water becam blood. These riuers & fountaines, some expound of the Iesuites; whence other Papists draw instructions (as the Sea is nourished by Fountains and Riuers) the turning of these into blood, is the putting of those to death which were cheefe Maisters in Popery, which was done in this our Kingdome and Dominion, 1581, when an Acte was made, to make their comming into the Realme, (to disswade subiectes from their allegiance) to be treason.

A fit punishment, for Popish and all other cruel persecutors, that they shold one slaughter another, til they be bathed in their own bloods, as hapned to the Midianites in the Iudges; and to Papists also, as Stories witnesse. Reuel. 16, 6. Thou hast giuen them blood to drinke. This Phrase, seemeth to be fetched from Ezek. 16, 38. I will giue thee the blood of wrath; that is, I will cause thee be cruelly slaine, as they which are killed in furie and wrath.

                        This Prophesie, or Booke of Reuelation (as appeareth

by the opening the seales of this Some think this Booke to be the whole Bible: others thinke it to be the New Testament, but they do erre. Booke heere shewed Iohn in a Vision) containing the Decrees, Counsels, and will of God the Father, touching the Gouernment of the world; namely, of his Church till Christ come. Whereas these counsels are written in a Book, it signifieth the certainty of them, that they are surely determined: And whereas the Booke was written within & without, (after the fashion of writing in Parchments, vsuall in those times) it signifieth, the largenesse of this Prophesie, that there be many things to be reuealed. And whereas, it is sealed with seauen seales, it signifyeth these Decrees, only to bee knowne to God, vntill he was pleased to manifest them: And whereas no creature was able to open the Booke, or to looke on it; this signifies both the difficulties and dignity of these secrets, that they must be with great honour reuerenced. Reuel. 5, 1. I saw a Booke Written, &c.

Reuel. 10, 8. Go & take the little Booke. Also verse 9, 10. Some expound the taking of this little Booke, to bee the restoring of prophesie, or preaching the trueth vnto the Church, which is all one with the former.

                        To hide the knowledge of it in the heart, and to digest it by godly Meditation. Reuel. 10, 9 Take it and eate it vp. The effect of this Booke, should be sweetnesse (like the sweetnesse of Honey) in the mouth, but bitternesse in the belly. To knowe and beleeue it, bringes exceeding delight to the Christian minde; but the earnest desire to vent & publish it to others, the heauinesse and sorrow, for the

contemning of it, and preferring errors before it, shall be as Gawle to Gods Seruants. In this phrase there is allusion to that in Ezek. 3, 3. Ieremy 15, 16 Iob. 32.

Vpon this most firme and merciful decree of saluation to aeternall life by Christ, doth depend the election of the godly, who otherwise are not without many blots, and very foule ones too, in their Consciences, which yet are wiped out by the blood of Christ, according to Gods euerlasting loue and purpose. Reuel. 20, 12. Another Booke was opened, which was the Booke of Life. Also, Reuel. 22, 19.

Hell, for the largenesse of the place, and deepenesse of the pain suffered there, is called [Bottomlesse] & a [Pit] because it is below, in the nethermost parts of the world, a darkish vncomfortable place, like a pit or dungeon.

signifie the obscure knowledge of Christ, being yet not so fully knowne, as afterward. The former is the more receiued exposition.

Reuel. 1, 7. But commeth with Clouds, and euery eye shall see him. In this speech, there is an allusion vnto the praise of the Prophets, who thus describe the notable iudgements of God, vsing the Clouds, and all other creatures for the good of his owne, and destruction of the vngodly.

As in Acts 1. and Reuel. 1, 7. Reuel. 14, 15. Crying to him that sate on the Cloud. Some Diuines (not without great shew of reason) Interpret this Cloud heere spoken of, of ciuill powers, lifted vp as Clouds in the Aire; and him who sate on it, to be such Rulers and Princes, as Christ did vse, for the furthering of his Church, and hindering the Kingdom of Antichrist;

the reason is; because the Sonne of Man, who sate vpon this Cloud, doing all at the commaundement of the Angell, as appeareth in the wordes of this Text, cannot be Christ Iesus, who is subiect onelie to his Father, and that as hee is Mediatour. This latter exposition, seemeth for this reason, to be the better.

Reuel. 6, 2. Hee went forth Conquering, that he might ouercome.

Reue. 8, 12. And the Day was smitten. Some other, by the [Day smitten] doe vnderstand, the taking away of the gladnesse and ioy which men had in the fruition, and inioying of the light of the Gospell. These two senses, though they seeme to differ, yet they doe after a sort meete in one: the latter, being as the effect; and the former as the cause. For the darkning of the truth of God, must needs diminish the ioy of Gods people.

And his Name that sate thereon, was Death. A Metonimie of the effect for the cause. Sée the like. Reue. 18, 8. Death, beeing there put for the plague or Pestilence hapning in Rome, during the siedge thereof, as the cause of ensuing Death.
                        2 Persons, Men and Women, guilty of the sentence of the second Death; which is, aeternall torment in Hell. Reuel. 20, 14. Death and Hell shall be cast into the Lake of Fire. Others, in a good sense, doe expound it thus; after the vocation of the Iewes, there shall be no torment of Death and Hel, sauing in the burning Lake, where Death shall for euer feede vpon the Reprobate: But the first exposition is best in my iudgement.

Christ restrained, hee had no might for a thousand yeares so to preuaile. Reu. 20, 3. He should Deceiue the people no more.
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           Déepnesse of Sathan. sig:
                        Either the vaine bragging, as of some, which boasted of great and plentifull knowledge in the secrets and Mysteries of God, which yet in truth, deserued to be called no better then the deepenesse of Sathan; or else, the sleightes and subtilties of Sathan, which certaine Men presumed alone to be priuy too, and of the manner how they were to be resisted; vnder which pretence, they permitted the promiscuous and common vse of Women in the Church of Thyatira, esteeming all other Teachers as simple fellowes, in comparison of themselues. This latter exposition is very probable, but the former is more receiued. Reuel. 2, 24. Neither haue knowne the Deepenesse of Sathan as they speake.

                        Not to giue place to the punishments and threatnings of Tyrants, as by the feare thereof to be moued to forsake the truth. Reuel. 3, 8.

                        By some extraordinary iudgement to destroy, as God did the Turkish Armies, when hee powred out his wrath from Heauen vpon them, according to that which is written. Reuel. 16, 21. and Ezekiell 38, 19. Reue. 20, 9. Fire came downe from Heauen from God, and Deuoured them.

                        By feruent Prayer, and publishing the iudgements of God, to threaten and procure Gods vengeance vpon their heades, that maliciously resist the truth☞ spoken by his Witnesses. Reuel. 11, 5. If any Man will hurt them, fire proceedes out of their mouthes to Deuoure their Enemies. In this, there is an allusion vnto that which was doone by Moses. Numb. 16.

                        An egregious and notorious Calumniatour, delighting exceedingly in accusing and detracting others. Thus hath Sathan done from the beginning, accusing God to man, of Enuy.

                        The conscience and heart of Sinners, whereby Christ findes enterance into vs. Reuelations 3, 20. He stands at the Doore. According to some, [Doore] signifies all hindrances, inward and outward, to keep Christ from entering. This is a good Interpretation, because our heart is the House, rather then the Doore.
                        
                           2 An open way, meane, and passage, giuen of God to Iohn the Euangelist, that hee might see and vnderstand such deepe and hidden secrets, so shut vp in Heauen, as no humaine capacity could euer haue reached to perceiue them.

Michaell fought against the Dragon. Some other, by the Dragon, vnderstand vnrighteous and cruell Princes, assisted and strengthned by false Teachers, Corruptors of the Truth, Heretiques, &c.

Re. 17, 6. I saw the Woman Drunk with the blood of the Saints. The meaning is, that so great was her cruelty, as intemperate persons, doe not more greedily drawe in the most Delicate Wine, then shee shed the blood of Gods people.

Come and I will shew the thinges that must bee done hereafter. Secondly, such as apply these foure beasts to the foure Euangelists, do varry much.

Re. 7, 2. I saw another Angell come vp from the East. Thus the Scripture else-where, speaketh of Christ; as in the Song of Zachary. Luke 1. alluding vnto the custome

and manner of the Sun, which from the East seemeth still to arise, and ascend till it come to the midst of heauen: which some doe Interpret of Constantine, who ascended out of the East parts of the World, as Stories shew, namely Eusebius; and by whom, as a maine Instrument of God, the light of the Gospell did breake foorth, to the scattering of the mists of errours, and the enlightning of the Church after most darkesome times. This Exposition, differs heerein from the former (which is more commonly receiued) in pointing to the Minister, or Instrument; whereas the former, pointeth to the Author of such a mercy. In which case, both significations agree well; because Author and Instrument be not contrary, but subordinate one to the other.

Some other Diuines, by the Face of Christ, do vnderstand, the pure worship of Christ (as it is commaunded in his word) wherein he is to be seen and knowne of his, as cleerely and as plainely, as we may know any one by his Face. And touching this interpretation, the very truth is, that the Scriptures

by the Face of God, do often signifie his worship; therefore Caine beeing separate from Gods publike worship, is said to be hid from Gods Face. Gene. 4, 14. And to goe out from the presence of the Lord. Ver. 16. Againe, the imploying of our selues in Gods worship, is called in the Psalmes, the seeking of his Face. Psalme 27, 8. Psalme 156, 2.

to be pulled downe, loosing by little and little their riches, glory, strength, credit of Religion, and holinesse, which made them honoured, followed and feared of Kinges and Nations, and for the vndoubted truth hereof. Therefore (as if it were down and fallen already) the Holy Ghost in the present time, saith; It is Fallen; yea, doubleth it (to note the certainty and greatnesse of the Fall) saying the second time, It is Fallen. And because all men should take knowledge, beleeue, and marke the better, Gods rare iudgement vppon Romish Babylon, therefore her Fall is proclaimed by an Angell from Heauen, and with a mighty loud voyce. The euent of which Prophesie, as in a good part we haue seene alreadie fulfilled, in the decay of their religious Houses, of their reuennues, and falling of many Kinges and people from that Whorish Sinagogue, through the Doctrine of the Gospell: so the full Fall draweth on apace, God hasten it.

Reue. 11, 11. And great Feare shall come vppon them who see them. Others, referre this to the daies of Caluin, Martyr, Bucer, Wicklisse, Husse, &c. who so stoutly maintained that truth against Anti-christ, which others before (guided by the same Spirit, and were now dead) had now done, as it caused the friends of Antichrist much to feare.

All this is represented by the mettall of Brasse, Fine burning, &c. Reuel. 1, 15. His Feete like to Fine Brasse, burning as in a furnace, &c. Other do interpret these Feete of Brasse, of the stablenesse of the Churches; Namely, of Smyrna and Pergamus, firmely and with inuincible constancy, abyding afflictions for the Name of Christ, when they were not onely, not hurt, but did shine more brightly like Fine Brasse; As if allusion heerein were made, to those visions of Ezekiell, ch. 1, 7. and of Daniell. Ch. 10, 6. both these Interpretations may well stand together, for the perseuerance of the Church in tribulations; and their being more purifyed by their afflictions, may & doth proceede from Christ his inuincible power, supporting them, and exceeding purity communicated to them.

Reuel. 9, 13. I heard a voice from the Foure hornes of the Golden Altar.

Leuit. 26. & heere againe distinctly mentioned; to wit, the Sworde, Famine, Pestilence, and wilde Beasts. Rom. 6, 8.

In the number of 24. there is an allusion vnto that distribution of Sacred Offices, and the Seruants of the King, mentioned in the 1. Chron. 24, 25, 26, 27. Chapters. Reuel. 4, 4. Vpon the seats I saw Foure & twenty Elders sitting. Whereas some, by 24. Elders, vnderstand the 12. Prophets, and the 12. Apostles. It cannot stand with the scope of this Vision heere shewed to Iohn, which respects not any number or company which were past and gone; but rather, which was to come, euen the whole number of beleeuing Gentiles, which as Kings & Princes should Minister to God their Soueraigne King.

                        2 The vengeance, which Christ as King and Conqueror will take vpon the Beast, and vpon the Kings of the Earth which take his part. This is represented by this bloody Garment, wherein there is an alluding to that ancient figure in Esay. Chapt. 63. Where Christ is brought forth with his Garments dipped in blood, hauing made slaughter of the Enemies of the Church. Fearefull is the end of Christ his Enemies. Reuel. 19, 13. He was cloathed with a Garment dipt in blood. Some expound this Garment of Christ, his Humaine Nature, wherein by his blood-shed he reconciled the elect to God. But the former signification agreeth best with the Text.

Re. 1, 13 He was clothed with a Garment down to his feet. Some expound this of the purity and innocency of that Priest-hoode, which Christ did exercise for his Church. Others, of the venerable Dignity and Maiesty of Christ, as King of his Church; and indeede, Kinges did weare long Robes in token of Maiesty. Also, Priests by Gods appoiniment. But

the first Exposition I hold best, we often find Christ his imputed Iustice, compared to a Garment. Psal. 32, 1. Math. 22, 12. And Reu. 16, 15.

Reu. 16, 15. Blessed is he that watcheth and keeps his Garments.

                        To bring such as were farre scattered asunder, into one place, eyther to make Warre, or Arme them against the people of God. As Reuel. 20, 8. Gather them together to battell: Or else, to helpe to effect and worke the worthy and most deserued destruction of the Enemies of Gods people, which fight for the Beast, and to take their part in the prey. Reuel. 19, 17. Come and Gather together your selues vnto the Supper, &c.

                           to giue glory to God. sig:
                        To glorify God, by renouncing Idols, superstitious vices, and errors, and to turne to the Creatour of the World, to confesse and worshippe him after his owne will. This fruit, is knowne to haue followed vpon some great plague, inflicted and sent to the Antichristian rout. Reuel. 11, 13. The remnant were sore feared, and gaue glory to the God of heauen. Reu. 16, 9. And they repented not to Giue glory to God.

godly, according to mercy: or out of Iustice, to render euill vnto the vngodly. Reuel. 22, 6. I will Giue to, &c. And Chap. 22, 12. To Giue, &c.

                           Glory of God. sig:
                        His glorious presence, testified by some visible signe like vnto that. Exod. 40, 34, 35. Reue. 15, 8. And the Temple was full of the smoake of the Glory of God. The presence of God in and with his Church, now vnder the Gospell, though it bee with more brightnesse of knowledge, and more plentifull graces then it was vnder the Law; yet it is obscure, in respect of that Reuelation which the Saintes shall enioy in Heauen. With all, this smoake of Gods Glory in the Temple, may import, that howsoeuer Gods glorious presence with his Church, nowe be manifest enough; yet the wicked cannot see it, as if their eye-sight were darkened with smoake; which lastly may shew forth his anger (vsually signified in Scripture by Smoake) against such Enemies.
                        2 The brightnesse of God (or Diuine brightnesse) immediately communicated vnto the Saints in Heauen, who shall haue so exceeding great light from the most perfit presence of God, and Christ the Lambe, as they shal need, neither Sun, Moone, or Starre. Reuel. 21, 23. For the Glory of God did light it. Also verse 11. Hauing the Glory of God; that is, most admirable, Diuine, and Caelestiall Glory. Some do so vnderstand this, of a most glorious Diuine brightnesse of Gods presence, as withal, they restraine it to the Ages of the Church, which shall be next afore the end of the World. Both may bee vnderstood; the one, as a fore-runner and preparation

to the other.

                        To set forth the Glory of Gods great Name, by acknowledging and praysing his Iustice, in his vengeance vppon the wicked, and his exceeding loue and benignity toward the Saintes. Reuel. 15, 4. Who woulde not feare thee, and Glorifie thy great Name.

Other Authours, referre Gog and Magog, to the Turkes and Persians, and such Regions as are at their commaund.

Reuel. 19, 1. Saying Halleluia. The cause of receiuing these Haebrew words in Scripture (as Osanna, Abba, Amen, Alleluia, &c. It is, to be as signes and Tokens of

that coniunction, which beleeuing Gentiles haue, with the holy Nation of the Iewes, to whom there is but one God, and one Religion.

The reason why the Church reformed heere on earth, is called [Heauen,] is, because of that Heauen (which is the seate and habitation of the Saints.) There is no more liuely Image and Picture heere in earth, then the vniuersall Company of Saintes, which is the true militant Church of Christ.

Some Interpreters, which thinke this Chapter, to giue (not a description of Heauen, the seat of the blessed, shewing what shall be the happinesse of the Saints, after the Resurrection and Iudgement) but of the Church which shall be on earth, a little afore the Iudgement, when the Iewes shall be restored to the Communion of Saints, do interpret New heauens, of the most pure way of worshipping God, and the New Earth, to signifye a new people; in whose assemblies God will be honoured. Let the learned Iudge which signification is fittest, for both are true.

                        The Graue, which is the companion of Death, or the estate which followes after Death; both the Greeke word signifies Graue, and the matter requires this sense. For many Saints were to dye amongst others, but it were wickednesse to thinke the Saints to be deuoured of the Hell of the damned. Reuel. 6, 8. And Hell followed after him. Reue. 20, 13. Death and Hell deliuered vp their Dead. Also, verse 14. If heere we should vnderstand Hell for the place of the damned, it would be absurd to say; That Hell was cast into the burning Lake, That were to say; Hell was cast into Hell.

Therefore, the Ministers of the Gospell, which speedily spread the pure word of God in the time of Traianus the Emperour and his Successours, be signified by the White Horse.

This is a Name of Supreame Maiesty and gouernment, written in Christ his Garment, to manifest vnto all, that he is aboue all: and in his Thigh, to signifie, that which may bee thought lowest, least, and meanest in Christ (this most mighty King) to be higher then the greatest height & dignity which is in earth. This Soueraigne Empire of Christ, (whereof we read. Dani. 2, 44, 45.) shall appeare far more gloriously in the latter ages of the church, by subduing his Enemies, and protecting and purging his Church, then euer it did in former Ages.

The sixt was of Caesars or Emperours, who gouerned Rome when Iohn wrote the Apocalipse; therefore he saith: One is. Verse 10. The seauenth was of the Pope, of which he saith in the same verse; Another which is not come, &c. because the Pope raigned not in Rome, til a good while after the death of S. Iohn. Here then is a plaine description of Rome, to be the seat of the Beast, euen of that great Antichrist; no other Citty in the Worlde▪ hauing seauen Hils, and seauen kindes of gouernment successiuely, sauing the Citty of Rome. Reue. 17, 10. They are also seauen Kinges. Such then are deceiued, as doe thinke, by these seauen Kings to bee meant, eyther the first seauen Kinges, who in the beginning did sway the Scepter in Rome, or the seauen Electors of the Empire: The former were past; and the latter remaine all still. Or they, who restraine it to seauen seuerall & singular persons; which should be, Galba, Otho, Uitellius, Uespatianus, Titus, Domitianus, and Nerua: All which were Emperours of Rome, betweene Nero and Traianus. But of all other, they most erre, who interpret these seauen Kinges (as Ribera the Iesuite, and Claudius, a Fryar Carmelite of Paris doe) of seauen ages of the World, whereof, fiue should bee expired at the first comming of our Lorde, the sixt should last from thence to the comming of Anti-christ: And the seauenth from thence to the end of the World. This to be reiected as a Popish dreame, fitting these seauen heades to any Citty in the World; whereas the holy Ghost purposed heere, to giue an euident note, to know where the Throne of the Beast (that is, Anti-christ) should be.

(the tyranical enemies there of being extinct, which delighted to glut themselues with the blood of the Saintes) and godly Kinges set vp, to gouerne his people in his waies. Reuel. 12, 10.

                        Heathenish Kings, conuerted to Christ, who after a sort, maketh his royall Maiesty visible in such godly kings, framing their harts so, as to cause them to cast down their Crowns and Scepters at Christs feete; and both in themselues and their subiects, to study chiefely how to promote his glory. Thus Christ raigned by Constantine the Great, and other godly Emperors of old time: and of late, by sundry worthy and religious Princes, in Germany, England, Scotland, Poland, and Denmarke. Reue. 11, 15. The Kingdomes of this world are our Lords, and his Christs, who shall raigne for euermore.

To be cast into this Lake, is to be adiudged to most grieuous damnation and paine there, by an vnrecouerable sentence. This shall be done, as a most iust reward to Antichristian doctrine and tyranny, which shall be most seuerely punnished without any hope of recouery, eyther for the Papacy it selfe, or the men, which embraced it and fought so fiercely for it. For out of Hell no redemption. Reuel. 19, 20. These both were cast aliue into a Lake of fire burning, &c.

Called to the supper of the marriage of the Lamb. Some vnderstand this, to belong to the time of the calling of the Iewes, which shall be afore Christ his comming to Iudgement, in which calling, they shall not refuse vpon vaine excuses, as at first. Math. 22. But at the first hearing (through the most effectuall grace of Christ) they shall very readily obey the doctrine of Faith, wherein they shall ioyntly delight themselues, as men which sit together at a great Supper,

which beeing in the Euening and end of the day, dooth signifie: that this calling of the Iewes, shall be in the Euening and end of the World, as a forerunner and representation of the great Supper, which the Church and Christ shall haue together in Heauen. This Exposition is not rashly to be reiected.

Also, that Romish Rabble be most hatefull to true Christian men, not being able to endure the Image of such, (being adorers of all other Images:) They are swift to mischiefe, vsing not more celerity in effecting cruelty, then they do subtilty in contriuing it, entising many thousands into their snares, by a kind of venerable Maiesty, and counterfeit piety. Finally, they bee rauenous as Beares, proud, stout, and intollerably insolent, and sauage with all, as Lyons, hauing (to be short) al such immanities and deformities in them alone, as Dan. 7, 4, 5, 6.

This Beast was like a Leopard, his Feete like a Beare, and his mouth was like the Mouth of a Lyon. Whereas some Interpretors vnderstand this Leopard, of the Romaine Empire, ciuill, or become Christian, but tainted with corrupt errour; it dooth not so well agree, as to that Antichrist, to the corporation of the Papacy, whereof the Byshop of Rome is head and cheefe, who hath exercised, and doth practise cruelties of all sorts, wanting no kinde of spirituall nor bodily spots and filthinesse.

Gods Church, which is kept with Christ the Redeemer, out of which he took this Apocalipse. Thus Maister Iunius. Reuel. 10, 2. And he had in his hand a little Booke open.
                        
                        2 The holy Byble, which, though a large booke considered by it selfe, yet if it bee compared with the huge volumes of Popish ordinances and decrees, it is but little. Maister Gifford takes it thus.
                        3 All Diuine Mysteries, which to reueale, is in Christs power. Claudius doth thus interpret it.
                        4 All consolatarie Scripture, or Euangelicall promises, which are written in a Booke, that they might be extant to comfort Christians in all Ages; And because they lead as directly, a readie way to the Throne of grace, (through one Mediator▪) and not by long windlesses and circuits; therefore it is saide to be a little Booke. Maister Fulke expoundes it thus.
                        5 An vncertaine woorke, or Booke, written very anciently, touching the estate of latter times; affirming, that as the doctrine of grace was preached, first to the Iewes; then to the Greekes; and lastly, to the Latines: so contrariwise, it should returne, from Latines to the Greekes, and so backe againe to the Haebrewes, whence it first came; saith an vnknowne Authour.
                        6 The slender, meane and weake knowledge of diuine truth giuen to some one certaine Age, whereof Iohn speakes. Maister Bright-man takes it thus. Let godly Readers take what sense of these they shall thinke meetest, I most encline to Maister Giffords Exposition. That the holy Byble, which long had been shut vp from the people, by the craft and malice of Antichrist, should at length be cleerly knowne to the people.

In which time the Deuill let loose, did deceiue the World with abhominable superstition, Idolatry, wicked errours, and such strong delusions, as was wonderfull. Reue. 20, 3.

So the followers of Antichrist are Markable and knowne by some externall signe and Ceremonie; but what this Marke is, Diuines doo not all agree. Some, will haue the Marke to be, the profession to be a Member of the Latine Church, or Roman Church. Some, the Chrisme in the Sacrament of Confirmation. Some say, the Marke to be all one with the name of the Beast. But I like best of them, which thinke, that the Beast had sundrie Markes, where-with he branded his worshippers; because we see in the Text, the Marke, the Name of the Beast, and the Number of his name, distinguished

by the Holy-Ghost. And it is known by experience, that some were more neerely Marked to the Pope, and with a more speciall brand, then others were. For, Emperors, Kinges, and other great men of the earth, were obliged to the Pope, by the Marke of a solemne oath, promising & b

Thus, of these three signes, the Carracter or Marke of the beast, belongs to the Princes and Cleargy, as vnto Sonnes; his name, vnto the people and vulgar sort, as vnto his Slaues; and the number of his name vnto the Graecians, as vnto straungers.

Some vnderstand this, of hauing their forehead and hand signed with their Chrisme in Confirmation; or with their greasie Oyntment.

Some Interpreters

thinke, that the name of the Woman is called a Mystery, because her Description is set downe in a figuratiue speech, and not in playne tearmes: And this doth well agree with the former significations. They are deceiued therefore, which read mystery with a great Caracter, as if [Mystery] were the name of a woman; whereas it shewes out the condition of her name, that it is secret and remooued from common, vnderstanding, needing Interpretation.

The Mystery of God shall be finished. Some, by this Mysterie, vnderstand the Doctrine of the last Iudgement, touching the rewarding of good and euill. Others, the whole Doctrine of the glorious Redemption of the Church of Christ; which things, because none comprehend, so as they shall be, are therefore called Mysteries. But I preferre the first signification.

For Heathenish Rome, which Papists would haue to be this [Mother,] did not put her superstitions vppon other Citties and Countries which they conquered, but left them to their owne Religion, neither were their superstitions any Mysteries.

A great Mountaine burning with Fire was cast into the Sea. It is vsuall in Scripture by Mountaines, to describe mightie Kingdoms, Empires, & Principalities; Also haughty and high-minded Princes, as in I say 2, 14, 15. To what kingdome dooth this so fitly agree, as to that proud kingdome of Antichrist, aduauncing it

Therefore the Papistes cannot auoide, but the seat of Antichrist, of the Beast and the Whore, is at Rome; there being no Citty in the world, that was known to be scituated vpon seuen hils when the Apostles wrote this Booke, neither more nor fewer. Reuel. 17, 9. The seauen Heads are seauen Mountaines. In S. Iohns time, of all Citties in the world, Rome onely was built on seuen hils; it only raigned ouer the Kings of the earth; it onely had seuen formes of gouernment; it onely compelled other people to their Idolatry; and such a Citty must be the seate of the Whore.

A plentifull proofe of these blasphemies, is extant, in one Bull of Leo the tenth against Luther.

particular person, but Nomen Gentile (as it is called of Grammarians) the Name of Nation or Country, passing from the head to the rest of the people.

                        A Name, consisting of so many, and such Numerall Letters, as beeing counted and summed vp, doe make the Number of 666. which is the Number of the Beast: both the first Beast; (to wit, the Romaine Emperour and Empire) and the second Beast; (to wit, the Romain Pope and Papacy) for vnder the Beast is comprehended no one particular Man, but an order and succession of Men, euen a Kingdome. Irenaeus, who liued neere the Apostles time (hauing seene and heard Polycarpus, who was one of the Disciples of Saint Iohn, the Pen man of the Apocalipse) doth report, that before this time, this Name (out of whose Numerall Letters, should arise 666.) was

                           , and hee himselfe iudged it likely to be so indeede; because (saith he) the most true Kingdome hath that name. For they be Latines which now doe raigne, as hee writeth. Lib. 5. Cap. 29. Aduersùs Haereses.

                           nomen sex centorum sexaginta sex Numerum continet. Now the Pope is head of the Latine Church, as the Emperour was of the Latine Empire. Therefore, if the Emperour with his Empire (by Irenaeus indgement) might be called Latinos; much more the Popedome and the Pope; who is so much a Latine, as hee will allow no exercise of Religion but in Latine. He compels all to pray in Latine. He hath the Bible of the Latine Translation, which he prefers before the Byble written in the Haebrew and Greeke tongues, by the Prophets and Apostles. His Lawes, decrees, and people, are all Latine. His Church Latine, and all condemned as Schismaticks which will not bee subiect to his Latine Law, and his Latine Faith.

First▪ because the Name here spoken of, was such, as wise men might finde, and it was a Name which then might bee found, when Saint Iohn wrote (else in vaine had an Exhortation beene to study and search it, had there beene no hope to finde it.) Also, by Irenaeus himselfe, and afore him, it was receiued by common consent. Lastly, the Greek Letters of this Name being Numbred, amounteth to 666. as may be perceiued in this which followeth.

I will make him a Pillar in the Temple of God. Some thinke, that this place hath allusion and respect vnto those two Pillars, placed by Salomon in the Temple, to represent the stability of the Sonnes of God. Others do iudge, that heere is an allusion vnto the fashion of such Countries, where Pillars and Statues with inscriptions vppon them, by way of gratefulnesse to the honour of such as were Captaines in war, and

returned home Conquerors, as vsed to bee done at Rome, in foro & campo Martio. Howsoeuer this be, the meaning comes all to one passe; to note the great soliditie and vnmooueable estate of Gods children.

Neither was their place found any more in Heauen. Some referre this victory ouer Satan, to the time of Christ his passion, whereuppon it did depend. Others, to the time of Constantine the great, whom Christ vsed as an Instrument, to procure a victory ouer the enemies of his Church, which vpon the gate of his pallace, hee represented by the picture of a Dragon lying vnder his feete, with a Dart thrust thorow him.

The Angell of the Waters. Angels being for this purpose, tearmed principalities, Powers, and Dominations; because to them is committed, of God, the ordering and conseruation of the Creatures. Reuel. 14, 18. An Angell which hath Power ouer the Fire. Some expound this, of Christ, who is said to come, to send Fire into the Earth. Some, that the Angell should execute Gods vengeance vppon the bloody Kingdome of Antichrist, with fiery and feruent affection. But others, more probably, yet vnderstand this, of the abilitie and strength, whereby some Martyr should beare and ouercome the violence of the fire (which is to haue power ouer the Fire) applying it to Thomas Cranmer, sometime Arch-Bishop of Canterburie, who not onely gaue his body to be burned of the fire, for the truth, but also first suffered his right hand to be first deuoured, by which he had subscribed against the truth, and thus had he Power ouer the fire.

These are here called Nations and Gentiles,

(all Gentiles sincerely professing Christ, beeing reckoned for Israelites.) Reuel. 2, 26. I will giue them power ouer the Nations.

                        The largenesse of Antichrists iurisdiction, that he should stretch his Throne farre and wide, euen into all the World, as verse 3.

Howbeit, some expound these words more Mystically (not vnprobably this Booke beeing so mysticall) for power, to turne the truth into lies and errors, as Aegiptian waters were changed into blood. Reuel. 11, 6. And haue power ouer waters, to turne them into blood. See
                            Reue. 8, 8. The third part of Water turned blood; that is, the sound doctrine corrupted, being turned into a degenerous Nature.

And he set his right foote on the Sea, and his left vppon the Earth.

                           ONE, full of outward pomp & earthly glory, and magnificence, challenging to her selfe power and authority (as a Queene.) Thus doth the Church of Rome, proudly boasting herselfe to bee the Mother-Church, the head of Christianity, and to haue primacy ouer all other Churches, and many other like Thrassonicall Blasphemies. Reu. 18, 7. I sit being a Queene.

                           TO rule, not for a small time, but for euer; in those Kingdomes, which in these latter daies, afore Christs comming, shall receiue the sincere profession of his truth. Reuel. 11, 15. Who shall Raigne for euermore. And Reuel. 22, 5. These words teach, that the Kingdom of Saints begun in earth, shall neuer be broken off, but continue still in heauen.
                     
                     
                        
                           to Raigne a thousand yeares. sig:
                        To rule by the Scepter of the worde among the Gentiles, for a great continuance of time, according as we haue seene it come to passe in these our Regions and Contries. Reuel. 20, 6. And shall Raign with him a thousand yeares. These words, must not be vnderstoode of the eternall blisse, wherein the Saints shall raigne in heauen, but of the Raigne of the faithfull heere in earth, for the space of those thousand yeares in which Satan should be bound, that the Gospell might flourish. Some Interpretors, will haue this thousand yeares of Satans binding, to begin when Christ first preached the gospel. Others, at the death of Christ; others, at the time when the Apostles were dispersed, and gathered Churches to Christ in all parts of the world. But all these coniectures are crossed by the first verse of the 4. Chap: which teacheth, that the whole Prophesy (from the fourth chapter forward) doth respect the yeares, which followed the age and time of Iohn the Euangelist, which wrote this Prophesie. But heereof,

more in the word [A thousand yeares.]
                     
                     
                        
                           to Raigne vpon earth. sig:
                        To be made Lords and Kinges ouer earth and heauen (as all the faithfull are by Christ) thorough whom, they shall Raigne in heauenly glory at last, and in meane time, while they are in earth, though they be in warfare, yet they are Kings, hauing Hel, Sinne, Satan, and Death, subdued to them; and al things in this worlde subiect and put vnder them. Sée Col. 2. Psal. 8. Reu. 5, 10. And we shal Raigne on the earth.
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           to Raigne ouer the Kinges of the earth. sig:
                        To rule and exercise Dominion and Empyre, aboue and ouer the cheefest of mortall men, ouer earthly Kings and Monarches. Now, because Rome onely, at that time, when Iohn wrote, had power ouer the great Kings of the earth, and the great Antichrist must sit and Raigne in that Citty, where the Heathen persecuting Emperours were: Hence it clearely appeareth, that Rome is the gorgious and filthie Whore spoken of in the Reuelation. Reuel. 17, 18. The Woman which thou sawest, is that great Citty, which Raigneth ouer the Kings of the earth. Papistes are deceiued, which interpret this Citty of the vniuersalitie of the wicked in the world.
                     
                     
                        
                           Raine-bow vpon his head. sig:
                        That Testimonie or Sacrament, which was betweene God and man, of his Couenant, touching the destroying of the worlde by water: Whereas Christ had this Rainbow about his head, it serueth to testifie, not onely his Fidelitie in keeping promise, but his mercie also, towarde his faithfull seruants, in chasing away stormes, and clearing the boisterous skie, making calme, and giuing rest after heauie times and tempestuous. Reuel. 10. 1. And a Rainbow vpon his head.
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           to be Rauished in the Spirit. sig:
                        To be moued and led by a sweet holy motion of the Spirit, to see and vnderstand hidden things, far exceeding humaine capacity and wit. Reuel. 1 10. And I was Rauished in the Spirite on the Lordes day.
                           
Thus the ancient Prophets, thus Paule, 2. Cor. 12. were made fit and capable of heauenly visions, euen as Iohn is heere, hauing the Spirit for his guide and teacher.

                        Such, as thorow weakenesse and sinfull infirmities, are likely and neere (without timely and diligent looking too) to fall into the destruction of death. Reuel. 3, 2. Strengthen the things which are readie to die.

                        One, being in trauell neere vnto Child-birth. Reuel. 12, 2. And was pained, Ready to be deliuered. Some expound this, both of the Virgin Mary (that blessed woman, the Mother of Christ;) Also, of the Church of the Iewes, who by their vehement and seruent desire & expectation of the Messiah, were after a sort in paine and trauell, to bring him forth. This is a godly sence, but because in the first verse of the 4. Chapter of this Booke, Iohn sheweth, that not things past before, but things to be done after, were the subiect of this Prophesie, from the thirde Chapter forward. Therefore, their exposition is more fit, who interpret it of the Christian Church, labouring and groaning vnder the cruelty of Heathenish persecuters, being pained with greefe, to see some one of her Children, which might be a Defender of her against such iniuries. And this happened, when Constantine the great raigned, & put an end (at least a great stop) to the bloody proceeding of the Roman Emperors.

                        An Instrument wherewith to meete or measure a thing withall; and because things are not measured, but for repayring and building vp, and not to throw them downe; Therefore, the further restoring of the Church, is signifyed, by measuring the Temple with a Reed. Reu. 11, 1. Then was giuen me a Reede, like a Rod, &c. This place hath respect to

                           Ezek. 40. Zach. 1. where the building and restoring of the Church, is signified by measuring.

                        To cut downe Corne at the time of ripenesse, which we commonly call Haruest.
                        2 To abrogate and abolish, the wicked Idolatrous worship in this world, by such Instruments as God ordained to doo it in his due time, and by his sonne Christ to Iudge and destroy the vngodly at his second comming to Iudgement, when the wickednesse of the world will be fully ripe. Reuel. 14, 15. Thrust in thy sickle and Reap, for the time is come to Reape.
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           to Receyue the Beasts marke in the forehead and hand. sig:
                        To consent to the Authority of Antichrist, and to Antichristian worship, either secretly in heart, or by outward profession of mouth, and by participation in externall Ceremonies; whether it be by vulgar persons of the Comminalty, barely professing it, or by Princes and Prelates with their hand and power maintaining it also. Reuel. 14, 9. If any man worship the Beast and his Image, receiuing his marke in his forehead or hand, &c.

                        To yeeld subiection to Antichrist, and to testifie it by any note. Reuel. 14, 11. And whosoeuer receiue the print of his name.

                           to Reioyce euer them. sig:
                        To make common mirth and ioy among themselues, because the true Prophets of God beeing slaine (which were woont to vexe and trouble the members of the false Church, with their wholsom interpretations of Scriptures, and sound reproofe of errors and vices) the wicked Antichristian crew might now make merry, being eased of that yoke, and depending onely vpon the Popes pleasure, for sense of Scriptures. Reuel. 11, 10. And they that dwell on the earth, shall Reioyce ouer them, and bee glad.
                        
                     
                     
                        
                        
                           to Reioyce and be glad. sig:
                        To conceiue sweete comfort and gladnesse, for the accesse of the Iewes (so long diuorced) vnto the bodie of the Church, and for the neere approch of Christ to iudgement, when he will take his spouse (consisting of beleeuing Gentiles and Iewes) into a most neere society in heauen. Reuel. 19, 7. Let vs Reioyce.

                        That little portion of graces, which was left in the Pastor of Sardis, and in his flocke. Reuelat. 3, 2. Strengthen the things which remaine.
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           to come in Rememberance before God. sig:
                        To execute, either some promised mercie, or some decreed and threatned Iudgement, as heere. For as God seemeth forgetfull, whilst he defers the punishment of wicked men; so his taking Reuenge (as heere he threatned to do vpon Constantinople the Turkish Babylon) is called his Rememberance. Reuel. 16, 19. And that great Babylon came in Remembrance afore God. Also Chap. 18, 5. And God hath Remembred her iniquities.

                        So many men as were left aliue, and not slaine by the former Calamities mentioned, in verses 16, 17, 18, 19. Reuel. 9, 20. And the Remnant of Men. Also Reuel. 19, 21. The Remnant were slaine with the sword.

                        The rest of the saithfull, which beeing scattered abroad by the iniquity of the time, cannot publickly assemble to worship God, but priuately (as they can) do exercise piety. Reuel. 12, 17. And made war with the Remnant of her seed.

                        To be truly touched with godly greefe for sins, & to turne vnto God to do his will. Reue. 9, 20. And they repented not of the workes of their handes. Also, Reuel. 16, 9. They Repented not to giue him glorie; that is, howsoeuer they made a shew of Repentance whilst God scourged them, yet they did not leaue their sinne, and amend their liues.

bound, were drowned in ignorance & superstition, being fallen deadly asleepe in their sinnes. Reuel. 20, 5. The Rest of the dead shall not liue againe, till the thousand yeares be finished.

                        2 A manifestation and discouery of Diuine thinges, secret, in respect of men, for the common good of the Church. Reuel. 1, 1: The Reuelation of Iesus Christ. This Title of [Reuelation] being giuen to this Booke of Iohn and to the whole gospel of God. Math. 11, 25. teacheth vs, that the search and vnderstanding of them, doth as farre exceed all mortall wit, as the knowledge of thinges to come till they be opened; or things till they be couered; or darke Riddles till they be declared.
                     
                     
                        
                           to Reuenge sig:
                        To take punishment at last vpon the great whore the Romish Church, which had so long with impurity vexed the Saints, to whom this shoulde bee a great matter and occasion of ioy. Reuel. 18, 20. Reioyce, for God hath punished her, to bee Reuenged on her for your sake.
                        
                     
                     
                        
                           to Reward. sig:
                        To returne and repay ertreame ignomy & paine, or vexation vnto the Antichristian crew & Popish Babylonish rout, in lieu and recompence of all that vexation and iniury, which either by entisement to their sinnes, or by inflicting torment vpon such as refused to submit to them, they had most wickedly offered to the Saints. Reuel. 18, 6. Reward her as
                           
                           she hath Rewarded you. It is worth our noting, that this charge is giuen to such as before were bidde come out of Babylon, verse 4. euen to such as had beene the Cittizens of Rome, members of the Papacy, that they should be the Ministers of this punishment & reuenge, being likely to do that more thorowly, through the fresh remembrance of their late oppressions. What may we think of them, who are so fauourable and indulgent to this Citty, that great Whore, as to winke at her sinnes, not to execute sharpe wrath against them, not to thinke of ruining, but to attempt the reforming of that desperate Strumpet?

                        One, who indeed is endued with spirituall store and plenty of heauenly things. Reuel. 2, 9. I knowe thy pouertie, but thou art Rich. This riches is in two things; First, in assurance of forgiuenesse of sinnes, reconciliation with God, and eternall life. 2 Cor. 8, 9. Secondly, in hauing grace to do Good-workes. 1 Tim. 6, 18.
                        2 One, presuming of aboundance of spirituall graces, which in truth they haue not at all; or not in such measure as they suppose. Reuel. 3, 17. Thou saist I am Rich. This was a presumption in the heart of Laodiceans of spirituall riches, vpon occasion of their great earthly wealth, wherein they did ouer-flow.

                        The powerful regiment and gouernment which Christ hath & exerciseth in matters of the Church, to hold the Stars in this his hand, signifies, to giue the Ministers of the word, protection and defence, while they be faithfull. Reuel. 1, 16. And hee had in his Right hand seauen Starres.

Reuel. 22, 12. He that is Righteous, let him be righteous still.

                        The washing away of sinnes by the bloude of Christ, with the imputation of his perfect obedience, to be our Righteousnesse; whereof seeing we giue declaration to the world, by such good-works as come from the Spirite of sanctification, as wee haue an inwarde Testimony of it before God by Faith; therefore, it is in the Plurall number saide, Righteousnesse or Iustifications of the Saints. Reu. 19, 8. For the fine Linnen is the Righteousnesse of the Saints. See Reuel. 7, 13. These places euidently shew, that the Iustification of the elect, is not from within themselues, but sticketh without in that externall garment, Christ Iesus, whom they put on by faith, whereof their Good-workes be fruits.

                        To take beginning out of the tempestuous and troublesome estate of the Nations; out of which, (as it were out of a Sea) did spring at the first the Roman Empire, which stories proue, to haue grown from the diuisions of kingdomes. Reuel. 13, 1. I saw
                           
                           a beast arise out of the Sea. Note, that out of the sea of corrupt Doctrine, and the Cleargy which at that time taught it, did spring the other beast, the Romish Bishop and his Hierarchie, which for cruelty and violence, is likened to a Beast, as the Romaine Heathenish Empire, for like respect, is compared to a beast.

And it fell into the third part of the Riuers, and into the Fountains of water. Reu. 16, 4. where, be signified by Riuers, not ordinary Teachers, but principall ones (as Iesuites in Popery) vppon whose mouth the multitude depend in matter of Doctrine.

                        2 The power and force, where-with Rome, (which is Babylon mystically, and in a figure) doth defend it selfe. Reuel. 9, 14. Which are bounde in the great Riuer Euphrates. Some do vnderstande this Euphrates, of a famous Riuer in Armenia, and will haue the binding of the foure Angels there, to bee meant (not of Popish force) where the Diuell lay bound, waiting by the power of that Cittie to doo much mischiefe) but of the Turkish Armie▪ driuen through feare, to reside neare that flood of Armenia (called Euphrates) and for a time shut vp in prison (as it were) and kept in fetters. Of this, let the learned Iudge; the former, I haue allowed as the more receiued exposition.

Reuel. 22, 1. And he shewed me a pure Riuer of the Water of life.

Reuel. 12, 10. In Heauen there is Saluation wrought, &c. This is the Song of victory, which the Church and multitude of Saints on earth, sing to Gods▪ praise, like to that in Exod. 15, 1, 2. &c.

Reuel. 12, 10. And I stood on the Sea-Sand. Some Interpretors suppose, they haue espied a farther Mysterie in this Sea-Sand, which signifies (as they deeme) the truth of doctrine, which is as a shore or Sand, whence to behold the arising and off-spring of that Beast after spoken of, being

Reue. 4, 6. Before the Throne was a Sea of Glasse like to Christall. Others, by the Sea of Glasse (in this place) vnderstand the fulnesse of all guifts, which the Church draweth from Christ, by an allusion, to that large spacious vessell, called the Sea. 1 Kings 7, 23. But that was of Brasse, this of Glasse; to signifie the difference betweene the Gospell, and the Legall Rites and Ceremonies, vnder which there was great obscurity, in comparison of that cleerenesse

which is vnder the Gospell. 2. Cor. 3, 13, 18.

Reuel. 8, 8. A great Mountaine of Fire was cast into the Sea. Others, by Sea in this place, and Reu. 7, 1. do vnderstand, the Doctrine of the false Church, being corrupt and troubled; This is said here, to bee turned into blood, being pure and sound (such as the Doctrine of the true Church is;) It is by false Prophets changed into a quite other nature, as a thing degenerate. In this sence also, some expound the word [Sea] in Chapter. 21, 1. For degenerate and corrupt Doctrine, which in that renewed age there prophesed of, shall haue no place.

not plainely, (yet so plainely as the wisedome of Man may count it) was, because it had beene dangerous at that time (when the Romaine Empire, which was this Beast, flourished) to haue published it, and openly laide it forth. Therefore, to auoyde vnnecessary offence, as also, that worldlings, which must fulfil this prophesie, might not see it; for these causes the Name is obscurely put downe.

As the sound of Thunder, signifies a noise more distinct and dreadfull, which yet lasted not long; and the voice of Harpers, signifies the sweet voice of truth, fully restored; and in the Harmony of Confessions, by seuerall Churches sung to the world. Thus was the progresse of the Church of Christ. Reuel. 14, 2. As the Sound of many waters.

It is an allusion to the Diabolicall practises of Idolaters, whereby they caused their Idols to speake distinctly (as if they had beene aliue) the more easilie to bring men to admire their superstition. So the Pope hauing nowe raysed him-selfe to the estimation (wel-nie) of a God, was no more, as a dead person, but began to speake, to command, to forbid, to blesse, to curse, to boast and bragge themselues, Lord of Kings and Emperors, as Pope Adrian did, when he saide; By vs the Emperor raigneth.

The Testimony of Iesus is the Spirite of prophesie; that is, such as testifie of Christ, by prophesying him, or preaching him, their function is equal to the office of Angels reuealing him. Therefore Iohn may not worship the Angell, being a fellow-seruant.

This great Star, some do vnderstand, of degenerating Byshops, who thorow Pride and ambition, fell into Haeresie & Impiety. Others, do interpret it, of Constantius, Valens, & other wicked Emperors, which fauored the Arrian Haeresie, and molested Orthodox Christians.

Also, ouer mens soules and consciences, and because they pretend this double power, to bee deriued and receiued from Christ, (though indeede it be from the Dragon) euen from the Deuill of Hell. Therefore bee they called, the [Hornes of a Lamb.] Reu. 11, 13. The Beast had Two hornes, like the Lamb. Some, vnderstand these Two Hornes, of Two French Kinges; Pipinus, and Carolus Magnus, who succoured the Two Popes; Stephanus the second, and Adrian (whom they took to be Innocents, & harmlesse as Lambs) against the Kings of the Lombards: Aristulphus, & Desiderius.

Which seuerall numbers, doe note and point out one thing; to wit, that the time of the tyranny of Antichrist persecuting the Saints, is certaine, fixed and determined, which he cannot passe, and that it shall not bee very long, which greatly maketh for the consolation of the Saintes. Reuel. 11, 2. The holy Citty they shall tread vnder-foote Two and forty months. Where these months tooke theyr beginning, and where they are determined, I take not on me to iudge; certain it is, that in these forty two months, euery day is put for a yeare (as in the Prophesie of weeks by Daniell) and euery week for seauen yeare, and euery month to consist of thirtie daies, according to the Aegiptian account; And finally, that it is the whole space of time, wherein Antichrist shall arise, encrease, or waxe; be wounded, reuiue, and take heart againe, to execute his cruelty in that Citty which was the Queene of the World (as it were) where hee and his fauorites should bath themselues in pleasures. Therefore they doe erre, which doe precisely vnderstand these monethes of three yeare and a halfe, where by this number, mystically is fignified, the whole time of Antichrists raigne; which is by the former Computation, twelue hundred threescore yeares.

He swore that Tyme should bee no more. Some, translate for Tyme [Delay] and will haue the meaning to be, that there should bee a small delay, no long space of Time til the consummation of the Mystery, and then it doth not signifie the abolition of Tyme, after the consummation and ende of all; but breuity or short space of Tyme, vntill the consummation come. This latter, seemeth better to agree with the circumstances of the Text.

They had Golden Vials full of sweet Odours, which are the praiers of the Saints. These wordes, teach how pretious Vessels the hearts of true beleeuers are, and how sweete the Prayers bee which come from them, by allusion to the manner of the Temple at Hierusalem. Sée Zach. 14, 20. Psal. 141, 2.
                        2 The holy minds, not of all the faithfull, but of the true Seruants and Ministers of Christ, filled not with seruent pure Prayers onely, but with the seuere iudgements of God, which they are ready to denounce by threatning with integrity, against and vpon the Kingdome of Antichrist, and Popish worshippers; and because God is pure and holy, euen in his iudgementes threatned and executed on the wicked; Therefore, those Vials are saide to bee of Gold, and because God will be throughly auenged on his Enemies; therefore, the Vials are said to be full of wrath, which being the wrath of him who liueth for euer, amplifieth the grieuousnesse of it. Reuel. 15, 7. Seauen Golden Vials full of the wrath of God, which liueth for euermore. If the seauen Angels, spoken of in the former part of this verse, bee properly taken, not for Ministers of the word, but for Caelestiall Spirites, yet the matter is all one, that

God is decreed to execute his vengeance, silently and fully, as one would poure Water out of Vials. Note, that the first euents of Gods iudgements in this Booke, were called Seales, because they were for confirmations of the future: Then, Trumpets succeeded, to shew, that the iudgements following were not onely denounced with great noyse, but grieuouslie executed. Thirdly, Vials, which beeing capacious Vessels of Diuine iudgements, did serue as fit Instruments, to consummate the destruction of Antichristian enemies, on whō they▪ should suddenly, rashly, & insensibly fall, to their vtter confusion. Reuel. 16, 1. Also Reuel. 21, 9.

Reuel. 14, 19. And cut downe the Vines of the Vineyards of the earth. Some, iudgeth this Prophesie, not to bee of the last iudgement, when all the wicked shall be cast into the large Wine-presse of the pit of Hell, to bee tormented (as Clusters of Grapes cut off, are cast into a Fat or presse, where they be pressed,) but to haue beene fulfilled, in the yeare of our Lord, one thousand fiue hundred thirty and nine, here in England; when Monasteries,

Abbies, Fryeries, Nunneries, & other Houses (then falsly called Religious) were pulled downe, theyr Lands and Reuennewes, conuerted to other more honest and publique vses, by the aduise and seruice of Lord Cromwell, who (as a sharpe Sickle) serued the prouidence of God, not to lop and prime, but to cut downe the Vines, euen the shining fat glorie of the Popish pontificall Church, which had taken and spread it selfe farre and neere in this rich and fruitfull Iland, such a cropping of the Vines happened in Germany, much about the same time.

Reuel. 11, 7. The Beast that commeth out of the bottomlesse pit, shall make war against

them. Reuel, 13, 7. Make Warre against the Saints. This warre, is that hot opposition and bitter enmity, which the Tridentine Counsell, with the Popes and Emperors forces, made against the Protestants in Germany, as the learned collect, by comparing euents with prophesies. There is another battaile mentioned, chap: 19, verse 19, 20, &c. wherein the Beast shall ouercome and be taken.

                        The diuers condition of the Roman Empire, according to the change of 4. seuerall times, 1. flourishing in Maiesty & power, vnder the raign of the first Emperors, Iulius, Augustus, Tiberius, Claudius, &c. 2. Ecclipsed and diminished in glory and power, vnder the succeeding Emperors, Nero, Galba, Domitian, &c. 3. But reuiued and raised vp againe in the Popes. 4. and finally, in Gods iust Iudgement to be thrust down into vtter destruction. Reuel. 17, 8. The Beast which thou hast seene, was, and is not, and shall ascend out of the bottomlesse pit, and shall go to perdition. Some other Diuines, vnderstande this wholy of Antichrist, the Popish Empire, which began after S. Iohns time, in the end of the raigne of Constantine the Great; 2. & afterward, by an incursion of Barbarians, Rome and Italy, being miserably wasted, the pontificall Authoritie and Sea seemed, as it were not to be. 3. But this hurt & wound was afterward cured by Iustinian and Phocas, in the time of Pope Gregory the second, which exercised a greater power (both Ecclesiasticall and Temporall) then any of his predecessors had done. 4. Yet this newly-recouered dignitie, was not alwaies to last, but to be diminished by little and little (as we see this day) till it wholy be extinct, which posteritie

must see. That this is the truest interpretation, may appear, by verses 10. and 12. of this chap. which make it manifest. This Beast heere spoken of, not to haue beene then when hee wrote this prophesie, nor had not then receiued his kingdome and power. Therefore, they are vtterly deceiued, which expound this verse of the As Ribera the Iesuit doth Deuill; or which doo seeke for the beginning or seate of Anti-christ any where, but at Rome, where all the foure former mutations and chaunges are euidently knowne to haue happened, whether we vnderstand these changes, ioyntly of the Heathenish and Popish Monarchie, or of Ecclesiastical Empire alone, as it seemes that it ought to be, for the former reason.

This is commonly vnderstood of the last Iudgement, and referred to Christ, who shall come from Heauen in a cloud, representing his vprightnesse, by the Whitenesse. But this seemes not to agree with verse 15. Where hee that sate on the Cloud, is saide, to doo nothing but by the commandement of another Angell.

Reuel. 6, 2. Loe, there was a White Horse, and he that sat on him had a Bow. They seem then to be wide, which vnderstand this of the Arrowes of Pestilence, mightily and speedily striking men. Other, farre more probably, referre this to the victory which the truth had, vnder the Emperor Adrian, who by mediation of certaine Phylosophers, pleading the cause of Christians before him, was mooued to make a ioyful decree, that no Christian should bee condemned, but for ciuill crimes punishable by law. Euseb. lib. 4. cap. 3. as afterward, by Edict of the next Emperour, Antoninus Pius, at the motion of Iustinus Martir, it was proclaimed, that no Christian should be troubled, because hee was a Christian, and their accusers should bee iudged to punishment.

Let him that hath vnderstanding, let him count, &c. Learned Iunius giues this Interpretation of this verse. The name and marke of the Beast (saith he) doo easily happen to any; but it is wisedom to haue the number of the Beast; that is, onely the wise, and such as haue vnderstanding, can come by that number: for they must be most illuminated Doctors which attaine thereto.
