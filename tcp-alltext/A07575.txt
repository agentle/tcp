                  GOod men and wymmen this daye is an hyghe and a ſolēpne feſte in holy chirche. For it is of the holy trynyte. For as holy chirche atte wytſontyde maketh mencion how the holy gooſt come to cryſtis dyſciples Now at this tyme is made mencion of all thre perſones yt is for to ſay Pater filius et ſpiritus ſanctꝰ.

This holy feſt was worſhyped for the trynyte. fyrſt fyndyng. for heretykis confoundyng. and for the Trynyte worſhypynge. Fyrſte it was ordeyned for the fourme of the trynyte fyndyng.

Thus the trynyte was founde in man wherfore man ſhold haue mynde to doo worſhype to the holy trynyte For holy chirche ordeyned that in weddynge of a man and woman to gyder. ſoo that the maſſe of the Trynyte is ſongen. And atte his dethe one bell ſhall be ronge in worſhyp of the trynyte wherfore all criſtē people ben bounde gretly to worſhyp the holy trynyte. The ſecond cauſe is ye feſte is ordeyned in confundynge of heretykes and of lollers for to dyſtroye them and her falſe opynyons yt they had ayenſt the holy trynyte. For ryght as heretykis in the begynnynge of the feyth wyth her ſwete wordes and fals opynyons were aboute to diſtroye the feyth of the holy trynyte. In the ſame wyſe lollers nowe a dayes wyth her falſe ſpyce of gyle be aboute alſo to wythdrawe the people from the trewe byleue and feyth of the holy trynyte. & the byleue & feyth of the holy chirche Popes martirs and confeſſours to the deth Ryght ſoo now thyſe lollers purſuen men of holy chirche & ben aboute in all maner wayes that they can and may fynde to diſtroye and vndo h

Thus it happed on a tyme wyth themperour of rome that hyght Attylya▪ & he was made by heretikes as Iohan bellet telleth. the whiche emperour purſued criſten peple ſore and hated hem and holy chirche gretly. wherfor he made to brenne all the bokes that myght be founde of cryſten feyth. But as almyghty god wolde▪ there was a good holy man. and that was a grete clerke and the clerke was called Alpunous that in mayntenynge of the feyth off holy chirche he made the ſtory of the trinyte▪ and the ſtory all ſoo of ſaynt ſteuen. and brought it vnto the pope for to haue hem ſongen and rede in holy chirche.

The thirde cauſe is for the hyghe trynyte worſhypynge and for all cryſten men ſhold knowe howe & in what maner they ſhold byleue in the trynyte. for as holy chirche techeth. he that byleueth in the trynyte ſhall be ſaued and they that done not ſhall bee dampned. ¶Thenne it is full expedyent and nedefull to all cryſten people to knowe how they ſhold lyue. ye ſhal vnderſtonde that parfyt loue to god is the byleue.
