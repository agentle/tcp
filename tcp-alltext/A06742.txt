            The Prologue.
            THe manifold great fauours we haue found,
            By you, to vs poore weaklings ſtill extended:
            Whereof your vertues haue bene only ground,
            And no deſert in vs to be ſo friended:
            Bindes vs ſome way or other to expreſſe,
            (Though all our all be elſe defeated quite
            Of any meanes) ſaue duteous thankefulnes,
            Which is the vtmoſt meaſure of our might:
            Then to the boundleſſe Ocean of your woorth,
            This little drop of water we preſent:
            Where though it neuer can be ſingled foorth,
            Let zeale be pleader for our good intent.
            Drops not diminiſh, but encreaſe great floods:
            And mites impaire not, but augment our goods.
         
         
            
            The Maydes Metamorphoſis.
            Enter Phylander, Oreſtes, Eurymine.
            
               Eurymine.
               
                  PHylander, and Oreſtes, what conceyt
               Troubles your ſilent mindes? Let me intreat
               Since we are come thus farre, as we do walke
               You would deuiſe ſome prettie pleaſant talke:
               The aire is coole, the euening high and faire,
               Why ſhould your cloudie lookes, then ſhew diſpaire?
            
            
               Phy.
               Beleeue me faire Eurimine, my skill
               Is ſimple in diſcourſe, and vtterance ill:
               
                  Oreſtes if he were diſpoſde to trie,
               Can better manage ſuch affaires than I.
            
            
               Eu.
               Why then Oreſtes let me craue of you
               Some olde, or late done ſtory to renew:
               Another time you ſhall requeſt of me
               As good, if not, a greater curteſie.
            
            
               Or.
               Truſt me as now (nor can I ſhew a reaſon)
               All mirth vnto my mind comes out of ſeaſon:
               For inward I am troubled in ſuch ſort,
               As all vnfit I am to make report
               Of any thing may breed the leaſt delight,
               Rather in teares, I wiſh the day were night:
               For neither can my ſelfe be merry now,
               Nor treat of ought that may be likte of you.
            
            
               
               Eu.
               Thats but your melancholike old diſeaſe,
               That neuer are diſpoſde but when ye pleaſe.
            
            
               Ph.
               Nay miſtreſſe, then ſince he denies the taske
               My ſelfe will ſtrait compliſh what ye aske:
               And though the pleaſure in my tale be ſmall,
               Yet may it ſerue to paſſe the time withall.
            
            
               Eu.
               Thanks good Phylander, when you pleaſe ſay on,
               Better I deeme a bad diſcourſe, then none.
            
            
               Phy.
               Sometime there liu'd a Duke not far from hence,
               Mightie in fame, and vertues excellence,
               Subiects he had, as readie to obey
               As he to rule: beloued euery way,
               But that which moſt of all he gloried in,
               (Hope of his age, and comfort of his kin,)
               Was the fruition of one onely ſonne,
               A gallant youth, inferior vnto none
               For vertue, ſhape, or excellence of wit,
               That after him vpon his throne might ſit.
               This youth when once he came to perfect age,
               The Duke would faine haue linckt in marriage
               With diuers dames of honourable blood,
               But ſtil his fathers purpoſe he withſtood.
            
            
               Eu.
               How, was he not of mettal apt to loue?
            
            
               Phy.
               Yes apt enough, as wil the ſequel proue.
               But ſo the ſtreame of his affection lay,
               As he did leane a quite contrary way,
               Diſprouing ſtill the choyce his father made,
               And oftentimes the matter had delaid:
               Now giuing hope he would at length conſent,
               And then again, excuſing his intent.
            
            
               Eu.
               What made him ſo repugnant in his deeds?
            
            
               Phy.
               Another loue, which this diſorder breeds:
               For euen at home within his fathers Court
               The Saint was ſhrinde, whom he did honor moſt:
               A louely dame, a virgin pure and chaſte,
               And worthy of a Prince to be imbrac'te.
               
               Had but her birth (which was obſcure they ſaid)
               Anſwerd her beautie, this their opinion ſtaid.
               Yet did this wilful youth affect her ſtill,
               And none but ſhe was miſtres of his will.
               Full often did his father him diſſwade,
               From liking ſuch a mean and low borne mayde.
               The more his father ſtroue to change his minde,
               The more the ſonne became with fancy blinde.
            
            
               Eu.
               Alas, how ſped the ſilly Louers then?
            
            
               Phy.
               As might euen grieue the rude vnciuel'ſt men.
               When herevpon to weane his fixed heart
               From ſuch diſhonour, to his high deſert,
               The Duke had labourd, but in vaine did ſtriue,
               Thus he began his purpoſe to contriue:
               Two of his ſeruants of vndoubted troth,
               He bound by vertue of a ſolemne oath,
               To traine the ſilly damzel out of ſight,
               And there in ſecret to bereaue her quite
            
            
               Eu.
               Of what, her life?
            
            
               Phy.
               Yes Madame of her life,
               Which was the cauſe of all the former ſtrife.
            
            
               Eu.
               And did they kill her?
            
            
               Phy.
               You ſhall heare anon:
               The queſtion firſt muſt be diſcided on
               In your opinion, whats your iudgement? ſay,
               Who were moſt cruell: thoſe that did obay,
               Or he that gaue commandment for the fact?
            
            
               Eu.
               In each of them it was a bloody act:
               Yet they deſerue (to ſpeake my mind of both)
               Moſt pardon, that were bound thereto by oath.
            
            
               Phy.
               It is enough, we do accept your doome,
               To paſſe vnblam'd, what ere of you become.
            
            
               Eu.
               To paſſe vnblamde, what ere become of me?
               What may the meaning of theſe ſpeeches be?
            
            
               Phy.
               
                  Eurymine, my trembling tongue doth ſaile,
               My conſcience yrkes, my fainting ſences quaile:
               
               My faltring ſpeech bewraies my guiltie thought,
               And ſtammers at the meſſage we haue brought.
            
            
               Eu.
               Ay me, what horror doth inuade my breſt?
            
            
               Or.
               Nay then Phylander I will tell the reſt.
               Damzell thus fares thy caſe, demand not why,
               You muſt forth with prepare your ſelfe to dye.
               Therefore diſpatch, and ſet your mind at reſt.
            
            
               Eu.
               
                  Phylander is it true? or doth he ieſt?
            
            
               Phy.
               There is no remedie but you muſt dye:
               By you I framde my tragicke hiſtory.
               The Duke my maiſter, is the man I meant,
               His ſonne, the Prince, the mayd of meane diſcent
               Your ſelfe, on whom Aſcanio ſo doth doate,
               As for no reaſon may remoue his thought:
               Your death the Duke determines by vs two,
               To end the loue betwixt his ſonne and you:
               And for that cauſe we trainde you to this wood,
               Where you muſt ſacrifice your deareſt blood.
            
            
               Eur.
               Reſpect my teares.
            
            
               Oreſt.
               We muſt regard our oath.
            
            
               Eur.
               My tender yeares.
            
            
               Or.
               They are but trifles both.
            
            
               Eu.
               Mine innocency.
            
            
               Or.
               That would our promiſe breake,
               Diſpatch forthwith, we may not heare you ſpeake.
            
            
               Eu.
               If neither teares nor innocency moue,
               Yet thinke there is a heauenly power aboue.
            
            
               Oreſt.
               A done, and ſtand not preaching here all day.
            
            
               Eu.
               Then ſince there is no remedie, I pray
               Yet good my maiſters, do but ſtay ſo long
               Till I haue tane my farewell with a ſong,
               Of him whom I ſhall neuer ſee againe.
            
            
               Phy.
               We will affoord that reſpit to your paine.
            
            
               Eu.
               But leaſt the feare of death appall my mind,
               Sweet gentlemen let me this fauour find.
               That you wil vale mine eye-ſight with this ſcarfe:
               
               That when the fatall ſtroke is aymde at me,
               I may not ſtart, but ſuffer patiently.
            
            
               Oreſt.
               Agreed, giue me, Ile ſhadow ye from feare,
               If this may do it.
            
            
               Eu.
               Oh I would it might,
               But ſhadowes want the power to do that right.
               Shee ſings.
               Ye ſacred Fyres, and powers aboue,
               Forge of deſires working loue,
               Caſt downe your eye, caſt downe your eye
               Vpon a Mayde in miſerie.
               My ſacrifice is louers blood:
               And from eyes ſalt teares a flood:
               All which I ſpend, all which I ſpend
               For thee Aſcanio, my deare friend:
               And though this houre I muſt feele
               The bitter ſower of pricking ſteele,
               Yet ill or well, yet ill or well
               To thee Aſcanio ſtill farewell.
            
            Oreſtes offers to ſtrike her with his Rapier, and is ſtayed
by Phylander.
            
               Oreſt.
               What meanes Phylander?
               
            
            
               Phy.
               Oh forbeare thy ſtroke,
               Her pitious mone and geſture might prouoke
               Hard flints to ruthe.
            
            
               Oreſt.
               Haſt thou forgot thy oath?
            
            
               Phy.
               Forgot it? no.
            
            
               Or.
               Then wherfore doeſt thou interrupt me ſo?
            
            
               Phy.
               A ſudden terror ouercomes my thought.
            
            
               Or.
               Thē ſuffer me, that ſtands in fear of nought.
            
            
               Phy.
               Oh hold Oreſtes, heare my reaſon firſt.
            
            
               Or.
               Is all religion of thy vowe forgot?
               Do as thou wilt, but I forget it not.
            
            
               
               Phy.
               
                  Oreſtes, if thou ſtandſt vpon thine oath,
               Let me alone, to anſwere for vs both.
            
            
               Or.
               What anſwer canſt thou giue? I wil not ſtay.
            
            
               Phy.
               Nay villain, then my ſword ſhall make me way.
            
            
               Or.
               Wilt thou in this, againſt thy conſcience ſtriue?
            
            
               Phy.
               I will defend a woman while I liue.
               A virgin, and an innocent beſide,
               Therefore put vp, or elſe thy chaunce abide.
            
            
               Or.
               Ile neuer ſheath my ſword, vnles thou ſhow,
               Our oath reſerued, we may let her go.
            
            
               Phy.
               That will I do, if truth may be of force.
            
            
               Or.
               And then wil I be pleaſd to graunt remorſe.
            
            
               Eu.
               Litle thought & when out of doore I went,
               That thus my life ſhould ſtand on argument.
            
            
               Phy.
               A lawfull oath in an vnlawfull cauſe,
               Is firſt diſpenc't withall, by reaſons lawes:
               Then next, reſpect muſt to the end be had,
               Becauſe th'intent, doth make it good or bad.
               Now here th'intent is murder as thou ſeeſt,
               Which to performe, thou on thy oath relieſt:
               But ſince the cauſe is wicked and vniuſt,
               Th'effect muſt likewiſe be held odious.
               We ſwore to kill, and God forbids to kill:
               Shall we be rulde by him, or by mans will?
               Beſide it is a woman is condemde:
               And what is he that is a man indeed,
               That can endure to ſee a woman bleed?
            
            
               Or.
               Thou haſt preuaild, Eurymine ſtand vp,
               I will not touch thee for a world of gold.
            
            
               Phy.
               Why now thou ſeemſt to be of humane mould.
               But on our graunt faire mayd that you ſhall liue,
               Will you to vs your faithfull promiſe giue,
               Henceforth t'abandon this your Country quite,
               And neuer more returne into the ſight
               Of fierce Telemachus, the angry Duke,
               Whereby we may be voyd of all rebuke?
            
            
               
               Eur.
               Here do I plight my chaſte vnſpotted hand,
               I will abiure this moſt accurſed land:
               And vow henceforth what fortune ere betide,
               Within theſe woods and deſarts to abide.
            
            
               Phy.
               Now wants there nothing, but a fit excuſe,
               To ſooth the Duke, in his conceiu'd abuſe:
               That he may be perſwaded ſhe is ſlaine,
               And we our wonted fauour ſtill maintaine.
            
            
               Oreſt.
               It ſhall be thus, within a Lawne hard by,
               Obſcure with buſhes, where no humane eye,
               Can any way diſcouer our deceite:
               There feeds a heard of Goates, and country neate.
               Some Kidde, or other young ling, will we take,
               And with our ſwords diſpatch it for her ſake.
               And hauing ſlaine it, rip his panting breaſt,
               And take the heart of the vnguiltie beaſt:
               Which to th'intent, our counterfeit report
               May ſeeme more likely, we will beare to court:
               And there proteſt with bloody weapons drawne,
               It was her heart.
            
            
               Phy.
               Then likewiſe take this Lawne,
               Which well Telemachus did know ſhe wore:
               And let it be all ſpotted too with gore.
               How ſay you miſtreſſe, will you ſpare that vale?

               That or what elſe, to verifie your tale:
               And thankes Phylander, and Orestes both,
               That you preſerue me from a Tyrants wroth.
            
            
               Phy.
               I would it were within my power, I wis,
               To do you greater curteſie then this:
               But what we cannot by our deeds expreſſe
               In heart we wiſh to eaſe your heauineſſe.
            
            
               Eur.
               A double debt, yet one word ere ye go,
               Commmend me to my deare Aſcanio:
               
               Whoſe loyall loue, and preſence to forgoe,
               Doth gall me more then all my other woe.
            
            
               Oreſt.
               Our liues ſhall neuer want to do him good.

               Nor yet our death, if he in daunger ſtood:

               Or.

               And now Eurymine record thy ſtate,
               So much deiected, and oppreſt by fate:
               What hope remaines? wherein haſt thou to ioy?
               Wherein to tryumph, but thine owne annoy?
               If euer wretch might tell of miſerie,
               Then I alas, poore I, am only ſhe:
               Vnknowne of parents, deſtitute of friends,
               Hopefull of nought, but what misfortune ſends.
               Baniſht, to liue a fugitiue alone,
               In vncoth paths, and regions neuer knowne.
               Behold Aſcanio, for thy only ſake,
               Theſe tedious trauels I muſt vndertake:
               Nor do I grudge, the paine ſeemes leſſe to mee,
               In that I ſuffer this diſtreſſe for thee.
            
            Enter Siluio, a Raunger.
            
               Sil.
               Wel met fair Nymph, or Goddeſſe if ye bee:
               Tis ſtraunge me thinkes, that one of your degree
               Should walke theſe ſolitary groues alone.

               It were no maruell if you knew my mone.

               Truſt me, I ſaw not any, ſo farewell.

               Nay ſtay: and further of your fortunes tell:
               I am not one that meanes you any harme.
            
            Enter Gemulo the ſhepheard.
            
               Ge.
               I thinke my Boy be fled away by charme.
               Raunger well met: within thy walke I pray,
               Sawſt thou not Moyſo, my vnhappie Boy?
            
            
               
               Sil.
               Shepheard not I, what meanſt to ſeeke him here?

               Becauſe the wagge, poſſeſt with doubtfull feare,

               But how now Raunger? you miſtake I trowe,
               This is a Lady, and no barren Dowe.
            
            
               Sil.
               It is indeede, and as it ſeemes, diſtreſt,
               Whoſe griefe to know, I humbly made requeſt:
               But ſhe as yet will not reueale the ſame.
            
            
               Ge.
               Perhaps to me ſhe will: ſpeak gentle dame?
               What daunger great hath driuen ye to this place?
               Make knowne your ſtate, and looke what ſlender grace,
               A Shepheards poore abilitie may yeeld,
               You ſhall be ſure of, ere I leaue the feeld.

               Alas good Sir, the cauſe may not be knowne,
               That hath inforſte me to be here alone.

               Nay feare not to diſcouer what you are:

               Eu.
               Since needs you will, that I renew my griefe,
               Whether it be my chance to finde reliefe
               Or not, I wreake not: ſuch my croſſes are,
               As ſooner I expect to meete diſpaire.
               Then thus it is: not farre from hence do dwell
               My parents, of the world eſteemed well:
               Who with their bitter threats, my graūt had won,
               This day to marrie with a neighbours ſon.
               And ſuch a one, to whom I ſhould be wife,
               As I could neuer fancie in my life.
               And therefore to auoyd that endleſſe thrall,
               This morne I came away and left them all.
            
            
               Sil.
               Now truſt me virgin, they were much vnkind,
               To ſeeke to match you ſo againſt your minde.
            
            
               Ge.
               It was beſide, vnnaturall conſtraint:
               But by the tenure of your iuſt complaint,
               It ſeemes you are not minded to returne,
               Nor any more to dwell where you were borne.

               It is my purpoſe, if I might obtaine

               Sil.
               Why go with me, my Lodge is not far off,
               Where you ſhall haue ſuch hoſpitalitie
               As ſhall be for your health and ſafetie.
            
            
               Ge.
               Soft Raunger, you do raunge beyond your skill,
               My houſe is nearer: and for my good will,
               It ſhall exceed a woodmans woodden ſtuffe:
               Then go with me, Ile keep you ſafe enough.
            
            
               Sil.
               Ile bring her to a bower beſet with greene.
            
            
               Ge.
               And I an arbour, may delight a Queene.
            
            
               Sil.
               Her dyet ſhalbe Venſon at my boord.
            
            
               Ge.
               Yong Kid and Lambe, we ſhepheards can affoord.
            
            
               Sil.
               And nothing elſe?
            
            
               Ge.
               Yes, raunging now and then,
               A Hog, a Gooſe, a Capon, or a Hen.
            
            
               Sil.
               Theſe walkes are mine, amongſt the ſhadie trees.
            
            
               Ge.
               For that I haue, a garden full of Bees,
               Whoſe buzing muſick with the flowers ſweet,
               Each euen and morning, ſhall her ſences greet.
            
            
               Sil.
               The Nightingale is my continuall clocke.
            
            
               Ge.
               And mine the watchfull, ſin-remembring cocke.
            
            
               Sil.
               A hunts vp, I can tune her with my hounds.
            
            
               Ge.
               And I can ſhew her meads, and fruitfull grounds.
            
            
               Sil.
               Within theſe woods are many pleaſant ſprings.
            
            
               Ge.
               Betwixt yond dales, the Eccho daily ſings.
            
            
               Sil.
               I maruell that a ruſticke ſhepheard dare
               With woodmen then audaciouſly compare?
               Why, hunting is a pleaſure for a King,
               And Gods themſelues ſometime frequent the thing.
               
                  Diana with her bowe and arrowes keene,
               Did often vſe the Chace, in Forreſts greene.
               And ſo alas, the good Athenian knight,
               And ſwift Acteon herein tooke delight:
               And Atalanta the Arcadian dame,
               Conceiu'd ſuch wondrous pleaſure in the game:
               
               That with her traine of Nymphs attending on,
               She came to hunt the Bore of Calydon.
               
            
            
               Ge.
               So did Apollo walk with ſhepheards crooke,
               And many Kings their ſcepters haue forſooke:
               To lead the quiet life we ſhepheards tooke.
               Accounting it a refuge for their woe.
            
            
               Sil.
               But we take choice of many a pleaſant walke
               And marke the Deare how they begin to ſtalke.
               When each according to his age and time,
               Pricks vp his head, and beares a Princely minde:
               The luſtie Stag conductor of the traine,
               Leads all the heard in order downe the plaine:
               The baſer raſcalls ſcatter here and there,
               As not preſuming to approach ſo neere.
            
            
               Ge.
               So ſhepheards ſomtime ſit vpon a hill,
               Or in the cooling ſhadow of a mill:
               And as we ſit, vnto our pipes we ſing,
               And therewith make the neighboring groues to ring.
               And when the ſun ſteales downward to the weſt,
               We leaue our chat, and whiſtle in the fiſt:
               Which is a ſignall to our ſtragling flocke,
               As Trumpets ſound to men in martiall ſhocke.
            
            
               Sil.
               Shall I be thus out-faced by a ſwaine?
               Ile haue a guard to wayt vpon her traine,
               Of gallant woodmen, clad in comely greene:
               The like whereof, hath ſildome yet bene ſeene.
            
            
               Ge.
               And I of ſhepheards ſuch a luſtie crew,
               As neuer Forreſter the like yet knew:
               Who for their perſons and their neate aray,
               Shalbe as freſh, as is the moneth of May.
               Where are ye there, ye merry noted ſwaines?
               Draw neare a while, and whilſt vpon the plaines
               Your flocks do gently feed, lets ſee your skill,
               How you with chaunting, can ſad ſorrow kill.
            
            Enter ſhepheards ſinging.
            
               Sil.
               Thinks Gemulo to beare the bell away?
               
               By ſinging of a ſimple Rundelay?
               No, I haue fellowes, whoſe melodious throates
               Shall euen as far exceed thoſe homely notes
               As doth the Nightingale in muſicke paſſe,
               The moſt melodious bird that euer was.
               And for an inſtance, here they are at hand,
               When they haue done, let our deſerts be ſcand.
            
            Enter wood-men, and ſing.
            
               Eu.
               Thanks to you both, you both deſerue ſo well,
               As I want skill your worthineſſe to tell:
               And both I do commend for your good will,
               And both Ile honor, loue and reuerence ſtill:
               For neuer virgin had ſuch kindnes ſhowne,
               Of ſtraungers, yea, and men to her vnknowne.
               But more, to end this ſudden controuerſie,
               Since I am made an vmpier in the plea,
               This is my verdite: Ile intreate of you
               A Cottage for my dwelling: and of you,
               A flocke to tend: and ſo indifferent
               My gratefull paines on either ſhalbe ſpent.
            
            
               Sil.
               I am agreed, and for the loue I beare
               Ile boaſt, I haue a Tenant is ſo faire.
            
            
               Ge.
               And I wil hold it as a rich poſſeſſion,
               That ſhe vouchſafes to be of my profeſſion.
            
            
               Sil.
               Thē for a ſign that no man here hath wrong
               From hence lets all conduct her with a ſong.
            
            The end of the firſt Act.
         
         
            Actus ſecundus.
            Enter Aſcanio, and Ioculo his Page.
            
               Aſca.

               Here ſir, at hand.
            
            
               Aſca.
               
                  Ioculo, where is ſhe?
            
            
               Io.
               I know not.
            
            
               Aſca.
               When went ſhe?
            
            
               
               Io.
               I know not.
            
            
               Aſca.
               Which way went ſhe?
            
            
               Io.
               I know not.
            
            
               Aſca.
               Where ſhould I ſeeke her?
            
            
               Io.
               I know not.
            
            
               Aſca.
               When ſhall I find her?
            
            
               Io.
               I know not.
            
            
               Aſca.
               A vengeance take thee ſlaue, what doſt thou know?
            
            
               Io.
               Marry ſir, that I doo know.
            
            
               Aſca.
               What villaine?
            
            
               Io.
               And you be ſo teſtie, go looke:
               What a coyles here with you?
               If we knew where ſhe were, what need we ſeeke her?
               I thinke you are lunaticke: where were you
               When you ſhould haue lookt after her? now you
               Go crying vp and downe after your wench, like
               A Boy had loſt his horne booke.
            
            
               Aſca.
               Ah my ſweet Boy.
            
            
               Io.
               Ah my ſweet Maiſter: nay I can giue you as good
               Words as you can giue me: alls one for that.
            
            
               Aſca.
               What canſt thou giue me no reliefe?
            
            
               Io.
               Faith ſir, there comes not one morſel of comfort
               From my lips, to ſuſtaine that hungry mawe
               Of your miſerie, there is ſuch a dearth at this time,
               God amend it.
            
            
               Aſca.
               A Ioculo, my breaſt is full of griefe,
               And yet my hope, that only wants reliefe.
            
            
               Io.
               Your breſt and my belly, are in two contrary kaies,
               You walke to get ſtomacke to your meate,
               And I walke to get meate to my ſtomacke:
               Your breaſt's full, and my belli's emptie.
               If they chance to part in this caſe, God ſend them
               Merry meeting: that my belly be ful, and your breſt empty.
            
            
               Aſca.
               Boy, for the loue that euer thou didſt owe,
               To thy deare maſter, poore Aſcanio,
               
               Racke thy proou'd wits, vnto the higheſt ſtraine,
               To bring me backe Eurymine againe.
            
            
               
               Io.
               Nay maſter, if wit could do it, I could tell you
               More: but if it euer be done, the very legeritie
               Of the feete muſt do it: theſe ten nimble bones
               Muſt do the deed: Ile trot like a little dog:
               Theres not a buſh ſo big as my beard,
               But Ile be peeping in it: theres not a Coate but
               Ile ſearch euery corner: if ſhe be aboue, or
               Beneath, ouer the ground, or vnder, Ile finde her out.
            
            
               Aſca.
               Stay Ioculo: alas it cannot be:
               If we ſhould part, I looſe both her and thee:
               The woods are wide: and wandring thus about,
               Thou maiſt be loſt: and not my Loue found out.
            
            
               Io.
               I pray you let me goe.
            
            
               Aſca.
               I pray thee ſtay.
            
            
               Io.
               I faith ile runne.
            
            
               Aſca.
               And doeſt not know which way.
            
            
               Io.
               Any way: alls one, ile drawe drie foote:
               If you ſend not to ſeeke her, you may lye
               Here long enough, before ſhe come to ſeeke you:
               She litle thinkes that you are hunting for her
               In theſe quarters.
            
            
               Aſca.
               Ah Ioculo, before I leaue my Boy,
               Of this worlds comfort, now my only ioy:
               Seeſt thou this place? vpon this graſſie bed,
               With ſommers gawdie dyaper beſpred.
               He lyes downe.
               Vnder theſe ſhadowes ſhall my dwelling be:
               Till thou returne, ſweet Ioculo to me.
            
            
               Io.
               And if my Conuoy be not cut off by the way,
               It ſhall not be long before I be with you.
               He ſpeakes to the people.
               Well, I pray you looke to my maiſter: for
               Here I leaue him amongſt you: and if I
               
               Chaunce to light on the wench, you ſhall heare
               Of me by the next winde.
            
            Exit Ioculo, Aſcanio ſolus.
            
            
               Aſca.
               In vaine I feare, I beate my braines about,
               Proouing by ſearch, to finde my miſtreſſe out:
               
                  Eurymine, Eurymine, retorne:
               And with thy preſence guild the beautious morne:
               And yet I feare to call vpon thy name,
               The pratling Eccho, ſhould ſhe learne the ſame,
               The laſt words accent ſheele no more prolong,
               But beare that ſound vpon her airie tong.
               Adorned with the preſence of my Loue,
               The woods I feare, ſuch ſecret power ſhal proue
               As they'll ſhut vp each path: hide euery way,
               Becauſe they ſtill would haue her go aſtray:
               And in that place would alwaies haue her ſcene,
               Only becauſe they would be euer greene:
               And keepe the wingged Quiriſters ſtill there,
               To baniſh winter cleane out of the yeare.
               But why perſiſt I to bemone my ſtate,
               When ſhe is gone, and my complaint too late?
               A drowſie dulnes cloſeth vp my ſight,
               O powerfull ſleepe, I yeeld vnto thy might.
            
            He falles a ſleepe.
            Enter Iuno, and Iris.
            
               Iuno.
               Come hither Iris.
               
            
            
               Iris.
               
                  Iris is at hand,
               To attend Ioues wife: great Iunos hie command.
            
            
               Iuno.
               
                  Iris I know I do thy ſeruice proue,
               And euer ſince I was the wife of Ioue
               
               Thou haſt bene readie when I called ſtill,
               And alwayes moſt obedient to my will:
               Thou ſeeſt how that imperiall Queene of loue,
               With all the Gods, how ſhe preuailes aboue,
               And ſtill againſt great Iunos heſts doth ſtand,
               To haue all ſtoupe and bowe, at her command:
               Her Doues and Swannes, and Sparrowes, muſt be graced.
               And on Loues Aultars, muſt be highly placed.
               
               My ſtarry Peacocks, which doth beare my ſtate:
               Scar
                     •
                  ſly alowed within his pallace gate:
               And ſince her ſelfe, ſhe thus preferd doth ſee,
               Now the proud huſwife will contend with mee:
               And practiſeth her wanton pranckes to play
               With this Aſcanio, and Eurymine.
               
               But Loue ſhall know, in ſpight of all his skill,
               
                  Iuno's a woman, and will haue her will.
            
            
               Iris.
               What is my Goddeſſe will? may Iris aske?
            
            
               Iuno.
               
                  Iris, on thee I do impoſe this taske,
               To croſſe proud Venus, and her purblind Lad,
               Vntill the mother, and her brat be mad,
               And with each other, ſet them ſo at ods,
               Till to their teeth they curſe, and ban the Gods.
            
            
               Iris.
               Goddes, the graunt conſiſts alone in you,
            
            
               Iuno.
               Then mark the courſe which now you muſt purſue.
               Within this ore-growne Forreſt, there is found
               A duskie Caue, thruſt lowe into the ground:
               So vgly darke, ſo dampie and ſteepe,
               As for his life the ſunne durſt neuer peepe
               Into the entrance: which doth ſo afright
               The very day, that halfe the world is night.
               Where fenniſh fogges, and vapours do abound:
               There Morpheus doth dwell within the ground,
               No crowing Cocke, nor waking bell doth call,
               Nor watchfull dogge diſturbeth ſleepe at all.
               No ſound is heard in compaſſe of the hill,
               But euery thing is quiet, whiſht, and ſtill.
               Amid this Caue, vpon the ground doth lie,
               A hollow plancher, all of Ebonie
               Couer'd with blacke, whereon the drowſie God,
               Drowned in ſleepe, continually doth nod:
               Go Iris go, and my commaundment take,
               And beate againſt the doores till ſleepe awake,
               Bid him from me, in viſion to appeare,
               Vnto Aſcanio that lieth ſlumbring heare.
               And in that viſion, to reueale the way,
               
               How he may finde the faire Eurymine.
               
            
            
               Iris.
               Madam, my ſeruice is at your command,
            
            
               Iuno.
               Diſpatch it then, good Iris out of hand.
               My Peacocks and my Charriot ſhall remaine,
               About the ſhore, till thou returne againe.
            
            Exit Iuno.
            
               Iris.
               About the buſineſſe now that I am ſent,
               To ſleepes blacke Caue, I will incontinent:
               And his darke cabine, boldly will I ſhake,
               Vntill the drowſie lumpiſh God awake:
               And ſuch a bounſing at his Caue Ile keepe,
               That if pale death, ſeaz'd on the eyes of ſleepe,
               Ile rowſe him vp, that when he ſhall me heare,
               Ile make his locks ſtand vp on end with feare.
               Be ſilent aire, whil'ſt Iris in her pride
               Swifter then thought, vpon the windes doth ride.
               
                  What Somnus, what Somnus, Somnus.
               Strikes.
               Pauſes a litle.
               What wilt thou not awake? are thou ſtill ſo faſt?
               Nay then yfaith, Ile haue an other caſt.
               
                  What Somnus Somnus I ſay?
               
               Strikes againe.
            
            
               Som.
               Who calles at this time of the day?
               What a balling doſt thou keepe?
               A vengeance take thee, let me ſleepe,
            
            
               Iris.
               Vp thou drowſie God, I ſay,
               And come preſently away,
               Or I will beate vpon this doore,
               That after this, thou ſleep'ſt no more.

               Til both heauen and hel do wonder, Somnus I ſay.

                  What Somnus?
            
            Enter Somnus.
            
               Som.
               
                  Iris I thought it ſhould be thee.

               Iris.
               From mightie Iuno, Ioues immortall wife,

               In as true manner, as thou canſt deuiſe.
            
            
               Som.
               I would thou wert hangd for waking me.
               Three ſonnes I haue, the eldeſt Morpheus hight:
               He ſhewes of man, the ſhape or ſight.
               The ſecond Icelor, whoſe beheaſts
               Doth ſhewe the formes of birds and beaſts.
               
                  Phantaſor for the third, things lifeles hee:
               Chuſe which like thee of theſe three.

               Eurymine.
            
            
               Som.
               Of Eurymine: and ſhewe this Gentleman,
               What of his miſtres is become.
            
            Kneeling downe by Aſcanio.
            Enter Eurymine, to be ſuppoſed Morpheus.
            
               Mor.
               My deare Aſcanio, in this viſion ſee,
               
                  Eurymine doth thus appeare to thee:
               As ſoone as ſleepe hath left thy drowſie eies,
               Follow the path that on thy right hand lies,
               An aged Hermit thou by chaunce ſhalt find,
               That there hath bene, time almoſt out of mind:
               This holy man, this aged reuerent Father,
               There in the woods, doth rootes and ſimples gather:
               His wrinckled browe, tells ſtrengths paſt long ago:
               His beard as white, as winters driuen ſnow.
               He ſhall diſcourſe the troubles I haue paſt,
               And bring vs both togither at the laſt.
               Thus ſhe preſents her ſhadow to thy ſight,
               That would her perſon gladly if ſhe might.
            
            
               
               Iris.
               See how he catches to imbrace the ſhade.
            
            
               Mor.
               This viſion fully doth his powers inuade.
               And when the heate ſhall but a litle ſlake:
               Thou then ſhalt ſee him preſently awake.
            
            
               Som.
               Haſt thou ought elſe, that I may ſtand in ſted?
            
            
               Iris.
               No Somnus, no: go back vnto thy bed:
               
                  Iuno ſhe ſhall reward thee for thy paine.
            
            
               Som.
               Then good night Iris, Ile to reſt againe.
            
            
               Iris.
               
                  Morpheus farwell: to Iuno I will flie.
            
            
               Mor.
               And I to ſleepe, as faſt as I can hie.
               Exeunt.
            
            
               Aſcanio ſtarting, ſayes.
               
                  Eurymine: Ah my good Angell ſtay:
               O vaniſh not ſo ſuddenly away.
               O ſtay my Goddes, whither doeſt thou flie?
               Returne my ſweet Eurymine, tis I.
               
               Where art thou ſpeake? Let me behold thy face:
               Did I not ſee thee in this very place
               Euen now? Here did I not ſee thee ſtand?
               And here thy feete did bleſſe the happie land?
               
                  Eurymine: Oh wilt thou not attend?
               Flie from thy foe: Aſcanio is thy friend.
               The fearfull Hare, ſo ſhuns the labouring hound,
               And ſo the Dear eſchues the Hunts man wound.
               The trembling Foule, ſo flies the Falcons gripe:
               The Bond-man, ſo, his angry maiſters ſtripe.
               
                  I follow not, as Phoebus Daphne did:
               Nor as the Dog purſues the trembling Kid.
               Thy ſhape it was: alas I ſawe not thee:
               That ſight were fitter for the Gods then mee.
               But if in dreames, there any truth be found,
               Thou art within the compas of this ground.
               Ile raunge the woods, and all the groues about,
               And neuer reſt, vntill I find thee out.

            Enter at one doore, Mopſo ſinging.

               Fortune my foe, why doeſt thou frowne on mee?
               And will my fortune neuer better bee:
               Wilt thou I ſay, for euer breed my paine?
               And wilt thou not reſtore my Ioyes againe?
            
            
               Friſco.
               Cannot a man be merry in his owne walke,
               But a muſt be thus encombred?

               I am diſpoſed to be melancholly,

               Thou art the Apple-ſquier to an Eawe,

               Sirrha, ſo you might haue ſaid of your maſters ſheep.
            
            
               Io.
               I marry: this takes fier like touch powder,
               And goes off with a huffe.
            
            
               Friſ.
               They come of crick-cracks, and ſhake their tayles

               Friſco.
               O Sir, though you Courtiers haue all the honour,
               You haue not all the wit.

               Sweet Rogues, your companie to me, is like muſick to

yea marry could ſhe.
            
            
               Friſ.
               And thou art as welcom to me, as a new poking ſtick

               And doth light vpon my crowne,
               Then I ſhake my head and skip:
               And about I trip.
            
            
               3 Fay.
               When I feele a gyrle a ſleepe,
               Vnderneath her frock I peepe,
               There to ſport, and there I play,
               Then I byte her like a flea:
               And about I skip.
            
            
               Io.
               I, I thought where I ſhould haue you.
            
            
               
               1 Fay.
               Wilt pleaſe you daunce fir?
            
            
               Io.
               Indeed ſir, I cannot handle my legges.
            
            
               2 Fay.

            Actus tertius. Scena. 1.
            Enter Appollo, and three Charites.
            
               1. Cha.
               No no great Phoebus, this your ſilence tends.
               To hide your griefe from knowledge of your friends,
               Who if they knew the cauſe in each reſpect,
               Would ſhewe their vtmoſt skill to cure th'effect.
            
            
               Ap.
               Good Ladyes, your conceites in iudgement erre,
               Becauſe you ſee me dumpiſh, you referre
               The reaſon to ſome ſecret griefe of mine:
               But you haue ſeene me melancholy many a time,
               
               Perhaps it is the glowing weather now,
               That makes me ſeeme ſo ill at eaſe to you.
            
            
               1
               Fine ſhifts to colour that you cannot hide,
               No Phoebus, by your lookes may be diſcride
               Some hid conceit that harbors in your thought,
               Which hath therein, ſome ſtraunge impreſſion wrought:
               That by the courſe thereof, you ſeeme to mee,
               An other man then you were wont to bee.
            
            
               Ap.
               No Ladies, you deceiue your ſelues in mee:
               What likelihood or token do ye ſee,
               That may perſwade it true that you ſuppoſe?
            
            
               2
               
                  Appollo, hence a great ſuſpition growes,
               Yeare not ſo pleaſaunt now, as earſt in companie,
               Ye walke alone, and wander ſolitarie.
               The pleaſaunt toyes we did frequent ſometime,
               Are worne away, and growne out of prime.
               Your Inſtrument hath loſt his ſiluer ſound,
               That rang of late, through all this grouie ground.
               Your bowe wherwith the chace you did frequent,
               Is cloſde in caſe, and long hath bene vnbent.
               How differ you from that Appollo now,
               That whilom ſat in ſhade of Lawrell bowe,
               And with the warbling of your Iuorie Lute,
               T'alure the Fairies for to daunce about.
               Or from Th'appollo that with bended bowe,
               Did many a ſharp and wounding ſhaft beſtowe.
               A midſt the Dragon Pithons ſcalie wings,
               And forc't his dying blood to ſpout in ſprings.
               Beleeue me Phebus, who ſawe you then and now,
               Would thinke there were a wondrous change in you.
            
            
               Ap.
               Alas faire dames, to make my ſorows plain,
               Would but reuiue an auncient wound again.
               Which grating preſently vpon my minde,
               Doth leaue a ſcar of former woes behinde.
            
            
               3
               
                  Phoebus, if you account vs for the ſame,
               That tender thee, and loue Appollos name,
               Powre forth to vs the fountaine of your woe,
               
               Frō whence the ſpring of theſe your ſorows ſlowe?
               If we may any way redreſſe your mone,
               Commaund our beſt, harme will we do you none.
            
            
               Ap.
               Good Ladies, though I hope for no reliefe,
               Ile ſhewe the ground of this my preſent griefe.
               This time of yeare, or there about it was,
               Accurſed be the time, tenne times alas:
               When I from Delphos tooke my iourney downe,
               To ſee the games in noble Sparta Towne,
               There ſaw I that, wherein I gan to ioy,
               
                  Amilchars ſonne a gallant comely boy,
               Hight (Hiacinth) full fifteene yeares of age,
               Whom I intended to haue made my Page,
               And bare as great affection to the boy,
               As euer Ioue, in Ganimede did ioy.
               Among the games, my ſelfe put in a pledge,
               To trie my ſtrength in throwing of the ſledge,
               Which poyſing with my ſtrained arme I threw
               So farre, that it beyond the other ſlew.
               My Hiacinth, delighting in the game,
               Deſierd to proue his manhood in the ſame:
               And catching ere the ſledge lay ſtill on ground,
               With violent force, aloft it did rebound
               Againſt his head, and battered out his braine:
               And ſo alas, my louely boy was ſlaine.
            
            
               1.
               Hard hap O Phoebus, but ſieth it's paſt & gone,
               We wiſh ye to forbeare this fruſtrate mone.
            
            
               Ap.
               Ladies, I know my ſorrowes are in vaine,
               And yet from mourning can I not refraine.
            
            
               1▪
               
               
                  Eurania ſome pleaſant Song ſhall ſing.
               To put ye from your dumps.
            
            
               Ap.
               Alas, no Song will bring
               The leaſt reliefe to my perplexed minde.
            
            
               2.
               No Phoebus? what other paſtime ſhal we finde,
               To make ye merry with?
            
            
               Ap.
               Faire dames I thanke you all,
               
               No ſport nor paſtime can releaſe my thrall:
               My grief's of courſe, when it the courſe hath had,
               I ſhall be merrie, and no longer ſad.
            
            
               1
               What will ye then we doo?
            
            
               Ap.
               And pleaſe ye, you may goe,
               And leaue me here to ſeed vpon my woe.
            
            
               2
               Then Phebus, we can but wiſh ye wel again.
            
            Exeunt Charites.
            
               Ap.
               I thanke ye gentle Ladies for your paine.
               O Phoebus wretched thou thus art thou faine
               With forg'de excuſes, to conceale thy paine.
               O Hyacinth, I ſuffer not theſe fits
               For thee my Boy, no, no, another ſits
               Deeper then thou, in cloſet of my breſt:
               Whoſe ſight ſo late, hath wrought me this vnreſt.
               And yet no Goddeſſe, nor of heauenly kinde
               She is, whoſe beautie thus torments my minde.
               No Fayrie Nymph, that haunts theſe pleaſaunt woods,
               No Goddeſſe of the flowres, the fields, nor floods:
               Yet ſuch an one, whom iuſtly I may call
               A Nymph, as well as any of them all.
               
                  Eurymine, what heauen affoords thee heere?
               So may I ſay, becauſe thou com'ſt ſo neere?
               And neerer far vnto a heauenly ſhape,
               Then ſhe of whom Ioue triumph't in the Rape.
               Ile ſit me downe, and wake my griefe againe,
               To ſing a while, in honour of thy name.
            
            
               The Song.
               A midſt the mountaine Ida groues,
               Where Paris kept his Heard:
               Before the other Ladies all,
               He would haue thee preferd.
               
                  Pallas for all her painting than,
               Her face would ſeeme but pale:
               Then Iuno would haue bluſht for ſhame,
               And 
                     Ʋenus looked ſtale.
               
               
                  Eurymine thy ſelfe alone,
               Shouldſt beare the golden ball:
               So far would thy moſt heauenly forme,
               Excell the other all.
               O happie Phoebus, happie then,
               Moſt happie ſhould I bee:
               If faire Eurymine would pleaſe,
               To ioyne in loue with mee.
            
            Enter Eurymine.
            
               Eu.
               Although there be ſuch difference in the chaunge,
               To liue in Court, and deſart woods to raunge,
               Yet in extremes, wherein we cannot chuſe,
               An extreame refuge is not to refuſe.
               Good gentlemen, did any ſee my heard?
               I ſhall not finde them out, I am afeard:
               And yet my maiſter wayteth with his bowe,
               Within a ſtanding, for to ſtrike a Doe.
               You ſaw them not? your ſilence makes me doubt:
               I muſt goe further, till I 
                     •
                  inde them out.
            
            
               Ap.
               What ſeek you prettie Mayde?
            
            
               Eu.
               Forſooth my heard of Deere.
            
            
               Ap.
               I ſawe them lately, but they are not heere.
            
            
               Eu.
               I pray Sir, where?
            
            
               Ap.
               An houre agoe or twaine,
               I ſawe them feeding all aboue the plaine.
            
            
               Eu.
               So much the more my toile to fetch them in.
               I thanke ye Sir.
            
            
               Ap.
               Nay ſtay ſweet Nymph with mee.
            
            
               Eu.
               My buſines, cannot ſo diſpatched bee.
            
            
               Ap.
               But pray ye Maide, it will be verie good,
               To take the ſhade, in this vnhaunted wood:
               This flowring bay with branches large and great,
               Will ſhrowd ye ſafely, from the parching heat.
            
            
               Eu.
               Good ſir, my buſines calls me hence in haſt.
            
            
               Ap.
               O ſtay with him, whō conquered thou haſt.
               With him, whoſe reſtles thoughts do beat on thee:
               
               With him that ioyes, thy wiſhed face to ſee.
               With him whoſe ioyes ſurmount all ioyes aboue:
               If thou wouldſt thinke him worthie of thy loue.
            
            
               Eu.
               Why Sir, would you deſire another make?
               And weare that garland for your Miſtres ſake?
            
            
               Ap.
               No Nymph, although I loue this lawrel tree,
               My fancy ten times more affecteth thee:
               And as the bay is alwaies freſh and greene,
               So ſhall my loue as freſh to thee be ſeene.
            
            
               Eu.
               Now truly Sir, you offer me great wrong,
               To hold me from my buſines here ſo long.
            
            
               Ap.
               O ſtay ſweet Nymph, with more aduiſement view,
               What one he is, that for thy grace doth ſue:
               I am not one that haunts on hills or Rocks,
               I am no ſhepheard wayting on my flocks.
               I am no boyſtrous Satyre, no nor Faune,
               That am with pleaſure of thy beautie drawne.
               Thou doſt not know God wot, thou doſt not kno,
               The wight, whoſe preſence thou diſdaineſt ſo.
            
            
               Eu.
               But I may know, if you wold pleaſe to tell.
            
            
               Ap.
               My father in the higheſt heauens doth dwel:
               And I am knowne the ſonne of Ioue to bee,
               Whereon the folke of Delphos honor mee.
               By me is knowne what is, what was, and what ſhall bee,
               By me are learnde the Rules of harmonie.
               By me the depth of Phiſicks lore is found:
               And power of hearbes that grow vpon the ground.
               And thus by circumſtances maiſt thou ſee,
               That I am Phoebus, who doth fancie thee.
            
            
               Eu.
               No ſir, by theſe diſcourſes may I ſee,
               You mock me with a forged pedegree.
               If ſonne you be to Ioue, as erſt ye ſaid,
               In making loue vnto a mortall maide,
               You worke diſhonour to your deitie:
               I muſt be gone: I thanke ye for your curteſie.
            
            
               Ap.
               Alas, abandon not thy Louer ſo.
            
            
               
               Eu.
               I pray ſir hartily, giue me leaue to goe.
            
            
               Ap.
               The way ore-growne, with ſhrubs and buſhes thick,
               The ſharpned thornes, your tender feete will prick.
               The brambles round about, your traine will lappe,
               The burs and briers, about your skirts will wrappe.
            
            
               Eu.
               If Phoebus, thou of Ioue the ofspring be,
               Diſhonor not thy deitie ſo much,
               With profered force, a ſilly mayd to touch:
               For doing ſo, although a god thou bee,
               The earth, and men on earth, ſhall ring thy infamie.
            
            
               Ap.
               Hard ſpeech to him that loueth thee ſo well.
            
            
               Eu.
               What know I that?
            
            
               Ap.
               I know it, and can tell: and feele it too.
            
            
               Eu.
               If that your loue be ſuch,
               As you pretend, ſo feruent and ſo much,
               For proofe thereof, graunt me but one requeſt.
            
            
               Ap.
               I will, by Ioue my father, I proteſt:
               Prouided firſt, that thy petition bee,
               Not hurtfull to thy ſelfe, nor harme to mee.
               For ſo ſometimes did Phaeton my ſonne,
               Requeſt a thing, whereby he was vndonne.
               He loſt his life through crauing it, and I
               Through graunting it, loſt him my ſonne thereby.
            
            
               Eu.
               Then Phoebus thus it is, if thou be hee,
               That art pretended in thy pedegree,
               If ſonne thou be to Ioue as thou doeſt faine,
               And chalengeſt that tytle not in vaine:
               Now heer bewray ſome ſigne of godhead than?
               And chaunge me ſtraight, from ſhape of mayd to man?
            
            
               Ap.
               Alas, what fond deſire doth moue thy minde
               To wiſh thee altered from thy natiue kinde?
               If thou in this thy womans forme canſt moue,
               Not men but gods, to ſue and ſeeke thy loue:
               Content thy ſelfe with natures bountie than,
               And couet not to beare the ſhape of man.
               And this moreouer will I ſay to thee,
               Fairer man then may de, thou ſhalt neuer bee.
            
            
               
               Eu.
               Theſe vaine excuſes, manifeſtly ſhowe,
               Whether you vſurp Appollos name or no.
               Sith my demaund ſo far ſurmounts your Art,
               Ye ioyne exceptions, on the other part.
            
            
               Ap.
               Nay then my doubtles Deitie to proue,
               Although thereby for euer I looſe my Loue,
               I graunt thy wiſh, thou art become a man:
               I ſpeake no more, then well performe I can.
               And though thou walke in chaunged bodie now,
               This pennance ſhall be added to thy vow:
               Thy ſelfe a man, ſhalt loue a man, in vaine:
               And louing, wiſh to be a maide againe.
            
            
               Eu.
               
                  Appollo, whether I loue a man or not,
               I thanke ye, now I will accept my lot:
               And ſith my chaunge hath diſappointed you,
               Ye are at libertie to loue anew.
            
            Exit.
            
               Ap.
               If euer I loue, ſith now I am forſaken,
               Where next I loue, it ſhall be better taken:
               But what ſo ere my fate in louing bee,
               Yet thou maiſt vaunt, that Phoebus loued thee.
            
            Exit Appollo.
            Enter Ioculo, Friſco, and Mopſo, at three
ſeuerall doores.
            
               Mop.
               
                  Ioculo, whither ietteſt thou?
               Haſt thou found thy Maiſter?
            
            
               Io.
               
                  Mopſo wel met, haſt thou found thy miſtreſſe?
            
            
               Mop.
               Not I by Pan.
            
            
               Io.
               Nor I by Pot.
            
            
               Mop.
               Pot? what god's that?
            
            
               Io.
               The next god to a Pan, and ſuch a pot it may be,

As he ſhall haue moe ſeruants then all the Pannes in a Tinkers
ſhop.
            
            
               Mop.
               
                  Friſco, where haſt thou bene frisking? haſt thou

               Friſ.
               I haue found.
            
            
               Io.
               What haſt thou found Friſco?
               
            
            
               Friſ.
               A couple of crack-roapes.
            
            
               Io.
               And I.
            
            
               Mop.
               And I.
            
            
               Friſ.
               I meane you two.
            
            
               Io.

               Mop.
               And I you two.
            
            
               Friſ.
               Come, a trebble coniunction: all three, all three.
            
            They all imbrace each other.
            
               Mop.
               But Friſco, haſt not found the faire ſhepheardeſſe,
thy Maiſters Miſtreſſe?
            
            
               Friſ.
               Not I by God, Priapus I meane.
            
            
               Io.
               
                  Priapus quoth a? Whattin a God might that bee?
            
            
               Friſ.
               A plaine God, with a good peg to hang a ſhepheardreſſe
bottle vpon.
            
            
               Io.
               Thou being a Forreſters Boy, ſhouldſt ſweare by the
God of the woods.
            
            
               Friſ.
               My Maiſter ſweares by Siluanus, I muſt ſweare by
his poore neighbour.
            
            
               Io.
               And heer

                  s a ſhepheards ſwaine, ſweares by a Kitchen
God, Pan.
               
            
            
               Mop.
               
                  Pan's the ſhepheardes God, but thou ſweareſt by
Pot, what God's that?
            
            
               Io.
               The God of good-fellowſhip: well, you haue wicked
Maiſters, that teach ſuch little Boyes as you are to ſweare ſo
young.
            
            
               Friſ.
               Alas good old great man, wil nor your maſter ſwear?
            
            
               Io.
               I neuer heard him ſweare ſix ſound oaths in all my life.
            
            
               Mop.
               May hap he cannot, becauſe hees diſeaſd.
            
            
               Friſ.
               Peace Mopſo, I will ſtand toot, hee's neither braue
Courtier, bouncing Caualier, nor boone Companion, if he

ſweare not ſometime: for they will ſweare, forſweare, and
ſweare.
            
            
               Io.
               How? ſweare, forſweare, and ſweare? how is that?
            
            
               Friſ.
               They'le ſweare at dyce, forſweare their debts:
And ſweare when they looſe their labour in loue.
            
            
               Io.
               Well, your maiſters haue much to anſwere for, that
bring ye vp ſo wickedly.
            
            
               Friſ.
               Nay my maiſter is damn'd Ile be ſworne, for his very
ſoule burnes in the firie eye of his faire miſtreſſe.
            
            
               Mop.
               My maiſter is not damn'd, but he is dead, for he hath
buried his ioyes in the boſome of his faire miſtreſſe.
            
            
               Io.
               My maiſter is neither damnde nor dead, and yet is in
the caſe of both your maiſters: like a woodden ſhepheard,
and a ſheepiſh wood-man, for he is loſt in ſeeking of a loſt
ſheepe, and ſpent in hunting a Doe that hee would faine
ſtrike.
            
            
               Friſ.
               Faith and I am founderd with flinging too and fro,
with Cheſ-nuts, Hazel-nuts, Bullaze, and wildings, for preſents
from my maiſter to the faire ſhepherdeſſe.
            
            
               Mop.
               And I am tierd like a Calfe, with carrying a Kidde
euery weeke to the Cottage of my maiſters ſweete Lambkin.
            
            
               Io.
               I am not tierd, but ſo wearie I cannot goe, with following
a maiſter, that followes his miſtreſſe, that followes her
ſhadow, that followes the ſunne, that followes his courſe.
            
            
               Friſ.
               That follows the colt, that followed the mare, the
man rode on to Midleton: ſhall I ſpeake a wiſe word?
            
            
               Mop.
               Do and wee will burne our caps.
            
            
               Friſ.
               Are not we fooles?
            
            
               Io.
               Is that a wiſe word?
            
            
               Friſ.
               Giue me leaue: are not we fooles to weare our yong
feete to old ſtumps, when there dwells a cunning man in a
Caue hereby, who for a bunch of rootes, a bagge of nuts, or
a buſhell of crabs, will tell vs, where thou ſhalt finde thy maiſter,
and which of our maiſters ſhall win the wenches fauour?
            
            
               Io.
               Bring me to him Friſco, Ile giue him all the poynts at

my hoſe, to poynt me right to my maiſter.
            
            
               Mop.
               A bottle of whey ſhall be his meed, if he ſaue me labour
for poſting with preſents.
            
            Enter Aramanthus, with his Globe, &c.
            
               Friſ.
               Here he comes, offend him not Ioculo,
               
               For feare he turne thee to a Iacke an Apes.
            
            
               Mop.
               And thee to an Owle.
            
            
               Io.
               And thee to a Wood-cocke.
            
            
               Friſ.
               A Wood-cocke, an Owle, and an Ape?
            
            
               Mop.
               A long bill, a broade face, and no tayle?
            
            
               Io.
               Kiſſe it Mopſo, and be quiet, Ile ſalute him ciuilly.
               Good ſpeed good man.
            
            
               Aram.
               Welcome bad boy.
            
            
               Friſ.
               He ſpeakes to thee Ioculo.
               
            
            
               Io.
               Meaning thee Friſco.
               
            
            
               Aram.
               I ſpeake, and meane not him, nor him, nor thee,
               But ſpeaking ſo, I ſpeake and meane, all three.
            
            
               Io.
               If ye be good at Rimes and Riddles old man, expound
me this.
               Theſe two ſerue two, thoſe two ſerue one,
               Aſſoyle me this, and I am gone.

               You three ſerue three, thoſe three do ſeeke to one,

               Io.
               This is a wiſe anſwer: her going cauſd his comming,
               For if ſhe had nere gone he had nere come.
            
            
               Mop.
               Good maiſter wizard, leaue theſe murlemewes, and

               Io.

thankes: for we Courtiers, neither giue nor take bribes.
            
            
               Aram.
               I take your meaning better then your ſpeech,
               And I will graunt the thing you doo beſeech:
               But for the teares of Louers be no toyes,
               Ile tell their chaunce in parables to Boyes.
            
            
               Friſ.
               In what ye will, lets heare our maiſters luck.
            
            
               Aram.
               Thy maiſters Doe, ſhall turne vnto a Buck.
               To Mopſo.
               Thy maiſters Eawe, be chaunged to a Ram,
               To Ioculo.
               Thy maiſter ſeeks a maide, and findes a man.
               Yet for his labor ſhall he gaine his meede,
               The other two ſhall ſigh, to ſee him ſpeede.
            
            
               Mop.
               Then my maiſter ſhall not win the ſhepheardeſſe?
            
            
               Aram.
               No: haſt thee home, and bid him right his wrong,
               The ſhepheardeſſe wil leaue his flock ere long.
            
            
               Mop.
               Ile run to warne my maſter of that.
            
            Exit.
            
               Friſ.
               My maiſter wood-man, takes but woodden paines
to no purpoſe I thinke, what ſay ye, ſhall he ſpeede?
            
            
               Aram.
               No: tell him ſo, and bid him tend his Deare:
               And ceaſe to woe, he ſhall not wed this yeare.
            
            
               Friſ.
               I am not ſorie for it, farewell Ioculo.
               
            
            Exit.
            
               Io.
               I may goe with thee, for I ſhall ſpeed euen ſo too, by
ſtaying behinde.
            
            
               Aram.
               Better my Boy, thou ſhalt thy maiſter finde,
               And he ſhall finde the partie he requires:
               And yet not finde the ſumme of his deſires.
               Keep on that way, thy maiſter walkes before,
               Whom when thou find'ſt, looſe him good Boy no more.
            
            Exit ambo.
         
         
            
            Act. 4.
            Enter Aſcanio, and Ioculo.
            
               Aſca.
               Shall then my trauell euer endles proue?
               That I can heare no tydings of my Loue?
               In neither deſart, groue, nor ſhadie wood,
               Nor obſcure thicket, where my foote hath trod?
               But euery plough-man, and rude ſhepheard ſwain,
               Doth ſtill reply vnto my greater paine?
               Some Satyre then, or Goddeſſe of this place,
               Some water Nymph, vouchſafe me ſo much grace
               As by ſome view, ſome ſigne, or other ſho,
               I may haue knowledge if ſhe liue or no.
            
            
               Eccho.
               No.
            
            
               Aſca.
               Then my poore hart is buried too in wo:
               Record it once more, if the truth be ſo?
            
            
               Eccho.
               So.
            
            
               Aſca.
               How, that Eurymine is dead, or liues?

               Liues.
            
            
               Aſca.
               Now gentle Goddeſſe thou redeem'ſt my ſoule
               From death to life: Oh tell me quickly where?
            
            
               Eccho.
               Where?
            
            
               Aſca.
               In ſome remote far region, or elſe neere?

               Neere.

               Oh what conceales her from my thirſtie eies?
               Is it reſtraint? or ſome vnknowne diſguiſe?
            
            
               Eccho.
               Diſguiſe.

               Stay Ioculo, it is the Eccho Boy,
               That mocks our griefe, and laughes at our annoy.
               Hard by this groue there is a goodly plaine
               Betwixt two hils, ſtill freſh with drops of raine:
               Where neuer ſpreading Oake nor Poplar grew,
               Might hinder the proſpect or other view,
               But all the country that about it lyes,
               Preſents it ſelfe vnto our mortall eyes:
               Saue that vpon each hill, by leauie trees,
               The Sun at higheſt, his ſcorching heat may leeſe.
               There languiſhing my ſelfe I will betake,
               As heauen ſhall pleaſe, and only for her ſake.
            
            
               Io.
               Stay maiſter, I haue ſpied the fellow now, that mockt
               vs all this while: ſee where he ſits.
            
            Aramanthus ſitting.
            
               Aſca.
               The very ſhape my Viſion told me off,
               That I ſhould meet with as I ſtrayd this way.
            
            
               Io.
               What lynes he drawes? beſt go not ouer farre.
            
            
               Aſca.
               Let me alone, thou doeſt but trouble mee.
            
            
               Io.
               Youle trouble vs all annon, ye ſhall ſee.

               God ſpeed faire Sir.
            
            
               Io.
               My Lord doo ye not marke?
               How the skie thickens, and begins to darke?
            
            
               Aſca.
               Health to ye Sir.
            
            
               Io.
               Nay then God be our ſpeed.
            
            
               Ara.
               Forgiue me Sir, I ſawe ye not indeed.
            
            
               Aſca.
               Pardon me rather, for moleſting you.
            
            
               Io.
               Such another face I neuer knew.
            
            
               Ara.
               Thus ſtudious I am wont to paſſe the time,
               By true proportion, of each line from line.
            
            
               Io.
               Oh now I ſee he was learning to ſpell,
               Theres A. B. C. in midſt of his table.
            
            
               
               Aſca.
               Tel me I pray ye ſir, may I be bold to craue
               The cauſe of your abode within this Caue?
            
            
               Ara.
               To tell you that in this extreme diſtreſſe,
               Were but a tale of Fortunes fickleneſſe.
               Sometime I was a Prince of Lesbos Ile,
               And liu'd belou'd, whilſt my good ſtars did ſmile:
               But clowded once with this worlds bitter croſſe,
               My ioy to grife, my gaine conuerts to loſſe.
            
            
               Aſca.
               Forward I pray ye, faint not in your tale.
            
            
               Io.
               It will not all be worth a cup of Ale.
            
            
               Ara.
               A ſhort diſcourſe of that which is too long
               How euer pleaſing, can neuer ſeeme but wrong:
               Yet would my tragicke ſtory fit the ſtage,
               Pleaſaunt in youth, but wretched in mine age.
               Blinde Fortune ſetting vp and pulling downe,
               A buſde by thoſe my ſelfe raiſde to renowne:
               But yt
                   which wrings me neer, and wounds my hart,
               Is a falſe brothers baſe vnthankfull part.
            
            
               Aſc.
               A ſmal offence comparde with my diſeaſe,
               No doubt ingratitude in time may ceaſe
               And be forgot: my grief out-liues all howres:
               Raining on my head, continual hapleſſe ſhowers.
            
            
               Ara.
               You ſing of yours, and I of mine relate:
               To euery one, ſeemes worſt his owne eſtate.
               But to proceed, exiled thus by ſpight,
               Both country I forgoe, and brothers ſight:
               And comming hither where I thought to liue,
               Yet here I cannot but lament and greeue.
            
            
               Aſca.
               Some comfort yet in this there doth remaine:
               That you haue found a partner in your paine.
            
            
               Ara.
               How are your ſorrowes ſubiect, let me heare?
            
            
               Aſca.
               More ouerthrowne, and deeper in diſpaire
               Than is the manner of your heauie ſmart,
               My cureleſſe griefe, doth ranckle at my hart.
               And in a word, to heare the ſumme of all,
               I loue, and am belou'd: but there-withall
               
               The ſweetneſſe of that banquet muſt forgo,
               Whoſe pleaſant taſt is chaungde with bitter wo.
            
            
               Ara.
               A conflict, but to try your noble minde,
               As common vnto youth, as raine to winde.
            
            
               Aſca.
               But hence it it that doth me treble wrong,
               Expected good, that is forborne ſo long:
               Doth looſe the vertue which the vſe would proue.
            
            
               Ara.
               Are you then ſir, deſpiſed of your Loue?
            
            
               Aſca.
               No, but depriued of her company.
               And for my careles negligence therein:
               Am bound to doo this penaunce for my ſin.
               That if I neuer finde where ſhe remaines,
               I vowe a yeare ſhalbe my end of paines.
            
            
               Ara.
               Was ſhe then loſt within this Forreſt here?
            
            
               Aſc.
               Loſt or forlorn, to me ſhe was right deere.
               And this is certaine, vnto him that could
               The place where ſhe abides to me vnfold:
               For euer I would vow my ſelfe his friend,
               Neuer reuolting till my life did end.
               And therefore ſir, (as well I know your skill)
               If you will giue me phiſicke for this ill,
               And ſhewe me if Eurymine do liue,
               It were a recompence for all my paine,
               And I ſhould thinke my ioyes were full againe.
            
            
               Ara.
               They know the want of health that haue bene ſick,
               My ſelfe ſometime acquainted with the like,
               Do learne in dutie of a kinde regard,
               To pittie him whoſe hap hath bene ſo hard.
               How long I pray ye hath ſhe abſent beene?
            
            
               Aſca.
               Three dayes it is ſince that my Loue was ſeene.

               Ara.
               I cannot tell what reaſon it ſhould bee,
               But loue and reaſon here doo diſagree.
               By proofe of learned principles I finde,
               The manner of your loue's againſt all kinde.
               And not to feed ye with vncertaine ioy,
               Whom you affect ſo much, is but a Boy.
            
            
               Io.
               A Riddle for my life, ſome Antick Ieſt▪
               
               Did I not tell ye what his cunning was?
            
            
               Aſca.
               I loue a Boy?
            
            
               Ara.
               Mine Art doth tell me ſo.
            
            
               Aſca.
               Adde not a freſh increaſe vnto my woe.
            
            
               Ara.
               I dare auouch what lately I haue ſaide,
               The loue that troubles you, is for no maide.
            
            
               Aſca.
               As well I might be ſaid to touch the skie,
               Or darke the horizon with tapeſtrie:
               Or walke vpon the waters of the ſea,
               As to be haunted with ſuch lunacie.
            
            
               Ara.
               If it be falſe, mine Art I will defie.
            
            
               Aſca.
               Amaz'de with griefe, my loue is then transform'd.
            
            
               Io.
               Maiſter be contented, this is leape yeare.
               Women weare breetches, petticoats are deare.
               And thats his meaning, on my life it is.
            
            
               Aſc.
               Oh God, and ſhal my torments neuer ceaſe?
            
            
               Ara.
               Repreſſe the fury of your troubled minde:
               Walke here a while, your Lady you may finde.
            
            
               Io.
               A Lady and a Boy, this hangs wel together:
               Like ſnow in harueſt, ſun-ſhine and foule weather.
               Enter Eurymine ſinging.
               Since hope of helpe my froward ſtarres denie,
               Come ſweeteſt death, and end my miſerie.
               He left his country, I my ſhape haue loſt,
               Deare is the loue, that hath ſo dearly coſt.
            
            
               Eu.
               Yet can I boaſt, though Phoebus were vniuſt
               This ſhift did ſerue, to barre him from his luſt.
               But who are theſe alone? I cannot chuſe
               But bluſh for ſhame, that any one ſhould ſee,
               
                  Eurymine in this diſguiſe to bee.
            
            
               
               Aſca.
               It is, it is not my loue, Eurymine.
               
            
            
               Eury.
               Hark ſome one hallows: gentlemen adiew,

            Exit.
            
               Aſca.
               My loue, my ioy, my life,
               By eye, by face, by tongue, it ſhould be ſhee.
               Oh I, it was my loue, Ile after her,
               And though ſhe paſſe the Eagle in her flight,
               Ile neuer reſt, till I haue gain'd her ſight.
            
            Exit.
            
               Ara.
               Loue carries him, and ſo retains his mind,
               That he forgets how I am left behind:
               Yet will I follow ſoftly, as I can.
               In hope to ſee the fortune of the man.
            
            Exit.
            
               Io.
               Nay let them go a Gods name, one by one,
               With my heart I am glad to be alone.
               Heres old tranſforming, would with all his Art,
               He could tranſforme this tree into a tart.
               See then if I would flinch from hence or no:
               But for it is not ſo, I needs muſt go.
            
            Exit.
            
               Enter Siluio and Gemulo.
            
               Sil.
               Is it a bargaine Gemulo, or not?
            
            
               Ge.
               Thou neuer knew'ſt me breake my word I wot,
               Nor will I now, betide me bale or blis.
            
            
               Sil.
               Nor I breake mine, and here her cottage is:
               Ile call her forth.
            
            
               Ge.
               Will Siluio be ſo rude?
            
            
               Sil.
               Neuer ſhall we betwixt our ſelues conclude
               Our controuerſie, for we ouer weene.
            
            
               Ge.
               Not I, but thou, for though thou iet'ſt in greene,
               As freſh as Meadow in a morne of May,
               And ſcorn'ſt the ſhepheard, for he goes in gray.
               But Forreſter, beleeue it as thy Creede,
               My miſtreſſe mindes my perſon, not my weede.
            
            
               
               Sil.
               So 'twas I thought, becauſe ſhe tends thy ſheepe
               Thou thinkſt in loue of thee ſhe taketh keepe:
               That is as towniſh damzels ſend the hand,
               But ſend the heart to him a looſe doth ſtand.
               So deales Eurymine with Siluto.
               
            
            
               Ge.
               Albe ſhe looke more blithe on Gemulo,
               
               Her heart is in the dyall of her eye,
               That poynts me her
                     •
                  .
            
            
               Sil.
               That ſhall we quickly trye.
               
                  Eurymine.
               
            
            
               Ge.
               
                  Erynnis ſtop thy throte,
               Vnto thy hound thou hallowſt ſuch a note:
               I thought that ſhepheards had bene mannerleſſe,
               But Wood-men are the ruder groomes I gueſſe.
            
            
               Sil.
               How ſhuld I cal her Swain, but by her name?
            
            
               Ge.
               So Hobinoll the plow-man, calls his dame.
               Call her in Carroll from her quiet coate.
            
            
               Sil.
               Agreed: but whether ſhall begin his note.
            
            
               Ge.
               Draw cuttes.
            
            
               Sil.
               Content, the longeſt ſhall begin.
            
            
               Ge.
               Tis mine.
            
            
               Sil.
               Sing loude, for ſhe is farre within.
            
            
               Ge.
               Inſtruct thy ſinging in thy Forreſt waies.
               Shepheards know how to chant their roundelaies.
            
            
               Sil.
               Repeat our bargain, ere we ſing our Song,
               Leaſt after wrangling, ſhould our miſtreſſe wrong.
               If me ſhe chuſe, thou muſt be well content:
               If thee ſhe chuſe, I giue the like conſent.
            
            
               Ge.
               Tis done: now Pan pipe on thy ſweeteſt Reede,
               And as I loue, ſo let thy ſeruaunt ſpeede.
               As little Lambes lift vp their ſnowie ſides,
               When mounting Larke ſalutes the gray-eyed morne:
            
            
               Sil.
               As from the Oaken leaues the honie glides,
               Where Nightingales record vpon the thorne.
            
            
               Ge.
               So riſe my thoughts.
            
            
               Sil.
               So all my ſences cheere.
            
            
               
               Ge.
               When ſhe ſurueyes my flocks.

               And ſhe my Deare.

               Sil.
               Eurymine.

               Come foorth and cheere theſe plaines.
            
            And both ſing this togither, when they haue
ſung it ſingle.
            
               Sil.
               The Wood-mans Loue.
            
            
               Ge.
               And Lady of the Swaynes.
            
            Enter Eurymine.
            
               Faire Foreſter and louely ſhepheard Swaine,
               Your Carrolls call Eurymine in vaine:
               For ſhe is gone, her Cottage and her ſheepe,
               With me her brother, hath ſhe left to keepe:
               And made me ſweare by Pan▪
                   ere ſhe did go,
               To ſee them ſafely kept, for Gemulo.
               
            
            They both looke ſtraungely vpon her, apart
each from other.
            
               Ge.
               What? hath my Loue a new come Louer than▪

               Ge.
               This Swayne will rob me of Eurymine.
               
            
            
               Sil.
               This youth hath power to win Eurymine.
               
            
            
               Ge.
               This ſtraungers beautie beares away my prize.
            
            
               Sil.
               This ſtraunger will bewitch her with his eies.
            
            
               Ge.
               It is Adonis.
               
            
            
               Sil.
               It is Ganymede.
               
            
            
               Ge.
               My blood is chill.

               My heart is cold as Leade.

               Ge.
               The more too blame.
            
            
               Eu.
               Not ſo, my ſiſter had no will to go:
               But that our parents dread commaund was ſo.

               It is thy ſcuſe, thou art not of her kin,

               But ſhe is gone, her flocke is left to mee.

               Prone to reueale what ſecret ſhe doth know,
               God pardon me, I was about to ſhow
               My transformation: peace they come againe.
            
            Enter Siluio, and Gemulo.

               Vnto a Wiſe-man wonning in this wood,
               Hight Aramanth, whoſe wit and skill is good:
               That he may certifie our mazing doubt,
               How this ſtraunge chaunce and chaunge hath fallen out.
            
            
               Eu.
               I am content: haue with ye, when ye will.
            
            
               Sil.
               Euen now.
            
            
               Eu.
               Hee'le make ye muſe, if he haue any skill.
            
            Exeunt.
         
         
            Act. 5.
            Enter Aſcanio, and Eurymine.
            
               Aſca.
               
                  Eurymine, I pray if thou be ſhee,
               Refraine thy haſte, and doo not flie from mee.
               
               The time hath bene my words thou wouldſt allow,
               And am I growne ſo loathſome to thee now?
            
            
               Eu.
               
                  Aſcanio, time hath bene I muſt confeſſe,
               When in thy preſence was my happineſſe:
               But now the manner of my miſerie,
               Hath chaung'd that courſe, that ſo it cannot be.
            
            
               Aſca.
               What wrong haue I contriued? what iniurie
               To alienate thy liking ſo from me?
               If thou be ſhe whom ſometime thou didſt faine,
               And beareſt not the name of friend in vaine,
               Let not thy borrowed guiſe of altred kinde,
               Alter the wonted liking of thy minde:
               But though in habit of a man thou goeſt,
               Yet be the ſame Eurymine thou waſt.
            
            
               Eu.
               How gladly would I be thy Lady ſtill,
               If earneſt vowes might anſwere to my will?
            
            
               Aſca.
               And is thy fancie alterd with thy guiſe?
            
            
               Eu.
               My kinde, but not my minde in any wiſe.
            
            
               Aſca.
               What though thy habit differ from thy kind:
               Thou maieſt retain thy wonted louing mind.
            
            
               Eu.
               And ſo I doo.
            
            
               Aſca.
               Then why art thou ſo ſtraunge?
               Or wherefore doth thy plighted fancie chaunge?
            
            
               Eu.
               
                  Aſcanio, my heart doth honor thee.
            
            
               Aſc.
               And yet continueſt ſtil ſo ſtrange to me?
            
            
               Eu.
               Not ſtrange, ſo far as kind wil giue me leaue.
            
            
               Aſca.
               Vnkind that kind, that kindneſſe doth bereaue:
               Thou ſaiſt thou loueſt me.
            
            
               Eu.
               As a friend his friend:
               And ſo I vowe to loue thee to the end.
            
            
               Aſca.
               I wreake not of ſuch loue, loue me but ſo
               As faire Eurymine lou'd Aſcanio.
               
            
            
               Eu.
               That loue's denide vnto my preſent kinde.
            
            
               Aſca.
               In kindly ſhewes, vnkinde I doo thee finde:
               I ſee thou art as conſtant as the winde.
            
            
               
               Eu.
               Doth kind allow a man to loue a man?
            
            
               Aſca.
               Why art not thou Eurymine?
               
            
            
               Eu.
               I am.
            
            
               Aſca.
               
                  Eurymine my Loue?
            
            
               Eu.
               The very ſame.
            
            
               Aſca.
               And waſt not thou a woman then?
            
            
               Eu.
               Moſt true.
            
            
               Aſ.
               And art thou changed from a woman now?
            
            
               Eu.
               Too true.
            
            
               Aſc.
               Theſe tales my mind perplex: thou art Eurymine.
               
            
            
               Eu.
               In name, but not in ſexe.
            
            
               Aſca.
               What then?
            
            
               Eu.
               A man.
            
            
               Aſca.
               In guiſe thou art I ſee.
            
            
               Eu.
               The guiſe thou ſeeſt, doth with my kinde agree.
            
            
               Aſca.
               Before thy flight thou waſt a woman tho.
            
            
               Eu.
               True Aſcanio.
               
            
            
               Aſca.
               And ſince art thou a man?
            
            
               Eu.
               Too true deare friend.
            
            
               Aſca.
               Then haue I loſt a wife.
            
            
               Eu.
               But found a friend, whoſe deareſt blood and life,
               Shalbe as readie as thine owne for thee:
               In place of wife, ſuch friend thou haſt of mee.
            
            Enter Ioculo, and Aramanthus.
            
               Io.
               I here they are: maiſter well ouertane.
               
                  I thought we two ſhould neuer meete againe:
               You went ſo faſt, that I to follow ye,
               Slipt ouer hedge and ditch, and many a tall tree.
            
            
               Ara.
               Well ſaid my Boy, thou knoweſt not how to lie.
            
            
               Io.
               To lye Sir? how ſay you was it not ſo?
               You were at my heeles, though farre off, ye know:
               For maiſter, not to counterfayt with ye now,
               Hee's as good a footeman as a ſhackeld ſow.
            
            
               Aſca.
               Good Sir y'are welcome, ſirrha hold your prate.
            
            
               Ara.
               What ſpeed in that I told to you of late?
            
            
               
               Aſca.
               Both good and bad, as doth the ſequell proue,
               For (wretched) I haue found, and loſt my Loue.
               If that be loſt which I can nere enioy.
            
            
               Io.
               Faith Miſtreſſe y'are too blame to be ſo coy.
               The day hath bene, but what is that to mee:
               When more familiar with a man you'ld bee.
            
            
               Ara.
               I told ye you ſhould finde a man of her:
               Or elſe my rule did very ſtraungely erre.
            
            
               Aſca.
               Father, the triall of your skill I finde,
               My Loue's transformde into another kinde:
               And ſo I finde, and yet haue loſt my Loue.
            
            
               Io.
               Ye cannot tell, take her aſide and proue.
            
            
               Aſca.
               But ſweet Eurymine make ſome report
               Why thou departedſt from my fathers Court?
               And how this ſtraunge miſhap to thee befell,
               Let me intreat thou wouldſt the proceſſe tell.
            
            
               Eu.
               To ſhew how I arriued in this ground,
               Were but renewing of an auncient wound:
               Another time that office ile fulfill,
               Let it ſuffice, I came againſt my will.
               And wandring here about this Forreſt ſide,
               It was my chaunce of Phoebus to be ſpide.
               Whoſe loue becauſe I chaſtly did withſtand,
               He thought to offer me a violent hand.
               But for a preſent ſhift to ſhun his rape,
               I wiſht my ſelfe transformde into this ſhape:
               Which he perform'd (God knowes) againſt his wil:
               And I ſince then, haue wayld my fortune ſtill.
               Not for miſliking ought I finde in mee,
               But for thy ſake, whoſe wife I meant to bee.
            
            
               Aſca.
               Thus haue you heard our woful deſtenie,
               Which I in heart lament, and ſo doth ſhe.
            
            
               Ara.
               The fitteſt remedie that I can finde,
               Is this, to eaſe the torment of your minde.
               Perſwade your ſelues that great Apollo can,
               As eaſily make a woman of a man,
               
               As contrariwiſe he made a man of her.
            
            
               Aſca.
               I thinke no leſſe.
            
            
               Ara.
               Then humble ſuite preferre
               To him: perhaps your prayers may attaine,
               To haue her turnd into her forme againe.
            
            
               Eu.
               But Phoebus ſuch diſdain to me doth beare,
               As hardly we ſhall win his graunt I feare.
            
            
               Ara.
               Then in theſe verdant fields al richly dide,
               With natures gifts, and Floras painted pride:
               There is a goodly ſpring whoſe chriſtal ſtreames
               Beſet with myrtles, keepe backe Phoebus beames:
               There in rich ſeates all wrought of Iuory,
               The Graces ſit, liſtening the melodye:
               The warbling Birds doo from their prettie billes
               Vnite in concord, as the brooke diſtilles.
               Whoſe gentle murmure with his buzzing noates,
               Is as a baſe vnto their hollow throates.
               Garlands beſide they weare vpon their browes,
               Made of all ſorts of flowers earth allowes:
               From whence ſuch fragrant ſweet perfumes ariſe,
               As you would ſweare that place is Paradiſe.
               To them let vs repaire with humble hart,
               And meekly ſhew the manner of your ſmart:
               So gratious are they in Apollos eies,
               As their intreatie quickly may ſuffice.
               In your behalfe, Ile tell them of your ſtates,
               And craue their aides, to ſtand your aduocates.
            
            
               Aſca.
               For euer you ſhall bind vs to you than.
            
            
               Ara.
               Come go with me: Ile doo the beſt I can.
            
            
               Io.
               Is not this hard luck to wander ſo long,
               And in the end to finde his wife markt wrong.
            
            Enter Phylander.
            
               A proper ieſt as euer I heard tell,
               In ſooth, me thinks the breech becomes her well:
               And might it not make their husbands feare then,
               Wold all the wiues in our town might wear them.
               
               Tell me youth, art a ſtraunger here or no?
            
            
               Io.
               Is your commiſſion ſir, to examine me ſo?
            
            
               Phy.
               What is it thou? now by my troth wel met.
            
            
               Io.
               By your leaue, it's well ouertaken yet.
            
            
               Phy.
               I litle thought I ſhould a found thee here.
            
            
               Io.
               Perhaps ſo ſir.
            
            
               Phy.
               I prethee ſpeake, what cheere?
            
            
               Io.
               What cheere can here be hopte for in theſe woods?
               Except trees, ſtones, bryars, buſhes, or buddes?
            
            
               Phy.
               My meaning is, I faine would heare thee ſay,
               How thou doeſt man, why thou tak'ſt this another way.
            
            
               Io.
               Why then ſir, I doo as well as I may.
               And to perſwade ye, that welcome ye bee,
               Wilt pleaſe ye ſir, to eate a crab with mee?
            
            
               Phy.
               Beleeue me Ioculo, reaſonable hard cheere.
            
            
               Io.
               
                  Phylander, tis the beſt we can get heere.
               But when returne ye to the Court againe?
            
            
               Phy.
               Shortly, now I haue found thee.
            
            
               Io.
               To requite your paine,
               Shall I intreat you beare a preſent from me?
            
            
               Phy.
               To whom?
            
            
               Io.
               To the Duke.
            
            
               Phy.
               What ſhall it be?
            
            
               Io.
               Becauſe Venſon ſo conuenient doth not fall,
               A pecke of Acornes to make merry withall.
            
            
               Phy.
               What meaneſt thou by that?
            
            
               Io.
               By my troth ſir as ye ſee,
               Acornes are good enough for ſuch as hee.
               I wiſh his honour well, and to doo him good:
               Would he had eaten all the Acorns in th'wood.
            
            
               Phy.
               Good words Ioculo, of your Lord & mine.
            
            
               Io.
               As may agree with ſuch a churliſh ſwine.
               How dooes his honor?
            
            
               Phy.
               Indifferently well.
            
            
               Io.
               I wiſh him better.
            
            
               Phy.
               How?
            
            
               
               Io.
               Vice-gerent in hell.
            
            
               Phy.
               Doeſt thou wiſh ſo, for ought that he hath done?
            
            
               Io.
               I for the loue he beares vnto his ſonne.
            
            
               Phy.
               Hees growne of late, as fatherly and milde,
               As euer father was vnto his childe:
               And ſent me forth to ſearch the coaſt about,
               If ſo my hap might be to finde him out.
               And if Eurymine aliue remaine,
               To bring them both vnto the Court againe.
               Where is thy maiſter?
            
            
               Io.
               Walking about the ground.
            
            
               Phy.
               Oh that his Loue Eurymine were found.
            
            
               Io.
               Why ſo ſhe is, come follow me and ſee.
               Ile bring ye ſtrait where they remaining bee.
               Exeunt.
            
            Enter three or foure Muſes, Aramanthus,
Aſcanio, Siluio, and Gemulo.
            
               Aſca.
               Ceaſe your contention for Eurymine.
               
               Nor words, nor vowes, can helpe her miſerie:
               But he it is that did her firſt transforme,
               Muſt calme the gloomy rigor of this ſtorme:
               Great Phoebus, whoſe Pallace we are neere,
               Salute him then in his celeſtiall ſphere:
               That with the notes of cheerfull harmonie,
               He may be mou'd to ſhewe his Deitie.
            
            
               Sil.
               But wheres Eurymine, haue we loſt her ſight?
            
            
               Aſ.
               Poore ſoule, within a caue, with fear affright
               She ſits▪ to ſhun Apollos angry view,
               Vntill ſhe ſee what of our prayers enſue:
               If we can reconcile his loue or no,
               Or that ſhe muſt continue in her woe.
            
            
               1. Mu.
               Once haue we tried Aſcanio, for thy ſake
               And once againe we will his power awake:
               Not doubting but as he is of heauenly race,
               
                  
At length he will take pitie on her caſe.
               Sing therefore, and each partie from his heart,
               In this our muſicke, beare a chearefull part.
            
            
               Song.
               All haile faire Phoebus, in thy purple throne,
               Vouchſafe the regarding of our deepe mone.
               Hide not, oh hide not, thy comfortable face,
               But pittie, but pittie, a virgins poore caſe.
            
            Phoebus appeares.
            
               1. Muſe.
               Illuſtrate bewtie, Chriſtall heauens eye,
               Once more we do entreat thy clemencie:
               That as thou art the power of vs all,
               Thou would'ſt redeeme Eurymine from thrall.
               Graunt gentle God, graunt this our ſmall requeſt,
               And if abilitie in vs do reſt:
               Whereby we euer may deſerue the ſame,
               It ſhalbe ſeene, we reuerence Phoebus name.
            
            
               Phoe.
               You ſacred ſiſters of faire Hellion,
               
               On whom my fauours euermore haue ſhone,
               In this you muſt haue patience with my vow,
               I cannot graunt what you aſpire vnto.
               Nor was't my fault, ſhe was tranſformed ſo,
               But her owne fond deſire, as ye well know.
               We told her too, before her vow was paſt,
               That cold repentance would enſue at laſt.
               And ſith her ſelfe did wiſh the ſhape of man,
               She cauſde the abuſe, digeſt it how ſhe can.
            
            
               2. Muſe.
               Alas, if vnto her you be ſo hard,
               Yet of Aſcanio haue ſome more regard,
               And let him not endure ſuch endleſſe wrong,
               That hath purſude her conſtant loue ſo long.
            
            
               Aſca.
               Great God, the greeuous trauells I haue paſt,
               In reſtleſſe ſearch, to find her out at laſt:
               My plaints my toiles, in lieu of my annoy,
               Haue well deſeru'd my Lady to enioy.
               Penance too much I haue ſuſtaind before:
               
               Oh Phoebus, plague me not with any more.
               Nor be thou ſo extreame, now at the worſt
               To make my torments greater than at the firſt▪
               
               My Fathers late diſpleaſure is forgot,
               And theres no let, nor any churliſh blot
               To interrupt our ioyes from being compleat,
               But only thy good fauour to intreat:
               In thy great grace it lyes to make my ſtate
               Moſt happie now, or moſt infortunate.
            
            
               1. Mu.
               Heauenly Apollo, on our knees I pray,
               Vouchſafe thy great diſpleaſure to allay.
               What honor to thy Godhead will ariſe,
               To plague a ſilly Lady in this wiſe?
               Beſide, it is a ſtaine vnto thy Deitie,
               To yeeld thine owne deſires the ſoueraigntie:
               Then ſhew ſome grace vnto a wofull Dame,
               And in theſe groues, our tongues ſhall ſound thy fame.
            
            
               Phoe.
               Ariſe deare Nourſes of diuineſt skill,
               You ſacred Muſes of Pernaſſus hill:
               
                  Phoebus is conquerd by your deare reſpect,
               And will no longer clemency neglect.
               You haue not ſude nor praide to me in vaine:
               I graunt your willes, ſhe is a mayd againe.
            
            
               Aſca.
               Thy praiſe ſhal neuer die whilſt I do liue.
            
            
               2. Mu.
               Nor will we ſlack perpetual thankes to giue.
            
            
               Phoe.
               
                  Thalia, neare the Caue where ſhe remaines
               The Fayries keepe, requeſt them of their paines,
               And in my name, bid them forthwith prouide,
               From that darke place, to be the Ladies guide.
               And in the bountie of their liberall minde,
               To giue her cloathes according to her kinde.
            
            
               1. Mu.
               I goe diuine Apollo.
               
            
            Exit.
            
               Phoe.
               Haſte againe.
               No time too ſwift, to eaſe a Louers paine.
            
            
               Aſca.
               Moſt ſacred Phoebus, endles thankes to thee,
               That doeſt vouchſafe ſo much to pittie mee.
               
               And aged father, for your kindneſſe ſhowne,
               Imagine not your friendſhip ill beſtowne.
               The earth ſhall ſooner vaniſh and decay,
               Than I will proue vnthankfull any way.
            
            
               Ara.
               It is ſufficient recompence to me,
               If that my ſilly helpe haue pleaſurde ye.
               If you enioy your Loue and hearts deſire,
               It is enough: nor doo I more require.
            
            
               Phoe.
               Graue Aramanthus, now I ſee thy face
               I call to minde, how tedious a long ſpace
               Thou haſt frequented theſe ſad deſarts here,
               Thy time imployed, in heedfull minde I beare:
               The patient ſufferance of thy former wrong,
               Thy poore eſtate, and ſharpe exile ſo long,
               The honourable port thou bor'ſt ſometime,
               Till wrongd thou waſt, with vndeſerued crime
               By them whom thou to honour didſt aduance,
               The memory of which thy heauy chance,
               Prouokes my minde to take remorſe on thee,
               Father henceforth, my clyent ſhalt thou bee:
               And paſſe the remnant of thy fleeting time,
               With Lawrell wreath, amongſt the Muſes nine.
               And when thy age hath giuen place to fate,
               Thou ſhalt exchaunge thy former mortall ſtate:
               And after death, a palme of fame ſhalt weare,
               Amongſt the reſt that liue in honor here.
               And laſtly know, that faire Eurymine
               
               Redeemed now from former miſerie
               Thy daughter is, whom I for that intent
               Did hide from thee, in this thy baniſhment:
               That ſo ſhe might the greater ſcourge ſuſtaine,
               In putting Phoebus to ſo great a paine.
               But freely now, enioy each others ſight:
               No more Eurymine: abandon quite
               That borrowed name, as Atlanta, ſhe is calde,
               And here ſhe woman, in her right ſhape inſtalde.
            
            
               
               Aſca.
               Is then my Loue deriu'de of noble race?
            
            
               Phoe.
               No more of that, but mutually imbrace.
            
            
               Ara.
               Liues my Atlanta, whom the rough ſeas waue
               
                  I thought had brought vnto a timeleſſe graue?
            
            
               Phoe.
               Looke not ſo ſtraunge, it is thy fathers voyce.
               And this thy Loue: Atlanta now reioyce.
            
            
               Eu.
               As in another world of greater blis
               My daunted ſpirits doo ſtand amazde at this.
               So great a tyde of comfort ouerflowes,
               As what to ſay, my faltering tongue ſcarſe knowes:
               But only this, vnperfect though it bee,
               Immortall thankes great Phoebus vnto thee.
            
            
               Phoe.
               Well lady, you are retransformed now,
               But I am ſure you did repent your vow.
            
            
               Eury.
               Bright Lampe of glory, pardon my raſhneſſe paſt▪
               
            
            
               Phoe.
               The penance was your owne, though I did faſt▪
               
            
            Enter Phylander, and Ioculo.
            
               Aſca.
               Behold deare Loue, to make your ioyes abound,

               Io.
               Oh ſir, well found.
               But moſt eſpecially it glads my minde,
               To ſee my miſtreſſe reſtorde to kinde.
            
            
               Phy.
               My Lord & Madam, to requite your pain,
               
                  Telemachus hath ſent for you againe.
               All former quarrels now are trodden downe,
               And he doth ſmile, that heretofore did frowne.
            
            
               Aſca.
               Thankes kinde Phylander, for thy friendly newes
               Like Iunos balme, that our lifes blood renewes.

               But Lady, firſt ere you your iourney take,
               Vouchſafe at my requeſt, one graunt to make.

               Moſt willingly.
            
            
               Phoe.
               The matter is but ſmall.
               To weare a braunch of Lawrell in your Caull
               For Phoebus ſake, leaſt elſe I be forgot,
