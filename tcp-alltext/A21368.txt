kynge haue put in execution the werke of his cōmaū

in getynge a boke of good maners to his gouernaūce.
The whiche boke is called the secrete of secretes / 
made by the prince of phylosophres Arystotle
the sone of Mahonnet of Macedony / to his dysciple ye
emperour Alexander sone of Phylyp kynge of Macedony
the which Alexandre had two crownes. This
sayd boke Arystotle cōpyled in the oldenesse of his body / 
bycause, that he might no more trauayle nor ryde
to do suche besynesses as Alexander had put into his
charge. For Alexādre had made hym gouernour and
mayster aboue all other bycause he was a man of veray
good councell / of grete clergy / and subtyll vnderstandyng.
And incessantly studyed good & gracyous
maners / & scyences spyrytuall / contemplatiues / and
charytables. He was a wyse man / & meke / louynge

whiche were to longe to be accōpted. Before

And as longe as he lyued Alexander ouercame all y•
worlde through his coūcell. And all landes by the fame
of hym / were put vnder the imperyall cōmaūdemēt
& in lykewyse they of Perce / & Araby. and there
was none yt durst gaynsay Alexāder / in worde nor dede.

for ye loue yt he had to Alexander / & for to cause hym to
knowe all y• secretes
                  •
                he made an epystle here vnder

helpe of lyfe / strength of body / and helth of all the mē

The wyse phylosophres saye that yf any man

or restynge / beynge to laxatyfe or to moche let ynge

of blode or to lytell / it can not be but he must fall in many
dyseases / and greues. Of the whiche dyseases I
haue bryefly founde / and therin wyll I shewe the
my councell / & remedye for the same. All wyse phylosophres
accordeth in one sayeng. who so kepeth hym
fro ouermoche eatynge & drynkyng / & frome y• excesses
aforesayd & kepeth temperaūce / he shal be helthfull
of his bodye / & lyue longe. For I can fynde no mā
but he is of this opynyon / & wyll saye y• all delectable
thynges of the worlde / be it in pleasure of y• body / it
is but for to lyue y• longer in them. But for a more secrete
ye ought to enforce you to do suche thynges as
ben belongynge to longe lyfe / & not to folowe the appetyte
/ y• is to wyte / not to put lye meate vpō meat.
And dere sone I haue herde often spoken of ypocras
which kept many tymes dyete to thēde y• he myght
lyue & endure the longer. Not for to lyue and endure
for y• meate & drynke. Also dere sone it is grete holsomnesse
to be purged of superfluytees & euyll humours
whiche ben in y• body.
         
         
            A. ¶In how many maners a man
may kepe his helthe.
            
               GOod sone I praye the haue in thy mynde
stedfastly these certayne instruceyōs and
kepe thē. Knowe thou that helth is chyefly
in two thynges. The fyrst is lete a mā
vse suche meates & drynkes as he hath bē
nourysshed with. The seconde that he purge hym of
yll humours that be corrupte & greue hym. For ye body
of man is fedde wt meates & drynkes whiche nourysshe

it by naturall heate that dryeth / nouryssheth
and fedeth ye moystnesse therof.
         
         
            B. ¶Of dyuers meates for ye stomake.
            
               WHā ye body is fat & full of vapours grosse
meates is good for it. & of ye nourysshȳg
of suche a body / ye dygestyō is grosse / &
of grece quātyte for ye great heate / & vapours
of ye body. And whā the bodye is
sklneder & drye / subtyll & moyste meates be good for
it. And ye dygestiō therof is of smal quātyte for ye streytnesses
of ye cōduytes. And it is grete wysdome & scyence
for a man to vse suche meates as ben good & appertenēt
to his cōplex yō / that is to wyte yf he fede hym
wt hote meates tēperatly. But yf the heare be to greuous

            C. ¶An epystle of grete value.
            
               MOost dere sone Alexāder sythe it is so that
the body of man is corruptyble by dyuersyte
of cōplexyon / & of contrary humours
that ben in it / wherby oftē there cometh
corrupcyō to it / I thought to delyuer the
some thyng y• shall be necessary & prouffytable to the.
In the whiche I wyll treate of the secretes of physyke
whiche shall please the. For certayne dyseases come
to a kynge whiche be not honest to shewe to physycyens.
And yf thou wylt obserue this lesson / thou
shalt haue no nede of physycyens / except in causes y•
may come in batayle / the whiche may be exchewed.
Alexander fayre sone / whan thou rysest frome thy slepe
/ walke and stretche thy membres egally and combe
thy heed / for stretchyng of the lymmes gyueth force
/ and combynge reyseth the vapoures that ben come
in slepynge and putteth them frome the stomake
In somer wasshe thy heed in colde water / whiche
shall yelde the naturall heate / and shall because of appetyte
to meate. Than clothe the with goodly and ryche
apparell. For the hert of man delyteth in the beholdyng
of precyous meates & clothȳg. Than rubbe
thy tethe with some cours lynnyn / or other thynge
that is note and drye of cōplexcyon / and swete of smell
for it is holsom for the tethe / and kepeth them clene / 
clenseth the stenche of the mouth / and clereth the voyce
/ and gyueth appetyte to eare. And rubbe thy heed
often in the same wyse for it openeth the claustres of
the brayne / and thycketh the necke and other membres
/ and clenseth the face and the syght / and prolongeth
stowpynge of aege / and amendeth the blode.
            
               Also anoynt the somtyme with swete smellynge oyntementes
/ as the tyme requyreth / for in suche swetenesse
thy hert taketh grete pleasure / & is nourysshed
therby. And ye spyryt of lyfe taketh refeccyon in good
odoures: and the blode reneth meryly thrugh y• vaynes
of the body. After that take somtyme an electuary
of a wood called Aloes / and of Bubarbe whiche is
a precyous thynge / to the pryce of foure pens. Which
thou shalte fynde wryten in the boke of physyke / and
this shall do the moche good / for it voydeth the heate
of the mouth of the stomake / and warmeth the body
and wasteth wyndes / and maketh good taste and sauoure.
After this I coūcell y• that thou be often with
thy noble and wyse men of thy realme / & speke to the
of thy besynesses that thou hast to do. And gouerne
them sadly accordynge to theyr good customes.
         
         
            D. ¶Of the maner to trauayle.
            
               OR euer thou eate or thyn appetyte cometh
at thyn houre accustomed do som
trauayle / that is to wyte walke or tyde
a lytell / or do some other worke / for
it helpeth y• body moche / it voydeth all
ventosytees / and maketh the body lyghter stronger
and lustyeth the stomake / and wasted euyll humoures
of the body and maketh the flewme or the stomake
descende. ¶Of the maner of eatynge.
            ¶Fayre sone whā thy meate is set afore the / eate of
suche as thou desyrest moost / resonably / with well
leuayned breed. And eate of such as ought to be fyrst
eaten. For there be two maners of dygestyō of meat

in a man that is to wyte / softe / & harde. For in the botō
is moost heat for to make meat / bycause it is moost
flesshly / and nyghest the heat of the lyuer wherwith
the meate is soden and dygested.
         
         
            E. ¶Of abstynence of meat.
            
               WHā thou eatest / eate by leasure / though
thou haue grete appetyte to eate. For
yf thou eate gredely noughty humoures
do multyply / the stomake is laden
the bodye is greued / the hert is hurte / 
and the meate remayneth in the stomakes botome
vndygested.
         
         
            F. ¶How pure water ought not to be dronkē.
            
               ALso beware dere sone that ye drynke no
pure water / specyally whan thou haste
eaten meate. But yf thou be wont therto.
For as soone as the water is vpon the
meat / it coleth y• stomake / and quencheth
the heate of the dygest you and comforte of the meat.
It letteth dygestyon and greueth the body. Yf thou
must nede drynke water alone / take it the moost temperatly
and as lytell as thou mayst.
         
         
            G. ¶Of the maner to slepe.
            
               WHan thou hast taken thy refeccyon and
hast iuste to slepe / lye downe on a softe
bedde and slepe temperatly. Aud fyrst
lye downe on the lyfte syde / and slepe
theron a reasonable space / for the lyfte
syde is colde and hath nede to be warmeth. And yf
thou fele ony payn in thy bely or in thy stomake / thā
               
lay therto a souerayne medytyne / that is a warme
lynnen cloth layde theron. Wyte yu dere sone that trauayle
is good / and gyueth heate to the stomake. But
after dyner it is a noughty thynge / for the meat abydeth
vndygested in the botome of the stomake / and
therof be bredde many dyseases. And slepe before fedynge
is not good / for it maketh the body leaue and
dryeth the humoures. But slepynge after fedynge is
good / for it fulfylleth y• body & gyueth force / & 
                  •

heat draweth y• heat yt was spredde in all y• mē
               bres
in to y• botō of y• stomake / & gyueth strēgth therto
vpō y• refeccyō of y• meat. And heat requyreth rest.
Therfore some phylosophres haue sayd y• it is better
& holsomer to eat at nyght than in the mornyng / for
the eatyng in y• mornynge bycause of y• heat of y• day
greueth y• stomake / & y• body is more trauayled therwt.
And moreouer y• ꝑsone chauffeth ī trauaylyng doynge

thȳges y• belōgeth to y• body of mā / by y• which heat
y• is outwarde towarde none / ye naturall heat y• is in
warde is weyked & appeyred / & y• meate is harde to
dygest. But at nyght it is more easy & lesse greued wt
y• heat of traueyle. And y• hert & mēbres of mā bē more
in quyet by y• coldnesse of ye nyght / that gyueth naturall
heat to the stomake.

of meates / for some bē grosse / or cours / & some ben

Grosse meates ben good for suche as ben of hote humours

Meane meates bredeth no hote nor superfluous humours

And they ought to be eaten forth with after the rostȳ

            THou ought to knowe y• clere rēnynge waters
that ben nyghe to cytees in pure grounde as
small brokes be the best and lyghtest. water that cometh

out of stony erthe where as is moche fumosytees
is heuy / cōtagyous / & noysom. water of puddles
or fenne full of frogges / addres / and other venymous
wormes be vnholsom. The sygnes of good water is
to be clere / lyght / & of good colour / yt lyghtly dooth se

               kynge
of waters with a colde stomake fastynge afore
dyner greueth the body / and quencheth the heate
of the stomake. But drynkynge of water after dyner
warmeth the stomake and bredeth flewme. And moche
of it corrupteth the meate in the stomake. Thou
oughtest to drynke colde water in somer and warme
water in wynter / and not cōtrary wyse. For warme
water in somer molly fyeth and weyketh the stomake
/ and wasteth the appetyte. And in wynter colde
water quēcheth the heate / and destroyeth the instrumentes
of the brest / it noyeth the lyghtes and lūges

in lyke case is lyke to god. For by mayntey

               rg of Iustyce
he foloweth god / and thou ought to folow hym

the whiche god created / and graunted
to his creatures. By Iustyce the erche was made
/ and kynges ordeyned to kepe and maynteyne Iustyce
for it maketh subgectes meke and obedyent / 
prowde men lowly / and kepeth all persones in saufe
fro wronges and domages. And therfore they of ynde
saye that the Iustyce of a good lorde is better to

good subgectes than the plentyousnesse of the erthe.
And also they say that the Iust and reasonable lorde
is better thā the rayne that falleth in the euenyng.
And there was ones founde wryten in a stone in the

nede eche of other / and one maye not be without

not all thy courage to thy councelers nor lete thē not
knowe what is in thy wyll to do. For yf y• shew thy

hast thus recorded thy councell / put thy mynde in effecte
without delay. For the gretest destruccyon that
may come to a kyng is to bestowe in his werkes & to

noble and wyse audyence / tell it breuely
and wysely / with a good bolde courage

wherfore he can shew the / nor other no

in thy selfe. For yf thou were angry thou coude
shewe hym / nor none other good chere or countenaū
                  ce

hymselfe that he can do no better / and yet he weneth
that he doth wel / for euer the lewdest sheweth moost
anger. For whan a wyse man is angry / he sheweth
it not outwarde by his reason. A man ought more to
feare the anger of a wyse man than of a foole / for the
wyse man can better reuenge his angre than a foole / 

howbeit that a foles angre is often comberous.

shame and rebuke. For whyles thou kepest thy secrete
within the / it is sure. For thou mayst shew thy
secrete to suche one that whan he knoweth it wyl do
the some wrōge / and for feare that thou hast of hym
yt dare not gaynsay hym leest he bewrey the. And yf
thou can none otherwyse but that thou must vttre it
by thy foly / and that thy stomake wyl swell for to tel
it / go out of company and tell it to thy selfe as yf thou
wolde tell it to another man / and thy hert wyll coole
and thy stomake swage. And for ony nede that thou
hast to dyscouer it / take hede to whom / but yf it be to
suche one that for ony anger that thou doost to hym
wyll not rebuke the wt it. And neuer lete thy neyghboure
knowe thy nede / for therby thou mayst be the
lesse set by in places where thou dwellest.
            
            
               ¶How thou oughtest to sporte with
thy frende.
               
                  
                  LOke wysely how thou playest or bourdest
with thy frēde (or other) with thy handes
or with thy mouth / for yf thou do hym harme
/ harme may come to the. with sportȳg
with handes cometh angre and murdre / 
whyther it be thy brother or frende. For yf thou hurt
hym or wryng his hande / or cast hym downe / or smyte
hym otherwyse / it shall greue hym / & shame hym
in his mynde / albeit that he be lytell and weyke / for
eche in hym selfe counteth hym stronge / bolde and
fyers / and yet he wyll prayse hym selfe thoughe he
be a cowarde and nought. And yf thou mocke hym / 
thou shalt spyte hym to the hert / for he wyll thynke
that thou dyspysest hym / & y• thou reputeth hym at
nought. And yf thou mocke hym before people / thou
doost hym yet more spyte / & he shall owe the yil wyll
and hate the deedly. For of mockynge cometh angre
and grete hate / though it be thy brother or other
frende. But thou ought to pastyme with fayre wordes
/ and to shewe goodly auctorytees and reasons to
drawe theyr loue to the / for by that pastaunce thou
mayst come to y• goodnesse / loue & curteysy of people.
            
            
               ¶The maner to doubt and trust thyn enemy.
               
                  WHyther thyn enemy be stronge or weyke
/ thou ought not to doubt hym to moche
/ nor trust to moche to hym. For he y•
is ouercome to day / may be vyctour to
morow. And he that is vyctour to day
may be ouerthrowē to morow. And he that doubteth
none / none wyll haue doubt of hym. To moch doubt

maketh to moch trust / and to moche trust maketh to
moche domage. For he that bereth doubt alwaye wt
hym / hath a grete burdē & payne. And he that hath
trust in hym selfe / bereth his owne domage / and his
dethe. For yu ought to doubt whan tyme is to doubt / 
and to trust whan tyme is to trust.
