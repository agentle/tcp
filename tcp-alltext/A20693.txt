            TO MY HONORABLE GOOD FRIEND
Iohn Souch Esquire, for many curtesies for which I imbolden
my selfe, presuming of his good fauour, to present this
simple worke, as a token of my thankefulnes.
            
               THE estimation and kindnes which I haue euer
bountifully receiued from your fauour,
haue mooued me to present this nouelty of
musick to you, who of al others are fittest to
iudge of it, and worthiest out of your loue to
protect it. If I gaue life to these, you gaue
spirit to me; for it is alwaies the worthy respect
of others that makes arte prosper in it
selfe. That I may therefore professe, and make manifest to the
world both your singular affection to me, and my gratefull minde
in my weake ability to you, I haue here prefixt your honourable
name, as a bulwark of safetie, and a title of grace, thinking my selfe
no way able to deserue your fauours more, then by farther engaging
my selfe to you for this your noble presumed patronage. He
that hath acknowledged a fauour, they say, hath halfe repaide it:
and if such payment may passe for currant, I shal be euer readie to
grow the one halfe out of your debt, though how that should be I
knowe not, since I owe my selfe (and more, if it were possible)
vnto you. Accept me wholy then I beseech you, in what tearmes
you please, being euer in my vttermost seruice
            
               Deuoted to your Honours kindnesse,
IOHN DOWLAND.
               
            
         
         
            
            The Epistle to the Reader.
            
               THE applause of them that iudge, is the incouragement
of those that write: My first two bookes of
aires speed so well that they haue produced a third,
which they haue fetcht far from home, and brought
euen through the most perilous seas, where hauing
escapt so many sharpe rocks, I hope they shall not be
wrackt on land by curious and biting censures.
As in a hiue of bees al labour alike to lay vp honny
opposing themselues against none but fruitles drones; so in the house of
learning and fame, all good indeuourers should striue to ad somewhat that
is good, not malicing one an other, but altogether bandying against the idle
and malicious ignorant. My labours for my part I freely offer to euerie
mans iudgement, presuming, that fauour once attayned, is more easily
encreased then lost.
