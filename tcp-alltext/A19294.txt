            To the right worshipfull
Alderman Holiday, the worthy
Gouernour of the East Indian
Merchants, together with the
prouident Treasures and graue
Committees, and the rest of the
aduenturers in that famous trade
All things pertaining to life
and godlinesse.
            RIght worthy and beloued
in our Lord Iesus Christ:
It is the wonderfull mercy
and exceeding patience of
our gratious God towards vs of this
sinfull Nation that in the middest of
such fearfull stormes and bloody
garboyles deuouring our neighbors
round about vs, wee of this Iland
though, as it were, enuironed round
about with such tempestuous seas,
do yet notwithstanding enioy such

temperate seasons, as not onely to
eate the fruite of our owne labours,
but to be enabled moreouer out of
our aboundance to entertaine and
releeue our distressed neighbours.
And is not the wisedome of God admirable
herein to warne vs to looke
home, when our neighbours house is
on fire, and to make it our owne
case, what is common to vs with others.
Is not his mercy vnspeakeable
that seeing charitie couereth a multitude
of sinnes, and much is forgiuen to
those that loue much, therefore wee
may haue hope of Gods longer forbearance
& indulgence towards vs,
so long as we regard the afflictions
of Ioseph, & by our brotherly affections,
beare one anothers burthen.
Surely though the sickle must be put
in when the haruest is ripe, and there
are too many signes among vs that
the regions are white vnto the haruest,
yea that the Deere is gone out to
go through the land, yet euen here
I haue obserued these meanes to stay
the execution. First, when there are

               some remaining to stand in the gap to
turne away the wrath. Secondly,
when the Lord is iustified and approued
by his word. And thirdly,
when by our compassion and prudence
wee doe communicate with
the afflictions of our brethren, and
so voluntarily suffer with them in
their distresses. Wherein as we haue
speciall cause to blesse our gratious
God for his good hand with our
worthy Nehemiah in this holy
worke, so are wee wisely to secure
our selues in succouring others, and
doing good while wee haue time
to the houshold of faith. Shall not
Sathan and his instruments herein
otherwise condemne vs, who if euer
heretore, do speedily combine them
selues against the Lord and his annoynted,
whose maine policy it is
in these latter dayes to disunite the
hearts of Christians and to weaken
their hands that they may more
speedily and easily make prey of
them. Doe not his croaking frogges
those infernall Iebusites compasse

land and sea to this end, creeping
into the chambers, yea into the harts
of Princes, both to exasperate such as
are auerse against the poore mēbers
of Christ, and also alienate euen the
well affected from the maintenance
of the common faith. And doe wee
thinke that they haue left any stone
vnrowled to compasse the same,
can we imagine but that these spirits
of diuels haue waded into the depth
of their fathers methods, and as she
in the Poet:
            
               When heauen will affoord no helpe,
shee'le moue the infernall powers, so in
despite of heauen these limbs of Sathan
haue now failed to employ the
powers of darkenesse for the more
effectuall deluding of the children
of disobedience? And are not these
the times wherein if it were possible
the very elect may bee seduced and
ensnared hereby. Is not the wisdome
and iustice of God admirable herein
that when the Foole saith in his heart
there is no God, & the Atheist dreams
of no other hell but to bee in debt,
               
and affliction, and so plots by all
meanes to build his heauen on earth
by wallowing in all excesse of riot
and vanitie, as hereby he reapes such
wages of his error as is meet, euen to
be giuen vp to a reprobate sense, and
so not onely to all monstrous and
desperate wickednesse, but euen to
maintaine and secure the same against
all future reckonings, as if he
had made a couenent with hell, and
were at an agreement with death▪
                so
is he iustly taken in his owne craftinesse,
and most wonderfully arrested
by the power of hell, to the apparant
confusion of his imagined happinesse,
and while hee dreames of
no other heauen but to doe what hee
list in earth, hee is not onely therein
restrained by the power of heauen
to the confusiō of his present hopes
for the good of the Saints, but also
iustly caught in the snares of his
owne wickednesse by the power of
hell, as to beginne and seale hereby
vnto him eternall vengeance, and to
hasten him thereto; so that the righteous
               
may more wonderfully escape
of our trouble, when the wicked are
falne into the pit they digged for them.
Surely as it is a righteous thing with
God, that they that doe not receiue the
loue of the truth, shall be giuen vp to
strong delusions to beleeue lies: so if euer
satan were transformed into an
Angell of light, and so more effectually
by his lies and subtilties did deceiue
vnstable soules: If euer the
sure word and wonderfull workes of
God were outfaced and suppressed
by the sleights and forgeries of the
God of this world, the experience here
of is most notorious in our times: to
instance in this particular being the
subiect of our experience how
mightily the Lord hath iustified his
word, both auouching in these dayes
the truth of this doctrine of Witchcraft
as also euidencing the power thereof
in dissoluing the workes of Satan, as
experience hath made it manifest,
so we haue had not onely the great
Patrones and friends of the Church
confirming the same, but euen the

               Churches verie enemies haue beene
enforced to acknowledge no lesse.
And yet such hath been the efficacy
of delusion, that this very same most
glorious truth vpon other respects as
it hath found hard measure among
fained friends, so it hath also thereby
beene traduced and peruerted by
it enemies. And surely we may the
lesse wonder hereat, if we consider
wisely, that as commodities are in request
with many according to their
diuers humours, and different seasons,
so doth it befall the sacred truth.
which though it be sometimes in request,
when it may serue to aduance
the pride of the flesh and infancie of religion,
yet doth it easily grow out of
date, when either it tends to humble
the flesh, or iustly challengeth lukewarmnesse
and hypocrisie. Which as it
was the portion of the Lord and master
of the Church, sometimes to bee
cryed vp with Hosanna, eftsoones
to bee cryed downe with crucifige so
hath it beene the lot of the scepter of
this kingdome, the budding rod of Aaron
               
sometimes to be turned into a serpent
in the opinion of man, as if it
onely entended to destruction and
not to edification, no better then a
doctrine of licentiousnesse or sedition
and despaire, which eftoones was
in esteeme as Angels foode, sweeter
then honey, pretious aboue rubies,
most orient gems. Which seeing it
hath beene also the portion of this
truth concerning witchcraft, is it
any maruell if what man opposeth
and seeketh to suppresse, the Lord
himselfe hath powerfully maintaind
and iustified, as prouing vnto it
gainesayers a sauour of death, that
haue refused to embrace the same
as a sauour of life vnto life. Surely
when I discerne the efficacy of delusion
preuailing in these dayes euen
vpon such that haue tested of
the good word of God, and beene pertakens
of the enlightning spirit: and so
haue had some kenning of the power
of the life to come, and yet are so
falue away from conscience, yea from
science it selfe, that they are very

               strangers from the life of God through
their affected ignorance, and being
willingly ignorant of what they haue
formerly beene conuinced of, are
growne to bee starke-mockers of all
powers; yet all forme of Religion,
and so in this their Atheisme,
sing a Requiem to their soules, fearing
no other hell, then to be mooued
in their slippery state, and dreaming of
no other heauen then to build their
foundation in the sands: Mee thinkes
I see the foolish worldling on the
pinnacle of his confidence, and so in
his greatest security, lying open to
confusion. And do I not see the Iustice
of God working wonderfully
herein, in besotting the foole in his
owne wisedome. Euen giuing him
vp to rest vpon such broken reedes,
for the securing of his Babel, which
are the onely meanes to confound
the same. And hath not the God of
the world by diuine permission a speciall
stroke in this delusion, not only
to proue a lying spirit in the mouth
of our false Prophets, bidding to go

                  And so 1 Application hereof made
to the Church of Christ. Chap. 8.
                  109. Out of these Groundes thus
soundly layd, It is further considered:
Who is the Practiser of this Art.
                  Namely the Witch.
                  
                  Where first, a Witch is discribed and
liuely painted out vnto vs, in her seuerall

Lineaments and true Proportion:

page 183.
               
               
                  And also,
                  Sutable to the seuerall Conditions aud
qualities of Nature, p. 184.
                  And so it is further manifested, that
Antichrist hath especially entertayned
and aduaunced this Diuellish Art, as
an especiall meanes to attaine and maintaine
his visible Monarchie: page 193
194., &c.
                  And here is also resolued, what especiall
Places Witches doe most haunt
together.
                  With the Vse thereof, page 199.
& 200. Chap. 9.
                  
                     
It being apparant what a Witch is,
It is now further discouered, how many
kindes of Witches there are, p. 203.
                  And heere first of the Bad Witch:
page 206.
                  2. Of the meanes whereby she executes

                  First, Of her Nature and Condition,
p. 211.
                  2 That her skill in helping is no speciall
gift of God: but attained by the assistance
of the Deuill. p. 213.
                  3 Of the meanes whereby shee binds
to be helpfull. Namely, the beliefe of men,
and here, page 218.
                  Whether they can helpe any that
doth not beleeue: page 219. 220.
                  Whether the Good Witch can hurt:
and the hurting Witch can help? Where
the admirable Wisedome and Iustice of
God is declared, page 224.
                  And so it is approoued that the good
Witch is sarre more daungerous then
the bad: p. 232.
                  
                     
And thereupon aduice giuen for her
auoydance and apprehension especially,
and this in the 10. Chap.
                  And thus endeth the first Book, contayning
the Truth, Nature, and Kinds
of Witch-craft; together with the proper
subiect of this Art: and so of her
Entrance, Confirmation, and Practise
therein, as also the seuerall kinds
and dangers of them.
                  
               
            
            
               The second Booke, proceedeth
to their Detection, and
Conuiction: and
to this ende.
               
                  FIrst, setteth downe the Power and Efficacie
of Witch-craft.
                  
                  Whereby they execute their feates, and
seuerall mischiefes, and so drawe themselues,
yet more palpably within the compasse
of authoritie.
                  And heere first it is shewed wherein

the power of Witches is restrayned,
page 230.
               
               
                  And here it is enquired,
                  Whether the Witch haue power to
afflict the childe of God, and how farre:
with the vses thereof? page 248.
                  How in these kindes of afflictions the
Elect differ from the wicked, page 253.
                  Secondly, is declared, wherein the
Witches power is apparant:
               
               
                  And heere.
                  First, of the Actions concerning their
owne persons, p. 257.
                  Secondly, of their actions towards others,
p. 258.
                  And so the Policie of Satan is discouered,
in executing and conuaying of this
power.
                  1 By naturall Medecines, page 262
                  2 By Prayers, and good Councells:
page 263.
                  3 By shrowding it vnder naturall diseases,
and mixing it therewith. 4 And
of his notable sleights, and daungerous
snares therein, page 265.
               
               
                  And all this Chap 1.
                  Secondly is discoursed that Witches
                     
ought to be detected.
               
               
                  And to this end.
                  First, The admirable Wisedome and
Iustice of God is discouered, in making
them instruments of their owne confusion
page 270.
                  Secondly, Two principall meanes are
layde downe for their Discouerie:
                  Namely, Examination;
                  And Conuiction.
               
               
                  And heere,
                  First, are commended diuers waighty
presumptions, tending probably to detect
the Witch. p. 274.
                  2, Diuers manifest Proofes are added,
tending to the conuiction of the same,
page 277.
                  And so false meanes of Detection being
reiected, and some doubts answered
concerning the same: vse is made thereof
to the Church of God, and this is in
the second Chap.
                  Thirdy are discouered the Remedies
against Witch-craft.
                  
                  Whereof the principall is, the Execution
of Authoritie, in cutting of the Offenders,
Both for the practizing of their

mischieifes: aud also: For Release from
the same, p. 280.
               
               
                  And here first is prooued, That
                  These mischiefes may bee preuented:
page 282.
                  2. The meanes of preuention are layd
downe.
               
               
                  And these first Preseruatiue, both,
                  First, such as concerne the persons of
men, page 284. And
                  2. Such as concerne their Habitations,
page 289.
                  Secondly, to these are added, Restoratiue
Remedies:
                  
               
               
                  And these:
                  Either Generall, to dissolue the works
of Satan, p. 293.
               
               
                  Or else:
                  Speciall Respecting Priuate Persons,
page 295. And this Chap. 3.
                  The True Remedies beeing thus
discoursed: Examination is further
made of such counterfaite and vnlawfull
meanes, as are vsed to the Discouerie of
Witches.
                  
               
               
                  And here first of
                  The Gift of Miracles which is

prooued, now to bee ceased, and needlesse
heereto, and therefore falsly arrogated,
and wickedly forged to the same: where
Obiections are auswered, and the truth
cleered, that these are but lying wonders
accomplished by the power of Satan,
page. 297.
                  As appeareth by the means whereby
they are wrought: Namely;
                  First, the Name of Iesus, which is
not effectuall by Diuine power to any such
ends, p. 302.
                  Secondly, The Reliques of Saintes,
page 304.
                  Thirdly, The Signe of the Crosse:
page 305.
                  Fourthly, Vse of Holy Water, Salt,
Images, Agnus Dei, Graines, &c. p. 306
                  5. Exorcismes, and here it is resolued
whether it be lawfull to relieue a Witch,
and how farre it may be done. p. 307.
and this in the 4. Cap.
                  Fiftly is proposed and prosecuted a principall
Remedie against Witch-craft:
Namely, Execution of Iustice: and
heere likewise, First is propounded the
iust Punishment belonging to this Sinne:

that Witches by the Lawe of God are to
die the death, where both obiections are
answered. page 313.
                  And the equitie of Gods Lawe cleared
and maintained. Chap. 5.
                  Lastly, by way of conclusion, are layd
open the seuerall Vses of this Doctrine of
Witch-craft for the further edification of
the Church of God.
               
            
            
               Heere beginneth the third
Booke.
               
                  THose are, first of Reproofe, and that

this present age is iustly taxed and conuinced.
page 324. sect. 3.
                  4 As also the grosse profanenesse and
generall rebellions of the present Generation.
page 325. sect. 4.
                  5 Lastly, it is a manifest conuiction
of that damnable hypocrisie, and accursed

dissimulation that raignes in this present
age. sect. 5. Chap. 1. page 327.
                  A second generall vse is for Instruction:
and that, First,
                  Teaching how to auoyde and remedie
the causes of Witch-craft.
                  
                  Which are, First, That grosse and
wilfull Ignorance that swarmes in the
Land, Where is
prooued, first, That this is a maine cause
of Witch-craft. page 329.
                  2 How this is to be remedied. page
330. chap. 2.
                  A second cause of Witch-craft, is Infidelitie.
                  1 This is prooued by many Circumstances.

downe to preuent and remedie this mischiefe.
page 335. chap. 4.
                  A fourth cause of Witch-craft is

                     Couetousnesse, as appeareth:
                  1 By many liuely Euidences. p. 337
                  And so we are directed how to remedy
this great sinne. page 338.
                  A fift cause of Witch-craft, is Curiositie,
heere,
                  
                  1 The Reasons hereof are discouered.
page 339.
                  2 And the way declared how to meet
with this sinne. page 341. chap. 6.
The sixt and principall cause of this
iudgement of Witch-craft is Pride.
                  
               
               
                  As appeareth,
                  1 By diuerse pregnant Euidences
heereof. page 342: and so,
                  2 We are informed how to encounter
this mischiefe. p. 344. cha. 7.
                  A second generall Instruction is to
teach vs heereby the truth of our naturall
condition, that we are the very slaues of
Sathan, and vessels of wrath. page 346
chap. 8.
                  A third generall Instruction heere
is, to teach vs how wee may be freed
from this naturall bondage, what is the
principall meanes heereunto. page 347.
chap. 9.
                  
                     
A fifth generall Instruction, is to

all other meanes of our saluation, as of
Prayer, Sacraments, and both concerning
Preachers and People. page 351.
chap. 11.
                  A sixt generall Instruction, is to prouoke
vs to sinceritie and power of Religion

12. page 352.
                  A seuenth generall Instruction, is to
informe vs in the sleights and cunning of
Sathan, that so we may not be ignorant
of his dangerous snares. chap. 13. page

                  Eightly, heere is matter of Instruction,
both for the particular triall of
our owne estates page 354.
                  As also for the discerning of the true
Church of God militant heere on earth.
chap. 14. page 357.
               
               
                  Ninthly, wee are heere instructed,
                  Both how to behaue our selues in generall

carrie our selues in this affliction of Witc-craft.
chap. 15. page 356.
                  As also how to preuent such snares as

are in this Practise of Witch-craft, most
cunningly layd to intangle and drawe vs
to the liking and entertainement thereof.
page 357. chap. 16.
                  A third generall Vse, is for consalation,
and that many wayes:
               
               
                  And that generally,
                  1 To comfort the Church of God, in
regard of the grieuous iudgement of witch
craft. 360. chap. 17.
                  2 To comfort in particular such as

                  THE MYSTERIE
OF WITCH-craft
discouered.
                  THE FIRST BOOKE.
                  
                     CHAP. I.
                     
                        Of the Occasions and Scope of this
Treatise; wherein is especially proued
that this doctrine of Witch-craft is
very necessary to bee handled and prosecuted
in these daies.
                     
                     
                        DIVERSE haue beene
the motiues and occasions
which haue lead
mee to treatise of this
Subiect at this time.
                     
                        
Some more Generall, concerning
the diseases of the Time.
                     
                     Others Speciall, concerning my
Selfe.
                     
                     The Generall are:
                        Generall reasons mouing to this Treatise. Because the wise
and glorious God by his speciall
prouidence in these daies, requireth
an especiall account of our Faith in
this Truth: And that in these respects.
                     
                        First, That we should in thankefulnesse,
acknowledge his great power
and mercy, That hath so honoured
and iustified the Reuelation of the
glorious Gospell of his Sonne Iesus, by
which this Mysterie of Satan which
in former ages hath beene either
smothered, or peruerted, to the further
erecting and maintaining of
the Kingdome of darknesse; is now
gratiously and cleerely, not onely
discouered, but further also reformed
to the true vse thereof, and so wee
rightly enformed how to deale
therein: And so by the power of
God, the Magistrate enabled to take
such course therein, as may best

serue to the demolishing of the
Kingdome of Anti-christ.
                     
                        Secondly, seeing the Power of the
Gospell is thus able to discouer and
confound the kingdom of Satan, may
not this condemne our vnprofitable receiuing
thereof, who still maske it in
our sinnes, and will not come out of
them, whereas the very deuils giue
testimony thereunto?Iam. 2. If they beleeue
and tremble, if they cannot endure
the glorious light of the Gospell, if
they forsake their holds, and confound
their Proselites, being forced
to discouer them by the power of
the Word,Act. 19. 3. and so to be the executioners
of Gods righteous iudgements against
them; Shall not this bee our condemnation,
that though light bee come into
the world,Ioh. 3. 9. yet still wee loue the darkenesse
more then the light? wee lesse obey the
Gospell then the deuils do;Angli quasi Angeli. wee Angels
in name, are lesse affected then
these infernall spirits; wee spurne
against Authoritie, when these are
controuled by it; wee continue in
our sinnes, when these are cut off by

the Magistrate; wee iustifie sinne,
when these discouer and vnfold it?
                     Surely seeing God is glorifyed in
confessing of our sinnes,
                        Iosh. 7. 9. shall not the
deuils rise vp in iudgement against
vs? may not they teach vs to yeeld
more obedience to the Gospell? And
seeing, for our disobedience to the
Truth,
                        2. Thess. 2. 11. it hath pleased the Lord to
giue vs vp in his iustice to strong delusions;
either,Delusions of the time. 
                        to rest in the forme of religion
denying the power thereof, or else,
to runne backe to Aegypt againe: euen
to loath this heauenly Manna, and so
to doate vpon the fitches and onions,
yea the garbidge and very deepenesse of
Antichrist, exalting him aboue all
that is called God, In seeking for
helpe vnto Blessers, and good Witches,
as wee call them, who being commonly
ignorant, prophane, and superstitious,
proue verie dangerous
instruments for the restoring and
encrease of the kingdome of Antichrist.
As both colouring their Diabolicall
practise vnder pretence of
holy prayers and naturall meanes, and

thereby aduancing that lip-labour
and formall deuotion, the very life of
Popery. As also by their pretence of
great charitie in relieuing so many infirmities,
                           Note. Miracles.
iustifying that false Fire
of Popish Loue, and fained Miracles:
But especially nuzeling the people in
ignorance by their example and corrupt
practise, and seducing them
from the light of the Gospell, and
such holy meanes as therein are offered
for their reliefe, to most indirect
and desperate remedies, as to enthrall
their soules to hell for euer, that the
poore carkase may haue present ease:
As requiring trust and confidence to
bee reposed in them, and so excluding
vtterly from Christ, and so from
saluation. Seeing (I say) these
Blessers are highly esteemed of in
these daies, as being dangerous Factors
for Anti-christs kingdome:
Ought not euery True Member of
Christ to see this plague, to giue warning
of it, that so their bloud may
not bee required at his hands? And
hath the glorious Lord beene without

witnesses in these daies to discouer
the practises of Anti-christ,
his creepings in againe, and that by
these means of Sorceries and enchantments?
                     Surely, the Name of his Maiestie
bee blessed for euer, that hath raised
vp euen a cloud of Witnesses in
these declining daies; as to contest
against Anti-christ, and his
hellish Monarchie, so withall to
discrie his deepenesse in these his
deuilish instruments, and therefore
especially to detect and confound
the same.
                     Consider, I pray you, with mee
the wisedome of our God, and let
vs magnifie his Name together.
                     Hath hee not ordained the Magistrate
and the Minister for the seasonable
ouerthrow of Anti-christs
kingdome?
                     And hath hee not very meruailously
disposed in these times, that
as Anti-christ hath renued his hopes
by these and other desperate engines
of his spirituall warfare, so he hath

beene confronted by Gods powerfull
Ordinances?
                     
                     As the Magistrate not onely in
making seucre Lawes against the encrease
of his kingdome,Magistrates. R. Iacobus.
                         but further
also by his happie Pen, cutting down
his vsurped Authoritie to the very
roote; and further also discouering
and confounding this Mysterie of
Witch-craft,
                        In Daemonologia. as being a maine proppe
and hope for the vpholding and
continuance thereof.
                     And concerning the Ministers of
the Gospell,
                        Ministers. haue not these in their
Places, as they haue the more in generall
beene zealous against Antichrist
kingdome, as they haue
more discerned the Mysterie and
Marke of the Beast, so they haue
beene more quick-sighted to discerne
him in this Policie of Witch-craft,
                        
                           Mr. Perkins Gifford, North-brooke.
and so haue more earnestly
laboured against the same? And
shall I hold my peace in this day
of good-tydings? Shall I not also
bring my fagot to the burning of
these Witches, and so to further the

destroying of the kingdome of Antichrist.
                     Hath not the Lord enabled mee
to discouer the practise of Antichrist
in that hellish Plot of the Gunpowder-treason?
Hath hee not preserued
mee gratiously from many such
diuelish Practises of these Antichristian
Instruments, not onely in
keeping mee from seeking for their
helpe, when my children were suspected
to bee afflicted by them, that
so my soule might bee endangered
thereby: But especially in preserusing
mee from many cursed snares
which by these mischieuous instruments
haue beene priuily laid for
me, to the endangering of my life,
and hinderance of the Gospell?
                     Surely were there no generall
reasons to induce mee heerevnto,
yet mine owne priuate respect, might
well heerein prouoke mee to erect
some such like Altar in memoriall
of Gods mercies towards mee; and
to enable and aduise my brethren to
keep themselues from Witch-craft.
                     
                        
Must I not confesse, to the glory
of my God, that as Yonger Studies
are subiect to Pride and Curiositie, so
Curiositie, through Pride, not contenting
it selfe with Common knowledge,
is prouoked hereby to taste
of the forbidden fruit, euen to diue
into secrets belonging onely vnto
God, to foreknow things to come,
and so to gaine some high and diuine
esteeme in declaring of them?
                     And doth not Art giue some colour
and shew heerevnto? as yeelding
out of generall precedences of
the coniunctions and motions of
heauenly Bodies,Note. some probable
coniectures concerning the motion
& successe of these inferiour things?
And doth not Satan most cunningly
and dangerously shroud himselfe
vnder this Art? as concluding particular
certainities out of generall probabilities,
and coniectures, which the
curious Student coueting after, as
being ashamed to stagger in his
skill; while he cannot therefore finde
this in his Art, is therefore the rather

baited by Satan to seeke this
skill from him, who will not now
faile to tender his helpe for the satisfying
of proud curiositie, and that by
such meanes as are not likely to bee
refused.
                     For whereas flesh and bloud
would bee afraid to encounter Satan
in his owne likenesse at the first, vnlesse
it were further deluded and hardned
in the Trade; therefore behold the
dangerous cunning of Satan to entice
these nouices to his lure, and
that by the appearance of contrarie
semblance.
                     To this end he appeares first transformed
into an Angell of Light, pretending
his willing subiection to certaine
idle and worthlesse Characters and
Names of God, whereby he deceiues
his nouices two waies.
                     First, in making them beleeue that
this Art is approued of God, in that it
goes vnder his name.
                     2 That it is also performed by the
power of God, as whose name is the
ground of the charmes, and therefore

shall haue good successe.
                     3 And that not onely in the thing
attempted, but also to the party attempting
the same, as hauing speciall fauor
with God, hauing the Lord (as it
were) at his becke, being made of Gods
secret couusell, being as God, knowing
things to come.
                     
                     For the further confirmation of
this delusion, behold in this point
another pollicie of Satan; that whereas
man, through pride, desires Soueraignety
& Dominion, therfore now
(in the second Place) Satan offers
himselfe vnto this Nouice, as a Slaue
and Vassaile, seeming to be commanded
by him, whom he now labours to
enthrall for euer, And therein notably
gulling the ambitious spirit with
this conceited Emperie: What canst
thou desire more then to preuaile
with God, then to leade hell captiue
in this triumphant manner, then by
these meanes to preuaile with men?
                     Thus are Yong Schollers puffed vp
with knowledge, and the Pride of
knowledge exalts them aboue that

which is meete, that so their fall may
be more fearefull and irrecouerable.
                     And was not my Yonger Studies
subiect to this tentation?
                     Surely blessed bee God in Iesus
Christ that hath lent mee life to acknowledge
his mercie in this behalfe!
                     Was there not a time when I admired
some in the Vniuersitie famozed
in that skill?
                     Did not the Lord so dispose of
mee, that my Chamber-fellow was exceedingly
bewitched with these
faire shewes, and hauing gotten diuers
bookes to that end, was earnest
in the pursuit of that glorie which
might redound thereby?
                     Did not wee communicate our
Studies together? was not this skill
proposed and canuased in common?
And did not the Lord so arme his
vnworthy seruant, that not onely the
snare was gratiously espied; but, by
the great mercie of my God, the
Lord vsed mee as a meanes to diuert
my Chamber-fellow from these

dangerous Studies? And shall not
this mercie of our God bee had in
euerlasting remembrance?
                     
                        Surely the mercies of God are euerlasting,
worthie to bee sought out of all
that feare him:Lam. 3. 23. 
                        How are they renued
euery morning, so great is his faithfulnesse?
                     For did not my God exercise mee
vsually with continuall buffetings of
Satan, that so I might be better enabled
to discouer his sleights to
others? Witnesse my diurnall Records
to this end, which if God continue
life and health, may serue the common
Good.
                     Hath not the Lord since, wheresoeuer
it hath pleased him to pitch
my Tent, euen there to follow mee
with this Tentation,
                        In Cheshire and Couentry. to bee assaulted
with this pestilent-brood, and Deuillish
Generation? Hath not hee vsed mee
as an instrument, though most vnworthy,
to comfort others according
to the comforts that haue
abounded vnto mee? Hath not my
gracious God wonderfully deliuered

mee from their cursed Traines,
and made mee able in some poore
measure to declare his great mercies
to the generations to come?
                     And haue I not often Vowed to
glorifie God in this behalfe? Haue
not my meditations and experience
beene faithfully stored vp to this
end? Was I not purposed vpon a
speciall occasion of the death of the
Ladie HALES procured by Witch-craft,
to commend such obseruations
to Posteritie, but that the good knight
her husband, for reuiuing and continuing
of his griefe by that memoriall
ouer-ruled that opportunity:
But is not the Lord mercifull to offer
another seasonable and worthie occasion
to Pay my Vowes?
                     
                     Surely, the Lord bee blessed that
awakens this secure age daily by renued
tokens of his power and displeasure:
And seeing wee will not
obey his Word, but reiect the power
of it, vouchsafeth yet to Preach vnto
vs by his wonderfull workes.
                     And seeing ordinary iudgements

will not awaken vs; euen from the
belly of Hell hee cries vnto vs, and
sends forth his euill Angels to vexe
and torment vs. Blessed bee his
Name that giues vs warning of the
great and spirituall plague vpon our
soules, by these torments vpon our
bodies: That lets vs see the plague
of grosse and palpable darkenesse
threatned against vs by these common
and fearefull delusions of the
Prince of darkenesse.
                     Doth not euery Assise almost
throughout the Land, resound of the
arraignement and conuiction of notorious
Witches; either where grosse
ignorance and Popery most aboundeth,
or where the truth of God is
with-held, and prophaned, by vnrighteousnesse
aud hypocrisie?
                     Can wee forget the late Assise at
Lancaster, where no lesse then fifteene
were endited, and twelue condemned
of that horrible crime, a
Countrie abounding on that part
thereof, with grosse ignorance and
Popery?
                     
                        
Hath not Couentrie beene vsually
haunted by these hellish Sorcerers,
where it was confessed by one of
them, that no lesse then three-score
were of that confedracie? And is not
this a place famous for the pride
and glorie of the Holy Mountaine?
                     
                     And was I not there enioyned by
a necessity to the discouerie of this
Brood?
                     These are the occasions of this
ensuing Treatise, this is the scope and
end thereof.
                     And is it not then a word in due
season for our present edification?
                     Surely seeing the Word and the
Sword do verie gratiously sort together,
the one to authorize and confirme
the other: Seeing now the
sword of the Magistrate is seasonably
brandished against these offenders:
is not the Word encouraged to iustifie
that Authoritie, which vsually is too
fearefull and charitable in rooting
out such euils?
                     Ought not the Word to encourage
the Sword to this glorious worke of

detecting and confounding the kingdome
of darknesse, which especially
preuailes by these deuillish charmes.
                     And that not onely in the Ignorant
multitude, and wilfully seduced Papist;
But euen in the Carnall Protestant,
and Grosse Hypocrite, though
they haue receiued the knowledge
of the Truth; For do wee not generally
detaine the truth of God in vnrighteousnesse,
making a shew of
Religion and yet denying the power
thereof; making our belly our God,
and the wedge of Gold our hope,
turning the graces of God vnto wantonnesse,
and so giuing vp our members
as weapons to the seruice of sin;
do thereby plainely discouer whose
seruants wee are, euen the bondslaues
of Satan who ruleth in the
children of disobedience? And doth
not the Lord very wonderfully discouer
our shifts, and confound our
painted shewes, euen by these euill
Angels which hee sends amongst
vs?
                     Doth not our Atheisme on the

one side, convince our heartlesse
and deceitfull worship, while wee
Plead for Satan, and maintaine
his Kingdome concluding his
preuailings to bee but Counterfaitings;
                        Scot.
his Contracts with Witches
to bee but Delusions, ascribing his
power in afflicing, to Naturall Diseases.
                     
                     And yet doth not the Lord on
the other side reiect our confidence
that so our owne tongues and waies
may fall vpon vs?
                     For doe wee yet feare those Withes,
whom wee conclude to bee
harmelesse, hurting rather by our infidelitie,
then any power of satan, or
in themselues?
                     Do wee not close with them desperately,
releeuing them with our
Almes, and so binding them by
our charitie, and euen Tying them
by the Teeth, that they may not
hurt vs?
                     Nay, though wee make profession
to seeke to GOD alone in
our troubles; yet when it comes

to the Pinch, doe wee not runne
vnto the Deuill? Hath not the
Blesser, more Proselites and Patients
then the Physition; yea then the conscionable
Preacher?
                     
                     The Lord giue vs vnderstanding
in these things. Where is
our Faith in God? Is there not a
God in Israel that wee must runne
to Beelzebub the Prince of darkenesse
for helpe?
                     Nay where are our Wits and
common sence? do wee say that Witches
haue no power to hurt by Satan;
And yet doe wee runne to those
for helpe? Which seeing they haue
no calling from God, nor vse any such
meanes as are Warrantable by the
Word, it must needs follow that they
proceed from the Father of Lies;
who then hurts most dangerously
when hee pretends to helpe: And
must needes hurt desperately when
hee is exalted and adored aboue
all that is called God, requiring that
homage which is onely due vnto
God.
                     
                        
Thus, though light bee come into
the world, though it bee entertained
for a season, yet men loue darknesse
more then the light, because
their workes are euill; and so are iustly
giuen vp for their disobedience to
this Strong Delusion, euen to worship
Satan; and so to become two-fold
more the children of hell then they
were before.
                     And doth not their example harden
the Papist in their Idolatry? And yet
surely the Iustice of God doth still
gloriously appeare in these Children
of wilfull ignorance that still stoppe
their eaires against the voyce of the
charmer, charme hee neuer so wiselie.
That seeing they will not bee
conuerted by that milde voyce from
Heauen, they may bee confounded
by this fearefull voyce from hell: That
they may now discerne their true
estate to bee no better then the
Deuils slaues,Eph. 2. 2. Tim. 2. 32. led captiue by him
at his will, by these Good and Bad
Witches: these hurters and helpers.
                     As Trusting to these for helpe for the

body, and so renouncing the soueraigne
and safe remedie of the light
of the Gospell for the saluation of
soules. As, fearing the other more
then the liuing God, and his Vicegerent
the Magistrate; and so by
this slauish feare, as with a strong
eord being faster bound vnder the
power of darkenesse, binding hereby
iniquitie as with Cart-ropes,
while they adde drunkennesse vnto
thirst, confirming Ignorance and Infidelitie
by this palpable Idolatry in
seeking helpe of Satan: And so
being confounded in their vaine confidence
of will-worship vnto God: As
now being iustly convinced to
offer sacrifice to the deuill, might
either by this shame bee brought
to repentance, or else being made
vtterly inexcusable, might so bee
giuen ouer to the fearefull expectation
of the vengeance to
come.
                     Certainely, if these accursed people
yet seeke for signes and shadowes
to confirme them in their

superstition or reforme them to the
Truth: Haue they not a signe from
heauen, euen the signe of the Sonne
of Man, Daily crucified vnto them
in the powerfull Preaching of the
Gospell? And yet behold their fearefull
obstinacie.
                     Doe they not still dote after
stockes and stones? Doe they not
runne from the liuing to the dead?
Doe not they renue their Idolatrous
Crosses, to encrease their stony
hearts? Do they not say vnto the
stockes thou art my Sauiour, and
to the stone thou hast redeemed
mee?
                     Oh Adulterous and faithlesse
Generation, how long will they prouoke
the Lord? Shall not his iealousie
burne like fire to consume
them and all their stubble with vnquenchable
torments.
                     And seeing they boast that they
haue made a Couenant with hell,Esay 28. 45 and
are at an agreement with death, as
pretending that by their Keyes
they haue the power to open and

shut hell at their pleasure; and yet
intending, and discouering plainely
heerein their horrible Athiesme, that
they haue made Falsehood their Refuge,
and are Hid vnder Vanitie,
making the Pleasures of sinne,
                        Heb. 11. 26 their
chiefe God and happines, and resting
in their Visible Monarchie, as their
Soueraigne and supreme KingdomeAnd esteeming hell as a Bug-beare and puting the euill day farre from them that they may approach to the seat of Iniquitie..
                     Hath not the Lord mightily reiected
their confidence by giuing
them another Signe euen from
the bowels of the earth: By letting
Satan loose to torment and
delude them, to vexe their bodies
and yet also to deceiue their
soules?
                     Surely the Iustice of GOD
is admirable heerein to bee laid to
heart of all those that doe hate
the Whore,
                        Amos 6. 3. and desire her desolation,
that so they may lift
vp their heads because their saluation
draweth neere; in that
they may discerne in this glasse
of his prouidence, the confusion

of Anti-christs approachings: And
so may take the oportunity, to hasten
the same in their seuerall places
and meanes which yet the Lord in
mercy affoords vnto them.
                     And blessed bee God that giues
some measure of wisedome to redeeme
the time, and declare the
wonders of the Lord to the Generation
to come. Shall not this
make for the confirmation of
our faith, that the Lord
will tread Satan vtterly
ynder our
feete?
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. II.
                     
                        First prooueth that there are Witches,
and that

                              1 By testimonie from the Word.
                              2 By testimony from all antiquitie.
                              3 By sound Reason, and that drawne:

                                    First from the Power, Iustice and Wisedome
of the Lord.
                                    Secondly from the Pride and Policie of
Satan.
                                    Thirdly from the damnable estate and
desperate condition and corruption of
man.
                                 
                              
                           
Secondly it reprooueth;

                              1 Those that impute this to melancholy.
                              2 The Atheist that denies Witchcraft.
                              3 That would haue all to be but Illusion.
                              4 That iustifie bad Witches.
                              5 And so answereth to all obiections that
may bee iustly made against this Doctrine.
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        THat there are Witches; first, this
appeareth by the testimonie of the
Word, which witnesseth.
                     
                        
1 That there were such Sorcerers
that preached this skill, as 1. Sam. 19.
The Witch of Endor, & Simon Magus,
Acts. 8. and Pythonesse in the Acts
19. &c.
                     2 The Iudgements of God are denounced
against such by the Prophets,
as Esay 44. 25. & 47. 12.
                     3 The Magistrates by seuere Lawes
interdicted the practize of Witchcraft
as Saul, 1. Sam. 10. 3. & 9.
                     4 The sentence of death is pronounced
against this by the Law of God, as
Exodus 22. 18. Thou shalt not suffer a
Witch to liue.
                     
                     Secondly, the whole streame of
Antiquity also auoucheth the same.
                     As appeareth by that which is declared
heereafter concerning the entertainement
and practize of Sercerie: By
all nations.
                     2 By the Lawes of each nation, against
this Mysterie.
                     3 By the generall experience of
all Ages wherein eyther through ignorance
this wickednesse hath appeared
in open face among the Gentiles,

or else, for abuse of knowledge,
euen hypocrites haue beene giuen
vp to this Iudgement of Witchcraft,
because they detaine the truth
of God in vnrighteousnesse, and sacrifice
to their Art, yea to Sathan
himselfe, euen wherein they pretend
to serue God, as appeareth afterward
in the vse heereof.
                     This also is manifest by sound Reason
and Induction.
                     
                     And that from the Power, Wisedome
and Iustice of God.
                     Gods Power is manifest; as his yeelding
vp the mightiest to the power of
Sathan, as Gods executioner, so in
brideling Satan to hurt & cut where
it pleaseth him, Iob 1 & 2. 2. Corin. 4.
Matth. 8.
                     His Wisedome admirable in this:
That giuing the wicked their desire
for the satisfying of the flesh.Ps. 106. 25.
                     
                     1 They are willingly giuen vp to
submit their soules to the power of
Satan, and so to be the executioners
of their owne damnation.
                     2 And whereas Satan, if he should

appeare in his owne likenes, would not
so easily be intertained, could not do
so conueniently the will of God, in
deceiuing the wicked: yet beeing
now disposed by the Lord of glory
in this wise and glorious manner,
that by the ministerie of men & women
subiect to our infirmities: and
therefore more likelie by reason of
natures bonds, to preuaile with their
like, Satan shal tender his seruice vnto
vs; doth hee not conuey his poyson
into our soules more easily? doth
hee not preuaile more effectually to
our ensnaring and destruction?
                     
                        The Iustice of God shineth also
most gloriously in this mysterie of
Witchcraft.
                     As first, In making it a Punishment
to such as will not obey the truth, that
they might be deluded and ensnared
thereby.
                     And so in sealing vp, in this strange
& terrible affliction by Witchcraft,
& the desperate couenant that is therein;
euen eternall vengeance, and
those intolerable paines of the damned,

that the Atheist may be vtterly confounded,
and the desperate sinner,
may be vtterly without excuse: As
preaching to the rebellious world,
by these prophets of Satan the certaintie
of their damnation, who refuse
to embrace the glad tydings of
their saluation from the Messengers
of the Lord.
                     And is not the Iustice of God admirable
heerein, that the wicked are
now the choosers and executioners
of their owne damnation, in beeing
willingly ignorant of the trueth: In
their best wisedome heaping vp teachers
according to their owne lusts,
purposely submitting themselues to
these prophets of the diuell, that so
they may be turned to their ineuitable
condemnation?
                     Secondly, It is manifest from the
Pride and Cunning of Satan.
                     
                     Who although hee naturally hate
God, yet in the Pride of his heart he
seekes to imitate him in all his actions,
that so he may more desperately
execute his malice both against God

in disgracing his prouidence, and against
man in furthering his destruction.
And therefore, as God hath
his couenant with man: so will Satan
haue a speciall couenant also with his
seruants.
                     As the Lord hath his Ministers to
execute his wrath vpon the disobedient:
namely, the Magistrate, so Sathan
will haue his badde Witches to
execute against the sonnes of men.
Yea,
                     As the Lord hath his Prophets and
faithfull ministers to relieue and comfort
his distressed people: so Sathan
will haue his good Witches, to minister
helpe to such as seeke vnto him,
&c.
                     And as the wise and mercifull
God, because wee are not able to
heare him, if he should himself speak
vnto vs, doeth therefore conuey his
will into earthen vessells 2. Corinthians
4. 7. causing men, like our selues, subiect
to the same infirmities with vs,
to deliuer his councell, and prepare
vs to the obedience thereof: euen so

dealeth Sathan the god of this world,
with the children of disobedience.
That whereas by reason of Natures
guilt and infirmitie, they could not
endure his terrible and personall
presence: therefore hee tendereth
his will vnto them, by certaine delightfull
and Familiar charmes, yea
by Witches his vassales insinuateth
himselfe into vs, colouring his presence
and sleights by some shew of
outward holinesse, as by abusing of
holie Names, Prayers, Reliques, &c.
that so hee may the better winne
from vs an approbation of his help;
and so the more dangerously ensnare
vs in his cruell pawes.
                     Thirdly also this is manifest from
the consideration of our owne cursed
nature. And that not onely because
wee are Sathans slaues naturally,
and so are led captiue at his will, euen
to further our owne condemnation,
and the condemnation of others:
                     But especially in regard of those
Remaynders of originall goodnesse:
                        
As some naturall light, some conscience
of good and euill, &c. whereby
wee being vsually puffed vp, and so
laboring to encrease these gifts: seeing
wee know not the right meanes
heereunto, namely, to seeke them of
the Lord: Is it any maruell, if we fall
to chaffer with Satan for the obtaining
thereof? especially seeing hee
will not faile to offer his helpe, and that
vpon very faire and seemingly equal
termes?
                     Now if wee consider on the other
side, that corruption wherewith we are
infected euen from the mothers
wombe. Two things there are herein
that further this compact with
Satan.
                     The one is, The earnest and vnsatiable
desire to accomplish our lusts: which
seeing we cannot compasse by lawfull
meanes, will we sticke at any thing,
though it be the hazard of the soule,
to attaine our desires? Math. 16. 25.
Especially, seeing as wee desire to
commit sinne with greedinesse, so
either for credite, wee would not be

seene therein: and indeed it is Satans
policy to blind the eies of our minds,
that so walking in darkenes, we may
not know whither we go, but euen
like fooles be led to the Stockes, and
oxen to the shambles: And hath not
this Practise of Witch-craft many cunning
sleights, and colours to hide
and cloke sin, to illude and peruert
our iudgemēts, that we may not discern
whereabout we are? Consider to
this end that which follows: & God
giue vs vnderstanding in all things.
                     Adde we hereunto, That as sin encreaseth
and ripeneth to vengeance,Note.
so naturall light by degrees is cleane peruerted
and extinguished. And the
bands of common honestie beeing
wholy cast off and violated, the bridle
is giuen to all desperate and presumptuous
sins: and that the wicked
may more securely reuell therein: religion
is made a scorne of,Psal. 10. 5. and God is
forgotten,Iob 21. 15. and the knowledge of his wayes
vtterly reiected: whereby the Lord in
iustice is prouoked to execute his
fierce wrath, and to powre out the

most bitter viall thereof vpon the
soules of the wicked, yeelding them
vp wholly to the power of Sathan:
whereby they are left to these desperate
extremities, as to make reall couenants
with him: to yeelde him vp
their soules, and all at his deuotion;
to consecrate themselues to his seruice
and homage, and so to become
spectacles heerein of the certainetie of
damnation, for the confusion of the
Atheist, that thinkes there is no hell,
and the warning of the Christian, to
auoyd the danger thereof.
                     3 And seeing it is the Iustice of
Almightie God to punish extraordinarie
and monstrous sinnes, with strange
and vnwonted plagues. Therefore seeing
the wicked cānot content them
selues with common and naturall
sins,Note. but must further deuise sins against
nature,Rom. 1 25 26. as being iustly giuē vp
hereto by the diuine Iustice, punishing
their carnall Wisedome: in their
strange and monstrous Idolatrie and
Will-worship by those monstrous and
vnnaturall Impieties: Is it not yet

further iust with the Lord, to leaue
them to be tormented by Satan, the
god of this world, whom they haue
consecrated themselues vnto, and
that with strange and fearefull conuulsions,
and horrible tortures, likelie
to rend the bodie from the soule,
but that the mightie hand of GOD
ouer-ruleth Sathan, and sustaineth
Nature, to the further aduancing of
his diuine Iustice and admirable power.
And yet all this in shew by the
ministerie of a poore, weake, and miserable
woman,Note. to the increase of their
rage, and confusion of carnall wisedome,
to the nourishment of Infidelitie,
and so to the sealing vp in these
bodily torments of eternal vengeāce.
                     1 And therefore; as this reproueth
such as seeme to elude all with a conceit
of melancholy,
                        Vse of c̄
                           uiction. as if these diuellish
practises and combinations betwixt
the Witch and Satan, were but fancies
and vaine dreames of a melancholy
braine: seeing the symptomes
of melancholie doe no whit agree
with the persons of these Witches.
                     
                        
2 As these, being fat, mery, delighting
in cōpany, & all which are contrary
where melancholy raignes: so
this is also a Plaine condemnation of the
Atheist of these Times, who doth
therefore willingly entertaine this
errour; That there are no Witches:
that so he may therehence conclude
to his soule, That there is no Hell, no
Diuells, &c.
                     3 This reproueth those, that, because
many things are done by the delusion
of Satan, (as hath bin manifested
heeretofore) do therefore conclude,
that al is but Illusion, and so would illude
the maine ground of Witchcraft,
namely, that reall couenant that
is betweene Sathan and the Witch,
for the effecting of such things as on
both sides are couenanted.
                     4 But especially, they are heere
iustly to be taxed, that howsoeuer
they will acknowledge the Badde
Witch to worke with, and by Satan,
because shee hurteth: yet at no
hand will yeeld, that the Blesser and
wise Witch (as they doe terme her)

hath any thing to do with the diuell,
by vertue of such compact: but rather
conceiue that it is some extraordinarie
gift of God, giuen to such speciall
persons, whereby they haue power
to dissolue the Witches of the
diuel; seeing it is manifest, that such
extraordinarie gifts now ceasing, and
this being proper onely to the Word,
in the mouth of a skilfull and approoued
good workeman to that
end, If any such thing fall out: it necessarily
proceedeth from Satans power,
permitted iustly by the Lord,
to preuaile thus with his dearest seruants,
to deceiue and ensnare vnstable
soules, that forsaking the God of
their saluation, runne to Sathan for
helpe for the bodie, to the destruction
of the soule.
                     And therefore, howsoeuer Satan
could without the ministerie of Witches,
do happily as great hurt to the bodie,
and therefore it may seeme, that to
vse them were needlesse: yet seeing it
is the soule that he principally hunts
after; & so, by hurting the body, entendeth

also the further ensnaring
thereof. Hence is it, that he employeth
these instruments, to accomplish
his will by, not onely ensnaring their
soules, by satisfying their desires to
hurt, and helpe whom they list: But
hereby also endangering the soules
of others.
                     
                        Both those that are hurt, in prouoking
them hereby, both to seeke for
reuenge abroade, against the Witch:
when as they should beginne at home
to be auenged of their owne sins: as
also to seek for remedy of their hurt by
diuellish meanes: and so they vsually
buy this helpe with the hazard of
their soules.
                     And so also enthralling their soules
yet more fearefully vnto Sathan: In
that receiuing help from such means
as are tendered out of his schoole:
heereby it comes to passe that Satan
is adored, and aduaunced aboue all
that is called God. The holie and
lawfull meanes of helpe are reiected,
and despised.
                     
                        Ignorance and Atheisme is nourished

in the world, Infidelitie and all
excesse of sinne, maintained and increased,
and so iniquitie ripened
vnto the day of vengeance. And
yet.
                     If here the cunning of Sathan be
to keepe these Witches poore,
                        Why Witches are kept poor. and
therefore it may seeme, that they
should haue but a little list to follow
this miserable trade: Obserue
we wisely the admirable Iustice and
Wisedome of Almightie God herein,
both in ouer-ruling Satan, that
hee shall not minister to the Witch
according to her desire; that so she
may be confounded in her dtsperate
bargaine, that hath parted with her
soule, for enioying of that whereof
she is disappoynted: As also
                     Heereby the desires of the Witch
being disappoynted, are more enflamed,
and so eternall damnation hereby
sealed vp vnto her.
                     And withall, shee more abiected
to the lust of Sathan, renewing her
couenant, and multiplying her sacrifices,
that shee may compasse her

desires: That so beeing still kept
short, and confounded in her expectation:
shee may breake out into
more desperate attempts to the ripening
of sinne, and hastening of vengeance.
                     Which shall with greater confusion
light vpon her, in that being
once arrested and conuicted by Authoritie:
she shall find her master whom
she hath serued, not onely to be the
meanes of her discouerie, and haling to
Iudgement, (as heereafter shall be
manifest;) but now he hath discouered
her,Why Satan for forsaketh the Witch after that Authority hath seized on hir to forsake her vtterly (in regard
of helping out of this brake;)
that so shee may be yet further confounded,
in her desperate choice, that
hath forsaken a faithfull GOD, to
serue such a maister, as will forsake
her in her neede: and that to such a
fearefull end, as heereby to sincke
her in horrible despaire, and so to exclude
her al hope of mercy and compassion
from the Lord; and thereby
to expose her vnauoydably to his
mercilesse tyranny.
                     
                        
And to this end serueth further,Why the bad Witch cannot help what shee hath hurt.
that the bad Witches power being so
limited, as hauing hurt, shee cannot
helpe againe; howsoeuer it may
seeme to imply a unllotie in this Trade;
or at least challenge the power and
perfection of it; yet indeed this restraint
of the bad Witches power,
tendeth much to aduance the Mysterie
of this iniquitie; as hereafter is made
manifest, and so to make good the
wisedome of this Art: Especially
seeing this both for the present
proues a great confusion to the Witches
power, as also giues occasion of her discouerie
from the Blesser, who in this
case is sought to for helpe; and so
detecting the bad Witch makes
way for her riddance that her Maister
Satan may haue more worke.
                     And howsoeuer when the Witch
is punished,
                        Why though the Witch bee punished, yet the affliction is not remoued. 
                        the partie afflicted hath no
ease, yet this doth not argue that
his affliction came not by that
meanes. But herein appeareth; first,
the absolute power of God, who
ties not the outward blessing simply

to the vse of holy meanes: Though
the Magistrate haue done his duetie
in punishing the Witch, yet the
party afflicted must still abide Gods
leasure, The Lord is not simply
subiect to man: Or else though that
outward meanes may bee vsed for
the punishment of the offender, yet
seeing the affliction must bee sanctified
before it shall bee remoued
from the Saints. And this proceeding
hitherto may happily bee a
meanes for the good of the Witch,
as being staid from further hurting,
and so happily as shee belongs
to the Lord, by this temporall punishment
may bee brought to true
repentance: But it cannot simply
and necessarily auaile the party afflicted;
therefore it is the great wisedome
and bountie of the Lord,
not to cease the affliction vpon the
punishment of the Witch, but rather
to linger it vpon his Saints, vntill
by more effectuall meanes of prayer,
and vnfained repentance, they
shall make an holy vse of the present

chasticement, And so in it due
season it shall bee remoued from
them.
                     And may not the wise and gracious
GOD heerby meete with
our Confidence in the meanes; not
remouing the correction, though
wee haue done the will of God
for the further Triall of our faith,
and aduancement of his absolute
power, in preseruing vs in this extremity?
                     And so thereby not onely confounding
Satan, and his instruments
which thirst for bloud: but
preparing vs heereby to a more glorious
deliuerance. And what if it
please our mercifull God to take
vs to himselfe by this strange affliction
doth not his exceeding mercie
shine heerein? Not onely in sanctifying
this grieuous affliction to his Saints,
though hee do not vtterly remoue it;
but further also in deliuering them
by this affliction from this miserable
world; or at least leading them by
the continuance of the rod, to

sound repentance, that so they may
howsoeuer be bettered by it.
                     And therefore seeing the Lord
can raise light of darkenesse,
                        The Saints subiect to this calamitie, and why. and these
outward things are common to all:
though the deere Seruants of God
should bee chasticed with this
scourge, may not this stand with
the wise prouidence of the Almighty
may it not come within the compasse
of this Art, to haue euen Gods
children afflicted by Witch-craft?
Shall not euen all things turne to
their good?
                     And what though the Word
seeme to condemne such as by poyson
take away the life of man; yet seeing
these poysons are deliuered from Satan
vnto the Witch, by vertue of
the Couenant betweene them;
                        Witches though they work by poyson, yet to bee punished for compact with Satan. and
though some hurt bee done by poysons,
yet much more is done by forcerie,
and imployment of Satan
personally to that end, seeing the
Word doth as well condemne these
Witches: Is it not manifest that such
there are to be condemned?
                     
                        
And though happily they may
speake many things falsly,
                        Witches though they lie yet to bee conuicted. as confessing
that to bee done by them which
is done by Satan immediately, telling
of many things that are vntrue, yet
doth this the rather argue that they
are led by Satan, that hee doth many
things by their appointment.
                     For seeing Satan is a Lyer from the
beginning, therefore doth hee both
teach them to lie.
                     1 That those which yet will depend
on them,Willing lie. may bee more inexcusable.
                     
                     2 That hee may also by this
meanes make a Trade of lying.
                        Why they lie.
                     
                     And hee doth also giue them ocsion
to lie vnwittingly, in confessing
that to be done by them which Satan
did of himselfe, that so hee
may hasten them to their deserued condemnation,
causing their own tongues
iustly to fall vpon them, both in punishing
their will though they did
no hurt in this particular, and meeting
with former hidden wickednesse
by this supposed & arrogated crime.
                     
                        But heere it is replyed, that these
poore women vse Salues and good
prayers to the accomplishment of
their cures,Witches though they vse salues and prayers yet be conuicted of sorcerie. and therefore neither
is it likely that Satan would conioyne
with such holy meanes, and
indeed it is needlesse, if these will
doe it, to admit of Satans assistance
thereto.
                     To which wee answere, that neither
are such medicines as are applyed
vsually fit for all such cures,
because commonly they giue but
one Salue for all diseases: Or if
they were, why may not Satan vse
these to cloke and colour his presence?
                     As for prayers, neither are they
auaileable in regard of the person,
being vsually prophane, popish, or
ignorant; neither indeed allowable
to such ends; but where other
lawfull remedies may not bee had.
And may not Satan hide heereby
his assistance more dangerously? May
hee not deceiue vnstable soules more
desperately?
                     
                        
Thus it is apparant that there are
Witches, both by testimonies from
the Word, and by sound reasons conuincing
the same: And so
                     Such obiections are answered as
seeme to oppugne this sacred truth.
                     Now let vs consider further what
Witch-craft is.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. III.
                     
                        1 What Witch-craft is, 2 Of the
causes, 3 And effects thereof.
                     
                     VVItch-craft is a wicked Art
seruing for the working of
wonders by the assistance of the deuill, so
farre forth as God in Iustice shall
permit.
                     An Art (I say it is) because it hath
it Rules and Obseruations whereon it
is grounded: especially the Couenant
with Satan, and the circumstances
                     
                     The Author of these Rules is Satan
the Prince of darkenesse raigning in the
children of disobedience, & therfore
by his knowledge of diuine duties

and malice against God and his children,
framing these Rules, to draw
them from the seruice of God, to the
seruice of the Deuill.
                     And conueying these Rules vnto
the Witches his chiefe Schollers, that
they might more easily and familiarly
teach the wicked, then if Satan
himselfe should personally appeare
vnto them.
                     And therefore it followeth that
it is a wicked Art, as proceeding
from so fearefull a Teacher, and tending
to so wicked ends. As
                     1 To worke wonders, whereby it is
proued to bee a Wicked Art, as proceeding
from that roote of Bitternesse
euen a Desire to bee like vnto
God;
                        Gen. 3. to the compassing whereof,
what more colourable then to work
wonders? Thus did Satan preuaile
with our first Parents, and thus hee
workes vpon their gracelesse posteritie,
as being incouraged daily herein
by our naturall corruption: And,
that especially discouering it selfe.
                     1 By selfe loue, and high conceipt

of our owne deseruing; which being
not answered, but rather crossed
herein, that he that hath most is neuer
cōtēted, he that hath lesse enuies
him that hath more: heerevpon Satan
laies the foundation of this Art
in the heart of man,Discontent in the heart of man. as heereby being
perswaded that hee shall worke
wonders, both to relieue his pouertie,
and aduance his credit, as exceeding
all in this, though hee come short
in other things, and hereby compassing
the height of his desire: Thus
did many Popes aduance themselues,
as Syluester 2. Benedict 8. and Hildebrand.
                     
                     This selfe conceit staies not here;
but as outwardly it affects to bee as
a God among men by honour and
promotions, so doth it also inwardly
affect and desire some such meanes,
whereby it may raigne in the consciences
of men.
                     And to this end, knowing men
to affect nouelties, doth it therefore
in Curiositie, search after knowledge
and hidden Mysteries, which being not

supplyed by nature and ordinary
meanes, are therfore not vnwillingly
sought by this forbidden skill: And
that the rather because hereby being
enabled to confirme such new-found
knowledge with strange & wonderful
euents,Curiosity by this meanes doth more
strongly bind the conscience, & detaine
in obedience: Although all is
done by no other meanes; but
                     2 The assistance of the deuill: wherby
it is further distinguished from all
other Arts, which produce their
effects by vertue of their owne ground▪
                        
not any outward helpe: As also especially,
seuering heereby the wonders
that are wrought by this Art, & those
True Miracles, that are wrought by
Diuine Power.
                     
                     These are such as are wrought by
the power of God simply,
                        True Miracles. either aboue
or contrary to nature, as Exod. 14. 21.
& Exod. 6. 7. 8. those miracles done
before Pharaoh by Moses, and Iosh.
10. 13. The causing of the Sunne to
stand in the firmament, The preseruation
of the Three Children in the

fierie furnace; Dan. 3. 20. Daniel in
the Lyons Den, Dan 6. 23. & Math.
14. Ioh. 9. these haue God truely to
bee their Authour, As being the
onely Creator of Nature: 1 And
therefore to God alone belongs to
restraine or extend the power thereof:
2 Especially seeing this is a
kind of creation, whereby that is
to bee made which was not before:
Ps. 136. 4. And therefore, if the Prophets
and Apostles haue done any such
wonders:Prophets & Apostles how they wrought Miracles. It hath beene, 1 Not by
their owne power, or in their owne
name, but by the Name and power of
God: 2 Hauing an especiall and extraordinarie
calling thereunto: Act. 3. 12.
                     Nay though the Son of God in his
Man-hood did many miracles,Christ Iesus how he wrought Miracles. yet this
was not by the Manhood wholy, though
thereby the worke being wrought,
was dispensed & acted in such & such
a visible manner; yet the work it selfe
being cōtrary to nature, was effected
only by the power of the God-head:
as in the raysing vp of the dead, the
man-hood vttered the voyce, but the

God-head fetched the soule from
heauen and put it in againe vnto the
body, yea giues life and power to
heare the voyce vttered to rise, come
forth: Ioh. 11. Math. 10.
                     And therefore seeing Christ as
man onely, could not work these miracles,
It followeth that whatsoeuer
are wrought by men are deceitfull
and counterfait, And being wonders
and strange effects are therefore
effected by the subtiltie of Satan, as
being able to doe strange things aboue
the ordinarie course of nature,
though not simply contrarie thereto,
which ordinarily the wit of
man cannot possibly produce: And
that
                     1 Because he being a spirit, is of
extraordinarie knowledge and capacitie
to search into the secrets of nature,
and there to frame strange and
wonderfull things: And that the rather
because
                     2 He is ancient and full of experience,
and so hath encreased his knowledge
and profited his practise,

which man by reason of his ignorance
and forgetfulnesse, want of
opportunitie cannot possibly compasse:
And this
                     3 The rather because Satan to
his knowledge and experience hath
great power sufficient euen to confound
all inferiour creatures if the
Lord did not restraine: And withall
                     4 Is exceeding nimble and readie
in exequution, being able to conuey
himselfe and other creatures in a
trice euen from farre distant places.
                     1 And so by vertue of skill being
able to apply Creature to creature
and the efficient causes to the matter.
                     
                     2 And that speedily aboue the
ordinary course of nature how can
he but effect admirable things:
                     3 Especially if we consider that
the Lord permitting, it is possible
for Satan to conuey himselfe into the
substance of the creature, without any
penetration of dimensions, and being
in the creature although it bee
neuer so solide, he can worke therein,

not onely according to the Principle
of the nature thereof, but as
farre as the strength and abilitie of
those principles will possibly reach
and extend themselues.
                     By this it is manifest, that Satan
can worke wonders, and these according
to his seuerall Quaelities, are of
two sorts.
                     
                     1 Illusions, or Reall actions,
                        Concerning Illusions. Satan
deceiueth, 1. The senses, 2 The
mind.
                     
                     The Senses are deceiued, when
wee thinke that wee see, heare, feele,
and what indeed wee feele not:
How Satan doth this, see heereafter
in the Sect: of Iugling: Galatians 3. 1.
1. Sam. 25.
                     The Mind is deceiued, when a
man thinkes that of himselfe which
is not true; as when men thinke
they are Kings, or Christ, Elias, &c.
                     
                     Now Reall Workes are such,Reall Workes. as
are indeed what they seeme to bee:
which though to men that know not
natures secrets, may seeme strange
and admirable; yet are they no true

Miracles,2. Thess. 2. 9. but Lying Wonders, in regard
of the end, for which they are
wrought, as to maintaine errour,
though not in respect of the worke
it selfe, Such were those, Iob 1. So
can Satan appeare in the shape of a
man, not deluding the sense, but by
assuming a true body, and therein
vtter a true voyce.
                     And yet he cannot Change one
creature into another: As a Witch
into an Hare and Cat; This is a meere
delusion of the sense, though the
like was done by the mightie power
of God, Genesis 19. 26. Lots
wife.
                     As for that of Nebuchadnezzar,
Dan. 4. It was no change of his
substance, but onely of his condition
and qualities of his minde,
Verse 31. The Lord inflicting madnesse,
&c. vpon him, to punish his
Pride: And
                     Thus may Satan worke wonders
but yet with this limitation:
                     
                        So farre forth as God in Iustice suffereth:
Implying thereby:
                     
                        
1 That God suffereth this Trade
to trie his children,Deut. 13. 1 and to Punish the
wicked, 2. Thess. 2. 10. 11.
                     2 That Sathan can goe no further
herein then the Lord permitteth: though
his malice be infinite, yet his power
is limited, Exodus 7. 8. 1. Reg. 22. 23.
                     And this the Lord doth 1 to confound
Satan in the toppe of his Pride,
and restraint of his malice; 2 to preserue
his children from his power and
crueltie, 3 to humble the wicked that
are his Prentices in this Art, as if by
their power, and not a diuine hand, Sathan
were brideled, and to confound
them also in their cruell expectations
and designes against the Church of
God.
                     ¶Thus farre concerning the Nature,
and generall Description of this
Art.
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. IIII.
                     
                        Now let vs consider further of Sathans
Policie in Training his Schollers to
this Art, as also in Trayning them
vp, and confirming therein.
                     
                     AS euery Art hath it entrance and
introduction, to allure and encorage
thereto, yea to imitate and happily
to beginne more rudely, and so
by degrees to attaine to perfect skill
therein: So is it in this Art of Witchcraft.
                     
                     The occasions that are ministred to
Sathan, to allure vs hereunto, proceede
from our selues: namely those
desperate passions of 1 wrath, 2 discontent,
3 reuenge, 4 couetousnesse, &c.
which being ioyned with a 1 contempt
of Gods ordinance, 2 grosse and
open prophanenesse, and 3 to desperate
impenitencie; do therefore giue Satan
occasion to conceiue, that God hath
forsaken vs: and so now is his time
to chalenge his owne, or at least to

set vpon vs, to make vs his owne.
                     To this purpose first doth he suite
himselfe according to our seuerall
raigning sinnes, nourishing vs in ignorance,
and so preuenting meanes of
repentance; and yet, hindering for a
while by all meanes the attaining of
vnlawfull desires, that so hee may
sinke the wicked in despaire, as being
vtterly out of hope, to compasse
their intents, and to satisfie
their lusts: prouoking them to further
despiting of GOD,
                        Note. and condemning
his prouidence, in not
yeelding vnto their vnreasonable,
and insatiable desires: And so by
this manner of meanes prouoking
the wrath of God the Lord further
against them, they grow to solitarinesse,
and heereupon giue fit oportunity
to Satan to enter them to this
mysterie.
                     ¶Of the manner of Sathans compassing
and trayning his Nouices to his Lure,
and of his notable deceipts, and impostures
therein.
                     
                        
THis is according both to the
Times wherein hee workes, as
also the seuerall condition and qualitie
of the persons vpon whom hee
workes.
                     You haue heard how Sathan dealeth,
to prepare the wicked to this
Art: Now let vs consider the manner
how he sets vpon them, to enter
them heereinto: Which is according,
                     1 To the Times, which if they be
of Ignorance, then he appeares more
grossely in some Carnall and vgly
shape, to bring into subicction by
feare: and so also, for the same end,
he appeareth in the same manner vsually
by night.
                     
                     But if it bee in the day, or in the
abundance of knowledge, then eyther
onely by some voyce, or by some
curious apparance, or by some friendly
resemblance; hee doth make his
way, to entertaine parlie with the
discontented and desperate parties.
                     
                        
1 Not being daintie to question
with them, What is that doth discontent?
and,
                     2 Promising them, a sodaine, and
certaine way of remedie.
                     3 Prouided, that they follow his
aduice, and do such things as he will
require of them.
                     4 And contenting himselfe with
some generall answer for them tending
to this effect, that they seeme contented,
desiring nothing more then
to know what particular meanes it
may be, that so they may be masters
of their desires; and so
                     To this end concluding of a second
meeting, for this time hee taketh his
leaue.
                     It is not long but he keepes touch
with them, remembring them of
their greeuances, reuiuing their
hopes for helpe, kindling their desires
to seek it from him: and so growing
to some particular terms, what
they must doe in requitall againe;
Namely,
                     1 To addict themselues vnto his service:
                        
and when hee hath gotten this
promise of them.
                     2 Then he discouers vnto them what
hee is: making it apparant by some
more terrible forme, and thereby the
rather to awe them with the presence
of his power:
                     And so to keepe them by terrour
from starting backe, and yet to giue
them hope by this resemblance of
his power, that he is able to do for
them, what they may desire, able to
confound their enemies, and defend
their friends.
                     And so happily for that time also
hee doth proceede no further with
them.
                     It is not long but he meetes with
them againe, and then proceedeth
to binde them to his allegeance, by
entring into a solemne league, and couenant
with them.
                     But before we do come to speake
heereof, let vs make some vse of Satans
former Policies.
                     Surely, howsoeuer it be common
to all.
                     
                        
1 To sinne of Infirmitie, yet let
vs take heede of presumptuous sinnes.
                     
                     2 Though wee sinne, yet let vs
not reiect the meanes which may bring
vs to repentance.
                     3 Let vs learne in all things to
cleere God, and condemne our selues,
that so Sathan may not preuayle against
us.
                     4 Take wee heede likewise of
Ignorance, and wilfull resting thereon,
lest hereby Sathan preuayle against
vs.
                     5 And learne wee to Moderate
our desires, and to get the victorie ouer
them, lest heereby Sathan take
aduantage to drawe vs to vnlawfull
courses.
                     6 Obserue wee the admirable iustice
of Almightie God, that Presumptuous
sinnes shall reape no better
comfort then despaire, and so by despaire
betray themselues to Solitarinesse.
                     
                     And therefore, to preuent despaire,
                        How to preuent despaire.
let vs daily renue our repentance.
                     
                     1 Renouncing our selues, by seeking

to the mercie of our God.
                     2 And take we heed of discontens
and murmuring against the Lord, lest
the Lord leaue vs to Sathans power.
                     3 And though we must daily distrust
our selues, yet let vs not neglect
the Testimonies to take the surer
hold on GOD; lest Sathan by degrees
steale vpon vs, obseruing his
Cunning,
                     
                     4 That first he worketh vpon the
soule secretly and afarre off: and so
commeth neerer to open contracts:
And therefore labour we to resist in
the beginning, vsing societie gratiously
and following our callings.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. V.
                     
                        Satans Policies in confirming his Nouices
in this their Trade.
                     
                     THis is discouered, eyther in the
Couenants that passe betweene
Sathan and the Witch to this purpose:
or else,
                     
                        Such other Stratagems and deuices
                     
                        
That are vsed to this end (of which
in their Places) to make them sticke
to their couenant, and so to performe
the bargaine.
                     Concerning the couenant, certaine
it is, that though (as you haue heard)
Sathan dallies for a time, to draw vs
on: yet at length he will not faile to
make sure of his Prentice, by binding
him in some solemne Bond to faithfull
seruice, and performance of what
hath formerly beene promised.
                     Now in the Couenant wee are to
consider.
                     First, the Nature and Qualitie of
the Couenant.
                     Secondly, the seuerall ceremonies,
enterchangeably concurring to the
solemnizing thereof.
                     
                        SECTIO I.
                        COncerning the Couenant; certaine
it is, That there passeth
such a Couenant betwixt the Witch
and Satan, as appeareth:
                        
                           
1 By the Testimony of the Word, as,
Psa. 58. v. 5. where the originall yeeldeth,
thus, which heareth not the voyce
of the Charmer, or Mutterer, ioyning societies
together: wherein, the holie-Ghost
both setteth downe the effect
of a Charme: namely, that it is able to
stay the Adder from stinging those
that shall touch him;
                        As also the Ground of the Charme,
wherein it hath it power: Namely,
Societies, or Confederacies, cunningly
made, not betweene man and
man, but as the word importeth,
betweene the Inchanter and the Diuell.
So Deuteronomie 18. ve. 11. The
Lord charges the people when they
come into the Land of Canaan, that
they should beware lest any ioyned society,
that is, entred league with wicked spirites.
                        
                        2 The practise of Sathan proueth
no lesse, who is ready to offer conditions
of agreement, as appeareth,
not onely in the proffer to our Sauiour
Christ, but in these daily offers
hee makes vnto men, to giue them

this, to do that for them.
                        3 The euent and successe of Witch-craft
makes it plaine; which being
sometimes wonderfull, alwayes aboue
the power of the silly Witch. It must
needes follow, that this effect proceedes
from some such compact with
Sathan; who is hereby bound vnto
the Witch to do such things, which
shee of her selfe were neuer able to
doe.
                        The End of this Couenaut is, To
make sure of his Prey, which by vertue
here of he seizeth on: The Lord
leauing rebellious man hereby to his
power, as by this Couenant with
Sathan, wilfully forsaking God, and
submitting vnto Sathan as his Soueraigne
Lord.
                        But heere it is replyed in the defence
of Witch-craft,Obiect. that both the
Diuell doth many things, and yet not
at the Witches command: and also that
the Witch wisheth, and performeth
much euill, eyther by some cunning
poysons, by outward violence, &c. or
at least, though they may be done by

Sathan, yet shee is not so much as
priuie thereto: nay many times shee
seemeth to be against the same, and
therefore it may seeme there is no
such Couenant.
                        To which we answer,
                           Ans. that though
Sathan doth some things beyond authoritie,
yet he doth other things at
the commaund of the Sorceresse: and
those which she commands not, though
Satan doth them; these shall be put
to the Witches score: yea, though happily
shee should seeme to be vnwilling:
because eyther the Diuell answeres
heerein, in some measure, the
generall malice of her heart, which is
to do more hurt then she can: or apprehends
some secret inckling, though
there be no expresse commaund: or
else, exceedes his Commission, to the
confusion of the Sorceresse when she
now shall discerne, how her seruant
is her maister, doing what hee list,
though he would seeme to be at her
becke. To this end consider we further.
                     
                     
                        
                        SECTIO II.
                        
                           Of the kindes of Couenants which are
made betweene Sathan and the
Diuell.
                        
                        THese are of two sorts: The first
expressed and man fist, because it
is performed by solemne words; Satan
appearing in some visible forme, and
the Witch answering really by some
forme of speach, tending to this end,
To admit of the Diuell as her soueraigne
lord, to renounce God, Baptisme, Christ
and all, to yeeld him all seruice both
of body and soule, while shee liues;
and so to leaue him bodie and soule
to dispose of at his pleasure after
death.
                        1 The occasion of this reall Couenant,
is eyther the vnsatiablenesse of
mans desires, which to enioy he careth
not what he parts with, and so
expressing those desires by some intemperate
and violent passion, giues
occasion hereby to Sathan to tender
this seruice.
                        
                           
2 Or else some extreamitie of affliction
so oppresseth him, that being
not able to vndergoe the burden, he
cares not vpon what termes he promise
his ease, and so is contented,
for present release, to aduenture a
future casualtie, Or,
                        3 Some matter of discontent, prouokes
to reuengo, and rather then
his spleene may not be satisfied, he
will satisfie the Diuells request. And
so by these and such like preuayling
corruptions, is at length brought to
this fearefull issue, as to engage his
soule to the bondage of Sathan.
                        Another sort of Couenant there is,
secret, and mentall, as wee say, performed
by consequence, and necessarie
induction.
                        
                        And this vsually serues the turne,Note.
because Satan hereby deceiues most
dangerously: as deluding the Witch
that she is free, because she hath made
no verball composition, when as indeed
by those meanes, she is bound more
fearefully.
                        Or else, this prooues in some cases

a preparatiue to the other; especially
when the parties vse such means
ignorantly, which are no better then
Sathans indirect and abhominable
pranckes to procure ease against infirmities.
As, to scratch the Witch, to
bang Amulets about their necke, &c.
which though some doe ignorantly,
as thinking some inherent power to
be in those meanes to cure diseases:
yet doth this by degrees draw them
from the vse of law full means, cause
them to rest in those that are vnlawfull:
and so nourishing them in infidelitie,
prouoke them in time to forsake
God; and so they are iustly left
to the power of Sathan, by him to
be ripened to the day of vengeance.
                        If wee would know the Tokens of
this secret Couenant.Markes of the secret couenant.
                        
                        They are, First prayer for vnlawfull
things: which howsoeuer it may
seeme to be made to GOD, yet in
truth it is offered vp to Sathan: so
that if now by such meanes wee become
maisters of our desires, this is a
pledge of this secret Couenant.
                        
                           
Secondly, vsing vnlawfull meanes:
such as are offered by Satan for helpe
in extremitie, as to goe to Blessers, to
scratch, to vse spells, &c. wherein if
wee be conuinced with the truth, that
these haue no proper vertue to doe
such things, and yet shall vse them;
This is an other dangerous bond of
this secret Couenant.
                        So that though all that vse these
things are not brought to this Trade
of Witch-craft, to hurt the bodies of
others: yet are they hereby bewitched
in their soules, and so proue spirituall
deceiuers, to enthrall the souls of others
to perpetuall perdition.
                        A third marke of this secret Couenant,
is an ordinarie taking of
Gods name in vaine; especially in
blessing of Cattell, which although
the ignorant and vnbelieuing world
hath taken vp of custome,And blind charitie. yet the
first tutors hereunto haue beene the
Witches, thereby to colour their
sorceries, and draw more Proselites
to their deuotion.
                        And therefore it were to bee wished,

that we were more exceeding
carefull in the sober and reuerent
vse of the name of God; especially,
when wee thinke or speake of these
outward things, lest Custome breed
profanenesse, and profanenesse contempt,
and despight of GOD and
godlinesse. And so, although at the
first Sathan enter not into vs, yet by
degrees at the length he may so farre
preuayle, as first to draw vs to make
charmes of these holy names; and
so secondly vpon the effect answerring
our Infidelitie, wee be further
drawne to vnlawfull desires, and to
be contented to submit to Satan for
the obtaining thereof, and so at the
length become practitioners in this
Art.
                        Vses of these Diuers Couenants.
                        By this it is apparent, that notwithstanding
the caueats of Atheists
and profane persons against the Doctrine
of Witch-craft: That certainly
there are Witches, as appeareth
by this Couenant betweene them
and Sathan.
                        
                           
And seeing insatiable desires are
an especiall cause of the making this
League with Sathan: Therefore we
are taught secondly,
                        1 To set bounds to our vnlawfull
desires; 2 to be content with
our estates; 3 to prepare our soules
to afflictions; 4 to enlarge our desires
for heauenly things; 5 to suppresse
our vnruly affections of euery
anger, and especially 6 to cast our
care vpon God in Iesus Christ, and
7 to haue our persons accepted of
God in him: that so we may not be
ensnared with Sathans baites.
                        And seeing the wicked are not ashamed
to make open profession of
their homage and allegeanee vnto
the Diuell: and therefore much lesse
ought wee to be abashed to professe
our Faith in God, to giue a reason
of our hope and confidence in him:
If Satan will haue reall promises and
verball contracts, not contenting
himselfe only with the heart and inward
man: Then surely ought not
we to content our selues with good

or bare purposes, but wee must labour
to confesse with the mouth to
saluation, as wee beleeue with the
heart to righteousnes, as Rom. 10. 10.
If Sathan will haue deedes as well as
words, then let vs also not be hearers
ouely, but also doers of the will
of God, lest wee deceiue our selues.
                        Lastly, seeing Sathan is growne
so cunning, as to content himselfe
with priuy signes and circumstances,
not exacting of all sortes publique
and expresse bargaines: shall not this
teach vs, not to content our selues
with bodilie seruice, and outward
deuotion: But especially, to labour
for trueth in the inward man? Shall
not this winne vs to watch seriously
ouer our thoughts and secret purposes?
Shall it not send vs vnto Christ,
for the daily purifying of our hearts
by faith in his precious bloud? shall
Shall it not still round vs in the eare,
to take heede of hypocrisie? lest this
be of al other the most sure bargaine
with the Diuell, seeing of all other,
the hypocrite is first to goe to hell, as

making a mocke of heauen. They
shall haue their portion with hypocrites:
of all other the hypocrite
shall drinke deepest of the cuppe of
vengeance.
                        Hitherto of the nature and kindes
of the Couenant: Now let vs
consider further of the conditions
thereof.
                     
                     
                        SECTIO III.
                        
                           Of the conditions of the Couenant betweene
Sathan and the Witch.
                        
                        THese are enterchangeable, as,
                        1 What Sathan will doe for the
Witch.
                        2 What the Witch must doe for Sathan.
                        The ground of this Couenant, is in imitation
of the Diuine Wisedome,
who by this meanes reuealeth himselfe
vnto man, and bindes man vnto
him: and so in high scorne and despight
of the Lord our God, by the
same meanes doth Sathan indeuour

to withdraw man from God, to enthrall
man more desperately to his
seruice.
                        And yet heerein to deceiue wretched
man; as by this outward ceremonie
of the Couenant being in imitation
of that diuine breeding in the minds
of his Proselites, an opinion of Sathans
deitie, and so thereby auouching
this subiection vnto him.
                        The Policies of Sathan in this Couenant
is manifold.
                        1 As first, to make them beleeue
there is a kinde of equitie in the businesse,
and so the rather to sticke to it,
the rather, when his performance is
present, their turnes serued, that
which they are to performe, to come,
vncertaine, they may repent, or, Hell
is but a Bugge-beare: yet,
                        2 To binde them more surely to his
seruice hereby, seeing in honestie they
are to keepe touch with him, seeing
he keepes with them; binding them
heerein by that bond of ciuill honestie

which Nature so much standeth
vpon,Note. and resteth in, thereby, though
confounding, yet also flattering the
same.
                        But hath not Sathan (I pray you)
in this Couenant with the Witch, a
further reach, to deceiue others also?
                        
                        Yea surely, and that many wayes.
                        
                        As first, heereby hee would beare
the world in hand, that he is now so
at the Witches commaund, as that,
neyther may hee bee thought to
haue any power else, but what is limited
to her lusts, whereas indeede
hee doeth many things of himselfe,
and yet father them vpon the Witch,
to flatter her in her soueraignetie,
and hasten her to vengeance: yea,
exceedeth often the Commission,
which hee receiueth from her. And
though she would haue many times
the mischiefe vndone and released, because
shee is tormented by such
charmes, as Sathan teacheth, to
dissolue the Witch-craft, as to burne
some part of the thing bewitched, &c.
and no doubt is in like maner haunted

with some heart-pang, and hell
of conscience, yet can shee not
giue the least ease to the partie afflicted.
                        Especially Sathan obseruing the
nature of man to be prone to Idolatrie,
his purpose heerein is to withdraw
the minde from God, and settle it
vpon the Witch: As if Sathan were
not Gods instrument to afflict man,
but onelie the Witches seruant to
doe what shee please, and so the
Witch and Satan in the Witch must
bee adored and exalted aboue the
Lord. Shee must be feared, rated,
yea, sometimes shee must be innocently
condemned, shee must bee
sought vnto, closed with, pacified
with gifts &c.
                     
                     
                        SECTIO IIII.
                        THat which Sathan bindes himselfe
to doe for the Witch, is, To appeare
vnto her in what forme shee pleaseth.
                        
                           
1 To confirme her conceited power.
                        2 To preuent that feare which
might arise from more horrible apparition,
and so to nourish in securitie.
                        Heerein he deciueth diuersly:
                        
                        1 As first, that hee is no where present
but in these formes.
                        2 That he is alwayes present in these
formes, whereas indeede he deludes
oftentimes the senses hereby.
                        3 That accordingly to the multitude
of formes, so are their many
Diuells, that the Witch may the rather
glorie in the multitude of these
seruants.
                        4 That the Creatures of Almightie
God,
                           1. Tim. 4. 4. which in themselues are good
and seruiceable for vse, may be feared,
and hated, yea adored, and respected
as presages of good or euill,
as, when a Hare crosseth the way, &c.
And so our right in the creature questioned:
But especially, Sathans
cunning in appearing in these forms
euen of familiar Creatures, which

if they can hurt, It is but onely the body:
                        
                        1 Is, both to hide that speciall Tyrannie
and crueltie of his which he
extendeth against the soule:
                        2 And to nourish this conceipt
by these appearances, that his power
is limited by that creature, and so not
to bee feared, so to bee lightly regarded
and despised of vs: as busying
themselues about such trifles, as
to keepe drinke from working, and
whereas indeed vnder colour of
these they prey vpon the soule, stirring
vp to reuenge, coueteousnesse,
vncleanesse, &c.
                        Yea ouerthrowing of Kingdomes,
rooting out the Gospell:
which that they may effect more securely
when they are not espied and
preuented, therefore they labour to
occupie mens mindes in these base
and sleight matters, that so they
might not suspect, or preuent them
in the other.
                        And doth not Satan notably delude
the Ignorant People, That by this
couenant with the Witch, to bee at

her command, hee maketh the simple
people beleeue, that he neuer comes
but at the Witches sending: And so
both prouoketh by all meanes to
curry fauour with the Witch, by entertainment,
gifts; what not? whereby
they become subiect, through
this infidelity, to Satans power; As
also prepareth way heereby to seeke
to the Witch for helpe; and so is further
ensnared to the danger of the
soule.
                        Nay doth he not by submitting
himselfe to base meanes: as by burning
a spitte red hote, &c. whereby
he seemes to bee remoued, herein
also further deceiue the simple people:
As with-drawing them from
the holy meanes whereby they may
bee releeued, and causing them to
rest in these accursed and deceitfull helps:
which either do no good at all, or if
they doe any, it is to doe a greater
hurt,
                     
                     
                        
                        SECTIO. V.
                        
                           A second thing whereby Satan binds
himselfe to the Witch, is to doe
whatsoeuer the Witch shall command.
                        
                        THat is, to lie still when she lists
to spare.
                        To runne and hurt when she is
moued, where and how it pleaseth
her lust.
                        And the more cunningly to conuey
and execute this mischiefe, to
shroud himselfe vnder any shape▪ yea
to conuey the Witch vnder any
shape, or forme, to the satisfying of
her lusts, and yet to deceiue her more
grossely therein.
                     
                     
                        SECTIO. VI.
                        
                           Shall wee now consider a little how
Satan deceiues by this subiection?
                        
                        
                           FIrst, in that he pretends to bee at
their command: he therby secures
them as if their state were safe,

they need feare no hurt from him,
seeing he is at their becke.
                        Nay he thereby Puffs them vp with
a conceit of some extraordinarie fauour
with God that giues them such power
ouer Satan: Nay he further bewitcheth
them that now they are as
Gods; being able to command Satan,
whom none can ouer-rule but
the Lord:
                        And so prouoketh to horrible blasphemie,
and Idolatrie, to aduance
themselues in Gods steed; to saue
life and to destroy it at pleasure: And
therevpon inferres a further securitie
of their estates; That they which
can thus dispose of others estates,
they are wise enough to secure
their owne: Or at least, what need
they more then to enioy this soueraignetie,
to exercise this liberty,Note,
thus to satisfie their vtmost desires?
                        Hitherto serues another sleight of
Satan herein: That being now at
their command, he hath no power
but from them: When they call he
must runne, otherwise he quitcheth

not: And hence ariseth this delusion,
That seeing they know what's best
for themselues, therefore they will
bee sure to keepe him safe from hurting
them.
                        And heere Satan hath another
tricke yet further to beguile them;
namely, to consire himselfe as an Ape
to his clog, to some Box or Prison,
where he lies, as bound not to stir
but when the Witch calleth, she, as
his Goalor, must giue him libertie,
whereas he still goes about like a
roaring Lyon, stirring vp in the
heart desires of reuenge, couetousnesse,
&c. while he seemes to lie still from
bodily harmes, and nourishing Pride
and Infideliue by this his sained
bondage, and so hardening in security,
while he ceaseth from outward
hurts.
                     
                     
                        SECTIO. VII.
                        
                           AND doth he not also by this his
sayned subiect on to the Witch deceiue
the Vnbeleuing world?
                        
                        
                           
Yea certamely, and that many
waies: As First, he with-draweth
them from the acknowledgement of
Gods Prouidence; who onely hath
power to send these euill Angels to
torment the wicked, and afflict his
children, and so to rob God of his
glorie herein, and to referre it to the
Witch, as if Satan were onely at
her dispose.
                        And for their further confusion
heerein, he prouoketh them in reuenge
of their wrongs, not to look
into their sinnes, which cause the
same, or to looke vp to God who
onely can heale, because he giueth
the wound: But to crie out vpon the
Witch, to harry her to the Iustice, to
scratch, and practise against her, and
so, many times, to shed innocent
bloud in accusing wrongfully: Or
at the best, though the Law may
bee satisfied, yet God is not glorified,
nor themselues truely releiued,
Seeing by vsing vnlawfull meanes
for helpe, though the body may
finde ease, yet the soule thereby is

more dangerously ensnared.
                        And hath not Satan another dangerous
fetch in this subiection? That
whereas many diseases come of naturall
causes, which are well knowne
to Satan, though the simple people
are vtterly ignorant thereof: Yet
seeing the Witch in malice intends
the hurt of her neighbour, and to
this end sets Satan on worke: heerevpon
it is concluded that all diseases
proceeds from Sorcerie; and so
heereby all sober and wise meanes
are neglected to preserue health, the
bridle is giuen to all ryot and excesse:
and if any thing fall out,Note.
the Witch is blamed, and not our
distempers.
                     
                     
                        SECTIO. VIII.
                        THus we haue heard one part of
the couenant, What Satan must
do for the Witch:
                        
                        Now let vs consider on the other
side, What the Witch must doe for him
againe.
                        
                        
                           
The maine matter is, that she must
giue her selfe vnto him bodie and soule,
But this is coloured, first, by the
Time, he will not haue it presently,
because yet she hath not made vp
the measure of her sinne: And therein
he deceiues her, that she may repent
of her bargaine, God may change
her minde, &c. and so drownes in
securitie.
                        And to this end he hath another
colour, that is, the condition, if he
performe faithfull seruice: And therefore
he will of purpose faile her sometimes,Note.
that so she may hope her selfe
free: yea he doth vsually leaue her,
when Authority arrests, to bring her
to confusion, that so now she may
shame the deuill, as wee say, and so
performe some hypocriticall repentance.
                        And yet for all this obserue, I pray
you, his Deepenesse, in making her
sure.
                        Namely to preuent after repentance,
or at least to deceiue thereby.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. VI.
                     
                        Of the Ceremonies of the Couenant.
                     
                     HE hath further diuerse ceremonies
accompanying this couenant which
tend very fearefully to the confirmation
thereof.
                     And these are:
                     
                        First, As the Lord hath a speciall
Seale to bind his seruants vnto his
obedience; namely, the seale of
Baptisme, Rom. 4. So when Satan
hath once obtained this absolute
promise of his Prentices, to yeeld
themselues wholy to his deuotion,
then his manner is, to set his seale vpon
them, thereby to appropriate them
vnto him.
                     And this is commonly some sure
marke vpon some secret place of their
bodies, which shall remaine sore and
vnhealed vntill his next meeting
with them, and then for afterwards
proue euer insensible, howsoeuer it
be pinched by any.
                     
                        
To assure them thereby, that as
therein he could hurt or heale them,
so all their ill and well-doing must
depend wholy vpon him: And that
the Intollerable griefe they feele in
that place, may both serue to seale
vp vnto them their eternall damnation;
And so to awaken and giue them no
rest till the next meeting againe, that
so they may hasten the vengeance
that now they haue tasted of.
                     This shall appeare the better if
wee consider the▪ 
                        next meeting, and
such circumstances of place and actions,
that are performed therein.
                     
                        SECTIO. I.
                        
                           Of the Place where the Witch is summoned
for further confirmation
and binding of her to Satan.
                        
                        When Satan the Prince of darknesse
that ruleth in the children of
disobedience, hath once entangled
this Nouice within his snares, and set
his Priuie Marke vpon her, thereby
to bind her vnto him more surely,
That she may bee yet further giuen

vp by the fierce wrath of the Almightie
to his power: he hath yet
many other Policies to effect the
same.
                        As first,
                        She must bee conuented solemnly
into the house of God,
                           Of the cōvening of Wiches into the Church. there to make
open testimony of her subiection
vnto him, by renouncing all former
couenants with the Lord.
                        And heere
                        Vsually, these things are performed
in their order.
                        First,In Daemonology. 
                           Satan blasphemously occupying
the Place whence the holy Oracles
are deliuered, doth thence:
                        First,1 Approbation of the couenant. require of his Proselite an acknowledgement
of her couenant, causing
her vsually in her owne person to repeate
the forme thereof: As IN. do
here acknowledge, that vpon such condition
I haue giuen my selfe vnto Satan to
bee disposed of him at his pleasure: And
                        Secondly,2 Kissing of backe-parts. when this acknowledgement
is made, in testimoniall of this
subiection, Satan offers his back-parts
to bee kissed of his vassall.
                        
                           
Thirdly,3 Information in the rules and mysteries of his Art. this being done, he then
deliuers vnto his Proselite, and so to
the rest (for many are conuened at
this meeting) the Rules of his Art, instructing
them in the manner of hurting
and helping, & acquainting them
with such medicines and poysons as are
vsuall herevnto.
                        Fourthly,4 Accounting for profite. 
                           Taking also account of the
proceedings of his other Schollers, and
so approuing or condemning accordingly.
                        Fifthly,5 Renouncing Baptisme. for their further confirmation,
he yet enioynes them another
ceremonie: Namely, to compasse about
the Fount diuers times, there solemnely
to Renounce the Trinitie, especially
their saluation by Iesus Christ, and in
token thereof to disclaime their Baptisme.
                        
                        Sixthly,6 Sacrificing of their bloud. and in further token of
their subiection vnto Satan in yeelding
vp themselues wholy vnto his
deuotion, behold yet another ceremony
heere vsually is performed: namely,
to let themselues bloud in some apparant
place of the body, yeelding the

same to be sucked by Satan, as a sacrifice
vnto him, and testifying thereby
the full subiection of their liues
and soules to his deuotion.
                        Lastly,7 Carnall and familiar conuersing with them. to gratifie them somewhat
for this their dutifull seruice, it pleaseth
their new Maister oftentimes to
offer himselfe familiarly vnto them,
to dally and lye with them, in token of
their more neere coniunction, and as it
were marriage vnto him.
                        These are vsually the ceremonies
wherby Satan binds his Proselites to keep
couenant with him.
                        And his Policies heerein are manifold:
both in regard of the Witches
themselues, as also in regard of others
that shall take notice thereof.
                        Concerning the Witches.
                        His Policie in conuening them into
the Church is:
                        1 Partly,Satans policies herein 1 in respect of Witches. to procure in them a
conceit of the lawfulnesse of the businesse
(as being done in so holy a
place) thereby to make them secure
in continuing therein.
                        
                           
2 As also to encourage thē the rather
to hold out by reason of the companie
where-with they meete, ready to
hearten by presence and example.
                        3 And doth not Satan by this
convening them into the house of
God, and there presenting himselfe
vnto them, procure in their minds a
conceit of his Deitie and soueraigne Power,
that so they may yet better conceiue
of their dealing with him, and
more willingly performe all couenants,
seeing as God he requires nothing
but his due, as God he will performe
with them to the full, and therfore
they must not flinch from him.
                        4 And surely if wee shall looke
vp vnto the ouer-ruling hand of God
heerein, in giuing Satan his enemie
leaue to Prophane the place of his worship,
and thus to appeare there vnto
his Proselites for their further condemnation:
May not the Lord haue
these ends herein in respect of these
Witches?
                        
                        1 That here they may receiue the
punishment of their grosse hypocrisie, and

prophanenesse for their former abuse of
Gods holy ordinances, and bodily
seruice, lip-labour, &c. where they
committed the sin.
                        2 That here they may be hastened
to the participating of this punishment,
by being prouoked to fearefull blasphemy,
and renouncing of that God
whom formerly they serued, and so
might bee more iustly subiected to
the power of Satan.
                     
                     
                        SECTIO II.
                        
                           And may wee not heere learne many
profitable things?
                        
                        Doth not our gracious God tender
some light vnto vs out of this
darknesse?Vses herein to the Saints. Yea surely.
                        1 Our Prophanenes is reproued,
                           1 Prophanesse reproued. that
abuse and defile the house of God with
our bodily seruice, & vaine thoughts
and speeches, rather like a company
of deuils, then the Saints of God.
                        2 Our superstition is condemned,
                           2 Superstition cō
                              demned. in
ascribing holinesse and perfection to
the place of Gods Worship, as if the place
did sanctifie our seruice, or sheild vs
from danger: as if we were free from

Satan when once wee haue got the
Church ouer our backes: As if no prayers
were auaileable but what were offered
vp here. Doth not Satan hereby take
away the benefite of priuate prayer
which indeed as the life and touch-stone
of the publike? Doth he not prouoke vs
hereby to rob God of his glorie, in ascribing
that vnto the place, which is proper
onely to his Maiesty? Doth he not
vtterly frustrate & preuent all spirituall
worship of the heart, as if the performing
of a little lip-labour in the house
of God would serue the turne; wee
need not stand vpō any inward touch
or feeling, it shal suffice that we haue
offered vp the sacrifice of our lips before
the Lord.3 Priuate praying in publique exercises taxed. Surely when I cōsider
the practise of the time, namely, when
we come to the house of God which
is appointed for publicke prayer to be
performed iointly by the whole Congregation,
we then fall to mumbling our
priuate deuotions, yea when the publick
Exercises are in hand, so that for the
presēt we neither can ioine with thē,
nay rather indeed do disturbe & giue

offence to the Congregation, in not
consenting with them, mee thinkes
euen Satans Proselites may heere condemne
vs, who cary themselues more
regularly in the house of God to
serue the deuill, then wee here to the
seruice of God. These wretches, I
warrant you,Customary and formall worship reproued. are kept from sleeping,
they spare not their bloud to please the
deuill, they are contented to submit
themselues to any base office heerevnto:
Nothing can keep vs waking,
not though Iesus Christ bee crucified
among vs daily, though we are partakers
of his bloud, yet wee will not kisse
the Son of Righteousnesse; we cannot so
much as shed a teare in testimony of
our renouncing of sinne and Satan;
whereas these wretches spare not
their deerest bloud to shew their homage
vnto Satan.
                        4 And are we not hereby taught,2 Instruction to wall in great feare in GODS house.
now to feare our selues most, when we
are before the Lord, in his Sanctuarie,
because Satan will now be one with
vs, both to hinder vs in the seruice of
God that we shall not profite, or else to

puffe vs with Pride, as if wee had deserued
much heereby: and then to accuse
vs of presumption, that so hee may
driue vs to despaire.
                        
                        Surely, seeing wee cannot be free
from Sathans snares, neither the house
of God wil protect vs, nor our owne
houses can shield vs, but Sathan wil
be closing to rob God of his glorie,2 To serch & subdue the heart to worship God in spirit▪
                           
and vs of the comfort of any publique
duety; shall not this send vs to the
searching of the heart? shall it not teach
vs to worship God in spirit: that so Sathan
may not bee acquainted with
what we are about, and so may not
interrupt vs, or if hee guesse at our
purposes, may be yet confounded,
in that our hearts are best knowne
to the Lord?
                        It is our comfort vnspeakable before
our God, that hereby wee desire
to worship him in truth, because,
as our hearts witnesse with the truth
of our endeuours, so doe they also
witnesse for God against vs, the imperfection
of them: that the Lord may be
iustified when he iudgeth, Psal. 5 1. 4. 5.
                        
                           
That Sathan may be preuented,
and confounded, by this iudging of
our selues, that heereby wee may be
daily prouoked to perfection: by labouring
to be found in Christ, not hauing
our owne righteousnesse, and so may
grow vppe in him to perfect holinesse,
Philip. 3. 13.
                        Shall not this teach vs to trie our
publike worship by this touch-stone of
the heart,3 Publike worship to be tried by the heart. and not the place? Shall it
not weane vs from the loue of this world:
seeing no place so holy, no meanes so
sacred, but by Sathans policie they
may be abused? Shall it not prouoke
vs to hunger after our dissolution,
                           To recant vs from the loue of the world. that so
we may freely and continually glorifie
our GOD in his blessed kingdome?
                        Doeth not this condemne that
pompous and carnall decking of the house
of God,
                           1 Reproueth pompous & carnall decking of god his house. rather to please the eie, then
affect the heart, rather as a Pallace
for the god of this world to reuel in,
and prey vpon new-fangled and silly
soules, then a place of spirituall worship,
for the great GOD of Heauen

and Earth?
                        Certainely, when I obserue some
occupying the place of Gods worshippe:
and thence deliuering vnto
Gods people Chaffe in stead of Wheat,
                           2 Here reproued carnall & merchantlike teaching.
nay sometimes poyson in lieu of wholesome
foode, making merchandise of the
word of God &c. may I not conclude,
that these are the diuells factors,
bartering their owne,2. Per. 2. 2. and their peoples
soules vnto him,Ezech 13. for alitle, vaine
credite, and for a few shekells of siluer,
and morsels of bread? heerein
farre worse then the diuell himselfe,
that whereas he meanes plaine dealing,
to drawe them to damnation:Note.
these notwithstanding pretend to
shew them a nearer way to Heauen, promising
libertie, when themselues are slaues
to corruption, and so nouzling in securitie,
and excluding repentance, do
thereby cary their people in a dreame▪
                           
vnto hell, 2. Pet. 2. 19. 20.
                        And when I consider on the other
side, that faithfull teachers, who labour
by enforcing the Lawe,
                           Faithfull teaching iustified. to bring
the people to a sight of their sinnes, and

so to a denyall of themselues,
                           Mat. 11. 28 that they
may hunger after Christ Iesus: being
loaden with the burthen of their
sinnes: That such, I say, are notwithstanding
traduced, as Preachers of
damnation, no better then Satans harbengers,
to driue silly soules through despaire
into the very snare and pitte of destruction.
                        
                        Me thinks I obserue heere, a farre
more dangerous practise of Sathan, then
this, with these Nouices, to renownce
their Baptisme, euen to cause the people
of God vtterly to reiect the true
means of their saluation, namely Christ
Iesus.
                        In that he will not suffer them to
see, what neede they haue of him, by
humbling them with the Law, that so
they might bee forced out of themselues,Gal. 3. 24.
to relie wholie on his sacrifice
for the pardon of their sinnes. Is
there not more hope of the saluation euen
of these Witches, that are thus kept
sensible of their wofull estate, either
by the smart of their priuie match, or
by such continuall tampering with

them, sometimes by vgly apparitions,
to terrifie them, eftsoones to keepe
them watchfull by continuall employments.
Is there not, I say, more hope
euen of the recouerie of such, then
of many thousands in the world,Desperate estate af secure ones. who
are lulled asleepe in securitie, and fatted
vp, without all sense of danger,
euen to vtter destruction?
                        Oh that we were wise to vnderstand
these things, to Trie the spirites,
and choose the good and perfect
way. Is not the Prophet a snare vpon
Mispath? and profound to deceiue?
Is it not iust with God, that because
wee haue not receiued the trueth,
therefore to giue vs vp to strong delusions
to beleeue lies, 2. Thess. 2. 11. 12.
                        Well, this we may learne, by this
impudencie of Sathan, in abusing the
place of Gods worship: and drawing his
Proselites hither for their further
confirmation in their subiection vnto
him.Instructiō to professe Christ publikely.
                        
                        And are we not yet further taught
hereby, to make a profession to our God
of our subiection to him,
                           1. Pet. 3. 15 and that publikely,

when wee shall be called hereunto
further by the magistrate, to giue
an account of our hope, or by the Minister
to approue our profiting by the
word; or by our Christian brother, to
confirme him therein? nay, ought we
not, to stop the mouthes of the wicked,
by acknowledging our soueraigne
Lord the great God of heauen
and earth: seeing the wicked are not
ashamed to honour their master the
diuel: glorying in this, that they are
the damned crue? &c.
                           Damned crue taxed. shall not euen
these silly deceiued soules, rise vp in
iudgement against such monsters, that
are drawne to that through feare, or
ignorance, or hope of present release,
seeing these wittingly and malitiously,
as it were defie God: & with an high
hand, blaspheme, and treade vnder
foot, the blood of the couenant, acknowledging
willingly, and with great
applause, their subiection to Satan?
Nay,State-christians condemned. shall not our Politike and State-christians,
bee condemned by these
poore and base creatures, who vpon
necessitie, and through faire promises

onely are brought to this subiection?
                        Surely, when I obserue, the wisedome
of the flesh in many great & mightie
of the world, that eyther come to
the house of God, only to receiue honor,
& to maintaine credit, and outward
esteem; or else, to hedge in some profit
and suck some aduantage hereby;
or else rather, to honour the word by
their presence (for this is vsually the
best end) then to be humbled and reformed
thereby▪ rather, I say, to controule
the ordinaunces of the mightie
God, then to be brought in subiection
vnder the power thereof: may I
not conclude, that heerein they rather
publish their homage unto Sathan,
                           As rather seruing the diuell then God.
then testifie any obedience vnto the
Lord? Are not these the very stratagems
of Satan, to ensnare vnstable
soules,Note. by causing them thus to abase
the word, thus to peruert the holie
ends therof, are not the wicked hereby
iustly giuen vp to the illusions of Satan,
for the profaning of Gods ordinance?
do they not by these abuses,

testifie their obeisance vnto the Diuell,
while they pretēd the honor of god,
doe they not in seeking their owne
honor, abase that which belongs to
the Lord, approue themselues to be
imps of that king of Feare, who in all
things seeketh to robbe God of his
glorie.
                        And what else may wee deeme of
the high mysterie of carnall wisedome
chalenging Preheminence ouer the
word of God,Authority aboue and cōtrary to the word, reproued. in determining Lawes:
besides, or contrary to it, confining &
suiting it to it crooked Rules; binding
and loosing it, for the satisfying of it
lusts. Is not this a plaine badge of
of that man of sinne, that some of perdition?
Is not this an apparant euidence
of it subiection to Satan? And if wee
shall scanne the mystery of that sublimated
policie:
                           Absolute subiection to man cō
                              demned. that nowadayes, he
is not a wise man, who is not a seruant
vnto men, submitting himselfe
to be new moulded & fashioned according
to the lust of his Patron. This blasphemously
chalēging him as his proper
creature; & the creature reioicing

as in his soueraigne creator, conforming
heart and hand simply to his deuotions:
May we not see Satan here
aduāced as god of this world in the children
of disobedience? May wee not
conclude, that such absolute subiection
as is giuen vnto man, is wholy taken
from God, and giuen to the Diuell?
                        
                        And what may wee deeme of the
common Idolatrie of all sorts?Diuers Idolatries of the world reproued. One
makes the wedge of golde his hope: An
other makes his mistris the soueraigne
of his heart: this, makes his belly his
god, the other sacrifices to his net, &c.
Are not all these (in effect) sacrificers
vnto the Diuell? Is not subiection
and homage performed vnto him, euen
in them all?
                        What shall we thinke of the generall
and ordinarie seruice of God in these
dayes; the most feare him with their
Lippes, but their hearts are far from
him: the best vsually serue him but by
halfes, they cannot be Saints, God must
beare with thē in some sin; they must
liue, & therefore they must strain a litle:
they are but flesh and blood, & they

do what they can, God must be mercifull
to them in this &c. Do they not in
all these, shew themselues seruants
to him, whom yet they obey, euen
the prince of darkenes, the great deceiuer
of their soules?
                        
                        Is not Satan the lord of their harts,
                           As the homage to Sathan.
while they serue God but with their
lips? & doth he not hereby hold their
hearts faster bound vnto him, in that
hee giueth way to their bodily seruice;
nay, will he not haue their tongues also
at his deuotion, at a pinch, to curse
the same God whom they seeme to
blesse,
                           Iac. 3. 34. or to slaunder their brethren, and
condemne thē of hypocrisie, because they
labor to serue God in spirit & truth?
                        And is not Sathans cunning the
more dangerous,Hypocrits condēned in that he is content
to hold the wicked but by one string?
Is not their state more dāgerous, that
while they seem to haue escaped the
pollutions of the world, & to make a faire
shew in the flesh;

to corrupt all the ointment of the
Apothecarie,

his full possession againe: euen by
reason of that one traitor, which they
shall nourish in their bosomes: Shall
he not reenter with seuen worse spirits,Luk 11. 20
and so the later end of that man shall be
worse then the beginning: The dog shall
returne to his vomite: and the swine vnto

our selues whose we are! and whom
we serue! how long shall we halt betweene
two opinions? If God be Lord,

then to giue him his owne,

Deed also,Phil. 2. 13 that wee may serue him
in Truth, though wee cannot bee
perfect:
                           Phil. 3. That the sense of our imperfection,
may still send vs vnto the
Fountaine Christ Iesus, that so from
him wee may still draw forth waters
to eternall life, being daily found in
him, not hauing our owne righteousnesse,
that so through him wee
may daily make our requests Manifest
at the throne of Grace: That we may
bee carefull in nothing,
                           Phil. 4. 6. nor fearefull of
any thing:1. Pet. 5. 7. Casting our care vpon God,
because hee careth for vs, and committing
our selues in well-doing into
the hands of our faithfull Creator,1. Pet. 7. 18 still
forgetting that which is behind,Phil. 3. 13. that
wee may hasten to that which is before,
for the price of our high calling in
Iesus. Who may not trie himselfe
hereby whether he be in the faith or
not? Who will not daily striue and

endeuour to make himselfe thus manifest
vnto God and to his owne
conscience?2. Cor. 5. 10 If hee that is in Christ
must bee a new creature;
                           2. Cor. 5. 17. so new that
all old things must bee abolished,
because hee that abids in the flesh
cannot please God, Rom. 8. And if
wee nourish but one knowne sinne
wee are guiltie of all:Iam. 2. 11. If wee must
haue respect vnto all Gods commandements,Psal. 119.
desirous in all things to
please our blessed God,Heb. 13. 18 
                           Not caring for
the flesh, to satisfie the lusts thereof:
                           Rom. 13. 14. Wil
it any thing auaile vs to plead Flesh
and Bloud? If there be but one thing
wanting, will all the rest any whit
auaile vs? If Christ Iesus bee not
thus vs in,Lue. 18. 25 
                           That the bodie is dead to
same,2. Cor, 13. 5 but the Spirit is life for righteousnesse
sake;
                           Rom. 8. Are we any better for
all our formall righteousnesse then very
Reprobates,
                           2. Cor. 13. 5. the very slaues of Satan
to whom yet wee do obey, to whom
we there performe most acceptable
seruice, when wee doe thinke it sufficient
to serue God according to the
flesh, either by halfes, for a seasō, &c.
                        
                           
Let this serue for our Triall heerein,Triall of sinceritie.
and let vs giue our hearts to obserue
heere further matter:
                        Doe wee thinke that Sathan in
tampering thus with Witches, entendeth
onely, eyther their owne bane,
or else, by them to hurt onely the bodies
of others?
                        No surely, as his principall end is,
by all meanes to dishonour God, and
discouer his malice, and rage against
the Almightie, so doth hee expresse
his hatted against God, in destroying
the Creature, and in the Creature that
which most resembleth God. And
therefore he not onely aimeth at the
Diuine soule, but by all meanes laboreth
the generall confusion of mankinde:
that so (if it were possible) he might
robbe God of his glory, in sauing any;
you see how hee spared not our
very Sauiour himselfe,Mat. 4. 5. 6 the head of his
Church, and will he not attempt (if it
may be) the destruction of all the
members? And doth he not prosecute
this his designe, in the other Ceremonies,
whereby he obligeth these

miserable wretches yet faster vnto
him?Vse of the ceremony of accounting with his Proselites, For, what else doth that other
practise of his ayme at, in taking account
of his vassals, and informing them
in the mysteries of his damnahle trade:
rewarding them accordingly as their
paynes hath beene, and enabling
them hereby to commit further mischiefe?
                        As hereby he blasphemously imitates
the Offices of that great Iudge and
mightie Sauiour:1 Sathan herein blasphemously imitats God, vsurpeth the offices of Christ. instructing them as
a Prophet in their seuerall dueties,
censuring them as a Supreame Iudge
and soueraigne, according to their exploits.
                        As their high priest enioying the
sacrifice of their blood, as a pledge and
bond of their allegeance, and satisfaction
for their failings: So doth he
hereby also more desperately insnare
their soules: As,How the Witches are deceiued hereby.
                        
                        1 Arresting them hereby wholly
to stand to his verdict, & so to make
a mocke of the day of Christs comming.
                        
                        2. Deceiuing them vnder pretence
of these naturall medicins,
                           Note. as if it were

by vertue of them, not by anie Couenant
with him, that such effects followed.
                        3 And binding them hereby surely
to him, by his familiar & carefull dealing
with them, in furnishing them
with all meanes, to become maisters
of their desires.
                        4 Puffing them vp with conceit of
extraordinary skill in Natures secrets, &
so with a vain imaginatiō to be as gods,
through such rare knowledge and
great power: thereby lulling them in
security: that so they may hasten their
damnation. Thus are these Witches ensnared
thereby. But may not this his policie
extend it selfe also vnto others?
                        
                        Yea surely;Conuictiō of idle ministers hereby. Behold (saith reuerend
Latimer) The diuell is a more carefull
and painefull Dioclesian in his charge
then many of our idle and Idole Pastours
are in theirs. Satan is neuer idle, he is
alwayes going about to destroy the
soules of men: These sleepie dogs lie
still in their kennells,Esay 56. 12 fatting themselues
with the fleece & leauing the
flocke to be deuoured of the wolfe.
                        
                           
2 Satan is alwaies resident vpon
his charge to keepe the same in his
clawes: These leaue the Flocke, and
attend the Courts of Princes, or their
Hounds and Hawlkes, or worse: as
for the Flock it may sink or swimme;
Better farre to bee such ones Dogges
or Horses then to haue their soules
committed vnto them.
                        3 Satan he will take account how
his Schollers do profite, he will see
that the non proficient shall bee sneaped,
and the painefull encouraged:
These by their euill example corrupt
the Flocke, discourage those that
are forward and zealous, encouraging
those that liue at ease in Syon, and
will eate any flye, as peaceable men,
quiet neighbours, wise and discrete
subiects, &c.
                        4 Satan will not cease to informe
his Proselites further in the Mysteries
of their Trade, that so they may bee
more skilfull and profitable in his
seruice; These complaine, that the
people haue too much knowledge; they
labour rather to keepe them in ignorance,

and to darken the light by their
prophane handling thereof, that so they
may plucke out the spirituall eyes of
their people,Note. and so to leade them
about with them,Iud. 16. 24 like blind Sampson,
to sport with their follies, and gaine
by their infirmities.
                        Thus shall Satans vigilancie condemne
the slecpinesse, and carelessenesse of
carnall Pastors.
                        
                           But this is not all that may bee gathered
out of this Ceremony.
                        
                        1 May not this bee a stumbling
blocke to the Separation,
                           Stumbling blocke to the separation. to renounce
our Assemblies, when Witches,
yea the deuill and all, can Lord it
therein?
                        2 May not this be an occasion to
despise the holy Ordinances of God, the
Word, Baptisme, &c. seeing they are
thus prophaned by these cursed miscreants,Stumbling blocke to the Familist and Anabaptist.
and so in seeking to runne
from God, or rather from the deuill
abusing these things, euen to runne
to him, with the Anabaptist and Familist,
for Reuelations and Enthusiasmes.
                        
                        
                           
If now wee shall take a further
view of that other ceremonie in causing
his Proselite to compasse the Font,
and there to Renounce her Baptisme: as
heerein he entends to harden her
heart the more, by this blasphemous
disclaiming of the Seale of her saluation,
and so to bind her more
firme vnto him;Policie in renouncing the outward seale. so hath he also diuers
Fetches heerein to deceiue others.
                        As First, to cause Ignorant and vnstable
soules, to rest in the necessitie of
the outward Seale.
                        
                        As 1 To feare damnation if they
want it,1 In causing the ignorant to rest therein. which gaue occasion to that
blasphemous and sacrilegious intrusion
of Midwiues to the performance
cie of that ceremonie in a case of necessitie.
                        2 To presume of certainty of saluation
vpon the hauing of the Seale; as
if outward Baptisme made a Christian,
and nothing else, and so to open a
gappe to all profanenesse.
                        3 And so by building saluation
vpon the outward Elements and
meanes; thereby to imply an vncertainety,
                           
and fayling thereof vpon the
want of outward meanes:To build saluation vpon visible means. As if vpon
extremitie, wee should bee enforced
to deny our profession, therefore we
should bee depriued of our saluation,
if by persecution wee should bee
driuen from the outward meanes, as
the Word, Sacraments: therefore also
our hope of safety were gone. And
hence
                        
                        4 Erecting an Anti-christian visibilities,
as if no Church; where no publicke
libertie of the Meanes: That onely
the True Church where the Forme
of Religion is kept a foote, howsoeuer
the power thereof bee therein
denyed.
                        Thus doth Satan deceiue by this Ceremonie
of Renouncing Baptisme.
                        And doth he not also notoriously
beguile vnstable soules by that other
ceremonie, In causing his Proselite to
confirme her subiection by venting of
her bloud and offering it vp vnto him
as a Sacrament of her loyalty,Vse of the sacrifice of bloud. and entire
deuotion vnto him?
                        Yea surely, he may pretend hereby

                           Thankefulnesse in the Witch
                           To the Witch. that
thinkes nothing too deere for him.
                        He may intend hereby the prophaning
of the bloud of Christ, as if her
owne bloud should seale vp her
faithfulnesse and pledge her zeale to
encrease his Kingdome.
                        He may hereby make her more desperate
and greedie to shed the bloud of
others in reuenge of her owne.
                        He may heereby prepare her by
this continuall issue of bloud, causing
paine and waste of the bodie, to hasten
her owne destruction by accusing
of her selfe, &c.
                        
                           But his intent is also to condemne the
world:
                           Vse to the world of condemnation. That will not affoord a good
word for Christ, not endure a fillip for
him, much lesse insist vnto bloud in so
good a cause, As also to scorne and
condemn the Manhood of the world
that consists onely in this, to shedde
their bloud in reuenge of their owne
quarrels, or for the defence of their
friends, A Witch will do as much to
please the deuill: A Witch will not
spare her bloud in her Mr. quarrell.
                        
                           
                           And so to deceine the world:
                           2 Of deceit; 1 Heretickes. As first
Heretickes, that if they iustifie it with
their bloud the cause is good; so say
the Papists, so boasted the Ancient
Heretickes.
                        
                        Secondly, seeing these Witches are
adored as Gods, in the hearts of godlesse
people, therefore if they spare not
their owne bloud, may they not be prodigall
of the bloud of others? This is
one ground of all that cruel murthering
of infants,Papists herein deceiued. of friends, of enemies; yea bathing
themselues in the bloud of Princes;
They (for the most part) are prodig
all of their owne bloud, yea they offer
it vp willingly vnto Satan, to preuaile
by this meanes in their wicked
purposes, and must they not gratifie
him with continuall shedding of bloud?
must they not satisfie their owne
bloud by powring out the bloud of the
greatest, that so thereby they may
make way for Generall conuulsions,
and massacres of all sorts.
                        Thirdly, nay who will not seeke to
imitate these ghostly Fathers; nay indeed
who can choose but follow them; either

they will cosen and disapoint their
followrs,
                           Practise of Papists. and so through discontent
and despaire will driue them to
Butcher themselues; or else by partaking
with them in their deuilish
plots, they will draw them within
the compasse of Authoritie, that so
their bloud may recompense their offenses.
                        If now for euery drop of bloud
which the Witch shall shed, she may
gaine so many soules to the deuill, or take
away life from so many others, Is
not her bloud deerely bought?
                        Looke to this you that seeke to
these Proctors for the deuill, you that
betray the glory of your God in seeking
helpe of Sathan: behold the
Lord will giue you vp, and remember
that which followeth.
                        You shall haue the honour to kisse
the deuils back-parts,
                           Vse of kissing Satans back-parts. and so hath the
Witch: The baser and vnseemelier
the homage is, the more it binds,
Reason being turned vpside downe cannot
iudge otherwise thereof: The
more vnseemly the more it binds, as

agreeable to flesh, that delights in
filthinesse, it is iust with God to
giue vp to such slauish basenesse, because
his seruice being most pure
and holy, is reiected. Looke vpon
Poperie the nurse of Witch-craft,
                           The glorie of Popish Religion it shame. most
glorious in her greatest libertie to the
flesh, in the grossest filthynesse thereof
commending horrible vncleannesse not
to bee named, as if delighted in kissing
Satans backe-parts: Thus doth Satan
recompense his best schollers.
                        That we may preuent this, learne
we to Regard the knowledge of God, to
encrease therein, to make conscience
of practise as wee know, so shall we
not bee giuen vp to such monstrous
wickednesse, Rom. 1. 28. 29. 30.
                        As for that Priuate familaritie
which Satan hath with the Witch,
                           Of Incubi & succumbi.
                            in
conuersing with, and carnall knowledge
of her body, whether this be performed
really, or by some collusion, it
matters not: I dare not simply deny
but that Satan may haue this dealing
with her, as being able to assume a
dead bodie that is not yet corrupted,

and so by his spirituall qualities so farre
to enliue the same, as that, though
not by any seed therein, because it appeares
that it purgeth out together
with other humours, immediately
vpon the dissolution, yet by some
other seed, stollen from a liuing body (to
which I rather agree, because it is
confessed that such seed is vsually
very cold) he may pearce the body
of the Witch.
                        
                        And further also so affect the
same,How Satan may haue carnall copulation with Witches, and of the effects thereof. as through the diuine iustice to
procure some monstrons birth, either
through mixture with the seed of the
woman, or else (which I rather incline
vnto) he may by his skill,
through Wind or other pestilent humours,
so affect the body of the
Witch as that it shall swell, and encrease,
as in a True Generation, yea at
the time of the birth, shall bee subiect
to paine and such trauell as is vsuall
to women in such case, and then
in the time of the breaking open of
the wombe may foist in some Infant
stollen else where, or delude the eyes of

the beholders with some Impe of his
owne, in the shape of a child; or with
some dead childe taken vp and enliued
to the purpose: Which things are easie
for him to doe, thereby as to giue
testimonie of secret acquaintance,
so to deceiue the Witch with her new
Darling, which likely shall bee but a
babie of a day old, so to encrease withall
her sorrow, and yet ease of the
trouble, which is happily the desire
of such monsters, that so they may
be free to the satisfying of his, and
their owne insatiable lusts.
                        This (I say) howsoeuer it may
bee granted, yet I cannot see but all
this may bee done, as well as others
of as great consequence, euen by
delusion and imagination; And yet
both to one end, euen to deceiue the
Witch, and Others.
                        
                        
                           Touching the Witch, she is hereby
deceiued many waies: As
                        1 She is fed with shadowes in
steed of substance,The Witch how deceiued hereby. with cold and
dead delights, in steed of reall contentment
of the flesh.
                        
                           
2 She is put to a great deale of
paine and torment in the bearing and
birth: and in the issue, either some
Monster or Abortiue is brought forth
to encrease her sorrow, and procure
Horror and Despaire.
                        
                        3 This disapointment of her lust,
enrageth and encreaseth the fire, and so
prouoketh to further mischiefe for
the satisfying thereof.
                        4 So is she faster bound vnto Satan
for the satisfying of her lusts; and for
the gratifying of her Maister, still
put vppon new mischiefes, that so
at length she may make vp her measure.
                        
                           Thus is the Witch deceiued by this
familiaritie with Satan: And doth not
this also proue a snare vnto others? Yea
surely.
                        This conuersing of Satan with the
Witch,
                           How others are deceiued. hath beene the ground of all
these Conceits of Fairies, &c. whereby
the Papists kept the ignorant in awe.
                        And is not the Lord robbed
heereby of the glorie of his iustice, who
punisheth Adulterie sometimes with

                           strange and monstrous births,
                           God robbed of the glorie of his iustice. That because
by this familiaritie with Satan
some such monsters are eft-soones
brought forth, therefore all such
effects are restrained to this cause:
either some Witches brat is foisted
in, &c. or else caused by Witch-craft,
&c. Thus is the Lord robbed of the
power of his iustice, when his immediate
hand is ascribed vnto Satan.
                     
                  
                  
                     CHAP. VII.
                     
                        Of Diuers other meanes whereby Satan
confirmes his Proselites in their
couenant with him.
                     
                     BEsides these former Ceremonies
and familiaritie, mentioned before,
Satan hath other meanes also, as
occasion serues, and their dispositions
sutable, to keepe his Nouices
from reuolting and starting from
him. For there is no question, but
notwithstanding all this former
making sure, yet some occasion

wil be offered to startle these Witches,
                        Occasions of repenting of the bargaine.
and so to procure some remorse for the
bargaine.
                     1 Eyther some outward affliction,
or their owne present case, beeing
likely miserable, suffring much want,
&c. may breed discontent, and so Repentance
of the bargaine.
                     2 Or else, the Lord may awaken
the conscience by the power of the
word, and so confound this desperate
match; or Sathan himselfe may
of purpose faile his pretended mischiefe,
leauing her for a season, or not doing
according to her commaund,
therby to prepare her by this qualme
to eternall vengeance.
                     Wherein, lest shee should now
grow altogether melancholie, and
so submit her selfe indeed to the true
meanes to vndoe her bargaine.
                     Obserue I pray you how Sathan bestirreth
himselfe.
                     First, in this case,How Sathan dealeth herein. he will not stick
to delude her with proffers of gold, and
daintie fare, graunting her opportunitie▪
                        
to satisfie her lusts, where shee
likes,1 making glorious proffers. as her age and disposition is, heaping
on kindenesse vpon kindenesse vnto
her; fitting her with musicke and al
carnal delights; flattering and crowding
most basely into them according
to their mere stirring and generous
disposition.
                     If by these meanes hee cannot yet
make them sure, but that the sting of
conscience doth still stagger,2 Vsing strange terrours. and chalenge
the bargaine; then he discouereth
him in another fashion.
                     
                     1 Not onely keeping them shorter,
that they may fawne vpon him, but
threatning to discouer them, that so they
may vndergo the punishmēt of the law.
                     
                     2 Yea further also withdrawing
himselfe from them, and so refusing to
be at their checke; yea crossing them
in their desires, and contradicting or
exceeding their commands.
                     3 If this wil not preuaile, then he
causeth them to renue their homage by
yeelding their bloud, to bee sucked of
him, which hee will not faile now
more freely to drawe out, euen to

fainting and extreame pining of his
staggering proselite, and appearing further
vnto them in most fearefull and vgly
shape,
                        Feareful Apparitions. thereby to hold them in with
feare, yea, not sticking sometimes to
threaten with present death, by tearing
them in peeces, scorching them with
flaming flashes, &c. and all this to
let them see what they are like to trust
to: that so euen through despaire,
they may rest content with their bargaine,Note.
vpon hope that their torments
may be yet deferred, or at least vpon
necessitie to please their cruell maister,
and so resolue to make the best
of a badde market, and to take their
pleasure while they may,: ot at least to
prepare way heereby for their discouerie,
as being weary of his seruice,
and greedie of further employment:
It vsually falling out in such cases,
that when by these terrors of Satan,
these silly soules shal be brought to despaire,
                     
                     The horrour of their Conscience
will not let them be at rest: but obscurely
euen now wil not faile to vse

often meanes of their discouery, eyther
by voluntarily coming to the parties
afflicted, to be scratched of them,
or confessing themselues in generall, guiltie,
of such and such things, and by
their diligence about the distressed
parties, and often enquirie concerning
them, or else by their faint and
sottish excuses of themselues. By such
like meanes, I say, they will not obscurely
detect themselues, through
the guilt of their conscience, and so
hasten hereby their deserued vengeance.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. VIII.
                     
                        Of the diuers kindes of Witch-craft,
where especially of Good and Badde
Witches, and that the Good Witch
is the most dangerous and powerfull.
                     
                     THere are two Principall kindes of
Witch-craft.
                        Two kinds of Witch-craft.
                     
                     Namely, Diuining, whereby
strange things are reuealed, eyther,
past, present, or to come, by the assistance
of the Diuell.
                     
                     
                        
Or working, which is employed
in the practise and reall working of
strange things or wonders.
                     Concerning the former of these;
my purpose is so far to speake thereof
at this time, as may concerne the
Discouerie of the Good Witch: who
specially triumphs in this power of
Diuination, and coniecturing of vnknowne
and hidden things.
                     
                     1 And therefore, first let vs consider,
By what meanes Sathan may giue
notice of vnknowne things.
                     
                     2 How far hee can proceede herein.
                        How Satā knoweth things to come, and how farre.
                     
                     That Sathan can discerne (in some
measure) things past, and such as are
to come, is apparent.
                     1 Because he is acquainted with the
prophecies of the word,
                        By aquaintance with the Scriptures. and so stealeth
out of them many secrets, concerning
things to come.
                     2 Sathan being exquisitely skilfull
in the knowledge of naturall
things,By skill in Nature. as of the influence of starres,
constitutions of men, the kindes, and
vertues of plants, rootes, hearbs, &c.
may out of this experience giue a

probable guesse, at euents of things,
out of the certainety of their canses.
                     3 The presence of Sathan and the
euill Angells,By his presence in most places. in most places, and communicating
their knowledge together,
where-through they are acquainted
with the secret consultations
of Princes, may giue also furtherance
to this knowledge of things to come,
as hereby being able to inform their
Agents hereof, who acquainting by
this means, the world withall gaine
this reputatiō, to foretell things to come.
                     
                     4 Adde we hereunto,By his power in putting euill purposes into the minde. 
                        the power of
Satan, in putting into mens minds, wicked
councels and purposes: which he discerning
to be apprehended, & resolued
on, doth thereby acquaint his Proctors
herewith, and so they become
to foretell of the same.
                     5 Consider we the agility of Satans
nature, wherby being able to conuay
himself in a trice from place to place,By his nimblnes & agilitie.
hee comes by this meanes to the notice
of many strange and hidden
things to the vulgar and ignorant,
and so communicates them, to serue

his turne, to his Proselites and Creatures.
                     6 Fspecially consider we,By diuine reuelation that Satan
being Gods instrument to execute his
iudgements in the world: hath therefore
euen from the Lord reuealed vnto
him many things; as the place,M. Perkins time,
and manner, how such things should
be done: which Sathan (being no
blab) can publish to serue his turne,
so farre as shall tend to the triall of
the Church, and stumbling of the
vnbeleeuing world: thus he came to
reueale vnto Saul his end, as being informed
thereof by the Lord: who
had taken his good Spirit from Saul, &
left him to Sathan, and so informed
Satan in the meanes to execute his
wrath vpon him, 1. Sam. chapter 28.
verses 20. 21.
                     Thus may Satan attaine to some knowledge
of things to come.
                     If we would know how farre:
                     1 Surely, wee are to vnderstand,How God knoweth things to come, and how Satan
that to the Lord only belongeth this
absolute prerogatiue, as to know things
to come certainely, &c.
                     
                     
                        
2 In The nature of the things themselues,
without respect to their causes and
signes.
                     But Sathan onely knoweth them
probably, and by their signes & causes.
                     
                     This ground being laid, we may
hence gather, that the good Witches
being informed by Satan, know no
further then their Tutor, that is, probably,
doubtfully, and deceitfully: and
therefore must needes deceiue themselues
and others.
                     This shal appeare the rather, if we
consider the meanes, whereby they
attaine to this knowledge: which
being no ordinance of God, to reueale
secrets, nor any instinct of Nature
yeelding directly such effects: it
must needs follow, That the knowledge
contriued there-from, proceedeth
from Satans cunning, shrowding
his familiaritie and intelligence vnder
the rule of these creatures, that so
it may not be discernd to come from
him, but rather from the prediction
of the Rule of Nature: as also, if it
prooue doubtfull and contrary: yet

Sathans credite may be saued: seeing
he can post it off to the vncertainety
of the Creatures, or some accident altering
the former prediction.
                     It being most certaine, that as the
knowledge of Satan of himselfe, is at
the best doubtful & coniecturall in many
things: so it becomes hereby much
more intricate and deceitfull, when it
is shrowded vnder the maske of Natures
infolded varietie.
                     
                     What this varietie of Nature is, appears
by the ancient practise of the heathen,
among whom, by these & such
like means Satan raigned as the vnknowne
God.
                     These were the Flight of Birds.
                        Actes 17.
                     
                     2 The Intrailes of beasts.
                     3 The obseruation of the Stars and
those celestiall bodies, Esay 44.
                     4 Dreames, Dan. 4.
                     5 Lottes, Hest. 3.
                     Of all which we may thus conclude,
That seeing 1 these were not ordained
constantly to fore-tell things to
come, 2 neyther haue any naturall
propertie inherent in them, yeelding

such knowledge, or any likelihoode
thereto: neither indeed was it necessarie
that men should be acquainted
with what is afterward, otherwise
then may concerne their Saluation:
seeing the word is sufficient for this:
therefore it followeth necessarily:
                     1 That these are but Satans cloaks
to conceale his immediate and dangerous
Couenants with men.
                     2 That by these Satan withdraws
men from embracing of the word.
                     
                     3 That for the contempt of the word,
the Lord in iustice giues vp to be deceiued
by these,2. Thess. 2. 11. 12 so farre forth, as not
only to rest in these predictions, and
so by the vncertaintie thereof to bee
confounded thereby: but as if so be the
reason of this vncertainety, and fayling
in the successe of these predictions,Note.
proceeded rather from want of our
obsequiousnes, and diligence in attending
these predictions, then of anie
reall improbability and absurdity in
them: hereby Satan maketh way for
his further aduancing in our hearts
aboue all that is called God, by procuring

vs to a more base subiection and
bondage to the Lawe of the Creatures,
toyling vs with a more painefull studie
and inquisition into the bookes of
the Creatures. And so prouoking vs
to a worship of the Creature, by confidence
therein, aboue the Creator
blessed for euermore; And so in the
Creature to worshippe the Diuell especially:
                     And that;
                     1 By obeying his councell, in leading
vs to know, what concernes vs
not.
                     2 By vsing his meanes, for the
compassing of this knowledge.
                     3 And by resting still in the meanes,
though yet they doe deceiue vs.
                     4 Embracing his intelligence, clouded
vnder the vaile of naturall causes.
                     6 Referring the successe of things, not
to the prouidence of God, but to the power
of satā, ordering the same therby.
                     
                        For our further information heerein,
examine we in few words these kinds
in particular, that so the vanitie of

them, as they are vsed, in Witchcraft,
may the more liuely appeare to vs.
                     First,Diuinatiō by slight of Birds condēned. concerning the flight of Birds,
and the noise they make in the same;
this, as it is plainely condemned in
Deut. 18. 10. & 11. so is there great
reason hereof, seeing by no ordinance
of God, or secret of Nature, the flying
high or lowe, on the right hand, or on
the left, the diuersitie of noise &c. can
prognosticate of things to come.
                     As for the entrailes of beasts, Ezech.
                        Diuinatiō by entrals of beasts wicked.
21. 11. whereby Nehuchadnezzar is
resolued in a doubtfull case, whether
to attempt first; eyther the Iewes, or
Amonites: this also is a plaine colour
of Satans deceit, cōiecturing hereby,
because neither by vertue of Creatures,
nor by any speciall ordinance of
God afterward, haue these Inwards
of the Creatures any such power cō
                        ferred
into them, to fore-tell things to
come. Indeed, there is some prediction
naturally arising out of obseruation of the
seasons & alterations of weather,
                        Mat. 16. 2. 3. accruing
to the Phisition, Mariner, & Husbandman.
And this according to that

order, God hath set in nature, from
the beginning: but this is only probable,
as to guesse of faire or foule wether.
Which, though they allow some predictions
by these Creatures, yet are
they no warrant for others, that are
not ordained of God thereto.
                     
                     And therefore,Predictiōs by what creatures vnlawfull. whereas it is ordinarie
to diuine of future things, by
some such like, as by finding a peece of
iron, signifying good lucke, but if siluer
be found, then it is euill; to haue a
Hare crosse the way; to haue the salt fall
towards him &c. these hauing no such
vertue from Nature and diuine ordinatiō,
it must needs follow, that they
are diabolical, or at least superstitious,
& no way warrantable. Concerning
diuination by Stars, the matter seemes
more difficult.
                     For although the word seemeth to
condemne the same,Diuinatiō by Starres vnlawfull Reason. 
                        Deut. 18. 10. 11.
according to the iudgement of the
best Diuines, who though they differ
about the Notation of the word, yet
they agree all in this,Esay 47. 13 14. that diuination
by Stars is directly forbidden:Dan. 2. 2. And

the Scriptures also in allotting the
same Punishment to the starre-gazer, as
to the Magician, doe confirme the
same. Yet hath this skill gained
great authoritie and account in the
world, and doth much deceiue the
followers thereof: And that for these
respects.
                     
                     First,Obiect. 1. because the Starres are causes
of many things heere below, and therefore
it may seeme lawful to conclude
and coniecture from such causes.
                     And surely if they were particular
causes of these lower things,Answ. I see
not but wee might coniecture some
what in particular from them: If these
Starres had power to communicate the
knowledge thereof in particular vnto vs,
Or if it were needfull that wee should
know such particular euents, Or there
were no other meanes to communicate
what is necessarie vnto vs:
                        Reasons Why. But Seeing
1. the Starres are onely generall causes
of things in the world, and that
not certaine and infallible, but
variable and subordinate, to the will
of the Creator, who can for his

Churches good, alter their particular
effects. 2. Seeing they are no ordinance
of God to reueale such things vnto vs,
as hauing no vertue from their generall
influence to dispose and determine of
particulars. 3. Seeing it is is not needfull
wee should know of such particulars,
any otherwise then the Word doth
supply: And if this bee sufficient what
neede wee other? It must needs follow
that these predictions are vnlawfull.
4. As reiected of the Lord, and
therefore proceeding from the deuill.
5. As presuming to fore-tell particular
euents of things, which onely
belong vnto the all-seeing and most
wise God.
                     2 If it be alleaged,Obiect. 2. that What is
fore-told by Astrologie, vsually fals out
true, and therefore why may we not
be informed hence?
                     
                        We answer,
                        Answ. 1. That though it fell out
true, yet were we not to enquire from
hence, seeing the Word forbiddeth
the vse of such meanes.
                     2 That things fal out true in particular
proceeds not frō the necessary influence

of the heauēly bodies, but from
the cunning of that infernall spirit,
who supplieth by his knowledge,
what is vncertain in that Art, Insinuating
himselfe into the minde of the
Stargazer,
                        Note. being now puffed vp with
his knowledge, and desiring successe
therein, to satisfie his pride, what art
cannot make good, he yet desireth
may be accomplished. And so is giuē
vp to Satan in a iust punishment of
this his presumption, to be lessoned by
him in such further Euents: and yet
most fearfully to be deceiued by him to,
as shrowding his diuellish inspirations
vnder the cloake of that otherwise
lawfull knowledge.
                     For not to deny that, which the euidence
of things doth auouch in this
case:
                     True it is,Astronomy how far lawfull that the Sunne and the
Moone were created for signes, Genesis
1. 14. and so, so farre as they are ordained
for signes, namely, to distinguish
Times and Seasons, as Sommer,
Winter, Spring. &c. Alterations of weathers
in generall, they are to be obserued

of vs: but, that hence we may
gather any demonstration for the knowledge
of particulars, to fall out in the
world: seeing their grounds are vncertain,
and the meere fictions of mans
braine, exalting himselfe heerein in
his Pride and Curiositie, aboue all that
is called God. It must needes follow,
that this is but a cloake of Sathans
forgerie, and not any Art allowable
from the Lord.
                     That thé grounds are vncertaine and
most deceitfull,
                        Grounds vncertain. is apparent.
                     1 First,Reason. Because the Rules of this
Art haue no Foundation in Experience:
Seeing both the position of the heauens,
and the course of the Starres
is mutable, and therefore can be no
Rule of certayne and immutable
grounds (such as the Principles of Art
must be.)
                     2 And secondly, there can be no
certaine Rules giuen of those things,
which are not knowne: Now, who knoweth
the particular estate of all the
Starres? or if he know them, is there
any yet able to discerne the particular

vertues of them, seeing there influences
in the Aire, and vpon the earth, are
confused and vncertaine?
                     3 But the speciall Reason of the vnlawfulnesse
of this Art, is because it
requireth confidence in the same,
                        Note. nay in
the Author therof; They must beleeue
he can resolue them: otherwise if
he come doubting of his abilitie, or in
way of tempting him, he cannot helpe
him. Now in common vnderstanding
if the Diuiner bring the thing to
passe, here must needs be more then
Art; For he that is Maister of a lawfull
Art, can worke by his Rules, whether
a man beleeue he can or no: And
therefore it necessarily followeth,
that this Art is Diabolicall, as requiring
that seruice which is due onely to God;
and so thereby entending the bondage
of the soule, as is apparant by
the Rules and Confessions of the Chaldeans
themselues.
                     If here it shall be questioned howObiect. 3.
                        Moses and Daniel can then be said to
haue skill in all the wisedome of Egyptians
and Chaldeans, Act. 7. 22. Dan. 1. 17
                     
                        
The Answere is plaine,
                        Answ. either they
might haue skill so far as was lawfull,
or though they vnderstood the mysterie
of these deuillish Arts, yet it
was not to practise, but rather to condemne
the same, and so to dehort from
the studie thereof.
                     Well, let this lesson Students,
                        Vse to Students. that
they be not bewitched with the glory
& skil which this Art pretendeth.
                     Let it aduice vs not to run to Figerflingers,
                        To all Christians
to recouer things lost.
                     Let it admonish vs that it is deuillish
to obserue the Signe for letting of
bloud,
                        To Physisitians and Chirurgeons: no Zodiack nor Signes. whose ground is meere superstitious
and diabolicall, seeing the
ground is a meere Figment, namely; that
there is a Zodiacke and twelue Signes
therein,Letting of bloud by obseruation of the Signe condemned. being a deuice of Poetrie and
vaine Philosophie, nature yeelding no
such Ramme, or Bull. &c. as they foolishly
imagine.
                     And the Deuice confounds it selfe,
as is plaine by the absurd relation
and proportion betweene the Rule and
the thing ruled, as that the Moone
should rule in the cold and moist

parts, when shee is in hot and dry
Signes, whereas rather when it is in
hot Signes, it should rule the hot
parts and so contrarie.
                     So that now the Learned Physition
hath disclaimed this Bug-beare, and
therefore if it preuaile, it rather proceeds
from our strong imagination, and
Gods diuine Iustice, in punishing our infidelitie,
then from any power in that
Poeticall Fiction.
                     
                     4 Let this also reforme in vs
That superstitious obseruation of daies
and times,
                        Obseruation of daies and times condemned. as if some were luckie and
successefull, others euill and vnluckie.
                     
                     Wherein if the successe answere
our conceipt, it proceedeth not from
the Order in Nature, or Rules of Art,
but from Diabolicall confidence, and
Diuine Iustice, giuing vp to be deceiued
with our owne counsels, and so
by degrees, to grow further in league
and bondage vnto Satan.
                     Now concerning prediction by
dreames,
                        Obseruation of dreames, how lawfull and vnlawfull. though it must needes bee
granted that this was one of Gods
Ordinances to reueale his will vnto

his seruants, as Numb. 13. 6. Iob. 33.
15. Math. 1. 20. 2. 13. 19. Gen. 37. 7. 9.
& 41. 25. Dan. 9. &c Yet hath Satan
cunningly imitated God euen in this
point also, to deceiue his Proselites
by Dreames and Visions, and so
thereby to enable them to fore-tell
things to come; as appeareth, Deut.
13. 3. Ier. 23. 25.
                     The Maistery will bee how wee
shall discerne and distinguish betweene
these Dreames:
                        How to discerne betweene Diuine & Diabolical Dreames. To this end
                     Let vs take notice that as there
are Three sorts of dreames:
                     
                     1 Such as prooeed immediately from
the Lord, as those before,3 kind of dreames. and therefore
called Diuine.
                        1 Diuine.
                     
                     2 Naturall dreames,
                        2 Natural. proceeding
from naturall causes: 1. As thoughts
of the minde: 2. Affections of the
heart; 3. Or constitution of the bodie,
according to which sutably
seuerall dreames do follow:1 From Complexion. To Cholericke
persons dreames of Warres, to
Phelegmaticke of Waters, Fearefull
dreames to Melancholicke persons,
&c.
                     
                        
2 And so also by these Dreames
may we coniecture of the sinnes of the
heart:
                        From condition of sinne. because what we conceiue or
practise in the day, will be corruptly
dreamed of in the night, to make vs
more inexcusable.
                     3 Diuellish Dreames framed in
the braine by Satan;Diabolicall. answerable to
our desires, as appeareth not onely
by the practise of the Gentiles, who
receiued their answers by Dreames,
but also by the practise of Heretikes,
as the Maniches, Anabaptists, Familists,
&c. who haue beene confirmed
in their diuellish errours, by Reuelations
and Dreames.
                     Thus, as heereby it is apparant,
there are diuers kindes of Dreames:
so may wee also for our Instruction,
obserue many liuely differences betweene
Diuine and Satanicall Dreames.
As,
                     First, diuine Dreames concerne
Generall and Necessarie things to
bee knowne, as the comming of
Christ, Reuealing of Antichrist, &c.
but those from Sathan, are either of

curious, or triuiall and vaine matters,
eyther not fit, or worthie to be
knowne.
                     If it shall be said,How the Sybilles spake of Christ. That the Sybills
Satans prophets spake of these things:
the answere is,
                     1 That so farre as they spake of
them, they had their information
from Satan, who being acquainted
with the prophecies,
                        Diffrence betweene Diuine & Diabolicall prophecies of Christ. did informe his
disciples accordingly:
                     2 Yet so, as that neyther could he
acquaint them with any distinct or
cleare knowledge thereof: but rather
onely in a confused and darke manner,
whereby they might rather
stumble, then informe others to beleeue
the same, neyther did his prophets
loue and affect the things that were reuealed,
but rather were constrained
to publish so much,Note. as might make
the times inexcusable, and so had no
power to benefit others thereby.
                     But in Diuine Dreames the
case is cleane contrarie, for in
this place heere is vouchsafed vnto
vs, both a verie cleare and

                        manifest reuelation of such things as
concerne the good of the Church.
                     2 The minde of Gods seruants are
affected and subdued to beleeue the
same.
                     3 And they are enabled to communicate
so farre vnto others, as that so
many as are ordained to saluation shall
giue credit and obedience therevnto:Act. 13.
And the rather,
                     
                     Because these Diuine Dreames are
not onely agreeable vnto the blessed
Word, and so safely to bee beleeued,
whereas Satanicall Dreames, as they
are diuerse, or contrary to the Word,
so they labour especially to withdraw
from obedience therevnto.
                     4 But especially, whereas the end
of Satans Enthusiasmes is to set vp
Idolatry, and nourish all Atheisme
and securitie, Deu. 13. On the contrarie,
Diuine Dreames aime onely at the
True worship of God, and further the
doctrine and obedience of the
Gospell.
                     5 And heere wee are wisely also
to distinguish of the Times, For seeing

now we haue the Gospell sufficient
to reueale the will of God,
                        No diuine dreames now to be expected. therefore we
are not in these daies to build vpon
Dreames;
                        2. Tim. 3. 17. so that howsoeuer they
were ordinary before and vnder the
Law, yet now if any shall rest herein,
and expect resolution heereby,
wee are to conclude that it is rather
a Satanicall illusion then any warning
from the Lord, and therefore at no
hand to be heeded of vs.
                     As touching Diuination by Lots,
                        Examination of diuination by Lots.
heerein also wee had need to bee informed,
the rather because this Delusion
is common and preuailing with
the ignorant sort, to abuse the same
to wicked ends, and so therein to
offer sacrifice to the deuill: And
therefore,
                     Though there may bee some lawfull
vse heereof,Ciuill Lots lawfull. as in Ciuill Occasions,
to
                     
                        Diuide Lands, discide controuersies
in a case of importance and necssity,
Iosh. 14. 2. Acts 1. 26. &c. so the Name
of God bee called vpon, and his prouidence
attended, and obeyed in the

successe thereof.Sporting Lots vnlawfull. Yet neither are
wee allowed to vse Lots in iest, in
triuiall and vnnecessarie meanes, as
to set vp Banqrouts, to further Plantations,
&c. by raysing summes of
money thereby, seeing this may bee
obtained by other meanes; Much
lesse in Gaming, to sport our selues
hereby.
                     Especially wee are heere to beware
of such Lottery as tends to resolue
doubtfull things,
                        Diuining Lots vnlawfull. or fore-know
things to come, either by opening a
Booke, casting a Die, to declare good
or bad successe; seeing this both implies
a secret beleefe, that such a feat
can do it, and so is a worshipping of
the deuill, &c. seeing by no secret
propertie to that meanes such things
are effected, it must needes follow
that it is but Satans colour, to
hide his familiarity with the wicked.
                     Hitherto of Diuination by true creatures.
And doth not Satan also deceiue
by forged meanes?
                     
                     Yea certainely, as first by answering

in the shape of a dead man.
                        Of Satans deceit by answering in the shape of a dead man 1. Sam. 28. Example
hereof wee haue in that answere
vnto Saul, where Satan deludes the
King with the appearance of Samuels
person, when indeed it was onely the
cunning of Satan, resembling and
counterfeiting the same: As is manifest;
First
                     Because the Lord had denyed to answere
Saul by ordinarie lawfull meanes,
                        That the apparition vnto Saul was Diabolicall, & not reall Samuel.
                        
and therefore would not endure to
haue Samuel raysed vp to answere
him extraordinarily: Luke 16.
                     2 The Bodies and soules of the Saints
departed are in the hands of God
resting from their labours,
                        Reu. 14. 12. and therefore
Satan could not haue power to
fetch the soule from heauen, though
he might preuaile to raise the bodie
frō the earth, which yet I see no reason
for, seeing the body also must rest;
at least frō 
                        Satans power? And would
Samuel, think you, suffer Saul to adore
him? Surely it is the deuill that seekes
honour and homage from men, as
for the Saints, they striue to giue all
power and honor vnto God, Act. 10.

Reu. 22. 8. 9. Adde heerevnto that
true Samuel would haue reproued
Saul for running to Witches, hee
would haue exhorted him to repentance.
                     1 And therefore,Answ. to obiections though the
Word call him Samuel, yet this was
according to that, which seemed to
delude Saul.
                     
                     2 And though Saul might bee
told by the Appearance what should
befall him, yet might this bee
done by Satan, as being either acquainted
by the Lord with his purpose
heerein, or coniecturing by
Sauls case what was like to come
to him for his disobedience to
God.
                     As for that which the Church of
Rome doates concerning the walking
of dead men,
                        Confutation of walking spirits. howsoeuer the Lord
gaue power vnto his Prophets to raise
the dead, yet neither had this Witch
any such power, neither was the
case necessarie why it should be at this
time, neither needed Satan to vse
this meanes, seeing he might doe

the feat, as well by himselfe counterfeting
the shape and person of Samuel:
Neither may extraordinarie
and miraculous working, vpon speciall
occasion, bee traduced to warrant
the ordinarie walking of persons
after their deaths, whose soules,
the Holy Ghost witnesseth to bee at
rest, and can their bodies walke without
their soules?
                     Indeed when the Lord was either
to plant or restore a Church out of it
ruine and desolation,
                        Note whē Miracles vsed. wee finde in the
Word this power of raysing from
the dead to haue bene exercised profitably;
and therefore seeing now
there was no such cause for this miraculous
worke, it followeth to bee
the delusion of Satan, and not the
finger of God.
                     But here me thinkes I heere some
reply that if this were but a collusion
of Satan blinding and deceiuing
Saul,
                        Obiect. why might he not also
deeceiue the Witch, as pretending to
bee raysed vp by her, that she
had power of him, when it might

bee but some iugling trick to bleare
her eyes; she raised vp no deuill in
Samuels likenesse, but rather was
meerely deluded with a conceit
heereof.
                     Surely,Answ. howsoeuer the Patrones
of Witch-craft would gladly thus
cōclude to condemne the truth of the
Word, that there are Witches, which
worke by Familiar spirits; yet doth
the circumstance of the Historie plainely
confound them: Howsoeuer they
also imply further, that the Witch
might suborne some man or woman
in the likenesse of Samuel to giue
this answere: seeing no meere humane
vnderstanding could attaine to
that knowledge, And therefore it necessarily
followeth, that the Witch,
by vertue of the couenant with Satan,
raised him vp; He by his power and
skill counterfeited Samuel at an ynch,
by his experience and office was
able to acquaint him with Gods wil,
and so as an instrument of Diuine
vengeance to hasten him to his destruction.
                     
                        
And as Satan thus foretells things
by meanes,Of Satans fore telling without means By possession. eyther true or counterfeit:
so doth hee also Diuine without
meanes, either possessing those that are
his oracles, Acts the sixteene chapter
and sixteene verse: or inspiring
them by outward obsession with his
will and councells,Obsession whereby they
become counterfeit prophets, and reuealers
of things to come; such as
were the Sybills, &c.
                     
                     Of all which wee are to make this
vse:Vses hereof. 1 As to iudge wisely of the
power and manifold cunning of Sathan,
2 So to consider of the preciousnesse
of the soule, for which Satan
takes such paines, becomes such a
drudge, &c. and to preuent the Diuell
by our care and diligence, not
so much for the bodie and the meate
that perisheth, but for the poore
soule, that it may be saued euerlastingly.
                     3 Lastly, seeing Sathan by these
Inspirations and Exorcismes deceiueth
the simple and vnstable soules,
causing them to beleeue that such

trances and inspirations are from
God;Differēce betweene diabolicall Trances & the gift of Prophecie. therefore learne we to distinguish
betweene Diabolicall Reuelations,
and the true gift of Prophecie, which
God in Trances reuealeth vnto his
seruants.
                     As first, Diuine Trances may bee
where the soule for a time is seuered
from the bodie, 2. Cor. 12. 2. But in these
Diabolicall though the senses may
bee bound, or benummed for a
time, yet the soule is neuer seuered
from the body, because this is a
worke miraculous to take the soule
out of the body, and revnite it again.
                     2 In Diuine Trances the poures
and faculties of soule and bodie
though their operations cease
for a time, yet remaine sound and
perfect; but in Satanicall Extasies, the
parties being cast into phrensies and
madnesse, the very faculties of nature
are empaired, and and so distempercd
as that they seldome recouer
the right vse againe: At the best,
they cary some skarre of Satan to
their graues; whereas the Saints

receiue a further measure of Illumination,
and encrease of grace in all
their powers and faculties:
                     3 Diuine trances do alwayes tend
to the good of the Church, confirmation
of the Gospel, and aduauncement of
Pietie, Acts 10. 11. those of Sathan
to the contrary.
                     And thus farre of Witch-craft by
Diuination.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. IX.
                     
                        Of Witch-craft consisting in Operation.
                     
                     
                        COnsider we now of Witch-craft
in operation: which really worketh
strange things.
                     This is done,Of enchātment, and it vnlawfulnesse, I proued by the effects. first, by Enchantment;
namely, when by some Charme
wonderous workes are wrought.
                     Which is not onely expresly forbidden,
Deuter. chapter 18. verse 11.

but is also manifest by the things
wrought hereby. As,

                           1 Raising of Stormts.
                           2 Poysoning of the aire.
                           3 Blasting of Corne.
                           4 Killing of Cattell.
                           5 Breeding strange torments in the
bodies of men.
                           6 Casting out of Diuells, &c.
                        
                     
                     All which, and such like, workes
belōging to the diuine power, & iustice,
If therefore they shall be imitated, or
in any measure effected, by the creature;
It is a plaine vsurpation of the diuine
office, and a flat peruersion & disgracing
of the diuine Prouidēce, as being
accomplished by indirect meanes.
                     
                     Now,Note. that these, and such, are the effects
of Witch-craft,
                     It is not onely apparant by the
Confession of Witches themselues: but
further cleared by the testimonie of the
word;
                        2 By the word. who ascribeth this power vnto
the Charmer, Eccles. 10. 11. where the
Originall yeelds thus: If the Serpent
bite before he be charmed, what profite
hath the maister of the tongue thereby,
                        
that is the Charmer? signifying therein,
that if the Charmer come in time,
he might preuent by his charme, the
Serpents stinging.
                     And what else (I pray you) doth
Balaams words implie, when being
crossed by the power and mercie of
God, hee is forced to confesse, that
ther is no sercery against Iacob, nor sooth
saying against Israel: Doeth hee not
therein acknowledge,Nu. 23. 13. That whereas
hee was hired by King Balaac by
some charme to hurt Gods People,
(as being by Trade no better then a
Coniurer, though in the reputation
of the ignorant and superstitious people
hee was esteemed a Prophet) his
Charmes could not preuaile, the Lord
disappointed him.
                     And surely,3 By the nature of a Charme. if wee should consider
the nature of a Charme, it will
euidently appeare, that it is but a
colourable and counterfeit meanes,
vnder which Sathan shrowdeth his
power and malice to diuine withall,
and so to destroy both bodie and
soule.
                     
                        
Seeing a Charme is no other then
a spell consisting of strange words,
                        A charme, what. wherin
is pretended some secret efficacie, to bring
forth some extraordinarie worke. It necessarily
followeth, 1 that by the very
nature of the words, and 2 qualitie of
the parties that vse them, they are nobetter
then Sathans cloaks to conuey
his mischiefes more closely, for the
endangering of the soule.
                     The words are either barbarous &
vnknowne,Words of charmes, either obscure & barbarous as were such, which in
times of Ignorance and Infidelitie
were vsed. And that these could
work no such effect, it appeareth:
                     1 because this was no ordinance of
God to this end, as hauing neither any
power thereto by right of creation,
or by any new institution, and gift from
God: That they haue no power by vertue
of creation, it is manifest, 1 because
words are but sounds, and so passe into
the aire, without any further effect.
                     2 If they had power to hurt, or do
good, it must needes be by some contiguitie
and presence with the thing it
works vpon; & therfore seeing these

words are spoken concerning parties
and things assent, and farre distant,
and therefore they haue no power,
as is pretended.
                     And if some words should be effectuall
of themselues: why then not
all words of all sorts, tending to blessing
or cursing: but this is presumed,
that onely words proceeding from such
cunning men and women, are auaileable;
and therfore it is not the words
themselues, but some other secret
Magicall compact with such persons
that effect the same.
                     If it be replyed,Obiect. that these wordes
haue signification,
                        Answ. and happily be vnderstood
of the parties that vse them
reciprocally:Or blasphemous knowne charmes. Yet seeing they haue
in themselues no further vse then for
what they signifie, and though they
be vnderstoode, as the charmes are
now, as being of knowne names, and
yet still can they not of themselues
further auayle, then to the Ends
they were appoynted. And therefore
it followeth, that they are no
better then Signes and Watch-wordes

to Satan to worke his wonders by.
                     For though the name of the Trinitie
and Sacrament, serue to that end
they were appoynted, namely, to norish
the soule: yet to effect wonders
by these, seeing it is contrary to their
Institution, &c. that blessing of God
especially accompanying them, it foloweth,
that when they are abused
to other ends, as in charmes. &c. they
are the diuells sacraments, to effect his
trickes, by vertue of the compact betweene
the witch and him: whereby
he seemes to be bound and compelled
to serue hir turn, the rather hereby
to colour the wickednesse, as if
now it were done by the power of
God, resembled in these words, and
not by the illusion & cunning of Satan.
                     As for the power of Imagination in
this case,Imagination reiected. which is pretēded to be the
occasiō of those strange effects; surely,
though it cannot be denyed, but
that our imaginatiō may hurt our selues:
yet that the imagination of the Witch
should hurt others, or that these
words poceeding from her conceit,

should so preuaile on the bodies and
minds of such as are afarre off, it is
contrary to reason, & common sense.
                     And therefore,Infectious lookes disclaimed. though it be conceited,
that the Witch by her lookes may
effect these things: or hauing some poysonous
qualitie in them, to infect the
ayre; so the bodies of men, though
this be a meere dotage, fitter for such
bedlams, then to be corrected by any
sound Iudgement: yet, how can
this hurt those which are absent?
                     Neither wil it further this dotage,Obiection of Iacobs sheepe answered.
that either Iacobs sheep, by looking vpon
the roddes speckled and partie-coloured,
brought forth the like: seeing this was
an especiall worke of God, to blesse Iacob,
not any inherent vertue in the rods,
or the eies of the sheep, bicause heere
was som likelihood in nature hereto.
                     Much lesse shal that preuaile,2 Obiection of the Basiliske and Wolfe answered. that
the Basiliske kills with her sight; and the
woolfe taketh away the voice of such as
he sodainely meeteth withall, seeing,
as there is no ground of experience
concerning these things, but
onelie a common receiued errour:

so; if any such thing be, it may proceede
from some force in Nature incident
to those creatures, as the Basiliske
being a poysonous substance, may
infect the ayre, and so take away
life, or else from some sodaine astonishment
in such as vnexpectedly
meete with them, causing strange alteration
in the minde by feare and so
effecting such stange things.
                     But they alledge further,Obiect. 3. Answ. if Enchanters
can stay by their Charmes
the stinging of Serpents, then certainely
there is some force in these
words.
                     Vnto which we answer, That the
power proceedeth not from any vertue
in the wordes, but by the presence
of Satan through compact with the
Charmer, as the word is plaine, ioyned
sometimes very cunningly with
the diuell, seeing no other, although
he vse the same words, can effect the
like things.
                     If it be said,Obiect. 4. Of the parties. this is, bicause he hath
not the same faith: this discouers the
roote of bitternesse, and argueth them

plainely to be Diabolicall: as being
both the bond of the Couenant, wherby
Satan is tied to the Witch: he doth
all on this condition, that hee is acknowledged
as her god, shee must
trust in him, resigne vp her selfe wholy
to his pleasure.
                     As also by this bond, the Witch
tieth her Proselites to her dispose: shee
can doe nothing for them, vnlesse
they beleeue in her, and so she enthralleth
their soules, while she pretends
good to their bodies.
                     This will yet appeare more euident,
if we consider the qualitie of the
best and most colourable charmes, that
are vsed to this end: Namely, wordes
of holy Scripture:
                        Of Scripture char. which seeing they
haue their vertue not from him that
vttereth them, much lesse from the
power of the words in themselues, but
from the alone efficacie of the Spirite of
God, annexed by GODS promise
heereunto, when the word is vsed as
his ordinance: seeing therefore this
is no ordinance of God to such ends, &
therefore can not proceede from the

operation of the good spirit of God:
it followes necessarily, that it is the
power of satan, shrouded vnder these
formes of speech, especially, seeing it
is not vsed to the conuersion of sinners,
which is the right end; but to wicked
or vnnecessarie purposes, as raysing
of diuells, killing of creatures, infecting
of the aire, &c.
                     
                     And seeing the word is onely effectuall,Word how effectual.
not by reason of the sound, er
letter thereof, but when it is 1 conceiued
in the minde,
                        Hebr. 4. 2 2 receiued with
reuerence, 3 treasured in the memorie,
4 and mingled with faith in
the heart: seeing it is muttered in
these charmes; 1 without vnderstanding,
as being in an vnknowne tongue,
2 without faith, and 3 to wicked purposes.
                     
                     It must needes be some Satanicall
colour to conceale desperat wickednes.
And so,Note. though it be not abused
of all so far forth, that it may include
them within the compasse of such
charmes, which haue entred into
this certayne league with Sathan:

yet seeing for want of conscionable
vnderstanding,Word comonly made a charme. and obedience thereunto,
it is made no better then a charme
to the common sort: therefore, as herein
they bewray themselues in generall
to be yet held vnder Satans bondage,
so are they heereby both subiect
the rather to the power of witch
craft, not onelie to be obnoxious to
the hurts thereof, in their bodies &
goods, &c. but especially to be ensnared
with the miserie thereof, vpon anie
occasion to become nouices & factors
in this diuellish trade: it being iust with
the glorious Lord, to giue vp such
as will not obey the truth, to the efficacie
and depth of these strong delusions,
not only to be deceiued thē
                        selues,
but to become Sathans chiefe
Schoolmaisters to deceiue others.
                     The like may be concluded of such
other means whereby Witches vse to
performe their Charmes.
                     
                     As making of Characters,Characters, Images, &c. cō
                              demned. Rome. Images,
and Signes in Wax, or Clay, & framing
of Circles, vsing of Amulets, Exorcismes;
an ordinarie Practize of

the Apostata Church, coniuring
thereby their Creame, Salt, Spittle, holy
Water, Oyle, Palmes, &c. vsing of
the Name of Iesus with such often repetitions
and Crosses annexed. All
which, & such like, being no secret operation
of Nature, nor ordinance of God
to such ends: What other can they
be, but the Visors of Satan, whereby
hee maskes it more securely, and
dangerously in his Magicall practises,
as heereby bearing the simple
people in hand, that Christ is a Coniurer,
that he is bound by those from
doing hurt, to do good &c. And shall
we thinke that crossing of the body, is of
any other stamp: surely it is of all other
a most dangerous charme, by how
much it caries a shew of loue and deuotion.
                     So may wee iudge of scratching of
the Witch,
                        Scratching vnto which if the Diuell
seeme to stoope, that the bodie is eased,
it is to seize more deeply on the
soule, by withdrawing it from the
right meanes, and resting it securely
in these diuelish charmes.
                     
                        
Which, as it may seeme to admonish
vs frō the vse of them,Vse, to decline these meanes. so it may
prouoke such to repentance, hauing
done these of ignorance, not contenting
themselues with this excuse,
that they meant no hurt, they conceiued
the persons to bee honest of
whom they sought helpe, &c. Seeing
because they had no certaine warrant,
therefore good meaning without
faith, is sinne before God, Rom. 14.
nay while they meane well, they trust
in these things, and so doe robbe God
of his glorie, and themselues, asmuch
as lyeth in them, of their saluation.
                     Neither is there the like reason
betweene Physicke and these meanes:Obiect.
That is ordained of God,Answ. 
                        This,
                        That we relie vpon Paysicke: therefore why not on these charmes? condemned
of him; and therefore
though we are ignorant of the Physitions
Receipt, yet we are to relye vpon
his skill, and commend the successe
to God: whereas wee may not
vse these charmes being ignorant of
of the vertue of them, seeing there
can no blessing follow where God
leads not; where confidence is put

in the meanes to thrust out God.
                     As for the Case of necessitie which
is heere pretended; wee can haue
helpe no where else; The Physitian
will not meddle, the Paine is intolerable,
the case desperate, and God is
mercifull though we do amisse, yet
may wee not seeke ease; surely, The
Lord will not bee mercifull to presumptuous
sinners, If hee purpose to try thy
faith and patience in the enduring of
the extremitie; if hee entend heereby
to fit thee for himselfe, and to
ease thee of thy sinnes, and this miserable
world, Is it not good wayting
his leasure to prepare thy selfe
vnto him? Insteed of going to the
Wise-man, is it not now time to
make vp thy accounts, to make thy
peace with him? Certainely, when all
lawfull meanes faile, what doth this
argue but that either this is a signe
of the end of thy daies;Note. or that the
Lord will helpe thee by his immediate
hand? And therefore either way thou
must now cast thy selfe vpon him.
If the Lord cannot helpe thee,

much lesse shall the deuill: and
the Lord will helpe thee, as shall
bee best for his glorie, and thy good:
and therefore in all thy waies acknowledge
him, Prouerb 3. And though
hee should kill thee, yet trust thou in
him, Iob. 13. 15. Hee shall bee vnto
thee both in life and death aduantage:
Phil. 1.
                     Hitherto of that part of operatiue
Witch-craft which is performed by
charmes. Besides this there is another
worke of Sorcerie,
                        Of sorcerie by lugling, it properties. vsually practised
by Satans instruments, which is commonly
called Iugling; When strange
Feats are performed, not by reall charmes,
but onely by deluding of the eye, and
some extraordinarie sleight: Not that
any such thing is effected in Truth,
but onely in Appearance, to the deceiued
iudgement, being peruerted
by such delusions as the eye falsely
apprehends.
                     Now the Eye may be deluded.
                        Eye how deluded.
                     
                     First, by corrupting the humour of
the eye, being the next instrument of
sight.
                     
                        
2 By Altring the Aire whereby
the obiect is conueyed to the eye.
                     3 By changing the obiect which is
discerned.
                     That there may be such delusion,
not onely the Holy Ghost witnesseth
of the Galatians and others,Gal. 3. 12 who
were then bewitched, and made beleeue
that they saw that, which indeed
they saw not; but experience
doth daily make it manifest.
                     Concerning the sleight done aboue
the course of Nature:That Iuggling is sorcery. As this maketh
this Trade to be plaine Sorcery;
because it exceeds Natures compas,
so it necessarily followeth that some
skill of Satan is concurring heerein,
As being by compact with the Iugler
to colour and further him herein;
either by corrupting the humour of
the eye, or colouring the aire, &c.
which are things possible for Satan
to do.That iuggling is not by opticke skill. For howsoeuer some strange
things may bee done by bodily sleights
and by Opticke Arts, yet these are
kept within the compasse of nature:
But the Iuggler vndertakes things

impossible and contrarie to Nature,
as to transforme one creature into an other,
or else, to create and offer things
that are not, and so seemeth to arrogate
diuine power, in such workes of
Creation, and therefore must needes
delude onlie the eye with the appearance
of such things, seeing he cannot
possibly do the things indeed.
                     Such were the wonders wrought
by the Egyptian Enchanters, in imitation
of Moses,
                        Egyptian Enchanters onely deluded the eye. when they turned the
Rodde into a Serpent, and waters into
bloud: which, that it was a plaine
delusion of the eye, by Sathans forgerie,
is manifest, because they could
not be any reall creatures: seeing the
Lord did not make them, and the diuell
could not, the workes of ordinarie
Creation ceasing, and no speciall
reason now to be giuen, whie
myraculously anie such Creation
should be renued by those seruants
of Pharaoh: but rather plaine reason
for the contrarie, seeing this they
did, tended to the disgrace of Gods
worke, by his seruants Moses and

                        Aaron, and therefore though they
could haue done such a worke, yet
the Lord at this time would not haue
endured it at their hands.
                     But it is most apparant that Satan
can doe no such thing, seeing the
effecting of the like belongs onely
to God, Ioh. 2. And the Word is
plaine, that this their fained miracle
was done by Sorcery, Exod. 7. 11. 22.
& 8. 7. And therefore that the
Lord should do them against himselfe,
it is altogether absurd and
blasphemous to grant: And the circumstances
doe plainely euince that
they were not naturall frogs, by such
differences as are manifest betweeue
them, and those that Moses created
by the finger of God.
                     As 1. That the Frogges created by
Moses caused great stincke by the
corruption that they bred, being gathered
on heapes, whereas there is
no such ascribed to the Frogges of the
Enchanters.
                     
                     And▪ so the bloud which Moses
brought forth, killed the fish, and stancke
                        
so that the Egiptians could not drink
thereof; no such effect appearing
from the Magitians Transmutation.
                     
                     And is it likely that they which
could haue created these frogges,
could not also haue destroyed the
lice? Could not haue preserued themselues
from those fearefull plagues?
Exod. 8. 18. Nay they confesse that
they were not able to bring forth
lice by their enchantment, much
lesse destroy them.
                     And seeing that Moses serpents deuoured
them, and yet retained their
former quality, it necessarily followeth
that they were no true serpents,
the rather because vsually one creature
doth not deuoure another of the
same kind.
                     
                     And surely why could they not
as well haue remoued such as Moses
made, as well as they had power to
make the same?
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. X.
                     
                        Of the Subiect of Witch-craft.
                     
                     NOw let vs come to the maine
Subiect and Occasion of this
Treatise:
                     Namely, to consider of the Practiser
of this Mystery, to wit, the witch,
whether man or woman.
                     And heere, first consider wee the
Generall Notion or Description of a
Witch.
                     
                     Secondly, wee will resolue these
points, 1 Whether men as well as women,
may not bee Practitioners in this
Art:
                     
                     And yet, Why more women then men
are engaged therein.
                     
                     Thirdly, we will lay downe the
diuers kindes of these Witches: namely,
1 The Bad Witch, which is the Hurter.
                     2 The Good Witch, as they are
termed, because they doe seeme to
helpe.
                     
                        
                        Where it shall bee resolued.
                        1 Why Satan vseth these seuerall
instruments for these contrarie
ends.
                        2 Whether the good Witch cannot
hurt, or the bad Witch helpe.
                        3 What places are especially infested
with Witches.
                     
                     
                        SECTIO. I.
                        AS touching the Generall Description
of a Witch
                        
                        It may be thus.
                        
                           A Witch is a Magitian, who, either
by open or secret league, wittingly and
willingly, consenteth to vse the aide of the
deuill in working of Wonders.
                        A Magitian, I say, to signifie that
that she professeth and practiseth
this Art, Actes 8. 9. For that is the
generall name to all such as practise
these vnlawfull Arts.
                        2 I adde, that consents to vse the
helpe of the deuill, either by or

secret league wittingly and willingly,
which is the very proper passion, or
certaine meanes to make her a
Witch.
                        Excluding heerein,
                        First,Heere are excluded, 1 Lunatickes. such as be tainted with phrensie
or weakenesse of braine, and so
are thereby deluded by the Deuill:
                        Because howsoeuer Satan may
worke vpon and by these, yet they
neuer giue Reall and Willing consent
vnto him.
                        
                        2 Such as are Demoniackes,2 Demoniackes. Two sorts of them. Actes 16. possessed
by him, whereof though
some are properly Witches, as consenting
to him, and so he possessing
them out of them speaketh, by
them working strange things: yet
others though they bee possessed,
yet they consent not thereto, they
in their spirits striue against him:
and so Satan doth in them, and
by them, strange things; as speaking
strange Languages, doing
things of extraordinarie strength, &c.
which by the mercie of GOD

though they afflict the bodie, yet
they may tend to the saluation of the
soule.
                        3 By this circumstance are excluded
those That of blind zeale,
                           3 Superstitious persons. and
Ignorant superstition vse such charmes
to bring things to passe, either
thinking they haue vertue in them
thereto, or else not knowing the
deepenesse of Satan heerein: who
though they defie the deuill,
                           Note. as they
say, and indeed are not yet
brought to this league, yet doe
they sinne grieuously heerein, and
vnlesse they repent, may iustly prouoke
the Lord to giue them vp to
this or the like, desperate and reprobate
sense.
                        A third thing in this description,
is the End of this Trade, namely, To
worke Wonders.
                        
                        It being the Pride of Satan to aduance
himselfe heereby as God, in
the children of disobedience, and
by these manifold trickes and
glorious shewes, to detaine the
miserable people in vile Ignorance
                           
and Idolatrie, and to hinder them
from embracing the glorious Gospell of
Iesus Christ; practising to this
end, by his instruments, sometimes
true, as by Diuinations and Charmes,
and otherwise fayned workes, as
by Iugling, to puffe them vp also
with a vaine conceipt of Diuine
Power, thereby to secure them
of their imaginarie happinesse,
and so to draw them more securely
to eternall vengeance, by enabling
them heereby to execute their
seuerall lusts with greedinesse, and
vsing them as dangerous instruments
to deceiue others.
                        Such were Balaam, the Inchanters
of Egypt, the Witch of Endor Simon
Magus, Bariesus, Elimas the Sorcerer,
the Pythonysse at Phillipi, &c.
Actes the sixteenth, Numb▪
                            the twenty
two, Actes the eighth.
                        By which description and examples,
the first Question is resolued,
namely, that men, as well as women,
may be subiect to this Trade; seeing as
both are subiect to the State of damnation,

so both are liable to Satans
snares, who hath seuerall trickes and
colours, in this Mysterie of iniquitie,
to bait each according to their seuerall
abilities and vses in the world,
thereby the rather to fetch them ouer
to this detestable Art.
                        For whereas man by Ordination is
fitter to command,
                           How Satan baitesmen and women diuersly to this Trade. and the woman to
obey, therefore hath the God of this
world, for ambitious and aspiring men
so sutable a point in this Trade,
as to lead him thereto, with pretence
of Soueraignety,
                           Note. that he shall
command the deuill, in a more secure
and solemne manner, colouring the
same by those manifold delusions,
of Circles, Characters, &c. to this
end, as are vsually practised in that
high skill of coniuration. By the
which ceremonies and solemnities
as Satan procureth in the minde of
ambitious and curious man some
higher conceipt of this soueraigne
skill; so doth he thereby more
deepely cozen him, as fetching
him of more roundly heereby to the

entended bargaine, euen to subiect
his soule in hope of this
power.
                        To this end we may obserue, that
though the maine end bee one, in these
Diabolicall Arts, euen to enthrall the
soule in perpetuall bondage, yet hath
Satan diuers meanes to attaine these
ends, both answerable to the seuerall
conditions of the world, and particular
estates and qualities of men: According
to which diuersitie, this Art,
though it bee one in effect, yet hath
it obtained diuers names, and sundry
respects.
                        
                        Concerning the Times, as they
haue obtained more or lesse light of
the knowledge of God, so hath
Satan fitted himselfe in his policies
accordingly. When, and where,
there hath beene none,
                           Note Satans Policie in suiting variety of times with seuerall baites. or lesse reuelation
of the Gospell, there hath Satans
appearances and workings
beene more carnall and preceptible
to common sense, his suggestions
and deuices more grosse and palpable,
his attempts more open and naturall,

his worship more terrible to the
flesh; as appearing ordinarily in
vgly shapes, being worshipped in most
horrible formes, presented with most
cruell and bloudie sacrifices, and honored
with all grosse and shamelesse open
filthinesse. So did the Heathen, in their
first rude and barbarous estate, worship
the deuill; then needed they no
couenant to bind them from God to Satan,
when they acknowledged no
other God but him: him they serued
that he might doe them good; him
they worshipped for feare, least he
should hurt them.
                        As Barbarousnesse decayed, and Ciuilitie,
by setled Gouernement, beganne
to take place, &c. so knowledge and skill
was aduanced among men, whereby
grosse wickednesse was somewhat
brideled, and morall honestie,
for the common and priuate good
sake, was now outwardly embraced;
Herevpon Satan spinnes a finer thrid
of more colourable idolatrie, and
that by these meanes. Benefactors of
Common-wealthes, and Deliuerers of

their Countries from Tyrants, not
knowing God, were apt to robbe him of
his glory, seeking their owne glorie
and eternizing, by their Renowmed
Actes.
                        
                        This Satan discerning, doth easilie
insinuate into them, and procuring
some secret assent from them, by
his skill and power enables them
to doe Wonders; Heerevpon the people
cry, The Voyce of God and not of
man, Act. 12. And this falleth out
the rather, because the ignorant
and godlesse people, receiuing
good from them, cannot bee
contained in any sober measure of
respect towards them, but thinke
euen all Diuine Honour too little
for them. So wee finde that Heathen
Princes were many of them great
Magitians and Coniurers, as gaining
hereby an Opinion of Dietie: And
so did the people worship them with
Diuine Honour, yea ascribed them,
being translated among the number
of the Gods.
                        
                        Thus became this Art of Sorcerie
                           
a Companion of great Princes and mightie
Conquerours: by this they attained
many great enterprises in the world,
and gained an opinion of Omnipotencie
and Eternitie.
                        And was there not another means
heerein to set vp this Art, in that age
of Knowledge, and greater Ciuility?
Yea certainly.
                        As conquest brought forth Peace,
so Peace yeelded libertie for knowledge
and liberall studies: And Knowledge
brought forth Pride to bee excellent
therein, and Pride begetteth curiositie
to search into hidden mysteries,
and curiositie breedeth discontent, and
restlesse disquiet: heereupon Sathan
worketh: ministreth content to the
minde by yeelding it that which Art
could not reach vnto; so curiositie is
satisfied, and pride nourished, and
the soule through Pride enthralled
to Sathan, and yet deluded iustly
with the same colour of Art: vnder
which Sathan hiding his secret compacts
doeth eyther perswade
them, that it is done by art, which is

done indeede by his assistance, or satisfies
them, that it is done by some
Power ouer Satan, and therefore they
neede not feare subiection to Satan.
Hitherto serued those Charmes, Circles,
Characters, &c. by which Satan
seeming to be bound, deluded them
with a vaine conceit of his subiection
to them, And so as men were either
more ambitious after honour, or
curious after knowledge, so did Sathan
bait his diuellish Art with more
abundance of pompous and curious ceremonies,
the rather to fetch ouer these
glorious fooles thereto: and so he easily
preuailed ouer the profoundest scholers;
the Gymnosophists of Egypt, Magi
of Chaldea, Sages of Greece &c. most
whereof gained their chiefest credite
by this, that they were most skilfull
in this diuellish Trade.
                        And so, because men were fittest
for these ends, either to conquer Kingdomes,
or seeke after knowledge, so in
these respects vsually the Male sex
haue beene trained to this Art. By
this they haue attained the reputation

of Wisedome and Impery.
                        Succeeding Ages gaue occasion to
Satan to work more closely, & yet to
weaue his Idolatry with a finer threed.
                        For, together with the knowledge
of humane Arts, and Sciences which
resembled some sparks of diuine light,
brake out also at length the day Star
of Righteousnesse Iesus Christ, bringing
with him sauing knowledge, and dispelling
the more grosser mystes of Heathenish
Idolatrie;
                           Oracles ceased. as being no way sit
to encounter therewith: or at least
in Policie, not thinking it meete openly
to oppose the same; but rather by a
more secret and colourable meanes,
by closing therewith, to obscure, and
so by degrees to banish the same.
                        
                        Thus became Sathan transformed
into an Angell of Light;
                           2. Cor. 11. and taking
aduantage of the pride of Nature,
and vnthankefulnesse of men, that
would not obey the Gospel, but rather
peruert it, to iustifie the flesh: As
they were therefore giuen vp iustly
by the Lord to strong delusions: so
is Sathan still ready at a pinch to beguile

                           vnstable soules, and insteade of
the puritie and simplicitie of the Gospell,
to draw them by degrees into
a Mysterie of Iniquitie, and so in the
end, to most grosse and palpable Idolatrie,
iustifying and exceeding
the most barbarous Heathens therein.
                        To this end, euen so soone as the
good Housholder had sowen his Seede,
the enuious man was readie to sowe
his Tares,
                           Galat. 3. raysing vp false apostles to
withdraw the people from the Simplicitie
of the Gospell,
                           2. Cor. 10. 11. and so to prepare
them, by giuing libertie to the
flesh,Galat. 5. to that corruption of doctrine,
which afterwards ouer-spread the
face of the Churches.
                        And at the first assault Sathan so
preuayled, as that howsoeuer, as yet
the light of Iudgement remayned with
the Church, as being able to discerne
of Spirites, euen to discouer such as
said they were Apostles, & yet in truth,
were no better then Sathans Ministers:
yet, by reason that the flesh was willing
to cast off the yoake, and apt to

turne the graces of God into wantonnesse:
heereupon zeale beganne
to decay,Reul. 2. 23. euen with the best, first
loue was left; the bond of Perfection, and
so way hereby made to carnall liberty,
and for the maintenance thereof.
                        
                           Corrupt doctrine by degrees was
hatched,1. Cor. 15. and embraced: whereof as
the Purest times were not altogether
free,1. Tim. 4. 2 as may appeare by the Nicolaitans
and others, that went out euen
from amongst the Apostles, both to
grosse prophanenesse, and also to Doctrines
of diuels,
                           1. Tim. 4. for the iustifying therof:
So appeared heereupon the great
mercie of God in casting this Iezabel
into a bed of affliction,Reuel. 2. and encreasing
his Church graciously with
those ten bloudie and desperate persecutions,
for the purging out of her
drosse, and renuing of her first loue:
Whereby, as she wanne vnto her the
hearts of her enemies; so by this means
she gained great friends: euen the kings
of the earth beganne to worship the Lord:
and the mightiest became nursing Fathers
and foster Mothers, Esay chapter

49. chapter, to the distressed Church
of God.
                        And now behold, the great haruest
of the Gentiles being wel-neare in, &
so the man-childe beeing borne vnto
God;Reu. 12. 13 the time was come, for the further
reuelation of Gods iustice, for the
former affliction of his Church. And
also to manifest yet further his great
mercies vnto his Church, in exercising
the same with new afflictions, for
the preuenting of that securitie, and
purging out the carnallnesse, which
by the fauour and arme of flesh had
growne in the Church.
                        For euen thus it befell with the
deare Spouse of CHRIST, that as
her former afflictions, had now fitted
her to some rest, which shee attayned
by the meanes of Constantine:
so this rest and ease, accompanied
with outward honour and acceptance
with the greatest: instead of Godlie
simplicitie brought in carnall pompe and
wisedome of the flesh.
                        
                        And the wisedome of the flesh, being
once aduaunced, and grounded

in the hearts of men, banished presently
all godlie seueritie of life and
zeale for the honour of Almightie
God; And instead thereof brought
in wil-worship, and prophanenesse. And
did not carnall wisedome strike the
chiefe stroake heerein? Yea surely,
the Church being now taken into the
Court of the Emperour, and warming
her selfe well by his fire: as she forgets
her former affliction; so is she not
vnwilling to remit also of her sinceritie,
as not being so sutable to the place
and persons, that now shee hath to
deale withall: now shee must a little
become all vnto all, that so shee may
eyther winne others, or holde her
owne; somewhat must be yeelded
to her Patrons, to shew her thankefulnesse:
and some Corruption must
be swallowed vp, to maintayne credite.
                        
                        Now chistian liberty must be strained
to be an occasion to the flesh, and
Authority must be deified to maintaine
the same.
                        Thus the poore Church of Christ
                           
being freed from the malice of heathenish
Idolatrie, is corrupted by prosperitie,
to set vp spirituall Idolatrie: Not onlie
aduauncing her Patrons and Benefactours
aboue what was meete, but
aduauncing also her selfe by their
helpe, aboue all that was called
God, and so by degrees hauing well
feathered her neast, and strengthned
her selfe by the arme of flesh, ouerthroweth
cunningly the same, euen
with it owne weapons, and aduanceth
it selfe gloriously vpon the ruines
and wrecke thereof.
                        And thus the Church flies into the
wildernesse vpon Eagles wings,
                           Reu. 12. 14 by
the fauour of earthly Princes, being
first highly aduaunced, and so thereby
growing to loosenes and profanenes;
and so iustly left to grosse errors: both
for the conceiuing, as also for the iustifying
thereof; whereby it cometh
to passe, that corrupters of doctrine in
the end preuailing, sincerity is banished,
and so Antichrist by degrees exalted
aboue all that is called God: not
onely in wil worship and bodily seruice,
                           Coloss. 2.
                           
tyrannizing ouer the consciences of
the faithlesse and rebellious generation:
but aduancing himselfe by lying
signes and wonders thereby,2. Thess. 2. to maintaine
the opinion of that arrogated
trueth, and so to subdue and hold in
captiuitie the deceiued world.
                        And so as profane pompe succeeded
godly simplicity, so barbarous ignorance
also came in place of pure and sauing
knowledge,
                           Reuel. 8. 7 that not onelie the third
part of the earth was killed therewith,
but euen the verie Sea of Doctrine
was so corrupted by that mountaine
of worldly pompe and glorie cast into
the same, that euen the third part
also of all things therein were vtterly
destroyed:Verse 8. yea Heauen it selfe euen
the church of God escaped not this
infection, but that the Taile of the
Dragon euen drew downe the Starres
from Heauen, Reuelation chapter 12.
verse 1. Yea the Dragon himselfe
set vp his very throne of darkenesse
in the Temple of the Lord.
                           2. Th. 2. 10 That his
darling the whore of Babylon might
bee aduaunced thereupon, aboue

all that is called God: and did not
Satan furnish his minion at all assaies,
that so shee might prosper and preuaile
ouer the children of vnbeliefe?
yea certainely, it was not enough
for that man of sinne, to strengthen
himselfe from the vsurped power of
Heauen, chalenging the keyes, to open
and shut at his pleasure; but he must
also wrest into himselfe all power on
earth, disposing of Kingdomes, and deposing
the mightiest at his pleasure.
                        And that hee might appeare to be
the true Antichrist,
                           Philip. 2. in all things opposing
the kingdome of Iesus Christ.
Behold, as all things vnder earth doe
bow vnto the Sonne of God, the
very diuells tremble,
                           Iames 2. and are subiect
vnto him: Euen so doth this Abaddon
assume the power of the Dragon:
and so by Coniuration and
Enchantments, attaineth to and confirmeth
his supreame authoritie.
                        And thus Witch-craft became an
especiall proppe of Antichrists kingdome.
                        And that in diuers respects, accordingly

as that man of sinne, by
diuerse meanes aduaunced and confirmed
himselfe. And these were,

                              1 Opinion of diuine power.
                              
                              2 Presumption of perfect Holinesse,
and so of merites.
                              
                              3 Maintenance of Idolatrie, and
                              4 Outward greatnes and soueraigntie.
                              
                           
                        
                        To the furthering of al which this
diuelish Art stood him in great steed.
                        As, For the first, As Antichrist,
intruded into the seate of the Lord,
both fitting in the Temple of the Lord,
and raigning in the consciences of men,
and so exalting himselfe in voluntary
worship aboue all that is called God:
So was hee much furthered heereunto,
by this Art of Negromancie:
                        
                        As both heereby through fayned
myracles and lying wonders.
                        
                        1 Gaining from the conceit of
the deceiued people, the Reputation
of diuine power.
                        
                        2 And by the power of Satan, confounding
his enemies, attaining to a cō
                           ceit
of supreme & immediate iustice, As,
                        
                           
3 Hereby relieuing extraordinarily
his fauourites; and so arrogating
the conceit of diuine mercie.
                        
                        And thus also by this Art gayned
he an opinion of perfit Holinesse:
                        
                        As, not onelie hereby being able
to bleare the eyes of the world, not
to discerne, or not to dare to discouer
his abhominable wickednesse.
                        But especially heere by being furthered
to performe many glorious outsides
of well-doing, that hee might be
applauded as the mighty power of God.
Acts 8. And so:
                        Withall, by this meanes, bewitching
the hearts of the ignorant, to admire
the beauty of the strumpet, and so to
fall downe and worship her. And,
                        By this Art, furthering also that
Deuice of canonizing of Saints for their
perfect Holinesse, by such forged
miracles as hereby were made shew
of to that end:
                        Which as it was an especiall
ground and foundation of that Idolatry,
                           Note the ground of Idolatrie.
which beginning of a reuer end estimation
and affection to holie men;

grew at the length, not onelie to a
worship of their persons, being dead,
but of their Statues and Images also:
which at the first, being onelie
erected in memoriall of their
well-doings by a thankefull world,
grew at length to be adored and exalted
also aboue all that was called
God: and that especially by meanes
of this diuellish Art.
                        
                        For by this meanes these Stockes
and Stones beeing made to speake
and doe wonderfull things, as it confounded
the Image-makers, who
by this practize condemned their Doctrine
of Images:
                           Note. Teaching that they
were but otdayned as meanes to remember
the people of those persons
whom they did represent,Bellarm. and yet
by this practize, making the people
beleeue, that they were the Saints
themselues: so were the ignorant
and heartlesse people hereby grossely
deceiued and detained in this idolatrie,Ose. 7.
euen by those lying wonders
and signes that were wrought at these
Images.
                        
                           
And thus as that man of sin, attained
to exceeding credit and riches in
the world: So that he might further
exalt himselfe aboue all that is called
God: behold, he aduanceth himselfe
aboue the great Kings and Potentates of
the earth: and is furthered heereto
especially by this Art of Coniuration.
                        For hereby being acquainted with
the secrets of all estates, gayned he oportunitie
to preuent, or confound their
determinations.
                        
                        By this meanes hee many times
casts bones among them, that tearing &
deuouring each other, they might
both in the end, become his prey.
                        By this, was hee able secretly to remoue
the greatest opposite, and yet by
the secret conueyance thereof to
keep the credit of his Holinesse: yea
to gaine the opinion of diuine power
and assistance.
                        By this meanes, whosoeuer banded
openly against him, was like to
take the foyle. And thus, heereby
nouzeling the world in ignorance

and infidelity, excluded them by this
meanes the protection of the Lord: and
so they became a prey vnto Antichrist.
                        The bondage of Egypt must lie vpon
their necks, these cruell taske-maisters
must encrease their burdens & withdraw
their means: that so at length
the oppressed world might grone to
the Lord, who in his mercy, hath (in
some measure) released the yoake of
the oppressor, in restoring light vnto
the world, and authoritie to the magistrate.
                        And so now it is come to passe,
that thogh in places of ignorance, witchcraft
aboundeth, because, as yet, the
strong man keepes possession: yet,
where the light of the Gospell hath
once taken footing, as at the comming
of Christ the Oracles ceased,Plutarch. so
Satan falls downe like lightning, at the
preaching of the Gospel, and the grosenesse
of Witchcraft is well cleared, and
banished, only bicause, though the Gospel
be offred vnto al, yet seeing al receiue
not the knowlege of the truth:

Therefore it is iust with God to giue
vp men to strong delusions,
                           2. Thess. 2. 11. 12. 
                           to beleeue lies:
and so Satan becomes, not only a lying
spirit in the mouth of the Prophets,1. Reg. 22.
to deceiue vnstable soules, but
taking euen seuen spirits worse,
                           Luke 11. as the
doctrine of the Gospell, decayes in it
purity, and so becomes a Broker to
profanenesse: so together with corruption
of Doctrine, Popish delusions
crept in againe, to beguile and enthrall
vnstable soules: And among
these Delusions, Witch-craft not the
least, hath againe got some life and
power, where the Gospel hath beene
reuealed. And that,
                        1 By being defended and iustified
by godlesse men,Scot. & alij as if there were no
such thing, that it is but a conceit.
                        2 Being detected, yet is it not punished
thorowly. The Blesser escapes,
and the silly people that run to this
white Diuell, are let alone.
                        Which,Vse. as it may teach the wise
to see the plague, and hide himselfe, so
it may resolue vs concerning the places
where Witches haunt vsually.
                           Of the places where Witches haunt,
                        
                        
                           
either in places of ignorance,
                           In what places witches most abound, and how. and
there in more grosse and sensible
manner, or else in Places of knowledge
abused, where Hypocrisie and carnall
wisedome, hath thrust out the power of
synceritie: There Satan returnes with
seuen worse spirits, Witch-craft is embraced
and countenanced of men,
So much the more dangerously, by
how much now Witches are become
great Professors, and followers of the
Word, haue attained some knowledge,
and pretend great holinesse,
and honestie; whereby as it appeareth
that Satan is now transformed into
an Angell of light; so are wee informed
heereby the rather to arme our
selues against such cunning and desperate
policies, which now especially
are plotted to the ensnaring of
our soules.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. XI.
                     
                        Of the diuers kinds of Witches, and
their effects.
                     
                     HItherto of the difference of
Witches, in regard of their
Training to, and interessing in their
Trade.
                     Now let vs further consider of
their seuerall kinds and effects. Howsoeuer
Satan doth especially by this
Art of Witch-craft, raigne in the children
of disobedience, and doth generally
aime at the destruction of
the soule; yet as formerly he varied
his pollices, according to the seuerall
Ages of the world, and diuerse
dispositions and affections of men, in the
enticing of them to this Mysterie;
so doth he not want his dangerous
snares to detaine them in his obedience,
and that by limiting his
power in such seuerall manner vnto
each, that so they may confirme
each other in their Trade,
and by their mutuall references to

each other, doe more mischiefe in the
world.
                     And therefore as Feare and Loue
are two speciall bonds to bind to obedience,Policie of Satanin limiting of his power to Bad Witches.
therefore hath the Diuine
Prouidence so disposed, that Satans
power in some, shall bee restrained
onely to do hurt, that so such as will
not Feare God, may by this meanes
stand in awe of the deuill, and of the
Witch his seruant, who are called Bad
Witches.
                     
                     And so contrariwise, there are
others who by Diuine Iustice, are giuen
vp to Satans power with this limitation
onely,To good Witches or Blessers. 
                        to helpe and do good,
and these are called Good Witches,
Blessers, Wise, and Cunning-women. And
this Diuine Dispensation is both
Sutable to the parties who are limited
thereby, and also very auaileable
for the execution of the Diuine
Iustice.
                     
                     I say sutable it is to the seuerall qualities
of the parties, thus diuersly dispensed,
whereof some being vaine-glorious
& drowned in Poperie are therby caried

with the applause of Good Workes, and
therefore are fitted by Satan therevnto:
Others are prone to malice, discontent,
couetousnesse, &c. and so are
likewise fitted by the Deuill, with
power to bee auenged.
                     
                     And doth not the iust and holy
God,Gods wisdome in this diuersitie. by this diuersitie and restraint of
Satans power, accomplish most wisely
his iust wrath vpon the wicked?
                     Yea certainely, and that not onely
vpon the vnbeleeuing world, but vpon
the very Witches themselues. As for the
vnbeleeuing and wicked Generations
they are hurt by the one,
                        In confoū
                           ding the vnbeleeuing world that they
may with the danger of their soules
seeke helpe of the other: And they
haue helpe by the one, that so, as a
punishment of their infidelitie they
may bee giuen vp againe to bee hurt
of the other. And so betwixt the
Good Witch and the Bad, afflictions
are encreased, and yet repentance excluded,repētance excluded,
and so the measure of sinne is
made vp among the children of disobedience,
that so the measure of vengeance
may accordingly be inflicted.
                     
                        
And doth not this also very wisely,In condē
                           ning the Witches.
                        further the damnation of the Witches
themselues.
                     
                     Yea certainely, the Bad Witch, by
hurting, makes way for the good Witches
helpe, and so thereby encreaseth
her sinne; and the Good Witch in helping
bewrayes the Bad Witch, and so,
many times, brings her to the Gallowes.
                     The Good Witch in helping makes
more worke for the Bad, who being
suspected, reuengeth her selfe vsually
by doing more mischiefe, and so
thereby ripens her sinne to the Gallowes,
and so still makes more worke
for the Blesser to encrease her condemnation.
The Bad Witch, because she
doth hurt, is hated of the world, and so
thereby encreaseth her malice, and
doth more harme. The good Witch is
honoured, and reputed as a God, because
she doth good, and so is hardened
in her sinne and ripeneth the same,
by adding to all former sinnes, finall
impenitencie, and so vsually commits
the vnpardonable sin.
                     
                     
                        
Thus doth the prouidence of God
appeare in the diuers dispensation of
his iudgements, by these instruments
of his fierce wrath.
                     Who in these daies are for the
most part women.
                        Witches for the most part women.
                     
                     1 Both because these are commonly
more ignorant, and therefore
fitter to be ensnared.
                     2 And also vsually more ambitious
and desirous of Soueraignety, the
rather because they are bound to
subiection.
                     3 And are also more obstinate where
they take, and so fitter to stick to it.
                     4 And by reason of their sex and
simplicitie haue more meanes to hide this
sinne, or else to escape punishment, as being
more capable of compassion, in
regard of necessary occasions of
child-bearing, &c.
                     
                        SECTIO. I.
                        
                           Of the Bad Witch.
                        
                        THus she is so called, because
she hath onely power from

                           Satan to doe hurt,
                           Of the bad Witch. and that by
speciall league and conenant with Satan.
                        And this is also called the binding
Witch, in a blasphemous imitation
of that Diuine power of binding
and afflicting which peculiarly belongeth
vnto the glorious Lord:
Ose. 6. 1.
                        Her power extendeth in shew euen
as her Maisters Satan doth, not onely
vpon the dumbe and senselesse creatures
to breed terrour and inconuenience
to man, but euen vpon man himselfe,
Both vpon his bodie to strike it
with all kindes of diseases, yea with
death it selfe, Iob. 1. 17.
                        As also vpon the soule, to afflict
with Madnesse, security, &c.
                        
                        And yet her power is restrained
onely to doe hurt, and that in diuerse
respects, as you haue partly heard:
especially,
                        1 That heereby Satans power and
gouernement may bee more aduanced
in this diuerse dispensation of his
gifts.
                        
                           
2 That the Bad Witch may bee confouaded
in her power, seeing it is not
paramount, she cannot helpe what is
hurt.
                        3 That way heereby may be made for
ber detection by the Blesser.
                        
                        4 That the Good Witch may by
this meanes vent all his cousening waies
of spels, charmes, &c. to helpe
withall.
                     
                     
                        SECT. III.
                        
                           Of an ordinarie meanes whereby these
Bad Witches seeme to effect their mischiefes,
namely, by cursing: where of
Satans policie in colouring his assistance
heereby, and deceiuing and
hardening the Witch in her sin.
                        
                        AS the Bad Witch hath power to
hurt,Why Bad Witches vse cursing. so as it is obserued, doth
shee vsually execute this power.
                        1 By horrible & fearfull cursings and
execerations of those Parties whom
she malignes.
                        Inuocating vpon her bare knees
(for so the manner is) the vengeance

of God vpon them. And if she can
conueniently to their faces, breathing
out these fearefull curses and direfull
execrations against them.
                        So (not to vse further instance) is
it confessed, that this condemned
captiue vsed ordinarily to curse her
neighbours, and thereby (as shee
vaunted) to get the vpper hand of
them.
                        And this in an Apish and blasphemous
imitation of the Diuine Iustice,
which by such maner of execrations
is denounced against the wicked,
Deuteron. 28. Leuiticus 26. Iudges 5.
Curse ye Meros, &c.
                        
                        Now the Policie of Sathan in prouoking
to these execrations is manifold.Sathans Policie to deceiue others.
As not onelie,
                        1 Hereby to encrease the Witches
sinne, by enraging her soule through
these cursings to malice and reuenge.
                        But heereby also the Lord in his
Iustice Returneth her cursings on her
owne pate, though she may hurt the
bodies of others thereby, yet the chief

hurt shall rebound vpon her owne
soule.
                        
                        The wrath of God like a riuer of
Brimstone inflaming those Execrations
which the accursed caitife sendeth
vp to Heauen, and so returning
them backe vpon the Author thereof:
and is to seale vp hereby vnto her
eternall vengeance, yet so, as that it
is very fearefully cloaked euen by
these cursings.
                        
                        For heereby Satan not onelie perswades
the Witch, that whatsoeuer
euill ensues, proceeds from the vertue
of that curse, and not from his secret
helpe.
                        But in that the name of God is inuocated
to take vengeance on these
parties, thereby also the power of
Satan is further concealed: as if now
the Lord did answere the desires of
these Monsters.
                        And so, in that hee doth answere
them, therefore they are in great
request with him: yea in that things
succeede according to their cursings,
heereby is arrogated the power of almightie

God, and so the Witch puffed
vp with conceit of diuine authoritie.
                     
                     
                        SECTIO IV.
                        
                           ¶Of Good Witches or Blessers, as
wee tearme them: Heere first of
their Nature and Condition.
                        
                        AS the Badde Witch hath onelie
power to hurt:what good witches are with their power. So the Good
Witch or Blesser hath onely facultie
to doe good: to helpe, &c. And that
also by consent, in a league with the
diuell: And is therefore blasphemously
termed The Vnbinding Witch, as
being able to vndoe what the other
hath done.
                        And this Satan disposeth in notable
Policie,
                           Sathans policie heerein. not onelie that some order
may appeare in his kingdome of
Darkenesse, whereupon it may the
rather be obeyed; but especially,

aduancing hereby his imaginarie power
in the hearts of his Proselites, that
he is as God, able to doe all things, to
hurt, and helpe, &c. and thereby secretly
to delude his Schollers, that if
they can vnbinde others, why may
they not vndoe their owne bonds:
what reckoning to be made of anie
Couenant with Sathan, seeing hee
will thus bee content to haue his
workes dissolued, &c.
                        And this the rather, because he so
diuides his gifts, as may be thought;
not to one all, but to each seuerall:
whereby he I both blasphemously imitates
the diuine prouidence; 2 ties
the Witches more obsequiously vnto
him, 3 makes shew of absolute libertie
in his dispensation, 4 and
hereby sitteth his instruments to doe
more mischiefe, 5 and yet secureth
them in their damnable estate: as
being by this meanes more seruiceable
to each other.
                     
                     
                        
                        SECTIO IIII.
                        
                           ¶That their skill in helping to things
that are stollen, and healing diseases,
is not a gift of GOD:
whereuppon they are accounted
Good, but rather they doe it certainely
by the helpe of Sathan.
                        
                        THat it is not of God, appearth,
1 By the Qualitie of their persons,
                           Of the power of blessers, in healing and restoring stollen goods, whether it be of God.
because they are generally, ignorant,
prophane, abhominable, and
therefore the Lord will not reueale
such secrets vnto them, Psalme 25.
But vnto them that feare him.
                        
                        2 By the Consideration of the time,
wherein these Reuelations are pretended:Proued by the Time.
which being the time of the
Gospell established, when an ordinarie
meanes of reuealing Gods will
is on foote; therefore now wee hauing
the Word, as we may not expect
such Reuelations, so they are
not granted to vs, from the Lord
our God.
                        
                           
Especially,Secondly, Matter of reuelation if we consider the matter
pretēded to be reuealed, which is not
any necessarie thing, concerning Saluation,
but onelie some particular
accidentall matter, concerning the
present estate of this life, for which
we find not that there were any Reuelations
from the Lord,Reuelatiō of what. but onelie
concerning the generall state of Kingdomes,
and as it concerned the Spirituall
good of the Church.
                        
                        Besides,Thirdly, Maner of reuelation if we consider the manner
of the Reuelation, which is neyther by
Gods spirit immediatly, nor by an Angell
from heauen, not by the soule of
some man, that is formerly dead, and
that in some Dreame or Vision, for
such were the Reuelations from the
Lord; but by seeing in the picture of
men in a Glasse, &c. which may easily,
and must necessarily be done by
Sathan, as both prouoking the thiefe
to steale, and being able to represent
his Image in the Glasse as personating
him before the Glasse, and so
the Reflexion must needes returne
the like resemblance.
                        
                           
And this must necessarily follow,Fourthly, by the end of this reuelation.
if we consider the end of this Reuelation;
which is, to haue goods restored; which
being vtterly vnlawfull, because we
should rest contented with this losse,
as a chasticement for sinne, and so
rather goe to God, to enquire the
cause of the losse, and to haue sinne
pardoned, then to runne to the wise
woman to haue the losse restored.
                        So that the thing being vnlawfull,
it is iust with GOD, to leaue vs
to seeke vnlawfull meanes, that so
one sinne may be the punishment of
another.
                        Lastly,Fiftly, not warranted by the word. seeing whatsoeuer helpe is
lawfully to be vsed in any extremity
is plainely commended to vs in the word:
Therefore, seeing the word doth directly
condemne all these indirect
and diu ellish helpes, and commandeth
1 to seeke helpe principally
from the Prophets of the Lord, and
2 so to vse meanes of Physicke,Note. as
the diseases require. Therefore it
plainly folows, that seeing these blessers
are neither acquainted with Gods

word, nor skilfull in Phisicke; the help
that they minister must needes come
from Satan, whose Creatures, and
vassals they now are, who coloureth
his diuellish helpe, both with some
formall prayers, and other medicins,
that so hee may more dangerously
beguile vnstable soules.
                        This shal appeare yet more clearly
vnto vs, if we consider further.
                        That although these Wisards pretend
to helpe by holy meanes,Note this. yet,
were there no other euidence to
prooue their affistance from Sathan,6 By the strāge torments vpon them.
this one were sufficient, That these
Blessers are not onlie strangely tormented,
while they are performing this
cure, but are euen afflicted with the
same diseases, which for the present,
they seeke to remoue from others.
                        Now, that this is the worke of Sathan,
is manifest.
                        1 Because the olde Sybills and other
Witches were vsually so tormented,
when they gaue their Oracles,
who are generally concluded to bee
Sathans prophets.
                        
                        
                           
2 This their strange tormenting, in
this pretended good act, argueth
that it is not of God, who would not
so requite his seruants, whom hee
sets on worke, especially doing his
will, But rather of Satan, who by
these torments convinceth them of
the euill of their work, and confoundeth
hereby the vnbeleeuing world,
that will seeke to such for helpe: Especially,
if we consider further
                        That whereas there is a reciprocall
couenant betweene Satan and the Blesser,
as hath beene declared, that as the
Deuill must doe what the Witch
would haue him, so the Witch must
endure what Satan will impose. If
now it fals out,Note. that the Disease
which the Witch would haue remoued
from another, shall be transported
vpon her selfe, as a pledge of further
torments, to confound her in her
present power, and yet to deceiue her
withall, as if by this strange alteration
and torment she descrued to
obtaine this preheminence, as to
helpe others, she hath bought it

deerely: And so yet further to deceiue,
                           Note.
as if because she hath her paine here,
therefore she shall auoid further reckoning:
Is not the iustice of God
admirable here? Is not his wisedome
wonderfull to take the wise in their
owne craftinesse?
                        
                     
                     
                        SECTIO. V.
                        
                           ¶Of the Couenant whereby these Blessers
binde themselues to doe good,
namely, the Beleefe of men, whether
they can benefite any that doe not
bleeue in them: and why they are
beneficiall to such: And so consequently
of the danger of these Good
Witches, and that they are farre more
dangerous then the Bad.
                        
                        As Satan binds his seruants vnto
his obeysance by a speciall
contract and couenant (as hath beene
shewed throughly before) so the
good Witch,
                           Of the couenant of the Blesser, namely, that she must bee credited. being lessoned by her accursed
Maister, doth hereby endeuor
to performe truest seruice vnto him,
euen by hunting after and ensnaring

the precious soules of men: And
to this purpose she hath no more
dangerous snare then this condition
of Faith, that those who will
haue helpe or succour at her hands,
must beleeue shee can doe them
good.
                        
                        For whereas Faith is the onely
Bond whereby God is knit vnto man,
and man vnto God: If therefore Satan
can but once breake this bond; as he
doth heereby:
                        First, exelude vs the especiall prouidence
of the Almighty.
                        Secondly, so doth he make way
hereby, for the full possessing, and
preuailing ouer vs.
                        Thirdly, and hence it is that there
must bee no helpe without this Beleefe
in the Witches abilitie heerevnto:
That so the Blesser also being
puffed vp with a conceipt of
some Diuine Power, might so therein,
not onely Intrude into the
Office of the Messiah, and thereby
to depriue her selfe vtterly of the
benefite of his sacrifice; but also

euen make a mocke of the Sonne of
God by translating that precious gift
of Faith,Note. which onely entends saluation,
to the attaining of euery base
and vnfit trifle, and horrible wickednesse,
yea offering vp heereby
the deceiued soule, as a Sacrifice vnto
Satan, which cost the precious bloud of
the Sonne of God.
                        
                        Fourthly, especially, heerein doth
appeare the desperate pride and malice
of Satan against Iesus Christ and
his members.
                        
                        1 As aduancing himselfe heereby
in Christs steed, in the deceiued hearts
of the vnbeleeuers.
                        2 And robbing him, not onely of
that proper homage which is due
from the creature, namely, to depend
on it Sauiour:
                        
                        3 But also of the soules of those
that are thus ensnared.
                        4 As detaining them thereby in
Atheisme and contempt of Gods Ordinances
for saluation,
                        5 And emboldening them to all desperate
and outragious courses vpon

presumption of helpe from these incarnate
deuils.
                        6 And soripening thereby vnto eternall
vengeance. And this the rather,
because by this condition of Faith
thus required for helpe;
                        7 It is thereby the rather warranted
to come from God.
                        8 And so both the Witches authority
and power iustified to this end,
as Diuine, euen a speciall Gift of God
to such purposes.
                        9 As also the peoples seeking to
such meanes is coloured.
                        10 And so, in that helpe heereby
is procured for many wicked ends,
therefore fearefull and blaspemous
conceipts are heereby nourished in
the mindes of vnbeleeuers,Note. concerning
the Diuine Nature; As if the
Lord should approue of sinne,
                           Psal. 50. that hee
furthers, and giues successe thereto.
And when this gappe is once opened,
how is sinne committed with greedinesse?
How is the deceiued soule
drunkē in security? How by this security
prepared to suddaine destructiō?

And therefore though it were enough
for Satan to doe good at the
command of the Blesser, to hold her
surer vnto him by these deuotions:
Yet seeing he is a roaring Lyon, geing
about seeking whom he may
deuoure; doth he also yet both
further heereby the damnation of the
Sorceresse, in making her an instrument
(by this condition of Faith) to ensnare
the soules of men, and so by
the same meanes, encreaseth his prey,
in deceiuing such vnstable soules
who depend vpon such dangerous
helpe.
                        And therefore though no doubt,
by Diuine permission, he could helpe
one with the Good Witches warrant
(this being but his colour to deceiue
her and others) and so much more
(if she imployed him) without the
Faith of the parties, and happily doth
tender some trifling helpe without
this Couenant (to beleeue) to tolle
the simple on, to seeke further to
him: Yet seeing he specially is
all these, aimes at the soules destruction,
                           
and as the Diuine executioner
to preuaile in the children of
disobedience: Therefore seeing the
World generally will not receiue the
knowledge of the truth, shall it not bee
giuen vp to beleeue lies? 2. Thessalonians
2. 11. 12. Euen to seeke vnto Satan,
forsaking God, &c. so to buy his
helpe with the danger of their
soules: In hunting after which,
this aduersarie is now growne so
cunning, as that howsoeuer heeretofore
in Times of Ignorance, he
vsed more carnall and palpable
meanes for the ensnaring of them;
Yet since the Gospell of Iesus
Christ hath beene aduanced, and
the knowledge thereof hath in
some good measure banished grosse
ignorance in many places, therefore
doth Satan suite himselfe accordingly:
And so, though he require
reall couenants of some,Note the policie of Satan in times of knowledg. in
some cases, yet is he contented
also with Mentall Couenants, as
being able to gesse at the minde
by some outward inclinations

and distempers, and so doth more
cunningly and dangerously deceiue
euen the professors of this Age, whom
seeing they professe to beleeue in
Christ, therefore will he not require
an open couenant to beleeue in him:
As contenting himselfe:
                        1 That they allow helpe to bee
sought from such meanes.
                        2 That in case of necessitie they will
not stick to seeke themselues.
                        3 That they do not aswell further
the Blesser,
                           Note. as the Bad Witch to punishment,
&c.
                        All which, and such like, he takes
as arguments of their secret confidence
in him, as approuing his power, and
iustifying the lawfulnesse of such
meanes.
                     
                     
                        SECTIO. VII.
                        
                           Whether the good Witch can hurt, and
the hurting Witch helpe.
                        
                        BY that which hath beene said
before concerning the limitation
of the power of these Witches, it may

seeme to be concluded, that the Good
Witch can onely help, and the Bad Witch
onely can hurt.
                        
                        But yet Experience seemes to
proue the contrarie, not onely in
Hartley, that famous Coniurer of Lancashire,
which betwitched Mr. Starkie
of Clee-worthes Children, who was also
a great Blesser, &c. And so in diuers
others: But especially in the Witch
that was the principall occasion of
this Treatise.
                        For it appeareth by her examinations,
that shee both vsed to forespeake
(as they call it) that is to hurt,
and wearie things, as also to blesse
the same againe, and so to helpe as
well as to hurt: As appeareth by
the Charme heereafter set downe to
this end.
                        To which wee answere.
                        That though happily by Couenant
Satan binds himselfe no further but
to the Blesser to helpe, and to the Bad
Witch to hurt, because
                        Either they desire no further, or

else this limitation may serue for such
end as heeretofore.
                        Yet heerein also doth Satans cunning
appeare notably, that if vpon
such composition onely to hurt or helpe,
                           Note Sathans cunning.
he yet proue better then his bargaine,
as to assist such to helpe who haue
done hurt, &c, By this meanes, he
binds his seruants more obsequiously
vnto him; and yet deceiues them more
grossely.
                        As giuing them occasion now to
conceiue, That seeing he couenanted
with them onely to hurt or helpe:
If now it shall appeare that the Bad
Witch can also helpe,
                        
                        Is not this a notable delusion to
flatter her, that she hath some extraordinarie
power aboue what
Satan can conferre vnto her, and
so that the League betweene them
is disanulled and broken: She is now
free (as she thinkes) and rather by
some Diuine Assistance can vndo and
helpe what is fore-spoken, as they
vse to speake?
                        And seeing Satan in all these Couenants
                           
with the Witch,
                           Note the ouer-ruling power of God. is no Free
Agent, but the Lords Executioner to
run and stay at his pleasure: As the
Lord therefore hath speciall ends in
the disposing of this Couenant to hurt
or helpe; so may he not haue speciall
purpose in this, exceeding therein, that
the same that hurteth may also helpe,
and the same that helpeth may also
hurt?
                        
                        
                           Yea certainely: The Lords purpose
in permitting and wisely ordering
these Compacts betweene Satan and
the Witch to hurt or helpe; vsing the
Deuill herein as the instrument of
his Diuine Iustice vpon the children
of disobedience, hath beene in some
poore measure manifested heretofore:
And hereby
                        Doth Hee wisely and gloriously
make manifest,Note this. that Satan is but his
Vassall, that all Couenants betweene
the Witch and him, for onely hurting
and helping, are subordinate to his
power, alterable at his pleasure, that
though Satan agree with the one
Witch to helpe, and with the other

onely to hurt, yet shall the hurting
Witch also helpe, and the helping
Witch hurt, that it may appeare
also that these Couenants are but
Iugling Trickes betweene Satan
and the Witch, to draw fooles to
the stockes, and so on eyther
side to beguile more fearefully:
That seeing the Blesser pretendeth
to helpe: as she doth heereby draw
more Proselites after her, for good,
so shall she haue power to hurt them,
both to keepe them the more in
awe,
                           Note. and so to seeke vnto her more
slauishly, and depend the more constantly
on her power; as also when
their sinne is heereby ripened, to
confound them more fearefully, and
so to execute the wrath of God vpon
them.
                        And the Badde Witch also, though
the Couenant bee, That shee must
onelie hurt, that so shee may execute
her malice vppon the bodies
of vnbeleeuers, and so send them
to the Blesser for the further destruction
of their soules: yet to spare

this labour: and make the delusion
more effectuall to deceiue, may not
the GOD of Wisedome deuolue
both these Faculties of hurting and
helping to one person: May hee not
heereby giue way to Sathan to aduaunce
himselfe fully in the hearts
of the children of disobedience: as
God of this world, to saue and destroy
at his pleasure?
                        And as the Lord in restraining
Sathan to hurt or helpe in those diuerse
Instruments, would giue an
vnderstanding heart to consider the
limited power of Sathan, and so to depend
vppon an higher Power of the
Diuine Maiestie: so seeing the naturall
and desperate sinner, as hee
is fast bound to the power of Sathan,
euen so willingly would hee
serue none other maister: therefore,
that hee may serue him the
more cheerefully, it is the Iustice of
GOD, so to giue vp to Sathans
delusions, as that hee shall thinke hee
needes serue no other maister.
                        And hence it proceedeth, that the

miserable soule affecting a sufficiencie
in that God whom it subiects it
selfe vnto, able to steed at all assaies;
Therefore, seeing Satan by these
Witches labours to erect his Throne
in the hearts of the disobedient: It
stands with great policie, that this
power of hurting and helping shall appeare
in one and the same, both to
resemble an Vnitie in this Fayned
Deitie, As also to confirme the conceited
Omnipotencie, and sufficiency
thereof.
                        And seeing wee are fallen into
these euill daies,2. Tim. 3. 2. 3. wherein iniquitie aboundeth,
and ripeneth to the Haruest,
2. Tim. 3. 2, 3.
                        Doth not therefore the admirable
Wisedome and Iustice of God heerein
gloriously shine; that whereas vsually
the Good Witch hath escaped and
beene aduanced of man, and therefore
puffed vp with pride, and so prouoked
to doe mischiefe; it now pleaseth
the Lord to giue her her desire,
that she which helpeth may also hurt?
thereby,
                        
                           
1 To flatter her with a conceipt
of her Soueraigne Power.
                        
                        2 To nurse her heereby in desperate
securitie.
                        3 So by this meanes to ripen her
sin, and so to take her napping in her
owne counsels.
                        4 Exposing her to the Sword of the
Magistrate,
                           Note. as hauing done such mischiefes,
and so confounding not onely
her owne confidence, but the repose
of the world in her, who esteemes
her the onely Goddesse, seekes
to her for helpe, &c. Shall not this
lesson the vnbeleeuing Generation not to
tamper with her, least though they
regard not their soules, in seeking
helpe from her, yet they may secure
their liues and estates in not medling
with her?
                        Oh that wee could obserue the
waies of God heerein! May wee not
hence learne wonderfull things? Shal
not all Idolatry come to the blocke?
Shall not Anti-christ that great Coniurer,
likewise be confounded?Note. And shal
not his open and desperate practises of

murthering Princes, and bringing desolation
in the world, iustified and
taught, now hasten him to his confusion,
who heretofore hath beene
esteemed the common Papa, the father
and giuer of life, and saluation to the
sonnes of men?
                     
                     
                        SECT. VIII.
                        BY this which hath beene said,Vse 1. it
appeareth now plainely:
                        That the Blesser or good Witch (as
we terme her) is farre more dangerous
then the Badde or hurting Witch:
                           The good Witch most dāgerous.
And,
                        1 That because first shee is lesse
suspected and feared then the other,
and therefore is like to do more mischeife.
                        2 Nay she is magnified and adored
among men as a Demy Goddesse, &c.
and so causeth men to commit Idolatrie
to her by putting confidence
in her.
                        3 She yeeldeth helpe for the satisfying

of the flesh, and so hardnesse in
sinne procureth hope of longer life, excludeth
Repentance, withdraweth from
the loue of the Word, and lawfull
meanes, nourisheth in ignorance, prophanenesse,
&c.
                        4 The badde Witch vsually is haled
to punishment, and so is preuented
of much euill doing, and happily by
this meanes brought to repentance:
But the Blesser is spared, and so permitted
to doe more mischiefe, vnder
pretence of well-doing, and thereby
ripeneth her selfe more fearefully
to vengeance.
                        5 Shee yeeldeth helpe at a verie desperate
rate; namely, the endangering
of the soule: and, What will it
profite a man to winne the whole world,
and loose the same? Math. 16. 26,
                        And so also is her estate most dangerous
and fearefull in regard of herselfe,
as by requiring this condition of
faith, euen despiting the spirite of grace,
& making a mocke of the Sonne of God:
& so vsually committing that vnpardonable
sinne, Hebr. 6. 4. 10. 16. 17.
                        
                           
And therefore this serueth:
                        1 For the reproofe of the Times
wherein these Darlings of Satan are
so embraced and adored.
                        2 It is an Instruction to the Magistrate,
to bend the edge of his sword
against these most dangerous Instruments:
and to giue way vnto the
Gospel, to cut them downe.
                        3 It is a Caueat to the people, to
take heede of these snares, to seeke
after knowledge, and submit to holie
meanes, that so the Lord may
haue mercy on their soules, that being
within his protection, they
may bee better secured
concerning their
bodies.

                     CHAP. I.
                     
                        Of the Power of Witches, what they
are able to doe, and of Satans cunning
sleights and stratagems herein.
                     
                     
                        THe maine thing whereby
Sathan fetcheth ouer
these monsters,
                        Of the power of witches. and
holdes them in his obeisance:
is that great
power which he deuolueth vnto thē.
Whereby being able, in shew, to do

                        what they list, they are so transported
with Pride, and wholy blinded
therewith, that either they are hereby
secured in their estates, seeing
they can do such Feates, or else carelesse
altogether thereof, for the intending
and prosecuting of wonderfull
things.
                     It shall not therefore be amisse in
the next place, hauing proued

                           1 That there are Witches.
                           
                           2 How they attayne to this high
mysterie; and,
                           3 What seuerall kindes there are of
them.
                        
                     
                     To adde now somewhat concerning
this their extraordinary power.
                     
                     That so we may be rightly informed
how farre they are able to preuaile:
and withal, may discerne how
notably they are abused by Satan making
them beleeue that their power
is farre greater then indeed it is.
                     To this purpose consider we these
two things.
                     First, wherein this power of Witches
is restrained: and,
                     
                        
Secondly, wherein it is enlarged,
and particularly aduaunceth it selfe,
Concerning the first.
                     
                     
                        SECTIO I.
                        
                           That the Witches Power is lesse then
it seemeth, as appeareth;
                        
                        FIrst,The power of wiches restrained, 1 By the Lord. because she is restrained by
the Lord, that shee can not hurt
when she would.
                        As, not the children of God alwayes
whom she maliceth.
                        Neyther these so farre as she would:
                           In regard of the Elect.
as not at all to hurt their soules finally:
                        No not vsually to take away life.
                        
                        Nor vpon each occasion, as shee
is prouoked: The Lord restraining
her in loue vnto his Children, and
for the glorie of his great name: Defending
his Seruants by the attendance
of his holie Angells, Psalme 91.
That the euill one shall not doe them
any violence.
                        
                           
Neither wicked men,
                           In respect of the wicked. so farre as she
would, and intendeth.
                        As, not all, at all times, whom she
maliceth: The Lord in his Iustice
brideling her, 1 for the further confusion
of the Witch: 2 for the aduancement
of his patience to the wicked: 3 for
the fatting of them vp heereby to the day
of slaughter, and to harden them in their
Atheisme, that there are no Witches,
no Diuels, no Hell, no Heauen, but
what is in this life.
                        Neyther to take life from those
whom shee afflicteth, at all times:
that so they may still enioy greater
Patience, and thereby, eyther bee
brought to repentance, by the distemper
of the chasticement, or be made
inexcusable.
                        
                        And this, so is disposed:
                        1 Both for the encrease of her malice,
and so ripening of her sinne, being
disappoynted, and restrained, it
raging more within, the more it is
outwardly curbed, and so fretting
against God, when she cannot haue
her will of men: yea raging, and many

times tearing her selfe, when she
is brideled from hurting others.
                        2 As also for the confusion of her
skill and conceited kingdome, as being
now enthralled, and iustly brideled,
that so horrour of conscience hereby
increasing, she may haue her condē
                           nation
sealed vp, and hereby be prouoked
to renue her couenant with Satan
to obtain a greter measure of power,
to make him more seruiceable to hir.
                        3 And the Lord hath an especiall
aime heerein, for the more orderly and
comely gouernement of the world; which
is thus graciously preserued and aduaunced:
whereas, if Witches might
haue their wills to hurt whom and
how far they list: neither good Magistrate
nor Minister should stand, none
should be mightier then they to controule
them, none holier to confound
thē: their rage, enuy, & couetousnesse
would make confusion & desolation
euery where, and so the prouidence
of God would be hardned, and the
workes of his gouernment hindered
and disgraced in the world.
                     
                     
                        
                        SECTIO. II.
                        
                           Her Power is lesse then it seemeth.
                        
                        1 Because Satan doth many things by
diuine dispēsatiō imediatly,
                           Sathan doth many things without the witch. which
yet notwithstanding he fathereth on
the Witch: and seemeth to doe at her
sending, which yet he doth by his
skill, in Naturall Temperatures of
the bodies of Creatures, and their
diseased estates;Note. And so being able
to guesse at the times,Gifford by his skil. when they
will come to their Crisis, and are like
to speed: then speeds he to the witch,
prouoks her to malice the parties, & so
offers to be sent to execute that malice,
which falling out at the time
when the Witch sendeth, shee thereupon
conceiues, that shee is the Authour
of the hurt. Shee confesseth it a
often on the gallowes; whereas all
this is but Sathans immediate worke:
and yet she iustly punished,
                           Note. for dealing
with Sathan, who thus deceiues.
                        1 To hasten her to iudgement.
                        
                        
                           
2 To satisfie the rage of the world against
her, & thereby either to make
them guiltie of shedding innocent bloud,
and so to increase their sinne.
                        3 To obtaine his prey of her soule
more speedily.
                        4 And so to seeke a new maister, or
dame, to increase his kingdome.
                        5 But his especiall policie herein is:
by fathering it on the Witch, to make
worke for the good Witch. Now they
must runne to her; help must be had,
and what more ready then the cunning
woman, especially seeing she doth
it with so little cost? and doth it with
so good prayers, at the least, procures
ease, which Nature is satisfied with,
though it is bought at a deare rate, euen
with horrible and blasphemous
abuses of Gods name, cursed confidence
in Satan, &c.
                        6 And seeing we are many times
conceited & suspitious of our neighbors,
ready to iudge vncharitably & rashly
of them:Note. doth not Sathan further
the conceit by deluding the Witch, as
to thinke that Sathan did such things

at her sending,Deluding the Witches senses. which also Sathan in
his policy must haue published, to confirme
vs in our vncharitable and crucell
conceit, and so thereby prouoke
vs further to shed innocent bloud.
                        Secondly, Sathan doth also many
things by deluding her senses: making
her to beleeue that which is not, and
so deceiueth her in the conceit of her
power: As that shee is transformed
into a Cat and Hare, and so can enter
into places the doores being fast, which
is contrary to a naturall bodie, &c.
                        For though Peter came out of prison
and the doores all locked,
                           How Peter came out of the prison, the doors being shut. yet was this
done; First, by the mightie power of
God: Secondly, nothing was done,
but what might stand with the condition
of a naturall body. The doores by
the power of God were opened, and
so gaue place to the bodie. The bodie
was not contracted and exininated to
pierce the same: neyther could the
qualitie of the bodie endure the paine,
neyther the quantitie be dispoyled of
it dimensions.
                        As for that Dreame of the spirites

transporting the bodie lying dead in the
bed,
                           Refutatiō of that cō
                              ceit, that the soule returnes to the dead body 
                           and returning to it againe afterward:
This being contrary to the diuine decree,
That the soule being separated
from the bodie, should returne to it
againe, till the Resurrection: it must
needes be a delusion and forgerie of Sathan.
                        
                        Thirdly,3 restraint by composition. the Witches power is restrained
by Composition and Couenant
with the Diuell, as the Good Witch
must onely helpe, and the Bad Witch
she must onely hurt: the one must be
accounted the binding Witch, that other
the vnbinding: The Policie of Sathan
heerein hath beene partly discouered
before. As also the iustice of God
in confounding this couenant, and enlarging
this power is layd downe
hereafter.
                        Fourthly, the power at least of the
good Witch,
                           4 restraint by the faith of the Patients. is restrained to the faith
of the party whom she intends to help:
Either hee must beleeue, shee can
help him, or else, he shall receiue no
good from her; Of the reason and vse
heereof elsewhere.
                        
                        
                           
Fiftly,Fiftly, restraint by the magistrat the power of all Witches is
restrained by the authoritie of the Magistrate.
For though, if a priuate person
detain them, they may either hurt
or escape, yet if once the magistrate
hath arrested them, Satans power ceaseth,
in being not now able to hinder
and defraud the Iustice of the Almightie:
And lastly, it is also restrained
to the good of the Church. To this
end examine we
                        
                     
                     
                        SECTIO III.
                        
                           Whether seeing Sathan hath power from
God,First quere to afflict mā, that he doth the rather
more hurt, by the means of witches
                        
                        NO question, seeing wee are apt
to distrust God, and depend vpon
those, and to forsake Gods word; therefore
it is iust with God, to giue vs vp
to be deceiued by them: so that, it is
not for the Witches sake, but for the
wickednes of man, that Satans power is
enlarged: both for the Witches further
condemnation, whose sinne is
hereby increased,
                        
                           
And also,Note. for the punishment of mans
horrible and strange sinnes: by those
strange and fearefull plagues, especially
to condemne the infidelitie of men,
in fearing or seeking to these.
                        
                           Onely herein obserue the policie of Sathan,
                           Sathans policie heerein.
who though hee haue power
from God, yet he will not execute it,
but as sent from the Witch, or at least,
seeming so; that so he may both diuert
the mind of man from God, and
so nourish him in ignorance and Atheisme,
as fearing and respecting
the Witch more then God;
                        As also, that hee may carrie the
mind from home, from the consideration
of our owne vilenes, and wickednesse,
to looke abroad to the
Witch, to obserue her malice, and so
to encrease our rage against her, and
thereby encrease our sinne, and yeeld
her more power ouer vs; and thereby
still to send the minde from God,
and his true meanes of helpe, to the
cunning woman, &c.
                        
                     
                     
                        
                        SECTIO IIII.
                        
                           Whether Witches may haue power ouer
Gods children.Second quere.
                           
                        
                        NO doubt they may haue it, so
farre as to afflict the body, because
these outward crosses are common
to all, Eccles. 9. 1.
                        And we are subiect to Infidelitie,Gods chidren may be afflicted by
and so to Sathans power.
                        Yea wee are ignorant who are Witches,
and so many times are chastized
for our foolish charity in relieuing
them.
                        3 Yea, wee may rashly condemne
and censure them:
                           witches In bodie. In soule. and therefore bee
liable to the hand of Almighty God
by them.
                        I And so by sympathy with the bodie,
the soule may be afflicted: yea
Sathan 2 may further afflict the
soule, by reason that it cannot brooke
so well the bodily misery, by working
vpon the impatiencie thereof, and so

forcing it to murmuring; yea to a
kinde of despaire: the rather, because
the children of God, through ignorance
or extremitie of paines, may by
themselues, or others vse such vnlawfull
meanes, or though they vse Phisicke,
and some such subordinate lawfull
helpes; yet the principall is neglected,
Repentance for sinne, and
Prayer vnto God.
                        
                           And seeing all things are alike to all
men;
                           Eccl. 9. 1. 2 may not Sathan worke so vpon
the minde, as by such or the like disposition
to bring it to many, and
such like raging fittes, eyther tampering
with the complexion, as melancholie,
&c. or furthering those passions
of discontent and despaire, by
leading them heereto.
                        
                           And the Prouidence of God in vsing
Sathan as an instrument,
                           Why gods children may be chastized by witches 
                           to inflict by
Witch-craft, these chasticements vpon
his children, is manifold.
                        
                        As first, to humble his children: that
they shall not escape this scourge, as
well as others: so I remember the
Lady Hales complained; What could

I haue no other affliction but this, I
could haue endured any, so it had not
beene by this, &c.
                        2 To comfort his seruants, that
seeing they shall in this greatest affliction
haue a comfortable issue to
conquer Satan, therefore heerevpon
they may build the certainety of their
saluation: As also,
                        
                        3 To instruct them, that seeing Satan
may haue power to take away
life, and yet not to hurt the soule finally,
therefore heere is the triall of
their Faith, though the Lord should
kill them yet to trust in him;
                           Iob. 13. 15. heere the
triall of their obedience, to yeeld vp
life into Gods hands; heere also their
Wisedome tried,
                           Actes 20. not to measure Gods
fauour by outward things, not to set
by this life, which Satan may preuaile
against.
                        And hath not the Lord in this affliction
of his Saints,The wicked heereby stumbled. 
                           some further vse
for the stumbling blocke of an vnbeleeuing
Generation?
                        
                        Yea surely, and that many waies:
                        1 Both to flatter them, that their

estate is good,
                           Note. seeing the godly fare as
bad as they do.
                        2 And also to stagger them, that
their estate is euill; seeing, if Gods
children are thus afflicted, for al their
knowledge, and holinesse in this life,
what shall become of them, that haue
no knowledge, hate holinesse, &c.
                        3 And heerein yet most dangerously
to stumble them, that seeing the
knowledge and holinesse of the
Saints cannot free them from the power
of Satan, therefore away with knowledge,
wel-fare ignorance; what boots
it to bee precise?
                           Note. Let vs liue as wee
list.
                        Nay seeing these meanes, cannot
preserue, Why may we not seeke to other?
and so a gap is open to all vnlawfull
meanes.
                        Especially, if wee obserue Satans
policie heerein, who vsually being
sent to afflict some holy one,Note Satans policie in the affliction of the Saints.
returnes as confounded, he cannot
doe it, because they haue Faith,
thereby intending, that none
that haue Faith, are subiect to his

power: and so puffing vp euen the
best with securitie, and thereby preparing
them through vaine confidence
to his malice: So perswading
the world, that he can touch any that
hath not faith, and so still robbing
God of his glorie; as if the let were
not in his free prouidence, but in the
goodnesse of man: As if the Lord did
not freely execute his prouidence,
but was bounded therein by somewhat
in man. And then he must be
sent to the childe of the faithfull father,
and preuaile there, as if the Faith of
the Parents did not hold Gods protection
ouer their tender Infants, aswell as ouer
themselues: or the Childe, because he
hath power ouer him, is excluded
Gods protection, hath not Faith, is
not of the faithfull feed.
                        And if now at the length it shall
appeare, that Sathan, though hee
haue returned as disappoynted by
the Faith of the Saints, yet shall preuaile
ouer anie, to afflict and torment
them: Beholde then the dangerous
delusions: Eyther this matter

of Faith is but a mockerie, seeing
it cannot resist Sathan: why should
it not repell him on the one side, as
well as on the other, If there were
any such thing, or it had anie such
power?
                        Or else, the Saints may loose their
Faith: and so, if Sathan preuayle against
life, he must then also preuaile
against Faith, for the vtter abolishing
of the power thereof.
                        And what difference then between
the wicked and godlie?
                        
                        Thus may the Saints be subiect to this
affliction: and thus may the world stumble
thereat.
                     
                     
                        SECTIO V.
                        
                           And yet in all these afflictions much
differ from the wicked.
                        
                        1 AS both in the cause of the affliction.
                           Diffrence betweene the godly & the wicked in their afflictions. Math. 25.
                        
                        2 In the measure of it.
                        3 In the issue thereof,
                        
                           
                           For the cause, If the Lord afflict
his children with this scourge, neither
is it in anger,
                           Psal. 6. 1. or simply as a punishment
of sin, though the Lord may
intend the chasticement of the sinner
heereby:
                           1 Difference in the cause. But especially, 1. To Try
their faith: 2. To prouoke to repentance:
3. And so to take them heereby out of
this miserable world.
                        
                        But in the wicked it is otherwise: The
Lord is angry when hee leaues them
to Satan, hee entends the discouerie
of their Infidelitie, and vnmasking of
their hypocrisie: By this sharpe affliction
hee awakens heereby their drowsie
conscience, and so in the horror thereof,
seales vp vnto them eternall vengeance,
and leauing them to be releiued
by carnall meanes, subiects them
thereby more surely to the power of
Satan,Note. by whom, making vp, in this
renuing of their daies, the measure
of their sin, they are ripened and
hastened to the day of vengeance.2 Difference in the measure.
                        
                        Thus they differ in the cause.
                        2 As for the measure, the affliction
either reacheth onely to touch

the bodie, or else if the soule beare a
part, still the hand of the Lord is put
vnder, Psal. 37. 24. comforts are supplyed
according to the affliction: or
the sharper affliction, prepares to
more sound and heauenly consolation.
                        
                        But for the wicked it is not so with
them: The soule is especially aimed
at by the malice of Satan, and therefore,
either the body is so smitten to
driue the soule to despaire, or else by
sending it to vnlawfull meanes, the
soule is more fearefully ensnared by
confidence in Satan, and so hastened to
it iust & vnauoidable confusion: And
thus they differ in regard of the measure.
                        
                        3 For the Issue,3 Difference in the issue. The Saints, If they
escape out this affliction, 1 are more
experienced in Satans subtiltie 2 more
enabled to comfort, and relieue
others, 3 more purged of carnall
confidence, 4 more humbled and
cast vpon the mightie power of
God, 5 more quickned in faith,
6 more weaned from the loue of

the world, 7 more warie to keepe
themselues within Gods protection,
more patient vnder the crosse, 8 more
prepared to death, 9 more readie
for the Lord. And therefore,
                        If they are translated heereby, they
make an happie exchange of sinne;
for perfect holinesse, of miserie for
eternitie, of transitorie for eternall
happinesse, of deceitfull friends for
the fellowship and eternall communion
of the thrice blessed God, that innumerable
company of heauenly spirites
and soules of the righteous; the vnseparable
vnion with Iesus Christ their
Sauiour.
                        But for the wicked; if they escape,
that which they seemed to haue, is taken
away; they grow worse and worse, filled
with all vnrighteousnesse, seuen worse
spirits seising vpon them. And if they
are taken away, then is the end of
all their vaine happinesse, and a full
powring out of Gods wrath vpon
them.
                     
                     
                        
                        SECTIO VI.
                        THus we haue heard wherein and by
what meanes the Witches power is
restrained.Wherein the witches power is enlarged.
                        
                        Now let vs consider on the other
side wherein it appeareth.
                        This may be discerned.
                        1. If we consider the Actions proper
to their owne persons.
                        
                        2. As also in their Actions towards
others.
                        
                        Concerning their owne persons.
                        
                        First, it cannot be denied, but that
more speedily,Actions cōcerning their persons. Speedy motion. then may stand with
the ordinarie course of nature, they
may assemble themselues to their
meetings, or trudge to do any mischiefe;
as being carried by Satans power
aboue the earth, or sea, speedily,
for some short space,Inuisible. not being seene
of any: which is not hard for Sathan
to do, by thickning the Ayre vnder
and about them.
                        As for any further means, whereby
they may transport themselues in the
likenes of an Hare, &c. this we haue

shewed before to be but a meere delusion,
notwithstanding any tokens
they bring for the proofe thereof.
                        But that they may abuse the bodies
of such,
                           Note. whom they malice to ride vpon
them, in the night: this howsoeuer
it bee not impossible, yet I take
it, it may rather prooue a delusion of
the parties sence that is thus pretended
to be abused, then any such reall
taking vp of his body out of bed,
and laying him there againe, because
this may bee doone with lesse adoe,
and yet deceiue more effectually.
                        Thus of the actions of the Witches towards
themselues.
                        Touching his Actions towards others.
Heere consider we these things.What the Witch can do towards others.
                        
                        1 Their maner of consulting thereon,
which is vsually in the Church, where
they meet, to worship their maister:
                        Heere, 1 the Diuell enquireth
what each would haue done.
                        2 They returne their particular
occasions and businesses.
                        3 Their demaund by Sathan is
graunted, and meanes propounded

and tendred to the execution therof.
                        As giuing them powders and poysons,
cōposed by his skill, in the secrets of
Nature to take away life, to inflict
diseases, & cure the same; and especially,Note.
to cloake his damnable conueiance
heerewith. Teaching them to
make Pictures in Wax or Clay; that by
the rosting therof, the persons wherof
they beare the name, may continually
melt & dry away by sickenes:
And this, in a blasphemous imitation of
the diuine power (who vsed such means
to accomplish his miracles,) the better
to colour his diuelish cōueiances,
which vsually are these.
                        1 To make men and women loue and
hate one another: a matter possible for
him to doe, by perswading the corrupt
affections.
                        2 To lay the sickenesse of one vpon another,
as vpon Iob,
                           Iob. 1. yea to take away life,
&c. by such Pictures, though they
are no cause thereof. It being easie
for Satan, being a spirit, to weaken
and scatter the spirits of life,Note. whereby
through faintnesse the party shall

sweate out naturall moisture. And
so also by weakening the spirits, the
stomacke shalbe weakened: whereby
not being able to breed new nourishment,
the old must needs in short
time be spent.
                        3 He can raise tempests, as hath
beene proued before: and,
                        4 So to breed madnesse, and,
                        5 To haunt men and places with
spirits, and so by a kinde of obsession
to vexe and torment them.
                        6 Yea, he can hinder the operations
of nature, and so may be a means
to hinder copulation, and so procreation,
and that not onely in general:
1 As corrupting naturall heate, that
the generating member may not execute
accordingly.
                        2 That though it should pierce
into the wombe, yet the seede being
colde, may take no effect.
                        
                        Or else, he may steale away the seed,
that it shal not passe into the womb.
                        But particularly also, though the
party may haue ability to others, yet
to serue one, for the like reasons, he

may be impotent, not able to performe
the worke of Generation,Note. and
so deny that duety of marriage, and
so happily produce a nullity thereof;
vnlesse by Phisicke, or some spirituall
means his power may be ouerruled,
for which some time is to be graunted,
and meanes vsed.
                        7 Lastly,Possession it cannot be denyed,
howsoeuer the world wold obscure
the worke of God herein: that euen
by the meanes of witch-craft, Sathan
may be sent euen into bodies of men, really
to possesse them. As of olde it was
vsuall in the Primitiue Church, and
the like punishment continuing for
sinne, the like meanes remayning to
remoue the scourge. I see not but
now it is vsuall in these later times;
as hath appeared euidently by many
instances: the Papists themselues acknowledging
as much, and the Gospel
herein powerful! to confound Poperie,
and to iustifie the truth hereof.
                        
                     
                     
                        
                        SECTIO VII.
                        
                           Of Sathans Policies in the execution
of this Power.
                        
                        ANd first, that he vseth Naturall
medicines,
                           Of naturall medicines. both for helping, and
hurting, giuing the Badde Witches
secret powders, and poysons to doe
mischiefe withall, and directing his
White Diuells (I meane the Blessers)
to salues and such like medicines, to
helpe their Patients withall.
                        This he doth,
                        Partly, to make the Blesser beleeue
that it is not Sathans power,
                           Sathans policie heerein. but rather
some vertue in these things, that
accomplish such rare euents, and
that so they may be more secure, and
forget the couenant, and thereby accomplish
their mischiefes with more
delight, and greedinesse.
                        Partly also, to deceiue such as
seeke vnto the Witches. And that by
securing them in the lawfulnesse of

this businesse, seeing they receiue
nothing but lawfull meanes.
                        2 By causing them to put confidence
in the meanes: seeing through
their infidelitie, they proue vsually
effectuall.
                        3 Thereby to deiect them from
lawfull meanes, as Phisicke, &c.
                        4 And so to nourish them in blasphemie,
contempt of God, and all
diuine assistance, to abolish all trust
in GOD, and dependancie vppon
him.
                     
                     
                        SECTIO VIII.
                        
                           He vseth also Prayers for the helping of
diseases.
                        
                        ANd this,Of praiers as to colour the secret
compact more dangerously:
So,
                        To countenance the vaine bablings,
and repetitions of profane and ignorant
persons.
                        As also to shew his high malice,
                           
and derision of these diuine ordinances:
and so also,
                        To mocke and confound the lip-labor,
and bodily seruice of the carnal christian.
                        And so, to inferre, that all second
meanes, as Phisicke, &c. are needlesse,
and vnprofitable, seeing it may bee
done by good prayers: and this is a
maine Ground in the ignorant people,Note.
to reiect all lawfull helps: hence
that speech of theirs; God hath sent
it, and he can take it away. Wherein
Satans meaning is, to aduaunce himselfe
in their hearts, to draw them to
his deuotiō, by the vse of such praiers,
&c. as being pretended to be from
God, are therefore, in this respect,
more greedily intertained.
                        Especially heerein to coosin the
Blesser the more desperately,Note. eyther
by prouoking her to robbe GOD of
his glorie, and so to ascribe these
Prayers vnto Sathan, conceiting
heereby some Diuine power, not
so much in Sathan, who instructs
her, as, in her selfe, that by these

meanes is able to doe such wonderfull
things; especially seeing, to the
doing thereof, a more strong and certaine
Faith is arrogated. As being
yeelded for the reason, why the Blesser
can doe that by prayer, which another,
vsing the same prayer, cannot doe,
because he cannot beleeue. And so by
this presumption of Faith, deluding her
in the safetie of her estate, that shee
is at least in high fauour with God,
in no danger of damnation, whereby
she is confirmed in her Practise, and so
makes sure her condemnation.
                        
                     
                     
                        SECTIO. IX.
                        
                           ¶Satan shrowds his power Vnder
naturall diseases.
                        
                        ANd doth not Satan also shrowd
his power sometimes verie cunningly
and dangerously vnder naturall
diseases. As both, being able to
iudge of the nature and criseis of them,
and so to adioine his power thereto,

to the hastening of death, by preuenting
the helpe of Physicke, or infatuating
the same.
                        As also hereby, being able to
assimilate his malicious and desperate afflictions
of the bodies and soules of
men,Note. to some such like naturall diseases,
that so his power may bee
shrowded vnder Natures distempers.
                        Certainely, Experience makes this
manifest vnto vs, And the Policie of Satan
herein is manifold.
                        
                        And that first to hide his owne secret
compact vnder such naturall infirmitie,Note Satans policy heerein.
that so he may both deceiue the
Witch, as imagining, that by her naturall
medicines she cures only a naturall
disease, and so, that her compact
with Satan was either conceited
onely, or else is now dissolued.
But especially, that he may deceiue others
hereby;
                           Note. and that both the parties afflicted;
as detayning them by this
meanes from the searching of their
hearts, and yeelding themselues vnder
the mightie hand of God, by vnfained

repentance, laboring to make
peace with him, that so they may
be soundly cured: and so sending
onely to naturall meanes, as if it were
but some ordinarie and common
infirmitie, incident to nature: and
so, if it be cured by such meanes, (as
many times the Lord giues successe
to the meanes to punish our security,
and satisfie carnall wisedome) then
Satans power is lesse feared, lesse regarded,
whereby he preuailes yet further
on the soule, by nouzeling it in
selfe-conceit of the goodnesse of it
estate, and so the meanes are aduanced,
Gods holy, and ouer-ruling
hand abased, and reiected: And the
Witch set in the place of God, and so
heereby she preuailes more fearefully:
not onely in the hearts of those
that are holpen, to put confidence
in her, but in others also, who are
desirous to bee holpen at so easie a
rate.
                        And so the skilfull Physition (That
Ordinance of God appointed hereto)
is neglected and despised;Note. and so in

the issue, the whole glorie and Crowne
redounds to the Diuell: His power
is aduanced, his kingdome enlarged,
the Gospell and Scepter of Iesus
Christ condemned or neglected,
and Atheisme, yea grosse Idolatrie, encreased
and confirmed.
                        But if these seeming naturall diseases
be not cured by these meanes;Note this.
yet the Credit of the Witch, and Satans
in her, is yet notwithstanding
saued.
                        1. Either, they sought too late.
                        
                        2. Or, else they did not apply the
medicine well.
                        
                        3. Or, else they did not beleeue it
could doe good.
                        4. Or, it hath holpen manie others.
                        
                        5. Or, yet it may doe good: And
therefore seeke for more: Goe to
some other Blesser, that hath better
skill: Make peace, with more confidence.
                        6. Or now, goe to the Physitian at
last, to consume their estate, and so
breed discontent and despaire.
                        
                           
7. Or, languish in despaire, seeing
God is forsaken, or sought too late
vnto.
                        And so Satan triumphes in his
spoyles,Vses. confounds the vnbeleeuing
generation,1. Satans Triumph. that liues securely,
notwithstanding such a Messenger
from Hell, might rowse it out,

                        Of the detection of Witches, and meanes
thereto.
                     
                     
                        OF the detection and punishment of
Witches: That they are to bee
punished with death, especially the
Blesser and good Witch, as they terme
her.
                     
                        SECT. I.
                        
                           Of vnlawfull meanes of detection.
                        
                        HAuing discouered the power of
Witches, and so followed them
to the vtmost of their glorie and aduancement:
Seeing now Pride goeth
before destruction, and the glorie of the
wicked is their shame: Let vs now
consider of heir Fall and confusion,
and of such meanes as further the
same.
                        Wherein we may behold the admirable
wisedome and power of God,
                           Gods wisedom herein.
who as hee leaues them to their
owne lusts, to embrace Satan, and submit

vnto him, for the obtaining of
their desires; so hath hee so disposed
in his wonderfull Iustice, that the God
whom they worship, when he hath
them sure his owne, seeing he is
greedy of his Prey, and would gladly
haue other imployment to doe
more mischiefe, therefore he cares
not how soone the bargaine be performed,
and rather then faile, though
all other meanes of detection should
cease, himselfe will bee the instrument
to bring his Beare to the Stake: And
this he doth,
                        
                        By Being an instrument for the detection
of the Witch,
                           Satan the Authour of discouerie. and yet in such
dangerous policie, as that heerein also
he hunts after vnstable soules,
while he seekes to giue them content
in the discouerie of the Witch which
hath done them so much mischiefe.Note.
                        
                        To this is it, that he hath not onely
The Blesser readie to discouer and detect
the Bad Witch,
                           By vsing the Blesset to discouerie. that so he might
thereby encrease the poore peoples rage
against the Witch, whereas indeed they
should be angry at their sins.
                        
                        
                           
But whereas in their affliction they
should seeke vnto the Lord that smites
them,Os. 6. 1. by this discouery of the Bad
Witch, he encreaseth the reputation of
the Blesser, and so prouoketh the
people more eagerly to runne after
her.
                        And now the Good Witch vttereth
easily all her deceitfull wares, to the
deluding of the parties that are thus
inquisitiue, and many times to the condemning
of innocent bloud.
                        
                        And to this purpose, because people
will bee loath to credit her word,
concerning the supposed harmer and
Bad Witch, therefore she hath vsually
either some glasse wherein to shew
the partie offending: or else hath
certaine deceitfull and Satanicall experiments,
to confirme her former detection
of the Witch; As namely, by
casting her into the water, sticking of
needles, or bodkins, vnder the stoole
where she sits, burning of the thing bewitched,
&c. By which, either she confirmes
the superstitious people in a
wrong conceit, it being easie for Satan

to further these signes heereto;
or if they conceiue aright, yet by
vsing these indirect meanes for discouerie,
they shall yet deeplier engage
their soules vnto the power and malice
of Satan.
                        And therefore though the Bad
Witch may bee detected by these
meanes: yet neither is the wise Christian
to vse these meanes for the discouery
of this Monster; neither is the
Magistrate to admit of this detection, as
a sufficient euidence for the certaine
discerning and iudging of the Witch.
                        
                        It will then be demanded, What
detections and presumptions lawful wee
may haue to discouer a Witch?
                        
                        
                           To which wee answere, That as the
Lord hath ordained the Punishment
of these offenders, so no doubt hee
hath also disposed the meanes whereby
they may be detected, that so they
may be iustly punished.
                     
                     
                        
                        SECTIO. II.
                        
                           Of lawfull meanes of detection, And
I of Presumptions.
                        
                        THe meanes of these Detections are
Principally Two.
                           Of lawfull meanes of detection: and first of presumption.
                        
                        Examination, and Conuiction.
                        
                           Touching Examination; This is,
when the Magistrate makes enquiry
concerning this crime, and that not
vpon euery corrupt passion, or
sleight occasion, but vpon weightie
Presumptions, probably coniecturing
of the Witch.
                        These are:
                        1 Notorious defamation of this
crime, by the most of neighbours
which are of the best report.
                        2 The Accusation of a fellow Witch,
either at examination, or at the day
of death is not to bee neglected, because
now Authoritie hauing seized
on hit, though she may lie before she
be discouered, yet now hauing confessed
herselfe, she is an Instrument of
the Lords Iustice,
                           Note. 
                           to satisfie Authoritie,
and cleare the innocent, by speaking

truth, &c. (though otherwise shee
would not) to accuse the delinquent.
                        3 A third presumption is from the
effect of cursing: For when a bad tongued
woman shall curse a partie, and
death shortly follow, this is a shrewd
token that shee is a Witch, because
Witches are accustomed to execute
their mischeuous practises by cursing
and banning, & this may be sufficient
for examinatiō, thogh not of cōuiction.
                        
                        4 If after Enmity, quarreling, or
threatning, a present mischief do folow.
                        5 If the partie suspected be anie
kim, or of Special acquaintance with a cō
                              uicted
Witch, because it is the manner
of them to conuey their Trades and
Spirits one to another, and especially
to those that are nearest about, and
most familiar with them.
                        6 It is obserued, that the Witch receiues
som mark from Satan to owne
her by, in some priuy place, which is
vsually raw, whence the spirit draws
bloud, &c. and this, if there be no other
reason in Nature, is a shrewd
presumption, to examine at least.
                        
                           
7 And so if in examination wee
find the partie contrarie and in diuers
Tales: not onely Fearefull, for this may
be in a good case; but Doubtfull and
Different, this may bee a Presumption
to argue a guiltie conscience:
                        Thus of Presumptions.
                        2. Of Examination.
                        Now concerning Examination, this
may either be made by Question from
the Magistrate, by certaine wise and
crosse Interrogations to this end:
                        Or else by Torture, when together
with words, some violent meanes
are vsed, by paine, to extort confession,
which may haue necessarie place
when the partie is obstinate.
                        3 Of Conuiction.
                        Hauing vsed the best meanes by
Examination, the next is Conuiction,
whereby after iust examination, the
Witch is discouered; To this must
concurre, not bare presumptions, but
sufficient Proofes: Not such as heeretofore
haue beene reckoned, or like
to those; As scratching the suspected

party, &c. The confession of a partie dying,
that such a one hath bewitched
him. But for manifest conviction, these
Proofes are to be esteemed sufficient.
                        1 The Free confession of the crime
by the party suspected,
                           Proofes hereunto. after due examination,
being found in diuers tales.
                        I but say the Partie will not confesse,
Here then the testimonie of two sufficient
witnesses is currant, prouing one of
these two things: either,
                        That the party accused hath made
a league with Satan; or hath done
some knowne practise of Witch-craft,
producing likely arguments for the
confirmation thereof: As
                        1 That the Witch hath called vpon
the deuill for helpe.
                        
                        2 That she entertaines a familiar
spirit, and had conference with it in
any Forme, or likenesse.
                        3 That she hath shewed ones face in
a glasse being absent.
                        
                        4 That they haue fore-told things
to come.
                        
                        5 Holpen to things lost, whereof
they haue had no ordinary meanes

of knowledge.
                        6 That they haue healed by Prayers,
Spells, Amulets.
                        
                        And so, howsoeuer the League
with Satan be secret, and therefore not
able to be discouered, yet is both Satan
willing to haue it knowne by effects,
                           Note.
for the increase of his kingdom,
& hastning the cōfusion of his slaues,
and so by such like effects hee doth
discouer them: 1 To haue speedier
possession of them, lest afterward by
remorce they might bee brought to
repentance, 2 as hating so detestably
euen all mankinde, that he cannot endure
they should inioy the world, or
the benefits thereof, no not an houre:
3 but especially,Note Satans policie herein the Policie of Satan
in this discouerie is, 1 to satisfie
the rage of the people, who now hauing
found the Witch, instead of being auenged
of their sinnes, doe intend
nothing more then the satisfying of
their malice in destruction of the
Witch, 2 and so therein to procure credite
and estimation to the good Witch, to
make more worke for her, by whose

meanes, this enemy to mankind, this
badde Witch hath beene discouered.
                        And yet we may obserue the ouerruling
hand of God herein,
                           Gods ouer-ruling hand herein. that though
Satan do hasten the speedie discouerie
of the Witch: yet the Lord in his
holy wisedome, oft-times disposeth,
that such shall liue long, yea die vndetected:
Eyther because some of
them, may belong to the Election, and
therefore may repent of this great
sinne by holy meanes, and so bee
freed both from temporall and eternall
punishment.
                        Or some remaine longer vndisclosed,
to execute greater mischiefe in
the world: as they are more cruelly
bent thereto.
                        Or else, there may be some Couenant
with Sathan by the Wach for some
terme of yeares, which hee is contented
to binde himselfe to, to haue her
more sure, and secure thereby.
                        And thus of the proofes to discouer
the Witch, without which shee
may not safely be condemned.

                     HItherto of the meanes to Discouer
Witch-craft: Now let vs
consider of the meanes whereby we
may preuent, and be deliuered from the
same.
                     
                     
                        SECTIO I.
                        VVHEREVNTO,Authoritie of the magistrate. seeing
the Lord hath gratiously
afforded the blessing of Gouernement as
a speciall means to discouer witchcraft:
and so by cutting off the offender
by the Law, very mercifully also to
preuent the same. Therefore let vs
acknowledge vnfainedly the goodnesse
of God heerein. Pray we for the
Magistrate, that the Lord may giue
him a discerning spirit herein: and
yeeld we al conscionable obedience
to him vnder God, that for our sins
he may not be giuen vp to security &

such strong delusiōs, as either to neglect
the prosecuting of this sin, or to
iustifie the same.
                        Surely, as we haue great cause to
be thankefull to our God for that
which our Gracious Soueraigne hath
commended for the perpetuall good
of the Church to this end: so are we
also to blesse his Maiestie for that
further Courage and Conscience of
our true Christian and renowned King,
                           In Demonologia.
that hath also iustified the kingdome
of Christ against that vsurped Hierarchie
of the Roman Antichrist, being
that Arch-coniurer, & deceiuer of the
world: O how hath he bin displayed
and liuely painted out by the Pen
of a ready Writer! And shall not the
Lord preserue his Anoynted to burne
the whore with fire, and make her desolate?
O that the Lord would make
vs worthy of such a blessing, that our
eyes might beholde the fall of Antichrist!
That the Kingdome of Iesus
Christ may be set vp in full beautie,
that the First-borne may come in,
                           Iew.
and Iesus Christ may come to iudgement:

Euen so blessed Father, hasten
this thine eternall Word, and let all
the people say, Amen.
                        
                        Now let vs further consider of the
Remedies of Witch-craft.
                        
                        These consist eyther in preuenting
of the evils and dangers thereof, or,
                        In the Recouerie and Release from
the same.
                        That these may be preuented, it is
manifest:
                        First,That Sorcery may bee preuented. because otherwise, All should
be afflicted: For Sathan maliceth all,
would have none free, and therefore
the Lord that hindereth his malice
heerein, hath also ordayned meanes
heereunto.
                        Secondly, the very Witches themselues
haue confessed, that they could
not preuayle against some: And we
see (by Gods mercie) the most freed
from them.
                        What may be the meanes heereto?
                     
                     
                        
                        SECTIO. II.
                        
                           Of the particular Remedies against
Witch-craft.
                        
                        These are either,
                        1 Deceitfull and dangerous.
                        
                        And these are of two sorts.
                        1 Eyther such as seeme to helpe,
and yet doe nothing in truth.
                        2 Or else, if they yeelde helpe to the
bodie for the present.
                        1 They both leaue it hereafter to
further mischiefe.
                        2 And especially do hurt the soule,
both: first, for the present: but, 2
chiefly for the time to come.
                        
                        2 These Remedies are sincere and
safe. And these are Generall, or Particular.
                        
                        Naturall or Spirituall.
                        And these eyther,
                        Preseruatiue or Restoratiue:
                        Or, Priuate or Publike.
                        
                     
                     
                        
                        SECTIO III.
                        
                           PReseruatiue Remedies, are such,
whereby men are kept from the
power & hurts of Witches: and these
are such

                              1 As concerne the persons of men,
                              
                              2 Or, the places of their abode.
                              
                           
                        
                        1 To preserue the persons
                           Preseruatiues for persons. 
                           of men,
the chiefe & onely soueraigne means
is, that whereas by nature, wee are all
the Diuells slaues, led captiue by him
at his will, subiect to all sorts of his
delusions and torments, vpon anie
occasion: Therefore we would discerne
this naturall condition out of the
Word.
                        
                        2 Discerning of it, wee would not
rest therein: but rather be brought to
a deniall thereof, to renounce
                           How to renounce nature. the same
by true sorrow and repentance, and
so labour to attaine vnto the glorious
libertie of the Sonnes of God.
                        
                        And this, by embracing Iesus Christ,
                           How to be in Christ.
and so be partakers of the Couenant
of Grace, in his bloud, 1 by receiuing

the Gospell, 2 beleeuing the precious
promises therein contained,
3 applying the same to our particular
conditions, 4 and so returning
thankefulnesse vnto our GOD. For
these his rich mercies in the pardon
of our sinnes, by yeelding vp our soules
and bodies as a liuing sacrifice vnto our
God, in obedience to his blessed
will, euen with all sinceritie, and
readinesse of minde, and purpose of
heart, together with conformitie
of the outward man in our reasonable
seruice of God all the dayes of
our life.
                        As heereby, hauing the promise,
1 to be kept by the mighty power of
God to saluation, 2 to bee alwayes
within the speciall protection of the
Lord to bee kept in all our wayes:
3 To this end to haue the ministring
of the blessed Angells, to preserue vs
from the euill one, that there may no
Witch-craft preuayle against Iacob,
nor sorcery against Israel, otherwise
then before hath beene layd downe:
not that the Elect may be altogether

free from this affliction, but that it
shall turne to their good, their soules
shall be safe, and they are nothing so
often subiect thereto as the wicked
and reprobate.
                        And therefore, laboring to walke
honestly as in the presence of God;
remembring that his Angells attend
for our protection and comfort, and
so being carefull not to grieue those
heauenly souldiers, but to encourage
them in their watch and guard ouer
vs, 1. Corinthians chap. 11. and verse
10.
                        This soueraigne Remedie subordinates
also many speciall prouisoes and
caueats, according to our seuerall
occasions in the world: As next to
renue our right in Christ daily by vnfained
repentance. To arme our selues daily
by conscionable meditation in the
Word, and the prouidence of the Almighty
in the protection of his children,
Psal. 91. To feare our selues continually,
in respect of our owne worth
or sufficiencie, and so to renounce
carnall confidence, and policie, &c.

wholy to resigne vp our selues into
the sole protection of the Almighty.
To maintaine our Christian libertie and
humility with all wisedome, not being
seruants vnto men, but to bring
them to Christ, not to entangle our
selues with the world, though wee
must vse it: to auoide as much as may
be euen lawfull pleasures, and recreations,
especially, if they be doubtfull
& of euill report, as carding &c. wherin
vsually Satan hath a cast. To be choise
of our company, especially, of Papists,
profane persons, cursers, swearers, &c. because
by these instruments God tries
our sincerity, and Satan if we grow
indifferent, eyther prepareth to the
Trade, or preuayles to afflict vs by
them.
                        To be wise in our Liberalitie, and
Almesdeedes, not distributing to
each sort of poore, because many
times Witches go vnder this habite,
as being left to this miserie, for the
confusion of their conceited soueraignetie,
and prouocation of their
Enuie and Malice, to doe further

mischiefe: especially, to take heed if
any such suspected seeke vnto vs; to
bee straight-handed towards them,
not to entertaine them in our houses,
not to relieue them with our
morsels: Especially, if wee discerne
them as their nature and neede is, to
be free mouthed,
                           Note. and light fingered, to
craue of the best, and not to be satisfied,
and to be bold & impudent, &c.
                        And therefore heere it standeth vs
vpon to vse a Christian courage in all
our Actions, not to feare their curses,
nor seeke for their blessings, for after
these things do the Gentiles seeke,
&c.Iude 8. yet not with ratings or reuilings,
but, The Lord rebuke thee Sathan. If
wee do good to any, let it be especially
to the houshold of Faith: and so
to examine such of their beliefe,
                           Gala. 6. 10 of their
experimentall knowledge concerning saluation,
and so we may by Gods mercie,Witches will not indure this vsually. both preuent our selues from being
hurt by them, and happily discouer
them, and hasten their confusion.
                        And therefore if we haue got any
inkling of their leagues or spirites, or

                           prayers, &c. we are in no case to conceale
this,Be liable to his malice. lest wee bee confederate
with Satan: or at least, for our infidelitie,
and carnall wisedome, but
in the name of God let vs manifest
what wee know (if occasion serue)
to the Magistrate: especially if there
be any hurt done, wee are bound in
conscience to iustifie God; to bring
his Iudgements to light, to hasten
his enemies to their confusion, and
procure any lawful case to his poore
afflicted seruants.
                        Thus may we preserue our persons
from the malice of Sathans Instruments.
                     
                     
                        SECTIO IIII.
                        
                           Preseruatiues for houses.
                        
                        
                           COncerning our houses, because it
is the policie of Sathan to worke by
degrees, and so by shaking our faith,
and distracting, or hindering vs in
holy dueties, to disquiet or feare vs;
and thereby to worke vpon our Infidelities,
                           
and distempers, bringing
vs thereby to neglect of holy means,
and prouoking to impatiency, wherby
wee may giue the Lord occasion
to leaue vs to his snares: Therefore
hath he vsed to haunt and molest our
dwelling places, with Apparitions and
strange annoyances of noise &c.
                        And therefore it is very fit to preuent
him heerein by holy meanes.First by an holie dedication.
                        
                        And these are, First, the dedication
of our houses: and this is done,
                        1 Not onely by conscionable prayer
vnto God, when wee come vnto
them: 2 but also by solemne vowing
and consecrating them to the seruice of
God, as in the first epistle of Paul to
Timothy chap. 4. verse 5.
                        3 To make choice of our habitations
where wee may enioy the powerfull
ordinances of God. And,
                        4 If we come to any houses where
any monuments of Idolatrie haue remayned,
thence to remoue them.
                        
                        5 Yea, if (as the manner was in
Poperie) for the verie building of
their houses, to fashion them according

to the Idolatrous temples: If in
such cases we alter so much, as may
take away the resemblance of Sathans
Throne: I thinke it (sauing better
Iudgements) though for the publique,
in indifferent things, wee
are to leaue things to the Magistrate,
to bee ordered and disposed
of by him: yet in our priuate affaires,
where wee haue power in
our hands, I say, I thinke it may
stand with Christian wisedome and
courage.
                        6 But howsoeuer, wee may not
be ouer-curious in these things, I doe
speake as a foole: I take it, nay, I
dare auouch (by the grace of Almightie
God) that wee shall vndoubtedly
much sanctifie them by holie
order, and discipline in the Familie,
by holie Exercises of Prayer
and Meditation in the Word, catechizing
of the Families, purging out
incarnate diuells thence, I meane
prophane and rebellious seruants,
Psalme 101. that hate to be reprooued,
not buying their seruice so

deare, as to giue them libertie to
profane the Sabaoths, to let them liue
in ignorance, profanenesse, &c. lest
for these things the wrath of GOD
come vppon vs, and the Lord leaue
vs to be afflicted by euill Angells.
                        This in generall hath beene the
practise of the Saints, and out of the
particulars of their practise these particulars
may be auouched, as Deuter.
20. 5. Wee haue runne for the dedication
of the house, wherein was acknowledged,
that wee receiued it as
the free gift of God: not that great
Babel which we haue builded for the
honour of our name, Dan. 4. Psalme
49. &c. But that which God of his
mercie hath giuen vnto vs, 1. Chron.
29. and therefore we should giue it
vnto him againe, in consecrating it
to his seruice. Examples we haue of
Abraham building an altar where hee
dwelt, to worship God, Genes. 12. 8.
of Noah when hee came out of the
Arke to inhabite the earth, that great
possession which then the Lord restored,
and enfranchised him withaall,

                           Genes. 8. 20. of Iacob, when hee
came to Bethel, which he consecrates
as an house vnto God, though otherwise
it was the house of his habitation.
                        
                        So did Hezekiah sanctifie the people,
when they came to receiue the
Passeouer, fearing lest they had not
glorified him in their families and
habitations, 2. Chron. 31.
                        So did Iacob purge his familie of
Idolatrie, casting out all the Idolls
of his wife Rebecca, &c. Genesis chap.
35. vers. 1. 2.
                        Thus of the remedies preseruatiue.

                           Restoratiue Remedies generall.
                        
                        NOw the Restoratiue means follow,
and these are either 1 Generall
concerning whole Countries.
                        
                        Or else, Speciall, respecting particular
persons.
                        
                        The Generall remedies to dissolue the
workes of Sathan are.
                        
                        
                           
1 The free libertie of the Gospell,
Luke 10. v. 18. Sathan like Lightning
falles downe thereat: So doth Moses
to this end commend the reuerend
and obedient hearing of the Lords
Prophets, Deut. 8. 18.
                        2 Conscionable execution of Iustice,
against all other offenders, but especially
against these, and among
these against the Good Witch: she is
the meanes of encreasing the other:
and yet it is lamentable to obserue,
that the Good Witch is spared, and accepted
vsually of all, because shee
helpeth at a pinch, holdeth life and
present hopes, though the Badde
Witch now and then, because wee
would not loose our present happinesse,
we cannot endure afflictions,
is haled to iudgement.
                        Thus of Generall Restoratiues.
                        
                     
                     
                        
                        SECTIO VI.
                        
                           Particular follow for priuate persons.
                        
                        THough not absolute and necessarily
effectuall, as was the gift
of casting out of Diuells which ceased
with the Apostles and Prime
Churches: yet profitable and conuenient
to be vsed, euen vnto the
worlds end of all Christians, very
comfortable in the issue and successe
thereof.
                        These are,
                        1 To search out the true cause of
this affliction, namely their sinnes,
Lam. 3. 39. 40. 1. Sam. 5. 15.
                        2 To approoue our faith in the
free mercie of God by heartie Prayer
and Fasting, for pardon especially
of sinne, and remouall of the affliction,
as may stand with Gods glorie,
submitting heerein to the will
of God, 1. Sam. 16.
                        
                           
3 Submitting patiently to the affliction,
and comforting our selues
with the speciall protection of our
God, and faithfull promise that this
shall turne to our good, assuring our
selues that the Lord wil not suffer vs
to bee tempted aboue our strength,
but wil grant in his good time a ioyfull
issue: not measuring our estate
in Gods fauor simply by the successe
heerein, much lesse by the affliction
it selfe, which is common to all, but
resoluing, though hee kill vs, yet to
trust in him, and trying our selues
by the different bearing and qualifying
of the affliction that it hath
                        1 More weaned vs from the
world:

                        Of False Remedies.
                     
                     SHall wee now take some view of
the False and superstitious Remedies,
vsed by the Genttles, and encreased by
the Papists, to release and preuent these
mischiefes?
                     Surely, neuer more need to display
and confound these practises,
and yet to name them, is sufficient to
confute them:Apostolike power herein.
                     
                     Which are they?
                     Examine we the Foundation.
                     
                     First, in Imitation of Apostolike callings,
there is also presumed Apostolike
power, to worke miracles, to cast out
diuels, and so by a miraculous gift, to
heale such mischiefes as do proceede
from Witches.
                     
                     Vnto which we reply,
                        Refuted, that that extraordinarie
calling ceasing, the effect
ceaseth withall:
                     As 1 being not necessary for these
Times, seeing they were ordayned

onely for the Confirmation of the Doctrine
of the Gospel, newly planted and
to bee rooted in the hearts of Infidels,
or to bee iustified thereby against
their forged miracles; which
being now approoued and acknowledged
of the Christian Churches,
and hauing a constant and ordinary
Ordinance of the Word, to instruct
the same sufficiently.
                     There is no neede of such extraordinary
Signes, so witnesseth the Spirit,
1. Cor. 14. 28. That change of tongs,
and some generall Miracles, are for a
Signe not to them that beleeue, but to
them which beleeue not: as if the holy
Ghost should say, that the Gospel in
the first preaching thereof, was accompained
with strange and miraculous operations,
as a Signe to manifest the
power thereof to the confusion of all
the fayned miracles of the Gentiles,
wherein they vaunting, might bee
detained from embracing the glorious
Gospel of Iesus Christ, as being
offered to the world without Efficacie,
from base and contemptible

meanes: but that the power of the
Lord being manifest in the weakenesse
of his seruants by these miraculous
operations, as it was sufficient
to make knowne vnto them, that
the Gospel was nothing inferiour to
the Oracles of the Deuil, seeing it was
honoured with such excellent and
supernaturall workes: so by the inward
working thereof in their conscience,
in discouering the secretes of
their hearts, and meeting with their
hidden, false and secret corruptions,
which of all others was the greatest
Miracle:
                     
                     It might thereby gaine the true Esteeme
among them, that GOD was
in, and with the meanes: 1. Cor. 14. 25.
26. and thereby might prooue effectuall
to conuert the vnbeleeuing,
as the Lord had ordained him vnto saluation.
Actes Chap. 13. Verse 46,
47, &c.
                     Secondly,2 Reason. As it is not necessarie
that these giftes should nowe remaine:
so if they did remaine, they
might then challendge the effectualnesse

of the Apostles preaching, as if that
the Gospel were not sufficiently confirmed
by them, seeing still it needs
to be confirmed by miracles.
                     3 And seeing the Promise and the
Gift goe together,3 Reason. therefore, in that
the Promise was onely made to the
Apostles, concerning those times, to
doe those things, and not to the generations
of the churches succeeding;
therfore seeing the Promise was only
in force vnto them,Marke 16. it followeth also
necessarily, that the gift was limited
accordingly.
                     And therefore, though it be pretended,
that the Church of the Iewes
                        1. Obiection from the lewes answered.
had this power, and why not then
the Church of the Gentils, vnder Christ,
seeing Christ was nothing inferiour
to Moses? yet seeing no certainetie
can be gathered out of the Word, of any
such Iewish power, but that rather
they are condemned heerein, as doing
it by the helpe of Sathan, and so our
Sauiour in that reply, driues out one
naile with another; and when they
accused him to cast out Diuells,Mat. 12. 27 by

helpe of Beelzebub, returnes it vpon
them, By whom then doe your children
cast them out? As if he had said, Cast
the Beame out of your owne eyes. It is
you that cast out diuells by the help
of Beelzebub, and would you excuse
your selues by condemning of me? or
do you measure me by them? Therefore
they shall be your Iudges,
                        Acts 19. 13 they shall
iustifie mee whom you condemne,
their maister hath acknowledged me
to be the Sonne of God, though they
worke by Satan, and therefore shall
rise vp in iudgement against you,
that condemne me to worke by Sathan,
who by them hath iustified me,
to be the mightie power of God.
                     
                     As for that they alleadge,Obiection from the Promise answered. That
such tokens shall follow them that beleeue:
In my name they shall cast out diuels, &c.
Marke 16. 17. This is to be vnderstood
concerning the church immediatly
after Christ, to be fulfilled onelie
vnto them, and their immediate Successours;
for some short time, so long
as the Church continued vnder Heathen
Gouernors and Persecutors, which

were to bee conuinced and bridled
by these mightie workes.3 Obiection from experience answered. And therefore,
though in all Ages of the Church,
there haue appeared alwayes some,
that haue cast out deuils; yet hath this
beene, not by the Power of God, which
ceased in the decay of zeale and synceritie,
with the Primitiues; but by
the Power of Delusion, through the efficacy
of Satan,
                        2. Thess. 2. 9. whereby Antichrist then
rising, and aduancing himselfe in the
heartes of Gods people, as being giuen
vp thereto for their disobedience to the
Gospel, by meanes of these fained and
diuellish wonders, confirmed in the
hearts of the vnstable people,Colloss. 2. 23. his voluntary
Worship,
                        1. Tim. 4 2. and Doctrine of Diuels▪
                        
and so enabled himselfe thereby aboue all
that is called God.
                     
                     And that these are but lying wonders
and deceiuable may appeare
yet further by the meanes whereby
they are wrought.
                     The first whereof, Is the Name of
Iesus,
                        2 Proued false by the means imployed in them. by the vertue whereof the Diuell
is pretended to giue place, and
against his will to bee thrust out of

possession. Wherein, though wee
denie not,Note. that it is lawfull to call
vpon The Name of Iesus in Prayer,
                        An Obiection answered.
for the deliuerance of any, that are
possessed, and bewitched, yet that
wee may presume, that our prayer
shall take effect, otherwise then
may stand with GODS glorie,
and the good of the Church: this
is contrarie to the Nature of the
thing wee pray for, which being
a Temporall, ought to be begged,
but with Condition onely, if God
will, as may stand with his glorie,
as in the sixe and twentie chapter of
Saint Mathews Gospell: and also,
contrarie to our duetie and allegeance,
which doe pray, That the will of
GOD may bee done in all things,
that our wills may be subiect vnto
his.
                     And seeing the Pupists wil haue this
Name of Iesus effectuall,
                        Note▪
                         not so much,The error of Papists.
because it is inuocated by a Beleeuer,
hauing Faith and vnderstanding to
call on GOD aright; As onely,
by the very Name vttered in so many

                        letters and syllables; though without
Faith, yea without Vnderstanding,
which by vertue heereof, shall bee
able, being repeated, to cast out
Sathan without exception or resistance.
This certainely can bee no
Miracle, but a Satanicall delusion.
                     
                     1 Because the Name of Christ, thus
barely pronounced without faith
and vnderstanding, hath no warrant
from the Word.
                     
                     2 Neither doth it allow vnto any
ordinarie Christian any such speciall
calling heereunto.
                     
                     3 Nay, it is flat contrary to the nature
of the Word, which is onely effectuall,
not when it is spoken, and
barely pronounced, but when it is
vnderstood and beleeued both of the
Deliuerer, and the Receiuer also, as
that and other like Scriptures are to
be vnderstood, Philip. chap. 2. vers. 10.
Hebr. 4. 2.
                     Much like may be answered concerning
the reliques of Saints:
                        Reliques of Saints reiected. another
Remedie which they haue, to cast out
diuells. For howsoeuer they alledge,

that a dead man was raised at the Graue
of Elizeus,
                        2. Reg. 13. 21. that Peters shadow and
Pauls handcherchiefs did many strange
things: yet doth not this proue, that
their Reliques may doe the like.Act. 19. 21.
                     
                     First because the times are now different,
                        Act. 5. 15.
there is no need of such meanes,
as was in those dayes.
                     Secondly, The Gift is therefore ceased,
as seruing for necessary times,
and the Reliques, are for the most
part counterfait, and therefore they
can produce but counterfait Miracles.
                     
                     Touching the Signe of the Crosse,
                        Signe of the Crosse disclaimed herein,
howsoeuer this bee applyed to cure
in these cases;
                     Yet, this is blasphemous impietie, to
ascribe to the Creature, what is proper
to the Creator. Namely to doe
Miracles.
                     Neither the Apostles, nor the Sonne
of Man himselfe, his Godhead being
set apart, beeing able to doe these
things, but onely the Finger of GOD.
Exod. 8. Matth. 12.
                     As for the vse of Holy water, Graines,
Salt, Images, Agnus Dei, &c. To this

purpose the Truth is,Other Remedies reiected, as Holy Water, Graines, &c. these are prophane
superstitions, because they are
not sanctified by the Word, to that
end: That which Elisha did by casting
in Salt, being not from the
vertue of the Salt, which was not hallowed
but by an extraordinary calling,
and gift enabling there vnto.
                     Lastly,Exorcisme refuted. whereas also it was ordinary
among the Papists, to vse Exorcismes
to this end; Namely, to adiure
and command the Diuell in the Name of
God, to goe from the Partie. This is
now ceased, because the Gift of Miracles,
as also the promise annexed
to the Gift is ceased withall.
                     For the better vnderstanding hereof
obserue wee farther herein; That
howsoeuer by these deceitfull Remedies
afflicted parties seeme to be
relieued, and deliuered from Satans
power: yet indeede it is nothing so.
                     This appeareth:
                     Because, though the torments may
cease, yet the Diuell leaueth not the
Parties, but onely ceaseth for a time
willingly, to establish men in Errour,

and in worshipping of himselfe, and
so entreth deeper into them.
                     And this is the Effect of all such
Remedies as are procured by Coniuration,
and the Charmes and spels thereof:
wherby though the Diuel seeme to
be bound from hurting, yet the party
thereby indeed is more bound to his
power & malice, & though he seeme
by the vertue of such holy Names of Iesus,
&c. to be cast out, yet doth he only
cease to afflict the bodie for a time, that
so he may procure greater confidence in
this his Trade: And thereby take
possession both of body and soule.
                     
                     It may bee heere then demaunded,Quaere.
Whether seeking acquaintance
with the Witch,
                        Concerning the releeuing of witches. and vsing of her to
our houses bee daungerous, and
whither (I say) It bee lawfull to relieue
them, or no: If wee suspect
them to bee such, seeing it is conceiued
that they haue power ouer vs by
the same?
                     
                        To which wee answere, that in our
Beliefe we are first bound by the Law
of GOD to doe good to the Houshold of
                        
Faith,Esay. 58. 
                        Gal. 6. 10. and so after these, to
relieue where there is most corporall
need, As for the releiuing of these
Witches, seeing suspition may deceine:
therefore we may not simply neglect
these, If they be onely suspected; so
wee doe it from a good ground:
Namely, obedience to Gods Commandement;
and a compassion to them, especially
to doe their soules good:
Adioyning some spirituall Exhortation
withall, to instruct them if they bee
ignorant, to deterre them from such
damnable and odious courses. Auoiding
wisely
                     Vaine glory to bee seene of men,
as Matth. 6. 5, 6, 7. Especially taking
heed, that we relieue them not, as the
Gentiles were woont to worshippe
their gods;Tull. Ne noceant. that they may not hurt vs,
in carnal policy, seeking to bind thē
to vs: as knowing that Feare in this
case, as it may giue iust cause to the Lord,
to leaue vs into their hands, for the punishment
of our infidelitie: so if our
bodyes escape, yet a worse thing
may certainely follow; Namely, the

stealing away of your heartes from God
by this meanes, and so the enthralling
of our soules vnder the power
of Satan.
                     And being wise also, in the manner
of our reliefe, whereby we may
happily try them:
                     
                     1. Namely to giue them onely for
necessitie, of the meanest, seeing these
being puffed vp with their consorted
powers,Note. thinke nothing to good
for them. As I haue obserued, they
must fare of the best, &c,
                     2. And to keepe our selues within the
bounds of mans authoritie, to see them releiued
at their houses, and that by setting
them a worke, and so paying
them an ouer-plus for it, that they
may prouide for themselues: For
hereby happily you may also discerne
thē, As being an idle & vagrant generatiō,
alwaies gadding: their own
house is a Wild-cat, they must needs
be stirring whom the Diuel driues.
                     3. And lastly, to relieue their bodyes
as vpon any iust occasion not to conceale
their wretchednesse, but to accuse

and draw them to the Iudgement Seates,
for the saluation (if it may bee) of
their poore soules.
                     And though Iudgement may sease
vpon them: yet so long as they liue
they may be relieued, onely with the
coursest, and that for necessitie, especially
heere an Interpreter, one of a
thousand prooue their best Purueyor
to minister a word in due season, for
the comfort of the soule.

                        Of a Principall Remedie against Witchcraft:
Namely, the due Execution of
Iustice vpon the Offenders.
                     
                     THus haue we shewed both what
deceitfull and daungerous Remedies
haue and may be vsed, to ease this affliction.
                     As also what Lawfull Remedies are
to be applyed hereto.
                     It now remaineth, that wee adioyne
A speciall publicke Remedie, for
the preuenting and rooting out of

this mischiefe; Namely, Execution of
Iustice.
                     
                     And here first, Let vs determine,
what measure of punishment is due to
this Sinne.
                     
                     Secondly, we wil adde some Motiues
to encourage the godly Magistrate,
to the Execution of the Punishment.
                     
                        SECT. I.
                        
                           Of the punishment of Witches with
death. What Punishment is due to Witchcraft.
                        
                        
                           The Word of GOD doth clearely
prooue, That thou shalt not suffer a
Witch to liue. Exod. 21. 18.
                        And so the practise of Holy men, hath
been agreeable thereunto in the due
Execution of this sentence against
them in all ages. As appeareth:
                        Not onely among the Heathen,
who euen by the Light of Nature
were endued for the very safety of
Life, to punish this Sinne with
Death.
                        
                           
But especially among Christians
where generally such Malefactors are
condignely punished.
                        And that this practice ought to stand
in force,
                           Prooued. appeareth.
                        1. Because, this being a Iudiciall
Law whose penaltie is death, seeing
they haue in them a perpetuall equitie,
and doe seeme to maintaine some
morall precept, is Perpetuall: As seruing
to maintaine the Equitie of the
three first Morall Precepts of the first
Table; which cannot be kept, vnlesse
this Law be put in execution.
                        2. This Iudiciall Lawe, hath in
it the Equitie of the Lawe of Nature,
and therefore is perpetuall: It
beeing naturall that an Enemie to
the State, a Traitour, &c. Should
die the death.
                        And such is a Witch, vnto God, the
King of Kings.
                        
                        3. The Witch is an Idolater, wilfully
and in a most presumptuous
maner, as renouncing God willingly,
and chosing Satan to bee her Soueraigne
Lord, therefore according to

that Lawe, shee is to be stoned to death,
Deut. 17. 3. 4. 5.
                        4 The Witch is a seducer of others to
Idolatrie, as appeareth by their common
practise both vpon their friends
to whom they vsually bequeath their spirits,
and vppon all whom they instruct,
to rest in charmes, &c. And
therefore to be put to death, Deuter.
13. 6. 9.
                        5 Nay, shee is a murtherer both of
soules and bodies; and therefore, in this
respect, doth also deserue death.
                     
                     
                        SECTIO. II.
                        
                           Answer to Obiections against this
Execution.
                        
                        1 ANd therefore, though the diuell
doe the mischiefe, yet is
the Witch confederate and accessarie
thereto: nay (in her owne conceit)
Principall and Mistris: and therefore
by the Lawe of Accessories, is to die
the death.
                        
                           
2 Therefore, though they should
repent, yet die they must, to iustifie
God, and preuent further ensnaring:
that though their body perish, yet
the soule may be saued, 1. Cor. 5.
                        3 Though she repent not, yet seeing
shee must haue some time of repentance;
though she do not, yet is Iustice
to proceede without respect of
persons. In zeale to Gods glory, and
loue of sinceritie, so Moses, Exo. 32.
28. and Phinehas, &c. Num. 25. 8.
                        And this sincerity of Iustice doth
require: That though death and such
hurts ensue not,
                           Note. yet for the offence
done to God, in combining with Sathan,
&c. the parties are to be executed
accordingly. For so the word
doth plainely imply: and heretofore
the Law hath been defectiue in this
case:Mans Law reformed herein. Anno 1. Iacobi
                            yet blessed be God, for a further
perfection heerein: and will not the
Lord daily perfect his worke? If wee
beleeue, shall wee not see greater things
then these? Well,
                        
                        1 Let this instruct the godly magistrate
to haue an eie, especially to

the Blesser, that raigneth among vs:
And to draw the people to the true
and lawfull meanes of helping soule
and bodie, by rooting out of these
Good Witches, which are rife almost
in euerie parish, and placing in stead
thereof a conscionable Minister, as that
the people may require the Lawe at
his mouth, that he may pray to the
Lord for them, that they may bee
healed.
                        2 Let this teach him to punish
sinne, of conscience, not for by respects,
meeting with the Witch, as
an Idolator offending against God, not
so much as a murtherer sinning against
man.
                        3 Let his owne safetie mooue him
heereunto, who as hee hath beene,
euen so still by the execution of Iustice,
may be free from these Monsters.
                        4 And lastly, Let the glorie of God
(in aduauncing the Gospel) especially
heere preuayle, which is by no kind
of thing more vndermined then by
Witches.
                        
                        
                           
Is glorious in nothing more then
in rooting out Antichrist the great
Coniurer and deceiuer of Gods people,
and banishing superstition
the very bedde and
nursery of witch-craft.

                        First, it serueth for reproofe, and
that many wayes.
                     
                     
                        SECTIO I.
                        
                           As first of the Atheisme, and Irreligion
that ouerflowes in the Land.
                        
                        
                           DOth not Satans Policy
in this trade of Witch-craft,
                           First the Atheist.
pretending to
afflict and hurt, but,
when he is seene by the

                           Witch: and then to hurt only the bodie,
or goods; Plainely obscure and abolish
out of the minds of men, the Prouidence
of the Almightie, as if Satan
were not subiect to God, and sent
by his prouidence, that he were not
countermaunded by the power of
God, but onely subiect to the Witches
power? Doth not this exalt her
in the place of God, prouoke the people
to feare and loue her, &c?
                        2 And seeing the hurt appeareth
onely by his cunning to be done to
the bodie, doth not this nourish the
people in this Atheisme, that either
their soules are in no danger, all is
well with them, or they neede not
trouble themselues thereabout, seeing
the diuel doth not trouble them?
nay, doth not this nourish this conceit
in their mindes, that they haue no
soules, or else, that they are mortall?
they end with this life, and therefore
vse all meanes for the maintenance
hereof, and then care is taken sufficiently.
                        3 Doth not this conuince the Atheist

that dreames of Generall Grace;
                        
                        
                           All shall be saued; seeing by this
Doctrine and Practise of Witch-craft:
It is now apparant, That not onely
naturally we are the bondslaues of Satan,
but that many purposely yeelde vp
themselues to his cursed will, renounce
their saluation, to become
his slaues, binde themselues to eternall
damnation, and so are made ofttimes
fearefull spectacles of the Diuine
vengeance, being carried away
by the diuell, and haled violently to
destruction?
                        4 Doth not this iustly confound
that, common delusion, That there is
no hell, but to be in debt, in prison? &c.
                        
                        Doth not this conuince such as
liue in that profane and fearefull manner,
as if there were no God to Iudge them,
no diuell to torment them? Do not
their desperate courses plainely discouer
to whom they doe belong?
Are they not of their father the Diuell,
because his workes they doe, are
they not running headlong to Hell,
by their desperate impenitencie?

doth their damnation sleepe, that so
turne the grace of God into wantonnesse?
Hath not the god of this world
blinded them, that they cannot obey the
truth? Are they not appoynted to perdition
that thus crucifie the Lord of life?
Is there any more sacrifice left for
sinne for such, but euen violent fire
to consume the aduersaries? Herbrews
cha. 10. 26. 27. Iude verse 4. Iohn chap.
8. 44.
                     
                     
                        SECTIO VIII.
                        
                           It is a plaine conuiction of the contempt
of the Word.
                        
                        FOr as the Lord, when Pharaoh
would not beleeue his seruant Moses,
did therefore giue him vp to be
deluded by his Sorcerers and Enchanters,
who dooing such wonders in
shew, as Moses did in trueth, did
thereby harden Pharaohs heart, and
so ripened his sinne and iniquity: euen
so it is iust with God, because

we despise his Word, and contemne his
true Prophets: therefore to leaue the
common people generally to bee
hardned by such fained wonders as
the prophets of Sathan make shew of
in the world, that they might bee
effectuall, to encrease transgressions against
the Lord, and so to ripen them
to the day of vengeance.
                        Thus did the Lord giue vp Saul,
for his disobedience and contempt
of the Word, to seeke vnto Witchcraft,
1. Sam. 28.
                        Whereby hee ripened his sinne,
and drew on speedy vengeance vpon
himselfe, and Gods People for
his sake, 2. Sam. 29.
                        Thus was Ahaziah left to seeke
helpe of the god of Ekron, that so he
might receiue of the Lord the Sentence
of his destruction, 2. Reg. 2.
                     
                     
                        
                        SECTIO. III.
                        
                           Of Reproofe.
                        
                        IT reprooueth the Idolatrie and false
worship of the Times, conuincing
the falshoode and abomination of Poperie,
and iustifying the truth and vertue of
the Gospel of Iesus Christ.
                        As that, first, where superstition
raignes, and is not yet weeded out,
there wee see Witch-craft to be magnified,
and so to abound as in the
Orcades among the Heathen.
                        But where the Gospel hath got footing,
                           Zach. 13. 3 4.
there all vncleane spirites depart,
grosse Witch-craft is banished, Authoritie
preuaileth, to the rooting out
thereof: the Word preuaileth to heale
our infidelitie, and so secure vs from
their dangerous snares.
                        And yet (which is to be lamented)
wee see the Good Witch still to
get ground, euen because she helpes,
and satisfies the flesh: doth not this argue
plainely, what God we worship

principally, euen our pleasure, our
riches, our health? Is not the Good
Witch respected, because she supplies
these? And is not our belly then our
god? the wedge of golde our hope? Doe
wee not for our owne sakes respect
the Blesser? Is it not a plaine worship,
yea Idolatrie which we commit
with her?
                     
                     
                        SECTIO IIII.
                        
                           It condemneth the grosse profanenesse
and disobedience of the Ages present.
                        
                        1 IN that the Infernall spirites are
more obseruant and diligent for
the hurt of the soule, then we are for
the saluation thereof: they are compassing
continually, omitting no
base offices to serue their Mistresse
turnes.
                        2 The aboundance of Witches, the
horrible sottishnesse and wilfulnesse
of the people which runne to these
Blessers, that are giuen vp by God the
Lord, to forsake the true meanes

of their saluation, and fly to diuellish
helpes: doth not this plainely argue
the general disobedience of the people;
and therefore, because they receiue
not the loue of the truth, therefore
God hath left them to these strong delusions,
to beleeue lies, as in the second epistle
of Saint Paul to the Thessalonians
in the second chapter and eleuen
verse.
                        Surely, as the Lord gaue vp Saul
to a spirite of Errour to bee tormented,
and mis-guyded thereby, because
hee forsooke the euerliuing
Lord, and disobeyed his Prophets:
So is it iust with Almightie GOD,
to giue vp the people to be besotted
with this iudgement, euen because
they haue detayned the trueth of
God in vnrighteousnesse, and reproached
the same by their profane
and most abhominable conuersation.
                     
                     
                        
                        SECTIO V.
                        
                           Reproofe of Hypocrisie.
                        
                        IT reprooueth the Hypocrisie and fearefull
Dissimulation that raignes euen among
professors.
                        And that first, as Sathan pretends
subiection to the Coniurer and Sorcerer,
when indeede his purpose is to bee
Maister of all: Euen so the Hypocrite,
how soeuer he pretend subiection to the
Lord, yet his purpose is to serue his
owne lusts, to aduaunce himselfe aboue
all that is called God, to bring men into
bondage, to smite them on the face, 2.
Cor. 11. 2. Thess. 2. 12.
                        2 As Satan pretends many things
to be done by the Witch, which indeede
are done by himselfe, that he
may bring the Witch into danger, abuse
others by her, and conceale his
wickednesse more cunningly: euen
so doth the Hypocrite father much
vpon God, which is but the deuice
of his owne braine.
                        
                           
And doth not this plainely conuince
the hypocrisie of the Times, that
whereas the Good Witch is farre more
dangerous then the Bad, yet because
the Blesser helpes, and serues turne, to
maintayne life; &c. therefore shee
must escape: whereas the Bad Witch,
because she is hurtfull, therefore she
must bee punished. Doth not this
argue, that not for conscience sake,
but for our owne respects Iustice is
executed, Sathans power is oppugned?
                        And doth not Sathan,Math. 23. when hee
pretends to doe most good, then doe
most hurt? surely so doth the hypocrite,
vnder colour of long prayers, deuoure
widowes houses; Euen as the Blesser,
vnder pretence of Good prayers, enthralleth
the soule, so doth the hypocrite,
by pretence of formall prayers
and bodily worship detaine men in wilworship,
and all profanenesse to the
ruine of soule and body.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. II.
                     
                        A second generall vse, is for Instruction,
That first wee would leaue to auoyd
the Causes of Witch-craft.

                              Which are
                              1. Ignoraunee.
                              2. Infidelitie.
                              3. Malice.
                              4. Coueto usnesse.
                              5. Curiositie, &c.
                              6. Pride, &c.
                           
Concerning Ignorance of GOD.
                     
                     THat this is a cause of Witch-craft,
appeareth:
                     
                     Because,2. Tim. 2. 23, 24. 2. Thes. 2. 
                        through the Ignorance that
is in vs, we are led captiue by Sathan at
his pleasure, as being subiect iustly to
his strong delusions, because we haue
not receiued the Loue of the Truth; because
wee know not whom to worship,
how to worship God a right;
therefore doth the God of this world blind
                        
vs because the Gospel is hid from vs.
2. Cor. 4. 5, 6.
                     And doth not Witch-craft vsually
preuaile; when either there is no
meanes for knowledge, or else the
Truth of God is detayned in vnrighteousnesse,
and so for our disobedience
wee are iustly giuen vp to such Delusions,
remember what hath formerly
beene obserued to this end.
                     The Remedie thereof is:
                     1. To haue the word of God dwell plentifully
among vs; both in the Publike
ordinances of the Preaching and Expounding
thereof; as also in the Priuate
Reading, & conferring of the same
in our Families.
                     2. To haue the Power thereof, to
Rule vs in all our wayes:Gal. 6. 6. To yeelde
obedience thereunto, to hearken to
this voyce alone, and to cleaue therevnto
constantly: Endeuouring so to
walke, as we haue receiued Christ Iesus.
Col. 2. 4. And to be daily cast into the
mould thereof. 2. Cor. 3.
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. III.
                     
                        Touching Infidelitie.
                     
                     THat this is also a Cause of this
fearefull Iudgement, appeareth:
                     1. Because by vnbeliefe, we lye open
to Satans power. 1. Pet. 5. 8, 9.
                     2. Through vnbeliefe in God, we
are brought to beleeue in him, to embrace
and adore him as the God of
this world. 2. Cor. 4, 5, 6.
                     3. Hereby wee prouoke the Iust
Lord to leaue vs to his power, to be
insnared of him in all deceiueablenes
of Error, and damnable Impietie.
                     4. This is the speciall bond whereby
Satan tyes his Proselites vnto him, and
they that seeke help from them, they
must beleeue that they can helpe
them, &c.
                     And therefore, the Remedie thereof is:
                     1. As to learne to know God in Iesus
Christ. Ioh. 17. 2.
                     2. To labour aboue all things to
be found in Christ Iesus. Psal. 3. 10.
                     1. By seeing our selues in our selues to be

vtterly lost by the Law. Rom. 7.
                     2. And feeling our state to be most
desperate and irrecouerable.
                     3. Groane we earnestly vnder the
burden thereof. Matth. 11. 28.
                     4. And hunger wee after Iesus
Christ to be eased thereof. Matth. 5.
                     5. Seeking vnto him in his blessed
and precious promises: to bee eased of
our sinnes.
                     
                     6. Meditating seriously on the
power and vertue of his Sacrifice, which
he hath offered for our sinne.
                     7. And applying the same, to our
particular soares and diseases.
                     8. Resting in Iesus Christ alone,
                        1. Cor. 1. as
our onely and sufficient Sauiour.
                     9. And reioycing in him aboue all
the treasures in the world, as in the
most precious Pearle. Matth. 13.
                     10. Labouring to approue our loue
vnto Iesus Christ.
                     1. By forsaking all things for his
sake, our beloued sonne; yea, if it be required,
euen life, and all. Matth. 19.
                     2. Being ready to take vp his Crosse,
and follow him. Matth. 16. 22.
                     
                        
3. Denying still our owne wisedome
and righteousnesse, that wee may bee
found in him. 1. Cor. 3. 18.
                     4. And for thy sake, louing the brethren.
                        Heb. 3. 13.
1. Plucking them out of the
fire. 2. And exhorting each other
daily; waiting with great patience
their Conuersion,Heb. 10. 14. and maintaining
the Fellowship with all meekenesse
of wisedome, and holinesse of Conuersation.
2. Tim. 2. 2.
                     In all Constancie and Patience,
working out our saluation. Phi. 2. 12.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. 4.
                     
                        As for Malice.
                     
                     
                        THat this is an occasion of Witch-craft,
Apppeareth: 1. Because.
                     1. Depriueth vs of the Loue of God,
and so causing the Lord to hate vs,
wee are giuen vp to this damnable
practise.
                     The rather, because it is both a
present and effectuall meanes (as wee
thinke) to execute the vtmost of our
reuenge and it is also a most daungegerous

meanes to colour our Malice,
while it so bringeth it about, that
partly for Feare, wee are forced to
relieue such Instruments, that they
may doe vs no harme, and wee are
drawne to seeke helpe from them in
our extremities, whereby their Malice
being concealed, is more increased,
and beeing often disappoynted
by Satan, is more inflamed, sealing vp
to these cursed Captiues their eternall
damnation: and hastning hereby
the vengeaunce of the LORD
vpon them, both in the Pining of
their bodyes, by this their confounded
Malice, and prouoaking them
to maligne GOD the more, the
more they are disappoynted, whereby
his wrath is more kindled against
them: they are hereby more
eager vpon Satan to execute their
rage, more deepely obliged vnto them,
by new imployments and at length
more desperately confounded by him, in
their detection and punishments.
                     Learne wee therefore to remedie this
sinne, Thus:
                     
                        
1. Labour wee to haue the loue
of Christ shed abroad in our hearts,Rom. 5. 2. that
so for his sake, wee may loue one another.
                     
                     2. And consider we,Rom. 12. 
                        That vengeance
belongeth vnto God, hee is able
to right our wrongs, he is onely for
to doe it.
                     3. Consider wee not so much,
what hurt may arise from the Creature,
as what good may redound vnto
vs thereby; and whether wee receiue
not daily good from the hands of our God,
sufficiently to counteruaile the euill of
the Creature? Whether our GOD
bee not able to recompence any euill
from the Creature, whatsoeuer?
Whither hee cannot turne it to our
great good?
                     
                     4. Giue we not way to the least passion
of anger, or discontent, least our
yeelding to these passions, draw our
confirmed malice.
                     5. And be we wise to set bounds to
our vnreasonable desires, least being
not satisfied therein, we breake out
to enuie, and so to malice others.
                     
                        
6. Especially labour wee to apprehend
the fauour of God in Iesus Christ:
that so being at peace with his Maiestie,
and gayning true contentednesse
in our estates, we may possesse our soules
in patience, and maintaine the Vnitie
of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
                     7: And Practise wee especially the
Loue of our enemies; striue we to ouercome
euill with good, to forgiue our enemies,
to pray for them, &c,
                     8. Enuring our selues to beare afflictions.
                     9. And weaning our soules from
the loue of the world.
                     
                     10. Still endeauouring to make
euen with our God, and to be prepared
against the comming of Iesus Christ.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. V.
                     
                        A fourth Cause of Witch-craft is Couetousnesse.
                     
                     1. A As excluding through distrustfull
and insatiable desires,
the protection of the Almighty.
                     
                     
                        
2. Exposing to desperate contempt
of the Word, in all fearefull impietie.
                     3. Hereby enraging and prouoking
the Conscience to iust reuenge.
                     4. Whereby despayre seasing on
the soule, is become hereby a praye
vnto Satan, vpon hope of present release.
                     5. Being forced by such insatiable
desires to vse unlawfull meanes to compasse
the same, is therefore bayted
by Satan with fit matter hereunto:
What will hee not promise to fetch
ouer the poore soule? What will not
the soule part with to enioy the present
payment? Whats this birth-right
to it, since it dyes for hunger, giue it the
present, and take the future who list.
Gen. 27.
                     The remedie therefore of Couetousnesse
is:
                     1. First, To conuert our Desires to
heauenly obiects; and so to affect that
dureable and true riches.
                     2. And so discerning daily our want
of grace, wee shall still be coueting
the best giftes. 1. Cor. 12.
                     
                        
3. As for earthly things, Desire
we onely our daily bread, as for to morrow
let it care for it selfe, Matth. 6.
                     4. And cast we our care on God, because
he careth for vs. 1. Pet. 5.
                     5. Let our Request be made manifest
vnto God,
                        Phil. 4. 7. who will not faile vs, nor
forsake vs.
                     And learne wee to bee contented
with our estates, submitting to the wil
of God in all things.
                     Consider we the Iudgements of God,
vpon th Couetous persons, he is a spoyler
of others, and therefore shall bee
spoyled: he pines himselfe and robs
others; his children shall bee vagabonds,
and his memoriall perish.
Psal. 109.
                     Meditate wee often on the diuine
Prouidence extending to the briutish
and dumbe creatures. Matt. 6.
                     And consider we seriously of the
Loue of God, in Iesus Christ; who
if hee haue prouided heauen for vs,
will hee deny vs these things?Matt. 6. 33. And
seeing with all our care we winne
nothing,Psal. 127 1. without his blessing, labour

we rather to vse well what wee
haue, then to be coueting more: that
our little being blessed, may be sufficient
vnto vs. Psal. 37.
                     And therefore seeke we the blessing
of God, by renewing our right in
Christ Iesus, and daily sanctifying of
the Creature, by the Word and Prayer:
and so shall the mind bee quieted in
the smallest treasure. 1. Tim. 4. 5.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. VI.
                     
                        A fift Cause of Witch-craft is Curiositie,
And that because:
                     
                     HEereby the mind is deliuered from
necessary knowledge, to scarch after
vaine and hidden mysteries.
                     
                        And so is nourished in wauering,
and vncertaintie in Iudgement.
                     And thereby is easily remooued from
such sound Principles and grounds of
Truth as it hath receiued some tast of
out of the Word of God. And so is
brought by degrees to forsake GOD,
and his holy gouernance, as crossing

corruption and confounding carnall
wisedome.
                     And so is iustly forsaken of God,
and thereby giuen vp by the power
of Satan to be deluded.
                     And so iustly deluded, by such vaine
pretence of extraordinary skill and knowledge;
as through pride of heart is affected
through discontent ensuing from
an enraged conscience, is greedily
embraced to giue present satisfactiō.
                     And thereby is prouoked, with any
future harmes, to procure present ease
and content.
                     Hereupon future hopes are deluded,
and so desperately reiected concerning
Saluation, vppon a vaine perswasion,
of what this extraordinary
knowledge will aduaunce vs to. Namely
to be as Gods to know good and
euill especially if here any possibility
shall appeare to execute such power,
by doing wonderfull things, as may exalt
vs to this conceit of Diuine Excellencie.
                     And this is furthered by a base Esteeme
of such knowledge as concernes

saluation, as being ordinarie, common
to all, obuious to euery capacity. And
therefore seeing, all shall not be saued:
hereupon wee are easily ensnared to
seeke after further knowledg, to
looke for Reuelation, to search into
hidden mysteries.
                     
                        Here Satan closeth with a prophane
heart, tenders meanes of the hidden
Mysteries, colours them with holy
Names, and glorious pretences; as of
subiection to man, &c. And so easily
preuailes vpon an vnstable soule,
to drawe it with some couenant with Satan
to some liking of this skill, especially
beeing carried so couertly,
likely to preuaile so effectually.
                     The Remedie hereof is.
                     To informe the iudgemēt throughly
by the blessed word.
                     
                     And so to be brought in subiection by
the power thereof, to the denyall of carnall
wisedom, with an holy resolution
in all things to be guided by it.
                     To magnifie the mercy of God, for
so plaine and easie a Rule to them that
will vnderstand, and to cleaue to this

Rule alone for direction in all our
wayes. Psal. 8.
                     6. Neither leaning on the Right hād
after dreames, and speculations: Neither
leaning on the left hand to humane
traditions as if the word were insufficient.
Being still humbled in the sense
of our saylings, to what is commanded,
and for our ignoraunce of that wee
should know: And Liuing by Faith,
in expectation of what is promised.
                     Endeauouring as wee haue receiued
Christ, so to walke in him.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. VII.
                     
                        The last and Principall Cause to draw vs
into this deadly snare, is Pride, and
vaine glory.
                     
                     1 AS being both the ground of
all the other euills.
                     2. Being the first sinne that entred
into the world, and discouered
our fearefull bondage vnder Satan.
                     3. Beeing the last sin that we shal
put of, and therefore when Satan

hath done with all other, he begins
with this.
                     4. Being the sin that accompanies our
best actions, to depriue God of his glory
and our selues of the comfort of thē.
                     5. Giuing the Lord occasion to leaue
vs to Satans power, for this our
great blasphemie and sacriledge.
                     6. Giuing Satan occasion the rather
to preuaile in regard of such pretences
and maskes which this sinne hath to
shrowd it selfe vnder, as thankefulnesse
of God: Ioy in his blessings: furtherance
of others good in communicating
with thē, what God hath vouchsafed
vnto vs. And being his most effectuall
baite to ensnare vs in this daungerous
Couenant, because by Pride we are blinded
that wee cannot see our miserie,
nor any daunger lyes vpon vs: and
therefore are more easily drawne to
make vp the measure of it.
                     
                        By Pride, we are prouoked to conceit
our own excellency so farre as to thinke
nothing good enough for vs: and
we think the Lord doth vs wrong, in
not respecting vs accordingly. And

therfore we will right our selues, and
entertaine what is offered, though it
bee by Satan, yet wee presume to
make it serue our turnes, wee conceiue
so highly of our selues, that nothing
can defile, nothing preuaile to
our hurt. Is it not our great preuiledge
to command Satan? shall it not make
for our glory, to hurt and helpe at our
pleasure? Will it not please vs highly,
to heare, The Voyce of GOD, and
not of man.
                     
                     Thus doth Satan by Pride, draw vs-into
his snare.
                     And therefore learne we to Remedie
this great euill. As:
                     First, labour we to discerne throughly
our cursed Nature, take we an often
view of that poysonous fountaine,
and though in regard of outwarde
conformitie and faire shew, we may
haue cause to lift vp our heades, yet
when wee looke throughly within,
we may hang thē down with shame.
                     2. Consider not the good we do, so
much as the euil we daily commit, yea,
that end that accōpanies our best actions.
                     
                     
                        
3 And acknowledge wee, that
whatsoeuer good we haue, I it is vndeserued
on our part, 2 we daily deserue
to be stripped of it.
                     
                     4 Remember wee, the most glorious
creatures haue beene ouer-taken with
this sinne, and therefore, let vs feare
our selues most, when wee enioy greatest
fauours.
                     5 And yet trust God most, when
he seemes to do least for vs.
                     
                     6 Labouring to doe all things as in
the presence of the Almightie: And,
                     
                     7 Auoiding very carefully the applause
and estimation of men.
                     
                     8 Not measuring the grace of God
by outward complements.
                     9 Nor despising the least grace in others,
though we farre exceed them.
                     10 Abounding in thankefulnesse to
God, euen for the least of all his mercies.
                     11 And daily reckoning with our
selues for the abuse of his blessings.
                     12 Walking faithfully and diligently
in the Callings which GOD hath
placed vs in.
                     
                        
13 And submitting to those afflictions,
that are incident thereto.
                     14 Meditating often on the humiliation
of Iesus Christ.
                     15 And on that fulnesse of glorie
that makes for vs in heauen.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. VIII.
                     
                        Conuinceth naturall corruption.
                     
                     AND doth not this Doctrine of
Witch-craft, describe vnto vs
the truth of our naturall condition, that
we are the very slaues of Sathan, and
vessels of wrath, folowing the prince
that ruleth in the children of disobedience,
and so being led captiue by
him at his will? Ephesians chap. 2. vers.
1. 2.
                     Yea certainly, though we should
neuer so much wash our selues with
Niter, and stand vpon our sincerity,
yet the bleating of the sheepe, and
lowing of the oxen, I meane, such
running to Blessers, and closing with cursers,
                        
our fearing these, and worshipping
the other: our refusall of knowledge,
and lawfull meanes for helpe,
and seeking to these diuellish and
most vnlawfull remedies are apparant
Euidences, that his seruants wee are
whom we thus subiect vnto, him we
acknowledge to be our Maister, our
Lord, and Sauiour, whom especially
we seeke vnto, in the time of our
trouble.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. IX.
                     
                        That hereby we are taught the right vse
and excellencie of Faith.
                     
                     AND doth not this Doctrine of
of Witch-craft shew vs also the
true meanes, whereby wee may be
deliuered from the bondage of Sathan,
and so be translated into the
glorious libertie of the sons of God?
yea surely.
                     We are hereby instructed in the excellencie
of Faith, and so to labour the
attayning and preseruing thereof.
                     
                        
As that we may out of the former
discourse perceiue, that this Faith is
it, which Sathan requires of his seruants,
to binde himselfe vnto them,
(if they will beleeue in him:) his special
aime is at our most precious faith, if
he can shake vs heerein, if hee can
cast vs from this hold, he makes sure
account of vs, he holds vs heereby
certainely to damnation: Doth not
this plainly euince the excellencie hereof?
doth it not by the contrary confirme,
how necessary this is to saluation,
that it alone is sufficient
hereto, Acts 13.
                     2 Doth not the Blesser require
this Couenant of her Proselites, shee
will helpe them: if they beleeue in her,
that she can doe them good? &c.
                     And who are they that are freed
from Sathans power, are they not
onely the faithfull? those which are
truely elected, eyther Sathan cannot
touch them at all, or else his afflictions
shall tend to their good:
well may hee afflict the body, but the
soule shall be bettered by it.
                     
                        
And shall not this teach vs especially
to procure this shield of Faith,
that so we may beate backe the fierie
darts of the Diuell? Ephesians chapter
6. vers. 12. 13.
                     Shall it not lesson vs, to learne
still to liue by faith in the Sonne of God:
not hauing our owne righteousnes,
that so in him we may be more then
Conquerours, Romans 8. 34. 35. Galat.
2. 20.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. X.
                     
                        Heereby we are instructed to a conscionable
vse of the word of God.
                     
                     FOr, seeing it is not the Letter and
sound thereof onely that auailes,
for so (as you haue heard) it may
be abused by Sathan to charming and
sorcery, vnlesse we both vnderstand,
and receiue reuerently, yea treasure
it vp in our hearts, and by faith apply it
to our selues, for the Peace of our
soules: then surely is it not enough

onely to heare, and not vnderstand;
not enough to vnderstand onelie,
and not to retayne in memorie: nay,
not sufficient to remember, vnlesse
we beleeue the same, and so expresse
our Faith, in being transformed thereby
into the same Image from glory to glory,
2. Cor. 3.
                     And this may serue to admonish
vs, concerning that customarie and
vnreuerent taking of the name of God in
our mouthes, apparant in our ordinarie
speeches; As oh Lord Iesus &c.
which being no lesse then charmes, as
it confirmeth Witches in their damnable
Trade, so it exposeth vs to be
afflicted by them: yea leaueth vs to
the Iudgement of the Lord, euen to
take that from vs which wee seemed
to haue, of Hypocrites and formall
professors to become open blasphemers
and professed Atheists, scorning
God, Religion, &c.
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. XI.
                     
                        Teacheth the abuse of the Beliefe and
the Commandements.
                     
                     AS also wee may heere be informed
concerning the Abuse of
our Beliefe, as Prayers, which seeing
they are repeated without Vnderstanding,
and so out of their right
ordinance and vse, are they anie
better then a Charme? Is it not rather
a seruice vnto the Diuell then
vnto God?
                     May not this admonish Preachers, to
apply themselues to the capacitie of their
people, to speake with vnderstanding,
power and euidence of the Spirit,
not with the enticing wordes of
mans wisedome, lest they approoue
themselues no better then Charmers,
binding the people faster vnder the
Power of Sathan, by nouzeling them
in Ignorance, Pride, Infidelitie, Profanenesse,
&c. 1. Cor. 2.
                     And the People also may here haue
their lesson; not to liue in ignorance,
                        
but to embrace the light of the Gospel,
whereby Sathans forgeries are
detected, and graciously preuented▪
                     
                     Whereby they may be diuerted
to the true and holy meanes, not
onely for the bodies good, but especially
for the help and saluation of the
poore soule.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XII.
                     
                        Teacheth to make conscience of sinne.
                     
                     VVE are heereby also taught
to make conscience of all sin,
and to haue respect vnto all GODS
commandements; labouring daily to
be renewed by repentance: and so
interest our selues daily in the fauor
of God by Iesus Christ: that seeing
afflictions follow sinners, and Sathan
hath no power ouer vs, but by our
corruption, and corruption being suppressed,
and daily maistered by repentance
and faith in Christ, preuents
Sathans power:
                     Therefore: As it is best to auoide

so, in the next place, if we haue sinned,
let vs do so no more, lest a worse
thing do befal vs, lest the Lord leaue
vs to Satans power, euen to be smitten
by euill angels Iohn 5.

                        Teacheth the deepenesse of Sathan.
                     
                     SEeing the Policie of Sathan is notably
discouered herein, in hiding
his power, cloking his tyrannie
and crueltie against the soule, by
tampering about these pety matters
of the body, diuerting vs dangerously
from the spirituall combate which
Satan hath against the soule, to looke
onely to bodily harmes, as if wee had no
soules, but bodies onely, that were in
danger. May wee not hence learne
the deepenesse of Sathan? Doth not this
teach, that Sathan playes the hypocrite,
making shew to helpe, when he
intends most hurt, and pretending onlie
to hurt the body, when he intends
the hurt of the soule, should not this
teach vs lesse to regard the flesh, and to

                        haue more care for the soule: to arme it
especially by prayer and repentance:
to watch ouer our thoughts, &c. secret
corruptions, &c. whereas we vsually
pray for our cattell, which was but a
policie of Witches, to make vs beleeue,
that by prayer they were preserued
from Witch-craft; whereas indeed
that blinde and ignorant prayer, was
but a colour of Satans help, shrowding
his assistance vnder that pretence
of Diuine worshippe. Had wee not
now more need to pray for our selues,
not crossing and Blessing, &c. as the
manner was in Poperie, but rather
crossing our corruptions, and mortifying
our lustes, whereby wee shall
best preuent the power of Sathan?
                  
                  
                     CHAP. XIIII.
                     
                        And haue we not hence matter of Triall,
both for our priuate, and generally for
the Church of Christ?
                     
                     YEa certainly; for our selues, we may
discerne, whether wee haue sauing

grace, or no. For seeing (as you haue
heard) Sathan and his instruments,
may doe wonderfull things: Therefore
let not this content vs, though
we had euen a miraculous faith, seeing
to such it shall be said, Depart from
me, I know you not, Mat. 7. 22. 23.
but rather, let vs get better euidence of
sauing grace, labouring that our
names may be written in Heauen, Luke
10. 17. and taking the true and only
path of holinesse thereunto, euen true
faith in Iesus Christ, working by loue,
and keeping vs to the end, constant
and vnmoueable vnto the day of
Christ, 1. Cor. 15. vers. vlt.
                     
                     And seeing diuells and false prophets
may do such wōderfull things,
therefore learne we hence, to discerne
of GODS truth, and his holie Spouse:
namely the true Church, not that that
is confirmed by wonders and signes, for
such is the synagogue of Antichrist, but
that which continues in the Apostles
1 Doctrine, and 2 Fellowshippe 3 in
breaking of Bread and 4 Prayer, Act.

                        And may not the Saints of God thereby
learne how to behaue themselues vnder
afflictions.
                     
                     NAmely, as not to presume, but
that it may befall them: no faith
can simply priuiledge from the correction
of the Almightie: so if the
Lord shal exercise them herewith.
                     They are 1 to examine the speciall
cause thereof: And so,
                     2 By Repentance to make their peace
with God.
                     3 Begging instantly the sanctifying
of the affliction: And,
                     4 So the Remouall of it, as may
stand with Gods glorie.
                     5 Not measuring, either the fauor of
God simply, by the remouall therof; or
his anger by the continuance thereof, or
their remouall thereby. But comforting
themselues, though it take away the
miserable life, yet liuing and dying wee
are the Lords: Happy if we go to heauen
though in a fierie chariot.

                        How to preuent Sorcerie.
                     
                     SEeing there is naturally in euerie
Christian the seeds & grounds of such
euills, which may draw, as by these
degrees, 1 to the approbation of this
trade 2 to vse thogh ignorātly, the
very spells and charmes hereof; 3 to
retaine vnder pretence of Charitie, these
cursed instruments, and so to grow familiar
with them, to conceiue well of their
prayers, &c. Seeing (I say) by these
degrees, & such like; vnstable soules
may easily be ensnared, and drawne
on to this diuellish compact: therefore
let vs learne also to preuent this fearefull
league. To this end,
                     Let vs take heed of liuing in grosse
and wilfull ignorance: And while wee
haue the light, let vs embrace it conscionably,
lest we be giuen vp for our
disobedience to these strong delusions.
                     2 Let vs be thorowly perswaded of the
prouidence of God, not onely in generall,
                        
ruling and disposing all things, so
that euery creature is at his cōmand,
not so much as an haire of our heads
can be touched vnlesse the Lord dispose.
                     3 But specially apprehend we that
prouidence of the Almightie, whereby
he hath taken the soule of man into
his especiall protection; as hauing
elected vs to saluation, before the
foundations of the world were laid,
and that in Iesus Christ, to the praise
of his glorious grace: that so we may
neither thinke our soules to bee at our
owne dispose: much lesse may giue way
vnto Santhans suggestion, as to haue
them disposed at his pleasure: especially
seeing hee hath no right thereto: nay,
is the maine enemie, and murtherer
thereof from the beginning, chap. 8.
of Saint Iohn.
                     
                     4 And so let vs learne to resigne
vp our soules daily into the hands of
our God;How to resigne vp our selues into the hands of God. by casting our care vpon him:
and, 1. Pet. 5.
                     Daily making euen with him, by vnfained
repentance.
                     
                     
                        
Submitting daily to his blessed will in
all things: and,
                     
                     Making our requests daily manifest
vnto him.
                     
                     Contenting our selues with his gracious
dispensation: and yet still hungring
continually after his glorious presence,
Psalme 42. Philip. 1. 23. 24. 2. Corint.
5. 1. 2.
                     And so committing our selues in well-doing
into the hands of our faithful Creator,
1. Pet. 4.
                     5 Make we conscience especially
of holie duties, as to do them, 1 of
knowledge, 2 with all holie preparation,
3 with all reuerence and intention,
4 with all humilitie and obedience,
5 especially being well perswaded of
what we doe, 6 and principally of the
acceptance of our persons therein, &c. aboue
the same.
                     Seeing, as whatsoeuer is done ignorantly
or prophanely, is no better
then a sacrifice to the diuell: so it is iust
with God for this prophaning of his
ordinance, to yeelde vs vp to strong
delusions, euen 1 to rest in the worke

done, 2 to flatter our selues, that the
doing thereof may excuse vs for any grose
filthinesse: 3 to thinke that God will
be pleased with any Idoll seruice: 4 so
to make a mocke of God and his ordinances:
5 and therefore iustly to be giuen
vp to the power of Satan, to the satisfying
of our lusts: 6 to abuse holy titles
and prayers to the effecting hereof: and
so by degrees to be brought to this
execrable skill; in steed of seruing
God, to submit wholy to Satan, intertaining
any colourable and accursed
meanes for the compassing hereof.
                     And thus of the Vses for Instruction.

                        A third generall vse, is for consolation.
                        And that,
Eyther in generall to the Church of
God.
                     
                     1. THat Sathans power is limited
by the Lord, for the Triall of

the Elect, and purging out of hypocrites
and prophane persons out of
the Church; and therfore comfort we
our selues in the supreame Power of
our God. Tread wee Satan vnder our
feete, as a Captiue layd bound to our
hands, by our Captaine Iesus Christ.
                     
                     2. Assure we our selues; that the power
that is now so curbed, shall once for
euer bee destroyed: The Lord shall
tread Satan vnder our feet. Rom. 16.
1. Cor. 15. 54, 55, &c.
                     
                        Secondly, here is exceeding comfort▪
That Satan cannot preuaile effectually
vpon any to their condemnation, vnlesse
with full consent they yeelde themselues
wholy to his subiectiō. And if
                     
                     Otherwise, he afflict them against
their wils, it shall howsoeuer, turne to
their good. Christ wil be vnto them both
in life & death an aduantage: and therfore,
here is matter of exceeding comfort
vnto the Saints, that seeing they
are not their owne, but are bought with a
price, therefore none can take them
out of the handes of Christ.1. Cor. 6. 
                        If Satan
therefore shall mooue them to closeIohn 17.
                        
with him, to giue way to him, their
answere is ready: They are not their
owne, let him aske their master leaue:
they cannot giue way to him, he comes
too late; they haue couenanted with
Christ Iesus already; he hath deserued
all seruice at their handes, hee is
sufficient to requite them, nay hee
hath prouided their wages alreadie,
no lesse then a Kingdom is prepared for
them; yea, a Kingdom immortall and
vndefiled, which fadeth not.
                     And if Satan should take aduantage
of our weakenesse and corruption, and
therupon challenge vs to belong vnto
him, to yeelde subiection to him:
our answere is ready, We are not our
owne. It is not I but sinne dwelleth in me:
Let Satan therefore take my sinne, for
that indeed is of him yea, he shal answere
for my infirmitie, because his
malice prouoked it, his cunning allured
me to it. As for me, wherein I
am now my selfe, I delight in the Law
of God concerning my Inward man: I
hate the euill that I do, euen worse then
the Diuel, and I shall desire to be found

in Iesus Christ, that my sinne may bee
pardoned, and my corrupt Nature
healed: That Satans power may bee
abolished, and corruption may bee
swallowed vp of glory.

                        Conclusion to the Wise and Humble
Reader.
                     
                     THus hast thou at length (Deare
Christiā
                        ) some Part of my poore
Obseruations, concerning this Mysterie
of Witch-craft. Wherein for thy
better satisfaction, and mine owne
greater humiliation: As I am not ashamed
to acknowledge, that which
thou canst not but discerne;As his Maiesties Daemonologie, Mr. Perkins, Mr. Gifford, and others. That I
haue borrowed most of my Grounds: For
the Proofe & Discouerie of the Doctrine
of Witch-craft, from the Painefull and
profitable Labours of the Worthies of our
Times▪
                         that haue waded before mee
heerein, to confirme the Authoritie
thereof, against the Atheisme of
these euill dayes: that so each might
haue the perfect honour of their owne
Paines. So haue I thought good,

to ad such experiences and collections
of mine owne partly gathered out of
such Treatises as to this purpose haue
bene published frō time to time touching
the Discouery and Conuiction of
Witches: And partly digested from
particular obseruation of the hand of
God, vpon Parties afflicted, that so
the Doctrine may be made more profitable,
for the edification of the Church.
Wherein I haue spared the seueral Allegations,
and particular testimonies
herein, least the Volume might swell too
much, and so proue tedious, & triuial:
Referring thee and my selfe, for warrant
herein vnto those manifold Treatises
which haue bin frequently published
to this purpose, and are vsually
to be had vpon the Stationers Stalles.
And if any thing ouer & besides hath
bene added out of my particular obseruations
from such generall Passages,
and priuate Meditations, for the
further fastning of this Doctrine vpon
the conscience of the wise Christian,
that he may not dwel in the generall
speculation thereof to increase

curiosity, & so nourish Atheisme: but
rather may bee prouoked to a more
holy vse of the same, by obseruing the
generall Methode, and deepnesse of Satan
herein to ensnare vnstable soules. As
I desire thē herein with me, to magnifie
the free grace of God; So I entreat
them in the bowels of Iesus
Christ, to make the vse thereof. That
whereas the speculation of Truth, without
conscience of profiting thereby, is the
means to depriue vs euē of the knowledge
thereof (which I take to bee a
maine reason, why this Doctrine so
generally acknowledged, both by
Heathen & Christians is notwithstanding
questioned and opposed; because it
meeteth with particular corruptions
and crosseth carnal, and politike designes)
that therefore thou wouldest
still conioyne the Spirituall vse thereof,
with the knowledge of the same. Obseruing
herein, not so much what Witches
may doe for the hurt of the bodie,
but what snares in the harme of the
body they lay for the soule: By withdrawing
the mind frō the knowledge and

                        loue of the glorious gospel of Iesus Christ;
and bewitching the same, with the
loue of superstition that would faine,
and by this means (as hath bin obserued)
is very likely to preuaile among
vs, obseruing wisely, that such oppositions,
as haue been made against this
manifest Truth, haue not bin so much
in regard of The Literall Truth it selfe,
as in respect of such Spirituall consequence
of more sacred and necessarie
Trueths which depend thereupon. As
the power of the Gospel in preuailing against
Witchcraft, and so therein confounding
all formall worship, & Popery.
The effect of the Gospel following necessarily
vpon the doctrine, Namely, The day
of Iudgement; the punishment of the wicked
in hell, &c. The authority of the Magistrate,
in punishing these Hel-hounds,
&c. Wherein as thou mayest obserue
the wonderfull wisedome of God, in confounding
the craftienesse of Idolaters, that
while with one breath they are glad to
beg this testimony from hell, for the iustifying
of their hellish idolatry & worship,
in aduancing of their lying miracles;

and so do approue, to this end
of this doctrine of Witchcraft, yet euen
with another; they would faine blow away
this truth againe, because it makes
to the cōfirmation of the Power of the
Gospel, as discouering the Iuglings,
and treacheries therin: so let this aduice
thee, not to rest in the Forme of
Religion, but to labour to embrace the
power therof: & to make vse of these spirituall
Obseruations: to this end. Promising
thee, that as I haue endeuoured
to discouer some part of Satans
deepnesse heerein, so (if the Lord spare
health & liberty) shalt thou be shortly
furnished with a more plentifull discouery
of Satans Delusions against the
whole practise of sanctification to settle
thy conscience: wherof thou hast for
the Information of thy iudgement
the someIn the first Part of the Christians dayly Sacrifice.
                         formerly deliuered vnto
thee. And so I heartily commend
thee to the grace of GOD, which is
able to builde thee further in the
power of Godlinesse, and so to present
thee blamelesse, vnto the comming
of our Lord Iesus Christ.
                     
                     
                        
Praying thee to passe by such
faults of Forme and Complement, as
my manifold infirmities and want of
leasure may giue occasion of, and to
amend such other of Impression as
thou shalt hereby be furnished. And
so againe; crauing thy hearty Prayers
for the continuance, both of Publicke
and Priuate-Libertie, I commend
thee vnfainedly to the blessing
of our good God, who will for his
glorie reserue Light in Israel, for
the full demolishing of the Kingdom
of Antichrist; and for the glorious
and more perfit aduauncement
of his holy Sonne IESVS, in all
his Ordinances: To whom be praise
and Obedience throughout all
the Churches. And in
whom I rest.
                     
                        Thy poore Remembrancer
at the Throne of Grace.
